Introduction
Ischemia is a critical and current problem related to myocardial infarction. Not only the ischemia but also reperfusion has proven as relevant for the severity of infarction size.
To protect the heart from these harmful influences, preconditioning strategies were shown as a promising strategy [ , ]. Murry et al. determined for the first time the protective effect of ischemic preconditioning over 30 years ago [ ]. Ischemic preconditioning, composed of short alternate phases of myocardial ischemia and reperfusion before a longer ischemic period, represents the most intense stimulus leading to infarct size reduction, unfortunately, the intervention is extremely invasive and impracticable for clinical use. In contrast to ischemic preconditioning, pharmacological preconditioning mimics the effect of ischemic preconditioning without being so invasive. Several drug classes have been found to induce preconditoining (e.g., volatile anesthetics, nitrates, beta blockers, adenosine by a particular mechanism [ ]). Cao and colleagues showed in 2005 that ischemic preconditioning is abolished by blockade of the mitochondrial calcium-sensitive potassium (mBK Ca )-channel [ ]. Further studies reveal that these channels are not only important for ischemic preconditioning. In 2016, Kinoshita et al. noticed that isoflurane-induced postconditioning activates mBK Ca -channels but that there is no cardioprotective effect while these channels are blocked by the selective mBK Ca -channel blocker iberiotoxin [ ]. Caimmi et al. found out that levosimendan causes significant reduction of infarction size if it is infused in the coronary artery for 15 min before ischemia [ ]. Levosimendan is a myofilament calcium sensitizer. The drug interacts with cardiac troponin c that leads to a higher sensitivity for Ca 2+ in cardiomyocytes. As a consequence, levosimendan causes a positive inotropic effect without influencing the diastolic function [ ]. Furthermore, levosimendan activates ATP-dependent potassium channels in vascular smooth muscle cells causing a vasodilatory effect that has also a positive impact on coronary perfusion. Levosimendan is clinically used for the treatment of acute cardiac failure. Along with Caimmi et al., further studies have shown cardioprotective effects of levosimendan but the underlying molecular mechanism is not completely known [ ].
The aim of our study was first to determine whether preconditioning with levosimendan is dose-dependent and a second to evaluate if the cardioprotective effect of levosimendan leads to an activation of large-conductance calcium-sensitive potassium (mBK Ca )-channels.
Methods
The study was conducted on the baseline of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the National Institutes of Health (Publication number 85-23, revised 1996). The approval of the Animal Ethics Committee of the University of Duesseldorf, Germany has been granted.
Surgical Preparation
The surgical preparation was performed as described previously [ ]. Male Wistar rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (90 mg/kg). Hereafter, animals were thoracotomized for the removal of the hearts. The hearts were mounted on a Langendorff system and perfused with a Krebs-Henseleit solution. For the time of the experiment, a constant pressure (80 mmHg) and temperature (37 °C) was maintained [ ]. We inserted a fluid-filled balloon into the left ventricle and kept an end-diastolic pressure of 1–4 mmHg. The hearts underwent an equilibration period for 20 min. The heart rate, left ventricular end-systolic pressure (LVESP), and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) were measured continuously and digitized using an analog to digital converter (PowerLab/8SP, ADInstruments Pty Ltd, Castle Hill, Australia) at a sampling rate of 500 Hz. The data were continuously recorded on a personal computer using Chart for Windows v5.0 (ADInstruments Pty Ltd, Castle Hill, Australia). The coronary flow was detected by time-dependent collection of the coronary effluent. The maximal contracture and the time point of maximal contracture were measured in each experiment during ischemia [ ].
Experimental Protocol
In the first part of the study, we designed a protocol for determining a dose-effect curve of levosimendan (Fig. 1 a). Therefore, we randomly assigned hearts into five groups ( n = 8 per group). Fig. 1 a , b Experimental protocol. Figure 1 a shows part 1 of the study: Con = control, Levo = levosimendan; Fig. 1 b shows part 2 of the study: Con = control, Levo = levosimendan, Pax = paxilline
After surgical preparation, all hearts underwent baseline conditions for 20 and 33 min of global ischemia followed by 60 min of reperfusion. Hearts in the control group (Con) received no further intervention. Preconditioning groups were perfused with levosimendan (Lev) with different concentrations (0.03, 0.1, 0.3, and 1 μM) over 10 min before global ischemia. Based on the findings of part 1, we chose the levosimendan concentration of 0.3 μM for further investigations. In this second part, we randomly assigned hearts into four groups ( n = 8 per group). Control hearts were left untreated again. To investigate the involvement of mBK Ca channels, the selective inhibitor paxilline (Pax, 1 μM) [ , , , , ] was given with and without levosimendan before global ischemia (Fig. 1 b). Afterwards, the hearts were dyed with 0.75% triphenyltetrazoliumchloride (TTC) solution. The infarct size measurement was carried out using planimetry [ ].
Statistical Analysis
Calculation of sample size was done by using GraphPad StatMate™ (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) and resulted in a group size of n = 8 for detecting a 25% difference in infarct size with a power of 80% (α < 0.05 (two-tailed)). Hemodynamic parameters were measured continuously and detected during baseline, ischemia, and reperfusion. To compare hemodynamic parameters between groups or between different time points within groups, we used a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a Tukey post hoc test (SPSS Science Software, Version 12.0.1). The infarct sizes were determined by an investigator blinded to the experimental groups. A one-way analysis (ANOVA) was chosen, followed by a Tukey post hoc test to analyze infarct size. Data are presented as mean ± SD. Changes were regarded statistically significant if P < 0.05.
Results
Animal Characteristics
In part 1 of the study, mean body weight of the animals was 298 ± 21 g, and in part 2, weight was nearly the same (297 ± 23 g). Tables 1 and 2 show time and level of ischemic contracture from both parts of the study. There were no differences in time of maximal ischemic contracture between the experimental groups. The level of maximal ischemic contracture of the Pax + Lev group was statistically different compared to Con- and Pax group (Table 2 ).

Infarct Size
Infarct size in control hearts from part 1 was 58 ± 7% of the whole heart (Fig. 2 a). The strongest cardioprotective effect with the lowest dose of Levosimendan (Lev) was detected at a concentration of 0.3 μM. Infarct size was reduced to 30 ± 7% ( P < 0.05 vs. Con). A higher concentration of levosimendan with 1 μM did not lead to a further infarct size reduction (Lev 1: 30 ± 5%; ns vs. Lev 0.3), while 0.1 μM levosimendan also reduced infarct size (Lev 0.1: 47 ± 9%, P < 0.05 vs. Con) but the effect of 0.3 μM levosimendan was more pronounced compared to 0.1 μM (Lev 0.1: 47 ± 9%, P < 0.05 vs. Lev 0.3). Levosimendan with a concentration of 0.03 μM was not protective (Lev 0.03: 55 ± 6%; ns vs. Con). Fig. 2 a , b Infarct size measurement. Figure 1 a shows the infarct size of controls (Con) and preconditioning with levosimendan (Levo); Fig. 1 b shows the infarct size of controls (Con), preconditioning with levosimendan (Levo) with or without the mBK Ca -channel inhibitor paxilline (Pax).

Figure 2 b shows infarct sizes from part 2 of the study investigating the involvement of mBK Ca -channels in levosimendan-induced preconditioning. Infarct size of the control group was 64 ± 5%. Administration of 0.3 μM levosimendan reduced infarct size to 27 ± 4% ( P < 0.05 vs. Con). The cardioprotective effect of levosimendan was completely abrogated by the mBK Ca -channel inhibitor paxilline (Pax + Lev: 62 ± 7%, P < 0.05 vs. Mil) while the blocker alone had no effect on infarct size (Pax: 56 ± 6%, ns vs. Con).
Cardiac Function
Hemodynamic data from both parts of the study are shown in Tables 3 and 4 . Furthermore, Fig. 3 shows hemodynamics from part 2 of the study. Heart rate, LVESP, and LVEDP were continuously recorded. Coronary flow was measured via time-dependent collection of the coronary effluent. Values were compared to both baseline values of the same group (time effect) and to values of the other groups at the same time point (group effect). After ischemia and during reperfusion, LVEDP and coronary flow were statistically different from baseline in all groups in both parts of the study (Tables 3 and 4 , Fig. 3 ). In part 1 of the study, heart rate was statistically different compared to baseline after ischemia (Table 3 ). Coronary flow increased before ischemia in the Lev 0.3 and Lev 1 group (Table 3 ).

Discussion
Our present results show that the use of levosimendan as preconditioning stimulus leads to dose-dependent powerful reduction in infarct size. This cardioprotective effect of levosimendan requires activation of mBK Ca -channels.
Levosimendan is a calcium sensitizer [ ] that increases sensitivity for Ca 2+ in cardiomyocytes without elevating the intracellular calcium levels [ ]. Besides the calcium sensitizing effect of levosimendan, Virag et al. could demonstrate that this drug also has electrophysiological effects similar to those of phosphodiesterase inhibitors [ ]. The authors could show that levosimendan had no influence on potassium currents whereas they detected an effect on the inward calcium current in guinea pig ventricular muscles. A comparable effect of levosimendan on calcium current was shown by Ajiro et al. These authors investigated studied human atrial cells and showed that compared to rabbit atrial cells, the effect of levosimendan on L-type Ca 2+ currents was more pronounced. In our study, the effect of levosimendan in rat atrial and ventricular cells was negligible.
Levosimendan is used for treatment of acute heart failure and Levin et al. demonstrated that preoperative use of levosimendan can lower mortality [ ]. Besides the improvement of heart function, Papp et al. showed that levosimendan can lower the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias after regional ischemia and reperfusion injury [ ]. The authors demonstrated in dogs in vivo that levosimendan compared to milrinone attenuated among others the number of ventricular premature beats, tachycardia, and fibrillation. Furthermore, levosimendan improved the overall survival rate. Preconditioning properties of levosimendan were shown by Lepran et al. [ ]. The authors demonstrated in the isolated rabbit heart that levosimendan significantly reduced infarct size but the effect was not as distinct as shown by ischemic preconditioning [ ].
The present study reveals that preconditioning by levosimendan reduced infarct size by about 50%. The most cardioprotective dose of levosimendan was 0.3 μM. An increased dose of 1 μM could not induce a stronger protective effect. To our knowledge, there is no study available investigating a dose-effect of levosimendan in terms of preconditioning.
Our results furthermore highlight that the activation of mBK Ca -channels is a key element in the signaling cascade of levosimendan-induced preconditioning. mBK Ca -channels are located in the inner mitochondrial membrane [ ] and belong to the supercategory of voltage-gated potassium channels and their function is the maintenance of the calcium homeostasis [ , ].
Behmenburg et al. showed that reduction of infarct size induced by sildenafil in rat hearts depends on activation of these channels [ ]. Furthermore, Frassdorf et al. demonstrated comparable results for preconditioning by morphine [ ]. It seems that activation of mBK Ca -channels plays a crucial role in context of pharmacological preconditioning. Our results further demonstrate that the administration of paxilline completely abrogates the cardioprotective effect of levosimendan. Paxilline is a strong and selective mBK Ca -channel blocker [ , , ]. This mycotoxin produced by the fungus Penicillium Paxilli blocks all subunits of mBK Ca -channels [ ] confirming our conclusion that levosimendan induces preconditioning via activation of these channels. In addition to the mBK Ca -channel, another mitochondrial channel has been described in conjunction with preconditioning. The ATP-sensitive potassium (K ATP )-channel plays an important role in cardioprotection [ ]. Yokoshiki et al. investigated different doses of levosimendan and could show that levosimendan activated K ATP -channels in isolated rat ventricular cells [ ]. The effect of levosimendan was completely abolished by the K ATP -channel blocker glibenclamide. Kaheinen and colleagues could show in guinea pigs in vitro that activation of K ATP -channels also induces coronary vasodilatation [ ]. This effect was noncompetitively blocked by glybenclamide without affecting the positive influence on contraction.
Pharmacological preconditioning seems to be a promising strategy to protect patients from myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury in the clinic. Unfortunately, the transfer from this protective intervention into clinical routine was not successful until to date. One reason for difficulties in transferring laboratory results to the clinic could be the fact that an experimental environment can only depict parts of the real clinical situation in humans. In contrast to the laboratory setup, where influence factors and disturbances can be excluded from the outset, patients in the clinical situation suffer from comorbidities and potential confounders of cardioprotection. Confounders and influencing factors can be of variable origin. Lange et al. could show that, e.g., beta blockers abolish cardioprotection induced by desflurane preconditioning [ ]. The same group demonstrated that also propofol abolished the protective effects of desflurane [ ]. Beyond that, the antidiabetic drug glibenclamide was shown to abrogate cardioprotection by ischemic preconditioning [ ]. In addition to co-medications, there are other factors that have an influence on cardioprotection. Age was shown to influence cardioprotection by preconditioning. Schulman et al. demonstrated loss of ischemic preconditioning in the aged heart [ ]. There are other studies confirming aging as a factor that influences cardioprotective interventions negatively [ ]. We could previously demonstrate that pharmacological activation of mBK Ca -channels with the selective channel activator NS1619 leads to a reduction of myocardial infarct size even in the aged rat heart [ ]. The fact that activation of the mBK Ca -channels can also produce cardioprotection in the presence of influencing factors such as age highlight the relevance of this channel in the field of preconditioning and demonstrate a clear difference to cardioprotection mediated by K ATP -channels, where less activation was found with increasing age [ ]. Furthermore, Heinen et al. could not only show that infarct size was reduced in old rats if mBK Ca -channels were activated by NS1619, but also reduction was to the same extent as in young rats [ ]. Especially, these results highlight the special importance of mBK Ca -channels as a relevant and promising target structure for cardioprotection even if interfering factors are present.
Of course, age is just one of many known comorbidities influencing cardioprotection. Diabetes and hyperglycemia, respectively [ , ], also block myocardial protection by preconditioning and this blockade could not be overcome by the use of levosimendan [ ]. As described above, concomitant medications that block cardioprotective effects in the patient additionally form an obstacle for successful cardioprotection. Nevertheless, mBK Ca -channels represent an interesting and promising target for cardioprotection as well in the diseased myocardium. Further research should focus on investigating the specific site in the signaling pathway inhibited by concomitant diseases and concomittant medical therapies.
Conclusion
The results of our current study show that the calcium sensitizer levosimendan induces cardioprotection when administered as a preconditioning treatment. The protective effect of levosimendan is most pronounced with a dosage of 0.3 μM. Furthermore, activation of mBK Ca -channels is a pivotal step in the signaling pathway of levosimendan-induced preconditioning.
