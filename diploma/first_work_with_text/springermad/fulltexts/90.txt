Introduction
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a growing global health problem with major health and economic implications. Cardiovascular (CV) mortality attributable to CKD has increased from 30,400/year in 1990 to 60,300 in 2010. It is the leading cause of death in these patients. , The risk for CV mortality increases with decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). With the advancing age of the population, the incidence of CKD is increasing and has become an important public health problem. , Therefore, risk stratification of CKD patients at risk of CV mortality is essential to implement preventive strategies.
Single-photon emission computed tomography-myocardial perfusion imaging (SPECT-MPI) is commonly used to predict cardiac events in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). – The incidence of major adverse cardiac events was reported to be higher in patients with CKD compared to patients with normal kidney function. – Several studies demonstrated the prognostic value of SPECT-MPI for all-cause mortality in CKD patients. – However, there is a dearth of literature demonstrating risk reclassification and prediction of CV mortality using both GFR and perfusion findings on SPECT-MPI.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the incremental and independent prognostic value of SPECT-MPI over renal function and its impact on risk reclassification of CV mortality and myocardial infarction.
Methods
Study Design, Settings, and Patient Population
Consecutive patients referred for a SPECT-MPI for investigation of known or suspected CAD between April 2004 and May 2009 at Henry Ford Health System, Detroit, MI, USA were included in this analysis. Patients with severe valvular heart disease or heart transplant were excluded from this analysis (Figure 4 in Appendix). Patients’ demographics, clinical history, and medications were collected at the time of the imaging study using standardized questionnaire. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the study institution.
Patients’ demographics and clinical characteristics were obtained at the time of the SPECT-MPI. Smoking status was self-reported. Diabetes mellitus was defined as a prior diagnosis of diabetes, use of hypoglycemic medications including insulin, or a database-verified diagnosis of diabetes. Obesity was defined as body mass index >30 kg/m 2 . Hypertension was defined as a prior diagnosis of hypertension or use of antihypertensive medications. The blood pressure at the time of the test was not used to diagnose hypertension. Dyslipidemia was defined by prior diagnosis of any major lipid abnormality or use of lipid-lowering medications. Coronary heart disease was defined as a history of prior myocardial infarction, coronary angioplasty, or coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. Heart failure was defined as prior clinical diagnosis of systolic or diastolic heart failure.
Quantification of Renal Function
Creatinine measured within 180 days (median, 5.5 days; 25th to 75th percentiles; 0.3 to 27.7) was used to estimate renal function. When a patient had multiple creatinine values, we used the result closest to the SPECT-MPI test.
Calculated GFRs were calculated using the Levey Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula, GFR = 175*standardized S Cr −1.154 * age −0.203 * 1.212 (if black)* 0.742 (if female). The calculated GFR values were categorized as <30 mL/minute per 1.73 m 2 , 30 to 59 mL/minute per 1.73 m 2 , 60 to 89 mL/minute per 1.73 m 2 and =>90 mL/minute per 1.73 m 2 , based on the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative classification of kidney function. Patients on dialysis were included in group 4 (GFR <30 mL/minute per 1.73 m 2 ). CKD was defined as GFR less than 60 mL/minute per 1.73 m 2 .
SPECT-MPI protocol and image analysis
All patients underwent rest/stress 99m Tc sestamibi SPECT-MPI as per standard protocols. Patients were imaged using Infinia Hawkeye gamma camera from General Electric, WI, USA. The stress protocol composed of symptom-limited exercise treadmill test or pharmacological stress testing (adenosine or dobutamine). Patients were instructed not to consume coffee or other products containing caffeine/nicotine for at least 24 hours prior to the test. During stress testing, heart rate, blood pressure, and a 12-lead ECG were monitored continuously for the development of arrhythmia or ST segment changes. In accordance with laboratory protocol, patients unable to exercise underwent adenosine stress testing. When adenosine was contraindicated, dobutamine stress testing was performed. Imaging was performed 45 minutes after injection of radiotracer with a 2-head gamma camera with step-and-shoot rotation, 64 projections over a 180 * arc), 30 seconds per projection, and 64 × 64 matrices. Gated images were acquired by use of 8 frames per cardiac cycle. Transverse images were reconstructed with a butterworth filter (order of 5 cut-off frequency of 0.792 cycles per pixel) for all studies.
All scans were read by a single reader blinded to the clinical information. All studies assessed using semi-quantitative visual analysis on a standard 17-segment model and a 5-point scoring system. Global summed scores were computed for the stress images [Summed Stress Score (SSS), reflecting the combined extent and severity of ischemia plus scar), and rest images (Summed Rest Score (SRS), reflecting the extent and severity of myocardial scar], as well as their difference [Summed Difference Score (SDS), reflecting the combined magnitude of myocardial ischemia]. A SPECT-MPI result was considered to be normal if the SSS was <4 and abnormal when the SSS was ≥4. Ischemia on scans was categorized as mild when the SDS was 1 to 3, moderate when the SDS was 4 to 7, or severe when the SDS was >7. , Percent abnormal myocardium was estimated by dividing SSS by 68. High-risk scans were defined as percent abnormal myocardium >20% of the left ventricle. Left ventricular ejection fraction was analyzed on the rest and stress gated images using commercially available software (INVIA 4DM, version 8, MI, USA).
Outcomes Assessment
The primary outcomes were CV death and non-fatal myocardial infarction. The secondary outcome was all-cause mortality. Cause of death was determined by blinded adjudication of hospital records by two independent observers blinded to the scan results. Non-fatal myocardial infarction was defined by an appropriate combination of elevated cardiac enzymes, ECG changes, and ischemic symptoms (e.g., chest pain, exertional dyspnoea, and palpitation) and adjudicated by blinded adjudication of hospital records by two independent observers. The annualized CV mortality rates for each group were calculated by dividing the observed CV mortality rate during the follow-up duration by the mean follow-up time.
Statistical Analysis
Categorical data are presented as percent frequencies and compared between groups by chi-square or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate. Continuous variables are presented as mean ± standard deviation and compared using Student t-test or Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Non-normally distributed variables are presented as median and 25th to 75th interquartile ranges and were compared using non-parametric testing (Mann-Whitney test).
Unadjusted Kaplan-Meier estimates were computed for those with and without CV mortality or myocardial infarction and were compared using the log-rank procedure. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were used to compute hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the independent predictors. The models were tested for proportional hazard assumption. The primary analysis was to assess the association between calculated GFR and survival time free of CD/MI after adjusting for baseline clinical, historic, and imaging covariates. The secondary analysis was to assess the association between calculated GFR and survival time free of all-cause mortality. Selection of variables for entry consideration was based on clinical judgment, results of previous publications, and the expertise of the investigators. For exploring non-linear relationship of GFR with CD/MI, we constructed cubic spline with knots at 5th, 50th, and 95th percentiles. We also tested the interaction between eGFR and SSS in the fully adjusted Cox proportional hazard model.
For estimation of risks, baseline model was generated including traditional CV risk factors. Subsequently, perfusion finding as a continuous variable SSS (Model 2), SDS (Model 3), SRS (Model 4), rest ejection fraction (Model 5), stress ejection fraction (Model 6), and SSS ≥ 4 (Model 7) were added in a step-wise fashion to demonstrate independent predictors of CD/MI (Table 2 ). Model calibration was evaluated with D’Agostino χ 2 statistic, and the c-index was calculated for each model with comparisons using the method of Antolini and colleagues. , We computed Harrell’s concordance index (C-index) to compare the models with and without using this methodology developed for survival analyses. The added predictive ability of perfusion findings was investigated using integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) and relative IDI. IDI quantifies the increase in the difference between mean predicted risks for participants who did and did not develop CD/MI after adding perfusion findings to the model. Additionally, net reclassification improvement (NRI) which quantifies any desirable change in predicted risk was computed using the following risk categories: <1%, 1% to 3%, >3%. The risk categories for NRI was chosen based on guideline-suggested cut-offs. Confidence intervals for both IDI and NRI were computed using bootstrapping with 1000 replicates. Statistical significance was defined as p- value <.05. SAS Version 9.3 (Cary, NC) was used for all the analyses.
Results
A total of 11,518 (mean age 64.6 ± 12.3 years, 51.7% males, 39.4% black) were included in this analysis. Table 1 summarizes the baseline characteristics of the study cohort. The mean GFR was 66.3 ± 25.5 mL/minute per 1.73 m 2 and the prevalence of CKD was 4,403 (38.2%). Patients with CKD (GFR < 60 mL/minute per 1.73 m 2 ) were older and had a higher prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and prior CAD. Additionally, those with lower GFR values were more often using the following medications: aspirin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, β-blockers, and lipid-lowering medications (Table 1 ).

In this cohort, 49.2% of patients underwent exercise stress testing, 46.4% underwent adenosine stress, and 4.4% underwent dobutamine stress. Patients with reduced GFR were less likely to undergo exercise stress testing (40% vs 11% in patients with GFR >90 vs <30 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 , respectively, p < .001). Overall, 5,474 patients (47.5%) had a perfusion defect on the SPECT-MPI. The frequency of myocardial perfusion abnormalities increased with worsening kidney function (40% and 59.9% in patients with GFR >90 vs <30 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 , respectively, p < .001).
Over a median follow-up period of 5.0 years (25th to 75th percentiles, 3.0 to 6.5 years), 1,692 (14.5%) patients developed CD/MI (740 MI and 1182 CD) and 2,691 (23.4%) developed all-cause mortality. The annual CD/MI rate was higher for CKD compared with non-CKD patients (Figure 1 ). Figure 1 Annualized cardiac death/non-fatal myocardial infarction rate for myocardial perfusion imaging results across stages of renal function. Myocardial Perfusion Imaging Normal Summed Stress Score <4, Mild Summed Stress Score 4–8, Moderate to Severe Summed Stress Score >8. Figure shows the actual number of people who had an event across all comparison groups during the period of follow up (5 years)
The event-free survival curves for CKD and non-CKD patients stratified by the presence of perfusion defect are shown in Figure 2 . In Cox proportional hazard model, poor renal function was an independent predictor of CD/MI in the baseline analysis (HR per decrement of 10 mL/minute per 1.73 m 2 of GFR: 1.22; 95% CI 1.20-1.25, p <.001). Furthermore, there was a significant interaction between GFR and SSS for the risk of CD/MI ( p for interaction = 0.005) (Figure 5 in Appendix). In multivariable models adjusted for various findings on nuclear stress test in addition to traditional risk factors, SSS remained an independent predictor of CD/MI (HR per 1 SSS increase = 1.07; 95% confidence interval = 1.06, 1.08, p < .001). When SSS was examined as a dichotomous variable, SSS ≥4 was independently associated with increased risk of CD/MI (HR = 2.10; 95% CI = 1.81, 2.43, p < .001) (Tables 2 ; 6 in Appendix).

We also examined incremental predictive value of various findings on nuclear stress test in CKD patients and found that SSS ≥10 showed superiority above other measures (Tables 3 , 4 ). The addition of SSS ≥4 and SSS ≥10 to the model resulted in significant reclassification (Table 7 in Appendix). SSS ≥4 reclassified 14% of the study cohort, while SSS ≥10 reclassified 12%. The event rate of the reclassified patients was similar irrespective in which category they were in prior to incorporating the stress MPI results (Figure 3 ).

Discussion
In this large cohort study, we examined the incremental prognostic value of SPECT-MPI-derived perfusion findings in CKD patients over a median follow-up period of 5 years. We demonstrated that the addition of the result of SPECT-MPI over and above the conventional cardiovascular risk factors (including CKD) improved the prediction of CD/MI and all-cause mortality.
Comparison with the Previous Studies
Our study is in agreement with the previously reported literature. In a retrospective Japanese cohort of 1,739 patients with known CAD, investigators found that patients with CKD and SSS ≥10 had annual death rate of 5.1% vs. 0.8% in non-CKD patients with SSS <9. In another study including 1,652 US male veterans, the mortality rate of male veterans with CKD and SSS ≥4 was 13.8% over a mean duration of 2.2±0.8 years. On the other hand, patients with CKD (GFR >60 ml/min) and SSS <4 had CV mortality rate of 2.6%. The mortality rates in our study were comparable but lower than those observed in US male veterans, which are explained by the lower burden of risk factors in this particular selected group. A comparison of our study with the previously reported studies is shown in Table 5 . , – , – Table 5 A comparison of mortality rates with the previously reported studies Author Year of publication Sample size Follow-up duration Inclusion Criteria Exclusion Criteria Mortality rate in subgroup SSS Matsumoto et al. 2007 2170 27 months Clinical indicated for patients with suspected CAD who underwent SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging Hypertrophic and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, Unstable angina (UA) or Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) within 2 weeks, revascularization within 60 days before MPI.

Our study is not only unique because of its large sample size with diverse racial demographics but also provides various predictive indices in the form of NRI, area under the curve, and IDI. All of these measures showed a benefit of adding information obtained by perfusion scan to the conventional risk models. In addition, we observed that SSS is more predictive of adverse outcomes than ejection fraction or change in ejection fraction with stress. SSS ≥4 reclassified 14% of the individuals, which is important when we consider the growing number of individuals with CKD in the United States. Previous studies have not examined the impact of ejection fraction and contractile reserve in predicting CV mortality in CKD patients. It is well known that the larger the SSS, the lower the ejection fraction is; however, we showed that SSS in addition to ejection fraction is associated with worse outcomes. Therapies to improve or reduce perfusion defects are particularly important and should be investigated to improve mortality in CKD patients.
Explanation of Findings
It is important to understand that perfusion defects on imaging are not only a measure of atherosclerotic disease burden (anatomy) but also coronary vascular health (physiology). It is been shown that there is endothelial dysfunction in CKD which is induced by vasotoxins. Inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6, and C-reactive protein have longer serum half-lives in CKD patients. , Independent prognostic value of biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction and inflammation has been demonstrated in the past. High oxidative stress and increased level of the endogenous nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethyl arginine (ADMA) are other markers of endothelial dysfunction in CKD patients that are known to predict mortality. These markers have shown to be associated with atherogenesis and thus might lead to impaired perfusion response to stress agents such as adenosine, dobutamine, and exercise. Thus, it is plausible that the perfusion findings provide incremental prognostic value to already known cardiovascular risk factors and since endothelial dysfunction becomes more important in CKD population, it has better predictive value in this high-risk population.
Implications
It is necessary to put these findings into context when the previous literature suggests that conventional cardiovascular risk factors poorly predict cardiovascular events in CKD patients. In the light of this background, this study has important implications. First, this is the largest study until now to show that SPECT-MPI has a prognostic value in patients across the spectrum of renal function. Second, these data suggest that in moderate CKD a normal SPECT-MPI is reassuring and these individuals are at <2% annual risk of CV mortality and myocardial infarction. Thirdly, even a moderate-sized perfusion defect SSS ≥4 increases the risk of CV mortality and myocardial infarction by 200%-300% across the spread of renal function. More pragmatically, frequently these patients are transplant candidates and undergo myocardial perfusion scanning which is a possible way to assess and inculcate these perfusion findings into decision making and supporting efforts to provide appropriate care to CKD patients. Fourthly, as we see that the renal function declines the risk of CV mortality and myocardial infarction increases, it is further emphasized to treat and manage cardiovascular risk factors in these individuals early on as the risk becomes tenfold for CKD stage 4. By identifying patients who are high risk for adverse events that accompany CKD, we may provide tailored therapeutic interventions to CKD patients, which could slow disease progression meaningfully and hence reduce the frequency of these adverse events. Institution of early treatment in CKD subgroups of cardiovascular trials has shown to benefit as much or more than the subgroup without CKD from intensive reduction in cardiovascular risk factors. –
New Knowledge Gained
CKD is becoming more prevalent as the population ages. These patients are frequently assessed for symptoms or preoperative evaluation. We have shown that SPECT-MPI can provide incremental prognostic value in this group of patients and reclassify these patients into low or high risk. Our analysis suggests that the burden of perfusion defects in addition to conventional cardiovascular risk factors is associated with cardiac death and non-fatal myocardial infarction as well as all-cause mortality. This information can reclassify up to 14% of CKD patients.
Limitations
There are several limitations of this study worth mentioning. First, this is a retrospective study and has all the limitations of retrospective cohort studies. The data were obtained through electronic health care records and there is a risk of documentation bias (some risk factors might not be properly documented in the charts), Berkson’s bias (the relative frequency of disease in hospitalized or clinically tested patients is higher when compared with the general population), and diagnostic suspicion bias (knowledge of patients prior exposure to certain disease may influence diagnosis of certain condition). However, we used hard endpoints in order to minimize some of these biases. We used semi-quantitative approach to estimate SSS which uses visual estimation of 17-segment model. , This relies on the expertise of the observer and hence may limit extrapolation of our results. In addition, we used MDRD equation for calculation of glomerular filtration rate. This may be less accurate at levels above 60mL/minute/per 1.73 m 2 . However, it is better than other equations for CKD patients. Some validation studies have shown it to be better than Cockcroft Gault equation. However, the isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) calibration performed is currently the most accurate and recommended method to use.
Conclusions
In conclusion, this study demonstrates incremental prognostic value of SPECT-MPI findings over conventional risk factors in CKD patients. Further studies are needed to study the combination of various data obtainable from SPECT-MPI to improve the predictive ability of SPECT-MPI even further.
