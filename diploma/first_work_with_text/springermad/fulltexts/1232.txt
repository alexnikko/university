Introduction
About 5.8 million patients die each year as a result of injuries, which accounts for 10 % of the world’s deaths. This amounts to 32 % more than the number of fatalities that result from malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS combined (Injuries and violence: the facts. Geneva, WHO, 2010; http://libdoc.who.int/publications/2010/9789241599375_eng.pdf ). Trauma-induced injury is the leading cause of death for young patients up to the age of 45 years ( www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db65.pdf ) [ ]. Part of the early mortality associated with trauma can be directly related to trauma, e.g., severe head injury. The trauma-induced proinflammatory reaction called systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is associated with the late mortality [ ], occurring in up to 90 %. Depending on the severity of SIRS, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) frequently ensues [ ] and can lead to fatal multiple organ failure (MOF). Along with the proinflammatory SIRS, a counter-inflammatory mechanism takes place following injury, which is called compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome (CARS) [ ]. CARS is associated with a reduced activity of antigen-presenting cells (APCs), anergy of T cells and an imbalance of the Th1/Th2—response. The consequence of the above-mentioned CARS can be an increased risk of infection and complications [ ]. In 1995, Moore and Moore described this as the two-hit model: Trauma with subsequent SIRS resembles a first hit, often followed by a second hit, e.g., due to surgery or infection, leading patients to be more vulnerable to complications such as MOF [ ].
CD4+ T regulatory cells (Tregs) have been described first by Sakaguchi, who showed that Tregs are able to suppress immune responses [ ]. The transcription factor forkhead box P3 (FoxP3) was identified essential for CD4+ Treg function and identification [ ]. Recent findings defined CD4+ Tregs as key players in trauma-induced immune perturbation [ ], and they are considered protective following trauma. Previously, the kinetics, type and location of CD4+ Treg activation following trauma were described using a novel technique called phospho-flow cytometry [ ]. The mechanisms of CD4+ Treg activation following trauma still remain unclear. The emerging role of platelets in immunology made us hypothesize that platelets influence CD4+ Tregs following trauma. Platelets are mostly associated with hemostatic functions despite their immunologic potential [ ]. Platelets are able to produce inflammatory mediators (e.g., RANTES, IL-1β) to release effector molecules, which are chemoattractants for macrophages, lymphocytes and neutrophils [ ], and also to modulate the activation of dendritic cells [ ]. The detection of CD40 [ ] and CD40L on the surface of platelets [ ], which enables them to directly induce B cells to produce IgG, was the most crucial hint to consider platelets to be part of the immune system. Platelets can enhance T cell responses and express functional Toll-like receptors (TLRs) [ , ]. Platelets immediately respond to pathologic surroundings within septic patients [ ]. A reduced amount of circulating platelets goes in with an increased mortality, in humans [ ] and in rodent trauma models [ ]. Platelet–neutrophil interactions have been described [ , ], and recent studies investigated the potential interaction of platelets and CD4+ T cells. Reciprocal activation could be shown in the setting of liver ischemia–reperfusion [ ], platelets modulate CD4+ T cells in atherosclerosis [ ], and platelets were shown to differentially regulate CD4+ T cell proliferation [ ]. Interestingly, CD4+ Tregs have been shown to have similar characteristics—they constantly sense the environment and quickly react to environmental changes [ ].
This study uses the murine burn injury model to test the hypothesis that platelets and CD4+ Tregs interact following burn injury. Potential interactions between platelets and CD4+ T cells have been described in other models, but it remains unclear whether platelets interact with the CD4+ T cell subpopulation Tregs in the setting of injury. This is of special importance, as CD4+ Treg activation has been described to be protective following injury. Platelets could be potential amplifiers of the protective role of CD4+ Tregs following trauma. The findings reported here indicate that platelets indeed augment the activation of CD4+ Tregs following trauma. Interestingly, reciprocal interference could be detected. CD4+ Tregs influence platelet-induced hemostasis, but do not alter the immunologic activation of platelets. Hence, our studies for the first time suggest reciprocal activation of CD4+ Tregs and platelets following trauma. The functional importance of the findings is underlined by the unique immunosuppressive capacity of CD4+ Tregs following trauma.
Materials and methods
Animals
Male C57BL/6N mice (22–26 g) from Charles River Laboratories (Sulzfeld, Germany) were acclimatized (1 week) and maintained in the Center for Preclinical Studies ( ZPF ) of Klinikum rechts der Isar , Munich, Germany. Full supply (standardized feeding/water, controlled temperature and humidity) and 12-h light/dark regimen were guaranteed in the virus antibody-free (VAF) animal facility. This study was carried out in strict accordance to the German legislation on protection of animals. The protocol was approved by the responsible Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of the Technical University Munich ( Regierung von Oberbayern , Munich, Germany, Permit Number: 55.2-1-54-2532-164-12). All surgery was performed under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering.
Reagents
Cell preparation was conducted in C5 culture medium: RPMI 1640 supplemented with MEM from GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp. (Piscataway, NJ), and penicillin/streptomycin, l -Glutamine 200 mM, HEPES buffer solution 1 M, 2-mercaptoethanol and 5 % FBS, from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Cell staining was performed in PBA buffer: PBS supplemented with albumin (bovine serum) and sodium azide, from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Cell fixation and permeabilization was done using diluted paraformaldehyde (PFA) and methanol, from Carl ROTH (Karlsruhe, Germany). Fc-block reagent (purified anti-mouse CD16/32) from BioLegend (San Diego, CA) prevented non-specific binding. Surface staining was conducted with anti-CD4, anti-CD44, anti-CD62L and anti-GITR mAb, from Miltenyi Biotec (Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Additional surface staining included anti-CD69 and anti-CD120b mAb (TNF-R Type II/p75), from BioLegend (San Diego, CA). For identifying FoxP3+ cells, we used anti-FoxP3 mAb from eBioscience (San Diego, CA). Primary antibodies included anti-ZAP-70 (99F2), anti-p-ZAP-70 (Tyr 493), anti-PKC-θ (P632) and anti-p-PKC-θ (Thr 538), all from CellSignaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Secondary antibody use of Alexa Fluor ® 555 conjugated F(ab)’2 fragment of goat anti-rabbit IgG ensured detection, from Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA). For the staining of platelets, we used anti-CD41, anti-CD289 (TLR9) and anti-CD62P mAb, from eBioscience (San Diego, CA), as well as anti-CD63 mAb from BioLegend (San Diego, CA, USA). Positive controls were conducted using purified anti-mouse CD3ε from BioLegend (San Diego, CA) for immune cells and thrombin (100 U/ml) from Baxter (Deerfield, IL) for platelets.
Burn injury model
Mice were anesthetized by i.p. ketamine/xylazine injection (200, 10 mg/kg). The dorsum was shaved, and mice were placed in a plastic mold exposing 25 % of the total body surface. Thermal injury by immersing the exposed part of the dorsum in a hot water bath (90 °C/9 s) induced third-degree burn. Sham-treated mice did not contact the hot water. Mice were resuscitated by i.p. injection of 1 ml of 0.9 % saline after the treatment. Mice were randomized for the experimental groups ( n = 6) according to the ARRIVE recommendations [ ]. Mice randomized for acute experiments remained in narcosis and were euthanized after 2 h. Mice randomized for 7 days experiments received s.c. buprenorphine analgesia (0.1 mg/kg) every 8 h for the first 3 days. The mortality from burn injury was <5 %.
Experimental protocols
In a first set of experiments, we investigated whether platelets influence posttraumatic CD4+ Treg activation. For in vivo depletion of platelets, rabbit anti-mouse platelet polyclonal immunoglobulin from Accurate Chemical & Scientific Corporation (Westbury, NY) (i.p. injection, 2.5 mg/kg) was given once 2 h prior to intervention. The control group received the isotype control. In a second set of experiments, we investigated whether CD4+ Tregs influence posttraumatic platelet activation. In vivo depletion of CD4+ Tregs was done using anti-CD25 antibody, clone PC-61, from BioXCell (West Lebanon, NH). Mice were treated once 72 h prior to intervention (0.25 mg, i.p. application). The isotype control was applied in the control group.
Blood, lymph node and spleen cell preparation
Mice were euthanized by CO 2 asphyxiation 2 h or 7 days after burn injury or sham treatment, and the draining inguinal, axillary and brachial lymph nodes and the spleens were harvested. Blood was collected by cardiac puncturing using a 14-gauge needle with a syringe containing 3.1 % trisodium citrate (blood/citrate ratio 10:1). Harvested organs were strained in C5 using stainless steel meshes and sieves with 70 µm pores. The cell suspension was plated on 96-well plates at 5 × 10 5 cells/well for staining and fixed with 0.15 % PFA.
Flow cytometry
After washing with PBA, fixed cells were permeabilized with ice-cold methanol (10 min). Fc-block was added. Staining antibodies, APC-labeled anti-CD4 and FITC-labeled anti-FoxP3, were added to identify CD4+ FoxP3+ Treg cells. Early cell activation (2 h) was assessed measuring expression and phosphorylation of T cell receptor (TCR) signaling molecules using phospho-flow cytometry. Cells were incubated with one of the following rabbit anti-mouse primary antibodies: anti-ZAP-70, anti-p-ZAP-70, anti-PKC-θ and anti-p-PKC-θ. After washing, Alexa Fluor ® 555-labeled secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG (F(ab)’2 fragment) was added (30 min). Negative controls were generated staining without the primary Ab. Cells were fixed with 0.3 % PFA, washed and reconstituted in PBS for analysis. Late cell activation (7 days) was assessed using conventional flow cytometry. CD4+ Treg identification was done using APC-labeled anti-CD4 and FITC-labeled anti-FoxP3. Surface-staining antibodies for detection of activation included anti-CD44, anti-CD69, anti-CD62L, anti-GITR and anti-TNF-RII (all PE-labeled). Following washing, cells were fixed with 0.3 % PFA. For platelet staining, 100 µl full blood was fixed with 1 % PFA and washed. Platelets were stained using eFluor ® 450-labeled anti-CD41 for identification and FITC-labeled anti-CD289 (TLR9), APC-labeled anti-CD62P and PE-labeled anti-CD63 for visualizing platelet activity. Lysis was performed after staining. Stained platelets were resuspended with PBS for immediate analysis. Phospho-flow and conventional flow cytometry was conducted using MACSQuant ® from Miltenyi Biotec (Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Calibration of the machine was done each time using beads from Miltenyi Biotec (Bergisch Gladbach, Germany).
Thromboelastometry
Thromboelastometry analysis was performed using ROTEM ® delta from TEM International GmbH (Munich, Germany). Due to limited blood amounts, ROTEM Cup&Pin mini Set from TEM International GmbH (Munich, Germany) was used. A total of 7 µl of Star-tem ® for re-calcification and 7 µl of ex-tem ® reagent were added to 105 µl of full blood. The analyzed ROTEM ® parameters are clot formation time (CFT), alpha angle and maximum clot firmness (MCF). CFT defines the time until a pre-defined clot firmness (20 mm in the amplitude). The alpha angle defines the angle of the tangent at a 2 mm width of the coagulation graph. Clot firmness is visualized by the width of the graph. The width measured at pre-defined points is called A5 to 30 (depending on the minutes), and the maximum width is called MCF.
Statistics
ANOVA on ranks followed by Kruskal–Wallis test and Dunn’s for multiple comparison testing was applied using GraphPad Prism Software version 6.05 from GraphPad Software, Inc. (La Jolla, CA). Median ± Q1 and Q3 values are given for box plots; otherwise, mean values ± SEM are given. p < 0.05 was considered significant.
Results
Trauma induces early activation of CD4+ Tregs, but not of CD4+ non-Tregs
We applied phospho-flow cytometry to analyze the early expression and phosphorylation of primary TCR signaling molecules, as described before [ , ]. Following TCR activation, the ζ-associated protein of 70 kDa (ZAP-70) is recruited to the TCR/CD3 complex. Protein kinase C-θ (PKC-θ) is part of NF-κB-dependent TCR signaling [ ]. PKC-θ activation is enhanced by CD28-B7 ligation [ ], and it plays a role in regulating negative feedback within Tregs. Flow cytometry gating for CD4+ FoxP3+ cells allowed for identification of CD4+ Tregs [ ]. This allowed for direct comparison of CD4+ Tregs (small population) with CD4+ non-Tregs (large population). In contrast to large populations, biologically significant changes in signaling molecules may not be statistically significant in small populations because of flow cytometry-associated measurement variability. We were pleased to find a significant activation of signaling molecules in CD4+ Tregs, but not in CD4+ non-Tregs, 2 h following burn injury (Fig. 1 ). This effect is limited to draining lymph nodes. We detected a higher overall expression of signaling molecules in CD4+ Tregs as compared to CD4+ non-Tregs. Fig. 1 Early activation of CD4+ Tregs, but not of CD4+ non-Tregs, following trauma
Using phospho-flow cytometry, the intracellular expression and phosphorylation of ZAP-70 and PKC-θ was analyzed as a measure of CD4+ Treg and CD4+ non-Treg activation 2 h following trauma-induced injury in mice. Injury leads to activation of CD4+ Tregs, but not of CD4+ non-Tregs. This effect is limited to cells from the lymph nodes and cannot be observed in cells derived from the spleen. The constitutive expression of ZAP-70 and PKC-θ is higher in CD4+ Tregs as compared to non-Tregs. Median ± Q1 and Q3, n = 6 each group, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
Platelet depletion leads to disruption of early CD4+ Treg activation following trauma
A biologically significant increase in the activation of ZAP-70 and PKC-θ was detected in CD4+ Tregs derived from lymph nodes 2 h following burn injury (PLT-control) (Fig. 2 ). Platelet depletion (PLT-depletion) leads to disruption of posttraumatic activation of CD4+ Tregs. Of special interest is the additional observation that platelet depletion was even associated with a diminished expression and phosphorylation of signaling molecules following burn injury as compared to the control group. This effect could be observed for ZAP-70 and PKC-θ. In the spleen, we did not observe pronounced posttraumatic activation of CD4+ Tregs in mice treated with isotype control antibodies. Nevertheless, platelet depletion was associated with a significant decrease in the expression and phosphorylation of signaling molecules following burn injury as compared to sham-treated animals. Fig. 2 Platelets modulate early CD4+ Treg activation following trauma
Intracellular activation of CD4+ Tregs was analyzed using phospho-flow cytometry. Expression and phosphorylation of ZAP-70 and PKC-θ is increased 2 h following burn injury in mice treated with isotype control antibody (PLT-control). Depletion of platelets (PLT-Depletion) leads to disruption of trauma-induced CD4+ Treg activation in mice. Median ± Q1 and Q3, n = 6 each group, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
Platelet depletion does not affect late CD4+ Tregs activation following burn injury
We examined the cell surface markers CD44, CD69, CD62L, GITR and TNF-RII to measure late activation of the CD4+ Tregs. Within lymph nodes, we could not see any significant differences in the expression of the activation markers (Fig. 3 ). Depletion of platelets did not have an effect on the activation of CD4+ Tregs 7 days following trauma. Similar results were found for CD4+ Tregs derived from the spleen. Fig. 3 Platelets do not modulate late CD4+ Treg activation following trauma
The expression of common CD4+ Treg activation markers (CD44, CD69, CD62L, GITR, TNF–RII) was measured to investigate activation of CD4+ Tregs 7 days following trauma. Trauma did not induce significant late activation of CD4+ Tregs in lymph nodes or the spleen. No differences could be detected in cells derived from mice pretreated with platelet-depleting antibody (PLT-Depletion). Median ± Q1 and Q3, n = 6 each group.
CD4+ Tregs influence platelet-mediated hemostasis early following trauma
We used thromboelastometry (ROTEM ® delta) to assess the effect of CD4+ Tregs on hemostasis following trauma. CD4+ Tregs tend to affect clotting early (2 h) following trauma. No significant differences could be detected in the CFT, the alpha angle and the clot firmness following burn injury as compared to sham treatment in mice pretreated with the control Ab (Fig. 4 a–c). While CFT and alpha angle do not show significant changes following CD4+ Treg depletion, CD4+ Tregs influence the clot firmness early following trauma. In mice pretreated with CD4+ Treg-depleting antibody, clot firmness was diminished (Fig. 4 d) as compared to the control experiment (Fig. 4 c). CD4+ Tregs do not affect clotting late (7 days) following trauma. As compared to early time points, signs of hypercoagulation can be detected late following trauma. Burn injury-induced reduction of CFT and the increase in the alpha angle are more pronounced as compared to the sham group (Fig. 4 e, f). Additionally, clot firmness is higher 7 days following burn injury as compared to the sham group (Fig. 4 g). Our observation of hypercoagulation in mice 7 days following trauma does not seem to be influenced by CD4+ Tregs (Fig. 4 e, f, h). Fig. 4 CD4+ Tregs modulate early coagulation following trauma
Thromboelastometry (ROTEM ® analysis) was used to assess early and late effects of CD4+ Tregs on platelet-mediated hemostasis. Burn injury did not induce significant changes in the CFT (clot formation time), the alpha angle or the clot firmness (Fig. 4 a, c, e). Treatment with CD4+ Treg-depleting antibody induced reduced clot firmness (4 days) early following trauma-induced injury. In contrast to early effects, CD4+ Tregs did not affect late clotting. Signs of hypercoagulation are present late following trauma. Median ± Q1 and Q3 (Fig. 4 a, b, e, f), Mean ± SEM (Fig. 4 c, d, g, h), n = 6 each group, * p < 0.05.
CD4+ Tregs do not influence CD62P, CD63 and TLR-9 expression on platelets early and late following trauma
In contrast to affecting posttraumatic hemostasis, CD4+ Tregs do not influence the posttraumatic expression of surface molecules on platelets (Fig. 5 ). We chose to stain CD62P (P-selectin), CD63 and TLR-9 as activation markers for alpha-, electron dense- and T-granules [ ]. Early after trauma, we could not detect any posttraumatic differences in the expression of any of these surface markers following CD4+ Treg depletion as compared to control treatment. Similar findings could be reported late after trauma. We interpret the detected lower levels of CD63 following burn injury in depleted mice as compared to non-depleted mice to be caused by the presence of an outlier. Fig. 5 CD4+ Tregs do not modulate expression of activation markers of platelets following trauma
The expression of activation markers CD62, CD63, and TLR-9 was analyzed on platelets 7 days following trauma. Trauma-induced injury did not change the late expression of platelet activation markers, irrespective of CD4+ Treg depletion. Median ± Q1 and Q3, n = 6 each group.
Discussion
Interactions of platelets and CD4+ T cells have been described in the post-ischemic liver, in atherosclerosis and other settings [ , ]. Here, we tested the hypothesis that platelets interact with CD4+ Tregs following trauma. In previous studies, CD4+ Tregs have been described to exert protective effects following trauma. It is therefore of high interest to understand whether platelets amplify the protective role of CD4+ Tregs following trauma. Of special interest are the kinetics of a potential interaction between CD4+ Tregs and platelets following trauma and whether reciprocal activation is taking place.
CD4+ Tregs are selectively and rapidly activated following trauma
In previous studies we showed that CD4+ Tregs, but not CD4+ non-Tregs, are rapidly activated following trauma [ ]. Our current findings extend the findings of our previous study. Here, we demonstrate that CD4+ Tregs, even in the absence of trauma, have higher constitutive levels of intracellular signaling molecules. This seems to make them ready to react quickly and is in line with the findings of Matarese and coworkers [ ]. In addition, the activation of CD4+ Tregs is limited to the lymph nodes. This finding points to the special role of CD4+ Tregs. They are considered to be the natural element of host response to injuries [ ]. This host response starts locally at the site of injury. So far, the activation mechanisms for CD4+ Tregs in this setting are not fully understood. The current concept of CD4+ Treg activation following injury involves the posttraumatic release of alarmins and self-antigens [ ]. We used the analysis of phosphorylation and expression of TCR signaling molecules as a tool to measure rapid CD4+ Treg activation. This allowed for screening analysis of cell activation. A secondary finding of the method used is that TCR signaling molecules of CD4+ Tregs are being activated. This supports the hypothesis that self-antigens are exposed following trauma, leading to activation of the immune system.
Platelets modulate the activation of CD4+ Tregs early following trauma
Driven by the hypothesis that platelets interact with CD4+ Tregs following trauma, we performed experiments in platelet-depleted mice. We chose the burn injury model, described by Stieritz and Holder [ ] and modified by Hamood [ ] to obtain reproducible trauma. The model has proved to evoke sufficient immune disturbances while being associated with a mortality rate of 5–10 %. Platelet depletion using platelet polyclonal immunoglobulin yielded a reduction in platelet counts of >90 %. Mortality of mice was not significantly increased following burn injury and sham intervention.
Here, we were able to demonstrate for the first time that platelets augment CD4+ Treg activation early following trauma. This effect is limited to the lymph nodes and cannot be observed in the spleen. Findings in cells derived from the spleen suggest platelets to be involved in the maintenance of CD4+ Treg idle activation. Burn injury does not lead to significant CD4+ Treg activation in cells derived from the spleen, and platelet depletion is nevertheless associated with a marked decrease in CD4+ Treg activation. Recent studies highlighted the immunologic protective role of platelets in trauma. The absence of platelets following trauma has been associated with higher morbidity following burn injury in mice [ ]. Thrombocytopenia due to blood loss and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) leads to disadvantageous outcomes in multiply injured patients [ ]. Basic concepts to explain the protective role of platelet following trauma were rudimentary so far.
Our results suggest a mechanism of the protective role of platelets in the setting of trauma. Platelets are interlaced in the immunosuppressive host response of CD4+ Tregs to trauma-induced injury, and they support the activation of CD4+ Tregs at the site of injury. Our results contribute to the controversial discussion of the role of platelets following trauma and sepsis. Platelets are commonly known for their hemostatic and proinflammatory potential. Their hemostatic potential significantly contributes to organ failure via thrombotic microangiopathy and disseminated intravascular coagulation [ ]. In the presence of antiplatelet drugs, proinflammatory responses such as C-reactive protein release are dampened [ ]. Due to their wide repertoire of proinflammatory mediators, platelets have commonly been described as sentinels of the immune system [ ]. The described interactions of platelets and CD4+ Tregs following trauma encourage us to hypothesize that platelets are actively involved in the regulation of local immune responses. Interestingly, the early immunomodulatory activity of platelets following trauma does not seem to induce long-lasting effects. CD4+ Treg activation, as measured by expression of CD44, CD69, CD62L, GITR and TNF-R II, is unchanged in the platelet-depleted group 7 days following injury. The mentioned observation has to be interpreted cautiously due to the experimental setup. Platelet depletion was conducted once prior to the induction of trauma or sham treatment, we did not maintain platelet depletion over the 7-day course of the experiment by repeating the application. Partial restoration of platelet counts could not be assessed in the murine model, as repetitive blood drawing is not possible. It has to be assumed though that a crosstalk between platelets and CD4+ Tregs late following trauma might therefore be present. Nevertheless, while the absence of platelets at the time of trauma is associated with diminished CD4+ Treg activation early following trauma, sustainable effects of this early interaction seem to be absent. This underlines the proposed role of platelets following trauma, as they seem to be fast-reacting sentinels with an immunomodulatory capability.
CD4+ Tregs influence platelet-mediated posttraumatic hemostasis
In order to avoid shifted immune cell compositions and immune cell responses due to autoimmune events [ ], we decided to use the well-established antibody-mediated depletion of CD4+ Tregs instead of using knock-out mice [ , ]. Currently, CD25 is the most specific marker for autoimmune-preventive CD4+ Tregs [ ]. Caveat to the chosen antibody depletion strategy is the occurrence of CD25 on other activated CD4+ T cells [ ]. In addition, antibody-mediated depletion does not yield 100 % depletion of CD4+ Tregs. Condoning these limitations, we were pleased to identify effects of CD4+ Treg depletion on hemostasis following trauma. CD4+ Tregs influence clotting firmness early following trauma. Our observation is the first to demonstrate reciprocal interaction between CD4+ Tregs and platelets. At this point, we can only speculate about the mechanisms of the newly described interaction. It has been recognized that CD4+ Tregs exert effects via soluble factors and via cell–cell contact. Current studies nourish the concept of direct interaction via cell–cell contact. In a clinical study investigating platelet function in 47 septic patients, a shift in platelet function was described [ ]. Following trauma, platelets show decreased aggregability but preserved expression of adhesion molecules. The concept of direct interaction between CD4+ Tregs and platelets underlines the degree of control in the host response to injury. It will be part of further studies to investigate the mechanisms of interaction between CD4+ Tregs and platelets following trauma. Again, only early effects of CD4+ Treg and platelet interaction could be demonstrated. This might be attributed to the fact that platelets are missing a nucleus and therefore by default can only react for a short time. Once exhausted following trauma, renewal of platelet populations might lead to disruption of cell–cell interaction, given the assumption that renewed platelets are missing the early specific activation following trauma.
In addition to analyzing changes in platelet-mediated hemostasis following trauma, the expression of CD62-P, CD63 and TLR-9 was investigated. Having demonstrated modulation of platelet aggregation by CD4+ Tregs following trauma, we were surprised to find no detectable significant differences in the early or late expression of the activation markers on platelets in dependence of CD4+ Tregs. This dichotomic observation might be truly based on a specifically directed modulation of platelet-mediated hemostasis by CD4+ Tregs. The fact that platelets are missing a nucleus and therefore only react for a short time might be explanatory. Due to the missing capability of remodeling, CD4+ Tregs might not be able to change the expression of adhesion or activation molecules on platelets. Of note Yaguchi and coworkers observed a shift in platelet function but could not detect elevated expression of activation markers on platelets in septic patients [ ].
Conclusions
In conclusion, here we describe reciprocal activation of CD4+ Tregs and platelets following trauma for the first time. Platelets modulate the immunologic host response to trauma-induced injury by augmenting the activation of CD4+ Tregs. Our observation is of utmost importance, as CD4+ Tregs have been identified as key players of CARS following trauma, they are considered protective. Our data support the concept of platelets as sentinels, and they are able to rapidly and locally modulate the immune response following trauma. Interaction between CD4+ Tregs and platelets is bidirectional, and CD4+ Tregs are capable of modulating the hemostatic function of platelets. The posttraumatic interplay of CD4+ Tregs and platelets might not only be a suitable clinical target for the development of immunomodulatory drugs following trauma, but also a tool for immunosurveillance following trauma. Furthermore, the finding that platelets modulate the posttraumatic protective immune response of CD4+ Tregs might be reason to reevaluate the criteria for therapeutic platelet transfusion in critically ill patients.
