INTRODUCTION
Over the last few years, a hybrid vesicle made of phospholipid and block copolymer is emerging as a versatile platform for comprehensive biomedical applications ( ). Phospholipids or block copolymer molecules can independently assemble into vesicular systems leading to formation of liposomes or polymersomes, respectively. Phospholipids being GRAS (generally regarded as safe) in status offer an exceptional biocompatibility though poor colloidal and mechanical stability of prepared vesicles (liposomes) limits their application. On the other hand, though, polymersomes provide an excellent robustness and colloidal stability suffers from poor permeability and variation in drug release behavior ( ). Thus, both the phospholipid and block copolymer as vesicle-forming agent own some advantages and limitations. In order to mitigate limitations and exploit the advantage of each system (liposome and polymersome), an integrated approach of mixing phospholipid and block copolymer has been recently studied by few researchers ( , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ). These so-called hybrid vesicles open new scaffold in designing the systems with tailored morphology and physicochemical attributes. Nevertheless, current literature shows only limited work on the subject and there is scarcity of information especially regarding microstructural, rheological, and stabilization aspects of hybrid vesicles. Besides, as described in our earlier research work ( , ), processing parameters exert a significant effect on the microstructural and molecular aspects of the hybrid carrier. This imposes a huge challenge on the formulator for mechanistic understandings of these processes as they may affect subsequent rheology, release, and stability of the hybrid system. Thus far, the various block copolymers used in the hybrid vesicles include poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), poly(butadiene) (PBut), poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL), or poly(isobutylene) (PIB), as hydrophobic block while poly(2-methyloxazoline) (PMOXA) or poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) were chosen as the hydrophilic blocks ( , ). Moreover, as described in literature, most of the hybrid vesicles were achieved through stirring ( ), vortexing ( ), electroformation ( , ), film hydration, and extrusion ( , ). It should also be noted that use of these methods rarely resulted into hybrid vesicles of around 100 nm ( ). In this work, we envisaged the use of acrylate/C10-C30 alkyl acrylate copolymer on the formation and stabilization of phospholipid-based vesicles.
Ultrasound cavitation is an energy-efficient technique for creation of nanomaterial for diverse technological applications ( ). Cavitation technology in combination with high shear was thought to be a viable option to produce proposed NHV, as routine methods such as high-pressure homogenization (HPH) and microfluidization are generally associated with few drawbacks. This includes higher cost of the said instruments; temperature induced degradation of active and/or the carrier lipid, increase in particle size with the increase in number of cycle and pressure as a result of increased kinetic energy of the system, and possible destruction of microstructure of the system under high mechanical stress ( , ). Also, it should be noted that with an ultrasound cavitation, it is possible to critically control operating parameters like power (W) and processing time.
Indomethacin (IND) is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) useful in the treatment of pain, swelling, gout, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis ( ). Nevertheless, as a non-selective cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2) inhibitor, an oral delivery of IND often results in several adverse effects such as ulceration of GI mucosa, perforations, and GI bleeding ( ). Hence, in this work, we investigated the feasibility of designed NHV for nasal delivery IND that can be beneficial for the management of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. In this regard, IND is believed to provide a required neuroprotection by binding to amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) and thereby modulating γ-secretase leading to decrease in amyloid-β peptide (Aβ42) and increase in generation of Aβ38 fragments ( , ). Besides, IND is known to exist in three different forms namely metastable (γ-form), stable (α-form), and an amorphous form. Several studies ( , , , ) report crystallization and polymorphic behavior of IND as such or when confined to carrier system. Taken in to account chemical nature of IND (Fig. 1 ), it should be realized that IND comprises one H-bond donor namely hydroxyl (–OH) of the carboxylic acid group, and four H-bond acceptors namely carbonyl (C=O) in carboxylic acid, the OH of carboxylic acid, the C=O group of the tertiary amide, and the methoxy oxygen. Thus, the presence of both (proton donor and acceptor) makes IND a favorable candidate to investigate possible intermolecular hydrogen bonding during processing. Hence, we used IND as a model lipophilic (BCS class II, pka 4.5) drug in this work. On the other hand, the both used lecithin (Phospholipon (PL) 90G) and polymer (acrylates/C10-C30 alkyl acrylate) possess a hydrophilic region (phosphate group for lecithin and PAA chains for polymer) and a hydrophobic region (hydrocarbon chain for lecithin and methacrylate unit for polymer). Thus, an amphipathic nature of both was thought significant to reduce interfacial tension while the steric constraints of polymer ( ) could auger well for colloidal stability.

Response surface methodology (RSM) utilizes collection of mathematical and statistical techniques centered on the fit of a polynomial equation to the experimental data, describing the behavior of a dataset to make statistical previsions ( , ). RSM is particularly important to attain the best system performance when a response or a set of responses are influenced by several variables. To design NHV and to further establish the functional relationships between operating variables and the studied responses, we considered RSM based on central composite design (CCD). The obtained data was analyzed by second-order polynomial, and the adequacy of regression model was assessed through analysis of variance (ANOVA) and diagnostic residuals.
EXPERIMENTAL
Materials
IND (γ-polymorph; molar mass 357.78 g/mol, Tm = 161.0 °C) was obtained from Liben Pharmaceuticals Limited, Akola, India. PL-90G was a kind gift from Lipoid, Phospholipid GmbH (Nattermannallee, Koln, Germany). Acrylate/C10-C30 alkyl acrylate copolymer (Pemulen TR-1) was a generous gift of Lubrizol Advanced Materials (India Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai, India). Span 80 (HLB, 4.3) and ethanol were purchased from Merck Limited, Mumbai, India. A cellophane membrane (mwc ≈ 12,000–14,000 Da) was purchased from HI media Ltd., India. Double-distilled water (DDW) was used throughout the experiments.
Methods
Production of IND-NHV
IND-loaded NHVs were prepared by combination of high shear and cavitation technology ( ). Initially, phases A and B were prepared separately. Phase A was comprised of required amounts of PL-90G, span 80, and IND (Table I ) in ethanol (5 mL). Phase B was consisted of P TR-1 (0.2% w / v ) finely dispersed in DDW (20 mL) using Teflon-coated magnetic bead. Phase B was added slowly to phase A and processed under high shear using Ultra-turrax (Cole Parmer, Mumbai) at 8000 rpm. The resultant mixture was further subjected to an ultrasonic horn (PCI Analytics, Mumbai) with varied power (20–90 W) and sonication time (1–10 min) at 5 s on off cycle.

Experimental Design
To determine optimal conditions for the production of NHV, we used CCD. The design matrix was composed of total 17 runs including 8 factorial points (± 1), 6 axial points (± 1.68), and 3 center points (0) (Table I ). Amount of PL-90G ( X 1 ), power of ultrasound ( X 2 ), and sonication time ( X 3 ) were selected as three independent variables. Each independent variable was investigated at five different levels as relatively low (− 1.68), low (− 1), basal (0), high (+ 1), and relatively high (+ 1.68). Z-Avg (Y 1 ), polydispersity index (PDI) ( Y 2 ), and zeta potential ( Y 3 ) were selected as dependent response variables.
Data Analysis and Validation of Optimization Model
We used STATISTICA version 8 (StatSoft, Inc., USA) for the RSM computations of current optimization. The experimental data was analyzed by multiple regression and fitted to second-order polynomial (Eq. ( 1 )). $$ Y={\ss}_0+{\ss}_1{X}_1+{\ss}_2{X}_2+{\ss}_3{X}_3+{\ss}_{11}{X_1}^2+{\ss}_{22}{X_2}^2+{\ss}_{33}{X_3}^2+{\ss}_{12}{X}_1{X}_2+{\ss}_{13}{X}_1{X}_3+{\ss}_{23}{X}_2{X}_3 $$ (1)
The predicted response ( Y ) was correlated to the regression coefficients ( β ) including linear ( β 1 , β 2 , β 3 ), quadratic ( β 11 , β 22 , β 33 ), and the interaction ( β 12 , β 13 , β 23 ) terms. The adequacy of fitted model was achieved through various statistical parameters including ANOVA, t-statistics, Pareto analysis, and diagnostic residuals. Besides, response surfaces and normal probability plots were investigated for each fitted response while the statistical significance was set to p < 0.05.
% Drug Recovery
The amount of IND recovered from NHV (batches S3, S5, S6, and S10) was determined upon rupturing the vesicles with Triton X-100 as described by Song et al. ( ), and using HPLC (Younglin, S.K Gradient System) with UV 730 D detector and SP930 D pump. The chromatographic specifications and linearity is provided in supplementary data ( Appendix A ). The percent recovery of IND was calculated using Eq. ( 2 ). $$ \mathrm{Recovery}\ \left(\%\right)=\left( Qt/ Qi\right)\times 100 $$ (2) where Qt is the total amount of IND in NHV and Qi is the initial amount of IND.
Characterization
Z-Avg and PDI Analysis
Z-Avg and the width of distribution of IND-NHV were determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS) using Zetasizer (Ver. 6.34, serial number MAL1074174, Malvern Instruments, UK). The samples were diluted appropriately with ultrapurified water prior to size and PDI measurements. The analysis was carried out at 25 °C using water as dispersant (RI 1.330, viscosity 0.8872 cp, dielectric constant 78.2).
Zeta Potential Analysis
Zeta potential of IND-NHV was determined by electrophoretic light scattering (ELS) using NanoPlus (Particulate Systems, Micromeritics Instrument Corporation). The samples were diluted appropriately (1:10) with the aqueous phase of formulation, and the zeta potential was determined. The surface charge on the IND-NHV was based on the electrophoretic mobility and determined by Helmholtz–Smoluchowski equation. The conductivity (mS/cm) and Doppler shift (Hz) were also investigated.
Transmission Electron Microscopy
To visualize the morphology of IND-NHV (batch S6), we used transmission electron microscope (CM-200, PHILIPS). A drop of dispersion was spread on a carbon-coated 200-mesh copper grid and subsequently stained with 2% uranyl acetate (UA) for 45 s. The grid was allowed to dry at room temperature to facilitate TEM imaging. The accelerating voltage used was 80 kV while the images are captured at magnification of × 40,000.
ATR-FTIR Analysis
In order to minimize the possible influence of the drying process on the microstructure of the designed IND-NHV, the analysis was carried out on an intact sample, i.e. , without transforming it to solid state. For the purpose, we used Cary 630 FTIR Spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, USA) based on attenuated total reflectance (ATR). The spectrum were obtained in ATR transmission mode at 32 sample scans, 32 background scans, 4/cm resolution, and Happ–Genzel apodization using diamond crystal. The analysis was carried out for pure IND, PL-90G, P-TR-1, span 80, and IND-NHV batches, viz. , S3, S5, S6, and S10.
Rheological Investigation
Rheological characterization of IND-NHV was performed by rheometer (Stress-Tech, Reologica, Sweden) equipped with cone-plate geometry (cone angle 1° and the gap 0.200 mm). The oscillatory measurements (stress and frequency sweep) was made to investigate viscoelastic properties of designed hybrid vesicles. The stress sweep was conducted at constant frequency of 1 Hz by varying the stress from 0.01 to 100 Pa. The frequency sweep was conducted at constant stress amplitude within linear viscoelastic region (LVR) by varying frequency from 1 to 70 Hz. Additionally, an investigation was also made on complex viscosity (η*) to ascertain flow behavior of designed NHV .
In vitro Release and Release Kinetic Study
The in vitro drug release profile of an optimized IND-NHV (S6) and pure drug suspension was studied by dialysis bag method ( ). Here, we used cellophane (12000–14,000 Da) as synthetic membrane, which was previously soaked in double-distilled water for 12 h. The dialysis bag containing IND-NHV (1 mL) was immersed in 200 mL phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). The experiment was carried out at 37 °C while the rotation of dialysis bag was maintained at 50 rpm. At predetermined time intervals, samples (1 mL) were withdrawn and replaced with equal volume of fresh medium. The concentration of IND in the aliquots was determined by HPLC (Younglin, S.K Gradient System). The release data was fitted to various kinetic models such as Korsmeyer–Peppas, Hixson–Crowell, zero order, first order, and Higuchi– Matrix as described in our earlier work ( ).
Ex vivo Permeation Studies Using Sheep Nasal Mucosa
Preparation of Mucosa and Permeation Study
The ex vivo permeation study of IND-NHV was carried out on nasal mucosa of Ovis aries (an Indian sheep), aged 6–8 months and of 25 ± 5 kg. The freshly excised nasal mucosa was obtained from a local slaughter house. Immediately upon collection, the mucosa was made free from adhered tissues and immersed in ice-cold phosphate buffer saline pH 6.4. The mucosal specimen having thickness 0.12 cm and effective surface area 3.14 cm 2 was mounted in vertical jacketed Franz diffusion cell ( ) with mucosal surface facing the donor chamber and serosal side facing the receptor chamber. Both sides of the nasal mucosa were filled with the 15 mL of simulated nasal electrolyte solution (SNES). The SNES solution was made of NaCl (7.45 mg/mL), KCl (1.29 mg/mL), and CaCl 2 .2H 2 O (0.32 mg/mL). To ensure oxygenation and agitation, a mixture of 95% O 2 and 5% CO 2 was bubbled through the system. The preincubation time period of 15 min was used to reach 34 °C and electrophysiological equilibrium. NHV and pure drug suspension (equivalent to 2 mg of IND) was placed in the donor chamber. At predetermined time points, 1 mL samples were withdrawn from the acceptor compartment, replacing with an equal volume of SNES solution, for a period of 12 h. The samples withdrawn were filtered (Millipore® 0.45 μm), and the amount of permeated drug was determined using HPLC.
Analysis of Permeation Data
To determine the permeability characteristics of IND, the ex vivo nasal mucosal permeation data was fitted to Fick’s second law of diffusion (Eq. ( 3 )) for a single-layer membrane. $$ {Q}_T={C}_d.(KL)\left\{\frac{D}{L^2}t-\frac{1}{6}-2/{\pi}^2\sum \limits_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{{\left(-1\right)}^n}{n^2}.\mathit{\exp}\left(-\frac{D}{L^2}.{n}^2.{\pi}^2.t\right)\right\} $$ (3) where Q T is the cumulative quantity of IND permeated through the nasal mucosa as a function of time ( , ). Cd is the initial total donor chamber concentration of IND (2 mg). The drug flux at steady state ( J ss , μg/cm 2 /h), apparent permeability coefficient ( P app , cm/h), and steady state diffusion coefficient (D) were determined using Eqs. ( 4 – 6 ), respectively. $$ {J}_{ss}=\Delta {Q}_t/\Delta t\times S $$ (4) $$ {P}_{app}={J}_{ss}/{C}_d $$ (5) $$ D={P}_{app}\times L/K $$ (6)
where Δ Q t / S is the cumulative drug permeation per unit of mucosal surface area (μg/cm 2 ), t is the time in hours, K is the partition coefficient of the drug, and L is the diffusion path length.
Histopathological Evaluation of Mucosa
The mucosa utilized for an ex vivo permeation studies was further evaluated histopathologically to ascertain pathological changes occurring in cell morphology and tissue organization. For the evaluation, we used untreated mucosa as negative control while mucosa treated with isopropyl alcohol served as a positive control. The mucosal tissue was fixed in 10% formalin, routinely processed and embedded in paraffin. The paraffin sections were cut on glass slides and eventually stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The sections were examined under a light microscope, to detect any damage to the tissue during ex vivo permeation, by a pathologist blinded to the study ( ).
Stability Study
The stability of IND - loaded NHV (S6) was carried out in triplicate for the period of 90 days. The samples were incubated at two different storage conditions of 4–8 °C and 25 °C/60% RH, and subsequently analyzed by DLS and ELS techniques. Z-Avg (nm), PDI, and the zeta potential (ζ, mV) were the evaluated parameters for stability of vesicles.
RESULT AND DISCUSSION
Preliminarily, the optimum formulation and processing conditions were established to obtain stable and aggregation free vesicles. The amount of lecithin (PL-90G), power of ultrasound, and the processing time being crucial in the formation of NHV were selected as an independent operating variable and studied as a function of Z-Avg (nm), PDI, and zeta potential (mV) using CCD. Table I depicts CCD with values of independent ( X ) and the response ( Y ) variables. IND-NHV (batches S3, S5, S6, and S10) had drug recovery within 92–98%.

The obtained statistical parameters (Table S1 ), residual analysis (Fig. S1 ), and correlation plots (Fig. S2 ) are given in supplementary data ( Appendix B ). As can been seen Fig. S1 (A, C and E) had bell-shaped, almost symmetrical histogram indicating normal distribution of errors with mean zero. The raw residuals plotted against the corresponding observations (run number), Fig. S1 (B, D and F), revealed random scattering about zero indicating a constant variance in error ( ). It is documented that the coefficient of determination ( R 2 ) is the measure of total variability explained by the model and for a good fitting R 2 should be close to 1 or at least 0.80 ( ). For response Y 1 , Y 2 , and Y 3 , the obtained R 2 were respectively 0.9433, 0.9709, and 0.9167. This strongly suggest that 94.33% variation in Z-Avg (nm), 97.09% variation in PDI, and 91.67% variation in zeta potential (mV) can be accounted by the fitted model. As well, we considered adjusted R 2 in evaluating the model adequacy as unlike coefficient of determination it decreases upon adding nonsignificant factor and can be adjusted as per the model size. Finally, the investigated correlation plots (Fig. S2 ; supplementary data, Appendix B) established a high degree of correlation ( R 2 > 0.90 ) between the observed and predicted responses substantiating the adequacy of fitted quadratic model.
Effect of Variables
Effect on Z-Avg
The Z-Avg of the studied IND-NHV varied from 80.58 to 440.3 nm (Table I ). Response surfaces (Fig. 2 ) assisted to better understand the relationship between independent variables and the studied responses. Figure 2 a, b respectively depicts the influence of an independent variables on the Z-Avg of drug-loaded NHV. The standardized effect estimates (absolute value) and the interaction effects are shown in Fig. S3 (A and B, supplementary data, Appendix B). The ANOVA results (Table II ) clearly showed the statistical significance ( p < 0.05) of linear ( X 1 and X 3 ), quadratic ( X 1 2 and X 2 2 ), and the interaction terms ( X 1 X 3 and X 2 X 3 ) on Z-Avg of IND-NHV. As confirmed through the significant ( p < 0.05) regression coefficients of X 1 and X 3 (Eq. ( 7 )), an increase in amount of lecithin increases vesicle size while marked decrease in size occurs with an increase in processing time. Moreover, the noted curvature in the surfaces (Fig. 2 a, b) indicated strong quadratic influence of power (W) and amount of lecithin on the formation of NHV. Also, as indicated by significant ( p < 0.05) negative regression coefficient of X 1 X 3 (Eq. ( 7 )), simultaneous increase in lecithin and processing time reduces the vesicle size. Figure 3 a, b respectively depicts DLS-derived size (d nm) distribution by intensity and number for the IND-NHV (S6). The Z-Avg was noted to be 80.58 nm, though as confirmed through Fig. S4 (supplementary data, Appendix B), most of particles spanned within 28.21 and 68.06 nm. Here, it should be realized that cavitation using power ultrasound exerts localized hydrodynamic shear ( ) that brings about prominent reduction in particle size, though colloidal dimensions of the particles and an increased kinetic energy might result in particle reagglomeration ( ). Hence, with optimum power and processing time, use of an appropriate stabilizer was thought significant to obtain desired size vesicles. In this regard, we chose span 80 (HLB 4.3) as it works synergistically with Pemulen polymer ( , ).

Effect on PDI
IND-NHV had PDI within 0.200 and 0.831 (Table I ). Figure 2 c, d respectively depicts the influence of an independent variables on the PDI of drug-loaded NHV. Standardized and interaction effect estimates are presented in Fig. S3 (C and D, supplementary data, Appendix B). The ANOVA results (Table III ) clearly demonstrated statistical significance ( p < 0.05) of linear ( X 1 and X 3 ), quadratic ( X 1 2 , X 2 2 , and X 3 2 ), and the interaction terms ( X 2 X 3 ) on PDI of IND-NHV. As indicated by significant ( p < 0.05) negative regression coefficient for X 2 2 (Eq. ( 8 )), power of ultrasound had profound quadratic influence on PDI of the vesicles. The sharp curvature in the fitted response (Fig. 2 d) clearly demonstrates quadratic relationship between the power and obtained PDI. The significant ( p < 0.05) decrease in PDI was also seen with an increase in amount of lecithin ( X 1 ) and processing time ( X 3 ). This was obvious as high concentration of lecithin would provide more surface coverage for the active at the interface, and with an optimum surfactant and processing time, it is feasible to obtain IND-NHV with narrow distribution. On the other hand, significant ( p < 0.05) positive regression coefficient of X 2 X 3 (Eq. ( 8 )) was suggestive of an increase in vesicle PDI with simultaneous increase in power and processing time. In this regard, possible aggregation of vesicles ( ) and an alteration in viscoelastic behavior at high power input was thought significant to influence PDI.
Effect on ZP
Zeta potential is a prime factor predicting the stability of colloidal dispersions. It is established that a high zeta potential (>|30| mV) prevents particle aggregation through electrostatic repulsion ( ). IND-NHV had zeta potential (ZP) within − 14 mV and − 43.26 mV (Table I ). Figure 2 e, f respectively depicts the influence of independent variables on the ZP of vesicle. The standardized effect estimates (absolute value) and interaction effects are summarized in Fig. S3 (E and F, supplementary data, Appendix B). The ANOVA results (Table IV ) shows the statistical significance ( p < 0.05) of linear ( X 2 ), quadratic ( X 1 2 , X 2 2 , and X 3 2 ), and the interaction terms ( X 1 X 3 and X 2 X 3 ) on ZP of vesicle. The steep curvature in the fitted response (Fig. 2 e, f) prominently reflects the quadratic influence of variables as confirmed through significant ( p < 0.05) negative regression coefficient of X 1 2 , X 2 2 , and X 3 2 in Eq. ( 9 ). Figure 4 depicts electro-osmosis stream (EOS) plot and mobility distribution of IND-NHV (S6) on the same day of its production and on the 90th day of storage. The vesicles had zeta potential and mobility of − 43.26 mV and − 3.373e−004 cm 2 /Vs, respectively, on the same day of production. The high negative charge density was thought to be the result of adsorption of hydroxyl ions of PL-90G at o/w interface ( , ), and possible ionization of carboxylate (–COOH) group of the Pemulen under the influence of high power. These negative charges provide an electrostatic repulsion preventing the particle aggregation and conferring stability to IND-NHV. Interestingly, as discussed in the section “ Stability Study ,” marked shift in zeta potential values of vesicles was noted from − 43.26 to − 21.13 mV over the period of 90 days.

Transmission Electron Microscopy
Figure 3 c depicts TEM photomicrograph of IND-loaded NHV (S6). The vesicles appeared spherical in shape and did not stick to each other. In this regard, electrosteric stabilization of vesicles (discussed in the section “ Stability Study ”) was thought significant. As noticed, the vesicles had smaller TEM size (the largest particle diameter being 52.26 nm) when compared to DLS measurement (Z-Avg; 80.58 nm). This was obvious as DLS provides intensity based hydrodynamic diameters, while TEM works on dry samples under ultrahigh vacuum conditions ( ). Taking into account the monomodal (indicating single peak; Fig. 3 a) and narrow size distribution (PDI; 0.2), the noted variations in diameters were strongly correlated with the elastic behavior of vesicles (discussed in the section “ Rheological Investigation ”) suggesting its ability to squeeze and deform to smaller dimensions. The selective staining of hydrophilic PAA block of the Pemulen polymer was achieved through uranyl acetate ( ). The stained particles suggested an adsorption of polymer on the drug-loaded lipid core. In this regard, as discussed in our earlier research work ( , ), hydrophobic interaction between acyl chain of lecithin (PL-90G) and the polymer was thought significant. The adsorbed polymer further benefits the vesicles to prevent aggregation through its steric constraints.
ATR-FTIR Analysis
Figure 5 depicts the results of FTIR analysis. The IR spectrum of pure IND was characterized by principle absorption peaks in the range of 1500–1800/cm. Precisely, peak at 1688/cm could be assigned to benzoyl C=O stretch, while asymmetric C=O stretch of cyclic dimer was seen at 1712/cm. PTR-1 showed a absorption band within 1702–1718/cm [H-bonded C=O stretch], PL-90G had distinct absorption peak at 2923/cm (asymmetric –CH 2 stretch), 2854/cm (symmetric –CH 2 stretch), 1705–1738/cm (C=O stretch), 1236/cm (P=O stretch), 1456/cm (acyl –CH 2 scissoring), and within 910–970/cm [N + (CH 3 ) 3 stretch], while span 80 displayed strong absorption peaks at 2922/cm and 2854/cm (–C–H stretch), 1740/cm (C=O stretch), and 1462/cm (C–H bending). Interestingly, there were prominent changes in studied IR spectrum of IND-loaded NHV signifying possible intermolecular interactions among the drug and the structural components. All the studied batches (Fig. 5 a) was characterized by three distinct features such as (a) broadening and red shift of benzoyl C=O stretch of IND at 1640/cm, (b) disappearance of IND asymmetric C=O stretch (1712/cm) indicating disruption of cyclic dimer, and (c) broad shallow peak within 3200–3400/cm. The absence of H-bonded C=O stretch of polymer (PTR-1) within 1702–1718/cm, and broadened and shifted benzoyl C=O stretch of IND at 1640/cm (Fig. 5 b), was strongly suggestive of hydrogen bonding between drug and polymer. Dimer disruption was thought to be the result of high power input during the processing ( ) and was expected to result in increased availability of free C=O. Though, an absence of distinct absorption peak at 1736/cm (Fig. 5 b) among the studied batches denied formation of free acid carbonyl group. Thus, the lack of both dimer and free acid carbonyl absorption peaks in the studied batches was strongly suggestive of drug surface amorphization during processing ( ). Here, it is necessary to realize that in order to achieve optimum viscosity, IND-NHV dispersions were neutralized to PH 6.4 using triethalonamine. At this PH, IND was expected to exist in ionized state as PH > Pka (4.5). In this situation, negatively charged carboxylate (COO − ) ions are most likely to associate with positively charged quaternary ammonium group of PL90G through electrostatic interaction. This was characterized by marked blue shift of N + (CH 3 ) 3 of PL-90G (910–970/cm) to 1040–1070/cm in the studied batches (Fig. 5 a). This association was expected to minimize electrostatic repulsion between polar head groups of PL as a result of drug-induced charge neutralization. Also to note that unlike broad peak within (3100–3600/cm) for –OH stretch of PL90G and span 80, NHV showed distinct shallow peaks within 3200–3400/cm (Fig. 5 a). This was indicative of possible intermolecular hydroxyl association between the lecithin (PL-90G) and the surfactant (span 80). Besides, lack of distinct P=O stretch (1236/cm) of PL90 G in designed vesicles was indicative of lipid hydration ( ) substantiating H-bond formation with water, while broad peak seen within 2000–2200/cm was for ATR crystal (diamond).

Rheological Investigation
The oscillatory measurements assisted to better understand viscoelastic properties of designed IND-NHV (S6). The results of oscillatory measurements are depicted in Fig. 6 . The investigated viscoelastic parameters were complex modulus ( G *), storage modulus ( G i ), loss modulus ( G ii ), phase angle ( δ ), and complex viscosity ( η *). As shown in Fig. 6 a, an investigated NHV had constant G * within stress amplitude of 1–10 Pa, indicating LVR. In this region (1–10 Pa), the microstructure of the vesicle remained intact representing the resistance to deformation. Though, beyond critical stress (σ c ) of 10 Pa, an increase in stress amplitude drastically decreased G * suggesting possible breakdown of the vesicle microstructure. The phase angle (δ) supported to identify elastic (δ < 45°) to the viscous (δ > 45°) transitions ( ). As can be seen in Fig. 6 a, the phase angle that remained well below 30° within LVR gradually increased with the stress amplitude. This strongly indicated that the designed vesicles behaves as an elastic solid within LVR (1–10 Pa) and with an increase in stress amplitude, the system undergoes viscous transition (δ > 45°). This could be attributed to the combined effect of polymer chain disentanglement at high shear ( ), and surfactant (span80) altered lipid membrane fluidity. On the other hand, the frequency sweep provided the valuable information on the network structure formed by particle interactions. As depicted in Fig. 6 b, the storage modulus ( G i ) of NHV was greater than the loss modulus ( G ii ) and both the moduli had only weak dependency on frequency. This substantiated prevalence of elastic component and gel-like structure of an investigated vesicle ( , ). Moreover, as noted in Fig. 6 b, significant decrease in complex viscosity ( η *) confirmed shear thinning rheology of NHV ( ), an important attribute for transnasal application.

In vitro Release Kinetic Study
The cumulative drug release (%) from an optimized NHV and pure drug suspension is depicted in Fig. 7 a. As can be seen, designed NHV released 87.79% of drug at the end of 12 h, while pure drug suspension had drug release of only 20.17% at the end of 12 h. The marked difference in drug release behavior was strongly attributed to colloidal dimensions of designed vesicles that bring about an increase in drug dissolution rate. Besides, a distinct biphasic behavior was noted for an optimized NHV. The rapid drug release at an initial phase was thought to be the result of amphipathic nature of phosphatidylcholine ( ). In order to get insight into release behavior and further to establish mechanism of IND release from the designed NHV, a detailed kinetic study was performed. As can be seen from the model fitting curves (Fig. 7 b) and obtained release kinetic parameters (Table V ), IND-NHV best fitted to matrix diffusion ( r = 0.9905) model. Though, the noted release exponent ( n > 1) clearly demonstrated supercase –II transport of IND from designed NHV. Here, it is necessary to realize that upon hydration with external aqueous phase the hydrophilic PAA chains of the Pemulen forms a diffusion barrier in the form of microgel ( ). This presents a unique challenge for the incorporated active as it has to diffuse first through the lipid matrix and then through the microgel. Also, note that the release exponent ( n ) is related to the geometrical shape of the carrier. It is documented that “ n ” is equal to 0.5/0.45/0.43 and 1.0/0.89/0.85 (thin films/cylinders/spheres) for pure diffusion or pure case II transport, respectively ( ). Though, as confirmed through electron microscopy for the spherical shape of an investigated NHV (S6), the noted release exponent was much higher than reported values. Thus, it was strongly believed that the IND release from the designed hybrid vesicle was not only the function of diffusion through the lipid matrix but involved some additional mechanism. In this regard, shear induced distension and disentanglement of an adsorbed polymer chains (discussed in the section “ Rheological Investigation ”) and their subsequent molecular relaxation ( ) was thought to be a prime factor governing the drug release from the designed vesicles. Thus, the IND release from designed NHV appears to be a combination of diffusion through lipid matrix and microgel and subsequent relaxation of methacrylate chains.

Ex vivo Permeation Studies
In this work, we used sheep ( Ovis aries ) nasal mucosa as is histopathologically identical to human nasal mucosa ( ). The obtained permeability parameters are summarized in Table VI while the cumulative drug permeated across the sheep nasal mucosa is depicted in Fig. 7 c. As can be seen, the % cumulative (Q T ) drug permeation of 316.6 ± 3.89 μg/cm 2 and 60.4 ± 2.15 μg/cm 2 was achieved for NHV and IND-suspension (reference), respectively, at the end of 12 h. The steady-state drug flux (J ss, μg/cm 2 /h) of 26.61 ± 2.84 and 5.16 ± 1.74, the permeability coefficient (Papp, cm/h × 10 −3 ) of 13.30 ± 0.84 and 2.58 ± 0.64, and the diffusion coefficient (D, cm 2 /h × 10 −4 ) of 7.66 ± 0.65 and 1.48 ± 0.32 were noted for the NHV, and the pure drug suspension, respectively. Thus, the study clearly demonstrated ≈ 5-fold increase in drug flux when formulated as NHV. The increased drug permeability could be attributed to the colloidal dimensions of NHV that favors adhesion to the mucosal surface and thereby facilitate drug transport through internalization ( ). Moreover, the formulation excipients such as span 80 and polymer (Pemulen) can influence the fluidity of membrane phospholipids and the paracellular pathway by temporarily opening the tight junctions between the epithelium cells of nasal mucosa ( , ).

Histopathological Evaluation of Mucosa
Figure 8 depicts histopathology of untreated (negative control) sheep nasal mucosa, mucosa treated with isopropyl alcohol (positive control), and mucosa treated with NHV after 12-h permeation study. As can been be seen, the untreated mucosa (Fig. 8 a) was characterized by pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium, basement membrane, and loose fibrocollagenous tissue at subepithelial layer with plenty of thick-walled blood vessels with mucous secreting glands (goblet cell). The mucosal treatment with isopropyl alcohol (Fig. 8 b) was characterized by severe damage indicating necrosis, ulceration, hypercellularity of the lamina propria, hyperplasia of epithelial lining, and the inflammation. On the other hand, the mucosa treated with NHV (Fig. 8 c) was characterized by minimal alterations in basal membrane and superficial part of submucosa though slight sloughing off epithelial layer was noticed. In this regard, as mentioned in the section “Ex-vivo Permeation Studies,” the surfactant (span 80) induced change in fluidity of membrane phospholipids ( , ), and polymer (Pemulen) induced opening of tight junctions between the epithelium cells enabling paracellular pathway was held responsible ( ). Thus, from the obtained results, it can be inferred that the NHV formulation had no significant effect on the microscopic structure of mucosa indicating its safety for nasal administration, and with an altered epithelial organization, it is possible to have an improved drug permeability from the designed NHV.

Stability Study
In stabilization of a colloidal system, DLVO (Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek) theory rest on the balance between electrostatic (repulsive) and van der Waals (attractive) forces. The colloidal stability of designed IND-loaded NHV was investigated through DLS and ELS, and the results are summarized in Table VII . The minimal variations ( p value < 0.05) occurred in Z-Avg and PDI of IND-NHV (S6) on the 90th day since its production. However, significant changes occurred in zeta potential ζ (mV) of IND-NHV during the stability period. EOS plots (Fig. 4 ) assisted to investigate apparent migration velocity of designed vesicles under the influence of electric field. For the purpose, we used NanoPlus, (Particulate Systems, Micromeritics Corporation) that allowed us to measure ζ (mV) of vesicle at five different locations within the cell and thereby negated the effects of electro-osmosis. Thus, by probing the migration velocity of sample at stationary plane (where electro-osmotic flow velocity is zero), it was possible to achieve true migration velocity (mobility) of vesicle . As observed, on the 90th day of its production, an initial zeta potential (− 43.36 mV) and the mobility (− 3.373e−004 cm 2 /Vs) of vesicles (Fig. 4 a) was shifted to − 21.13 ± 2.1 mV and − 1.648e−004 cm 2 /Vs (Fig. 4 b). This marked reduction in zeta potential was thought to be a result of steric stabilization of NHV over the period of time. In steric stabilization, shielding of surface charges was obvious as adsorbed polymer coat and modifies the surface ( ) and brings about marked reduction in surface charge density. Also, note that a sterically stabilized system is able to exhibit good physical stability at low zeta potential value of − 20 mV ( ). Based on the above observation, it can be inferred that an initial high zeta potential (− 43.36 mV) of the designed NHV provide an electrostatic stabilization while over the period of time progressive shielding of surface charges occurs upon formation of microgel network around the vesicles with an extended PAA chains of polymer rendering steric stability to NHV. Thus, both an initial electrostatic and progressive steric stabilization was considered beneficial for the long term stability of designed NHV.

CONCLUSION
Here, we successfully designed IND-loaded nanostructured hybrid vesicles (IND-NHVs) based on lecithin (PL90G) and acrylate/C10-C30 alkyl acrylate (Pemulen TR-1NF). Cavitation technology using power ultrasound was found to be a feasible method to produce desired NHV. Central composite design (CCD) enabled identification of operating variables influencing the size (Z-Avg), PDI, and the ZP (mV) of hybrid vesicles. The obtained polynomial equations and response surfaces assisted to predict the values of selected operating variables for preparation of optimum IND-NHV. Statistical analysis (ANOVA, t-statistics, Pareto analysis, diagnostic residuals, and probability distribution) substantiated the adequacy of used experimental design. Microscopy analysis confirmed spherical morphology of IND-NHV. ATR analysis substantiated strong intermolecular interactions among the drug (IND) and the components of vesicle. This included drug polymer H-bonding and two major associations between charged carboxylate (COO − ) ions (IND) with N + (CH 3 ) 3 of PL-90G, and noncovalent intermolecular hydroxyl (–OH) association between the PL-90G and surfactant (span 80). Oscillatory measurements confirmed an elastic nature and shear thinning rheology of designed NHV. Moreover, the deigned NHV exhibited supercase II transport ( n > 1), an exceptional stability, safety, and accentuates transnasal flux of IND providing a better prospect in the management of Alzheimer’s disease (AD).
