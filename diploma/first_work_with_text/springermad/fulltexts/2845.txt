Introduction
Obesity is considered a chronic metabolic disease associated with the development of comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes, chronic inflammation, hypertension and dyslipidemia. This condition can trigger or worsen other metabolic diseases, reducing life expectancy of the individual [ ]. It is also important to consider that the worldwide prevalence of obesity has increased considerably throughout all age ranges, placing at greatest risk the most vulnerable populations.
It is generally believed that the etiology of overweight and obesity resides in a sedentary lifestyle in addition to a high-caloric diet [ ]. However, these are not isolated factors related to childhood obesity. Other factors increase susceptibility to fat stworage in the presence of an obesogenic environment such as genetic factors, nutritional status of the mother during pregnancy and infant feeding during the first year of life [ ].
Ross and Desai 2014 suggested that obesity in childhood and adulthood may be a consequence of hyperphagia programming derived from maternal nutritional abnormalities during pregnancy and lactation , such as malnutrition and maternal obesity. Both conditions increase the risk of hyperphagia and obesity in the offspring [ ].
According to diverse health organizations, breast milk consumption is the most recommended feeding for the newborn as a result of the benefits it confers. Several systematic reviews have linked breast milk intake with a protective effect against obesity and other metabolic diseases [ , ]. There is enough scientific evidence demonstrating that, in addition to breast milk being a source of nutrition, it exerts control over the metabolism of the newborn by transferring bioactive compounds such as metabolic hormones. These can regulate body composition by controlling food intake programming, thus influencing the energy balance in later stages of life. These compounds are not found in commercial milk formulas [ , , , ].
Metabolic hormones secreted in milk from mothers may regulate the activities of various tissues and organs until the endocrine system of the neonate begins to function. These hormones mainly include leptin, ghrelin, insulin, adiponectin, obestatin, resistin, apelin, nesfatin, irisin, epidermal growth factor (EGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) [ ]. For instance, Fields and colleagues 2017 reported a significant association between maternal BMI with insulin levels ( p = 0.0322); the insulin secreted in milk from obese mothers was higher than in normal weight mothers. On the other hand, the authors found a significant association between BMI and leptin levels in milk ( p < 0.0001). Also, leptin levels were higher in milk from overweight and obese mothers than normal weight mothers [ ]. The goal of this review is to present “state of the art” information in regard to bioactive compounds such as hormones secreted in breast milk and their possible impact on nutritional programing in the child, analyzing their functions in appetite regulation and their association with maternal body mass index (BMI).
A comprehensive review of the literature was undertaken via the electronic databases PubMed ( www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov ) platform, using the following search terms and MEDLINE Medical Subject Headings (MeSH): “development-gastrointestinal tract, food-intake, milk-human or “breastmilk” and (adipokines, leptin, adiponectin, insulin, ghrelin, obestatin, resistin, irisin, copeptin, apelin, peptide YY, Glucagon-Like Peptide 1, IGF-1. The fundamental inclusion criterion was to include experimental and updated studies published in English. Searches containing relevant synonyms and combinations of the above terms were also utilized. We reviewed mainly information about human breast milk of any of the hormones previously mentioned and their relation to maternal BMI and with the growth of the newborn.
Early-Life Nutritional Programming
In recent years, the hypothesis of nutritional programming was introduced, suggesting that the environment from infancy , combined with genetic factors , influences the phenotypical characteristics related to energy balance. The maternal environment influences the growth, metabolism, neurobiology, immune function and behavior of the offspring of different animals [ ]. This in turn may increase the susceptibility of the individual to develop metabolic disorders during later stages of life [ , ]. Nutritional signals during early life (pre- and postnatal period) may affect metabolic pathways, thereby inducing permanent changes to the predisposition of metabolic diseases such as obesity [ , , , ]. Studies carried out in animal models and systematic studies in humans demonstrated that breastfeeding provided by a diabetic, obese or malnourished mother triggers metabolic disorders in the offspring [ , , , ]. Additionally, it has also been suggested that some feeding practices in infants such as formula feeding and early introduction of solid foods may increase the incidence of overweight/obesity in children and adults [ , ].
This information shows that maternal nutrition plays a key role in the nutritional programming of offspring. Additionally, protein and fat intake in early childhood is significantly related to increased adiposity and greater BMI; a greater intake of proteins tends to stimulate a higher secretion of insulin, which could lead to the insulin resistance, causing an inadequate uptake of glucose. As a result of this alteration, the blood glucose levels increase resulting in the augment of lipogenesis [ , , , ]. Different studies have demonstrated that maternal intake of macronutrient-rich foods has a positive association with birthweight of the newborn [ , , , ]. In observational studies in humans, protein intake during childhood directly correlated with BMI in later stages. This may explain the possible mechanism by which human milk decreases risk of obesity because it typically has 60–70% less protein and 10–18% lower caloric density compared to traditional formulas [ ]. Taking into consideration that early nutrition plays a central role in the development of nutritional and metabolic alterations, it is necessary to supervise nutrition in the early age in order to prevent further alterations [ ]. Dewey 2003 and Harding 2001 propose that breastfed infants are protected against the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes and have a lower relative risk during later life of cardiovascular diseases such as hypercholesterolemia and high blood pressure [ , ]. For this reason, diverse health institutions such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) recommend the exclusive intake of human breast milk for the first 6 months of life, followed by the gradual introduction of complementary foods and continued breastfeeding for two years or more [ ]. Studies carried out in animal and human models showed that breast milk provides the newborn with nutrients needed for optimal development and helps reinforce the immune system , as well as bioactive molecules that could regulate energy balance [ , , ].
Growth and Programming Mechanisms of Appetite in Peri- and Postnatal Stages
Fetal growth is regulated by nutrients and hormones supplied by the mother. During the first stages of fetal development, the main events are cell differentiation leading to organogenesis, while the major growth of the fetus occurs during the last trimester of gestation. For example, Harding 2001 and Coupé 2010 mentioned that the major hormonal mediators involved in fetal growth are insulin and the IGF family involved in homeostatic metabolism of glucose. IGF-1 as a good candidate in the participation of nutritional programming and may be a key factor in determining infant length at birth as well as the risk of developing metabolic disorders. IGF-1 may also play an important role in food intake during later stages [ , ]. Consequently, changes in the fetal metabolic environment could directly influence the appetite-regulating pathways.
The hypothalamic/pituitary axis is responsible for regulating food intake from the time of delivery, activating orexigenic pathways that stimulate appetite or anorexigenic pathways that inhibit it; thus, changes in molecules involved in both pathways could alter long-term food intake. It is to some extent due to during the postnatal stage, some nutrient sensor levels like sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) are increased in response to circulating nutrients. Infants from a mother fed a high-fat diet during pregnancy and lactation exhibit reduced AMPK and increased Agouti-related protein (AgRP) levels by stimuli of SIRT1, leading to activation of orexigenic pathways [ , , ]. This suggests that the maternal nutritional status can affect the hypothalamic/pituitary axis that regulates food intake in the newborn, leading to hyperphagia due to the increase of neuropeptide Y (NYP) and AgRP. Both have orexigenic effects, increasing appetite and reducing the secretion of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and of cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) peptides both induce satiety; thus this deregulation of the hypothalamic nucleus may trigger obesity [ , ].
Additionally, murine models demonstrate that early overnutrition results in early-onset arcuate leptin resistance and alterations in insulin sensitivity, leading to increased high-fat dietary intake. High levels of leptin may affect the appetite control in postnatal development because it participates in the establishment of neural connections in the hypothalamus [ ]. Gupta et al. 2009 observed that obesity in rats, induced by a high-fat diet prior to and during pregnancy, produce high levels of circulating leptin and insulin altering signaling and modifying the expression of orexigenic and anorexigenic peptides in fetal hypothalamus. These alterations might be lead to increased hyperphagy , triggering the development of obesity in postnatal life [ ]. Accordingly, infants of overweight/obese mothers, show a rapid growth and gain weight during the first year of life even when breastfed. This rapid growth has been proposed as a predictor of obesity in later life [ , ].
Wells 2001 considers that growth patterns across the life-course may show a high association with disease development, because there has been a disparity between the homeostatic “metabolic capacity” and the “metabolic load” induced by a hypercaloric diet and sedentary behavior. The risk of such disparity is decreased by maternal physiology regulating offspring growth during gestation and lactation; however, it is necessary to take in consideration the maternal capital phenotype because the offspring growth patterns are sensitive to this [ ].
Breastfeeding
Human milk provides all the necessary nutrients for infant growth. The composition of this fluid comprises of macro- and micronutrients whose concentration s vary during lactation due to neuroendocrine regulatory mechanisms. Variations respond to the needs of infants, as reflected in the changes from colostrum to transitional milk to mature milk. All have the same major components: proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, water, minerals and vitamins necessary for growth and development of the newborn [ , ].
Colostrum, the yellowish first milk, has a high energetic density and is produced in low quantities. On average 5–30 mL is produced prenatally and is seen the first couple of days after birth only during the normal progression of secretory activation. Colostrum contains a high concentration of immune components (e.g., secretory IgA), lactoferrin, and leukocytes as well as growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) [ , ].
According to Nommsen-Rivers et al. 2012 the secretory activation phase or lactogenesis II can present variability among the first days after delivery and could occur until beyond day 7 and the milk that is secreted varies in its composition until it becomes full milk. This milk is commonly denominated transition milk, the “ramping up” of milk production to support the nutritional and developmental needs of the rapidly growing infant, and generally occurs from 7 to 15 days postpartum [ ]. The volume of milk secretion increases considerably, ~600–800 mL/day. The amount of carbohydrates and lipids increases, whereas the concentration of major proteins is reduced by ~50% compared with colostrum [ , ].
Finally, mature milk secreted after 4 weeks postpartum is produced at an average of ~700–900 mL/day during the first 6 months. The actual volume will depend on the mother’s parity, nutrition, genetic factors and infant stimulus [ , ]. In contrast to the dramatic shift in composition observed during the first month, human milk remains relatively similar in composition, although smaller changes are observed over the course of lactation. The protein fraction decreases (from 4.1 g/100 mL in colostrum to 1.6 g/100 mL in transitional milk and finally to 0.9 g/100 mL in mature human milk), whereas the concentration of lipids increases slightly compared to transitional milk [ , ].
The milk of primates and humans contains additional compounds such as micronutrients and 85–90% water (the only source of water for the newborn), while the milk composition of other species varies during lactation according to the type of feeding, growth patterns and the level physiological maturation [ , ]. However, the newborn has compensatory systems to achieve adequate digestion of nutrients, but these mechanisms are different in the preterm child . Milk contains immunoglobulins, lysozymes, folate, vitamin D, amylase, bile salt-stimulated lipase, cells, cytokines and other bioactive molecules with high nutritional value such as leptin, adiponectin, insulin, obestatin, ghrelin, resistin, irisin and various growth factors like IGF-1 involved in the appetite regulatory mechanism [ , , ], positively influencing infant health. It has been suggested that such molecules ingested through breast milk preserve their biological function due to the immature digestive tract of the newborn. Low proteolytic activities in the gastrointestinal tract of newborns and the existence of a higher “permeability” for macromolecules in neonates may facilitate the absorption of proteins despite the highly glycosylated form of these proteins [ , , ].
Maternal Overweight and Obesity During Lactation
It is well known that the prevalence of overweight and obese women has increased considerably. Women with these nutritional alterations have reduced prolactin production despite stimuli exerted by infant sucking, leading to a delay in lactogenesis II and low volume of milk secreted. Consequently, mothers who are obese are less likely to initiate lactation, and are prone to early cessation of breastfeeding [ , , ]. According to Rasmussen 2004, women who are overweight or obese (BMI >26 kg/m 2 ) before pregnancy exhibited a lower prolactin response to suckling than normal-weight women at the first 48 h post-partum, though the values were normalized by day 7 [ ]. Obese mothers have lower initiation and duration rates of breastfeeding, which has been attributed in part to greater positioning and latch challenges leading to food supplementation with formula or other supplements to the infant [ , ].
The nutritional risks during pregnancy and lactation depend on the mother’s previous nutritional status as well as the ability to store reserves during pregnancy and the adaptive mechanisms that allow the mother to decrease nutritional expenditure [ , , ]. Her nutritional status at conception influences the volume of milk produced and its caloric content, mainly from the lipid portion. Rodriguez-Palmero 1999 described that lipid content in milk from obese women is increased with respect to the milk of normal-weight women [ ]. According to Mäkelä and collaborators in 2013, saturated fatty acids are higher (46.3% from total fatty acids) in overweight women’s breast milk compared to normal weight women’s breast milk (43.6% from total fatty) and lower in the concentration of omega 3 fatty acids (2.2% and 2.7% respectively) [ ].
During lactation, maternal metabolic changes such as hyperphagia occur to cover the rising energy demands of the infant, which are higher (20–25%) than that observed in pregnancy [ , ]. These changes are controlled by neuroendocrine mechanisms regulating the homeostatic balance in which leptin, insulin, obestatin, ghrelin, resistin, adiponectin, apelin, irisin, nesfatin, NPY, glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) and cortisol play a central role (Tables 1 and 2 ) [ , , ]. Furthermore, maternal nutritional status may affect the infant. Newborns of overweight or obese mothers show rapid growth during the first year of life, even when they are breastfed [ , , ]. Table 1 Function and effect in neonate of the metabolic hormones secreted in breast human milk Hormone Function Secretion Effect in neonate Authors LEPTIN Protein of 167 amino acids with numerous exposed hydrophobic residues that allows their binding with the receptor. Action site is the central nervous system, regulating the eating behavior and energetic homeostasis. Secreted as a response to food intake to suppress the appetite through a hypothalamic axes. Synthesized and secreted mainly by adipose tissue and other organs such as the mammary epithelium. The concentration of neonatal leptin, is involved in the formation of neuronal projections, which favors the maturation of hypothalamic nuclei. The presence of leptin in human milk has been suggested to have a positive effect on early satiety in infants, influencing nutritional programming and energy balance in childhood and adulthood. Casabiell et al. [ ] Ross et al. [ ] Brunner et al. [ ] Kon et al. [ ] ADIPONECTIN It’s a member of the adipocytokine family. Its primary structure comprises 244 amino acids. The basic structural unit of adiponectin is a trimer. Stimulates fatty acids oxidation, reduces plasma triglycerides, and improves glucose metabolism by increasing the insulin sensitivity. It is synthesized in the adipocytes and the concentration of this hormone in plasma respond to the circulating triglycerides concentration. The effect of this hormone is controversial, because some authors did not report association between adiponectin and anthropometric parameters of infants Higher adiponectin concentration is associated with greater neonatal weight gain. Milk adiponectin at 6 weeks of life was significantly inversely associated with infant lean body mass Perry et al. [ ] Newburg et al. [ ] Dündar et al. [ ] Brunner et al. [ ] INSULIN It is a 51 amino acid polypeptide hormone. Participate in the energetic homeostasis. Produced and secreted from the β cells of the islets of Langerhans from pancreas. It is secreted under the influence of various stimuli including intake of protein and carbohydrates. High insulin concentrations are associated with decreased lean mass and low birth weight of infant. Whitmore et al. [ ] Fields et al. [ ] Ahuja et al. [ ] GHRELIN Peptide of 28 amino acids, it has been described as the secretagogue receptor ligand of the growth hormone. Promotes the expression of genes that regulate beta-cell survival, insulin biosynthesis and glucose sensitivity. Participate in the intestinal motility, and is involved in energy homeostasis, presenting an orexigenic effect. It is synthesized and secreted by most of the peripheral tissues, however, the major producing cells are the oxyntic cells of the gastric mucosa. Formula-fed infants have higher plasma levels of ghrelin compared to breastfed children and these correlates positively with a greater infant weight gain, possibly with an influence on the growth of the newborn. The ghrelin concentration of breast milk has been positively correlated with the weight and size of the neonate. Steculorum et al. [ ] Whatmore et al. [ ] Aydin et al. [ ] Kon et al.

Hormones secreted in milk that are involved in appetite control possibly help the newborn positively regulate food intake while the endocrine system fully matures and is able to secrete pancreatic hormones to facilitate digestion. Consequently, an adequate concentration of these peptides is important to prevent metabolic alterations in the neonate [ , , , , ]. There is some controversy with respect to the functionality of these hormones after they have passed through the digestive tract. However, the immaturity of this system of the newborn allows these hormones to be moved within the intestine and reach the bloodstream of the newborn to achieve their function [ , , ].
Hormones of Breast Milk Involved in Nutritional Programming
Leptin
Leptin is a hormone that participates in the energetic metabolism regulation as is shown in Table 1 [ , , ]. Leptin circulates in plasma at a concentration proportional to the amount of body fat [ , ] and crosses the blood brain barrier, serving as a signal indicative of energy reserves. It binds to its specific receptor in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) and appears to be involved in regulation of orexin production. Orexin-producing neurons project from the lateral hypothalamus [ , ].
Miralles et al. 2006 refer that hypothalamic nuclei continue their differentiation during the first postnatal stage and, for this reason, is important to control infant feeding. For example, in the infant during the postnatal stage, hyperphagia increases fat deposits and weight gain, which could be related to hyperleptinemia, leading to leptin resistance in the infant [ ].
According different researchers, the presence of leptin in human milk have a positive effect on early satiety in infants, influencing nutritional programming and energy balance in childhood and adulthood [ , , ]. Schuster et al. 2011, demonstrated that leptin levels increase in breast milk during the first month postpartum. Leptin concentration in milk of normal-weight women has been positively correlated with circulating levels of leptin, adiposity and maternal BMI [ ]. Although the mechanisms are unknown, a higher concentration of circulating leptin has been found in infants fed breast milk [1.16 ± 0.99 ng/mL] than in infants fed formula [0.68 ± 1.11 ng/mL]. In this study, Savino et al. proposed that leptin in milk reaches the circulation of the newborn [ ]. These findings suggest that the newborn requires this hormone supplied by breast milk to activate the satiety signal during the first days of life.
Adiponectin
Adiponectin is involved in the regulation of metabolism as is indicated in the Table 1 [ ] and is regulated by factors such as IGF-1 that stimulates its gene expression and secretion [ , ].
Adiponectin can be found in its basic form (low molecular weight) or in larger structures (high molecular weight). The first stimulates β-oxidation in skeletal muscle, whereas the second produces a decrease in output of hepatic glucose. Its function in the regulation of food intake may be a response of the nutrient concentration, mainly fatty acids, in order to induce behavioral changes in appetite [ , ].
During early infancy serum levels of this hormone are negatively correlated with weight and length of infants. Andreas et al. 2014 reported that premature newborns have a lower concentration of adiponectin than term infants [ ]. This adipokine is also secreted in human milk and can cross the intestinal barrier and may modify infant metabolism [ , , ]. The levels of this hormone in human milk correlate inversely with infant weight and anthropometry during the first 4 months of life [ , , ]. However, it has been reported that adiponectin levels in breast milk decrease during lactation. That evidence suggests that adiponectin from human milk may contribute to a reduced incidence of overweight and obesity in later life. Accordingly it has been hypothesized that the presence of this hormone in human breast milk is important during the first year of life to promote catabolism when solid foods are newly introduced to the diet of the newborn [ , , ].
Insulin
Insulin is a polypeptide hormone involved in anabolism of carbohydrates that quickly responds to food intake and gets into the bloodstream in relation to the amount of body fat. This makes insulin a key hormone in the homeostasis of blood glucose favoring the entrance of glucose to the cell and the activation of the glycolytic metabolism [ , ]. Insulin secretion reaches the hypothalamus by a saturable transport process acting as anorexigenic molecule by reducing food intake. The binding of insulin to its receptor triggers several pathways, one of which lead s to phosphorylation of transcription factor Fork head box protein 1 (FOXP-1) by regulation of neurotransmitters, promoting the expression of POMC and inhibiting the expression of AgRP [ , ].
Due to the central role of insulin in glucose metabolism, to take into consideration that during pregnancy there are physiological changes, including increased blood glucose and hyperinsulinemia that lead to resistance to this hormone; however, plasma glucose and insulin levels decline rapidly during the first 5 days postpartum in healthy mothers [ , ]. Nevertheless, in mothers with alterations such as diabetes, overweight and obesity, glucose concentration does not return to physiological levels, resulting in altered circulating insulin concentration. These alterations have an important impact on the infant and have been associated with low milk production and low birthweight of their offspring [ , , ]. Identification of insulin in human milk was described more than two decades ago by Jovanovic-Peterson [ ], but its function in the newborn has not been totally established. However, diverse authors describe that insulin secreted in milk may have an important role for the infant and is possibly involved in functional developmental [ , ]. These findings are supported on studies in rats demonstrating that insulin is involved in the maturation of intestinal epithelium and induces pancreatic amylase production during weaning [ ].
Insulin in breast milk is secreted in concentrations similar to serum levels of the healthy mother [ ], though insulin concentration in milk of obese women is ~7 times greater than the insulin concentration in milk of eutrophic women at 6 weeks postpartum [ ]. Other authors have reported that maternal BMI was not correlated with insulin concentration in milk. The high concentration of insulin may have an adverse effect on the infant. Whitmore et al. 2012 reported high levels of this hormone affecting infant body composition. The results of this study indicate that the higher insulin milk concentration was associated with lower infant weight and lean mass ( r = −0.49 and −0.58, respectively, P < 0.06), affecting growth of the newborn [ ]. This information supports an important role of insulin secreted in breast milk on the growth of the newborn during the first months of life.
Ghrelin
According to Grönberg et al. 2008, ghrelin is also produced in the mammary gland, and has important functions described in the Table 1 [ , ]. It is transported through the blood and crosses the blood–brain barrier to reach the ARC where it stimulates synthesis of NPY/AgRP and orexins A and B. Its action is initiated prior to food intake. This hormone influences glucose metabolism, energy balance, gastrointestinal motility, gastric acid secretion, and cardiovascular and immune system function [ , ]. Ghrelin competes with leptin for the receptors via the vagus nerve, inducing neuronal activation in the nucleus of the solitary tract and triggering dorsomotor motility and gastric secretion [ ].
There is a direct correlation between the concentration of circulating ghrelin and the age, weight and height of mothers and their offspring. There are reports about the secretion of this hormone in breast milk increases during lactation, reaching its maximum value in mature milk in eutrophic women [ , ]. Formula-fed infants have higher plasma levels of ghrelin compared to breastfed children and this correlates positively with a greater infant weight gain, possibly with an influence on the growth of the newborn [ ]. Additional studies are necessary to elucidate its function in infant development.
Obestatin
Obestatin has an antagonist role for ghrelin as showed in Table 1 [ ]; also, enhances glucose uptake in either the absence or presence of insulin and promotes GLUT4 translocation by increasing its signaling pathway (phosphorylation of Akt activating SIRT1). This has been proposed because inhibition of SIRT1 by small interfering RNAs reduces obestatin-induced glucose uptake [ , ].
Interestingly, this hormone is secreted in human milk. Aydin et al. 2008 reported the concentration of this hormone is higher in colostrum than in mature milk from eutrophic women [ ]. Based on the evidence that obestatin is involved in food intake, its role may participate in the satiety signal in early life. However, there are no studies regarding the association of obestatin concentration in human milk with growth or development of the newborn.
Resistin
Resistin among other roles (described in Table 1 ), plays an orexigenic function, especially in patients with low weight or with a metabolic disorder. This function is associated with changes in the expression levels of various neuropeptides such as NPY and AMPK activity dependent on nutritional status [ ]. Resistin has been suggested to be an important link between obesity, insulin resistance and diabetes [ ].
During the first 3 postpartum days, resistin shows the highest serum concentration in eutrophic women and then declines [ ]. There is also evidence that suggests the secretion and synthesis of this hormone by the mammary gland where the levels in milk decrease throughout lactation; therefore, the milk may supply part of the resistin circulating in the infant. The concentration of this hormone is higher in the sera of infants than in breast milk or maternal serum 3 months after birth. This evidence leads us to hypothesize that infant breast milk consumption contributes to levels of this hormone in the circulation of the infant, with a possible impact on the weight of the child [ ].
Irisin
Is a myokine secreted in response to the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and its co-activator-1 alpha (PGC-1α) (Table 1 ). Other functions of irisin, are activate oxygen intake, and activates mitochondrial biogenesis and expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), which leads to heat production in the mitochondria, facilitating energy expenditure [ , ].
Levels of this peptide are modified depending on the metabolic conditions, among other factors. Considering that pregnancy and lactation trigger metabolic changes, they are also associated with modifications in irisin concentration. Throughout pregnancy, it has been proposed that irisin regulates the increase of adipose tissue to boost energy reserves available for development of the offspring and to meet the requirements of the mother; however, its function is not yet fully known [ ]. Irisin may play an important role during lactation because the plasma concentration of this peptide is increased significantly in lactating versus non-lactating women. Interestingly, the presence of irisin in breast milk has been reported and its concentration increases during lactation, reaching a maximum level at the end of the first month postpartum [ , ]. Based on this information and because irisin is involved in energy regulation, it has been suggested that there is a direct relationship between levels of this hormone and birth weight [ ], though no studies are available that support this hypothesis.
Copeptin
Copeptin, among other roles (denoted in Table 1 ), can act as a growth factor by pH regulation through acid–base transport systems [ , ]. Dobša and Cullen 2013 refer that that both are indirectly involved in smooth muscle contraction during parturition and lactation as well as participating in the regulation of water excretion and in cardiovascular functions [ ]. Copeptin can indirectly participate in glucose-insulin metabolism [ ].
It has also been hypothesized that copeptin indirectly influences regulation of food intake because plasma levels are linked with obesity. This is possibly due to the role of AVP in increasing cortisol levels, which may then lead to weight gain by increasing appetite, altering body fat distribution, and increasing truncal adiposity [ , ]. Furthermore, plasma copeptin concentration is elevated in patients with type 2 diabetes independent of other risk factors including fasting glucose and insulin [ , ].
Aydin and collaborators 2013 observed that this bioactive molecule is secreted in breast milk in amounts similar to maternal blood copeptin concentration and decreases during lactation. The concentration of copeptin in colostrum and transitional milk was significantly higher than in mature milk samples from healthy women and women with gestational diabetes [ ]. The role of copeptin in breast milk is unknown, but based on this study suggests that involvement of copetin in the regulation of food intake may be related to neonatal development. Studies are needed to determine the role of copeptin on the growth of the child.
Apelin
Two isoforms of apelin have been reported (shown in Table 1 ); this hormone was identified as the endogenous ligand of the orphan G-protein coupled receptor called AP [ ]. Castan-Laurell et al. 2008 described that apelin expression is regulated by insulin and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) in human adipocytes [ ].
It was reported by Boucher et al. 2006 in obese patients, plasma apelin and insulin levels are significantly higher, indicating that apelin homeostasis is impaired in obesity and suggesting that the rise in plasma insulin could promote an increase in blood concentration of apelin [ ]. Additionally, fasting plasma levels of apelin positively correlate with BMI. These data suggest that apelin may play an important role in obesity-related metabolic and cardiovascular alterations [ ]. However, the exact origin of this overproduction of apelin still remains to be elucidated.
In 1999, Habata discovered the secretion of apelin in colostrum of mice , but the presence of this peptide in human breast milk was not reported until 2010 [ ]. Apelin concentration increases during lactation, showing the highest levels in mature milk compared with transitional milk and colostrum. Additionally, Aydin 2010 described that concentrations of both isoforms of apelin from maternal serum were positively correlated with colostrum and mature milk [ ].
Although the high concentration of this hormone has been linked to overweight and obesity [ ], there are no studies regarding its role in food intake. Given that apelin is secreted in human milk and is altered in obesity, it may participate in neonatal weight gain. Then, are necessary studies aimed to determine the potential impact on the infant of this hormone in breast milk.
Nesfatin
Dong et al. 2014 reported that increased nesfatin-1 in the hypothalamus contributes to diminished food intake due to a ‘sense of satiety’ and promotes the loss of body fat and weight (indicated in Table 1 ) [ ].
The presence of nesfatin-1 in breast milk was first reported by Aydin and colleagues in 2010. Nesfatin-1 concentrations were higher in mature milk than in colostrum in both healthy women and women with a history of gestational diabetes, while its concentration in serum and milk was lower in the latter group. This lower concentration likely induces an increase in appetite, reducing the anorexigenic pathway in gestational diabetic mothers with a possible influence on their offspring [ ].
Despite the role of this hormone in food intake, there are no studies linking the effect of nesfatin to infant development . Nevertheless, this bioactive peptide may be important for growth, energy regulation and maturation of the neonatal gastrointestinal system.
Glucagon-Like Peptides (GLP-1)
GLP-1 is an incretin hormone (produced by the gut in response to food intake) derived from transcription of the proglucagon gene [ ] with anorectic functions described in the Table 1 . Once GLP-1 is secreted, it reaches the circulation and has a 2-min half-life due to rapid degradation by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4). Secretion of GLP-1 is dependent on the presence of nutrients such as carbohydrates, proteins and lipids in the small intestine [ ].
The function of GLP-1 is based on blood glucose concentration contributing to glucose homeostasis along with an insulinotrophic function. GLP-1 increases glucose sensitivity of alpha and beta cells that stimulate insulin secretion only during hyperglycemia [ ]. During the postprandial stage, glucagon secretion is inhibited and insulin secretion is increased; therefore, glucose metabolism is favored by GLP-1 and is directly involved in satiety. Some studies have suggested that GLP-1 inhibits gastric acid secretion and is involved in the function of the hypothalamus axes to produce satiety and reduce food intake [ , ].
The presence of this peptide in mature human breast milk has recently been reported in the same concentration in foremilk and hindmilk of healthy women and may be important for regulation of the infant’s appetite. This hypothesis is based on a study that shows a positive correlation between GLP-1 levels and infant growth, indicative of its requirement for development. But, at 6 months this correlation is negative, possibly due to the fact that the infant does not need an exogenous supply of GLP-1 [ ].
Insulin-Like Growth Factor (IGF-1)
In childhood and adulthood the relationships between serum insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) and body composition index are contradictory. An inverse correlation has been reported between IGF-1 and body fat, while other authors report a direct relationship. Studies in children support a direct relationship between levels of circulating blood IGF-1 and BMI [ , ].
IGF-1 is secreted in human milk and its level is high in colostrum, declining thereafter over the course of lactation. During the first days of life, the amount of growth factors produced by the infant may be insufficient and require an exogenous supply that is provided through breast milk [ , ]. IGF-1 secreted in human milk can be taken up by the infant in a bioactive form and transported to the blood. Thus, the presence of this growth factor in breast milk may contribute to serum levels of newborns because the levels are higher in breastfed infants that in formula-fed infants. The function of IGF-1 has not been fully detailed, but IGF-1 may stimulate weight gain. Ohkawa and collaborators 2010 suggest that a higher concentration rather than physiological levels in childhood could promote obesity in adulthood [ ]. For this reason different authors emphasize the need to carry out studies focused on analyzing the relationship between the IGF-1 concentration in breast milk and child development [ , ].
Cortisol
Breast milk is an important physiological pathway for the transfer bioactive compounds such as glucocorticoids that potentially influence the growth and phenotype of offspring behavior [ ]. Glucocorticoids are produced in primates in the adrenal glands, while in rodents the same gland secretes cortisol and corticosterone. They have the similar functions and are involved in different physiological, metabolic, immunological, and neurobiological roles; among their roles are the regulation of the use and storage of glucose and fats to energy requirement [ ]. Cortisol synthesis has also been reported in adipose tissue by reduction of inactive cortisone to active cortisol by the enzyme 11 beta hydroxyl steroid dehydrogenase-1 (11β-HSD1) [ ]. Hinde et al. 2015 reported that, in the milk of rhesus macaque ( Macaca mulatta ), the lower parity was associated with higher cortisol concentrations, and that higher cortisol concentrations in milk were associated with greater infant weight gain [ ]. Interestingly the presence of this hormone has been reported in the breast milk of eutrophic women, and taking into account that exposure to cortisol in the perinatal period predicts birth weight and weight gain patterns in early life, this could influence the metabolism of the infant [ ]. On the other hand, Van Der Wan and collaborators 2016 showed that in mothers who gave birth to a preterm infant, breast-milk glucocorticoid concentrations were lower than term infants. This hormone follows a diurnal rhythm and is highly correlated to the circadian rhythm of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis activity [ ]. Another study carried out in humans by Hahn-Holbrook 2016 examined the impact of early exposure on children’s body mass index percentile (BMIP) over the first 2 years of life. The authors reported that cortisol supplied through breastmilk contributes to early metabolic programming. Because the high concentration of this hormone predicted lower absolute of BMIP value at 2 years of age, this suggest that early cortisol exposure may provide protection against obesity [ ].
Hypothesis of the Possible Effect of Human Milk Hormones Involved in the Regulation of Food Intake on the Infant
Evidence presented here indicates that the programming of obesity is undoubtedly a complex process; taken together, the findings suggest some common mechanisms that include alterations in food intake pathways. We hypothesized that the phenotype of offspring from obese mothers may be characterized by increased growth rate, adiposity and serum glucose, appetite deregulation, insulin resistance, leptin resistance and hyperphagia, increasing the risk of obesity (Fig. 1 ). The fetus and newborn are exposed to an obese maternal environment during gestation or lactation, leading to programming of alterations in key genes involved in satiety. Some evidence coming from animal studies as described by Gupta et al. 2009 showed that maternal obesity induced by a high-fat diet prior to and during pregnancy alters leptin and insulin signaling and the expression of orexigenic and anorexigenic peptides in term fetal hypothalami in the rat [ ]. Otherwise high levels of leptin in maternal milk then lead to saturation of receptors present in the human gastrointestinal tract, triggering an opposite response resulting in leptin resistance. When combined with continuous exposure to increased levels of ghrelin and resistin, the orexigenic pathway could be activated by inducing expression of NPY and AgRP, favoring hyperphagia during the early stages of life [ ]. However, there does not exist enough information in humans about the effective integration of food and signal components in milk that must certainly be interacting in complex ways to regulate the food intake pathways in the infant. Evidence generated in animal models, such as the data reported by Glavas et al. 2010, suggests that leptin administration in postnatal mice throughout breast milk, downregulates NPY and stimulates anorectic proopiomelanocortin neurons [ ]. Also, Bernstein and Hinde 2016, in a longitudinal study, analyzed 59 milk samples from rhesus macaques. This study reported that milk from primiparous mothers contains lower epidermal growth factor (EGF) than multiparous mothers, and mothers of greater weight secreted milk with lower EGF and EGF-R (receptor of EGF), but higher transforming growth factor (TGF-β2). Additionally EGF and EGF-R were positively associated with infant body mass and growth rate [ ]. Power et al. 2016 also reported that adiponectin, EGF, TGF-β2, EGF-R and TGF-β2-RIII in milk samples from a Sumatran orangutan ( Pongo abelii ) and from a gorilla ( Gorilla gorilla ) are modified during lactation, for instance; adiponectin, EGF, and TGF-β2 concentration in the milk sample declined with infant age in orangutan and gorilla milks [ ]. However, the study of these bioactive molecules is more complex in populations living in unusually ecologically stressful conditions. In spite of this hypothesis, Quinn 2017 did not observe an association between milk leptin and adiponectin and infant growth in the rural Nubri sample (living at high altitude). Quinn discusses that external factors requiring increased metabolic investment may override hormonal signals in milk. Infants and toddlers living in Nubri (high pressure) likely have less energy available for growth given high infectious disease burdens and thermal stress, and consequently, these factors hide associations with milk born hormones [ ]. Fig. 1 Hypothesis explaining how the maternal metabolic status may alter infant metabolism, leading to weight gain and increasing the risk of obesity in childhood and adulthood. These alterations may be related with appetite deregulation. Hormones and physiological parameters that decrease during pregnancy of mothers with different nutritional conditions are shown in red, whereas events that are favored or increased are shown in blue. Finally, parameters that are maintained as normal are shown in green
On the other hand, decreased levels of adiponectin, obestatin and nesfatin may have a negative impact on the anorexigenic pathway, thus favoring increased food intake along with an increased risk of infant obesity. Although these hormones are secreted in breast milk, their role has not been fully elucidated in infant development. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the potential impact of the presence of these hormones in breast milk on child development. Accumulating evidence suggests that these bioactive compounds are important for growth, energy regulation and maturation of the neonatal gastrointestinal system [ , ]. We hypothesized that should be a homeostasis in their levels to carry out their specific functions, because a deregulation in those hormones in early life may promote obesity in adulthood or later stage .
Conclusions and Perspectives
Breast milk contains necessary nutrients and bioactive factors for infant health and development. The composition of breast milk varies according to stage of lactation and to the nutritional requirements of the infant. A cluster of metabolism-regulating hormones are secreted in human breast milk, including leptin, adiponectin, insulin, ghrelin, obestatin, resistin, apelin, nesfatin, irisin, GLP-1 and IGF-1, among others. These bioactive molecules can cross the intestinal barrier, possibly modifying infant metabolism. Perinatal nutrition may influence future health outcomes through metabolic programming. It is imperative to consider the role of maternal nutrition during gestation and lactation due to the potential consequences for the infant.
Although it is well known that these hormones appear to have an effect on maternal BMI and weight, only leptin, adiponectin, ghrelin and insulin levels in breast milk have been correlated with infant anthropometry. For instance, the data obtained by Ahuja 2012, showed a positive correlation between insulin concentration and maternal pre-pregnancy BMI [ ]. Also, it has been suggested that leptin, adiponectin, ghrelin and insulin likely have an influence on the regulation of metabolic pathways and postnatal growth and development of the different organs of the newborn. Despite these alterations, breast milk is still the best food for the newborn, regardless of the nutritional status of the mother, because formula continues to be associated with many more risks, including childhood obesity, type 1 and type 2 diabetes and leukemia [ ]. However, according to Field et al. 2017, the role for specific bioactive compounds in human breast milk and their effects on offspring is limited predominately by inadequate studies designs. The isolating studies of the effects of these compounds may require more stringent inclusion criteria to select the participants, considering that maternal factors (genetic, environmental, etc.) influence the composition of breast milk [ , ]. Therefore, it is important to carry out studies focused on the generation of knowledge of the role of all bioactive compounds secreted in human milk for interpreting, sources, and consequences of inter-individual variation in milk synthesis and the effects of milk signals remained on infant health and development involving the mother/child binomial to clarify the effect of these hormones on children by monitoring their growth, at least during the first year of life. Finally, recent evidence lead us to consider the impact of milk bioactive molecules on infant growth in unusually ecologically stressful conditions.
