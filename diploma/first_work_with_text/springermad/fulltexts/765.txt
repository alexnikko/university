Introduction
Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a rare primary immunodeficiency disease characterized by defective NADPH oxidase in neutrophils that leads to fatal bacterial and fungal infections [ ]. The estimated incidence rate is between 1/200,000 and 1/250,000 live births in the USA [ ]. Almost 60 years have passed since the first description of CGD by Robert A. Good and his colleagues [ ]. Recent advances in diagnosis and treatment of CGD have reduced mortality and improved patients’ life quality worldwide [ ]. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is still the only curative treatment since its first report in 1973 [ , , ]. Encouragingly, the global success rate of HSCT has increased to 96% [ ]. However, with the prophylactic use of antibiotics, interferon gamma, and antifungal treatment, the rate of severe bacterial and fungal infections without HSCT has also decreased dramatically [ , , ]. In contrast to other regions, CGD remains a great challenge in China for unclear reasons. We hypothesize that the mandatory vaccination of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) might have changed the nature course of the disease. Moreover, it is not clear if Chinese CGD patients have unique clinical features regarding both severe infections and inflammatory diseases [ , ]. In order to better understand the clinical features of CGD in China, we summarized the clinical characteristics, genotype, treatment, and prognosis of CGD in a large cohort of 169 patients recruited to a single center in Shanghai from 2004 to 2017.
Methods
All the patients who received the clinical diagnosis of CGD in our center from January 2004 to May 2017 were enrolled in the study. Before 2015, the diagnosis was made based on the defective respiratory burst detected by dihydrorhodamine-1,2,3 (DHR) test, decreased protein level of gp91 (flow cytometry-based extracellular staining with Moab 7D5), and mutations detected by Sanger sequencing of target genes ( CYBB , CYBA , NCF1 , and NCF2 ). Since 2015, Sanger sequencing was replaced by next-generation sequencing of a panel of previously identified immunodeficiency genes, which included almost all of the genes listed in the classification from the International Union of Immunodeficiency Society [ ]. We did not exclude MPO deficiency based on the result of DHR assay. When unreported mutations were found, the clinical diagnosis was made based on the combination of clinical manifestations, mutation prediction made by online mutation taster software [ ], result of DHR test, gp91 protein levels, and inheritance pattern. Electronic medical charts, including the first admission and follow-up visits, were reviewed. A single form was used to extract data from medical records. When recent updates were not recorded in the clinical charts, patients and their families were also interviewed through telephone calls.
Sanger sequencing of CYBB , CYBA , and NCF2 was performed on the entire coding DNA. However, the Sanger sequencing of NCF1 was different because of the two highly homologous NCF1 pseudogenes. We only sequenced exon 2 with primers previously described (2LB2-GTGCACACAGCAAAGCCTCT and 2RB2-CTAAGGTCCTTCCCAAAGGGT) since a common mutation (c.75-76delGT) at the beginning of exon 2 was reported to account for more than 95% reported [ ]. Patients with c.75-76delGT were detected when GTGT-containing sequence was absent from polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products encompassing exon 2. Other NCF1 mutations could not be detected by this method.
We collected data on gender, year of birth, age at onset, age at diagnosis, DHR assay result, molecular diagnosis, infections and other complications, and prognosis. Additional data on sites of infections, pathogen of infection, and non-infectious complications were collected from hospitalized patients. Results of chest CT scans were described as lung nodule, abscess, axillary/mediastinal/hilar lymphadenopathy, bronchiectasis, ground-glass opacity, consolidation, pleural effusion or thickening, chest wall extension, and scar formation [ ]. Bronchoscopy and gastroenterological endoscopy were performed on patients with medical indications. Additional protocols and results of HSCT were also recorded.
Definition of terms: Family history was defined as positive when any of the biological relatives suffered from symptoms indicating primary immunodeficiencies such as recurrent infections from early age and premature death from severe infections. Age at onset was defined as the age when severe/recurrent infections were noticed. Age at diagnosis was defined as the age when first abnormal DHR result was shown. Sites of infections were described as follows: lung, skin, lymph node, soft tissue, bone, liver, spleen, abdominal (abdominal abscess and peritonitis), blood stream, perianal, gastrointestinal tract, central nerve system, and urinary tract. Non-infectious complications included elevated levels of liver enzymes [ ], inflammatory bowel disease [ , ], and anemia.
Diagnostic criteria of BCG disease were described in previous publications [ , ]. In brief, BCG infections were categorized into three types: (1) local BCG disease: BCG abscess at the injection site with its size ≥ 10 × 10 mm, or severe ulceration; (2) regional disease: infections at any regional lymph nodes or other regional lesions beyond the vaccination site (e.g., ipsilateral axillary, supraclavicular, cervical, or upper arm glands); and (3) disseminated disease: infections found at more than one remote sites or from at least one blood or bone marrow culture. Definitive diagnosis was made when staining for acid-fast bacilli was positive. A “probable” diagnosis was made when local BCG disease developed following BCG vaccination without microbiological evidences. T-spot assay was used to help diagnosis of tuberculosis. PPD skin test (tuberculin skin test) was done with 5 units of purified protein derivative. PPD positivity was defined as an induration diameter of > 5 mm after 48–72 h.
Invasive fungal disease (IFD) was characterized as proven, probable, and possible IFD as described before [ ]. Results of G ((1–3)-β- d -glucan) tests and GM (galactomannan) tests were used as microbiological evidences for IFD. GM index of Aspergillus was defined as positive when > 0.5. Serum (1–3)-β- d -glucan (BG) was defined as positive when > 100 pg/ml.
Respiratory burst of neutrophil was measured by flow cytometry-based DHR test as described before [ ]. In brief, whole blood samples were incubated with DHR and stimulated with phorbol-12-myrismte-14-acetate (PMA) for 20 min before red blood cells were lysed with hemolysin. After stimulation and lysis, samples were immediately analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Stimulation index (SI) was defined as geometric mean of DHR from stimulated samples/geometric mean of DHR from unstimulated samples of the same individual.
The study was approved by the ethic committee of the Children’s Hospital of Fudan University. The data were entered with Epidata 3.1 and analyzed using Stata/SE 10.0 for Windows (StataCorp LP). The continual variable was displayed in medium (25th–75th). The categorical variable was displayed in percentile. When comparing the different types of CGDs, Wilcoxon rank-sum test and chi-square test or Fisher’s exact probability test was done on continual and categorical variables, respectively. P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Between January 2004 and May 2017, a total number of 169 CGD patients from 164 families were diagnosed in the Children’s Hospital of Fudan University. One hundred six patients were hospitalized for at least once. Times of hospitalization ranged from 1 to 19. 52.8% (56/106) of the patients were hospitalized once, 25.5% (27/106) were hospitalized twice, 11.3% (12/106) were hospitalized up to 4 times, and 10.4% (11/106) were hospitalized more than 4 times. In total, 252 times of hospitalization were recorded and reviewed. Hospitalization related to HSCT was reviewed separately. The medium duration of follow-up was 13 months (IQR 3.5–30) in 112 patients whose records were available.

Autosomal recessive CGD (AR-CGD) accounted for the minority of the patients (Table 3 ). Seven cases of CYBA mutations were identified, including five nonsense mutations and two missense mutations. Five cases of c.75-76delGT mutation in the NCF1 gene were identified. Seven cases of NCF2 gene mutations were identified, among which three were homozygous mutations and four were compound heterozygous mutations.

Comparison of Clinical Features Among Different Types of CGD
There was no significant difference between X-linked CGD and AR-CGD regarding the age at onset, age at diagnosis, lung infection, skin infection, and lymph node infection (Table 4 ). No difference was found between patients with missense CYBB mutations and other kinds of CYBB mutations in terms of their age at onset, age at diagnosis, lung infection, skin infection, and lymph node infection (Table 5 ). SI ranged from 0.8 to 27 in patents with CYBB mutations, including 65.3% (96/147) of the patients with SI ≤ 3. SI ranged from 2 to 10.5 in patients with CYBA mutations, including 42.8% (3/7) of the patients with SI ≤ 3. SI ranged from 5.3 to 60.5 in patients with NCF1 mutations; none of the patients had SI ≤ 3. SI ranged from 2.1 to 10 in patients with NCF2 mutations, including 33.3% (2/6) of the patients with SI ≤ 3. Overall, SI was slightly higher in AR-CGD.

Treatment
74.6% (97/130) of the patients received prophylactic sulfamethoxazole (SMZ), whereas 77.7% (101/130) of the patients received prophylactic γ-IFN therapy. Before 2014, only patients with fungal infections were treated with antifungal therapy. Since 2014, all patients were treated with antifungal therapy prophylactically. In total, 73.8% (96/130) of the patients received antifungal therapy. Moreover, 53.1% (69/130) of the patients were treated with antituberculosis therapy. Thirty-one patients underwent HSCT. Twenty-four patients received cord blood stem cell transplantation in our hospital since 2015. No one received granulocyte transfusions or gene therapy.
Prognosis
Among the 169 patients, the records of follow-up were available from 131 patients, whereas the rest were not followed up in our hospital. By the end of the study, 36.6% (48/131) of patients were deceased (Fig. 2 ). The overall medium survival time was 42.6 months (IQR 18.9–82.9), whereas the medium survival time was 42.3 months (IQR 18.5–82.6) for XL-CGD patients and 66.2 months (IQR 27.1–102.3) for AR-CGD patients. Among the 48 deceased patients, 42 did not receive HSCT. The medium age of death was 19.5 months (IQR 8–42) for the 42 patients who did not receive HSCT. Among them, 15 died of severe infections, including 2 with severe pneumonia and 13 with severe sepsis. Among the 13 deaths with sepsis, S. typhimurium was found in 1 case and Aspergillus was found in 2 cases. Cause of death was unclear for the other 27 patients. Fig. 2 Prognosis of 164 CGD patients born between 1991 and 2017
In total, 31 patients received HSCT, and the follow-up information was available for 28 of them. 21.4% (6/28) of the patients died, whereas 78.6% (22/28) survived. The medium age of death was 40 months. Four patients died of severe sepsis post transplantation, whereas the causes of death were unclear for the other 2 patients.
Discussion
We reported a total number of 169 cases of CGD diagnosed and treated in our center between the January of 2004 and the May of 2017. CYBB gene mutations accounted for 88.8% of the cases. The medium age of onset was 1 month old. The medium age of diagnosis was 8 months. The lung, skin, and lymph node were the main sites of infections. BCG disease was exceptionally common in this cohort, occurred in 59.2% (77/130) of the patients.
Previous clinical studies have shown that XL-CGD accounts for the majority of CGD cases. In a US study in 2000 [ ], XL-CGD accounted for 70% of the cases, AR-CGD accounted for 22% of the cases, and the remaining 8% of the cases were undetermined. In an Italian study in 2008 [ ], XL-CGD accounted for 65%, AR-CGD accounted for 10%, and the remaining 25% were undetermined. AR-CGD is more common in regions with high rates of consanguinity. For example, a study from Israel showed that the ratio of AR-CGD was 63% (24/38) [ ]. In our study, the ratio of XL-CGD was 88.8%, slightly higher than that previously reported. This might be caused by the extremely low levels of consanguinity in China. Moreover, only 33.9% of the patients had positive family history, which probably resulted from the “one child policy” and overall very small family size in China.
Genotypes of CGD have been previously reported to correlate with residual reactive oxygen intermediate (ROI) production and long-term survival [ ]. Nevertheless, we did not find genotype-phenotype correlation in this cohort regarding infections of the lung, skin, or lymph node. Patients with missense mutations of CYBB shared the same phenotypes with patients with other types of CYBB mutations. Although AR-CGD patients had higher SI, they did not display noticeably different phenotypes from XL-CGD patients, which is consistent with a previous study [ ]. Overall, there is no obvious difference in phenotypes among patients.
Crippled innate immunity plays a major role in the pathogenesis of infections in CGD. In our study, the medium age of onset of infection is 1 month, which was 6.5 months earlier than that of the report from Italy [ ]. This is probably caused by the mandatory BCG vaccination in China, which often results in the first episode of infection. The medium age of diagnosis was 8 months, earlier than that of the CGD patients worldwide (24–59 months) [ , , , , , ]. This might result from the improvement in diagnostic assays, including DHR test and molecular diagnosis. The distinctive clinical features of BCG diseases also served as early red flags. In addition, the increasing awareness of rare immunodeficiencies might contribute to the early diagnosis as well. The spectrum of pathogens in CGD is relatively narrow compare to some immunodeficiencies like SCID. The major pathogens are S. aureus , Serratia marcescens , Nocardia species, Burkholderia species, and Aspergillus species [ , , ]. The lung, liver, bone, lymph node, soft tissue, and skin were reported to be the most common sites of infections [ , ]. Similar to previous studies, the lung, lymph node, skin, gastrointestinal tract, and perianal were the most common sites of infections in our cohort. These infection sites were constantly exposed to the environments except for lymph nodes, suggesting that the natural barrier functions were damaged in these patients. Infections in draining lymph nodes and disseminated infections in the blood stream and distant organs were also common in these patients, indicating broader damages in their innate immunity functions.
In the regions where tuberculosis epidemic is high and BCG vaccination is performed in the general population, mycobacterial infections are common in CGD patients [ , , ]. BCG vaccination is mandatory in all newborns in China, which resulted in 59.2% of our patients developing BCG diseases. Besides CGD, any conditions that compromise T cell functions or the IFN-γ pathways could increase the risks of BCG diseases, including HIV infections, SCID, and IL12B, IL12RB1, STAT1, IFNGR1, IFNGR2, or CD40/CD40L deficiencies [ ]. Therefore, the use of BCG vaccine should be reconsidered a very high risk in these patients. For CGD patients, BCG and live salmonella vaccines are the only live vaccines that should be avoided. All other live attenuated vaccines are considered safe [ ]. Consistently, we did not observe any infections associated with other live vaccines.
The positive ratio of fungal culture was very low in our study. It might result from the low sensitivity of the method. However, indirect evidences, including GM tests, characteristic signs in chest CT scan, and patients’ responses to antifungal therapy, suggested a higher ratio of Aspergillus infections. We also reported low positive ratios of bacterial culture, probably due to the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.
In addition to infections, non-infectious symptoms were reported in up to 37.2% of CGD patients [ , , ], including inflammatory diseases and other complications. The gastrointestinal tract, lung, urogenital tract, and eye were the most common organs involved in inflammatory complications [ ]. In our study, anemia and impaired liver function were the two most common non-infectious complications. Liver involvement was reported to be common in CGD by previous studies, often indicated by abnormal liver enzyme levels [ ]. Multiple factors can affect the frequency of liver complications, including infections, granuloma formation, drug hepatotoxicity, and vascular lesions. Three patients were diagnosed to have ulcer colitis according to endoscopic findings. However, much more patients developed intestinal manifestations, mainly diarrhea, that did not respond to anti-infection treatments. Therefore, the ratio of non-infectious colitis might be underestimated in our cohort due to the limited accessibility to endoscopy.
The most common treatments were prophylactic antibiotics SMZ and IFN-γ. Antifungal therapy was also frequently used to treat or prevent fungal infections. Although intense anti-tuberculosis therapy was used on patients with BCG diseases, its effect was limited. HSCT remains the only curative treatment for these patients. Thirty-one patients received HSCT, among whom 24 received HSCT in our hospital since 2015. We achieved similar survival rate as previously reported [ , , , , ]. With the improvement in conditioning regimens, including GVHD prophylaxis, high-resolution sequence-based matching, pre-transplantation management, peri-transplantation management, and post-transplantation management [ ], we believe that the success rate will further improve.
The overall mortality rate was 36.6% in our cohort. Currently, the overall survival rate of CGD is around 90%, stretching well into adulthood [ ]. Clinical centers around the world have reported drastically different mortality rates in CGD patients (6–28.9%) [ , , , , , ]. The major factors of mortality are managing strategy, compliance, regular prophylactic use of TMP-SMZ, antifungal therapy, IFN-γ therapy soon after diagnosis, and success rate of HSCT [ , , , , ]. Severe infection was the main cause of death, especially severe sepsis and Aspergillus species infections. The production of residual ROI is a predictive marker of survival [ ]. Here, we reported a higher mortality rate than in other countries, although the main cause of death was still severe infections, including BCG infections.
The main limitation of our study, including the high dropout rate and incomplete clinical data, was due to its retrospective nature. We consider the data on infections representative since we were able to collect data from 80% of the patients (130/169). Another limitation of this study was the lack of microbiology evidences in infections, including the low positive ratio of bacterial and fungal culture, as well as the identification of BCG strains. Most of the infections were diagnosed based on clinical presentation and radiological results. Therefore, we propose to start a prospective study on CGD patients to better understand the disease.
In summary, we reported a large cohort of CGD patients diagnosed and treated in our clinical center in Shanghai in the last 12 years. Our cohort illustrated several unique clinical features mainly associated with BCG diseases. Non-infectious manifestations, including impaired liver function and anemia, were also common. Mortality was high in this cohort regardless of the increasing accessibility to HSCT. Based on this study, we propose that future work should focus on the prevention of BCG infections, efficient treatment of severe infections, and improving HSCT.
