Introduction
Percutaneous renal biopsy is a commonly performed diagnostic exam that guides decision-making for children with renal disease [ ]. Complications following renal biopsies range from minor, such as small perinephric hematomas, to major, such as large hematomas that require blood transfusion. The Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) published guidelines state that major complications resulting from image-guided percutaneous biopsies should not exceed a 2% threshold [ ]. Major complications in the pediatric population are documented in the literature and range from 0% to 10% [ , , , , , ].
The use of real-time US guidance for renal biopsies has increased steadily over the last two decades. According to data derived from Medicare part B, between 1994 and 2012 the number of renal biopsies performed by radiologists increased by 236% [ ]. During the same time period nephrologists experienced only a 12% increase in the number renal biopsies performed [ ]. Despite the growth in real-time image-guided procedures performed by radiologists, biopsies performed using US-guided pre-procedure skin-marking remain common among nephrologists and other non-radiologists [ , ]. Approximately 50% of nephrology training programs perform renal biopsies using US-guided pre-procedure skin-marking [ ]. Studies comparing complications between the techniques have focused mainly on adults or small cohorts of pediatric patients [ ]. Additionally, few larger studies have clearly delineated criteria used to diagnose complications, and these studies have not exclusively focused on outcomes regarding varied biopsy techniques [ ]. The purpose of this study is to compare complication rates from percutaneous renal biopsies using real-time US guidance versus pre-procedural US-aided skin-marking in a large cohort of children and young adults.
Materials and methods
Our institutional review board approved this retrospective study, which complied with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The need for written informed consent was waived. Using the electronic medical record, we retrospectively identified consecutive children and young adults who underwent a percutaneous renal biopsy at a tertiary-care academic medical center between Jan. 1, 2012, and Dec. 31, 2016. Patients underwent a renal biopsy with either real-time US guidance or pre-procedural US-aided skin-marking. Real-time US-guided biopsies were performed by pediatric interventional radiologists (post-fellowship experience: 2–21 years; mean: 8.5 years) in the interventional radiology suite. Pre-procedure US-aided skin-marking biopsies were performed by nephrologists (post-fellowship experience: 2–30 years; mean: 10.8 years) in the gastrointestinal surgical suite. Patients were not randomized to either group, and selection was based on provider referral (by the nephrologist) and service availability.
We recorded patient age, gender, date of procedure, laboratory screening values, pathology reports, biopsy techniques and post-biopsy complications. We tracked medical records for a surveillance period of 30 days post-procedure to record complications such as gross hematuria, abdominal pain, administration of blood products, evidence of hematoma noted on follow-up imaging, escalation of care and subsequent visits to the emergency department. Procedure-related complications were categorized according to the SIR grading criteria, with categories A and B designated as minor and categories C, D and E designated as major (Table 1 ) [ ]. Table 1 Society of Interventional Radiology classification for post-biopsy complications Minor complications A No therapy, no consequences B Nominal therapy, no consequences, includes overnight admission for observation only Major complications C Require therapy, <48 h hospitalization D Require major therapy, >48 h hospitalization E Permanent adverse sequela F Result in death
Real-time ultrasound-guided renal biopsy
Real-time US-guided renal biopsies were performed under general anesthesia. Patients were positioned appropriately on the table and the site prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. One percent lidocaine was used for local anesthesia. Under direct real-time US guidance, a core needle biopsy needle (16-gauge or 18-gauge; Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN, and Argon Medical, Plano, TX) was advanced into the kidney. Core needle samples were obtained under direct US visualization. The samples were handed directly to a pathologist who assessed sample adequacy. Additional samples were obtained until it was deemed sufficient by the pathologist. A limited ultrasound was then performed of the kidney to assess for immediate post-procedure complications. The patient was then placed supine in recovery and admitted to the hospital for overnight observation or returned to the designated inpatient bed.
Pre-procedure ultrasound-aided skin-marking technique
Patients were positioned prone on the table for native kidney biopsies and supine for transplant kidney biopsies. A limited ultrasound of the kidney was performed by a sonographer to evaluate kidney position and depth from skin surface, and to identify any intervening vessels. The access site was then marked and the site prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. One percent lidocaine was used for local anesthesia and moderate sedation was achieved with 1–5 mg intravenous midazolam and 25–50 mcg intravenous fentanyl (depending on age and weight). Through the previously marked site, an 18-gauge core biopsy needle (Becton, Dickinson and Co., Franklin Lakes, NJ) was advanced through the skin and toward the kidney. Core needle samples were obtained and handed to a pathologist to verify renal tissues and assess sample adequacy. Samples were obtained until the pathologist declared there was sufficient tissue. A limited ultrasound was then performed of the kidney to assess for immediate post-procedure complications. The patient was then instructed to lie supine and was either admitted to the hospital for overnight observation or returned to an inpatient bed.
Peri-procedural management
All renal biopsies in the study’s total cohort were ordered by the referring patient’s nephrologist. The nephrologist determined whether the procedure would be conducted in interventional radiology with real-time US guidance or in the gastrointestinal suite with pre-procedure US-aided skin-marking. Providers generally referred patients with an intraperitoneal transplanted kidney, solitary kidney, or unusual renal or urological anatomy, as well as obese/overweight patients, children younger than 4 years, and medically complicated patients to interventional radiology. Institutional protocols were followed regarding pre-biopsy screening, consisting of stable hemoglobin and international normalized ratio (INR)<1.5. Patients with INR>1.5 were corrected with fresh frozen plasma.
Post-procedural management consisted of patients either admitted for 23 h of observation or returned to the inpatient floor and included bed rest for 23 h; limited bathroom privileges; and vitals such as temperature, heart rate and blood pressure monitored every 4 h. Intake and outtake as well as the patient weight were monitored daily. The patient’s nephrologist was notified if the patient experienced any of the following: abdominal pain, gross hematuria, blood pressure >150/100 mmHg or <90/50 mmHg, oral temperature >101° Fahrenheit, heart rate >150 bpm or <60 bpm. If the nephrologist suspected bleeding post biopsy because of symptoms such as pain at biopsy site, gross hematuria or abdominal pain, follow-up labs and imaging were conducted. Upon discharge, all patients were provided standardized discharge instructions that included limited physical activity 2 weeks post discharge, specific diet recommendations, and instructions on when to call the nephrologist (redness or pain as biopsy site, fever >102° F [oral], gross hematuria).
Statistical analysis
We conducted data analysis using Minitab software (version 17; Minitab Inc., State College, PA). A priori power analysis using a risk-adjusted model assuming a 7% complication rate indicated a total sample size of 643–714 procedures was required to detect a difference in complications between the groups, given a real difference existed (effect size: 0.8). We compared complications between the groups using the Fisher exact test. We compared continuous variables using the Student’s t test and categorical variables using a chi-squared analysis. We performed multivariate logistic regression to analyze predictors of complications. The dependent variable included the presence of a complication, and predictor variables included age, gender, body mass index, pre-procedure hemoglobin, platelets, international normalized ratio, and number of cores, needle size, and use of real-time US guidance. P -values of <0.05 were considered significant.
Results
Patient characteristics
The study cohort consisted of 701 renal biopsy procedures conducted in 553 patients. Real-time US guidance was used for 313 biopsies in 233 patients (age range 0–18 years, mean 9.9±5.2 years) and pre-procedure US-aided skin-marking was used for 388 in biopsies in 320 patients (age range 2–18 years, mean 11.6±4.4 years). Diagnostic yield was obtained in all biopsies with real-time US guidance (median cores=2.0; interquartile range [IQR]=1.0) and in 386/388 (99.5%) biopsies using pre-procedure US-aided skin-marking, P =0.505 (mean cores=3.0; IQR=1.0). The two patients without diagnostic yield were subsequently re-biopsied using real-time US guidance in the interventional radiology suite.
Demographic and patient pre-procedural laboratory values for the two groups were compared (Table 2 ). Patient characteristics between the groups differed in both age and reason for exam; the real-time US-guided group was younger and comprised a higher percentage of transplant patients. The size of needle also varied by group (Table 3 ). The number of cores taken per biopsy remained lower for the real-time US-guided group than for the pre-procedure US-aided skin-marking group. Overall there were significant differences between the groups because the patients included were not randomized to either the real-time US-guided or the US-aided skin-marking group.

Complications
Overall, 254/701 (36%) complications were detected in the study cohort — 56/313 (18%) in the real-time US guidance group and 198/388 (51%) in the pre-procedure US-aided skin-marking group ( P <0.001). In the real-time US group, 39/56 (70%) complications were SIR A and 8/56 (14%) SIR B. In the pre-procedure US-aided skin-marking group, 139/198 (70%) complications resulted in SIR A and 47/198 (24%) SIR B. The groups were statistically different for both SIR A ( P <0.001) and SIR B ( P <0.001) complications.
There was no detectable difference in major complications between the groups ( P =0.866). The real-time US-guided group consisted of 6/56 (11%) SIR C and 3/56 (5%) SIR D, while the pre-procedure US-aided skin-marking group consisted of 11/198 (6%) SIR C and 1/198 (1%) SIR D. Overall, the majority of the major complications were categorized as SIR C 17/21 (81%). Specifically, these complications consisted of perinephric hematomas post-biopsy, resulting in a drop in hemoglobin that required the administration of blood products (determined by the nephrologist). Among the SIR C complications, 16/17 (94%) were performed with an 18-gauge needle, while 1/17 (6%) was performed with a 16-gauge needle. Indication for biopsy regarding SIR C complications consisted of proteinuria (8/17; 47%), other (4/17; 24%), lupus nephritis (2/17; 12%) and transplant (3/17; 18%).
Most cases included in this study were transplant biopsies. Among transplant biopsies, there was an 18% (51/276) total complication rate in biopsies performed with real-time US guidance compared to 52% (179/341) in the US-guided pre-procedure skin-marking group ( P <.0001).
Among native biopsies, there was a 14% (5/36) total complication rate in native renal biopsies performed with real-time US guidance compared to a 40% (19/48) total complication rate with US-guided pre-procedure skin-marking ( P =0.014).
There were four complications categorized as SIR D. All these patients were inpatient, and biopsies were performed with an 18-gauge needle. Indications were proteinuria, lupus nephritis, transplant and other. Two patients experienced pseudoaneurysms, of which the first patient experienced a rapid drop in hemoglobin after the renal biopsy. This resulted in linear contrast pooling and was resolved with coil embolization. The second patient experienced an acute drop in hemoglobin 7 days post-biopsy. The patient was in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) for acute chronic renal failure and was on a heparin drip to treat multiple deep vein thrombi. Ultrasound at 7 days demonstrated hemoperitoneum and a large subcapsular hematoma; subsequent embolization was successfully performed. The third patient experienced a drop in hemoglobin that required an escalation in care, and the patient was admitted to the PICU. Blood products were administered, follow-up imaging was conducted with CT and ultrasound and reflected dependent echogenic debris within the urinary bladder representative of hemorrhage. The patient was closely monitored and the complications resolved. The fourth patient demonstrated moderate bleeding into the collection system on the immediate post-biopsy ultrasound examination. The patient was further evaluated with a follow-up US examination that demonstrated a hemorrhagic clot within the kidney collection system; a radiologic intervention placing a nephroureteral stent was successfully completed.
Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated that the use of pre-procedure US-aided skin-marking was the most significant predictor for complications (Table 4 ). The odds of developing a complication with the pre-procedure US-aided skin-marking technique were 6.30 times higher (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.86, 10.27) than with the real-time US-guided technique.

Discussion
This study compared post-procedure complications following percutaneous renal biopsies using two different techniques at a single institution. The study found that biopsies performed using real-time US guidance with general anesthesia result in fewer total complications compared to biopsies performed under moderate sedation using pre-procedure US-aided skin-marking. However, no difference was detected in the incidence of major complications.
Few studies have directly compared these techniques in the literature. Maya et al. [ ] retrospectively studied 129 native renal biopsies in adult; 65 were US-guided and 64 were performed with the pre-procedure US-aided skin-marking technique. The study excluded patients with transplanted kidneys. Similarly, Maya et al. [ ] found the real-time US-guided technique to be superior to the pre-procedure US-aided skin-marking technique because the former provided higher diagnostic yield and fewer major complications. The authors documented a complication rate of 8% (5/65) in the US-guided group and 19% (12/64) in the pre-procedure US-aided skin-marking technique. Further, Prasad et al. [ ] compared 1,510 biopsies in adults using pre-procedure US-aided skin-marking to 628 biopsies using real-time US guidance. Their study demonstrated a 6% (95/1,510) major complication rate in the pre-procedure US-aided skin-marking group compared to 2% (13/628) in the real-time US guidance group, with a relative risk for major complications of 3.04.
Compared to these studies, our study found relatively few major complications in the overall cohort, 21 in 701 total biopsies (3%). No difference was detected in major complication rates between the groups. The pre-procedure US-aided skin-marking group yielded a 3.1% major complication rate and the real-time US-guided group yielded a rate of 2.9%. Major complication rates for both groups in this study were greater than the major complication rate threshold of 2% that is recommended by the SIR [ ].
Other studies have reported minor complication rates ranging from 8% to 70% [ , , ]. Our study’s overall minor complication rate was 33%. A significant difference in minor complications (SIR A and B) was detected between the groups, with fewer minor complications in the real-time US guidance group. All SIR A complications included either the visualization of a small perinephric hematoma on the post-procedure US (determined by a radiologist in all cases, regardless of group) or gross hematuria. However, these minor complications had no adverse effects on the patients.
Fewer SIR B complications were detected in the real-time US-guided group. In these procedure-related complications (SIR B), the patient sought additional medical care through an emergency center or clinic visit and received follow-up imaging as a result. The patient either called the nephrologist first and the nephrologist recommended the patient seek emergency medical care or the patient decided to seek medical care; both scenarios corresponded with the standardized discharge instructions all patients received regardless of group. The most common reasons the patients sought additional medical care included flank pain, gross hematuria and dizziness. While these complications did not result in serious health consequences, the patients obtained unplanned medical care related to the renal biopsy.
In this study, we noted differences in the types of patients referred to interventional radiology for a real-time US-guided renal biopsy compared to those referred for pre-procedure skin-marking biopsy conducted by nephrology. Patients in interventional radiology tended to be younger than those undergoing renal biopsies by nephrology. The number of cores taken during the procedure was also smaller when completed in interventional radiology when compared to nephrology. Needle gauge also differed by renal biopsy group — biopsies performed in the pre-procedure skin-marking group exclusively utilized an 18-gauge needle. Renal biopsies performed in the real-time US guidance group were completed using either an 18-gauge needle or a 16-gauge needle. Needle size has been shown to increase the risk of complications after renal biopsy [ ]. Antunes et al. [ ] compared complications of US-guided percutaneous renal biopsies performed with an 18-gauge needle versus a 16-gauge needle and determined that the larger needle size was associated with an increased complication rate (OR 5.1; 95% CI 1.7, 15.4). It is hypothesized that needle size, younger age and number of cores have some effect on the outcomes related to post-procedure complications because the patients referred to interventional radiology were inherently at a higher complication risk than those referred for the pre-procedure US-aided skin-marking by nephrology.
This study has several limitations. It is a retrospective observational review of a single center, thereby limiting generalizability. The study groups differed in age and body mass index, which might have introduced bias. Biopsies in younger patients were more likely to be performed using real-time US guidance compared to the pre-procedure US-aided skin-marking technique. Technical details such as needle size and number of cores obtained also differed between the groups, which also might have biased the results. Types of sedation differed between the groups: general anesthesia was used in the real-time US-guidance group, whereas moderate sedation was used in the pre-procedure US-aided skin-marking group; however no anesthesia complications were detected in this study. Finally, sample size was calculated to detect an overall difference in complications and not the small difference in major complications (SIR C and D).
Conclusion
This study compared complications from percutaneous renal biopsies performed using real-time US guidance and pre-procedure US-aided skin-marking techniques in a pediatric population. Major complications in this study were few, and no difference was detected between the two groups regarding major complications. Minor complications including those that required follow-up medical care were significantly higher among patients in the pre-procedure US-aided skin-marking group compared to the real-time US-guided biopsy group.
