Introduction
Electrofishing method is often used by fishery biologists to sample fish populations in small freshwater streams and rivers. Electrofishing has been approved scientifically valid and economically feasible techniques for sampling fishes in streams which is useful in all aspects of fishery management (Bacon and Youngson ). Some authors are expressed that electrofishing can alter blood constituents (Mesa and Schreck ; Maule and Mesa ; Mitton and McDonald ; Barton and Grosh ; Dolan and Miranda ), reduce growth rate (Dwyer and White ; Thompson et al. ), increase metabolic and coughing rates (Vosilene ), and change fish behavior (Mesa and Schreck ). The physiological effects of electricity on fish include a variety of sublethal changes in blood chemistry (Van Waarde and Kesbeke ; Dolan and Miranda ; Meka and McCormick ). While physical damage from electrofishing may appear obvious, acute physiological disturbances in fish are not detected easily (Barton and Dwyer ). Numerous studies have examined the effects of electrofishing on fishes. For example, Burns and Lantz (Burns and Lantz ) reported physiological effects of electrofishing on Largemouth Bass (Micropterus salmoides) . In addition, Barton and Grosh (Barton and Grosh ) have documented the effects of AC electroshock on blood features in juvenile rainbow trout. The aim of this study was to evaluate the immediate physiological response of electrofishing on wild carp blood factors.
Materials and methods
Fish sampling
The present study was carried out in January 2011, at Gorgan University of Agricultural and Natural Resources aquaculture center. The wild carp was provided from Woshmgir Dam and transferred to aquaculture center. In order to adapt to laboratory condition and recovery from handling, ten fish (34.6 ± 4 g and 14.3 ± 1.07 cm) were stored at 1 m 3 fiberglass tank with 50 L water (flow rate 10 L/h, dissolved oxygen 6.3, and pH 7.8). During acclimation, fish were fed with commercial diet for 4 weeks. Electrical conductivity and water temperature were 0.7 ds/m and 18–23 °C, respectively. Then, fish randomly divided into 1 m 3 fiberglass tank (treatment and control). One week after, fish were treated by electroshocker (D.C. at 200 V., 50 Hz frequencies and one anode) for 5 s. Immediately after blood collection (by means of caudal vein via syringes), samples of each group (~ 2 ml) were collected and put into heparinized (for hematology) and nonheparinized (for serum chemistry) tubes. Samples were placed on ice and analyses were made within 2–3 h. Serum was separated by centrifugation at 10000 rpm for 10 min (Frick et al. ) and stored in − 20 °C prior to analysis.
Serum chemistry
Serum cortisol levels were determined by ELISA method according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Monobind, Inc., 1 ). The glucose, lactate, triglyceride, cholesterol, total bilirubin, creatinine, total protein, albumin, Cl − , Na + , K + , Mg 2+ , and Ca 2+ concentrations were measured colorimetrically using kits supplied by Pars Azmun diagnostics, Karaj, Iran. The globulin and albumin-globulin ratio were calculated according to Coles ( ). All measurements were carried out in duplicates for each sample.
Hematology
Whole blood hemoglobin (Hb) concentration was estimated from the cyanmethemoglobin derivative as recommended for fish blood (Coburn and Fischer ). Hematocrit (Hct) values were obtained by centrifuging samples in 75 ml microhematocrit tubes. Erythrocyte and leukocyte counts were estimated using a Neubauer chamber. Differential leukocyte count was performed with blood smears stained with Giemsa solution. The smears (two slides per fish) were examined by light microscopy (Olympus, 2 ) under oil immersion at × 100 magnification. Erythrocyte indices including mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) were measured using standard techniques.
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed by independent-samples t test. Significant level established at 0.05 levels. All statistical analyses were done using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) program for Windows (v. 16.0). Data are presented as mean ± SEM.
Results
The initial, final chemical and hematological parameters of wild carp captured by electrofishing are shown in Tables 1 and 2 , respectively. The results showed that short-term shock via electrofishing has significant adverse effects on WBC, cortisol, glucose, albumin, albumin: globulin ratio, globulin, and total protein levels. Also, electrofishing caused an increase in MCHC, WBC, monocyte, neutrophil, eosonophil, cortisol, glucose, cholesterol, albumin, albumin: globulin ratio, Ca 2+ , and Cl − values. A decrease in values of RBC, MCV, MCH, lymphocyte, hemoglobin, hematocrit, lactate, triglyceride, total protein, globulin, Mg 2+ , and Na + was observed.

Discussion
A review on blood parameters during acute and chronic stress showed changes in these parameters compared to resting condition, but some changes arose faster and in larger scale. One of the prominent stress responses to capture, handling, and captivity is increase the plasma cortisol levels; many of bonny fishes showed rapidly and partly large increase at plasma cortisol levels when subjected to acute physical stress (Barton and Iwama ; Meka and McCormick ). In striped bass Morone saxatilis , 3.5-fold increase in cortisol up to 400 ng/ml was observed after handling stress (Cech et al. ). Blood cortisol levels of R. frisii kutum captured by Gillnet and beach seine were 750.50 ± 354.40 and 667.83 ± 355.59 ng/ml, respectively (Gharache et al. ). In the present study, cortisol levels were 6.29 ± 2.77 and 98.15 ± 1.14 ng/ml, before and after electrofishing, respectively and a 16-fold increase were observed in blood cortisol levels which is in accordance with other published data. The glucose level in blood has been used as reliable stress indicator (Wedemeyer and McLeay ; Wells et al. ; Bracewell et al. ). Plasma glucose increased in fish that subjected to stress, as a result of increase in the blood catecholamins (Wedemeyer ) and increase in blood glucose is an ordinary stress response (Frisch and Anderson ). Bracewell et al. ( ) exposed chub ( Leuciscus cephalus ) to simulated pulse direct current (PDC) electrofishing and found plasma glucose and blood lactate to be significantly higher than that of the controls within 0.5 h of treatment. These levels peaked with 2 h and returned to baseline level within 8 h. The onset of hyperglycemia in response to exhaustive exercise, air exposure, capture, transport, induction through injection (of catecholamins) handling, and confinement stress has been mentioned in numerous studies on teleosts (Arends et al. ; Frisch and Anderson ; Barton ; Sulikowski and Howell ) and elasmobranchs (Wells et al. ; Torres et al. ; Hoffmayer and Parsons ). Blood glucose levels of R. frisii kutum captured by gill net and beach seine were 140.56 ± 31.52 and 113.31 ± 58.73 mg/dl, respectively (Gharache et al. ). The acute stress induced decrease in total protein level (Jeney et al. ; Wang and King ; Biswas et al. ). Wedemeyer ( ) found that increase in blood plasma proteins of rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss ) during capture, handling, and sampling is associated with secretion of catecholamine, adrenaline, and nor-adrenaline in response to physical disturbance. Gbore et al. ( ) have shown that total protein levels of Tilapia zillii and Clarias gariepinus fingerlings significantly influenced by handling and transportation stress.
Hematological parameters could identify in many diseases, inadequacy, and abnormal conditions. Major shifts in the hemograms are found in fish exposure to acute or chronic stress (Dobsikova et al. ). Therefore, evaluation of hematological parameters could potentially offer a diagram of physiological situation in fish. Since applied standpoint number of red blood cell, hematocrit and hemoglobin have been served for nomination of the capacity of oxygen transportation by the blood and survey the ability of animals for opposition with metabolic requirement to oxygen. In the present study, no significant differences ( p > 0.05) were observed in red blood cell number, hematocrit, and hemoglobin between treated groups. Decrease in hematocrit values after stress was reported in other species such as Redbelly tilapia, Tilapia zilli , and African sharptooth catfish, Clarias gariepinus (Gbore et al. ). In regard to hemoglobin, Hattingh and van pletzen (Hattingh and Van Pletzen ) reported that hemoglobin concentration decreased during capture and transportation, suggesting indicated changes in blood osmolality. Based on observation, electrofishing affects on blood transport capacity of oxygen and caused decrease on the capacity of oxygen transportation in blood; however, these changes were not significant compared to control group, but if continue, could be harmful for survival.
White blood cell has been reported to be a function of the immunity and the animal resistance to some vulnerable diseases (Gbore et al. ). In the current research, leukocyte number showed significant difference in treatment and control group, respectively. Increasing the leukocyte number caused by stress may be due to leukocyte migration from spleen to blood stream (Barcellos et al. ; Nikoo et al. ). Moreover, it is noteworthy that supra acute tendency caused to leukocyte migration from the head kidney to blood stream (Ortuno et al. ; Dobsikova et al. ). Nikoo et al. ( ) found that there is slight change in leukocyte number during captivity of Rutilus frisii kutum . A similar result was reported in Jandia ( Rhamdia quelen ) (Barcellos et al. ) and Limnada limnada (Nikoo et al. ).
Conclusion
In conclusion, electrofishing induces a general stress response in wild carp that as, in most cases, comparable with that found in other species subjected to the same type of stressor. Additionally, our results suggesting electrofishing do not provoke any long-term detrimental effect on chub in terms of blood glucose of lactate levels. Although, other indicators of stress such as blood cortisol levels provide evidence which is supporting this conclusion. However, whether this conclusion could be applied to other cyprinids requires further investigation.
