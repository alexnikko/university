INTRODUCTION
There has been growing interest in polymer strip films in recent years due to their advantages over other solid dosage forms ( , ). Strip films have proved to be promising platforms for oral delivery of drugs, because of their flexibility, cost-effective manufacturing, and superior patient compliance ( , ). Strip films loaded with water-soluble drugs have already hit the market, e.g ., Zuplenz® from MonSol Rx®, Gas-X® from Novartis®, and RapidFilms® from Labtec®. However, until recently, research on the incorporation of different poorly water-soluble drugs in strip films without compromising drug stability and release rate was sparse ( , ). It has been demonstrated that film preparation using slurry casting with the incorporation of drug nanoparticles may have significant advantages over other methods such as solvent casting and hot melt extrusion (HME) ( , ). In slurry casting, an aqueous drug nanosuspension is mixed with an aqueous polymer–plasticizer solution followed by casting and drying ( , ). The resulting films have shown good critical quality attributes (CQAs) such as drug content uniformity and dissolution. They proved to be robust platforms for oral delivery of poorly water-soluble drugs ( , , , , , , ). A more recent development in the incorporation of poorly water-soluble drugs in strip films is the use of micronized-coated drug particles ( ). This simpler method does not require separate nanosuspension preparation and avoids the corresponding issues with media milling and the use of surfactants ( ). In this method, micronized drug powders are dry coated with silica and directly mixed with the polymer–plasticizer solution. Silica coating enhances the flow properties of the drug, prevents the agglomeration of micronized drug powders, and preserves the desired CQAs of the resulting strip films ( ). After casting the viscous precursor drug suspension, the wet films are dried to remove the excess moisture and obtain the desired film thickness.
A critical aspect of strip film production is the drying process. Drying has significant impact on the final morphology of the film and its performance. Energy minimization and improving product quality are the main goals of drying process design ( ). Convective drying at gentle process conditions can be used to obtain quality strip films with the desired moisture content and thickness ( ). Low moisture content is necessary to ensure long-term stability of strip films ( ). Generally, water content may affect degradation of the drug and microbial growth of the drug product and can be a potential CQA. Moreover, moisture could affect the mechanical properties of the films and downstream processing such as packaging. Finally, a quantitative description of the drying kinetics and elucidation of the underlying drying mechanisms is important for optimal design and control of the process.
Different approaches have been used to model the drying behavior of polymer films ( , , , , , , , , , ). One approach is to use purely empirical models that fit the drying data without considering the underlying physics ( , ). Such approaches are purely descriptive and do not provide any insight into the drying mechanisms. Another approach is to use detailed transport models, considering the diffusion and evaporation of the solvent as well as the shrinkage of the film, to predict the final moisture content and thickness ( , , , , , ). Being more elaborate and detailed, they yield mechanistic information about the drying process and can be predictive. However, they are computationally more expensive and usually they are not amenable to practical use for process control purposes. Moreover, the adoption of such complicated models by pharmaceutical industry practitioners for formulation–process development is expected to be limited.
In view of the pros and cons of both empirical and detailed transport-based models, the use of semi-empirical models ( , ) appears to be a practical, balanced approach that does not require significant computational resources. These models are not computationally intensive and they are derived based on some assumptions regarding the underlying physics. The underlying physics of drying of viscous polymer films involves two primary drying periods: constant-rate and falling-rate periods ( ). In the constant-rate period, drying process is controlled by external mass transfer, which depends on the air flow and physicochemical characteristics of the system. In the falling-rate period, the process is controlled by the intra-film diffusion of the solvent. Susarla et al . ( ) calculated the drying rate flux using a differential method of analysis and used linear regression to fit the flux as a function of moisture for strip films loaded with drug nanoparticles. Their model delineated a falling rate period but failed to capture the transition from constant rate to falling rate period quantitatively. Also, they fitted these two regions separately and somewhat arbitrarily because a critical moisture content for the transition was not quantified. Velaga et al . ( ) used Hill’s equation, which has been applied in biochemical kinetics, to obtain the drying rate and fit the data for their strip films without drug. Note that these two models ( , ) only fitted the experimental data; neither of them was shown to have any predictive capability.
Unlike previous studies e.g ., ( , ), this study assesses the capabilities of a simple, three-parameter, semi-empirical, rate-based model to describe, simulate, and predict evolution of moisture in strip films with different thicknesses during convective drying under a variety of process conditions. To this end, a custom-made batch drying setup was used to measure the time-wise variation of moisture during the convective drying of wet polymer strip films loaded with dry silica-coated micronized griseofulvin (GF). Strip films were formulated with hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC; Methocel E15-LV), water, glycerin, and micronized-coated drug particles (griseofulvin). Wet films with two different thicknesses were dried at various air velocities–temperatures through a full-factorial design of experiments (DoE). An integral method of analysis, which is more accurate than the differential analysis used in ref. ( ), was implemented by which the model parameters were estimated via a coupled optimizer–ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver. Not only does the model delineate two drying periods and the transition between them explicitly and quantitatively but also it describes the impact of critical process parameters (CPPs) such as air velocity, temperature, and initial wet film thickness on the drying kinetics and predicts the time-wise variation of moisture well. The predictive capability of the model was assessed by using one set of model parameter estimates to predict the drying kinetics for two different wet film thicknesses in the selected process conditions. The limitations of the model and possibilities for further improvement of this simple model are discussed. It is hoped that this work may be used in the future to determine a suitable design space and control strategies for continuous manufacturing of strip films loaded with silica-coated poorly water-soluble drugs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
In the preparation of polymer strip films, griseofulvin (GF; Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO), an antifungal drug was used as a model BCS (Biopharmaceutical Classification System) class II drug. Pharmaceutical grade amorphous hydrophilic silica (M5P, Cabot Corporation, MA) with a nominal particle size of 16 nm was utilized as the coating material of the drug particles. Low molecular weight hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC; Methocel E15 Premium LV, The Dow Chemical Company, Midland, MI) as a film former and glycerin (Sigma-Aldrich) as a plasticizer were used. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (GFS Chemicals) was used as surfactant in content uniformity test.
Methods
Preparation of Micronized-Coated API
Simultaneous micronization and dry coating technique used in this study was adapted from a previous work ( , ). As-received griseofulvin powder and M5P silica were pre-mixed with a ratio of 97:3 using Laboratory Resonant Acoustic Mixer (LabRAM; Resodyn Acoustic Mixers, Inc., Butte, MT). LabRAM was operated at 61 Hz with 75-G acceleration for 5 min. This pre-mixture was fed at 1 g/min into a fluidized energy mill (FEM; qualification model, Sturtevant Inc., Hanover, MA) for simultaneous coating and micronization of GF. Feeding pressure was 65 psi, while grinding pressure was 60 psi throughout the process. The particle size of micronized-coated GF (MC-GF) was measured using Rodos/Helos system (Sympatec, NJ, USA). The micronized-coated particles had a volume median diameter ( d 50 ) of 5.64 μm.
Preparation of the Film Precursor Suspension
An aqueous polymer solution with a composition of 14% HPMC E15 and 4% glycerin was prepared by first adding glycerin into the water at 35–40°C. After the solution was heated to 90°C, HPMC powder was added slowly with continuous stirring. Following the addition of HPMC, the solution cooled down slowly to room temperature. Polymer solution and MC-GF were mixed with a ratio of 48:1 and defoamed using planetary centrifugal mixer (Thinky ARE-310, Laguna Hills, CA, USA). They were mixed at 2000 rpm for 2 min, and defoamed at 2200 rpm for 30 s, then the suspension was left till all the bubbles were removed. The theoretical final compositions of the wet films and the dried film are shown in Table I .

Wet Film Casting and Drying
Drying data were collected using a custom-built batch setup, which can operate in different heating modes. In this setup, air velocity and temperature were controlled by an air blower (HG 2510 ESD, Steinel) with a heating coil (Fig. 1 a). Data collection was based on a full factorial design and a center point with two factors: air temperature (40, 55, and 70°C) and velocity (0.2, 0.6, and 1 m/s) (Fig. 1 b). Three replicates were done at each condition. The rationale for selecting the processing conditions is as follows: (i) we note that the drying temperature should be well below the boiling point temperature of the pure solvent (for water, 100°C) and melting point of the drug (for GF, 220°C) and (ii) we considered the gentle drying conditions recommended in the literature for strip films ( ) that avoid or minimize bubble formation and other film defects besides performing some preliminary experiments. In view of these considerations and experiments, the range for the drying parameters was chosen in such a way to demonstrate the effects of temperature and air velocity on the drying kinetics. Fig. 1 a Schematic of the drying apparatus. b Full factorial design of experiment and the center point
Films were cast on a polyester substrate (9744 Release Liner, 3M Scotchpak) using a doctor blade with a 0.3- and 0.5-mm aperture thicknesses. The plastic substrate with the cast film (12 × 8 cm) was placed on a heated metal plate with a fixed temperature (the same temperature as the air flow). During the drying process, the isothermal plate would minimize the temperature variation across the film. The plate was positioned on a digital scale connected to a computer system and the weight of the film was recorded every 2 s. The temperature in the chamber was recorded using two mounted thermocouples before and after the film via a thermocouple recorder (Easy View 15 Thermometer Datalogger, Extech Instruments) to ensure steady state operation. The air velocity was measured above the film in the middle of the chamber using a hot wire thermo-anemometer (407,123, Extech Instruments). The room temperature (20–30°C) and relative humidity (30–40%) were controlled to ensure dew point temperature of 11 ± 1°C.
Film Characterization
A digital micrometer with an accuracy of 1 μm was used to measure the thickness of the dried film. Digital microscope with polarization mode is used (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, LLC, Germany) to gain information on particle distribution along the dried films. Images were taken at ×10 magnification. Content uniformity (CU) test was performed on films with 0.3-mm and 0.5-mm (initial) wet film thickness dried at two extreme drying conditions in DoE, i.e. , 40°C–0.2 m/s or 70°C–1 m/s. Five punched samples (~0.72 cm 2 in area) were taken from each film (8 cm × 12 cm) randomly and dissolved in 20 mL 7.2 g/L SDS solution. After stirring for 3 h, absorbance of each solution was measured at 290 nm using UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific Evolution 300). The drug loading in each sample was calculated; mean and relative standard deviation (RSD) were reported ( n = 5).
KINETIC MODEL: FITTING AND PREDICTION
In this work, integral method of analysis was selected to model drying kinetics at conditions defined by the DoE. In this method, a semi-empirical kinetic model was used based on a certain mechanism that describes different transport regimes during the drying process. A drying mechanism with two primary regimes was assumed ( ). In the first regime, moisture is available at the external surface of the viscous film and the drying process is controlled by the mass transfer resistance in the gas phase. This regime is called constant-rate period. In the second regime, the drying process is controlled by the intra-film diffusion of water to the external surface and is called the falling-rate period. Based on the chosen mechanism, a kinetic model with three unknown parameters ( R c , X c , α ) was formulated as follows: $$ \frac{-{m}_s}{A}\frac{dX}{dt}=R(X)=\Big\{{\displaystyle \begin{array}{l}{R}_c\kern4em X\ge {X}_c\\ {}{R}_c{\left(\frac{X}{X_c}\right)}^{\alpha}\kern1em X<{X}_c\end{array}} $$ (1) where m s is the dry mass, A is the surface area, R (g/cm 2 s) is the drying-rate flux, R c is the drying-rate flux for the constant-rate period, and X c (g/g dry mass) is the critical moisture content, which is the transition point from constant-rate to falling-rate period. A power law model was assumed for the falling-rate period for the moisture content below the critical value. In this model, as X approaches X c , the drying-rate flux ( R ) approaches R c .
The model was first fitted to the experimental data for each set of processing conditions in order to estimate the parameters (model calibration). Due to disturbances in the drying setup, kinetic data is usually noisy, and filtering is required to reduce the noise. Savitzky-Golay filtering (first order) in MATLAB was used for noise reduction before data fitting. Unlike the differential method of analysis, which entails numerical differentiation of the experimental data, the integral method of analysis entails solving the ODE (the proposed rate model in Eq. 1 ) directly. In parameter estimation, we used an in-house MATLAB code that couples a built-in optimizer (fmincon) with a built-in ODE solver (ode23s) and thereby minimized the following objective function: $$ {\chi}_r^2=\frac{\sum \limits_{i=1}^n{\left({X}_{i,\exp }-{X}_{i,\mathrm{model}}\right)}^2}{\sigma^2\kern0.1em \left(n-p\right)} $$ (2) where \( {\chi}_r^2 \) is the reduced chi-squared showing the error sum of squares divided by the degree of freedom ( n is the number of experimental data points and p is the number of model parameters) and σ is the measurement error obtained from replicates. At each iteration of the optimizer (fmincon), the optimizer calls for ode23s to solve the first-order ODE in Eq. ( 1 ), and the moisture content was numerically calculated at each and every data point (every 2 s). So, the entire profile of moisture variation from simulation was compared with the experimental data in each iteration of the optimizer. The estimates for the three parameters ( R c , X c , α ) were obtained when the optimizer iterations satisfied a termination tolerance of 10 −10 for parameters and the objective function. The MATLAB optimization sub-routine lsqnonlin was also used and no significant change in the results was observed.
The predictive capability of the model was established by using the estimated parameters for 0.3-mm-thick wet films and predicting the time-wise change of moisture for 0.5-mm-thick wet films under the same air velocity–temperature. Note that the model parameters were calibrated separately for both the 0.3-mm and 0.5-mm-thick films using the above-mentioned calibration procedure. However, we only used the fitted parameters for 0.3-mm-thick films in the moisture prediction for 0.5-mm-thick films.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Film Properties
In the drying experiments, almost constant moisture content was achieved and drying was considered complete within 20 and 30 min of the process for films with wet film thicknesses of 300 and 500 μm. The average dry film thickness was in the range 30–35 μm and 50–55 μm, respectively. Uniform drying without any visible phase separation or bubble formation was observed for all the dried films. As shown in Fig. 2 a–c, the drug is also distributed uniformly without agglomeration at two drying conditions. CU was performed on the films dried at two extreme conditions in the DoE (Table II ). RSD results suggest that regardless of the drying conditions, i.e. , 40–70°C for the drying air temperature and 0.2–1 m/s for drying air velocity, films with acceptable content uniformity (RSD% < 6) were prepared.

Drying of Wet Films: Experimental and Modeling Results
Experimentally determined temporal variation of moisture content X during convective batch drying for various air temperature–velocity is shown in Fig. 3 a, b for the initial wet film thicknesses of 0.5 mm and 0.3 mm, respectively. In general, X decreased monotonically until an equilibrium value was attained, which occurred earlier when the drying was faster. Figure 3 also presents the predicted X profiles, represented by solid lines, generated via the kinetic model with the optimized parameters. The simple three-parameter kinetic model was capable of fitting the experimental data very well. Tables III and IV present the fitted model parameters for the respective wet film thicknesses and clearly demonstrate the goodness of fit with high coefficient of determination. The kinetic parameters were affected by air velocity and temperature. All estimated parameters at drying different conditions are statistically significant.

The rate of moisture reduction, \( \frac{- dX}{dt}=\frac{R\kern0.1em A}{m_s} \) , and the drying-rate flux R as defined by Eq. ( 1 ), i.e. , \( R=\frac{-{m}_s}{A}\frac{dX}{dt} \) , were calculated using the fitted model parameters and are presented as function of X for both wet film thicknesses in Fig. 4 . The kinetic model simulations show a constant rate period followed by a falling rate period, and the transition was demarcated by the critical moisture content X c , which depends on the process parameters (refer to Tables III and IV ). For a given initial wet film thickness, the profiles in Fig. 3 and the estimated drying rate flux R c values in Tables III and IV show that an increase in either the air velocity or the air temperature led to higher drying-rate flux and faster drying. This could be deducted by qualitatively considering the equation for the drying-rate flux at constant-rate period ( R c ) ( ): $$ {R}_c=\frac{h\left({T}_g-{T}_w\right)}{\varDelta {H}_w} $$ (3) where h is the heat transfer coefficient, T g and T w are the gas (air) temperature and wet-bulb temperature, and Δ H w is the enthalpy of water evaporation. An increase in air velocity increases the heat transfer coefficient, while an increase in air temperature increases the driving force for evaporation; both of which increases the drying-rate flux as per Eq. ( 3 ). Fig. 4 (a-e) Comparison of the moisture reduction rate (left axis) and drying-rate flux (right axis) vs. moisture content for the two wet film thicknesses (0.3 and 0.5 mm) at different drying temperature and air velocity based on the DoE. The knee points in the plots show the critical moisture content ( X c )
The onset of the falling-rate period depends on the drying conditions and the inter-play between moisture mass transfer resistance in the gas phase and in the film. At 40°C–0.2 m/s, the drying rate-flux ( R c ) is the lowest, as explained by Eq. ( 3 ), while X c is the highest compared to other conditions. At this condition, because of the low temperature, water molecules cannot diffuse to the surface fast enough and the intra-film diffusion starts limiting the drying process. The intra-film diffusion limitation along with a low external mass transfer coefficient leads to a high X c . At 70°C–1 m/s, because of high temperature and air velocity, the drying-rate flux is the highest, while X c is the lowest; most of the water evaporates during the constant-rate period.
Effect of Initial Wet Film Thickness and Predictive Capability of the Model
There are potential situations when the initial wet film thickness may need to be altered during manufacturing process and for which the drying needs to be controlled. This may be needed, for example, when the drug loading is to be modulated in strip film by changing the initial wet film thickness during the wet-film casting without changing the drug loading in the precursor film suspension. Therefore, drying kinetics for films with different wet film thicknesses was examined to help future process development and identification of proper control strategies for films with different drug doses. The effect of (initial) wet film thickness on the drying kinetics is also shown in Fig. 4 . The drying-rate flux R (right y axis) is more or less similar for both thicknesses at most of the conditions. The difference between the moisture reduction rates ( \( \frac{- dX}{dt}=\frac{R\kern0.1em A}{m_s} \) ) for the two film thicknesses is also shown in Fig. 4 (left y axis). Given similar drying-rate flux ( R ) at most of the conditions, the higher moisture reduction rate for the thinner film is due to the lower film mass ( m s ). However, at 70°C–1 m/s and 55°C–0.6 m/s, some differences can be observed in the X c and the drying rate in the falling-rate period, which could also be deducted by comparing the parameters in Tables III and IV .
Figure 5 a shows the excellent fitting capability of the semi-empirical model for films with 0.5-mm initial wet thickness; the moisture profiles were obtained by simulations with the optimal parameter estimates (refer to Table III ). In order to demonstrate the predictive capability of the model for different initial wet film thicknesses, parameter estimates obtained for the 0.3-mm-thick wet films (Table IV ) were used to predict the moisture profiles for the 0.5-mm-thick wet films (Fig. 5 b). The predicted moisture profiles in Fig. 5 b agree well with the experimental data. Only the moisture prediction curve in the falling-rate period for 70°C–1 m/s and 55°C–0.6 m/s deviates slightly from the experimental data (Fig. 5 b). It should be noted here that data collection particularly at 70°C–1 m/s was difficult for the thinner film as presented by the error bars in Fig. 3 b. Overall, the results show that for a fixed air temperature–velocity, one set of kinetic parameter estimates can reasonably predict the drying behavior for different film thicknesses because water transport process does not appear to drastically change with thickness.

Limitations of the Semi-Empirical Model and Potential Improvements
In this study, the simple three-parameter kinetic model has been shown to have excellent fitting capability for drying data collected over a wide range of air velocity–temperature. Moreover, unlike the models in refs. ( , ), this model is capable of predicting the moisture profiles for different initial wet film thicknesses. Note that the model could also be used to predict moisture profiles in wet films with different initial moisture content corresponding to various drug loadings; however, this capability was not tested here. As shown in Tables III and IV , the fitted model parameters are only applicable to a specific set of air velocity–temperature, and they do not present all aspects of transport processes at different conditions nor predict the film shrinkage and the dry film thickness. Hence, in general, detailed mechanistic models are required to investigate the transport phenomena occurring in the drying process specifically the diffusion of water through the polymeric film and the film shrinkage, which will be addressed in a forthcoming paper.
One way to improve the predictive capability of the semi-empirical model is to establish a global process model in which the three parameters of the model are mathematically expressed as functions of air temperature–velocity. Such functions may be based on fundamental equations, e.g. , Eq. ( 3 ) for the constant-rate period, or can be merely empirical polynomial functions with several fitting parameters, especially in the absence of predictive closed-form solutions of any model for the falling rate. While feasible, such an approach demands a denser data set than those used with the simple DoE in this study because the accuracy–statistical significance of the newly introduced parameters would warrant it. Once such a global process model is calibrated and validated, it could be used predictively for any given process condition.
In the absence of a dense data set for a global process model, we would only attempt to use a simple transport model (refer to Eq. ( 3 )) for predicting the drying-rate flux during the constant rate period, which explicitly relates R c to air velocity–temperature. Equation ( 3 ) assumes that the heat supplied by the drying gas is equal to the heat of evaporation, which is associated with the external mass transfer rate of moisture from the film surface to the gas phase ( ). Some empirical correlations are available in the literature for the calculation of h as a function of air flow rate or velocity in laminar and turbulent regimes ( , , , ). However, they have not been derived or experimentally measured in a setup that has the same geometry and flow profiles as in our polymer film drying setup, and they do not consider the effect of water evaporation along a polymer film on the heat transfer coefficient. For example, Schmidt-Hansberg et al . ( ) studied drying kinetics of solution cast film for organic photovoltaic applications. In their work, convective drying of a thin polymer film cast on a substrate in a rectangular channel was presented. They adjusted the parameters for Sherwood number ( Sh ) correlation using drying kinetics measurements for a polymer film with thickness of 10 μm. The effect of intra-film solvent diffusion is minimized by using such a thin film. The correlation was validated for Reynolds number ( Re = ρVD h / μ ) up to 2500, where ρ is the humid air density, V is the velocity, D h is the hydraulic diameter of the channel, and μ is the viscosity .
Based on their fitted correlation, the average mass transfer coefficient ( k m ) over the film can be calculated as $$ Sh=0.109\kern0.1em {\operatorname{Re}}_L^{0.7234}\kern0.1em S{c}^{1/3} $$ (4) $$ Sh=\frac{k_m\kern0.1em L}{D_w} $$ (5) where Sc is the Schmidt number ( Sc = μ/ρD w ), ρ is the humid air density, μ is the viscosity, D w is the diffusion of water vapor in the air, and L is the film substrate length. Considering the analogy between heat and mass transfer ( ), the heat transfer coefficient ( h ) can be written as $$ h={k}_m\kern0.1em \rho \kern0.1em {C}_p\kern0.1em {\left(\frac{Sc}{\Pr}\right)}^{2/3} $$ (6) where Pr is the Prandtl number (Pr = Cp μ / k ), ρ is the air density, C p is the heat capacity, and k is the thermal conductivity. Since the process and the geometry of their setup is somewhat similar to the setup in our work, their fitted correlation was used to calculate R c and compare with our experimental results in the laminar regime.
Following correlation is recommended for drying gas in turbulent flow parallel to the channel surface ( , ): $$ Nu=0.037\;{\operatorname{Re}}^{0.8}\;{\Pr}^{0.33} $$ (7) $$ Nu=\frac{h\kern0.1em {D}_h}{k} $$ (8) where Nu is the Nusselt number, h is the heat transfer coefficient, D h is the hydraulic diameter of the channel, and k is the thermal conductivity. Here, this correlation was used for drying conditions with air velocities 0.6 and 1 m/s.
Table V presents the R c values obtained from fitting of the semi-empirical model, Eq. ( 1 ), to the experimental data (experimental) as well as those calculated by Eq. ( 3 ) with the correlations in Eqs. ( )–( ) (predicted). Since the R c values obtained by our model calibration allowed for excellent fitting of the experimental data during the constant-rate period, they were considered as the correct values. First, note that the predictions with the correlations underestimated the R c values. Although the differences between the predicted and experimental values are significant, both predicted and experimental values reflect the impact of air velocity and temperature with a similar trend. Other correlations would also result in significant difference between predicted and experimental values for R c (not shown for brevity). The deviations in R c values could have originated from several factors such as differences in the setup geometry and flow profile over the polymer film, where evaporation occurs, imprecise measurement–calculation of average velocity and the assumption that surface temperature in the film equals wet-bulb temperature (see Eq. ( 3 )). These findings signify the need for further experimentation in the future to adjust the parameters for Nusselt or Sherwood numbers to obtain more accurate heat or mass transfer coefficients for polymer film drying in our setup. Noting the inability of the existing correlations for predicting R even during the constant rate period for our experimental setup/data and overly simplified nature of simple transport models for mass diffusion through the films that simulate the falling-rate period ( ), the use of detailed, mechanistic, transport-based models is required, which will be considered in a forthcoming paper.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE OUTLOOK
We have studied the drying kinetics during convective drying of wet films loaded with a silica-coated poorly water-soluble drug (MC-GF) under various drying conditions. Uniform drying of the films with acceptable content uniformity was achieved within a reasonable time in the selected range for the process conditions. Based on a two-step drying mechanism, a simple rate-based model was formulated, whose parameters were estimated by integral method of analysis using a coupled optimizer–ODE solver. The model delineated two drying periods and the transition between them explicitly and quantitatively. The models also demonstrated the capability to quantify the impact of critical process parameters (CPPs) such as air velocity, temperature, and initial wet film thickness on the drying kinetics and described the time-wise change of moisture. The results show that more water evaporates during constant-rate period as the temperature or air velocity increases. Predictive capability of the model was established by showing that one set of kinetic parameters can be used for films with different initial wet thicknesses. Although the model is expected to be capable of predicting the moisture variation for films prepared with different initial solids (drug) loading in the precursor suspension, this capability was not validated with experimental data in this study, and will be considered in a future study. Having such predictive capability will allow pharmaceutical scientists/engineers to significantly reduce process development time for films with different drug loading because the model calibrated with a single set of wet film thickness–drug loading in the precursor could allow for prediction for other thickness–drug loadings.
While having excellent fitting capability and good predictive capability for moisture variation in films with various initial wet thickness, the predictive capability of the model is still limited to the specific air temperature–velocity used in the experiments. We have indicated potential improvements through (i) new correlations for heat transfer coefficient in our custom-made drying setup and (ii) a global process model that relates the model parameters to the air temperature–velocity explicitly. Upon such improvements, the semi-empirical model could be used for streamlined process development and process control purposes. Moreover, this study suggests the need for transport-based models for better mechanistic understanding and predictive capability. In the future, moisture content, dissolution performance, and mechanical properties of the films will be considered along with process control objectives such as energy minimization, which will help one to identify the design space and the optimal operating region for the drying process in cost-effective, continuous manufacturing of polymer strip films.
