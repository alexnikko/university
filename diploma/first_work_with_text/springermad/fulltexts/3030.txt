Introduction
Oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the sixth most frequently diagnosed malignancy worldwide [ ] and one of the most prevalent cancers in some Asian countries [ ]. However, despite recent therapeutic advances, the overall prognosis has not substantially improved [ , ]. In the initiation and progression of cancer, one of the most important processes is evasion of host immune surveillance. Although the concept of immunotherapy was first described more than 50 years ago, it has yet not made a sizeable contribution to cancer treatment. However, the recent development of monoclonal antibodies against epidermal growth factor receptor or against cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) has rekindled the promise of cancer immunotherapy [ ].
To date, most studies of tumor progression have focused on the aggressiveness of the primary tumor, and not the host immune response. However, in several studies, T cell alterations in head and neck cancer researched by tumor infiltrating lymphocyte or serum antibodies have been reported as a possible interaction between tumor and host immunity [ , , , ]. In studies of systemic immunity, low numbers of lymphocytes and IL-10 levels in peripheral blood were reported to be associated with poor prognosis [ , ]. However, the changes in draining lymph node have not been evaluated and there are no data about correlation between the status of the generalized antitumor immunity and prognosis.
In this study, we compared the differential gene expression patterns in tumor-free regional lymph node which was included in neck dissection specimen from patients with stage IV oral squamous cell carcinoma who either died of fulminant recurrence shortly after termination of initial treatment or were treated successfully. Based on these results, we attempted to identify independent prognostic markers that could complement the traditional markers for OSCC.
Materials and methods
Selection of tumor-free lymph node
We tried to select the locoregional lymph node which is minimally affected by immune reaction caused by primary tumor in terms of morphological and anatomical standpoint. Therefore, we tried to avoid the level I (echelon) lymph nodes and in cases of node positive cases, the lymph node harvested from levels other than the level of metastatic lymph node was reviewed. Retrospective review of pathology slides was performed and the lymph node of which the normal architecture is well preserved without sinus histiocytosis which is one of the most common secondary change induced by tumor involvement was selected. After selecting lymph node, the corresponding paraffin block was used for further studies.
cDNA microarray analysis
We selected four patients with OSCC who died of fulminant recurrence within a few months following initial treatment and another four patients with the same stage who were considered cured after treatment. Institutional review board approval was obtained at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital (No. B-1205/153–304). The committee waived the need for written informed consent because only pathologic samples were used.
All patients were diagnosed with OSCC between 2003 and 2011. Initial surgical resection was successful in all patients and all tumor margins were carefully reviewed and confirmed to be free of tumor cells. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues were obtained from regional tumor-free lymph nodes. cDNA microarray analysis was carried out to identify genes that were differentially expressed between the recurrent and non-recurrent groups in regional tumor-free lymph node samples and to determine their utility as biomarkers for survival. Total RNA was extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples using an RNeasy Mini Kit with DNase treatment (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.RNA integrity and purity were checked by agarose gel electrophoresis and analyzed on an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100™. Purified mRNA was reverse transcribed to produce cDNA. After amplification and labeling, the Cy3-labeled cDNA was hybridised to a Agilent SurePrint G3 Human GE 8 × 60K array TM (Agilent technologies, CA, USA) and scanned using an Agilent 2505C scanner TM (Agilent technologies, CA, USA).
Gene expression levels were calculated with Feature Extraction v.10.7.3.1™ (Agilent technologies, CA, USA). The normalized and log-transformed intensity values were then analyzed using GeneSpring GX 12.1 TM software (Agilent technologies, CA, USA).To explore differences in gene expression, we conducted a comparative analysis with the unpaired unequal variance t-test (Welch’s t test) method using GeneSpring GX 12.1 TM software (Agilent technologies, CA, USA). To correct for multi-testing errors, the false discovery rate was employed following a permutation-based bootstrap step-down procedure using GeneSpring GX 12.1 TM software (Agilent technologies, CA, USA). Genes that were significantly up- or down-regulated (fold change > 2 or < 0.5, p < 0.05) were selected for hierarchical clustering. The hierarchical clustering tree was created based on Euclidean distances under each experimental condition.
DAVID Bioinformatics Resources ( http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov ) and GeneSpring GX 12.1 TM software (Agilent technologies, CA, USA) were both used for further functional analysis. The Gene Ontology database (URL: http://www.geneontology.org ) was used to assign biological relevance to the data and to identify genes by ordering them in relevant biochemical pathways.
Construction of tissue microarrays and immunochemistry
To confirm the correlations between tissue expression and survival for selected genes, tissue samples from 60 patients in whom paraffin block of tumor-free lymph node from neck dissection specimen is available are included for immunohistochemistry. Surgical resection specimen obtained between 2003 and 2011 were used. Representative core tissue sections (2 mm diameter) of the 60 regional tumor-free lymph nodes were taken from paraffin blocks and arranged in new tissue microarray blocks.
Selected markers from cDNA microarray analysis were tried for further evaluation by immunohistochemistry to assess potential correlations with prognosis. The immunochemical stained slides were evaluated considering the extent and intensity of staining using the semi-quantitative histologic scoring system (H-scores) suggested by Allred et al. [ ]. Detailed methods of immunohistochemistry and histologic scoring (H-score) are described in supplementary material.
Statistical analysis
Correlations between clinical findings and the immunohistochemistry results were analyzed using an one-way ANOVA or independent sample t-test of H-scores.
Relapse-free and disease-free survival was assessed by Kaplan–Meier analysis with the log-rank test to determine statistical significance. H scores were converted to dichotomous variables of high vs. low immune activity. Cut-off values were determined based on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. When the ROC curve did not yield a significant value, the median H score was used as a cut-off value.
Multivariate Cox regression analysis with the forward conditional method was used to determine the independent prognostic value. Variables with p < 0.05 in the univariate log-rank test were included in the multivariate Cox regression analysis. All statistical analyses were carried out as two-tailed tests and p values less than 0.05 were considered significant. SPSS (Version 18.0; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for all statistical analyses.

Widespread down-regulation of genes related to the host immune response was observed in lymph node samples from the recurrent group compared to the expression in samples from the non-recurrent group. These genes were mainly related to antigen presentation or T cell receptor (TCR) function. The most obvious examples were HLA-DPA1 and CD1E , which are related to antigen presentation; CD3D, CD2 , and CD5 , which are associated with the TCR complex; CD28 and CD80 ( B7.1 ), which are associated with co-stimulators; and CD40L , which is involved in immune regulation. Genes whose inactivation is correlated with the development of various malignant tumors were also identified, and STAG2 and PTPRO were the most obvious examples (Table 2 , more information on Supplementary Table 2A, 2B, 2C).All gene expression files are available from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database of National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (accession number: GSE87593).

Cluster analyses were carried out for regional lymph node samples separately. The analyses showed clearly distinguishable expression patterns. Most genes related to immune reaction showed an opposite clustering pattern. Complete cluster diagrams are provided in Fig. 1 . We tried to select representative markers in each biological process from significantly down-regulated genes ( p < 0.01), and CD80, CD40L, PTPRO, and STAG2 were selected for further evaluation at the protein level (Table 2 ). An immunohistochemical analysis was performed using remaining samples of 8 patients. The results were quantified using the H score. We confirmed significantly higher expression of CD40L in the non-recurrent group ( p = 0.01, Fig. 2 ); however, others failed to show significant difference.

Immunohistochemistry using tissue array from 60 tumor-free lymph nodes
The cohort for immunohistochemistry and survival analysis consisted of 39 (65.0%) males and 21 (35.0%) females, with a mean age of 57.0 years (range 23 − 84). Mean duration of follow-up was 40.9 months. The difference in H scores was evaluated according to gender, age, TNM stage, and recurrence. CD40L and CD80 showed significantly increased expression in older age group. In contrast, the CD40L and CD80 expression was significantly lower in recurrent groups (Table 3 ).

Survival analysis
Univariate analysis
The H scores for each gene were examined for their potential associations with relapse-free and disease-free survival. For the univariate log rank test of the Kaplan–Meier model, H scores were split into two groups using the cut-off value determined by ROC curve analysis. The analysis showed that TNM stage IV, T stage 3–4, N stage 2, angiolymphatic invasion and lower expression of CD40L (H-score ≤ 65) showed significantly poorer relapse-free and disease-free survival. Lower expression CD80 (H-score ≤ 65) also showed significant difference in relapse-free survival, but not in disease-free survival. (Table 4 ).

Multivariate analysis
Using the Cox proportional hazards model, multivariate survival analyses were performed to assess the independent predictive value for relapse-free and disease-free survival. In relapse free survival, TNM stage IV ( p = 0.004 ) were verified to be independent poor prognostic factors. The lower expression of CD40L is also in the equation; however the p value was 0.054 and showed borderline significance. For the disease-free survival, TNM stage IV, angiolymphatic invasion and H score lesser than 65 for CD40L were significant independent factors for poorer prognosis in disease-specific survival. ( p = 0.017, 0.036, and 0.031 respectively) (Table 5 ).

Discussion
The present study analyzed the expression profiles in the lymph nodes from pathologically confirmed OSCC according to recurrence. Our study differs from previous ones in two major aspects. First, we compared the gene expression profiles in patients with stage IV OSCC divided by the presence of postoperative fulminant recurrence, instead of commonly compared pairs of tumor and adjacent normal tissues, for a more direct investigation of the factors related to tumor progression and recurrence. Second, the gene expression profiles in tumor-free lymph nodes obtained during neck dissection were analyzed to evaluate the role of host immunity in recurrence and progression. Using these results, we expect to obtain a broader picture of causative changes in host immunity related to tumor progression.
In the cDNA microarray analysis, the widespread down-regulation of genes involved in immune defense in the recurrent group was observed and it suggests that defective immunity in the host may be a predisposing factor for tumor recurrence and progression. Many of the down-regulated genes were involved in antigen presentation and recognition, including subsequent processes that activate immune responses. Regarding the selected genes for further evaluation by immunohistochemistry to assess potential correlations with prognosis, we tried to select representative molecules from each functional group among the genes which showed p value less than 0.01. With this consideration, CD80, CD40L, PTPRO, and STAG2 were selected. Most tumor cells are not derived from professional antigen-presenting cells; therefore, tumor cells typically do not express co-stimulators such as CD80 (B7-1) or B7-2. Thus, the neoplastic cell itself usually cannot stimulate T cell responses. Indeed, the process is mainly mediated by professional antigen presenting cells [ ], and recognition through MHC-TCR interaction is almost the only way for the host immune system to recognize tumor antigens. As a result, dysfunction of the co-stimulators involved in MHC–TCR interaction could lead to significant immune suppression because T cells become anergic without proper co-stimulation [ , ]. CD40L has a role in host defense against neoplastic cells [ ]. CD40L is a type I transmembrane protein that belongs to the tumor necrosis factor superfamily, presenting on CD4 + T cells, B cells, monocytes, and natural killer cells, as well as cancer cells [ ]. Its anti-tumor activity includes potentiating apoptosis of tumor cells [ , ], enhancing the function of antigen-presenting cells [ ], stimulating the production of interferon γ [ ], and enhancing the antitumor effects mediated by natural killer cells [ ]. Somatic aberrations and loss of STAG2 expression can lead to chromosome missegregation and aneuploidy finally causing mutations [ ]. The clinical associations of these genes with various cancers, including bladder cancer, melanoma, sarcoma, glioblastoma, and pancreatic ductal cancer, have been previously reported [ , , ]. PTPRO was reported to be frequently suppressed by methylation in several cancers, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia and cancers of the lung, breast, and esophagus [ ]. Although PTPROt is reported to have a role in maintaining T cell immunity in microenvironment of hepatocellular carcinoma in one paper [ ], the roles of these proteins in regional lymph node are rarely reported.
To confirm the prognostic value of these selected markers from microarray, immunohistochemical analysis using all available tumor-free lymph nodes was performed. Microarray was performed between 4 patients with fulminant recurrence and corresponding 4 patients with same stage to select the markers which predict recurrence and tissue array includes all patients who received surgery for oral cavity cancer with neck dissection to evaluate the independent statistical significance of these markers.
The univariate log rank test of the Kaplan–Meier model identified candidate genes correlated with survival. Decreased expression of CD40L was related to poorer relapse-free and disease-free survival. In the multivariate Cox regression, decreased expression of CD40L in regional tumor-free lymph nodes formed a significant independent predictive factor of disease-free survival along with stage IV and angiolymphatic invasion. With this result, we could conclude that changes in tumor-free lymph node affect the prognosis of cancer patients after treatment.
Some therapeutic approaches have been proposed for targeted delivery of CD40L to cancer cells or dendritic cells in various cancers, including head and neck carcinoma [ , , ]. Until now, these trials failed to show significant results. However, targeting CD40L can be useful in selected cases with decreased CD40L expression in lymph nodes as our series. Recently, the new technique like next generation sequencing is applied to the tumor specimen for the recent trends toward precision medicine or individualized treatment. Our results suggest that the tumor-free lymph node in the surgical specimen can be another source for deciding the individualized treatment.
The small number of cases in the microarray analysis and tissue array could be a limitation. In addition, usage of FFPE tissue samples may be a limitation, when compared to fresh frozen samples. However, more than 80% concordance was reported [ , , ], and RNA integrity was also checked prior to the microarray analysis. The use of cDNA microarray with FFPE samples could expand research by overcoming the short-term storage limitation of fresh samples.
In conclusion, the decreased expression of CD40L in lymph nodes may be an important factor in tumor recurrence and progression along with the TNM staging. These results suggest that the host immune status need to be considered during the initial assessment for more effective cancer treatment.
