INTRODUCTION
Schizophrenia is an uncommon disorder related to the central nervous system (CNS), mainly affecting the person’s lifestyle and carrying suicidal tendency, which causes the change in patient’s behaviors and tendency to think ( ). The use of long-term atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of elderly patients with schizophrenia is increasing over the past decade ( ). Among these, olanzapine (OLZ), a derivative of benzodiazepine compounds, is considered to be an important second-generation atypical antipsychotic agent used in the management of CNS disorders ( , ). Other first-generation antipsychotics are only active against positive symptoms of schizophrenia, whereas the effectiveness of OLZ is broad and found to be active against negative and positive symptoms of psychosis, due to a combined antagonism of dopamine (D 2 ) and serotonin (5-HT 2A ) receptors ( ). However, this atypical agent is associated with notable side effects including agranulocytosis, which plays a destructive role in hemolysis ( ). Recent case reports indicated that the olanzapine is also associated with other hematological problems, such as leukopenia or neutropenia ( , ). The mechanism of OLZ-induced agranulocytosis is not clear, but the previous reports suggest that this drug affects the level of granulocyte-colony–stimulating factor (G-CSF), which causes granulocytopenia, whereas OLZ-induced neutropenia occurs due to the formation of nitrenium cations, which is catalyzed by a flavin-containing monoxenage-3 system of leukocytes. Thus, leukopenia and neutropenia are serious and potentially life-threatening hematological side effects of conventional OLZ delivery ( , ).
Thus, delivery of this agent to the site of action, i.e. , within the CNS, without peripheral exposure could help in avoiding the associated side effects. However, the rigid blood–brain barrier (BBB) is the main challenge in the brain delivery of therapeutics ( ). Therefore, conventional drug therapies, delivered for CNS disorder, lead to higher exposure of the drug within the peripheral circulation, resulting in hematological toxicities ( ). Available oral and intravenous (i.v.) therapies of OLZ thus produce adverse effects on white blood cells ( ). Hence, the effective treatment of schizophrenia with this OLZ is limited, which even raises the risk of toxicity via the i.v. route. Therefore, the alternative safe and effective therapy for OLZ delivery to the brain is in high demand.
Nose-to-brain pathway has been proven as a safe and effective delivery for therapeutic agents towards the CNS because high vascularity, relatively high blood flow, and large surface area make this nasal route as a potential alternate for the delivery of therapeutics particularly to the CNS via the olfactory region ( , ). The intranasal (i.n.) delivery is a known approach for rapid permeation of drugs to the site of action in the CNS and avoids hepatic first-pass metabolism, and these are considerably favorable features towards effective CNS delivery of drugs ( , ). This is a non-invasive route, requiring less dose and dosing frequency, which enhances patient compliance and also reduces unnecessary systemic exposure, thereby reducing adverse effects ( , ). Nose-to-brain delivery is the unique solution to enhance drug concentration at the site of action. However, the major barrier is the ciliary clearance for the delivery of drugs via the i.n. route ( ). Modification with a mucoadhesive nasal delivery is a possible solution for mucociliary clearance. The gelling agents showed different in situ gel-forming mechanisms, but the temperature-sensitive gelling agents were properly suited with the nasal delivery. The capacity of a mucoadhesive agent is to enhance the residence time of formulation in the nasal cavity; hence, the drug penetrates for a longer period into the CNS from the site of application ( , ). Thereby, a lesser quantity of the therapeutic will pass in systemic circulation to limit associated adverse effects.
Among the available nanocarriers, a new generation of lipid nanocarrier including nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) is a promising lipid-based nanoformulation that provides a rapid brain delivery through the i.n. route ( , ). NLC includes a small droplet size of the formulation with excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability, and safe carriers, which help in enhancing the therapeutic concentration of a drug into the brain ( , ). NLC is an ideal nanocarrier for brain delivery because of its high stability, maximum entrapment efficiency, and drug loading potential than the solid lipid nanocarriers (SLNs) ( , ). Additionally, NLC strategy includes incorporation of liquid lipid into the matrix of solid lipid, which provides higher entrapment, stability, and drug loading capacity ( ). The NLC formulation provides rapid and sustained release of entrapped drug towards the site of action.
To avoid the limitations of available OLZ therapy, we have formulated and optimized OLZ-loaded nanostructured lipid carriers and evaluated for pharmacological and hematological toxicity studies towards the effective and safe delivery of drug to the brain.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
Olanzapine was received as a gift sample from Sun Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Mumbai, India). Peceol, Maisine 35-1, Labrafil M 1944 CS, Gelucire 44/14, Cremophor RH-40, and Compritol 888 ATO were received as the gift samples from Gattefosse (Mumbai, India). Poloxamer 407 was purchased from Yarrow Chem Products (Mumbai, India). Stearic acid, Tween 20, glyceryl monostearate, and Tween 80 were procured from S. D. Fine Chemicals (Pune, India). The HPMC K4M was received from Analab Fine Chemicals (Mumbai, India). A dialysis membrane was purchased from HiMedia Laboratories (Mumbai, India). All other chemicals were procured from Research-Lab Fine Chem Industries (Mumbai, India). Methanol and acetonitrile of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade were obtained from Merck (Mumbai, India).
High-Performance Liquid Chromatography
The HPLC method was developed for estimation of the total concentration of OLZ present in the NLC formulations. In this context, the HPLC consisted of Shimadzu Prominence (Kyoto, Japan), an LC-20AD HPLC pump, an SPD-M-20A variable wavelength photodiode array (PDA) detector, a Rheodyne injector, and LC solution software (version 1.25). Kromasil C18 (4.6 × 250 mm) column was used for analysis of OLZ with mobile phase prepared from ammonium acetate buffer (pH 3.4):acetonitrile (70:30). The flow rate and run time were found to be 1 mL/min and 10 min, respectively. The OLZ sample was analyzed at a predefined wavelength of 271 nm, and the calibration curve was found to be linear in the range of 2–10 μg/mL. The regression coefficient ( R 2 ) value was obtained within the limit (0.999), and the retention time of the developed method was found to be 3.00 min while the percent relative standard deviation (% RSD) for the developed method was obtained within the acceptable limit (< 2%). Hence, this method was reproducible for the determination of % entrapment efficiency (% EE), % drug loading, and in vitro and ex vivo drug permeation studies.
Screening of Components
The solubility of OLZ was performed in different solid lipids, liquid lipids, and surfactants, which were selected according to their applicability and compatibility in nasal formulations. The Hariol, Labrafil M 1944 CS, Maisine 35-1, and Peceol were screened as liquid lipids by using the saturation solubility method ( ). The Compritol 888 ATO and glyceryl monostearate were screened as solid lipids whereas the Gelucire 44/14 was examined for the stabilizer in NLC formulation. The surfactants screened for this study include Cremophor RH-40, Tween 20, and Tween 80. The solubility of OLZ in different lipids, surfactants, and stabilizers was examined by adding an excess quantity of OLZ to Eppendorf tubes containing 5 mL of each selected component. Eppendorf tubes were maintained at room temperature in the orbital shaker for 72 h to attain equilibrium ( ). The equilibrated mixtures were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 15 min through the refrigerated centrifuge (Remi Laboratory Instruments). The supernatant was filtered through the membrane filter (0.45 μ), and the OLZ was quantified by using the previously described HPLC method.
Preparation of OLZ-Loaded Nanostructured Lipid Carriers
OLZ-loaded nanostructured lipid carrier (OLZ-NLC) was prepared by using the progressive melt emulsification ultrasonication method ( ). This method consisted of the mixture of lipid and aqueous phases. The required lipid phases consisted of Compritol 888 ATO (solid lipid), Labrafil M 1944 CS (liquid lipid), Gelucire 44/14 (stabilizer), and OLZ, while the aqueous phase consisted of Tween 80 (surfactant) and water. The lipid phase was melted at a temperature of 10°C which was above the melting point of solid lipid and completely dissolved the drug to obtain a clear and homogeneous solution. Simultaneously, the aqueous phase was heated at 70°C separately in a water bath, and this water phase was slowly added in the melted lipid phase to form pre-emulsion. This pre-emulsion was stirred at 1000 rpm for 10 min, and the temperature was maintained at 70°C to obtain a homogeneous mixture. Further, this pre-emulsion was subjected to ultrasonication using a probe sonicator (Leela Sonic Industries) and cooled at room temperature to obtained clear OLZ-NLC dispersion. Two different mucoadhesive NLC formulations were prepared by using Carbopol 974P (0.4%) and a mixture of the mucoadhesive agents, including HPMC K4M (0.3%) with the in situ gelling agent poloxamer 407 (17%). The OLZ mucoadhesive NLC prepared by Carbopol 974P is defined as OLZ-MNLC (C), and similarly, the OLZ mucoadhesive NLC prepared by poloxamer 407 and HPMC K4M is defined as OLZ-MNLC (P+H). Finally, the mucoadhesive formulations were used for further characterization and animal studies ( ).
Experimental Design
Quality by design (QbD) provides development and optimization of formulation, which meets with its predetermined specifications and quality attributes ( , ). This approach determined how the factors and response variables affect the quality of formulation. An experimental Box–Behnken design (BBD) was used for the optimization of NLC formulations ( , , ). Statistical data characterized and determined an effect of formulation variables such as the drug ( A ), total lipid ( B ), and surfactant ( C ) on response variables. A statistical design mainly optimized the interaction effects as well as the model effects on responses such as globule size ( Y 1 ), polydispersity index (PDI) ( Y 2 ), and % EE ( Y 3 ). The experimental BBD suggested the significant model for the determination of polynomial equation and three-dimensional plots using Stat-Ease software. The Box–Behnken design is highly preferable because it provides a minimum of three factors with more than three responses compared to the central composite design (CCD) and other designs ( , ). The statistical design generated 17 experimental runs by using a quadratic model. The software-constructed equation of quadratic model is given in Eq. ( 1 ).
$$ Y={b}_0+{b}_1A+{b}_2B+{b}_3C+{b}_{12} AB+{b}_{13} AC+{b}_{23} BC+{b}_{11}{A}^2+{b}_{22}{B}^2+{b}_{33}{C}^2 $$ (1) where the responses were represented by Y , the intercept was represented by b 0 , the regression coefficients were represented by b 1 to b 33 , and the independent variables were represented by A , B , and C .
Physico-Chemical Characterization
Particle Size and Zeta Potential
The globule size and PDI were used to measure the size distribution and distribution index. Prior to analysis, OLZ-NLCs were ten times diluted with double-distilled water followed by determination of globule size and size distribution by using a Nanophox (Sympatec, Germany) size analyzer ( ).
The surface charge of nanoparticles is used to measure the electrostatic mobility as well as the stability between developed NLC formulations. The dipole moment and surface charge between nanoparticles were measured by using a zeta meter (Delsa Nano C, USA). The zeta potential measurement was performed using the electrolyte sample of highly pure water.
Encapsulation Efficiency and Drug Loading
The % EE of OLZ in the optimized NLC formulation was evaluated by adding 1 mL of NLC in 10 mL of methanol and then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 25 min. The supernatant was separated, and the dilutions were prepared by using mobile phase. The dilutions were sonicated and analyzed for % EE by using the validated RP-HPLC system ( ). The % EE and drug loading of OLZ in the NLC formulation were calculated using Eqs. ( 2 ) and ( 3 ), respectively.
$$ \%\mathrm{EE}=\frac{W_{\mathrm{e}}-{W}_{\mathrm{f}}}{W_{\mathrm{e}}}\times 100 $$ (2)
$$ \%\mathrm{DL}=\frac{W_{\mathrm{e}}-{W}_{\mathrm{f}}}{W_{\mathrm{l}}}\times 100 $$ (3) where W e is the weight of the entrapped drug, W f is the weight of the free drug, and W l is the weight of the total lipid.
Analysis of Particle Morphology by Scanning Electron Microscopy
The particle surface morphology of the optimized formulation was studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (JEOL JMS-7400, Japan). The sample site (silicon wafer chip) was cleaned before the application of the nanoparticles. The NLC formulation equivalent to 20 μL was applied on a silicon wafer chip, and then the sample was properly dried at 25°C for 10 min. The high-resolution microscopic images of nanoparticles were captured by using a computer system.
Ex Vivo Mucoadhesive Strength
The mucoadhesion capacity of an optimized NLC was evaluated by using Texture Pro CT V 1.8 Build 29 (Brookfield Engineering Laboratories). In due course of the experiment, the cylindrical probe was immersed for 10 s into the beaker containing mucoadhesive NLC formulation. Test speed was selected at 1 mm/s with a trigger force of 3 g. This system was attached with the computer programming to generate reports automatically after the analysis ( , ).
In Vitro Drug Release Study
The OLZ release study from optimized NLC formulation was performed through dialysis membrane (Mol. Wt. 12,000 Da) using vertical Franz diffusion cell at 34.5°C ± 0.5°C for 8 h. The membrane was stabilized in a simulated nasal electrolyte solution (SNES, pH 6.4) for 15 min. The nanoformulations (1 mL) were uniformly distributed in the donor chamber, and the SNES was continuously stirred by a magnetic stirrer. Aliquots (0.1 mL) were withdrawn from the receiver compartment at predefined time intervals, and the same amount of fresh SNES was used for refilling the volume of a cell. The validated HPLC method was used for determination of the percentage of drug release through the dialysis membrane ( ). Simultaneously, the formulation was checked for different release kinetic models such as zero-order, first-order, Higuchi, Hixon–Crowell cube root, and Korsmeyer–Peppas models, and a best-fitted model was selected.
Ex Vivo Drug Permeation Study
Ex vivo nasal permeation of OLZ-NLC, OLZ-MNLC (P+H), and OLZ-MNLC (C) was performed through the sheep nasal mucosa using the vertical Franz diffusion cell. Freshly isolated sheep nasal mucosa was obtained from the local slaughterhouse and immediately stored in the fresh SNES. The standard surface area of a diffusion cell was 3.14 cm 2 , and the thickness of the nasal membrane was 0.2 cm. The volume (15 mL) of a cell was filled by using the SNES, and it stabilized the mucosa (cutoff size, 3.14 cm 2 ) in the SNES for 15 min. The temperature of a receiver compartment was maintained at 34°C ± 1°C using continuous circulating water in a diffusion cell. The nanoformulations (1 mL) were uniformly distributed in the donor chamber, and the SNES was continuously stirred by a magnetic stirrer ( ). The permeation parameters of OLZ were studied using Eqs. ( 4 ) and ( 5 ). $$ P=\frac{\mathrm{slope}}{S}\times {V}_{\mathrm{D}} $$ (4) $$ {J}_{\mathrm{ss}}=P\times {C}_{\mathrm{D}} $$ (5) where P is the permeation coefficient, J ss is the flux, V D is the volume of the donor compartment (mg/mL), C D is the concentration of OLZ in the donor compartment, and S is the effective surface area of the nasal tissue (3.14 cm 2 ).
Aliquots (0.1 mL) were collected from the receiver compartment at the predefined time intervals. An equal quantity of fresh SNES was refilled at the same temperature in a receiver compartment to maintain the volume of a cell. The samples were diluted with methanol and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was separated, and the permeation (μg/cm 2 ) of OLZ within 8 h was determined by using a validated HPLC method.
Nasal Tissue Toxicity Study
The toxicity study was performed after 8 h of exposure of OLZ-NLC, OLZ-MNLC (P+H), and OLZ-MNLC (C) on the sheep nasal mucosa. The main purpose of this study was to determine the pathological changes which occurred in the nasal mucosa due to the 8-h exposure of i.n. formulations. This study was performed by the comparison of treated mucosa with untreated (control) mucosa. The untreated mucosa section was used as the negative control, whereas the treated mucosa sections were used as the positive control. All mucosa sections were treated with 10% formalin solution. Finally, these sections were fixed in paraffin and stained with staining agents containing hematoxylin and eosin. The stained sections were examined under a light microscope, and the structural changes in the treated mucosa section were determined ( ).
In Vivo Studies
Brain Distribution of OLZ-Loaded Nanoparticles
The olanzapine in the optimized OLZ-MNLC (P+H) and OLZ-NLC formulations was radiolabeled by using technetium-99m ( 99m Tc) radioisotope. The brain distribution study was performed using Swiss albino mice (average weight, 25 g) under the approval of an animal ethical committee, Bombay, ACTREC in Kharghar, Mumbai, India, regulated by the Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision of Experiments on Animals (CPCSEA) (Protocol No. ACTREC/IAEC/12/2015).
The experimental animals were kept under standard laboratory conditions, with 25°C ± 2°C temperature and 55% ± 5% relative humidity (RH). The animals were divided into two groups, and each group consisted of 12 animals. The experimental groups were anesthetized using anesthetic isoflurane gas. The radiolabeled 80 μCi/40 μL of 99m Tc-OLZ-MNLC (P+H) (OLZ equivalent to 0.008 mg/kg) formulation was administered in the group I animals (upright position angle of 90°) via the i.n. route (20 μL/nostril) with the help of a micropipette fixed with a low-density polyethylene (LDPE) catheter tube ( , ), whereas the radiolabeled 80 μCi/40 μL of 99m Tc-OLZ-NLC (OLZ equivalent to 0.008 mg/kg) formulation was injected in the group II animals via the tail vein (i.v. route). The different predetermined time points (30 min, 120 min, 240 min, and 360 min) were selected for the current study, and blood sampling was done through the retro-orbital plexus method. Finally, the animals were sacrificed and their organs such as the brain and nostril were immediately isolated. The drug concentration after i.n. and i.v. administrations was measured in the brain and blood using a Hidex gamma counter.
The pharmacokinetic parameter which consisted of brain distribution was calculated by using GraphPad Prism software (version 7.04).
Assessment of OLZ-Induced Hematocompatibility and Cytotoxic Effect on White Blood Cells
The hematological study was carried out under the approval of Institutional Animal Ethics Committee, regulated by CPCSEA (Protocol No. SIOP/IAEC/2017/02/13), and their guidelines were followed throughout the study. Healthy male Wistar rats weighing from 200 to 250 g were selected for the study. The experimental animals were initially acclimatized under standard laboratory conditions, with 25°C ± 2°C temperature and 55% ± 5% RH.
All animals were divided into four test groups for OLZ-loaded MNLC (P+H) nanoformulation, and each group consisted of six animals ( n = 24): the untreated animals (group I) and the animals treated with a low dose (1 mg/kg) (group II), a medium dose (2 mg/kg) (group III), and a high dose (4 mg/kg) (group IV) of OLZ-loaded MNLC (P+H) in situ gel via the i.n. route for 28 days. The in situ gel formulations are liquid at normal temperature, but they turn to gel under physiological temperature (34.5°C ± 0.5°C). Hence, it should ease for administration into the nasal cavity. The OLZ-MNLC (P+H) i.n. in situ gel of olanzapine (40 μL/nostril) was administered with the help of a micropipette, fixed with an LDPE catheter tube (0.1 mm internal diameter) through the i.n. route. Animals were kept in the upright position at an angle of 90°; therefore, the maximum amount of OLZ can reach into the brain ( , ).
After completion of the experimental period, the animals were anesthetized and the blood samples (0.5 mL) were collected via the retro-orbital plexus (ROP) method ( , ) in anticoagulant EDTA-coated tubes. The samples were examined for hematological parameters including white blood cells (WBCs), lymphocytes (LYMs), hemoglobin (Hb), and platelets (PLTs). The counts were performed by using an auto hematology analyzer (URIT-2900 Vet Plus, UK) ( ). Finally, the agranulocytosis and hematological toxicities were estimated in the treated group and compared with the untreated group.
Histopathological Investigation
Animals from all the treatment groups were sacrificed at the end of the observation period by the cervical dislocation method. The small sections (5 μm) of the nasal mucosa were isolated from freshly killed animals. These sections of isolated organs were stored at 10% neutral buffered formalin solution. Prior to analysis, all sections were cleaned and stained by hematoxylin and eosin staining reagent. The stained sections were examined for any toxicity and necrosis under a light microscope ( , ). The structural changes were determined in the treated group and compared with a control group section.
Statistical Analysis
The result of hematological toxicity and permeation data were analyzed by Student’s t test and one-way ANOVA. That was found significant, and the probability values obtained (* p ≤ 0.05 and ** p ≤ 0.01) were considered statistically significant.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Selection of Components
The maximum solubility of OLZ was found in Labrafil M 1944 CS (55.3 mg/mL ± 0.9 mg/mL) than in the other lipids. The highest solubility of OLZ was seen in Compritol 888 ATO (230 mg/10 mg of OLZ) and Gelucire 44/14 (150 mg/10 mg of OLZ). Hence, these components were selected as solid lipid and stabilizer. The highest solubility of OLZ was found in Tween 80 (90.46 mg/mL) (Fig. 1 ). Tween 80 is a non-ionic surfactant, and it is commonly used in the nanoparticulate drug delivery system; the HLB value of the selected surfactant is more than 14. Therefore, it is preferred as a safe and effective surfactant for NLC drug delivery. The selected components are biodegradable and biocompatible for OLZ-loaded lipid nanocarriers. Fig. 1 Characterization of the solubility of OLZ in a liquid lipids and surfactants and b solid lipids
Formulation and Optimization of OLZ-NLC
Selection of compositions for the optimized formulation was performed by Design-Expert software (Design-Expert 11), where the optimized OLZ-NLC formulation was composed of Compritol 888 ATO (solid lipid), Labrafil M 1944 CS (liquid lipid), and Tween 80 (surfactant). The OLZ-NLCs were formulated and optimized by the three-factor, three-level Box–Behnken design. The experimental design, with a layout developed for 17 possible batches of OLZ-NLC, is shown in Tables I and II . Finally, the software suggested the quantities of a drug, total lipid, and surfactant for the preparation of NLC, which were found to be 20–40 mg, 210:90–270:30 mg, and 400–800 mg, respectively. The particle size ( Y 1 ), PDI ( Y 2 ), and % EE ( Y 3 ) were found to be in the range of 81.66–220.15 nm, 0.31–0.97, and 69.19–89.61%, respectively. The NLC formulation batch F2 showed significant results with responses such as particle size, PDI, and % EE. The globule size of NLC formulation was found in a nanometer ( , , ). As observed in Fig. 2 a–c, the factors B (solid + liquid lipid = total lipid) and C (surfactant) have a significant effect on particle size. The size of NLC particles decreases if the concentration of B and C increases due to the increase in the emulsifying efficiency of the surfactant and the decrease in particle aggregation. The maximum amount of liquid lipid decreased the viscosity and surface tension inside NLC particles, which responsible for the reduction of particle size. However, the effect of B and C is very significant than that of A (drug). The small PDI indicates a narrow size distribution of globules that means the uniform distribution of particles. Similarly, factors B and C have a significant effect on PDI. The PDI of NLC decreases if the concentration of B and C increases; however, the effect of B and C is very significant than that of A . Figure 2 d–f represents that the factors B and C have a significant effect on % EE, while the % EE of the NLC increases if the concentration of B and C increases due to an increase in the amount of total lipid, which significantly provides more space for the accumulation of drug particles and also reduces the escape of drug into the external phase. However, the effect of B and C is very significant than that of A . A significant increase in % EE was found with an increment of total lipid concentration as more of the drug particles were entrapped in the core of lipid. The p value was found to be less than 0.05% that was significant in the case of a quadratic model for all responses, while this model has been selected for further study. The F value obtained was within the limit, while every model term was found significant. Hence, all formulation factors ( A , B , and C ) were found significant for responses Y 1 to Y 3 and are shown in Eqs. ( 6 ), ( 7 ), and ( 8 ).

The larger size of NLC particles was retarded the drug permeation, release, and absorption. But, the optimized formulation F2 showed maximum % EE, as well as the desired particle size and PDI; hence, this formulation was selected for further study. The optimized NLC formulation F2 consists of drug (20 mg), total lipid (240 mg:60 mg), and surfactant (800 mg) that fulfilled the optimum requirements, including nanometric particle size (88.95 nm ± 1.7 nm), optimum PDI (0.31 ± 0.01), and maximum % EE (88.94% ± 3.9%). The percentage error < 5% was obtained, concluding that the experimental values were exactly matched to the predicted values (Fig. 2 g, h). Percentage error was useful to determine the reality of created equations and to clarify the significance of response surface methodology ( , ). The % EE represented the predicted regression coefficient ( R 2 ) (0.9150) value that was very close to the adjusted R 2 (0.8058) value. Particle size reflects the closeness between predicted R 2 (0.9460) and actual R 2 (0.8768) values. Hence, the results obtained from an experimental method were accurate and reproducible for NLC formulation.
Physico-Chemical Characterization of OLZ Nanoparticles
Particle size and PDI of the optimized NLC formulation were found to be 88.95 nm ± 1.7 nm (Fig. 3 a) and 0.31 ± 0.01, respectively. The small PDI indicates the uniform distribution of NLC particles; hence, the uniform drug was released through the monodispersed NLC formulation. The nanosized formulation has a larger surface area, which provides an effective brain delivery through the i.n. route. Fig. 3 Characterization of OLZ-NLC nanocarriers by the a globule size and size distribution, b zeta potential and surface charge, and c , d SEM imaging and surface morphology of OLZ-NLC
Characterization of zeta potential is employed for the analysis of surface charge of the nanoparticulate systems. The Tween 80 and Gelucire 44/14, being a non-ionic surfactant and stabilizer, respectively, stabilize the formulation by steric stabilization because of the presence of a hydrophobic tail which prevent the particles from agglomeration due to the static repulsion. The obtained zeta potential of OLZ-NLC, OLZ-MNLC (P+H), and OLZ-MNLC (C) formulations was recorded as − 22.62 mV ± 1.9 mV (Fig. 3 b), − 20.84 mV ± 1.3 mV, and − 15.72 mV ± 1.1 mV, respectively, which causes the electrostatic repulsion in the nanoparticulate system. The outcome of this experiment suggests the stability of a nanoparticulate system, where the non-ionic surfactants produced a negative charge on NLC particles.
Entrapment efficiency (% EE) of a formulation depends on the nature of an oil phase. The maximum amount of total lipid provides a higher percentage of EE, as more of the drug particles were entrapped in the core of lipid phase, and it even provides more space for entrapment of a drug. The % EE and drug loading of OLZ-NLC were found to be 88.94% ± 3.9% and 5.92% ± 0.16%, respectively. An optimized formulation showed higher % EE and high loading capacity. Hence, the maximum amount of drug could deliver towards the site of action through the optimized formulation.
The morphology of the optimized formulation was studied by scanning electron microscopy, and it was revealed that the shape of NLC particles was spherical (Fig. 3 c, d). The microscopical images indicate that no aggregation was seen in the NLC particles. Further, SEM analysis revealed the uniform distribution of spherical shape particles, which was compatible with the microscopical investigation.
The mucociliary clearance is a special characteristic of the nasal mucosa since the liquid formulations were washed out from the nasal cavity ( , ). Inappropriate residence time is the main barrier for i.n. absorption of a drug. Mucoadhesive polymers help to enhance the adhesion of delivered formulation in the nasal cavity; hence, the residence time was also enhanced. The optimized OLZ-MNLC (P+H) and OLZ-MNLC (C) showed 4.90 g and 3.20 g of mucoadhesive force to detach the contact between the formulation and mucosa. It suggests a good contact between the developed formulation and nasal mucosa and thus could deliver the entrapped drug to the site of action via prolonged residence at the nasal cavity.
The % cumulative OLZ release of optimized OLZ-NLC, OLZ-MNLC (P+H), and OLZ-MNLC (C) was found to be 55.10% ± 0.51%, 92.36% ± 0.48%, and 72.59% ± 0.32%, respectively (Fig. 4 a). The mucoadhesive NLC system showed rapid OLZ release than the plane NLC due to the presence of mucoadhesive and in situ gelling agents. The main application of mucoadhesive agent was to enhance the adhesion between mucous membrane and formulation for a longer period of time; hence, a loss of formulation from the nasal cavity was decreased; thereby, rapid drug release has occurred. The OLZ-MNLC (P+H) showed significant OLZ release than the OLZ-NLC and OLZ-MNLC (C); hence, the OLZ-MNLC (P+H) must be suggested as a possible delivery tool of OLZ for CNS disorders. Table III indicates that the Higuchi and Hixon–Crowell cube root models showed highest R 2 values (0.9819 and 0.9903) for OLZ-MNLC (P+H) and OLZ-MNLC (C); hence, these models were significant for OLZ-loaded NLC formulations. These models obeyed the initial burst release of OLZ within 60 min and the sustained release for a longer period of time due to the in situ gelling agent. This indicates that the diffusion rate of OLZ decreases because of the decrease in concentration gradients due to the gel dissolution.

Ex Vivo Permeation and Nasal Tissue Toxicity
A natural membrane reveals the actual drug permeation characteristics. The histology of the sheep nasal mucosa is relatively similar with that of the epithelium of human nasal mucosa; thereby, the sheep nasal mucosa was chosen for this current study. It has been established that the lipid nanocarriers play a significant role in the enhancement of the permeability of lipophilic drug molecules ( ). The experimental outcomes of permeability study revealed that 54.51% ± 0.97% (545.12 μg/cm 2 ± 12.8 μg/cm 2 ), 94.00% ± 0.95% (940.02 μg/cm 2 ± 15.5 μg/cm 2 ), and 82.01% ± 0.85% (820.10 μg/cm 2 ± 11.3 μg/cm 2 ) of OLZ were permeated from OLZ-NLC, OLZ-MNLC (P+H), and OLZ-MNLC (C), respectively, through the sheep nasal mucosa within the time frame of 8 h. The results indicated that the permeation rate of OLZ-MNLC (P+H) was higher than that of OLZ-NLC and OLZ-MNLC (C), where the optimized OLZ-MNLC (P+H) provided significant drug permeation when compared with the OLZ-NLC and OLZ-MNLC (C) (Fig. 4 b). The OLZ nanoformulations showed rapid drug release within 1 h and then sustained release for 8 h.
Simultaneously, the steady-state flux ( J ss ) and permeability coefficient ( P app ) of OLZ-loaded lipid nanocarriers were carried out for 8 h and it was found significant for OLZ-MNLC (P+H) (** p < 0.01) (Table IV ). The J ss of OLZ-NLC, OLZ-MNLC (P+H), and OLZ-MNLC (C) was found to be 38.310 μg/cm 2 /h ± 1.81 μg/cm 2 /h, 65.951 μg/cm 2 /h ± 1.64 μg/cm 2 /h, and 52.386 μg/cm 2 /h ± 1.22 μg/cm 2 /h, respectively. The OLZ-MNLC (P+H) showed sustained permeation of OLZ through the nasal mucosa; hence, the J ss and P app of OLZ-MNLC (P+H) were highly significant than those of OLZ-MNLC (C) ( , ). The intranasal drug delivery was occupied by two major paths (transcellular and paracellular routes). Lipid nanocarriers have an ability to enhance the rate of permeation of OLZ through the paracellular and transcellular pathways. The lipophilicity and smaller molecular weight of drug molecules are responsible for a better permeability. The partition coefficient of drugs also affects the rate and extent of nasal absorption. The mucoadhesive agents are responsible for the opening of the tight junction of a barrier and thereby enhance the delivery of therapeutics towards the site of action. The OLZ-MNLC (P+H) shows better OLZ permeation than the other formulations; hence, it was considered as a potential carrier for the delivery of olanzapine and it was used for further studies.

The nasal tissue toxicity studies were carried out in an attempt to investigate the possible toxic effects of developed formulations on the nasal mucosa in a chronic treatment. Safety of optimized nanoformulations was demonstrated using the thin sections of sheep nasal mucosa. The treated section was microscopically examined for any structural changes as well as for a sign of toxicity after being compared with a control mucosa. Figure 5 indicates that the optimized OLZ-loaded nanoformulations neither cause the tissue necrosis nor cause the harmful effect on a microscopic structure of nasal mucosa. Hence, the developed formulation was possibly considered as safe for nasal administration.

In Vivo Studies
Brain Distribution of OLZ-Loaded Nanocarriers
The radiolabeling efficiency of OLZ with 99m TC radioisotope was tested for 99m Tc-OLZ-MNLC (P+H) (i.n.) and 99m Tc-OLZ-NLC (i.v.), where the experimental outcomes demonstrated more than 90% radioactivity for all the formulations. The complex formation of OLZ with 99m Tc depends on the pH of the experimental mixture. The optimized pH value of OLZ-MNLC (P+H) i.n. formulation was found to be 6.4. Similarly, the pH value of i.v. formulation was found to be 6.5. The 99m Tc-OLZ-MNLC (P+H) i.n. formulation showed 93.85% ± 0.9% of radiolabeling, whereas the 99m Tc-OLZ-NLC i.v. formulation showed 96.35% ± 0.9% labeling efficiency. The radiolabeled formulations remain stable for 24 h, and all formulations were found suitable for brain distribution study.
Brain distribution study in the experimental animals for 99m Tc-OLZ-loaded lipid nanocarriers was carried out at predetermined time points, such as 30 min, 120 min, 240 min, and 360 min following i.n. and i.v. administrations in Swiss albino mice. OLZ concentration in the brain after i.n. administration of 99m Tc-OLZ-MNLC (P+H) was found to be 624 ng at 30 min, 936 ng at 120 min, 514 ng at 240 min, and 215 ng at 360 min (Fig. 6 a). Correspondingly, the concentration of OLZ in the brain after i.v. dosing of 99m Tc-OLZ-NLC was found to be 108 ng at 30 min, 235 ng at 120 min, 154 ng at 240 min, and 92 ng at 360 min. The results of the brain distribution study of OLZ i.n. formulation proved that the 99m Tc-OLZ-MNLC (P+H) significantly enhanced OLZ concentration in the brain than the i.v. administration of 99m Tc-OLZ-NLC (* p < 0.05). Fig. 6 The mean a brain and b blood concentration–time curve for 99m TC-OLZ-MNLC (i.n.) and 99m TC-OLZ-NLC (i.v.). c Comparison of the brain-to-blood ratio of intranasal and intravenous administration at 30 min, 120 min, 240 min, and 360 min
From the representation in Fig. 6 b, it could be demonstrated that the i.v. administration of 99m Tc-OLZ-NLC had shown the highest radioactivity accumulation in the blood and site of administration probably because of the direct administration of this formulation into the systemic circulation at higher concentration, which is the underlying cause of the associated hematological toxicity. Alternatively, the blood concentration of 99m Tc-OLZ-loaded lipid nanocarriers was found lower when delivered through the i.n. route than the 99m Tc-OLZ-NLC (i.v.) (* p < 0.05). The brain-to-blood ratio of 99m Tc-OLZ i.n. and i.v. formulations was calculated and is represented in Fig. 6 c. The brain-to-blood ratio was found to be higher in the i.n. formulation than in the i.v. administration of the nanocarriers, and the results were observed as follows: 99m Tc-OLZ-MNLC (P+H) i.n. (3.98 ng ± 0.8 ng) > 99m Tc-OLZ-NLC i.v. (0.156 ng ± 0.05 ng) after 120 min post administration. The result indicates the controlled drug release from the nanocarriers, which has been started within the first hour of i.n. administration. The 99m Tc-OLZ-NLC showed maximum ( C max = 1987 ng) drug concentration in the blood, followed by an exponential decrease in C max depending upon time. Comparatively, the i.n. administration of 99m Tc-OLZ-MNLC (P+H) showed the highest concentration of OLZ in the brain (936 ng). Thereby, the brain distribution of OLZ was found to be significant for 99m TC-OLZ-MNLC (P+H) via the i.n. route; hence, the i.n. administration was proved the effective distribution of OLZ to the brain ( , ). The safer delivery of OLZ confirms that the maximum concentration of drug reaches into the brain, whereas the lesser amount of OLZ has passed into the blood circulation. Thus, it has possibly reduced the risk of hematological toxicities as compared to the conventional formulations.
Agranulocytosis and Cytotoxic Effect on WBCs
A hematological safety study was performed for determination of toxicological indication after the i.n. administration of OLZ nanoformulations ( , ). This study demonstrates olanzapine-induced agranulocytosis and hemolysis during the experimental period in male Wistar rats.
Agranulocytosis study of OLZ was performed on experimental animals, which was treated by low (1 mg/kg), medium (2 mg/kg), and high (4 mg/kg) doses of OLZ nanoformulations for 28 days. The OLZ is associated with agranulocytosis and leukopenia ( , ). The animals were regularly examined for mortality and toxicity during the study period. The leukocyte count for the treatment group was found within the standard physiological range (Fig. 7 a). Similarly, RBC and platelet counts were also found to be within normal physiological range when compared with those of standard control animals (** p < 0.01) (Fig. 7 b, c). The experimental outcomes of hematotoxicity study revealed that all hematological parameters were found to be in normal physiological range and the OLZ-MNLC (P+H) i.n. formulation did not show any alteration in the hematology of the animals. Because the OLZ-MNLC (P+H) formulation contains mucoadhesive agent, which holds the formulation into the nasal cavity for the longer period of time, the limited amount of drug has been passed into the blood (Fig. 6 b) and decreases the risk of hematological toxicity. The i.n. route bypassed the blood–brain barrier and reduced the dose as well as the dosing frequencies of a drug as compared to the conventional therapies. Therefore, a decrease in the OLZ blood concentration generates the safe delivery of therapeutic towards the site of action. Fig. 7 Effect of OLZ-MNLC (P+H) i.n. formulation on hematological parameters for the different groups: group I (normal control), group II (treated with 1 mg/kg OLZ-MNLC), group III (treated with 2 mg/kg OLZ-MNLC), and group IV (treated with 4 mg/kg OLZ-MNLC) animals. a Differential WBC, b RBC parameter, and c hemoglobin and platelet counts (mean value ± SD, ** p < 0.01, compared with the control group)
Histopathological Studies
Finally, the effect of 28 days of repeated single-dose administration of low, medium, and high doses of OLZ-MNLC (P+H) on the nasal mucosa sections was examined by histopathology. The microscopical images of the nasal mucosa of the treated groups did not reflect any physiological changes as compared to the control group (Fig. 8 ). The OLZ-MNLC (P+H) (4 mg/kg)-treated animals showed slight degeneration in the mucosa section, due to the high dose and acute treatment, but did not reveal any structural changes in the histological section, whereas the OLZ-MNLC (P+H) low and medium dose-treated histological sections were seen in normal form and did not reflect any necrosis and structural changes. Hence, the OLZ-MNLC (P+H) formulation could be safe and effective for the brain delivery of OLZ via the i.n. route.

CONCLUSIONS
Nanostructured lipid carriers incorporated with mucoadhesive and gelling agents were successfully loaded with the antipsychotic agent OLZ. The optimized NLC formulation showed the desired size with optimum zeta potential which proved the stability of a formulation. The brain distribution study confirmed that the NLC formulations could bypass the BBB via delivery through the i.n. route and reach effectively at the site of action. The in vivo hematotoxicity study revealed that the developed OLZ-MNLC (P+H) formulation was safe and effective for the delivery of OLZ in the brain for the treatment of schizophrenia without showing any risk of agranulocytosis and leukopenia. Hence, it can be concluded that OLZ-MNLC (P+H) has a great prospect for the safe and economic delivery of antipsychotic agents in the treatment of CNS disorders.
