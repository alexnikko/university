Introduction
Fish are poikilothermic vertebrates and are in in close relationship with their environment; hence, any change in their habitat will directly affect the physiology of fish. So, the analysis of blood parameters will reveal the conditions within the body of the fish before there is any visible manifestation of disease (Musa and Omoregie ; Okechukwu et al. ). Haematological indices are therefore widely used by ichthyologists and researchers of the world over as early warn signal of changes in the health status of the animal. Fernades and Mazon ( ) reported that blood of fish is closely related to the animal response to either natural or artificial changes in its environment. Haematological studies help in understanding the relationship of blood characteristics to the habitat; and adaptability of the species to the environment, for the successful management of any type of hatchery and fish farm, knowledge on the species concerned is a prerequisite. As the aquaculture industry expands, tools to monitor the health status of fish using standardised non-lethal and expressive methods are required. The use of haematological indices in commercial fish cultivation may enhance production by facilitating early detection of the situations of stress and/or diseases that can affect production (Rehulka et al. ; Tavares-Dias and Barcellos ). This, in turn, will contribute to more specific, timely and effective disease treatments in the future. The study of piscine haematology has contributed significantly to our understanding on the comparative physiology, phylogenetic relationships, habit, habitat, food selection and other significant ecological parameters of fishes (Ayotunde and Ochang , ). The main objective of this present study was to compare the haematological parameters and morphometry of erythrocytes of Heteropneustes fossilis , Clarias batrachus , Channa punctatus , Channa striatus and Anabas testudineus of captured in two different habitats, Chilika lagoon and Kausalyaganga pond of Odisha, India, with the aim to understand how the difference in chemical-physical parameters of water influences haematological parameters.
Materials and methods
Fishes were obtained from two sites namely Kausalyaganga pond (Fig. 1 a), the freshwater habitat and Kalupadaghat (Fig. 1 b); the northern sector of Chilika lagoon is the brackish water habitat. Chilika lagoon spreads over Puri, Khordha and Ganjam districts of Odisha state on the east coast of India covering an area of over 1100 km 2 . It flows into the Bay of Bengal at the mouth of the Daya river. It is the largest coastal lagoon in India and the second largest coastal lagoon in the world. In 1981, Chilika lagoon was designated the first Indian wetland of international importance under the Ramsar Convention. Fig. 1 Collection sites of fish. a Kausalyaganga pond. b .

For this study, healthy, adult live fishes of 15 from each sex of each studied species were collected from both fresh and brackish water habitat during monsoon period, i.e., from June to September. For both sites of collection), physiochemical parameters of the water are measured. Water sampling was carried out in the same date of fish sampling. Physiochemical parameters of water like dissolved oxygen and alkalinity were estimated by Winkler’s methods (Strickland and Parsons ) and salinity by Boyle’s method (Boyle ) whereas, the pH and temperature of water were measured by using microprocessor based pH system (ESICO) and thermometer, respectively.
For haematological analysis, blood was collected from live fish by placing it on a tray. A damp cloth was used to cover the fish head. No anaesthetising agent was used at the time of collection of blood. A small sample like 2 ml of blood was drawn from the caudal vein during the morning hour from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. to avoid diurnal variation. The collected blood was transferred from the syringe into ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) containing vials.
The haematological parameters like Hb % was estimated using Sahli’s acid haematin method (Sahli ) with Sahli’s haemometer with the help of 0.1 N HCl. TLC and TEC were counted by using haemocytometer having Neubauer’s chamber (Dacie and Lewis ) and Turk’s and Hayem’s fluid, respectively. PCV was estimated by centrifuging the Wintrobe haematocrit tube containing blood at 3500 rpm for 15 min. MCV, MCH and MCHC were calculated from the value of PCV, TEC and Hb % of the blood as per appropriate formula (Dacie and Lewis ). For evaluating morphology and morphometry of blood cells, blood smears were prepared at the time of collection of blood and stained with Leishman’s stain. Cytomorphometry of different types of blood cells was studied from the smeared blood slides. Dimensions of all cell types like length and breadth were measured using Microscope Eyepiece Digital Camera (CatCam130–1.3 Mega Pixel (MP), Code No. CC130, Catalyst Biotech, Maharashtra, India, attached to Hund Wetzlar Microscope GmbH, Wetzlar-Nauborn, Germany) and computer. For this investigation, 30 cells, randomly selected from different smears from different fishes were measured.
Statistical analysis
Haematological and cytomorphometrical meters were expressed as mean ± SE. The entire data obtained were subjected to Paleontological Statistics (PAST) Version 2.17 [Natural History Museum, University of Oslo] for one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s pair wise comparison tests. Differences were classified as significant at p < 0.001.
Results
Parameters of both the freshwater and brackish water fish collection sites are measured and recorded (Table 1 ). This investigation estimates the haematological parameters of Heteropneustes fossilis (Bloch, 1794) (Fig. 2 a), Clarias batrachus (Linnaues, 1758) (Fig. 2 b), Channa striatus (Bloch, 1793) (Fig. 2 c) , Channa punctatus (Bloch, 1793) (Fig. 2 d) and Anabas testudineus (Bloch, 1792) (Fig. 2 e) with respect to habitat. The concentration of haemoglobin deviates significantly with respect to habitat at p < 0.001 showing higher value in freshwater fishes in comparison to brackish water ones (Table 2 ).Similar to freshwater fishes significantly, higher level of total erythrocyte count/red blood cell count (TEC/RBC) is observed to be more in freshwater fishes in comparison to brackish water ones. The TEC is ranging from 2.11 to 3.1 (×10 6 /mm3) in freshwater fishes while 1.7 to 2.49 (×10 6 /mm3) in brackish water fishes. The TEC deviates significantly with respect to habitat at p < 0.001 level (Table 3 ). The effect of habitat on packed cell volume (PCV) is considered in this investigation (Table 4 ). This shows higher value in freshwater fishes in comparison to same fish collected from brackish water habitat. This means they deviate significantly with respect to habitat except following fishes, though these fishes have more PCV in freshwater fishes but do not vary significantly in males of Clarias batrachus (freshwater = 30.2 ± 1.31 and brackish water = 28.12 ± 1.18), females of Clarias batrachus (freshwater = 28.6 ± 1.29 and brackish water = 25.5 ± 1.21), males of Channa punctatus (freshwater = 24.46 ± 0.69 and brackish water = 21.53 ± 0.89), females of Channa punctatus (freshwater = 24.33 ± 0.88 and brackish water = 21.6 ± 1.32) and females of Anabas testudineus (freshwater = 32.86 ± 0.98 and brackish water = 28.73 ± 0.82). Erythrocyte indices like mean cell volume (MCV), mean cell haemoglobin (MCH) and mean cell haemoglobin concentration (MCHC) are used to define the size of red blood cells and haemoglobin content in the blood. These are also useful for providing additional information for the identification of different types of anaemia. Depending on erythrocyte indices, anaemia may be characterised as microcytic, normocytic and macrocytic anaemia. Comparative analyses of erythrocyte indices with respect to habitat reflect significant differences at p < 0.001 level (Table 5 ). It is noted that erythrocyte indices show more value in brackish water fishes in comparison to freshwater fishes except Heteropneustes fossilis and Anabas testudineus . MCV varies with respect to habitat both in males (freshwater = 134.34 ± 8.98 and brackish water = 99.25 ± 3.08) and females (freshwater = 146.98 ± 11.21 and brackish water = 99.00 ± 5.35) of Heteropneustes fossilis and both in males (freshwater = 109.64 ± 4.53 and brackish water = 147.05 ± 10.19) and females (freshwater = 115.53 ± 5.08 and brackish water = 156.65 ± 13.02) of Clarias batrachus (freshwater = 109.64 ± 4.53 and brackish water = 156.65 ± 13.02). The MCH also shows significant difference in males (freshwater = 38.05 ± 1.40 and brackish water = 31.70 ± 0.92) and females (freshwater = 38.70 ± 1.30 and brackish water = 33.90 ± 1.95) of Heteropneustes fossilis , males (freshwater = 33.25 ± 0.74 and brackish water = 49.94 ± 3.27) and females (freshwater = 33.28 ± 1.71 and brackish water = 53.52 ± 4.11) of Clarias batrachus, both in males (freshwater = 40.05 ± 1.93 and brackish water = 49.57 ± 7.30) and females (freshwater = 33.74 ± 1.96 and brackish water = 41.76 ± 4.70) of Channa striatus and males of Channa punctatus (freshwater = 34.69 ± 1.54 and brackish water = 40.20 ± 5.10). This investigation also records white blood cell count with respect to habitat (Table 6 ). The WBCs show the highest value in brackish water fishes than freshwater but exception is observed in females of some species namely Heteropneustes fossilis (freshwater = 11.10 ± 0.63 and brackish water = 10.94 ± 0.76), Clarias batrachus (freshwater = 9.80 ± 0.62 and brackish water = 8.45 ± 0.48), Channa striatus (freshwater = 8.01 ± 0.50 and brackish water = 7.99 ± 0.55) and Channa punctatus (freshwater = 8.02 ± 0.22 and brackish water = 7.55 ± 0.40). Statistical significant difference is observed at p < 0.001 only in females of Anabas testudineus (freshwater = 8.08 ± 0.22 and brackish water = 10.41 ± 0.70) with respect to habitat.

Discussion
This investigation investigates and interpreted the effect of habitat on haematological parameters of fishes. This study records higher haemoglobin concentration in freshwater fishes in comparison to brackish water one. This may be associated with osmoregulatory dysfunction induced by salinity level. This corroborates the study on rainbow trout (Zeitoun et al. ). Banerjee et al. ( ) report that blood composition of fishes is constant under normal condition with little variation. However, the composition of blood can be changed by habitat, dietary treatment, malnutrition and disease condition (Feist and Longshaw ). Like that of haemoglobin concentration, the TEC has higher number in freshwater fishes. This may be due to the variation of salinity and pH (Geetha ). As fish are very susceptible to physical and chemical changes in the environment, this may be reflected in their blood components (Adeyemo et al. ). Banerjee and Banerjee ( ) have also reported varying erythrocytes count in fishes which depends upon the extent of adaptability to aquatic condition. Packed cell volume measures the percentage of total erythrocyte count present in given amount of blood. PCV also deviates significantly with respect to habitat at p < 0.001. The PCV count is related to the environmental factor and salinity (Graham ). However, changes in water balance cause an osmotic effect in the red blood cell and finally decreases the PCV (Cameron ). The lower volume of RBCs recorded in brackish water fishes which may be due to osmotic changes caused by ion leakage from the plasma (Alwan et al. ). The decreased volume of RBC also results in lower percentages of PCV in brackish water fishes. It is observed that except MCHC, other two erythrocyte indices like MCV and MCH deviate significantly with respect to salinity; these results are in accordance with the findings of previous result (Gabriel et al. ). In the current study, erythrocyte indices increase with increasing salinity of water. This is similar with the findings of Brown et al. ( ) in pikeperch. But, Francesco et al. ( ) report high salinity and temperature lead to a lower MCH and MCHC values; this contradicts the present findings. In fish, as in mammals, blood cells particularly WBC are frequently used as an indicator of status of health because WBCs are key components of innate immunity, and leukocytes are involved in the regulation of immunological function of the organisms (Duthie and Tort ; Gallardo et al. ; Ballarin et al. ). Particularly, brackish water fishes reflect more WBC count than freshwater fishes and deviate with respect to habitat at p < 0.001. This may probably be due to salinity, which is believed to stimulate the production of leukocytes, especially lymphocyte or may be affected by of water temperature and reproduction period (Bayir ).
Conclusion
The variation of haematological parameters due to habitat emphasises the fact that changes in blood characteristics are important indices in monitoring the environmental changes and understanding the physiological adaptive capacity of freshwater fishes to brackish water habitat.
