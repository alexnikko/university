Introduction
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an aggressive type of brain cancer with a large growth potential and a very poor clinical outcome. It accounts for 54 % of all diagnosed gliomas in the United States and is regarded as being incurable, which is illustrated by a median survival of less than 1 year and a 5-year survival rate below 5 % (Dolecek et al. ; Lima et al. ). GBM tumors can be found in most areas of the central nervous system (CNS), but are most commonly located in the frontal lobes of the supratentorial compartments (Kanu et al. ). GBM can be subcategorized into two groups, termed primary and secondary GBM. Primary GBM are de novo-occurring tumors often characterized by alterations or overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene (Talasila et al. ; Verhaak et al. ). This is also the most prominent subtype of GBM. The characteristics of secondary GBM include the progressive addition of mutations in p53, platelet-derived growth factor receptor and Retinoblastoma genes (Verhaak et al. ).
Diseases prognosis in GBM is commonly based on histological classification, patient age, tumor size and location within the CNS, because all of these factors are independent predictive indicators of patient survival. However, the sustained poor overall survival of GBM patients has raised the demand of new prognostic indicators to aid in the clinical decision-making (Lima et al. ). To fulfill this demand, molecular biomarkers have been developed based on chromosomal aberrations, methylation status of the methyl guanine methyl transferase (MGMT) promoter, mutations in important genes [isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1), EGFR and p53] and dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) (Chaudhry et al. ). Of particular interest, the expressional profile of specific miRNA signatures correlates with overall survival, time-to-progression and treatment success (Lakomy et al. ; Wang et al. ; Yan et al. ).
MiRNA is a family of noncoding and interfering RNAs with a length of approximately 22 nucleotides, which are capable of binding to the 3′ untranslated regions (3′UTR) of target mRNA products (Bartel ; Lagos-Quintana ). This binding results in a negative post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Since the perfect complementarity between a miRNA and its mRNA target is not required, a single miRNA can bind to and inhibit the translation of multiple gene targets (Winter et al. ).
GBM tumors are characterized by dysregulation of numerous miRNAs, which plays a role both in tumorigenesis and recurrence, due to their modulation of several cancer hallmarks such as proliferation, invasion, radio- and chemosensitivity, and angiogenesis (Møller et al. ). Therefore, an increasing interest has been devoted to the development of miRNA-based prognostic signatures to aid in the clinical decision-making. We recently reviewed all literature pertaining to the use of miRNA expression profiles as prognostic and/or diagnostic biomarkers (Henriksen et al. ). This work revealed a large number of available miRNA signatures correlating with disease outcome and survival, but the level of coherency between the different signatures was low. Interestingly, the great use of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data did not reveal any particular coherency across the studies, possibly due to the different types of data that can be extracted from this database. The type of control tissue varied between the studies and was often derived from other diseased brains. Interestingly, several of the miRNAs found to be associated with either risk or protection have multiple targets validated in model cell culture systems opposite to what would be expected from such an association. This could point to the fact that these in vitro evaluations may not be good indicators for the multifactorial clinical progression of GBM. Some miRNAs were present in several signatures, suggesting that they could be of interest both in prognosis and as therapeutic targets (Henriksen et al. ). However, a combination of molecular profiling (e.g., with miRNA signatures) and clinicopathological findings is seldom seen.
This present study aims to combine clinicopathological findings with molecular profiling of GBM tumors and to identify connections between these features that may have the potential of predicting survival and illuminate aspects of GBM pathogenesis.
Materials and Methods
Collection of Tumor Samples
The study was reviewed and approved by the regional Committee on Biomedical Research Ethics in Northern Jutland, Denmark prior to execution of the experiments, and all patients provided informed consent for the use of tumor samples. Surgically resected GBM specimens were obtained from the Department of Neurosurgery at Aalborg University Hospital from November 2010 to June 2012, and all relevant clinical information was extracted from patient journals. The diagnoses were confirmed by immunohistochemistry against nestin, Ki67 and GFAP using the routine methodology at the Institute of Pathology, Aalborg University Hospital. Out of the 47 patients initially enrolled in the study, tumor samples from only fourteen patients were included for further analysis. The fourteen patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria of the study: diagnosed with primary GBM, first-time resection, and before having received any sort of treatment. These stringent inclusion criteria were chosen because determination of a prognostic miRNA signature should be possible after first tumor resection. Median age of the patients was 61 years (range 27–85), and the gender ratio (men/women) was around 1:2 (five men/nine women). Surgery consisted of resection with (79 %) or without (21 %) tumor visualization by 5-aminolevulinic acid (5ALA)-induced fluorescence.
RNA Isolation
Total RNA was isolated from fresh GBM tumor samples using the Aurum Total RNA Isolation kit (Bio-Rad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. RNA concentration and quality were assessed by spectrophotometry using a NanoDrop (NanoDrop products, Thermo Scientific, DE, USA).
MicroRNA Array
MiRNA expression profiling was performed using the TaqMan Low Density Array Cards A and B (Life Technologies, NY, USA). These analyses were performed in collaboration with AROS Applied Biotechnology, Aarhus, Denmark. The cards contained assays for 750 mature human miRNAs present in the Sanger miRBase v19.0. The Ct value of an endogenous control gene (MammU6) was used for normalization, and a cut off of 40 was set as threshold for the Ct value. In order to define miRNA patterns, hierarchical clustering identified clusters based on expressional similarity. First, the miRNAs with most varying levels of expression were identified based on median absolute deviation (MAD) with a cut off at the first quartile. MAD is a robust statistic and a measure of dispersion in univariate samples, which is more resilient to outliers than the standard deviation. A similarity matrix was then generated containing all pairwise similarities between samples. Finally, the Euclidean distance and complete linkage was applied to compute the similarities.
Microarray Analysis of Gene Expression
HumanHT - 12 V3 Expression BeadChip (Illumina, CA, USA) arrays were performed at AROS Applied Biotechnology, Aarhus, Denmark to investigate the expression of 34602 unique mRNA transcripts in the fourteen GBM tumor samples. The arrays were quantile normalized and evaluated with R using the Bioconducter R-package lumi for beadarrays, and the expression of relevant target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs was determined (Dunning et al. ).
Bioinformatics
Text data mining of functional characteristics of miRNA target interactions was downloaded through miRTarBase (accessed January 25, 2014) (Hsu et al. ). Targets for selected miRNAs were examined for correlation with the miRNA clustering (Mann–Whitney U test; p < 0.05), where only targets differentially expressed were considered. These were further investigated for connection to GBM through various literature databases using combinations of keywords including: “gene name of target,” “gene nomenclature of target,” “glioblastoma multiforme,” “GBM” and “glioma.” Gene nomenclature was used according to the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee at the European Bioinformatics Institute ( http://www.genenames.org ). Furthermore, a systematic review of all known mRNA targets of miRNAs in GBM was consulted (Møller et al. ).
A number of previous studies have provided miRNA signatures associated with survival or progression in GBM and reported that individual miRNAs of these signatures could be regarded as either protective or risk-associated, most often based on determination of the hazard ratio (reviewed in Henriksen et al. ). In addition, the miRNAs were analyzed for any modulating properties on the mesenchymal mode of migration and invasion (MMMI) (Møller et al. ; Zhong et al. ). The miRNAs determined in this study were analyzed with respect to miRNAs known to be in these two categories, and dysregulation of known validated targets mRNAs were analyzed in the microarray analysis data. The presence of exosome-packaging-associated motifs (EXO-motif) was investigated in all differentially expressed miRNAs by analyzing all mature sequences for their content of four individual EXO-motifs (GGAG, UGAG, CCCU and UCCU), as recently reported in Villarroya-Beltri et al. ( ).
Statistical Analysis
Prior to clustering, the most differentially expressed miRNAs across all tumor samples were identified using the MAD. Statistical significance of aberrantly expressed miRNAs between the two clusters was determined by the non-parametric Mann–Whitney U test in TM4 MultiExperiment Viewer. Survival analyses were based on Kaplan–Meier plot with univariate testing performed by means of the log-rank test and Fisher’s Exact test using GraphPad Prism 5. A p value <0.05 was considered as significant.
Results
Clinical Data
Tissue from fourteen GBM tumors isolated from patients was examined. The clinicopathological features of the fourteen GBM patients are presented in Table 1 . Median overall survival of the patient cohort was 57 weeks, ranging from 5 to 207 weeks. Median age was 61 years (range 27–85). The gender ratio (men/women) was 1:2 (five men/nine women). Surgery consisted of resection with (79 %) or without (21 %) tumor visualization by 5ALA-induced fluorescence. Six tumor samples exhibited increased positivity of the neural stem cell marker, nestin, while nine tumor samples had high expression of the proliferation indicator, Ki67, determined at the time of pathological diagnosis. All clinical features were analyzed with the univariate log-rank test to identify any correlations to patient survival. These analyses revealed that age [ p = 0.0497, Hazard ratio = 0.2230 (95 % CI 0.04982–0.9980)], nestin expression [ p = 0.0169, Hazard ratio = 7.799 (95 % CI 1.445–42.09)] and tumor recurrence [ p = 0.025, Hazard ratio = 0.176 (95 % CI 0.038–0.804)] were all predictors of patient outcome, while no correlations could be found between any other clinical feature and patient survival (Table 2 ).

MicroRNA Expression Profile Determines Patients Survival
The fourteen GBM tumor samples were tested by the TaqMan Low Density Array Cards to analyze the expression of 750 mature human miRNAs across two cards (A and B). Based on MAD, miRNAs were filtered with a threshold set at the first quartile calculated for all miRNAs with a MAD above zero. This resulted in 287 miRNAs, which had different expression levels across the fourteen tumor samples. These 287 miRNAs were used to make a hierarchical clustering of the samples, resulting in two distinct clusters (Fig. 1 ). The two clusters were analyzed by Kaplan–Meier estimation and univariate analysis for their correlation with respect clinical data such as overall survival. This analysis showed that the miRNA pattern clustering defined two groups of patients based on the clinical data, which corresponded to either long-term or short-term survival [ p = 0.030, Hazard ratio = 5.235 (95 % CI 1.170–23.43)] (Fig. 2 ). Fig. 1 Dendrogram presenting the hierarchical clustering of the tumor samples based on the expression profile of 287 miRNAs. The clustering was made based on the median absolute deviation, Euclidean distance and complete linking. Tumor numeration: C = tumor sample coding Fig. 2 Kaplan–Meier survival diagram for cluster 1 ( n = 7) or cluster 2 ( n = 7) based on hierarchical clustering of the tumor samples miRNA expression profile. Univariate analysis showed that the patients in cluster 1 had significantly longer survival than those in cluster 2 (log-rank test, p = 0.030)
Comparing the miRNA patterns between the two clusters defined a total of 161 miRNAs (cluster 1 vs. cluster 2), which had significantly different expression levels with a twofold change as a cut off. These upregulated miRNAs of cluster 1, indicative of long-term survival, were grouped based on current evidence of their aberrant expression profile in GBM tissue compared to normal brain tissue (Møller et al. ). The grouping showed that miRNAs upregulated in tumor samples from patients with long-term survival could be associated both with up- and downregulation in GBM. A small number of miRNAs had a disputed role in GBM pathogenesis, while almost a third of all the miRNAs identified in this experiment had no reported dysregulation in GBM. In addition, both validated oncogenic and tumor suppressor miRNAs were found between these long-term survival-associated miRNAs (Fig. 3 ; Supplementary Tables 1–4).

MicroRNAs Dysregulated Between Long- and Short-Term-Surviving Patients are Reported to Confer Risk or Protection or Modulate the Mesenchymal Mode of Migration and Invasion in GBM
Several of the miRNAs found to be dysregulated between short- and long-term surviving patients were previously reported to be involved in the tumorigenesis and progression of GBM. Some of these miRNAs have been reported to confer either risk or protection with regard to GBM patient survival, as was recently reviewed (Henriksen et al. ). Thirteen of the miRNAs with increased expression between the two clusters were previously found to confer either risk or protection. For each of these miRNAs, functionally verified targets were identified through miRTarBase, and the expression of these targets was analyzed using microarray gene expression analysis. Target genes with significantly different expression between the two clusters were identified and correlated to miRNAs with these genes proposed as their functional targets (presented in Table 3 ). The same analysis was performed to identify 16 miRNAs known to regulate the MMMI (Table 4 ) (Møller et al. ; Zhong et al. ). In total, three of these genes (E2F3, CTGF, Akt2) associated with the miRNAs conferring risk or protection or modulate the MMMI have been shown previously to be important validated targets of miRNAs responsible for disease progression in GBM (highlighted in bold).

Expression of miR-125b and the Neural Stem Cell Marker Nestin Correlate with Patient Survival
Since a positive correlation between nestin expression in GBM tumor tissue and the degree of malignancy has been reported, a univariate log-rank test was performed to determine any differences in nestin expression between the two clusters, showing that the level of nestin expression negatively correlated with patient survival ( p = 0.008). Next, the differentially expressed miRNAs were scrutinized for known negative regulators of nestin expression. From this analysis, miR-125b was found to have significant aberrant expression between the two clusters and to have nestin as a validated mRNA target (determined with miRTarBase). Univariate analysis of the distribution of miR-125b expression showed that miR-125b expression alone positively correlated with patient survival (log-rank test, p = 0.018). Interestingly, the gene expression level of nestin determined from the microarray analysis did not differ significantly between the two clusters, and no correlation between such expression and patients survival could be found (log-rank test, p = 0.318).
In theory, the expression of a single miRNA and the protein product of its validated targets should be negatively correlated. Thus, the tumor samples were grouped to determine such a correlation (low miR-125b + high nestin vs. high miR-125b + low nestin). A Fisher’s Exact test showed that the frequency of high miR-125b + low nestin was significantly higher in the patients with long-term survival ( n = 9, p = 0.039), and hence, this combination of molecular characteristics also correlated with patient survival (log-rank test, p = 0.003).
Exosome-Packaging Motifs in the Mature Sequences of Differentially Expressed MicroRNAs Indicate a Role in Paracrine Signaling
It was recently published that a number of miRNAs possess specific exosome-packaging motifs (EXO-motifs) in the mature sequence that guides them toward packaging and secretion in exosomes (Villarroya-Beltri et al. ). Therefore, all miRNAs with a significantly different expression between long- and short-term-surviving patients were investigated for their contents of these particular EXO-motif sequences. This analysis revealed that 61 out of 161 differentially expressed miRNAs possessed EXO-motifs in their mature sequences, indicating a role of these miRNAs in the paracrine communication between individual cells in GBM tumors (Table 5 ). Among the 61 miRNAs bearing EXO-motifs, miRNAs known to be upregulated or downregulated in GBM accounted for ~30 % each. Approximately ten percent had a disputed function, while the last ~30 % has no validated dysregulation or function in GBM. Several validated tumor suppressor miRNAs contained EXO-motifs, including two miRNAs (let-7a and miR-146b) that have previously been overexpressed in donor cells to be loaded into exosomes (Katakowski et al. ; Ohno et al. ). Interestingly, miR-125b, whose expression in combination with nestin expression correlated with patient survival, contained three individual EXO-motifs along its mature sequence (Fig. 4 ; Table 5 ).

Discussion
In this study, we have combined clinicopathological data with molecular profiling to identify an inverse relationship between the expression of the neural stem cell marker, nestin, and miR-125b—a relationship that correlated with survival in a cohort of primary GBM patients having not yet undergone treatment.
Several miRNA signatures that correlate to clinical progression or overall survival in GBM have been defined through the recent years. The coherency between these individual signatures is low, even though a large number of studies have been compiled from data extracted from similar databases and smaller scale tissue cohorts (Henriksen et al. ). The 161-miRNA signature associated with long-term survival contained in this study included several miRNAs found in other prognostic signatures of progression-free and overall survival in GBM. Since the overall coherency across the currently available signatures is poor, an additional step of complexity must exist with regard to miRNA dysregulation and its predictive qualities for clinical outcome in GBM. This aspect with respect to complexity on the usage of miRNA-based biomarkers was recently investigated in an elaborate study by Li et al. ( ). They identified a number of so-called hub miRNAs, which are center points in large, complex regulatory networks of miRNAs and mRNAs, and hence, their dysregulation between high-grade gliomas and normal brain tissue is associated with dysregulation of important cellular characteristics such as proliferation. Thus, these hub miRNAs had strong prognostic value with respect to patient outcome compared to dysregulated non-hub miRNAs (Li et al. ).
The differences between miRNAs found to be associated with long-term survival in this study compared to similar studies, and between all available studies performed on GBM tissue in general, could possibly be due to differences in methodology (i.e., array- vs. PCR-based platforms) and varying cohort sizes. Furthermore, several subtypes of GBM together with inter- and intratumoral clonal heterogeneity have been defined (Stieber et al. ; Verhaak et al. ). This study only includes data from fourteen GBM patients stringently cut back from 47 patients, but we believe that our inclusion criteria of patients being diagnosed with primary GBM resected from the first surgery before having received any treatment is very relevant, because miRNA expression is reported to change after treatment with temozolomide (Tunca et al. ). This might interfere with the quality of the currently published data.
Categorization of the differentially expressed miRNAs showed that a large number of them had validated functions in GBM, while approximately a third of them had no determined functionality. Some miRNAs have been previously reported to confer either risk or protection with respect to clinical prognosis, while others have been associated with MMMI. Microarray analysis of gene expression showed that a number of validated targets of these miRNAs were differentially expressed between the long- and short-term survival clusters. Three of these genes (E2F3, CTGF and Akt2) have been identified as important miRNA targets in GBM; E2F3 is inhibited by tumor suppressor miR-128 to decrease proliferation, CTGF is regulated by the miR-17–92 cluster resulting in increased proliferation and angiogenesis, and upregulation of miR-184 leads to decreased Akt2 expression, lowered invasiveness and increased apoptosis (Cui et al. ; Ernst et al. ; Malzkorn et al. ). In addition, most of the validated gene targets of the long-term survival-associated miRNAs are found in other types of cancer, e.g., miR-125b was found to directly target E2F3 in bladder cancer (Huang et al. ).
Since the scope of this study was to link miRNA signatures to clinicopathological findings and determine their correlation with clinical outcome in GBM, we chose to investigate the neural stem cell marker, nestin, because this protein was upregulated in several patients and could be correlated to overall survival (Dahlrot et al. ). Nestin is an intermediate filament, which is expressed both in proliferating and differentiating cells of the CNS during neural development. It is widely used as an early neural marker, but it can also be detected in progenitor cells in other parts of the body (Ishiwata et al. ). The expression of nestin sustains through life, especially in areas, where the cellular composition contains cells with proliferative and stem-like properties, which is also the reason why nestin is increasingly used as a marker for cancer stem cells (Hombach-Klonisch et al. ; Wiese et al. ). In GBM, nestin is widely used in the clinic as a determinant of tumor grade (Tomita et al. ). It is recognized as an important mediator of stemness, and a lowered expression is known to decrease tumor volume in vivo (Lu et al. ; Wu et al. ). Brain tumor initiating cells with the ability to self-renew and to generate clonal tumor spheres were also shown to express nestin (Singh et al. ). The fact that we see an inverse correlation between nestin expression and patient survival corresponds well with the evidence presented above.
To find a molecular link between the nestin expression and patient survival, we examined our miRNA signature to identify possible regulators of nestin. The examination revealed that miR-125b, which has previously been shown to target nestin in neural stem and progenitor cells, was differentially expressed between the long- and short-term-surviving patients (Cui et al. ). This miRNA is of particular interest, because its role in GBM pathogenesis is highly disputed. MiR-125b inhibited all-trans retinoic acid-induced cell death in U343 cells, decreased the sensitivity to temozolomide and positively correlated with tumor grade (Jin et al. ; Wan et al. ; Wu et al. ; Xia et al. ). Currently, it has been shown to directly target Bmf, MAZ, E2F2, PIAS3, connexin 43, and p38MAPK in association with GBM (Jin et al. ; Shi et al. ; Smits et al. ; Wu et al. , ; Xia et al. ). All of these features suggest this miRNA to be oncogenic. However, in CD133-positive GBM stem cells, the true functional role of miR-125b is still debated. MiR-125b has been endowed with oncogenic potential, because it increases migration of CD133-positive GBM cells together with a concordant increase in the expression of MMP2/9 (Shi et al. ). Its expression is also increased in highly invasive SU3 GBM stem cells compared with U251 cells (Wan et al. ). Interestingly though, miR-125b has been characterized as the most downregulated miRNA between CD133-positive and CD133-negative GBM cells and to decrease the proliferation of CD133-positive GBM cells due to its direct targeting of transcription factor E2F2 (Wu et al. ). The decrease in GBM stem cell proliferation was also associated with a decreased expression of CDK6 and CDC25A (Shi et al. ). Recently, (Wan et al. , ) reported that miR-125b was downregulated in three primary GBM stem cell lines and targeted Lin28, hereby inhibiting GBM growth both in vitro and in vivo (Wan et al. ). These results did not correspond to a previous report by the same group, where only one CD133-positive GBM stem cell line was examined (Shi et al. ; Wan et al. ). An assessment of the staining patterns of four CD133 antibodies possibly recognizing different epitopes on CD133 splice variants showed that the distribution of CD133 and concurrent cell morphology rarely corresponded between the different antibodies used (Hermansen et al. ). This might explain some of the contradicting results reported on the role of miR-125b in GBM stem cells.
The direct targeting of nestin by miR-125b is only validated in neural progenitor cells, but one study on GBM did report an inverse correlation between miR-125b and the expression of nestin and CD133, a results which is also reflected in this study (Cui et al. ; Wu et al. ). In fact, co-expression of nestin and CD133 was recently proposed as relevant cancer stem cell markers in GBM, which could indicate that GBM stem cells may be differentially regulated between long- and short-term-surviving patients (Dahlrot et al. ). In GBM-associated endothelial cells, the expression of miR-125b is downregulated, which may be due to the inhibitory effects of VEGF on this miRNA, hereby defining a role of miR-125b in tumor angiogenesis (Smits et al. ). The role of miR-125b and how it varies across studies and between CD133-positive and CD133-negative GBM cells illustrates how complex the regulation of this miRNA must be. Therefore, miR-125b may be of great importance with regards to increase the understanding of GBM pathogenesis and how it may be valuable as a therapeutic target.
Exosomes are a family of nanoparticles with a diameter in the range of 30–120 nm that are secreted by all cell types of the body, and capable of carrying cargos like RNA, proteins, lipids, etc. to be shared between cells (EL Andaloussi et al. ; Record et al. ; Vlassov et al. ). They can be isolated from several types of extracellular fluids including blood, urine, amniotic fluid, and saliva, but also from cell-conditioned medium (Vlassov et al. ; Witwer et al. ). The growing interest of paracrine signaling between cancer cells has resulted in interesting new evidence on how cancer exosomes modulate cancer cell characteristics and the tumor niche (Peinado et al. ; Rak and Guha ; Sidhu et al. ). For example, exosomes derived from hypoxic regions of GBM tumors or from GBM cells grown under hypoxic culture conditions potently induced angiogenesis (Kucharzewska et al. ). Exosomes from GBM tumors and cell lines are known to contain a great number of miRNAs that can be shared between GBM cells, and to possess a nanofilament network, which facilitates interaction with the cell membrane and subsequently increase the cellular exosome uptake (Katakowski et al. ; Sharma et al. ; Skog et al. ). In a recent paper, specific exosome-packaging motifs in mature miRNA sequences was shown to bind sumoylated hnRNPA2B1 to facilitate loading into the exosome compartment (Villarroya-Beltri et al. ). The results of the present study showed that 61 miRNAs possessed these so-called EXO-motifs, suggesting them to play a role in the paracrine signaling within tumors. This is supported by the fact that all miRNAs (miR-214, miR-146b, miR-122 and let-7a) artificially overexpressed to obtain enriched exosomes possess these EXO-motifs (Chen et al. ; Katakowski et al. ; Ohno et al. ; Pan et al. ). Four of the 61 miRNAs containing EXO-motifs (let-7b, miR-30a, miR-30b and miR-125a) have also been shown to be abundant in glioma microvesicles (Li et al. ). Interestingly, miR-125b contained three individual EXO-motifs in its mature sequence, and hence, this miRNA is possibly communicated between GBM cells to inhibit expression of specific genes including the neural stem cell marker nestin. Thus, it may be valuable to investigate the ongoing intercellular communication in GBM tumors to understand how miRNA signatures are generated and regulated, and which underlying functions are responsible for the phenotype and patient outcome. Such work could possibly identify GBM exosomes and their contents as novel therapeutic targets or biomarkers of disease (Kucharzewska et al. ; Manterola et al. ; Noerholm et al. ).
Conclusion
The clustering of miRNAs to define signatures and their prognostic value is not a stand-alone entity with respect to predicting survival. It is very clear that evidence needs to be critically analyzed preferentially combining clinicopathological findings with molecular profiling, which we have attempted to achieve in a smaller cohort of patients meeting stringent inclusion criteria. The inverse relationship between nestin and miR-125b expression and their correlation to patient survival in GBM illustrate this eloquently. The intriguing finding that many of the differentially expressed miRNAs contained exosome-packaging motifs in their mature sequences suggest that we must expand our view to encompass the complex intercellular communication in order to identify molecular prognostic biomarkers and to increase our knowledge in the field of GBM pathogenesis.
