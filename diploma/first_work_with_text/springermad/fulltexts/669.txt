Introduction
Approximately 5 to 7% of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), who are routinely considered for dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a P2Y 12 receptor antagonist, also have atrial fibrillation (AF) as indication for chronic oral anticoagulation (OAC) [ , ]. AF has been associated with increased bleeding and ischemic risk in those patients and their antithrombotic treatment poses challenges that must be considered in every day clinical practice [ , , ]. Triple antithrombotic therapy consisting of a vitamin K antagonist (VKA), aspirin, and a P2Y 12 receptor antagonist has been for a long time considered as a standard of care, despite a high concomitant risk for bleeding [ ]. The latter was emphasized by two recently published meta-analyses, which showed a 54–65% increase in major bleeding with triple (DAPT and anticoagulant) vs dual (single antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulant) therapy, without any apparent difference in mortality and ischemic events [ , ].
Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) do not require routine anticoagulation monitoring and have demonstrated at least equivalent clinical efficacy compared with warfarin in large-scale randomized controlled studies [ , , , ]. Moreover, current evidence suggests that dual combination of a NOAC and a P2Y 12 receptor antagonist could attenuate bleeding potential compared to triple therapy, without proven risk of compromised efficacy [ , ]. In the PIONEER AF-PCI (an Open-label, Randomized, Controlled, Multicenter Study Exploring Two Treatment Strategies of Rivaroxaban and a Dose- Adjusted Oral Vitamin K Antagonist Treatment Strategy in Subjects With Atrial Fibrillation Who Undergo Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) study, low-dose rivaroxaban (15 mg/day) plus a P2Y 12 receptor antagonist for 12 months (the choice of which was left at physician’s discretion) was associated with a lower rate of bleeding compared with standard triple therapy, whereas efficacy did not differ significantly between groups [ ]. In the Randomized Evaluation of Dual Antithrombotic Therapy with Dabigatran versus Triple Therapy with Warfarin in Patients with Non-valvular Atrial Fibrillation Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (RE-DUAL PCI) trial, major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding was reduced with dual therapy (110 or 150 mg dabigatran twice daily plus a P2Y 12 receptor antagonist), as compared with standard triple therapy, whereas dual therapy was found non-inferior to triple therapy with respect to the risk of thromboembolic events [ ].
Although many studies have shown that a considerable number of patients, particularly in high-risk settings, are more likely to have suboptimal response to clopidogrel, [ , ] physicians remained reluctant in using a novel P2Y 12 receptor antagonist as part of the dual therapy in PIONEER AF-PCI and RE-DUAL PCI studies. However, the combination of NOACs with newer potent P2Y 12 receptors antagonists needs further studying as it could theoretically provide anti-ischemic benefit with a low bleeding rate [ , ]. Moreover, pharmacodynamic evaluation of ticagrelor vs clopidogrel as part of dual therapy, in the setting of NOAC therapy post-PCI, would be of particular interest, as it would reveal a portion of clopidogrel-treated patients who remain without adequate platelet inhibition, due to suboptimal response.
Real-life experience in view of PIONEER AF-PCI and RE-DUAL PCI studies and following recent practice guidelines release is lacking [ , , , ]. GRAPE-AF registry aims to describe current patterns of antithrombotic treatment in the context of every day clinical practice, and 1-year clinical outcome in post-PCI patients with non-valvular AF.
Methods
This is a prospective, observational, nationwide, cohort study involving 25 tertiary and non-tertiary centers with PCI facilities in Greece.
Study Population
All consecutive patients undergoing PCI over a 1-year period will be screened for participation. Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in Table 1 . Diagnosis of non-valvular AF (not primarily associated with a valve stenosis) will be confirmed by source documents (any rhythm strip documenting paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent non-valvular AF within 1 year before screening or > 1 year before screening in case of chronic (>3 months) OAC therapy (with VKA or NOAC). Discharge antithrombotic medication will be at the discretion of the treating physician. Table 1 Inclusion and exclusion criteria Inclusion criteria • PCI with stent implantation • Documented medical history of non-valvular AF (paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent) with indication for anticoagulation (men with a CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score ≥ 1 and women with a score ≥ 2) • Written informed consent Exclusion criteria • Any clinically significant bleeding defined as Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) ≥ 2 [ ] at the time of screening or within the previous 3 months • History of intracranial bleeding • Dialysis or creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min (by the Cockroft-Gault formula) at screening • History of liver disease (e.g., acute or chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis) or liver function test abnormalities at screening (confirmed with repeat testing): alanine transaminase (ALT) > 5 times the upper limit of normal or ALT > 3 times the upper limit of normal plus total bilirubin > 2 times the upper limit of normal • PT or INR test suggesting a bleeding disorder, according to treating physician’s best clinical judgment • Estimated life expectancy of less than 12 months • High probability of non-availability for follow-up visits • Planned coronary artery bypass grafting or staged PCI procedure • Hypersensitivity or other contraindications to the use of a P2Y12 receptor antagonist or NOAC AF atrial fibrillation, ALT alanine aminotransferase, INR international normalized ratio, NOAC non-vitamin K antagonist, PCI percutaneous coronary intervention, PT prothrombin time
Data Collection and Management
Follow-up visits will be performed at 1, 6, and 12 months post-PCI by telephone contact or personal interview. Table 2 summarizes key data, which will be collected at baseline (pre-discharge) and at each follow-up visit. All outcome and adverse events will be adjudicated by an independent endpoint committee. All data will be recorded in paper CRF forms and subsequently transferred to a central electronic database and multiple quality controls will be performed both electronically and on-site to ensure data integrity. Table 2 Data to be collected at baseline and at each follow-up visit Baseline visit Follow-up visits Demographics Antithrombotic and concomitant treatment (including reason for changes) Past medical history Bleeding events (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium-BARC classification) Socio-economic status Ischemic events (death, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, urgent revascularization, stroke) Type and duration of AF Adverse events Indication for PCI, procedural details Platelet function testing at 1 month, only in patients eligible for platelet reactivity sub-study In-hospital complications Laboratory evaluation pre-discharge Prior antithrombotic treatment and antithrombotic and concomitant treatment at discharge AF atrial fibrillation, BARC Bleeding Academic Research Consortium, PCI percutaneous coronary intervention
Endpoints
The primary endpoint of the study is the occurrence of clinically significant bleeding (BARC ≥ 2) by the end of 12 months, between the 2 groups (VKA vs NOACs). Secondary endpoints are as follows: (a) the occurrence of clinically significant bleeding (BARC ≥ 2) by the end of 12 months, between dual and triple antithrombotic therapy, (b) major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs, cardiovascular death, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, systemic embolism, and unplanned coronary revascularization) by the end of 12 months, between the 2 groups (VKA vs NOACs), and (c) the net clinical endpoint MACEs+BARC ≥ 2 bleedings by the end of 12 months, between the 2 groups (VKA vs NOACs).
Other endpoints include the following: (a) Baseline HAS-BLED score [ ], Anticoagulation and Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation (ATRIA) score [ ], and Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of atrial fibrillation (ORBIT) score [ ] in predicting bleeding events at 12 months and evaluation of their impact on antithrombotic medication at discharge; (b) CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score [ ] impact on prediction of ischemic stroke at 12 months and evaluation of its impact on antithrombotic medication at discharge; (c) Charlson’s Comorbidity Index (CCI) [ ] in predicting all-cause mortality, bleeding events, and ischemic stroke at 12 months and evaluation of its impact on antithrombotic medication at discharge; and (d) impact of socio-economic factors (insurance, income, education, living status) on antithrombotic medication at discharge and on treatment adherence.
Statistical Analysis
Demographic and baseline characteristics (including HAS-BLED, ATRIA, ORBIT, CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score, and CCI) will be described by antithrombotic treatment at discharge. All study’s endpoints will be analyzed by the per os anticoagulant treatment at discharge (VKA versus NOACs) using Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for months on triple therapy, use of novel P2Y 12 receptor antagonist and other baseline characteristics (e.g., age, prior bleeding, cardiovascular risk factors, renal function), by an intention-to-treat principle.
Sample Size
Assuming a power of 80% at a 0.05 significance level, an event rate regarding bleeding BARC ≥ 2 of 24% and an expected R-squared of 0.15 when type of anticoagulant is regressed on the other independent variables, at least 517 patients would be required to detect a regression coefficient of − 0.62 or more, which corresponds to a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.54 or less with a standard deviation of 0.44. Based on the above hypotheses and assuming that 5% of overall PCI patients would be eligible for per os anticoagulant therapy after PCI due to AF, screening of at least 10,500 patients would be required.
Platelet Reactivity Sub-study
Patients receiving either clopidogrel or ticagrelor as part of their (dual or triple) combination therapy will be eligible for participation in the pharmacodynamic sub-study, and after informed consent will undergo platelet function testing with the VerifyNow assay at 1 month post-PCI. The substudy endpoints include platelet reactivity (PR, in platelet reactivity units-PRU) between groups and high platelet reactivity (HPR, defined as PR > 208 PRU) rate between groups. Taking into account that PR assessment will not be available in all participating centers, we plan to assess PR in 120 patients. Out of them, 36 and 84 are expected to receive ticagrelor and clopidogrel, respectively. Assuming a PR of 35 ± 30 PRU and 100 ± 70 PRU for ticagrelor and clopidogrel, [ ] group sample sizes of 36 and 84 will achieve > 95% power to detect a difference of at least 65.0 PRU between groups, with estimated standard deviations of 35.0 and 70.0, respectively, and with a significance level (alpha) of 0.05, assuming that the actual distribution is not normal. Moreover, assuming an HPR rate of 3 and 25% in ticagrelor and clopidogrel group, respectively, sample sizes of 36 and 84 in ticagrelor and clopidogrel group are predicted to achieve 88% power to detect an absolute difference between the group proportions of 22% with a two-sided Fisher’s exact test, at a 0.05 significance level.
Discussion
GRAPE-AF registry aims to describe contemporary treatment patterns with respect to antithrombotic medication and 1-year clinical outcome, in post-PCI patients requiring long-term oral anticoagulation due to non-valvular AF, focusing on the use of potent P2Y 12 receptor antagonists as part of dual therapy.
The What is the Optimal antiplatElet and anticoagulation therapy in patients with oral anticoagulation and coronary StenTing (WOEST) study was the first randomized trial to question the value of triple therapy in patients on oral anticoagulation and coronary stenting [ ]. Furthermore, the two recently announced large-scale randomized studies, RE-DUAL-PCI and PIONEER AF-PCI, [ , ] introduced dual combination of a NOAC and a P2Y 12 receptor antagonist and as an efficient way to reduce bleeding without significantly compromising efficacy compared with standard triple therapy. AUGUSTUS (A Study of Apixaban to Vitamin K Antagonist for the Prevention of Stroke or Systemic Embolism and Bleeding in Patients With Non-valvular Atrial Fibrillation and Acute Coronary Syndrome/Percutaneous Coronary Intervention; NCT02415400) and ENTRUST-AF-PCI (Edoxaban Treatment Versus Vitamin K Antagonist in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention; NCT02866175) are expected to provide further knowledge regarding the role of NOACs combined with a P2Y 12 receptor antagonist in patients with AF undergoing PCI. Moreover, RT-AF and MANJUSRI studies will examine the safety of dual therapy with ticagrelor and rivaroxaban or warfarin, respectively, versus triple therapy in AF patients undergoing PCI [ , ].
Current guidelines on dual antithrombotic therapy in patients with AF undergoing PCI are summarized in Table 3 . In the recently released 2017 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) focused update on DAPT in CAD, clinical implications of PIONEER AF study influenced recommendations, with dual therapy with clopidogrel 75 mg/day and OAC being proposed as an alternative to 1-month triple antithrombotic therapy in patients in whom the bleeding risk outweighs the ischemic risk (class IIa, level of evidence A) [ ]. While data on “real-life” experience with dual therapy outside the context of randomized controlled trials is lacking, GRAPE-AF focuses on safety and efficacy of P2Y 12 receptor antagonist in combination with a NOAC, as part of dual therapy, as being implemented in routine clinical practice.

Of importance, use of novel antiplatelet agents (prasugrel or ticagrelor) in PIONEER AF-PCI and RE-DUAL PCI studies was limited, and further information is needed regarding their safety and efficacy as part of dual therapy. In the low-dose rivaroxaban (15 mg od) arm of PIONEER AF-PCI study and with the choice of P2Y 12 receptor antagonist been left at physician’s discretion, clopidogrel 75 mg once daily, ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily, or prasugrel 10 mg once daily were used in 93.1, 5.2, and 1.7% of patients, respectively; in total, only 37 patients received ticagrelor on top of rivaroxaban low dose and clinically significant bleeding occurred in 5/36 (16%) vs 8/21 (43.9%) in rivaroxaban+ticagrelorvsVKA+ticagrelor+ASA, HR 0.33 (0.11–1.01), p = 0.039 [ ]. In RE-DUAL PCI as well, major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding was less in the dual therapy group, irrespectively of the use of ticagrelor ( p for interaction = NS): 28/132 (21.2%) vs 34/91 (37.4%) in the dabigatran 110 dual therapy vs warfarin triple therapy, and 24/104 (23.1%) vs 25/73 (34.2%) in the dabigatran 150 dual therapy vs warfarin triple therapy groups, respectively [ ]. Data regarding clinical safety and efficacy of novel antiplatelet agents combined with (N)OAC outside the context of randomized controlled trials comes only from a small retrospective case-control study: patients under ticagrelor plus warfarin did not differ significantly in bleeding and ischemic events compared with historical controls treated with standard triple therapy: 7.5 vs 7.0%, p = NS and 4.7 vs 3.2%, p = NS, respectively [ ].
There are limited data from observational studies regarding “real-life” experience with novel antiplatelet agents as part of triple therapy. Sarafoff et al. compared prasugrel vs clopidogrel (in combination with aspirin and warfarin) in 377 patients undergoing PCI with an indication for oral anticoagulation and found more bleeding with prasugrel (HR = 3.2, 1.1–9.1 95%CI, p = 0.03) and no significant difference in ischemic events between groups (HR = 1.1, 0.2–5.1, p = 0.9) [ ]. In addition, in a report from Treatment with Adenosine Diphosphate Receptor Inhibitors: Longitudinal Assessment of Treatment Patterns and Events After Acute Coronary Syndrome (TRANSLATE-ACS) registry, no difference emerged between prasugrel and clopidogrel (in combination with aspirin and warfarin) with respect to bleeding requiring hospitalization and ischemic events (HR = 0.62, 0.20–1.93, p = 0.4 and HR = 1.53, 0.65–3.61, p = 0.3, respectively) [ ].
However, knowledge regarding safety and efficacy of novel antiplatelet agents combined with oral anticoagulant remains limited, and more studies are needed. The GRAPE-AF registry aims to collect 1-year bleeding and ischemic events in AF patients undergoing PCI, focusing on use of novel antiplatelet agents and NOACs as part of dual therapy. Moreover, our study aims to reveal variations in treatment patterns and to provide insights into factors that affect adherence to antithrombotic medication that might be difficult to be disclosed in the context of a randomized controlled trial.
Limitations
This is an observational cohort study, and therefore, despite multivariate statistical analysis remaining, confounding or over-adjustment cannot be excluded. Study’s results may not be trivially generalized to a wider context due to its single-country nature, since treatment decisions may differ from one country to another due to differences in healthcare systems and policies. A larger sample size would provide more precise estimates and would reveal potential differences between groups.
Conclusions
The GRAPE-AF registry will describe current antithrombotic treatment patterns for patients with non-valvular AF, who require oral anticoagulation and are subjected to PCI with stenting. Moreover, study aims to provide information on safety and efficacy of NOACs combined with P2Y 12 receptor antagonists.
