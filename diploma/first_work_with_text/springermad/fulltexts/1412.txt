Introduction
Species of Cosmocercoides commonly parasitize the amphibians and reptiles, but also occasionally occur in the land snails and slugs (McGraw ; Hasegawa ; Vanderburgh and Anderson ; Ramallo et al. ; Avila et al. ; Rizvi ; Rizvi and Bursey ; Tran et al. ; Bursey et al. ). Up to date, this genus includes over 20 nominal species worldwide, of which only five species have been reported from China, including C. microhylae (Wang, Zhao & Chen, 1978) collected from the ornate narrow-mouthed frog Microhyla ornata (Duméril & Bibron), C. oligodentis Wang, 1981 from the Chinese kukri snake Oligodon chinensis (Reptilia: Squamata), C. ranae Wang, 1981 from the Chinese spiny frog Quasipaa spinosa (David) (Amphibia: Anura), C. tibetanum (Baylis, 1927) from the Boulenger’s cat-eyed toad Scutiger boulengeri (Bedriaga) (Amphibia: Anura) and C. pulcher Wilkie, 1930 from the Asiatic toad Bufo gargarizans Cantor (Amphibia: Anura) (Baylis ; Hsü ; K’ung and Wu ; Wang et al. , ).
The current identification of Cosmocercoides species remains mainly based on the traditional methods. However, it is not easy to identify and distinguish some Cosmocercoides species only using morphological characters, because of the extraordinary morphological similarity between them. In addition, it is really an annoying problem for classical taxonomists to delimit the phenotypic variation belonging to intra- or interspecific variation, which has been reported in some Cosmocercoides species, i.e., C. pulcher and C. dukae (Holl, 1928) (McGraw ; Tran et al. ). Consequently, a recent study has tried to apply DNA data for identification of Cosmocercoides species (Tran et al. ). However, there are very few species of Cosmocercoides with their DNA data available in the public databases. We have never even known that which DNA marker is more suitable for molecular identification of Cosmocercoides species.
During our recent parasitological survey of the Asiatic toad Bufo gargarizans Cantor (Amphibia: Anura), large numbers of Cosmocercoides nematodes were collected from the large intestine of B. gargarizans . In order to precisely assess the taxonomic status of these nematodes, specimens were studied using light and scanning electron microscopy, and also characterized utilizing molecular approaches by sequencing and analyzing the ribosomal [small ribosomal DNA (18S) and internal transcribed spacer (ITS)] and mitochondrial [cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 ( cox 1)] target regions, respectively.
Materials and methods
Light and scanning electron microscopy
The Asiatic toad Bufo gargarizans Cantor (Amphibia: Anura) was collected from the Qingtian River scenic area, Jiaozuo, Henan Province, China, which was dissected for parasites. Large numbers of nematodes were isolated from the large intestine of this host. Worms were washed in physiological saline and then fixed and stored in 80% ethanol until studied. For light microscopical studies, nematodes were cleared in lactophenol. Drawings were made with the aid of a Nikon microscope drawing attachment. For scanning electron microscopy (SEM), specimens were fixed in 4% formaldehyde solution, post-fixed in 1% OsO4, dehydrated via an ethanol series and acetone, and then critical point dried. The specimens were coated with gold and examined using a Hitachi S-4800 scanning electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. Measurements (the range, followed by the mean in parentheses) are given in micrometers unless otherwise stated. Type specimens were deposited in College of Life Sciences, Hebei Normal University, Hebei Province, China.
Molecular procedures
A total of six specimens (3 males, 3 females) of our present specimens and five specimens (3 males, 2 femlaes) of C. pulcher collected from Bufo japonicus formosus in Tokyo, Japan were randomly selected for molecular analysis. Genomic DNA from each individual was extracted using a Column Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (Shanghai Sangon, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA was eluted in elution buffer and kept at − 20 °C until use. The partial 18S region was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the forward primer (5′-CGCGAATRGCTCATTACAACAGC-3′) and the reverse primer (5′-GGGCGGTATCTGATCGCC-3′) (Floyd et al. ). The ITS-1 region was amplified by PCR using the forward primer SS1 (5′-GTTTCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCG-3′) and the reverse primer SS2R (5′-AGTGCTCAATGTGTCTGCAA-3′). The ITS-2 region was amplified by PCR using the forward primer NC13 (5′-ATCGATGAAGAACGCAGC-3′) and the reverse primer NC2 (reverse: 5′-TTAGTTTCTTTTCCTCCGCT-3′) (Zhu et al. ). The partial cox 1 region was amplified by PCR using the forward primer (5′- TTTTTTGGTCATCCTGAGGTTTAT-3′) and the reverse primer (5′- ACATAATGAAAATGACTAACAAC-3′) (Lazarova et al. ).
The cycling conditions were as described previously (Li et al. ). PCR products were checked on GoldView-stained 1.5% agarose gels and purified with Column PCR Product Purification Kit (Shanghai Sangon, China). Sequencing was carried out using a DyeDeoxyTerminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (v.2, Applied Biosystems, California, USA) and an automated sequencer (ABI-PRISM 377). Sequencing for each sample was carried out for both strands. Sequences were aligned using ClustalW2 and adjusted manually. The DNA sequences obtained herein were compared (using the algorithm BLASTn) with those available in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database (http: // www.ncbi.nlm . nih.gov ). The18S, ITS and cox 1 sequences of our present material and C. pulcher collected from Japan are both deposited in the GenBank database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm . nih.gov ).

Discussion
With more than 13 pairs of caudal rosettes, Cosmocercoides qingtianensis sp. n. is similar to the following species: C. tonkinensis Tran et al., 2015, C. kiliwai Martinez-Salazar et al., 2013, C. tridens Wilkie, 1930, C. variabilis (Harwood, 1930), C. bufonis Karve, 1944, C. kumaoni Arya, 1991, C. multipapillata Khera, 1958, C. pulcher Wilkie, 1930, C. nainitalensis Arya, 1979, C. rickae Ogden, 1966, C. tibetanum (Baylis, 1927) and C. malayensis Bursey et al., 2015 (Wilkie ; Tran et al. ; Martinez-Salazar et al. ; Karve ; Khera ; Arya , ; Ogden ; Baylis Bursey et al. ) . The new species differs from C. malayensis, C. variabilis and C. bufonis by having larger body size in male (6.30–8.00 mm long in former vs 2.20–4.90 mm long in the latter three species), less number of postcloacal resette papillae (three pairs in the latter three species vs only one pair in the new species) and longer tail in male (0.23–0.33 mm long in the new species vs 0.13–0.24 mm long in the latter three species). In addition, C. malayensis has no somatic papillae in both sexes according to Bursey et al. ( ) (the presence of somatic papillae in the new species). Cosmocercoides qingtianensis sp. n. is also different from C. tibetanum and C. kiliwai by having distinctly shorter spicules (0.27–0.34 mm, representing 3.80–5.40% of body length in C. qingtianensis vs 0.36–0.58 mm, representing 8.94–11.8% of body length in the latter two species) and longer tail in male (0.23–0.33 mm in the new species vs not more than 0.20 mm in the latter two species). The new species can be easily distinguished from C. nainitalensis , C. kumaoni , and C. multipapillata by the different number and arrangement of postcloacal rosettes (1 pair, distributed near cloacal opening vs 4–6 pairs and the last pair distributed near the tail tip in the latter three species). C. tonkinensis Tran et al., 2015 differs from the new species by having the different morphology of gubernaculum and rosetted papillae (each rosette surrounded by two rings of tubercules in C. tonkinensis vs each rosette surrounded by only one ring of tubercules in the latter) and slightly shorter tail in male (0.21–0.23 mm in the former, 0.26–0.30 mm in the new species). Tran et al. ( ) did not state the presence of medioventral precloacal papilla in their material, but there is a large medioventral precloacal papilla in our specimens. In addition, C. tonkinensis was collected from the lizard Acanthosaura lepidogaster (Cuvier), by contrast, C. qingtianensis sp. n. collected from the Asiatic toad B. gargarizans . Cosmocercoides qingtianensis sp. n. also differs from C. rickae and C. tridens by having much larger body size in male (6.30–8.00 vs 3.07–5.00 mm in the latter two species), slightly longer gubernaculum (0.13–0.18 vs 0.08–0.15 mm) and longer tail in male (0.23–0.33 vs 0.13–0.21 mm).
Cosmocercoides pulcher has been reported from many species of frogs and toads in Japan (Wilkie ; Goldberg and Bursey , ; Hasegawa , ; Hasegawa and Asakava ; Tran et al. ). However, it is not easy to distinguish C. qingtianensis sp. n. from C. pulcher by the morphological characters, because of the presence of overlapping of some important morphometric data between the two species. McGraw ( ) re-examined the type specimens of C. pulcher and considered the gubernaculum of C. pulcher without distinctly apical and lateral projections (gubernaculum with distinctly apical and lateral projections in the new species). However, the morphology of gubernaculum is not stable in some Cosmocercoides species. For example, Anderson ( ) and McGraw ( ) found the presence of morphological variation in the gubernaculum shape of C. dukae . We also examined the specimens of C. pulcher (4 males and 4 females) collected from Bufo japonicus formosus in Tokyo, Japan (the same host and locality as the type material of C. pulcher ) and observed that there is also morphological variation in the gubernaculum shape of C. pulcher (gubernaculum with distinctly apical and lateral projections in three males, not very distinct in the other one). Consequently, it is not reasonable to use this taxonomic criterion for distinguishing the two species. However, we found that there is one pair of remarkable postcloacal rosettes distributed near the tail tip in all the male specimens of C. pulcher collected from B. japonicus formosus in Tokyo, Japan, which was reported in the original description of C. pulcher by Wilkie ( ). Later, McGraw ( ) also drew this character in his figure when he re-examined the type specimens of C. pulcher . But we could not observe the remarkable postcloacal rosettes distributed near the tail tip in C. qingtianensis sp. n. Consequently, we considered that this character (presence or absence of one pair of remarkable postcloacal rosettes distributed near the tail tip) is useful for distinguishing the new species from C. pulcher . Moreover, as mentioned later, the molecular characterization of the two species, especially the cox 1 region, also supported our species differentiation. Hsü ( ) reported C. pulcher from the Japanese toad B. japonicus Temminck & Schlegel in Sichuan Province, China. However, B. japonicus is not actually distributed in China. K’ung and Wu ( ) recorded C. pulcher from the Asiatic toad B. gargarizans also in Sichuan Province. They considered that the host species of C. pulcher in Hsü ( ) was possibly misidentified and it should be B. gargarizans. Although the morphology and morphometric data of Hsü’s ( ) and K’ung and Wu’s ( ) specimens are very similar to C. pulcher , we could not decide the actually taxonomic status of their specimens. Because both of Hsü’s ( ) and K’ung and Wu’s ( ) descriptions lack of some detailed morphological characters, which could help us to distinguish C. qingtianensis sp. n. from C. pulcher . In addition, we also could not confirm that if Hsü’s ( ) and K’ung and Wu’s ( ) specimens are identical to C. qingtianensis sp. n. or C. pulcher genetically. This problem may be solved when we have newly collected material from the same host in the same locality as that of Hsü ( ) and K’ung and Wu ( ).
The molecular data from representatives of Cosmocercoides is very limited and few DNA sequences deposited in public databases are available. Our molecular analysis did not support the 18S region of rDNA to be a suitable DNA marker for rapid differentiation of these closely related species of Cosmocercoides , because there are some overlaps in the range of intra- and interspecific 18S sequence divergence between them (for example, the new species displayed 0–0.18% nucleotide differences in the 18S region between different individuals vs only 0.06–0.36% nucleotide differences detected in the 18S region between the new species and the two closely related species C. tonkinensis and C. pulcher ). Although the interspecific level of genetic variation in the ITS region between C. qingtianensis sp. n. and C. tonkinensis (0.34–0.46% nucleotide differences) and C. pulcher (0.80–0.91% nucleotide differences) is very low, it is slightly higher than that of the intraspecific genetic variation (0–0.11% nucleotide differences). Consequently, we considered that the ITS region seems to be a useful genetic marker for accurate diagnosis of Cosmocercoides species. In contrast, it seems more powerful and practical to use the cox 1 region as a genetic marker for the rapid, accurate identification and differentiation of species of Cosmocercoides because of the existence of a clear gap in the range of intra- and interspecific nucleotide variation (no intraspecific nucleotide divergence detected in the new species and only 0.78–4.69% intraspecific nucleotide divergence detected in C. pulcher vs 12.50–14.58% interspecific nucleotide divergence between C. qingtianensis sp. n. and the closely related species C. pulcher , the level of interspecific variation distinctly higher than that of intraspecific variation).
