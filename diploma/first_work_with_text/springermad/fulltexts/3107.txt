Introduction
Despite several advances in the treatment of ovarian cancers, there has been little change in its mortality rate [ ]. This is probably because of the vague symptoms that women present leading to the initial presentation in advanced stages. To date, no screening approach is available or validated to detect ovarian cancer at an early stage. All this makes early detection of ovarian cancer more challenging.
The primary goal of the diagnostic evaluation of an ovarian mass is to determine whether it is benign or malignant. If malignant, optimal cytoreduction is the aim. This is best achieved when women are operated by gyne-oncologists who have special expertise in surgical debulking which ultimately decides their five-year survival rate. Hence, referral of patients to specialized cancer units where the multidisciplinary team is available becomes critical.
To differentiate a benign ovarian mass from a malignant one, a wide variety of biochemical, morphological, vascular tumor markers and scoring systems have been tried. Of these, the risk of malignancy index (RMI), Risk of Ovarian Malignancy Algorithm (ROMA) and OVA1 are popular.
The risk of malignancy index (RMI) is commonly used to detect the women with a high probability of ovarian cancer. RMI is calculated using serum CA-125, ultrasound scoring and menopausal status. Ultrasound scoring is subjective, and quality assurance may be difficult to maintain. The Risk of Ovarian Malignancy Algorithm (ROMA), based on serum CA-125 level, serum HE-4 level and menopausal status, has been demonstrated to distinguish ovarian cancers from benign ovarian masses. The advantage of ROMA over RMI is that it includes serum HE-4 which has better specificity than serum CA-125 and it does not involve imaging. ROMA can be used in the triage of women even in low-resource centers as it is a simple scoring based only on biomarkers and menopausal status. The results of ROMA are objective, reproducible, and there is no subjective bias as seen in RMI.
Unlike CA-125, studies have shown that HE-4 is not elevated in benign conditions such as endometriosis. This becomes crucial when dealing with premenopausal women [ ]. Our study looked at ROMA to ascertain whether this was a better scoring system to differentiate benign from malignant ovarian masses preoperatively. This research attempts to know the expression of serum HE-4 on Indian women and whether ROMA can be used as a tool to screen high-risk women for ovarian cancer.
Materials and Methods
Study Design and Sample Collection
The study was carried out in the outpatient department of GKNM Hospital on women presenting with an adnexal mass clinically and radiologically. They were invited to participate in the study after a written informed consent. Women were considered as menopausal if they had their last period at least one year before or had been approved to be menopausal by laboratory test. Women with a confirmed diagnosis of any cancer were excluded from our study.
Blood samples were drawn for serum CA-125 and HE-4 prior to surgery. Since our hospital is a tertiary cancer center, most of the women presented with an ultrasound done elsewhere. As a part of preoperative work-up, CT abdomen and pelvis or MRI abdomen and pelvis was performed in these patients. These scans were interpreted by expert radiologists trained in oncology. Tumor board committee of our hospital decided on the treatment. If a malignant mass was suspected based on the work-up, she would be operated by gyne-oncologist or else by general gynecologist of our hospital. The ovarian masses were then removed surgically, and a complete histopathological evaluation was performed by onco-pathologists.
Calculation of RMI and ROMA
The RMI was calculated according to the criteria described by Jacobs et al. [ ] RMI included serum CA-125 (CA-125); menopausal status ( M ); imaging score ( U ). The risk was calculated as RMI = U × M × CA-125.
The ROMA was calculated as described by Moore et al. [ ]. The predictive index values were calculated as follows:
Premenopausal: Predictive index (PI) = 212.0 + 2.38*LN (HE-4) + 0.0626*LN (CA-125); and
Postmenopausal: Predictive index (PI) = 28.09 +1.04*LN (HE-4) + 0.732*LN (CA-125).
In addition, the predicted probability (PP) was calculated as: PP = exp (PI)/[1 + exp(PI)].
Blood samples drawn for serum HE-4 were calculated using Abbott Architect chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) as per established standards. The normal ranges for serum HE-4 for premenopausal women were ≤ 70 pmol/L and postmenopausal women ≤ 140 pmol/L ROMA. For premenopausal women, indices of at least 7.4% and for postmenopausal women indices of at least 25.3% indicate a high risk of the presence of epithelial ovarian cancer.
Of the 37 women who had consented for our study, two were excluded as they did not undergo surgery in the stipulated period. So we conducted our study on 35 women.
Results
Of the 35 women in study population, 22 (62.8%) were premenopausal and 13(37.1%) were postmenopausal (Table 1 ). Among the 13 postmenopausal women, histopathology was positive (including borderline and malignant) for ovarian malignancy in 7/13 (53.84%) and in premenopausal women 8/22 (36.36%) (including borderline and malignant) (Table 2 ). Table 1 Histopathology Menopausal status H/P Total Positive (borderline ovarian tumors + malignant) Negative (benign) Premenopausal 8 14 22 Postmenopausal 8 5 13 Total 16 19 35 Table 2 Histological type and distribution of benign and malignant diseases in premenopausal women and postmenopausal women Premenopausal women Benign disease Endometriosis 6 Benign ovarian cyst 1 Benign para ovarian cyst 1 Mature cystic teratoma of ovary 1 Sero-mucinous cystadeno-fibroma of ovary 1 Hemorrhagic ovarian cyst 1 Follicular cyst 1 Mature cystic teratoma of right ovary and endometriosis of left ovary 1 Degenerated sub serous fibroid 1 Borderline disease 4 Malignant lesions High-grade clear cell carcinoma 1 Serous adenocarcinoma 1 Papillary mucinous cystadenocarcinoma 1 Poorly differentiated malignant neoplasm 1 Postmenopausal women Benign disease Benign ovarian cyst 1 Completely necrotic hemorrhagic mass cannot be classified clinically 1 Bilateral cellular fibroma 1 Benign mucinous cystadeno-fibroma with torsion-induced changes 1 Benign serous ovarian cystadeno-fibroma with focal low-grade atypia 1 Borderline tumor 1 Malignant disease Endometriotic adenocarcinoma 1 Clear cell carcinoma 1 Serous cystadenocarcinoma 4 Well-differentiated low-grade mucinous cystadenocarcinoma 1
The most represented histological type among postmenopausal women was serous carcinoma ranging from borderline, low-grade to high-grade ( n = 5), endometrioid adenocarcinoma ( n = 1), clear cell carcinoma ( n = 1). Borderline tumors were more common in premenopausal women ( n = 4) than in postmenopausal women ( n = 1). Most common benign condition in premenopausal women was endometriotic cyst ( n = 6) and in postmenopausal women was ovarian fibroma (Table 2 ).
Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV), positive likelihood ratio (PLR) and negative likelihood ratio (NLR) of CA-125 and HE-4 were calculated. Sensitivity and specificity of CA-125 at the cutoff value of 35 to diagnose the cancer are 45% (16–76%) and 54% (32–74%), respectively, when compared to the standard histopathology results. Sensitivity and specificity of HE-4 at the specified cutoff value for pre- and postmenopausal women to diagnose the cancer are 63% (30–89%) and 88% (67–97%), respectively, when compared to histopathology as gold standard (Table 3 ).

Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, PLR and NLR of RMI and ROMA were calculated. Sensitivity and specificity of RMI at the cutoff value of 200 to diagnose the cancer were 54% (23–83%) and 66% (44–84%), respectively, compared to the standard histopathology results. ROMA had the highest number of true negative values ( n = 17). Sensitivity of ROMA was 91% (Table 4 ).

Discussion
This study was carried out with the aim of evaluating the usefulness of the ROMA index in distinguishing the nature of pelvic masses: The results support previous findings suggesting that the ROMA index performs better than RMI, CA-125 or HE-4 alone in the differentiation of pelvic masses in pre- and postmenopausal women.
Ovarian malignancies are more common in postmenopausal women. We had 22 women in the premenopausal group and 13 in postmenopausal group. Of the 13 postmenopausal women presenting with an adnexal mass, 7 women were diagnosed with malignancy on histopathology accounting to 53.8% [ ] and the majority were epithelial ovarian cancers similar to other published research [ ].
A rise in both tumor markers (CA-125 and HE-4) was more evident in certain histologies of ovarian cancer than in others. Galgano et al. [ ] reported that HE-4 proteins or genes were expressed strongly in serous, papillary, clear cell and endometrioid carcinoma of the ovaries. The predominant histological type observed was serous followed by clear cell, endometrioid and mucinous histologies which are consistent with prevalence in other study population even though our study group was small [ ].
Both tumor markers HE-4 and CA-125 were related to tumor stage and histological types. Preoperative values of HE-4 have been investigated as a prognostic indicator [ , ]. High preoperative values of HE-4 were shown to be associated with poor progression-free survival. Apart from sensitivity and specificity, we tried to analyze our results in terms of predictive values and likelihood ratios. On comparing the positive likelihood ratio (PLR) of various parameters in our study, serum HE-4 performed better than all others followed by ROMA, which is supported by results from several meta-analyses [ , , ]. The PLR of HE-4 in our study was 5.1, for ROMA-3.11, RMI-1.6 and CA-125-1.0 in descending order. It is interesting to note that PLR of HE-4 was greater than 10 in various meta-analyses which means that raised levels of HE-4 are definitely associated with malignancy. Even though PLR of HE-4 in our study was 5.1, we hope that with an increase in sample size even our PLR may be high. We found that CA-125 had the least positive and negative predictive values, followed by RMI, HE-4 and ROMA. In a meta-analysis by Pitta et al. and Farzaneh F et al. [ , ], CA-125 had a better NPV and ROMA had the highest PPV. When the PPVs were calculated in pre- and postmenopausal women separately in the same meta-analysis, NPV of ROMA was higher in premenopausal group than HE-4 and CA-125 [ , ]. This probably explains our finding as the majority of women in study group ( n = 22/35) were premenopausal.
One major problem associated with the preoperative evaluation of pelvic masses is the identification of low malignant potential tumors or borderline tumors and endometriosis. Endometriotic cysts do not always warrant surgery, and the approach to treating them is entirely different compared to ovarian malignancy. In the present study, histopathological diagnosis of endometriosis was made in 6/35 patients (20%) and all were premenopausal. CA-125 was elevated in 4/6 women with endometriotic cysts (66.66%) which is a known drawback of CA-125 [ , ]. HE-4 was high in 1/6 women with endometriotic cysts. Hence, specificity of CA-125 compared to HE-4 is lower which is in agreement with other studies (54 Vs 87.5%) [ , , ].
Borderline ovarian tumors (BOTs) are an independent subgroup of tumors which may be difficult to diagnose on frozen section and on serology. In the current study, the overall prevalence of borderline ovarian tumors was (5/35) 14.3% similar to other studies [ ]. Among the five borderline tumors, three were of mucinous origin, while the other two were of serous type. Prevalence of borderline tumors was more in premenopausal group ( n = 4) than postmenopausal group ( n = 1) similar to the published literature [ , ]. Treatment in this group may vary from conservative management to fertility-sparing surgery to staging laparotomy [ ].
Within our sample, HE-4 could differentiate between borderline from malignant masses. However, we need more numbers to establish this fact. Both ROMA and RMI did not perform well in diagnosing borderline tumors preoperatively. The sensitivity of RMI and ROMA in our study was 40% in predicting borderline tumor which is in concurrence with other studies [ , , , ].
When borderline tumors were combined with benign lesions for the purpose of analysis, the sensitivity of ROMA improved from 75 to 91% at 95% confidence interval which means major portion of the false negatives of ROMA were due to borderline ovarian tumors in our study. This is in accordance with other studies [ , , , ].
The combination of serum HE-4 and CA-125 is complementary to each other, and hence, their combination was used to formulate ROMA by Moore et al. [ ]. Even though serum CA-125 and serum HE-4 were falsely negative in 2 of our study patients, ROMA values accurately predicted malignancy which was finally confirmed on histopathology. Therefore, combination of CA-125 and HE-4 is superior over each of them individually. Hence, the ROMA algorithm seems effective in balancing the performance of CA-125 and HE-4 in isolation, providing a higher sensitivity than HE-4 and CA-125 alone. These findings of our study are in line with work published by Moore et al. [ ].
For any screening test to be validated, sensitivity should be high, i.e., it should be able to identify all the true positives. The sensitivity of ROMA was the highest in our study; therefore, based on our results ROMA may be used as a screening tool to identify high-risk group [ ]. In the process of improving the sensitivity of ROMA, its specificity reduces (as it included CA-125 which has a lower specificity). Specificities of HE-4, CA-125, RMI and ROMA were calculated separately. The specificity of HE-4 when compared to ROMA, RMI and CA-125 was superior (87.5% Vs 71, 54.1 and 66.6%) in that order which is in concordance with other research articles and meta-analysis [ , , ].
According to the literature review, HE-4 correctly predicts almost all cases of serous and clear cell carcinomas, but in 2 of our patients HE-4 was normal for serous carcinoma and clear cell carcinoma. Interestingly ROMA in both these patients identified them as high risk of malignancy. One of our major limitations was our sample size due to which we could not analyze pre- and postmenopausal women separately. However, our study is ongoing and we will be analyzing these parameters with better numbers.
Conclusion
The ROMA algorithm showed the best-balanced diagnostic performance to differentiate epithelial ovarian cancers from benign and borderline ovarian cancers. Determination of HE-4, CA-125, RMI and ROMA algorithm was not helpful in differentiating patients with borderline tumors from benign lesions.
ROMA is objective, reproducible. It is a simple scoring based only on biomarkers and menopausal status and can be used in low-resource centers as well.
