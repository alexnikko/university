Introduction
In equine practice, horses that fail to achieve the expected level of performance based on their physical features or those who experienced prolonged periods of performance reduction, usually labeled as poor-performing horses (Couetil ). Anemia is implicated as a cause for poor performance; it is defined as a reduction of oxygen-carrying ability (Morris ).
Anemia causes are numerous, one of which is a widespread tick-borne disease known as “Equine piroplasmosis,” aside from anemia, pyrexia, and icterus are also present. The disease caused mainly by two agents, T. equi (virulent illness) and B. caballi (mild to unapparent illness) (Salem and El-Sherif ). Diagnosis is basically made on signs and physical examination, confirmation is done based on the visualization of causative agent in blood film and PCR detection (Heim et al. ).
One of the crucial pillars for body systemic hemostasis evaluation is the detection of acid-base status, the latter is also indicative of systemic, metabolic, and functional health (Fazio et al. ). When acidosis or alkalosis is suspected, blood gas analysis is crucial prior to initiation of therapy (Rossdale and Partners ). The acid-base balance refers to the balance between pH, partial carbon dioxide pressure (PCO 2 ), and bicarbonate (HCO 3 − ) in the blood including many large molecules such as albumin, lactate, and intracellular proteins (Lindinger ), in addition to CBC and blood biochemistry could indicate extent of tissue damage and be useful indicators for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment evaluation in infested horses with Theileria equi (Zaeemi et al. ).
This study aimed to evaluate hematology, biochemical constituents, acid-base balance, and blood gases in poor-performing anemic working horses infested with Theileria equi .
Material and methods
This study is comprised by 30 Egyptian Balady horses divided into two groups (15 healthy working horses as a control group and 15 poor-performing T. equi -infested working horses).
Horses under investigation were subjected to thorough physical examination including pulse rate, respiratory rate, rectal temperature, superficial lymph nodes, visible mucous membrane status, chest auscultation, and fecal sample examination; the existence of ticks on the coat was determined. The study was carried out during August and September 2017 in Giza Governorate, Egypt.
For the hematological profile, blood was collected from the jugular vein in EDTA-containing tubes; clinical hematology was done within 2 h after the sample collection (Feldman et al. ). Giemsa-stained thin blood films examined for detection of intraerythrocytic stages of T. equi (Krause ). Blood samples in plain vacutainers were left to coagulate at room temperature for collection of clear non-hemolyzed serum which kept at − 20 °C until different biochemical assays were carried out included (gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate transaminase (AST), total protein (TP), albumin, globulin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, sodium (Na + ), potassium (K + ), phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca 2+ ), magnesium (Mg 2+ ), chloride (Cl − ), lactate, and cortisol levels).
Blood pH, partial carbon dioxide pressure (PCO 2 ), bicarbonate (HCO 3 − ) concentration, anion gap (AnGAP), total carbon dioxide concentration (TCO 2 ), partial oxygen pressure (PO 2 ), and oxygen saturation (SO 2 ) levels were measured in heparinized blood samples which transported on ice water bath to the laboratory within (1–2) hours using the blood gas analyzer RADIO METER ABL 505.
For calculation of blood anion gap (AG), the following equation was used: $$ \left(\mathrm{AG}\right)=\left(\left[{\mathrm{Na}}^{+}\right]+\left[{\mathrm{K}}^{+}\right]\right)\hbox{--} \left(\left[{{\mathrm{HCO}}_3}^{-}\right]+\left[{\mathrm{Cl}}^{-}\right]\right). $$
The obtained data were analyzed using ANOVA test using SPSS, statistical program version 16.0 and tabulated as mean value ± SE at levels of significance p ≤ 0.001, p ≤ 0.01, and p ≤ 0.05.
Results
Physical examination of all horses revealed inappetence, hemoglobinuria, icterus, and congested mucous membrane, in addition to fever (39.5 ± 0.194) was recorded in all infected horses. Three stained blood film of each animal were examined under an oil-immersion lens, the examination reveals the presence of small piriform, circular merozoite in RBCs, which is indicative for T. equi .
The hematological parameters determined in the present study are presented in the table. Table 1 showed significant decreases in RBCs, Hb, PCV, monocytes ( p ≤ 0.01), and lymphocytes ( p ≤ 0.001) accompanied with significant leucocytosis ( p ≤ 0.05) with neutrophilia (p ≤ 0.001) along with thrombocytosis and increase in MCHC ( p ≤ 0.05) were detected in anemic horses infested with T. equi .

Discussion
Equine piroplasmosis is a widespread disease characterized by anemia and incriminated in poor performance of horses. In this study, numerous alterations were detected in the hematologic profile in association with the disease. The excessive intravascular hemolysis in response to parasite antigen adhered to RBCs surface and toxic hemolytic factor released by the parasite itself might be contributed to the anemia and significant reduction in RBCs count, PCV %, and Hb concentration. The increased leukocyte count with neutrophilia and increase in MCHC were also reported by Laus et al. ( ). The elevation in infected RBCs along with stimulation of the lymphoid system and bone marrow are directly correlated to elevated WBCs count (Salem and El-Sherif ).
In this study, reduction in both lymphocytes and monocytes were detected. Monocytopenia may occur due to impairment in granuloma formation as a result of infections; also, transient monocytopenia can occur in association with endotoxemia (Territo ). Lymphocytopenia usually occurs at the beginning of the disease followed by lymphocytosis. This is correlated with the effect of disease on lymphoid tissue which may include atrophy and degeneration of lymphocytes followed by proliferation of lymphocytes (Squire ). Mild physiological thrombocytosis can occur by platelet mobilization during and immediately after exercise. The major cause is due to splenic contraction and the release of sequestered platelets into the peripheral circulation (Satué et al. ).
Protein profile showed a significant reduction in affected horses, decrease protein levels during blood parasites infection may occur due to the digestive disturbances, destruction of proteins due to fever as well as decrease production from liver (Barrera et al. ).
A significant increase in cortisol level is in tandem with a higher degree of stress. It was established that appropriate activation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis during illness is essential for survival, and parallels the degree of stress (Christ-Crain et al. ). Effects of cortisol are directed toward the acute provision of energy, protection against excessive inflammation, and improvement in hemodynamic status.
A significant increase of BUN was recorded in this study and that may indicate indirect damage of renal tissue as a result of hemoglobin-induced pigment nephropathy and systemic responses to severe inflammation (Wise et al. ). Significant increases in GGT, AST were observed in this study those results were also recorded by Zobba et al. ( ) who stated that the indirect damage to hepatic tissues and or excessive erythrocytes destruction may result in considerable increase in the level of GGT and AST.
Alteration in blood gases and acid-base were recorded in this study, decrease blood pH and bicarbonate with consequent in high anion gap and reduction of base excess is a basic feature for metabolic acidosis, the later was also recorded by previous studies (Alsaad ). The resultant metabolic acidosis could be linked to lactic acid accumulations and hyperlactemia, as a consequence of tissue hypoxia resulting from reduction of tissue perfusion, in these conditions (anemia, hypovolemic shock), animal perform anaerobic metabolism to sustain energy supply; however, this energy supplementation came with side effect which is lactic acid accumulation and subsequent acidosis (Ayrus and Warrington ).
A decrease in PCO 2 was recorded in this study; PCO 2 reflects the amount of carbon dioxide gas dissolved in the blood. Moreover, PCO 2 is an independent measure of the respiratory component of acid-base balance and were decreased in hypoxia and metabolic acidosis (Radostitis et al. ).
Electrolyte imbalance in association with piroplasmosis was recorded, acidosis induced hypochloremia is an expansion of the extracellular compartment secondary to the extrusion of a cellular cation which occurs in the buffering process (Madias et al. ). Hyponatremia usually occurs due to the elevation of anti-diuretic hormone. This is may be due to true extracellular fluid volume depletion, or decreased effective arterial blood volume which may occur due to poor fluid intake, excessive sweating, or vomiting or might be secondary to hypoalbuminemia (Aylwin et al. ; Schrier ; Sterns et al. ; Wrotek et al. ).
Conclusion
Poor performing horses infested with T. equi are suffering from anemia and metabolic acidosis; which should be put into consideration during treatment of such cases.
