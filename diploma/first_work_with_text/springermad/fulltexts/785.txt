Introduction
Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) was described in a Swedish family by Rolf Kostmann in 1956 [ ]. SCN is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by a severe decrease in the number of blood neutrophils (<0.5 10 9 /l), and a maturation arrest of bone marrow progenitor cells mainly at the promyelocyte/myeloid stage. Homozygous mutations in HCLS1-associated protein X-1 (HAX1) have been identified in patients with autosomal recessive SCN in 2007 [ ].
The term primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) has been used for many similar conditions, including premature ovarian failure, hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, and ovarian dysgenesis [ ]. POI is characterized by amenorrhea for the duration of 4 months or longer, occurring before 40 years of age, with two elevated follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) to menopausal levels [ ]. Its pathophysiology is not completely understood [ , ].
HAX1 is critical for maintaining the inner mitochondrial membrane potential and protecting myeloid cells from apoptosis [ ]. The only study investigating ovarian functions of patients with a p.Glu190X mutation in the HAX1 gene has identified POI in two female patients and normal gonadal function in a male patient [ ]. In this study, the pubertal development and gonadal functions of patients with a p.Trp44X mutation in HAX1 were evaluated.
Method
The medical histories, physical examinations, and laboratory findings of the patients were evaluated. A homozygous single-nucleotide insertion (position 130-131insA) leading to a premature stop codon (p.Trp44X) was detected in all affected individuals. The genetic study of the patients was performed in Uludag University Hospital.
Serum levels of FSH, luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol (E2), free T3, free T4, and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) were measured using chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay technology with flexible assay protocols, referred to as Chemiflex (ARCHITECT system, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA). Insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF-I) and growth hormone (GH) were measured by a solid-phase, enzyme-labeled chemiluminescent immunometric assay (Immulite 2000 systems, Siemens). FSH, LH, and E2 levels vary accordingly to the phase of the menstrual period. The normal values of each factor are given on Table 1 .

To determine bone age, the left hand and wrist radiographs of patients were compared with standards from individuals of the same sex and similar chronological age in the atlas written by Gilsanz and Ratib [ ].
Clonidine test for growth hormone stimulation was performed for patients with low IGF 1 levels (Patients 4, 5, and 6). Clonidine-stimulated GH levels ≥10 ng/ml were considered normal response as reported in the literature [ , ].
Patients
In this study, we evaluated one male and seven female patients with a HAX1 mutation. All patients had a p.Trp44X mutation in the HAX1 gene. They were on regular G-CSF treatment. Patients from four different families were included in the study. The first family included patients 1 to 4, whereas the second family included patients 5 and 6. The remaining two patients belonged to two different families. The pedigrees of these families are given in Figs. 1 and 2 . Fig. 1 The pedigree of family 1 Fig. 2 The pedigree of family 2
Patient 1 was 25 years old and the only male patient with normal adult sexual development. His testis volume was 20/20 ml, and his spermiogram returned normal. FSH and LH levels were 3.1 mIU/ml (normal range 0.9–11.9) and 2.9 mIU/ml (normal range 0.5–12), respectively. Additionally, serum total testosterone {5.28 ng/ml (normal range 2.5–9.5)}, dihydrotestosterone {835.29 pg/ml (normal range 250–990)}, and inhibin B {114.4 pg/ml (normal range 16–225)} levels were also normal.
The age of the female patients is between 13 and 24 years. All female patients have been diagnosed with POI based on elevated gonadotropins and amenorrhea for at least 4 months. Pelvic ultrasounds of the patients revealed small ovarian sizes for their ages. Characteristics of the female patients are summarized in Table 1 .
All patients had complete sexual differentiation. Two sisters (patients 5 and 6) never commenced menstruation, while the remaining female patients had irregular periods.
Short stature was observed in patients 4, 5, and 6. Their height was below 2 standard deviation (SD) from the mean. Serum IGF-1 levels of patients 4, 5, and 6 were low for age and gender at 148 ng/ml, 78 ng/ml, and 177 ng/ml, respectively. Growth velocity of Patient 4, 5, and 6 were 4.5 cm/year, 3.9 cm/year, and 4.9 cm/year before hormone replacement therapy (HRT) (3 mg drospirenon and 0.03 mg ethynyl estradiol) and 7.5 cm/year, 5.5 cm/year, and 8.5 cm/year after HRT, respectively. Furthermore, their peak GH levels after clonidine test were 33.8 ng/ml for Patient 4, 5.9 ng/ml for Patient 5 and, 10.8 ng/ml for Patient 6. Patient 5 was also given a glucagon stimulation test which revealed a peak GH level of 4.04 ng/ml. Although her growth rate after HRT was 5.5 cm/year, peak GH response to stimulation tests was low and GH treatment will be considered according to growth velocity during follow-up. The growth curves of patients 4, 5, and 6 are shown in Fig. 3 . Their bone ages were 1 year behind their chronological ages. Fig. 3 Growth curve of patients 4, 5, and 6 according to Turkish children
Neurological examinations and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain were normal in all patients. All patients were Kurdish except for patient 8 who was Turkish.
Discussion
Homozygous mutations in the HAX1 gene cause Kostmann Disease and contribute to roughly 15% of SCN with a predominance in the Turkish and Middle Eastern population [ ]. The p.Trp44X mutation is defined in the Middle Eastern and Kurdish population, the p.Glu190X in Swedish and p.Arg86X in Japanese populations [ , ].
Germeshausen et al. described two distinct phenotypes, related with different isoforms of HAX1 mutations [ ]. HAX1 mutations cause only neutropenia by affecting isoform A (p.Trp44X, p.Glu59X, p.Glu60fs), whereas mutations affecting both isoforms A and B (p.Arg86X, p.Gln123fs, p.Val144fs, and p.Gln190X) are associated with additional neurological symptoms, including epilepsy and neurodevelopmental delay. Therefore, the presence of isoform B is critical for neuronal functions [ , ]. All of our patients had a p.Trp44X mutation affecting isoform A, and none had epilepsy or neurodevelopmental disorders. Additionally, cranial MRI of all patients was normal.
Homozygous p.Glu190X mutation in two female patients with SCN and pubertal anomalies was first reported by Carlsson et al. in 2013 [ ]. They have proposed that a HAX1 mutation results in ovarian failure due to increased apoptosis of follicles [ ]. HAX1 mRNA is expressed in many tissues, including the testes and ovaries [ , , ]. However, the quantity of HAX1 mRNA in the testis is not always related to the amount of protein production [ ]. In accordance with this information, our patient’s sexual development and functions were normal, despite delayed puberty. Similarly, the pubertal development and functions of the male patient with a p.Glu190X mutation was also normal, as reported by Carlsson et al. [ ].
POI was diagnosed in all female patients who had normal sexual development. Two females have not commenced menstruation yet, and menstrual periods of the remaining female patients were irregular. Ovarian volume varies according to age (0.5–1.5 cm 3 in infancy, 1–4 cm 3 in pre-pubertal years, 2–6 cm 3 in puberty, and 4–16 cm 3 in the reproductive period) [ ]. In our study, all patients had small ovaries for their ages, as determined through sonographic analysis. We speculate that our results indicate an important role of HAX1 in ovary development.
The etiology of POI could not be illuminated in 90% of the patients [ ]. Two major mechanisms have been proposed for the development of POI, follicle dysfunction and follicle depletion [ ]. Follicular dysfunction can be potentially due to FSH-receptor mutations, aromatase deficiencies, or autoimmune lymphocytic oophoritis. Here, follicles are present in the ovary albeit with impaired functions [ ]. On the other hand, no primordial follicles remain in the ovary for follicle depletion. This condition may depend on an inadequate number of primordial follicles in the antenatal period, an accelerated consumption of follicles, or destruction of follicles by autoimmune or toxic causes such as Turner’s syndrome and industrial exposure to 2-bromopropane [ ].
POI, which occurs as a result of diminished ovarian reserve, can be detected by monitoring increased serum FSH levels. Early diagnosis of POI is important as delayed E2 supplementation increases the risk of decelerated pubertal growth, sexual dysfunction, and bone and cardiovascular morbidity [ ]. Consequently, it is important to identify and treat POI as early as possible in patients with HAX1 deficiencies.
During adolescence, there is a reawakening of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and its interaction with the GH/IGF-1 axis to subserve the pubertal growth spurt [ ]. The levels of IGF-1, the main effector of growth, increase during puberty as a consequence of the sex hormones [ , , , ]. Decreased IGF-1 levels in patients with HAX1 deficiency have not been reported so far. The patients did not have any nutritional deficiency. The growth rate increase of these patients after HRT suggests that their short stature was related to gonadal insufficiency. However, despite normal growth rate after HRT, GH response to stimulation tests was low in Patient 5, and her growth velocity is further followed to consider GH therapy.
In summary, all female patients with HAX1 deficiency have been diagnosed with POI in our study. Besides a p.Glu190X mutation in females with HAX1 deficiency, we also showed that a p.Trp44X mutation causes POI. Gonadal functions of female patients need to be followed up by a pediatric endocrinologist. To our knowledge, this is the first report of IGF-1 deficiencies in females with a HAX1 mutation. Additionally, we observed that the severity of gonadal failures varies between the female patients even though the same mutation is present in all of them. The factors affecting interactions between genotypes and phenotypes remain unknown; further studies are required on this subject.
