Highlights
This study investigated the impact of several SNPs within PLA2G7 gene on CHD risk This study also investigated additional gene-environment interaction on CHD risk In the future studies, more polymorphisms in the gene should be evaluated due to the possibility that other SNPs demonstrated subsequently as affecting Lp-PLA2 activity, and the results obtained in this paper should be checked in different populations
Introduction
Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a major cause of death and disability worldwide [ ]. In China, a previous study showed that from 2003 to 2010, the death rate of CHD increased from 141 per 10,000,000 person-years in 2003 to 229 per 10,000,000 person-years in 2010 [ , ]. Both genetic and environmental factors were shown to play an important role in the development of CHD [ ], and heritable factors account for 30–60% of inter-individual variation in the risk of CHD [ ]. Several environmental factors for CHD have been reported previously, such as are smoking, family history, sedentary behavior, hyperlipidemia and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and inflammation [ , , ].
It is indicated that lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) was a new emerging inflammatory marker and has gained more and more focus. Lp-PLA2 belongs to a 45.4-kDa calcium-independent member of the phospholipase A2 family and composes of 441 amino acids [ ], and mainly produced by macrophages in atherosclerotic plaque and secreted into blood [ ]. Human Lp-PLA2 is encoded by the PLA2G7 gene, which is located on chromosome 6p21–p12. Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with CHD, including R92H, V279F, I198T, and A379V. However, the results on association between these SNPs and CHD risk were inconsistent [ , , , ]. CHD susceptibility was also influenced by the synergistic effect between genetic and environmental risk factors, but till now, less study focused on the association between PLA2G7 gene SNPs and environment factors on CHD risk. So the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of several SNPs within PLA2G7 gene, and their additional gene–environment interaction on CHD risk, based on a Chinese population.
Materials and methods
Subjects
Participants with CHD were consecutively recruited between June 2013 and March 2016 from the Beijing Anzhen hospital. The CHD patients were diagnosed by at least two experienced cardiologists and were confirmed by coronary angiography (> 50% diameter stenosis in at least one of the major coronary arteries). And those who had inflammatory diseases, valvular heart disease, cancers, or rheumatoid arthritis were excluded. Healthy controls were randomly selected from a population, who received physical examination in our hospital and nearly 1:1 matched to cases on the basis of age (± 3 years) and sex. Participants with diabetes, hypertension, narrowing in coronary arteries and others CHD related risks were excluded from the controls. Both the CHD cases and controls were unrelated Han Chinese population. Informed consent was obtained from all participants.
Information collection
In procedure of investigation, some information was collected using questionnaire investigation, body measurement conducted by trained staffs and blood samples collection. The content for questionnaire consisted of data on demographic information, smoking and drinking information for all participants. Body weight and height were also measured according to standardized procedures. We defined currently alcohol consumption as > 1 drink of any type per month or not currently drinking as < 1 drink of any type per month; Current smokers were defined as those who have smoked for at least 100 cigarettes and still smoked at the time of the interview, individuals with no history of cigarette smoking were considered as never smokers.
Genomic DNA extraction and genotyping
A total of four SNPs in PLA2G7 gene were selected for genotyping in the study, including rs1805017, rs1805018, rs16874954 and rs1051931. Peripheral venous blood was drawn from each participant. DNA was extracted from buffy coats using QiaAmp blood kits (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) or by the salting out procedure [ ]. All polymorphisms were determined using polymerase chain reaction–restriction fragment-length polymorphism (PCR–RFLP) analysis and prime sequences for all SNPs were shown in Table 1 . The amplification conditions were: 94 °C for 5 min followed by 94/55/72 °C each one for 30 s for 35 cycles and a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. Products were stored at a constant temperature of 4 °C. Samples detected by the PCR–RFLP were also confirmed by direct sequencing using 3730XL DNA Sequencer after identification of a 1.5% agarose gel. Genotyping results were confirmed by randomly assaying 10% of the original specimens for replication to exclude genotyping errors. There were no discrepancies between genotypes determined in duplicate.

Statistical analysis
The means and SDs were calculated for normally distributed continuous variables and compared using Student’s t test. Percentages were calculated for categorical variables and compared using χ 2 test. Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was performed by using SNPStats (available online at http://bioinfo.iconcologia.net/SNPstats ). GMDR model was used to screen the best gene–smoking and gene–drinking interaction combinations, some parameters such as cross-validation consistency, the testing balanced accuracy, and the sign test were calculated. Logistic regression was performed to investigate association between 4 SNPs and CHD. SHESIS was conducted online for the haplotype analysis. A two-sided p value < 0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.
Results
A total of 1269 participants (726 males, 543 females) with a mean age of 62.5 ± 110.8 years old were selected, including 631 CHD patients and 638 normal controls. Table 2 shows the participants characteristics in cases and controls. We found that the mean of BMI and the distributions of smokers, alcohol drinkers, hypertension and T2DM were higher in CHD cases than that in controls, but age and gender were not significantly different between cases and controls.

Table 3 shows the frequencies distributions for alleles and genotypes in four SNPs in cases and controls. The frequencies of minor alleles for rs1805017 and rs1805018 were higher in cases than that in controls. Logistic analysis showed a significant association of minor alleles of rs1805017 and rs1805018 with increased CHD risk, after adjustment for gender, age, smoking and alcohol status, BMI. CHD risks were higher in carriers of homozygous mutant of rs1805017 and rs1805018 than those with wild-type homozygotes, OR (95% CI) were 1.45 (1.16–1.92) and 1.51 (1.23–1.97), respectively, but the other two SNPs, rs16874954 and rs1051931 were not significant associated with CHD risks.

We employed the GMDR to screen the best gene–gene, gene–smoking and gene–alcohol drinking interaction combinations after adjustment for covariates including gender, age, alcohol status, BMI (Table 4 ). GMDR analysis indicated that there was a significant two-locus model (p = 0.0107) involving rs1805017 and smoking, indicating a potential gene–environment interaction between rs1805017 and smoking. Overall, this model had a cross-validation consistency of 9 of 10, and the testing accuracy was 60.11%, p -value was 0.0010. But we did not found any gene–drinking and gene–gene interaction combinations in GMDR models.

Pairwise LD analysis among 4 SNPs was performed and the D′ value between rs9404941 and rs805297 was > 0.75 (0.787). So haplotype analysis for rs9404941 and rs805297 was also conducted using the SHEsis online haplotype analysis software. In all samples, the haplotype R-I was observed most frequently in two groups, with 47.43 and 54.38% in the case and control group of the population, respectively. The results also indicated that the haplotype containing the rs1805017 -H and rs1805018 -T alleles were associated with a statistically increased CHD risk, OR (95% CI) 1.43 (1.10–1.86), p = 0.0021 (Table 5 ).

Discussion
In current study, we found a significant association between variants in rs1805017 and rs1805018 with increased CHD risk, after covariates adjustment. Lp-PLA2 is considered a marker of vascular inflammation, The Cardiovascular Health Study and the Malmo Diet and Cancer Study have both reported associations with higher Lp-PLA2 activity and higher carotid IMT [ , ] and a recent study [ ] also indicated that Lp-PLA2 was positively associated with CVD risk, regardless of the presence of coronary artery calcium or a thickened carotid-intimal media. Human Lp-PLA2 is encoded by the PLA2G7 gene, which is located on chromosome 6p21–p12. Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed several SNPs within PLA2G7 gene associated with CHD, including R92H, V279F, I198T, and A379V. However, the results on association between these SNPs and CHD risk were inconsistent [ , , , ]. Hong et al. [ ] found a higher frequency of H allele of R92H in CHD subgroup was observed than in controls, after adjusting for age, sex, smoking status, hypertension, diabetics, and dyslipidemia, this variant was still the risk factor for CHD, so they demonstrated that nonsynonymous SNPs R92H in PLA2G7 may modify the risk of CHD in Chinese Han population. However, the study participants just consist of 322 diagnosed CHD cases 414 subjects, the sample size was relatively small, so further studies with larger sample size involve functional evaluations were warranted to elucidate the potential mechanism of these polymorphisms in CHD. Xu et al. [ ] suggested that rs7756935 and rs1805017 of the PLA2G7 gene were protective factors against CHD in females. But in other studies, such as Wang et al. [ ] did not find association between V279F and CHD. Another Chinese study [ ] found a significant association between the rs16874954 mutation in PLA2G7 and CAD in the Chinese Han population. Patients with the VF and FF genotype have a higher risk of developing CAD and more severe coronary artery stenosis than others. Both single SNP analysis and haplotype analysis [ ] showed that the V279F and I198T polymorphisms were significantly associated with the reduced Lp-PLA2 activity, but neither was associated with increased CHD risk. Sutton et al. [ ] suggested that PLA2G7 represents an important, potentially functional candidate in the pathophysiology of CAD based on replicated associations using two independent datasets and multiple statistical approaches. The ethnic differences, inclusion criteria, and other factors may be the reasons for these diversities of conclusions. Thus, we selected four polymorphisms (R92H, V279F, I198T, and A379V) in the PLA2G7 for genotyping to verify this association, and in our study, the sample size was relatively larger, so the results obtained in our study was stable and believable. In addition, potential weakness and biases of genetic association studies, such as gene–gene or gene–environment interactive effect, phenotype misclassification, population stratification, and selective reporting biases may also lead to different results, so gene–environment interaction was also necessary to understanding CHD genetic mechanism.
CHD risk was influenced by both genetic and environment al factors, as well gene–environment interactions, in this study, we performed interactions detection for gene–drinking and gene–smoking, we found a potential gene–environment interaction between rs1805017 and smoking, but we did not found any gene–drinking interaction combinations in GMDR models. Previously, the relationship between smoking and CHD or CAD has been confirmed in some studies [ , ]. The potential mechanism for this interaction was not well understood, but rs1501299 and smoking have the similar role on CHD susceptibility, maybe this combined or crossover effect could lead to the interaction between ADIPOQ gene and smoking on CHD risk. Haplotype analysis was also performed for SNPs with heavy LD, we found the haplotype containing the rs1805017 -H and rs1805018 -T alleles were associated with a statistically increased CHD risk.
Several limitations of this study should be considered. Firstly, we did not test the levels for Lp-PLA2. Secondly, gene–gene interaction with some other genes should be investigated in the future studies. Thirdly, we only studied four SNPs of PLA2G7, while more polymorphisms in the gene should be evaluated due to the possibility that other SNPs demonstrated subsequently as affecting Lp-PLA2 activity, and the results obtained in this paper should be checked in different populations.
In conclusion, we found that polymorphisms in rs1805017 and rs1805018, additional interaction between rs1805017 and smoking, and haplotype containing the rs1805017-H and rs1805018-T alleles were associated with increased CHD risk.
