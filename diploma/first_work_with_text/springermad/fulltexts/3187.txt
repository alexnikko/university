Introduction
Ramipril, 2-[ N -[( S )-1-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl]-l-alanyl]-(l S ,3 S ,5 S )-2-azabicyclo[3,3,0] octane-3-carboxylic acid, is widely used in the management of essential hypertension. Ramipril (RAM) is a prodrug and converted to its active metabolite ramiprilat by hydrolytic cleavage of the ester group through hepatic metabolism which is a potent angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor [ ]. The metabolism also yields ramipril diketopiperazine, ramipril acyl glucuronide (RAM-GLU), and ramipril N-glucuronide [ , ].
Several analytical methods have been reported for the estimation of RAM, in biological fluids and pharmaceutical formulations, such as radio immune assay (RIA) [ ], enzyme assay (EA) [ ], atomic absorption spectroscopy [ ], spetroflurometry [ ], polarography [ ], capillary electrophoresis [ ], gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GCMS) [ , , ], UV spectrophotometry [ ], high pressure liquid chromatography couple with UV detection [ , ] and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) [ , , , , , , , , , , ]. However, all these methods have their own disadvantages which include complicated sample pretreatment, time-consuming chromatographic separation, derivatization procedure, low sensitivity (0.1 ng/mL), and large volume of plasma (>500 μL).
To conduct a bioequivalence study of RAM of 2.5 mg capsule, it was essential an assay method with low limit of quantification (LOQ) to evaluate all the pharmacokinetic parameters at elimination phase. Thus, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method developed and has numerous advantages over other existing methods. The pros of the developed method include less aliquot volume (300 μL), higher sensitivity (50 pg/mL), chromatographic separation between RAM and RAM-GLU with short run time, inhibition of in vitro back conversion of RAM-GLU, and null matrix effect observed in all types of matrices (like normal plasma, hemolyzed plasma, lipemic plasma, or whole blood). As a result, accurate estimation of RAM in incurred samples was possible, and this was not reported by any of the published assay methods.

Chromatographic Conditions
Chromatographic separation was carried out on a Shimadzu scientific instrument (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) with a Luna C18 (2) 100A column (150 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) (Phenomenex). A mobile phase consisting of methanol and ammonium acetate (pH 4.5; 5 mM) (85:15, v / v ) was delivered at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. The total analysis run time for each sample was 7.0 min. The injection needle was rinsed with rinsing solution composed of methanol and water (50:50, v / v ) between two injections.
Mass Spectrometric Conditions
The ionization and detection were carried out on a triple quadruple mass spectrometer, MDS Sciex API-4000 (Sciex Division of MDS, Toronto, Ontario, Canada), equipped with electrospray ionization operated in negative polarity using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). The compound and source parameters were optimized by infusing individual neat solution (100.0 ng/mL) of RAM, IS, and RAM-GLU into the mass spectrometer. The mass transitions ( m / z ) were selected as 415.6 → 154.0, 420.3 → 154.0, and 592.2 → 154.1 for RAM, IS, and RAM-GLU, respectively. The optimized compound parameters for monitoring RAM and IS were set as follows: declustering potential (DP), −80.0 V; entrance potential (EP), −10.0 V; collision energy (CE), −36.0 V; and collision cell exit potential (CXP), −8.0 V. The optimized compound parameters for monitoring RAM-GLU were set as follows: DP −48.0 V, EP −5.0 V, CE −50.0 V, and CXP −8.0 V. The source parameters of the mass spectrometer were optimized and maintained as follows: collision activated dissociation gas (CAD), 5 psi; curtain gas (CUR), 20 psi; nebulizer gas (GS1), 50 psi; heater gas (GS2), 50 psi; turbo ion spray voltage, −4200 V; and source temperature, 650 °C. Quadrupole 1 and quadrupole 3 were both maintained at unit resolution, and dwell time was set at 400 ms for all analytes. The data acquisition and processing were performed by Analyst version 1.4.2 software (MDS Sciex, Toronto, Canada). For quantification, the peak area ratios of the target ions of the analyte to those of the internal standard were compared with weighted 1/ X 2 (where, X = drug concentration) least squares calibration curves in which the peak area ratios of the calibration standards were plotted versus their concentrations.
Preparation of Spiked Samples
Two separate stock solutions of RAM were prepared for bulk spiking of calibration standards (CS) and quality control (QC) samples for method validation exercises as well as incurred sample analysis. Stock solution of RAM and IS was prepared in methanol at a concentration of 1 mg/mL, and stock solution of RAM-GLU was prepared in DMSO at a concentration of 1 mg/mL. Working solutions for CS and QC samples were prepared by appropriate dilution in methanol-water (50:50, v / v ). Human K 3 EDTA plasma was screened prior to spiking to ensure that there is no significant endogenous interference at the retention time (RT) of RAM and IS. An eight-point CS and QC samples at four concentration levels were prepared by spiking the blank plasma with an appropriate amount of RAM. Calibration standards samples were prepared at concentrations of 50.3, 138.0, 551.9, 2207.6, 5518.9, 13797.3, 27594.5 and 32850.6 pg/mL. and QC samples at lower LOQ quality control (LOQQC), low quality control (LQC), medium quality control (MQC), and high quality control (HQC) at concentrations of 50.4, 138.1, 13,807.4, and 27,614.7 pg/mL, respectively. Spiking was carried out in an ice-cold water bath, under low-light condition, and bulk spiked CS and QC samples were stored below −50 °C and protected from light till use. The working solution of IS (15.0 ng/mL) for routine use was prepared by diluting the IS stock solution in methanol-water (50:50, v / v ).
Sample Preparation
The plasma sample (300 μL) was aliquoted, and 50 μL of IS working solution (15.0 ng/mL of IS) was added in an ice-cold water bath and vortexed. To this sample, 250 μL of solution-1 (5% ortho -phosphoric acid in water, v / v ) was added and then samples were vortexed. For solid-phase extraction, SPE cartridge (Cleanert PEP-3, 30 mg/1 cm 3 ) was equilibrated with 0.5 mL of methanol followed by 0.5 mL of solution-2 (0.1% ortho -phosphoric acid in water, v / v ). Then, the pretreated samples were loaded onto the cartridge and spun in centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 1 min. The cartridges were washed with 1 mL of washing solution (5% methanol in water, v / v ) twice, and analytes were eluted with 1 mL of methanol. The extracted samples were evaporated to dryness at 20 psi and at 40 °C under a stream of dry nitrogen using a Zymark TurboVap LV evaporator (Caliper, Hopkinton, MA, USA). Dried residue was reconstituted with 300 μL of the mobile phase. The reconstituted samples of 25 μL volume were used for injection in LC-MS/MS system.
Back Conversion Study
For metabolites that are unstable and converting to parent compound, conditions used during sample preparation and analysis must be optimized in order to minimize such conversion and to achieve accurate quantification of the parent drug. Common factors that affect metabolite stability in biological matrices include temperature, light, pH, oxidation, and enzymatic degradation. Acyl glucuronides (O-ester conjugates) are probably the most commonly encountered problematic metabolites in bioanalysis. Acyl glucuronides are unstable and hydrolyze to release aglycone under neutral and alkaline conditions. Hence, during method development back conversion study was carried out for back conversion of RAM-GLU to RAM during a method development phase.
Role of Temperature on Metabolite Back Conversion
The effect of temperature on back conversion of RAM-GLU to RAM was evaluated under different experimental conditions. Working solution of RAM-GLU was spiked into human K 3 EDTA plasma at C max level. The spiked samples were kept at different storage conditions (at room temperature and in an ice-cold water bath) to study the impact of temperature on back conversion. Four aliquots of these samples were processed as per the proposed sample processing technique at time intervals 0.0, 2.0, 4.0, and 6.0 h and were analyzed in an LC-MS/MS system by monitoring both mass transitions of RAM and RAM-GLU in MRM.
Estimation of RAM in the RAM-GLU Working Standard
After evaluating the effect of temperature on back conversion, ice-cold water bath condition was maintained for storing of plasma samples on bench. However, significant peak area response was observed at RT of RAM in the freshly spiked samples (fortified with RAM-GLU) processed in an ice-cold water bath. It was assumed that back-conversion of RAM-GLU to RAM may take place in plasma sample with time. But significant peak area observed (at RT of RAM) in samples processed at 0.0 hr indicated that the parent compound may presence in the working standard of RAM-GLU. Hence, RAM-GLU working standard was tested for RAM interference.
Initially, a neat aqueous dilution of RAM-GLU was prepared in the mobile phase at a concentration of 35 ng/mL (expected C max of RAM-GLU for 12.5 mg formulation) and immediately analyzed in LC-MS/MS. A high peak area was observed at the RT of RAM. Due to in-source fragmentation of RAM-GLU, interference at the RT of RAM could not be possible, as both the compounds were chromatographically well separated in optimized chromatographic conditions. We assumed that RAM-GLU was not converted spontaneously (<2 min) to RAM in an aqueous phase. We confirmed our presumption by repeating the same exercise twice, but the same anticipated results were observed. It clearly indicated that parent compound (RAM) is present in the working standard of RAM-GLU.
To estimate the exact concentration of RAM in the working standard of RAM-GLU, eight-point non-zero calibration standards (contained only RAM) and single dilution of RAM-GLU (at concentration 35 ng/mL) were prepared in the mobile phase, assuming 100% recovery of RAM and RAM-GLU. An equal portion of working solution of IS was added in all the samples. RAM-GLU dilution was analyzed along with the CS set and back-calculated concentration was determined for RAM-GLU dilution.
Demonstration of Selectivity, Precision, and Accuracy in Presence of RAM-GLU
If the back conversion of RAM-GLU is not totally restricted during the sample processing steps and/or sample handling conditions, then quantification of RAM will be affected. Hence, it was essential to perform the selectivity, precision, and accuracy of the assay technique in presence of RAM-GLU.
The selectivity of RAM was tested in presence of RAM-GLU in six different plasma lots. To conduct this experiment, the following samples were prepared and analyzed: a. One aliquot of each plasma lot was processed without RAM-GLU dilution (“type X” sample) b. One aliquot of each plasma lot processed with RAM-GLU dilution (“type Y” sample) c. LOQ sample (RAM alone, with addition of IS working solution)
The final concentration of RAM-GLU in “type Y” samples was 35.0 ng/mL. To estimate the actual % interference in blank samples, the peak area observed at the RT of RAM in “type Y” sample was subtracted from the peak area observed in “type X” sample for each plasma lot, as RAM is already present in the working standard of RAM-GLU.
To analyze a precision-accuracy batch in presence of RAM-GLU, the following sets of QC samples were prepared: a. Protocol-1(control QC): QC samples (at LQC, MQC, and HQC level) were prepared with RAM (2% v / v , spiking) only. Control QC samples were analyzed to validate the freshly spiked CS. b. Protocol-2 (test QC): QC samples (at LQC, MQC, and HQC level) were prepared with both RAM (2% v / v , spiking) and RAM-GLU (1% v / v , spiking). The spiked concentration of RAM-GLU was 35.0 ng/mL in all levels of QC. c. Protocol-3 (unknown samples/RAM-GLU alone): working solution of RAM-GLU was spiked in human K 3 EDTA plasma (1% v / v , spiking) to attain concentration of 35.0 ng/mL.
Spiking was carried out an in ice-cold water bath, and the spiked samples were stored in an ice-cold water bath till processing. Six aliquots of each type of QCs were processed and analyzed with freshly spiked CS. The mean back-calculated concentration of the “unknown samples” was considered the concentration of RAM presence in the spiked RAM-GLU sample and used for the calculation purpose. The deviation at each QC level from the nominal concentration was expected to be within ±15.0%.
Method Validation
A thorough and complete method validation of ramipril in human K 3 EDTA plasma was carried out, as per the USFDA bioanalytical guideline 2001 [ ] and EMEA bioanalytical guideline 2011 [ ]. The method was validated for selectivity, sensitivity, linearity, precision, accuracy, process efficiency, matrix effect, and stability of ramipril during both short-term sample processing and long-term storage.
Selectivity and S/N Ratio
The selectivity of the method towards endogenous plasma matrix components was assessed after screening ten lots (six normal, two hemolyzed, and two lipemic) of human K 3 EDTA plasma, free from all analyte of interest. These samples were processed using the proposed extraction protocol and analyzed with the set chromatographic conditions of ramipril at lower LOQ level. The peak area of the co-eluting components or interferences in a blank sample at the retention time of RAM and IS should be less than 20 and 5% of mean peak area of RAM and IS in a spiked LOQ sample, respectively. The sensitivity was demonstrated by determining the signal to noise (S/N) ratio in all ten lots of screened plasma and spiked LOQ samples. The S/N ratio of spiked LOQ samples was calculated using the following formula: $$ \frac{S}{N}=\frac{\mathrm{Signal}\kern0.5em \mathrm{to}\kern0.5em \mathrm{noise}\kern0.75em \mathrm{ratio}\kern0.5em \mathrm{of}\kern0.5em \mathrm{LOQ}}{\mathrm{Mean}\kern0.5em \mathrm{of}\kern0.5em \mathrm{signal}\kern0.5em \mathrm{to}\kern0.5em \mathrm{noise}\kern0.5em \mathrm{ratio}\kern0.5em \mathrm{of}\kern0.5em \mathrm{blanks}}>5 $$
Linearity, Precision, and Accuracy
Three calibration curves were used to demonstrate the linearity of the method. The ratio of area responses for RAM was used for regression analysis. Each calibration curve was analyzed individually by using least square weighted (1/ X 2 ) linear regression (obtained by the best fit method). Back calculations were made from these curves to determine the concentration of RAM in each calibrator. A correlation coefficient r > 0.99 was desirable for all the calibration curves. In addition, the analyte peak at LOQQC concentration should be identifiable, discrete and reproducible with accuracy within ±20% and a precision ≤ 20%. The deviation of standards other than LOQ from the nominal concentration should not be more than ±15.0%.
The intra- and inter-day precision and accuracy were performed for RAM in K 3 EDTA plasma. The intra-run (within a day) and inter-run (between days) accuracy was determined by replicate analysis of QC samples ( n = 6) at LOQQC, LQC, MQC, and HQC. The precision of the method was determined by calculating the coefficient of variation (% CV) for each QC level. The deviation at each concentration level from the nominal concentration was expected to be <15.0 except for the LOQQC, for which it should be <20.0. Similarly, the mean accuracy should be within ±15.0% except for the LOQQC, for which it should be ±20.0% of the nominal concentration.
Matrix Effect and Process Efficiency
The absolute matrix effect (AME) was estimated by the following equation: $$ \%\mathrm{AME}=\left[1-\frac{\mathrm{Mean}\kern0.5em \mathrm{peak}\kern0.5em \mathrm{area}\kern0.5em \mathrm{response}\kern0.5em \mathrm{of}\kern0.5em \mathrm{analyte}\kern0.5em \mathrm{in}\kern0.5em \mathrm{post}\hbox{-} \mathrm{extracted}\kern0.5em \mathrm{samples}\ }{\mathrm{Mean}\kern0.5em \mathrm{peak}\kern0.5em \mathrm{area}\kern0.5em \mathrm{response}\kern0.5em \mathrm{of}\kern0.5em \mathrm{analyte}\kern0.5em \mathrm{in}\kern0.5em \mathrm{neat}\kern0.5em \mathrm{solution}}\right]\times 100 $$
where the positive value represents the ion suppression and the negative value represents the ion enhancement. As extraction protocol involved a terminal drying step, hence spiking (addition of reference samples) was carried out in a post-extracted blank plasma sample to perform AME. The concentration of RAM and IS in reference sample representing the QC concentration (at LQC, MQC and HQC level). The control sample was reference solution prepared at appropriate concentration in the mobile phase.
Relative matrix effect (RME) was evaluated using ten lots of human K 3 EDTA plasma including two hemolyzed and two lipemic plasma lots, processed in duplicate samples at LOQQC and HQC levels, and the area ratio (i.e., peak area response of RAM/peak area response of IS) was used to check the acceptability of the result. The standard deviation for each lot was calculated, along with % CV and % bias at each level. The deviation of the standards should not be more than ±15% of their respective nominal concentration, and at least 90% of the lots at each QC level should be within the aforementioned criteria.
The process efficiency or recovery (PE) for RAM and IS was determined at low, middle, and high QC concentration levels by measuring the mean peak area response of RAM in six replicates of extracted QC samples (spiked before extraction) against the mean peak area response of RAM in post-extracted samples containing RAM and IS at concentrations equivalent to those obtained in the final extracted concentration for RAM and IS in the QC samples. Recovery of RAM and IS was estimated by using the following equation: $$ \%\mathrm{RE}=\frac{\mathrm{Mean}\kern0.5em \mathrm{peak}\kern0.5em \mathrm{area}\kern0.5em \mathrm{response}\kern0.5em \mathrm{of}\kern0.5em \mathrm{analyte}\kern0.5em \mathrm{in}\kern0.5em \mathrm{extracted}\kern0.5em \mathrm{samples}\ }{\mathrm{Mean}\kern0.5em \mathrm{peak}\kern0.5em \mathrm{area}\kern0.5em \mathrm{response}\kern0.5em \mathrm{of}\kern0.5em \mathrm{analyte}\kern0.5em \mathrm{in}\kern0.5em \mathrm{post}\hbox{-} \mathrm{extracted}\kern0.5em \mathrm{samples}}\times 100 $$
Stability Exercises
Stability experiments were carried out to examine the stability of RAM in stock solution and in plasma samples under different conditions. Stock solution stability was performed by comparing peak area response of RAM and IS in a stability sample, with the peak area response of a sample prepared from fresh stock solution. Stability studies in plasma were performed at LQC and HQC level using four replicates at each level. The analyte was considered stable if the % change is less than 15, as per USFDA/EMEA guidelines, and was calculated by using the following formula: $$ \%\kern0.5em \mathrm{Change}=\left[\frac{S}{F}-1\right]\times 100 $$
where S = mean concentration of stability samples and F = mean concentration of freshly spiked samples.
The bench top stability was determined by stored spiked QC samples for ~6.0 h in an ice-cold water bath before processing. The autosampler stability was determined by stored reconstituted QC samples for ~90 h under autosampler condition (at 5 °C) before being analyzed. The freeze-thaw stability was conducted by comparing the stability samples that had been frozen at −50 °C and thawed at room temperature three times, with freshly spiked QC samples. Four aliquots each of LQC and HQC concentration level were used for the freeze-thaw stability evaluation. For long-term stability evaluation, the concentrations obtained after 120 days were compared with initial concentrations. All stability exercises were performed against freshly spiked CS.
Human K 3 EDTA whole blood spiked with working solutions (at LQC and HQC level) was prepared, and after spiking, the spiked sample was split into two aliquots (A and B). Aliquot A was placed for 10 min in an ice-cold water bath and centrifuged at 4 °C, and the resulting plasma was used as a comparison sample. Aliquot B was kept in an ice-cold water bath for 2.0 h and centrifuged at 4 °C, and the resulting plasma (stability samples) was analyzed with the comparison samples in the same batch to access the % stability during the sample collection process. The analyte was considered stable if the % stability is 85–115 and was calculated by using the following formula: $$ \%\kern0.5em \mathrm{Stability}=\frac{\mathrm{Mean}\kern0.5em \mathrm{area}\kern0.5em \mathrm{ratio}\kern0.5em \mathrm{of}\kern0.5em \mathrm{stability}\kern0.5em \mathrm{samples}}{\mathrm{Mean}\kern0.5em \mathrm{area}\kern0.5em \mathrm{ratio}\kern0.5em \mathrm{of}\kern0.5em \mathrm{comparison}\kern0.5em \mathrm{samples}}\times 100 $$
Method Application
An open-label, balanced, randomized, two-treatment, two-period, two-sequence, single-dose, crossover design was used for the assessment of pharmacokinetics and bioequivalence. Forty healthy volunteers who gave written informed consent took part in this study. The study was approved by Ethics Committee of Institutional Review Board at Jamia Hamdard Institutional Review Board, New Delhi, India. A single oral dose of ramipril 2.5 mg capsule of Ranbaxy and Altace® capsule of Sanofi-Aventis. Inc., Canada, was given to the volunteers during each period of the study. Blood samples were collected before (pre-dose) and at 0.083, 0.167, 0.250, 0.333, 0.417, 0.500, 0.583, 0.667, 0.833, 1.000, 1.333, 1.667, 2.000, 2.500, 3.000, 3.500, 4.000, 5.000, 6.000, 8.000, 10.000, and 12.000 h post-dose in each period. After separation of plasma from blood by centrifugation, plasma samples were stored frozen below −50 °C until analysis.
Incurred sample reanalysis (ISR) reinforces the confidence in a bioanalytical method by demonstrating reproducibility in the measurement of study data. The possible causes of irreproducibility in ISR can be due to many reasons, which may include: back conversion of metabolite to its parent compound, isomeric changes, effect of pH, drug-protein binding differences in subject samples, matrix interference related issues, effect of concomitant medications or variations process efficiency. Therefore, reproducibility of the method was confirmed by performing ISR. ISR was assessed using a total of 159 sample sets, selected from 37 subjects who completed all two periods of the study. The incurred samples from a C max time point and elimination phase (at least three times of LOQ concentration) comprising of 80% sample set and the remaining 20% as random sample time points were selected. The acceptance criterion for the ISR analytical run was 67% (two thirds of the total sample size) and should lie within 20% difference [ ]. The % difference from the original analysis was calculated as follows: $$ \%\kern0.5em \mathrm{Difference}=\frac{\mathrm{Reanalyzed}\kern0.5em \mathrm{concentration}\hbox{--} \mathrm{Original}\kern0.5em \mathrm{concentration}}{\mathrm{Mean}\kern0.5em \mathrm{concentration}}\times 100 $$
Results and Discussion
Optimization of Mass Parameters
Ramipril is reported to be highly variable drug in terms of pharmacokinetic (PK) behavior with low C max value. For accurate and reliable characterization of PK profile, it is essential to develop a sensitive method with low LOQ (50.0 pg/mL) for 2.5 mg formulation. In order to develop a method with the desired LOQ, it was necessary to use MS-MS detection. Because the analyte have a carboxylic acid moiety, electrospray in a positive ion mode was evaluated but was less sensitive than the negative ion mode. Likewise, atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) was also assessed but provided no advantages over electrospray. During product ion scan, the major product ions at m / z 154.0, 166.2, and 191.2 were observed. The predominant product ion of m / z 154.0 is specific for RAM and corresponding deuterated analog. During optimization, it was observed that CE and CAD are most critical parameter to achieve the highest sensitivity and stable response for RAM. Product ion spectra of RAM, IS, and RAM-GLU are shown in Fig. 2 . During optimization, in-source fragmentation (collision induced dissociation, CID) of RAM-GLU was noted. Fig. 2 MSMS spectra. Ramipril ( above ), ramipril-d5 ( middle ), and ramipril acyl beta-D-glucuronide ( below )
Chromatographic Conditions Optimization
In-source fragmentation of RAM-GLU should be avoided for accurate estimation of RAM in biological matrix, and therefore, chromatographic separation between RAM and RAM-GLU is utmost priority. During method optimization, it was noted that when acetonitrile was used in the mobile phase, RAM and RAM-GLU eluted at the same RT, although acetonitrile led to low back pressure at column end and high aqueous portion in the mobile phase suppressed the peak area response of RAM. When methanol was used in the mobile phase, RAM and RAM-GLU peaks were separated with poor resolution ( R s < 0.6), but in acidic condition (pH 4.5), resolution was improved. For the separation of RAM and RAM-GLU, several C18 and phenyl columns like Poroshell 120 EC-C18, Ascentis express, Sunshell C18, Kinetex C18, Hypurity advance, Zorbax SB-C18, Discovery C18, Unisol C18, Luna C18(2), kinetex PFP, and ACE C18 PFP were tried. Many columns with fused-core technology were also evaluated to attain resolution between RAM and RAM-GLU, but due to high back pressure, these columns could not be used. RAM and RAM-GLU were chromatographically well separated ( R s > 1.2) on Luna C18 (2) 100A (150 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) column using the mobile phase consisting of methanol-ammonium acetate (pH 4.5; 5 mM) (85:15, v / v ). This could be due to lower carbon loading of the column, enabling the selectivity by base material of the column, and lower carbon load reduces RT of analyte and increased high throughput. In addition, the mobile phase with high organic solvent ratio increased the ionization efficiency of RAM. Additionally, at pH 4.5, co-eluting peaks as well as interference from matrix ions were absent, which actually causes a null matrix effect.
Sample Preparation
Process efficiency has increased using basified methanol as an elution solvent, but at basic condition (pH>7.0) back conversion took place. At higher pH, the labile metabolite (RAM-GLU) which is presence in the incurred samples easily converted to RAM and lead to pseudo estimation of RAM in incurred samples (or unknown samples). The drawback of basified methanol elution were not addressed by Tan et al., [ ], as back conversion could not identified in CS and QC samples, where RAM present alone. Hence, methanol was used for elution of analyte from the SPE cartridge, and to increase the PE sample, a pretreatment step was optimized again. Upon re-optimization, it was observed that samples pretreated with ortho -phosphoric acid solution (5%, v / v ) showed higher and consistent PE across all QC levels. But it was noted that when extracted samples were analyzed followed by a neat aqueous sample or vice versa, a gradual increase in peak area response of RAM was observed up to third injections. As a part of investigation, when a processed blank sample was analyzed for 45 min, a late eluting matrix peak was identified. The late eluting peak which is actually eluted at the RT of RAM in the second subsequent injection and enhance the area response of RAM in the second injection. Re-equilibration of the PEP-3 cartridge with 0.5 mL of ortho -phosphoric acid solution (0.1%, v / v ) resolved this problem, and this could be due to elimination of the matrix from the cartridge bed.
Selection of Internal Standard
Selection of an internal standard with similar chromatographic and mass spectrometric behavior to that of analyte is of utmost priority for LC-MS/MS analysis. Usage of structure related isotopic labeled compound (SIL, ramipril-d 5 ) as an internal standard have some key advantages over the other compounds in LC-MS/MS assays. Due to similar physicochemical properties with RAM, ramipril-d 5 shows similar retention time in reverse-phase liquid chromatography, similar fragmentation pattern in mass spectroscopy, and equivalent extraction efficiency with that of RAM. Therefore, ramipril-d 5 was selected as an IS.
Back Conversion Study
Role of Temperature on Metabolite Back Conversion
During method development, the effect of temperature on RAM-GLU stability was evaluated in plasma and data shown in Table 1 . It was clearly understood that the back conversion of RAM-GLU to RAM was not taken place at 0.0 h as samples processed at 0.0 h in an ice-cold water bath also showed a significant peak area for RAM. Depending upon the storage conditions, the rate of back conversion of RAM-GLU was influenced. Due to the presence of the parent compound (RAM) in working standard of its metabolite (RAM-GLU), high peak area response of RAM was observed in spiked samples (at 0.0 hr) that were processed in an ice cold water bath. From this experiment, it was clearly understood that temperature has a role on the back conversion of RAM-GLU to RAM and to block the back conversion pathway; ice-cold water bath condition was compulsory for spiking and sample preparation.

Estimation of RAM in Working Solution of RAM-GLU
After analysis of the neat solution of RAM-GLU, it was concluded that the working standard of RAM-GLU contained the trace amount of parent compound (RAM), which actually gave the peak area at the RT of RAM upon analysis. Hence, the actual concentration of RAM was estimated in the working standard of RAM-GLU. The estimated concentration of RAM was 117.1 pg/mL in the prepared working solution of RAM-GLU at a concentration 35.0 ng/mL.
Selectivity, Precision, and Accuracy with RAM-GLU
The estimated concentration of RAM in the working solution of RAM-GLU was higher than the two times of LOQ concentration of the assay method. Therefore, selectivity and precision-accuracy batch was performed based on a subtraction method, where mean estimated concentration of RAM in the “unknown samples” was subtracted from the original back-calculated concentration of the “test sample”. Similarly, for selectivity demonstration in presence of RAM-GLU, its metabolite peak area was used for calculation.
The selectivity in presence of RAM-GLU data is showed in Table 2 , where no significant interference was observed at the RT of RAM and IS. The mean % interference observed at the RT of RAM and IS between six different lots of human plasma was 5.85 and 0.03 for RAM and IS, respectively, which was within acceptance criteria. After subtracting the observed mean concentration of “unknown samples” from the calculated concentration of each “test QC samples,” all the “test QC samples” were within the acceptable range for % nominal criteria. The precision and accuracy data in presence of RAM-GLU is tabulated in Table 3 and found acceptable.

Selectivity and S/N Ratio
There was no significant interference observed at the RT of RAM and IS in screened plasma lots. The typical chromatograms of a blank sample, blank-processed with IS, LOQ, and ULOQ, and incurred sample in human plasma are shown in Fig. 3 . We observed that S/N ratio was >25 during method validation and incurred sample analysis, which was within acceptable limit as per the USFDA/EMEA guidelines.

Linearity, Precision, and Accuracy
The limit of quantification was 50.3 pg/mL of RAM in plasma. The precision and relative errors at LOQQC level were 5.2 and 4.1%, respectively. The calibration curve was linear from 50.3 to 32,850.6 pg/mL for RAM in human plasma. Calibration curve was constructed using the peak area ratio of analyte to the internal standard and by applying linear, weighted least squares regression analysis with a weighting factor of 1/(concentration) 2 . The r was greater than 0.99 during the course of validation and incurred sample analysis. The results of three precision and accuracy batches are summarized in Table 4 . The intraday precision and inter-day precision (% CV) ranged from 1.9 to 5.2 and the intraday and inter-day relative error (bias) ranged from 3.3 to 5.3%.

Matrix Effect and Process Efficiency
The % CV of AME at QC level was in the range of 0.6 to 1.1, and between three QC levels, it was 1.3. The results indicated there was no significant matrix effect for RAM followed by the extraction procedure of the method. Similar peak area response of RAM was observed in neat solution and all types of matrix used for comparative matrix analysis (Fig. 4 ). The results of the relative matrix effect (RME) and IS-normalized matrix factor are presented in Table 5 . The PE of RAM and IS were consistent across the QC levels. The mean PE of RAM and IS by the method were 81.1 and 79.1% respectively and are shown in Table 6 . The % CV of mean PE across the low, middle, and high QC levels was <3.

Stability Exercises
Stock solution stability of RAM and IS was established for 12 days at specified conditions, and % stability of RAM and IS was 102.3 and 100.0, respectively. RAM was proved to be stable in plasma for three freeze-thaw cycles. Bench top stability of RAM was established for ~6.3 h in human plasma in an ice-cold water bath and under low-light conditions. Autosampler stability was assessed for ~94 h and long-term stability was established at −50 °C for 120 days. The observed mean nominal concentration of RAM was found to be within ±15% of their respective nominal concentration, and % CV was less than 15 at LQC and HQC levels (Table 7 ). Ramipril was stable in human K 3 EDTA whole blood for ~2.0 h.

Method Application
Following analysis, pharmacokinetic parameters like peak plasma concentration ( C max ), time ( T max ) to reach C max , t 1/2, AUC 0→ t , and AUC 0→∞ were calculated by non-compartmental analysis using WinNonlin Professional software (Version 5.0, Pharsight Corp., Mountain View, CA, USA). The pharmacokinetic parameters summarized in Table 8 are the mean estimates obtained from 37 subjects, who completed all periods of the study. The linear plot of mean plasma concentration (pg/mL) versus time (h) and semilog plot of mean plasma concentration (pg/mL) versus time (h) are shown in Fig. 5 . ISR results demonstrated that the samples with percentage difference within ±20% were 95%.

Conclusion
In summary, a rapid, selective, specific, reproducible, and high-throughput LC-MS/MS method was developed and validated to estimate ramipril in human plasma using ramipril-d 5 as an internal standard. The proposed assay method showed good performance with respect to all the validation parameters tested and demonstrated optimized working conditions for ramipril in human plasma. Validation parameters which were performed in presence of RAM-GLU (like selectivity, precision, and accuracy) and ISR data confirmed that there was no back conversion of labile phase II metabolite to parent compound in all the working conditions. The assay method was successfully employed for a bioequivalence study of ramipril after oral administration of 2.5 mg ramipril capsule.
