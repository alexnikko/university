Background
Although age-adjusted stroke incidence is higher in men, women are more likely than men to suffer a stroke during their lifetime because of a longer life expectancy [ , ]. In addition, women have worse outcomes after stroke compared to men, especially when disability and quality of life are measured [ , ]. There are many proposed reasons for why this occurs, including older age at stroke onset, higher likelihood of pre-stroke dependence [ , ], a disadvantageous sociocultural status [ , , , ], atrial fibrillation associated with more severe strokes from cardioembolic causes [ , , , ], or post-stroke depression [ , ]. However, several studies have shown that women achieved a similar post-stroke functional outcome to men when treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA) and thus, the benefit of thrombolysis might be greater in women versus in men [ , , , , ]. In contrast, some studies reported no evidence of a greater benefit from thrombolysis in women [ , ]. Moreover, one of those studies reported that men were approximately three times as likely to have good functional outcomes (Barthel index ≥ 95) [ ]. It is important to note that none of the prior studies assessing for a tPA-gender treatment interaction accounted for pre-stroke functional status, such as ambulation.
Accordingly, our study investigated whether there is a significant difference in 3-month outcome between men and women with or without intravenous thrombolysis treatment, after accounting for pre-stroke ambulation status. We also assessed the relationship between thrombolysis, gender, and discharge disposition as an intermediate outcome.
Methods
Using stroke registry data, the medical records of patients admitted to Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center between October 2012 and July 2015 were reviewed. There were 1390 acute ischemic stroke patients admitted during this time frame, and of these, 370 patients had no 3-month outcome data and were excluded. In addition, 68 patients treated with intra-arterial intervention (28 with both IV tPA and intra-arterial intervention, and 40 with intra-arterial only) and 26 patients with missing NIH stroke scale (NIHSS) scores were excluded from the study. Therefore, 926 patients (66.6%) were included in the final analysis.
Clinical information included the following: age, gender, ethnic group, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, history of prior stroke, first-degree family history of stroke, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, coronary artery disease, current smoking, alcohol history (more than seven drinks a week; a standard drink is equal to 12 oz of beer, 5 oz of wine, or 1.5 oz of 80-proof distilled spirits), pre-stroke ambulation aid use (surrogate for pre-stroke modified Rankin Scale (mRS), which was unavailable), medication use (antiplatelet/anticoagulant, statin, antihypertensive) for ≥ 3 months at stroke onset, use of IV tPA/onset to treatment time, discharge destination (four categories: home, inpatient rehabilitation facility, skilled nursing facility, or hospice/death), the NIHSS score, blood pressure and glucose levels at admission, and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (determined according to the definitions in the Safe Implementation of Thrombolysis in Stroke-Monitoring Study [ ], the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke trial [ ], and the European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study II [ ]). The primary outcome was mRS score as documented in the follow-up clinic note by the stroke nurse practitioner or neurologist. Stroke patients discharged from Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center are typically first seen in the Stroke Transition Clinic by a stroke NP and then are scheduled for 3-month follow-up by a stroke faculty member. The mRS score is documented at each follow-up visit. For analysis, the mRS scores were dichotomized as < 3 (good outcome) or ≥ 3 (poor outcome).
Two-sample t tests or chi-square tests were used to compare the clinical characteristics between men and women. The 3-month functional outcome (mRS score < 3 or ≥ 3) was compared by gender and by thrombolysis treatment using the Chi square test.
The primary analysis used an ordinal logistic regression model with the 7-level mRS (0–6) as the outcome. Candidate covariates included age, gender, age-by-gender interaction, NIHSS score, pre-stroke ambulation aid, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, high blood pressure, and prior stroke. Variables which were significant at P < 0.1 in univariate models were included in a backwards selection approach where P < 0.1 was needed for retention.

Results
The mean age of the 926 patients (470 men and 456 women) was 66.9 years (range, 19–99 years) at admission. Table 1 shows the comparison between genders in the clinical characteristics of the 926 patients included in the study. Women were more likely than men to be older, have atrial fibrillation, have pre-stroke ambulation aid use, and poor 3-month outcomes (mRS score ≥ 3), but had lower diastolic blood pressure. Compared with women, men were more often white, more likely to receive intravenous thrombolysis, and have coronary artery disease, antiplatelet use, and be current smokers and alcohol users. There was a significant difference in discharge disposition, such that men were more likely to be discharged to home while women were more often discharged to inpatient rehabilitation facility or skilled nursing facility (59.6% of men to home, vs 49.1% of women; P = 0.001).

In addition, differences between genders were analyzed in only those patients treated with tPA. Similar to the overall cohort, women were more likely than men to be older and have pre-stroke ambulation aid use and men were more often current smokers. There was a trend toward higher prevalence of coronary artery disease and alcohol use. However, there was no significant difference in the incidence of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage between genders (Supplementary Table 1 ).
When 3-month outcomes were compared between genders in the patients without thrombolysis, women were more likely to have poor functional outcomes (mRS score ≥ 3; 55.1 vs 40.1%, P < 0.001). The worse outcome in women remained significant (odds ratio 2.02, 95% confidence interval 1.39 to 2.94, P < 0.001) in adjusted logistic regression analysis using variables of age, NIHSS, pre-stroke ambulation aid use, diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and prior stroke. However, no significant difference of the outcome was found between genders in patients with thrombolysis ( P = 0.736). For the comparison within each gender, in women, there was no significant difference in outcome with or without thrombolysis ( P = 0.265), but in men, there was a trend toward worse outcome with thrombolysis ( P = 0.052; Fig. 1 ). Fig. 1 Comparison of outcomes between genders treated or not treated with intravenous thrombolysis. Among patients not treated with thrombolysis, women had a worse outcome than men (3-month mRS ≥ 3: 55.9 vs 40.5%, P < 0.001). However, the outcome was similar between genders in the patients treated with thrombolysis ( P = 0.547). tPA indicates use of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator
A shift analysis of the full range of mRS scores in men and women stratified by tPA or no tPA shows that women have a proportional increase in mRS scores of 0, 1, and 2 with tPA (Fig. 2 a). In men, there is a proportional increase in the scores of 5 and 6, but a decrease in scores of 0 and 1 with tPA (Fig. 2 b). Fig. 2 Proportion of modified Rankin scale scores in women ( a ) and men ( b ) with and without thrombolysis. tPA indicates use of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator
We explored the relationship between thrombolysis, stroke severity (initial NIHSS), discharge disposition (an intermediate outcome), and 3-month mRS in men and women separately (Table 2 ). We found that in women who received tPA, the NIHSS was higher, but there was no impact on discharge to home or a good outcome (mRS score of 0–2) compared to women who did not receive tPA. In men, NIHSS was also higher in those who received tPA but there was a significantly lower proportion of men discharged home and a trend toward a lower likelihood of a good outcome compared to men who did not receive tPA. Table 2 Association of thrombolysis with initial NIHSS, discharge home, and 3-month mRS: mean ± standard deviation or n (%) Women ( n = 456) Men ( n = 470) tPA ( n = 71) No tPA ( n = 385) P tPA ( n = 113) No tPA ( n = 357) P Initial NIHSS 12.2 ± 8.2 7.0 ± 7.8 < 0.001 10.4 ± 7.4 5.98 ± 7.3 < 0.001 Discharge home 31 (43.7) 193 (50.1) 0.316 56 (49.6) 224 (62.7) 0.013 mRS score of 0–2 at 3 months 37 (52.1) 173 (44.9) 0.265 56 (49.6) 214 (59.9) 0.052 NIHSS NIH Stroke Scale, mRS modified Rankin Scale, tP tissue plasminogen activator
Multivariate analysis also showed the interaction between thrombolysis and gender (odds ratio 4.40, 95% confidence interval 2.38 to 8.14, P < 0.001) was independently associated with mRS, even after adjustment for gender, pre-stroke ambulation aids, age, age-by-gender interaction, NIHSS, diabetes, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and prior stroke (Table 3 ).

Discussion
Our study of stroke patients treated at a single large comprehensive stroke center confirms four key findings: (1) women were more likely to have a worse outcome than men when not treated with intravenous thrombolysis, (2) women were less likely to receive thrombolysis than men, (3) the gender difference in outcome was reduced when treatment with IV tPA was included, as shown by the significant interaction between thrombolysis and gender, and (4) there was a trend toward worse outcome in men who received IV tPA. This interaction remained even after adjustment for relevant covariates and the age-by-gender interaction, showing the significant impact of increasing age on outcome in women but not men (Table 3 ; interaction p value 0.039). Together, our results ultimately conclude that, among those treated with IV tPA, women benefit more than men, and provide further evidence that studies focused on gender differences in stroke need to include tPA treatment in order to accurately assess disability outcomes.
These results also build on the evidence showing the consistency of the interaction between sex and thrombolysis on outcome across different populations. A Canadian non-clinical trial registry showed a similar treatment-by-sex interaction with Stroke Impact Scale-16 as the primary outcome at 90 days [ ]. This Canadian population was primarily Caucasian, whereas our population is centered in the heart of the Stroke Belt, with 32.8% of women and 26.5% of men of non-Caucasian ethnicity. There was no significant ethnic difference in the response to thrombolysis in men or women, however (Supplementary Table 2 ).
Our analysis is further strengthened by the inclusion of an age-by-gender interaction term and pre-stroke ambulation in the model, which are important confounders in analyses of sex differences in outcome [ ]. Pre-stroke ambulation is a factor that some have speculated could explain the worse functional outcome in women versus men [ , ]. Pre-stroke mRS scores were not available on these patients, but ambulation status is a standard assessment that is documented by case management, thus we used this as a surrogate for mRS. The treatment-by-gender interaction remained associated with the outcome even after adjustment for this important confounder. In addition, in the univariate analysis, men were more likely to be discharged home, whereas women were more likely to be transferred to inpatient rehabilitation or skilled nursing facility, despite a similar stroke severity at onset. Therefore, the differences in outcome were notable even at discharge. To explore this further, we performed a subgroup analysis of discharge disposition and thrombolysis treatment in men and women separately. We found no difference in discharge to home with thrombolysis in women (43.7 vs 50.1% no thrombolysis; P = 0.316), but men were less likely to be discharged home after treatment with thrombolysis (49.6 vs 62.7% no thrombolysis; P = 0.013). Because discharge disposition is an intermediate outcome, and related to mRS scores, we did not include this in the final model. Although we have interpreted these data to suggest a better response to tPA in women, we could also suggest that men had complications from the stroke and/or tPA treatment that prevented discharge to home, ultimately leading to higher disability at 3 months than women. These complications in men, however, did not include symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, since there was no significant difference in the incidence between genders among patients treated with tPA (Supplementary Table 1 ). In contrast to our results, an analysis from a large IV thrombolysis registry reported an association between male gender and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage [ ]. Further studies are needed to confirm the nature of the association.
As more studies are published on this topic, the results seem to vary more widely, perhaps because of the population being studied. Some studies support our findings of gender differences in response to tPA. For example, a Canadian study showed that major neurologic improvement (≥ 8-point improvement in NIHSS score or an NIHSS score of 0 or 1 at 24 h) after IV tPA was more frequent in women than in men, even after adjusting for covariates [ ]. A study from Poland analyzing both tPA-treated and non-treated stroke patients showed that women had a better improvement in 24-h NIHSS after IV tPA than men [ ]. This same study showed worse outcomes at 3 months in women in the untreated patients, but no interaction analysis was done.
In addition, analyses of patients treated with IV tPA have also reported no difference in outcome by gender after adjustment for relevant covariates [ , , , , ]. Of these, in particular, one study [ ] prospectively included in the study 45,079 patients treated with IV tPA from multiple nations. This large registry noted differences in outcome between men and women, but these differences were no longer present after adjustment for confounders, such as age, NIHSS, pre-stroke mRS, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation. A study using data from the Virtual International Stroke Trials Archive showed that in a matching analysis of important covariates, there were no gender differences in outcome whether or not IV thrombolysis was administered. In fact, there was also no significant sex-by-treatment interaction found [ ]. The study only includes clinical trial data, which is beneficial because of the randomization to treatment versus not, however, this cohort may not be generalizable to our routine practice cohort, and thrombolysis is now the standard of care. Studies with results opposite to our study have also been published. A recent study by Spaander et al. showed that in a large European cohort of IV thrombolysis registries in Europe, women treated with thrombolysis had worse outcome than men (odds ratio 1.15, 95% confidence interval 1.02 to 1.31) after adjustment for age, stroke severity, and pre-stroke mRS score [ ].
Women were less likely to receive thrombolysis in our cohort, which has been shown in multiple other studies [ , , , ]. We performed an exploratory analysis of factors associated with receiving tPA and found no relationship between use of ambulation aids pre-stroke and receiving tPA (Supplementary Table 3 ). Therefore, just because women were more likely to use ambulation aids on admission, this was not the reason they were not given tPA. Other reasons may be delays in arrival since women are more likely to be living alone, which then puts them outside the time window [ ], or women may fear of the risks of tPA leading to patient or caregiver refusal of treatment [ ].
The main limitation of our study is its retrospective design, performed at a single center, in which 464 patients were excluded from the analysis mainly because of missing data. Selection bias may be thus inevitable. We analyzed differences in baseline characteristics between those patients included and excluded in this study. The patients who were excluded were more often white (78.4 vs 70.5%, P = 0.002), had coronary artery disease (26.9 vs 21.4%, P = 0.021), and more often received acute recanalization treatment (31.0 vs 19.9%, P < 0.001; supplementary ` 4 ). In terms of outcome ascertainment, mRS was obtained from clinical documentation by clinicians, with most, but not all, who were certified in mRS scoring. In addition, it was an observational study with no randomization (due to thrombolysis treatment as standard of care), so all the differences between treatment groups could not be completely controlled by adjusting potential confounders.
Our study also has several strengths in that it was an ethnically and geographically (rural and urban) diverse cohort of patients treated in routine practice in the Stroke Belt, including both patients who were and were not treated with IV tPA. In addition to age and the age-by-gender interactions, we assessed for pre-stroke ambulatory status and discharge disposition, two of the most important potential confounders of gender differences in stroke. Lastly, the multivariable model had a high c statistic of 0.788, suggesting good discrimination of the model.
Collectively, our study confirmed the benefit of IV tPA in women versus in men. It is important for clinicians on the acute stroke team and in the emergency department to understand that there are sex differences in the treatment with thrombolysis and the response to thrombolysis. Our data also suggest that the mediating effect of thrombolysis is independent of ambulatory status prior to the stroke. More research is needed to understand the biases that lead to women being less likely to receive thrombolysis, and the mechanisms for the improved response to thrombolysis compared to men.
