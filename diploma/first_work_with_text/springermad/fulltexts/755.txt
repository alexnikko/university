Introduction
severe combined immunodeficiencies (SCID) are primary immunodeficiencies with defective development and/or function of T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes and natural killer cells with absence or very low number of T lymphocytes (CD3 T lymphocytes < 300/μL) and no or very low T lymphocyte function (< 10% of lower limit of normal) as measured by response to phytohemagglutinin [ ]. The primary aim of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for SCID is to cure the immune defect and achieve long lasting immune reconstitution of normal and functional T, B and NK cells but long-term impact of pre-HSCT chemotherapy, and immune reconstitution of specific SCID genotypes are poorly documented [ , ]. To date, there are limited data on the long-term outcome of IL7Rα SCID [ ]. Both Artemis SCID and RAG1/2 SCID are B− SCID with worse outcomes compared to B+ SCID, in terms of overall survival and immune reconstitution [ ]. A multicenter study comparing 145 patients with Artemis SCID and RAG1/2 deficiencies SCID found no significant differences in survival, early toxicity or occurrence of tumours following HSCT; but Artemis SCID developed more late complications post-transplantation associated with exposure to alkylating agents during conditioning [ ]. The study also showed that unconditioned recipients of RAG1/2 and Artemis SCID achieved lesser CD4+ T lymphocyte counts and were more likely to receive ongoing immunoglobulin replacement therapy, suggesting poorer myeloid engraftment post-HSCT. However, those who received conditioning had poorer overall survival and higher long-term side effects but better immune reconstitution. This highlighted the need for safer conditioning to minimize long-term side effects, but at the same time ensuring maximal engraftment and better immune reconstitution. As the immune defects have been corrected, the expectation is that SCID survivors would lead an optimal normal life. Despite this assertion, there are limited available published data on the quality of life (QoL), and those available are mainly focused on SCID as a whole cohort instead of specific genotypes [ , ]. Hence, we explored the long-term immuno-reconstitution, health outcome and QoL in IL7Rα SCID, Artemis and RAG1 and 2 SCID survivors’ post-HSCT in our center. These diseases were chosen as outcome for NK+ SCID that is less good than for NK- SCID, and we have previously published results on X-linked and JAK3-deficient SCID [ , ].
Methods
This was a retrospective longitudinal study of long-term outcome of post-HSCT SCID patients in a single center. IL7Rα SCID, Artemis and RAG1 and 2 SCID patients who were at least 2 years post-transplantation on January 2015 were identified from the database available in the BMT unit of the Great North Children’s Hospital, Newcastle upon Tyne. Patients and families consented to data collection at time of transplant. Clinico-immunological data were retrospectively collated. Immune reconstitution parameters, namely CD3+, CD19+, CD16/56+, CD4+, CD3 + CD4 + CD45RA+ (CD4+ naïve lymphocytes), were retrieved from the baseline before HSCT and at 5 yearly intervals post-HSCT. The markers CD3 + CD4 + CD45RA+ were used as surrogates for thymic output because these data were available for the early transplants, when other markers of naïve T lymphocytes were not available and they are a fair surrogate for thymopoiesis [ ]. Patients and families attending the Newcastle HSCT follow-up clinic were invited to complete PedsQL questionnaires and results were compared to published UK norms.
Descriptive analyses were performed for clinical outcome. All statistical analysis was performed using STATA 13. Longitudinal analyses of immune reconstitution trends post-HSCT were performed using multilevel mixed model analysis.
Results and Discussion
A total of 38 patients with a diagnosis of IL7Rα SCID (17 patients), Artemis SCID (8 patients) and RAG1/2 SCID (13 patients) were > 2 years post-HSCT by January 2015. The median age at the last follow-up for IL7Rα SCID was 14 years, range 4–27 and Artemis and RAG1/2 SCID was 10 years, range 2–18. A detailed description of conditioning regimens, donor type and outcome is listed in Electronic Table S1 .
There was sustained CD3+ lymphocyte output seen post-HSCT for both conditioned and unconditioned IL7Rα patients (Fig. 1 a). The longitudinal data of immune reconstitution for Artemis and RAG1/2 SCID were analyzed as a single group due to small number and as both have a T- B- NK+ SCID immuno-phenotype. Multilevel mixed effect model analysis demonstrated a significant difference in overall trend changes between conditioned and unconditioned recipients of Artemis and RAG1/2 SCID ( p = 0.004) (Fig. 1 b). The data for CD4+ naïve lymphocytes were only available up until 10 years post-HSCT for all SCID genotypes. The overall trend showed that the mean for CD4+ naïve lymphocyte output was higher in conditioned recipients of IL7Rα SCID, although not analyzed statistically due to small numbers of subjects (Fig. 1 c). The conditioned recipients of Artemis and RAG1/2 SCID had a significantly higher overall trend of CD4+ naïve lymphocyte compared to unconditioned recipients, p = 0.04 (Fig. 1 d). The finding of better thymopoiesis in the conditioned Artemis, RAG1/2 SCID and IL7Rα SCID patients supports the hypothesis of an association between host natural killer cells and permissive conditions in the marrow niche and that conditioning is a prerequisite for better donor stem cell engraftment post-HSCT in NK+ SCID phenotypes [ ]. Recent data suggest that NK cells in RAG deficiency have intrinsic abnormalities which may predispose them to rejection, and so conditioning in this group may be particularly important to achieve durable immune reconstitution [ ]. Furthermore, our study demonstrated sustained production of CD3+, CD4+ and CD4+ naïve lymphocytes, even until the third decade post-HSCT. This confirms previous findings showing that T lymphocyte production persists until adulthood [ , , , ]. Fig. 1 The longitudinal analysis of immune reconstitution post-transplant according to unconditioned vs conditioned recipients of IL7Rα, Artemis and RAG1/2 SCID. A comparison of trend changes with time was performed between conditioned and unconditioned recipients. a Mean CD3+ cells count for IL7Rα post-HSCT. There was no significant difference in the overall trend of circulating CD3+ lymphocyte numbers between conditioned and unconditioned recipients, p = 0.92. b CD3+ cells count for Artemis and RAG1/2 SCID. In the initial first year post-transplant, unconditioned recipients had a higher CD3+ lymphocyte count compared to conditioned recipients, and it was significant at 3 time points (baseline, p = 0.001, 6 months post-transplant, p = 0.003 and 1 year post-transplant, p = 0.02. However, after 5 years post-transplant, there was no significant difference in the CD3+ lymphocyte count between both groups (5 years post-transplant, p = 0.76 and 10 years post-transplant, p = 0.71). There was a significant difference in overall trend changes between conditioned and unconditioned recipients of Artemis and RAG1/2 SCID, ( p = 0.004). c Mean of CD4+ naïve cells count for IL7Rα. Comparison at each time point post-HSCT revealed a non-significantly higher mean CD4+ Naïve lymphocyte output in conditioned compared to unconditioned recipients. The unconditioned recipients’ mean CD4+ Naïve lymphocyte number was below 500 cells/μl from 1-year post-HSCT till 10-year post-HSCT. d Mean of CD4+ naïve cell count for Artemis and RAG 1/2 SCID post-HSCT. Conditioned Artemis and RAG1/2 SCID recipients had significantly higher CD4+ naïve lymphocyte numbers than unconditioned recipients across all time points post-transplant except at 10-year post-transplant. The CD4+ naïve lymphocyte trend remained low throughout time post-transplant for unconditioned recipients at a level of less than 200 cells/μl
Thirteen of 14 surviving IL7Rα patients (93%) (12 out of 14 were conditioned) were able to stop immunoglobulin replacement therapy—the patient remaining on immunoglobulin replacement therapy has significant bronchiectasis as a reason to continue, rather than B lymphocyte dysfunction. This compares favorably to Artemis (57%) and RAG 1/2 SCID (77%). More conditioned Artemis and RAG1/2 SCID recipients were free from immunoglobulin replacement therapy, (conditioned, 11 out of 13 patients, unconditioned, 1 out of 3 patients, p = ns). These data are confounded by the fact that 4 patients developed autoimmune hemolytic anemia, 2 of whom received rituximab for which one remains on immunoglobulin treatment. However, these data suggest that conditioning is vital for donor B lymphocyte reconstitution, chimerism and chances of freedom from immunoglobulin replacement therapy after HSCT in Artemis and RAG1/2 SCID, and support previous observations to that effect [ , , ]. As Artemis and RAG1/2 SCID patients do not have B lymphocytes, and the marrow and thymic niches are full of T and B lymphocyte precursors, a preparative regimen prior to HSCT is necessary to facilitate donor myeloid and B lymphocyte engraftment.
Many patients have ongoing medical issues at latest follow-up [IL7Rα (73%), Artemis (85%), RAG1/2 (55%)] (Table 1 ). Five IL7Rα SCID patients developed cutaneous warts, which may be related to the genetic diagnosis; further analysis showed no significant difference of mean NK values at latest follow-up, comparing those with warts versus those with none ( p = 0.40). No similar observation was seen in Artemis and RAG1/2 SCID survivors. The cutaneous warts in our IL7Rα SCID cohort were less severe and persistent when compared with those in the ILR2G/JAK3 SCID cohort [ ]. With regard to the preparative regimen, all conditioned Artemis SCID recipients experienced ongoing medical issues compared to 4 out of 7 conditioned RAG SCID patients, as previously described [ ]. The number of unconditioned Artemis and RAG SCID patients is too small for comparison; 1 of 2 unconditioned recipients has on-going medical issues for both genotypes. Major clinical issues in Artemis patients post-HSCT were dental issues with small, misshapen secondary dentation requiring extensive dental clearance (3 patients, 43%, all received busulfan), short stature (3 patients, 43%), post- transplant autoimmune hemolytic anemia (3 patients, 43%) and dermatological issues (3 patients, 43% vitiligo [ ], psoriasis [ ], eczema [ ]). No RAG1/2 SCID survivors had dental issues or hearing loss. Within this group is a spectrum of problems related to the underlying disease, possibly associated with the treatment approach, or due to incomplete immune reconstitution.

One of the most important outcome measures in this study was the objective measurement of quality of life. This is the only study that has examined the quality of life of survivors’ post-HSCT according to these specific SCID genotypes. Quality of life for SCID survivors was measured using PedsQL questionnaires and compared to the UK normal values [ ]. Total responders according to genotypes were IL7Rα SCID (11 out of 14 patients, 79%) and Artemis and RAG1/2 SCID (11 out of 16 patients, 69%). The median age of responders for IL7Rα SCID was 15 years (range, 6–27 years) and Artemis and RAG 1/2 SCID, 10 years (range 2–18). There was no significant difference noted between the mean scores of PedsQL of IL7Rα and Artemis and RAG1/2 SCID (both parent and child report).
Both IL7Rα SCID parents and patients reported no significant difference in the mean scores of all domains (Table 2 ). Ninety-three percent of IL7Rα SCID survivors in this cohort were free from immunoglobulin therapy, and they reported a normal quality of life. These findings may suggest freedom from immunoglobulin replacement therapy that is one of the factors associated with normal quality of life, as found in our previous analysis of patients with IL2Rγ- and JAK3-deficienct SCID.

Artemis and RAG1/2 SCID patients reported lower mean scores in the school domain in comparison to published normal values in the UK (Table 3 ). This is comparable to prior published findings where parents/carers of non-genotype-specific SCID cohort patients’ post-HSCT reported worse emotional and behavioral difficulties compared to a normal population [ ]. In view of this finding, it is important for SCID patients’ post-HSCT to be follow up lifelong so that early identification of any issues can be guaranteed.

Further analysis demonstrated both parents and children with Artemis and RAG1/2 SCID without ongoing medical issues reported no significant difference in all domains compared to the UK normal values. Artemis and RAG1/2 SCID patients with ongoing medical issues reported significantly lower mean scores in 2 domains, physical (72.3, p = 0.04) and school (60.8, p = 0.03). Freedom from ongoing medical issues was associated with normal quality of life as reported by both parents and patients of Artemis and RAG1/2 SCID. Thus, normal quality of life for SCID survivors’ post-HSCT can be achieved, and factors associated with this include no ongoing medical issues and immunoglobulin-independence.
As a summary, those with higher disease burden are more likely to report lower quality of life compared to those who did not have ongoing medical issues and are free from immunoglobulin replacement therapy, who have a normal quality of life. Although there were relatively small numbers of patients with numerous confounding covariables which precluded a multivariate analysis; nevertheless, this study highlighted the need for safer conditioning to minimize long-term side effects, but at the same time ensuring maximal engraftment and better immune reconstitution. These data highlight the importance of durable immunity, including B lymphocyte function, to patients’ well-being. Unfortunately, the best way of currently achieving that, with chemotherapy, can result in significant unwanted sequelae [ ]. Safer effective ways of securing myeloid engraftment but avoiding cytotoxic therapies are urgently needed [ ].
