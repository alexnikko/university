Introduction
Mangifera casturi ( Anacardiaceae ) is an endemic plant from South Kalimantan, Indonesia. It is called as mangga kasturi or mangga borneo in Indonesia, which has several applications in traditional medicine (Suhartono et al. ).
Chemical components from plants such as phenols, flavonoids, and terpenoids have shown a wide array of biological activities such as antioxidant, anticancer, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antidiabetic properties (George et al. ; Kakumu et al. ; Ahmad et al. ; Pardede et al. ).
The extract and chemical components from the bark and fruit of Mangifera indica showed antioxidant and aggressive activity against breast cancer cells (Rodeiro et al. ; Rivera et al. ; Afifa et al. ; Meneses et al. ). The crude extracts and isolated compounds from Mangifera pajang could be confirmed as anticancer, antimicrobial, and free radical scavenging agents (Ahmad et al. ). There are only a few phytochemical studies on M. casturi. The methanol extract and lupeol (terpenoid compound) of M. casturi fruit are reported as significant antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory activities (Suhartono et al. ; Sutomo and Rianto ; Fakhrudin et al. ). However, there has been no investigation on M. casturi bark. In this study, we isolated chemical components of M. casturi , then confirmed their antioxidative and antileukemic activity.
Material and methods
General experimental procedures
1 H and 13 C-NMR spectra were recorded on a JOEL ECA 600/400 spectrometer with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal standard. MS spectra were obtained using a JEOL JMS-700/GI spectrometer and the Waters UPLC-MS system (Aquity UPLC XevoQTof). Column chromatography (CC) was performed on a neutral silica gel (Silica Gel 60 N, spherical, neutral, 40–50 μm) (KANTO Chemical Co., Inc.). Preparative thin-layer chromatography (PTLC) was performed on silica gel 60 F 254 (1 mm layer thickness, Merck).
Plant material
The bark of M. casturi was collected from Pengaron, South Kalimantan, Indonesia.
Extraction and isolation of chemical components from bark of M. casturi
Dried bark of M. casturi (1 kg) was macerated with methanol at room temperature (3 × 2.5 L). The extract was filtered and evaporated in vacuo to yield methanol extract (95.4 g). The methanol extract was partitioned successively with n -hexane, ethyl acetate (EtOAc), and n -butanol ( n -BuOH) to yield n -hexane fraction (6.4 g), EtOAc fraction (23.0 g), and n -BuOH fraction (26.8 g).
A portion of EtOAc fraction (23.0 g) was separated by silica gel column chromatography (CC) eluted with n -hexane–EtOAc and EtOAc–MeOH, which yielded 15 fractions (E 1 –E 15 ). Fraction E 6 (4.0 g) was subjected to CC on silica gel ( n -hexane–EtOAc) (EtOAc–MeOH) in a stepwise manner (10/0 to 0/10) to give 10 subfractions (E 6.1 –E 6.10 ). Subfraction E 6.6 (2.1 g) was subjected to CC on silica gel eluted with CH 2 Cl 2 –CHCl 3 , then CHCl 3 –EtOAc to obtain eight subfractions (E 6.6.1 –E 6.6.8 ). Subfraction E 6.6.8 (15.0 mg) was further separated by preparative thin-layer chromatography (PTLC) ( n -hexane–EtOAc 3:7) to obtain compound 1 (10 mg). Subfraction E 6.6.5 (399 mg) was separated by PTLC (CHCl 3 :EtOAc 3:7) to obtain compound 2 (76 mg); subfraction of E 6.6.5 was further separated by PTLC (EtOAc 100%) to obtain compound 3 (12 mg). Subfraction E 6.6.7 (428.8 mg) was subjected to CC on silica gel eluted with CHCl 3 –EtOAc, then EtOAc–MeOH in a stepwise manner (10/0 to 0/10) to obtain compound 4 (136.1 mg). Fraction E 10 was subjected to CC on silica gel (CHCl 3 –MeOH) also in a stepwise manner of increasing polarity (10/0 to 0/10), yielding five fractions (E 10.1 –E 10.5 ). Compound 5 (140.8 mg) was isolated from fraction E 10.3 (646.2 mg) by re-crystallization.
A portion of n -hexane fraction (6.4 g) was subjected to CC on silica gel ( n -hexane–EtOAc) (EtOAc–MeOH) in a stepwise manner (10/0 to 0/10) to give six fractions (H 1 –H 6 ). Fraction H 4 (595 mg) was subjected to CC on silica gel ( n -hexane–EtOAc) to obtain compound 6 (54.2 mg).

Antioxidant activity
The antioxidant activity of fractions and isolated compounds from M. casturi bark was analyzed using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) method. The diluted working solutions of the fractions, isolated compounds, and trolox (positive control) were prepared in methanol. The final concentration of fractions and isolated compounds are 100 μg/mL and 10 μM, respectively. The reduction of the DPPH was followed by monitoring the decrease in absorbance (Abs) at 545 nm (Kato et al. ).
Antileukemic activity
CCK-8 assay : HL-60 cells were obtained from DS Pharma Biomedical Co., Ltd. (Osaka, Japan) and cultured in RPMI 1640 media (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% antibiotics, penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco®, Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., MA, USA). Cells were maintained at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 . Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) was purchased from Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Inc. (Kumamoto, Japan). The cells (2.5 × 10 4 cells/mL) were seeded in 96-well plates. After 24 h, sample solutions were added. Following 48-h incubation, CCK-8 solution (10 μL) was added and the plates were incubated for an additional 4 h. Visible absorption (490 nm) was measured using a microplate reader (Kakumu et al. ; Pardede et al. ).
UPLC-ESITOFMS
The samples were dissolved in DMSO/H 2 O (1/1) at 20 mg/mL and filtered through 0.45-μm membrane filter (ADVANTEC®, Japan), and an aliquot (5 μL) of the sample was injected in the ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC). Analysis was carried out by the Waters UPLC system (Aquity UPLC XevoQTof), using a UPLC BEH C 18 analytical column (1.7 μm, 2.1 × 100 mm). The mobile phase contained solvent A (1% v / v AcOH in distilled water) and solvent B (acetonitrile). The linear gradient system employed was 0–30 min for 90% solvent A to 70% solvent A and 10% solvent B to 30% solvent B, kept for 5 min, and 35–45 min for 70% solvent A to 50% solvent A and 30% solvent B to 50% solvent B. The column eluate was monitored at 260 nm UV absorbance. A negative mode was employed in ESITOFMS.
Result and discussion
Isolation of chemical components from bark of M. casturi
Five compounds were isolated from EtOAc fraction and one compound was isolated from n -hexane fraction, identified as methyl gallate ( 1 ), taxifolin ( 2 ), pyrocatechuic acid ( 3 ), gallic acid ( 4 ), glucogallin ( 5 ), and β-sitosterol ( 6 ), respectively (Fig. 1 ).

Antioxidant and antileukemic activity
The methanol extract of M. casturi bark was partitioned successively with n -hexane, EtOAc, and n -BuOH. Antioxidant and antileukemic activities of each fraction were evaluated. EtOAc fraction had the highest antioxidant activity (96.4%), which also showed the highest activity against human leukemia HL-60 with a cell survival rate of 52.6%. Furthermore, isolated compounds confirmed both the antioxidant and antileukemic activity.
The hydroxyl groups are important for free radical scavenging efficiency. In particular, the hydroxyl group at the para -position to the carboxylic group appears essential to maintain the scavenging activity (Lu et al. ); based on these data, gallic acid ( 4 ) showed high antioxidant activity when compared to pyrocatechuic acid ( 3 ). Furthermore, an additional methyl or glucose group into a carboxylic moiety decreases antioxidant activity. This can be seen in gallic acid ( 4 ) when compared with methyl gallate ( 1 ) and glucogallin ( 5 ), indicating that the presence of methyl or glucose moiety reduces antioxidant activity (Fig. 2 ). Fig. 2 Antioxidant activity of isolated compounds from bark of Mangifera casturi (Means ± SEMs, n = 3, 10 μM). Methyl gallate ( 1 ), taxifolin ( 2 ), pyrocatechuic acid ( 3 ), gallic acid ( 4 ), glucogallin ( 5 ), and β-sitosterol ( 6 )
In flavonoids, the C2–C3 double bond with a 4-oxo functional group in the C ring is responsible for its antioxidant activity; this is through electron delocalization from the B ring. The antioxidant activity of taxifolin ( 2 ) is 57.5% because it lacks the C2–C3 double bond, although taxifolin ( 2 ) has potential for maximum radical scavenging activity in the 3- and 5-hydroxyl group in A and C ring (Dai and Mumper ).
We evaluated the antileukemic activity of isolated compounds against HL-60 cells using the CCK-8 assay method. The isolated compounds, methyl gallate ( 1 ), taxifolin ( 2 ), pyrocatechuic acid ( 3 ), gallic acid ( 4 ), glucogallin ( 5 ), and β-sitosterol ( 6 ) at a final concentration of 50 μM, exhibited a cell survival rate of 37.5, 97.0, 58.8, 9.75, 57.3, and 93.2%, respectively, shown in Fig. 3 . Fig. 3 Antileukemic activity of isolated compounds from bark of Mangifera casturi (Means ± SEMs, n = 6, 50 μM). Methyl gallate ( 1 ), taxifolin ( 2 ), pyrocatechuic acid ( 3 ), gallic acid ( 4 ), glucogallin ( 5 ), and β-sitosterol ( 6 )
Comparing literature data, the cell survival rate of quercetin was 29.7% (Kakumu et al. ) and that of taxifolin ( 2 ) was 97.0% in human leukemia HL-60 cells; it was observed that the structure of quercetin and taxifolin ( 2 ) was similar; the major difference was the absence of C2–C3 double bond in the structure of taxifolin ( 2 ). This makes it ineffective against human leukemia HL-60 cells (Rusak et al. ).
The addition of a methyl and glucose group to the carboxylic moiety of gallic acid decreased its antileukemic activity (Kakumu et al. ). Gallic acid ( 4 ) strongly inhibited the cell proliferation with a cell survival rate of 9.71%, when compared with methyl gallate ( 1 ) (37.5%) and glucogallin ( 5 ) (57.3%).
UPLC-ESITOFMS analysis
Analysis of the chemical components from EtOAc fraction of M. casturi bark was carried out using UPLC-ESITOFMS. The chemical components were assigned as [M-H] − ions in Fig. 4 . The retention time of each compound in the EtOAc fraction was assigned 5.23, 5.74, 11.05, 15.72, and 21.95 min for glucogallin ( 5 ), gallic acid ( 4 ), pyrocatechuic acid ( 3 ), methyl gallate ( 1 ), and taxifolin ( 2 ), respectively.

Conclusions
In summary, methyl gallate ( 1 ), taxifolin ( 2 ), pyrocatechuic acid ( 3 ), gallic acid ( 4 ), glucogallin ( 5 ), and β-sitosterol ( 6 ) were isolated from bark of M. casturi for the first time. The antioxidant and antileukemic activities of isolated compounds were evaluated. The presence and position of hydroxyl, methyl, and glucose group in the isolated compounds affect their antioxidant and antileukemic activities. M. casturi bark is a good source of gallic acid and the derivatives.
