INTRODUCTION
In recent years, schizophrenia has become a social issue of great concern, and lots of relevant drugs have been approved into the market to remedy this disease. However, a part of drug molecule entities coming from the discovery is poor solubility, which can lead to a bad internal bioavailability eventually ( , , , ). Numerous preparation techniques have been used to improve the aqueous solubility of insoluble drugs such as nanocrystal technology ( ), self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system (SNEDDS) ( ) and solid dispersion made by anti-solvent method ( ). But many researches have shown that these formulation techniques still reveal some negative effect. For example, SNEDDS, mixing the oil, surfactant, and co-surfactant together at a suitable temperature in an air-bath oscillator until appearing a transparent system ( ), is a new solubilization approach, which leads to bad oral compliance and stabilization. Nanocrystal technology is a popular approach used to overcome poor water solubility because it is a simple way to add the specific surface area of a drug crystal, whereas this preparation technique also presents poor stability problem. As a result, these drawbacks will make a challenge to drug’s transportation and storage ( , , ). Thus, we attempt to use hot-melt extrusion (HME) technology combined with appropriate thermoplastic polymer preparing solid dispersion formulation to dismiss these weak points.
HME is a dust- and solvent-free continuous process, which uniformly mixes the drug and pharmaceutic excipients into the stuffing bucket when the temperature reached the set value ( ). Through a die under high temperature and pressure, mixtures are formed into the shape of a stick or films, and smashed in the shredder until suitable-sized powder particles ( , ). Finally, the powder can be made into capsules, tablets, coating formulations, and etc. ( , ). Compared with all preparation technologies mentioned above, HME has lots of advantages. The HME method can not only improve the dissolution of API but also increase bioavailability of drug ( ). At the same time, this technology can avoid the introduction of organic impurities fundamentally due to its solvent-free continuous process ( ). Furthermore, the preparation process takes less time and effort compared with other technology. At last, HME technology can be easily used in the industrial production owing to its process controllability and continuity ( , ).
Ziprasidone hydrochloride (ZH), a second-generation atypical drug, is widely used in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder owing to its well-tolerance (Fig. 1 ). It is commercially marketed as Geodon® in the USA and as Zeldox® in the other parts of world ( , ). ZH has a low aqueous solubility (2.133 mg/L at 25°C in the water) and a high permeability (logP value at about 4.00), which also means ZH is a lipophilic drug. Therefore, it is classified as a class II drug according to the biopharmaceutical classification system (BSC). Relevant clinical study reveals that the oral absolute bioavailability of ZH in fed state is twice as much as that in fasted state. As a result, the administration of Zeldox® with food is considered vital to ensure a reliable bioavailability which can control symptoms of patient effectively. The reason is that the absorption of ZH depends on its solubility, taking a high-fat diet will stimulate the small intestine to secrete large amounts of digestive enzymes and bile that have the function of surfactant which can destroy the crystal lattice of drug easily. Under fasted state, absorption of ZH decreases to 30% resulting from no more surfactants and energy raising the soluble behavior. In addition, reduced oral absorption of ZH in fasted state cannot be simply made up for increasing the prescribed dose ( , , , ). Fig. 1 Structural formula of ziprasidone hydrochloride
Based on the HME technology, our study chooses ZH as the model drug and selects a suitable polymer as the carrier to prepare solid dispersion. To overcome the drawbacks of ZH, Plasdone-S630, a synthetic polymer of 1-vinly-2- pyrrolidone and vinyl acetate in the ratio of 60:40, is chosen as the drug carrier. It has been used in pharmaceutical formulations for decades as table binder and film former. In recent years, Plasdone-S630 can be used to improve the solubility and enhance the bioavailability of poorly soluble drug. Furthermore, Plasdone-S630 has a relatively low glass temperature (Tg = 106°C) compared to other plasdone products. These advantages make it have a wide application in hot-melt extrusion technology. But the limitation of Plasdone-S630 is its hygroscopicity, which weaken the stability of solid dispersion in humid environments ( , , ). For this reason, another carrier with stabilizing effects is considered. HPMCAS-HF is a commonly used hot-melt extrusion carrier, enteric-coating agent, and film-forming agents. It is important that the aliphatic hydroxyl groups of the natural cellulose and synthetic 2-hydroxypropoxyl groups can provide hydrogen bond to API with hydrogen bond accepting groups, which can prevent drug particles from gathering spontaneously. This character is conducive to the formation of stable solid dispersions. Meanwhile, HPMCAS-HF also plays a role of coated blockers in vivo , which extending the absorption time of the drugs in intestine that is of great help to improve the bioavailability of poorly soluble drugs ( , ).
In this study, in order to enhance the oral bioavailability and reduce the food effect, ZH-SD was prepared by HME method with a suitable setting parameter. The ratio of excipients in preparation process was optimized by the central composite design (CCD) of response surface methodology. Its physical characteristics were researched by power X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier transform infrared, and scanning electron microscopy. To evaluate the superiority of formulation, the dissolution study in vitro was carried out in four different media. In addition, via an in vivo study of beagle dogs, the pharmacokinetics parameters of ZH-SD using commercial formulation (Zeldox®) as reference in fasted and fed state, were performed to evaluate whether this in-house formulation have achieved the desired target.
MATERIALS AND METHOLDS
Materials
ZH was obtained from Nhwa Pharmaceutical Company (Jiangsu, China). Plasdone-S630, N-linear copolymer of vinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) with vinyl acetate (VA), was provided by ISP Technologies, Inc. Hypromellose acetate succinate (HPMCAS-HF) was supplied by Shin-Etsu Chemical Co. (Tokyo, Japan). Soluplus (which is also known as polyethylene caprolactam poly(vinyl acetate) polyethylene glycol graft copolymer) was received from BASF Chemical Co. (Ludwigshafen, Germany). All other reagents, chemicals, and solvents employed were of analytical grade and purchased from commercial suppliers.
METHODS
Comparison of Properties of Polymers
Film Forming Analysis
Film forming study was carried out by adding a certain amount of ZH to various polymers (Eudragit EPO, Plasdone-S630, HPMCAS-HF, PVP-K30 and Soluplus). Several polymers and ZH were separately brought together into eggplant-type bottles in a certain amount and proportion. Polymer/ZH ratios were 1:1, 1:3, and 1:5 ( w / w ). The mixture of polymer/ZH were dissolved in 50 mL methanol and evaporated in a rotary evaporator at 65 ± 0.5°C (RE-2000A Rotary Evaporator, Yarong biochemical instrument factory, Shanghai, China). When methanol was about to evaporate and gradate from transparent to milky, the remaining liquid was poured on the surface of a transparent glass plate, and the glass plate was dried at 60°C for 6 h in vacuum drying chamber until a total dry. Surface characters of film such as transparency, smoothness, and graininess can be used to evaluate the quality of film formation.
Solubility Studies
Based on the result of film forming analysis, we determined the appropriate polymer/ZH ratio (1:3). Each polymer was prepared into a solid dispersion and a physical mixture, respectively. The sample in water was overdosed and stirred for 48 h at 37 ± 0.5°C. The resulting liquid was filtered via 0.45-μm filter, and the concentration of drug in the water was determined by HPLC method mentioned below.
Chromatographic Conditions
The concentration of ZH was determined by a HPLC method based on Waters, which consisted of a Waters 1525 HPLC pump, Waters 2489 UV detector, and Waters 2707 autosampler. A Baseline® C18 reverse phase column (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) was used as a fixed phase. The mobile phase consisted of 0.05 mol/L KH 2 PO 4 (pH = 6.5 ± 0.01) and acetonitrile (45:55, v / v ), and its flow rate was determined at 1.5 mL/min. The column temperature was set at 40°C. Three hundred fifteen nanometers was used as the detection wavelength of the UV detector, and the volume of sample injection was 20 μL. Breeze 2 software was installed to analyze the data.
Preparation of Solid Dispersion
The polymers were sieved by 80 standard test mesh screen and transferred to a vacuum drying oven at 40°C for 12 h to remove excess water. Then, the polymers and the ZH were mixed into premix well; when the extrusion temperature of the hot-melt extruder reached the set point, the premix was equably packed through the feeding funnel into twin-screw extruder machine (ATS Nanotechnology” Co., Ltd., Suzhou, China). Different areas had their specific temperature, from the packing zone, mixing zone, melting zone, to molding zone, whose temperature successively was 150, 155, 160, and 165°C. The screw speed was adjusted to 60 rpm. When strip extrusion cooled to ambient temperature, extrudate was milled using comminuting mill until the particles can easily pass through 60 standard test mesh screen. Finally, the corresponding ziprasidone hydrochloride physical mixture (ZH-PM) with the same prescription and dosage like ZH-SD were well mixed for the following contract experiment.
Experimental Design
The experiment was designed based on CCD, which was used to optimize the proportion of HPMCAS-HF and Plasdone-S630 in the formulation. The milled ZH solid dispersion powder was mixed with Ac-Di-Sol, MCC pH-102, and magnesium stearate. Using single-punch tablet press, mixed powder was directly pressed into solid dispersible tablets, and the weight was controlled from 3 to 4 kg or so. Ac-Di-Sol played a role of disintegrating agent, MCC pH -102 were kept as stuffing bulking agent and diluent in tablets. The composition of the formulation is presented in Table I . The proportions of HPMCAS-HF and Plasdone-S630 are shown in Table II , and its 13 experimental trials were produced by CCD. Plasdone-S630 (X 1 ) and HPMCAS-HF (X 2 ) were selected as response variables. Design-Expert.V8.0.6.1 software was utilized to design the experiment.

Prescription Screening Test
Each experimental formulation was made into solid dispersion tablets, and the cumulative dissolution of drugs in 10-min study was analyzed by dissolution tester (Huanghai Instrument company, Shanghai, China), using paddle method with a speed of 75 rpm in 900 mL pH 6.8 PBS medium. Then, the data was recorded for comparison.
The formulations were analyzed for drug content with HPLC method depicted in “ Chromatographic Conditions .”
PXRD
The crystalline state of ZH in different samples was examined via powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) with a Cu-Kα radiation diffractometer (Bruker AXS, Germany). The X-ray source was operated at 40 kV and 40 mA. The samples of ZH, Plasdone-S630, HPMCAS-HF, and ZH-SD were collected from 2θ of 5°–60° with a scanning speed of 0.5°/s and a step size of 0.02°.
FTIR
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy investigations were obtained using a FTIR spectrometer (Thermo Fisher IS, USA). The samples of ZH, Plasdone-S630, HPMCAS-HF, ZH-PM, and ZH-SD were prepared by potassium bromide and scanned in the region of 400–4000/cm.
SEM
The surface morphology of ZH, ZH-PM, and ZH-SD was examined through a scanning electron microscope (Phenom Desktop SEM PW-100-011, Netherlands). The gold coated on the surface of sample and finally formed a conductive coating under an argon atmosphere.
In vitro Dissolution Study
The optimized ZH-SD formulation was screened by 3 2 central composite designs of response surface methodology, and its specific prescription composition and content are shown in Table II . The dissolution studies of ZH-SD, ZH-PM, and Zeldox® (all those formulations contained 20 mg ziprasidone) were conducted based on Chinese Pharmacopoeia type III apparatus (Huanghai Instrument company, Shanghai, China), using basket method and paddle method, at a medium temperature of 37 ± 0.5°C with a rotation rate of 75 rpm. Four 900-mL dissolution media (pH 1.2 HCl medium, pH 4.5 acetate buffered medium, pH 6.8 PBS, and pure water) were selected to research drug release profiles. Moreover, the sampling times are as follows: 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 60, 90, and 120 min. At the specified times, 5 mL dissolution liquid was taken out, and the same volume of spare solution (37 ± 0.5°C) was added into the vessels to maintain the total volume. Then, the digestion liquor was filtered through the membrane (0.45 μm; PALL) and analyzed by HPLC method described in “ Chromatographic Conditions .” All the experiments were repeated in triplicate.
Stability Study
The optimized ZH-SD could be stored in the normal storage condition for a long time; its drug content and release profiles should not have an obvious change compared to initial features. In a stability chamber at 40°C and 75% relative humidity (RH), the samples (Plasdone-S630-alone formulation and optimized ZH-SD formulation) were stored for 6 months. After that, the drug content of the samples was conducted as follows: precisely weighing 135 mg samples which were stored for 6 months and diluted it with methanol. The solution was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min to separate the insoluble matters. Then, the supernatant was filtered by 0.22-μm membrane; finally, the drug content was detected by HPLC method mentioned above. The drug release profiles were tested in pH 6.8 PBS medium, and the samples have been studied by the contrast experiments. All the experiments were repeated in triplicate.
The similarity factor, f 2 , could be recommended to evaluate the similarity of release profiles between the test preparation and reference preparation in different dissolution medium. The relevant equation was as follows (Eq. ( 1 )): $$ {f}_2=50\log \left[\frac{100}{\sqrt{1+\left(\left({\sum}_{i=1}^n{\left({R}_t-{T}_t\right)}^2\right)/n\right)}}\right] $$ (1) where R and T represented the cumulative dissolution of drug of the reference preparation and the test preparation at the specified time point, respectively. The n stood for the number of sampling time points. The values of f 2 ranged from 0 to 100. When the f 2 > 50, the drug release profiles were considered to be similar.
Pharmacokinetic Studies in Beagle Dogs
The pharmacokinetic study described here was approved by the Nanjing Medical University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (No. 20141115) and adhered to the “Principles of laboratory Animal Care.” The in vivo pharmacokinetics study of ZH-SD tablet and commercial formulation Zeldox® (both of them containing 20 mg ziprasidone) was tested by adopting 4 × 4 crossover Williams experimental design under fasted and fed states. Eight beagle dogs were randomly divided into four groups. Each group consisted of a male and a female ( ).
Beagle dogs were fasted for 12 h before the pharmacokinetics test. In the fasted studies, dogs were dosed and immediately given 50 mL tap water via an oral gavage. In the fed studies, dogs that have fed high calorie fat breakfast in advance were also dosed and quickly given 50 mL tap water by oral gavage. Four milliliters of blood samples were gathered from the forelimb of dog to 5 mL sodium heparin tubes at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18, and 24 h, and then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min in high-speed centrifuge. One milliliter of supernatant plasma was collected using a pipette into 10-mL centrifuge tubes and stored at − 80°C in a freezer until assayed.
The plasma samples were processed using the following procedure. The centrifuge tube containing the plasma was removed from the freezer, when the temperature of samples reached the room temperature until melted, 100 μL clozapine, the internal standards, was added into 1 mL plasma, then shaken it up by vortex mixer for 10 s. Next, 5 mL ethyl acetate was poured into 10-mL centrifuge tubes, and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 3 min under − 5°C to precipitate the proteins. The supernatant layer was evaporated by organomation until total dry, the residue was redissolved in 100 μL mobile phase, and 20 μL of the resulting solution was analyzed by HPLC. A Baseline® C18 reverse phase column (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) was used as fixed phase. The mobile phase was consisted of 0.03 mol/L ammonium acetate and methanol/acetonitrile (1:1) (65:35, v / v ); its flow rate was determined at 1.0 mL/min. The column temperature was set at 35°C. Two hundred fifty-four nanometers was used as the detection wavelength of the UV detector, and the injection volume of sample was 20 μL. The pharmacokinetic parameters were analyzed by noncompartment model with the drug and statistics (DAS) 2.1.1 software.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Optimization and Preparation of the Formulation
Film Forming Analysis
The comparative experiment results of Eudragit EPO, Plasdone-S630, HPMCAS-HF, PVP-K30, and Soluplus are depicted in Table III . Eudrogit EPO and PVP-K30 presented a bad film forming to ZH in any ratio of polymer to drug. On the contrary, Plasdone-S630 and Soluplus had well film forming property and scarcely any granular sensation. When the ratio of HPMCAS-HF and drug was over 1:1, film forming property also became better. It means that the amount of HPMCAS-HF should be not less than drug.

Solubilization Effect
A study of solubilization was carried out under supersaturated condition in order to pick out a polymer that had the best solubilization effect. The ZH-SD formulation using HME method should have a good dispersion function for drug release. Figure 2 reveals the solubility of ZH in various single-carrier formulations such as Plasdone-S630, Soluplus, and HPMCAS-HF. In general, ZH showed a higher solubility in solid dispersion formulation when compared to the physical mixture formulation. Among solid dispersion formulations, the best solubility of ziprasidone were exhibited in Plasdone-S630 formulation, and Soluplus formulation taken second place. Considering long-term stability, we chose HPMCAS-HF as the second carrier to improve the stability of solid dispersion. Fig. 2 Polymer solubilization effect comparison. Data are expressed as mean ± SD ( n = 3)
Formulation Optimization
A total of 13 experiments were employed to analyze the effect of various ratio of Plasdone-S630 and HPMCAS-HF on formulation’s cumulative dissolution of drugs in 10 min (Q 10 ) and drug content (DC). On the basis of experimental designs (Table II ), the software generated the relevant polynomial equation (Eqs. 2 and 3 ) $$ {\mathrm{Q}}_{10}=52.4+7.57{X}_1+9.73{X}_2+1.5{X}_1{X}_2-0.95{X_1}^2-2.45{X_2}^2 $$ (2) $$ \mathrm{DC}=99.87-0.037{X}_1+0.012{X}_2-7.625\times {10}^{-3}{X_1}^2-0.015{X_2}^2 $$ (3)
X 1 and X 2 respectively represented Plasdone-S630 and HPMCAS-HF. The model F -value of 63.75 and 26.87 implied that the model was significant. “Adeq Precision” measured the signal to noise ratio. A ratio was desirable (greater than 4). The ratio of 25.520 and 15.616 indicated an adequate signal. Two models could be used to navigate the design space. Therefore, Q 10 and DC could describe the data and calculate the optimal formulation ( , ).
Based on the Design-Expert software, the 3D respond surfaces and contour plots are presented in Fig. 3 . As shown in Fig. 3 a, b, with the increase of additive amount of Plasdone-S630 and HPMCAS-HF, Q 10 exhibited a sustained increase tendency, this result could be explained by the fact that more additive amount of hybrid polymer was added in the ZH-SD formulation, which got a better dispersibility to ZH raw material. Additionally, drug dissolution could be improved by HME thermal treatment, which could make the drug under high energy state that contributed to improve the aqueous solubility of drug. Fig. 3 Response surface graphs depicting the effects of the proportion of Plasdone-s630 and HPMCAS-HF on the cumulative dissolution of drugs in 10 min (Q 10 ) and drug content (DC)
From the response surface of DC (Fig. 3 c), when the value of Plasdone-S630 was 50 mg, a trend could be clearly seen that the higher value of HPMCAS-HF was, the higher DC was. On the contrary, when the value of HPMCAS-HF was fixed, with the increase of the value of Plasdone-S630, the DC had an increase tendency. Corresponding contour plot (Fig. 3 d) also clearly depicted the fact that higher content of HPMCAS-HF could control drug content with a high level ( ).
The optimum formulation of ZH-SD was selected by numerical function of optimization software and shown in Fig. 3 e, f. Final composition of ZH-SD formulation was 56.66 mg of Plasdone-S630 and 59.18 mg of HPMCAS-HF.
PXRD
As shown in Fig. 4 , crystalline ZH displayed its sharp crystalline peaks at diffraction angles (7°, 10.7°, 14.9°, 18.1°, 19°, 21.5°, 24.5°, 26°, 28.7°), indicating its bulk crystalline structure. From the diffractogram of the Plasdone-S630 and HPMCAS-HF, without any distinct peaks presented in spectra owing to its amorphous nature. The crystalline peaks of ZH were shown in the diffractogram of ZH-SD, manifesting that there was no evident change in the ZH crystalline structure, but the quantity and intensity of crystalline peaks were reduced when compared with ZH raw material. This indicated that ZH were scattered around the polymers equally with a low crystallinity hydrochloride form. Fig. 4 PXRD spectra of ZH, Plasdone-S630, HPMCAS-HF, and ZH-SD
FTIR
The FTIR spectra of ZH raw material, Plasdone-S630, HPMCAS-HF, ZH-PM, and ZH-SD at 4000–500/cm wavenumber are revealed in Fig. 5 . ZH (a) displayed the characteristic peaks at 3413/cm (N–H), 1713/cm (C=O), and 738/cm (Ar–Cl); its specific peaks of amide bond (3413/cm and 1713/cm) disappeared in ZH-SD. Compared to the curve of Plasdone-S630 (b), the characteristic peaks of Plasdone-S630 at 3500/cm and 1000/cm (ring amide groups) has vanished from the curve of ZH-SD (e), and HPMCAS-HF (c) at 1100/cm also disappeared from the curve of ZH-SD (e). These phenomena suggested that hydrogen bonds had formed between the amino group and the carbonyl group during the process of hot-melt extrusion. This intermolecular force could prevent the drug from spontaneously aggregating for a long time.

SEM
Figure 6 displays the morphology of ZH raw material, ZH-PM and ZH-SD. ZH crystalline particles with the size ranging from 5 to 20 μm clearly distributed in Fig. 6 a, b, and its shape is like bar or noodle. As we can see from Fig. 6 c, d, ZH-PM sample showed a relatively few drug particles, and some of them were marked by arrow. However, we cannot find out any ZH crystal particles except ZH-SD large particles from Fig. 6 e, f. It is also confirmed that ZH particles were well wrapped in the polymers via hot-melt extrusion process. Fig. 6 SEM of morphology and distribution of ZH ( a , b ), ZH-PM ( c , d ), and ZH-SD ( e , f )
In vitro Dissolution Study
The dissolution behaviors of ZH-PM, ZH-SD, and Zeldox® in four different media are shown in Fig. 7 . Owing to a bad aqueous solubility of ZH, 0.1% SDS was added to the media for improving drug dissolution. Approximately 53%, 26%, 45%, and 46% of drug released from ZH-PM (Fig. 7 a) for 120 min in pH 1.2 HCl media, pH 4.5 NaAc-HAc media, pH 6.8 PBS media, and water, respectively. However, the release profiles of ZH-SD formulation are shown in Fig. 7 b. Eighty-six percent, 89%, 95%, and 97% of drugs were successively dissolved in four dissolution media, which indicated that HME method as well as the polymer play a key role in promoting the dissolution of drug. Compared to other three dissolution media, the rate of drug release is relatively slow in pH 1.2 HCl media. This phenomenon could be explain by adding HPMCAS-HF in the formulation which formed an enteric coated layer binding on the surface of part of drug and led to a slow drug release rate under acidic condition. Correspondingly, the dissolution rate of ZH-SD in alkaline medium (pH 6.8 PBS and water) was remarkably exceeded than that of drug in acidic medium. Figure 7 c exhibited the release profiles of Zeldox® (commercial formulation); the cumulative dissolution of the commercial formulation in four different media was lower than the ZH-SD formulation. It was 59% in pH 1.2 HCl media, 79% in pH 4.5 NaAc-HAc media, 54% in pH 6.8 PBS media, and 74% in water, respectively. In terms of overall dissolution performance, the ZH-SD formulation was superior to ZH-PM and Zeldox® in vitro dissolution.

Stability Study
The stability study of the samples was evaluated by whether characteristics such as drug content and release profiles in pH 6.8 PBS medium have been changed after 6 months of storage. The drug content of two samples (initial formulation and 6 months later formulation) are shown in Fig. 8 Compared to the initial sample, the drug content of optimized ZH-SD formulation had no apparent change after being stored for 6 months. On the contrary, Plasdone-S630-alone formulation was not able to maintain the drug content in a negligible range. This result indicted that Plasdone-S630-alone formulation could not keep ZH raw material in a steady state. Fig. 8 Drug content changes of ZH-SD and Plasdone-S630-alone formulation after 6 months (means ± SD, n = 3)
The release profiles of both the samples were depicted in Fig. 9 a. The f 2 value of initial formulation and 6 months later formulation was 68.8 (> 50), which means that the release profile of treated sample was similar to the initial release profile. However, as shown in Fig. 9 b, release profiles of Plasdone-S630-alone formulation exhibited a large gap between initial and after storage, with a low f 2 value (24.1). The conclusion could be drawn that HPMCAS-HF in Plasdone-S630-based solid dispersion has the ability to suppress the crystallization growth and enhance the stability of ZH ( ).

Pharmacokinetics in Beagle Dogs
In order to investigate whether the optimum formulation of ZH-SD could improve the oral bioavailability of ZH in vivo , the corresponding pharmacokinetics study was carried on beagle dogs. The plasma concentration–time profiles of Zeldox® capsule (reference, 20 mg ziprasidone) and ZH-SD tablets (test, 20 mg ziprasidone) in fed and fasted state are depicted in Fig. 10 . Respectively, the pharmacokinetic parameters are summarized in Table IV . Fig. 10 The plasma concentration–time profiles of Zeldox ® (reference) and ZH-SD tablets (test) in fed and fasted state.

From concentration–time curve, we found that the plasma concentration of drug from Zeldox® increased rapidly and reached the top value at 2.2 ± 0.2 h, but it decreased quickly at a short time. Furthermore, there was a significant difference between fed and fasted state in beagle dogs after oral Zeldox® capsules, and approximately twofold plasma drug concentration difference was presented in it. The reason is that high energy fat meal could supply organism enough energy to destroy lattice energies of ZH and then largely increased the drug solubility. According to the results of ZH-SD tablets, no significant difference exist in the plasma concentration–time profiles between fed and fasted state, which include C max , T 1/2 , and AUC. Compared to the concentration–time curve of reference formulation, the test formulation presented an obvious improvement in the values of C max and AUC in fasted state. This advance largely improved oral bioavailability of ZH in fasted state. Maybe it was that Soluplus as a function of surfactant has an effect of solubilizing drugs in vivo , and its function was similar to the action of bile and catalytic enzymes that massively secreted in the fed state ( , ). It was worthwhile to note that the AUC and C max of ZH-SD were similar between the fasted and fed state, which indicate basically no food effect of ZH absorption. It can be explained by the theory that HPMCAS-HF as a prolong actions in intestinal tract enhanced ZH’s oral bioavailability. In a word, the pharmacokinetics study in vivo indicated that the optimized ZH-SD formulation successfully enhanced oral bioavailability in fasted state with no food effect.
CONCLUSIONS
In this study, Plasdone-S630 and HPMCAS-HF were used as a mixed polymer carriers to prepare the ZH-SD by hot-melt extrusion method. The optimized formulation was selected by central composite design. It presented a wonderful drug dispersion and interaction force between drug and polymers; this result was verified by a series of characterization such as PXRD, FTIR, and SEM. In four dissolution media, the dissolution of ZH-SD was superior to ZH-PM and Zeldox® which indicated that ZH solubility in various pH of aqueous media has been improved by the HME method. The pharmacokinetics study confirmed that food has no clear effect on the absorption of ZH-SD between fed and fasted state. Its bioavailability was twofold higher than the commercial Zeldox® capsules in fasted state. Moreover, ZH-SD has a good stability in normal storage condition for a long time, and it also could be easily industrially produced, owing to the controllability and reproducibility by hot-melt extrusion technology.
