Highlights
There is still uncertainty about the optimal usage of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) thrombolysis for acute pulmonary embolisms (PEs). In the present real-world registry in Japan, a high proportion of patients received t-PA thrombolysis, and a large proportion of patients receiving t-PA thrombolysis had mild PEs. t-PA thrombolysis was associated with a significantly lower adjusted mortality risk, although the benefit was not significant in patients with mild PEs. t-PA thrombolysis was associated with a significantly higher adjusted risk for major bleeding. We should pay more attention to the optimal usage of thrombolysis for acute PEs.
Introduction
Venous thromboembolisms (VTEs), including pulmonary embolisms (PEs) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT), are a major health problem around the world [ ]. An acute PE is the most serious clinical presentation of VTEs and is associated with high mortality rates (8.7 to 17.4% at 3 months) [ , ]. Most PE-related deaths occur in the acute phase, which largely depend on the clinical severity at presentation, including hemodynamic instability [ ]. Anticoagulation therapy is the standard treatment of acute PEs. However, thrombolysis aiming to directly dissolve thrombi could be an additional treatment option for patients with a high-risk of mortality. Actually, thrombolysis is reported to rapidly improve hemodynamic instability [ ], and reduce the mortality of high-risk patients with hemodynamic instability [ , ]. However, there is concern about the increased risk of bleeding associated with thrombolysis, and there is still uncertainty about the optimal usage of thrombolysis.
A recent large randomized clinical trial showed that thrombolysis did not reduce the mortality and increased major bleeding events in intermediate-high-risk patients with PEs, however, it prevented hemodynamic decompensation, suggesting that thrombolysis might be a good treatment option for high-risk patients with hemodynamic instability, but not for other patients [ ]. Considering the increased bleeding risk with full doses of thrombolytic agents, reduced doses of thrombolytic agents might be a safer alternative for patients with PEs [ ]. However, the optimal indication as well as the optimal doses of thrombolysis remains a matter of active debate, leading to the widely varying use patterns of thrombolysis in daily clinical practice. Therefore, we sought to evaluate the prevalence and prognostic impact of thrombolysis for acute PEs using a large Japanese observational database of PEs in the real world.
Methods
Study population
The COMMAND VTE (COntemporary ManageMent AND outcomes in patients with Venous ThromboEmbolism) Registry is a physician-initiated, multicenter retrospective cohort study that enrolled consecutive patients with acute symptomatic VTEs that were objectively confirmed by imaging examinations or autopsy among 29 centers in Japan between January 2010 and August 2014. The design of the registry was previously reported in detail [ , , ]. The relevant review boards or ethics committees in all 29 participating centers (Online Resource Appendix 1) approved the research protocol. We searched the hospital databases for clinical diagnoses and imaging examinations, and enrolled consecutive patients who met the definition of an acute symptomatic VTE diagnosed within 31 days from the symptom onset during the study period [ ]. The symptoms of PEs were defined as follows: sudden onset of dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, substernal chest pain, cough, fever, hemoptysis, and syncope [ , ]. Additionally, sudden onset abnormalities in the vital signs such as a decrease in the arterial oxygen saturation and hypotension were also regarded as symptoms of a PE. The presence or absence of symptoms was evaluated at the time of the imaging studies.
We enrolled 3027 consecutive patients with acute symptomatic VTEs after screening 19,634 consecutive patients with suspected VTEs for eligibility through chart reviews by the responsible physicians at each institution. There were 1715 patients with acute PEs after excluding 1312 patients with DVTs only. We excluded 161 patients who received thrombolysis with urokinase, because monteplase, a tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), was the only on-label thrombolytic drug for PEs in Japan, and urokinase might not have been used for PEs in some of these patients. We also excluded two patients who received thrombolysis with t-PA for DVTs and three patients who received unknown thrombolytic agents. Finally, the present study population consisted of 1549 patients with acute PEs who received t-PA thrombolysis (N = 180, 12%), or those who did not receive thrombolysis (N = 1369, 88%) (Fig. 1 ).

Definitions of the severity of PEs and doses of t-PA
PEs were classified into the following four groups according to the clinical severity: (1) cardiac arrest/collapse PEs; (2) massive PEs: shock and/or hypotension (a systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg or a pressure drop of ≥ 40 mmHg for > 15 min if not caused by a new-onset arrhythmia, hypovolemia or sepsis); (3) sub-massive PEs: hemodynamically stable with right ventricular (RV) dysfunction on echocardiography (the existence of RV dilatation or an elevated tricuspid valvular pressure gradient of ≥ 40 mmHg); and (4) non-massive PEs: hemodynamically stable without RV dysfunction on echocardiography [ , , ]. We defined severe PEs as cardiac arrest/collapse or massive PEs, and mild PEs as sub-massive or non-massive PEs. In the package insert in Japan, a full-dose of monteplase (t-PA) is 27.5 × 10 3 IU/kg, whereas a reduced-dose is 13.75 × 10 3 IU/kg. In the present study, a standard-dose of t-PA was defined as drug doses of ≥ 20 × 10 3 IU/kg, whereas a low-dose of t-PA was defined as drug doses of < 20 × 10 3 IU/kg. The detailed definitions of the other patient characteristics are described in Online Resource Appendix 2.
Clinical endpoints
In the previous reports, the effects of thrombolysis were confined to the first few days [ ], and clinical endpoints of thrombolysis were usually evaluated at a few days and 1 month [ , , ]. Thus, in the current study, the effectiveness outcome measures were defined as all-cause death at 10 days and 30 days, whereas the safety outcome measures were defined as major bleeding at 10 days and 30 days. Major bleeding was defined as International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) major bleeding, which consisted of a reduction in the hemoglobin level by at least 2 g/dL, a transfusion of at least 2 units of blood, or symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ [ ]. The independent clinical event committee (Online Resource Appendix 3) unaware of the patient characteristics reviewed all study outcomes.
Statistical analysis
We presented the categorical variables as numbers and percentages, and continuous variables as the mean with the standard deviation or median with the interquartile range based on their distributions. Categorical variables were compared using the Chi squared test when appropriate; otherwise, a Fisher’s exact test was used. Continuous variables were compared using the Student’s t test or Wilcoxon’s rank sum test based on their distributions. We used the univariate logistic regression models to estimate the odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the effect of t-PA thrombolysis relative to no thrombolysis for the clinical outcomes. To adjust for potential confounders, we constructed the multivariable logistic regression models. Consistent with the previous reports [ , , , ], we selected 6 clinically relevant risk-adjusting variables (age, sex, history of major bleeding, active cancer, anemia, and the clinical severity of PEs). Additionally, we constructed the multivariable logistic regression models stratified by the clinical severity of PEs (severe PEs and mild PEs) and incorporated the interaction terms to estimate the P values for the interaction. Furthermore, among the patients with thrombolysis, we evaluated the effect of the low-dose t-PA group relative to the standard-dose t-PA group for the clinical outcomes by constructing the same multivariable logistic regression model. All statistical analyses were conducted using R software packages (version 3.5.0; R Development Core Team) or JMP version 10.0.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). All statistical analyses were two tailed and P values of < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Results
Patient characteristics
In the present study population, the mean age was 67 years, 63% were women, and the mean body weight and body mass index were 58.3 kg and 23.3 kg/m 2 , respectively. The prevalence of t-PA thrombolysis was 12% in the entire study population, 33% in patients with severe PEs, and 9.2% in patients with mild PEs. The prevalence of t-PA thrombolysis varied widely across the participating centers (Fig. 2 ). The baseline characteristics significantly differed regarding several aspects between the patients with and without t-PA thrombolysis (Table 1 ). Patients with t-PA thrombolysis were younger, and more frequently had a higher body weight, but less frequently had an active cancer at diagnosis, history of stroke, history of major bleeding, and anemia than patients with no thrombolysis. Patients with t-PA thrombolysis more often had severe PEs, and more frequently received initial parenteral anticoagulation, ventilator support, and percutaneous cardiopulmonary support than patients with no thrombolysis (Table 1 ). In patients with severe PEs, the prevalence of cardiac arrests/collapses was numerically higher in the patients with no thrombolysis than in those with t-PA thrombolysis (Online Resource Table 1).

The values of the eGFR were calculated based on the equation reported by the Japan Association of Chronic Kidney Disease Initiative [man: 194*Scr −1.094 *age −0.287 , woman: 194*Scr −1.094 *age −0.287 *0.739]. The sPESI score included the following variables: age > 80 years, history of cancer, history of chronic cardiopulmonary disease, heart rate ≥ 110 beats/min, systolic blood pressure < 100 mmHg, and arterial oxygen saturation < 90% at the time of the diagnosis. Anemia was diagnosed if the value of the hemoglobin was < 13 g/dL for men and < 12 g/dL for women. Thrombocytopenia was diagnosed if the value of the platelets was < 100 × 10 9 /L. Thrombophilia included a protein C deficiency, protein S deficiency, antithrombin deficiency, and antiphospholipid syndrome t - PA tissue plasminogen activator, VTE venous thromboembolism, PE pulmonary embolism, DVT deep vein thrombosis, sPESI simplified pulmonary embolism severity index
Thrombolysis with t-PA (monteplase)
Among 180 patients with t-PA thrombolysis, 144 (80%) received systemic t-PA thrombolysis, and 36 (20%) local, catheter-delivered, t-PA thrombolysis (Online Resource Table 2). The median drug dose and drug dose per body weight was 800 × 10 3 IU and 14.7 × 10 3 IU/kg, respectively. More than half of the patients received a low-dose of t-PA (< 20 × 10 3 IU/kg), and the vast majority of the patients received t-PA thrombolysis soon after the diagnosis.
Clinical outcomes
The incidence of all-cause death did not differ between the t-PA thrombolysis group and no thrombolysis group at 10 days (4.4% vs. 4.3%, P = 0.93) and 30 days (5.0% vs. 6.9%, P = 0.33) (Table 2 ). After adjusting for the potential confounders, a lower risk in the t-PA thrombolysis group relative to the no thrombolysis group was significant for all-cause death at 10 days and 30 days (Adjusted OR 0.40; 95% CI 0.17–0.94, P = 0.03, and Adjusted OR 0.41; 95% CI 0.18–0.90, P = 0.03). Table 2 Crude and adjusted clinical outcomes t-PA thrombolysis (N = 180) No thrombolysis (N = 1369) Crude OR (95% CI) P-value Adjusted OR (95% CI) P-value All-cause death at 10 days 8 (4.4%) 59 (4.3%) 1.03 (0.49–2.20) 0.93 0.40 (0.17–0.94) 0.03 All-cause death at 30 days 9 (5.0%) 95 (6.9%) 0.71 (0.35–1.42) 0.33 0.41 (0.18–0.90) 0.03 Major bleeding at 10 days 7 (3.9%) 22 (1.6%) 2.48 (1.04–5.88) 0.04 2.26 (0.84–6.13) 0.11 Major bleeding at 30 days 10 (5.6%) 40 (2.9%) 1.95 (0.96–3.98) 0.06 2.39 (1.06–5.36) 0.03 Patients with events are presented as numbers and incidences (%). The crude and adjusted ORs and 95% CIs were estimated by the logistic regression models using the no thrombolysis group as the reference. To adjust for the potential confounders, we selected six clinically relevant risk-adjusting variables (age, sex, history of major bleeding, active cancer, anemia, and the clinical severity of PEs) for the multivariable logistic regression models t - PA tissue plasminogen activator, CI confidence interval, OR odds ratio, PE pulmonary embolism
Major bleeding tended to occur more frequently in the t-PA thrombolysis group than no thrombolysis group at 10 days (3.9% vs. 1.6%, P = 0.04) and 30 days (5.6% vs. 2.9%, P = 0.06) (Table 2 ). After adjusting for the potential confounders, the excessive risk in the t-PA thrombolysis group relative to the no thrombolysis group for major bleeding tended to be higher at 10 days (Adjusted OR 2.26; 95% CI 0.84–6.13, P = 0.11) and was significantly higher at 30 days (Adjusted OR 2.39; 95% CI 1.06–5.36, P = 0.03) (Table 2 ).
Clinical outcomes stratified by the clinical severities
Overall, there were no significant interactions between the severity of the PEs and the effect in the t-PA thrombolysis group relative to the no thrombolysis group for the mortality and bleeding outcomes. However, in the patients with severe PEs, the incidence of all-cause death was significantly lower in the t-PA thrombolysis group than no thrombolysis group at 10 days (14% vs. 36%, P = 0.004) and 30 days (15% vs. 37%, P = 0.006) (Online Resource Table 3, and Online Resource Figs. 1, 2). Even after adjusting for the potential confounders, the lower risk in the t-PA thrombolysis group relative to the no thrombolysis group remained significant for all-cause death at 10 days and 30 days (Adjusted OR 0.33; 95% CI 0.13–0.84, P = 0.02, and Adjusted OR 0.36; 95% CI 0.15–0.88, P = 0.02) (Online Resource Table 3). On the other hand, in the patients with mild PEs, the absolute mortality rates were low, and the adjusted risks in the t-PA thrombolysis group relative to the no thrombolysis group were not significant for the all-cause death at 10 days and 30 days (Online Resource Table 3, and Online Resource Figs. 1, 2).
Clinical outcomes according to drug doses of t-PA
The incidence of all-cause death did not differ between the low-dose t-PA group and standard-dose t-PA group at both 10 days (2.5% vs. 5.9%, P = 0.42) and 30 days (2.5% vs. 5.9%, P = 0.42) (Online Resource Table 4). The incidence of major bleeding also did not differ between the low-dose t-PA group and standard-dose t-PA group at 10 days (1.7% vs. 5.9%, P = 0.28) and 30 days (4.2% vs. 5.9%, P = 0.71) (Online Resource Table 4).
Discussion
The main findings of the present study were as follows: (1) In the present study population, the prevalence of t-PA thrombolysis was 12% in the entire study population, 33% in patients with severe PEs, and 9.2% in patients with mild PEs with a wide variation across the participating centers; (2) t-PA thrombolysis was associated with a lower risk of mortality, particularly in patients with severe PEs, with a trend toward a higher risk for major bleeding.
The strength of the present study was that the current registry evaluated consecutive PE patients in the real world including patients receiving t-PA thrombolysis with mild PEs and/or a low-dose of t-PA, and it also provided information on the gap between the current evidence and daily clinical practice. In a previous large European cohort study including 15,944 patients with acute PEs, 432 (2.7%) patients received thrombolysis [ ]. On the other hand, in a previous Japanese study by questionnaire surveys including 338 patients with acute PEs, 87 (26%) patients received thrombolysis with urokinase in 41 (12%) and t-PA in 47 (14%) [ ]. The present study in Japan also showed a high proportion of patients receiving t-PA thrombolysis (12%), and importantly, a large proportion of the patients receiving t-PA thrombolysis had mild PEs. Furthermore, the present study showed a wide variation in the t-PA thrombolysis use across the participating centers, suggesting that the treatment strategies varied widely depending on the institution. The current guidelines do not recommend routine use of primary systemic thrombolysis in patients with acute PEs who are hemodynamically stable [ , ]. In the present study, the mortality risk at 30 days tended to be lower with t-PA thrombolysis relative to no thrombolysis in the patients with mild PEs. However, the number of patients treated with t-PA thrombolysis was small in this mild PEs subgroup. Given the increased risk for major bleeding with thrombolysis, we should be more conservative about administering thrombolysis for patients with acute PEs who are hemodynamically stable.
A recent meta-analysis including 15 randomized controlled studies involving 2057 patients reported that thrombolysis reduced the overall mortality in patients with acute PEs, however, the decrease in the overall mortality was not significant in the hemodynamically stable patients with acute PEs [ ]. Other previous studies also reported similar results [ , , ]. Consistent with these reports, the present study also showed that t-PA thrombolysis was associated with a significantly lower risk of mortality in patients with severe PEs. However, a substantial proportion of patients with severe PEs did not receive t-PA thrombolysis in the present study. The current guidelines recommend t-PA thrombolysis for acute PE patients with hemodynamic compromise [ , ]. Clinicians should be familiar with the recommended treatment strategies for patients with severe PEs.
Regarding the safety of t-PA thrombolysis, the same previous meta-analysis reported that thrombolysis was associated with a higher risk of major bleeding (thrombolysis group: 9.9% and control group: 3.6%; relative risk 2.91) [ ]. In line with that report, the present study showed that t-PA thrombolysis tended to have a higher risk of major bleeding (5.6% vs. 2.9% at 30 days; adjusted relative risk 2.39), although the absolute major bleeding rates with t-PA thrombolysis seemed to be lower compared to that in the previous report. This might be partly because more than half of the patients with t-PA thrombolysis received a low-dose of t-PA in the present study. Further clinical trials are warranted to define the benefit of the low-dose of t-PA and optimal doses of t-PA thrombolysis.
Study limitations
The present study had several limitations. First, we could not deny a selection bias for t-PA thrombolysis use in patients with severe PEs. There might have been a substantial proportion of patients with severe PEs who were too sick for t-PA thrombolysis, and were deemed to have an extremely high mortality risk. Indeed, in patients with severe PEs, the prevalence of cardiac arrest/collapse was numerically higher in the patients with no thrombolysis than in those with t-PA. Furthermore, the prevalence of t-PA thrombolysis varied widely across the participating centers, which could have introduced selection bias. Second, the patient demographics, practice patterns, and medical therapy, as well as the clinical outcomes in the patients with PEs in Japan may differ from those in patients outside Japan. Third, the present study was conducted before the introduction of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) for VTEs in Japan [ ]. Thus, it should be interpreted with caution whether the present study results could be extrapolated to patients treated with DOACs. Fourth, despite the relatively large number of patients enrolled in the present study, the number of patients with thrombolysis was relatively small. Thus, the analysis on the effect of thrombolysis could be underpowered, particularly in the subgroup analysis. Therefore, the effect of thrombolysis on the subgroup should be regarded as hypothesis generating. Finally, the present study population included some patients with a history of VTEs and those receiving anticoagulation therapy at the time of the diagnosis, which could have had some influence on the clinical outcomes. Thus, we analyzed the patient characteristics and clinical outcomes after excluding 57 patients with a history of a VTE and 80 patients receiving anticoagulation therapy at the time of the diagnosis. As a result, we had almost the same results as the main analysis (Online Resource Tables 5 and 6).
Conclusions
In the present real-world VTE registry in Japan, t-PA thrombolysis was not infrequently implemented, not only in patients with severe PEs, but also in patients with mild PEs. A substantial mortality risk reduction might be suggested with t-PA thrombolysis in patients with severe PEs.
