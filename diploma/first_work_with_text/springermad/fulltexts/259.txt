Introduction
Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is one of the most common causes of vascular death and represents the leading cause of preventable death in hospitalized patients [ , , ]. Compared with young subjects, elderly patients present a higher incidence of PE and a higher risk of PE-related adverse outcomes like recurrences and mortality [ , , ].
Current international guidelines recommend risk stratification to drive decisions on acute treatment and clinical management strategies in patients with PE [ ], and data from randomized trials and observational studies suggest that low-risk PE patients may be safely treated after an abbreviated hospital stay or as outpatients, thus reducing costs, complications associated with hospitalization and improving patients’ quality of life [ , ].
Several predictors have been proposed for risk stratification in patients with PE, including biomarkers, imaging tests, echocardiography [ , ] and clinical risk scores like Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI) [ ] and its simplified version (sPESI) [ ]. The sPESI can be calculated more easily than the original PESI and both scores were validated as short term (30-day) predictors of overall mortality in patients with PE, even though elderly population was under-represented in derivation cohorts and validation studies [ , , ].
Elderly patients presenting with acute PE frequently have significant underlying comorbidities which can predispose to PE and may condition short and long-term prognosis [ , ]. The burden of disease arising from multiple comorbidities may be measured by the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score [ ], which has shown to be a useful predicting tool in some conditions [ , , ]. However, studies performed in patients with PE are scarce [ ] and data on the prognostic utility of CCI in elderly subjects with PE are not available.
The current study aimed to determine the ability of CCI score to predict short and long-term mortality in elderly patients with hemodynamically stable acute PE.
Materials and methods
All patients aged ≥65 years old evaluated in the Emergency Department (ED) of Vimercate Hospital for clinically suspected PE since 2010 through 2014 were included in this retrospective cohort study. The standard praxis in the ED of our hospital considers performing a pulmonary computerized tomography angiography (CTA) scan based on an emergency physician’s gestalt approach or evidence based algorithms, to exclude PE if suspected in hemodynamically stable subjects, whereas Wells score and sPESI variables are recorded and available for all patients with suspected PE. Helical computerized tomography scans were performed on a Brilliance Philips CT scanner (Philips, Cleveland, OH, USA) which included 64-detector row capability.
Pulmonary embolism was ruled out or confirmed on the basis of the absence or presence of a filling defect in one or more pulmonary arteries up to sub-segmental arteries in pulmonary CTA, as stated at the time of the acquisition of images by hospital staff certified radiologists. Patients with confirmed PE were treated according to international guidelines [ ].
The CCI score was used to measure comorbid status [ ]. CCI is a summation score based on 17 medical conditions with varying assigned weights (non-age adjusted). A score of 1 is given whether 1 of the following conditions is present: myocardial infarction, cardiac failure, peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, dementia, chronic pulmonary disease, connective tissue disease, peptic ulcer disease, mild liver disease, and diabetes (without organ damage); a score of 2 is given for hemiplegia, moderate to severe renal disease, any tumor (within last 5 years), lymphoma, leukemia, and diabetes with organ damage; a score of 3 for moderate to severe liver disease; and a score of 6 for metastatic solid tumor and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. A value of 0 indicates no comorbidity, while higher values represent an increasing burden of comorbid illnesses. The sPESI score was calculated giving one point for the presence of every of the following parameters: (1) age >80 years; (2) history of cancer; (3) history of chronic cardiac or pulmonary disease (heart failure or chronic lung disease); (4) pulse rate >110 beats/min; (5) systolic blood pressure <100 mmHg; and (6) arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation <90% measured at the time of PE diagnosis. Patients with none of the variables (0 points) were categorized as low-risk; and those with one to six the variables (1–6 points) as high-risk [ ].
Clinical, laboratory and radiological data were obtained from patients’ medical charts through the centralized electronic database of our hospital. Quality control checks, data cleaning, and imputation of missing values was performed by trained advanced medical students supervised by senior physicians. For coding diseases, the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnostic codes were used. All patients with confirmed PE were admitted to the hospital, and treated according to the international guidelines.
Vital status at the end of follow-up was recorded for all patients. Unique personal identifiers were checked for the follow-up concerning mortality using the regional demographic register updated at August 31th 2015.
Because of the retrospective design, informed consent was not obtained from individual patients, but permission for data analysis and to perform the study was asked to the Institutional Research Ethics Committee.
Statistical methods
Demographic and clinical variables were summarized in the whole sample by absolute numbers and percentages, for categorical variables, and by median value and range, for continuous variables. Median follow-up was evaluated by reverse Kaplan Meier method [ ].
Survival probability curves were estimated by Kaplan Meier method [ ]. The same method was used to estimate the mortality probability at 30, 90 days and 2 years and corresponding 95% Confidence Intervals (CI). Univariate analysis for survival at 30, 90 days and 2 years for the main demographic and clinical relevant variables were performed by Cox regression model [ ]. Categorical variables were considered as dichotomous. Continuous variables were dichotomized according to cut off used in clinical routine, as reported in Tables 1 and 3 . The assumption of proportional hazard was tested according to the procedure proposed by Grambsch and Thernau [ ]. Results are reported as hazard ratios (HR) with 95% CI.

The adjusted prognostic impact of CCI score and sPESI score was evaluated by multivariable Cox regression model. It is suggested that for reliable results, the ratio of number of events to number of variables included in the model should be at least five [ ] and when few events occur, only predefined variables selected by clinical criteria as important for the adjustment should be included. In the present study there were sufficient numbers of deaths at 90 days and 2 years to include only sex and age. On the contrary, within 30 days adjustment for sex and age was not possible. Moreover, the interaction between sPESI score and CCI score was included in the models and tested by Wald statistics. If it was not statistically significant it was not included in the analysis for discriminant ability.
To evaluate the contribution of CCI score, alone and in addition to sPESI score to discriminate between people died and alive within 30, 90 days or 2 years, the Harrel C indexes were computed, together with their 95% CI [ ]. Harrel C index was used because it corresponds to the AUC, the area under the ROC curve obtained from the Cox model predictor. The value of C index obtained from data used for model estimating provides an optimistic measure of discriminant ability, thus values of C index corrected for the optimism by bootstrap method were also reported [ ]. Finally the improvement in the discriminant ability of CCI score was evaluated by Net Reclassification Improvement (NRI) for survival analysis. Results were reported as ½ NRI, being interpreted as an average improvement in classification [ ]. Sex and age (with its potential non-linear effect) were considered as adjusting covariates in the Cox models to improve the prognostic performance of CCI score and its discriminant ability [ ].
Results
All patients aged ≥65 years old with a confirmed diagnosis of hemodynamically stable acute PE evaluated in the ED of our hospital since 2010 through 2014 represent the study population (162 out of 657 suspected cases, prevalence of confirmed PE: 24.7%).
The median age of the cohort was 79.2 years, 78 subjects (48.1%) were aged ≥80 years, 52 (32.1%) were females, 74.1% of patients presented an sPESI score ≥1 and 61.1% a CCI score ≥1. Baseline clinical characteristics of the study population are shown in Table 1 .
Sixty-three patients (38.9%) did not present comorbidities (CCI score = 0). The distribution of the cohort, according to CCI and sPESI scores, is presented in Table 2 .

The cumulative incidence of death (for all causes) within 30, 90 days and 2 years was 11.7% (95%CI 6.6–16.6), with 19 deaths, 9.8% (95% CI 13.4–25.7), with 32 deaths and 31.8% (95% CI 24.1–38.8), with 50 deaths, respectively.
Univariate analysis
In univariate analysis no evidence of violation of proportional hazard was showed, except for CCI score at 30 days. A trend for the increase of hazard ratio of death during time is suggested, reaching a value of 1.581 at 30 days. Nevertheless, considering the small time period and the limited number of deaths (19) and the fact that at 90 days and 2 years the time dependent effect was no more highlighted, we considered the simplest model at 30 days without time dependent effect, giving a constant hazard ratio of 1.24.
Univariate analysis showed that the presence, at the index event, of know cancer, chronic cardiopulmonary disease, arterial oxygen saturation <90%, as well as sPESI and CCI scores (as discrete variables), were associated with higher rates of mortality at 30, 90 days and 2 years, Table 3 . The hazard of death at 30, 90 days and 2 years for patients having a CCI score ≥1 was 2.476, 4.924, 4.227 times the hazard of death of patients having a CCI score = 0, but only HRs at 90 days and 2 years were statistically significant.

Discriminant ability of sPESI and CCI scores on survival at 30 days
The Cox model including only the sPESI score as predictor of mortality within 30 days after the index event showed an AUC = 0.642 (95% CI 0.511–0.772) and after correcting for optimism AUC opt = 0.632. When CCI score was added, together with their interaction, the latter was not statistically significant (p-value = 0.779), thus an additive model was considered. Adding CCI score as covariate together with sPESI did not increase its prognostic performance, AUC = 0.717 (95% CI 0.593–0.84) and after correcting for optimism AUC opt = 0.695; ½ NRI = 0.301, p = 0.1, see Table 4 for model estimates.

Discriminant ability of sPESI and CCI scores and adjusted analysis on survival at 90 days
The unadjusted prognostic performance for mortality within 90 days significantly increased when CCI was included in the model together with the sPESI score. AUC of the model with sPESI score alone was 0.638 (95% CI 0.538–0.739), the value adjusted for optimism was AUC opt = 0.631. Even in this model the interaction between sPESI and CCI was not significant (p-value = 0.981). When CCI and sPESI where included both in the model the AUC was 0.758 (95% CI 0.673–0.843) and AUC opt = 0.748, ½ NRI = 0.432, p = 0.005, see Table 4 for model estimates.
For mortality within 90 days, the HR of sPESI score adjusted for sex and age is 1.513 (95% CI 1.079–2.121, p-value = 0.016) for every point of increase of the sPESI score and the HR of CCI score adjusted for sex and age is 1.305 (95% CI 1.178–1.446, p-value < 0.001) for every point of increase of the CCI score. However, whether the model included as covariates both sPESI and CCI scores together, adjusted by sex and age, the HR of sPESI score became non-significant and the CCI score showed a HR 1.282 (95% CI 1.151–1.429, p-value < 0.001), that represents the increased of the risk of death within 90 days for every point of increase of CCI score. The adjusted model including sPESI and CCI scores showed an average improvement in classification (½ NRI = 0.368, 95% CI 0.016–0.572, p-value = 0.035) against the model including only the sPESI score, Table 4 .
Discriminant ability of sPESI and CCI scores and adjusted analysis on survival at 2 years
The unadjusted prognostic performance for mortality within 2 years significantly increased when CCI was included in the model together with the sPESI score. AUC of the model with sPESI score alone was 0.625 (95% CI 0.545–0.705), the value adjusted for optimism was AUC opt = 0.628. Even in this model the interaction between sPESI and CCI was not significant (p-value = 0.666). When CCI and sPESI where included both in the model the AUC was 0.740 (95% CI 0.672–0.808) and AUC opt = 0.737, ½NRI = 0.396, 95% CI 0.145–0.552, p-value < 0.001, Table 4 .
The discriminant ability for mortality within 2 years in an adjusted model including sPESI score, sex and age showed a HR 1.430 (95% CI 1.077–1.899, p-value = 0.014). When covariates included were CCI score, sex and age, HR was 1.312 (95% CI 1.202–1.433, p-value < 0.001). Even in this case, when including as covariates both sPESI and CCI scores together, adjusted by sex and age, the HR of sPESI score became non-significant (p-value = 0.353) and CCI score remained associated with 2-years mortality (HR 1.295, 95% CI 1.180–1.421, p-value < 0.001). The adjusted model including sPESI and CCI score showed an average improvement in classification (½ NRI = 0.315, 95% CI 0.068–0.489, p-value = 0.020) when compared with the adjusted model including only the sPESI score. See Table 4 for model estimates.
Discussion
Even though elderly patients present both a high incidence of PE and a high prevalence of underlying comorbidities which may condition short and long-term prognosis, data on the prognostic utility of comorbidities assessment in elderly subjects with PE are lacking.
Our study shows that CCI score, considered as a discrete variable, was associated with short and long-term mortality in elderly subjects with acute PE, and that the hazard of death at 90 days and 2 years for patients having a CCI score ≥1 was significantly higher (4.924 and 4.227 times, respectively) than the hazard of death of patients having a CCI score = 0. In addition, when compared with sPESI, CCI score shows a significantly better ability to predict 90-day and 2-year mortality.
Some points warrant specific comments. First, our study population is represented by real-world elderly patients, evaluated in the ED, with a confirmed diagnosis of hemodynamically stable PE. The finding of mortality rates markedly higher than younger subjects is in line with data reported by other studies [ , , , , ]. For example, long-term mortality in 1023 patients with confirmed acute PE was 35.5% during a mean follow-up of 3.8 ± 2.6 years [ ]. In the RIETE registry, 90-day all-cause mortality was 5.6 and 27% according the presence of absence of cancer [ ] and one-third of PE patients aged above 90 years die during the first few months [ ]. Cefalo et al. reported results quite similar to ours, with a 30-day mortality of 11% among patients aged ≥65 years, against 3% in subjects <65 year old [ ]. Mortality rate within 30 days in the sPESI score derivation cohort study was lower (7.8%) but it represented a younger, general population with about half of patients aged <65 years old [ ].
Second, the CCI score was an univariate and multivariate independent predictor of mortality in elderly patients with acute PE. The univariate analysis showed a HRs for every unit increase of CCI score of 1.250, 1.307, 1.292, for mortality at 30, 90 days and 2 years, respectively. When considering CCI score as a dichotomous variable, the hazard of death at 90 days and 2 years for patients having a CCI score ≥1 was 4.924 and 4.227 times the hazard of death of patients having a CCI score = 0. The assessment of the burden of comorbidities by using the CCI score has been investigated as short and long-term mortality predictor in different conditions [ , , ], but studies on the prognostic ability of CCI in patients with acute PE are scarce. Ng et al., in a general population cohort, found that the CCI score presented a good discriminatory power for predicting in-hospital and long-term mortality following acute PE [ ]. In that study, for every unit of increase of the CCI score, the HR for in-hospital death was 1.27 and for post-discharge death was 1.35 [ ], results in line with ours.
Third, in the univariate analysis we found than the sPESI score was associated with higher rates of mortality at 30, 90 days and 2 years, with HRs for every unit increase of sPESI of 1.592, 1.626 and 1.550, respectively. Even though it has been validated as short-term (30 days) predictor, a potential role of the sPESI score as predictor of long-term mortality has been suggested by some authors like Kilic et al., who found that sPESI score predicted short-term and long-term survival, with a 6 years mortality of 100% in patients classified as high-risk [ ]. Interestingly, in our study the CCI score perform better than the sPESI score at 90 days and 2 years, and the HR of sPESI score became non significant when CCI score was added to the model. These data support the hypothesis that short-term prognosis is mainly related to the acute PE episode whereas medium-long term mortality is mainly related to comorbidity. Since two variables of sPESI score are related to comorbidity (cancer and cardiopulmonary disease) it also presents a modest prediction ability for median-long term mortality. Instead, CCI score has been specifically proposed and validated to assess comorbidities burden, thus, when the model includes it together with sPESI, CCI score remains the only which statistically predicts mortality at 90 days and 2 years.
A strength of this study is that, at our best knowledge, it represents the first observation on the prognostic ability of comorbidity assessment in elderly patients with acute PE. In addition, the prognostic ability of the CCI score was compared with the sPESI score, a validated, frequently used in clinical practice, prognostic tool. The main limitation is small sample size, and multicenter, prospective, larger cohort studies are needed to confirm our findings. When analyzing the CCI score as a dichotomous variable, we considered as values 0 and ≥1 based on the clinical assumption that would distinguish patients with and without comorbidities. However, this approach has been determined arbitrary and the most suitable CCI score cut-off for prediction of death remains to be established.
Conclusion
In elderly patients with a confirmed diagnosis of hemodynamically stable PE, the CCI score was found to be an univariate and multivariate independent predictor of mortality. The hazard of death at 90 days and 2 years for patients having a CCI score ≥1 was 4.924 and 4.227, respectively, when compared to patients having a CCI score = 0. CCI score shows a significantly better ability to predict 90-day and 2-year mortality than sPESI. The assessment of comorbidity burden by using the CCI score may be proposed as an useful tool to predict mortality in elderly patients with hemodynamically stable acute PE.
