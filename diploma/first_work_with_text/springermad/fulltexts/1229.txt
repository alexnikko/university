Introduction
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common destructive inflammatory joint disease that affects the diarthrodial joints. Two characteristics of the inflamed RA joint are infiltration of activated immune cells (such as neutrophils) and local tissue hypoxia [ ]. One of the most abundant cytokines in the rheumatoid synovium is interleukin (IL)6, a typical cytokine featuring redundancy and pleiotropic activity that contributes to host defence against pathogens. Dysregulation of IL6 production plays a significant pathological role in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as RA. IL6, alone or with other cytokines, interacts with various cells such as T cells, B cells, monocytes and fibroblasts, driving synovial proliferation, inflammation, autoimmunity and destruction of articular structures [ , ].
The humanized anti-IL6 receptor antibody (αIL6R), tocilizumab, is highly effective in the treatment of RA as monotherapy as well as in combination with classical disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs as has been convincingly demonstrated in several studies (e.g. CHARISMA [ ], TOWARD [ ], RADIATE [ ] and AMBITION [ ]). Tocilizumab binds to soluble and membrane-bound IL6 receptors and inhibits IL6 signalling. Besides its beneficial clinical effects, tocilizumab has been shown to decrease acute phase reactants [e.g. C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)], lower hepcidin production, reduce the formation of inflammatory Th17 cells and B cell activation, and diminish bone absorption and cartilage turnover [ , , , ].
Treatment with tocilizumab is known to be associated with a reduction in peripheral blood neutrophil counts and a higher incidence of neutropenia [ ]. Possible mechanisms by which tocilizumab may result in lower neutrophil counts include blockade of IL6-induced neutrophil survival, down-regulation of other inflammatory cytokines and facilitation of neutrophil migration from the circulation into tissues [ , , , , , ]. The effects of tocilizumab on neutrophils may represent therapeutic effects occurring under hypoxic conditions (as found in inflamed RA joints), rather than adverse effects [ ]. We aimed to determine in vitro whether the potential effects of tocilizumab on neutrophil survival, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the removal of debris and pathogens by phagocytosis, and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemo-attractants may contribute to the therapeutic success of the treatment of inflamed RA joints. This is of particular importance since other biological drugs for RA treatment are less frequently associated with neutropenia.
Materials and methods
Experimental design
Human CD15+/CD16+ neutrophils were purified by MACS ® Technology, pre-treated for 30 min with varying doses of tocilizumab and, for comparison, dexamethasone or IgG1 in order to mimic therapy. Based on the findings of Kelkka et al. [ ] who demonstrated that TLR pathway is modulated by phagocyte ROS to stimulate the development of arthritis, we mimicked the arthritis flare by simulating neutrophil activation. Therefore, cells were stimulated with high-dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS at 1 µg/ml) alone—triggering TLR2/4- or LPS plus IL6 (10 ng/ml), for 30 min unless otherwise noted. Cells were incubated under normoxic (18 % O 2 ) or hypoxic (1 % O 2 ) conditions and subsequently analysed (Supplemental Fig. 1).
Antibodies and reagents
LPS and dexamethasone were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Tocilizumab was purchased from Roche Pharma. IL6 was purchased from R&D systems. NADPH oxidase inhibitors DPI and VAS-2870 were purchased from Enzo Life Sciences GmbH. Flebogamma (highly purified, unmodified, human IgG) was purchased from GRIFOLS. Anti-hCD15-APC and anti-hCD16-FITC were purchased from Miltenyi Biotech and BD Pharmingen, respectively.
Cell isolation and cell culture
Human CD15+/CD16+ neutrophils (>98 % purity and >95 % viability) were prepared as follows. Polymorphonuclear granulocytes were isolated from heparinized peripheral blood collected by venipuncture from healthy volunteers with informed consent and with approval of the ethics committee of Charité University Medicine Berlin in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Erythrocytes were removed by hypotonic lysis. CD15+/CD16+ neutrophils were enriched by CD15+ MACS (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and verified by flow cytometry (Supplemental Fig. 1). Cells were re-suspended in RPMI 1640 (PAA Laboratories) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 µg/ml streptomycin (both PAA Laboratories GmbH) and 50 µM 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich) and if not otherwise indicated with 10 % (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Sigma-Aldrich).
Induction of hypoxia, stimulation procedure and drug treatment
Neutrophils were incubated in a hypoxia chamber (Binder) at 5 % CO 2 level and less than 1 % O 2 (pathophysiological hypoxia) balanced with N 2 . Normoxic controls were incubated at 5 % CO 2 in a humidified atmosphere with approximately 18 % O 2 . Therapy was mimicked by treating the neutrophils with either tocilizumab at doses of 2, 4 and 8 µg/ml (T2, T4 and T8), dexamethasone 10 −8 M (DEX), human IgG1 provided as Flebogamma 5 % DIF ® (10 µg/ml)—in order to control Fc-receptor-mediated effects—or left untreated before stimulation with either high-dose LPS (1 µg/ml) or high-dose LPS plus IL6 (10 ng/ml) under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions.
Quantification of phagocytosis
Phagocytosis was quantified according to the manufacturer’s instructions using the Vybrant ® Phagocytosis Assay Kit (Life Technologies), as indicated. Fluorescence of all samples was quantified using the SynergyHT platereader (BioTek).
Quantification of apoptosis and necrosis
Neutrophil apoptosis and necrosis were quantified by annexin V and 7-aad staining (BD Pharmingen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (e.g. staining see supplemental Fig. 1). Data were acquired using a MACSQuant Flow Cytometer (Miltenyi Biotec). Data were processed by FlowJo v7.6.5 (Tree Star Inc.).
Quantification of intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels
After 20 h, aliquots of each cell suspension were taken for ATP measurements (50 µl). Samples for intracellular ATP levels were analysed using the CLS-II-KIT (Roche Diagnostics), treated according to manufacturer´s instructions and measured against a set of standard dilution rows. Luminescence of all samples was quantified using the SynergyHT platereader (BioTek).
Quantification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by luminometric assay
Detection of H 2 O 2 was conducted using the ROS-Glo™ luminescent H 2 O 2 assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To determine NAD(P)H oxidase contribution to ROS production, DPI (50 nM) and VAS-2870 (5 µM) were added to cell culture prior to incubation [ ]. Luminescence of all samples was quantified using the SynergyHT platereader (BioTek).
Quantification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by flow cytometry
For measuring cellular oxidative stress on single cell level in fixed neutrophils, CellROX ® Deep Red Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was applied according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The cell-permeant CellROX ® Deep Red Reagent dye is nonfluorescent while in a reduced state and exhibits bright fluorescence upon oxidation by ROS. To determine NADPH oxidase contribution to ROS production, DPI (50 nM) and VAS-2870 (5 µM) were added to cell culture prior to incubation procedure [ ]. To exclude dead cells, Zombie Green™ Fixable Viability Kit (Biolegend) was applied according to the manufacturer’s instructions prior to formaldehyde fixation (for gating strategy, see supplemental Fig. 2). Data were acquired using a MACSQuant Flow Cytometer (Miltenyi Biotec). Data were processed by FlowJo v7.6.5 (Tree Star Inc.).
Quantification of secreted cytokines, chemokines and growth factors
Culture supernatant of treated human neutrophils, incubated at 10 6 cells per ml under either normoxic or hypoxic conditions, was immediately frozen and stored at −70 °C. Secreted IL1β, IL6, tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα), macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) macrophage inflammatory protein 1α (MIP1α = CCL3) and MIP1β (CCL4) were quantified by multiplex suspension array (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Statistical analysis
Data shown are reported as the mean ± SD of at least three independent experiments unless otherwise indicated. Multiple comparisons were analysed by one-way or two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s or Dunnet’s (vs. control) multiple comparison post hoc tests. Statistical significance was considered when p < 0.05.
Results
Tocilizumab treatment enhances LPS-induced neutrophil apoptosis and necrosis by reducing intracellular ATP content irrespective of the addition of rhIL6
Under normoxic incubation conditions, tocilizumab treatment of LPS-stimulated neutrophils dose-dependently increased neutrophil apoptosis and necrosis (Figs. 1 a, b). Enhancement of inflammation by the addition of rhIL6 further increased cellular apoptosis ( p < 0.05; two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s multiple comparison post hoc test with regard to the treatment with tocilizumab 8 µg/ml), but did not increase necrosis (Fig. 1 d, e). The observed decrease in cellular viability was accompanied by a dose-dependent decrease in steady-state intracellular ATP levels (Fig. 1 c). The dose-dependent impairment in neutrophil energy status with either tocilizumab or dexamethasone was comparable to the dose-dependent decrease in steady-state intracellular ATP levels with either tocilizumab or dexamethasone and with the addition of rhIL6 (Fig. 1 f). Fig. 1 Tocilizumab treatment enhances LPS-induced neutrophil apoptosis and necrosis by reducing intracellular ATP content irrespective of the addition of rhIL6 under normoxia. CD15+/CD16+ neutrophils were MACS sorted, seeded and pre-incubated for 1 h. Cells were then pre-incubated with either dexamethasone 10 −8 M (DEX), tocilizumab at doses of 2, 4 or 8 µg/ml (T2, T4, T8) or IgG1 control for a further 30 min. Cells were treated with LPS (1 µg/ml) and without (w/o) rhIL6 ( a – c ) or with (w) rhIL6 (10 ng/ml) ( d – f ) and incubated for 20 h under normoxia (18 %O 2 ). Subsequently, cells were analysed for cell survival (apoptosis: a , d late apoptosis/necrosis: b , e n = 4–8) and steady-state ATP level: ( c , f n = 3–6). a , b , d , e Median with min. to max.; c , f mean ± SD; * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001 one-way RMA with Dunnett’s correction for multiple comparisons versus IgG1 control
The inflamed arthritic joint is characterized by pathophysiological hypoxia which is in contrast to standard normoxic cell culture conditions. Therefore, for comparison, we also incubated the cells under pathophysiological hypoxic conditions (1 % O 2 ). Under these conditions, tocilizumab treatment of LPS-stimulated neutrophils also dose-dependently increased neutrophil apoptosis and necrosis (Fig. 2 a, b) unlike dexamethasone 10 −8 M. Enhancement of inflammation under hypoxic conditions by the addition of rhIL6 enhanced neither cellular apoptosis nor necrosis (Fig. 2 d, e). Under hypoxia, the observed decrease in neutrophil viability after tocilizumab treatment was also accompanied by a dose-dependent reduction in steady-state intracellular ATP levels (Fig. 2 c). Again, the impairment in neutrophil energy status with either tocilizumab or dexamethasone was comparable to the dose-dependent decrease in steady-state intracellular ATP levels with either tocilizumab or dexamethasone and with the addition of rhIL6 (Fig. 2 f). Fig. 2 Tocilizumab treatment enhances LPS-induced neutrophil apoptosis and necrosis by reducing intracellular ATP content irrespective of the addition of rhIL6 under hypoxia. CD15+/CD16+ neutrophils were MACS sorted, seeded and pre-incubated for 1 h. Cells were then pre-incubated with either dexamethasone 10 −8 M (DEX), tocilizumab at doses of 2, 4 or 8 µg/ml (T2, T4, T8) or IgG1 control for a further 30 min. Cells were treated with LPS (1 µg/ml) and without (w/o) rhIL6 ( a – c ) or with (w) rhIL6 (10 ng/ml) ( d – f ) and incubated for 20 h under pathophysiological hypoxia (1 %O 2 ). Subsequently, cells were analysed for cell survival (apoptosis: a , d late apoptosis/necrosis: b , e n = 4–8) and steady-state ATP level: ( c , f n = 3–6); a , b , d , e Median with min. to max.; c , f mean ± SD; * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001 one-way RMA with Dunnett’s correction for multiple comparisons versus IgG1 control
The effects of tocilizumab on both neutrophil viability and cellular energy status under hypoxic incubation were significantly weaker than under normoxic incubation, as shown using two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s multiple comparison. For all conditions observed and all doses of tocilizumab evaluated, there was a significant protective impact of hypoxia on apoptosis ( p < 0.05 for all doses) and necrosis (2 µg/ml p < 0.001) (4 and 8 µg/ml p < 0.01). The addition of rhIL6 reduced the extent of this effect at lower doses of tocilizumab (2 and 4 µg/ml) for apoptosis but not for necrosis, where a significant protective effect of hypoxia could be observed (at least p < 0.01).
Moreover, there was also a significant impact of hypoxia on ATP levels with tocilizumab 2, 4 and 8 µg/ml ( p < 0.001, p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively), leading to higher steady-state intracellular ATP levels as compared to their normoxic counterparts. Addition of IL6 partially reduced this effect. Taken together, these findings clearly indicate a protective effect of hypoxia on cell viability and cellular energy status.
Tocilizumab induces oxidative burst and phagocytotic activity of neutrophils under normoxia but reduces both under hypoxia
Neutrophil effector function can be determined by the production of ROS and degranulation, and the removal of debris and pathogens by phagocytosis. To analyse the impact of tocilizumab on neutrophil function, we first assessed neutrophil oxidative burst/ROS generation (Fig. 3 ) and phagocytosis (Fig. 4 ). Fig. 3 Tocilizumab induces oxidative burst of neutrophils under normoxia but reduces oxidative burst under hypoxia. CD15+/CD16+ neutrophils were MACS sorted, seeded and pre-incubated for 1 h. Cells were then pre-incubated with either dexamethasone 10 −8 M (DEX), tocilizumab at doses of 2, 4 or 8 µg/ml (T2, T4, T8) or IgG1 control for a further 30 min. Cells were treated with LPS (1 µg/ml) and without (w/o) rhIL6 ( a , b ) or with (w) rhIL6 (10 ng/ml) ( c , d ) and incubated for 20 h under normoxia (18 %O 2 ) or pathophysiological hypoxia (1 %O 2 ) ( e , f ). To determine NAD(P)H oxidase contribution to ROS production, DPI (50 nM) and VAS-2870 (5 µM) were added to cell culture prior to incubation. Subsequently, cells were analysed for ROS generation by luminometric assay ( n = 4); a – d mean ± SD; * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001 one-way RMA with Dunnett’s correction for multiple comparisons versus IgG1 control. e , f Mean ± SD; * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001; one-sample t test is indicated by corresponding asterisk on top of bars one-way RMA with Bonferroni’s correction for multiple comparisons Fig. 4 Tocilizumab induces phagocytotic activity of neutrophils under normoxia but reduces phagocytosis under hypoxia. CD15+/CD16+ neutrophils were MACS sorted, seeded and pre-incubated for 1 h. Cells were then pre-incubated with either dexamethasone 10 −8 M (DEX), tocilizumab at doses of 2, 4 or 8 µg/ml (T2, T4, T8) or IgG1 control for a further 30 min. Cells were treated with LPS (1 µg/ml) and without (w/o) rhIL6 ( a , b ) or with (w) rhIL6 (10 ng/ml) ( C, D ) and incubated for 20 h under normoxia (18 %O 2 ) or pathophysiological hypoxia (1 %O 2 ). Subsequently, cells were analysed for phagocytosis ( n = 4); mean ± SD; * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001 one-way RMA with Dunnett’s correction for multiple comparisons versus IgG1 control
We found that neutrophil oxidative burst and phagocytosis of pathogens are more efficiently induced by LPS stimulation under hypoxia compared to normoxia ( p < 0.001; two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s multiple comparison) (Figs. 3 a, b, 4 a, b). Under normoxia, tocilizumab dose-dependently promotes the LPS-induced increase in oxidative burst and phagocytotic activity (Figs. 3 a, 4 a). The increase in oxidative burst and phagocytotic activity is significantly enhanced by the addition of rhIL6 ( p < 0.001; two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s multiple comparison; Figs. 3 c, 4c ). In contrast, under hypoxia, tocilizumab dose-dependently decreased oxidative burst and phagocytotic activity (Figs. 3 b, 4 b), but there was no further impact with the addition of rhIL6 (Figs. 3 d, 4 d). In contrast, dexamethasone fully blocked the LPS-mediated induction of oxidative burst and phagocytosis independently of oxygen availability (Figs. 3 , 4 ). Moreover, we could significantly inhibit the generation of ROS by applying diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI). DPI inhibits several important ROS-generating enzymes including nitric oxide synthase (NOS), NADPH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase, NADPH oxidases and NADPH cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase. ROS production could also be reduced but to a lesser extent by using a more specific inhibitor of NADPH oxidases, the triazolo pyrimidine VAS-2870 (Fig. 4 e, f) [ , ]. Interestingly, we observed a significant difference between the two inhibitors with regard to their inhibitory effects only in samples treated with tocilizumab independently of oxygen availability (Fig. 4 e, f). Finally, we confirmed our results on oxidative burst/ROS generation for tocilizumab at a dose of 8 µg/ml on single cell level by flow cytometry (Supplemental Fig. 2).
Tocilizumab affects neutrophil cytokine and chemokine secretion as a function of oxygen availability
To determine the impact of tocilizumab on neutrophil cytokine production, we analysed the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL1β, TNFα and IL6 as a target of therapy, as well as the secretion of the chemo-attractants MIF (pro-inflammatory and recruitment of, e.g. monocytes and T cells) [ ], CCL3 (recruitment and activation of neutrophils) [ ] and CCL4 (recruitment and survival of neutrophils) [ ].
Under normoxic incubation conditions, tocilizumab treatment of LPS-stimulated neutrophils had no significant effect on either pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion (Fig. 5 a–c) or chemokine secretion (Fig. 6 a–c). Addition of rhIL6 clearly enhanced the effects on both pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion (Fig. 5 d–f) and chemokine secretion (Fig. 6 d–f) to a significant extent for all factors analysed (at least p < 0.05). This enhancement of mediator secretion was significantly up-regulated by hypoxia for TNFα, MIF, MIP1α and MIP1β. The effects observed for tocilizumab treatment on cytokine and chemokine secretion were specific for each factor observed. No significant effect of tocilizumab treatment on IL1β could be observed (Fig. 5 a, d). IL6 was only induced by the highest dose of tocilizumab under hypoxia and IL6 treatment with a significant difference from the respective normoxic samples ( p < 0.01; Fig. 5 e). LPS/IL6-stimulated hypoxia-enhanced TNF secretion was significantly reduced by increasing doses of tocilizumab (Fig. 5 f). The latter could also be observed for MIF but only under normoxia. In contrast, tocilizumab treatment had no effect under hypoxia (Fig. 6 d). Tocilizumab 8 µg/ml significantly increased the LPS-induced secretion of MIP1α ( p < 0.05), whereas LPS-induced secretion of MIP1β was decreased with tocilizumab under both normoxia and hypoxia (Fig. 6 e, f). Finally, dexamethasone blocked the LPS and IL6-mediated induction of mediator secretion under either normoxia or hypoxia. Fig. 5 Tocilizumab affects neutrophil pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion as a function of oxygen availability. CD15+/CD16+ neutrophils were MACS sorted, seeded and pre-incubated for 1 h. Cells were then pre-incubated with either dexamethasone 10 −8 M (DEX), tocilizumab at doses of 2, 4 or 8 µg/ml (T2, T4, T8) or IgG1 control for a further 30 min. Cells were treated with LPS (1 µg/ml) and without (w/o) rhIL6 ( a – c ) or with (w) rhIL6 (10 ng/ml) ( d – f ) and incubated for 20 h under normoxia (18 %O 2 ) or pathophysiological hypoxia (1 %O 2 ). Cytokine secretion of IL1β, IL6 and TNFα were assessed by multiplex analysis ( n = 3); mean ± SEM; * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001 two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s correction for multiple comparisons; IL6 effect is indicated by corresponding asterisk on top of bars Fig. 6 Tocilizumab affects neutrophil chemokine secretion as a function of oxygen availability.

Discussion
Tocilizumab therapy is known to produce a prompt, transient and dose-dependent decrease in neutrophils [ , ]. IL6 blockade seems to be in general associated with a reduction in circulating neutrophil levels since it could also be observed after sarilumab therapy (αIL6R), olokizumab and sirukumab (both αIL6) [ ]. In line with its immunosuppressive effects, tocilizumab therapy is associated with increased susceptibility to bacterial and viral infections that are mostly mild to moderate in severity. It should be noted, however, that no clear association between the decrease in neutrophils after anti-IL6R therapy and occurrence of serious infections has been identified so far [ , ]. Nevertheless, it is recommended that tocilizumab treatment is not initiated in patients with active infections [ , ].
The observed effects of tocilizumab on neutrophils may contribute to the observed high efficacy of this drug in RA treatment. The decrease in neutrophils has been primarily explained through inhibition of the effect of IL6 on the recruitment of neutrophils into peripheral blood [ , , , ]. Very recently, Wright et al. [ ] observed that IL6 has no direct effect on human neutrophil functions associated with host defence (e.g. apoptosis, phagocytosis), which is in contrast to several previous publications and our findings [ , , , ]. Moreover, they could not find any effect of tocilizumab on the direct induction of apoptosis, the induction of apoptosis following depletion of IL6, or increased phagocytosis of neutrophils [ ]. Here we demonstrate that tocilizumab also leads to a dose-dependent reduction in neutrophil survival due to enhanced apoptosis and/or necrosis of activated cells, at least partially mediated via effects on cellular energy mechanism (Fig. 1 ). We interpret this finding as an additional explanation for the reduction in neutrophil cell counts observed in patients treated with this drug. Under hypoxia, this effect is less pronounced compared with normoxic conditions (Fig. 2 ). This finding is of interest as the bioenergetic situation under hypoxia (less oxidative phosphorylation, less radicals, more glycolytic ATP synthesis than under normoxia) may explain, at least in part, the effects of tocilizumab. Furthermore, hypoxic conditions are clinically relevant to consider since neutrophils and other immune cells face both ongoing inflammation and low oxygen levels in the arthritic joint. For the same reason, it is of importance that we also show tocilizumab to reduce neutrophil oxidative burst/ROS generation and phagocytosis under hypoxic, but not under normoxic conditions (Figs. 3 , 4 , and supplemental Fig. 3). More in detail, ROS generation is caused by enzyme systems including xanthine oxidase, the mitochondrial respiratory chain, lipid peroxidases, cytochrome P450 enzymes, and uncoupled endothelial NO synthase, secondary to their damage, which can be proteolysis but also caused by oxidative stress itself [ ]. The only enzyme family known to produce ROS as their primary and sole function are the multiprotein complexes NADPH oxidases, including a catalytic, transmembrane-spanning subunit (NOX). These enzymes are also involved in the oxidative burst of neutrophils [ , ].
Both, DPI and VAS-2870 have implications in the pharmacological inhibition of ROS generation. However, DPI is a general flavoprotein inhibitor, also inhibiting, for example, xanthine oxidase and eNOS, as well as cholinesterases and a calcium pump [ , ]. In contrast to DPI, the triazolo pyrimidine VAS-2870 does not inhibit other flavoproteins such as eNOS and xanthine oxidase [ ]. Taking the different target enzymes of DPI and VAS-2870 into account, we conclude from our results that tocilizumab not only indirectly but primarily affects the VAS-2870-sensitive NADPH oxidases in addition to other ROS-generating enzymes under normoxia. This is indicated by the correlation of the inhibitory effect of VAS-2870 with the unspecific acting DPI (Fig. 3 ). Interestingly, in hypoxic neutrophils, DPI inhibited the generation of ROS more effective than in normoxic neutrophils (Fig. 3 ). However, the increase in ROS generation and the increase in inhibitory effectiveness of VAS-2870 with regard to the tocilizumab treatment of normoxic neutrophils as well as the decrease in both in hypoxic neutrophils suggest an involvement of IL6 signalling in the regulation of NADPH oxidase activity. Therefore, an additional beneficial effect of tocilizumab seems to be the reduction in oxidative stress under the hypoxic conditions existing in arthritic joints similar to the observed beneficial effect of NADPH oxidase inhibition in a murine model of joint inflammation [ , ].
Moreover, we can demonstrate that not only survival, production of ROS and the removal of debris and pathogens by phagocytosis, but also cytokine and chemokine secretion are differentially affected by tocilizumab under hypoxic versus normoxic conditions. The well-known pro-inflammatory trigger of RA pathogenesis, TNFα, is also secreted by activated neutrophils [ ]. Here we observed that tocilizumab decreases TNFα under pathophysiological hypoxia, such as found in the arthritic joint, which supports the observed clinically beneficial decreased inflammatory response (Fig. 5 ). Moreover, we found the secretion of the neutrophil and monocyte chemo-attractants CCL3 [ ] and MIF [ , ] to be induced or unaffected, respectively, under pathophysiological hypoxic conditions similar to those observed in the inflamed synovium (Fig. 6 ). We therefore assume that hypoxic neutrophils may still support the recruitment of more neutrophils from the blood stream [ , ] but without enhancing their survival due to a reduction of CCL4 in the hypoxic situation of the inflamed area [ ]. The latter finding might give an explanation for the transient character of the higher incidences of neutropenia after tocilizumab treatment [ ]. However, the increase in IL6 serum levels observed after tocilizumab treatment may re-establish neutrophil release from the bone marrow [ ].
Taken together, we demonstrate that tocilizumab reduces the viability and the oxidative and phagocytotic activity of neutrophils, and induces their recruitment under inflammatory hypoxic conditions, such as those found in large regions of inflamed joints.
Given the crucial role of neutrophils in RA, we suggest that these effects contribute to the well-documented high therapeutic efficacy of tocilizumab for a number of reasons. Firstly, reduction in neutrophil viability by tocilizumab breaks the vicious circle of positive feedback from the numerical increase and/or activation of synovial neutrophils resulting in increased neutrophil recruitment to synovial tissue and fluid. Furthermore, reduction in neutrophil viability may lead to a reduction in PAD-4 mRNA, which is transcribed and translated by neutrophils during joint inflammation. As a consequence, pathogenic citrullination of synovial proteins in this compartment could be blunted (as reviewed in [ ]).
