Introduction
Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is an autoimmune inflammatory demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system (CNS), characterized by severe optic neuritis and longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (Drori and Chapman ; Wingerchuk et al. ). An epidemiological survey revealed that NMO had a higher prevalence in Asia and in other non-Caucasian populations (Pandit et al. ). The discovery of an aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) enabled differentiation between NMO and multiple sclerosis (MS) and has helped define NMO spectrum disorders (NMOSD). These encompass classical NMO and AQP4-IgG-seropositive patients with limited clinical syndromes (Wingerchuk et al. ). Although NMOSD are sporadic diseases, studies of familial cases and several association studies have suggested that genetic background contributed to NMOSD susceptibility (Asgari et al. ; Kim et al. , ; Matiello et al. ; Wang et al. ; Yamasaki et al. ; Yoshimine et al. ). Several genes conferring increased NMOSD risk have been identified, such as HLA , PD - 1 , CYP7A1, CD58 , and FCRL3 (Wang et al. ; Asgari et al. ; Kim et al. , ; Yamasaki et al. ). We have recently reported that the CD40 gene is associated with a higher risk of NMOSD (Shi et al. ). Notably, all of these genes are related to other autoimmune disorders. Although most researchers agree that AQP4-IgG-mediated autoimmune response is involved in the pathogenesis of NMOSD, its definite etiology and pathogenesis remain unclear.
The STAT4 gene encodes the signal transducer and activator of transcription factor 4 (STAT4), which belongs to the STAT family of transcription factors. STAT4 plays a crucial role in the functioning of innate and adaptive immune cells by promoting the proliferation of both T helper type 1 (Th1) and Th type 17 (Th17) cells (Mathur et al. ; Nishikomori et al. ). Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of STAT4 have been associated with increased risk of autoimmune disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), primary Sjögren’s syndrome (pSS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and thyroid disorders (Yan et al. a; Han et al. ; Li et al. ; Liang et al. ; Remmers et al. ). Therefore, we hypothesized that STAT4 might also indicate susceptibility to, and be implicated in, the pathogenesis of NMOSD. To our knowledge, no study has yet investigated the association between STAT4 and NMOSD. Here, we undertook a case–control study to determine whether STAT4 represented a susceptibility gene for NMOSD.
Materials and Methods
Participants
This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the West China Hospital, Sichuan University, and was performed in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants provided informed consent prior to their inclusion in this study.
A total of 725 participants were consecutively recruited from the Neurology Department of West China Hospital, Sichuan University, between September 2014 and June 2016. They included 233 patients with established NMOSD (207 females and 26 males) and 492 healthy controls (412 females and 80 males). All patients fulfilled the latest revised criteria (2015) for the diagnosis of NMOSD (Wingerchuk et al. ). None of the controls suffered from autoimmune diseases, tumors, nervous system diseases, or other common systemic diseases. All subjects were of Chinese Han descent and resided in the southwest of China. The demographics and clinical characteristics, such as gender, age, age at onset, disease duration, annual relapse rate (ARR), Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score (Kurtzke ), serum AQP4-IgG status (cell-based assay) (Jarius et al. ), core clinical syndromes, and MRI lesions, were recorded for each participant.
SNP Selection and Genotyping
Blood samples (3–5 mL) were collected from all subjects in tubes containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. DNA samples were extracted and purified with the AxyPrep™ Blood Genomic DNA Midiprep kit (Axygen, Union City, CA, USA) and were stored at −20 °C prior to use. Five STAT4 SNPs, namely rs10181656, rs7574865, rs7601754, rs10168266, and rs13426947, were selected for genotyping, based on previous studies of other autoimmune disorders. The positions of SNP loci on the chromosome are shown in Fig. 1 . SNP genotyping was performed using an improved multiplex ligation detection reaction (iMLDR) technique developed by Genesky Biotechnologies Inc. (Shanghai, China). Primer sequences used for SNPs genotyping by polymerase chain reaction are listed in Table 1 . A random sample accounting for ~5% ( n = 35) of the total DNA sample was tested again to confirm the results and consistency of the genotyping procedure. Finally, repeated sequencing samples were completely identical to those of the first sequencing results. Detailed information about the genotyping protocol can be found in our previous study (Shi et al. ). Fig. 1 Position of the five STAT4 SNPs investigated in this study. SNPs rs7574865 and rs10181656 were located in intron 3, whereas rs7601754, rs10168266, and rs13426947 were found in intron 4, intron 5, and intron 6, respectively Table 1 SNPs in STAT4 and primer sequences used for PCR amplification Rs_num SNP substitution Region Chr_Position Primer sequence rs7574865 G > T Intron 3 191,964,633 F: TGGTGTGGATGGAGGTAAGGAAAA R: AAAAAATCCCCTGAAATTCCACTGA rs10181656 C > G Intron 3 191,969,879 F: GGCCCCACAGAGACAGGGTAAC R: TTCTGGTGAGCAAGGGCAAAAG rs7601754 A > G Intron 4 191,940,451 F: GAAGAGGCAGAGTGGGAATGACA R: GTGCCACCATCCTTCCAGTCAC rs10168266 C > T Intron 5 191,935,804 F: CAGCACAGGTTGCTCAAAATTGGTA R: GCATGGACTTGGGCAAATGTCT rs13426947 A > G Intron 6 191,933,254 F:AGGAGAAGAACCCAAAACATCTCATCTTCA R:ATGAAGGGGAAGAGAACATTTACAAGTCCT
Statistical Analysis
Differences in gender and age between NMOSD patients and healthy controls were compared by Pearson’s Chi-square test and Student’s t test, respectively. Deviations from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) were determined for all SNPs by Chi-square tests, with P values greater than 0.05 indicating no significant deviation in allele or genotype distribution among the subjects. Chi-square tests and logistic regression analyses were performed with four genetic models, including allelic, additive, dominant, and recessive models, to identify associations with NMOSD. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to assess the risk of NMOSD. Confounding factors, such as gender and age, were adjusted by logistic regression analysis. The results of multiple test comparisons were corrected using the FDR-BH (Benjamini and Hochberg ). All statistical analyses were performed with PLINK v1.07 ( http://pngu.mgh.harvard . edu/~ purcell/plink/) and SPSS version 21.0 software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). STAT4 linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns and haplotype analysis were conducted using SHEsis software ( http://analysis.bio-x.cn/myAnalysis.php ) (Shi and He ). P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Association of STAT4 SNPs with NMOSD
Allele and genotype frequencies of the five SNPs found among NMOSD patients and controls are shown in Table 4 . Results from logistic regression analyses were adjusted for gender and age. The minor allele frequency of rs7574865 T was overrepresented in the patient group (0.44) compared with that in the control group (0.32) and was significantly associated with increased risk of NMOSD (OR = 1.66, 95% CI 1.32–2.08, P = 1.23 × 10 −5 , P corr = 0.000). Three polymorphisms, rs10181656, rs10168266, and rs13426947, were also significantly associated with increased NMOSD risk in the allele models (rs10181656 G, OR = 1.62, 95% CI 1.29–2.03, P = 3.01 × 10 −5 , P corr = 0.000; rs10168266 T, OR = 1.59, 95% CI 1.27–2.00, P = 5.91 × 10 −5 , P corr = 0.001; and rs13426947 A, OR = 1.51, 95% CI 1.21–1.90, P = 0.000, P corr = 0.004). Identical associations of these four SNPs were detected in the dominant, recessive, and additive models. In contrast, the minor allele of rs7601754 G showed a protective effect against NMOSD (OR = 0.53, 95% CI 0.36–0.76, P = 0.001, P corr = 0.006). All statistical powers used for allele comparisons were above 0.9. Detailed values are presented in Table 4 .

Haplotype Analysis of STAT4 Polymorphisms in NMOSD and Controls
Haplotype analysis was performed for the four SNPs in LD (rs10168266, rs10181656, rs13426947, and rs7574865). Two haplotypes (CCGG and TGAT) were significantly associated with NMOSD after exclusion of haplotypes with frequency >0.05. The haplotype TGAT showed a significant association with increased risk of NMOSD (OR = 1.65), whereas CCGG was associated with protection against NMOSD (OR = 0.61) (Table 5 ).

Discussion
We have conducted a case–control study of a Chinese cohort and demonstrated that four STAT4 SNPs—rs7574865, rs10181656, rs10168266, and rs13426947—conferred increased risk of NMOSD. In contrast, the rs7601754 variant showed a protective effect against NMOSD. Although STAT4 has been identified as a susceptibility gene for numerous autoimmune diseases, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to indicate that STAT4 polymorphisms are associated with susceptibility to NMOSD.
STAT4 is mainly expressed in testis, lymphoid, and myeloid tissues. Phosphorylated STAT4 can translocate to the nucleus and regulate gene expression (Korman et al. ). A large body of evidence indicates that STAT4 is activated by interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23, inducing the differentiation of CD40 + T cells into Th1 and Th17 cells and the production of interferon- γ (IFN- γ ) and IL-17, respectively (Watford et al. ; Korman et al. ). The Th1 pathway is regarded as the most important proinflammatory mediator of pathogenesis during MS, whereas the Th17 pathway is considered to be implicated in the pathogenic mechanisms of both MS and NMOSD (Dos et al. ). Furthermore, pathogenic autoreactive Th17 cells can cross the blood brain barrier by inducing a large number of chemokines and recruiting inflammatory cells and thus cause an inflammatory response in the CNS (Dos et al. ). Importantly, previous studies have showed increased Th17 cells and IL-17 in the cerebrospinal fluid and blood of patients with NMOSD during relapse (Wang et al. ; Ishizu et al. ). In fact, Th17 cells have been identified that it is highly proinflammatory and induces severe autoimmunity and diseases (Bettelli et al. ). Therefore, it is conceivable that dysregulated expression and activation of STAT4 can be involved in the pathogenesis of NMOSD through alterations in Th17 cell differentiation and IL-17 production. In addition, experimental models of autoimmunity have shown that STAT-deficient lupus-like mice models suffer more severe nephritis and increased mortality (Jacob et al. ), but develop less severe arthritis and produce fewer IL-6, tumor necrosis factor, and IL-17 than control animals (Hildner et al. ). In addition, targeting of STAT4 to suppress STAT4 expression in arthritis models alleviated the symptoms (Hildner et al. ). These findings support a correlation between STAT4 and disease development and suggest the use of STAT4 as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of autoimmune disorders.
Numerous genetic association studies have indicated that STAT4 variants are associated with increased risk of multiple autoimmune diseases (Yan et al. a; Han et al. ; Li et al. ; Remmers et al. ). In the present study, we found that the STAT4 rs7574865 variant conferred the highest risk of NMOSD (OR = 1.66), followed by the rs10181656, rs10168266, and rs13426947 variants. Indeed, a large study in Sweden identified rs7574865 as a risk factor for both SLE (OR = 1.55) and RA (OR = 1.32) (Remmers et al. ). The strong association was further confirmed by a meta-analysis in European and Asian populations (Yuan et al. ). Another study reported that STAT4 rs7574865 and rs10181656 polymorphisms increased the risk of autoimmune thyroid diseases in a Chinese population (Yan et al. a). In addition, the STAT4 rs10168266 and rs13426947 variants were confirmed as risk factors for pSS in a genome-wide association study of Chinese populations (Li et al. ). In contrast, SNP rs7601754 conferred a protective effect against NMOSD (OR = 0.53); a similar effect was also detected in SLE (OR = 0.67) (Yuan et al. ). In addition, Yang et al. ( ) confirmed the association of STAT4 with SLE (rs7574865, OR = 1.71, P = 3.55 × 10 −23 ; rs7601754, OR = 0.59, P = 1.39 × 10 −9 ), which was similar to our findings. The discrepant results might be attributed to the strong linkage among the four risk SNPs, where the protective SNP is in a locus in a distinct block that is far from others. Although these SNPs are located in the STAT4 gene, they may have different contributions to NMOSD. These findings indicate that the STAT4 gene is involved in multiple autoimmune diseases but that different SNPs may result in distinct susceptibility to diseases.
Given that all of the variants identified in this study are located in introns and are not directly involved in the transcription and translation of STAT4 , the molecular mechanism of STAT4 involvement in the pathogenesis of NMOSD remains to be determined. Lamana et al. ( ) found significant association between the T allele of rs7574865 and high STAT4 mRNA transcription and protein expression. This may enhance signaling through the STAT4 pathway (Lamana et al. ). However, whether rs7601754 is related to downregulation of STAT4 remains to be determined. Given that NMOSD have complex genetic backgrounds, no single gene could independently trigger the autoimmune response and be alone responsible for NMOSD pathogenesis. In addition to STAT4 , multiple non-HLA genes, such as PD - 1 , CYP7A1, CD58 , FCRL3 , and CD40 , have been shown to be associated with increased NMOSD risk; most of these genes have been implicated in other autoimmune diseases. Overall, these findings suggest that multiple genes are involved in the pathogenesis of NMOSD and that autoimmune diseases have common genetic risk factors.
There are some limitations to our study. The sample size and number of patients with NMOSD were relatively small; however, it was larger than those in previous NMOSD association studies. Given that all participants were recruited from the southwest of China and were of Chinese Han ethnicity, the relationship between STAT4 gene polymorphisms and NMOSD should be verified also in other ethnic groups. Finally, we only sequenced five STAT4 SNPs. Therefore, some functional variants from other regions may have been neglected.
Conclusions
This study identifies a novel gene, STAT4 , which plays a key role in the development of autoimmune diseases, associated with risk of NMOSD. Our findings also reveal that NMOSD share several common risk genes with other autoimmune disorders and provide novel insights into the underlying mechanisms of this disease. Nevertheless, additional studies are required to confirm these findings in larger samples of various ethnicities. Moreover, the mechanism through which STAT4 is involved in the pathogenesis of NMOSD requires detailed elucidation.
