Introduction
In the last few decades, psychotropic drugs have become a staple in paediatric mental disorder treatment. However, epidemiological studies show that the prevalence of prescription of these drugs varies widely in different areas of the world [ , ]. The prevalence of mental disorders cannot explain alone up to tenfold or more differences in the prevalence of prescription (e.g. antipsychotics or ADHD medications in North America compared with most European countries) [ , ]. This evidence has prompted various reactions from both the academic world and lay people. First, there is concern that children may currently be over-treated in some parts of the world, and second, that the prevalence of psychotropic drugs may be increasing [ ]. On the other hand, in some European countries, psychotropic medications are prescribed so rarely that it seems probable that not all children who could benefit receive them [ ]. Given the considerable debate surrounding psychopharmacological treatments in paediatrics, several drug utilization studies have been done in the last two decades. Monitoring the prevalence of prescriptions at the population level is a powerful tool for measuring the effectiveness of policies, interventions, and trends. There are, however, some challenges in evaluating and comparing prevalence studies conducted in different countries. For example, there are many differences in the structure of healthcare systems, drug approval, policy, regulation, and access to mental health services [ , ]. Since licensing of psychotropic drugs in children and adolescents differs widely in the world, so does their off-label use [ , ]. Moreover, so far the effects of sampling have not been considered sufficiently when comparing prevalence data across countries [ ]. The majority of studies are based on surveys or local samples from a circumscribed area with often unknown representativeness. All these factors are important if the aim is to compare prevalence across countries.
The aim of the current study was to answer two research questions: (1) What is the overall prevalence estimate of prescriptions of ADHD medications, antidepressants, antipsychotics, sedative/hypnotics, and anxiolytics in children and adolescents? (2) Have prevalence estimates changed recently?
To answer these questions, we made a systematic review and meta-analysis of pharmacoepidemiological studies on prescription databases on the prevalence of psychotropic drugs in children and adolescents. We also assessed the risk of bias associated with the different sampling frames, the national representativeness, and the quality of reporting. Studies published after 2007 were analysed so as to update and expand previous reviews [ , ].
Methods
Data sources and searches
We systematically searched Medline, Embase and PsycINFO databases from 1 January 2007 to 31 March 2018, to retrieve studies reporting of prevalence data on paediatric psychotropic drugs (antidepressants, antipsychotics, ADHD medications, anxiolytics, and hypnotics/sedatives) since 2005.
Search terms included “drug utilization”, pharmacoepidemiology, “drug prescription(s)”, “prescription prevalence”, “prescribing prevalence” and “annual prevalence” as relevant Mesh and Emtree terms and in titles and abstracts, and prescription(s), prescribing and “medication use” in titles. The search was combined with psychotropic(s), psychopharmacologic, antidepressant(s), antidepressive(s), antipsychotic(s), sedative(s), hypnotic(s), benzodiazepine(s), serotonin reuptake inhibitors, SSRI, ADHD, psychostimulant(s), stimulant(s), attention-deficit/hyperactivity, and attention-deficit hyperactivity, in titles and as relevant Mesh and Emtree terms. The search was further combined with children, childhood, adolescence, adolescent(s), paediatric(s), paediatric, and infant(s) in titles and abstracts, and as relevant Mesh and Emtree terms.
We excluded studies conducted in hospitals; those on non-medical drug use, addiction, or abuse; those on pregnancy or pregnant women; and those on suicide and self-harm, case reports, editorials, commentaries, lecture, and congresses. The complete Medline search can be found in Supplemental table 1 . No language or age restrictions were imposed.
Study selection
The titles and abstracts of identified articles were screened to exclude irrelevant studies. Two reviewers, DP and AC, abstracted the data independently. The full text of the selected articles was retrieved and read. The bibliographies of the articles and reviews were scanned. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they: Were original studies conducted on prescription databases (surveys were excluded for homogeneity) Reported the annual prevalence for antidepressants, antipsychotics, ADHD medications, anxiolytics and/or sedative/hypnotics, or one or more of their subclasses (e.g. only SSRIs, or only atypical antipsychotics) Were conducted on children and adolescents not older than 19 years, or, if conducted on the overall population, included prevalence data stratified by age for the paediatric population (studies exclusively on pre-schoolers were excluded because the use of psychotropic drugs in this population is negligible) Reported the number of prevalent cases and the denominator, or it was possible to calculate them with acceptable accuracy
Data extraction
The following information was collected from each study: first author’s last name; country/countries; year of publication; sample size for the overall study and by age strata; annual prevalence for the most recent year available; prevalent cases; drug class/classes included. When available, prevalence data was evaluated by sex. In case of incomplete data (e.g. number of prevalent cases or sample size was missing), the first or last author was contacted in order to have access to the raw data.
Psychotropic drugs were defined according to the World Health Organization categories and comprised the following subgroups of the Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system: antipsychotics (N05A), antidepressants (N06A), centrally acting sympathomimetics (ADHD medications, N06BA), anxiolytics (N05B), and sedative/hypnotics (N05C). Prevalence data regarding other subclasses of psychotropic drugs were reported in some studies (e.g. herbal remedies for depression, other pharmacological treatments for ADHD, benzodiazepines, z-hypnotics, etc.). These data were collected but not included in the meta-analyses.
Risk of bias
Risk of bias was assessed using a modified tool developed by Hoy et al. for assessing this variable in prevalence studies [ ]. Since we included only prevalence studies conducted on prescription databases, the items 4 to 8 (non-response-bias, data collected directly from subjects, case definition, reliability and validity of measurement, same mode of data collection for all subjects) were not relevant for this meta-analysis. Concerning item 9 (appropriate length of the shortest prevalence period reported), only studies with at least 1 year of observation and reporting annual prevalence were included. Overall, the risk of bias assessment included items regarding the representativeness of the sample, sampling frame, random selection or census, and reporting of appropriate numerator and denominator.
A study was considered to have a high overall risk of bias if < 3 criteria were met, moderate risk of bias if 3 criteria were met, and low risk of bias if 4 criteria were met. In case of multinational studies including data from different databases, the lowest score was attributed to the study and each prevalence data was evaluated for national representativeness. Disagreements among reviewers were discussed, and agreement was reached by consensus.
Meta-analysis
Each class of psychotropic drug was investigated separately. The outcome considered was the annual prescription prevalence for the most recent year available.
In the first phase were considered only studies reporting data for the overall paediatric population. In order to compare homogeneous studies, only those reporting prevalence for an age interval starting from 0 to 3 years old to a maximum of 17 to 19 years were initially considered. For ADHD medications, studies including data for amphetamines and derivatives were considered separately. For antidepressants and antipsychotics, studies with a maximum age of 17 years were considered separately from those with a maximum of 19 years because, in late adolescence, the prevalence rises considerably, and the two age intervals may be not comparable.
We considered only the most representative and/or recent study from each country, for each drug class. Only one study for each country (for each drug class) was analysed. In case of uncertainty, the study with the lowest score in risk of bias assessment was considered. Studies reporting the trends of psychotropic drugs in each single country were also qualitatively reported.
Other meta-analyses were done on the following subgroups: adolescents, school-age children, and children and adolescents excluding pre-schoolers (5–7 to 17 years old) in the group of studies reporting the prevalence of ADHD medications.
The Freeman-Tukey transformation (arcsine square root transformation) was used to calculate the weighted summary proportion under the random effects model [ , ]. MedCalc Statistical Software version 18.2.1 (MedCalc Software bvba, Ostend, Belgium; http://www.medcalc.org ; 2018) was used for the meta-analyses.

Fig. 1 Flow diagram of bibliographic search and study selection
The characteristics of the included studies are provided in Supplemental table 2 . Six of the 59 articles were multinational studies [ , , , , , ], and 53 gave data on a single country. The prevalence data for at least one class was reported for 23 countries. Europe was the most represented area (42 studies), followed by North America; fewer studies were retrieved from Asia and Oceania. One Colombian study represented South America, and no studies were retrieved from Africa. The most represented countries were Germany (12 studies), Denmark, Norway, UK, and USA (8), The Netherlands (7), Canada (5), Finland, and Iceland (4).
Ten studies were conducted on the general population but included paediatric prevalence data. Eleven studies included data starting from 5 or 6 years of age, mostly on ADHD medications [ , , , , , , , , , , ]. Of the 15 studies containing prevalence data stratified by age groups, very different intervals were reported. Two were done only in adolescents [ , ], and two others only in school-age children [ , ]. Ten studies did not report prevalence data by sex, and 11 reported prevalence data stratified by age, but not for the entire study population, or only reported partial data (Table 1 and Supplemental table 2 ).

Figure 2 reports the studies included in this review by drug class and year of publication. The number of studies retrieved increased in recent years: most studies (34/59) were published in the last 3 years. Fig. 2 Studies reporting paediatric psychotropic drug prevalence by drug class and year of publication (studies investigating more than one drug class are counted more times). For 2018, only the first trimester was considered. Anx Hyp, anxiolytics-hypnotics; ADHD, medicine for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; AP, antipsychotics; AD, antidepressants
Twenty-four studies (41%) were at low risk of bias, 17 were at moderate risk (29%), and 18 were at high risk (30%). Most studies were conducted on a nationally representative sample (question one, 38/59; 64%). Four of six multinational studies were considered at high risk of bias according to the predetermined criteria. The risk of bias scores are illustrated in supplemental figure 1 .
Overall paediatric population
Table 1 lists the 33 studies reporting data for the overall paediatric population (from age 0–3 up until 17–19 years) by drug class. We found 18 studies for antipsychotics, 16 for antidepressants, 12 for ADHD medications (in addition to 8 studies from 5–7 to 17 years of age), and 5 for anxiolytics and/or sedative/hypnotics. The global pooled prevalence by class considering only the most recent studies by country (22 studies) is summarised in Table 2 . Heterogeneity was extremely wide in all the meta-analyses ( I 2 > 99%).

ADHD medications
Among the 12 studies on ADHD medications, USA and Germany were the most represented countries (3 studies), followed by Denmark (2 studies). The study-specific prevalence ranged from 0.19‰ in Italy [ ] to 53‰ in USA [ ]. Considering the most recent data for each country (7 studies, 11 countries), the random-effect pooled prevalence was 15.31‰ (95%CI, 7.59–25.66). There were no studies at high risk of bias in this meta-analysis. Prevalence by sex was available only in 4 studies (8 countries) and was on average much higher in males (19.74‰, 95%CI, 6.52 to 39.9) than females (6.40‰, 95%CI, 2.00–13.25). The random-effect pooled prevalence was 7.2‰ (95%CI, 1.48–17.17‰) in 5 countries where amphetamine and derivatives were not approved, and 24.01‰ (95%CI 13.45–37.53) in 7 countries where they were approved (Fig. 3 ). Fig. 3 Meta-analysis of the most recent studies on the prevalence of ADHD medications in children and adolescents (A) in countries/studies in which amphetamines and derivatives were not approved/not included, and (B) in countries/studies in which amphetamines and derivatives were approved and included. Note: in Germany, dexamphetamine was approved in 2011 and two studies were analysed. The first (2007) was included in the first meta-analysis (A), and the second (2012) was included in the second meta-analysis (B)
Eight studies (11 countries) excluding the pre-school age (5–7 to 15–17 years old) were collected [ , , , , , , , ]. Similarly to previous studies, the pooled prevalence considering only countries in which amphetamine and derivatives were approved (31.67‰; 95%CI 21.44–43.82) was higher than in countries where they were not (11.16‰; 95%CI 5.19–19.36).
A total of 11/12 studies reported prevalence trends, but only 5 of these (7 countries) gave prevalence trends until 2012 or more recently. Bachmann and colleagues showed a larger increase in prevalence in The Netherlands, Germany, UK, and Denmark compared with a moderate rise in USA [ ]. Other studies showed the greatest rises in prevalence before 2009–2010, and moderate increases in the last few years until 2014–2015 in USA, Canada, and Norway [ , , ]. Studies investigating the entire paediatric population with the exclusion of pre-schoolers showed similar data. Furu and colleagues showed a large, steady rise in prevalence from 2008 to 2012 in Iceland, Finland, and Sweden, whereas in Norway the increase was moderate, and in Denmark prevalence levelled off from 2010 [ ].
Studies stratified by age
Seven studies (11 countries) reported the prevalence of ADHD medications in school-age children, but with very different age intervals (from 5–9 to 6–12 years old), ranging from 0.29‰ in Italy [ ] to 50.8‰ in USA [ ]. The pooled prevalence tended to be higher in countries where amphetamines were approved (21.71‰; 95%CI, 12.64–33.16), compared with those where they were not (8.49‰; 95%CI, 1.28 to 21.96).
Five studies (9 countries) reported the prevalence of ADHD medications in adolescents, ranging from 0.3‰ in Italy [ ] to 88‰ in USA [ ]. No meta-analysis was done because most studies differed widely in the age intervals.
Antidepressants
Overall paediatric population
Of the 16 studies on antidepressants, Germany was the most represented country (4 studies), followed by Denmark, Italy, The Netherlands, and UK (2 studies). Thirteen studies were included in the meta-analyses: 9 studies (9 countries) considered children and adolescents until 17 years of age, and 4 studies (7 countries) until 19 years. The overall random-effect pooled prevalence, irrespective of age intervals, was 6.35‰ (95%CI, 4.34–8.73‰). The pooled prevalence was similar (5.95 ‰; 95%CI, 3.83–8.53) when excluding studies at high risk of bias and considering only nationally representative data from the multinational study [ ]. Prevalence by sex was available only in 5 studies (9 countries) and was on average higher in females (7.69‰, 95%CI 3.61–13.29‰) than males (4.51‰, 95%CI 2.56–7.00‰).
Among studies reporting the prevalence until 17 years of age, the random-effect pooled prevalence was 4.42‰ (95%CI, 2.81–6.39‰), whereas it was 9.33‰ (95%CI, 6.79–12.26‰) considering studies reporting the prevalence until 19 years of age (Fig. 4 ). Only 4 studies (4 countries) reported prevalence data on sub-classes of antidepressants in the whole paediatric population. The pooled prevalence of SSRIs was non-significantly higher (3.22‰, 95%CI, 0.85–7.11‰) than that of tricyclic antidepressants (2.58‰, 95%CI, 0.561–6.05), but data were scarce and dated. Fig. 4 Meta-analysis of the studies on the prevalence of antidepressants in children and adolescents considering the most recent study by country (A) up to age 17, and (B) up to age 19
A total of 11/14 studies reported annual prevalence trends, while 5 (7 countries) reported them up until 2012 or more recently. A multinational study reported an increasing trend in USA, UK, Germany, Denmark, and the Netherlands [ ], while other studies reported a U-shaped trend in Germany [ ], Norway [ ], and UK [ ], with prevalence decreasing in 2006–2008 and rapidly rising afterwards. The prevalence of SSRI increased moderately in Germany [ ] and Ireland [ ], and more rapidly in Denmark [ ].
Studies stratified by age
Six studies (10 countries) reported the prevalence of antidepressants in school-age children. The random-effect pooled prevalence was 1.38‰ (95%CI, 0.84–2.06), and the prevalence ranged from 0.3‰ in UK to 8.8‰ in USA [ ]. Although eight studies (10 countries) reported the prevalence in adolescents, only five reported homogeneous data as regards age. One study (5 countries) reported data on 10–14-year-old children (pooled-prevalence 7.22‰; 95%CI, 3.82–11.67) and 15–19-year-olds (29.29‰; 95%CI 19.13–41.53) [ ]. Four other studies reported data for adolescents 11–12 to 17 years old (4.87 ‰; 95%CI, 2.47–8.07), ranging from 2.66 ‰ in Italy [ ] to 7.4‰ in Taiwan [ ].
Antipsychotics
Overall paediatric population
Of the 18 studies on antipsychotics, Germany was the most represented country (5 studies), followed by The Netherlands and Denmark (3 studies). Four studies (19 countries) were included in the meta-analysis. The random-effect pooled prevalence was 5.49‰ (95%CI, 3.60–7.77‰), ranging from 0.5‰ in Lithuania to 30.8‰ in Taiwan (Fig. 5 ) [ ]. The pooled prevalence was lower (3.84‰; 95%CI, 2.35–5.69) when excluding high risk of bias studies and considering only nationally representative data from the multinational study [ ]. A sensitivity analysis did not show any difference in the pooled prevalence when stratifying the studies by age (up to 17–18 years compared with those reporting prevalence data up to 19 years of age). Prevalence was on average higher in males (7.19‰, 95%CI 4.61–10.35) than females (4.36‰, 95%CI 2.59–6.59). Fig. 5 Meta-analysis of the studies on the prevalence of antipsychotics in children and adolescents considering the most recent study by country
A total of 13/16 studies reported prevalence trends for antipsychotics, but only four reported them until 2012 or more recently. Two were German and showed a slight to moderate increase [ , ]. A Norwegian study showed an increase in prevalence up until 2011 followed by a plateau, or slightly decreasing trend [ ]. There was a steep decreasing trend until 2013 in USA [ ]. A large increase in prevalence was seen for atypical antipsychotics in the last decade in German studies [ , ], South Korea [ ], and Canada [ ], only partly counterbalanced by drops in typical antipsychotics.
Studies stratified by age
Of the five studies reporting prevalence in school-age children, three used comparable age intervals. Prevalence ranged from 0.49 ‰ in Italy [ ] to 21.7 ‰ in Taiwan [ ]. Prevalence in adolescents ranged from 1.58 to 29.2‰ in the same studies and countries.
Anxiolytics and sedative/hypnotics
The five studies reporting data on anxiolytics and sedative/hypnotics were European. The prevalence of sedative/hypnotics ranged from 2.59‰ in Iceland [ ] to 9.8‰ in Norway [ ], and that of anxiolytics from 0.33‰ in Denmark [ ] to 3.9‰ In Norway [ ].
Four of the five studies reported prevalence trends, but only two gave them until 2012 or more recently. The sedative/hypnotics prevalence was decreasing in Germany [ ], and increasing in Norway [ ], while anxiolytics prevalence showed a slight decrease in both countries. Data for adolescents and school-age children were very scarce, and not comparable.
Discussion
We conducted the first meta-analysis on the global pooled prevalence of psychotropic drugs in children and adolescents. The prevalence of prescription varied widely across countries. Most studies were published in the last 3 years, attesting to the growing interest in monitoring the prescription of these drugs in paediatrics. Compared with previous reviews on the topic, this analysis confirms that Europe and North America continue to be the most represented areas, though currently most studies are European [ , ]. The reporting methodology differed widely across studies and was not improved significantly over time. Prevalence data was often reported using non-comparable age intervals, especially for school-age children or adolescents. Only small numbers of studies investigated sub-classes of psychotropic drugs, and most of them reported old data. Not all the studies gave information by sex, even though this is recognised as one of the most important variables for improving the homogeneity of reporting in pharmacoepidemiologic studies [ ]. This is particularly important for specific psychotropic drug classes, those with close prevalence in males and females.
Most studies were at moderate to high risk of bias, and a significant proportion reported non-nationally representative data. Systematic monitoring is still lacking in most countries, and throughout Africa. All these factors limited the comparison of prevalence across studies, and their synthesis.
ADHD medications
ADHD medications were confirmed as the most prescribed class of psychotropic drugs globally (about 1.5%). Some exceptions were found in Europe, notably in France, and in Italy [ , , ]. The global prevalence of ADHD is estimated at 5.3–7.2% [ , ]. However, three out of four ADHD studies in our sample were European and there is agreement that, in Europe, the disease prevalence is about 5% [ , ]. This means that, based on the most recent prescription data, about one out of three or four diagnosed patients would be pharmacologically treated globally, ranging from about one treated out 100 diagnosed children in Italy to about one out of two in Germany.
Large increases were found in the prevalence of ADHD medications up until at least 2010 in most countries. This was generally followed by a reduction of the increase in USA and Canada, and also in Norway indicating a probable “ceiling effect” (i.e. saturation with ADHD medication prescription) in countries already having a higher prevalence of prescription [ , ].
Prevalence was higher in countries where amphetamine and derivatives were approved, than in countries where they were not. It is hard to understand the real reason. First, the difference may be due to the fact that amphetamines are approved in countries with a broader attitude to the use of psychotropic drugs over the whole lifespan [ ], or second, the approval of amphetamines may itself be a driver of higher prevalence. In USA, the stimulant’s potential for abuse as a cognitive enhancer is recognised both in ADHD patients, who are willing to exaggerate symptoms in order to get more drug, and in students with or without prescription [ ]. A nationwide survey showed that one out of five young adults declared they used or had used stimulants to boost academic or work performance (New Survey). These problems have been known for more than a decade in North America, are very hard to tackle, and are among the most important reasons for enforcing systematic monitoring.
Antidepressants
The global pooled-prevalence of antidepressants was about 0.6%, with the highest in Iceland (2%) and North America (1.5%), and the lowest in Italy (about 0.1%). SSRIs accounted for the majority of antidepressants prescribed globally, and the few studies investigating their trends observed increases. In 2004, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a safety warning about the twofold higher risk of suicidal behaviour in adolescents receiving antidepressants, particularly SSRIs [ ]. Data suggest that, in most countries, the trend for antidepressants was increasing or U-shaped, with prevalence rising again after 2008–2010, and in some cases stabilizing at slightly lower values than those at the beginning of the 2000s.
A significant effect of age was found. In a sub-analysis, we stratified the studies reporting the prevalence up to 17 years of age, and those reporting prevalence up to 19, finding the prevalence was almost double higher among the latter. Antidepressants are among the psychotropic drugs with the largest increase in prevalence in late adolescence (even exponential) [ , ].
As a methodological note, for antidepressants, only studies reporting the same age intervals should be considered, particularly for one-on-one comparisons.
Antipsychotics
The global prevalence estimate of antipsychotics was about 0.5%, with the highest in Taiwan and the USA (about 3%), and the lowest in Lithuania and Italy (< 0.1%). The few studies investigating antipsychotics by class showed that the ratio of atypical to typical antipsychotics increased considerably in the study period, confirming that atypical drugs were the prevalent treatment. Antipsychotics have drawn particular attention for their side-effects, large proportion of off-label use, and lack of long-term studies [ ]. In recent years, in some countries such as USA and The Netherlands, the reduction of antipsychotic prescribing in youth has become a priority [ , ].
Anxiolytics and sedative/hypnotics
The results for anxiolytics and sedative/hypnotics were severely limited by the lack of data, as few studies were comparable. The greatest variability was for sedative-hypnotics, though only few European studies were analysed. Some were excluded because of heterogeneity in the definition of an “anxiolytic”, a “sedative/hypnotic”, or a benzodiazepine drug. Furthermore, few studies reported data for comparable age intervals. These drugs have addiction potential, and their medical or non-medical use in adolescents has been associated with a two- to threefold higher risk of substance use disorders in adulthood. For these reasons, the lack of monitoring in most countries is worrying.
Strengths and weaknesses
The study has some strengths. It gives the first estimates of the global prevalence of psychotropic drugs in paediatrics. The analyses were conducted by grouping the studies by comparable age intervals, and the global pooled-prevalence was calculated considering the most recent and representative data available for each country. The risk of bias was evaluated with particular attention to national representativeness. The pooled prevalence was also computed by excluding high risk of bias studies, showing that sometimes the global estimates did not change (i.e. antidepressants), while in others the difference was meaningful (i.e. antipsychotics). Only big data from prescription databases were included in an attempt to improve methodological homogeneity, and to provide meaningful estimates. This last point can also be seen as a limitation of the study, because surveys were excluded.
Another limitation is the imbalance of the data collected, as already stated, which over-represents Europe compared with other areas of the world. Also, the prevalence data retrieved from systems with partially reimbursable drugs and private insurances may vary considerably in relation to the share of reimbursement and type of insurance. Further limitation is that we did not include data from most child and adolescent mental health services, because, in those studies, it is very difficult to obtain annual prevalence data.
Despite the precautions taken to include the most homogeneous and comparable studies, there were cases in which the differences among countries reached a hundredfold, indicating extreme heterogeneity. The review also showed that there are specific areas in the world where psychotropic drugs are prescribed to children much more commonly (e.g. USA, Canada, Iceland, Taiwan), independently from the class of drug considered. There are also large differences within the same continent: for example in the Mediterranean areas of Europe, psychotropic drugs are prescribed much less frequently than in most Nordic countries.
In part, differences between countries may be related to drug regulation (e.g. prescription versus over the counter drugs). The fact that melatonin is a prescription drug in Norway may explain the highest prevalence of sedative/hypnotics reported in this country [ ]. St John’s wort can be reimbursed in Germany if prescribed by a physician, and this can have influenced the estimated prevalence of antidepressant prescription.
As other authors have pointed out, most of the differences across countries can be ascribed to heterogeneity in the diagnostic processes, policies, regulations, access to mental health services, guidelines, cultural perceptions, the role of non-pharmacologic alternatives, and the uncertainty of indications (i.e. difficulty in placing cut-offs for the prescription of a drug) [ , , ]. Besides these factors, there are also differences in the prevalence of mental disorders, particularly across contexts with different levels of socio-economic well-being [ , ]. The sum of all these circumstances in some countries facilitates over-diagnose, over-prescription, or even addiction, while allowing under-diagnosis and/or the preference for alternative treatments elsewhere.
As a final remark, as we noted, off-label prescription of psychotropic drugs is particularly common in paediatrics. However, since regulations for approval have grey areas in many parts of the world, what should be encouraged is evidence-based and rational use of psychotropic drugs, independently from licensing [ ].
Conclusions
We have provided global estimates of the paediatric prevalence of ADHD medications, antipsychotics, antidepressants, anxiolytics and sedative/hypnotics. The role of psychopharmacological treatments in youth is debated in many countries. There are still unresolved questions such as long-term safety issues, addressing not rational use, the potential for abuse and the growing scarcity of resources that may hinder or delay access to healthcare services. Different countries suffer more from some issues than others, and the balance of these circumstances ultimately affects the prevalence of the drugs. Although monitoring prevalence at the population level is the most powerful tool for measuring the effectiveness of policies and interventions, systematic monitoring is still lacking in most countries. Even though more studies have been published in recent years, and this is welcome, the quality of reporting needs to be improved.
