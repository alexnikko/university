Introduction
Currently, the only therapies for acute ischemic stroke patients are the administration of t-PA [ ] or the combination of t-PA with endovascular treatment [ ]. Unfortunately, up to 25% of total stroke subjects are ineligible for recanalization therapies (RT) due to unknown time of symptom onset [ , , ]. As a result, these patients have more severe events and poorer outcomes than patients with an exact known time of stroke onset [ , ]. To give patients with wake-up stroke or unknown stroke onset the best current therapy, it is mandatory to develop tools to predict time after onset. Thus, discovering biomarkers (BM) identifying the time after stroke is essential to be able to extend the use of RT to these patients.
Additionally, many times, the diagnosis of transient ischemia is difficult as many neurologic and non-neurologic conditions mimic TIA symptoms [ ]. Therefore, BM that could guide the diagnostic workup of patients with transient symptoms will be also welcome.
The recently developed model of transient focal cerebral ischemia for inducing selective neuronal death by compression of the distal middle cerebral artery (dMCAc) mode in mice [ ] that avoids aggressive invasive techniques could be an excellent platform to perform studies of BMs in transient brain ischemia. Additionally, the widespread use of the “omics” as transcriptomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, and proteomics [ , ] has enabled a quantum leap forward for BM discovering. Our group has previously used metabolomic analysis to identify biomarkers related to neuroimaging [ ], etiology, and risk of stroke recurrence in TIA patients [ ]. With the same metabolomic approach, current work aims to identify specific BMs for helping on TIA diagnosis and for estimating the time of stroke onset using high-precision mice ischemia model.
Methods
Animal Surgery
Animals were caged individually and maintained at 22 ± 2 °C in a 12 h light 12 h dark cycle. Animals were randomly distributed by an animal house technician assigning equally the littermates between different experimental groups; no differences on weight, blood flow reduction, or food consumption were detected between groups. To set up ischemia times, six times points (3, 7, 15, 25, 35, and 45 min) with three animals per time (18 animals) were tested.
After setting up ischemia time, to obtain plasma for metabolomic analysis, a total of 18 animals were used for the first discovering cohort, 6 for each group, since previously, 4 mice were enough to find statistically significant differences [ ]. A second cohort for validation of TIA BM consisted of 12 animals (6 TIA and 6 sham). All animal experiments were approved by the animal ethics committee of Universitat de Lleida.
Surgery was performed as described previously [ ], with minor modifications: male mice (4 months old, CD1 strain) weighing 28–36 g were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane. The body temperature was kept constant at 37 ± 0.3 °C with a thermal blanket and rectal probe. A pulse oximeter monitoring cardiac frequency (bpm) and tissue oxygen saturation was employed. Animals with oxygen saturation ≤ 97%, bpm outside the 350–500 range, and with brain hemorrhagic lesion during surgery were excluded.
Animals were then immobilized on a stereotactic platform and an incision between the right eye and right ear was done to expose the temporalis muscle. The MCA was visually identified after removing the temporalis muscle and exposing the squamous part of the temporal bone. A piece of bone of about 3 mm 2 was removed with the help of a microdrill to expose the MCA. A flexible fiber optic probe attached to a laser Doppler flowmeter (moorVMS-LDF1, Moor Instruments, Axminster, UK) was placed over the skull (≈ 2 mm posterior, 6 mm lateral to the bregma) to monitor regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). The distal MCA was compressed with a 1-mm glass capillary having a fine blunted tip using a micromanipulator. A reduction of rCBF to > 75% of the basal was considered as a successful ischemia. After recanalization, animals whose rCBF did not reach to 90% of the baseline were also excluded. Sham procedure employed similar mice that underwent surgery as well as a mild and brief compression of brain parenchyma adjacent to MCA.
Immunofluorescence and Assessment of Ischemic Injury
In initial screening experiments, we characterized the occlusion time needed to simulate TIA or stroke using immunohistochemistry. For this, three mice were subjected to ischemia for 3, 7, 15, 25, 35, and 45 min, and were perfused with PFA after 48 h. The brains were extracted, cryoprotected, and stored at − 80 °C. Then, cryosections of 16 μm thick were obtained and immunostained for cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling Technology #9661;1:200) and GFAP (Biorbyt #orb175827;1:200) in order to assess neuronal death and gliosis, respectively. Full brain images were taken under fluorescence microscopy (Olympus IX51) and high-magnification images using confocal microscopy (Olympus FV1000). Image quantification was done by a researcher blinded to experimental condition.
Metabolomics
Blood samples were obtained with a puncture on the facial vein and collected on Microvette CB 300 capillary tubes (Sarsted, Nümbrecht, Germany) at 6, 12, 24, and 48 h post intervention. Plasma was obtained using centrifugation according to manufacturer instructions and stored at − 80 °C until further analyses. Samples were then randomized and processed in a manner blinded to experimental condition. For non-targeted metabolomic analysis, 90 μl of cold methanol (4 °C) containing deuterated standards (to control sample loss, as indicated previously [ ]) were added to 30 μl of plasma samples. Sequentially, samples were incubated 1 h at − 20 °C and then centrifuged 3 min at 12000 g . Supernatant was recovered and evaporated using a Speed Vac (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Barcelona, Spain). Finally, it was resuspended in water 0.4% acetic acid/ methanol (50/50) prior to chromatographic analyses.
We used an ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC) scheme with an Agilent 1290 LC system coupled to an electrospray-ionization quadrupole time of flight (Q-TOF) mass spectrometer 6520 instrument (Agilent Technologies, Barcelona, Spain). A column with 1.8 μM particle size was employed. The study was run in a double-blinded fashion and all chromatographic batches contained quality control samples.
Multivariate Statistics and Metabolite Characterization
Statistics calculations were performed using SPSS software for Macintosh, version 20 (SPSS, Chicago, IL), R software, or the Stata 11 statistics package (StataCorp, College Station, TX). Hierarchical heat map clustering and partial least discriminate analysis (PLS-DA) was performed using Mass Hunter Mass Profiler Professional software. The number of components chosen for PLS-DA was four, and data was scaled using an auto-scaling algorithm. Validation of the model was achieved with a N -fold validation type with threefold and ten repeats as validation parameters. Statistical significance for intergroup metabolite level differences was assessed by ANOVA analysis. In all cases, significance is considered for P < 0.05. Venn diagrams and comparison of common metabolites between different times and different cohorts were done with the free online software of the Bioinformatics & Evolutionary Genomics from Ghent University ( http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn/ ).
The preliminary identification of differential metabolites was performed using the PCDL database from Agilent (Agilent Technologies, Barcelona, Spain), which uses retention times, exact mass, and isotopic distribution in a standardized chromatographic system as an orthogonal searchable parameter to complement accurate mass data (AMRT approach) according to previously published works [ ]. An MS/MS analysis with authentic standards was used to confirm identities.
Results
Assessment of Ischemic Injury
In line with Arsava et al. [ ], TIA was defined when scattered selective neuronal death was observed over otherwise intact brain parenchyma, as detected by positive cleaved caspase-3 immunostaining of irreversibly injured neurons (Fig. 1 b white arrows) in a very restricted area subsidiary of the occluded artery. This was afforded after 7 min of distal MCA compression (dMCAc) with an 85 ± 5.5% rCBF reduction.

Twenty-five minutes of dMCAc with same rCBF reduction induced massive neuronal death with tissular damage (stroke) encompassing the distal MCA area 48 h post intervention. Moreover, there was an increase in glial cells near to the scarification zone where intense caspase-3 activation was detected (Fig. 1 d).
Metabolomic Profiles of Stroke Onset and TIA
First, we tried to identify specific metabolites associated with the TIA model, using a discovery cohort and an independent validation cohort. With the discovery cohort, we found TIA specific metabolites at 6, 12, and 24 h post-ischemic event (42 metabolites at 6 h, 38 at 12 h, and 56 at 24 h; Supplemental Table I ). Whenever it was possible, they were characterized on the basis of their exact mass using the Metlin database https://metlin.scripps.edu/index.php ; Table 1 ) and validated in the second cohort. In the discovery cohort, none of the metabolites were maintained through different time points(Supplemental Fig. I ), but in the second validation cohort, we found 16 common metabolites between 6 and 12 h and also a metabolite (1 Monopalmitoil) maintained through 12 to 48 h (Supplemental Fig. I ).
A PLS-DA model offered a clear grouping of different ischemia times and sham at all time points tested both in the discovery (Fig. 2 ), in the validation cohort (Supplemental Fig. II ) and when both cohorts were considered together (Supplemental Fig. III ). This grouping was not maintained in late times of the sham group (Fig. 2 ). Fig. 2 MCA occlusion induces a plasma metabolomic signature in mice. a PLS-DA model was designed to separate with high accuracy the TIA (blue), stroke (red), and SHAM (brown) plasma samples obtained from mice at 6 h ( a ), 12 h ( b ), or 24 h ( c )
We found that lactic acid was a TIA biomarker as it was present in both cohorts at 6 h and 1,4-dideoxi-1,4-imino- d -arabinitol at 48 h. We also performed the comparison of TIA event with No event (sham) considering all the time points together. We found 59 metabolites potentially characterizing TIA (Supplemental Table II ).
Second, we assess if metabolomics could be used to define time elapsed after stroke. For this purpose, we focused on the 6-h time point after stroke, the critical time window for current recanalization therapies. We compared plasma metabolomic profiles from animals sacrificed 6 h after the experimental ischemia episode with those obtained from animals sacrificed later (12, 24, and 48 h after ischemia). As shown in PLS-DA plots from Fig. 3 , it was possible to group samples according to time after stroke. These results were not observed in sham mice, discarding any surgery or anesthesia effect on grouping. Moreover, we confirmed the existence of potential BMs for the time from ischemia onset. Thirty-nine metabolites (Supplemental Table II ) showed statistically significant different expression levels at 6 h after stroke versus 12, 24, or 48 h. Table 2 shows metabolites with higher variations and the potential identities using the Metlin database (Nervonic Acid, Vit.D3, and 8-oxo-dGTP). Going further, we also performed a case-control comparison (ischemia vs sham) at each time point. The obtained metabolites are shown in Supplemental Table IV . Fig. 3 MCA occlusion induces a time-dependent plasma metabolomic signature in mice A PLS-DA model was designed to separate with high accuracy the time after occlusion ( a ). The same approach was used on sham samples, but separation of different times after event was not possible for late sampling times ( b ) Table 1 Metabolites showing higher concentration in TIA versus SHAM on each time point Time (h) Metabolite Log Fc ([sham] vs [TIA]) P value 1 6 Lactic acid − 10.426412 0.022 6 3-Hydroxy-2-methylvalerate − 5.4502916 0.02563317 6 C20 H53 Cl N14 O6 S 15.471292 0.02182547 6 C8 H4 N2 O4 S2 16.650217 0.015617846 12 C6 H12 N4 O4 − 18.822985 1.88E-06 12 C9 H21 N O4 − 13.628346 0.019153 12 C24 H32 O4 14.407044 0.027084 12 C8 H17 N O2 15.20618 0.021574 24 Saccharopine 11.507927 0.005974 24 Dihydrocholesterol 1.906677 0.045507 24 Erythritol 9.727357 0.04945411 1 P value based on Student’s t test between sham and TIA samples within a given time period Table 2 Compounds showing differences between 6 h and later times after occlusion (25 min of MCA occlusion) Metabolite LogFc([6 h] vs [12 h]) LogFc([6 h] vs [24 h]) LogFc([6 h] vs [48 h]) P value 1 D-myo-Inositol-1,5-diphosphate-β-D-Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate-alpha-D-Glucose 1,6-biphosphate-D-Tagatose 1,6-bisphosphate 2 9.078252 9.078252 6.9570026 0.045714695 Nervonic acid 8.386562 8.386562 6.431272 0.045374 C36 H55 N15 13.256417 8.661458 2.1822853 0.019706592 Vitamin D3/cholecalciferol 0 − 4.8957596 − 11.794513 0.018643 C25 H47 N5 O9 − 14.006489 − 7.27206 − 12.241901 0.03705603 707.7541@8.5605 13.342027 9.150797 11.080364 0.025239738 8-oxo-dGTP/guanosine 5-tetrahydrogen triphosphate (GTP)/guanosine triphosphate (GTP) − 13.813649 − 2.2839298 − 2.2635531 0.008815 1 P value based on Student’s t test between sham and TIA samples within a given time period 2 Method used did not allow to differentiate between these isobaric molecules
Discussion
Adapting a novel protocol for high-precision focal transient cerebral ischemia by compression of the distal MCA [ ] in mice, we identified a specific metabolomic profile for the TIA model at different times after occlusion, and metabolites related to the time from artery occlusion. This technique of dMCAc allowed immediate and significant blood flow reduction and also an immediate recovery, 70% reperfusion in a few seconds and almost total recovery in 15 min. Although the duration of ischemia to simulate TIA and stroke were shorter than in the original description [ ] (possibly due to differences in anesthetics and mouse strains used), we used the same definition. Therefore, optimal TIA simulation was defined by selective neuronal death without brain parenchymal lesion and stroke when massive neuronal death was observed. To our knowledge, this is the first time that metabolomics is applied in blood samples obtained in this type of animal model.
Currently, accurate TIA diagnosis in humans could sometimes be difficult [ ] because it is almost solely based on clinical history. Due to its brief duration, most patients remain asymptomatic during medical evaluation. Additionally, only one out of three patients exhibit acute ischemic lesions in diffusion-weighted imaging [ ]. A possible solution to the diagnostic difficulties in TIA would be a serum BM that could reliably correlate to transient brain ischemia. Despite some biomarkers having been proposed, none of them has been validated on large cohorts [ ]. Using a mouse model of TIA, we tried to identify TIA-specific metabolites. We were able to demonstrate that metabolomics is useful to detect TIA in plasma samples at all time points post-occlusion analyzed. We observed specific metabolomic patterns related to TIA at different time points. However, in the initial cohorts, no single molecule was maintained through all the times, demonstrating the complexity of metabolomic changes induced even by a selective occlusion on a restricted cerebral region. Among the time-dependent metabolites identified, lactic acid (product of anaerobic glycolysis) was present at 6 h. At physiological pH, lactic acid dissociates to form a lactate anion, and lactate accumulation in ischemic brain has been documented in rodent stroke models [ ]; however, clinical attempts to stablish lactate as an ischemia plasmatic biomarker has not been successful [ ] so far, perhaps because blood samplings were performed late within 24 h after symptom onset.
Furthermore, we used metabolomics to find biomarkers suitable to detect the exact time from stroke onset. Currently, only multiparametric neuroimaging techniques allow identifying patients with awake stroke who will benefit from RT [ ]. Regarding animal models, recent work that used repeated magnetic resonance spectroscopy measurements to identify concentrations of several metabolites and then plotting its concentrations against time allowed to determine the onset time with an accuracy of 33 min [ ], we found no common metabolites between their study and the present one, maybe due to different samples analyzed (brain vs plasma), different techniques used (magnetic resonance vs metabolomics) and different mouse strains. Both techniques are non-invasive but require sophisticated imaging machinery that renders it difficult to be used in day-to-day clinical practice. In this sense, metabolomics appears promising to identify unique metabolites that could be used on current faster, easier, and cheaper diagnostic tools, as immunoassays or chromatography.
In our study, we found seven plasmatic compounds with different concentrations at 6 h after IS compared to 12, 24, or 48 h time points. Among them, we observed lower levels of vitamin D3 and higher levels of nervonic acid. Vitamin D3 avoids blood-brain barrier disruption after experimental stroke [ ], while low levels aggravate brain injury in rat experimental stroke model [ ]. Therefore, our results could reflect a progressive increase in circulating vitamin D3 to reduce stroke-induced brain damage. Nervonic acid is a ω-9 monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) especially abundant on brain white matter [ ] and can be β-oxidized on the peroxisomes of various tissues [ ]. Accordingly, its peak at 6 h could reflect a release from damaged neuronal membranes and/or a rapid β-oxidation in other tissues. Finally, 8-oxo-dGTP is related with DNA oxidative damage, which increases with age as well as in several neurodegenerative diseases and, is degraded by MTH1 enzyme [ ]. So, its time-dependent increase could be due to release from ischemic damaged neurons.
As a limitation of our work, we recognize the potential differences between the mouse models and patients. Changes after ischemia have a different temporal profile and maybe BMs related to the diagnosis of TIA or the time from IS onset might have different characteristics between the two species. BMs related to the diagnosis of TIA should be sensitive to early ischemia and preferably released to blood immediately after transient ischemia and remain detectable for several hours or days, because the delay to medical examination is longer compared to stroke patients. In contrast, BMs for stroke onset should rapidly increase after ischemia and decrease thereafter. Moreover comparison with TIA mice to other mice models that mimic TIA symptoms in clinical practice (seizure or migraine) could improve obtained data obtained in current work. As in previous own work, the validation rate of the proposed metabolites in the discovering cohort was really low [ , ]. Only two of the initial 187 TIA metabolites were validated. Nonetheless, the lack of repeatability induced by high inter-experiment variability is a common finding using chromatography coupled mass spectrometric approaches. Of note, in independent laboratories, injecting the same sample more than 30 times leads to the fact that most metabolites are only detected in one to five replicas, 6000 features only detected in one to five replicas while less than 1000 features detected in 30 replicas [ ]. However, the introduction of a validation cohort helps us to support the robustness of remaining biomarkers. The last limitation is that we do have to replicate these results in humans to assess their clinical usefulness and to validate the suitability of the selected time points.
In conclusion, we have shown that the combination of high-precision microsurgical dMCAc mouse models with metabolomics could be an interesting platform to discover putative BMs related to the diagnosis and time of onset of stroke or TIAs.
