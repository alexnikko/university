Introduction
Astrocytes are the most abundant non-neuronal cells in the brain [ , ]. Their abundance provides them with essential functions such as the preservation of neural tissue [ ], synaptic remodeling [ ], maintenance of protective barriers [ ], and cerebral homeostasis [ , , ]. Moreover, astrocytes contribute to the maintenance of the antioxidant system and production of neurotrophins [ ]. However, astrocytes not only perform neuroprotective functions but may also be detrimental to the maintenance of neuronal function [ ]. This occurs when astrocytes undergo from a resting state to a reactive one acquiring a different morphology and function, with important consequences to neuronal homeostasis [ , , ].
The brain tissue is frequently affected by pathologies in which glucose supply is diminished. Some of these diseases include hypoglycemia [ ] or diabetes mellitus [ ], and traumatic brain injury (TBI) [ , , ]. Both types of pathologies have adverse effects on cognitive, sensory, and/or physical performance with severe and permanent consequences [ , , ]. In this regard, TBI is considered as the leading cause of mortality and disability in children older than 1 year [ , ] and in older adults in developed countries [ , , , ]. TBI is more prevalent than some major diseases like Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and breast cancer [ ]. Even after such a high level of incidence of TBI, there is still no effective treatments available to prevent neuronal damage. This occurs, in part, because of the high diversity of cells involved in the lesion and the lack of knowledge about their functional changes during injury [ ]. For example, the overall effects of TBI-reactive astrocytes are still uncertain [ ], and it is unclear as to what extent these cells are neuroprotective or deleterious for the brain [ , ].
Understanding the response of astrocytes and other types of cells to TBI can shed light on the mechanisms leading to functional deterioration of the nervous tissue, as well as to identify possible treatments or prevention targeted to avoid progression of this pathophysiology [ ]. Recently, conditioned medium of human mesenchymal stem cells from adipose tissue (CM-hMSCA) has been used to treat pathologies of the central nervous system (CNS). Recent studies confirmed that the CM-hMSCA may release factors with anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory functions including hormones, extracellular matrix proteins, and neurotrophic factors [ , ]. Recent studies provided evidence on the protective effects of CM-hMSCA by enhancing the recovery of neuronal networks [ ]. For example, CM-hMSCA reduced brain damage in rat models of stroke by increasing the proliferation of endothelial cells, reducing neuronal apoptosis and astrogliosis [ , , ]. In this study, we explored the effect of CM-hMSCA in protecting human astrocytes from scratch injury.
Materials and Methods
Primary Culture of hMSCA
Human mesenchymal stem cells from adipose tissue (hMSCA) were isolated according to a previously described method [ ]. The procedures were performed according to a protocol approved by the ethics committee of the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana. Briefly, hMSCA were isolated from human adipose tissue that was obtained by liposuction in patients between 24 and 28 years of age. hMSCA were characterized by assessing the expression of CD34(−), CD73(+), CD90(+), and CD105(+) following the criteria established by the International Society for Cell Therapy. The cells were cultivated in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (LONZA, Walkersville, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (LONZA, Walkersville, USA) and 1% penicillin, at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO 2 .
Preparation of CM-hMSCA
hMSCA were cultured until 80% confluency with DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Thereafter, the cells were then cultured in serum-free DMEM and the CM-hMSCA was collected after 48 h. The supernatants were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 3 min and stored at −80 °C. CM-hMSCA was collected from hMSCA cultures between passages III and V.
Human Astrocyte Cell Culture
We used GIBCO® Human Astrocytes (N7805-100, Life Technologies,Warsaw, Poland), a cell line previously used and validated [ , , ]. GIBCO® Human Astrocytes are derived from normal brain tissue and stain positive for the astrocyte marker glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) [ , ]. The cells were cultured at 37 °C in GIBCO Astrocyte Medium [A1261301, Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM), N-2 Supplement, fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 10 U penicillin/10 μg streptomycin/25 ng amphotericin (LONZA)] according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cell plates were Geltrex matrix-coated (A14132) and were seeded 4 × 10 4 cells/cm 2 in 96-well plates. The cultures were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO 2 , and the culture medium was changed three times a week.
Scratch Assay and CM-hMSCA Treatments
In this study, our in vitro model ( scratch assay) was characterized by mechanical injury as well as metabolic insult, and has been previously used to mimic an in vitro model of TBI [ , , ]. Briefly, the cells were allowed to reach confluence for 72 h and then serum deprived for 6 h. Later, a denuded area was produced by scratching the inside diameter of the well with a 10-μl pipette tip [ , , ]. Then, the scratch cells were immediately rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 1× to remove debris and treated with different concentrations of CM-hMSCA (5–10–15% ( v / v )). The experimental groups were as follows: (1) scratch ± BSS0, cells under scratch and glucose-free conditions (BSS0); (2) scratch ± BSS5, scratch cells plus BSS0 supplemented with 5.5 mM glucose (BSS5, control cells); (3) scratch ± BSS0 ± CM, scratch cells plus BSS0 and treated with different concentrations of CM-hMSCA (5, 10, 15%); and (4) scratch ± BSS5 ± CM 5–10–15%, scratch cells plus BSS5 and treated with different concentrations of CM-hMSCA. Glucose-free condition assay was performed as reported previously [ , , ]. The composition of the balanced salt solution (BSS0) was NaCl, 116; CaCl 2 , 1.8; MgSO 4 7H 2 O, 0.8; KCl, 5.4; NaH 2 PO 4 , 1; NaHCO 3 , 14.7; and 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), 10; pH 7.4. In this study, cells were submitted to scratch + BSS0 (mechanical injury plus glucose-free conditions) and simultaneously received a co-treatment with different concentrations of CM-hMSCA for 30 h at 37 °C.
Determination of Viability and Nuclear Fragmentation
We determined viability through MTT assay (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA). Cells were seeded into 96-well plates in GIBCO Astrocyte Medium (A1261301, Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM), N-2 Supplement, fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 10 U penicillin/10 μg streptomycin/25 ng amphotericin (LONZA)) at a seeding density of 4 × 10 4 cells/cm 2 , incubated for 72 h until they reached confluence, and treated. Cell viability was assessed and standardized at 24, 30, and 48 h, following injury by adding MTT solution at the final concentration of 2 mg/ml, for 3 h at 37 °C. Then, DMSO was added to the cells and the blue formazan production was evaluated in a plate reader at 595 nm. The MTT values were normalized with the experimental control group (s cratch + BSS5), which was considered as 100% survival. The experimental groups taken into account for the determination of viability, as well as for the other determinations, were presented in “ Scratch Assay and CM-hMSCA Treatments .” Each viability assay was performed with a minimum of six replicates per condition.
Nuclear fragmentation was determined by Hoechst 33258 staining. Briefly, after treatments, the cells were washed with PBS and fixed for 20 min in 4% formaldehyde at room temperature (RT). Subsequently, the cells were washed and labeled with Hoechst 33258 (5 mg/ml; Invitrogen) for 15 min. Cell nuclei were observed and photographed using an inverted fluorescence microscope, Olympus IX-53 (UV excitation, filter CKX-NU N1157600) (excitation 352 nm/emission 461 nm) with an exposure time set between 80 and 100 ms to avoid the saturation of the pixels. The number of fragmented nuclei was determined in at least eight randomly selected areas (0.03 mm 2 ) from each experimental group. Data were expressed as a percentage of nuclear fragmented relative to the value in control cultures (s cratch + BSS5). The experiments were replicated at least in three different cell cultures.
Morphological Analysis
Digitized ×20 magnified black and white images were taken by a digital camera (Moticam CMOS 10) attached to an inverted microscope (Olympus IX-53). The images were used to evaluate the area, polarity, and percentage of the astrocytic processes in all the treatments. Cell area and polarity were calculated by randomly selecting cells from the images. The polarity index was calculated as the length of the main migration axis (parallel to the direction of movement) divided by the length of the perpendicular axis that intersects the center of the cell [ , ]. The percentage of astrocytic processes was calculated as described [ ] by counting the processes of the cell body in 20 cells per experimental group. In addition, to complement the morphological study, the binary silhouette of a cell was reduced to its one-pixel contour to show a visual representation of the cell dimensions and complexity in the main experimental groups [ ]. The cell area, polarity, and astrocytic processes of wound-border cells were calculated to determine the effect of scratch + BSS0 and CM-hMSCA on cell morphology relative to control cultures (s cratch + BSS5). Data were obtained with a minimum of 25 cells for each condition.
Microscopy and Migration Analysis
For the wound closure assay, confluent astrocyte monolayers cultured on plastic plates were used. Before CM-hMSCA co-treatment, the scratch was performed on the monolayer using a 10-μl pipette tip and washing once with PBS-1X to remove detached cells and debris. Immediately afterwards, treatment was started with the different experimental groups proposed in “ Scratch Assay and CM-hMSCA Treatments .” At the beginning of the experiment with 0 h of treatment (basal time), digital images were taken from scratch cells using a ×10 magnification lens. Subsequently, after 30 h (end time of the trial), the same region was again visualized and the photographic record was made.
To complete the evaluation of the astrocytes to migrate, in the images at base time and 30 h after co-treatments, the distance occupied by the cells from the edge of the wound was measured as indicated by the asterisk in Fig. 4 b. The measurement was performed on both sides of the wound, and the value was averaged and the analysis is presented in percentage of migration. The images were taken in black and white by a digital camera (Moticam CMOS 10) attached to an inverted microscope (Olympus IX-53). The images were then analyzed with NIH ImageJ software 1.46r (National Institutes of Health, download http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/ ) to quantify the percentage of wound closure by quantifying the remaining free area of cells in basal time ( t = 0 h) and comparing it with that after 30 h. For the determination of the percentage of cell migration, the average of the distance occupied by the cells from the border of the wound in base time and then with 30 h of co-treatment was compared. Experiments were performed at least three times and measurements were performed in triplicate.
Determination of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential
Mitochondrial membrane potential was evaluated by using tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM) and assessed by fluorescence image analysis. Cells were seeded at a density of 4 × 10 4 cells/cm 2 into 48-well plates in GIBCO Astrocyte Medium (previously described), and subjected to each experimental paradigm after 72 h. After treatments, the cells were incubated with TMRM for 20 min. Finally, the cells were washed with PBS and photographed in a fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX-53). The images were processed with ImageJ software, and the mean fluorescence intensity of randomly selected cells was determined as described below. The mean was calculated with a minimum of 20 cells analyzed for each condition. The experiments were repeated in three different cultures.
Estimation of Cellular Mean Fluorescence Intensity
The calculation of the mean fluorescence intensity of the cells for the determination of mitochondrial membrane potential and nuclear fragmentation was performed using ImageJ [ ]. The microphotographs were loaded in the software and pre-processed eliminating the background. Subsequently, 20 cells were randomly selected using a numbered grid in each microphotograph. The mean fluorescence value of the 20 cells was determined in six microphotographs for each treatment using the Measure algorithm of ImageJ and selecting each cell manually via ROI’s Management. The control cultures in the fluorescence determinations were the cells under the conditions of scratch + BSS5. The cells were analyzed in an area of 0.03 mm 2 . There were no variations in the conditions of the image processing. Each assay was performed with a minimum of six replicate wells for each condition.
Protein Extraction and Western Blotting
GIBCO® Human Astrocytes were lysed on ice with RIPA Lysis and Extraction Buffer Thermo Scientific™ supplemented with Halt™ Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, EDTA-free (100×) (Roche). Protein content was estimated using the Pierce™ BCA Protein Assay Kit. Equal amounts of protein were dissolved in sample buffer and separated by electrophoresis in SDS-PAGE, transferred onto PVDF membranes, and blocked in 5% skim milk dissolved in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T), at RT for 1 h. The membranes were incubated at 4 °C ON with antibodies against β-actin (Thermo Fisher) (1:3000), superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) (Thermo Fisher) (1:1000), and GPX1 (Thermo Fisher) (1:1500). The immunoreactivity was visualized by incubating the membrane with specific secondary antibody (IRDye® Antibodies) for 1 h and detected using Odyssey CLx Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences). The intensity of each band was quantified using Image Studio Software 5.x. All data were normalized to control values ( scratch + BSS5) on each gel. All experiments were performed in triplicates.
Statistical Analysis
Data obtained from this study were tested for normal distribution by Kolmogorov–Smirnov test and homogeneity of variance by Levene’s test. The data were then examined by analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Dunnet’s post hoc test for comparisons between controls and treatments. Tukey’s post hoc test was used for multiple comparisons between the means of treatments and time points. Data were presented as mean ± SEM of three independent experiments. A statistically significant difference was defined at p < 0.05.
Results
Scratch Assay Reduced Astrocytes’ Viability at 30 h
Both brain injury and glucose deprivation are recognized as one of the causes of increased cognitive impairment and damage in many brain pathologies [ , , ]. We did not find any damage or alteration in viability or at the mitochondrial level induced only by scratch (data not shown); therefore, we associated this mechanical damage ( scratch ) with a metabolic deterioration (glucose deprivation), as the experimental group scratch + BSS0. In this regard, after 6 h without FBS, we subject the cells to scratch + BSS0 during increasing periods of times: 24 h (Fig. 1 d), 30 h (Fig. 1 e), and 48 h (Fig. 1 f). Cells cultured in scratch + BSS5 solution (5.5 mM glucose) were used as controls. The results show that after 30 h of scratch + BSS0 treatment, cells reached a 50% decrease in cell viability (Fig. 1 e–g) when compared to control cultures ( scratch + BSS5) incubated for the same period of time ( p < 0.0001; Fig. 1 c–g). We observed that 30 h of scratch + BSS0 was the optimum time to be selected for the next experiments. Cellular morphological changes were evident over time in cells subjected to scratch + BSS0 (Fig. 1 d, e), reaching up to 40% viability at 48 h (Fig. 1 f). Fig. 1 Effects of scratch assay on human astrocytes. The figure shows representative images of astrocytes treated with scratch + BSS5 at different times 24 h ( a ), 30 h ( b ), and 48 h ( c ). d – f Changes in the growth and cellular morphology of astrocytes at different times after scratch + BSS0 were observed.

Dose–Response of the CM-hMSCA Against Cell Death Induced by Scratch in Human Astrocytes
To determine the effect of CM-hMSCA on cell survival, astrocytes were treated with increasing concentrations of CM-hMSCA (5–10–15%) and subjected to scratch + BSS0 for 30 h (Fig. 1 d). Figure 2 shows the viability results obtained during co-treatment with scratch + BSS0 + CM at 5, 10, or 15%. Our results evidenced a recovery of 91.48% ( p < 0.0001), 97.4% ( p < 0.0001), and 103.7% ( p < 0.0001) in cell viability during co-treatment with scratch + BSS0 + CM5% (Fig. 2 a–d), scratch + BSS0 + CM10% (Fig. 2 b–e), and scratch + BSS0 + CM15% (Fig. 2 c–f), respectively, compared to scratch + BSS0 (Fig. 2 g). This confirms that low concentrations of CM-hMSCA in the range of 2–5% were able to recover astrocytes and attenuated cell death in this model of cell injury [ , ]. Furthermore, our findings suggest that CM-hMSCA provides cell protection in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2 g). However, the differences between CM treatment effects did not reach statistical significance ( p = 0.8678) (Fig. 2 g). Fig. 2 Dose-response of CM-hMSCA in human astrocytes with scratch + BSS0 at 30 h. scratch + BSS0 + CM-MSCA at 5 ( a – d ), 10 ( b – e ), and 15% ( c – f ) increase cellular viability of astrocytes near to control conditions. h This figure shows the recovery of cell viability by different concentrations of CM-hMSCA.

CM-hMSCA Induces Changes in Human Astrocyte Morphology Under Scratch Assay
Changes in surface and cellular complexity over time may reflect functional differences in reactive astrocytes [ , ]. Figure 3 shows changes in cell morphology for different experimental groups: scratch + BSS5 (Fig. 3 a), scratch + BSS0 (Fig. 3 b), and scratch + BSS0 + CM15% (Fig. 3 c). Qualitatively, we observed changes in cellular morphology under scratch + BSS0 conditions (Fig. 3 b). In addition, in the visualization of the binary silhouette of a representative cell per experimental group, compared to the control cells ( scratch + BSS5) (Fig. 3 d), we found evident morphological changes and an increase in cells arbor under conditions of scratch + BSS0 (Fig. 3 e). Indeed, we determined the percentage of astrocytic processes (Fig. 3 g) and the cell area (Fig. 3 h) to evaluate our observations quantitatively. Figure 3 g shows the differences in the number of astrocytic processes per experimental group, with an increase of up to 133.7% in astrocytes under scratch + BSS0 conditions compared to scratch + BSS5 ( p = 0.0013). All experimental groups, scratch + BSS0 + CM5% ( p < 0.0001), scratch + BSS0 + CM10% ( p < 0.0001), and scratch + BSS0 + CM15% of CM-hMSCA ( p = 0.0004) presented with time a significant decrease in the number of astrocytic processes and cellular complexity with relation to baseline. Furthermore, after 30 h of scratch, treatment with CM-hMSCA induced significant decreases in astrocytic processes in the groups when compared to controls ( scratch + BSS0): 82% ( p < 0.0001) for scratch + BSS0 + CM5%, 82.19% ( p < 0.0001) for scratch + BSS0 + CM10%, and 75.57% ( p < 0.0001) for scratch + BSS0 + CM15%-CM-hMSCA. However, in the analysis of astrocytic processes, no significant differences were found between the concentrations of CM-hMSCA assayed ( p > 0.9999). In contrast, cells that were treated with CM-hMSCA at different concentrations maintained the mean cell area and showed significant differences with the scratch + BSS0 group (Fig. 3 h). The area was higher at increasing CM concentration as follows: 562.4 μm 2 at 5% ( p < 0.0001), 725.7 μm 2 at 10% ( p < 0.0001), and 822.2 μm 2 at 15% ( p < 0.0001). In this time, the differences between the concentrations of scratch + BSS0 + CM5% and scratch + BSS0 + CM15% ( p = 0.0057) of CM-hMSCA were significant ( p < 0.05). Fig. 3 CM-hMSCA induces changes in the cellular morphology of human astrocytes with scratch + BSS0 at 30 h. The figure shows representative micrographs of the morphology of astrocytes treated with scratch + BSS5 ( a ), scratch + BSS0 ( b ), and scratch + BSS0+ CM-hMSCA 15% ( c ). e Arboreal morphology of astrocytes in scratch + BSS0 conditions in binary silhouette and f morphological changes in astrocytes treated with scratch + BSS0 + CM-hMSCA15% in binary silhouette. g Percentage of astrocytic processes in different groups.

CM-hMSCA Induces Wound Closure and Cell Migration in Human Astrocytes Subjected to Scratch
Wound closure and cell migration were evaluated under control conditions ( scratch + BSS5; scratch + BSS0) (Fig. 4 b) and in the groups treated with scratch + BSS0 + CM5% (Fig. 4 c), scratch + BSS0 + CM10% (Fig. 4 d), and scratch + BSS0 + CM15% (Fig. 4 e). The results show that treatment with scratch + BSS0 + CM5 increased wound closure in a direct proportion to the concentration of CM used. After 30 h of incubation, an increase in wound closure of 22.45% ( p < 0.0001; Fig. 4 c), 31.92% ( p < 0.0001; Fig. 4 d), and 35.48% ( p < 0.0001, Fig. 4 e) was observed when cells were treated with scratch + BSS0 + CM5%, scratch + BSS0 + CM10%, and scratch + BSS0 + CM15%, respectively. Fig. 4 Effect of CM-hMSCA on cell migration and wound closure. a , b Microphotographs of cell migration ( p = 0.0452) treated with scratch + BSS5 and scratch + BSS0 at 30 h, respectively. c – e Microphotographs of cells treated with scratch + BSS0 + CM-hMSCA at 5, 10, and 15%, respectively. f Scratch + BSS0 + CM-hMSCA increases cell migration vs. base time in the concentration of 5 (a, p = 0.0180), 10 (b, p = 0.0180), and 15% (c, p < 0.0001). At 30 h, we found significant differences between the scratch + BSS0 vs. scratch + BSS0 + CM-hMSCA 10% (two asterisks, p = 0.0031) and 15% (four asterisks, p < 0.0001). Blue arrows indicate non-migrating cells and black arrows migrating cells with altered cellular morphology. One asterisk indicates the distance covered by the cells from the edge of the wound used to calculate the percentage of cell migration. On the other hand, g scratch + BSS0 + CM-hMSCA increases wound closure at any concentration 5% (a, p < 0.0001), 10% (b, p < 0.0001), and 15% (c, p < 0.0001) with respect to scratch + BSS0 at 30 h. Four asterisks, p < 0.0001 scratch + BSS5 vs. scratch + BSS0 at 30 h. ns ( p > 0.9999) without significant differences between scratch + BSS0 base time and 30 h. All data in these figures are presented as mean ± SEM of three individual experiments. Error bars indicate SEM. Scale bar, 50 μm
Figure 4 f shows the percentage of cell migration, which correlates with wound closure. Cells treated with scratch + BSS0 + CM showed a higher percentage of cell migration than controls, and this was dependent upon the concentration of CM-hMSCA. After 30 h, cell migration was 4.3 times higher in cells that were treated with scratch + BSS0 + CM15% (Fig. 4 e, f) than control cells treated with scratch + BSS0 ( p < 0.0001) (Fig. 4 b–f). To confirm whether the increase in wound closure was induced by cell migration, we evaluated the index of polarity of the cells in each of the experimental groups as the index of polarity has been reported to indicate the state of migration of the cells [ ]. In this context, it was found that the polarity index of the cells subjected to scratch + BSS0 was 1.7 times lower than that of cells subjected to scratch + BSS5 cells ( p < 0.0001; Fig. 5 a–d). However, after 30 h of treatments, CM-treated cells showed in comparison to control cells ( scratch + BSS5) a 2.3 ( p < 0.0001), 2.9 ( p = 0.0002), and 4.7 ( p < 0.0001) times increase in the polarity index in the cells that were treated with scratch + BSS0 + CM5%, scratch + BSS0 + CM10%, and scratch + BSS0 + CM15%, respectively (Fig. 5 d).

CM-hMSCA Decreases Nuclear Fragmentation and Improves Mitochondrial Membrane Potential in Human Astrocytes
To further evaluate the protective effects of CM in astrocytes subjected to scratch assay, the effect of CM-hMSCA on nuclear fragmentation was assessed. Figure 6 shows control cells ( scratch + BSS5) (Fig. 6 a) and astrocytes subjected to scratch + BSS0 with an increased nuclear fragmentation by 35.4% compared to control ( p < 0.0001; Fig. 6 b). However, cells that were treated with scratch + BSS0 + CM showed a marked reduction in nuclear fragmentation by 41.54 and 48.59% in the presence of scratch + BSS0 + CM5% ( p < 0.0001; Fig. 6 c) and scratch + BSS0 + CM10% ( p < 0.0001; Fig. 6 d), respectively. Surprisingly, a reduction of up to 53.55% with scratch + BSS0 + CM15% ( p < 0.0001; Fig. 6 e) with respect to scratch + BSS0 cells was observed (Fig. 6 f). Fig. 6 CM-hMSCA reduces nuclear fragmentation following scratch + BSS0. Upper panel shows representative micrographs of astrocytes exposed to scratch + BSS5 ( a ); scratch + BSS0 ( b ); scratch + BSS0 + CM-hMSCA 5% ( c ); scratch + BSS0 + CM-hMSCA 10% ( d ), and scratch + BSS0 + CM-hMSCA 15% ( e ). The bar graph shows the percentage of cells with fragmented nuclei ( f ). Four asterisks, p < 0.0001 scratch + BSS0 + CM-hMSCA 5, 10, and 15% vs. scratch + BSS0 at 30 h.

Similar results were observed when the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) was determined. Figure 7 shows differences in Δψm in astrocytes exposed to scratch + BSS5 (Fig. 7 a), scratch + BSS0 (Fig. 7 b), and astrocytes co-treated with scratch + BSS0 + CM5% (Fig. 7 c), 10% (Fig. 7 d), and 15% (Fig. 7 e). Cells subjected to scratch + BSS0 + CM maintained a Δψm close to that of the control ( scratch + BSS5) when evaluated at different concentrations. Also, an increase of 2.31 times ( p = 0.0013; Fig. 7 e, f) protection of the Δψm in the group of cells with scratch + BSS0 + CM15% compared to the control ( scratch + BSS5). Likewise, we found significant differences between the scratch + BSS0 + CM10% and scratch + BSS0 + CM15% Δψm values ( p < 0.0001) (Fig. 7 f).

CM-hMSCA Expression of Antioxidant Proteins in Human Astrocytes upon Scratch
Since several parameters evaluated in this work showed a better recovery of astrocytes treated with scratch + BSS0 + CM15%, the effect of CM-hMSC on the endogenous antioxidant defense was tested (Fig. 8 ). In this regard, it was observed that 30 h of co-treatment with scratch + BSS0 + CM15% resulted in an upregulation of antioxidant enzymes. We observed 1.8- and 0.4-fold increases in glutathione peroxidase expression (GPX1; p < 0.0001, Fig. 8 a, b), and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2; p < 0.0001, Fig. 8 a–c) in astrocytes treated with scratch + BSS0 + CM15% when compared to cells treated with scratch + BSS0 alone, respectively. Fig. 8 CM-hMSCA slightly induced the expression of antioxidant proteins in human astrocytes. Western blot analysis indicated that the expression of GPX1 ( a , b ) and SOD2 ( a – c ) was 1.8- and 0.4-fold increase in scratch + BSS0 + CM-hMSCA15%-treated cells compared to untreated cells under scratch + BSS0 at 30 h. β-Actin was used as loading control.

Discussion
In this study, we aimed to explore the effect of CM-hMSCA on human astrocytes subjected to scratch assay. Our findings indicated that CM-hMSCA improved cell viability, reduced nuclear fragmentation, and preserved mitochondrial membrane potential. These results were accompanied by morphological changes and increased the polarity index, thus reflecting the ability of cells treated with CM-hMSCA to migrate towards the wound suggesting that CM-hMSCA may be considered as a promising therapeutic strategy for the protection of astrocytes in brain pathologies.
TBI is considered a pathology with dynamic and complex processes that involve multiple cells and trigger various cell signaling pathways that lead to neurodegeneration [ ]. The complexity of this pathology has made it difficult to understand and prevent the progress of the neuronal damage. Recently, in order to understand the pathophysiology of TBI, several studies have been carried out using different in vitro models proposed as complementary tools for discovery in the field [ , , , ]. One of these models is the scratch assay that has been widely used to assess the effects of brain injury in a controlled in vitro environment [ , , ]. In the present work, we used a scratch assay model associated with a metabolic dysfunction (glucose deprivation) to address the ability of astrocytes to migrate and whether glucose deprivation in astrocytes might impair mitochondrial functionality and regeneration processes. The mechanical damage suffered during TBI and glucose withdrawal due to the interruption of blood flow lead to metabolic alterations and a direct relation with cell death pathways [ , ]. Besides, previous works have shown that glucose withdrawal may affect wound closure and contribute to an increase of the secondary lesions in various cerebral pathologies [ , , ]. In this context, various compounds such as estrogens [ ] and the use of MSCs [ , ] or their conditioned medium [ , , ] are being evaluated to treat brain tissue lesions or to decrease glial reactivity. Some studies suggest that the use of conditioned medium or extracellular vesicles derived from MSCs may help to counteract neuronal injury upon a neurodegenerative event [ ], decrease microgliosis induced by inflammation in conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [ ], and prevent reactive astrogliosis after ischemic stroke [ , , ].
Astrocytes become reactive upon brain injury or metabolic insult, which is characterized by increased expression of intermediate filament proteins such as GFAP and vimentin, and accompanied by prominent morphological changes [ , , ] (Fig. 3 b–e). Astrocytes respond to lesions by changing their morphology and showing hypertrophy of processes [ , ]; [ ]. These changes can last for days or even months or become generalized in the brain tissue [ ]; [ ]. In the present study, we evaluated the activation or reactivity of astrocyte changes in morphology that have been associated to brain pathologies [ , ]; [ ]; [ , ]). In our model, differences in morphology (Fig. 3 b) and cell area (Fig. 3 h) were observed. Morphological alterations were evident in astrocytes subjected to scratch + BSS0 (Fig. 3 b–e), with a significant recovery in cells treated with scratch + BSS0 + CM 5–10–15% (Fig. 3 c–f), positively correlating this with recovery in cell viability [ ] and reported in previous studies in our laboratory [ , ]. Experimental studies have reported changes in the morphology of astrocytes similar to those observed in our model [ , , , ] and which are associated with glial activation. Although the process of structural remodeling of astrocytes during glial activation is still unclear, some molecules or pathways that may be mediating these changes have been reported. For example, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) through the β-adrenergic receptors (β-AR) [ ], cAMP signaling [ , , ], the heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF), which induces EGF receptor phosphorylation in Y1068, Mapk/Erk pathway activation, and the JAK-STAT3 signaling pathway altogether are key factors in astrocyte activation. Canonical signaling in astrocyte reactivity including overexpression of GFAP [ ] [ , ] and a simple subcellular distribution in most cytoskeletal proteins are factors that can participate in the morphological and physiological changes of astrocytes.
It is well known that astrocytes perform important functions for the maintenance of tissue structure not only in nervous developmental stages but also during brain adulthood [ ]. According to Faber-Elman et al. [ ], one of the problems in axonal regeneration is the lack of astrocytes to repopulate the site of injury in a balanced environment [ , , , ]. It is widely described that the amniotic fluid-derived conditioned medium and adipose-derived stem cells significantly enhance wound healing [ ] and cell migration [ , , ]. Firstly, we aimed to investigate the percentage of cell migration and wound closure (Fig. 4 f, g) and the polarity index (Fig. 5 d) in scratch astrocytes subjected to conditioned medium. Our evidences showed a significant increase in both parameters in astrocytes that were exposed to scratch + BSS0 + CM 5–10–15% compared to scratch + BSS0. The increase in the migration of cells treated with scratch + BSS0 + CM 5–10–15% suggests an effect probably related to the production and secretion of molecules such as transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) [ ], basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) [ , ], epidermal growth factor (EGF) [ ], laminin [ ], fibronectin [ , ], and some heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) [ , , ]. These molecules have been identified in the secretome of different MSCs [ , , , , , , ] and have been reported as fundamental factors to maintain the migration of astrocytes and other cells such as fibroblasts [ , , , ]. It is possible that the presence of molecules in CM-hMSCA involved in cell migration is regulating both the migration and closure of the wound in our model through the activation or mediation of different pathways such as ERK1/2 [ ], Rac1 [ ], ERK and JNK signaling pathways [ ], and Rho GTPases [ ], or perhaps with the direct action of TGF-β1 mediated through the activation of CysLT1R present in astrocytes (X. Q. [ ]), and control of cell polarity regulated by the Cdc42 integrin [ ] or EBI2-mediated cell signaling [ ]. However, further research on the role of each signaling cascade is deserved.
Finally, deprived or low-glucose conditions can also induce the release of free fatty acids, impair ionic homeostasis, increase intracellular calcium flow, alter mitochondrial metabolism, and increase the production of free radicals [ , ]. These changes subsequently lead to DNA and mitochondrial membrane damage [ , ]. Several studies have reported that the CM-hMSC from different sources including adipose tissue exerts a protective effect both at the neuronal and astrocytic levels, maintaining neural networks, reducing neuronal apoptosis and astrogliosis, thus providing neuroprotection [ , ]; [ , , , ]; [ ]. Our findings show a decrease in the number of fragmented nuclei (Fig. 6 f) suggesting that apoptosis linked to energy depletion caused by the absence of glucose was diminished by the effect of CM-hMSCA. The above finding is probably related to the hypothesis that the CM-hMSCA contributes to maintaining mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), which was confirmed through our assays. As observed in Fig. 7 f, Δψm was recovered in astrocytes subjected to scratch + BSS0 and treated with CM5–10–15%. Maintenance of Δψm suggests that CM-hMSCA may have a direct effect on mitochondrial function, as suggested by our previous studies [ ]. This may also be related to the maintenance of ATP levels or the activation of other metabolic pathways important for cell recovery. However, these mechanisms require further investigation in this cell type and model.
The above discussion suggests that CM-MSCA can overcome and neutralize the negative effect of scratch assay, acting in synergy with other proteins or through the activation of mechanisms that may promote cell migration and/or survival. This cellular survival may also be related to the control of ROS by means of antioxidant proteins. In this case, we found a slight increase in the expression of antioxidant proteins like GPX1 (Fig. 8 a, b) and SOD2 (Fig. 8 a–c) in cells treated with scratch + BSS0 + CM15%, as these enzymes are expressed by astrocytes that help scavenge the production of ROS [ , , ]. This result confirms our previous studies performed using T98G cells [ ]. However, further research is required to fully evaluate the effect of CM-hMSCA on the activity of these enzymes, as well as other proteins of biological importance such as neuroglobin (Ngb), a protein which was reported as mediating the protective effect of CM-MSCA in the T98G astrocyte model [ ]. A summary of the main findings found in the present manuscript is displayed in Fig. 9 . Fig. 9 Proposed model of the effect of CM-hMSCA on the protection of human astrocytes subjected to scratch assay. Scratch assay in association with glucose-free conditions leads to cell death, morphological changes, alterations in the removal of ROS that can be correlated with loss of Δψm, and DNA fragmentation, thus causing unrepairable cellular damage. This damage induced by scratch + BSS0 on human astrocytes was attenuated by CM-hMSCA at 5–10–15% for 30 h by preserving cell viability, reversing morphological changes, increasing polarity index and cell migration, decreasing nuclear fragmentation, and conserving Δψm in addition to favoring cellular antioxidant capacity with the expression of SOD2 and GPX1
In conclusion, our results demonstrate that CM-hMSCA exerts protective effects on human astrocytes exposed to scratch assay, confirming that the adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells may participate in protective actions of astrocytes and contribute to the maintenance of their neurosupportive functions in different brain pathologies.
