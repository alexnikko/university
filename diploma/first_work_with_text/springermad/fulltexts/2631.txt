Introduction
Osteosarcoma (OSA) has an estimated annual incidence of over 10 4 new cases. This tumor is more prevalent in middle-aged to older and large breed dogs. Additionally, canine OSA is a very malignant tumor with a high risk of metastasis, especially to the lung (O’Donoghue et al. ; Pang et al. ). OSA is the most common bone tumor in children (5% of all cancers) and adults (20% of all bone tumors) (Young and Miller ; Gatta et al. ). The appendicular skeleton and especially metaphyseal regions of long bones are the most common sites of the tumor growth in humans and dogs (Argyle et al. ; Jaffe ). Because of the similar tumor development site, histopathological features, tumor biology, therapeutic approaches, and molecular mechanisms, canine OSA is considered an ideal model of human OSA (Mendoza et al. ; Paoloni and Khanna ). Various genes have been defined as common candidates in both pediatric and canine OSA molecular mechanisms. For example, ErbB-2 , PTEN , CDKN2A , c-met , MYC , WT1 , KIT , Rb1 , p53 , and ezrin are regarded as common genes involved in the carcinogenesis and progression of OSA in the both species (Ferracini et al. ; Levine et al. ; Flint et al. ; Thomas et al. ).
There are some common features between embryonic/normal stem cells and cancer cells. The most critical stem cell features (i.e., differentiation capacity and self-renewal) are manifested by the phenotypic plasticity and high proliferative capacity of tumor cells (Reya et al. ). One of the interesting topics in the study of cancer cells and normal stem cells is the assessment of the expression profiles of embryonic stem cell (ES) gene sets because it has been shown that some stem cell-associated expression signatures (gene sets) and regulatory networks are active in cancers (Beachy et al. ). The overexpression of some ES gene sets (e.g., ESC-like module, NOS targets, Oct4 targets, Nanog targets, and Myc targets) and the underexpression of some other ES gene sets (e.g., Suz12 targets, Eed targets, and PRC2 targets) in various cancers such as the prostate, breast, brain, and multiple myeloma cancers have been previously confirmed (Ben-Porath et al. ; Wong et al. ; Schoenhals et al. ; Kim et al. ; Mizuno et al. ; Shats et al. ). Additionally, some of them such as Myc module and ES exp1 and PRC targets have been proposed as valuable prognostic markers (Ben-Porath et al. ; Kim et al. ).
Because of the comparable properties of the canine and human OSA and owing to the lack of information about the expression pattern of ES modules (gene sets) in canine OSA, we tried to investigate the enrichment pattern of ES gene sets in human and canine OSA. Hence, in the current study, the gene set enrichment pattern of 18 gene sets (comprising 16 ES gene sets and 2 gene sets previously described in OSA tumor) was evaluated in canine OSA tissue/cell line and human OSA tissue/cell line using the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) assay and the findings were compared subsequently.
Materials and methods

Expression data collection and primary processing
GEO databases were searched to find human and canine OSA gene expression datasets. Expression data were obtained from three GEO datasets: GSE16102 (human and canine), GSE76128 (canine), and GSE12512 (human), which were downloaded as a CEL file format. Additionally, four datasets ( GSE27217 : canine, GSE14033 : canine, GSE21257 : human, and GSE39055 : human) containing survival data were employed for survival analysis. The characteristics of the studied datasets are summarized in Table 1 . More details on the features of the patients are provided at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo . Table 1 Summary of expression datasets used in current study GEO accession Platform Number of samples Containing survival data GSE16102 (h, c) GPL96 (human), GPL3979 (canine) Human 23 (14 tissues a , 3 cell lines b , 6 normal) Canine 23 (15 tissues, 2 cell lines, 6 normal) No GSE76128 (c) GPL3738 62 (33 tissues, 29 cell lines) No GSE12512 (h) GPL7192 39 (27 tissues, 12 cell lines) No GSE21257 (h) GPL10295 53 tissues Yes GSE39055 (h) GPL14951 38 tissues Yes GSE27217 (c) GPL3738 34 tissues Yes GSE14033 (c) GPL5117 32 tissues Yes h human, c canine a Osteosarcoma tissues b Osteosarcoma cell lines
The data in the CEL file format were entered into an R program, version 3.0.2 ( http://www.r-project.org/ ), and converted into expression values by the Affy package (Gautier et al. ). As part of this process, data were transformed logarithmically.
The datasets ( GSE16102 , GSE76128 , and GSE12512 ) considered for GSEA were passed further process. The mean expression level were calculated for each gene across all samples in each dataset, and then, mean value was subtracted from corresponding values for that gene, where positive and negative values represented as above-mean expression and below-mean expression, respectively. Finally, expression data of the each two datasets were compiled in a unique file for final enrichment analysis ( GSE16102 and GSE76128 for canine and GSE16102 and GSE12512 for human).
Determination of ES and OSA gene sets
ES signatures were obtained from two studies investigated by Kim et al. ( ) and Ben-Porath et al. ( ). Each gene set is a group of genes dealing with a common pathway and function or other features. The gene sets in the study by Kim et al. ( ) included Myc module, PRC module, and Core module. In the investigation by Ben-Porath et al. ( ), NOS targets (Nanog targets, Sox2 targets, NOS targets, Oct4 targets, and NOS TFs), ES expressed (ES exp1 and ES exp2), Myc targets (Myc targets1 and Myc targets2), and Polycomb targets (PRC2 targets, Eed targets, Suz12 targets, and H3K27 bound) were selected. We also used two gene sets previously reported as important signatures whose expressions change significantly in human OSA stem cells (Rainusso et al. ). The modules obtained from the study by Rainusso et al. ( ) included highly upregulated or highly downregulated genes in OSA cells.
Gene set enrichment analysis
GSEA was carried out as previously described (Subramanian et al. ; Zamani-Ahmadmahmudi ). In GSEA, the expression of each gene set was assessed in microarray datasets and the result was recorded as the downregulation or upregulation of the desired gene set. We first performed GSEA on the gene sets by Kim et al. ( ) and then checked and confirmed primary findings in the modules by Ben-Porath et al. ( ) in more detail. GSEA on the OSA stem cell gene sets was also performed, separately.
Briefly, the expression profile of all the gene sets was assessed in the expression data of GSE16102 , GSE76128 , and GSE12512 to compare the enrichment patterns between the different phenotypes (i.e., OSA tumors vs. normal samples and OSA cell line vs. normal samples). In this analysis, when there were at least seven samples in each phenotype, the phenotype was defined as the permutation type; otherwise, the gene set was labeled as the permutation type. A result was considered significant if false discovery rate (FDR) was lower than 25%.
Leading edge analysis
After running GSEA, we carried out leading edge analysis, as previously explained (Subramanian et al. ). In this analysis, leading edge subsets (a subset of the genes contributing most to the enrichment score) were first identified for each gene set and then, the overlap between the extracted subset and the subsets of the other gene sets was determined and displayed as a set-to-set graph, where a more intense color density showed a higher overlap.
Development of prognostic gene signatures from dysregulated gene sets
Prognostic gene signatures were extracted from the gene set(s) showing significant and similar expression patterns in humans and dogs. Two datasets were employed as training and validation (test) groups, where the important prognostic gene(s) was identified in a group (training group) and then validated in the other dataset (validation group). GSE21257 and GSE39055 were used as training and validation datasets in humans, and GSE27217 and GSE14033 were used as training and validation datasets in dogs, respectively. All the following analyses were performed for humans and dogs, separately.
Gene expression signatures to predict survival were identified using a supervised method proposed by Lossos et al. . Briefly, critical genes contributing to the enrichment pattern in the OSA tissue/cell line dysregulated gene sets were first extracted and then, the genes common between the OSA and cell line were detected. Next, the association between the common critical genes and the patients’ survival was assessed using the Cox proportional hazard analysis. First, using the univariate Cox analysis, genes with a z score greater than 2 or less than − 2 (Lossos et al. ; Schetter et al. ) were selected for the multivariate Cox analysis. A positive score and a negative score indicated shorter and longer survival, respectively. In the multivariate Cox analysis, statistically significant genes were included into the analysis and significant covariate(s) was determined. Survival curves were drawn by the log-rank test and Kaplan–Meier approach. In all analysis, P values lower than 0.05 were considered significant.
Next, the external validation of the resulted prognostic genes was determined. The prognostic genes in each group were tested in the validation group via the Kaplan–Meier method and the log-rank test. All the survival analyses were performed using APPEX web-based tool (Kim et al. ), Survival ( http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=survival ) and Survcomp (Schroder et al. ) packages in the R programming environment.

Enrichment pattern of the ES and OSA gene sets in OSA tumors, cell lines, and normal tissues in human and canine samples
The enrichment patterns of the gene sets are summarized in Fig. 2 and Tables 2 and 3 . In general, among the analyzed gene sets, the ES gene sets presented more dysregulation (up/downregulation) changes. Among the OSA modules, the highly downregulated gene set showed a significant enrichment pattern (Fig. 2 ).

Canine
Respectively, 6 and 12 gene sets were significantly dysregulated in the canine OSA tissue and cell line compared to the normal tissue (Fig. 2 and Table 2 ). Nanog targets, NOS targets, Oct4 targets, and Sox2 targets were common upregulated gene sets in both canine OSA tissue and cell line. ES exp1, ES exp2, Myc, Myc targets1, Myc targets2, H3K27 bound, and PRC2 targets, and highly downregulated gene sets merely dysregulated in the canine OSA cell line. As anticipated, the H3K27 bound and PRC2 targets downregulated in the canine OSA cell line. Furthermore, the Eed targets and PRC modules dysregulated only in the canine OSA tissue.
Human
On the other hand, higher numbers of the modules were dysregulated in the human OSA compared to the canine OSA (Fig. 2 and Table 3 ). Additionally, the human OSA samples and cell line presented a more similar enrichment pattern compared to the canine findings. ES exp1, Myc, Myc targets1, Myc targets2, Nanog targets, NOS targets, Oct4 targets, and Sox2 targets, and highly downregulated gene sets were the common upregulated gene sets in the human OSA tissues and cell lines compared to the normal samples, while Suz12 targets, H3K27 bound, Eed targets, PRC2 targets, and PRC modules constituted the common downregulated modules (Fig. 2 and Table 3 ).
The human and canine OSA tumors/cell lines showed a similar enrichment pattern in some gene sets. However, this similarity was more striking between the canine OSA cell line and the human OSA tissue/cell line. Our analysis indicated that the Nanog targets, NOS target, Oct4 targets, and Sox2 targets were the common upregulated modules in the canine OSA tissue and the human OSA tissue/cell line. Moreover, the ES exp1, Myc module, Myc targets1, Myc targets2, Nanog targets, NOS targets, Oct4 targets, Sox2 targets, H3K27 bound, and PRC2 targets, and highly downregulated gene sets had a similar enrichment pattern in the canine OSA cell line and the human OSA tissue/cell line. Although the PRC module was dysregulated in both human and canine OSA tissues, its enrichment patterns were in an opposite manner (Fig. 2 and Tables 2 and 3 ). These findings implied a more similar enrichment pattern of the canine OSA cell line to the human counterpart than the canine OSA tissue.
Leading edge analysis
The leading edge analysis results are presented in Fig. 3 for canine and human datasets. Analysis indicated that there were two highlighted areas presenting a more intense overlap between the gene sets. One area presented Polycomb target modules (i.e., Suz12 targets, Eed targets, H3K27 bound, and PRC2 targets), while the other area presented NOS target modules (i.e., Nanog targets, Oct4 targets, Sox2 targets, and NOS targets). These results showed that similar elements (genes) in the Polycomb target modules and NOS target modules were enriched in the OSA tissue/cell line. These significant overlap areas were evident in both human and canine leading edge analyses, which demonstrated relatively similar leading edge genes involved in the Polycomb target and NOS target enrichment patterns in both species. Fig. 3 Leading edge analysis in canine ( a ) and human ( b ) gene sets. Two areas marking Polycomb target modules (i.e., Suz12 targets, Eed targets, H3K27 bound, and PRC2 targets) and NOS target modules (i.e., Nanog targets, Oct4 targets, Sox2 targets, and NOS targets) presented a more intense overlap
Development of prognostic signatures
In the final step, we tried to develop prognostic gene signatures extracted from the dysregulated gene sets. However, we limited this analysis to the gene sets presenting similar enrichment patterns in the human and canine OSA tissues and cell lines. Hence, the NOS target modules (i.e., Nanog targets, Oct4 targets, Sox2 targets, and NOS targets) were selected for survival analysis because these gene sets were upregulated in the human and canine OSA tissues/cell lines (Fig. 2 ). Additionally, as demonstrated in the leading edge analysis, these four gene sets had a significant overlap, indicating similar genes contributing to their enrichment patterns. Therefore, the desired gene sets were merged to provide a single gene set subjected to the survival analysis. For this purpose, genes contributing to the enrichment pattern in each gene set were first pulled out and the genes common among all the gene sets were identified. The common genes were subjected to univariate and multivariate Cox analysis analyses. Fifty-two common genes contributing to the enrichment pattern of the NOS targets were identified in the canine and human gene sets (Fig. 4 ). The gene ontology (GO) analysis of the common genes was performed in DAVID tool (Huang et al. ) and indicated that these genes played a role in similar pathways in humans and dogs, where they were majorly involved in cell division and related issues (Supplementary Table 1 as an excel file). Fig. 4 NOS target modules (i.e., Nanog targets, Oct4 targets, Sox2 targets, and NOS targets) were first merged and then explored to find common genes between human and canine gene sets. The merged modules in human and dog contained 230 and 142 genes, respectively, where 52 genes were found to be common elements (common yellow part)
The results of the Cox analysis for dog and human are summarized in Tables 4 and 5 , respectively. In the canine dataset, univariate Cox analysis on the GSE27217 dataset delivered ten genes with a significant z score (lower than − 2 and P value < 0.05) (Table 4 ). In the next step, these genes were evaluated in multivariate Cox analysis. Four genes—namely KCNMB4 , SERPINH1 , CYP1B1 , and DPYSL3 —were statistically robust survival predictors (all z scores < − 2 and P values < 0.05). We constructed a model based on the relative contributions of each of the four genes in the multivariate analysis, as described in the following equation: $$ \mathrm{Mortality}-\mathrm{predictor}\ \mathrm{score}={z}_1{G}_1+{z}_2{G}_2+{z}_3{G}_3+{z}_4{G}_4 $$ Table 4 Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis NOS target gene signatures in the GSE27217 (canine) dataset.

where z is z scores resulted in the multivariate analysis and G is the expression value of each gene. The mortality-predictor score was calculated for each sample, and then, the median value of the mortality-predictor score was determined. Finally, the samples were classified into two groups (greater than and less than the median value), and survival times were compared between the two groups using the Kaplan–Meier analysis. The results revealed that the constructed model clearly predicted survival times in the two groups because survival time was statistically different between the two groups ( P value = 0.013) (Fig. 5 a). Fig. 5 Survival analysis for evaluation of correlation between prognostic gene signature and survival time in canine training ( a ) and validation ( b ) datasets. Survival time was significantly different between groups constituted based on prognostic signature in training ( P = 0.013) and validation ( P = 0.016) datasets
Additionally, the predictor models were tested in another dataset ( GSE14033 ) as the validation group. To this end, the mortality-predictor score was calculated for each sample, grouping was carried out, and the survival times were compared between the two groups as described above. Our analysis indicated that the model was able to predict survival in the two groups because the survival times were significantly different between the two groups reconstructed in the validation dataset based on the predictor genes ( P value = 0.016) (Fig. 5 b).
The univariate Cox analysis on human dataset ( GSE21257 ) provided 21 genes with the desired z score (greater than 2 or less than − 2) (Table 5 ). However, the multivariate Cox analysis indicated that only two genes (i.e., SEMA3C and MCTS1 ) reached to a significant level ( z score = 2.132 ( P = 0.033) and − 2.159 ( P = 0.031), respectively). Hence, the predictor model was reconstructed based on these two genes. Similar to the canine findings, survival time was significantly different between two groups reconstructed in the training ( GSE21257 ) and validation ( GSE39055 ) datasets based on the predictor genes ( P value = 0.008 and 0.017, respectively) (Fig. 6 a, b). Fig. 6 Survival analysis for evaluation of correlation between prognostic gene signature and survival time in human training ( a ) and validation ( b ) datasets. Survival time was significantly different between groups constituted based on prognostic signature in training ( P = 0.0082) and validation ( P = 0.017) datasets
Discussion
In the current study, we tried to explore the comparative enrichment patterns of ES and OSA modules in canine and human OSA tumor samples, OSA cell lines, and normal tissues to find the possible similarities and differences. Various canine cancers were explored in a comparative manner to reveal possible similarities and differences with the human counterparts (Klopfleisch et al. , ; Zamani-Ahmadmahmudi et al. ; Zamani-Ahmadmahmudi ; Zamani-Ahmadmahmudi et al. ). Previous studies have confirmed strong similarities in the gene expression patterns between canine and human OSA and proposed dogs as an ideal translational model in the investigation of OSA (Paoloni et al. ; Selvarajah et al. ; Scott et al. ).
Previous investigations have evaluated various gene sets in different cancers. Wong et al. ( ) and Mizuno et al. ( ) suggested over-activity of the ESC-like module in various cancers—including liver, breast, prostate, and lung cancers. In the same way, the expression of embryonic transcription factors was evaluated in other cancers in studies conducted by Gidekel et al. ( ) and Bass et al. ( ). Kim et al. ( ) tested the expression of four ES modules—namely Myc, PRC, ESC-like, and Core modules—in myeloid/lymphoid leukemia, and bladder and breast cancers. Their analysis revealed upregulation in the Myc and ESC-like gene sets and repression in the PRC module, while the expression level of the Core factors did not change significantly. In another study, Ben-Porath et al. ( ) investigated the enrichment pattern of 13 ES gene sets—namely NOS targets ( n = 5), Polycomb targets ( n = 4), Myc targets ( n = 2), and ES expressed ( n = 2)—in histologically poorly differentiated breast cancer and glioma. They reported the overexpression of genes normally enriched in ES (i.e., ES expressed1/2) and NOS target modules along with the suppression of the Polycomb target modules. Furthermore, they reported that the overexpression of the ES exp1 together with the underexpression of the PRC2 targets was associated with poor clinical outcomes in patients with breast cancer. Similarly, in the current study, we found that the NOS targets, ES expressed, and Myc modules were overexpressed and the Polycomb target modules (H3K27 bound and PRC2 targets) were underexpressed in the human OSA tissue/cell line and the canine OSA cell line. However, the canine OSA tissue presented similarities at a lower degree. Our analysis revealed that the enrichment patterns of the studied gene sets in the canine OSA cell line were more similar to those in the human OSA tissue and OSA cell line. In the canine OSA tissue, although the NOS target modules were upregulated, the Polycomb targets remained unchanged or occasionally upregulated (e.g., Eed targets and PRC module). It seems that the canine OSA cell line, comprising homogenous cell population, was able to present more similar results to the human findings. The heterogeneous nature of OSA mixed with bone, relative paucity of tumor samples available, and the small number of samples (Baird et al. ; Paoloni et al. ) can be the possible reasons for the lower similarities between the canine OSA tissue and the human tissue/cell line. The canine OSA tissue samples used in the present study were majorly provided by definitive surgery, while the human tissue samples were collected using biopsy (see sample collection protocols in GEO). Hence, the canine OSA tissue may have had a heterogeneous nature, where the tumor cells mixed with the normal and non-tumoral components.
In the current study, the NOS target modules were identified as the most significant ES gene sets inasmuch as they presented similar enrichment patterns across the human and canine OSA tissues/cell lines. Additionally, we found a correlation between some of the gene sets (NOS targets) and the outcome of the human/canine cases with OSA. NOS targets are genes upregulated as the targets of the transcription factors NANOG, OCT4, and Sox2. The overexpression of Oct4 and Sox2 along with Klf4 and c-Myc in 18 out of the 40 cancer types was confirmed and suggested that the expression of these genes correlated with tumor progression or worsening prognosis (Schoenhals et al. ). The overexpression of OCT4, as an ES marker, has been previously shown in bladder cancer (Atlasi et al. ). In addition, previous investigations have considered some ES gene sets such as Myc modules, ES exp1 set, and PRC2 targets as prognostic factors in human cancers such as breast cancers (Ben-Porath et al. ; Kim et al. ).
Our analysis revealed that some genes in the NOS target module were potent prognostic elements including SERPINH1 , CYP1B1 , DPYSL3 , KCNMB4 , MCTS1 , and SEMA3C . SERPINH1 was considered as a potential diagnostic biomarker for cholangiocellular carcinoma (CCC) with a specificity of 98% and a sensitivity of 64% (Padden et al. ). Similarly, this gene has been identified to be involved in the progression of head and neck carcinomas and gastric cancer (Ollins et al. ; Zhang et al. ). Zhang et al. ( ) proposed an eight-gene signature including SERPINH1 with significant expression differences between gastric cancer and normal gastric tissues (Zhang et al. ). Overexpression of CYP1B1 was detected in the breast, prostate, ovary, and uterus cancer tissues compared to normal adjacent tissues (Gajjar et al. ). In a study by Dhaini et al. ( ), overexpression of CYP1B1 was detected in 67% cases with the osteosarcoma, but CYP3A4/5 could predict metastasis and poor prognosis in the studied patients (Dhaini et al. ). Upregulation of DPYSL3 was detected in patients with the neuroblastoma (NB), where it could mark those patients who may have a better overall survival (Tan et al. ). Additionally, DPYSL3 was considered as a critical biomarker and drug target in patients with the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (Kawahara et al. ). Finally, recent studies showed that SEMA3C was involved in the progression of glioma (Vaitkienė et al. ) and gastric cancer (Miyato et al. ) and could be a potential prognostic element (Vaitkienė et al. ).
In conclusion, we showed some similarities in the expression patterns of ES gene sets between human and canine osteosarcoma (especially canine OSA cell line), where some gene sets were considered as potent prognostic factors. Additionally, our findings confirmed NOS targets as the most important ES gene sets showing comparable enrichment pattern and prognostic efficacy in human and dog. Further investigations can explore this gene set in human and canine OSA in the more details. Future studies with the larger datasets deposited in the public databases can provide more reliable and robust results.
