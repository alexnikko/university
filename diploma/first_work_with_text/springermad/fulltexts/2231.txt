Introduction
Up-to-dately, the most effective therapy for ischemic stroke is the tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), but it has its own limitations: narrow therapeutic window and adverse effects [ ]. Therefore, it is of great interest to investigate the critical pathogenic mechanisms and targets for new drug development. The blockage of blood supply to the central nervous system (CNS) during ischemic stroke causes a reduction of energy generation and a burst increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS); the latter has been indicated as a key pathological factor in ischemic brain injury [ ]. Unfortunately, many pharmaceutical agents inhibit ROS in the early experimental stage but have no significant clinical benefits. One possible reason is that these agents may only scavenge extracellular ROS with limited ability to inhibit oxidative damage of intracellular macromolecules. Therefore, it is important to identify new compounds that can inhibit the generation of or scavenge intracellular ROS.
β-Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrate (NAD + ) participates in various signaling pathways, including aging; gene expression; calcium homeostasis and immunological and mitochondrial functions [ , , ]; and several cellular enzymatic reactions, such as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) and a mammalian family of deacetylase called sirtuins (SIRT1–7). It has been found that the cellular NAD + was significantly depleted and underwent ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury [ , ] and exogenous NAD + supplementation elevated intracellular NAD + levels and reduced hypoxia/reperfusion-induced cell death and oxidative stress-induced death of primary cultured neurons [ , , ]. In our recent study, in an effort to define the therapeutic window of NAD + , we found that exogenous NAD + supplementation had therapeutic effects in the models of stroke both in vivo and in vitro only when given during the early time period of reperfusion (reoxygenation).
NADPH is a coenzyme involved in energy metabolism and mitochondrial functions and can provide redox power to antioxidant systems [ ]. Previously, we found that NADPH, a metabolic product of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), has a therapeutic efficacy with relatively large therapeutic window in ischemic stroke [ ]. However, NADPH is expensive and there is a potential that a large dose of NADPH may be used by NADPH oxidase (NOX) to produce ROS, the properties of which may hurdle the clinical application of NADPH.
To combat the limitations of both NAD + and NADPH, we considered a combination of NAD + and NADPH to treat brain ischemic stroke. We predicted that the combination of NAD + and NADPH could more effectively improve ischemia-induced metabolic crisis and overcome the disadvantages of NAD + and NADPH. The results of this study highlighted the promise of the combination of NAD + and NADPH for ischemic stroke treatment.
Materials and Methods
Cell Culture and OGD/R Model
Primary cultures of cortical neurons were prepared from ICR mouse embryos which had 17 embryonic days as previously described [ ]. All experiments were performed using cortical neurons which were cultured for 8 days in vitro. To model ischemia-like condition in vitro, we used oxygen–glucose deprivation and followed by reoxygenation (OGD/R) as described previously [ ]. The primary cortical neurons were washed two times with glucose-free Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS) (in mM, 116 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 0.8 MgSO 4 , 1.0 NaH 2 PO 4 , 1.8 CaCl 2 , and 26 NaHCO 3 , pH 7.3), incubated with HBSS, and placed in a chamber (Billups-Rothenberg, San Diego, CA, USA) which was filled with 95% N 2 and 5% CO 2 at 37 °C for 4 h. Control cells were treated with HBSS which contain 3 mM d -glucose and were incubated under normal culture conditions for the same time period. After OGD, the primary neurons were replaced with the normal culture medium and were cultured under normal conditions for the indicated time.
Animal MCAO/R model
Male ICR mice weighing 25–30 g were purchased from SLACCAL Lab Animal Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The animals were kept in a humidity- and temperature-controlled environment with a 12-h light–dark cycle and allowed access to a standard diet and water ad libitum. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) surgery was performed as described previously [ ]. The mice were subjected to MCAO with a silicone-coated nylon (6–0) monofilament (Doccol Corporation, USA) for 2 h. After 2 h, the occluding filament was withdrawn to allow blood reperfusion. Mice were sacrificed after I/R at the indicated time. A homoeothermic heating blanket was used to maintain the core body temperature at 37 °C during I/R operation.
In Vitro and In Vivo Drug Administration
NAD + was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA, N7004) and prepared with H 2 O. In in vitro studies, NAD + was added directly to the cultured medium at the concentration of 15 mmol/L 30 min prior to OGD, in the process of OGD for 4 h, or after OGD at different indicated durations. The primary neurons were treated with 10 μmol/L NADPH (Roche); dissolved in sterile water, for 4 h, before OGD; and then subjected to OGD/R for the indicated time (in the presence of NADPH).
In in vivo studies, NAD + (12.5–50 mg/kg) or NADPH (2.5 or 7.5 mg/kg), dissolved in 0.9% saline solution, was administered to mice via tail vein at the onset of reperfusion or at the indicated time after reperfusion.
Cell Viability Assay
Briefly, neurons cultured in 96-well plates with 1 × 10 5 cells/well were exposed to experimental treatments for designated time periods. Cell viability was evaluated with 3-(4,5-dimethylthhylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT; Sangon Biotech) at 24 h after reoxygenation. Then, the absorbance was measured at wavelengths of 490 and 630 nm with a microplate reader (Gene Company Limited, HongKong, China).
LDH Assay
The viability of the cultured neurons treated with NAD + was measured at 24 h after OGD with lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay. OGD-induced cell death was quantified by measuring LDH release from damaged cells into the culture medium, using a LDH assay kit (Beyotime, Nantong, China) following manufacturer’s instruction.
Measurement of Infarct Volume
The mice were anesthetized with 1% pentobarbital sodium, and the brains were rapidly removed at 24 h after MCAO. The brain was cut into five sections (2 mm thick) and incubated in 1% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent, China) for 20 min at 42 °C. Infarct volume was expressed as a percentage of the total hemisphere [ ].
Measurement of ROS, GSH, MDA, and ATP Levels
For measuring intracellular ROS, primary neurons were treated with NAD + and then were incubated with 1 μM dihydroethidium (DHE, Sigma, USA) for 30 min at 37 °C at 3 h after reoxygenation. For assessing ROS in vivo, DHE (2 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally 1 h before the end of the experiment. Mice were anesthetized and decapitated, and the brain sections (10 μm) were cut with a cryostat (Leica 4802A, NuBloch, Germany). Fluorescence intensity was measured with an inverted fluorescent microscopy (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).
Intracellular concentrations of reduced gulathione (rGSH), malonydialdehyde (MDA), and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) were measured 3 h after reoxygenation/reperfusion in primary cortical neurons or in mice. The levels of rGSH and GSSG and MDA and ATP were determined with a GSH/GSSH assay kit (Beyotime, Nantong, China), MDA assay kit (Jiancheng, Nanjing, China), or ATP assay kit (Beyotime, Nantong, China) following manufacturer’s instructions.
Behavioral Tests
A battery of behavioral tests was performed 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after transient MCAO (tMCAO) as described previously by two investigators who were blinded to the experimental conditions.
Beam Walk Test
The beam walk test was applied to evaluate the motor integration and the balance function of mice. For this test, mice were put on a 91-cm-long beam. The beam 35-mm-wide was paralleled to the floor and elevated 57 cm from the table. Mice were trained to independently complete the walk through the balance beam twice 1 day in advance. The beam balance performance of mice was evaluated by the time spent from one end of the beam to the other. The time to cross the beam that was recorded was only the crawling time from three repetitive tests by a recovery period of 1 h after each test [ ]. The data were presented as the mean of three tests per animal.
Rotarod Test
A day before the actual test, mice were placed on a rotarod cylinder, set at a fixed speed of 4 rpm, for a 3-min training time. On the actual day of the test, the rotarod cylinder accelerated from 4 to 40 rpm over 300 s. The maximum latency time for the mice to fall from the rotarod, up to a limit of 300 s, was recorded [ ]. The data were presented as the mean of three tests per animal.
Y Maze Test
The Y maze test was performed to assess the ability of learning and memory of mice. The experimental apparatus was consist of a black-painted symmetrical Y maze. Each arm of the Y maze was 35 cm long, 15 cm high, and 10 cm wide and was positioned at an equal angle [ ]. First, each mouse was placed in one of the arms at random and allowed to explore freely through the maze for 3 min with the electric power off. Then, electric shocks were available through the stainless steel grid floor in two of the arms, and the light was on in the shock-free arm. This test was evaluated on the time when the mice entered the shock-free arm. Each mouse was separately experimented three times. The data were presented as the mean of three experiments per animal.
Comet Assay
Comet assay was used to quantitatively measure DNA damage at the individual cell level as previously described [ ]. At least 50 cells per sample were analyzed, and the comet tail length and percentage of DNA in the tail were measured with a comet assay software project (CaspLab-Comet Assay Software Project Lab).
Western Blot Analysis
Immunoblotting was performed according to the method described previously [ ]. The brain samples were prepared from the cortexes of mice at the indicated time after reperfusion, were separated on 6–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and were transferred onto a nitrocellulose filter membrane with a glycine transfer buffer. The working dilutions for the following monoclonal antibodies were used per the manufacturer’s suggestions and previous experience: anti-phosphorylation of ataxia telangiectasia_mutate (pATM) (1:1000; Abcam, ab36810), anti-ataxia telangiectasia_mutate (ATM) (1:1000; Abcam, ab199726), anti-γH2A.X (1:1000; Abcam, ab2893), anti-phosphorylation of ATM and Rad3-related (pATR) (1:1000; CST, #2853), anti-ATR (1:1000; CST, #13934), anti-4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) (1:1000; Abcam, ab46545), anti-nitrotyrosine (1:1000; Millipore, 05–233), anti-PARP-1 (1:500; Santa, sc-7150), anti-Bcl-2 (1:200; Santa, sc-492), anti-Bax (1:200; Santa, sc-526), anti-Caspase-3 (1:1000; Enzo, ADI-AAP-113), anti-Caspase-9 (1:1000; CST, #9508), anti-receptor interacting protein 1 (RIP1) (1:1000; BD, 610,459), anti-receptor interacting protein 3 (RIP3) (1:1000; ProSci, 2283), and mouse anti-β-actin (1:5000; Sigma, #A5441). The image was captured with the Odyssey infrared imaging system (Li-Cor Bioscience) for the final determination of protein expression with ImageJ launcher. The signal intensity was normalized to the loading control (β-actin).
Statistics
Data were expressed as mean ± SEM and were evaluated with one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple-comparison test when comparing three or more groups. Two-way ANOVA was applied followed by Bonferroni’s post hoc test to analyze behavioral data. For comparison between two groups, the unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test was used. A difference less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
NAD+ Ameliorates Metabolic Stress
To demonstrate the role of NAD + in the I/R-induced ROS stress, we treated the primary cortical neurons with or without NAD + (15 mmol/L). After OGD/R, the intracellular ROS levels rapidly increased and NAD + markedly attenuated the rises of ROS when neurons were treated with NAD + at the onset of reoxygenation (Supplementary Fig. 1 A). Moreover, NAD + (15 mmol/L) significantly inhibited OGD/R-induced decreases in the levels of the rGSH and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and blocked the increases in the levels of MDA when neurons were treated with it at the onset of reoxygenation (Supplementary Fig. 1 B–D). However, NAD + had no effect on the levels of ROS and rGSH when neurons were treated with it before or during the whole period of OGD (Supplementary Fig. 2 A–C). Similar anti-oxidative effects of NAD + (50 mg/kg) were also obtained in in vivo studies. NAD + reduced the levels of ROS and MDA and increased the levels of rGSH and SOD in mice brains (Supplementary Fig. 1 E–H). These results suggested that NAD + could attenuate oxidative stress induced by I/R both in vitro and in vivo.
To evaluate the effects of NAD + (15 mmol/L, 50 mg/kg) on energy metabolism in in vitro and in vivo models of stroke, we determined the effects of NAD + on the levels of ATP and lactic acid (LD) in primary neurons and mouse brains after brain ischemic stroke. The results showed that NAD + remarkably inhibited the decreases in the levels of ATP and blocked the increases in the levels of LD both in neurons after OGD/R and in mice brains after I/R insult (Supplementary Fig. 3 ).
NAD+ Exhibits a Narrow Therapeutic Window in Stroke Models
The present study detected the intracellular NAD + concentration in primary neurons after treatment with exogenous NAD + . The results showed that the addition of NAD + to cell medium under the normal condition significantly increased intracellular concentration of NAD + and suppressed the decrease in NAD + content induced by OGD/R (Supplementary Fig. 4 A). There was a low NAD + concentration in the PBS buffer that was used for the final washing of the cells, indicating NAD + measured was mainly an intracellular one (Supplementary Table 1 ). To determine the dose–response of neuroprotection of NAD + , primary neurons were treated with increasing concentrations of NAD + (3.25, 7.5, 15 mmol/L) at the onset of reoxygenation after OGD. The results showed that NAD + at the concentration of 15 mmol/L markedly increased cell viability (Fig. 1 b). To determine when the supply of exogenous NAD + could produce optimal effect, NAD + at the concentration of 15 mmol/L was added directly to the neuronal culture 30 min prior to OGD but was then removed during OGD, added to medium at the onset of OGD, or added at the onset of reoxygenation. NAD + treatment remarkably attenuated OGD/R-induced cell death when it was added at the onset of reoxygenation after OGD. No neuroprotection was obtained if NAD + was given before OGD. Moreover, when NAD + was present during the entire course of OGD and reperfusion, it produced a detrimental effect on the viability of neurons (Fig. 1 a, c). In addition, NAD + prevented LDH release when it was added at the onset of reoxygenation (Fig. 1 d). NAD + itself at the concentration used did not lead to cell death or change the morphology of cultured neurons (Supplementary Fig. 2 D). To determine the therapeutic window, NAD + was added to cultures at 0, 1, 2, or 4 h after reoxygenation. The results showed that NAD + provided the best protective effects on neurons when applied at the onset of reoxygenation (0 h). In contrast, NAD + treatment initiated at 1, 2, or 4 h after reoxygenation only exerted mild neuroprotective effects (Fig. 1 e). Similar neuroprotective effects were observed on OGD/R-induced release of LDH (Fig. 1 f). The protective effect of NAD + was also confirmed using morphological assessment. The photomicrographs showed the preservation of normal neuronal morphology in NAD + -treated neurons if NAD + was added at the onset of reoxygenation after OGD (Supplementary Fig. 2 D). These results suggested that NAD + could protect primary cultured cortical neurons against OGD/R-induced damage. Fig. 1 NAD + replenishment protected neurons against OGD/R in vitro and ischemia–reperfusion in vivo. a Experimental design: NAD + at the concentration of 15 mM was administrated to the primary cortical neurons. a, 0.5 h before OGD; b, 4 h during OGD; c, at the onset of reoxygenation; a, b, c, Cell were treated with NAD + (15 mM) for 0.5 h before OGD and then subjected to OGD/reoxygenation for 24 h (in the presence of NAD + ).

Various doses of NAD + were added to cultures immediately at the onset of reoxygenation, or NAD + (15 mM) was added to the primary cortical neurons at the indicated time. *** P < 0.001 vs Non-OGD Con; ## P < 0.01; ### P < 0.001 vs OGD/R Con. n = 3. d The effects of NAD + on the LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) levels of neurons 24 h after OGD/R. *** P < 0.001 vs Non-OGD Con; ### P < 0.001 vs OGD/R Con. e Time–course of neuroprotection of NAD + with MTT assay. *** P < 0.001 vs Non-OGD Con; ### P < 0.001 vs OGD/R Con. f Time–course of neuroprotection of NAD + with LDH assay. *** P < 0.001 vs Non-OGD Con; ### P < 0.001 vs OGD/R Con. n = 3 ( b – f ). g The effects of NAD + on brain damage were detected with TTC staining 24 h after I/R.

To determine if exogenous NAD + can penetrate the blood brain barrier and be used by the brain neurons, we detected the concentration of NAD + in the brain tissue after intravenous injection of NAD + . The results showed that I/R caused a significant reduction of NAD + levels in the brain. However intravenous injection of exogenous NAD + could maintain a higher level of NAD + compared with the sham or vehicle-treated group (Supplementary Fig. 4 B). To further confirm the effects of NAD + administration on the brain I/R injury in the mouse model of ischemic stroke, we measured the infarct volume 24 h after reperfusion to assess the effects of NAD + with different doses or administered at different time points. The results showed that NAD + could markedly reduce the ischemic brain damage in a dose-dependent manner and 50 mg/kg exhibited the best efficacy (Fig. 1 g). In addition, 50 mg/kg NAD + improved the neurological deficiency and decreased the water content in the brain after I/R insult (Supplementary Fig. 5 A and B). Moreover, 50 mg/kg NAD + was effective in reducing the infract volume only when it was administrated within 2 h after reperfusion (Fig. 1 h). The beneficial effects of 50 mg/kg NAD + on the neurological deficiency and water content could be observed when it was given within 2 h after reperfusion (Supplementary Fig. 5 C and D).
Combination of NADPH and NAD+ Offers Greater Neuroprotective Effects
To study the therapeutic effects of NAD + in combination with NADPH, primary cultured cortical neurons were subjected to OGD/R (Fig. 2 a), and the combination of NADPH and NAD + could significantly increase the survival of neuronal cells after OGD/R injury. There was an obvious difference between the combination of NAD + and NADPH and NADPH alone, but no significant difference was observed between the combination of NAD + and NADPH and NAD + alone (Fig. 2 b). Then, we detected the effects of NAD + and NADPH on the oxidative stress and energy metabolism after ischemic stroke. The combination of NAD + and NADPH could further inhibit the OGD/R-induced oxidative stress, by attenuating the levels of ROS and MDA and elevating the cellular levels of rGSH (Fig. 2 c–e). The combination treatment also enhanced the energy metabolism by significantly increasing the ATP levels after OGD/R injury (Fig. 2 f). Fig. 2 Combination of NAD + and NADPH reduced the OGD/R-induced injury in vitro. a Experimental design: NADPH at the concentration of 10 μM was administrated to the primary cortical neurons three times during the experiment while 15 mM NAD + was added only immediately after reoxygenation. b The effects of NADPH and NAD + on neuronal viability with MTT assay. *** P < 0.001 vs Non-OGD Con; ### P < 0.001 vs OGD/R Con; &&& P < 0.001 vs OGD/R NADPH. c Representative images of DHE fluorescence (left lane) and quantitative analysis of the levels of ROS (right lane) in neurons 3 h after OGD/R.

In in vivo studies, mice were treated with NAD + (50 mg/kg) and NADPH (2.5 or 7.5 mg/kg) immediately after reperfusion. Compared with mice treated with NADPH alone, combined treatment of NAD + and NADPH produced significantly greater effects on I/R-induced damage by reducing the infarct volume (Fig. 3 a, b). In an attempt to overcome the narrow therapeutic window of NAD + , we combined the NAD + and NADPH in the brain ischemia to test if NADPH could extend therapeutic window of NAD + . Mice were administered with 7.5 mg/kg NADPH immediately after reperfusion and 50 mg/kg NAD + at 4 h after reperfusion. The results showed that NAD + alone had no effect on infarct size, while animals which received a combination of NAD + and NADPH showed a smaller infarct size (Fig. 3 c). However, NAD + could not extend therapeutic window of NADPH when administrated in company with NAD + after reperfusion (Fig. 3 d). Taken together, NAD + could produce better neuroprotection when combined with a low dose of NADPH, and NADPH could extend the therapeutic window of NAD + . In addition, we also found that treatment of NAD + and NADPH in the MCAO animals slightly increased cerebral blood flow after reperfusion (Supplementary Fig. 6 ). Fig. 3 Combination of NAD + and NADPH reduced the ischemia–reperfusion injury in vivo. a Experimental design (left panel): Mice were subjected to tMCAO for 2 h, and NAD + (50 mg/kg) and NADPH (2.5 mg/kg) were intravenously administered at the onset of reperfusion.

To further confirm the better protective effects of the combination of NAD + and NADPH, we evaluated the long-term benefits in mice subjected to I/R injury. Mice were administrated with NAD + (50 mg/kg) and NADPH (7.5 mg/kg) at the onset of reperfusion after tMCAO. The results showed that although both NAD + and NADPH alone reduced the atrophy of the ischemic hemisphere (Fig. 4 a, b) and the recovery of neurological functions (Fig. 4 d–g) and increased long-term survival (Fig. 4 c) 28 days post I/R, the combination of NAD + and NADPH showed slightly more robust effects.

Combination of NADPH and NAD+ Inhibits Multiple Cell Death Pathways
The present study evaluated the effects of NAD + and NADPH on oxidative damage and consecutive apoptosis in mice. The results showed that NAD + and NADPH replenishment robustly inhibited the ischemia-induced elevation of 4-HNE, which was an index of lipid oxidation, at 16 h after reperfusion (Fig. 5 a). At 8 and 16 h after reperfusion, the nitrotyrosine, an indicator of NO-mediated oxidative protein damage, increased significantly (Supplementary Fig. 7 A and B). NAD + and NADPH robustly attenuated the increases in the levels of nitrotyrosine (Fig. 5 b). Oxidative DNA damage is a severe consequence of oxidative stress that, if not repaired, will result in cell death via activation of several pathways [ ]. We investigated the DNA damage to further explore the role of NAD + and NADPH on oxidative damage. The results showed that the administration of NAD + or NAPDH immediately after reoxygenation in the primary cortical neurons reduced the tail length and DNA content in tails (Fig. 5 c). γH2A.X, a protein that responds to DNA damage, which was upregulated at 8 and 16 h after reperfusion (Supplementary Fig. 7 A and B), was suppressed by NAD + or NADPH during reperfusion in the ischemic cortex (Fig. 5 d). In these studies, the combination of NADPH and NAD + did not show enhanced anti-oxidation activity. Meanwhile, in vivo studies showed that NAD + and NADPH inhibited I/R-induced pATM and pATR, which were known to play distinct roles in DNA damage (Fig. 5 d). These results suggested that NAD + or NADPH replenishment attenuated the stroke-induced DNA damage both in in vivo and in vitro studies; the combination of NAD + and NADPH also had no additional benefit. Fig. 5 NADPH and NAD + replenishment attenuated ischemic-induced oxidative damage.

After the I/R insult, there were significant increases in cleaved PARP-1, Bax, and cleaved caspase 9 and cleaved caspase 3 proteins and anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 was downregulated at 16 h (Supplementary Fig. 7 C–F). As results showed that both NAD + and NADPH could inhibit I/R-induced cleavage of PARP, activation of caspase 9 and caspase 3, and downregulation of Bcl-2, the combined application of NAD + and NADPH could produce greater effects compared to NAD + or NADPH alone with lower levels of cleaved PARP-1 and Bax and higher levels of Bcl-2. There were no significant differences on cleaved caspase 3 protein levels in the combination of NAD + and NADPH compared to NAD + - or NADPH-alone group (Fig. 6 a). Furthermore, NAD + could significantly inhibit the ischemia-induced RIP1 protein but had no effect on RIP3 protein; both of them are the mediators of necroptosis. Either NADPH alone or the combination with NAD + attenuated RIP1 and RIP3 protein upregulations caused by I/R insult (Fig. 6 b).

Discussion
It was vital to maintain intracellular NAD + levels to promote cell survival after ischemia [ ]. The novel findings of the present study included the following: (1) The combination of NAD + and NADPH extended the therapeutic window of NAD + and produced greater neuroprotective effects, and (2) the combined medication more effectively suppressed signaling pathways of apoptosis and necroptosis after ischemic stroke. The current results suggest that the combined application of NAD + and NADPH may provide a novel therapy for ischemic stroke.
It has been reported that NAD + supplementation was effective in protecting neurons against oxidative stress-induced death [ ]. Our current results demonstrated that the administration of NAD + reduced the oxidative stress and increased the production of ATP during reoxygenation or reperfusion. Consistent with Alano [ ], our study demonstrated that exogenous NAD + could get into brain and neurons and was quite potent in protecting neurons from OGD/R injury. However, our study found that the neuroprotective window of NAD + on ischemic injury was relatively narrow. The protective effects were only seen after NAD + was administered within 2 h after reperfusion in mice. Although the NAD + has an excellent therapeutic effect on cerebral I/R, the relatively large dose and small therapeutic window of NAD + would limit the potential of clinical application. Therefore, to solve this problem is imminent and beneficial for stroke therapy.
Our previous results found that NADPH has a therapeutic effect on ischemic stroke [ ]. However, NADPH is very expensive and excess amount of exogenous NADPH may be used for production of ROS by NO x , which are the limitations for use in both clinical and basic researches. This prompts us to evaluate if the combination of NAD + and NADPH can overcome the disadvantages associated with both NAD + and NADPH and provide better therapeutic effects. Our current study found that the combination of NAD + and NADPH significantly protected neurons from OGD/R-induced cell death in vitro. In our in vivo study, NAD + was effective only when it was given within 2 h after reperfusion. However, in the presence of NADPH, NAD + was effective within 5 h after reperfusion. On the other hand, the combination of NAD + and NADPH reduced the dose of NADPH for desired therapeutic effects. Furthermore, combined medication significantly reduced long-term mortality and improved the functional recovery after ischemic stroke. NADPH could prolong the therapeutic window of NAD + , whereas NAD + could reduce the dosage of NADPH to attain the desired strength of protective effects. Moreover, the present data demonstrated that both NAD + and NADPH produced long-term beneficial effects on brain atrophy, recovery of motor and cognitive functions, and post-stroke survival. Furthermore, the studies also suggest that the combination of NAD + and NADPH could produce better long-term effects.
The present study further investigated the underlying mechanisms of the protective effects of the combined use of NAD + and NADPH. GSH is a vital intracellular antioxidant and has a critical role in the function of antioxidant enzymes. The present study found that NAD + and NADPH maintained the higher levels of rGSH. The combination of NAD + and NADPH reduced ROS levels more effectively and improved ATP generation after I/R insults. Replenishment of both NAD + and NADPH robustly blocked oxidative damage of lipid and protein in the ischemic cortex as indicated by reducing the I/R-induced 4-HNE and nitrotyrosine levels. PARP-1 is essential in the regulation of DNA repair and cell death. ATM plays a vital role in DNA damage, especially double-stranded breaks (DSBs), while ATR is activated in response to persistent single-stranded DNA. Both NAD + and NADPH remarkably attenuated OGD/R-induced DNA damage. Western blot results suggested that mice treated with NAD + or NADPH had lower levels of pATM, pATR, and γH2A.X. These results demonstrated that exogenous NAD + and NADPH suppressed I/R-induced DNA damage. However, the combination of NAD + and NADPH did not produce additional benefits on ischemic-induced oxidative damage of macromolecules.
The proteolytic cleavage of PRAP by caspase 3 is the early event or precursor condition in apoptosis. Our current results showed that NAD + and NADPH could suppress the I/R-induced cleavage of PRAP and activation of caspase 3 and reduce the I/R-induced decline in anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Studies have shown that necrotic cell death is common in a wide variety of pathological conditions, such as stroke [ ]. Necroptosis has broad research prospects for therapeutic targets of cerebral ischemia [ ]. RIP1 plays a critical role in necroptosis, which is known for its role in NF-κB activation. The kinase activity of RIP3 has also been proposed to be required for necroptosis. Our results demonstrated that both NAD + and NADPH had inhibitory effects on RIP1 and RIP3. In the present study, the combination of NAD + and NADPH produced greater effects on these cell death pathways and, therefore, may more effectively inhibit a broad array of signaling pathways involving ischemic neuronal injury and cell death.
In the present study, we found that when NAD + was given before OGD/R, no beneficial effect was observed in in vitro studies. Moreover, when NAD + was presented during the entire course of OGD, it produced a detrimental effect on the viability of neurons. The cause of these observations was unknown. We speculated that the persistent presence of exogenous NAD + may cause excessive PARP1 activation, which could induce activation of caspase-3. In addition, exogenous NAD + may change the ratio of NAD + /NADH and induce the dysregulation of energy metabolism. NAD + was reported to induce autophagy in cancer cells [ ], which may contribute to the NAD + -induced decline in the viability of primary cultured neurons. These possibilities should be addressed in the future study.
Conclusions
In summary, NAD + replenishment exhibited neuroprotection against ischemia/reperfusion-induced neuronal injury both in vivo and in vitro. The combination of NAD + and NADPH provided greater neuroprotective effects in both cellular and animal models of ischemic stroke. NADPH could prolong the therapeutic window of NAD + , whereas NAD + could reduce the dosage of NADPH to produce the desirable therapeutic effects. The current study suggests that the combination of NAD + and NADPH may provide a novel effective therapy for ischemic stroke.
