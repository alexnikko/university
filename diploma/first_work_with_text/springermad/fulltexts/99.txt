Introduction
Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) by brief intermittent episodes of ischemia and reperfusion of the upper extremity protects the myocardium against ischemia-reperfusion injury. RIC involves both neuronal and humoral signaling cascades resulting in activation of myocardial intracellular protective pathways. Other indirect mechanisms such as modified endothelial and vasomotor function, and reduced inflammatory responses may contribute to myocardial protection from RIC.
RIC may also confer a direct effect on the coronary vasculature. In experimental studies, RIC led to an acute increase in coronary blood flow, and decreased coronary vascular resistance in a porcine model using coronary flow-probe assessment. Similarly, in a Doppler-echocardiographic study of the effect of RIC in normal volunteers, a transient increase in blood flow velocity in the left anterior descending coronary artery was observed during the first few minutes of the reperfusion phase after each cycle of upper limb ischemia. Finally, repetitive application of RIC has been demonstrated to increase echocardiography-derived coronary flow reserve in normal controls and patients with chronic heart failure. The effect of RIC in patients with stable ischemic coronary artery disease and normal cardiac function is not known, but modification of myocardial perfusion (MP) by RIC might be beneficial in terms of symptoms and disease progression. Thus, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of RIC on resting MP globally, and in non-ischemic and reversibly ischemic myocardial territories by quantitative MP imaging.
Methods
Study Design
Study recruitment material was sent to patients with a suspected diagnosis of stable ischemic coronary artery disease, who were referred for diagnostic cardiac 82 Rubidium positron emission tomography/computed tomography ( 82 Rb-PET/CT) imaging at the Department of Nuclear Medicine & PET Centre, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark. Criteria for exclusion were as follows: (I) patients with known type 2 diabetes mellitus, (II) patients in current dialysis treatment, (III) fertile women not using contraceptives, (IV) pregnant or nursing women, (V) strenuous exercise, or intake of beta-blocker medication or alcohol within 24 hours prior to examination, and (VI) other concomitant disease or treatment that according to the investigator’s assessment made the patient unsuitable for study participation. All patients abstained from theophylline medication for at least 24 hours, nitrate medication and caffeine intake for at least 12 hours, and fasted for at least 2 hours before 82 Rb-PET/CT examinations.
We conducted a prospective, outcome-assessor blinded study based on paired observations before and after RIC procedure. All patients underwent 82 Rb-PET/CT resting imaging before and immediately after the RIC procedure, and a subsequent adenosine 82 Rb-PET/CT stress-imaging at the end of protocol. RIC was conducted as four cycles of 5 minutes upper arm ischemia followed by 5 minutes of reperfusion using the commercially available automatic AutoRIC device (CellAegis Devices Inc., Toronto, ON, Canada). A sufficient resting period of minimum 30 minutes was ensured before initiation of the study protocol, and patients were kept resting in a supine position in a quiet room with an ambient steady room temperature throughout the study.
As a biomarker of biologic response to the RIC intervention, peripheral venous blood samples from the contralateral arm were drawn before and after RIC procedure in a consecutive subgroup of patients to evaluate change in circulating microRNA-144 plasma levels.
Myocardial Perfusion and Myocardial Vascular Resistance
Quantification of MP was achieved by 82 Rb-PET/CT imaging performed in a temperature-controlled room on a GE Discovery 690 PET/CT scanner (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK). Briefly, intravenous injection of 1110 MBq 82 Rubidium was directly followed by a 7-minute list mode scan of the heart. List mode data were subsequently rebinned into 27 dynamic frames (12 × 5, 6 × 10, 4 × 20, 4 × 40, and 1 × 60 seconds) and one static frame (2.5-7 minutes following initiation of the scan). Adenosine 82 Rb-PET/CT stress-imaging was conducted with a 6-minute continuous infusion of adenosine (0.14 mg/kg/min) starting 2 minutes prior to tracer injection. Heart rate and non-invasive arterial blood pressure were measured immediately before and after each 82 Rb-PET/CT scan and were calculated as mean.
MP data were analyzed using a single-tissue compartment model with an image derived input function obtained from a cluster analysis using the non-commercially available software Cardiac VUer (VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, Netherlands). Resting MP values were calculated from dynamic 82 Rb-PET/CT images and normalized for differences in rate pressure product (RPP) (heart rate multiplied by systolic arterial blood pressure) using an assumed population average value of 10,000 divided by the RPP. To evaluate the effect of RIC on MP when adjusting for myocardial oxygen consumption, we performed additional analysis on resting MP values normalized for differences in cardiac work (left ventricular stroke volume multiplied by mean arterial pressure multiplied by heart rate) using an assumed population average value of 500 divided by the cardiac work.
MP is expressed as mL/min/g and quantified as global MP and myocardial segmental MP based on The American Heart Association 17-segmental model. The apical segment was excluded from analysis to avoid risk of artifacts due to apical thinning. Myocardial flow reserve (MFR) was calculated as the ratio of hyperemic stress MP obtained from adenosine 82 Rb-PET/CT stress-imaging divided by baseline resting MP obtained from 82 Rb-PET/CT resting imaging. Myocardial vascular resistance (MVR) was calculated as mean arterial pressure divided by MP from 82 Rb-PET/CT resting imaging and expressed as mmHg/mL/min/g. Data for left ventricular stroke volume and ejection fraction were obtained from gated 82 Rb-PET/CT resting imaging data using the commercially available automatic program Quantitative PET (Cedar-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA).
Identification of Non-ischemic, Reversibly, and Irreversibly Ischemic Myocardial Segments
Identification of non-ischemic, reversibly, and irreversibly ischemic myocardial segments was performed in a semi-quantitative fashion using the commercial available software, Quantitative PET (Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA). Static and dynamic MP images were evaluated for perfusion defects in all myocardial segments using a 5-point scoring system based on the tracer uptake (0: normal, 1: slight reduction, 2: moderate reduction, 3: severe reduction, and 4: absent) on both the baseline 82 Rb-PET/CT resting scan and the adenosine 82 Rb-PET/CT stress scan. Assessment in case of suspected diffuse disease was assisted by the global absolute perfusion measurement. On a segmental level, a difference score (adenosine stress-imaging minus resting imaging) of ≥1 defined reversibly ischemic myocardial segments. A score of 0 on both scans defined non-ischemic myocardial segments, whereas a score of ≥1 on both scans defined irreversibly ischemic myocardial segments. Irreversibly ischemic myocardial segments were excluded from analysis.
For additional sensitivity analysis, we quantified coronary artery territory MP defined by a coronary artery 3-segmental model. For patients with a summed difference score of ≥4 on the 17-segmental model, we subjectively identified non-ischemic, reversibly ischemic, and irreversibly ischemic coronary artery territories based on static and dynamic MP images. All 82 Rb-PET/CT imaging data were analyzed, and myocardial segments and coronary artery territories scored, outcome-assessor blinded as consensus readings by two dedicated observers.
Blood Sampling and MicroRNA-144 Measurements
Peripheral venous blood from the contralateral arm was collected in K2-EDTA tubes (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and processed immediately for plasma preparation. Blood samples were centrifuged at 850× g for 20 minutes at 4 °C and the supernatant was collected and transferred to nuclease-free Cryotubes (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) and stored at −80 °C. Prior to analysis, plasma samples were centrifuged at 14,000× g for 15 minutes at 4 °C and the supernatant was collected. A miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was used to isolate total RNA from the plasma with cel-miR-39 MicroRNA assay (TaqMan®, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) as spike-in for normalization. MicroRNA-144 plasma levels were quantified using MicroRNA RT-PCR and hsa-miR-144 assay (TaqMan−, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Fold change of microRNA-144 plasma levels from RIC was calculated according to the Comparative threshold cycle (∆∆ C t ) method, as the ratio of microRNA-144 levels following RIC compared to baseline levels.
Statistical Analysis
STATA/SE V.13 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) was used for statistical analysis. Artworks were prepared using GraphPad PRISM V.6 (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA).
Paired and unpaired continuous variables were tested for normal distribution and equality and normality of distribution, or normal distribution and equality of variance prior to analysis. Logarithm transformation was performed when appropriate. Global MP and MVR, hemodynamic parameters, and microRNA-144 data were analyzed using paired Student’s t test. Myocardial segmental and coronary artery territory MP and MVR data were analyzed using linear normal model with a random effect to describe the repeated measurement on the same patient, for which the zero mean and equality of variance of both the error term and random effect term were checked prior to analysis. Association between an increase in circulating microRNA-144 plasma levels and change in global resting MP in response to RIC was analyzed using simple linear regression analysis, for which data were tested for variance of error, distribution of variance, and normal distribution of residuals prior to analysis.
Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation, geometric mean with 95% confidence interval (CI) or number with percentages, and with 95% CI when appropriate. For linear normal model and simple linear regression analysis, data are expressed as regression coefficient with 95% CI, and with r 2 -value when appropriate. Statistical significance was set as two-sided P value of <.05.
Test-retest investigation of MP using 82 Rb-PET/CT has revealed a coefficient of variation of approximately 20%, and RIC has been found to increase echocardiography-derived coronary blood flow velocity by 10-20% in healthy volunteers. Power calculations revealed that 45 patients were needed to detect a 10% change in resting global MP from RIC with a power of 90% and a significance level of 5%.

Forty-seven patients underwent successful adenosine 82 Rb-PET stress-imaging with valid data for a total of 751 myocardial segments. Of these, 682 myocardial segments were non-ischemic, 38 were reversibly ischemic, and 31 were irreversibly ischemic. 82 Rb-PET/CT imaging parameters for non-ischemic and reversibly ischemic myocardial segments are listed in Table 2 .

Effect of Remote Ischemic Conditioning on Hemodynamics, Myocardial Perfusion, and Myocardial Vascular Resistance
Compared to baseline, all patient hemodynamic variables during 82 Rb-PET/CT imaging were decreased following RIC (Table 3 ). Table 3 Hemodynamic parameters at baseline and following RIC Variable Baseline Following RIC 95% CI P value Heart rate (bpm) 68 ± 11 66 ± 11 −2.76 to −0.67 .002 Mean arterial pressure (mmHg) 95 ± 10 93 ± 10 −3.79 to −0.28 .02 RPP (bpm*mmHg) 9260 ± 2126 8821 ± 2070 −705 to −173 .002 Cardiac work (L*mmHg/min) 448 ± 132 414 ± 136 −55 to −14 .001 Data are mean ± standard deviation. P values are based on paired Student’s t test. RPP , rate pressure product; RIC , remote ischemic conditioning
We found no change in response to RIC on global resting MP normalized for RPP (1.23 ± 0.27 mL/min/g and 1.21 ± 0.25 mL/min/g following RIC; 95% CI −0.06 to 0.04, P = .64) or MVR (81 ± 21 mmHg/mL/min/g and 80 ± 19 mmHg/mL/min/g; 95% CI −5.44 to 2.85, P = .53). This was also evident when normalized for cardiac work (1.31 ± 0.42 mL/min/g and 1.35 ± 0.41 mL/min/g following RIC; 95% CI −0.03 to 0.10, P = .24, and 79 ± 25 mmHg/mL/min/g and 76 ± 25 mmHg/mL/min/g; 95% CI −7.88 to 1.19, P = .14).
Normalized for RPP, RIC did not affect resting MP or MVR in non-ischemic myocardial segments. In contrast, RIC decreased resting MP and increased MVR in reversibly ischemic myocardial segments, implying a 10% reduction in resting MP and 7% increase in MVR in response to RIC. However, when normalized for cardiac work, RIC did not affect resting MP or MVR in neither non-ischemic nor reversibly ischemic myocardial territories (Table 4 ).

We performed additional sensitivity analyses on resting MP normalized for RPP using a coronary artery 3-segment model. In this model, RIC did not affect resting MP (N = 124) (−0.01 mL/min/g decrease in MP following RIC; 95% CI −0.07 to 0.06, P = .87) or MVR (−1.6 mmHg/mL/min/g decrease in MVR following RIC; 95% CI −6.27 to 3.10, P = .51) in non-ischemic coronary artery territories. RIC decreased resting MP (n = 10) (−0.09 mL/min/g decrease in MP following RIC; 95% CI −0.21 to 0.03, P = .13), but the decrease was not statistically significant, and did not affect MVR (2.9 mmHg/mL/min/g increase in MVR following RIC; 95% CI −5.07 to 10.83, P = .48) in reversibly ischemic coronary artery territories. Similar results were observed when normalized for cardiac work (data not shown).
Effect of Remote Ischemic Conditioning on Circulating MicroRNA-144 Plasma Levels
MicroRNA-144 plasma levels at baseline and following RIC were available for a total of 19 patients. RIC increased circulating microRNA-144 plasma levels (1.35 (95% CI 1.10 to 1.65)-fold increase following RIC, P = .006), implying an estimated 35% increase in microRNA-144 in response to RIC. Change in circulating microRNA-144 plasma levels did not correlate with a change in resting global MP normalized for RPP in response to RIC (0.04 mL/min/g increase in MP per 1.0-fold increase in microRNA-144; 95% CI −0.06 to 0.15, r 2 = 0.04, P = .40).
Among the fourteen patients in which circulating microRNA-144 plasma levels increased in response to RIC, global resting MP normalized for RPP was not affected by RIC (1.15 ± 0.20 mL/min/g and 1.14 ± 0.21 mL/min/g following RIC; 95% CI −0.09 to 0.07, P = .73), and the increase in circulating microRNA-144 plasma levels did not correlate with a change in resting global MP in response to RIC (0.02 mL/min/g increase in MP per 1.0-fold increase in microRNA-144; 95% CI −0.12 to 0.16, r 2 = 0.01, P = .74).
Discussion
In the present study, we evaluated the immediate effect of RIC on MP using quantitative perfusion imaging technique. RIC did not affect resting MP or MVR globally or in non-ischemic myocardial territories. Normalized for RPP, RIC selectively diminished resting MP and increased MVR in myocardial territories with reversible ischemia. However, the subtle decrease was attenuated in sensitivity analyses using a 3-segment coronary artery model and absent when normalized for cardiac work, indicating that RIC did not substantially affect resting MP.
While prior animal data showing increased coronary blood flow measured by flow probe in response to RIC are compelling, the coronary vessels in young experimental animals may have different responses than older adult patients with coronary atherosclerosis and its associated treatments and comorbidities. This could explain the discrepant findings between our data and those obtained in young, healthy, volunteers, and is further supported by findings by Hoole et al. who demonstrated that RIC did not affect invasively assessed Doppler flow wire-derived coronary flow velocity in patients with stable coronary artery disease undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention. We extended these findings, because cellular 82 Rubidium uptake, as used for MP 82 Rb-PET/CT imaging, reflects the physiology of the epicardial and resistance coronary vasculature. Epicardial coronary flow velocity may only reflect coronary and microvascular function under the assumptions of steady cross-sectional area of the coronary artery and homogenous flow in the absence of shunting. Thus, we presume that MP imaging most reliably depicts the effect of RIC on the coronary epicardial and microcirculatory function.
In the present study, RIC decreased MP normalized for RRP in reversibly ischemic myocardial territories. However, the observed decline in MP following RIC in reversibly ischemic myocardial territories was not evident when normalizing MP for cardiac work. Myocardial oxygen consumption is an important determinant of MP, and cardiac work may be a more sensitive measure for myocardial oxygen consumption than RPP. Hence, our findings implicate that any reduction in MP was concurrent with a reduction in cardiac work, and that the connection between matching of blood flow and metabolic demand is preserved with RIC.
Local ischemic preconditioning has been found to slow myocardial energy metabolism during a sustained ischemic insult. In the present study, cardiac work was decreased following RIC. Because our paired study design did not allow random allocation to control or RIC, baseline MP was constantly quantified prior to MP following RIC, implying that an extended resting period may have decreased cardiac work. Consequently, the present study does not answer whether RIC per se decreases cardiac work and myocardial oxygen consumption but implicates that RIC does not confer an independent effect on MP in patients with suspected ischemic coronary artery disease.
Our data and findings by Hoole et al. indicate that a single application of a conventional RIC stimulus of four cycles of ischemia and reperfusion may not induce clinically relevant effects in patients with stable ischemic coronary artery disease in terms of enhancement of MP. However, the number of ischemia and reperfusion cycles may affect the biological response to RIC. When delivered twice daily for a week, RIC increased coronary flow reserve in both healthy volunteers and patients with ischemic and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Coronary blood flow velocity at rest was decreased by RIC in both study groups but most pronounced in patients with chronic heart failure, indicating that the improvement in coronary flow reserve was predominantly caused by reduction in resting coronary blood flow velocity. Future studies focusing on the potential effect of repetitive RIC application on MP are justified, because a potential modification of MP may be of clinical relevance.
Extending previous observations on the effect of RIC on coronary blood flow, , , , we documented that RIC induced a similar biologic response to that seen in normal volunteers, by elevating circulating microRNA-144 plasma levels. MicroRNA-144 has been found to be a circulating effector of RIC, and circulating microRNA-144 plasma levels may serve as a biomarker of the effectiveness of RIC. Our findings suggest that cardioprotection, as reflected by an increase in circulating microRNA-144 plasma levels, is not associated with an effect on resting MP in response to RIC. As we studied patients with stable coronary artery disease, we cannot determine whether coronary vascular responses and modulation of MP contribute to the cardioprotective effects of RIC in conditions characterized by acute ischemia-reperfusion injury.
Limitations
We chose a single-group study design to obtain paired observations before and after RIC. Because the study is not randomized or sham-controlled, we cannot exclude potential bias from non-RIC related effects. The study design served well as a proof of principle study.
A number of potentially eligible patients did not respond to our recruitment enquiry, which may have introduced a risk of selection bias. Even so, we successfully recruited a broad spectrum of patients with suspected stable ischemic heart disease. Only a small number of the included patients were diagnosed with significant ischemic coronary artery disease. Moreover, we chose a low threshold for detection of reversible ischemia. Consequently, our findings on reversibly ischemic myocardial segments should be interpreted with caution.
82 Rb-PET/CT imaging provides quantitative MP measurements with decent reproducibility and is a well-validated imaging modality for MP assessment, , although the tracer kinetic properties of 82 Rubidium are compromised at high MP rates. Importantly, by implementing correction for the non-linear extraction function of 82 Rubidium, 82 Rb-PET/CT imaging has been found to be highly concordant with 15 O-water-PET/CT, which is considered the gold standard for non-invasive MP assessment. Analyzing 82 Rb-PET/CT data using a myocardial 17-segmental model may introduce risk of observational errors due to the fundamental limitation in spatial resolution using PET/CT imaging techniques. Consequently, we performed sensitivity analyses using a coronary artery 3-segment model. We analyzed 82 Rb-PET/CT imaging data as consensus readings and with a paired observation study design, thus eliminating the risk of inter-observer and inter-patient variations.
We evaluated the effect of RIC on resting MP and not on hyperemic stress MP in response to adenosine, which could have added valuable knowledge on whether RIC may induce clinically relevant effect on MP in patients with stable ischemic coronary artery disease. However, adenosine is cardioprotective per se and presumed to be involved in cardioprotection from RIC independently of vascular function. Yet, transient hyperemic effect of adenosine during 82 Rb-PET/CT stress-imaging before and after RIC potentially modifies the effect of RIC on the coronary vasculature and MP.
Conclusion
RIC did not substantially affect resting MP globally or in non-ischemic and reversibly ischemic myocardial territories in patients with suspected ischemic coronary artery disease.
New Knowledge Gained
RIC may be beneficial in patients with stable coronary artery disease by modifying coronary blood flow. However, previous studies have been limited to evaluation of epicardial coronary blood flow using echocardiography, flow-probe, or flow-wire assessment. Extending previous findings, the present study indicates that a single application of a conventional RIC stimulus of four cycles of ischemia and reperfusion does not induce clinically relevant effects in terms of enhancement of myocardial perfusion in patients with suspected ischemic coronary artery disease.
