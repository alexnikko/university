Introduction
Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is the most common arrhythmia encountered within the first days after cardiac surgery [ ]. It can worsen the clinical outcome by aggravating postoperative cardiovascular complications, especially in patients with systolic heart failure (HF). For this reason, rhythm control therapy is an important treatment option, especially in hemodynamically unstable patients.
Antiarrhythmic drugs used for conversion of POAF are recommended with caution, if not at all, in HF patients due to the higher risk of ventricular proarrhythmia and deterioration of the already depressed left ventricular function. Although rhythm control therapy might prevent arrhythmia relapses and proarrhythmic remodeling that partially promotes establishment of AF late after surgery [ ], this therapeutic strategy may incorporate a greater thromboembolic risk compared to rate control interventions despite adequate anticoagulation.
Although amiodarone (AMIO) remains the mainstay therapy for POAF or nonsurgical atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with ischemic heart disease, the combination of AMIO with ranolazine (RAN) has been found to substantially improve its antiarrhythmic efficacy [ ]. In this context, recent clinical studies have shown that RAN added to AMIO led to faster conversion of AF than AMIO alone in patients without systolic HF [ , , ]. However, the efficacy and safety of the combination regimen in patients with POAF and systolic HF are uncertain. Thus, our aim was to examine whether treatment efficacy with AMIO or AMIO + RAN differs between patients with concomitant HF with reduced or preserved ejection fraction.
Methods
This is a prospective, randomized, allocation-concealed, single-blind, single-site clinical trial performed in the Larissa University Hospital between March 2012 and June 2017. This study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee and all patients provided written informed consent. All study participants were subjected to coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) using on-pump surgery. Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) was defined the AF that occurs 2–3 days following CABG. This study comprised patients exclusively undergoing coronary artery bypass.
Transthoracic echocardiography was performed preoperatively in all patients by an investigator blinded to the study protocol. Left atrial diameter (LAd) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) measurements were performed in all participants using conventional echocardiographic methods (M-mode and two-dimensional echocardiograms). Patients with LVEF < 40% were categorized to HFrEF group. Although no specific echocardiographic parameters were utilized for a stronger classification of patients with HFpEF, participants from this group had signs and/or symptoms of HF, no impaired systolic LV function (LVEF > 50%), and evidence of LV diastolic dysfunction. The latter was assessed by invasive hemodynamic measurements in the setting of preoperative coronary angiography.
Previous standard HF drug therapy and associated comorbidities were considered by all participants. Surgical intervention data, such as cross-clamping (CC) time and total cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time were measured in all patients during the operation. Blood pressure and ECG parameters, such as heart rate (HR), P-wave duration (PWD), QRS, and rate-corrected QT (QTc) interval using the Bazzet’s formula were assessed after conversion of POAF to sinus rhythm (SR).
Patients with previously documented persistent or permanent AF in the last 6 months prior to operation, and those receiving CYP3A inhibitors or inducers or having history of hepatic or renal failure were excluded.
At enrollment and after eligibility criteria were confirmed, patients in each group were randomly allocated on a 1:1 basis to receive either intravenous AMIO (loading dose of 300 mg in 30 min followed by 750 mg in 24 h, and if arrhythmia was sustained 375 mg in 12 h for a maximum of 36 h recording period), or the same AMIO dosage scheme combined with oral RAN 500 mg administered once at the time of randomization, followed by 375 mg 6 h later and subsequently 375 mg twice daily.
After conversion of arrhythmia to SR, AMIO infusion was discontinued in both groups and treatment with AMIO 200 mg t.i.d. was continued in the AMIO group; whereas, patients in the combination group were receiving AMIO 200 mg t.i.d. plus RAN 375 mg b.i.d. until hospital discharge. Patients were closely monitored, and rhythm strips or 12-Lead ECG were initially obtained every 4 h in the intensive care unit. Patients who did not convert to SR within the first 12 h of treatment were further monitored by Holter ECG (Custo Flash 200, Ottobrunn/Germany).
The primary endpoint of this study in both groups was the time to conversion of POAF to SR using AMIO or AMIO + RAN. Secondary endpoints were to examine differences in the efficacy of AMIO or AMIO+RAN by restoring SR in both HFrEF and HFpEF groups within 24 h and after 24 h of treatment (conversion rate), as well as sinus bradycardia (< 50 bpm), hypotension (< 100 mmHg), and ventricular proarrhythmic events as a result of pharmacologic interventions.
Anticoagulation and Beta-Blockade
Patients taking coumarin anticoagulants (asenocoumarol, warfarin) or other newer generation anticoagulants (fondaparinux, rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran, etc.) and antiplatelet therapy were switched to low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) 5 days prior to surgery and until the night before the operation. Beta-blockers were continued until the day of the surgery unless new-onset marked bradycardia or hypotension occurred.
Treatment with LMWH the day of surgery was dependant on the coagulation assays (ACT, platelets, PT, aPTT, fibrinogen, etc.). On the first postoperative day, all patients were given LMWH and acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg once daily, which continued during the AF and conversion to SR. In cases whereby conversion to SR did not occur within 36 h of antiarrhythmic therapy, the anticoagulation treatment was changed to acenocoumarol 4 mg (Sintrom) and was adjusted according to the international normalized ratio (INR). After hospital discharge, anticoagulant-antiplatelet regimens were left to the discretion of the outpatient treating cardiologist.
Statistical Evaluation
Statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism 5.01 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Continuous variables are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and were compared by unpaired t test (for between-group comparison) or one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni adjustments (for within-group comparison). We performed a prospective power analysis for our main variables of interest (time to conversion at 36 h, PWD). The calculation of the sample size was based on an expected large effect size (≥ 1.2) with an α of 0.05, β of 0.20, a power 0.80, and a two-tailed hypothesis. Categorical variables are given as absolute numbers and percentages and were compared by χ 2 test. The Kaplan-Meier log-rank test was used to compare cumulative progression curves of AF conversion to SR. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
A total of 812 consecutive patients with POAF eligible for pharmacologic conversion were enrolled; of these patients, 511 had HF with reduced EF and 301 HF with preserved EF. Participants in the two groups were randomly allocated to AMIO or AMIO + RAN treatment. All patients converted to SR during 36 h of treatment with either AMIO alone or the combination regimen AMIO + RAN. Preoperative demographic and clinical data, as well as conversion rate and time at 36-h study period with assessment of electrophysiologic parameters after SR restoration are summarized in Tables 1 and 2 .

The majority of patients in both groups received three coronary artery bypass grafts (CABGxIII). Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and cross-clamp (CC) time values did not significantly differ from each other. Most of the patients in the HFrEF group received standard HF therapy including beta-blockers, aldosterone antagonists, and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). These data were well balanced between the two groups.
Intergroup conversion rates of patients receiving AMIO alone or AMIO + RAN treatment did not significantly differ during the 24-h and 24–36-h study period. In particular, patients converted to SR during 24 h of AMIO-only treatment amounted to 15.3% in the HFpEF group vs. 14.5% in the HFrEF group. Most of the patients that received AMIO monotherapy converted after 24 h in both groups (84.7 vs. 85.5% in HFpEF vs. HFrEF group, respectively). In contrast, the vast majority of patients receiving the combination treatment restored SR much earlier than those exposed to monotherapy in both groups (100% in the HFpEF group vs. 91.8% in the HFrEF group).
On the other hand, median time to conversion of POAF to SR was markedly shorter in patients receiving AMIO + RAN than AMIO monotherapy within the same group, as well as between the two groups. More concretely, median of mean values of time to conversion in both the HFpEF and HFrEF group of patients indicated that the combination treatment of AMIO + RAN achieved faster conversion of POAF to SR than AMIO alone during 36 h of therapy (11.3 vs. 25.5 h, respectively). Interestingly, during the first 24 h of AMIO monotherapy, HFrEF patients reverted to SR earlier than those with HFpEF (Fig. 1 ). Also patients from the HFrEF group receiving AMIO + RAN converted to SR on average 1.8 h earlier than HFpEF patients. Fig. 1 Cumulative progression of conversion of POAF to SR in both groups treated with AMIO or AMIO plus RAN during 36 h of study period
P-wave duration (PWD), a marker of intra-atrial conduction time, was found to be significantly prolonged in patients receiving the combination treatment compared with those of AMIO-only regimen in both groups. QRS duration was statistically significantly increased after AMIO + RAN only in the HFrEF group; however, these values remained within normal limits. In addition, QTc intervals ranged within normal values despite statistically significant differences between the AMIO-monotherapy and AMIO + RAN treatment within the two groups. None of the patients showed a pathological value of these parameters after combining RAN with AMIO in both groups.
Most of the participants remained hemodynamically stable manifesting no hypotension or bradycardia during therapy with AMIO + RAN, even in patients with reduced systolic LV function. The addition of RAN was safe and well tolerated at the doses used in our study; it significantly enhanced effectiveness of AMIO in accelerating termination of AF without exerting proarrhythmic effects.
Discussion
This study showed that AMIO + RAN resulted in faster termination of POAF than AMIO alone in all patients, irrespective of left ventricular dysfunction and left atrial size. However, patients with HFrEF tended to restore SR earlier than those with HFpEF after AMIO + RAN or AMIO alone. In contrast, conversion rates during 24-h and 24–36-h study periods were similar in both groups independently from the treatment they received.
Faster pharmacological conversion of POAF in patients with HFrEF and dilated LA with RAN could partially be explained by experimental findings of Burashnikov et al. [ ] who demonstrated increased suppression of INa after RAN in atrial cells isolated from failing vs. normal hearts. This may prolong atrial postrepolarization refractoriness and block slow conduction, thereby terminating reentry by increasing its cycle length or interrupting its propagation to the myocardium. Seemingly, the causing mechanisms and the duration of arrhythmia might be more important than the size of LA for its conversion to SR. For example, there are many cases of persistent AF in patients with normal-sized LA which are very difficult to terminate when they run for longer periods.
We recently reported in a pilot study that adding RAN to AMIO facilitated earlier conversion of POAF in patients with preserved EF and normal left atrium [ ]. This clinical investigation included a greater number of patients and extended the study’s question to compare patients with preserved EF to those with congestive HF. The present results affirm findings of the pilot investigation by showing the superiority of the combination treatment over AMIO alone in HFpEF patients with POAF. In addition, patients with ischemic heart disease and preserved EF who were admitted with recent-onset paroxysmal AF reverted much earlier to SR by the combination therapy [ , , ]. These data suggest that the addition of oral RAN to standard AMIO regimen substantially shortens the time to conversion of recent-onset nonsurgical AF.
RAN is an anti-anginal drug blocking the late Na + current in atria and ventricles at clinically therapeutic doses. Moreover, it is an open-state atrial selective peak Na + channel inhibitor with rapid unbinding kinetics during electrical diastole and strong use-dependent activity [ , , ]. These electrophysiologic properties are responsible for its ability to slow conduction and increase postrepolarization refractoriness only in atrial myocardium, two powerful features underlying its antiarrhythmic activity.
Since RAN reaches peak plasma levels within approximately 5 h after oral administration, we hypothesize that the shorter time to conversion of AF was very likely due to RAN. In this study, a cumulative dose of 875 mg RAN given during the first 6 h in addition to AMIO resulted in faster conversion of arrhythmia compared to AMIO-only treatment. This dosage of RAN plus AMIO was good tolerated by all participants. Some Ic class antiarrhythmics that block atrial peak Na + channels, exert slower unbinding kinetics, thereby depressing also ventricular conduction [ ]. Such drugs are contraindicated in patients with ischemic heart disease due to a higher incidence of ventricular proarrhythmia.
Studies in animals have shown that acute administration of AMIO suppresses atrial selective peak Na + channels [ ], albeit much less than RAN. However, the effect of this Na + channel blockade is not observed by means of 12-Lead ECG recordings in clinical practice. The only significant effect of short-term AMIO administered during AF was a reduction in the ventricular response rate. AMIO displays its class III antiarrhythmic activity only after chronic administration [ ]. Furthermore, AMIO’s antiarrhythmic efficacy is restricted at rapid heart rates, in contrast to RAN. These actions of AMIO may justify its combination with RAN to enhance antiarrhythmic effectiveness. In this line, Burashnikov et al. showed that the combination of dronedarone and RAN induced potent suppression of AF in dog heart [ ]. They attributed it to a synergistic effect of these drugs on atrial-selective peak Na + channel inhibition, resulting in slow conduction and considerable increase of postrepolarization refractoriness.
Although the exact mechanism of POAF days after cardiac bypass surgery still remains unclear, myocardial ischemia and reperfusion during the surgical procedure might suggest a Ca ++ dependent triggered activity mechanism without however excluding reentry. Independent of the prevailing mechanism involved, drugs that ameliorate Ca ++ overload, block delayed conduction, and prolong postrepolarization refractoriness may be highly antiarrhythmic. When administered during AF, RAN possibly acts via these mechanisms to suppress perpetuation of reentrant excitation or multifocal ectopic automaticity. Accordingly, experiments using multisite mapping techniques have shown that RAN blocked regions of slow conduction and terminated atrial flutter or fibrillation in a sterile pericarditis canine model [ ].
Augmented intracellular Ca++ due to increased late Na + found in myocardial ischemia and reperfusion as well as in ischemic HF might induce triggered activity arrhythmias including AF [ , , ]. This may partially explain the enhanced effectiveness of the late Na + current blocker RAN when combined with AMIO for termination of POAF. Based possibly on the same mechanisms, the efficacy of RAN in preventing POAF has been outlined in a number of previous clinical studies and reviews [ , , , ]. Accordingly, Tagarakis et al. [ ] showed a significantly lower incidence of POAF after adding RAN to standard therapy (375 mg × 2 for 3 days preoperatively), confirming findings of Miles et al. who observed that 1.5 g RAN was better than AMIO in protecting POAF after coronary artery bypass grafting [ ]. Similarly, Hammond et al. demonstrated that 1 g RAN was associated with a significant decrease of POAF in patients undergoing coronary bypass and/or valvular surgeries [ ].
A number of limitations should be considered regarding data interpretation. Preoperative ECG variables were not evaluated, and thus, comparisons were carried out only postoperatively between AMIO and AMIO + RAN receiving patients. In addition, this trial did not include a RAN-only treatment group; however, this allowed the inclusion and examination of a greater number of patients with HFpEF compared with our earlier pilot study [ ]. Furthermore, we used only a single dose of RAN that was lower than the one previously reported by other investigators [ , ]. Lower RAN dosage was chosen to limit serious adverse effects in post-cardiac surgery patients, especially in those with compromised left ventricular dysfunction. Another potential limitation is sourced from the older guidelines used to enroll patients into the reduced or preserved EF HF group. This led to a EF gap between 40 and 50% at which a number of the patients were characterized as having reduced, borderline, or preserved EF HF. The latter could consist a subgroup of participants that limited, at least in part, our results to give a precise information about this subgroup of HF patients.
Our study shows that the antiarrhythmic effects of RAN are not limited to patients with HFpEF and POAF. In contrast, RAN added to AMIO induced even earlier SR restoration in patients with reduced EF than in those with preserved EF. Given the limited pharmacological treatment options for termination of POAF in patients with systolic HF, the combination of AMIO + RAN seems promising at improving time to conversion when compared with AMIO alone, by maintaining safety in these patients with increased risk of proarrhythmia and hemodynamic instability.
