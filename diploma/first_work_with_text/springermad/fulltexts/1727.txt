Introduction
Patients with cerebellar ataxia (CA) show an extremely irregular, unstable, and variable gait with a high risk of falls [ ]. To compensate for this walking instability, they adopt an adaptive strategy characterized by increasing step width to increase the safety margin by moving the center of mass (CoM) from the edge of the feet [ ]. This widened base of support is the most well-known clinical feature of ataxia [ ], but it has also been described in elderly individuals [ , ] and patients with many other gait disorders stemming from both neurological and orthopedic diseases [ , , , , , , ]. These evidences suggest that widening the base of support is commonly adopted by subjects with unstable gait. In addition, patients with ataxia widen their base of support at an early stage and at its maximum, and no further increases are seen during disease progression [ ], suggesting that further increases in step width may be not practical for gait speed maintenance and energy consumption [ , ]. Thus, enlarging the base of support may not be limited only to compensate for imbalances on the frontal plane but may also represent an important global strategy to increase stability and gait efficacy and reduce energy consumption. In addition to a widened base of support, other abnormalities have been revealed in ataxic gait, including a shortened step length; decreased gait speed and ankle joint range of motion (ROM) and increased gait variability, trunk oscillations, and ankle muscle co-activation [ , , , , , , , , ]. These abnormalities reflect primary deficits linked to cerebellar degeneration and balance-related compensatory mechanisms. The functional relationship between the widened base of support and the other gait abnormalities in ataxic gait has been not explored to date. To obtain information about the effect of increasing the base of support on several gait variables in ataxic patients, here we investigated the opposite behavior: patients were required to walk using a step width similar to that of healthy controls. In other words, the main question we wanted to answer here was: What happens if patients with ataxia walk without modifying their base of support? Our main hypothesis was that reducing the base of support would worsen several gait parameters including upper- and lower-body kinematics and energy recovery and expenditure.
Materials and Methods
Subjects
Patients with primary degenerative ataxia were consecutively recruited from September 2016 to May 2017 from the Neurological Rehabilitation Unit of Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences and Biotechnologies of the University of Rome, Sapienza, Latina. Two-expertise neurologists (MS and CC) clinically assessed all the participants. Thirteen out of 40 patients (10 men, three women; mean age, 50.2 ± 9.5 years) were included for this study. Eight were diagnosed with autosomal dominant ataxia (spinocerebellar ataxia [SCA], SCA1, SCA2, SCA3) and five with sporadic adult-onset ataxia of unknown etiology (SAOA). All the participants were in a relatively early disease stage as demonstrated by their low International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS scores; Table 1 ). All patients were able to walk without assistance or walking aids on a level surface and perform the required task. Because patients with SCA may show signs other than cerebellar ones, we only included those who exhibited gait disturbances that were exclusively cerebellar in nature at the initial evaluation. Higher ICARS values corresponded to more severe disease. All patients underwent a complete neurological assessment that included the following: (1) cognitive evaluation using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scale; (2) cranial nerve evaluation; (3) muscle tone evaluation; (4) muscle strength evaluation; (5) joint coordination evaluation; (6) sensory examination; (7) tendon reflex elicitation; and (8) disease severity measured by ICARS [ ]. Any patients with major involvement of neurological systems other than the cerebellar system and/or orthopedic disorders that could induce gait impairment were excluded. In particular, patients with spasticity, polyneuropathy, cognitive deficit, and relevant extrapyramidal signs as evaluated using clinical and instrumental findings were excluded. No patient displayed clinical features of spasticity, strength deficit, sensory deficit, and/or cognitive impairment (MMSE > 24). No patient exhibited uncorrected visual deficits assessed by the Snellen visual acuity test. Although none had a visual impairment, almost all had oculomotor abnormalities such as gaze nystagmus or square-wave jerks during pursuit movement. All of the patients exhibited cerebellar atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging and all were able to walk alone without an aid. All of the participants received physical therapy that included upper- and lower-limb exercises as well as balance and gait training.

Thirteen healthy sex- and age-matched adults (age: ataxic patients, 50.2 ± 9.5 years; healthy controls, 47.7 ± 10.2 years; p > 0.05) were considered the control group. All participants were required to provide informed consent before participating in the study, which complied with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the local ethics committee.
Kinematic Recordings
An optoelectronic motion analysis system (SMART-DX 500 System, BTS, Milan, Italy) consisting of eight infrared cameras (with a 300-Hz sampling rate) was used to detect the movements of spherical markers (15-mm diameter and covered with a reflective aluminum powder material). The system detected the motion of 37 passive spherical markers: 19 for the lower body (17 plus two heels markers, used only during a static offset measurement) and 18 for the upper body according to the validated biomechanical and international recommendations [ , , ].
Surface Electromyography Recordings
Bipolar Ag/AgCl surface electrodes (H124SG, Kendall ARBO, Donau, Germany), after skin preparation with electroconductive gel, were placed over the muscle belly in the direction of the muscle fibers according to the European Recommendations for Surface Electromyography [ ] and the atlas of muscle innervation zones [ ].
The bipolar electrodes were placed bilaterally on the vastus lateralis (VL), biceps femoris (BF), tibialis anterior (TA), and gastrocnemius medialis (GM) muscles.
Finally, the surface myoelectric signals were acquired at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz using 16-channel Wi-Fi transmission surface electromyography (EMG; FreeEMG300 System, BTS). Pre-processing filtering and denoising were performed. The lower and upper cut-off frequencies of the Hamming filter were 10 and 400 Hz, respectively, and the common mode rejection ratio was 100 dB.
Procedure
Before the formal measurements were started, practice sessions were performed to familiarize the participants with the procedure. First, healthy subjects were recorded at different gait speeds, self-selected, slow, and very slow along a walkway approximately 10 m long. Second, patients’s gait was then recorded in two different walking sessions in two separate days (the gap was about 1 week). In the first session ( unperturbed walking, npw ), patients were required to walk normally barefoot at self-selected speed along a walkway approximately 10 m long. In the second session ( perturbed walking, pw) , patients were asked to walk within a small area delimited by two white lines (Fig. 1 ) placed on the ground, the distance between which corresponded to the mean step width of the healthy controls at matched gait speed (see below in the data analysis section). Fig. 1 Experimental set-up. Unperturbed walking (left side) and perturbed walking (right side) paths. The perturbed path was delimited by two white lines placed on the ground according to the healthy controls mean step width
Six walking trials were acquired for each session in each subject.
To avoid fatigue, in each group and for each session, the trials were separated by a 1-min rest. For each participant, we rejected the first walking trial and considered the remaining five. To ensure that gait parameters were collected during steady-state walking, the first and last two steps of each trial, corresponding to the acceleration and deceleration phase, were excluded from the analysis.
Data Analysis
Three-dimensional marker trajectories were acquired using a frame-by-frame capture software (Smart Capture, BTS), and three-dimensional marker trajectories were reconstructed using Smart Tracker software (BTS). Finally, the data were processed using SMART Analyzer software (BTS) and Matlab software (Matlab R2014a, version 8.3, MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA).
Step Width and Gait Speed Matching
Assuming that speed was slower in patients, to avoid a potential velocity bias, the gait speed was matched between groups as follows: for the control group, we considered only those trials in which the gait speed value fell within the range identified by the ataxic patients’ mean gait speed ± SD in the npw [ , , , , ].
At this matched speed, we then measured the mean step width of healthy controls and fixed the walkway path for the perturbed walking session ( pw ) of the ataxic patients (Fig. 1 ). Afterward we measured the gait speed of the CA pw and consequently chose, in the healthy group, only those trials for which both gait speed and step width values fell within the range identified by the ataxic patients’ mean ± SD in the pw . Accordingly, patients with ataxia were speed matched in the npw and both speed and step width matched in the pw with healthy controls, HC-1 and HC-2, respectively.
Time-Distance Parameters
The following time-distance parameters were measured: stance phase duration (%), swing phase duration (%), first double support phase duration (DBS I, %), second double support phase duration (DBS II, %), cadence (step/min), step length (%, normalized to leg length), step width (cm), mean speed (m/s), and mean speed of the swing phase (m/s).
Center of Mass Measurements
We calculated the instantaneous behavior of the CoM as centroid of the 15-segment model (head, thorax, three-segment arms, pelvis, and three-segment legs) [ ].
Lower-Limb Joint Kinematics
To assess the lower-limb joint kinematics, we ascertained the hip, knee, and ankle joint centers of rotation and calculated the following angular ROM in the sagittal plane during the gait cycle: (i) hip flexion/extension; (ii) knee flexion/extension; and (iii) ankle dorsi-plantar flexion.
Upper-Body Joint Kinematics
To measure the ROM of the trunk in the sagittal and frontal planes, we used the trajectories of the trunk calculated as the mid-point between the shoulder markers (S, shoulder level) and the centroid of the iliac spines (P, pelvis level) [ ]. The S and P trajectories were reconstructed considering an inertial reference system with the vertical (V) axis aligned with the gravity vector, the anteroposterior (AP) axis aligned with the vector representing the subject’s mean line of gait progression, and the mediolateral (ML) axis computed as the cross product of the AP and V axes. The trajectories of the trunk and pelvis were projected on both sagittal and frontal planes. The trunk function (f Trunk ) was then calculated as the difference between these trajectories in each plane. Data were normalized to subjects’ height and thus expressed as percentages.
Muscle Antagonist Co-activity Index
The acquired raw EMG signals were processed by subtracting their average value; the raw EMG signals were then full-wave rectified and filtered with a zero-lag fourth-order Butterworth with a low pass filter cut-off of 10 Hz. Signals were time normalized to 100 samples with respect to gait cycle duration. For each subject, the EMG signal of every muscle was normalized according to the highest value obtained from all trials [ , ].
The co-activation (CA) curves from the VL-BF and TA-GM were determined using the following formula [ , ]: $$ CA=\left[\frac{\left({a}_{Hi}+{a}_{Li}\right)}{2}\right]\cdot \left(\frac{a_{Li}}{a_{Hi}}\right)\kern0.5em \forall i\in \left(0,100\right) $$ where a Hi and a Li represent, at sample i , the highest and lowest activity values between the two antagonist muscles.
The Antagonist Co-Activity Index (CAI) for the following four phases of the gait cycle was then obtained by calculating the mean values of the co-activity level in the corresponding cycle windows: first double support (DBS I), single support (SS), second double support (DBS II), and swing (SW). Data from the five trials were averaged to obtain each subject’s mean value.
Energy Consumption Measurements
In this study, we measured the mechanical behavior of the body in terms of energy recovery and energy consumption in relation to the CoM.
The CoM was calculated using the masses of the segments and the relative CoM coordinates.
For the above-mentioned calculation, the CoM in the x direction (with similar equations for the y and z directions) can be measured as the centroid of n segments using the following formula [ ]: $$ {CoM}_x=\frac{1}{M}\sum \limits_{i=1}^n{x}_i\cdot {m}_i; $$ where M is the body mass, m i represents the mass of the i- th body segment, and x i is the position of the COM of the i- th body segment.
Energy recovery was calculated considering the R-step, which represents the fraction of mechanical energy recovered by the pendular transduction of potential energy to kinetic energy and vice versa, during each walking step [ , ]. The R-step can vary between 0 and 100% (the worst and the ideal mechanical energetic behavior, respectively).
The R-step was calculated using the following formula: $$ \mathrm{R}\hbox{-} \mathrm{step}=\frac{W_{\mathrm{v}}^{+}+{W}_{\mathrm{f}}^{+}-{W}_{\mathrm{ext}}^{+}}{W_{\mathrm{v}}^{+}+{W}_{\mathrm{f}}^{+}}\cdot 100 $$ where W v + represents the vertical positive work, calculated as sum of the positive increments over one step, produced by the gravitational potential energy, W f + represents the forward positive work, produced by the kinetic energy of forward motion, and W ext + represents the external positive work, produced by the total mechanical energy (expressed in joule·meter −1 ).
We also calculated the total mechanical energy expenditure (TEE), which represents an index of the total mechanical energy expenditure aimed at moving a subject’s body during walking. Higher values are indicative of greater energy expenditure.
The TEE was calculated as follows: $$ TEE=\frac{W_{ext}^{+}}{0.25}+\frac{W_{ext}^{-}}{1.20} $$ where W + ext represents the external positive work and W − ext represents the negative work, and each is divided by their respective efficiencies [ , , , , , ].
However, given the cyclic nature of walking, the positive work done at each step is equal to the negative work, so that: $$ TEE=\frac{W_{ext}^{+}}{0.21} $$
Ultimately, TEE was normalized to body weight and step length (TEE was expressed in kcal·km −1 ·kg −1 ).
Coefficients of Variation
To obtain an index of intra-subject variability, we calculated the coefficient of variation (CV) as the ratio between the standard deviation and the mean values of the following parameters: step length, step width, cadence, mean speed, mean speed of the swing phase, trunk ROM, stance phase duration, swing phase duration, and DBS I and DBS II phase percentage durations.
The variability of the flexion–extension of the right and left hips, knees, and ankles was calculated according to a previously reported method [ , ] as follows: $$ {CV}_{joint}={\left\langle SD(i)\right\rangle}_i,i\in \left(1,100\right) $$ where SD(i) is the standard deviation of a measure at i th % gait cycle, and 〈 〉 i indicates the average overall i .
Results
Statistical Analysis
All the analyses were performed using SPSS 20.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to verify whether the data were normally distributed. One-way analysis of variance was used to compare the anthropometric characteristic and demographic data between the two groups. No significant differences were detected.
We used the unpaired t test to compare the spatio-temporal, lower-limb kinematic, and energy expenditure parameters between patients during the npw task and the controls (HC-1 group) as well as between patients during the pw task and the controls (HC-2 group).
We used the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test, to compare trunk ROM, CAI index parameters, and CV between patients during the npw task and the controls (HC-1 group) as well as between patients during the pw task and the controls (HC-2 group).
Regarding the intragroup analysis, we used the paired t test to compare the spatio-temporal, lower-limb kinematic, and energy expenditure parameters for patients during the npw and pw tasks as well as the healthy controls at different gait speeds (HC-1 and HC-2).
Finally, we used the non-parametric Wilcoxon test to compare the trunk ROM, CAI index, and CV parameters for patients during the npw and pw tasks as well as the healthy controls at different gait speeds (HC-1 and HC-2).
Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Discussion
Wide-base walking is commonly recognized as one of the most prominent gait features in ataxia [ , , ] since it represents a fundamental mechanism to increase dynamic stability [ , , , , , , , , ]. To gather information about the effects of the increased base of support on several gait variables in ataxic patients, we investigated the opposite behavior by requiring patients to narrow their base of support.
First, narrowing the base of support is a challenging perturbation for patients with CA since it further stresses their ability to coordinate muscle activity at multiple joint levels in order to maintain balance. The worsening motor control and balance induced by the perturbed condition seems well reflected by the increased gait variability of all gait variables as well as the increased trunk oscillations in the CA pw than in both the CA npw and the healthy controls (Fig. 2 ). Gait variability is one of the most characterizing features of gait ataxia [ , ] and reflects the inability of ataxic patients to maintain dynamic balance using a regular walking pattern. Thus, the ataxic gait is more unstable and irregular, while the gait pattern is less repeatable, ultimately leading to an increased risk of falls [ , ]. Thus, patients with CA gain stability and walk more safely by enlarging their base of support.
Narrowing the base of support also further increases the upper-body oscillations. Patients with CA show abnormal control of the upper-body segment, which is likely due to poor intersegmental coordination, with increased trunk movements leading to a lack of local stability [ , ]. Furthermore, the upper-body oscillations affect gait performance [ ] and stability [ ] in a sort of vicious circle that transforms the upper body into a generator of perturbations. In particular, we found that, by narrowing the base of support, patients with CA show a further increase in lateral trunk bending, suggesting that one of the reasons they enlarge the base of support is to compensate for the instability induced by trunk bending. A similar degree of trunk instability was observed in healthy subjects while walking on a slippery walkway or on a narrow beam [ , ].
Second, the worsened motor control observed during the perturbed condition leads patients with CA to reinforce their other compensatory mechanisms to compensate for the increased unbalance including, for instance, walking more cautiously, at slower speed, and increasing the double support duration.
When analyzing joint kinematics, we found significantly reduced hip and knee ROM values during the perturbed condition versus no differences in ankle joint ROM (Fig. 5 ). On the one hand, the reduced ROM may be due to the reduced gait speed; on the other hand, it may be due to the individual’s attempt to increase joint stiffness [ , , ]. However, since no significant increase in knee joint antagonist muscle co-activation was found (Fig. 4 ), the slow gait speed seems to be the main reason for the reduced hip and knee ROM. In this, as well as in our previous studies on both stationary and non-stationary locomotor tasks [ , , , , , ], the ankle joint ROM in patients with CA was always markedly reduced compared to controls, whereas ankle joint antagonist muscle co-activation was markedly increased, indicating that the ankle joint plays a key role in stabilizing the body (ankle strategy). The lack of significant differences in ankle ROM between perturbed and unperturbed walking may be simply because the ankle joint ROM is maximally reduced even in the unperturbed condition. The further increase in the ankle muscle co-activation reinforces, in the pw compared to the npw , the notion that the main balance-related effort is achieved at the ankle joint level by the ankle joint muscles to control body sway during walking (Fig. 6 ). Fig. 5 Mean and SD of the ankle, knee and hip joints angular excursion on the sagittal plane, during both npw and pw , in patients with CA during both npw (light gray curves) and pw (black curves) sessions and the corresponding healthy controls, HC-1 (gray curves) and HC-2 group (dark gray curves). Data are normalized to stride duration and reduced to 100 samples Fig. 6 Co-activation curves of the ankle (TA-GAM) and knee (VL-BF) joint antagonist muscles during the gait cycle, during both npw and pw , in patients with CA during both npw (light gray curves) and pw (black curves) sessions and the corresponding healthy controls, HC-1 (gray curves) and HC-2 group (dark gray curves)
Third, as result of the increased instability and increased compensatory adaptations induced by the perturbed walking, patients with CA increase the total energy expenditure compared to controls and are unable to recover the mechanical energy compared to the npw condition (Fig. 4 ). As such, the walking performance of the patients with CA is reduced with further reductions in gait speed, step length, and cadence.
After analyzing the biomechanical consequences of reducing the base of support in ataxic patients, we can speculate about the specific advantage of enlarging the base of support during the disease course. In this view, the widened base of support not only represents a compensatory mechanism applied on the frontal plane, it may allow patients with CA to reduce the gait instability (e.g., gait variability and trunk oscillations), avoid increasing other compensatory mechanisms (e.g., by increasing the double support duration and ankle joint antagonist muscle co-activation), reduce energy expenditure, and increase energy recovery; at the same time, they can maintain good gait performance (e.g. gait speed and hip and knee joint ROM). Enlarging the base of support may be considered a global common strategy employed by both healthy subjects and patients in different instability conditions.
Training the step width would be a very challenging aspect in the neurorehabilitation of patients with CA. Increased step width has been also observed during unstable locomotion tasks, including turning and stopping [ , , ]. Interestingly, in a recent paper, it has been found that patients with CA do not relevantly further widen their base of support after 4-year follow-up evaluations [ ]. This suggests that patients with CA adopt this balance-related mechanism both at the early stages and at its maximum value and, that a further increase in step width may be not efficient in terms of gait speed maintenance and energy consumption.
Taken into account altogether these evidences, we can speculate that a rehabilitation program based on training patients’ gait at different degrees of step width, during different locomotion tasks, and in a progressive way, may improve their ability to modulate the step width and thus the dynamic stability.
Conclusions
Our findings also suggest the importance of focusing the rehabilitation programs of patients with CA on step width training to have greater effects on balance performance during walking. Thus, exercises that focus on training patients at different degrees of step width in different stability conditions could be included in such rehabilitative programs.
