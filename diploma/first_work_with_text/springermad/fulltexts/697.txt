Introduction
Stem cell therapy is being investigated as a possible treatment to limit myocardial damage, and stem cells from human embryos or adult human bone marrow have been transplanted into hearts, and have produced beneficial results in animal models of ischemic heart disease and in patients with coronary artery disease [ , , ]. As one of stem cell sources, human umbilical cord blood (UCB) exhibits many advantages including immediate availability, high proliferative capacity, and a low incidence of severe graft versus host disease (GVHD) in recipients, without ethical limitation, and less stringent criteria for HLA matching for donor-recipient selection, etc. [ , , , , , ]. Recently, human umbilical cord stem cells have been proved to be effective in limiting the size of myocardial infarction and preserving left ventricular function in animals with acute myocardial infarction [ , ]. In addition, human umbilical cord stem cells decrease fibrosis and increase cardiac function in cardiomyopathy [ ]. However, due to ischemia, inflammation or anoikis, the stem cells couldn’t survive in the myocardium for a long term. The short-term engraftment and survival of stem cells in injured and infarcted myocardium has been the main problem faced by all stem cell trials [ , ]. Besides, the number and percentage of stem cells also determined the curative effect, and red blood cell contamination could significantly decrease the migration ability and the efficacy of stem cells, sometimes even causing embolism [ ]. Because of the scarcity of stem cells in each unit, the transplant success rate of human UCB stem cells remains much poorer than peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) or bone marrow stem cell sources, thus agents that can facilitate human UCB stem cells are highly desirable [ ]. Recognizing the limitations of human UCB stem cells as an alternative treatment for acute myocardial infarction, we have investigated the methods to enhance expansion of human UCB stem cells and to improve survival of human UCB stem cells in the myocardium.
The cytokine thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor is expressed in pluripotent stem cells [ ], and recombinant human TPO (rhTPO) has provided promises in promoting stem cell proliferation, but the development of rhTPO has been suspended because of severe side effects [ ]. The small molecular TPO receptor agonists were designed to activate the TPO receptor and avoid producing an immune response that would cross-react with native TPO [ , ], and eltrombopag (Promacta) had been approved by the FDA for the treatment of thrombocytopenia [ ]. Recently, eltrombopag has been reported to significantly enhance the expansion of human UCB stem cells [ ]. In addition, the prolonged survival time of human UCB stem cells also was observed after cessation of eltrombopag treatment [ ]. Besides, other studies also demonstrated that non-peptide small molecular TPO receptor agonist enhanced the expansion and differentiation of human peripheral blood CD34 + cells [ ]. All evidence suggested that non-peptide small molecular TPO receptor agonists might be used to improve the curative effect on acute myocardial infarction by expanding human UCB stem cells or improving survival of stem cells.
Hetrombopag, a selective, non-peptide small molecular TPO receptor agonist, was developed by Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine Co., Ltd. Although currently in phase 2 clinical trials, only a few reports on hetrombopag have been published. In this context, we aimed to study the potential of hetrombopag to enhance human UCB stem cells ex vivo expansion and prevent cardiac myocyte survival following the oxidative stress as an enhancer of stem cells.
Materials and Methods
All studies were reviewed and approved by the Medical Ethics Committee Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, and were carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

Cytokines including rhTPO (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), recombinant murine interleukin-3 (rm IL-3) (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), recombinant human flt-3 ligand (rhFL) (Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA) and recombinant human colony-stimulating factor (rhCSF) (Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA) were obtained as indicated.
Rat Cardiac Myocytes Culture
Rat cardiac myocytes H9C2 were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA), and were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) with 5 % fetal bovine serum (Fisher Scientific, Ottawa, ON) and penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen) and grown to approximately 80 % confluence in T25 polyethylene tissue culture flasks (BD Bioscience).
RAW264.7 Cell Culture
RAW264.7 cells, a murine macrophage-like cell line, were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). Cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum (Fisher Scientific, Ottawa, ON) and penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen). All experiments were performed with cells grown to approximately 90 % confluence.
Ex Vivo Expansion of Human UCB CD34+ Cells
Human UCB CD34 + cells with more than 90 % purity (Stem cells) (Lonza Walkersville, Walkersville, MD, USA) were plated at 5 × 10 4 cells/mL in HPGM serum-free media (Lonza) supplemented with rhSCF (25 ng/mL) and rhFL (50 ng/ml) plus hetrombopag, eltrombopag, rhTPO or the combination of hetrombopag and rhTPO at the indicated concentrations, and cultured for 7 days at 37 °C in a humidified 5 % CO 2 environment. On the fourth day, the culture was diluted 1:1 with fresh medium containing the cytokines. The cells were harvested on the 7th day. The viable cells were distinguished by Trypan blue and counted using a hemacytometer (Hausser Scientific, Horsham, PA). The percentage and number of cell subsets was determined by flow cytometry.
H2O2-Induced Damage of Rat Cardiac Myocytes and Human UCB MNCs
Ex vivo expanded human UCB MNCs containing approximately 17 % hematopoietic CD34 + stem cells, 16 % CD34 + CD38 − cells, 12 % CD34 + CD33 + cells, 14 % CD41 + cells and 9 % CD133 + were used in the following experiments. Rat cardiac myocytes, human UCB MNCs alone, or cardiac myocytes plus human UCB MNCs in culture were serum starved for 24 h, and were then subjected to H 2 O 2 , hetrombopag or both for 12 h at the indicated concentrations. In each of the human UCB MNCs experiments, 4 × 10 6 human UCB MNCs were placed in a 12 mm polycarbonate Millicell Transwell Culture Insert (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Each transwell insert was permeable to human UCB MNCs paracrine factors but not to human UCB MNCs. Each insert was placed in culture flasks with DMEM plus H 2 O 2 or in culture flasks with cardiac myocytes plus H 2 O 2 and DMEM. Cell viability assays, protein microarrays and western blots were then performed on each group.
Anti-Inflammatory Effects of Hetrombopag in LPS-Stimulated RAW264.7 Cells
Quantification of nitrite: RAW264.7 cells (1 × 10 5 cells/well) were preincubated at 37 °C for 3 h with or without various concentrations of hetrombopag. After pre-incubation, LPS (10 μg/mL) was added, and cells were incubated for 20 h. After incubation, 100 μL aliquots of medium were mixed with an equal volume of Griess reagent (1 % sulfanilamide (Sigma), 0.1 % N-1-naphthylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma), and 2.5 % phosphoric acid). Absorbance was measured at 540 nm with a microplate reader after incubating for 5 min, and converted to nitrite concentrations by reference to a standard curve generated with NaNO2.
Quantification of inflammatory cytokines TNF-a: RAW264.7 cells (1 × 10 5 cells/well) were preincubated at 37 °C for 3 h with or without various concentrations of hetrombopag. After incubation, LPS (10 μg/mL) was added, and cells were incubated for 10 h. After incubation, the culture media in a 96-well plate were harvested, centrifuged at 370×g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant removed and frozen at −30 °C until assay. TNF-α concentration in the supernatants was measured by ELISA.
Cell Viability Assays
Trypan blue assays were performed on cardiac myocytes from each group. Cells that did not stain with Trypan blue were counted as viable cells. Conversely, cells that stained with Trypan blue were counted as non-viable cells. The cell counts were expressed as percentages of the control group.
Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) Assay
Apoptosis of cardiac myocytes from each group was measured using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Slides were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and counterstained with 1 mmol/L of Hoechst 33,258 (Sigma). The percentages of apoptotic nuclei were calculated by determining the number of Hoechst-stained nuclei that were positive for TUNEL staining, and approximately 100 nuclei were counted in each section.
Protein Microarrays
Protein microarray experiments were performed as previously described [ ]. In brief, 2 ml of culture from each experiment was added to 2 ml of blocking buffer (RayBiotech, Atlanta, GA, USA), then the solution was placed on a separate protein array membrane (RayBiotech) and incubated for 2 h at room temperature on a rocker plate. After that, the solution was then aspirated, and each membrane was incubated for 12 h at 4 °C with a customized mixture of biotinylated primary antibodies, which were specific for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), insulin-like growth factor (IGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10, on a rocker plate. The membranes were rinsed, and incubated at room temperature for 2 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Zymed, South San Francisco, California, USA). The membranes were subjected to enhanced chemiluminescence detection and exposed on radiographic film (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Bucks, UK). The protein density expression level was determined with the use of ImagePro image analysis software (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD, USA). All measurements were performed in duplicate, and the results averaged for each measurement. The results for each growth factor or cytokine were normalized to positive controls present on each membrane, and data were expressed as a percentage of control (H 2 O 2 plus human UCB MNCs).
Western Blotting
Human blood was drawn from healthy volunteers with a one-tenth volume of 3.8 % sodium citrate added as an anticoagulant. Animal blood from rat and mice was drawn with a one-tenth volume of 3.8 % sodium citrate as an anticoagulant. Platelet-rich plasma was prepared as previously described [ , ]. Platelets were resuspended in Tyrode’s-HEPES buffer (pH 7.35), and were stimulated with hetrombopag or rhTPO at 37 °C for 15 min. The rat cardiac myocytes from each group in H 2 O 2 -induced damage experiment were washed twice with PBS. For western blot analysis, cells were lysed with RIPA buffer on ice for 30 min. Antibodies against STAT5, phospho-STAT5, cleaved caspase-9 or cleaved caspase-3 were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA, USA), and β-actin antibody was from Sigma. Total lysates were separated by electrophoresis using a 10 ~ 15 % SDS-PAGE gel under reducing conditions and transferred to a sheet of polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). The membrane with blotted protein was blocked for 1 h with blocking buffer containing 5 % nonfat dry milk and 0.05 % Tween-20 in Trisbuffered saline (TBS-T), followed by incubation with antibodies (diluted 1:1000) in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. Then, the membrane was washed three times with TBS-T for 30 min and incubated at room temperature for 1 h with diluted (1:2000) secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Blots were developed using an ECL kit.
Flow Cytometry
Antibodies against CD33, CD34, CD38, CD41, CD133, VEGFR-2 and GlyA were obtained from BD Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). The BD Stemflow hMSC Analysis Kit (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) containing pre-conjugated and pre-titrated cocktails of ISCT-defined positive expression markers (CD105 PerCP-Cy™5.5/CD73 APC/CD90 FITC) and negative expression markers (CD45/CD34/CD14/CD19/HLA-DR PE) was used to examine MSCs. Ex vivo expanded human UBC MNCs were incubated with appropriate dilutions of specific antibodies before analyses using FACSCanto II (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Propidium iodide (Sigma) was added before flow sample running to exclude the dead cells. The percentage and number of cell subsets was determined by flow cytometry.
Statistics
Data were presented as mean ± SEM. Multiple comparisons were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s post-hoc test. The geometric mean EC 50 values of hetrombopag and eltrombopag in Table 1 were compared in view of each cell using Student’s t-test (two-tailed, unpaired). Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05.

Results
Hetrombopag Enhanced Ex Vivo Expansion of Human UCB Stem Cells
Hetrombopag is a member of the biarylhydrazone class of compounds (Fig. 1 a), and demonstrated greater in vitro efficacy than eltrombopag in stimulating the proliferation of TPO-dependent cell lines (Table 1 ). The TPO receptor also was expressed by human UCB stem cells [ ], and therefore, we examined if hetrombopag was more potent than eltrombopag in expanding human UCB stem cells. Human UCB stem cells are highly enriched in the CD34 + CD38 − cells, and the CD34 + CD38 − has been monitored as a surrogate measure of stem cells [ ]. Because the effect of rhTPO was saturated at 10 ng/ml, and 7 μM of eltrombopag manifested the maximum effects [ ], hetrombopag’s effects on promoting proliferation of human UCB stem cells were compared with the maximum effects of rhTPO (10 ng/ml) or eltrombopag (7 μM) in vitro. Fig. 1 Ex vivo expansion of human UCB CD34 + cells in the culture. a Chemical structures of hetrombopag; b The numbers of total viable cell; c The numbers of CD34 + ; d The numbers of CD34 + CD38 − ; e The numbers of CD41 + cells; f the “percentages” of each cell population. Control represents rhSCF (25 ng/ml) and rhFL (50 ng/ml). The cells were counted and analyzed by flow cytometry. Data are showed as mean ± SEM ( n = 5). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 in comparison with control, and #p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01 in comparison with eltrombopag
Human UCB CD34 + cells were cultured in serum-free medium supplemented with rhSCF (25 ng/ml) and rhFL (50 ng/ml) plus either rhTPO (10 ng/ml), eltrombopag (7 μM) or hetrombopag (0.1, 1, 3, 10 μM) for 7 days. In order to facilitate comparison with the literature data, the number of total cells, human CD34 + CD38 − cells (more primitive cell population), CD34 + cells (hematopoietic stem cells) or CD41 + cells (other HPCs) was determined by flow cytometry, and a dose-response analysis of hetrombopag was performed. As expected, hetrombopag significantly promoted the proliferation of human UCB stem cells, and exhibited stronger activities than eltrombopag (Figs. 1 b, e). Compared with the control culture (SF) of rhSCF and rhFL only, the addition of 3 μM hetrombopag reached the maximal effects and significantly increased CD34 + cells by 96.1 %, CD34 + CD38 − cells by 141.9 %, and CD41 + cells by 537.9 %. The maximum activities of hetrombopag was similar to that of rhTPO, and was better than that of eltrombopag (7 μM), and statistical significance was observed on CD34 + CD38 − cells and CD41 + cells (Figs. 1 d, e). Hetrombopag and rhTPO were almost consistent in the extent of cell differentiation induction and maintaining primitive hematopoietic progenitors, since the “percentages” of CD34 + , CD34 + CD38 − cells were almost the same in the cultures with rhTPO vs hetrombopag (Fig. 1 f). We also noted that hetrombopag at higher concentrations (10 μM) manifested potential toxicity and inhibited the proliferation of CD41 + cells (Fig. 1 d) which was similar to eltrombopag [ ]. However, 10 μM of hetrombopag didn’t significantly reduce the number of CD34 + CD38 − cells, and the “percentage” of CD34 + CD38 − cells was slightly increased (Fig. 1 f).
Results from our studies and from others have suggested that the promoting of proliferation effects of rhTPO, eltrombopag or hetrombopag alone would be saturated at higher concentrations, and their maximal effect insufficient for large-scale ex vivo expansion of human USB stem cells. A novel idea inspired us: what would be observed if the culture was supplemented with the combination of hetrombopag and rhTPO?
Combination Effect of Hetrombopag and rhTPO on Ex Vivo Expansion of Human UCB HSC/HPCs
Next, we evaluated the combined effect of hetrombopag and rhTPO. Human UCB CD34 + cells were cultured for 7 days in serum-free media supplemented with rhSCF and rhFL plus the combination of different concentration of hetrombopag and 10 ng/ml of rhTPO. Hetrombopag dose-dependently increased the number of human UCB stem cells in the presence of 10 ng/ml rhTPO (Figs. 2 ). Interestingly, compared with hetrombopag alone, the maximal effect concentration of the combined hetrombopag varied with cell lines. The combination of 3 μM hetrombopag and 10 ng/ml rhTPO nearly achieved the maximal effect for total cells, and increased the numbers to approximately 250 % more than 10 ng/ml TPO alone (Fig. 2 a). For CD34 + cells, the maximal effect concentration of hetrombopag combined was 10 μM, and increased CD34 + numbers to approximately 200 % more (Fig. 2 b). For CD34 + CD38 − , the maximal effect concentration was 3 μM, and increased CD34 + CD38 − numbers to approximately 250 % more (Fig. 2 c). We also observed that when the concentration of the joint hetrombopag increased from 3 μM to 10 μM led to a sharp decrease of CD41 + cells (Fig. 2 d), which further confirmed that 10 μM of hetrombopag may have the potential toxicity on CD41 + cells. Therefore, the combination of 3 μM hetrombopag and 10 ng/ml of rhTPO was used for large-scale ex vivo expansion of human UCB stem cells. Fig. 2 Ex vivo expansion of human UCB CD34 + cells in the culture containing the combination of hetrombopag and 10 ng/ml of rhTPO.

After seven days in culture, the percentage of each cell in the population from randomly selected five bottles was determined by flow cytometry. Ex vivo expanded human UCB mononuclear cells (MNCs) contained 17.3 % hematopoietic CD34 + stem cells, 16.2 % CD34 + CD38 − cells, 12.9 % CD34 + CD33 + cells, 14.5 % CD41 + cells and 9.7 % CD133 + cells in our determination (Fig. 2 e). Ex vivo expanded human UCB MNCs maintained a greater endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) like lineage, and contained 5.7 % CD34 + /VEGFR-2 + cells and 2.1 % CD133 + /VEGFR-2 + cells (Fig. 2 e). In contrast, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) which were positive for CD73, CD90 and CD105, but were negative for CD34, CD45, CD14, CD19, and HLA-DR, couldn’t be detected. These ex vivo expanded UCB MNCs were used in the following experiments.
Hetrombopag Enhanced the Beneficial Effects of Human UCB MNCs and Protected Rat Cardiac Myocytes from H2O2-Induced Apoptosis
Myocardial infarction is characterized by severe myocardial hypoxia and free oxygen radical generation which cause cardiac myocyte apoptosis and necrosis [ ]. Recently, human UCB MNCs containing hematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cells have been confirmed to have the ability of limiting cardiac myocyte apoptosis and necrosis [ , ]. Further, to demonstrate whether ex vivo expanded UCB MNCs, which were increased by the combination of hetrombopag and rhTPO, still retained the function of stem cells, we examined the effects of these UCB MNCs on the cardiac myocyte survival during free oxygen radical stress with H 2 O 2 as well as the synergistic action of hetrombopag as an enhancer of human UCB MNCs.
Ex vivo expanded UCB MNCs and rat cardiac myocytes (H9C2) were treated with a range of concentrations of H 2 O 2 (from 0 μM to 1000 μM), and the results indicated that H 2 O 2 significantly decreased the survival of human UCB MNCs and rat cardiac myocytes in a dose-dependent manner (Figs. 3 a, b). When compared with control, 200 μM H 2 O 2 significantly decreased human UCB MNCs viability by 42.5 % and cardiac myocyte viability by 69.9 %. Therefore, to provide a maximum dynamic range for quantifying protective vs harmful responses, 200 μM H 2 O 2 was chosen in the subsequent experiments. As illustrated in Fig. 3 c, human UCB MNCs or human UCB MNCs plus hetrombopag significantly prevented H 2 O 2 -dependent damage, and restored myocyte survival following the oxidative stress. When compared with H 2 O 2 plus human UCB MNCs, the addition of hetrombopag significantly increased cell viability of cardiac myocytes in a dose-dependent manner, and 0.3 μM, 1 μM or 3 μM hetrombopag increased myocyte viability by 20.3 %, 43.7 % and 46.8 %, respectively. Besides, although without significance, hetrombopag itself showed weak antioxidant activity, and increased the myocyte viability by 15.7 % in comparison with H 2 O 2 only.
TUNEL assay indicated that H 2 O 2 -treated cardiac myocytes exhibited the characteristics of the early stages of apoptotic cell death. When compared with cells treated with H 2 O 2 alone that displayed a high level of TUNEL-positive staining, the number of TUNEL-positive cells in the human UCB MNCs or human UCB MNCs plus hetrombopag treated groups appeared to decline dramatically and dose dependently (Fig. 3 d). Besides, human UCB MNCs plus hetrombopag greatly excelled human UCB MNCs in inhibiting myocyte apoptosis (Fig. 3 d). Western blot analysis further confirmed the results that hetrombopag dose-dependently decreased apoptosis of myocytes, and a reduction of caspase-3 and caspase-9 activity was observed in cardiac myocytes treated with human UCB MNCs plus hetrombopag (Fig. 3 e). These data suggested that cardiac myocyte viability, human UCB MNCs and hetrombopag concentrations were intimately related.
A major mechanism whereby human umbilical cord stem cells may be beneficial in ischemic/infarcted myocardium is the secretion of growth factors and anti-inflammatory cytokines that promote angiogenesis, inhibit cardiac myocyte and endothelial cell apoptosis [ , , , ]. To elucidate these processes as well as the possible molecular mechanisms, we then explored the impact of hetrombopag on human UCB MNCs viability and paracrine factors. Hetrombopag significantly increased human UCB MNCs viability, and promoted the secretion of paracrine factors in a dose-dependent manner. When compared with H 2 O 2 plus human UCB MNCs, the addition of 0.3 μM, 1 μM and 3 μM hetrombopag increased human UCB MNCs viability by 30.5 %, 59.3 % and 67.8 %, and increased the secretion of HGF by 32.7 ~ 82.7 %, IGF by 11.1 ~ 42.4 %, VEGF by 38.9 ~ 142.3 %, IL-4 by 8.5 ~ 45.5 % and IL-10 by 19.8 ~ 74.1 %, respectively (Figs. 3 f, g). All our data suggested that hetrombopag enhanced the beneficial effects of human UCB MNCs in increasing the survival of injured cardiomyocytes during free oxygen radical stress by enhancing human UCB MNCs viability and increasing the secretion of paracrine factors.
Discussion
Successful human HSC transplantation is dependent on the absolute number of CD34 + cells transplanted, and human UCB stem cell transplantation often requires the pooling of multiple cords to obtain the optimal CD34 + cell dose because of the scarcity of stem cells in each unit, which may induce serious concerns [ , , ]. In this study, for the first time, we revealed that hetrombopag in combination with rhTPO could break the saturation limitation of single rhTPO, and manifest an additive effect on human UCB stem cells expansion. The maximum effect of the combination of hetrombopag and rhTPO increased CD34 + CD38 − cells to approximately 250 % more than that of rhTPO only. Although the fact that the small molecular TPO receptor agonist eltrombopag could expand UCB stem cells has been reported previously [ ], we provided a more practical and efficient method for ex vivo expansion of human UCB stem cells. To our knowledge, our manuscript is the first report to describe that the combination of rhTPO and non-peptide small molecular TPO receptor agonist, i.e. hetrombopag, has additive effects on ex vivo expansion of human UCB stem cells.
Another important factor that impacts on the success rate of stem cell transplantation is red blood cell contamination which decreases stem cell viability and colony-forming unit capacity, and hence reduces the recovery of LVEF in patients with myocardial infarction [ , ]. Considering that red blood cell precursors couldn’t persist when cultured, and the percentage of GLyA + cells (immature or mature erythrocyte) was less than 1 % (Fig. 2 e), ex vivo expanded UCB MNCs may have little risk of red blood cell contamination. The implication is significant in that ex vivo expanded UCB MNCs might increase the current success rate of stem cell transplantation when used as a stem cell source.
Although non-peptide small molecular TPO agonists have been studied for many years with respect to their ability to stimulate megakaryocytopoiesis, and hence lead to platelet production [ , ], there are few studies that investigated their cardiovascular protective effects. In the present investigation, we found that the non-peptide small molecular TPO agonist hetrombopag could enhance the beneficial effects of human UCB MNCs and protect rat cardiac myocytes from H 2 O 2 -induced apoptosis. Further experiments indicated that hetrombopag significantly enhanced human UCB MNCs viability and promoted the secretion of growth factors (e.g., HGF, IGF and VEGF) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-4 and IL-10), and hence significantly increased the survival of injured cardiomyocytes caused by H 2 O 2 in comparison with human UCB MNCs alone.
Like most non-peptide small molecular TPO receptor agonists [ , ], hetrombopag also displayed species specificities (Fig. 4 ). Rat cardiac myocytes didn’t express human TPO receptor, and hetrombopag alone couldn’t promote the proliferation or survival of cardiac myocytes. However, in our experiments, hetrombopag itself increased the cardiac myocyte viability and protected the rat cardiac myocytes from oxidative stress. Subsequent studies indicated that hetrombopag at the concentrations of 10 μM had anti-inflammatory activity and significantly reduced the production of NO and TNF-a in LPS stimulated macrophage RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 5 ). Considering that polyphenol compounds with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties have been extensively investigated [ ], we suggest that the rat cardiac myocyte protection may be attributed to the phenolic hydroxyl group it contained.

Although the results from our studies and those of others have suggested that by promoting ex vivo expansion of stem cells directly, or improving “in vivo” stem cells repopulating potential indirectly, or both synergistically, non-peptide small molecular TPO receptor agonists might have the potential to treat arteriosclerosis and myocardial infarction, many unresolved issues remained and needed to be addressed. Firstly, in vivo assessment of the more specific mechanisms of non-peptide small molecular TPO receptor agonists as an enhancer of stem cells for the treatment of MIs should be investigated. Non-peptide small molecular TPO receptor agonists could increase the production of blood platelets [ , ], and whether the increase in blood platelets wouldn’t promote platelet aggregation, cause embolism, and aggravate the risk of myocardial infarction is not yet known and needs to be investigated. Recent clinical trials of eltrombopag indicated that there was no significant increase in fibrosis in biopsy specimens and no thrombotic events throughout the entire study cohort after long-term administration of non-peptide small molecular eltrombopag [ ]. Besides, comparative analyses of eltrombopag and thrombopoietin on in vitro platelet function demonstrated that eltrombopag had little or no effect on overall platelet function, and eltrombopag pretreatment did not result in platelet aggregation or activation [ ]. Although no definitive results are available, all these findings suggest that non-peptidyl TPO receptor agonists have low risk of thrombosis and bone marrow fibrosis.
The current experimental data are derived from basic research, and more studies in larger animals are needed prior to considering clinical trials. Even though, our findings may provide a great deal of exploratory opportunities for improving the success rate of human UCB transplantation as well as the treatment of arteriosclerosis and myocardial infarction.
Conclusions
In summary, our data indicated that hetrombopag in combination with rhTPO exhibited additive effects, and could result in massively ex vivo expanded human UCB stem cells. Ex vivo expanded human UCB MNCs maintained stem cell activity and paracrine capability, and significantly prevented H 2 O 2 -dependent damage and protected rat cardiac myocytes during free oxygen radical stress. In addition, hetrombopag further enhanced the beneficial effects of human UCB MNCs in increasing the survival of injured cardiomyocytes following oxidative stress by increasing human UCB MNCs viability and promoting the secretion of paracrine factors.
