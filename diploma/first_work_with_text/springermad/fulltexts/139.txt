Introduction
Since its introduction in 2001, positron emission tomography (PET)–computed tomography (CT) has rapidly gained clinical acceptance, because the anatomic localization of activity afforded by the CT images benefits patient care. However, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging generally provides better characterization of many soft tissue processes than CT, and the combination of PET with MR (PET–MR) is therefore an alternative attractive pairing for diagnostic imaging. Combined PET–MR scanners became commercially available in 2010, with about 50 systems in operation by 2013. However, no clinical studies (to the best of our knowledge) apart from an earlier study by Nensa have directly compared these two imaging techniques for PET myocardial imaging in the same patient populations.
PET images require accurate correction for photon attenuation. In PET–CT, a rapidly acquired CT scan is used to model the attenuation of the 511 keV photons generated during PET imaging. Dense tissue such as bone will significantly attenuate both x-ray photons from the CT and the 511 keV photons employed for PET imaging. Conversely, materials with low density, such as air, will have little impact on either the CT x-ray photons or 511 keV photons. By contrast, in MR imaging, the intensity of the signal from the excited protons used to generate the MR image is unrelated to the factors causing attenuation of the PET image. For example, tissues which are high-signal on specific MR sequences (e.g., fat, water, and blood pool containing intravenous contrast) may exhibit little photon attenuation, whereas bone, the most attenuating natural tissue in the body, may either appear as fat on an MR (due to its marrow content) or may appear dark in the region of the cortex. Thus, providing correction for photon attenuation in PET–MR imaging paralleling that in PET–CT imaging can be challenging.
A variety of approaches have been employed in MR imaging to correct for photon attenuation. It is possible to distinguish fat, soft tissue, water, and air on MR images. However, correction for bone is problematic due to a lack of signal from cortical bone and the difficulty in differentiating yellow marrow in bone from subcutaneous fat. Generally, this leads to underestimations of SUV (standardized uptake value, a common method of quantitation in PET), in bone of about 11-13%. , While extensive work has focused on correction for attenuation on whole-body , and brain images , for PET–MR, very few studies have addressed this issue for cardiac PET–MR images.
Cardiac PET is frequently performed using time-of-flight (TOF) PET imaging, which is supported by most newer PET–CT scanners. Likewise, some but not all current PET–MR scanners are capable of TOF PET imaging. As prior studies have indicated that PET–CT TOF images may differ from PET–CT non-TOF images, non-TOF PET MR images might also be expected to differ from PET–CT TOF images, due to differences in image reconstruction.
Other factors might also result in disparities between PET–CT and PET–MR images. These include variation in respiratory rates during imaging, different tidal pulmonary volumes, and varying heart rates during acquisition of the emission and attenuation correction images. Moreover, differences in image reconstruction techniques may also result in disparities between PET–CT and PET–MR images.
In most instances, clinical cardiac PET images are interpreted based upon the relative intensities of tracer uptake—for example, in perfusion imaging, images are often displayed normalized to the area of most intense myocardial tracer uptake. Thus, we sought to explore whether PET–MR myocardial FDG images provide relative tracer concentration information which is comparable to PET–CT images, and might therefore be used interchangeably with PET/CT images in clinical practice.
Methods and Materials
This study was approved by the Cleveland Clinic Institutional Review Board, with waiver of consent. A radiologist with board certification in both radiology and nuclear medicine (including nuclear cardiology certification) retrospectively analyzed the whole-body PET–CT images and PET–MR images of 61 individuals who underwent same day PET–MR and PET–CT imaging as part of a prior prospective study comparing the two modalities in oncology patients. PET–MR images were acquired as soon as feasible following PET–CT imaging (mean time interval 42 ± 13 minutes, range 18-90 minutes).
Study Population
Imaging was performed after an overnight fast as part of an oncology study protocol. As a consequence, 33 of the 61 paired studies had myocardial uptake above background and were included in the present study; 27 had both TOF and non-TOF data available, and were analyzed further. Sixteen patients were male and 11 were female. Mean patient age was 56 ± 14 years (range 18-70). Mean body mass index was 26.8 ± 4.0 kg/m 2 (range 18.8-34.0 kg/m 2 ). Three patients (11%) had a history of coronary artery disease; four patients (15%) were diabetic. Indications for imaging included head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (6 patients), lymphoma (6), multiple myeloma (5), cervical cancer (3), ovarian cancer (2), colorectal cancer (2), and a variety of other cancers including mesothelioma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, leiomyosarcoma, vulvar cancer, gastric adenocarcinoma, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, liposarcoma, and invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast, as well as a patient with neurofibromatosis who had imaging for malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors.
PET–CT image acquisition: PET–CT
PET–CT whole-body images were acquired, arms-up, on a Biograph mCT (27 patients) (Siemens Molecular Imaging, Hoffman Estates, IL). PET scan time per bed position was 1-5 minutes (depending on body habitus, decay time, and injected activity). Pixel size was 4 × 4 mm and slice thickness 4 mm. Imaging began a mean of 67 minutes after injection (SD 13 minutes, range 53-108 minutes). The injected activity of FDG varied by weight: 6 millicuries (mCi) (222 megabecquerels = MBq) if <150 lbs (68 kg), 9 mCi (333 MBq) if 150-200 lbs (68-91 kg), and 12 mCi (444 MBq) if 200-250 lbs (91-113 kg). PET axial field of view was 22 cm for PET/CT. Eight patients received 6 mCi, 12 received 9 mCi, and 7 received 12 mCi (±20% as permitted by local regulations). Attenuation correction for CT was performed with 120 kVp CT with 45 mAs reference (with Siemens CareDose 4D dose modulation utilized) and a 5-mm slice thickness done in free-breathing.
PET–MR image acquisition: PET–MR
PET–MR whole-body images were obtained, arms-down, on a Siemens Biograph mMR (Siemens Molecular Imaging, Hoffman Estates, IL). PET scan time per bed position was 5 minutes. Pixel size was 4 × 4 mm and slice thickness 4 mm. PET axial field of view was 24 cm for PET/MR. Attenuation correction for MR was obtained with coronal free-breathing 2-point Dixon sequence with 19 seconds per bed position, TR 3.6 milliseconds (ms), TE 1.225 ms, pixel size 4.1 × 2.6 mm, and a 2.6 mm slice thickness using a 4-class segmentation technique. The extended FOV (MLAA) algorithm was applied. TOF PET imaging is not available for this scanner.
Image reconstruction and analysis
PET–CT images were reconstructed using an iterative OS-EM algorithm with TOF and resolution modeling with 2 iterations, 21 subsets, and a 4-mm Gaussian post-filter. PET–CT images were also reconstructed without TOF (3 iterations, 24 subsets) in each patient in order to directly compare with the non-TOF PET–MR images (this number of iterations has proven to be adequate for our whole-body images). PET–MR images were reconstructed using an iterative ordered subsets-expectation maximization (OS-EM) algorithm with 3 iterations, 21 subsets, and a 4-mm Gaussian post-filter. Generally, alignment between PET and MR or CT was not adjusted, as this was a whole-body scan.
Myocardial PET–CT and PET–MR images were generated from the whole-body images in short axis, vertical long axis, and horizontal long axis planes. The patients’ images were analyzed using Corridor-4DM myocardial processing software (Invia, Ann Arbor, MI). After visual confirmation of appropriate identification of myocardial contours by the software, SUV was determined for each of 17 standard segments in each patient’s image sets (Figure 1 A, B). Mean segmental SUV measurements (SUV mean ) for both PET–MR and PET–CT studies for each of the 17 segments were then recorded. For each patient study, SUV mean values were normalized to the brightest segment (as is typically done when viewing nuclear cardiology studies).

Statistical Analysis
Generally, we analyzed normalized mean tracer uptake values, as we were more concerned with relationships between segments.
For each objective, we first tested the null hypothesis that the mean normalized tracer uptake value was the same for both modalities, vs the alternative that mean normalized tracer uptake was different. Since the normalized tracer uptake values were not normally distributed, the value squared was used in the statistical analysis, based on the optimal value of the Box–Cox transformation. A generalized linear model was fit, where the dependent variable was the transformed value, and the independent variables were segment and modality. Generalized estimating equations, using an exchangeable working correlation, were used to account for the clustered data, i.e., multiple segments per patient. A significance level of 0.05 was used.
We then tested the null hypothesis that the difference between the modalities was not related to gender, BMI, or the normalized tracer uptake value, vs the alternative hypothesis that the difference between the modalities changes by gender, BMI, or the magnitude of the value changes. The difference between modalities’ values was calculated for each segment. A generalized linear model was then fit, where the dependent variable was the difference in the normalized uptake, and the independent variables were BMI group (normal, overweight, and obese), gender, and the value from the PET–CT and segment. Generalized estimating equations, using an exchangeable working correlation, were used.
Results
A plot of the difference between PET–MR and PET–CT against PET–CT value is presented in Figure 2 . Generally, as described, raw PET–MR values tend to be somewhat higher than PET–CT values, although most are close ( ρ = .93). Normalized values for segmental averages are plotted against each other in Figure 3 , with very good correlation ( ρ = .81); a plot of the difference against TOF PET–CT values is presented in Figure 4 . Overall, the plots show the good correlation between PET–MR and TOF PET–CT values. Figure 2 Plot of absolute difference of PET–MR and PET–CT (positive if PET–MR higher) vs PET–CT.

In general (and in keeping with prior work demonstrating that myocardial uptake above a certain level tends to increase over time ) PET–MR SUVs tended to be higher than PET–CT SUVs, to a degree (about 10%) similar to Cheng’s previous findings of a 15-20% increase in myocardial uptake over time . However, this did not achieve statistical significance for normalized values: there was no significant difference between the mean normalized tracer uptake of (non-TOF) PET–MR and the mean normalized tracer uptake of (TOF) PET–CT [0.728 vs 0.726, P = .826; 95% CI for difference: (−0.022, 0.026)], and only a marginally significant difference in normalized tracer uptake values between segments ( P = .057). There was also no significant difference between non-TOF PET–MR and non-TOF PET–CT [0.728 vs 0.742, P = .384; 95% CI for difference: (−0.040, 0.011)], or between TOF PET–CT and non-TOF PET–CT [0.726 vs 0.742, P = .137; 95% CI for difference: (−0.036, 0.002)], and only a marginally significant difference in normalized tracer uptake values between segments ( P = .054 for non-TOF PET–MR vs non-TOF PET–CT, and P = .063 for TOF PET–CT vs non-TOF PET–CT). The results do not change when normalized tracer uptake values, without the squared transformation, are modeled. Averages and standard deviations for raw (un-normalized) SUV mean for TOF and non-TOF PET–CT reconstructions, as well as for PET–MR, are given in Table 1 ; the normalized values are presented in Table 2 . All reported values are mean ± one standard deviation.

As the TOF PET–CT value increases, the non-TOF PET–MR values tend to decrease relative to the TOF PET–CT values ( P = .029). When the TOF PET–CT value is larger, i.e., >.75, the mean PET–CT value is larger than the mean PET–MRI value by 0.023. PET–MR and TOF PET–CT values for segmental averages, separated by gender, are plotted against each other in Figure 5 . PET–MR and TOF PET–CT values for segmental averages, separated by BMI, are plotted against each other in Figure 6 . There is no statistically significant difference in normalized values ( P = .227) by gender. The differences between the PET–CT and PET–MR measurements do show an association with BMI group ( P < .001), with normalized values on PET–MRI being greater for overweight than normal patients by a mean of 0.05.

Discussion
Prior investigations comparing same day PET–CT and PET–MR whole-body oncology images , , have generally shown that sensitivity for lesion detection is preserved and that SUVs are well correlated between PET–MR and PET–CT studies, albeit with differences in organs where PET–MR’s weaknesses in attenuation correction become salient (such as bone). However, in myocardial imaging, one aims to observe relative intensities in an intense structure (‘warm’ vs ‘hot’), whereas whole-body oncologic imaging aims to find intense (‘hot’) areas in a ‘cold’ background (thus, FDG-PET is not sensitive for brain metastases). Whole-body imaging findings may thus not be applicable in the myocardium, and relatively little work specifically on cardiac PET–MR has been done apart from Nensa , so far focusing on simulation studies with phantoms or digitally manipulated patient data, animal studies, or initial feasibility studies of the modality.
Myocardial uptake in PET imaging typically results in an SUV range of 4-7, more intense than most other organs apart from the brain and bladder, though with too much variability to use as a benchmark the way liver and mediastinal blood pool are commonly used in the Deauville score for lymphoma. Basal and lateral segments tend to show more intense uptake. In this investigation, we found a very similar distribution in FDG uptake when comparing PET–MR and PET–CT acquisitions (Figure 2 ), which do demonstrate a tendency for the absolute difference of the segments measured on each modality to increase with the average value of the segment (proportional bias); this is less true for the normalized values (Figure 4 ). This is likely due to the PET–MR exam being consistently obtained after the PET–CT images, allowing for increased glucose uptake and therefore increased signal intensity. Systematic differences between MR-based and CT-based attenuation maps may also contribute to the global SUV difference between PET–MR and PET–CT.
No particular segment, once normalized to the brightest segment, was statistically higher on PET–MR, either vis-à-vis TOF or non-TOF PET–CT; while significant differences in apical uptake have been observed between PET images of obese patients reconstructed with and without TOF, and a small tendency in this area was noted, this was not statistically significant. Overall, this is fairly promising for the use of PET–MR in applications where relative intensity is of interest.
Results are fairly similar for men and women (Figure 5 ), and across a range of BMIs (Figure 6 ), though a small tendency for overweight patients to have higher normalized values was present. It is worth mentioning that the patients were not particularly overweight (about equal numbers of normal, overweight, and obese patients), which may limit applicability somewhat in a more obese population.
The implication, overall, is that PET–MRI can give us the same information on relative uptake of segments as PET–CT, even with the aforementioned attenuation issues. This may even be preserved across TOF and non-TOF differences, and suggests that databases generated using PET–CT might still be usable for interpreting PET–MR studies. Patients could thus theoretically be followed for conditions where multiple PETs are necessary with PET–MR (with its lower radiation dose). This would also enhance the applicability of PET–MR in cases where the combination of MR and PET information would be useful, such as late gadolinium enhancement imaging for viability assessment in ischemic disease and scar assessment in sarcoid.
Limitations
This was a retrospective study, limited to a group of patients on oncologic protocols (where glucose uptake is suppressed by fasting) and myocardial uptake above that of blood pool. In most FDG-PET viability studies, conversely, patients are generally glucose loaded to increase myocardial glucose uptake. Therefore, the results may be somewhat limited in applicability to studies assessing myocardial viability; additional similar ‘normal’ databases of glucose-loaded patients would thus be useful for viability assessments (where normal uptake would likely be higher in any case).
PET–MR was performed 42 ± 13 m after PET–CT, as a result of the predefined oncology study protocol. The distribution thus may have changed between scans; prior studies have shown variation in myocardial uptake between PET scans, both from one scan to the next and over a few hours on the same day . However, many PET–MR scanners do not allow for simultaneous MR and PET acquisition, so this may be more typical of clinical practice.
For whole-body studies, both PET–MR and PET–CT were obtained using a free-breathing method. Conversely, for a dedicated cardiac PET, the CT AC is acquired in breath-hold at end-expiration. Since registration between heart and CT or MR AC map for whole-body oncology imaging is not checked and corrected by the technologist prior to PET image reconstruction, another potential source of artifacts exists. One might expect the severity of artifacts to be greatest in the anterolateral wall (closer to the lung) or in the inferior wall (closest to the diaphragm); however, this was not the case.
Although this study utilized patients with a substantial range of BMI, no morbidly obese patients could be included since the bore size of the PET–MR scanner (60 cm diameter) cannot accommodate them, unlike the PET–CT (78 cm diameter). Prior work has shown that significant differences in myocardial uptake between non-TOF and TOF images do appear for obese patients. The statistical similarity between non-TOF and TOF images found in this study may not apply to obese patients; however, their access to PET–MR may be limited by the small bore diameter anyway.
The reader was unavoidably aware of whether the study in question was a PET–MR or PET–CT based on PACS image labeling, although this is mitigated by the automated nature of most processing (apart from determining the myocardial borders).
New Knowledge Gained
PET–MR does not significantly raise or lower relative uptake in different segments of the heart vis-à-vis PET–CT.
Conclusion
The results of this study suggest that relative myocardial uptake of FDG as measured by PET–CT and PET–MR is very similar. Relationships between segments generally seem to be preserved when comparing PET–MR and PET–CT. Applications such as perfusion imaging which rely primarily on relative uptake of myocardial segments should thus be preserved when comparing examinations performed using PET–MR or PET–CT.
