Introduction
Cervical cancer is one of the most common malignant tumours in the female reproductive system, ranking second only to breast cancer in morbidity worldwide. The occurrence of squamous cell carcinoma, the most common histological type of cervical cancer, is a dynamic and continuous process from cervical intraepithelial neoplasia to invasive carcinoma [ ]. Essential features in the progression of cervical cancer are invasion and metastasis, which are closely related to the prognosis and mortality rate [ ]. The main methods to evaluate cancer invasion and metastasis before surgery are magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT). However, these methods fail to evaluate lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) in cervical cancer before surgery. The most accurate method to detect cancer invasion and metastasis is a biopsy examining lymph node structure and organisation following surgical removal of the nodes. At the present time, however, there is no effective non-surgical technique to evaluate cancer invasion and metastasis. As biopsy tissue is obtained during establishment of the diagnosis of cervical cancer diagnosis, it would be useful to determine the molecular changes which occur in biopsy tissue as a means to evaluate cancer invasion and metastasis.
Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), a key event in embryogenesis, has been shown to be closely correlated with the invasion and metastasis of cancer cells [ ]. Twist1, a basic helix–loop–helix transcription factor, is thought to act as an inducer of EMT and plays a critical role in a variety of carcinomas [ ]. Overexpression of Twist1 is observed in many different types of human cancer and plays an important role in invasion and metastasis in human breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and ovarian cancer [ , , ]. Another EMT-inducing transcription factor, Snail1, is also overexpressed in many kinds of cancers. Studies have revealed that Snail1 acts as a crucial factor regulating EMT [ ], and the expression of Snail1 is an independent negative predictor of prognosis in breast cancer [ ]. Snail1 has also been associated with cancer progression in ovarian cancer and colon cancer [ , ]. Squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCCA), a tumour marker for cervical cancer, is easily detected and commonly used for the preoperative evaluation and postoperative detection of cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) progression [ ]. Therefore, we speculated that it may be possible to combine Twist1, Snail1 and SCCA in a strategy to evaluate CSCC invasion and metastasis.
In this study, the potential correlation between the expression of Twist1 and Snail1 in CSCC tissues and the clinicopathological characteristics of those tissues were investigated to analyse the detection of various combinations of SCCA, Twist1 and Snail1 and the association of the different combinations with the invasion and metastasis of CSCC. The data indicated that the combined detection of Twist1, Snail1 and SCCA is a potential new tool for the preoperational evaluation of the invasion and metastasis of CSCC.
Materials and methods
Tissues
The study material comprised 442 paraffin-embedded cervical tissue samples obtained from patients who had undergone surgery at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, China, Affiliated Hospital of Jining Medical University, China and the First Hospital affiliated to Jiamusi University, China, from January 2014 to June 2017. Serum was collected from these patients at the time of diagnosis before surgery and the serum SCCA concentration measured. In our study, SCCA-positive [ SCCA(+)] serum was defined as a serum SCCA concentration of > 1.4 ng/mL, and SCCA-negative [SCCA(−)] serum was defined as a serum SCCA concentration of ≤ 1.4 ng/mL [ ]. None of the patients received preoperative chemotherapy, radiotherapy or immunotherapy. Full clinical history records and pathological results of these patients were collected, including age, FIGO (Fédération Internationale de Gynécologie et d'Obstétrique) stage, LVSI, lymph node metastasis and histological grade (Table 1 ). Each patient provided informed consent for the use of his/her tissue samples, and this study was approved by the Ethical Committee.

Reagent
Rabbit anti-human Snail1 monoclonal antibody and rabbit anti-human Twist1 monoclonal antibody were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Universal secondary antibody kits were provided by the Beijing Zhongshan Golden Bridge Biotech Co., Ltd. (Beijing, PRC)
Immunohistochemical method and staining evaluation
All samples were fixed in paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin and cut into 4-μm-thick slices for further study. The expression of Snail1 and Twist1 proteins in all samples was detected using an immunohistochemical method. All sections were observed and assessed independently by two pathologists who were blinded to the clinical data. The fraction of stained cells was scored according to the following criteria: 0 indicated that < 5% of the cancer cells were positive; 1 indicated that, 5–50% of the cancer cells were positive; 2 indicated that > 50% of cancer cells were positive. The staining intensity was graded as follows: 0 indicated no staining or weak intensity; 1 indicated moderate intensity; 2 indicated strong intensity. The results of staining intensity and extent of staining gave an overall staining score, where 0–2 indicated low expression and 3–4 indicated high expression.
Cell culture
The human cervical cancer cell line SiHa was maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; HyClone, GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Little Chalfont, UK) containing 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin (Invitrogen Life Technologies,Carlsbad, CA) and cultured in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 and 95% O 2 .
Cell transfection
The GIPZ lentiviral shRNAmir-GFP system (Open Biosystems, Lafayette, CO) was used to knockdown human Twist1 and Snail1 in SiHa cells. Lentiviruses (LVs) driving the co-expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) and short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting Twist1 and Snail1, with a GFP-only empty vector control, were used to transfect SiHa cells. The LVs were titred and stored according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Transwell invasion assays
In vitro cell invasion assays were carried out in Matrigel™-based (Corning Life Sciences and BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) transwell plates with slight modifications. SiHa cells (5 × 104 cells in 500 µL 0.1% FBS + DMEM) were seeded into the Matrigel™-coated upper chambers of a polycarbonate membrane (Corning Costar, Cambridge, MA) with 8-µm-diameter pores. The lower compartments were filled with medium supplemented with 20% FBS. After 24 h, the cells that invaded to the lower surface of the membrane were stained with crystal violet dye and counted under a light microscope (model DP70; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The numbers of cells were determined in eight random fields, and the experiment was repeated three times for each group.
Statistical analysis
The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) version 19.0 software was used. The relationships between Snail1, Twist1 and the patients’ clinicopathological features were analysed using the chi-square test. All statistical tests were performed in a two-sided way. p < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistically significant.
Results
Expression of Twist1 and Snail1 in patients with low-grade squamous intraepithelial neoplasia and CSCC
To investigate the aberrant expression of Twist1 and Snail1 in patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplas and CSCC, we performed immunohistochemistry analyses on 32 normal cervix samples, 36 samples with low-grade squamous intraepithelial neoplasia (LSIL), 54 samples with high-grade squamous intraepithelial neoplasia (HSIL) and 320 CSCC samples. The number of Twist1(+)samples among the normal cervix, LSIL, HSIL and CSCC samples were 2 (6%), 3 (8%),15 (28%) and 157(49%), and the number of Snail1(+) samples were 2 (6%), 2 (6%),13 (24%) and 151(47%), respectively. The results showed that the expression of Twist1 and Snail1 was significantly upregulated in the HSIL and CSCC samples compared to the LSIL and normal cervix samples ( p < 0.05). Representative stained samples showing Twist1 and Snail1 expression in CSCC are shown in Fig. 1 .

The relationship between expression levels of Twist, Snail1 and SCCA and clinicopathological characteristics of CSCC
To study whether the expression of Twist, Snail1 and SCCA was associated with various clinicopathological characteristics in patients with CSCC, we analysed the relationship between the expression levels of these factors and clinicopathological outcomes. As shown in Table 1 , the expression of Twist1 and Snail1 was associated with LVSI, lymph node metastasis and histological grade ( p < 0.05), but not with age or FIGO stage ( p > 0.05). The expression of SCCA was associated with LVSI, lymph node metastasis, FIGO stage and histological grade ( p < 0.05), but not with age ( p > 0.05). A chi-squared test showed that Twist1 expression was significantly correlated with Snail1 expression (Table 2 ).

Twist1, an independent factor for cancer invasion
Numerous studies have revealed that Twist1 is closely associated with cancer cell invasion. To determine the effect of Twist1 on invasion and metastasis in cervical cancer cells, we used transwell assays to investigate the invasion and metastasis ability of SiHa cells by knocking down Twist1 expression with LV-sh-Twist1. Our study indicated that the invasion ability of cervical cancer cells was inhibited by the suppression of Twist1 expression with shRNA. However, knockdown of Snail1 had no effect on the invasion of cancer cells (data not shown). These results suggested that Twist1 is an independent factor for invasion and metastasis of cervical cancer cells (Fig. 2 ). Fig. 2 Knockdown of Twist1 suppresses the invasion of SiHa cells. The results of the transwell assay showed that lentiviral delivery of short hairpin RNA targeting Twist1 ( sh-Twist ) resulted in reduced cell invasion. Three independent experiments were performed.

The expression of Twist1, Snail1 and SCCA can be used to assess the risk of invasion and metastasis of CSCC
Squamous cell carcinoma antigen is commonly used as a marker for preoperative evaluation and postoperative detection of CSCC progression and evaluation of disease prognosis. However, SCCA, which is a tumour marker of cervical cancer, lacks sensitivity and is not a specific marker for invasion and metastasis. In an attempt to identify a better method for evaluating invasion and metastasis of CSCC, we analysed the positive rate of lymph node metastasis and LVSI in SCCA(+), Twist1(+), Snail1(+), Twist1(+)Snail1(+), Twist1(+)SCCA(+), Snail1(+)SCCA(+) and Twist1(+)Snail1(+)SCCA(+) groups. As shown in Table 3 , the positive rates of lymph node metastasis in the SCCA(+), Twist1(+), Snail1(+), Twist1(+)Snail1(+), Twist1(+)SCCA(+), Snail1(+)SCCA(+)and Twist1(+)Snail1(+)SCCA(+) groups were 53, 59, 63, 63, 76, 77 and 78%, respectively. The positive rates of LVSI in the SCCA(+), Twist1(+), Snail1(+), Twist1(+)Snail1(+), Twist1(+)SCCA(+), Snail1(+)SCCA(+) and Twist1(+)Snail1(+)SCCA(+) groups were 49, 57, 55, 57, 72, 73 and 74%, respectively. The positive rates of lymph node metastasis and LVSI in the Twist1(+)SCCA(+), Snail1(+)SCCA(+) and Twist1(+)Snail1(+)SCCA(+) groups were significantly elevated compared with those in the SCCA(+), Twist1(+), Snail1(+) and Twist1(+)Snail1(+) groups ( p < 0.05).The differences in positive rates of lymph node metastasis and LVSI among the Twist1(+), Snail1(+) and Twist1(+)Snail1(+) groups were not obvious ( p > 0.05), and the same results were also found among the Twist1(+)SCCA(+), Snail1(+)SCCA(+) and Twist1(+)Snail1(+)SCCA(+) groups ( p > 0.05). These results suggested that Twist1, Snail1 and SCCA expression could be combined in one method to evaluate the risk of invasion and metastasis of CSCC before surgery.

Discussion
Cervical squamous cell carcinoma is one of the most malignant cancers of the female reproductive system and is prevalent worldwide. As cancer invasion and metastasis is highly related to the prognosis, and a technique to evaluate cancer invasion and metastasis without surgery is presently lacking, a novel and effective technique is needed. In this study, we analysed the potential correlation between the expression of Twist1 and Snail1 in CSCC tissues and clinicopathological characteristics, and also investigated the role of Twist1 and Snail1 on the invasiveness of SiHa cells by the transwell assay. In addition, we examined the effects of various combinations of SCCA, Twist1 and Snail1 on the invasion and metastasis of CSCC. The results showed that the expression levels of both Twist1 and Snail1 were higher in CSCC tissues and that Twist1 was able to act as an independent diagnostic factor for cervical cancer invasiveness. These results are reasonably consistent with those of previous studies [ , , ]. Twist2 has been reported to a independent predictor of lymph node metastasis of CSCC and to have a more effective predictive performance than Twist1 [ , ]. However, as only a small number of specimens were studied in these previous studies, we chose Twist1 as our key isoform of Twist in our study. Moreover, our results indicated that combined detection of Twist1, Snail1 and SCCA may be a potential effective method to evaluate the invasion and metastasis of CSCC before surgery. High-risk metastasis patients with stage I to IIa CSCC, especially patients with stage Ib2 to IIa2 CSCC, should be considered as optimum candidates for concurrent chemoradiotherapy, instead of the “sandwich method” that includes postoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy or neoadjuvant chemotherapy, followed by surgery and courses of maintenance radiotherapy.
At the present time, the preoperative evaluation of invasion and metastasis in cervical cancer is generally performed by imaging studies. In terms of nodal assessment in cervical cancer, the accuracy of MRI to detect lymph node metastases has been reported to be 86% [ ], while CT has been reported to have a sensitivity of 43% to detect lymph node involvement [ ]. A combination of PET and CT as a more accurate method to evaluate lymph node metastases than either CT or MRI alone has a pooled sensitivity and pooled specificity of 82 and 95%, respectively [ ]. However, these three diagnostic modalities, MRI, PET and CT, either alone or in combination, cannot be used to successfully evaluate LVSI in cervical cancer before surgery. In the present study, the positive rate of LVSI in Twist1(+)Snail1(+)SCCA(+) tissue samples was 74%, which is superior to that of MRI, PET or CT. In addition, a method which combines the detection of Twist1, Snail1 and SCCA with imaging methods may have better specificity and sensitivity; however, further research is needed to confirm this possibility.
EMT is a key biological process in cancer invasion and metastasis, and the loss of cell–cell adhesion molecules, such as the downregulation of E-cadherin, is a characteristic feature of EMT [ ]. Twist1 and Snail1 can bind to the E-cadherin promoter and inhibit E-cadherin expression at the transcriptional level. Twist1 and Snail1 also downregulate the expression of other epithelial molecules, including claudins, occludins and Mucin 1, and they induce the expression of genes associated with a mesenchymal and invasive phenotype, such as fibronectin and matrix metalloproteinases [ ]. Given these data, we speculated that Twist1 and Snail1 may be potential markers for evaluating cancer invasion and metastasis. In our study, the results showed that the expression of both Twist1 and Snail1 was significantly upregulated in CSCC samples and was associated with LVSI, lymph node metastasis and histological score. These results are consistent with those of other studies in which Twist1 and Snail1 were also reported to be highly associated with invasion and metastasis in breast cancer, ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer and other cancers [ , , , , ]. LVSI and lymph node metastasis are two main signs of cancer metastasis in postoperative pathological studies. Therefore, our results lead us to conclude that the change in Twist1 and Snail1 expression in pathological biopsies can be used to evaluate the risk of CSCC invasion and metastasis.
To explore the effect of Twist1 and Snail1 on invasion and metastasis in vitro, we used shRNA to knock down the expression of Twist1 and Snail1 in SiHa cells and performed transwell invasion assays. The results indicated that specific inhibition of Twist1 expression resulted in marked reductions in cervical cancer cell invasion, which is consistent with the findings of histological studies on clinical biopsy tissues. It is interesting to note that there was no difference in the degree of invasion and metastasis of SiHa cells when Snail1 was knocked down, possibly because Snail1 needs to cooperate with other factors to regulate the invasive ability of SiHa cells, whereas Twist1 is an independent factor for cancer invasion. Further research is required to clarify this possibility.
SCCA is a serine protease inhibitor that is detectable in normal squamous epithelium but also expressed by neoplastic epithelial cells. It is a glycoprotein that is released by many types of squamous cell carcinoma cells and has been reported to be predictive for the progression of cervical cancer [ , ]. In our study, the expression of SCCA was associated with LVSI, lymph node metastasis, FIGO stage and histological grade. The positive rate of lymph node metastasis and LVSI in the Twist1(+)SCCA(+), Snail1(+)SCCA(+) and Twist1(+)Snail1(+)SCCA(+) groups was higher than that in the Twist1(+), Snail1(+), and Twist1(+)Snail1(+) groups ( p < 0.05). The results showed that the combined detection of Twist1, Snail1 and SCCA can significantly increase the prediction rate of metastasis. One explanation for the 20% additive effect of serum SCCA on the Twist/Snail evaluation may be that SCCA shares a number of different pathways with Twist/Snail to promote tumor invasion. The SCCA-1 isoform, now termed SERPINB3, renders cells more resistant to apoptotic cell death through specific binding with phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) [ ] and inhibits the migration of NK cells [ ]. It can also induce EMT to increase invasiveness potential, in part due to the activation of matrix degradation enzymes [ ]. In addition, SCCA has been found to have low sensitivity but high specificity for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma detection [ ]. While Twist1 and Snail1 have a higher sensitivity, combined detection of Twist1, Snail1 and SCCA may contribute to the elevated positive rate of invasion and metastasis in CSCC. It is interesting to note that there was no significant differences between the Twist1(+), Snail1(+) and Twist1(+)Snail1(+) groups or between the Twist1(+)SCCA(+), Snail1(+)SCCA(+) and Twist1(+)Snail1(+)SCCA(+) groups, possible because Twist1 and Snail1 promote cervical cancer invasion and metastasis through a common mechanism involving the process of EMT [ ]. Although the differences in positive rates of metastasis and metastasis among the Twist1(+)SCCA(+), Snail1(+)SCCA(+) and Twist1(+)Snail1(+)SCCA(+) groups are not obvious ( p > 0.05), the rate in the Twist1(+)Snail1(+)SCCA(+) group was higher than the rates in the Twist1(+)SCCA(+) and Snail1(+)SCCA(+) groups. These findings indicate that combined detection of Twist1, Snail1 and SCCA may be a potential way to evaluate cancer invasion and metastasis before surgery.
In conclusion, the expressions of both Twist1 and Snail1 were upregulated in CSCC and were highly related to LVSI, lymph node metastasis and histological grade. Knockdown of Twist1 by LV-sh-Twist1 suppresses cell invasion and metastasis. The combined detection of Twist and Snail1 in preoperative pathological biopsies and of SCCA is of great value for evaluating the invasion and metastasis of cancer. In future work, we will explore the value of combined detection of Twist1, Snail1 and SCCA for the evaluation of the prognosis of patients with CSCC before surgery.
