Introduction
Atherosclerosis is a vascular disease characterized by lipid-rich plaques accumulation in the arterial walls along with chronic inflammation [ , ]. It has become a major cause for myocardialinfarction, stroke, and unstable angina [ , ]. Increasing evidence suggests that a series of factors contribute to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, including obesity, diabetes, smoking, dyslipidemia, and hypercholesterolemia [ ]. Apart from these conventional factors, recent researchers have demonstrated that chronic stress is another risk factor for atherosclerosis [ , ]. Since it is difficult to define the impact of stress on human atherosclerotic-related cardiovascular disease, relevant animal models have been used for exploring the underlying mechanisms. For example, Wang and colleagues have demonstrated that chronic mild stress (CMS) combined with a high-fat diets affected lipid metabolism and aggravated atherogenesis in rats [ ]. Several researches have indicated that CMS exposure also induced behavioral changes and influenced atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE −/− ) mice, a well-recognized animal model of atherosclerosis [ , ]. Tang et al. further revealed that CMS contributed atherosclerosis in ApoE −/− mice through modulating TLR4/NF-κB pathway-mediated inflammation. However, the precise mechanisms involved in stress-related atherosclerosis are still largely unknown.
6-Gingerol (6-Gin) is a major phenolic component from ginger ( Zingiber officinale ), which is widely used as spice condiments and ingredient in traditional chinese medicine [ , ]. Recent studies have shown that 6-Gin exerts multiple pharmacological properties, such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-tumor, and neuroprotective effects [ , , , ]. In addition, it has been reported to be effective for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases [ , ] and exert vasorelaxant effect in the diabetic rat aorta [ ]. More recently, Okamoto et al. [ ] demonstrated 6-Gin analogue-ameliorated metabolic syndrome in mice fed with high-fat diet (HFD), indicating a potent antilipogenic effect of 6-Gin. Based on these findings, we speculated that 6-Gin, via its pleiotropic properties, might be effective for the treatment of atherosclerosis. In this study, we chose HFD-fed ApoE −/− mice as the atherosclerosis animal model to receive CMS challenge. The potential therapeutic effects of 6-Gin on CMS-induced behavioral changes and atherosclerotic lesions were investigated.
Materials and Methods
Animals
Male ApoE-deficient (ApoE −/− ) mice weighing 15–17 g (4 weeks of age) were used in this study. Mice were housed under standard conditions with access to food and water ad libitum and maintained in a 12-h dark/light cycle. All experiments were carried out in accordance with the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Liaoning University of Traditional Chinese Medicine.
Experimental Design and Drug Treatments
ApoE −/− Mice were randomly divided into eight groups: (a) control group (vehicle-treated ApoE −/− mice), (b) high-fat diet (HFD) group (vehicle-treated + HFD-fed ApoE −/− mice), (c) HFD + 6-gingerol group (6-Gin + HFD-fed ApoE −/− mice), (d) HFD + simvastatin group (Sim-treated + HFD-fed ApoE −/− mice), (e) HFD + CMS group (vehicle-treated + CMS-challenged + HFD-fed ApoE −/− mice), (f) HFD + CMS +6-Gin group (6-Gin-treated + CMS-challenged +HFD-fed ApoE −/− mice), (g) HFD + CMS + Sim group (Sim-treated + CMS-challenged +HFD-fed ApoE −/− mice), (h) HFD + CMS + Lor group (Lor-treated + CMS-challenged + HFD-fed ApoE −/− mice). ApoE −/− mice in the CMS groups were subjected to chronic mild stress (CMS) challenge for 20 weeks. At 5 weeks of CMS exposure, all mice, except the control mice, were fed with a high-fat diet (containing 5% fat and 1% cholesterol). At 8 weeks of CMS exposure, mice in drug treatment groups received 6-Gin (20 mg/kg/day, intragastrically), Sim (10 mg/kg/day, intragastrically), or Lor (0.1 mg/kg/day, intraperitoneally), respectively. The doses of drugs were chosen based on previous studies and our preliminary experiments.
Chronic Mild Stress
The CMS procedure was performed as previously described [ , ], with slight modifications. Briefly, each week of CMS regimen included six different stressors as listed: overnight illumination; 45 degrees cage tile, soiled cage, exposure to rat odor, low-intensity stroboscopic illumination (150 flashes/min), and intermittent sound stimulation (a tone of 80 dB). Stressors were randomly repeated each week for a total of 20 weeks. During and at the end of CMS exposure, behavioral tests, body weight, and food intakes were evaluated.
Behavioral Tests
Sucrose Preference Test
Sucrose preference test was performed to measure anhedonia, a core symptom of depression [ ]. Prior to testing conditions, mice were habituated 2% sucrose solution. For the test, mice were deprived of food and water for 24 h. Then 2% sucrose solution and water bottles were placed in the cage for 1 h. Sucrose preference was measured by calculating the proportion of sucrose consumption out of total consumption of liquid.
Open Field Test
The open field test was performed in a box (100 × 60 × 60 cm) with its floor divided into 15 equal squares. Mice were placed individually and allowed to explore the area for 5 min. The number of squares crossings were recorded and measured.
Atherosclerotic Lesion Analysis
Atherosclerosis within the aorta was analyzed by Sudan IV and Oil Red O staining, as previously reported [ , ]. Briefly, the entire aorta from the heart to iliac bifurcation aorta was harvested, dissected longitudinally, and stained with Sudan IV (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China). Images of plaque size and lesion area were captured and analyzed.
For Oil Red O staining, aortic roots were fixed in 10% formalin, flash frozen in Tissue-Tek OCT, and sliced into 10-μm cryostat sections. Sections were stained with Oil Red O (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo, USA) and hematoxylin. Images were observed under an Olympus DP73 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Data are expressed as the average lesion size per section or the percent of the total aortic surface area in the arch.
Measurement of Proinflammatory Cytokines
Plasma concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 were measured using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits according to the manufacturer instructions.
Analysis of Plasma Lipid Profile
Concentrations of plasma lipid profile including triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterin(LDLc), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc) were measured using commercially available kits (Nanjing Jiancheng Institute, China). The assays were performed in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.
Real-Time PCR
SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 mRNA expression in the liver was determined by real-time PCR analysis. Total RNAs from the aorta were extracted using simple total RNA kits (BioTeke, Beijing, China), then reverse-transcribed to cDNAs using Super M-MLV reverse transcriptase kit (BioTeke). The primers for SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 are as follows: SREBP-1, 5′-TCGGCACCCGCTGCTTTA-3′ (forward), and 5′-GGGTCCCTGAGAAGCCTGAAG-3′ (reverse); SREBP-2, 5′-GGTAAATCCACGGTCCAAG-3′ (forward), and 5′-AAGAGAACCAGAGGCAGAAAG-3′ (reverse); β-actin, 5′-CTGTGCCCATCTACGAGGGCTAT-3′ (forward), and 5′-TTTGATGTCACGCACGATTTCC-3′ (reverse).
Western Blot Analysis
Protein expression of SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 within the aorta was determined by Western blot with standard protocol. Briefly, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). The primary antibodies for incubation included anti-SREBP-1 (1:500, Sangon Biotech) and anti-SREBP-2 (1:500, Proteintech Group, Inc., Wuhan, China), anti-p-AMPK, anti-AMPK (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), anti-ACC (1;500, Boster, Wuhan, China), anti-HMGCR (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA), anti-FAS (1:1000, Proteintech). The second antibody used was goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Shanghai, China). Protein band densities were analyzed with Gel-Pro Analyzer software 4.0 (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD, USA).
Statistical Analysis
All data were presented as mean ± SD. Statistical analysis was done by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni post hoc comparison. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Effects of CMS and 6-Gin Treatment on Body Weight and Energy Intake
The body weight and energy intake of mice were assessed over the course of the experiment. As shown, the body weight and energy intake in HFD-fed mice were markedly increased compared with the control mice (Fig. 1 a, b, p < 0.01). CMS exposure significantly reduced body weight gain and energy intake. There were no significant differences among HFD + CMS, HFD + CMS + 6-Gin, HFD + CMS + Lor group ( p > 0.05). Fig. 1 Effect of CMS challenge on body weight and food intake in ApoE −/− mice. The CMS procedure lasted for 20 weeks. a Final body weight and b energy intake showed at week 20 of CMS procedure. At week 5 of CMS, mice were fed with ND or HFD and then received 6-Gin, Sim, Lor, or vehicle treatment. HFD mice without CMS exposure exhibited significant increases in body weight and energy intake compared with the control group. CMS challenge markedly lowered the body weight and energy intake. Data are presented as mean ± SD ( n = 6 for each group). ## p < 0.01 versus the control group, && p < 0.01 versus the HFD group
Effects of CMS and 6-Gin Treatment on Depressive Behavioral Phenotypes
To validate the CMS model and evaluate the effects of 6-Gin on behavioral changes in CMS-exposed mice, sucrose preference and the open field tests were performed during CMS. Data from the sucrose preference test showed that mice without CMS exposure showed normal sucrose consumption. In comparison, CMS resulted in significant reduction in sucrose consumption (Fig. 2 a, p < 0.01). Stressed mice with 6-Gin, Sim, or Lor treatment effectively reversed the sucrose percentage ( p < 0.05 or p < 0.01). Fig. 2 Effect of CMS and drug treatment on depressive behavioral phenotypes in ApoE −/− mice a Sucrose preference and b open field tests were performed in mice with or without CMS exposure at week 20. CMS significantly reduced sucrose consumption and numbers of squares crossings compared with the control group; treatment with 6-Gin, Sim, or Lor significantly reversed the depressive behaviors compared with the HFD + CMS group. Data are presented as mean ± SD ( n = 6 for each group). ## p < 0.01 versus the control group, * p < 0.05 or ** p < 0.01 versus the HFD + CMS group
Similar results were observed in the open field test, as evidenced by decreased crossing numbers in CMS-exposed mice (Fig. 2 b, p < 0.01) and increased crossing numbers after 6-Gin, Sim, or Lor treatment (Fig. 2 b, p < 0.05 or p < 0.01). There were no significant depression-like behaviors found among the groups without CMS challenge. These results suggest that CMS exposure can induce behavioral changes in ApoE −/− mice, and 6-Gin is able to ameliorate the depressive behavioral phenotypes induced by CMS.
Effects of CMS and 6-Gin Treatment on Aortic Atherosclerotic Lesions in HFD-fed ApoE−/− Mice
It has been shown that CMS exposure can accelerate atherosclerosis [ , ]. To confirm the CMS effect and determine the role of 6-Gin, we performed Sudan IV and Oil Red O staining. As shown in Fig. 3 A–D, HFD resulted in significant atherosclerotic lesions throughout the aorta compared with the control group. CMS exposure further aggravated the atherosclerotic lesions size stained by Sudan IV and increased plaque formation in the aortic root showing by Oil Red O staining. Treatment with 6-Gin or Sim significantly alleviated the atherosclerotic lesions (Fig. 3 A, B). In addition, the aortic sinus atherosclerotic lesions were also ameliorated by drug treatment (Fig. 3 C, D). Together, these results suggest that CMS can aggravate atherosclerotic plaque formation and 6-Gin was able to reduce these lesions in aortas.

Effects of CMS and 6-Gin Treatment on Proinflammatory Mediators in HFD-Fed ApoE−/− Mice
Previous studies have shown a correlation between CMS and inflammation in atherosclerosis. To confirm inflammation induced by CMS and clarify potential anti-inflammatory effects of 6-Gin, we determined plasma TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 levels in ApoE −/− mice fed HFD. ELISA analysis results showed that the plasma levels of TNF-α (Fig. 4 a, p < 0.01), IL-1β (Fig. 4 b, p < 0.01), and IL-6 (Fig. 4 c, p < 0.01) were significantly elevated in HFD mice compared with control mice, CMS exposure led to further elevation of these cytokines. In contrast, 6-Gin or Sim treatment significantly decreased TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 levels. Fig. 4 Effect of CMS and drug treatment on plasma inflammatory cytokines in ApoE −/− mice. Plasma levels of a TNF-α, b IL-1β, and c IL-6 levels in ApoE −/− mice detected by ELISA. Data are presented as mean ± SD ( n = 6 for each group). ## p < 0.01 versus the control group, * p < 0.05 or ** p < 0.01 versus the HFD group or HFD + CMS group, && p < 0.01 versus the HFD group
Effects of CMS and 6-Gin Treatment on Plasma Lipid Levels in HFD-Fed ApoE−/− Mice
Increased plasma lipid levels are closely related to the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. We therefore measured the effects of CMS and 6-Gin treatment on lipid profile levels. ApoE −/− mice fed with HFD resulted in significant increases in TC, TG, and LDLc levels compared with control mice fed with standard chow (Fig. 5 a, b, d, p < 0.01). CMS exposure further elevated the levels of these parameters in HFD ApoE −/− mice ( p < 0.01 vs. HFD group). Treatment with 6-Gin (20 mg/kg/day, i.g) or Sim (10 mg/kg/day, i.g) significantly reduced the TC, TG, and LDLc levels ( p < 0.01 vs. HFD + CMS group). The level of HDLc was deeply decreased in either HFD or HFD + CMS mice, 6-Gin or Sim treatment notably reversed the level of plasma HDLc (Fig. 5 c, p < 0.05 or p < 0.01). Treatment with Lor had no effect on TG and HDLc levels. Fig. 5 Effect of CMS and drug treatment on plasma lipid levels in ApoE −/− mice. Plasma lipid levels of a TC, b TG, c HDLc, and d LDLc were detected by ELISA. TC total cholesterol, TG triglyceride, HDLc high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, LDLc : low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. CMS further increased the levels of TC, TG, and LDLc induced by HFD. 6-Gin ameliorated the lipids disturbance compared to the HFD + CMS group. Data are presented as mean ± SD ( n = 6 for each group). ## p < 0.01 versus the control group, * p < 0.05 or ** p < 0.01 versus the HFD group or HFD + CMS group, && p < 0.01 versus the HFD group
Effects of 6-Gin Treatment on Lipid Metabolism in HFD-Fed ApoE−/− Mice
We further investigated whether 6-Gin affects fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis. We examined the expression levels of transcription factors SREBP-1/2 and related target genes in the liver. Both mRNA and protein levels of SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 were upregulated in HFD group (Fig. 6 a, b; p < 0.01 vs. control). CMS further increased the expression levels of SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 compared with HFD alone group (Fig. 6 a, b; p < 0.01). In addition, the protein levels of ACC, FAS, and HMGCR significantly increased in CMS group (Fig. 6 c), indicating impaired energy metabolism after CMS. 6-Gin treatment markedly reduced expression levels of SREBP-1, SREBP-2, ACC, FAS, and HMGCR. Fig. 6 6-Gin regulation of lipid synthesis and cholesterol metabolism and in ApoE −/− mice. a , b hepatic SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 protein and mRNA levels were determined by Western blot and real-time PCR analysis. c Expression levels of ACC, FAS, HMGCR and d AMPK, p-AMPK in liver tissues were determined by Western blot analysis. β-Actin was used as an internal control. Data are presented as mean ± SD ( n = 6 for each group). ## p < 0.01 versus the control group, ** p < 0.01 versus the HFD group or HFD + CMS group, && p < 0.01 versus the HFD group
Since the AMPK pathway is a major regulator of energy metabolism, we therefore further investigated whether 6-Gin regulated energy metabolism through the AMPK pathway. As expected, CMS exposure markedly decreased AMPK phosphorylation, 6-Gin significantly increased AMPK phosphorylation in stressed ApoE −/− mice (Fig. 6 d). Together, these results suggest that 6-Gin regulates lipid metabolism partially through the AMPK pathway in stressed ApoE −/− mice.
Discussion
6-Gin was previously shown to be effective in ameliorating metabolic syndrome in HFD-fed mice [ ]. However, whether 6-Gin has a therapeutic effect on CMS-induced atherosclerosis remains unclear. In the present study, we assessed the potential therapeutic effect of 6-Gin on CMS-induced atherosclerotic lesions in ApoE −/− mice. Our results demonstrated that 6-Gin treatment improved the behavior changes in stressed mice, alleviated plaque formation and lipid abnormities, and also inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokines production. We further indicated that the antiatherosclerotic effects of 6-Gin is mediated in part by the AMPK signaling pathway, which is mainly associated with cholesterol synthesis and lipid accumulation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report revealing the effects of 6-Gin on CMS-induced atherosclerosis.
CMS is increasingly recognized as an important risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases [ , ]. CMS exposure can induce both psychiatric disorders and biochemical changes in atherosclerosis animals [ , ], and the behavioral changes are similar to human depression. In the present study, we first confirmed the behavior changes in ApoE −/− mice induced by CMS, and evaluated the antidepressive effect of 6-Gin. Our results showed that CMS-challenged mice exhibited reduced sucrose preference and locomotor activity, reflecting pathogenic features of depression [ , , ]. Some literatures also considered body weight gain as another important index of stress-induced depression [ , ]. CMS exposure induced decreased body weight gain and appetite [ ]. Consistent with these results, here we demonstrated that CMS-exposed mice exhibited less body weight gain and food intake compared with the HFD-fed mice without stress exposure. Our results confirmed the effectiveness of CMS model in our study, and we further examined the effect of 6-Gin treatment on CMS-induced atherosclerosis. We found that 6-Gin produced an antidepressant effect on CMS-exposed mice, evidenced by increased sucrose consumption, mobility, body weight gain, and food intake. These results suggest the beneficial effect of 6-Gin on CMS-evoked atherosclerosis might be partially related to its antidepressant action.
Of note, high-fat (HF) overfeeding can result in increased body weight gain and plasma lipids associated with atherosclerosis, especially such as LDL cholesterol (LDLc) and triglyceride (TC) [ , ]. In the present study, HFD feeding induced significant increases in body weight gain, and plasma TC, TG, and LDLc levels. By contrast, CMS exposure reduced food intake and weight gain but further enhanced plaque accumulation and lipid abnormities in HFD-fed mice. These results indicate that potential other mechanisms exist in the process. In fact, accumulating evidence has suggested that inflammation occurs during the cardiovascular disease process [ , ], CMS further aggravates the inflammatory process during atherosclerosis [ , , ]. Many inflammatory cytokines participate in plaque formation. Inhibition of these cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6 reduce atherosclerosis in ApoE −/− mice [ ]. Here we demonstrated that CMS resulted in higher levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 than the HFD group, confirming that inflammation contributes to CMS-induced atherosclerosis. The anti-inflammatory property of 6-Gin has been reported in numerous disorders, such as ischemia/reperfusion-induced damage [ ], liver fibrosis [ ], and sodium-induced ulcerative colitis [ ]. Consistent with these data, here we also demonstrated that 6-Gin effectively reduced the levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in both HFD-fed and stressed mice, highlighting the anti-inflammatory effect of 6-Gin on CMS-induced atherosclerotic lesions.
CMS has been shown to affect lipid metabolism [ ]. Dysregulation of lipid homeostasis is closely related to the pathology and progression of atherosclerosis. The liver plays a central role in lipid homeostasis, it regulates the synthesis, secretion, and clearance of cholesterol-rich lipoproteins [ ]. Accumulating evidence suggests that the transcription factors SREBPs play essential roles in the process of lipid biosynthesis [ ]. On the one hand, the SREBP-1 isoform activates the expression genes that involved in fatty acids synthesis, such as ACC and FAS [ , ]. On the other hand, the SREBP-2 isoform stimulates the expression of genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, such as HMGCR. Up-regulation of SREBPs has been observed in the liver of HFD-fed mice [ , ]. In the data presented here, CMS with HFD mice presented higher levels of TC, TG, and LDLc than HFD only group, suggested lipid abnormality under CMS exposure. Thus we further investigated whether CMS affects fatty acid and cholesterol homeostasis. Hepatic SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 at both mRNA and protein levels were markedly increased in stressed mice. In addition, the key proteins for fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis, including ACC, FAS, and HMGCR were also upregulated. 6-Gin significantly reduced the levels of SREBP-1 and SREBP-2, as well as ACC, FAS, and HMGCR. These results suggest that 6-Gin affects both lipogenesis and cholesterol homeostasis in CMS-exposed ApoE −/− mice.
AMPK is a member of a metabolite-sensing protein kinase family, which plays important roles in the regulation of hepatic metabolism [ ]. Activation of AMPK can phosphorylates and inhibits some key metabolic enzymes such as ACC and HMGCR, subsequently accompanied by decreased fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis [ , ]. Previous studies have shown that the AMPK pathway is inhibited in HFD-fed mice [ ], as well as in CMS-exposed mice [ ], suggesting an important role of AMPK in the development of CMS-induced atherosclerosis. Consistent with previous findings, here we demonstrated that CMS exposure markedly decreased AMPK phosphorylation, accompanied by increased ACC, FAS and HMGCR expression, suggesting impaired energy homeostasis after CMS. 6-Gin significantly increased AMPK phosphorylation and downregulated metabolism-related ACC, FAS, and HMGCR expression in stressed ApoE −/− mice. Together, these results suggest that 6-Gin affects lipid metabolism partially through the AMPK pathway in stressed ApoE −/− mice.
In summary, our studies demonstrate that 6-Gin attenuates arteriosclerosis in ApoE −/− mice accelerated by CMS. The potential mechanisms include improved behavioral changes, reduced inflammation, and regulation of lipid metabolism by the AMPK pathway. Therefore, 6-Gin may be a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of arteriosclerosis.
