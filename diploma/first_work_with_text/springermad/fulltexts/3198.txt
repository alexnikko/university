Introduction
Pharmaceutical co-crystals not only provide an available approach to improve the physicochemical property, solubility and in vitro dissolution rate, as well as in vivo bioavailability of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), but also create a new challenge for pharmaceutical companies to address the intellectual property and new patent of APIs for extending their life cycle [ , , , , , , ]. In comparison to the commercial APIs, the co-crystal formed by both API and co-former generally has unique properties which could create high commercial value [ , , ]. In April 2013, the US FDA has released a formal guidance regarding how regulators plan to classify pharmaceutical products with solid-state co-crystals [ ]. This guidance provides applicants of New Drug Applications (NDAs) and Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) with FDA’s thinking on the appropriate regulatory classification of pharmaceutical co-crystal solid-state forms. FDA declares that sponsors of both NDAs and ANDAs should submit data to FDA showing that the API and co-former in the co-crystal form exist in their neutral states and interact via nonionic interactions. This implies that the pharmaceutical co-crystal may be one of the coming waves of new drug substances [ , ].
Co-crystals can be constructed through several types of intermolecular interaction such as hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces, and π-π stacking interactions in a definite stoichiometric ratio, in which hydrogen bonding is the most popular mode of intermolecular interaction between both API and co-former [ , , ]. Due to the weak intermolecular forces, co-crystal is easily dissociated and transformed to parent API by external factors such as temperature, humidity, pH, and others for losing co-crystal’s merits [ , , , ]. Thus, the stability of co-crystal should be carefully understood prior to considering it as a viable alternative solid form [ , , ]. Therefore, how to maintain the solubility and stability of an intact co-crystal form in the in vitro dissolution medium or in vivo gastrointestinal tract is of the utmost importance and gives an interesting challenge for pharmaceutical scientists.
Previous work describes the development of supersaturable formulations by incorporating a high molecular weight water-soluble polymer into a formula to maintain and promote the degree and duration of supersaturation of many poorly water-soluble drugs [ , , , ]. These high molecular weight water-soluble polymers not only can prevent the precipitation and/or recrystallization of poorly water-soluble drug from the formulation but also can maintain a higher aqueous solubility of the drug in the dissolution medium or in the gastrointestinal tract. The application of supersaturation technique to enhance the bioavailability of co-crystals has been practically challenged in the formulation design of pharmaceutical co-crystals [ , , , ]. Remenar et al. found that excipients such as polyvinylpyrrolidone K-30 and sodium lauryl sulfate could effectively inhibit the transformation of celecoxib-nicotinamide co-crystal to less soluble celecoxib [ ]. Childs et al. recently reported to use a supersaturating co-crystal formulation for achieving consistent absorption, leading to a higher bioavailability of danazol co-crystal [ ]. These studies strongly suggest that a high molecular weight water-soluble polymer might be added to the co-crystal formulation to prevent dissociation, recrystallization, and/or precipitation of API from co-crystal, resulting in a possible long-term supersaturated concentration of API in the solution and an enhancement of the aqueous solubility and oral absorption of co-crystal formulations.
In our previous study, indomethacin (IMC)-saccharin (SAC) co-crystals via intermolecular hydrogen bonding had been successfully prepared by using solvent evaporation, neat grinding process, or thermal stress [ , , ]. IMC-SAC co-crystals had been reported to improve the dissolution rate than that of the parent IMC and particularly exhibited >13 times solubility higher than IMC at pH 1–3 values [ , ]. Since IMC-SAC co-crystal was only formed via a weak force of hydrogen bonding between IMC and SAC, however, the possible transformation from IMC-SAC co-crystal to the low-solubility of IMC in the dissolution medium or in the gastrointestinal tract should be paid more attention. In order to maintain the appropriate levels of drug supersaturation upon dissolution and the long-term physical stability of the IMC-SAC co-crystals, a formulation design of IMC-SAC co-crystal being able to prevent the transformation from IMC-SAC co-crystal to poorly soluble IMC was attempted by incorporating a new pharmaceutical excipient, Soluplus. Soluplus is a new polymer prepared from polyvinyl caprolactam-polyvinyl acetate-polyethylene glycol graft copolymer with amphiphilic properties for preparing solid dispersions of poorly water-soluble drugs by hot-melt extrusion technology [ , , ]. Due to the bifunctional character of Soluplus, it is able to act as a matrix polymer for solid dispersions and also capable of solubilizing drugs in aqueous media to sustain supersaturation behavior of the poorly water-soluble drugs.
In this study, Soluplus was separately co-dissolved with IMC, SAC, the IMC-SAC physical mixture (molar ratio = 1:1), or the previously made IMC-SAC co-crystals in acetone, then completely dissolved by ultrasonication and evaporated via air-drying process. The effect of Soluplus on the solid-state characteristics and physical transformation of the above samples was investigated by thermoanalytical and FTIR spectroscopic studies. Particularly, whether Soluplus could improve the IMC-SAC co-crystal formation or dissociate the previously made IMC-SAC co-crystals was studied. The physical stability of both Soluplus/IMC-SAC systems prepared by different procedures under accelerated storage conditions was also evaluated by using the curve-fitting analytical technique from the FTIR spectra, similar to our previous studies on formation of inclusion complex or co-crystal [ , ].
Materials and Methods
Materials
IMC (γ-form) and SAC were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA), which were previously confirmed by FTIR microspectroscopy and directly used without further treatment. Soluplus ® was kindly obtained from BASF Co., Ltd. (Ludwigshafen, Germany). All organic solvents used were reagent grade. Potassium bromide (KBr) crystals were bought from Jasco Co. (Tokyo, Japan).
Preparation of Different IMC Polymorphs, SAC, or Soluplus Samples
The α-form of IMC (α-IMC) was prepared by dissolving γ-IMC in the heated absolute ethanol, followed by precipitation after adding Milli-Q water (antisolvent) [ , ]. Amorphous IMC was also prepared by melting the γ-IMC at 165 °C under nitrogen atmosphere using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC, Q 20, TA Instruments, Inc., New Castle, DE, USA) and then rapidly quenching the molten sample in liquid nitrogen [ , , ]. SAC or Soluplus was respectively dissolved in acetone and then slowly evaporated under a hood at ambient conditions (temperature of 25 ± 2 °C and relative humidity (RH) of 65 ± 5 %, i.e., air-drying process). All the samples were vacuum-dried at room temperature and stored in a desiccator filled with anhydrous calcium chloride.
Preparation of Soluplus-IMC or Soluplus-SAC Mixture
Soluplus with γ-IMC or SAC (weight ratio = 1:1) was respectively prepared by complete dissolving it in acetone. Each sample solution was then evaporated via air-drying process. All the evaporated samples were vacuum-dried at room temperature and stored in a desiccator filled with anhydrous calcium chloride for further studies.
Preparation of IMC-SAC Co-crystals
The preparation of IMC-SAC co-crystals was modified by evaporation of an acetone solution containing the same molecular ratio of IMC and SAC via air-drying process [ , , , ]. After complete evaporation, the co-crystals were obtained. The resultant co-crystals were rinsed with cold ethanol to remove any traces of IMC or SAC that might be present. The co-crystal sample was then vacuum-dried at room temperature and stored in a desiccator filled with anhydrous calcium chloride until analysis.
Effect of Soluplus on the Co-crystal Formation of IMC-SAC Mixtures
Two procedures were carried out at 25 ± 2 °C/65 ± 5 % RH conditions to investigate the effect of Soluplus.
Procedure I: by Co-dissolving Both Soluplus and the Previously Made IMC-SAC Co-crystals into Acetone
The same weight ratio of Soluplus and the previously made IMC-SAC co-crystals was fully co-dissolved in acetone by ultrasonication. After complete dissolution, the sample solution was then air-dried.
Procedure II: by Co-dissolving Soluplus, IMC, and SAC into Acetone
Soluplus, IMC, and SAC were co-dissolved together in acetone, wherein the weight ratio of Soluplus to IMC-SAC (molar ratio = 1:1) mixture was 1:1. After ensuring that all the materials were completely dissolved in acetone by ultrasonication, the sample solution was evaporated by air-drying process.
All the mixed samples were vacuum-dried at room temperature and stored in a desiccator filled with anhydrous calcium chloride for further studies.
Identification and Characterization of Different Samples
Each sample was respectively analyzed by DSC (DSC, Q 20, TA Instruments, Inc., New Castle, DE, USA) from 30 °C to 250 or 300 °C at 3 °C/min with an open pan system in a stream of N 2 gas. The instrument was calibrated for temperature and heat flow using indium as a standard. Moreover, a trace amount of sample was sealed inside two KBr pellets (without any grinding process with KBr powders) by direct compression with an IR spectrophotometric hydraulic press (Riken Seiki Co., Tokyo, Japan) at 400 kg/cm 2 for 15 s. The compressed KBr disc was examined by transmission FTIR microspectroscopy (IRT-5000-16/FTIR-6200, Jasco Co., Tokyo, Japan) with a mercury-cadmium telluride (MCT) detector. All FTIR spectra were generated by compiling a series of 256 interferograms collected at 4 cm −1 resolution and at 100 scans [ , , ]. Three runs were made for each experimental sample.
Effect of Soluplus on Physical Stability of IMC-SAC Mixture After Solvent Evaporation
The polymorphic change and physical stability of the above Soluplus/IMC-SAC mixtures were examined after solvent evaporation via air-drying process. This study was performed under accelerated conditions at 40 ± 2 °C/75 ± 5 % RH with time. At time intervals of 1, 14, 28, 42, 60, and 72 days, each sample was analyzed by DSC thermoanalytical method and FTIR spectroscopy with spectral curve-fitting technique. The components and compositions of all Soluplus/IMC-SAC mixtures were estimated quantitatively in the 1800–1530 cm −1 region of FTIR spectra by a curve-fitting algorithm with a Gaussian–Lorenzian function, as described in our previous studies [ , ]. The curve-fitting program was combined with a nonlinear deconvolution technique to probe the nature and extent of structural changes in the IR spectra of different samples. The best curve-fitting procedure was performed by iterative fits toward a minimum standard error. Because the analysis depends on the positions and intensities of the components of the contour, substantial attention must be paid to obtaining the best possible fit with the minimum number of component bands. The relative proportion of a component was computed to be the fractional area of the corresponding peak, divided by the sum of areas of all the peaks. Three runs were carried out and the mean was obtained.
Results and Discussion
Identification of Different Types of Samples
Figure 1 shows the DSC curves and FTIR spectra of γ-IMC (a), α-IMC (b), amorphous IMC (c), SAC (d), acetone-evaporated SAC (e), Soluplus (f), and the acetone-evaporated Soluplus (g) samples. It clearly reveals that two endothermic peaks at 161 and 156 °C in the DSC curves (Fig. 1a (a and b)) were due to the melting of γ-IMC and α-IMC, respectively [ , ]. While the DSC curve of the amorphous IMC displays one exothermic peak at 123 °C and three endothermic peaks at 44, 156, and 161 °C (Fig. 1a (c)). The exothermic peak at 123 °C was attributed to the recrystallization of the amorphous IMC after passing through the Tg at 44 °C [ , ] and another two endothermic peaks at 156 and 161 °C were respectively corresponded to the melting of α-IMC and γ-IMC. This indicates that the amorphous IMC first exhibited an endothermic relaxation peak near at 44 °C, and then accompanied by exothermic recrystallization, and followed by transformation into α-IMC and less often into γ-IMC. While the endothermic peak at 229 °C corresponded to the melting of SAC was separately observed in the DSC curves of SAC and acetone-evaporated SAC (Fig. 1a (d and e)), suggesting that there were no any alteration for SAC after solvent evaporation. On the other hand, a broad endothermic peak near at 72–73 °C was observed in the DSC curve of pure Soluplus or acetone-evaporated Soluplus (Fig. 1a (f or g)), which belonged to Tg of amorphous Soluplus [ , ]. This also implies that the solvent evaporation process did not influence the amorphous structure of Soluplus. Fig. 1 DSC curves and FTIR spectra of γ-IMC ( a ), α-IMC ( b ), amorphous IMC ( c ), SAC ( d ), acetone-evaporated SAC ( e ), Soluplus ( f ), and the acetone-evaporated Soluplus ( g ) samples
Several characteristic IR absorption bands and their assignments of γ-IMC and α-IMC (Fig. 1b (a and b)) are listed as follows: 1718 cm −1 [ν(C=O) of carboxylic acid dimer], 1691 cm −1 [benzoyl ν(C=O)], 1625–1575 and 1480 cm −1 (C=C of aromatic rings), 1307 cm −1 (C–O of acidic group), 1270–1200 cm −1 (-C-O stretching, ether group), 1068 cm −1 (C–Cl) for γ-IMC [ , , , ]; 1734 cm −1 [non-hydrogen bonded acid ν(C=O)], 1692 cm −1 [benzoyl v(C=O)], 1688 and 1649 cm −1 [hydrogen bonded acid v(C=O)], 1478 cm −1 (C=C of aromatic rings), 1320 cm −1 (C-O of acidic group), 1224 cm −1 (-C-O stretching, ether group), and 1074 cm −1 (C–Cl) for α-IMC, respectively [ , , , ]. While the amorphous IMC exhibits a unique FTIR spectrum including a shoulder at 1735 cm −1 [non-hydrogen bonded acid ν(C=O)], 1710 cm −1 [asymmetric acid ν(C=O) of a cyclic dimer], 1683 cm −1 [benzoyl v(C=O)], and 1591 cm −1 [ring vibration of indole] (Fig. 1b (c)), which was in agreement with the reported IR spectrum of amorphous IMC [ , , , ]. It is also found that the band at 1718 cm −1 due to asymmetric acid ν(C=O) of a cyclic dimer for crystalline γ-IMC was shifted to a lower frequency of about 1710 cm −1 , implying that the dimers formation was also presented in the amorphous state of IMC [ , ]. Both the raw material of SAC and acetone-evaporated SAC reveal the same IR spectra (Fig. 1b (d and e)); several FTIR peaks at 3094 cm −1 (N-H), 2973 cm −1 (C-H), 2696 cm −1 (N-H), 1718 cm −1 (C=O), 1592 and 1459 cm −1 (C-C stretching of benzene ring), and 1335 and 1177 cm −1 (asymmetric and symmetric SO 2 stretching) were observed in the FTIR spectra of both SAC samples [ , , ]. Whereas the characteristic IR absorption bands and their assignments for pure Soluplus and acetone-evaporated Soluplus are also illustrated as follows (Fig. 1b (f and g)): around 3350–3650 cm −1 [intermolecular hydrogen bonded -OH stretching]; 2927 and 2857 cm −1 [asymmetric and symmetric CH stretching]; 1734 (1735) cm −1 [ester carbonyl stretching]; 1635 cm −1 [tertiary amide C=O stretching]; 1477 cm −1 [C-O-C stretching]; 1441 cm −1 [CH 3 bending]; 1240 (1241) and 1106 cm −1 [ester C–O stretching], respectively [ , , ]. There were no any changes in the FTIR spectra for Soluplus with or without acetone treatment.
Effect of Soluplus on the Formation of Solid Dispersion with IMC or SAC
Soluplus has been reported to easily produce the amorphous formation of drugs in the Soluplus solid dispersions [ , ]. Figure 2 indicates the DSC curves and FTIR spectra of Soluplus-IMC and Soluplus-SAC solid dispersions after evaporation via air-drying process. It is evident that no peaks were found in the DSC thermogram between 70 and 250 °C for Soluplus-IMC evaporate (Fig. 2a (a)), indicating that γ-IMC was completely dispersed into the Soluplus-IMC evaporate and formed an amorphous IMC in the solid dispersion. But the DSC curve was gradually declined with temperature beyond 220 °C, due to the degradation of IMC dispersed in the Soluplus-IMC solid dispersions. As compared with the FTIR spectrum of each IMC sample shown in Fig. 1 , two unique characteristic peaks at 1681 and 1593 cm −1 were observed in the FTIR spectral ranges of 1800–1500 cm −1 (Fig. 2b (a)). Within this range, the peaks at 1733 and 1633 cm −1 were attributed to the characteristic peaks of Soluplus, but the peaks at 1681 and 1593 cm −1 were corresponded to that of the unique IR peaks of amorphous IMC formed, respectively [ , , , ]. The appearance of both 1681 and 1593 cm −1 strongly illustrates that Soluplus could cause the amorphous IMC formation in the Soluplus-IMC solid dispersions after solvent evaporation via air-drying process. Fig. 2 DSC curves and FTIR spectra of Soluplus-IMC ( a ) and Soluplus-SAC ( b ) solid dispersions after evaporation via air-drying process
The complete disappearance of SAC melting peak in Soluplus-SAC evaporate could be attributable to the complete miscibility of the SAC in the Soluplus carrier (Fig. 2a (b)). This reveals that SAC also existed in an amorphous state or as a solid solution in the Soluplus-SAC solid dispersion. A broad endothermic peak at 279 °C might be due to the degradation of SAC. However, the FTIR spectrum of Soluplus-SAC solid dispersion after solvent evaporation via air-drying process exhibits a different spectral behavior (Fig. 2b (b)). The peak at 2696 cm −1 assigned to N-H stretching was shifted to 2692 cm −1 or the peak at 1718 cm −1 due to ester C=O stretching for pure SAC disappeared from the FTIR spectrum of Soluplus-SAC solid dispersion. Moreover, the peak at 1734 cm −1 corresponded to ester C=O group of pure Soluplus was shifted to 1726 cm −1 for that of Soluplus-SAC solid dispersion. These spectral changes might be due to the intermolecular hydrogen bonding occurred between the N-H of SAC and the ester C=O of Soluplus in the Soluplus-SAC solid dispersion, which strongly suggesting that the homomeric N-H…O=C dimers in the SAC structure were replaced by heteromeric N-H…O=C in the Soluplus-SAC solid dispersion.
Effect of Soluplus on the Co-crystal Formation Between IMC and SAC After Different Preparation Procedures
The DSC curves and FTIR spectra of IMC-SAC co-crystals prepared by solvent evaporation via air-drying process are shown in Fig. 3(a) . A clear sharp endothermic peak at 185 °C was close to that of the reported melting point at 184 or 184.2 °C of IMC-SAC co-crystal [ , ]. In addition, several new unique IR absorption peaks at 1736, 1714, 1682, 1614, 1317, and 1225 cm −1 were observed in the IR spectrum of IMC-SAC co-crystal. The appearance of these new IR peaks was due to the occurrence of co-crystal formation via intermolecular interaction between IMC and SAC [ , ]. This suggests that the IMC-SAC co-crystal was easily prepared by solvent evaporation via air-drying process. Figure 4 reveals that the best curve-fitted FTIR spectral components and compositions of the air-dried IMC-SAC co-crystal estimated by a curve-fitting algorithm with a Gaussian–Lorenzian function in the 1800–1530 cm −1 region. The best curve-fitted IR spectral components and compositions of IMC-SAC co-crystal prepared by solvent evaporation via air-drying process are illustrated as follows: 1737 cm −1 , 21.5 %; 1714 cm −1 , 25.8 %; 1682 cm −1 , 35.4 %; 1615 cm −1 , 4.9 %; and 1593 cm −1 , 12.4 %. Fig. 3 DSC curves and FTIR spectra of IMC-SAC co-crystals ( a ), Soluplus/previously prepared IMC-SAC co-crystal prepared by procedure I ( b ), and Soluplus/IMC-SAC mixture prepared by procedure II ( c ) via air-drying process Fig. 4 The best curve-fitted IR spectral components and compositions of IMC-SAC co-crystal prepared by air-drying process
When Soluplus and the previously prepared IMC-SAC co-crystal (molar ratio = 1:1) were completely co-dissolved in acetone by ultrasonication (procedure I) and evaporated by air-drying process, the DSC curve and FTIR spectrum of the sample are shown in Fig. 3(b) . Obviously, there was no endothermic peak found in the DSC curve for the sample, implying the formation of amorphous IMC-SAC co-crystal in the Soluplus/IMC-SAC solid dispersion after evaporation via air-drying process. FTIR spectra for this sample were observed, but were partly different from that of the Soluplus-IMC solid dispersion (Fig. 2(a) ). The detailed explanation will be discussed in the next section. On the other hand, another sample prepared by fully co-dissolving Soluplus, IMC, and SAC together into acetone by ultrasonication (procedure II) with 1:1 weight ratio of Soluplus and IMC-SAC (1:1 molar ratio) mixture and then evaporated through air-drying process exhibited different results. The DSC curve and FTIR spectrum for this sample are also illustrated in Fig. 3(c) . It is interesting to note that a sharp endothermic peak at 176 °C was observed in the DSC thermogram of this sample prepared by procedure II via air-drying process. The appearance of the endothermic peak at 176 °C might be due to the transformation from 185 °C for the melting of IMC-SAC co-crystal after solvent co-evaporation with Soluplus. The FTIR spectrum of the sample prepared by procedure II was slightly different from that of the FTIR spectrum of the sample prepared by procedure I. In particular, the IR peak intensity of absorption bands at 1735, 1716, 1682, 1614, 1480, 1325, 1225, and 1177 cm −1 for the air-dried sample prepared by procedure II was more intense than that of the sample prepared by procedure I. As compared with the FTIR spectrum of intact IMC-SAC co-crystal (Fig. 3(a) ), several sharp peaks at 1735, 1716, 1682, and 1614 cm −1 were observed in the FTIR spectrum of the sample prepared by procedure II via air-drying process, suggesting that more crystalline IMC-SAC co-crystals were presented in the air-dried samples. The endothermic peak at 176 °C which appeared in DSC curve could confirm the presence of crystalline IMC-SAC co-crystal in the Soluplus solid dispersions. In this study, we found that the amorphous state of IMC-SAC co-crystal was deposited in the Soluplus/IMC-SAC solid dispersion prepared by procedure I, but the crystal state of IMC-SAC co-crystal existed in the Soluplus/IMC-SAC solid dispersion prepared by procedure II. Although the co-crystal formation between API and co-former can be constructed through several types of interaction, including hydrogen bonding, pi-stacking, and van der Waals forces [ , , , , , , , ], in the present study the driving force for IMC-SAC co-crystal formation in the presence of Soluplus might be attributed to the hydrogen bonding and/or supersaturation for amorphization and nucleation/recrystallization [ , , ].
Physical Stability and Polymorphic Transformation of Soluplus/IMC-SAC Solid Dispersions Under Accelerated Storage Conditions
The physical stability and polymorphic transition of the Soluplus/IMC-SAC dispersions prepared by procedure I or II via air-drying process were investigated under accelerated storage conditions (40 ± 2 °C/75 ± 5 % RH). Figure 5 displays the time-dependent changes of FTIR spectra for the Soluplus/IMC-SAC solid dispersions prepared by procedure I via air-drying process in these accelerated conditions for 72 days. It is evident that the peak intensity of absorption bands at 1714, 1682, and 1614 (1615) cm −1 was gradually enhanced with the increase of time, suggesting that the amorphous IMC-SAC co-crystal was slowly transformed to the crystalline IMC-SAC co-crystal. The same results were also observed in the DSC curves (data not shown), in which the peak intensity of the endothermic peak at 176 °C gradually appeared with the storage of time but almost reached to a plateau after 28 days. Fig. 5 Time-dependent changes of FTIR spectra for the Soluplus/IMC-SAC solid dispersions prepared by procedure I via air-drying process in the course of accelerated storage conditions
Figure 6 shows the time-dependent changes in the curve-fitted peak components and compositions from FTIR spectra of Fig. 5 for Soluplus/IMC-SAC solid dispersions prepared by procedure I via air-drying process. In the spectral region between 1800 and 1530 cm −1 , six peak components near 1736 (1737), 1715 (1714), 1682, 1636 (1637), 1618 (1619), and 1594 (1594) cm −1 were obtained. Here, except the peak at 1636 (1637) cm −1 assigned to Soluplus, the other peaks corresponded to the IMC-SAC co-crystal, as compared with Fig. 4 . Obviously, the composition of the representative FTIR peaks at 1715 (1714) cm −1 attributed to IMC-SAC co-crystal was increased from 8.5 to 12.5 % (28 days) and then approximately reached a plateau by increasing the storage time (Table 1 ). The peak at 1618 (1619) cm −1 also exhibited the similar fashion from 6.8 to 11.1 % and kept the same level. This indicates that the amorphous IMC-SAC co-crystal initially formed in the Soluplus solid dispersion after solvent evaporation was transformed to the crystalline IMC-SAC co-crystal after storage for 28 days at the 40 ± 2 °C/75 ± 5 % RH conditions. The accelerated conditions may exacerbate this polymorphic transformation from amorphous state to crystalline form of IMC-SAC co-crystal. Since the peak at 1682 cm −1 was attributed to the amorphous IMC and/or IMC-SAC co-crystal, resulting in an almost constant composition for this peak in all storage samples (Table 1 ). Fig. 6 Time-dependent changes in the best curve-fitted IR spectral peak components and compositions from FTIR spectra of Fig. 5 for Soluplus/IMC-SAC solid dispersions prepared by procedure I via air-drying process Table 1 Effect of procedures I and II on the time-dependent changes in the best curve-fitted IR spectral peak components and compositions from FTIR spectra of Soluplus/IMC-SAC solid dispersions by solvent evaporation via air-drying process Composition Procedure II Procedure II 1 day 14 days 28 days 42 days 60 days 72 days 1 day 14 days 28 days 42 days 60 days 72 days Components 1736 cm −1 25.8 % 24.6 % 26.0 % 25.0 % 28.0 % 22.6 % 23.7 % 23.0 % 22.8 % 23.9 % 23.7 % 23.3 % 1716 cm −1 8.5 % 10.2 % 12.5 % 12.3 % 11.2 % 12.7 % 17.0 % 17.5 % 18.0 % 17.2 % 17.4 % 17.6 % 1682 cm −1 21.7 % 22.0 % 20.3 % 20.5 % 19.5 % 20.3 % 27.6 % 28.0 % 27.4 % 26.7 % 27.8 % 27.1 % 1636 cm −1 7.8 % 8.9 % 12.0 % 11.3 % 11.2 % 13.7 % 7.3 % 6.9 % 7.1 % 7.2 % 7.8 % 8.0 % 1618 cm -1 6.8 % 6.2 % 11.1 % 9.5 % 10.3 % 10.5 % 6.4 % 6.5 % 6.5 % 6.2 % 6.1 % 6.8 % 1594 cm −1 29.4 % 28.1 % 18.1 % 21.4 % 19.8 % 20.2 % 18.0 % 18.1 % 18.2 % 18.8 % 17.2 % 17.2 %
On the other hand, the Soluplus/IMC-SAC solid dispersion prepared by procedure II via air-drying process exhibited a different behavior from that of the Soluplus/IMC-SAC solid dispersion prepared by procedure I with the storage time. Due to the crystalline IMC-SAC co-crystal which was previously formed in all the Soluplus/IMC-SAC solid dispersions prepared by procedure II, there was no significant alteration in their FTIR spectra, as shown in Fig. 7 . The curve-fitted peak components and compositions from FTIR spectra of the Soluplus/IMC-SAC solid dispersions prepared by procedure II via air-drying process are also listed in Table 1 . Fig. 7 Time-dependent changes of FTIR spectra for the Soluplus/IMC-SAC solid dispersions prepared by procedure II via air-drying process in the course of accelerated storage conditions
These results for the curve-fitted peak components and compositions almost maintained a constant level. Moreover, an endothermic peak was still present at 176 °C for all the DSC curves with similar enthalpies (data not shown), indicating that all the crystalline IMC-SAC co-crystals in the course of accelerated storage conditions showed an unchanged thermal behavior. This strongly implies that the crystalline IMC-SAC co-crystals deposited in the Soluplus solid dispersion could be successfully prepared by co-dissolving Soluplus together with IMC and SAC in acetone by ultrasonication, and then slowly air-dried. The crystalline IMC-SAC co-crystals in the Soluplus solid dispersion exhibited long-term storage stability.
Conclusions
In this work, Soluplus could cause the amorphous IMC or amorphous SAC formation in the Soluplus-IMC or Soluplus-SAC solid dispersion after solvent evaporation via air-drying process, in which Soluplus also interacted with SAC via intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the ester C=O of Soluplus and the N-H of SAC. In addition, Soluplus did not influence the IMC-SAC co-crystal formation by the same air-drying process. However, Soluplus caused the amorphous IMC-SAC co-crystal at initial stage by preparing with procedure I but created the crystalline IMC-SAC co-crystal formation by procedure II. The amorphous state of IMC-SAC co-crystal in Soluplus solid dispersion might transform to the crystalline state after storage at the 40 ± 2 °C/75 ± 5 % RH conditions for 28 days, while the crystalline IMC-SAC co-crystals showed a long-term stability in the Soluplus solid dispersion.
