Introduction
Accurate determination of physeal function is increasingly important in the evaluation of growth disorders, prediction of final height, and assessment of response to therapies such as recombinant human growth hormone [ ]. The physis, where most skeletal growth occurs, is composed of multiple parallel columns of chondrocytes [ ]. Longitudinal bone growth during the growth spurt is mediated by the increase of height of these columns from the proliferation and hypertrophy of the chondrocytes [ , ]. However current methods of evaluating physeal activity are limited. Changes in height are difficult to measure reliably and require observation over 1–2 years [ ]. Evaluation of growth potential is limited based on standards developed more than a half-century ago [ ] that rely on radiographic determination of skeletal maturity and the child’s height. Skeletal maturity is assessed on radiographs of the physes of the hand and wrist, which are only indirectly related to the physes of the lower extremity, where most of the height change occurs. A more accurate method to assess growth and physeal integrity is necessary in children with growth disorders.
Diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) is a promising technique for evaluating physeal activity [ ]. Fiber tracking with DTI depicts the columnar microstructure of the physeal chondrocytes and the newly formed bone in the adjacent few millimeters of the metaphyseal spongiosa [ ]. Previous studies suggest that physeal DTI parameters peak during the ages of fastest growth [ ]. The physeal tracts are longer during the ages of the adolescent growth spurt [ ], and prior to physeal closure they become shorter and disorganized. Adequate validation of physeal DTI, however, requires longitudinal studies to assess whether DTI parameters are predictive of subsequent growth.
The aim of this study is to determine in adolescents the correlation between DTI tractography of the distal femoral physis and adjacent metaphysis and the amount of height change after the examination.
Materials and methods
We compared parameters on DTI studies with subsequent height change in a cohort of children who had an MR examination showing normal physeal cartilage. The focus of the study was on the evaluation of height changes that occurred subsequent to imaging.
Participants’ information
Our hospital institutional review board approved this study, which we performed in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. The requirement for informed consent and assent was waived. We searched our institution’s electronic medical records between January 2013 and October 2014 for boys age 13 years or older and girls age 11 years or older who had a knee MR imaging examination with a diffusion-weighted sequence available. These age cut-offs were chosen to identify participants who were undergoing or had achieved their growth velocity peak [ ]. Children were included only if they had an open physis on conventional MR sequences and had height measurements at the time of the MRI and during subsequent years. We obtained the height measurements from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts available in the electronic medical records [ ]. These anthropometric measurements were performed by nursing staff and primary care physicians as part of the child’s routine follow-up visits. Participants were recruited as part of a previous cohort described in a study published by Bedoya et al. [ ]. From this cohort, we selected children with available longitudinal data that fulfilled the inclusion criteria (Fig. 1 ). Fig. 1 Flow chart shows the evaluation and outcome in the short-term and long-term growth groups. *14 children were included in both groups because they had available anthropometric measurements at 10–14 months after MR and at the growth plateau
Two hundred thirty-nine knee MR studies with diffusion-weighted imaging were available. We excluded cases with conditions that directly or indirectly affect the physis or were technically limited. Exclusion criteria reflect factors that could be related to abnormal structure or function of the physis including extensive bone marrow edema adjacent to the femoral physis ( n =38), acute physeal fracture or bony bridge ( n =9), previous anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction ( n =7), chronic synovial inflammation ( n =6), systemic chronic corticosteroid use ( n =6), neoplasia/chemotherapy ( n =5), femoral dysplasia ( n =3), osteomyelitis/septic arthritis ( n =3), precocious puberty ( n =2), Marfan syndrome ( n =1) and sickle cell disease ( n =1). Three subjects were excluded because of technically inadequate studies.
We then determined whether there were data about height after the DTI that would allow for an assessment of height change after the study during the period from October of 2014 to January of 2018. Forty-seven of the remaining subjects, with a mean age of 14.1 years (range 11.0–17.0 years), had had height measurements. The clinical indications for knee MR imaging were pain ( n =21), trauma ( n =12), locking symptoms ( n =5), possible osteochondritis dissecans ( n =4), patellar dislocation or mal-tracking ( n =3), soft-tissue swelling ( n =1) and follow-up of internal knee derangements ( n =1).
Magnetic resonance imaging parameters
Studies were performed using four 3-tesla (T) systems with a 15-channel knee coil (Verio [ n =29], Skyra [ n =7], Trio [ n =6] and Prisma [ n =5]; Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany). DTI parameters were based on prior studies on physeal DTI and were adapted to the different systems to allow comparability among scanners [ , ]. Sagittal DTI was performed with 20 non-collinear directions using b values of 0 s/mm 2 and 600 s/mm 2 and two averages acquired. DTI was performed with a 5-min and 20-s fat-suppressed single-shot spin-echo echoplanar sequence with repetition time/echo time (TR/TE) 7,100/82 ms, parallel imaging factor of 2, field of view of 256×256 mm, bandwidth of 1,446 Hz/pixel and matrix of 128×128. Frequency-selective fat suppression with spectral adiabatic inversion recovery was used to decrease chemical-shift artifacts. Standard shimming was performed using the Siemens diffusion sequence to reduce magnetic inhomogeneity. Voxel dimensions were 2.0×2.0 mm 2 in plane with 3.0-mm section thickness and no gap between sections. Diffusion-weighted imaging had been incorporated into our routine knee protocol to better evaluate incidental findings in the marrow or soft tissues. The sequence included sufficient directions to perform tractography. Each DTI sequence lasted 5:20 min.
Diffusion tensor imaging segmentation and analysis
For post-processing we used Diffusion Toolkit (version 0.6.2.2, TrackVis, Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA) to reconstruct fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, and tractography [ ]. We used a deterministic fiber tracking algorithm with a minimum FA threshold of 0.15 and a maximum turning angle of 40° between two adjacent voxels. We used standard color-coding for tractographic visualization (blue, superior–inferior; red, left–right; and green, anterior–posterior). Two radiology residents (M.A.B. and J.D., with 2 years of research experience) used TrackVis (version 0.5.2.2) to place a region of interest (ROI) in the distal femoral physis. These two residents were trained and supervised by a pediatric radiologist (D.J.) with more than 25 years of experience in musculoskeletal imaging. TrackVis automatically calculates tract length and volume. ROIs were drawn on the echoplanar images with b value of 0 s/mm 2 to allow for accurate differentiation between cartilage and bone (Fig. 2 ). Color FA maps were also used to identify the most organized section of physeal cartilage. All ROIs were placed using multiple sagittal and coronal sections. ROI size varied based on the femoral dimensions. The mean volume of the ROI of femoral physes was 3.3 cm 3 (range 2.0–5.9 cm 3 ). Tractography was performed starting at the ROI and extending upward to the adjacent metaphysis. Based on the ROI volume, we exported the tract length, volume, ADC and FA values.

Clinical growth assessment
From our initial sample ( n =47), follow-up was classified into short-term and long-term growth assessment.
We defined short-term growth as the height change between the MRI examination (initial height) and height approximately 1 year later. We identified from the clinical records all subjects with available height and weight 10–14 months after the knee MRI. These children were included regardless of whether they had reached their growth cessation ( n =25).
We defined long-term growth as height change between the time of the MRI examination (initial height) and cessation of growth (final height). For final height assessment, we identified all children who reached their growth cessation more than 1 year after imaging, between January 2014 and December 2017 ( n =36; Fig. 1 ). We defined growth cessation as three consecutive height measurements with < 5-mm variation among them located outside the slope “plateau” of the CDC growth chart. This was determined by examining the growth charts in the medical records. The last height value obtained at the growth cessation was considered the final height of the child. Final height change was calculated by subtracting the height at the time of the MRI examination from the height at the growth cessation. Figure 3 shows a flow chart depicting the inclusion process for both groups. Fig. 3 Femoral coronal proton-density ( a , d ) and coronal tractographic ( b , e ) MR images in two children with different height gains — a 14-year-old boy ( a – c ) and a 16-year-old boy ( d – f ). c , f The Centers for Disease Control growth charts of each child show the height gain after the MR was performed. The tracts observed in the femoral physis and adjacent metaphysis are longer and better organized in the child with the largest height gain (image c , 7 cm vs. image f , 3 cm). Both boys had achieved their adult height because a growth plateau ( asterisk ) is clearly observed in their growth charts
Intra- and inter-observer variability
To evaluate intra- and inter-observer variability, we selected randomly 25% of our total sample ( n =12) to repeat our measurements. Femoral physeal ROIs were placed blinded to the initial ROIs. Only tract length and ADC were used for the analysis. We evaluated inter- and intra-rater variability using a two-way mixed intra-class correlation coefficient model with absolute agreement. For the intra-observer variability, one reader repeated the measurements 3 months after the placement of the initial ROIs. Agreement was categorized as follows: less than 0.50, poor; 0.50–0.75, moderate; 0.75–0.95, good; greater than 0.95, excellent [ ].
Statistical analysis
We performed statistical analyses using SPSS version 23 (IBM, Armonk, NY). Non-parametric tests identified differences in DTI parameters between boys and girls. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests identified differences between the anthropometric measurements at the time MRI was performed and the latest growth value. There is an expected association between age and growth, with younger age predicting greater height change. Thus, to examine associations between diffusion parameters and height change, we ran regressions with age entered first and diffusion parameter second (i.e. tract volume, length) and with the height change as the dependent value. To identify the variables that best predicted height change, we ran stepwise regressions with age and all diffusion parameters. A two-tailed P -value <0.05 was considered significant.
Results
We included 47 children, 25 of whom had follow-up data for the first year after imaging, and 36 of whom had information about height change at the end of growth (growth plateau). Only 14 children belonged to both groups.
1-year period height change assessment
Of the 47 children, 25 (10 girls, 15 boys), with a mean age of 14.2 years (range 12.0–16.0 years), had short-term height data to be included in this analysis. The mean time between the MRI and 1-year period height measurement was 12.4 months (range 10.0–14.0 months). The mean initial height, height at 1 year later, and height change were 164.9 cm (150.9–183.5 cm), 169.3 cm (151.0–188.0 cm) and 4.4 cm (0–12.7 cm), respectively. There were no significant gender differences with respect to age, initial height and initial weight ( P >0.05). Boys had greater height change in a 1-year period than girls, with a height change of 5.6 cm (0–12.7 cm) versus 2.5 cm (0–7.2 cm) in girls ( P =0.016).
There were no significant differences between genders in tract length, volume or ADC ( P >0.10 each; Table 1 ). We analyzed the entire population using a regression analysis to evaluate the factors associated with height change. Linear regression showed that age predicted 22% of the variance in height change (R 2 =0.22, P <0.01). After accounting for the variance in height change associated with age, regressions showed that each diffusion parameter predicted additional significant variance in height change (Table 2 ), such that children with longer tract lengths and greater tract volume had a larger height change in a 1-year period. The DTI parameter that predicted the greatest additional variance in height change was tract volume (R 2 change = 0.40, P <0.01), as shown in Fig. 4 . Stepwise regressions showed 61% of the variance is accounted for with just femoral tract volume entered into the model to predict height change (R 2 =0.61, P <0.01). Stepwise regression showed the addition of other variables into the model did not significantly change R 2 .

Final height assessment
Of the 47 children, 36 (20 girls, 16 boys), with a mean age of 14.1 years (11.0–17.0 years), were included in this sub-group. Fourteen children (38.8%) from the 1-year growth group were included here, too, because they fulfilled the criteria for this analysis. The mean initial height, final height and height change in the total sample were 167.8 cm (150.9–183.5 cm), 170.5 cm (151.3–186.0 cm) and 2.6 cm (0–8.0 cm), respectively. The mean time between the initial and final height measurements was 28.9 months (12–66 months). Subjects grew significantly between the MRI examination and the final height assessment ( P <0.01). On the initial assessment at the time of MRI, the boys were older, taller and weighed more in comparison to girls ( P <0.01). There were no significant gender differences in height change (2.4 cm vs. 3.0 cm, P =0.62). There were not significant differences between genders in tract volume, length or ADC (Table 3 ). Table 3 Comparison of age, anthropometric measurements, and diffusion tensor imaging parameters between girls and boys with final height assessment Parameter (mean) Girls ( n =20) Boys ( n =16) P -value a Initial age (years) 13.3 (11.0–15.0) 15.2 (13.0–17.0) <0.001 Initial height (cm) 162.7 (150.9–173.8) 174.3 (162.8–183.5) <0.001 Initial weight (kg) 59.6 (42.5–77.2) 72.3 (57.1–99.0) <0.001 Initial BMI (cm/m 2 ) 22.5 (16.9–28.5) 23.8 (19.1–32.2) 0.29 Final height (cm) 165.1 (151.3–179.8) 177.3 (167.0–185.9) <0.001 Final weight (kg) 64.2 (16.5–89.2) 80.2 (63.7–107.2) <0.001 Final BMI (m 2 ) 24.3 (16.6–33.6) 25.5 (20.1–33.6) 0.42 Time between measurements (months) 28.8 (12.0–66.0) 29.1 (13.0–55.0) 0.29 Height change (cm) 2.4 (0–6.1) 3.00 (0–8.0) 0.62 Tract volume (cm 3 ) 8.7 (3.0–23.1) 12.7 (3.5–28.0) 0.08 Tract length (mm) 6.3 (3.5–11.3) 6.9 (4.0–12.6) 0.67 ADC (mm 2 /s) 0.0012 (0.0008–0.0016) 0.0013 (0.0009–0.0016) 0.32 FA value 0.40 (0.34–0.51) 0.38 (0.30–0.50) 0.15 ADC apparent diffusion coefficient, BMI body mass index, FA fractional anisotropy a Mann-Whitney U test; P -value <0.05 was considered significant (bold values)
There was no significant correlation between age and height change (R 2 =0.07, P =0.09). After accounting for the variance in height change associated with age, regressions showed that each diffusion parameter predicted significant additional variance in height change (Table 2 ), showing that children with longer tract lengths and greater tract volume have a larger final height change. Figure 1 shows a comparison between two children who had different height gains after their respective DTI imaging. The DTI parameter that predicted the greatest additional variance in height change was femoral tract volume (R 2 change = 0.43, P <0.001) as shown in Fig. 4 . Stepwise regression showed that 48% of the variance was accounted for with just femoral tract volume entered into the model to predict height change (R 2 =0.48, P <0.01). Stepwise regression showed that the addition of other variables into the model did not significantly change R 2 .
Reproducibility
The interobserver variability for tract length (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]=0.99, confidence interval [CI]=0.98–0.99, P <0.001) and ADC (ICC 0.92, CI 0.76–0.97, P <0.001) were excellent and good, respectively. The intraobserver variabilities for tract length (ICC 0.99, CI 0.98–0.99, P <0.001) and ADC (ICC 0.98, range 0.95–0.99, P <0.001) were excellent.
Discussion
Our study shows that in a group of children without physeal pathology, DTI parameters and particularly a greater tract volume are associated with more growth in the following year. They are also greater in children who grew more between the DTI study and reaching their final height. The results further support the hypothesis that DTI parameters of the physis and adjacent metaphysis are markers of growth.
Studies in rats, rabbits and cows [ , , ] have shown that the height of the columns of chondrocytes and newly formed bone reflect growth velocity; taller columns are associated with faster growth. Closer to skeletal maturity, the column height decreases but also there is loss of the columnar organization of the physis, and areas of acellularity develop within the cartilage. There are thus fewer chondrocytes organized in columns, so the overall number of physeal columns decreases. Wang et al. [ ], studying rat physes at microscopic resolution, showed that tractography of the growth plate can depict the arrangement and structural characteristics of the physis and adjacent metaphysis. Their study also showed greater tract length with an increasing number of directions and higher b values [ ]. Although we do not have direct histological confirmation in humans, we believe that DTI depicts the parallel diffusion of water between the columns of the physis and newly formed bone in the metaphysis. DTI parameters likely reflect both the height and the relative organization of these columns. The tract length is more related to the height of the columns, whereas tract volume is more associated with both the number and length of columns. These DTI parameters change with age, which might be related to changes in tissue organization rather than in physeal cartilage volume. A previous study showed that changes in volume of the physeal cartilage measured by 3-D MRI are not related to height change longitudinally [ ].
We found that the volume of the ROI sampled in the physis showed large variation. ROI volume of the physis varies according to the cross-sectional area of the distal femoral physis and therefore changes with the knee size. The thickness of the ROI remains relatively constant because the physeal thickness does not change. We had a reproducible, consistent technique to sample the physis and do not believe variation in cross-sectional area of the physis influenced our results.
There are few data on in vivo physeal structure and function in humans except for limited human histological studies [ ] and scintigraphic studies [ ]. The present study, although limited by small numbers, suggests that in humans during early and late adolescence, the volume of columns and the columnar organization of the physis have a greater association with subsequent growth than the height of the columns themselves.
The growth spurt begins earlier in girls and lasts 2.5–3 years [ ]. Velocity of height increase peaks at about 11.5 years in girls and 13.5 years in boys, with the highest total height gain seen in boys [ , ]. Our sample was specifically selected to reflect this population, and our mean follow-up time (28.5 months) probably encompasses the growth spurt period and its aftermath. Tract volume was the best predictor of height gain in both the 1-year height change and the final height sub-analyses. All other DTI parameters contributed similar additional variance to height change. We did not find a significant difference in DTI parameters between boys and girls. However, this could be secondary to our small number of subjects. Bedoya et al. [ ] performed a cross-sectional study of a larger population of which our current cohort is a subset. In the larger cohort, ADC peaked immediately before the growth spurt and tract volume and length were greater in children during the expected age of the growth spurt. Tract volume and length also showed a tendency to be higher in taller children and in boys compared to girls [ ].
The value of our study is that it correlates DTI parameters with subsequent height increase from 10 months to 5 years after the DTI was obtained. In our study, there were two cohorts: one followed to evaluate height change at 1 year after imaging and the other at final growth. The groups were mostly different and had different rates of growth. The two populations were imaged to answer two different questions regarding DTI parameters: (a) How do these parameters correlate with post-imaging growth velocity? and (b) How do they correlate with growth potential? Final validation of a technique to evaluate the activity of the physis is only possible through longitudinal studies with serial imaging. We hypothesize that physeal parameters related to diffusion tensor imaging predict subsequent growth.
A potential application of DTI of the physis is to evaluate dysfunction of the physis, resulting in focal growth disturbance and short stature. Therapy with growth hormone for short stature is costly and potentially dangerous. DTI might be able to identify response to therapy before it is detectable by external or subjective measurements. Similarly, DTI might allow for the establishment of a parameter threshold beyond which no growth is expected. For example, in our series, no child with a tract volume under 10 cc had more than 3 cm of height change. This information is useful to decide whether to discontinue or not administer growth-enhancing medications. More precise determinations of the values to guide therapy require studies with larger samples.
Certain limitations of this retrospective study require consideration. First, the small sample limits our results. Only a fraction of the children who had undergone DTI had subsequent height measurements at 1 year or after cessation of growth. We believe that the children without follow-up were distributed randomly in terms of growth potential. Therefore, we do not believe that the lack of follow-up biased our results. Second, although the subjects had a normal conventional knee MRI, they were not symptom-free. Because of the small sample, we had to include 14 children in both groups, which introduces bias; we believe, however, that it does not render the correlations invalid. Finally, although height follow-up in children tends to follow a standardized procedure, these values might vary among readers throughout the child’s follow-ups and might not be consistent. The main strength of the study is that it validates that DTI parameters are associated with subsequent growth, and it supports the need for a longitudinal study.
Conclusion
Follow-up data of growth at 1 year after DTI evaluation and at skeletal maturity confirm that DTI parameters are associated with the amount of growth. A larger prospective study is necessary for confirmation of this association.
