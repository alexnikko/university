Introduction
Stage of endometrial cancer is determined by surgical staging with exploratory laparotomy, total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy and peritoneal cytology. Complete surgical staging leads to a better prognostic assessment and helps in tailoring the required adjuvant treatment. Most patients of endometrial cancer are diagnosed in stage I (70–80%) which is highly amenable to curative treatment, and the 5-year survival has been shown to be as high as 70–90% [ ]. However, lymphadenectomy has its own morbidity to the tone of up to 31% [ ], particularly lymphedema around 23% [ ], which is a troublesome side effect in patients with early-stage disease who otherwise have a long survival. Also, lymphadenectomy requires surgical expertise and increases the operating time, chances of blood transfusion and perioperative complications such as nerve injury, vessel injury and higher blood loss as shown in two large randomized controlled trials: Benedetti et al. and ASTEC study group [ , ]. Both of these trials have not been able to demonstrate a survival advantage for women who underwent pelvic lymphadenectomy compared to women who did not. Various methods of determining metastases to lymph nodes preoperatively have been analyzed time and again so as to prevent unnecessary lymphadenectomy, but none of the methods have been proven completely dependable.
Radiological imaging is the simplest and most commonly used method for the detection of nodal metastasis. However, conventional imaging methods such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are equally unreliable in detecting lymph node involvement [ ]. The identification of metastatic lymph nodes by both CT and MRI is based on measurements of node size, with a short-axis diameter of greater than 10 mm being the most accepted criterion for the diagnosis of nodal involvement. These morphologic imaging techniques cannot be justified as it is a well-known fact that all the enlarged nodes may not turn out to be malignant and all the smaller nodes might not be free from tumor. These modalities have been known to have a sensitivity and specificity ranging between 48 and 97%, and 54 and 91%, respectively [ ]. In contrast to these morphologic imaging techniques, PET/CT is a not only morphological but a functional method as well, based on the increased glucose metabolism and consequent enhanced 18-FDG uptake of malignant tumors, and is thus expected to be of an added value in detecting nodal metastasis. With this expectation in mind, the present study was conducted to find out the role of 18-FDG PET/CT in detecting lymph node metastasis.
Methods
A retrospective analysis of the records of 50 consecutive patients of endometrial carcinoma who had undergone PET/CT examinations at our institution as a part of preoperative assessment between December 2015 and March 2018 was done. Whole-body PET/CT was done from the level of meatus of the ear to the mid-thigh. Blood glucose levels had been checked in all patients before FDG injection, which ranged between 82 and 133 mg/dl.
PET/CT images had been interpreted by qualified doctors from the department of nuclear medicine at our institute. The reporting of lymph nodes on PET/CT as malignant was based on the presence of focally increased FDG uptake on the PET images at a location that corresponded to the lymph node chains on the CT images irrespective of node size.
All of these patients underwent surgery of total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, pelvic lymphadenectomy with or without para-aortic lymphadenectomy, peritoneal cytology, omentectomy or omental biopsy and/or debulking in the cases that were advanced. Thirty-five patients with clinically uterus confined disease were operated by robot-assisted minimal access method, while laparotomy for staging/debulking had been done in 15 patients. Six patients had apparent advanced disease on PET/CT, and the same was found on operating table and were optimally debulked. In all the 50 patients, pelvic lymph nodes were dissected and 15 patients also underwent para-aortic lymphadenectomy, up to the level of the left renal vein in addition. All the surgical specimens were sent for histopathological evaluation and were analyzed microscopically by two qualified pathologists.
Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were calculated using standard statistical formulas.
Results
A total of 50 patients were included in the present study, out of which 35 patients were operated by robot-assisted minimal access method, while laparotomy for staging/debulking was done in 15 patients. Age range of the patients was 37–80 years, and median age was 58 years. All of them had a PET/CT done as a part of preoperative evaluation. Blood glucose levels had been checked in all patients before FDG injection, which ranged between 82 and 133 mg/dl. Mean blood glucose was 106.4 mg/dl. The histologic subtypes were endometrioid adenocarcinoma in 35 cases, serous carcinoma in 6, carcinosarcoma in 6, clear cell carcinoma in 1, small cell carcinoma in 1 and poorly differentiated carcinoma in 1 (Table 1 ). The FIGO stage was IA in 27 cases, IB in 9, stage II in 2 and IIIC in 12 cases (Table 2 ). The nuclear grade was G1 in 17, G2 in 19 and G3 in 14 cases (Table 3 ).

The time interval between PET/CT and surgery was 2–11 days (mean, 5 days).
On histopathological analysis, a total of 1949 lymph nodes were sampled, out of which 1581 were pelvic and 368 were para-aortic nodes. Overall, 186 (89 pelvic and 97 para-aortic nodes) out of the 1949 lymph nodes were found positive for metastasis on histopathology.
Out of the total 50 patients included in the study, 9 (18%) had FDG-avid lymph nodes on PET-CT. On final histopathological examination, 12(24%) patients were found to have nodal metastasis, while 38 had negative nodes. PET/CT was thus true positive in 8, true negative in 37, false positive in 1 and false negative in 4 patients (Table 4 ). The overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of PET/CT on a patient-based analysis were 66.67% (95% CI 34.89% to 90.08%), 97.4% (95% CI 86.19% to 99.93%), 88.9% (95% CI 52.61% to 98.30%) and 90.24% (95% CI 80.58% to 95.38%), respectively (Table 5 ).

The figures were almost same even on analyzing pelvic and para-aortic nodes separately (Table 5 ). Also, no correlation was found with the tumor grade or stage of the disease when calculated individually for these parameters as well.
The predictive values, specificity, sensitivity and accuracy were all slightly lower for nodes of sub-centimeter size (Fig. 1 ; Table 6 ). The size of the largest positive node and largest among the negative ones on histopathology was considered while calculating the values.

The SUV of the primary uterine lesions was available in 30 patients only. It ranged between 3.8 and 30.7, with a mean value of 14.4. The mean SUVs of primary uterine lesions with and without lymph node metastases were 16.85 (range 3.8–30.7) and 14.08 (range 11–23), respectively ( p = 0.2, student’s t test).
Discussion
The use of morphologic parameters such as size as is done in CT and MRI is known to be of limited accuracy because the nodes less than a centimeter size may be malignant and those more than a centimeter may not always be involved by cancer. FDG PET in contrast combines the morphological criteria with a functional method based on the assessment of enhanced glucose uptake in cancer cells.
In the present study, the overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of PET/CT on a patient-based analysis were 66.67, 97.4, 88.9 and 9.024%, respectively (Table 4 ).
Eight patients were true positive, and out of these 6 (75%) had nodes less than a centimeter size. Those sub-centimeter-sized nodes would have been deemed negative on conventional imaging modalities, while they could be easily picked up on PET/CT.
PET/CT is limited primarily by its low sensitivity (66.67%), more so for the nodes less than 1 cm size. The sensitivity for detecting metastatic nodes smaller than 1 cm was 60% in contrast to the sensitivity of 66.7% for larger nodes. Three (75%) out of the 4 patients whose PET/CT could not pick up the positive node had nodes less than a centimeter size, highlighting the limitation of PET/CT in identifying smaller positive nodes.
Also, out of the 9 cases identified as positive on PET/CT only 1 was false positive yielding an overall patient-based specificity of more than 97%.
Mean SUV index of the primary uterine site was seen to be higher in those who had lymph node metastasis compared to those without nodal metastasis, although the difference was not statistically significant in the present study ( p = 0.2). The association between FDG uptake of the primary tumor and the presence of lymph node metastasis is still controversial.
The present study was compared with many other studies evaluating the role of PET/CT in detecting nodal metastasis, and the results were almost similar. Horowitz et al. [ ] did a prospective study to evaluate the role of PET/CT in detecting pelvic and para-aortic node metastasis in uterine cancer and concluded a sensitivity of 60% and specificity of 98%. The sensitivity and specificity of 50.3% and 86.7.6%, respectively, were found in another study done by Kitajima et al. [ ] to establish the accuracy of FDG PET/CT in detecting pelvic and para-aortic lymph node metastasis in patients with uterine cancer. In another study done by Yamasaki et al. [ ], the sensitivity recorded was only 38.9%.
A meta-analysis of 7 studies including 243 patients of uterine cancer was done by Chang et al. [ ], and a cumulative sensitivity of 63% and specificity of 94.7% were observed. All these studies raised similar concerns regarding the sensitivity of PET/CT and validated the high specificity and predictive values of the same (Table 7 ). Table 7 Comparison of various studies Study Year No. of patients Sensitivity (%) Specificity (%) Horowitz et al. [ ] 2004 20 60 98 Kitajima et al. [ ] 2008 40 50.0 86.7 Yamasaki et al. [ ] 2012 25 38.9 96.3 Chang et al. [ ] A meta-analysis 2012 243 (7 studies) 63 94.7 Kim et al. [ ] 2016 51 70.0 95.4 Present study 2018 50 66.67 97.4
In conclusion, FDG PET/CT though superior to conventional imaging modalities due to its high specificity and negative predictive value is only moderately sensitive in predicting lymph node metastasis preoperatively in patients with endometrial cancer. PET/CT cannot therefore replace lymphadenectomy.
Limitations
It was a retrospective study, and SUV of the primary site of cancer was not available in many cases. Exact size of the nodes less than a centimeter size was also not assessed, and they were roughly described as sub-centimeter on both PET/CT and histopathology.
