Introduction
The silvereye ( Zosterops lateralis ) is a small (10–12.5 cm) bird that inhabits wooded areas, parks, gardens, orchards and vineyards. It is also known as the waxeye, ringeye, silvey, tauhou, blightbird, grape-eater, white-eye, grey-backed or Western silvereye. It is commonly found throughout southeast Australia through to the southwest of Western Australia and the coastal islands (Pizzey and Knight ). These omnivorous birds can also be found in Tasmania, New Zealand, as well as the Pacific Islands.
All silvereyes have a ring of white feathers around the eyes. Their plumage varies according to the subspecies, of which there are eight in Australia. The silvereye in the present study had a yellowish-green back and throat and a grey breast. It most likely belongs to the subspecies gouldi (Western silvereye) (Pizzey and Knight ).
Isospora spp. from passerine birds have been reported worldwide (Duszynski et al. ), and in recent years, several species of Isospora have been characterised (Schrenzel et al. ; Berto et al. ; Berto et al. ; Schoener et al. ; Yang et al. , , ; Yang et al. ). Five species of Isospora from passerine birds have been described in Australia; I. lesouefi from the endangered regent honeyeater ( Xanthomyza phrygia ), which is endemic to southeastern Australia (Morin-Adeline et al. ), and I. anthochaerae from a red wattlebird ( Anthochaera carunculata ), I. streperae from a grey currawong ( Strepera versicolour plumbea ), I. serinuse from a domestic canary (Serinus canaria forma domestica) and I . manorinae from a yellow-throated miner ( Manorina flavigula wayensis ) have been reported in Western Australia (Yang et al. , , ; Yang et al. ). No species of Isospora has yet been characterised from the silvereye. In this study, we characterised a new species of Isospora from a silvereye, both morphologically and molecularly, and propose the name Isospora butcherae n. sp .
Materials and methods
Sample collection
An adult silvereye was admitted to the Kanyana Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre (KWRC) in August 2014 after it was attacked by a domestic cat. The silvereye had numerous puncture wounds to the top of its head and had lost some tail feathers. It was otherwise in good body condition and had a clean vent. The bird was treated with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug as well as antibiotics. A faecal sample (shed after midday) was collected on the day of admittance to KWRC. Microscopy revealed that the sample contained large numbers of unsporulated coccidian oocysts. Treatment was implemented and the bird was released back at the found location 2 weeks later. Faecal samples (shed after midday) from another six individual silvereyes admitted to KWRC were screened for coccidian oocysts over the next few months. None of the six was found to be positive for coccidian oocysts.
Morphological analysis
Microscopic examination (wet mounts and faecal float analysis) was conducted on all samples. Faecal flotation was done using a saturated sodium chloride and 50% sucrose ( w / v ) solution. A portion of faeces was emulsified in a 2% ( w / v ) potassium dichromate solution (K 2 Cr 2 O 7 ) to promote sporulation of unsporulated oocysts. A portion of this solution was then poured into a petri dish to a depth of 1 cm or less and kept at room temperature (20–22 °C) in a dark cupboard. The 100 × oil immersion objective of an Olympus CH-2 binocular microscope, together with an ocular micrometre, was used to observe and measure the sporulated oocysts.
DNA extraction
A 200-mg portion of each faecal sample was used to extract total DNA using a Power Soil DNA Kit (MolBio, Carlsbad, California) with some modifications being made. Each sample was subjected to four freeze/thaw cycles using liquid nitrogen and boiling water. This was to ensure that efficient lysis of the oocysts occurred. The samples were then processed according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
PCR amplification of 18S and 28S ribosomal sequences and the COI gene
Nested PCR for 18S rRNA and 28S rRNA gene loci was conducted as described by Yang et al. ( , ). A partial COI gene sequence (723 bp) was amplified using a nested PCR as previously described by Yang et al. ( ).
Sequence analysis
The secondary amplicons were gel purified with the aid of an “in house” filter tip method as described by Yang et al. . Different PCR run products were sequenced in duplicate, using both forward and reverse primers. Sanger sequencing was performed on the PCR products using an ABI Prism™ Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Finch TV® v1.4.0. ( http://www.geospiza.com/Products/finchtv.shtml ) was used to analyse and edit the sequencing reaction results. The resulting sequence data was compared to available Isospora and other coccidian sequences in GenBank using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). Sequences were then aligned with reference sequences using BioEditor ( http://bioeditor.sdsc.edu/download.shtml ).
Phylogenetic analysis
Isospora spp. at the 18S, 28S and COI loci, and additional isolates from GenBank, were used to construct phylogenetic trees. Parsimony analyses were conducted using MEGA 7 (Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis software, version 6, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona, USA). Neighbour-joining (NJ) and maximum likelihood (ML) analyses were conducted using Tamura-Nei based on model selection using ModelTest in MEGA 7. The reliability of inferred tree topologies was assessed by conducting bootstrap analyses on 1000 replicates.
Line drawing
Inkscape ( http://www.inkscape.org/en/ ) was used to draw the oocyst line drawings.
Results
Description of I. butcherae n. sp.
Sporulated oocysts of Isospora butcherae n. sp. are spherical, 24.2 (23.1–25.2) × 23.3 (22.8–23.9) μm, with a shape index (length/width) of 1.02; and a smooth and bi-layered oocyst wall, 1.2 μm thick (outer layer 0.9 μm, inner 0.3 μm). A polar granule is present, but the oocyst residuum and a micropyle are absent. The sporocysts are ovoid-shaped, 16.1 (15.7–17.3) × 10.5 (15.7–17.3) μm, with a shape index of 1.53. A hemidome-shaped Stieda and a rectangular-shaped substieda body are present. A sporocyst residuum is present and composed of numerous granules of different sizes scattered among the sporozoites. Morphologically, the oocysts from this isolate are different from those of all known valid Isospora spp. (Fig. 1 a, b and Table 1 ).

Phylogenetic analysis of I. butcherae n. sp. at the 18S locus
A 1210-bp sequence of 18S rRNA of I . butcherae n. sp. was aligned with 12 other Isospora spp. sequences from passerine birds; I. gryphoni (AF080613) (Olson et al. ), I. robini (AF080612) (Carreno and Barta, ), I. sp. MS-2003 (JX984668), I. sp. MS-2003 (JX984668 and AY331569), I. sp. MS-2003 (AY331571) (Schrenzel et al. ), I. serinuse (KR477877) (Yang et al. ), I. sp. MAH-2013a (KF648870), I. sp. MAH-2013b (KF648871), and I. manorinae . (KT224379) (Yang et al. ), two Isospora spp. sequences from domestic pigeons ( Isospora sp. Tokyo - AB757860 and AB757862), as well as 17 Eimerian 18S rRNA sequences from GenBank. Toxoplasma gondii was used as the outgroup.
Phylogenetic analysis using distance, parsimony and ML revealed that I. butcherae n . sp . exhibited 99.9, 99.8, 99.7 and 99.5% similarity to I. sp. MAH-2013a (KF648870) from a superb starling ( Lamprotornis superbus ) in Canada, I. sp. MS-2003 (AY33157) from a Southern cape sparrow ( Plocepasser mahali ) in America, I . sp. Tokyo (AB75786) from Japan and I . sp. MS-2003 (AY331569) from a Surinam crested oropendula ( Psarocolius decumanus ) in America (Fig. 2 a). Further analysis of a subgroup of 300 bp long 18S sequences ( n = 11), including I. anthochaerae and the other four Isospora sequences characterised from birds in Western Australia, was conducted. The results were similar to those of the phylogenetic analysis of the longer 18S sequences and revealed that I. butcherae n. sp. exhibited 98.3% similarity to both I. sp. MAH-2013a (KF648870) and I. MS-2003 (AY33171) (Fig. 2 b). Fig. 2 a Evolutionary relationships of I. butcherae n. sp. inferred by distance analysis of 18S rRNA sequences.

Phylogenetic analysis of I. butcherae n. sp. at the 28S locus
A 1367-bp amplicon from I. butcherae n. sp. was obtained at the 28S rRNA locus. Phylogenetic analysis included 31 Isospora sequences from North American passerine birds from a single report by Schrenzel et al. ( ), I. anthochaerae (KF766053) from a red wattlebird (Yang et al. ), I. serinuse . (KR477878) from a domestic canary (Yang et al. ) and I. manorinae from a yellow-throated miner (Yang et al. ). In this analysis, I. butcherae n. sp. sat in a separate clade and exhibited 97.3% similarity with I . sp. MS-2003 from a California towhee (Fig. 3 ). Fig. 3 Evolutionary relationships of I. butcherae n. sp. inferred by distance analysis of 28S rRNA sequences. Percentage support (> 50%) from 1000 pseudoreplicates from distance, ML and parsimony analysis, respectively, is indicated at the left of the support node (‘_’ = not available)
Phylogenetic analysis of I. butcherae n. sp. at the COI locus
A 725-bp amplicon at the COI locus from I . butcherae n. sp. was obtained. Phylogenetic analysis included 18 sequences from avian Isospora available in GenBank and 17 Eimeria COI gene sequences. Toxoplasma gondii (HM771690) was used as the outgroup (Fig. 4 a). I. butcherae n . sp . sat with I. neochmiae in a clade with a similarity of 99.8%. A subset of 215-bp long COI gene sequences, including I. anthochaerae and another 14 isolates from a Eurasian blackcap ( Sylvia atricapilla ) in Germany, were used for further phylogenetic analysis. Similar to the result from the longer COI sequence phylogenetic analysis, I . butcherae n . sp. grouped with I . neochmiae (KT224378), I . sp. MAH-2013b (KF648869), I . sp. ex Apodemus flavicollis (JQ993711) and I. sp . MAH-2013a (KF648868) (Fig. 4 b) and exhibited 100, 100, 100 and 99.1% genetic similarity respectively.

Discussion
In this study, coccidian oocysts were only seen in one of the seven silvereyes screened. A study by Schoener et al. ( ) found Isospora -type oocysts in a single silvereye that was screened as part of a larger study looking at coccidian species in passerines of New Zealand. Sporulated oocysts of I. butcherae n. sp. are morphologically distinct from other characterised Isospora species and did not match any other existing documented Isospora species from Passeriformes ( http://biology.unm.edu/biology/coccidia/passer.html (accessed on 24 Jan. 2017). As shown in Table 1 , the dimensions of the I . butcherae n. sp. oocysts are smaller than that of any other identified Isospora species. The oocyst is spherical in shape with a L/W ratio of 1.01, a polar granule is present, but the oocyst residuum and micropyle are absent. When sporocysts from I . butcherae n. sp. were compared with those of other species, the oocyst and sporocyst sizes were similar to Isospora cardinalis from the northern cardinal ( Curdinulis cardinaiis ) (Levine et al. ). However, there were no polar granules present in the oocysts of I. cardinalis . Unfortunately, there is no morphological data from this Isospora sp. (MAH-2013a and MAH-2013b) from Canada. An unnamed Isospora species was found in silvereyes in New Zealand, with an average oocyst diameter of 27.14 μm (Schoener 2013). This is larger than the oocysts in the present study (24.2 × 23.3 μm). Unfortunately, no molecular data is available for the Isospora sp. from silvereyes in New Zealand.
Molecular characterisation of I. butcherae n . sp . at the 18S and 28S loci demonstrate that it is genetically distinct from other characterised Isospora species. It is most closely related to the Isospora species from the superb starling ( I . sp. MAH-2013) and Southern cape sparrow ( I . sp. MS-2003), whereas at the COI locus, this new species grouped most closely with I. neochmiae (99.8% similarity).
