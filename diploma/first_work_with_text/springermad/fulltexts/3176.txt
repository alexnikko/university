Introduction
Pulmonary formulation is remarkable as a therapeutic medicine for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease because it can reduce the side effect and the dosage amount needed to avoid first-pass metabolism [ ]. The drug tranilast (TL), (N-[3,4-dimethoxycinnamoyl] anthranilic acid) (Fig. S1 (a)), has been launched and shown to exert an antitumor and antimetastatic effect. This drug has been used as an antiallergic and fibrotic medicine in the clinical market that inhibits the degranulation and release of histamine from mast cells [ , ]. Subramaniam et al. [ ] reported that TL might inhibit colony formation in human breast cancer cells. Nevertheless, the dosage amount of TL in oral treatment has been limited by systemic side effects, such as liver discomfort, skin rash, and allergic cystitis [ ]. The development of TL as a treatment for pulmonary administration has been expected. Kawabata et al. reported that dry powder inhaler (DPI) of TL for respiratory therapy was developed using nanocrystalline solid dispersion of TL [ ]. They demonstrated that an inhalable TL formulation may be a promising alternative to oral therapy for the treatment of asthma and other airway inflammatory diseases with sufficient dispersing stability. To develop the inhalable formulation, the safety of used excipients to humans is of considerable significance, although the excipients approved for pulmonary formulation are currently still limited [ ]. The main reason is that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) shows a preference for the usage of commercially launched excipients as well as generally recognized-as-safe (GRAS) ingredients [ ]. On the other hand, the development of new excipients has expanded in recent years. Most excipients of DPI formulation are used to improve the physicochemical properties or aerodynamic properties of the active pharmaceutical ingredients taking safety into account. The DPI, which is often used for pulmonary delivery, has been cited as a representative formulation for pulmonary administration. Most of the DPI commercial products have been launched as carrier-based formulations, where lactose has been commonly used as a carrier for DPI formulations. However, the carrier-based formulations are deeply correlated to quality, source, particle size, and particle size distribution of lactose. Blend uniformity is a critical issue for carrier-based formulations because a typical drug-to-carrier ratio is 1:67.5 [ , ]. To overcome these problems, other formulations for DPI have been developed such as carrier-free DPI formulations, soft aggregation, coated particles, and spray-dried particles [ ]. Recently, Weers and Miller [ ] reported the four key aspects of dry powder formulation design: the nature of the drug substance, the nature of the particle, formulation approaches and excipients, and the integrated drug product. Several excipients sometimes provided the formulator greater control over particle and powder properties, although the use of excipients should be minimized. Moreover, other alternative particle-engineering approaches have been developed, such as the production of composite particles where active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) is embedded in an excipient. We targeted highly branched cyclic dextrin (HBCD), which is a polymer of 900 glucose with an average molecular mass of 160,000 [ ], as a new excipient agent for DPI. HBCD is composed of some glucose molecules with cyclic cluster structures, as suggested by its name (Fig. S1 (b)). The chemical structure of glucose is presented in Fig. S1 (c). HBCD was identified as a potential additive for DPI because of the enhancement of the dissolution profile of hydrophobic drugs [ ]. We have tried to develop this additive as excipient matrix for DPI formulations embedded API into excipients, because HBCD is safe, both for oral consumption and inhalation, and provides improved drug solubility and absorption because of its composite structure, with affinity for both hydrophilic and hydrophobic substances. Actually, the previous paper reported that the advantages of HBCD could be developed as an attractive candidate excipient in DPI formulations by comparing to the conventional carrier formulations [ ].
Another more challenging aspect in the development of DPI is that the pulmonary airway has complex geometric structures and significant individual differences. Despite the use of in vitro measurements using the Andersen cascade impactor, it is unclear which positions in the airway the DPI particles accurately deposit. Many numerical investigations have been performed to investigate the aerosol deposition in an airway [ , , , ]. Kleinstreuer et al. [ ] investigated the gravitational effect on microparticle deposition, indicating that particle sedimentation may change deposition patterns in human airways, especially under slow inhalation conditions. Longest and Hindle [ ] investigated the hygroscopic growth of a combination drug and submicrometer excipient aerosols for respiratory drug delivery using in vitro experiments and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. Thus, CFD simulations make it possible to predict particle behavior in the airways; therefore, it may be possible to design pulmonary particles that can efficiently deliver to the lungs. However, few studies have approached the development of DPI formulation in an airway using both simulation and experimentation [ ].
In this study, we developed inhalable TL dry powders using HBCD as an excipient matrix. The aim of the present study was to prepare composite particles of TL and HBCD to enhance the aerodynamic properties. The prepared particles were characterized in terms of their morphology, particle size distribution, crystallinity, and aerodynamic properties. We theoretically investigated the behavior and the deposition position of particles by CFD simulation to design the particle properties such as particle size, shape, and density for enhancing the efficiency of pulmonary delivery in the future.
Materials and Methods
Materials
TL was supplied by Towa Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). HBCD was purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). All other chemicals and solvents were of reagent grade.
Preparation of Composite Particles via Spray-Drying
The fine particles of TL with HBCD for DPI were prepared by spray-drying. The ethanolic TL solution was slowly added to the aqueous HBCD solution using a peristaltic pump (MP-2000, Eyela, Tokyo, Japan) at a flow rate of 2.0 mL/min at room temperature to prepare the spray-dried particles (SDPs) of TL with HBCD, where flow rate was validated from 5.0 to 1.0 mL/min.
The ratio of ethanol to water was varied as a total 300 mL of water and ethanol. The loading rate of TL/HBCD was set at 1/10 as weight volume. The prepared suspensions were fed to a spray dryer (B-290, Nihon Büchi K.K., Tokyo, Japan) at a rate of 5.5 mL/min which was optimized from 2.0 mL/min to 6.0 mL at 0.5 mL/min. The inlet and outlet temperatures of the drying chamber were maintained at 130 and 80 °C, respectively. Air or N 2 gas at a flow rate of 10 L/min was used for drying below or above a 30% ethanol concentration, respectively. All SDPs were dried in a desiccator with blue silica gel under reduced pressure before evaluating the physiochemical properties.
Preparation of Metastable TL Particles via Evaporation
For the preparation of metastable TL particles by evaporation, 33 mg of TL crystals was dissolved in an ethanol/water solution (3:7 v / v ) in a round-bottom flask. The solvent of ethanol and water was removed by rotary evaporation (Rotavapor R-3, Nihon Büchi K.K.) to obtain the evaporated TL particles under reduced pressure at 50 °C.
Scanning Electron Microscopy
The appearance of each sample was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (VE-7800, Keyence, Osaka, Japan). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were taken randomly at magnifications ranging from ×1000 to ×2000 and an acceleration voltage that ranged from 5 to 20 keV. Prior to examination, the samples were mounted onto metal stubs and sputtered with a thin layer of gold under vacuum (E-1045, Hitachi Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).
Powder X-ray Diffraction
Each sample was evaluated using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) with a Rigaku Miniflex powder X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). The PXRD measurements were performed under the following conditions: target, Cu; voltage 30 keV; current 15 mA; and scanning rate 4°/min over a 2 θ range of 3–35°.
Thermal Analysis by Differential Scanning Calorimetry
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (Diamond, PerkinElmer, USA) was used to measure the thermal behavior of the untreated drugs and spray-dried samples. In the DSC analysis, approximately 3–5 mg of sample powder was placed in an aluminum close-pan system under a constant purge of nitrogen at 40 mL/min. Each sample was analyzed over 50–230 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. Prior to DSC analysis, the system was calibrated using indium as a reference standard (approx. 5 mg, 99.999% pure, onset at 156.6 °C).
Measurement of the Solid-State Fluorescence Spectra of TL
The fluorescence spectra of the samples including TL were measured by a Shimadzu RF-5300PC spectro-fluoro-photometer (Shimadzu Co., Ltd., Kyoto, Japan). The powder sample was placed in the solid sample holder attached to the instrument at room temperature. The excitation wavelength was fixed at 350.0 nm. The widths of the excitation and emission slits were fixed at 2 and 5 nm, respectively.
Powder Density
The powder density of each sample can be characterized using bulk and true densities. The bulk density is measured by placing 50 mg of a powder sample into a 5-mL cylinder before any tapping. The true density was measured by helium pycnometry (Accupyc 1340 Gas Pycnometer, Micromeritics, Shimadzu). The temperature was maintained at room temperature during each analysis. Each sample was run 10 times.
Particle Size Analysis of Powders
The particle sizes were measured using a laser diffraction-based apparatus (MT3300EXII, Nikkiso, Osaka, Japan, measurement range 0.02–2000 μm) equipped with a dry dispersion system. A pressure of 0.20 MPa and intervals of 5 ms were used during the measurements. The volume median diameter ( D 50 ) was measured to calculate the aerodynamic diameter.
Drug Content
The drug contents of TL were determined by an absolute calibration curve method using HPLC (SPD-10A, Shimadzu Co., Ltd., Kyoto, Japan) under the following conditions: pump, LC-10AD; detector, SPD-10A; column, COSMOSIL 5C18-MS-II (4.6 mm φ × 150 mm; Nacalai Tesque, Inc.); column temperature, 40 °C; wavelength, 254 nm; injection volume, 10 μL; and flow rate, 1.0 mL/min. Mobile phase was 0.1 wt% phosphoric acid/acetonitrile (30/70). The content uniformity of used formulations was within 85–115% at triplicated experiments.
In Vitro Aerodynamic Characterization
The ability to control the aerodynamic properties of DPI is of key importance for successful product development. The aerodynamic performance of DPI was assessed according to United States Pharmacopeia (USP) Chapter <601> specifications using an AN-200 system (Tokyo Dylec Corp., Tokyo, Japan) consisting of an eight-stage Andersen cascade impactor. The particles for DPIs were filled into a hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) capsule (Qualicaps, Nara, Japan), and then the capsule was installed in a Jethaler dual chamber (Hitachi Automotive Systems, Ltd., Gunma, Japan) of powder inhaler device. The composite DPI particles were loaded into HPMC capsules in quantities of 10 mg, and they were dispersed via the device with an inspiration rate of 28.3 L/min for the treatment of asthma. The TL was collected by washing the capsule, device, and any parts of the Andersen cascade impactor with 100% ethanol at all stages (0–7 stages). The amount of TL in each solution was determined in the “ Drug Content ” section.
Computational Analysis of Particle Behavior or Deposition in an Airway
To evaluate the particle behavior or deposition in an airway using CFD simulations, a pulmonary model is used, as shown in Fig. 1 . As many researchers previously reported [ , , ], the geometry of an actual respiratory system is complex because of the rough surfaces and moving mucus layers. This pulmonary model was created based on the computed tomography (CT) scan images of a subject’s lung tract, which was supplied by CD-adapco Co., Ltd. (Kanagawa, Japan). A geometric airway was divided into five components as shown in Fig. 1 (inlet, stage 0–1, stage 2, stage 3, and stages 4–7) because few dry powder particles reach the deeper lungs. The bronchi model suggested by Weibel [ ] was frequently used for simulating the particle behavior or deposition in the pulmonary airway. Each portion is separated by the bifurcation of the bronchial tubes, as shown in Fig. 1 [ , ]. The cell number of this model was 1,725,821, where this airway model was meshed entirely with hexagonal control volumes, especially with increased mesh density near the walls [ ]. Kleinstreuer et al. [ ] introduced the alternation of a pulmonary model from CT scan images in detail. The particle behavior or deposition was conducted by CFD simulations. The CFD package STAR-CCM+ (CD-adapco Co., Ltd., Kanagawa, Japan) was used to solve the governing equations of mass and momentum. All terms in the governing equations for mass and momentum were discretized to be at least second-order accurate using either second-order upwind or central difference approximations. Further details for the CFD simulations including the governing equations and solution procedure are described in other papers [ , , ]. The CFD approach consists of solving the continuity and momentum equations in each cell of a discretized computational mass conservation equation or continuity equation. Assuming that the air flow is incompressible, viscous, isothermal, and a Newtonian fluid with constant properties, the steady-state three-dimensional mass conservation equation and time-averaged Navier-Stokes equations for momentum are described as follows [ , ]: $$ \nabla \cdot u=0 $$ (1) $$ \frac{\partial \left({\rho}_{\mathrm{f}} u\right)}{\partial t}+\nabla \cdotp \left({\uprho}_{\mathrm{f}} u u\right)=-\nabla P+\nabla \tau +{\rho}_{\mathrm{f}} g+ F $$ (2) Fig. 1 Airway model calculated by CFD simulation
where u , ρ f , P , τ , t , F , and g are the fluid velocity, fluid density, pressure, fluid viscous stress tensor, time, eternal body force, and gravitational acceleration. The k -ε model turbulence fluid calculation was used to solve the momentum conservation equations [ ]. The Euler-Lagrange equations were implemented to track the particle transportation or deposition in the airways as follows [ ]:
$$ \frac{\mathrm{d}{u}_{\mathrm{p}}}{\mathrm{d} t}={F}_{\mathrm{D}}\left( u-{u}_{\mathrm{p}}\right)+ g\left(1-\frac{\rho}{\rho_{\mathrm{P}}}\right)+{F}_{\mathrm{B}}+ F $$ (3)
where u p is the velocity of the particle, and the terms on the right-hand side represent the drag force per unit particle mass, the gravitational acceleration per unit mass, the Brownian forces, and eternal body force, respectively [ ]. Particle motion is determined by the integration of Euler-Lagrange equations. Particles are typically released from an inlet-expressing mouth. Particles can be released according to a time-dependent source function. In this study, particle collision is ignored because the particle concentration is diluted. Furthermore, the effects of Brownian motion and turbulent dispersion were not included because the simulation incorporates particles greater than 1 μm and under laminar flow, as suggested by Holbrook and Longest [ ]. The particle properties obtained from the experimental results were applied. The other parameters used in the simulation are summarized in Table 1 , where turbulence strength is obtained from previously validated simulations [ ]. Table 1 Numerical parameters used in the simulation Parameters Value Air density [kg/m 3 ] 1.18 Gas viscosity [Pa s] 1.82 × 10 −5 Turbulence strength [–] 0.1 Respiration intensity [m/s] 19.0 Total calculation time [s] 0.5
Results and Discussion
Physicochemical Properties
Spray-drying is a commonly used technique for preparing DPI formulations [ ], as the principal advantages of spray-drying regarding DPIs are the ability to control various parameters such as solvent composition and solute concentration. Figure 2 depicts SEM images of untreated TL crystals, SDPs of HBCD, and composite particles of TL with HBCD that were spray-dried at different ethanol concentrations. The untreated TL crystals showed irregularly shaped particles, as shown in Fig. 2 a. The composite particles of TL with HBCD were spherical and needle-shaped particles, while SDPs of HBCD were spherical particles with corrugated surface. The needle-like particles were thought to be precipitated TL crystals during spray-drying. The particle sizes of those powders were characterized by a laser diffraction size analyzer as shown in Table 2 . According to the laser diffraction data, the mean particle size of untreated TL crystals is larger than that of SDPs of TL with HBCD. The composite particles spray-dried at different ethanol concentrations exhibited a narrow particle size distribution. Table 2 shows the aerodynamic diameter of SDPs prepared at different ethanol concentrations using the following equation: $$ {D}_{\mathrm{ae}}= D\sqrt{\frac{\rho_{\mathrm{p}}}{\rho_0 x}} $$ (4) Fig. 2 SEM images of a untreated tranilast, b untreated HBCD, c SDPs of TL/HBCD (1/10) prepared at an ethanol ratio of 20%, d SDPs of TL/HBCD (1/10) prepared at an ethanol ratio of 30%, e SDPs of TL/HBCD (1/10) prepared at an ethanol ratio of 35%, and f SDPs of TL/HBCD (1/10) prepared at an ethanol ratio of 40% Table 2 Bulk density, true density, mean particle diameter, and aerodynamic diameter of untreated TL and SDPs prepared at different ethanol concentrations ( n = 3) Bulk density (g/cm 3 ) True density (g/cm 3 ) Mean particle diameter (μm) Aerodynamic diameter (μm) Untreated tranilast 0.283 (±0.009) – 41.69 – SDPs of 20% ethanol 0.021 (±0.001) 1.551 (±0.016) 4.16 5.19 SDPs of 30% ethanol 0.016 (±0.001) 1.516 (±0.025) 6.21 7.64 SDPs of 35% ethanol 0.032 (±0.002) 1.499 (±0.001) 4.00 4.90 SDPs of 40% ethanol 0.089 (±0.012) 1.443 (±0.006) 1.55 1.86
where D ae is the aerodynamic diameter, D is the volume median diameter, 휌 p is the particle density, 휌 0 is 1 g/cm 3 , and x is the shape factor that is unitary in the case of spherical particles. The aerodynamic diameter of SDPs prepared at a 40% ethanol concentration is obviously the smallest among them. The increase in ethanol concentration might cause the decrease in surface tension of the droplet releasing from the spray nozzle, and consequently, the smaller particles are generated due to the smaller droplet size [ ]. Moreover, the evaporation rate in a droplet is strongly correlated with the size of SDPs, where ethanol evaporates faster than water during spray-drying. However, the relationship between evaporation and particle size from solution during spray-drying has not been completely elucidated. The average particle size of HBCD gradually increased with the ethanol concentration up to 35% in the mixed ethanol-water solutions. The suspendability of HBCD in a mixed solution was positively correlated with the average particle size of SDPs of drugs with HBCD. The increase in the ethanol concentration induces the aggregation of HBCD in mixed solutions, leading to suspended colloids of HBCD and TL. The suspendability of HBCD in mixed solution results in SPDs with smaller particle size.
Crystal properties were characterized by PXRD and DSC. Figure 3 shows the PXRD patterns for the untreated TL, HBCD, the physical mixtures (PMs), and SDPs of TL/HBCD. The sharp peaks associated with pure TL are characteristic of its crystalline form. Many studies on the polymorphic forms of TL, which has five polymorphic forms, were conducted. Several anhydrous and hydrated forms of TL have been previously encountered [ ]. Vogt et al. [ ] characterized five polymorphic forms of TL by thermal diffractometric and spectroscopic techniques. The diffractogram reported by Kawashima et al. [ ] for a form visually matches with the TL data shown here. However, pure HBCD exhibits a typical broad amorphous band. PMs of TL/HBCD had characteristic crystalline peaks of TL, as observed in Fig. 3 . The samples of SDPs show different diffraction patterns compared to those in TL crystals of form I reported by Vogt et al. [ ]. The crystal form of untreated TL corresponds to that of form I. Some of the PXRD diffractions of this sample may include identical diffraction peaks of form II. The samples spray-dried at different ethanol concentrations may be considered to be a mixture of form I and form II. It is, however, difficult to detect the precise crystal form using only PXRD evaluations because the TL content in SDPs was below 10 wt%, even though a portion of TL in the SDPs transitions from form I to form II. The evaluation of the crystal properties was also performed based on the thermal behavior of the different samples using DSC. DSC thermograms of the samples are presented in Fig. 4 . As expected from the PXRD, pure TL and PMs of TL/HBCD showed a sharp endothermic peak at 213 °C for the melting of the most stable form I, while the melting peak of SDPs of TL/HBCD shifted to lower temperatures, where the melting peaks of the metastable form II were very similar at 211.1 °C. As described above, the PXRD diffraction patterns for this sample may include identical diffraction peaks of form II. The polymorphic transformations on the DSC curve may indicate the existence of another form, although there was no firm evidence.

Further confirmation of crystal properties was achieved by the evaluation of the fluorescence spectroscopy using a fluorescence spectrometer. Figure 5 shows the differences in the solid-state fluorescence spectra among untreated TL crystals, evaporated samples prepared with 30% ethanol, PMs of TL/HBCD, and SDPs of TL/HBCD prepared at varying ethanol concentrations. The emission peak of the TL crystals was observed at 479 nm. The fluorescence spectrum of TL in the PMs of TL/HBCD was almost identical to that of the TL crystals. The emission peaks of the SDPs of TL/HBCD that did not have a 30% ethanol concentration were observed from 474 to 478 nm, corresponding to that of the TL crystals and the PMs. However, the emission peak of TL in the SDPs prepared with a 30% ethanol concentration was shifted to a lower wavelength of 455 nm. This peak shift may indicate the transformation to a different crystalline form, as the emission peak of evaporated TL was observed at 442 nm, where the experimental PXRD and DSC results of evaporated TL indicated form II of TL (Figs. S2 and S3 ). The difference between the crystalline form of TL prepared at 30% ethanol concentration and others could be because of the solubility of TL in the ethanol/water solution, where TL is easily dissolved in ethanol while it is hard to dissolve in water. TL begins dissolving in the ethanol/water solution as the ethanol concentration is increased. The metastable TL crystals may be precipitated by spray-drying with 30% ethanol because TL crystals in the ethanol/water solution exist in a metastable zone that denotes supersaturated solutions [ ]. Our previous results suggested that hydrophobic drugs could be precipitated on HBCD and relatively hydrophilic drugs could be incorporated into HBCD in the process of crystallization during spray-drying [ , ]. Namely, the heterogeneous nucleation of TL as a hydrophobic drug might occur on HBCD. Fig. 5 Solid-state fluorescence emission spectra of TL
Aerodynamic Behavior
The aerodynamic behavior of each formulation was evaluated by an Andersen cascade impactor at a flow rate of 28.3 L/min. Figure 6 shows the in vitro deposition pattern of each formulation. The emitted dose (ED) was determined as the difference between the initial mass of powder loaded into the capsules and the remaining mass of powder in the capsules. The ED was calculated using the following equation [ ]: $$ \mathrm{Emitted}\;\mathrm{dose}\left[\%\right]=\frac{\mathrm{Emitted}\;\mathrm{dose}}{\mathrm{Total}\;\mathrm{dose}}\times 100 $$ (5) Fig. 6 Andersen cascade impactor deposition profile of TL at a flow rate of 28.3 L/min for 10 s
The fine particle dose (FPD) was defined as the mass of drug particles deposited at stage 2 and lower. The fine particle fraction (FPF) was calculated as the ratio of FPD to total loaded dose as follows [ ]: $$ \mathrm{Fine}\;\mathrm{particle}\;\mathrm{fraction}\;\left[\%\right]=\frac{\mathrm{Fine}\;\mathrm{particle}\;\mathrm{dose}}{\mathrm{Emitted}\;\mathrm{dose}}\times 100 $$ (6)
The ED and FPF of untreated TL were 57.7 and 11.4%, respectively (Table 3 ). The ED and FPF of all SDPs of TL/HBCD prepared at any ethanol concentration were clearly improved compared to the untreated TL crystals. There are clear differences in the trends among the SDPs of TL/HBCD. Each FPF of SDPs prepared at 30 and 40% ethanol concentrations was 24.2 and 32.7%, respectively. Specifically, an FPF of SDPs prepared at 30% ethanol concentration was lower than that of SDPs prepared at other ethanol concentrations. In general, the deposition of DPI in the airways is strongly correlated with a number of parameters that include mass median aerodynamic diameters, density, and shape. As described above, the TL crystalline form in the SDPs prepared at 30% ethanol concentration may be different from that in the SDPs prepared at other ethanol concentrations. The changes in the particle properties caused by the difference in crystal form affect the deposition of DPI in the airways. The estimated aerodynamic diameter of the SDPs prepared at 30% ethanol concentration was the largest, 7.64 μm above 5 μm. However, the estimated aerodynamic diameter of SDPs prepared at 40% ethanol concentration was 1.86 μm. This difference affects the FPF of the SDPs in the in vitro deposition pattern produced by the Andersen cascade impactor. However, the actual particle behavior or deposition in the airways has not been completely elucidated.

CFD Comparison of Formulations
The difference in TL crystal forms in SDPs may affect the deposition of DPI in the airways from the viewpoint of in vitro aerodynamic behavior, as described above. CFD simulations were performed to predict more realistic particle behavior or deposition in the airways. The particle behavior and deposition in the airways were compared between the SDPs prepared with 30% ethanol and those with 40% ethanol by CFD simulations because of a noticeable difference in the FPF values of the two. Figure 7 shows the regions of particle deposition in the airways when particles are introduced from the inlet-expressing mouth. The particle properties obtained from the experimental results summarized in Table 2 were applied to the CFD simulations. Here, 5260 6.21-μm particles or 177,700 1.55-μm particles were released from the mouth at every given time interval for 0.1 s [ ]. More SDPs prepared at 40% ethanol concentration naturally reach the deep lungs than those of the 30% ethanol concentration because the aerodynamic diameter of the 40% ethanol concentration was smaller than that of the 30% ethanol concentration, as shown in Table 2 . This trend of results obtained by CFD analysis is consistent with experimental results. The CFD simulations revealed that most particles prepared with 30% ethanol deposit on the throat part before the bronchial region. Particle deposition patterns of each particle in the throat region are given in Fig. 8 . Many of the 6.21-μm SDPs deposited in the throat, while most of the 1.55-μm SDPs passed through the throat, as shown in Fig. 8 . The simulation results indicate that most of the particles moved in the direction of the gravitational force. In other words, few particles moved horizontally. From the magnitude of airflow velocity, the horizontal airflow is weaker than the gravitational airflow. Therefore, the smaller particles move in a horizontal direction, unlike the larger particles, because they are influenced by airflow. This result indicates that the particles larger than 6 μm deposited in the oral cavity or the throat region, as described in previous reports [ , ]. The effect expected from the pharmacological action was not produced because the particles larger than 6 μm mostly deposited in the oral cavity or the throat region [ ]. Fig. 7 Deposition location for steady-state inhalation calculated by CFD simulation. a Calculated results used in particle properties prepared at an ethanol ratio of 40%. b Calculated results used in particle properties prepared at an ethanol ratio of 30% Fig. 8 Particle deposition in the throat region. a Calculated results used in particle properties prepared at an ethanol ratio of 40%. b Calculated results used in particle properties prepared at an ethanol ratio of 30%
Figure 9 shows the ratio of particle deposition in each bronchial region when each particle is adopted in this simulation. When the particle size became smaller, the arrival factor of particles to regions deeper within the lung was highly improved, as well as the experimental results. As shown in Fig. 7 , most of the particles prepared with 30% ethanol and that were 6.21 μm above 6 μm deposited in the stage 0–1 region. However, SDP particles prepared with 40% ethanol and that were 1.55 μm reached deeper lung positions, ranging from stages 2 to 7. This trend is similar to the experimental results, and the present simulation results reveal that particle deposition occurs in all of the bronchi. Further investigation in conjunction with CFD simulation and experimentation is required for the efficient development of DPIs.

Conclusions
Development of a TL dry powder for inhalation using HBCD as an excipient was performed using spray-drying. SDPs of TL/HBCD showed characteristic diffraction peaks that differed from the untreated TL crystal and from the polymorphic transition in the X-ray diffraction. The polymorphic transition of the TL was observed from a DSC peak and a fluorescence spectrum. The TL crystalline form in the SDPs prepared with a 30% ethanol concentration may be different from those SDPs prepared at other ethanol concentrations. The change in the particle properties, such as the aerodynamic diameter, is caused by a difference in the crystal form and affects the behavior and deposition of DPI in the airways. The FPF of SDPs prepared with 30% ethanol was lower than that of SDPs prepared at other ethanol ratios. The CFD results indicated that the particle deposition and behavior in the airways were varied because of the difference in the particle properties of SDPs prepared at 30 and 40% ethanol concentrations. Future work is required to predict particle deposition or behavior using detailed experimental data with more realistic airway models. The combination of experimental and simulation approaches is expected to improve the ability to obtain maximum lung delivery as well as targeting the site of deposition in an airway.
