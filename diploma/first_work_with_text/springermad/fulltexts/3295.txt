INTRODUCTION
Diclofenac is an aryl alkanoic group of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) ( , ). It is available as diclofenac sodium, diclofenac diethylamine and diclofenac epolamine ( ). Diclofenac sodium is used in the management of pain associated with various musculoskeletal disorders ( ). The drug is known to relieve the pain by interfering with the prostaglandin synthesis by inhibiting both cyclooxygenase-1(COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2(COX-2) enzymes ( ). However, diclofenac is known to undergo extensive first-pass metabolism limiting the oral bioavailability to 50–60%. Therefore, the drug demands frequent oral administration at a dose of 150 mg a day in three divided doses ( ). Due to non-selective COX inhibition and frequent dosing, oral diclofenac has been associated with severe gastrointestinal side effects including gastrointestinal perforations, ulcers and bleeding that can limit its long-term use.
To avoid the first pass effects, gastrointestinal irritation and metabolic degradation associated with oral administration, the delivery of the drug through the skin has been selected as an effective and targeted therapy. Drug delivery through the skin is a promising concept because the skin is easy to access and has a large surface area with vast exposure to circulatory and lymphatic networks ( ). Cordero et al . ( , ) reported the topical efficiency ranking of diclofenac and other NSAIDs based on in vitro skin permeation data and IC50 values of COX II inhibition. Diclofenac has been proposed as a good candidate for topical delivery compared with many other NSAIDs. Clinical evidences suggest that the topical use of NSAIDs is safe and as efficacious as oral administration in the treatment of rheumatic diseases ( ). Unfortunately, diclofenac is not easily absorbed through transdermal application and many strategies have been proposed to overcome the low permeability of the drug through the skin. The penetration of the therapeutic amount of drug into underlying inflamed tissues such as muscle, tendon sheath, synovium and synovial fluids of superficial joints is a big challenge.
Different formulations have been investigated for the dermal delivery of diclofenac. Formulations with liposomes ( , ), hydrogenated soybean phospholipid ( , , ), ultra-deformable liposomes ( ), (Transfersomes TM), bicelles ( ), penetration enhancer vesicles ( ), microemulsions ( , , ) and solid lipid nanoparticles ( ) have been investigated by many researchers. Cyclodextrins ( ), sugar surfactants ( ) and different penetration enhancers ( ) have been studied. For enhancing the permeability of diclofenac through the skin, different techniques have also been introduced ( , , ). Research efforts largely based on passive approaches and penetration enhancers are emphasized in commercial diclofenac preparations.
There are various types of formulation available for topical drug delivery from solids to semisolid and liquid preparations but topical gel formulations provide a suitable delivery system for drugs. Gel has several favorable properties such as being smooth, elegant, thixotropic, non-greasy, easily spreadable and emollient and gives better drug release or diffusion than other semisolid formulations.
Percutaneous absorption of drug from topical formulations involves the diffusion and permeation of the drug through the skin to reach the target tissue. The diffusion of the drug from topical preparations depends on the physicochemical properties of the vehicle and the drug employed. To enhance drug diffusion and skin permeation, a suitable vehicle or chemical enhancer can also be used. The objective of the present study was to develop and manufacture generic diclofenac sodium gel 1% w/w using quality by design (QbD) principles and ensuing pharmaceutical and therapeutic equivalency with the reference listed formulation.
US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) is insisting pharmaceutical companies to adopt the risk-based approach and QbD principles in product development and manufacturing. FDA’s emphasis on QbD begins with the recognition that increased testing does not necessarily improve product quality. Quality must be built into the product. Over the years, pharmaceutical QbD has evolved with the issuance of ICH Q8 (R2) (Pharmaceutical Development), ICH Q9 (Quality Risk Management) and ICH Q10 (Pharmaceutical Quality System) ( , , ).
The QbD-based approach of formulation development starts with setting the quality target product profile (QTPP) and identifying critical quality attributes (CQAs). The critical material attributes (CMAs) and critical process parameters (CPPs) will be evaluated to identify their impact on the CQAs of formulation. For risk evaluation and optimization, design of experiment (DoE) can be used. To understand the impact of factors on responses, a number of experiments should be carried out by changing the level of factors. From the data, the optimum and robust region can be identified.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
Diclofenac sodium was procured from Unique Chemicals (India). Carbomer homopolymer Type C (carbopol 980, later mentioned as carbopol in the text) from Lubrizol (Advanced materials Europe BVBA, 2260 Westerlo, Belgium), polyoxyl 20 cetostearyl ether (kolliphor CS20, later mentioned as kolliphor in the text) and cocoyl caprylocaprate from BASF (Duesseldorf, Germany) were used. Propylene glycol and strong ammonia solution were procured from Avantor (PBG, USA). Isopropyl alcohol was purchased from Runa Chemicals (Mumbai, India). Mineral oil from Sonneborne LLC (Petrolia PA 16050) was used. FI Perfume Lavender was procured from Floral Aromatics India Pvt. Ltd (India). All other chemicals employed were of analytical grade. Voltaren® Gel (diclofenac sodium topical gel 1%) manufactured by Novartis Consumer Health, Inc., Parsippany, NJ 07054-0622 was used as reference formulation.
Formulation Development Using QbD Approach
Identification of Critical Quality Attributes
The development and optimization of the diclofenac gel were carried out in accordance with QbD approaches. The study was initiated with characterization of the reference formulation, Voltaren® Gel. QTPP was set based on the physicochemical parameters of the reference formulation. Based on the literatures and the scientific knowledge assay, viscosity and in vitro diffusion were identified as CQAs to ensure the performance of the gel formulation. The initial risk assessment was carried out to check the impact of API, formulation and process variables on CQAs.
Identification of Critical Material Attributes
The inactive ingredients in Votaren® gel include carbomer homopolymer Type C, cocoyl caprylocaprate, fragrance, isopropyl alcohol, mineral oil, polyoxyl 20 cetostearyl ether, propylene glycol, purified water and strong ammonia solution. The generic formulation is qualitatively the same as the reference formulation.
API attributes were not impacting on the CQAs. All excipients were considered for risk evaluation. The key excipients like gelling agent (carbopol) and penetration enhancer (kolliphor) were chosen as critical material variables. The quantities of emollients like mineral oil and cocoyl caprylocaprate were evaluated by one-factor-at-a-time approach, and the quantities of both were fixed at 2.5% ( w / w ). The ratio of oil to water was fixed to 1:24 based on the performance of the gel. The concentration of ammonia solution was fixed at 1.2% ( w / w ). The quantities of cosolvents like isopropyl alcohol and propylene glycol were fixed at 20 and 5% ( w / w ), respectively, based on lab scale developmental trials. Out of all key excipients, carbopol and kolliphor were considered for optimization using design of experiments.
Identification of Critical Process Parameters
The process flowchart is given in Fig. 1 , explaining all the process steps involved in the product development. Diclofenac gel 1% ( w / w ) was prepared by oil-in-water type emulsion technique. Formulation was prepared by mixing different phases together. Homogenization of gel phase, mixing of gel phase and drug phase, emulsification and final bulk mixing were identified as the critical processes. Gel phase was prepared by homogenizing carbopol in water containing 20% ( w / w ) isopropyl alcohol and soaking it. The preparation of the gel phase was a critical step, which involved mixing of the carbopol solution and forming a homogenous gel mass. Mixing of gel phase and drug phase was the next critical step, and the mixing speed and mixing time were the critical process parameters with respect to blend uniformity. Drug phase was prepared separately by dissolving diclofenac sodium in propylene glycol to get a clear solution. The drug phase preparation was not critical as the drug was highly soluble in propylene glycol. The strong ammonia solution was added to the drug phase to achieve the pH 7.2 ± 0.3 of the final formulation. The drug phase was added to the gel phase and homogenized to form a clear, lump-free gel. To the previous bulk, oil phase was added and mixed. An emulsifier was added to the bulk before addition of the oil phase. The oil phase preparation was not critical. But, the emulsification of the oil phase with the main bulk was critical. Emulsification was done in the presence of an emulsifier by adding the oil phase to the aqueous gel phase. The perfume was added to the gel at the end. The final weight and mixing of the bulk were critical to achieve a homogeneous gel formulation. Based on the preliminary trials, occupancy of tank, mixing speed and time were fixed and kept constant for all DoE trials. At the laboratory, the batch size was 0.5 kg and the scale-up batches were 5.0 and 100.0 kg. The laboratory batches were done without application of vacuum and higher scale batches were executed under vacuum. Fig. 1. Process flowchart for the development of diclofenac gel
Physicochemical Evaluation
The appearance of the gel was checked visually. The pH of the gel formulations was determined using a digital pH meter (Thermoscientific, Orion 4star, Singapore) in triplicate. The parallel-plate method was used for determining spreadability of the gel formulation. It was carried out by measuring the spreading diameter of 1 g of the gel between 20 × 20 cm glass plates after 1 min. The weight kept on the upper plate was 125 g and the mean of three readings was calculated. For the determination of the assay, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was used. About 10 g of gel was dissolved in 200 ml diluent and filtered through 0.45 μ polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filter. The filtered solution was analyzed using C18 Zodiac column at 254 nm using a UV detector attached to a HPLC instrument (LC2010 HT, Shimadzu, Japan). The mobile phase composition was a mixture of phosphate buffer and methanol (30:70). The drug content was then calculated.
Determination of Viscosity
The viscosity of the formulation was determined using a Brookfield Viscometer (Brookfield Engineering Laboratories, Inc., USA), model RV DV II + Pro equipped with Helipath spindle no. S-91. The gel sample (250 g) was filled in the sample holder of the viscometer carefully to avoid aeration and stabilized for 10 min. The viscosity was measured using a rotating spindle at a speed of 2.0 rpm at room temperature (25°C ± 2°C) from different locations. The viscosity was reported as a mean of the six-individual measurement of the sample.
Determination of in vitro Drug Diffusion
The in vitro drug release or diffusion of the gel through the dialysis membrane was studied using a modified Franz diffusion (FD) cell (Hanson research, model Microette plus, USA). The gel sample was placed on the dialysis membrane with pore size 0.45 μ from Durapore (Millipore, Bangalore), which was located between the donor and the receptor compartment of the FD cell. An acetate buffer of pH 7.0 was used as a dissolution media. The temperature of the cell was maintained at 32.5 ± 3°C by circulating the water through the jacket. The solution was stirred continuously using a magnetic stirrer. About 300 mg of the gel was placed on the membrane covering an area of 1.767 cm 2 across the donor compartment. A sample of 0.5 ml was withdrawn at predefined time intervals 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 6 h from the receptor compartment and the volume was replenished with the same volume of the fresh dissolution medium. Samples were analyzed from six different cells for drug content using HPLC and the cumulative % drug diffusion was reported as in vitro drug diffusion.
Experimental Design
DoE was used to understand the impact of material variables on the product CQAs. Initially, 2 2 full factorial design with two factors A-carbopol quantity and B-kolliphor quantity at two levels was considered. Due to the non-linear relationship between the factors and the CQAs, the design was further augmented by adding axial and center point experiments. Finally, a face-centered central composite design (CCD) with 11 experiments was used for the evaluation of the assay, viscosity and in vitro diffusion. The experimental conditions are mentioned in Table I . Table I. Details of Experimental Conditions Factors Unit Low level High level Center point Carbopol quantity percent 1.2 2.0 1.6 Kolliphor quantity percent 0.5 3.5 2.0
Generally, the relationship between the factors and CQAs in CCD is expressed by the following equation 1 comprised of first-order effects, interaction terms and the higher order effects. $$ Y={\beta}_0+{\beta}_1 A+{\beta}_2 B+{\beta}_{12}\mathrm{AB}+{\beta}_{11}{A}^2+{\beta}_{22}{\mathrm{B}}^2 $$ (1)
Where, A is the amount of carbopol, B is the amount of kolliphor, β 0 is the intercept and β 1 , β 2 , β 12 , β 11 and β 22 are the coefficients computed from the observed experimental values of the response Y .
The experimental data was analyzed by Design-Expert software (version 9.0.5.1). The design space was established using overlay plots based on the acceptance criteria set to match with the reference product. The design space was verified by performing an additional experiment within the design space. The robustness of the formula was established using Monte Carlo simulation. The formulation was scaled up from 0.5 kg laboratory scale to 100 kg plant scale (scale-up factor 200X). The laboratory scale DoE trials were carried out in a stainless-steel vessel with an overhead anchor stirrer. Scale-up batches of 5 and 100 kg were taken under vacuum in a cream manufacturing vessel (make: Adam Fabriwerk), which had an inbuilt anchor and homogenizer.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Setting Target for CQAs
The assay, viscosity and in vitro drug diffusion were the critical quality attributes of the product. As the spreadability of the drug is a function of the viscosity, it was not considered as a CQA. The appearance of Voltaren® gel was translucent white. Different lots of Voltaren® gel were analyzed for the assay, pH, spreadability and viscosity to characterize the product, and the values were 100.8 ± 1.7%, 7.2 ± 0.02, 54.75 ± 0.5 mm and 49,537 ± 5358 cps, respectively. The cumulative % drug diffusions at 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 6 h were 15.0 ± 1.27%, 22.4 ± 1.79%, 36.1 ± 2.84%, 56 ± 4.72% and 67.3 ± 6.33%, respectively. The target value for pH, assay and viscosity were 7–7.4, 90–110% and 49,537.5 ± 5358 cps, respectively. The calculation for the target is explained in “ Results and Discussion .” For DoE trials without vacuum, the target for viscosity was kept as 66,269–82,344 cps. For in vitro drug diffusion, the target was set as 13.7–16.3% at 0.5 h, 20.6–24.2% at 1 h, 33.3–38.9% at 2 h, 51.3–60.7% at 4 h and 61–73.6% at 6 h.
Identification of CMAs and Its Impact on CQAs
The gelling agent is the key component of the gel formulation. In this formulation carbopol was used as a gelling agent. Carbopol is a cross-linked polyacrylate polymer with high viscosity. Hence, considering the strong impact of carbopol on the viscosity and, thereby, on the diffusion kinetics of the incorporated drug, the concentration of carbopol was selected as a factor for optimization. The strong ammonium solution was used for the neutralization of carbopol and the formation of the gel. The quantity of strong ammonium solution was selected based on lab scale trial to achieve the target pH 7.2 ± 0.3.
Kolliphor is a polyoxyethylene alkyl ether which is a non-ionic surfactant produced by the polyethoxylation of linear fatty alcohols. Kolliphor is used as an emulsifier and penetration enhancer for topical preparations. Hence, the concentration of kolliphor was also selected for optimization considering its impact on the in vitro drug diffusion profile.
Batches were taken in a stainless steel (SS) container with an overhead anchor stirrer in the laboratory. To check the impact of mixing speed, batches were carried out with the same composition at different mixing speeds for 45 min. There was no significant difference in the viscosity at different mixing speeds (e.g., 68,100 cps at 28 rpm and 68,225 cps at 50 rpm). Hence, a low mixing speed of 28 rpm for 45 min was considered for all DoE trials.
Experimental Design Data
Based on the factorial design, initially, six experiments were carried out and the experimental data were analyzed statistically. The half-normal plots for the viscosity and the in vitro drug diffusion at 0.5 and 6 h, as shown in Fig. 2a–c , indicated that both carbopol and kolliphor were significantly impacting the viscosity and the in vitro drug diffusion while the effect of carbopol was more prominent than that of the other factor. The interaction of these two factors was also showing considerable impact on the diffusion. Fig. 2. Half-normal plots for viscosity ( a ) and in vitro drug diffusion at 0.5 ﻿h ( b ) and 6 h ( c )
The statistical analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the data indicates the non-linear relationship between the factors and the in vitro drug diffusions. Hence, additional five experiments as per CCD were performed. The results of all 11 experiments are shown in Table II . For all trials, the color of the gel was translucent white and the assay was within 98–102%. The viscosity and the in vitro drug diffusion profile for all trials are given in Table II , and the ANOVA summary for these responses is given in Table III . Table II.

ANOVA Analysis
The models for the viscosity and the in vitro drug diffusions at different time intervals were significant as p values were found less than 0.05. Lack of fit for all responses were non-significant ( p values >0.05 for all responses) indicating the absence of non-significant model terms in the models. The goodness of fit for the regression model can be explained by a high R 2 value. The high value of R 2 explained the strong relationship between factors A-carbopol and B-kolliphor with the response. In all cases, the predicted R 2 values were above 0.8. Hence, the predictability of the responses using these equations was good.
Establishment of Equations
The relationship established for each response is given in Eqs. ( 2 )–( 7 ). The equation generated for the viscosity is expressed in Eq. ( 2 ), comprised of the coefficients for intercept, first-order and quadratic terms for both the factors carbopol and kolliphor. $$ \begin{array}{c}\hfill \mathrm{Viscosity}=255770\hbox{-} 350542\ast \mathrm{CP}\hbox{-} 16849\ast \mathrm{KCS}+158845\ast {\mathrm{CP}}^2+2145\ast {\mathrm{KCS}}^2\hfill \\ {}\hfill \left(\mathrm{CP}=\mathrm{carbopol}\ \mathrm{and}\ \mathrm{KCS}=\mathrm{kolliphor}\right)\hfill \end{array} $$ (2)
The polynomial equations established for the in vitro drug diffusion at 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 6 h are given in Eqs. ( 3 )–( 7 ), respectively. $$ \mathrm{Diffusion}\ 0.5\mathrm{h}=\hbox{-} 18.26+{53.20}^{\ast}\mathrm{CP}\hbox{-} {1.00}^{\ast}\mathrm{KCS}\hbox{-} 19{.71\ast \mathrm{CP}}^2 $$ (3) $$ \mathrm{Diffusion}\ 1\mathrm{h}=\hbox{-} 1.30+{57.05}^{\ast}\mathrm{CP}\hbox{-} {7.53}^{\ast}\mathrm{KCS}+{3.25}^{\ast }{\mathrm{CP}}^{\ast}\mathrm{KCS}\hbox{-} 24{.65\ast \mathrm{CP}}^2 $$ (4) $$ \mathrm{Diffusion}\ 2\mathrm{h}=+14.33+{77.07}^{\ast}\mathrm{CP}\hbox{-} {14.65}^{\ast}\mathrm{KCS}+{6.30}^{\ast }{\mathrm{CP}}^{\ast}\mathrm{KCS}\hbox{-} 35{.99\ast \mathrm{CP}}^2 $$ (5) $$ \mathrm{Diffusion}\ 4\mathrm{h}=\hbox{-} 1.34+{142.51}^{\ast}\mathrm{CP}\hbox{-} {19.40}^{\ast}\mathrm{KCS}+{8.03}^{\ast }{\mathrm{CP}}^{\ast}\mathrm{KCS}\hbox{-} 61{.01\ast \mathrm{CP}}^2 $$ (6) $$ \mathrm{Diffusion}\ 6\mathrm{h}=\hbox{-} 21.24+{182.92}^{\ast}\mathrm{CP}\hbox{-} {17.47}^{\ast}\mathrm{KCS}+{6.71}^{\ast }{\mathrm{CP}}^{\ast}\mathrm{KCS}\hbox{-} 73{.53\ast \mathrm{CP}}^2 $$ (7)
It is observed that except for diffusion at 0.5 h, all equations contain the interaction term.
Contour and 3D surface plots exhibit a quick and easy way of interpreting the relationship between the variables and the response, and that can be understood based on contour lines and graduated color shading. The contour plots and 3D plots for the viscosity and contour plots for the in vitro drug diffusion are shown in Figs. 3 and 4 , respectively. Fig. 3. Effect of carbopol and kolliphor on viscosity. Contour plot ( a ) and 3D surface plot﻿ ( b )﻿ Fig. 4. Contour plots showing the effect of carbopol and kolliphor on in vitro drug diffusion of the gel at 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 6 h
Viscosity
The interaction effect of the amount of carbopol and kolliphor on the viscosity is shown in Fig. 3a . The contour plot displays the relationship in two dimensions: with carbopol (A) and kolliphor (B) plotted on the X - and Y -axis, respectively, and the magnitude of the viscosity is represented by contour lines. With the increase in the concentration of carbopol from 1.2 to 2% ( w / w ), the viscosity increased from 50,000 to 150,000 cps. Within the concentration range of 0.5–3.5% ( w / w ), the impact of kolliphor on the viscosity was not significant. The arrow on the graph shown in Fig. 3a indicates the region of interest or the desired range (58,230–90,383 cps) of the viscosity. 3D surface plot for the viscosity shown in Fig. 3b indicates the non-linear relationship.
It is important to note that in the laboratory, all DoE trials were carried out in an open vessel with an overhead stirrer. Air entrapment into the gel during stirring might have occurred and that had an impact on the viscosity of the gel. To evaluate the impact of air entrapment, a couple of experiments having the same formula were carried out at a large scale (10X) into a closed vessel with and without vacuum. The viscosity without vacuum (68,760 cps) was approximately 1.5 times higher than the viscosity with vacuum (46,150 cps). But, there was no change in the in vitro drug diffusions between the trials with and without vacuum. Hence, the target for the viscosity which was 38,820–60,255 cps (based on reference product 49,537 cps ±2 standard deviation) converted to 58,230–90,383 cps (considering the factor 1.5X for without vacuum) for DoE trials. To get rid of the ambiguity of air entrapment, all higher scale-up batches were taken with vacuum.
In vitro Drug Diffusion Profile
Contour plots for the in vitro drug diffusions at different time intervals are shown in Fig. 4 . With the increase in the concentration of carbopol from 1.2 to 2% ( w / w ), the percentage cumulative in vitro drug diffusion decreases. The lower percentage drug diffusion region is denoted by the blue color and higher percentage drug diffusion region is denoted by the red color. The contour plots for all studied time intervals at 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 6 h show the similar trend for all in vitro drug diffusions.
Design Space Establishment and Verification
The target acceptance criteria for the viscosity and the in vitro drug diffusions have been established based on the characterization of different lots of reference product considering mean ±2 standard deviation. The tagets were considered too stringent of the specification in comparison to three standard deviations. Contour plots for all studied responses i.e. viscosity and in vitro drug diffusions at 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 6 h were overlayed, and the design space was established by applying the acceptance criteria as shown in the yellow region in Fig. 5 . Any combination of the quantity of carbopol and kolliphor within the design space should meet the target, the predefined value of the responses based on the reference product. Fig. 5. Design space for diclofenac gel considering viscosity and percentage of drug diffusion at predefined time intervals
The design space was verified by performing the experiment in the laboratory scale (0.5 kg batch size, without vacuum) at 1.6% w / w of carbopol and 2% w / w of kolliphor. This batch was analyzed for the viscosity and the in vitro drug diffusions, and the results are shown in Table IV . The responses of the verification trial have been compared with predicted responses from the model equation and with reference formulation. The predicted response for the viscosity and the in vitro drug diffusions with 95% confidence interval was in good agreement with the experimental values. Table IV.

Performance Evaluation at a Higher Scale
The formula selected from the lab scale with 1.6% w / w of carbopol and 2% w / w of kolliphor was also tested at the higher scale in the manufacturing. Scale up was considered at 10 times (10X) and 200 times (200X) higher than the laboratory batch size. The scale-up trials of 5 kg (scale-up factor 10X) and 100 kg (scale-up factor 200X) with 1.6% w / w of carbopol and 2% w / w of kolliphor were taken in a closed vessel with vacuum. Homogeneity of gel is critical at the higher scale; hence, the uniformity of the gel was tested in the bulk as well as after filling the bulk in a tube as a finished product.
For 10X batch, the finished product was a white opaque gel with pH 7.12, assay 100.7%, spreadability 56.2 mm and viscosity 46,150 cps. For 200X batch, the assay and viscosity at the top, middle and end positions of the bulk are given in Table V along with the data of the finished product after filling. The data indicates the good homogeneity of the product. The in vitro drug diffusion profiles of the optimized formula at the laboratory scale, 10X scale and 200X scale against the reference product, have been compared and shown in Fig. 6 . These were very close to each other. At the higher scale, all CQAs were equivalent with the reference product target. Table V.

Establishment of Robustness
After the establishment of design space, it is necessary to demonstrate the robustness considering the inherent variation in the factors. The quantity of excipients was considered as factors; hence, the variation in the amount was considered to evaluate the robustness. It may happen due to variation in weighing. At the lab scale, the inherent variation was taken as ±0.01% standard deviation. Considering the mean and the standard deviation in the quantity of carbopol and kolliphor, 100,000 data were generated with the help of Monte Carlo simulation (Minitab, Ver. 17). On the other hand, 100,000 data for each response were generated using the regression model derived from DoE [Eqs. ( 2 )–( 7 )]. The process capability index Cpk values were estimated for all these responses as shown in Table VI and Figs. 7 and 8 . Based on the Cpk values, it can be concluded that the gel formulation with carbopol 1.59–1.61% w/w and kolliphor 1.99–2.01% w/w was robust. Table VI.

CONCLUSIONS
Diclofenac sodium gel 1% w / w was developed using QbD principles. The critical material variables were evaluated to understand the behavior of the CQAs for diclofenac gel. Among the factors, the concentrations of carbopol and kolliphor were considered as critical factors. Design space was established considering these two critical formulation variables. The product was scaled up to 200 times of the laboratory scale. The performance of the scale up was similar to the laboratory scale as well as the reference samples. The process capability was evaluated to establish the robustness of the formula using Monte Carlo simulation and the Cpk values (1.25–3.48) for CQAs indicated the robustness of the product.
