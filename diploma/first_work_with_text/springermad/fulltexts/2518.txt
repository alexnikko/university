Introduction
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological disease characterized by inflammation and demyelination in the central nervous system (CNS) (Kocer et al. ). High concentrations of homocysteine have been associated with neurodegenerative disorders, such as MS and Alzheimer disease and may be a risk factor for these conditions (Seshadri ).
Homocysteine is a non-essential sulfur-containing amino acid that is derived from methionine metabolism and depends on folate, vitamin B12, and vitamin B6. Several studies have shown increased plasma levels of homocysteine in MS patients when compared to healthy subjects (Ramsaransing et al. ; Moghaddasi et al. ).
Some articles have already shown that hyperhomocysteinemia was significantly associated and/or correlated with cognitive impairment, visual abnormalities, and clinical progression in patients with MS (Russo et al. ; Teunissen et al. ).
Homocysteine is considered an inflammatory marker and there is strong evidence that homocysteine itself is able to induce blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption (Kamath et al. ). MS is characterized by an inflammatory process in the CNS and BBB breakdown and recruitment of activated immune cells from the peripheral blood into CNS are early events in the development of inflammatory MS lesions (Kuenz et al. ). In addition, cellular adhesion molecules (CAM), such as intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell-adhesion-molecule-1 (VCAM-1), platelet-endothelial-cell-adhesion-molecule-1 (PECAM-1) and inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) regulate adherence and diapedesis of immune cells across the BBB into the CNS and seems to be associated with physiopathology of MS (Kalinowska-Lyszczars et al. ). It was previously observed that serum PECAM-1 and VCAM-1 levels were elevated in MS patients during relapses, but remained low in the progressive phase of the disease (Kuenz et al. ).
The hypothesis of a possible association between elevated plasma homocysteine levels and progression of the disease in MS patients is supported by some studies (Obeid and Herrmann ; Skovierová et al. ), which have showed that homocysteine might cause neuronal damage by some mechanisms: first, increasing the production of reactive oxygen species (Faraci and Lentz ); second, promoting excitotoxicity via stimulation of N-methyl-D-asparate receptors (NMDA), damaging neuronal DNA, and thereby triggering apoptosis (Ho et al. ).
Few studies have evaluated the relationship of the clinical forms in MS and homocysteine levels. Besler and Comoglu ( ) found elevated plasma homocysteine levels in patients with secondary progressive MS (SP-MS) compared with healthy controls, whereas other studies showed that homocysteine levels did not differ between the progressive forms and relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RR-MS) (Ramsaransing et al. ; Teunissen et al. ). Although the age in which it begins as well as the different forms of the disease can aid in the prediction of the prognosis, the search for other sensitive biomarkers is an important issue (Renoux ; Koch et al. ).
To our knowledge, the relationship between hyperhomocysteinemia, TNF-α and CAM, and disability progression, evaluated by Multiple Sclerosis Severity Score (MSSS), has not been investigated yet. In addition, there are controversy about association between hyperhomocysteinemia and clinical forms of MS. Thus, the aims of this study were to verify whether hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with disability progression in MS patients and whether TNF pathways and CAM is involved in this process.
Subjects and methods
Study participants and clinical data
One hundred and eighty MS patients were recruited from the Neurology Outpatient Department of the Outpatient Clinical Hospital, State University of Londrina. All patients were diagnosed with definite MS according to McDonald’s criteria (Polman et al. ). Initially, demographic and inflammatory biomarkers were analyzed in the control group and in MS patients. After that, MS patients were divided into two groups, according to the median, in patients with levels of homocysteine <11.35 and ≥ 11.35 umol/L. Al last, patients were categorized in their clinical forms relapsing-remitting MS (RR-MS), secondary progressive MS (SP-MS) and primary progressive (PP-MS) forms, according to their homocysteine levels.
MS patients were clinically evaluated for disability using the Expanded Disability Status Score (EDSS) scores (Kurtzke ) and for seriousness of the disease by Multiple Sclerosis Severity Score (MSSS) (Roxburgh et al. ), where a score of above 5.0 means higher than average speed of disability accumulation (Koch et al. ).
The control group consisted of 204 healthy individuals from the same geographic area. The patients and controls were age, sex, ethnicity, and body mass index (BMI) controlled. None of the participants in the study presented clinical symptoms or laboratory markers of heart, thyroid, and renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal, or oncological diseases. The patients with several conditions which could interfere with homocysteine values, such as renal impairment, B12 insufficiency, hypothyroidism and hemolysis or using drugs, such as phenytoin, isoniazid, methrotexate and L-dopa (Panunzio et al. ) were also excluded from the study. None of the subjects were placed on a specific diet and was receiving antioxidant supplements. The patients were instructed by a nutritionist to maintain their usual diets, alcohol intake, level of physical activity, or other lifestyle factors throughout the intervention period. All subjects gave written informed consent, and the study protocol was fully approved by the Ethical Committee of the State University of Londrina, Londrina, Paraná, Brazil.
Anthropometric measurements
Body weight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg by using an electronic scale, with individuals wearing light clothing, but no shoes, in the morning; height was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm by using a stadiometer. BMI was calculated as weight (kg) divided by height (m) squared.
Determination of the inflammatory biomarkers
Evaluation of CAM, TNF-α and receptors (TNFR1 and TNFR2)
Levels of PECAM-1, VCAM-1, ICAM-1, TNF-α, TNFR1 and TNFR2 were determined by multiplex immunoassays (Novex Life Technologies, Frederick, United States of America) for the Luminex® plataform in MAGPIX instrument.
Determination of homocysteine
Plasma levels of homocysteine were determined by chemiluminescence microparticule immunoassay (Architect, Abbott Laboratory, Abbott Park, IL, USA). MS group was subdivided according homocysteine level (reference group: 1 and 2 interquartis and hyperhomocysteinemia: 3 and 4 interquartis).
Statistical analysis
Analyses of contingency tables (χ 2 test or Fisher’s exact test) were employed to check the associations between categorical variables and diagnostic groups. Categorical variables were expressed as absolute number (n) and percentage (%). We assessed the differences in continuous variables between groups using the Mann-Whitney test and data were expressed as the median and interquartile range (25–75%). All the results with p < 0.10 in the univariate analysis were included in the multivariate logistic regression model. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were also calculated. The statistical analysis was performed with SPSS for Windows, version 20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and significance was defined as p < 0.05.
Results
Characteristics of MS patients and controls
Table 1 shows the demographic characteristics and inflammatory markers of MS patients and controls included in this study. As expected, no differences were found in age, sex, ethnicity and BMI between the groups. MS patients showed higher plasma levels of TNF-alfa ( p < 0.0001), soluble TNFR1 ( p = 0.038) and TNFR2 (p < 0.0001) than controls. Regarding adhesion molecules, MS patients showed lower levels of PECAM ( p = 0.001), ICAM ( p < 0.001) and VCAM-1 ( p = 0.005) than controls. MS patients showed higher plasma levels of homocysteine (median: 11.35 ummol/L, 25–75% interquartis: 9.41–3.44) than controls (median: 9.85 ummol/L, 25–75% interquartis: 8.47–11.59, p < 0.001) (Fig. 1 a).

Among the MS patients, 152 (84.4%) presented RR-MS and 28 (15.6%) patients presented progressive forms, such as 20 (71.4%) the secondary progressive form (SPMS) and 8 (28.6%) the primary progressive form. According the MS treatment, 108 (60.0%) patients were in use of interferon β, 46 (25.5%) glatiramer acetate, 9 (5.0%) natalizumab, and 17 (9.5%) were without treatment (data not shown).
Table 2 shows the outcome of a logistic regression analysis with MS group as dependent variable and the controls as the reference group and the significant biomarkers shown in Table 1 . We found that homocysteine (OR:1.258, 95% IC: 1.051–1.505, p = 0.012), TNFR1 (OR: 0.998, 95% IC: 0.996–0.998, p = 0.007), TNFR2 (OR: 1.003, 95% IC: 1.002–1.004, p < 0.001), and PECAM (OR: 1.000, 95%IC: 1.000–1.000, p = 0.005) were associated with MS.

MS patients according homocysteine levels
When patients were divided according their homocysteine levels (Table 3 ), the groups showed significant differences in age (p < 0.001), sex ( p = 0.016), and ethnicity ( p = 0.022). Patients with higher homocysteine levels presented a faster progression of the disease as well as they had more disability compared to the patients with lower homocysteine levels; these data were shown by an increase ( p < 0.0001) in MSSS ≥5 and EDSS, respectively. There were no differences in relation to BMI, disease duration, and MS treatments. Regarding the inflammatory biomarkers, patients with higher homocysteine levels had increased TNFR1 ( p = 0.039) and ICAM-1 ( p = 0.034) levels compared to the patients with lower homocysteine levels. After performing the binomial logistic regression analyses (Table 4 ), it was verified that age (0.001), sex (p = 0.005), ethnicity ( p = 0.029), and MSSS ( p = 0.013) were independently associated with hyperhomocysteinemia in patients with MS.

Plasmatic levels of homocysteine according to MS clinical forms
Patients with the progressive forms showed higher plasma levels of homocysteine than MS-RR ( p < 0.001) (Fig. 1 b).
In univariate analysis, patients with progressive were older ( p < 0.0001) than MS-RR. The proportion of non-caucasian individuals was significantly higher in patients with progressive forms than controls MS-RR ( p = 0.031). As expected, patients with progressive forms showed higher EDSS and MSSS than RR-MS patients (p < 0.0001). Levels of TNF-R1 and PECAM were higher in progressive forms than MS-RR patients ( p = 0.015 and p = 0.014, respectively). Treatment with natalizumab and glatiramer acetate differ between the subgroups of clinical forms ( p = 0.002 and p = 0.069, respectively) –BMI, treatment with interferon β, and the levels of TNF-α, TNF-R2, ICAM, VCAM, did not differ between the groups (data not shown). To verify associations with clinics forms of MS, the results obtained with the univariate analysis ( p < 0.1), a binomial logistic regression analysis was performed (Table 5 ). The homocysteine levels were associated with the progressive forms of MS, independently of age, sex, and treatment (Table 5 ).

Discussion
Some findings of the present study must be highlighted. MS patients showed elevated level of homocysteine, TNFR1, and TNFR2 and reduced levels of PECAM, independently of sex and age. In addition, hyperhomocysteinemia in MS patients was associated with disease progression evaluated by the MSSS but not with inflammatory biomarkers, independently of confounding factors. In addition, patients with progressive forms showed higher levels of homocysteine when compared with RR-MS patients, independently of sex and age.
Our data showed that inflammatory markers such as homocysteine, TNFR1, TNFR2 and, PECAM were associated with the presence of MS. However, we found no association in inflammatory markers when MS patients were divided according their homocysteine levels. Elevated production of TNF-α is evident in patients and animal models of a wide range of CNS inflammatory pathologies, including MS (Sharief and Hentges ; Probert ). TNF-α and their receptors play a key role in the induction and maintenance of inflammation in MS. In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, TNFR1 signaling is essential for apoptosis in T cells as well as in oligodendrocytes. In turn, decreased tissue damage and increased repair during autoimmune demyelination are beneficial effects which can be attributed to TNFR2 signaling (Probert ); thus, concomitant evaluation of these biomarkers is advisable. In the present study, TNFR1 and TNR2 were associated with MS, but not TNF-α. Previous studies demonstrated elevated serum levels of TNFR1, but not of TNFR2, in MS patients in remission (Hartung et al. ; Rieckmann et al. ). Together, our data showed the complex interaction between TNF-α and their receptors in the pathogenesis of inflammation in MS.
TNF-α induces leukocyte adhesion to cerebral vessels through the upregulation of adhesion molecules such as VCAM and ICAM and can contribute to BBB disruption (Probert ), which facilitates migration of autoreactive T-cells to the CNS in MS. (Greenwood et al. ). In the present study, we evaluated a panel of CAM. Our results showed that serum levels of PECAM, ICAM e VCAM were decreased in MS patients when compared to controls. ICAM and VCAM, which are both involved in leukocyte trafficking across endothelia, are linked to two different integrins on the surface of immune and other cells. They play an important role in immune cells transmigration across BBB into CNS, and thus have a key role in the pathogenesis of MS (Engelhardt ; Wipfler et al. ). In contrast, a previous study observed that serum PECAM-1 and VCAM-1 levels were elevated in MS patients during relapses (Kuenz et al. ). Differently from the aforementioned study, our patients were evaluated during remission. In addition, it is possible that CAM results have been influenced by MS treatment.
In agreement with previous studies, we found that plasma homocysteine levels were increased in patients with MS when compared to a control group (Ramsaransing et al. ; Salemi et al. ; Moghaddasi et al. ). Epidemiological studies indicate that high homocysteine levels may be a risk factor for neurodegenerative conditions (Seshadri ; Zhu et al. ), and neurological decline and cognitive impairment in MS (Russo et al. ; Ansari et al. ; Fahmy et al. ). Extracellular homocysteine may be responsible for many deleterious effects due to nervous system particular sensitivity to its toxicity, such as promotion of excitotoxicity via stimulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDA), and damages to neuronal DNA, thus triggering apoptosis (Ho et al. ; Skovierová et al. ). Homocysteine acts as an agonist for both groups of glutamate receptors, AMPA and NMDA. Overstimulation of these receptors results in increased level of cytoplasmic calcium, higher production of free radicals and activation of caspases leading to apoptosis (Skovierová et al. ). Similarly to neuronal cells, glial cells are also exposed to toxic effects of homocysteine Skovierová et al. ).
Therefore, it is conceivable to suggest that association between higher levels of homocysteinemia and increased disability and progression of the disease can be explained by the direct neurotoxic effect that homocysteine provokes via excitotoxicity mechanism, thus contributing to neurodegeneration. Teunissen et al. ( ) assessed the EDSS and Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) at the baseline and after four-year follow-up to evaluate clinical progression and similarly to our results they found that higher homocysteine levels were correlated with clinical progression of the disease in MS patients. In addition, our results showed that MS patients with hyperhomocysteinemia had more disability verified by EDSS. A recent study has also reported that homocysteine levels were higher in patients with EDSS ≥5 (Guzel et al. ).
We also investigated the possible association between homocysteine levels and the clinical forms in MS patients. Previous studies failed to show differences in homocysteine levels according clinical forms (Ramsaransing et al. ; Teunissen et al. ). Recently, a meta-analysis reported the associations between MS and serum or plasma Hcy, vitamin B12, and folate levels (Dardiotis et al. ). There were statistically significant differences between MS patients and controls in Hcy levels. However, stratification according to clinical forms did not reveal significant differences between relapsing-remitting MS patients and controls and between secondary progressive MS patients and controls (Dardiotis et al. ). In contrast, our data showed that homocysteine levels were higher in the patients with the progressive forms (SPMS and PPMS) compared with the patients with the RRMS form. In addition, when the binomial logistic regression analysis was performed, homocysteine was associated with the progressive forms, independently of the sex and age.
The main limitation of the current report is that cross-sectional studies do not allow inferences on causal relationships. A second limitation is the small number of individuals with progressive forms. A third limitation is that polymorphism could have influenced plasma homocysteine levels even in the control group, although both groups were from the same geographical area and had similar ethnicities. At last, lifestyle conditions such as excessive coffee or alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, and physical inactivity may play a role in modulating the plasma level of Hcy, although the evidence remains controversial.
In conclusion, this is the first study in which homocysteinemia was associated with progression of the disease (MSSS), although this finding was not directly related to TNF-α and TNFR pathways or to CAM. More studies are necessary to elucidate the complex inflammatory molecular interactions in the progression of MS.
