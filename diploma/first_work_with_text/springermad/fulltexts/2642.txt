The use of different chemical combinations to restrict the movement or freedom of animals and sometimes to sedate them has been described for many years in animal research (Dyson ; Mathews and Dyson ; Rockhill et al. ). Selection of an appropriate combination for a particular individual and achievement of suitable results may be too difficult and is related to the animal’s breed, size, and its temperament (Johnson ). Challenges of veterinarians with cats as universal companion animals with potentially dangerous temperaments encourage them to use extreme chemical restraints when performing diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Presence of cats in a clinic environment with the existence of unfamiliar people is an uncomfortable experience for them. So, their unexpected reactions may result in injury to the veterinary staff, the animal owner, or animal. Compulsory physical handling can alter the cellular or chemical composition of the blood in cats (Kleinsorgen et al. ; Rand et al. ). Different drugs or combination of drugs are used in practice with felines to obtain invasive handling. Intravenous administration (IV) of low dose of ketamine combined with diazepam, as an effective chemical restraint in cats, showed minimal changes in hemato-biochemical parameters (Reynolds et al. ). However, numerous cats appear intolerant to vein access without sedation, and in principle, venipuncture is a difficult procedure especially in disturbed cats. Furthermore, unwanted rapid IV injection of diazepam may induce phlebitis and arrhythmogenic effect because of its solvent, propylene glycol. Absorption of diazepam following intramuscular (IM) injection is slow and painful and is not recommended. So, the present study evaluated clinical and hemato-biochemical aspects of IM injection of ketamine combined with midazolam, a benzodiazepine having a rapid onset of action.
Materials and methods
Twenty healthy adult female domesticated cats, weighing 3.2 ± 1.1, were allocated to this experiment. The owners had been informed about the study and gave consent for their animals to be subjects in the present experiment. Due to physical examination and gentle handling of cats, a cephalic vein was catheterized and heparinized with normal saline and occulted with a light dressing. Finally, the cats were left in their transport carriers in a quiet room with their owners for at least 30 min to adjust to the surrounding condition and the inserted catheter. The first blood sample was obtained when the cats had adapted to the new conditions. The second blood sample was collected after intramuscular injection of ketamine (5 mg/kg)-midazolam (0.4 mg/kg) combination (KM) when the animals were tranquilized clinically and immobilized and slept. Additionally, duration of tranquility effect of administrated combination, duration of loss of cat’s ability to move its head and found comfort clinically, were recorded. Heart rate, respiratory rate, rectal temperature, and arterial oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) were recorded before first blood collection until end of tranquility effect of injected combination. Blood examination including measurement of hematocrit (Hct), hemoglobin concentration (Hb), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), red blood cells (RBCs), platelets (PLTs,) and white blood cells (WBCs) was adequately performed from the EDTA specimens. Differential WBC count was obtained manually due to routine blood smear preparation using May-Grunwald Giemsa staining. Also, packed cell volume (PCV) measurements visually were read by centrifugation of mini PCV tubes. Some biochemichal parameters such as total protein (TP), albumin, glucose (Glu), triglycerides (TG), ALP, AST, ALT, creatine kinase (CK), amylase, lipase, creatinine, urea, cholesterol, sodium (Na), potassium (K), chloride (Cl), calcium (Ca), inorganic phosphates (P), and magnesium (Mg) were analyzed from the separated plasma of non-EDTA blood samples.
The findings of the study were reported as mean ± SD, and probability less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Mean measured hemato-biochemical values, before administration of any drug and after clinical tranquilization of animals, were compared using paired sample t test. Also, means of physiologic parameters were analyzed statistically with repeated measures ANOVA using SPSS.
Results
Duration of clinical sedation of cats due to injection of ketamine-midazolam combination was recorded 5.61 ± 0.8 min during which their clinical examination was performed without any movement, excitation, and resistance. The time interval from the clinical quietness of cats to their ability to move their head and try to bear weight on their rear limbs was 22.163 ± 2.55 min. The animals had relatively smooth recovery. Table 1 shows physiologic parameter changes following injection of ketamine-midazolam combination. There was no significant alternation in the HR before injection and at different times. Despite a decrease in RR after injection of KM combination ( P ˂0.05), there were no changes in RR at time 5 until 30, and concurrently at end stage of recovery, it showed increase. Rectal temperature of animals showed non-marked gradual decrease. At time 5, a significant decline in the SpO 2 was recorded. But, no significant alternation was observed at time 10 to end of study compared to normal values (time 0).

Due to injection of KMC and at the greatest sedative effect of this combination, some parameters such as RBC count, Hb concentration, PCV, WBC count, lymphocyte number, and plasma level of glucose showed significant decrease ( P < 0.05). However, significant changes were observed in the other hemato-biochemical parameters pre- and post-administration of KMC ( P ˂0.05).
Discussion
Observed results show a suitable chemical restraint after intramuscular injection of ketamine (5 mg/kg)-midazolam (0.4 mg/kg) in domestic cats. Tranquility effect of this combination provides a safe duration for clinical examination and performing of diagnostic procedures. In fact, no excitation and improper movement was recorded at time of sedation of animals and subsequently they woke up without any uneasiness or impatience. Fortunately, the laboratory findings showed at least variations in the hemato-biochemical parameters.
Ketamine caused some side effects such as increased heart rate, cardiac output, and blood pressure. Ketamine was also shown to exert a direct negative inotropic effect on the myocardium, an effect that is overridden by the ketamine-induced sympathetic tone (Clanahan et al. ; Hall and Clarke ), and to cause slight respiratory depression (White et al. ). Administration of ketamine in combination with potent sedatives such as detomidine and xylazine leads to bradycardia in cats with minimum changes in the respiratory rate, SpO 2 , and body temperature (Grove and Ramsay ). Also, it was reported that intramuscular injection of ketamine-xylazine combination can induce feline muscular necrosis (Troyer et al. ). This combination causes a long time of recovery of about 6–8 h, and sometimes, aggressive behaviors such as biting were observed following administration of ketamine-xylazine combination in cats. Comparison of ketamine-midazolam with ketamine alone showed more muscular tremors in the ketamine group, and ketamine-midazolam provided good sedation in the cats. However, cardiovascular effects of ketamine were permanent in the ketamine-midazolam group (Troyer et al. ). Also, the cats showed less reaction to the injection of midazolam and ketamine when compared with ketamine alone (McEvoy ). A previous study had manifested the sedative effect and some unusual behaviors like ataxia, sternal, or lateral recumbency due to intravenous and intramuscular administration of midazolam in cats (Ilkiw et al. ). Midazolam in combination with ketamine was used for induction of anesthesia in cats with cardiomyopathy intramuscularly and sufficient sedation, reduction in mean arterial pressure and heart rate was recorded (Akkerdaas et al. ). Low dose of ketamine in combination with midazolam-medetomidine was evaluated in cats undergoing non-invasive dental procedures. According to sub-anesthetic doses of ketamine, clinical immobilization of animals was between 30 ± 15 and 68 ± 28 min. A significant dose-depending reduction of respiratory rate was noted. But venous carbon dioxide and pH values combined with arterial oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) values were not a concern. The diastolic blood pressure, in particular, was seen to increase (Ebner et al. ). It is known that the pharmacologic effects of midazolam can be seen clinically within 5 to 20 min (McEvoy ) as in this study but in the experience of Troyer et al. ( ), maximal effects did not occur until 30 to 60 min after an intramuscular injection (Troyer et al. ). It is clear that midazolam is readily absorbed from muscle. The elimination of half-life of midazolam alone in people is about 2 h (Muir et al. ). Clinically, it was noted that cats continued to be ataxic, unresponsive, and recumbent for as long as 4 to 6 h after phlebotomy when the ketamine-midazolam combination was used (Troyer et al. ). In contrast, in our study, the cats showed more rapid recovery.
Ketamine, because of its central sympathomimetic effects with stimulation of neuroadrenergic neurons and the inhibition of catecholamine uptake, provokes the cardiovascular system and induces increase of HR, arterial blood pressure, and cardiac output (Takki et al. ). Ketamine via depression of CNS and respiratory system of cats results in decrease of RR and tidal volume. Furthermore, midazolam as a mild tranquilizer enhances the impact of the central nervous system’s (CNS) inhibitory neurotransmitters, opening chloride channels and acting upon benzodiazepine receptors. It has a depressant effect on the sympathetic response that influences hypotension and a higher incidence of bradycardia (Nascimento Jdos et al. ). Also, midazolam is known to cause respiratory depression. So, depression effects of ketamine and midazolam and apneustic ventilation due to ketamine action may explain the significant decline of RR and transient decrease of SpO 2 following injection of ketamine-midazolam combination in the present study. It seems that no variation in cardiovascular function was affected by the act of ketamine. Like the present study, rectal temperature decreased non-significantly in midazolam and midazolam-ketamine combination groups due to central nervous depression caused by benzodiazepines and reduced muscular activity (Abu-Ahmed ; Grint and Murison ; Kilic ).
Anesthetics and sedatives could impress hematologic and biochemical parameters. There are contradictory reports about the impact of ketamine alone on the biochemical parameters. No variation of biochemical parameters, except increase of urea, was reported due to administration of ketamine in laboratory rats (Bougherara and Bouaziz ). Increase of blood glucose became mooted in dogs (Kumar et al. ). No changes in creatinine and urea values were observed in dogs due to injection of ketamine alone (Kumar et al. ). Administration of ketamine in rats showed the absence of significant alternation in ALT and AST (Bougherara and Bouaziz ). This result is comparable to that reported by Muir in cats (Muir ).
Hemoglobin (Hb) and packed cell volume showed significant ( P < 0.01) decline compared to the pre-sedative control values with diazepam (Habib et al. ). Midazolam and midazolam ketamine induced decrease of HCT, HB, WBCs, and RBCs for a short duration in Baladi goats (Abu-Ahmed ). Midazolam given alone made no significant change in plasma glucose concentration in healthy cats (Kanda and Hikasa ). Desborough et al. ( ) indicated that using midazolam had an association with a decline in insulin secretion during upper abdominal surgery and a decline in blood glucose levels in humans (Desborough et al. ). Midazolam alone by its pharmacologic effect or via excitement-like behavior associated with its administration could induce increase in norepinephrine and epinephrine concentration in healthy cats but made no significant change just plasma norepinephrine concentrations in humans (Kanda and Hikasa ; Kong et al. ). No significant changes were observable in the plasma cortisol concentration in cats due to injection of midazolam (Kanda and Hikasa ). Gülanber et al. ( ) posited the unchangeable status in biochemical parameters (urea, creatinine, AST, ALT, ALP, GGT, LDH), via midazolam-ketamine anesthesia in dogs. However, significant decrease of hematocrit percentage was observed (Gülanber et al. ). Our results only revealed significant decrease of RBCs, WBCs, PCV, and lymphocytes after injection of ketamine combined with midazolam in domestic cats. Decrease in PCV could be caused by the pooling of the circulating blood cells in the spleen or other reservoirs secondary to decreased sympathetic activity after administration of tranquilizers (Soliman et al. ). The decrease in PCV during sedation could also be caused by the movement of fluids from extravascular compartment to intravascular compartment to maintain normal cardiac output in animals after administration of sedatives (Kilic ). Decrease in WBCs, lymphocytes, and blood glucose as stress factors confirmed the sedative effects of ketamine-midazolam combination in the evaluated cats.
Based on the results of the present experiment, low doses of ketamine combined with midazolam administered IM produce sufficient sedation with a relative stable status in biochemical parameters in the domestic cats for non-invasive clinical procedures.
