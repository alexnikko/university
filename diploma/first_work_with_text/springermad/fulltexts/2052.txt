Introduction
Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) constitutes 0.5–1% of total strokes with a difference in its etiology, demography, evaluation, clinical presentation, and outcome. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis should be suspected in relevant clinical situation, because it is easy to diagnose and rewarding to treat. The prevalence of CVST has been reported to be higher in puerperium in the developing countries especially in India and Pakistan [ , ]. Many of these studies were conducted before the screening of prothrombotic conditions [factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A and methyl tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene mutation, homocysteine, protein C, and protein S assay] that were widely available. The more recent studies from developing nations have also shown association of these conditions in puerperal CVST [ , ]. In the western countries, association of oral contraceptives with these prothrombotic conditions has been shown to increase the risk of CVST many folds compared to the controls [ , ]. The multiplicity of risk factors may increase the severity of CVST such as involvement of multiple sinuses, parenchymal lesion, neurological severity and death or disability. The usefulness of risk calculation for predicting outcome of CVST has been reported [ , , ]. There is paucity of studies evaluating the effect of risk factors on severity and outcome of CVST. In a study on 56 patients with CVST, 19 (34%) had brain lesions and the extent of sinus thrombosis was related to brain lesions. Age, gender, and acquired or hereditary prothrombotic conditions were not associated with the risk of parenchymal lesions. Functional outcomes were also not related to extent of CVST and parenchymal lesions [ ]. In another study, older age, male gender, and those with motor deficit, early intracerebral hemorrhage, deep CVST, and right lateral sinus involvement were at higher risk for death or dependency at 6 months [ ]. These studies however did not correlate burden of etiological risk factors of CVST with clinico-radiological severity. In this study, we, therefore, report the role of burden of risk factors in determining the clinico-radiological severity and outcome of CVST.
Subjects and Methods
Consecutive patients with CVST admitted to the neurology service of a tertiary teaching hospital in India during 2006–2015 were included. The patients with rhinocerebral or otocerebral fungal infection underwent surgery and their detail records were not available for review, therefore, patients with fungal infections were excluded. All the patients were examined by at least two of the investigators (JK and UKM). This study was approved by the Institute Ethics committee. The diagnosis of CVST was confirmed by MR venography or digital subtraction angiography.
Clinical Evaluation
The data were analyzed retrospectively from a prospectively maintained CVST registry. The demographic information (age, gender, and vegetarianism) and clinical details were recorded. The duration of illness and presenting symptoms such as headache, vomiting, seizures, focal deficit, visual impairment, diplopia, altered sensorium, somnolence, and cognitive impairment were noted. History of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, oral contraceptives, vasculitis (arthralgia, skin rash, and oral ulcers), jaundice, ascites, edema, para nasal infection, fever, hematological, and other malignancies were noted. History of nephrotic syndrome, diabetes, hypotension, and hyperlipidemia were also recorded. Presence of seizure and status epilepticus was noted. The presenting syndromes were categorized as (1) raised intracranial pressure, (2) encephalopathy, (3) stroke like illness, and (4) isolated headache [ ].
Findings on general physical and systemic examination were noted. Presence of papilledema and cranial nerve palsy were recorded. Consciousness at admission was assessed by Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). Focal motor deficit was categorized as monoparesis, hemiparesis, or quadriparesis and degree of weakness was graded as per Medical Research Council (MRC) scale [ ]. Muscle tone and tendon reflexes were noted, and sensations and cerebellar signs were assessed in the patients who could cooperate. Meningeal signs, paranasal, and mastoid tenderness were also recorded.
Investigations
Blood counts, hemoglobin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate at 1 hour, fasting and postprandial blood sugar, serum creatinine, bilirubin, transaminases, protein, albumin, and electrolytes were measured. Thyroid function tests were done in clinically indicated patients. Collagen vascular markers [antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-ds DNA, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)], Hb1Ac, and lipid profile were measured. Prothrombotic conditions such as factor V Leiden, antithrombin III (G20210A), and MTHFR (C677T) polymorphism, protein C, protein S, fasting plasma homocysteine (Hcy), and antiphospholipid antibody (APLA) were assayed. For defining APLA syndrome, APLA was measured twice 12 weeks apart. Hyperhomocysteinemia was considered if fasting plasma homocysteine level was more than 15 μmol/L. The blood was drawn before heparin treatment and sent for prothrombotic markers. Functional assays of protein C, protein S, and antithrombin III were repeated later when patient was off anticoagulation if their values were low in acute stage. MTHFR mutation in the absence of hyperhomocysteinemia was not considered as a prothrombotic marker. In the patients with suspected vasculitis or renal disease, 24 h proteinuria was measured. D dimer was measured in 69 patients and was positive in 38 (29.7%). Bone marrow examination was done in the patients with anemia, and suspected multiple myeloma and leukemia. Anemia was defined if hemoglobin (Hb) level was < 12 g/dl in females, and < 13 g/dl in males. The patients were also screened for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria in clinically suspected patients. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis was done in the patients with meningoencephalitis.
Risk Factor Categorization
The risk factors were categorized as (1) prothrombotic [protein C/S, antithrombin III, factor V Leiden mutation, MTHFR, homocysteine, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)/APLA], (2) female specific (oral contraceptive, puerperium, pregnancy), (3) infections, (4) hematological (anemia, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, polycythemia, and thrombocythemia), (5) cancer related, (6) systemic (nephrotic syndrome, Behcet disease), and (7) unknown [ ]. The patients were grouped into prothrombotic conditions alone, prothrombotic plus, and no prothrombotic condition but had other risk factor and unknown. The sum of risk factors was also calculated in an individual patient.
MRI and MR Venography
Cranial MRI findings were noted including evidence of sinus/vein thrombosis and parenchymal lesions (infarct, hemorrhagic infarct, and hematoma). On MR venography, the location and number of sinuses involved were also noted.
Treatment
The patients were treated with unfractionated heparin (UFH) 80 IU/kg intravenously bolus followed by 18 IU/kg/h infusion to maintain activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) at 2–2.5 times of control value or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH; enoxaparin) in a dose 1 mg/kg subcutaneously 12 hourly for 2 weeks [ ]. This was followed by oral anticoagulant (acenocoumarol) to maintain INR between 2 and 3. Anticoagulant therapy was usually continued for 3–6 months except in the patients with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, malignancy, and homozygous factor V Leiden or prothrombin gene mutation. The patients with seizure were prescribed antiepileptic drugs (levetiracetam, lacosamide or clobazam), and those with status epilepticus were treated with lorazepam intravenously (0.1 mg/kg). Patients with severe headache and features of raised intracranial pressure were prescribed acetazolamide and mannitol. The specific treatment of underlying disease was offered. Supportive treatment included maintenance of fluid, electrolyte, and calorie management. International normalized ratio (INR) was monitored during the visit, and monthly monitoring was done over the telephone.
Outcome
Outcome was defined at 1 and 3 months on the basis of modified Rankin Scale (mRS), and categorized as poor (mRS > 2) and good (mRS ≤ 2) [ ].
Statistical Analysis
The patients with prothrombotic etiology only were compared with prothrombotic plus and idiopathic groups using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or a Chi-square test with respect to demographic, clinical severity of CVST, MRI lesions, and number of sinuses involved. Presence of parenchymal lesion was compared with sinus involved, etiology of CVST, and outcome using the Chi-square test. The outcome at 1 and 3 months was compared using univariate regression followed by multivariate analysis. The variables having a P value of < 0.1 in univariate analysis were included in the multivariate analysis. The statistical analysis was done using SPSS 16 version software, and variable with a two-tailed P value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.
Results
There were 128 patients with CVST, whose median age was 29 (range 3–76) years; 12 (17.7%) were children (< 18 years), and 3 (9%) were elderly (> 65 years). Sixty-six (51.6%) patients were females. The median duration of illness was 16.5 (range 1–74) days. The presenting symptoms were headache in 119 (93%), vomiting in 93 (72.7%), and altered sensorium in 72 (56.3%) patients. Seizures were present in 74 (57.8%), and 18 (24.3%) of whom had status epilepticus. Focal neurological deficit at presentation was noted in 69 (53.9%)—hemiparesis in 52, quadriparesis in 8, monoparesis in 4, and hemianopia in 5 patients. Papilloedema was present in 38 (29.7%). Median GCS score was 14 (3–15) and was ≤ 8 in 20 (15.6%) patients (Supplementary Table S1 ).
The presenting symptoms could be categorized as stroke like in 69 (53.9%), isolated headache in 19 (14.8%), encephalopathy in 28 (21.9%), and raised intracranial pressure in 12 (9.4%) patients.
MRI Findings
MRI revealed parenchymal lesion in 94 (73.4%) patients, infarction in 24, and hemorrhagic infarction in 70. The lesions were in frontal region in 37, parietal in 51, temporal in 28, occipital in 28, basal ganglia in 5, thalamus in 8, brainstem in 4, and cerebellum in 5 patients.
MR Venography
On MRV, the number of thrombosed sinuses ranged between 1 and 6 (median 2). In 35 patients, more than 2 sinuses were involved. The isolated superficial system was involved in 100 (84.4%) patients, deep in 6 (4.7%), and both superficial and deep in 14 (10.9%). Superior sagittal sinus and transverse sinuses were involved in 62.5% each followed by sigmoid sinus in 42.2%, straight sinus in 15.6%, inferior sagittal sinus in 3.1%, and vein of Galen in 2.3% patients. Cortical veins were thrombosed in 6 (4.7%) patients (Fig. 1 ). Fig. 1 The frequency of site of thrombosis on MR venography
Risk Factors
Eighty-two patients had prothrombotic state (hyperhomocysteinemia 41, protein S deficiency 44, protein C deficiency 17, APLA syndrome 19, antithrombin III deficiency 4, and factor V Leiden mutation in 3), female specific in 22, infection in 20, other hematological disorders in 4, and systemic and cancer related in 3 patients. In 26 (20.3%) patients, no risk factor could be identified. Sixteen out of 22 patients with female gender-specific risk factors also had other prothrombotic conditions which included protein S deficiency in 11, protein C deficiency in 1, antiphospholipid antibody in 3, and factor V Leiden mutation in 1 patient (Supplementary Table S2 ). The association of risk factors with prothrombotic state is presented in Table 1 .

Correlation of Risk Factor
Based on the risk factors at admission, the patients were categorized into group I (prothrombotic conditions only in 46), group II (prothrombotic state with other risk factors in 36), group III (no risk factors in 26), and group IV (non-prothrombotic risk factors in 20). On comparing these groups, the demographic, clinical presentation, and severity of neurological deficit did not reveal any difference except gender. Group I patients were mostly males (69.6%) whereas group II were mostly females (80.6%). Group II patients had female gender-specific etiologies in 19 (52.8%) patients. Group III and group IV patients had equal proportion of males and females. Group II and group IV patients had insignificantly longer hospital stay ( P = 0.08). On MRI, the presence of parenchymal lesion was not significantly different between the four groups, although group II patients had higher frequency of parenchymal lesion (80.6%). The number of sinuses thrombosed, and deep versus superficial sinus involvement were also not significantly different between the groups (Table 2 ). Both superficial and deep sinuses were involved in group IV in 35%, which was significantly higher compared to other groups ( P = 0.002). On repeat assay, protein C became normal in 42.8% and protein S in 60% patients who had low levels at admission. Risk factors as well as location and number of sinuses involved were not significantly different between the patients with and without parenchymal lesion (Table 3 ).

Outcome
In our study, 16 (12.5%) patients died. At the time of discharge, 31(24.2%) patients had poor outcome which was worse in group IV (50%) followed by group II (22.2%) and group I (19.6%), and least in group III (15.4%). Poor outcome at discharge (50%) and death (30%) was more in group IV when compared to other groups ( P = 0.03 and 0.04, respectively). At 3 months, outcome measures were available in 122 patients, 25 (20.5%) had poor which was worst in group IV (40%) and best in group III (11.5%).
The burden of risk factor was not related to demographic, severity of clinical presentation, radiological findings, and outcome. On univariate analysis, the outcome at discharge was related to age ( P = 0.02), status epilepticus ( P = 0.01), altered sensorium ( P = 0.002), mechanical ventilation ( P < 0.001), focal deficit ( P < 0.001), and supratentorial lesion ( P = 0.02). These variables remained as significant predictors even at 3 months (Table 4 ). On multivariate analysis, age (OR 1.05, 95%CI 1.00–1.09, P = 0.03), GCS score (OR 5.30, 95%CI 1.25–22.24, P = 0.02), and mechanical ventilation (OR 196.17, 95%CI 16.05, P = 0.001) predicted the outcome at 3 months after adjusting focal deficit, status epilepticus, and parenchymal lesion.

Discussion
In the present study, the burden of risk factors did not influence the clinico-radiological severity, and outcome of patients with CVST. Prothrombotic condition was the commonest risk factor, and one-fifth patients did not have any risk factor of CVST. Extremes of age, depth of coma, and need of mechanical ventilation were poor predictors of outcome at 3 months.
This study for the first time reports the relationship of burden of risk factors with clinico-radiological severity and outcome of CVST. In our study, the prevalence of prothrombotic condition was higher (64.1 vs 34.1%) and OCP lower (3.9 vs 54.1%) compared to the study by Ferro et al. The higher prevalence of prothrombotic condition in our study may be due to higher prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia (32 vs 4.5%) and APLA (14.8 vs 5.9%) in our study compared to Ferro et al. [ ]. The prevalence of various prothrombotic conditions varies in different studies—factor V Leiden 0–25% [ , ], G20210A 8.9–30% [ , ], and hyperhomocysteinemia 11.6–43.3% [ , , ]. Hyperhomocysteinemia may be due to deficiency of vitamin B12 as a result of vegetarian diet on religious ground or may have a genetic basis, which needs further evaluation. Commoner occurrence of CVST in females has been reported by some investigators [ , ]. In our study, about 50% patients were males, which may be due to lower frequency of female gender-specific causes and lack of obstetric department in our institute.
In a meta-analysis, the risk of various prothrombotic conditions and its interaction with oral contraceptive has been evaluated in comparison with the controls. The odds of developing CVST in the patients on oral contraceptive were 5.5, factor V Leiden mutation 3.38, prothrombin gene (G2210A) mutation 9.27, and hyperhomocysteinemia 4.07 compared to the controls [ ]. Oral contraceptive with hyperhomocysteinemia increases the odds of CVST to 19.5, with factor V Leiden mutation to 30 and prothrombin gene mutation to 79.3 compared to the controls [ , ]. The odds of CVST in patients with protein C deficiency was 11.1 and protein S deficiency 12.5 compared to the controls [ , ]. In the patients with CVST, the frequency of anticardiolipin antibodies ranges between 5.9% and 22.6%, which is higher than the controls (3.2%) [ , ].
The increased number of risk factors may increase the risk of developing CVST, but may not increase the clinical severity and extent of MRI findings. It is conceivable, that the clinical severity depends on the strategic location of thrombus, rapidity of occlusion, timing of study, and collateral formation rather than the risk factors only. We have mainly focused on the CVST; however, the severity and outcome may also be determined by systemic venous thrombosis such as hepatic, pulmonary, and deep venous sinus thrombosis. One patient each in our study with factor V Leiden and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria had Budd-Chiari syndrome. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis generally has a good outcome and mortality ranges between 3 and 15% [ , , ]. In our study, 12.5% died and 80.5% patients had good outcome at 3 months. Irrespective of etiology of CVST, the treatment is similar (IV followed by oral anticoagulation); therefore, the underlying etiology may not affect the short-term outcome. Recurrence of CVST may however be higher in the patients with multiple or more potent prothrombotic conditions, but there is no large study because of rarity of this condition compared to other types of stroke.
The present study has some limitations; it has been conducted in a tertiary care teaching hospital where most severe and complicated patients are referred. We have excluded fungal infections because majority were treated by neurosurgeon and were not in our follow-up.
It can be concluded from this study that burden of risk factors does not affect the clinical severity, MRI findings, extent of MRV abnormality, and outcome.
