Introduction
Radioactive isotopes like 99m Tc, 111 In, 69 Ga, and 201 Tl are used in nuclear medicine for diagnosis [ ]. 99m Tc is one of the most desirable radionuclides in diagnostic nuclear medicine due to the emission of γ-ray of optimal energy (140 Kev), a suitable half-life time (6 h) and availability from 99 Mo- 99m Tc generator systems and its versatility to form varieties of complexes [ , , ]. Generally, radioactive nuclei are not directly injected into the body. Some chelating compounds are used to bind the nuclear isotope, which carries it to various organs under studies. This in turn leads to the development of large number of custom-tailored ligands which have many applications in nuclear medicine [ ].
The development of 99m Tc radiopharmaceuticals for imaging various organs was focused in 1970 [ , ]. Hexakis-isonitrile 99m-technetium(I) complex is currently used as myocardial perfusion agent [ ]. 99m-technetium phosphonate (IV) complexes are used as bone imaging agent. 99m-technetium diethylenetriaminepentaacetate (IV and V) (DTPA) and 99m-technetium ethylcystinate(V) (EC) are used as renal imaging agents. Sodiumpertechnetate (VII) is used as thyroid imaging agent and 99m-technetium dimercaptosuccinate (V and III) are used as soft tissue tumors and renal imaging agents, respectively [ ]. Different types of macrocyclic ligands, with N 4 , N 2 S 2 , and N 3 S types, were used as myocardial and central nervous system perfusion agents [ , ]. Some 99m Tc complexes with the ligands like propyleneamine oxime (N 4 ), bis(thiosemicarbazone) (N 2 S 2 ) which could cross the blood brain barrier are used as brain imaging agents. In nuclear imaging, organ specificity is improved by using bifunctional chelating agents, natural biomolecules like proteins and peptides, organometallic compounds, stereo isomers like diaminodithiolate (N 2 S 2 ) [ , ]. In the present work, interest is extended to check the organ specificity towards a stereo isomer, d-ritalinic acid.
Ritalinic acid is a major metabolite of a drug methylphenidate, which is used for the treatment of narcolepsy, depression, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children. Being a metabolite of a drug, it can be taken up easily by the organs in our body. Among stereoisomers, l-isomers are known to be active in living organisms and d-isomers are considered as waste products in pharmaceutical industries. Importance is given to study the activity of d-isomer. In the present work, dl-ritalinic acid was synthesized, and d- and l- isomers were separated by resolution using resolving agent [ ]. The d-isomer was characterized and purity was confirmed by HPLC. The dRA was radiolabeled with 99m Tc-sodiumpertechnetate and the efficiency of radiolabeling was optimized at various reaction time, pH, amount of ligand, reducing agent, and antioxidant. Biodistribution studies in Wistar rats were carried out with d-isomer ( 99m Tc-dRA) and the uptake of the injected radiotracer in different organs was quantified based on region of interest method and results were compared with commercial renal imaging agents ( 99m Tc-DTPA and 99m Tc-EC).
Materials and Methods
99m Tc was eluted from isorad 99 Mo/ 99m Tc generator in 0.9% NaCl solution. All the required chemicals such as conc. HCl, acetone, stannous chloride dihydrate, ascorbic acid, 2-chloropyridine, benzylcyanide, KOH, dil.H 2 SO 4 , NH 4 OH, Pd/C, and acetic acid were purchased from Ranbaxy chemicals and were used directly without any further purification. Whatman-3 filter paper was used for ascending paper chromatography. FTIR spectrum was recorded between 4000 and 400 cm −1 using Shimadzu FTIR spectrometer using KBr pellets. Mass spectrum was recorded using LC/MS agilent 1200 series with 6110-single quadrapole ESI detector. The purity of the synthesized compound has been confirmed in HPLC LC-2010, LC-2010AHT, and LC10ATVP with SPD-M10A detector using INERTSIL ODS-3V-HPLC Column. The flow rate of the sample in the column was 1 ml/min for 30 min run time at a detection wavelength of 230 nm. The 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra were collected on VNMRS-400 spectrometer in DMSO ( d 6) at room temperature. The radiochemical yield of the complex was analyzed by ascending paper chromatography using 0.9% saline and acetone as solvents. The amount of radioactivity was assessed in CRC 15R capintec dose calibrator in 99m Tc window.
Synthesis and Resolution of dl-Ritalinic Acid
The dl-ritalinic acid was synthesized in five steps as reported [ ] and the schematic synthetic route is given in Scheme 1 (yield 43%, melting point 209–211 °C). The resolution of dl-ritalinic acid using the resolving agent, (+)-dibenzoyl-D-tartaric acid, was carried out based on the reported procedure [ , ] and d-ritalinic acid was obtained in a pure form which was confirmed by HPLC analysis (yield 79.1%, melting point 238–240 °C). The spectroscopic analyses of the synthesized dRA were compared with the reported data; it showed almost similar peaks in IR (Fig. S1 ), mass (Fig. S2 ), and NMR (Figs. S3 and S4 ) spectrums.

Formulation of 99mTc-dRA Complex
Formulation of the labeled complex was carried out under sterile conditions in a laminar flow hood sterilized with absolute alcohol and UV light. Labeling of dRA with 99m Tc was carried out by the addition of required amount of 99m Tc into a sealed and lead shielded vial containing the ligand, SnCl 2 and ascorbic acid based on the evaluation of the percent labeling efficiency which was evaluated by ascending paper chromatography using Whatmann filter paper No: 3 in acetone and saline medium.
The % labeling efficiency of the reaction was optimized by different factors such as reaction time (15 min–8 h), concentration of ligand (dRA (2.5–15 mg)), amount of reducing agent (0.5–3.5 mg), amount of anti-oxidant (5–25 mg), and pH (3–7). The experiment was reprised by keeping all the factors constant except the factor under study, till the maximum labeling was achieved. In the process of optimization, trials were performed five times parallel in identical conditions for each factor till optimum value was obtained. The average values of the five trials were plotted. Highly reproducible results were obtained in all the trials.
In Vitro Stability of 99mTc-dRA Complex
The in vitro stability of the labeled complexes was estimated with blood serum protein. Aliquots at different time intervals from 15 min to 8 h at room temperature were taken for ascending paper chromatographic analysis in both acetone and saline medium. Percentage of free pertechnetate (%F) and % of hydrolyzed pertechnetate (%H) or 99m Tc-colloid were obtained from acetone and saline chromatogram [ ], respectively. The procedure was reprised in triplets and the average timing was stabilized.
Biodistribution and Quantitative Analysis
The biodistribution studies of 99m Tc-dRA was carried out in male Wistar rats weighing 180–200 g which were anesthetized using diethyl ether, and the study was carried out in dynamic mode in 256 × 256 matrix and 2.56 zoom factor keeping the rat in supine position under the GE Hawkeye dual head SPECT-CT gamma camera. The commercial renal imaging agents were supplied by BRIT, Board of Radio Isotope Technology, Government of India, which was reconstituted with 25 mCi of Na 99m TcO 4 in 1 ml of 0.1 N NaCl solution to obtain colorless clear solution with pH 6.5–7 and above 95% of labeling efficiency. The biodistribution studies were carried out by injecting 0.1 ml of the reconstituted 99m Tc-dRA, 99m Tc-DTPA, and 99m Tc-EC solution intravenously into the left leg of the rat containing 100–150 μCi (4070–5550 kBq) radioactivity.
Results and Discussion
Purity Using HPLC Analysis
HPLC analysis was carried out using disodium hydrogen orthophosphate buffer, acetonitrile, and absolute alcohol (98:1:1 volume) as the mobile phase and two components were eluted, i.e., d and l isomers with 2.66 and 5.04 min of retention time, respectively (Fig. S5 ). The area and the area percentage of both the components are given in Table 1 . HPLC analysis confirmed the purity of the synthesized d-ritalinic acid as 99.986 and 0.014% impurity of l-ritalinic acid.

Radiochemical Purity and Optimization of % Labeling Efficiency
Radiochemical purity of the labeled complexes was evaluated by ascending paper chromatography and was found to be 95.65 ± 3.36%, based on the average value of five trials (Table 2 ) and stable up to 6 h at room temperature. Table 2 Concentration level of the reagents used in the labeled complexes Reagent Concentration Range Optimized level Reaction time 0–8 h 30 mts Ligand solution dRA, EC, DTPA 2.5–15 mg/ml 10 mg/ml SnCl 2 0.5–3.5 mg/ml 2.5 mg/ml Ascorbic acid 5–25 mg/ml 20 mg/ml pH 3–7 6
Effect of Reaction Time
The influence of reaction time (Fig. 1 a) on the % labeling yield of 99m Tc-dRA was investigated by keeping other parameters (amount of ligand, reducing agent, anti-oxidant, and pH) constant as it is given in Table 2 . Radiochemical yield was found to increase significantly from 58 to 84% with increase in time from 15 to 30 min and then remained constant for about 6 h. The minimum optimum time was fixed for 30 min for all the experiments.

Effect of Concentration of Ligand
The effect of amount of dRA (Fig. 1 b) was determined in a range of 2.5 to 15 mg in 1 ml of double distilled water keeping other parameters (reducing agent, anti-oxidant, and pH) constant for 30 min of reaction time. The percent labeling yield increased with increasing the concentration of dRA until it reached its maximum yield (85%) at 10 mg of dRA and remains constant thereafter.
Effect of Reducing Agent (SnCl2·2H2O)
The variation of % binding on reducing agent (Fig. 1 c) was determined in the range of 0.5 to 3.5 mg keeping other parameters (amount of ligand, anti-oxidant, and pH) constant for 30 min of reaction time. Less amount of reducing agent may lead to incomplete reduction of free 99m TcO 4 − due to which unreliable yield of the complexes were obtained. By increasing the amount of reducing agent up to 2.5 mg, the % labeling yield increased above which there was a decrease in the labeling yield. High amount of reducing agent increases formation of 99m Tc-colloid content due to which the complex formation decreased.
Effect of Anti-oxidant (Ascorbic Acid)
The effect of anti-oxidant (Fig. 1 d) was studied in the range of 5 to 25 mg in 0.5 ml of double distilled water keeping other parameters (amount of ligand, reducing agent and pH) constant for 30 min of reaction time. No labeling was observed in the absence of anti-oxidant. On increasing the anti-oxidant content up to 20 mg ( 99m Tc-dRA), the % labeling yield was increased above which there was no significant effect.
Effect of pH
The influence of pH (Fig. 1 e) on the % labeling yield was studied by increasing the pH from 3 to 7 keeping other parameters (amount of ligand, reducing agent, and anti-oxidant) constant as the optimized value for 30 min of reaction time. The labeling yield of 99m Tc-dRA complex increased with the increase in the pH till 5.5 to 6.5 above which the percent labeling yield decreased due to increase in the formation of 99m Tc-colloid.
By optimizing all the factors affecting the labeling yield of 99m Tc-dRA, the highest labeling yield (95.65 ± 3.36%) was formed with 10 mg dRA, 2.5 mg reducing agent (SnCl 2 ·2H 2 O), 20 mg anti-oxidant (ascorbic acid) at pH of 5.5–6.5 after 30 min of reaction time.
Biodistribution Studies and Quantitative Analysis
The dynamic mode biodistribution studies of the complex ( 99m Tc-dRA) in two phases at the rate of 15 s/frame for 2 and 2 min/frame for 30 min was carried out in male Wistar rats. The % uptake of injected complex in different organs at different intervals of time up to 30 min were analyzed quantitatively by calculating target to non-target (T/NT) counts of various regions of interest (ROI) in the heart, liver, lung, stomach, kidney, urinary bladder, soft tissue, etc. (Table 3 ; Figs. 2 and 3 ) which showed uptake in all vascular structures such as the heart, liver, and lymph tissue and high T/NT counts of the complex were seen in the left and right kidneys in 10 min showing high organ specificity.

The pharmacokinetic in vitro stability (Table 4 ) of the complex ( 99m Tc-dRA) was analyzed in serum proteins of human blood by adding 10 mCi of 99m Tc-dRA to blood which is incubated for 6 h and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10–15 min and the serum was separated to develop chromatogram. Radioactivity measured in the sediment containing RBC showed no radioactivity and the paper chromatography of the serum sample revealed the stability of the labeled complex up to 6 h.

The biodistribution studies of the synthesized complex ( 99m Tc-dRA) were compared with 99m Tc-DTPA and 99m Tc-EC (Fig. 4 and Table 5 ), the commercial renal imaging agents. The images were acquired for 25 min for 99m Tc-EC and for 30 min for 99m Tc-DTPA at the rate of 5 min/frame in dynamic mode keeping the parameters same as for the 99m Tc-dRA. All the three 99m Tc-complexes showed similar pattern of perfusion, cortical uptake and clearance phases. The activity of synthesized complex ( 99m Tc-dRA) was comparable with 99m Tc-DTPA and 99m Tc-EC. Initially, the uptake of complexes was increased in all organs, and after a time period, it was decreased except in urinary bladder. The uptake of 99m Tc-DTPA, 99m Tc-EC, and 99m Tc-dRA was decreased in all organs after 25, 20, and 21 min respectively, which indicates that the synthesized complex showed activity equal to the commercial renal imaging agents.

Conclusion
dl-Ritalinic acid was synthesized from benzylcyanide and 2-chloropyridine in a five-step process and d and l isomers were separated by resolution. The d-ritalinic acid was characterized by NMR, FTIR, and mass spectral analysis and the purity of the synthesized ligand was analyzed using HPLC. The in vitro stability of 99m Tc-dRA was studied in serum proteins of human blood and was found to be stable for about 6 h at room temperature. The optimum conditions for maximum % binding of 99m Tc-dRA after 30 min were evaluated by varying the concentration of ligand, reducing agent, anti-oxidant, and pH of the reaction medium and were in the ratio 1:4:0.5 of ligand (dRA), ascorbic acid and stannous chloride dihydrate at pH range of 5.5–6.5. Radiochemical purity was evaluated using ascending paper chromatography and was found to be 95.65 ± 3.36% for 99m Tc-dRA. Biodistribution studies on Wistar rats showed high uptake in the region of kidneys which was comparable with that of commercially available renal imaging agents ( 99m Tc-DTPA and 99m Tc-EC). The synthesized complex, 99m Tc-dRA, showed almost similar pattern of perfusion, cortical uptake, and clearance phase as that of commercially available renal imaging agents with clear images in early stages and is harmless as it is a metabolite of drug already taken up by body organs.
