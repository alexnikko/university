Background
Stroke is a devastating and debilitating disease, which constitutes the leading cause of death in China, and the second leading cause of death globally [ ]. Ischemic stroke, due to embolic or thrombotic occlusion of an intracerebral artery, is the most common type of stroke, accounting for 87% of all strokes [ , ]. During the past two decades, the burden of ischemic stroke has increased significantly worldwide, especially in low-income and middle-income countries [ ]. Patients who suffer an acute stroke are at a high risk for recurrence [ , ]. For stroke survivors, recurrent stroke and cardiac events post-stroke are major contributors to disability and mortality [ , ]. In China, in patients with noncardioembolic ischemic stroke, the cumulative 1-year event rates were 18% for combined vascular events and 16% for recurrent stroke [ ].
Fortunately, antiplatelet agents have been demonstrated to substantially decrease the risk of recurrent vascular events in patients with noncardioembolic stroke [ ], as recommended by the guidelines for the secondary prevention of stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) [ , ]. However, guidelines have been somewhat unclear concerning the optimal antiplatelet therapy, regarding aspirin, clopidogrel, and dipyridamole-aspirin as acceptable treatment alternatives [ , ]. Clopidogrel is more efficacious in reducing cardiovascular events than aspirin, as shown in the clopidogrel vs. aspirin in patients at risk of ischemic events (CAPRIE) trial [ ]. The results revealed an 8.7% decrease in favor of clopidogrel for the combined endpoint of ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, and vascular death, as well as a reduction in gastrointestinal bleeding [ ]. However, in terms of cost, aspirin is much less expensive than clopidogrel. The cost of medication is one of the major challenges affecting patient adherence, which might be related to treatment failure. In a recent study using the Beijing Medical Insurance Database, the cost of antiplatelet drugs and rate of recurrence were lower for ischemic stroke patients who used aspirin alone than for patients using both aspirin and clopidogrel [ ]. Consequently, it is necessary to determine whether or not aspirin might constitute a better choice for the secondary prevention of noncardioembolic ischemic stroke in Chinese patients.
Based on several post hoc analyses of the CAPRIE trial, which demonstrated that the benefits of clopidogrel were greater in patients with a history of previous myocardial infarction (MI) or ischemic stroke [ ], diabetic patients [ ], and smokers [ ], the authors developed a risk predictive model, the Essen Stroke Risk Score (ESRS), to determine the risk of vascular death or recurrence of stroke, as well as to optimize treatment regimens. Clopidogrel may be particularly beneficial to patients at high risk, defined as >4%/year for recurrent stroke as assessed by the ESRS, which corresponds to an ESRS > 2, as shown in subgroup analyses of CAPRIE, compared with aspirin [ ]. However, the CAPRIE trial was published 20 years ago, and its clinical significance to the present analysis may be limited. Furthermore, the risk of vascular death or stroke recurrence employing the ESRS model differs in various populations. In the Reduction of Atherothrombosis for Continued Health (REACH) registry, a recurrent stroke risk >4%/year was found to correspond to an ESRS > 3 [ ]. In a prospective cohort study that utilizes data from Chinese patients with TIA or ischemic stroke admitted to 132 hospitals throughout China, both combined vascular events and recurrent stroke were significantly higher than in the CAPRIE trial [ ]. Thus, the current study investigated the associations between ESRS and antiplatelet treatment in Chinese patients with noncardioembolic ischemic stroke.
Materials and Methods
This retrospective study was conducted at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, School of Medicine (SAHZU), which is a tertiary care hospital located in eastern China, with a total capacity of 3200 licensed beds. The Department of Neurology has 150 beds, with approximately 180,000 outpatient visits and 5000 admissions/year. Patients with a hospital discharge diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke or a hospital discharge diagnosis of International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) code 163 from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2011, were considered to be eligible for study enrollment. Acute ischemic stroke was confirmed by magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and clinical symptoms. The exclusion criteria were (1) neurological disorders due to other organic diseases; (2) cardioembolic stroke; (3) hematological disease, current peptic ulceration, or history of systemic bleeding; (4) either no history of taking aspirin for their condition and clopidogrel prescription, or a history of taking both aspirin and clopidogrel prescription; (5) terminal malignancy, serious renal or liver disease; and (6) intracerebral hemorrhage or hemorrhagic transformation. All included patients received follow-up telephone interviews from July 1, 2014, to December 31, 2015 by trained pharmacists who were unaware of the baseline characteristics of individual patients. Our institutional ethics committee approved our study protocol.
Data Collection
Patient baseline demographics (i.e., year of birth, gender), cigarette smoking status, history of hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke or TIA, or peripheral arterial disease (PAD) prior to enrollment, and discharge antiplatelet drugs were determined from a review of patient medical records. Antiplatelet drugs included aspirin (100 mg/day) and clopidogrel (75 mg/day). The ESRS was calculated from prospectively collected data. Table 1 presents the components of the score. Table 1 Characteristics of the Essen Stroke Risk Score (ESRS) Variables ESRS Age 65–75 = 1, >75 = 2 Arterial hypertension 1 Diabetes mellitus 1 Smoking 1 Prior TIA/stroke 1 Peripheral arterial disease 1 Prior MI 1 Other cardiovascular disease, excluding MI and AF 1 TIA transient ischemic attack, MI myocardial infarction, AF atrial fibrillation
Outcome
The primary outcomes of the study were combined vascular events, which were classified as fatal and non-fatal events due to recurrent stroke, MI, or primary intracranial hemorrhage. The secondary outcomes were antiplatelet drug adherence and adverse drug events.
Statistical Analyses
Statistical analyses were conducted using the SPSS statistical software (version 20; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Categorical variables were reported as percentages and compared using the chi-square test. Because ESRS = 3 indicated a different risk of vascular death or stroke recurrence in different studies [ , ], patients were here separated into three categories according to the ESRS (<3, =3, and >3). Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of aspirin vs. clopidogrel antiplatelet therapy on combined vascular events after adjustment for age, gender, and coadministration of statin and discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy prior to follow-up. All tests were two-tailed, and P < 0.05 was assumed to be statistically different.
Results
Patient Population
Between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2011, 1175 non-cardiac stroke patients were included, among which 878 patients completed follow-up surveys from July 1, 2014, to December 31, 2015. There were no significant differences between patients with and without follow-up with regard to risk factors and baseline clinical characteristics (Table 2 ). Besides stroke, hypertension was quantitatively the most important risk factor for cardiovascular disease.

The mean age of the 878 patients who completed follow-up was 63.2 ± 13.1 years. Among them, 458 (52.2%) patients had an ESRS > 3, and 621 (70.7%) patients received aspirin. The baseline clinical characteristics and risk factors of the patients with different antiplatelet drugs are shown in Table 3 . Patients who received clopidogrel tended to be older, and more patients had hypertension, diabetes, and an ESRS > 3 than patients who received aspirin.

Combined Vascular Events
After a mean follow-up of 5.2 years, the combined vascular event rate was 16.7% in the clopidogrel-treated group and 19.3% in the aspirin-treated group (Table 4 ). In addition, combined vascular event rates increased significantly for patients from lower to higher ESRS score categories (10.1, 16.1, and 23.1%, P < 0.001). In patients with ESRS < 3, the unadjusted analysis found no significant difference in combined vascular events between aspirin and clopidogrel (10.6 vs. 7.4%, OR 1.5; 95% CI 0.3 to 6.8; P = 0.873). In patients with ESRS = 3, the unadjusted analysis showed a significant difference regarding combined vascular events in patients who took aspirin than in those who took clopidogrel (12.6% vs. 24.0%, OR 0.5; 95% CI 0.2 to 0.9; P = 0.025). When the two groups were merged into patients with ESRS ≤ 3, significantly fewer combined vascular events were observed in patients who took aspirin than in patients who took clopidogrel (11.1% vs. 19.6%, OR 0.5; 95% CI 0.3 to 0.9; P = 0.026). However, in patients with ESRS > 3, the unadjusted analysis revealed significantly more combined vascular events in patients who took aspirin than in those who took clopidogrel (27.4% vs. 14.8%, OR 2.2; 95% CI 1.3 to 3.6; P = 0.003). Similarly, after adjustment for age, gender, and coadministration of statin and discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy, a significant reduction in combined vascular events in aspirin-treated patients was also observed in the ESRS ≤ 3 subgroup (OR 0.5; 95% CI 0.3 to 0.9; P = 0.044), and significantly more combined vascular events were observed in aspirin-treated patients than in the ESRS > 3 subgroup (OR 2.2; 95% CI 1.3 to 3.8; P = 0.002).

Antiplatelet Drug Adherence and Adverse Drug Events
Table 5 presents the proportion of patients reporting discontinued antiplatelet drugs and experiencing adverse drug reactions. More patients discontinued clopidogrel than aspirin in patients with ESRS < 3 and ESRS = 3 ( P < 0.05). No significant differences of adverse drug events, such as digestive discomfort and bleeding, were found between patients who received clopidogrel and those who received aspirin.

Discussion
The present study showed that clopidogrel therapy achieved a reduction in combined vascular events in patients with an ESRS > 3 compared with aspirin; whereas, an increase in combined vascular events was found in patients with an ESRS ≤ 3 in Chinese patients with noncardioembolic ischemic stroke. These findings suggest that clopidogrel may be preferable to aspirin in patients with an ESRS > 3, and aspirin may be preferred over clopidogrel for patients with an ESRS ≤ 3 for the secondary prevention of noncardioembolic ischemic stroke in Chinese patients.
This study demonstrated that, in patients with ESRS < 3, aspirin was prescribed more often than clopidogrel for the secondary prevention of ischemic stroke. However, in patients with ESRS > 3, physicians tended to prescribe more clopidogrel than aspirin, possibly because the Chinese guidelines recommended clopidogrel over aspirin in patients at high risk for atherothrombosis [ ]. Regarding patients with ESRS = 3, no difference was found in the percentage of patients who took clopidogrel or aspirin.
The results of the current work were slightly different from the results of the CAPRIE trial, which demonstrated that clopidogrel may be more beneficial than aspirin in patients with ESRS > 2 [ ]. This first appeared to be related to the higher discontinuation rate of antiplatelet therapy among clopidogrel-treated patients over aspirin-treated patients among those with ESRS < 3 and ESRS = 3. However, there was still a significant reduction in combined vascular events in aspirin-treated patients in ESRS ≤ 3 after adjustment for discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy. These results identified ESRS = 3, rather than ESRS = 2, to constitute a critical cut-off point for antiplatelet strategy for the secondary prevention of stroke in Chinese patients. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in adverse drug events, such as digestive discomfort or bleeding, between patients who received clopidogrel and patients who received aspirin. These results suggest that patients with ESRS between 2 to 3 could use aspirin for the secondary prevention of ischemic stroke. Consequently, aspirin is suggested to be prescribed for the secondary prevention of noncardioembolic ischemic stroke in Chinese patients with an ESRS ≤ 3, and clopidogrel is suggested to be prescribed for Chinese patients with an ESRS > 3. In China, since the cost of one tablet of clopidogrel is more than 20 times that of aspirin, these results might offer substantial economic value to both individuals and society.
Limitations
The current work has some specific limitations. First, the follow-up information was obtained from only 74.7% of the included patients, which might have affected the combined vascular event rates in the two groups. However, the risk factors and baseline clinical characteristics of patients who did not complete follow-up exhibited no significant differences from those of the patients who completed follow-up. Therefore, a relevant bias because of lost to follow-up seems unlikely. Second, these findings are based on the results of a single-center, retrospective study with a small sample size. The results of the present study should be confirmed in further well-controlled, randomized trials.
Conclusions
In conclusion, risk stratification with the ESRS was found to be acceptably accurate for the prediction of combined vascular events in patients who received antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel or aspirin for the secondary prevention of noncardioembolic ischemic stroke in Chinese patients. Clopidogrel therapy was associated with a reduction in combined vascular events of recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction, or primary intracranial hemorrhage in patients with an ESRS > 3; whereas, more combined vascular events were observed in patients with an ESRS ≤ 3 than in comparable patients who took aspirin. Aspirin is suggested to be prescribed for the secondary prevention of in Chinese patients with an ESRS ≤ 3, and clopidogrel for patients with an ESRS > 3.
