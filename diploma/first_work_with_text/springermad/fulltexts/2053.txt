Introduction
Attention to comorbidity factors is widely recommended for optimal translation of preclinical stroke studies . Protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) is common in stroke patients, yet its prevention and treatment remain unresolved problems [ ]. PEM pre-exists in ~ 12–19% of elderly patients at admission for stroke [ , , ]. Multiple causes include effects of other diseases and decreased food intake due to isolation, depression, and poor mobility in elderly patients [ ]. The frequency of PEM escalates further after stroke due to disability-induced barriers to eating and nutritional support [ ]. While PEM has been associated with poorer functional recovery in stroke patients [ , , ], proof of a cause:effect relationship has been precluded by study limitations. Thus, our primary study objective was to mimic the clinical scenario of PEM pre-existing at stroke onset with preclinical models to investigate the effects on sensori-motor impairments initiated by cortical stroke.
Although the brain processes by which PEM could aggravate stroke-induced functional abnormalities are not fully elucidated, the neuroinflammatory response to stroke is an important target. While uncontrolled inflammatory mediators can increase injury, regulated inflammation and its resolution are also essential for brain repair [ ]. Both attenuated astrocyte and microglia activation [ , , , ] and amplified neuroinflammation [ , ] can adversely affect post-stroke recovery. While pre-existing PEM can lower the set point for neuroinflammation in global brain ischemia [ , ], these results have not been consistently observed [ ]. Decreased immune function in the periphery with PEM is also well described [ ]. Our second study objective was therefore to explore if pre-existing PEM altered the neuroinflammatory response to stroke in the acute period, as evaluated by glial activation. Because shifts in K, Cl, Ca, and Zn homeostasis are associated with neuron death and the glial response [ , , , , , , ], we also used micro-X-ray fluorescence imaging (μXFI) to determine if PEM altered elemental signature changes in the peri-infarct area and infarct rim.
Materials and Methods
Experimental Design
Eleven-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 375–477 g ( n = 22) (Charles River, QC, Canada) were housed in pairs in Plexiglas cages (39.5 cm × 34.6 cm × 22.7 cm) in a temperature- and humidity-controlled room with a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle (07:00–19:00) and ad libitum access to rat chow (Prolab® RMH 3000). The research was approved by the University of Saskatchewan’s Animal Research Ethics Board and adhered to the Canadian Council on Animal Care guidelines for humane animal use.
The rats were acclimatized to a normal protein (NP) purified control diet containing 12.5% protein (Dyets Inc. #1008790) [ ] for 3 days. Rats were then trained on the horizontal ladder walking task for 14 days while remaining on the NP diet [ ]. At 14–15 weeks of age, rats were assigned for 31 days to ad libitum access to either continue on the NP diet ( n = 10) or switch to a low-protein (LP) diet (Dyets Inc. #103271) containing 0.5% protein [ ] ( n = 12). The composition of the two diets is found in Electronic Supplementary Table I .
At 18–19 weeks of age, rats were randomized to either photothrombotic stroke [ ] or sham surgery (Electronic Supplementary Methods ), resulting in four groups: (1) normal protein-stroke (NP-St; n = 5); (2) normal protein-sham (NP-Sh; n = 5); (3) low-protein-stroke (LP-St; n = 7); (4) low-protein-sham (LP-Sh; n = 5). One rat from the NP-St group was excluded due to loss of power to the laser during stroke induction. The stroke was induced on day 28 of diet assignment. The infarct was placed in the caudal area of the forelimb motor cortex (3 × 3 mm 2 ), from + 2 to − 1 mm relative to bregma and 2–5 mm lateral to midline. The effect of PEM on stroke-induced sensori-motor abnormalities was tested by the horizontal ladder walking [ , ] and cylinder [ , ] tasks on the day before and 3 days after stroke.
On post-stroke day 3, anesthetized rats (4% isoflurane; 1 L/min O 2 ) were killed through decapitation, with the head immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen [ ]. The brains were chiseled out from the frozen heads on dry ice and stored at − 80 °C. Six series of adjacent sections (30 and 10 μm thick) were collected from the forelimb motor cortex at 0.7 mm anterior to bregma. Astrocyte, microglia, and elemental distributions were studied by immunofluorescence imaging and μXFI (Electronic Supplementary Methods ). Infarct size was assessed on immunofluorescent-stained sections. Blood was collected by decapitation, and serum was stored at − 80 °C. The remaining body was flushed with intracardially administered saline (0.9%). Liver samples were collected in liquid nitrogen and stored at − 80 °C.
Protein-Energy Status
Body weight, food intake, serum acute phase proteins and corticosterone, and liver lipid content [ ] were measured to assess protein-energy status (Electronic Supplementary Methods ).
Behavioral Tests
On each assessment day, the rats were required to achieve five ladder crossings without multiple stops or hesitations. The rats were video-recorded for further analysis. The foot fault scoring system was used to assess skilled limb use in a horizontal ladder walking task [ , ]. The 7-movement category scale was employed to rate and quantify both forelimb and hind limb use and placement accuracy: (0) total miss; (1) deep slip; (2) slight slip; (3) replacement; (4) correction; (5) partial placement; (6) correct placement . The incidence (%) of each category and total errors (the sum of foot slips and total misses scored as 0, 1, or 2) was expressed relative to total steps scored. Total movement score (average of the 7-movement categories) was also calculated. Each limb was scored and analyzed separately. The experimenter was blinded to experimental group when the video-recordings were viewed for scoring.
Forelimb use asymmetry was assessed in a Plexiglas cylinder (20 cm diameter; 41 cm height) for 5 min. Limb preference was quantified by the numbers of ipsilateral-to-lesion, contralateral-to-lesion, and simultaneous forelimb placements [ ] during initiation, vertical exploration, and termination (landing) activities. An asymmetry score was calculated as follows: $$ \frac{\mathrm{Number}\ \mathrm{of}\ \mathrm{contralateral}-\mathrm{to}-\mathrm{lesion}\ \mathrm{paw}\ \mathrm{touches}+\frac{1}{2}\ \mathrm{Number}\ \mathrm{of}\ \mathrm{simultaneous}\ \mathrm{paw}\ \mathrm{touches}}{\mathrm{Number}\ \mathrm{of}\ \mathrm{total}\ \mathrm{paw}\ \mathrm{placements}}\times 100 $$
The total number of wall touches and rears was counted to quantify spontaneous motor activity.
Brain Inflammation and Infarct Size
Astrocyte and microglia activation was monitored by immunofluorescent double staining of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and vimentin and co-staining of GFAP and anti-CD68 antibody (ED1) (Electronic Supplementary Methods ). Since the effect of PEM on inflammation was studied during the acute post-stroke period, we relied on two major astrocyte intermediate filament proteins, GFAP and vimentin, to delineate the infarct rim from the peri-infarct region. Images were acquired using the ×20 objective (NA 0.75; 0.33 μm/pixel) of an Olympus BX61VS scanning microscope and Olympus XMIO digital camera using VS-ASW FL2.7 software. Exposure times for GFAP, ED1, and DAPI (cell nuclei) channels were 300, 400, and 80 ms, respectively; 250, 300, and 40 ms were used for GFAP, vimentin, and DAPI channels, respectively.
GFAP and ED1 expression was measured in digitized images (NIH ImageJ v1.62). To sample the peri-infarct area, average integrated density (IDV) was measured in ten consecutive regions of interest (ROIs), each of area 100 μm × 1100 μm (width × height) (Fig. 1 c, ROIs 1–10). The border between the core and the infarct rim was identified by a sharp transition of GFAP fluorescence (Fig. 1 a, b). The infarct rim, identified as a tissue band occupied by vimentin + /GFAP − astrocytes, was sampled by measuring the IDV of five consecutive ROIs (Fig. 1 c, ROIs a–e). ROIs incorporated layers II/III to V of the motor cortex forelimb region (Fig. 1 d). Since there was no difference between the two stroke groups in GFAP, ED1, or DAPI fluorescence in ROI #10 at 1000 μm away from the infarct rim (Fig. 1 c), data were normalized to ROI #10 to correct for background staining. Fig. 1 Representative images of immunofluorescence staining of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) ( a ) and colocalization of GFAP and vimentin ( b ) from a rat fed a normal protein diet and exposed to stroke. The distribution of GFAP + and vimentin + /GFAP − astrocytes demarcates the boundary between the peri-infarct area and the infarct rim. The diagram shows the regions of interest (ROIs) sampled in the forelimb motor cortex ( c , gray box in d ) (red = GFAP; green = vimentin)
Because of the brain processing required to obtain accurate μXFI data, the tissue sections were not of adequate quality to determine infarct volume. Therefore, we estimated the infarct core size from its width at the dorsal surface of the brain (Fig. 1 d). The area of the infarct at the core has been shown to be proportional to the infarct volume [ ]. The infarct rim size was estimated by the average rim width at three cortical positions (layer II, mid-cortex, and layer V).
Brain Elemental Analysis by μXFI
Elemental maps (Cl, K, Ca, and Zn) of the forelimb motor cortex were collected using μXFI at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource experimental station 10-2 ( http://www-ssrl.slac.stanford.edu/beamlines/bl10-2/ ); the data were analyzed using Sam’s Microanalysis Toolkit (Electronic Supplementary Methods ). The maps were converted from fluorescence intensity to elemental “concentration” (μg/cm 2 ), using reference standards [ ]. ROIs were defined by overlay of elemental maps with fluorescence images of inflammatory markers. As with the inflammatory markers, the data were normalized to ROI #10 (Fig. 1 c) to correct for variability across different synchrotron experiments.
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed by SPSS and are shown as mean ± SEM. The effect size (Cohen’s d or partial ƞ 2 ) and observed power are also reported for the endpoints of ladder walking and brain inflammation. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. ANOVA was applied to (1) body weight and food intake (three-factorial repeated measures) with time, diet, and stroke as independent variables; (2) behavioral and biochemical measures (two-factorial with diet and stroke as factors); and (3) glial cell and elemental distribution in the LP-St and NP-St groups (two-factorial) to evaluate effects of ROI and diet. Post hoc tests were applied if significant interactions occurred. Infarct size was evaluated by Student’s t test.
Results
Sham group (NP-Sh and LP-Sh) data were previously published for all endpoints [ ], with the exception of those shown here in Fig. 2 (errors on the ladder test) and Fig. 3 (cylinder data).

Protein-Energy Status
The LP diet caused PEM, as documented by significantly decreased body weight (Electronic Supplementary Figure I a), food intake (Electronic Supplementary Figure I b), and serum albumin, and increased serum α2-macroglobulin (A2M) and liver lipid content (Electronic Supplementary Data ). Stroke did not alter any of these indices.
Behavioral Measures
Horizontal Ladder Walking Task
PEM augmented stroke-induced abnormalities in forelimb placement accuracy. The LP-St rats made more errors than the NP-St rats ( P Diet × Stroke Interaction < 0.05; partial ƞ 2 = 0.3; observed power 0.73) (Fig. 2 ); the forelimb fell between rungs after slipping off the rung ( P Diet × Stroke Interaction < 0.05; partial ƞ 2 = 0.23; observed power 0.57). Other deficits in forelimb use due to stroke and PEM are in the Electronic Supplementary Data and Supplementary Figure II .
Cylinder Task
The rats with stroke in both diet groups showed limb preference (Fig. 3 a–c; P Stroke < 0.01). The LP-St rats tended to contact the ground with the unaffected forelimb during termination of episodes of vertical activity more often than the NP-St rats ( P Diet × Stroke Interaction = 0.055; P Diet > 0.05) (Fig. 3 c). The LP diet did not affect stroke-induced changes in forelimb preference during wall exploration ( P Diet > 0.05; P Diet × Stroke Interaction > 0.05) (Fig. 3 b) or initiation of episodes of vertical activity ( P Diet > 0.05; P Diet × Stroke Interaction > 0.05) (Fig. 3 a). Neither the LP diet nor stroke affected the number of wall touches ( P Stroke > 0.05; P Diet > 0.05; P Diet × Stroke Interaction > 0.05) or rearings ( P Stroke > 0.05; P Diet > 0.05; P Diet × Stroke Interaction > 0.05) (Electronic Supplementary Data ).
Brain Inflammation
No ED1 signal was detected in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the infarct or in the brains of sham rats. There was no vimentin signal in sham groups.
Three distinct areas were differentiated: (1) the core of the infarct, the region almost devoid of cells; (2) the infarct rim infiltrated by ED1 + phagocytes, which are predominantly transformed resident microglia at 3 days [ ], and vimentin + /GFAP − astrocytes; and (3) the surrounding peri-infarct area of vital tissue containing activated microglia (ED1 + ) and astrocytes. The predominant signal in the latter was GFAP, but there was some vimentin staining that decreased with increasing distance from the infarct rim.
The LP diet suppressed the GFAP and ED1 signal intensity after stroke, as illustrated in the representative images in Fig. 4 . Figure 5 shows significant differences between the NP-St and LP-St groups, considering ROI (ED1: P Diet < 0.001, partial ƞ 2 = 0.14, observed power 0.99; P ROI < 0.001, partial ƞ 2 = 0.68, observed power 1.00; P Diet × ROI Interaction < 0.001, partial ƞ 2 = 0.32; observed power 1.00; GFAP: P Diet < 0.001, partial ƞ 2 = 0.22, observed power 1.00; P ROI < 0.001, partial ƞ 2 = 0.67, observed power 1.00, P Diet × ROI Interaction > 0.05). Supplementary Figure III illustrates different patterns in spatial distribution of GFAP- and ED1-positive cells individually for each diet group (RANOVA) by indicating those ROIs that are significantly different from ROI #10.

Infarct Size
Diet had no effect on the width of either the infarct core (NP-St: 3015 ± 55 μm; LP-St: 3549 ± 256 μm) or the infarct rim (NP-St: 479 ± 45 μm; LP-St: 399 ± 37 μm) in the stroke groups ( P > 0.05).
Brain Elemental Distribution by μXFI
Electronic Supplementary Figure V shows the Cl, K, Ca, and Zn distribution patterns across the peri-infarct area and the infarct rim. In the NP-St group, K ( P ROI < 0.001) and Zn ( P ROI < 0.05) levels gradually decreased in ROIs close to or within the infarct rim compared to remote cortical areas, whereas Ca increased ( P ROI < 0.05). No effect of ROI was observed in Cl. Although the spatial distribution of K was comparable between the LP-St and NP-St groups ( P > 0.05) (Electronic Supplementary Figure V ), the LP diet caused small but significant changes in the Zn, Ca, and Cl signatures ( P < 0.05) (Fig. 6 a–c; Electronic Supplementary Figure IV and Figure V ). There was no difference between the sham groups, and the elemental distribution was also comparable between ROIs across the motor cortex in the NP-Sh and LP-Sh groups (data not shown). Fig. 6 The LP diet altered the spatial distribution of chloride and zinc across the peri-infarct area (1–10 ROIs) and infarct rim (a–e ROIs) in the motor cortex. The panels show chloride ( a ), calcium ( b ), and zinc ( c ). Each sampling site has an area of 100 μm × 1100 μm (width × height). The data are expressed as % of ROI#10. * shows the difference between LP-St and NP-St groups for each ROI (independent t test; P < 0.05).

Discussion
Our study explored the effects of pre-existing PEM on functional deficits caused by cortical stroke in the acute period. To remove the confounding influences inherent in clinical studies, we employed preclinical models and isolated, for the first time, detrimental effects of PEM on brain vulnerability to cortical stroke and the resulting sensori-motor impairments. Malnourished rats displayed a greater increase in forelimb errors (slips and falls between the ladder rungs) during skilled walking after stroke, relative to rats of optimal nutritional status. We have previously shown that protein-energy malnourished rats without exposure to stroke exhibit more subtle deficits in skilled locomotion detected as a reduction in forelimb placement accuracy in the horizontal ladder task [ , ]. However, an increase in walking errors (forelimb slips and falls) occurs only after stroke. Thus, our findings indicate that PEM aggravates stroke-induced sensori-motor abnormalities. The malnourished rats also relied more on the non-affected paw to contact the ground after spontaneous vertical exploration in the cylinder task. Our estimates indicate that the greater functional deficits with PEM are not caused by an increase in infarct size, although this will need to be confirmed in future by measuring infarct volume. Our results suggest that rehabilitation approaches that exclude proactive screening and treatment of PEM could have adverse consequences for recovery of walking ability after stroke. Unfortunately, inadequate nutritional screening of stroke patients has been widely reported across Canada [ ]. The potential confounding influence of PEM may also need to be considered when stroke patients are randomized to clinical trials that test rehabilitation strategies.
The second major finding is that PEM suppressed the acute neuroinflammatory response to stroke, evident as dampening of astrogliosis and microglial activation. The spatial features of neuroinflammation 3 days after photothrombotic stroke were comparable to previously published data [ , , ]. However, pre-existing PEM attenuated astrogliosis in the peri-infarct area. This may underlie the greater deficit in forelimb function, since decreased astrocytic reactivity acutely after stroke can impair brain healing [ , ] and neurological recovery [ ]. Diminished ability to reconstruct a compromised blood-brain barrier and resolve osmotic stress have also been suggested to impair recovery after brain injuries in GFAP and/or vimentin null mice [ ]. An attenuated glial scar due to downregulation of astrocyte intermediate filaments after stroke can adversely affect axonal remodeling and functional recovery [ ]. Whether PEM selectively targets or modulates all of these processes requires further investigation. Within the necrotic rim occupied by vimentin + /GFAP − astrocytes, PEM did not affect either the extent or phenotype of activated astrocytes. Since the vimentin + /GFAP − intermediate filament phenotype is mostly observed in astrocytes in areas of neuronal necrosis [ , ], photothrombotic stroke appears to have caused irreversible damage in the infarct rim by day 3.
The reduced microglial response to stroke in both the peri-infarct area and the infarct rim may also contribute to PEM-augmented post-stroke sensori-motor dysfunction, since a finely tuned microglial response is needed for optimal recovery [ ]. Although there can be harmful effects of activated microglia via pro-inflammatory mediators [ , , ], the microglial clearing of necrotic cells and cytotoxic substances and secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines is also necessary to restore brain homeostasis and promote resolution of inflammation [ , ]. Whether PEM targets both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators or how it modulates the activated glial phenotype are unknown. Diminished microglial scavenging may play an important role since ED1-positive microglia phagocytose necrotic debris [ ]. The mechanisms underlying the suppression of cortical stroke-induced activation of the immune system [ ] by PEM deserve investigation .
The reported effects of PEM on neuroinflammatory indicators after brain ischemia have varied across studies. Here, we report that the microglial response to cortical stroke is attenuated by pre-existing PEM. Previously, we demonstrated increased hippocampal NFκB activation following global brain ischemia in the protein-energy malnourished gerbil; however, the transcription regulatory effect of NFκB was not examined to verify that increased pro-inflammatory target gene expression accompanied the increased nuclear translocation of activated NFκB proteins [ ]. Another complexity is whether pre-existing PEM by itself causes low-grade brain inflammation. Whereas PEM alone did not induce microglia activation in the forelimb or hind limb regions of the motor cortex in sham surgical control rats [ ], increased NFκB activation in the hippocampus was observed in unoperated protein-energy malnourished gerbils [ ]. These differences across studies may reflect different types of brain ischemia (focal versus global), species, brain region, and post-stroke time period. It will be essential in future studies to investigate the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators and signaling intermediates to gain a complete understanding of the influence of PEM on brain inflammation.
Stroke-induced changes in the concentration gradients of K and Ca occurred within the infarct rim and the peri-infarct area, whereas increased Cl was found only in the malnourished stroke group, as was the major decrease in Zn. The simultaneously mapping of K, Cl and Ca alterations efficiently demarcated the peri-infarct area from the infarct rim. Although we did not investigate the underlying mechanisms, many of the stroke-induced changes are characteristic of the decreased cerebral blood flow, damaged blood-brain barrier (BBB), massive ion shifts, cell death, edema, and glial response associated with stroke [ , , , , , ]. The Cl and Ca overload paralleled the vimentin distribution in hyperplastic astrocytes in the infarct rim. Concomitant K, Cl, and Ca ionic shifts and vimentin reappearance in astrocytes after stroke also emphasize the importance of intra-glial ionic homeostasis in maintenance of glial responses [ ]. Of the PEM-induced elemental changes after stroke, the mechanism underlying the increased Cl concentration is particularly intriguing. Whether the PEM-attenuated Ca concentration causes diminished microglial activation also needs investigation, as do the mechanisms underlying the PEM-amplified Zn loss. While Zn loss after stroke can result from Zn release from synaptic vesicles and intracellular stores of gluzinergic dying neurons [ ], we obtained no evidence of increased neuron death in the PEM group.
While this study focused on neuroinflammation, it is likely that PEM exerts multiple effects on inter-related systems important to post-stroke recovery. As shown previously [ ], PEM also elicited an acute phase response, demonstrated by decreased serum albumin and increased α2-macroglobulin, which are negative and positive acute phase proteins, respectively. Serum cytokine measurements in future would confirm if this reflects low-grade systemic inflammation, which would raise the intriguing possibility that nutritional status could influence the known interplay between brain inflammatory signals and the peripheral immune system [ ]. Skeletal muscle wasting caused by PEM [ ] may also contribute to sensori-motor disabilities after stroke.
A major strength of our study is the use of carefully controlled preclinical adult models and validated motor function tests that allowed us to isolate pre-existing PEM as a direct cause of poorer post-stroke motor function and impaired ability of the brain to mount an inflammatory response. Our model of adult PEM is well characterized [ ]. Among the recommended preclinical stroke models, we selected a refined photothrombotic model [ ] because of its major advantage for best mimicking the nutritional and metabolic status of stroke patients. Since it requires a less invasive surgery, there are only small, rapidly reversed decreases in food intake and body weight; the marked neuroendocrine response causing widespread tissue wasting and elevated energy and protein requirements that occur with major surgery [ ] is absent. There are also study limitations. Our findings are restricted to the acute period after stroke, and it will be critical to examine how post-stroke sensori-motor recovery rates are affected by PEM in the chronic period. Future studies should also investigate the effects of aggressive treatment of pre-existing PEM on the full spectrum of inflammation development and resolution as it affects long-term recovery. Our findings lay the foundation for future investigations of the mechanisms underlying the effects of nutritional status on the glial response to stroke.
In summary, pre-existing PEM exacerbated sensori-motor abnormalities in forelimb use induced by stroke in the acute period. The attenuated neuroinflammatory response and the acute phase response caused by PEM may be important contributing mechanisms by which untreated PEM could inhibit the course of post-stroke functional recovery and diminish treatment efficacy.
