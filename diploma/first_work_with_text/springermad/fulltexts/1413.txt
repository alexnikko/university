Introduction
Thirty-six turtle species of Brazilian reptiles are recognized (Bérnils and Costa ). There are only five reports of hemoparasites in these animals: Haemoproteus peltocephalus and Haemoproteus geochelonis in Peltocephalus dumerilianus and Chelonoidis denticulata (Lainson and Naiff ), Haemogregarina sp. in Phrynops geoffroanus (Campos-Brites and Rantin ), Haemogregarina sp. in Podocnemis unifilis (Soares et al. ), Haemogregarina sp. in Podocnemis expansa (Picelli et al. ), and Haemogregarina sp. in Ph. geoffroanus and Po. expansa held in captivity (Pessoa et al. ).
Hemogregarines form a group of about 400 species of adeleid blood parasites. In a review of the group, Levine ( ) placed 300 species in the genus Haemogregarina . Later, Siddall ( ) designated only 19 as Haemogregarina sensu stricto. Since then, species have been added and removed from this list. Previously, two species on the list were observed in snakes. In addition, H. fitzsimonsi was recently reassigned as Hepatozoon fitzsimonsi and H. parvula as Hemolivia parvula (Cook et al. , ).
Haemogregarina species (Apicomplexa: Adeleina: Haemogregarinidae) have a heteroxenous lifecycle (Levine ), with vertebrate hosts such as fish and turtles, and vectors such as gnathiid isopods and leeches of the families Glossiphonidae, Ozobranchidae, and Pisicolidae (Siddal and Desser , ; Siddall ; Davies et al. ).
In turtles, H. balli has the best-described lifecycle in the genus. This is a parasite found in Chelydra serpentina and has the leech Placobdella ornata as vector (Siddall and Desser ). Transmission occurs through blood hematophagy by leeches, with inoculation of sporozoites by the proboscis. Sexual development occurs in the vector, where gametogenesis, zygote formation, and monosporoblastic oocyst formation takes place. Sporozoites invade the proboscis of the leech and are inoculated into the turtle during feeding. In the vertebrate host, the sporozoites pierce the wall of the intestine and lodge in organs such as the lungs, spleen, and liver, where they form pre-erythrocytic meronts, and the gametocytes form in the last part of the cycle (Siddall and Desser , ; Davies and Johnston ).
Diagnosis by optical microscopy was considered for a long time as a gold standard; visual detection on blood smears is commonly used to identify hemoparasites such as the hemogregarines (Sehgal et al. ). Nowadays, the molecular technique of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been explored and proved to be useful in the identification and characterization of genus and species of hemogregarines. Perkins and Keller ( ), Moço et al. ( , ), Haklová et al. ( ), O’Dwyer et al. ( ), and Maia et al. ( ) detected Hepatozoon spp. in lizards and snakes by PCR. Pessoa et al. ( ) used the primer pair HEMO1/HEMO2 described by Perkins and Keller ( ) to detect Haemogregarina sp. in captive turtles. In addition, Maia et al. ( ) used the primers HepF300/Hep900 (Ujvari and Marques ) to detect hemogregarines in reptiles, and, thus, identified Haemogregarina spp. in lizards from Oman. Conventional PCR using primers ER/EF (Kvičerová et al. ) from 18S rRNA gene has been conducted in Southeast Asia and western Palearctic freshwater turtles targeting hemogregarines, such as Haemogregarina sp. (Dvoráková et al. , ). All the primers described above target the 18S rRNA gene of the hemoparasites. The present study is the first to perform conventional PCR targeting 18S rRNA gene of hemogregarines in free-living Brazilian turtles.
In a natural environment, reptiles parasitized with hemogregarines are usually asymptomatic. However, if the parasitemia is high, there are consequences for the animal (Crawford ). The damage caused by these hemoparasites usually worsens in captivity, where the animal is under stress and becomes immunosuppressed, and the infected animal may present severe clinical conditions and possible secondary infections (Møller ; Olsson et al. ). In the literature, there are reports of hemolytic anemia, apathy, weight loss, and altered breeding and mating patterns (Møller ; Amo et al. ; Thrall et al. ) in response to infection. In addition, Oppliger and Clobert ( ) observed that parasitized lizards have reduced post-autotomy regeneration.
In the present study, free-living and captive turtles were screened for the presence of hemogregarines using both morphological and molecular techniques. We also explored the association between prevalence and turtle host origin (free living/captive) and physical variables of the host such as sex and age (adult/juvenile/new hatchling).
Materials and methods
Authorization
The project was submitted to and approved by the Ethics Committee for Animal Use (CEUA) at the Federal University of Uberlândia, Uberlândia, Minas Gerais, Brazil, (protocol 032/16) and by the Biodiversity Information and Authorization System (SISBIO) (Protocol 51398-1).
Area and study population
Turtle species were collected from two sites (Table 1 ). (1) Laboratory of Research and Study of Wild Animals (LAPAS), Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Federal University of Uberlândia, Minas Gerais, Brazil (coordinates: 18°53′09.4″S 48°15′29.5″W). Samples were collected from 46 turtles between July and September 2015. The individuals were considered captive, living in an indoor environment with adequate sanitary management and constant monitoring by veterinarians and biologists. They were born in or brought to LAPAS by the environmental police and/or the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA). The animals brought following seizure underwent clinical and laboratory tests, were dewormed, and if necessary were treated for disease. When possible, they were reintroduced into nature; otherwise, they remained in a captive environment. (2) The sand banks of Red River in Britânia city and the surrounding area (coordinates 14°57′08,4″S 51°06′30,7″W). Samples were collected from 32 turtles in July to September 2015 and in July 2016. These turtles were considered free-living because they naturally inhabited this region. Table 1 Number of samples collected from species of free-living and captive turtles from the states of Minas Gerais and Goiás, in July and September 2015 and July 2016, and the positivity for Haemogregarina podocnemis sp. nov. observed by light microscopy Species No. P (%) Free living Podocnemis unifilis 31 31 (100) Podocnemis expansa 1 0 Total 32 31 (96.87) Captivity Podocnemis unifilis 7 5 (71.43) Trachemys dorbigni 23 0 Trachemys elegans 5 0 Chelonoidis sp. 4 0 Phrynops geoffroanus 5 0 Kinostemon scorpioides 2 0 Total 46 5 (10.87) Total of chelonians 78 36 (46.15) Total of Po. unifilis 38 36 (94.73) No. total of samples from each species analyzed, P positivity for Haemogregarina podocnemis sp. nov. observed from each species analyzed
Containment and collection of blood samples
For the blood collection, the animals were physically restrained with appropriate equipment following adequate norms (Malvasio et al. ; Portelinha et al. ). The free-living turtles were captured by fishing with barbless fishing hooks (Portelinha et al. ) and tagged by carapacial perforation (Malvasio et al. ). The animals held in captivity were captured manually by the carapace and immobilized by the physical containment (Picelli et al. ).
During the sampling period, sex (male/female) was determined based on sexual dimorphism, and age (adult/juvenile/new hatchling) of the turtles was estimated as described by Araújo et al. ( ). In addition, the animals were visually inspected for ectoparasites such as leeches.
Approximately 2 mL of blood was collected by cervical paravertebral venous puncture (Zippel et al. ). This sample was divided into two aliquots. One was used for two to five blood smears performed at the collection site. The other volume was placed in a polystyrene tube containing EDTA as an anticoagulant and stored at − 20 °C until molecularly analyzed in the Laboratory of Parasitology of the Institute of the Biomedical Sciences Institute at the Federal University of Uberlândia.
Blood smears and morphological and morphometric analysis
Blood smears were fixed with absolute methanol and stained with 10% Giemsa (Eisen and Schall ). After staining, the blood smears were examined by optical microscopy (Olympus Optical Co.) at objectives of × 400 and × 1000 magnification. The morphology of haemogregarine developmental stages were analyzed based on previous descriptions (Telford ; Dvoráková et al. , ; McAllister et al. ; Soares et al. ). The morphometric analysis involved measurements of the width, length, and area of the nuclei and body of the hemoparasite. Whenever possible, at least 50 parasites of each individual were measured and compared. The parasitemia was calculated as the percentage of infected erythrocytes observed in 2000 cells (Godfrey Jr et al. ).
Molecular analysis
PCR was used to confirm the presence of hemogregarines detected by light microscopy. DNA was extracted using the Illustra blood genomicPrep Mini Spin Kit (GE Healthcare) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
To amplify 18S rRNA gene fragments, primers HepF300/Hep900 (Ujvari and Marques ), which are specific for apicomplexan parasites, were used. PCR was carried out in a final volume of 25 μL, including 1 μL each of 10 pmol primer, 12.5 μL of 2× Go Taq Green Master Mix (Promega), and 3 μL of extracted DNA, with nuclease-free water accounting for the remaining volume. PCR conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 45 s, annealing at 50 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min, with a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. As a positive control, blood samples of Po. expansa turtle previously diagnosed with Haemogregarina sp . and provided by Prof. Dr. Lúcio André Viana Dias were used, and for negative controls, PCR was carried out without extracted DNA, only with nuclease-free water. All reactions were performed in a Mastercycler Pro thermocycler (Eppendorf, Brazil), and resulting products were visualized as bands following 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and staining with Gel Red. Gels were observed using an ultraviolet transilluminator.
The products of interest were purified by adding 2 μL of ExoSAP IT enzyme (GE Healthcare) to 5 μL of each PCR product according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. DNA sequences of the products were determined using a model 3500 Genetic Analyzer capillary sequencer (Applied Biosystems) and a BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit v.3.1 (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.
Electropherograms of the forward and reverse auto-generated sequences were used to generate a consensus sequence in Bioedit (Hall ). Three samples were sequenced: two from free-living turtles sampled in 2015 (MF476203) and 2016 (MF476205) and one sample from a captive turtle (MF476204). Sequences from the GenBank Database used to generate a phylogenetic tree and identify genes are listed in Table 5 . The three sequences obtained in this study were compared with the others from GenBank using the MUSCLE algorithm in Geneious v.7.1.3 (Biomatters, http: www.geneious.com ). For the phylogenetic analysis, JModelTest v.2.1.10 (Dariba et al. ) was used to identify the evolutionary model for the maximum likelihood analysis. The model chosen based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was TPM2uf + I + G. The phylogeny of the parasites was inferred using PhyML v. 3.0 (Guindon et al. ) with 1000 replicate bootstraps. Adelina grylli (DQ096836) and Adelina dimidiate (DQ096835) were included as outgroup species.
Statistical analyses
The sample number was calculated based on a method described by Picelli et al. ( ), based on a 95% confidence level and a standard error of 5%. Values were considered statistically significant at a p value < 0.05. Associations between hemoparasite prevalence and turtle origin (free living/captive), prevalence and age (adult/juvenile/new hatchling), and prevalence and sex (male/female) were investigated using multiple and simultaneous comparison tests for binomial populations (Biase and Ferreira ). The gametocyte variables for each turtle specimen were studied by an analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s b post hoc test according to the distribution of data. The means and standard deviations were calculated for the area, length, and width of the hemoparasite nuclei and body in each morphological form in each species of turtle. Whenever possible, at least 50 parasites for each individual were measured and compared. The significance level was established as p < 0.05.
Results
Prevalence
The 78 turtles screened comprised seven species (Table 1 ). Thirty-six (46.15%) individuals, all Po. unifilis , were positive for hemogregarines. Of the 36 positive animals, 5/46 (10.86%) were from the captive environment and 31/32 (96.87%) were from the free environment. The association between environment type and parasite revealed a significant difference ( p = 0.0011), with a prevalence of 31/31 (100%) in free-living and 5/7 (71%) in captive Po. unifilis (Table 1 ).
Of the 40 males screened, 16/17 (94.11%) free-living and 3/23 (13%) captive individuals were positive for hemogregarines. Of the 38 females screened, 15/15 (100%) free-living and 2/23 (8.69%) captive individuals were positive. The comparison of male and female positivity for hemogregarines was non-significant ( p = 0.2316).
Regarding host age, of the 42 adults screened, 21/21 (100%) free-living and 5/21 (23.80%) captive individuals were positive for hemogregarines. Of the 21 juveniles analyzed, 7/8 (87.5%) free-living and none (0/13) of the captive individuals were positive. Of the 15 newly hatched individuals screened, 3/3 (100%) free-living individuals and none (0/12) of the captive individuals were positive. The comparison between host age and positivity for hemogregarines in free-living turtles were non-significant between juveniles and newly hatched ( p = 0.3068) but significant between adult and juvenile ( p = 0.0204) and adult and newly hatched ( p = 0.0001). However, regarding captive turtles, it was not possible to associate host age with positivity, since all positive turtles were adults (Table 2 ). Table 2 Number of samples collected from free-living and captive turtles the states of Minas Gerais and Goiás, in July and September 2015 and July 2016 and the relationship between hemogregarine positivity and turtle age and sex Chelonians Age Sex Adult (%) Juvenile (%) Newly hatched (%) Male (%) Female (%) Free life Total 32 21 8 3 17 15 Positivity 31 21 (100) 7 (87.5) 3 (100) 16 (94.11) 15 (100) Captive Total 46 21 13 12 23 23 Positivity 5 5 (23.80) – – 3 (13.04) 2 (8.69)
The mean parasitemia intensities in infected turtles were 2.96% (1.02–4.9%), with the free-living animals showing higher intensity (4.03% [3.16–4.9%]) than the captive animals (1.53% [1.02–2.65%]).
No ectoparasites such as leeches were observed in the free-living or captive individuals.
Morphological and morphometric analyses
The developmental stages of haemogregarine trophozoites, pre-meronts, meronts, immature gamonts, and mature gamonts found in Po. unifilis were determined . The numbers of Po. unifilis at each developmental stage observed in the blood extensions of animals were the following: 15 trophozoites, 9 pre-meronts, and 5 meronts and for immature and mature gamonts, at least 50 parasites were observed per specimen. Between one and three immature gamonts were observed parasitizing a single erythrocyte (Fig. 1 h). Two immature gamonts (Micro1 and Micro2) and two mature gamonts (Macro1 and Macro2) morphotypes were detected (Fig. 1 ). Morphometric data were obtained for the parasites at all developmental stages. However, for some, it was not possible to present the measure of the parasite nuclei because of the absence of defined nuclear chromatin (Tables 3 and 4 ).

Molecular analysis
PCR was performed on 35 of the 36 samples deemed positive by optical microscopy, because for one specimen, the sample of blood was of insufficient volume. From this total of PCR positive samples (35/35), three were sequenced: two from free-living turtles sampled in 2015 (MF476203—554 bp) and 2016 (MF476205—583 bp) and one sample from a captive turtle (MF476204—554 bp). The gene identity analysis of isolates from the present study, based on Haemogregarina spp. sequences available on GenBank, showed intragenotypic differences. The H. sacaliae reference sequence (KM887507) had 31 nucleotides that were distinct from those in MF476205 and 29 from those in MF476204/MF476203 (Tables 4 , 5 , and 6 ).

In the phylogenetic tree, isolates from this study form a sister clade II with respect to the clade III comprising H. balli (common snapping turtle), H. pellegrini (big-headed-turtle), H. sacaliae (four-eyed-turtle), H. stepanowi (Caspian turtle, Spanish pond turtle, European pond turtle), and Haemogregarina sp. (KF257923/KF257924/KF257925) isolated from the Gabon mud turtle. This may suggest an ancient origin of H. podocnemis sp. nov. with respect to Haemogregarina spp. comprising clade III and, if parasite host switching has not taken place and a parasite host co-evolutionary relationship is assumed, might also suggest that the host turtle Po. unifilis represents a more ancient sister taxon to the Haemogregarina spp. host turtles of clade III. Two additional clades are comprised on one hand by the somewhat more distantly related Haemogregarina sp. (KX507247/KX507249/KX507248) isolated from the alligator snapping turtle (clade I) and on the other hand by the distantly related Haemogregarina sp. (KX453647/KX453590/KX453600) that have been isolated from the house geckos (clade IV) (Fig. 2 ).

Remarks
The trophozoites described here had a single cytoplasmic vacuole at one end. This differs from the description by Dvoráková et al. ( ) of several vacuoles in a single trophozoite. Complementing this, Telford et al. ( ) reported the presence of nuclei, whereas in the present study, all trophozoites observed had no defined nuclei. However, Dvoráková et al. ( ) reported the absence of nuclei in H. stepanowi , which is consistent with that found in the present study. The morphometric means of length and width described here agree with those of other Haemogregarina species described in the literature. Dvoráková et al. ( ) reported these developmental stages of H. stepanowi in newly captured turtles in Morocco, with a mean parasite length and width of 9.6 ± 1.3 × 5.3 ± 0.5 μm. Dvoráková et al. ( ) also described H. sacaliae turtles, reporting a parasite size of 7.5 ± 0.9 × 2.7 ± 0.5 μm .
The pre-meronts identified in this study differ in their morphology from that cited in the literature. They are similar in length but differ in width from the description by Dvoráková et al. ( ).
Soares et al. ( ) analyzed the morphology and morphometry of primary erythrocytic meronts in Po. unifilis (the same turtle analyzed in this study) and reported 5–10 nuclei, with average length of 28.34 ± 2.28 μm, width of 14.505 ± 1.024 μm, and area of 73,193 ± 6.034 μm 2 . The meronts in the present study were smaller and possessed 4–7 nuclei.
The immature gamonts and mature gamonts analyzed in this study were similar to those described by Soares et al. ( ), who reported two morphological characteristics of immature gamonts, named by the authors as microgametocytes, and two of mature gamonts (macrogametocytes). It should be noted that in the present study, no nuclei of one of the morphological forms of immature gamonts (Micro1) were measured because of their indefinite nuclei.
Because of the morphological and morphometric similarities between hemoparasites observed in the present study and those described by Soares et al. ( ), we could infer that they belong to the same species of Haemogregarina. However, Soares et al. ( ) only provided the generic placement of the parasites they described. It should be emphasized that the morphological and morphometric measures of the various haemogregarine developmental stages in turtle have not been described previously in the literature.
Based on a comparison with the morphological and morphometric features of blood developmental stages of Haemogregarina spp. in the literature, we conclude that Soares et al. ( ), recorded in Po. unifilis the same morphotypes of H. podocnemis sp. nov. observed in the present study. However, the authors only identified the genus of this parasite.
Discussion
Hemogregarines are the most common hemoparasites reported in reptiles (Garcia-Navarro and Pachalli ). In the current study, the same observation was made, as H. podocnemis sp. nov. was highly prevalent in the specimens screened. Data on hemoparasites in captive turtles are scarce; in Brazil, there are only two reports. Picelli et al. ( ) found that 100% of commercially bred Po. expansa turtles and 0% of naturally bred Po. expansa turtles were positive for hemogregarines. Pessoa et al. ( ) observed that 11.11% of the turtles were positive in the Zoological Foundation of Brasília, and similar results of captive animals are reported in the current study.
In the present study, the high occurrence of H. podocnemis sp. nov. (96.87%) in free-living turtles corroborates the observations of Jakes et al. ( ), who reported 100% Haemogregarina sp. prevalence in the eastern long-necked turtle ( Chelodina longicollis ) and in the Brisbane short-necked turtle ( Emydura signata ); Mihalca et al. ( ), who reported 77% prevalence in northern Australian snapping turtle ( Elseya latisternum ) and 100% prevalence in the European pond turtle ( Emys orbicularis ); and Davies and Sterrett ( ), who reported 88.9% prevalence in the common musk turtle ( Sternotherus odoratus ). Besides that, Soares et al. ( ) reported high occurrence (98%) of Haemogregarina sp. in free-living Po. unifilis turtles, similar to that observed in this study (100%).
The prevalence in captive turtles was lower than that observed in free-living turtles, presumably because free-living animals are more commonly exposed to the parasite through frequent contact with several possible vectors in the environment. Captive animals may be more easily contained and their health conditions managed. It should be noted that we collected blood from animals in the dry season, from July to September 2015 and in July 2016. This is the time females are depositing eggs on the sandbanks exposed by receding river. This results in the conglomeration of individuals in specific places, which promotes more rapid and widespread propagation of parasites in these individuals because of the feeding of haemogregarine vectors on multiple hosts (Wosniak et al. ; Brown et al. ; Coutinho ; Sandland and Minchella ).
In Brazil, Po. unifilis are found mainly in the Tocantins-Araguaia and Amazon Basin. Podocnemis unifilis (Troschel, 1848), also known as tracajá and the yellow-spotted river turtle, is broadly distributed in South America, with habitat that spans Venezuela, Colombia, Eastern Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, French Guiana, Guyana, Suriname, and Brazil (Vogt ). Eggs and adult animals have been used as a food source (Ferrari ), and the wide distribution and abundance of the species in different basins make it difficult to estimate its conservation status. However, it is classified as vulnerable in the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List. Podocnemis unifilis has the second largest body size among members of this genus in Brazil, with sexual dimorphism evident in adults. Males are smaller with larger tails and females are larger with smaller tails (Salera-Junior and Malvasio ). The species has a dorsoventrally flattened carapace that is brown or olive green in color and that does not exceed 70 cm in length (Ibama ).
Our statistical analysis did not reveal a significant association between H. podocnemis sp. nov. prevalence, host age (juvenile and newly hatched) ( p = 0.3068), and host sex ( p = 0.2316). However, McCoy et al. ( ) and Readel et al. ( ) reported higher positivity in adult female turtles. The authors suggested that this occurs because females are larger in size than males, and so there is a larger contact surface for adherence and feeding of vectors. The same difference in size can be seen from newly hatched to adult. Therefore, the significant association observed between hemoparasite prevalence from adult and newly hatched ( p = 0.0001) and adult and juvenile ( p = 0.0204) can also be explained by the size.
The mean parasitemia observed in free-living Po. unifilis (4.03%) was lower than that recorded by Soares et al. ( ), who also worked with this species of turtles. Nevertheless, our report is still the second-highest haemogregarine intensity ever registered in turtles, with the third-highest parasitemia intensity (3%) observed by Picelli et al. ( ) in Po. expansa turtles from the Amazon region. The present study is the second to obtain such information on Po. unifilis turtles. According to Soares et al. ( ), the high parasitemia and prevalence suggests stable transmission between the vertebrate host and vector (leeches). More studies must be done to better understand the lifecycle of this new parasite, as well as to identify its vector.
In captivity, under confinement stress, the reptiles are more susceptible to parasites (Telford Jr ). However, the haemogregarine intensity level in captive individual (1.53%) was lower than that in the wild individuals. According to Picelli et al. ( ), this pattern might be related to the different environments (conditions) and the mode of transmission of this parasite. It is possible that the captive environment provides inhospitable conditions for leech survival.
In the morphological analysis, various blood developmental stages were observed. However, immature and mature gamonts were the most prevalent. These forms are infective to vectors, and their greater presence in host blood can be explained by the collection period from July to September 2015 and in July 2016, periods that coincide with more vectors, and more blood feeding by vectors, in nature (Siddall and Desser ). In addition, the presence of various developmental stages, including trophozoites, pre-meronts, meronts, immature gamonts, and mature gamonts, may be related to the persistence of hemogregarines that persist in the hosts owing to the schizogonic cycle. Siroký et al. ( ) reported infection of Hem. mauritanica in Testudo marginata for a period of 1–8 years.
In Brazil, there are few reports of Haemogregarina spp. in turtles, and identification is based mainly on morphological observations of the blood developmental stages of the parasite in vertebrate hosts. Among the studies reported, Soares et al. ( ) performed morphological and morphometric characterization of blood developmental stages of a Haemogregarina sp. In addition, there have been three other studies on Haemogregarina spp. in Brazilian turtles, of which none provided any data on morphological and morphometric analyses. Campos-Brites and Rantin ( ) analyzed the incidence of hemogregarines in aquatic turtles of the species Ph. geoffroanus but did not identify the parasite to genus level. Picelli et al. ( ) analyzed the prevalence and parasitemia levels in turtles of Po. expansa , and Pessoa et al. ( ) classified the parasite’s genus using a molecular technique, but did not sequence the PCR product.
In this study, the generic HepF300/Hep900 primer sets were used to amplify the variable region of the conservative 18S rRNA gene of the apicomplexan parasites. Haemogregarina spp. can be identified by sequencing the amplified PCR product, as there are no primers specific for this genus reported in the literature. Thus, the present study used these primers to confirm the generic placement as determined by the morphological analysis. Moreover, Maia et al. ( ) used the HepF300/Hep900 primers for a phylogenetic analysis of apicomplexa parasites and were able to molecularly characterize Haemogregarina sp. and Hepatozoon sp. in reptiles from Oman.
There are no sequences of Haemogregarina species from Brazilian turtles deposited in GenBank. The sequences available are from H. stepanowi (Dvoráková et al. ; Ozvegy et al. ; Arizza et al. ), H. pellegrini (Dvoráková et al. ), H. balli (Barta et al. ), and H. sacaliae (Dvoráková et al. ) obtained in different countries. Other sequences available in GenBank identified the genus Haemogregarina only . All available sequences were used in the phylogenetic analysis. Isolates of Haemogregarina spp. grouped in different branches, and H. podocnemis sp. nov. was identified as a sister group to the other isolates.
The scarcity of information for molecular assays makes species identification unlikely, particularly for Brazilian isolates. However, the morphological and morphometric characteristics observed in the present study were not identical to those observed for H. balli (Barta et al. ), H. stepanowi (Dvoráková et al. ), H. sacaliae (Dvoráková et al. ), or H. pellegrini (Dvoráková et al. ). It is worth reminding that Soares et al. ( ) observed the same morphological and morphometric characteristics of the parasite, in the same turtle species ( Po. unifilis ) as the present study. However, the authors did not perform the molecular analysis and only identified the genus Haemogregarina ; thus, probably, both manuscripts observed the species H. podocnemis sp. nov.
Based on these results, we described a new species, H. podocnemis sp. nov., in Po. unifilis from Brazil. In addition, this is the first study to use the HepF300/Hep900 PCR primers on specimens from Brazilian free-living turtles ( Po. unifilis and Po. expansa ) and to report the prevalence of this parasite in captive Po. unifilis.
