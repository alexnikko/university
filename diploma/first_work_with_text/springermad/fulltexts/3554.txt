Introduction
Understanding the preferred sources of health-related information among patients with cancer and cancer survivors is essential in order to improve the quality of the communication between healthcare providers, the healthcare system, and patients. Although several studies have reported the health-related information-seeking preferences of patients with cancer living in developed nations of the world like the USA and some Western European countries [ , ], little is known about information-seeking behaviors among patients living in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC).
In LMIC, there is a paucity of data regarding which sources information are used and trusted the most by patients with cancer. In these countries, patterns of information-seeking behaviors may not be similar to those found in developed nations due to cultural, economic, and social differences. For example, while in the USA, up to 87% of the population has Internet access, in Latin America only 63% of the population has access to the Internet, and only 51% has a mobile connection [ , ]. In Mexico, 53% of the population has fixed internet access and 41% use a smartphone [ ], which means that web-based educational and cancer prevention initiatives can only reach about half of the country’s inhabitants.
Obtaining data about health-related information seeking is crucial in order to develop effective communication tools and educational strategies aimed at achieving high-quality equitable cancer care and at improving the quality of survivorship among patients with cancer. In this study, we explored the preferred sources of health-related information among patients with cancer treated at a public cancer center in Mexico, and aimed at understanding which patient and disease-related factors may influence those preferences.
Methods
The goal of this cross-sectional descriptive study was to examine the utilization of the various available sources of health-related information among patients with all types of solid tumors seen at an academic cancer center in Mexico City, and to characterize their information-seeking preferences.
Between October and December 2015, we applied the A and B sections of the Spanish Version of the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) Cycle 4 questionnaire [ ] to consecutive patients with a diagnosis of solid tumors seen at the oncology department of the Salvador Zubirán National Institute of Medical Science and Nutrition in Mexico City. Patients with all types of tumor and stages, and at any point in their disease trajectory, were eligible. The HINTS questionnaire was designed to understand how adults use different communication channels to obtain vital health-related information for themselves and their relatives [ ]. The Cycle 4 questionnaire was mailed to people in the USA in late 2014 and was fully translated and validated in Spanish. Section A contains questions regarding health-related information-seeking preferences and trust in different information sources. Section B contains questions regarding the use of the Internet and other digital health technology in order to find health-related information [ , ].
Demographic (age, educational level, gender) and clinical (type of cancer, cancer stage, treatment stage, comorbidities) characteristics were also collected as part of the survey. Since the surveys collected no identifying information, written informed consent was not required from the participants.
Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the population. The characteristics of those respondents who had sought health-related information and of those who chose the Internet as their preferred source of information were compared with those who had not sought for health-related information and those who preferred other sources (doctors, printed materials, family members, organizations) by using Fisher’s exact test. Logistic regression was used to assess the effects of patient characteristics on health-related information-seeking behaviors and on the preferred information sources.
Results
One hundred and forty-eight patients with a median age of 60 years (range 18 to 88) completed the survey. Most participants were women ( n = 103, 69.6%) and had less than graduate education ( n = 104, 70.3%). The characteristics of the participants are summarized in Table 1 . Eighty eight of the interviewed patients (59%) had sought health-related information using any source, mostly for themselves (79.5%), and 79 (53%) had sought cancer-specific information. Most of the patients who sought health-related information ( n = 61, 69%) listed the Internet as their first-choice source for information seeking. Fifty-one percent of the participants ( n = 45) felt concerned or very concerned regarding the quality of the obtained information. The most trusted source of information was a healthcare provider (85% of the participants said they trusted information that came from doctors “a lot”), followed by the Internet, government agencies, and family (Table 2 ). Of the 148 participants, 82 (56%) had access to the Internet, and 59 (40.4%) had used the Internet to look for cancer-related information during the previous year (Table 3 ). Fifty five of the interviewed participants owned a smartphone (37.7%), while 32 (22%) owned an electronic tablet. Most of the participants were interested in exchanging information with healthcare providers using digital health technologies (Table 3 ).

Compared with respondents who had not sought for health-related information, those who had sought for health-related information were younger (mean age 53.6 vs 67.3 years, p < 0.001) and had less comorbidities (1.1 vs 1.7, p = 0.03). Patients who sought information also had a higher educational level than those who did not (at least high school education in 64.7 vs 23.3%, p < 0.001). Cancer stage, cancer type, gender, treatment type, and income did not differ between respondents who sought healthcare information and those who did not. On multivariate analysis, only increasing age (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.90–0.97) was related with lower odds of seeking health-related information.
Compared with respondents who preferred other sources of information, those who chose the Internet were younger (mean age 51 vs 58.7 years, p = 0.002), had a higher educational level (at least high school education in 70.5 vs 36%, p = 0.002), had less comorbidities (0.95 vs 1.3, p < 0.001), and were more likely to be male (46 vs 12%, p = 0.003). Cancer stage, cancer type, treatment type, and income did not differ between respondents who preferred the Internet and those who preferred other sources of information. On multivariate analysis, only being of the female gender (OR 4.9, 95% CI 1.3–18.3) was related with higher odds of preferring other sources of information over the Internet.
Discussion
Although the proportion of patients who looked for information about cancer was lower than that reported in the USA, most of the participants had done so during the previous year. Despite low access, the Internet is the most used information source among Mexican patients with cancer, although doctors still represent the most trusted source. Older age was the characteristic most strongly associated with not seeking health-related information, while being female was strongly associated with preferring other sources of information over the Internet.
The Institute of Medicine has highlighted the relevance of patient centeredness as a fundamental attribute of high-quality cancer care [ ]. One of the most important components patient-centered care is the development of educational initiatives, programs, and tools that can help educate and activate patients and caregivers at various points of the disease trajectory [ ]. These tools can inform not only decision-making for treatment but also prevention, screening, diagnosis, and survivorship. Although Mexico lacks a national cancer plan, the 2013–2018 National Healthcare Plan highlights health promotion and education as one of the most important actions to tackle non-communicable diseases [ ]. Furthermore, the 2013–2018 Program for the Prevention and Control of Women’s Cancers emphasizes the relevance of healthcare education in order to decrease the mortality rates of cervical and breast cancer in the country [ ]. However, although communication and education are mentioned as important measures, the specific strategies and methods used to reach the population at risk are not known. This important shortcoming is mostly related to a generalized lack of knowledge about the health-related information-seeking preferences of patients with cancer in Mexico.
In our study, only 60% of the participants had looked for health-related information, which is considerably lower than the 81% rate reported in the 2013 HINTS survey in the USA [ ]. Interestingly, among those patients who looked for health-related information, the Internet was by far the most used source. The proportion of patients who reported that their physician was their main source of health-related information (10.8%) was much lower than that reported in the USA (32 to 45%) [ , ]. This may be related to the fact that our patients were receiving care within a public healthcare system with important time constraints, which may limit the patient-physician interaction. Additionally, many patients do not have a stable treating physician, which means that they are seen by a different fellow or attending oncologist at each visit, which may also lead to worse communication and less information seeking [ ]. However, and as in other previous publications, physicians represent the most trusted source of health-related information [ , , ]. Both educational level and age were associated with higher odds of seeking for health-related information from any source. However, on multivariate analysis, only age was significantly associated, with older participants less likely to seek information. This may be because the average schooling of older Mexicans is of only 4.6 years, and 19.9% of men and 28.7% of women over 60 in Mexico were not able to read or write as of 2010 [ ]. This highlights the importance of educating and empowering older patients with cancer in order to encourage information seeking. In contrast with previous studies that have reported that female survivors and patients with breast cancer are more likely to seek for health-related information, we found no differences according to gender or tumor type [ , ].
Our sample had an Internet access rate which was very similar to that reported for the general Mexican population. However, the proportion of patients who used the Internet to look for health-related information was lower than that reported in the USA and in Europe [ , , , ]. As in other studies, younger age and a higher educational level were related with higher odds of looking for health-related information using the Internet [ , , ]. Interestingly, the most important predictor for Internet usage was gender, with women being less likely to use the Internet for health-related information seeking. This differs from findings in developed countries, where females have been found to be more likely than men to seek for information online [ , ]. While this may be related with a lower educational level among women in Mexico, it may also be a reflection of the existing gaps and gender disparities that exist in the societies of many developing countries.
Our study has limitations. The patient population was recruited at a third-level public hospital in Mexico City, and may not be representative of patients seen at smaller hospitals and in rural regions of Mexico, where access to information may be more limited. Likewise, patients seen at private practices may have other characteristics and enhanced access to information. However, it is important to mention that more than half of Mexicans with cancer receive care at public hospitals [ ]. Patients of all ages and with all tumor types were included, and this may not be useful to inform the design of information strategies for specific cancers or demographic groups. However, we believe that since many of the recommendations for patients and survivors are similar across tumor types, understanding the health-related information-seeking preferences of all patients with cancer is relevant. Finally, we did not obtain information regarding how patients used the obtained information, so we do not know if looking for health-related information led to improvements in shared decision-making. We plan to assess the health literacy and the shared decision-making processes of Mexican patients with cancer in future studies.
Cancer education and prevention programs in LMICs should be designed taking the information-seeking behaviors of the population into account, and policymakers should strive for patients to receive health-related information via their preferred and most trusted sources. Although the increasing access to the Internet in developing regions of the world represents an opportunity to implement online initiatives, other methods and strategies may still be necessary to reach specific populations, such as older adults, women, and those with lower educational levels.
