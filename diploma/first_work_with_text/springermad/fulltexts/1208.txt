Introduction
Human α-fucosidase (EC 3.2.1.51) is a hydrolase belonging to a group of glucosidases, hydrolyses O- and S-glucosyl. These compounds have gained importance as potential serological markers, particularly in some forms of cancer such as hepatocellular carcinoma [ , ]. The enzyme is of particular biological and medical interest, as the inherited deficiency in its activity leads to fucosidosis, a pathology belonging to severe glycoprotein lysosomal storage disorders [ , ]. Fucosidosis is a very rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder, included in the group of oligosaccharides or glycoproteinoses [ ]. Clinical hallmarks include progressive psychomotor retardation, facial dysmorphism, deafness, angiokeratoma, neurologic signs, moderate hepatomegaly, and dysostosis multiplex [ ]. From a pathogenetic point of view, past reports graded fucosidosis into two major categories, type 1 (severe) and type 2 (moderate). Diagnosis in pediatric subjects yet appears quite difficult [ ]. In type 1, the age of onset ranged between 3 and 18 months and was differentiated through rapid psychomotor regression and severe neurologic deterioration starting at 6 months of age, elevated sweat chloride secretion, and often fatality within the first decade of life. Type 2 has a typically slower progression, differentiated by milder psychomotor retardation and neurologic symptoms, the growth of angiokeratoma corporis diffusum , normal sweat salt secretion, and extended survival [ ] .
Fucosidosis originates due to mutations in the α-L-fucosidase-1 (FUCA-1) tissue gene, involved in the production of the α-L-fucosidase enzyme in the lysosomes. Originally, the gene has been cloned and located on 1p34 jointly with a pseudogene on chromosome 2 [ ]. Inside lysosomes, the enzyme consisting of 466 amino acids and with a molecular weight of 53,689 Da modulates the breakdown of oligosaccharides attached to glycoproteins and glycolipids. Alpha-L-fucosidase is responsible for cleaving fucose in the last step of the breakdown process. Pathology originates due to alpha-L-fucosidase deficiency, and fucose builds up in body tissues. FUCA-1 evaluation has been recently associated with chronic inflammation such as asthma [ ]. Some authors have investigated the role of the human airway cell line BEAS-2B in the regulation of FUCA-1 and FUCA-2 genes, leading to the conclusion that T-helper 1 cytokines upregulate both FUCA-1 and FUCA-2 gene expression, particularly by interferon-gamma [ ]. At the same time, evidence suggesting an immunoregulatory role for α-L-fucosidase has been recently reported [ ]. From an immunological point of view, this acid hydrolase is highly upregulated by chemokines just in the later stages of inflammation, as the primary function of α-L-fucosidase includes cleavage of fucosylated residues from adhesion molecules such as surface Lewis X antigen and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1/cluster differentiation 31 (CD31). These molecules play a fundamental role in intravascular leukocyte rolling and subsequent extravasation [ ]. In children, diagnosis of fucosidosis is particularly cumbersome, and the literature is full of odd case reports and questioned clinical issues, particularly from developing countries [ , ]. Given the role of α-fucosidase in the brain and cognitive disorders, particularly exacerbated during the neurodevelopmental process in children, we hypothesize that plasma levels of FUCA-1 in infants might be correlated with chronic neuroinflammatory disorders and as such could be a useful marker particularly during immune activation [ ]. However, the role of FUCA-1 in the immune dysregulation is yet far to be fully elucidated, and this study attempts to provide a contribution to this field.
Materials and methods
Subjects
With the aim to evaluate plasma FUCA-1 activity in a pediatric population, in total, 201 hospitalized Hungarian patients was enrolled in the study (Josa Andras County Hospital, Nyiregyhaza, Hungary). The patient sample was made of 44 children (1–13 years, equally sex distributed) and 57 adult patients (31–88 years, equally sex distributed), actually hospitalized for different pathologies. A group of healthy controls consisting of 75 children (2–15 years) and 20 adults (30–85 years) of comparable sex ratio was added to the study as a comparing population (healthy controls). Subject recruitment and experimental planning/processes underwent the approval of the local ethics committee and medical board, and each pediatric patient participated in the study after parents’ informed consent. Informed consents were also obtained from the adult individuals that were recruited to the study.
Samples and assay process
Samples of plasma were collected by centrifugation within 4 h following the venous blood withdrawal, at 6000 g for 3 min starting from heparinized blood, stored at −20 °C and thawed early before use [ ]. Then, an aliquot of 10 μl of plasma was mixed with 40 μl of 0.2 M citrate/phosphate buffer pH 4.8 (CP) and 50 μl of 4MU-α-L-fucoside in 0.5 ml CP. After incubating for 30 min at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 4 ml of 0.25 M glycin-carbonate buffer, pH 10.4. Blanks were prepared by adding only the diluted plasma or serum. The fluorescence of the hydrolysis product, 4-methylumbelliferone, was determined using a Perkin-Elmer LS-5 luminescence spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer Ltd., Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, UK) with an excitation wavelength of 350 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm. Also measured was a calibration curve with freshly made standards of 4-methylumbelliferone containing 1–5 nmoles/ml. The fluorimetric assay using 4MU-α-L-fucoside gives an increase in sensitivity of approximate 30–100-fold over the corresponding compound p -nitrophenyl substrate. FUCA-1 (200 kDa) values were reported as nanomoles per hour, per milliliter of plasma (nmoles/h/ml).
Statistics
The data are presented as mean and standard deviation (mean ± SD). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA; Tukey post hoc test) and regression calculations were performed after checking normality (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) and autocorrelation (Durbin-Watson test) in the series. When requested, standard error (SEM) was calculated considering the 95% confidence interval (CI) provided by results coming from the labs reference population. When a 95% confidence interval is available for an absolute measure of intervention effect (e.g. SMD, risk difference, and rate difference), then the standard error (SE) can be calculated as SE = (CI 95 upper limit − CI 95 lower limit)/3.92 [ ].
Distribution comparison was performed by Pearson test and two-sided t test for significance at p < 0.05. The data were plotted using SigmaPlot v. 10.0 graph software after statistics were run in SPSS v. 7.0.
Results
In the present study, no correlation was observed in FUCA-1 activity in plasma between subjects with pathology and healthy individuals, probably because of effects related to sample size and variability. Low FUCA-1 plasma levels (18.2 ± 4.2 nmoles) were observed ( p < 0.05) in pediatric patients with autoimmune disorders, particularly chronic autoimmune disorders, such as Sjögren syndrome.

Normal plasma FUCA-1 activities in our lab for the pediatric population gave a mean of 458 ± 103 SD nmoles/h/ml (280–556 nmoles/h/ml) while the sample of the present study had a mean value of 390 ± 89 nmoles/h/ml, which is much more comparable to that observed in the adult population with reference ranges of 313–674 nmoles/h/ml (mean 320 ± 48 SD nmoles/h/ml). Patients of the pediatric population were grouped into clusters, to make the readability easier.
In a first attempt to elucidate if FUCA-1 levels in the pediatric population correlated with metabolic syndrome or nutritional impairments, such as diabetes or food intoxication, a further sample stratification was accomplished, but there was no difference compared to the controls ( p = 0.6974). No correlation was also observed when acute immune disorders were evaluated ( p = 0.9677). Similar results were also obtained in adults ( p = 0.5432, p = 0.7655, respectively). The pediatric cohort of patients was divided into two groups to allow comparisons with controls, including general or idiopathic pathologies (group A) or chronic, debilitating, degenerative, and/or autoimmune disorders (group B) separately. Figure 1 shows that levels of FUCA-1 in plasma of group A did not differ significantly from controls, despite the different mean values (Fig. 1 a, r = 0.4702, p = 0.1839, DW test = 2.7597), but when levels of FUCA-1 from children belonging to the group B were compared with controls, a significant regression value was reported (Fig. 1 b, r = 0.1523, p = 0.0002, DW test = 1.4130). This was also confirmed when comparing between the two subgroups (Fig. 1 c, r = 0.3735, p > 0.0001, DW test = 1.3602). Higher variability was observed in group B than in group A when either adults or pediatric subjects were compared (Fig. 1 c).

Controls vs. group A (panel a ), controls vs. group B (panel b ), group A vs. group B (panel c ), and group dispersions (panel d ).

The association of FUCA-1 with the observed spectrum of chronic inflammatory diseases was further evaluated. Figure 2 shows FUCA-1 values for rheumatic or chronic diseases (a) and autoimmune ones (b) in adults or children (Fig. 1 d) and the relative regression fitting curve, with IC 95 , either calculated or expected; R value was indicative of a significant correlation between different distributions ( r = 0.7220, p = 0.0782), and Pearson test reported a two-sided p = 0.000148, so indicating that modifications in FUCA-1 plasma activity correlated with the pathology cluster inclusion, i.e., chronic inflammatory disorders and autoimmunity.

Discussion
Chronic inflammation and chronic immune disorders, such as autoimmunity and brain disorders, are often associated with a chronic immune response and possibly related to different levels of plasma fucosidase in children [ ]. This evidence should suggest a further investigation of the role of FUCA-1 plasma activity in chronic immune disorders. Alpha-L-fucosidase is commonly used as a tumor marker, but the data from the present study suggest that it also is a possible marker of chronic inflammation, of which tumors are an example [ ]. Tumors were included in group A due to their highly complex nature and their extreme heterogeneity. In Sjögren syndrome, the chronic inflammatory state is exacerbated by lysosome function, of which the inhibition has been shown effective in animal models of systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatic disorders [ ]. This evidence may be in line with the role of the enzyme in immune response, particularly in certain experimental models [ ]. The role of fucosidase in the neurological disorders is particularly intriguing, but this enzyme is poorly investigated [ , ]. Besides fucosidosis, which in pediatrics still represents a big concern [ , ], peripheral blood activity of FUCA-1 might be examined to highlight further the relationship between glucidic metabolism and immune response. At the best of our knowledge, this is the first report showing an association between the activity of α-L-fucosidase and chronic autoimmune disorders in children. The evaluation of glycosidases in plasma or serum is an inexpensive, simple, and sensitive test for pathological evaluation and screening or monitoring many diseases, including alcohol abuse, risk of arteriosclerosis, bacterial infections (e.g., Lyme borreliosis), chronic inflammatory processes, such as rheumatoid arthritis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis, asthma, autoimmune disorders, and primary biliary cirrhosis, as well as cancers. The present study further suggests the potential use of plasma alpha-L-fucosidase as a biomarker for chronic inflammation and autoimmune disorders in both young and adult patients.
