Highlights
Reduced emphasis on early postoperative bridging anticoagulation is one proposed explanation for the increased incidence of HeartMate II pump thrombosis
The use of initial postoperative parenteral bridging anticoagulation is common as recommended by manufacturer guidelines but frequently sub-therapeutic
There were no significant associations between the use of a parenteral bridge and the incidence of overall HeartMate II pump thrombosis at two years; however, point estimates of cumulative incidences demonstrated a lower rate of pump thrombosis at 6 months with the use of a therapeutic parenteral bridge, suggesting that the intensity of post implant bridging is a contributing factor in early but not late pump thrombosis
Prospective studies are needed to confirm the independent role of post-implant parenteral bridging on pump thrombosis, and these studies should include detailed information on the achievement of anticoagulation targets
Introduction
Continuous-flow left ventricular assist systems (LVAS) increase longevity and enhance quality of life in patients with medically refractory advanced heart failure [ , ]. Significant improvements in device design and clinical management have led to their widespread use [ ]. Adverse events remain common in approved devices, including the life-threatening complication of pump thrombosis [ ]. Beginning in 2011, an unexpected increase in the incidence of pump thrombosis was observed in the most widely implanted LVAS, the Heartmate II (HM II) [ , ]. Multicenter analyses demonstrated that a majority of pump thromboses occurred within the first 3–6 months after device implant, suggesting that early postoperative management may play a crucial role in determining the downstream risk of pump thrombosis [ ].
Relaxation of anticoagulation therapy in the early postoperative period has been one proposed contributing cause for the increased incidence of HM II pump thrombosis [ ]. Early clinical trials of the HM II reported a high incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding, leading to a shift toward less intensive anticoagulation therapy at some centers [ , , , ]. Particularly controversial is the role of postoperative parenteral bridging anticoagulation [ ]. Initial HM II trial protocols included the use of postoperative heparin as a transition to oral warfarin [ , ]. However, high bleeding rates and a single study showing no association between heparin bridging and thromboembolic outcomes led to the exclusion of this practice from expert management guidelines published in 2010 [ , ]. Manufacturer guidelines, however, continued to recommend use of a parenteral heparin bridge [ ].
Currently, little is known about the frequency, timing, and intensity of postoperative parenteral bridging in real-world practice. Furthermore, the relationship between postoperative bridging anticoagulation and pump thrombosis remains unclear. In this study we provide a detailed description of patient-level, early postoperative anticoagulation practices following HM II implantation and explore the relationship of these practices to the incidence of pump thrombosis.
Methods
Patient cohort and data collection
After obtaining Institutional Review Board approval, we reviewed the electronic medical records of all patients undergoing primary implantation of a HeartMate II LVAS at Brigham and Women’s Hospital between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2014. Reimplantations were excluded. A total of 105 consecutive patients were identified for inclusion. During this time, all primary HeartMate II implantations were performed by a single senior surgeon. Patient demographics, perioperative clinical characteristics, postoperative management practices, and clinical outcomes were collected. Follow up was continued through 6 months after the last pump implantation date.
Anticoagulation management
Immediate post-implantation anticoagulation management was characterized in relation to the standardized clinical protocol recommended by the HM II LVAS manufacturer [ ]. This protocol specifies the early use of intravenous heparin concurrent with warfarin until a therapeutic INR is reached. Our institutional anticoagulation protocol was consistent with this manufacturer protocol (designed to achieve the recommended anticoagulation parameters), and it remained internally unchanged for the duration of this study. In accordance with manufacturer recommendations, our protocol also included the initiation of aspirin 325 mg within 3 days of HM II implantation (or 81 mg if platelet count less than 120,000/mm 3 ).
In this study, we defined a parenteral bridge as initiation of an intravenous anticoagulant prior to the achievement of an INR ≥ 2.0. Partial thromboplastin time (PTT) goals were defined in accordance with the manufacturer protocol: >45 s for the first 0–24 h, > 50 s for the subsequent 24–48 h, and > 55 s for the subsequent 48–72 h of parenteral anticoagulant administration. The medication administration record was reviewed in detail to identify these 24-h periods for each patient based upon exact times of parenteral anticoagulant initiation and discontinuation. Discontinuation was defined by the lack of further parenteral anticoagulation for 24 h.
A parenteral bridge was classified as “early” if initiated ≤ 3 days following device implantation and “therapeutic” if a goal PTT was achieved during each of the first 0–24, 24–48, and 48–72 h of parenteral anticoagulant administration. A parenteral bridge was considered “sub-therapeutic” if a goal PTT was achieved for at least one but not all time periods and “non-therapeutic” if no PTT measurements were at goal. If a parenteral bridge lasted less than 72 h, then application of the above criteria was limited to the duration of administration.
Pump thrombosis
All cases of pump thrombosis in this study were defined pathologically with documented visualization of thrombus on the blood-contacting surfaces of the device, its inflow cannula, or its outflow conduit at the time of pump replacement, pump explant, urgent heart transplantation, or autopsy. This definition is consistent with the standard definition of “confirmed” pump thrombosis [ , ]. “Suspected” pump thrombosis was defined by hospital admission with initiation of a parenteral anticoagulant due to the presence of concerning clinical parameters including rise in LDH, radiographic evidence of cannula thrombosis, or abnormal ramp echo. All patients with a confirmed pump thrombosis had antecedent “suspected” events, and therefore the suspected pump thrombosis cohort is inclusive of patients with confirmed pump thrombosis. The date of suspected pump thrombosis was defined as the date of first clinical recognition, while the date of confirmed pump thrombosis was defined as the date of pathologic detection. For patients with multiple episodes of suspected pump thrombosis, only the date of the first suspected event was recorded. Pump thrombosis was further classified as “early” if it occurred within 6 months of pump implantation.
Statistical analyses
Fisher’s exact test was used to compare categorical variables between groups and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare continuous variables. The cumulative incidence of pump thrombosis was assessed using Gray’s test with reimplantation, explantation, transplantation, or death a competing risk. Two-sided p values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed with R version 3.4.
Results
Baseline characteristics
Between January 2009 and December 2014, 105 patients had a primary HM II implanted at our center (Table 1 ). The majority of patients were men (81%) and the average age was 56 ± 13 years. A total of 49 patients (47%) received a HM II as a bridge to transplantation, 16 (15%) as a bridge to candidacy, and 40 (38%) as destination therapy. There were 152 patient follow-up years (time at risk of primary confirmed pump thrombosis) with patients censored at the time of pump explant for recovery, device malfunction, or transplant. The median duration of primary HM II LVAS support was 431 days (interquartile range 189–781 days).

Anticoagulation practice
Overall 73 (70%) of patients were treated with an initial parenteral anticoagulant bridge following device implantation (Fig. 1 ). Fifty patients were treated with an early bridge started within 3 days of device implantation, with 29 of these early bridged patients achieving therapeutic goal PTT levels at 0–24, 24–48, and 48–72 h. Twenty-three patients were started on a parenteral bridge after 3 days of implant with only 9 achieving target PTT levels. Overall, 38 patients (36% of the total implants, 58% of those treated within 3 days of implant) achieved a therapeutic bridge. The initial parenteral anticoagulant was unfractionated heparin for 55 (75%) patients and bivalirudin for 18 (25%) patients. Nine patients were switched from heparin to bivalirudin mid-bridge, and two patients were switched from bivalirudin to heparin mid-bridge. The median time to bridge initiation following pump implantation was 3 days (range 1–7) and the median bridge duration was 7 days (range 1–45 days).
Fig. 1 Postoperative anticoagulation management
A total of 32 patients (30%) received unopposed warfarin. Time to warfarin initiation and time to therapeutic INR were significantly shorter in patients who received unopposed warfarin as compared to those who received a parenteral bridge, with median values of 1 (range 1–3) versus 2 (range 0–47) days and 5 (range 3–12) versus 8 (range 2–57) days, respectively (p < 0.001 for both). Patients who received any parenteral bridge had lower Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) profiles (p = 0.039) and longer intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (p = 0.005) (Table 2 ). Patients who received an early parenteral bridge also had lower INTERMACS profiles (p = 0.002). Patients who received a therapeutic parenteral bridge had a trend toward lower INTERMACS profiles that did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.054). All but four patients received aspirin 81–325 mg within 3 days of HM II implantation. One patient was not treated with aspirin due to bleeding, and the remaining three patients had aspirin initiated at days 11, 14, and 15 following HM II implantation. None of these four patients had a suspected or confirmed pump thrombosis during the designated follow up period.

Pump thrombosis and anticoagulation practice
A total of 39 patients (37%) had a suspected pump thrombosis over the clinical follow up period, of which 25 (24%) went on to have a confirmed pump thrombosis, representing 0.16 confirmed events per patient-year. Within 6 months of implantation, there were 26 patients with suspected pump thrombosis and 14 patients with confirmed pump thrombosis.
For the cohort of patients with confirmed pump thrombosis, a pre-implant history of systemic hypertension was the only variable that differed by group (p = 0.012), with a greater proportion of patients with confirmed pump thrombosis having hypertension (Table 3 ). There were no significant differences in pump speed at time of discharge, analyzed as either a continuous variable or in dichotomous analyses using pump speed thresholds of 8600 or 9000 rotations per minute (Supplemental Table 1). Furthermore, there were no significant differences between groups in INTERMACS profiles, implantation cardiopulmonary bypass time, reoperation during index hospitalization (including delayed chest closure), red blood cell transfusion after postoperative day 0, or time to first red blood cell transfusion after postoperative day 0. Cumulative incidence analyses showed no significant difference in the overall incidence of confirmed pump thrombosis between patients with a reoperation during the implantation hospital stay, delayed chest closure, or red blood cell transfusion after postoperative day 0 (Supplemental Fig. 1). The incidence of suspected pump thrombosis was also not affected by these characteristics (data not shown).

Point estimates of both suspected and confirmed pump thrombosis incidence demonstrated a lower event rate at 6 months in patients who received a therapeutic bridge (15.8%, 95% CI 6.3–29.1% for suspected; 7.9%, 95% CI 2.0–19.3% for confirmed) compared to those who did not receive a therapeutic bridge (29.9%, CI 19.3–41.1% for suspected; 16.4%, 95% CI 8.7–26.3% for confirmed). This trend was not sustained at 12 and 24 months (Fig. 2 ). Cumulative incidence analyses showed no significant difference in the overall incidence of suspected or confirmed pump thrombosis between patients who did and did not receive a parenteral bridge (p = 0.87 for suspected and p = 0.25 for confirmed) or an early parenteral bridge (p = 0.31 for suspected and p = 0.37 for confirmed) (Fig. 3 ).

Among patients who received any parenteral bridge, there was no significant difference in time to bridge initiation or in total bridge duration between patients who did and did not have a confirmed pump thrombosis (including early confirmed pump thrombosis) (Table 4 a). Early confirmed pump thrombosis occurred in 5 patients (15%) who received unopposed warfarin without a parenteral bridge. There was no difference between patients who did and did not have confirmed pump thrombosis with respect to the time to initiation of warfarin or time to therapeutic INR after implant (Table 4 b). Findings were similar when analyzed according to the outcome of suspected pump thrombosis, without significant differences noted (data not shown).

Discussion
In this study of 105 primary HM II implants, we analyzed comprehensive patient-level data to describe immediate postoperative anticoagulation practices and the relationship between these practices and LVAS pump thrombosis. With this real world analysis, we found 70% adherence to the use of post-implantation parenteral bridging anticoagulation in accordance with manufacturer guidelines. Of those receiving bridging anticoagulation, only 52% qualified as therapeutic according to manufacturer specified anticoagulation intensity targets [ ]. Use of a parenteral bridge was more common in patients with indices of more severe clinical compromise, including lower INTERMACS profile and longer ICU length of stay. Pump thrombosis was a frequent event, with confirmed events occurring in 13% and suspected events occurring in 25% of patients within 6 months of pump implantation. There were no significant associations between the use of a parenteral bridge and the incidence of overall HM II pump thrombosis at two years, however point estimates of cumulative incidences demonstrated a lower rate of pump thrombosis at 6 months with the use of a therapeutic parenteral bridge.
Heightened concern for HM II pump thrombosis arose in 2013 when a multicenter observational study reported a steep increase in confirmed events starting in 2011 [ ], findings corroborated by a 2014 INTERMACS analysis which reported a 6-month actuarial freedom from device exchange or death due to pump thrombosis of 99% in 2009 to 95% in 2011, 93% in 2012, and 92% in 2013 [ ]. Explanations for this observed increase in pump thrombosis have centered on factors related to the device-patient interface as well as clinical management [ ]. Optimal anticoagulation strategy in the immediate period following HM II implantation has been heavily debated. Clinicians confront the difficult task of protecting patients against an intrinsically prothrombotic blood-pump interface while also limiting the risk of surgical bleeding complications.
Despite the challenge of postoperative anticoagulation management in patients with a HM II LVAS, there are little data available to guide clinical practice. Early in the HM II experience, three important studies were published. One study demonstrated significantly lower rates of transfusion for bleeding and no increase in pump thrombosis if postoperative heparin was omitted [ ], while two other studies found that a lower target INR range was not associated with an increase in thromboembolic complications [ , ]. No subsequent study has specifically examined the relationship between initial postoperative anticoagulation strategies and the risk of downstream pump thrombosis following the observed increase in event rates.
In this study, we present a single-center account of patient-level data that is of sufficient detail to provide insight into real world anticoagulation practices with respect to the timing and intensity of post-implant anticoagulation. While postoperative parenteral bridging anticoagulation was common (70% of patients) and frequently initiated within 3 days of HM II implant (68% of bridged patients), successful execution of therapeutic bridging was achieved in only 52% of cases. We also found that patients with more severe heart failure (low INTERMACS score) were more likely to be bridged. This finding may indicate a preference for the greater degree of control offered by the use of rapidly reversible parenteral anticoagulants in complicated patients at higher perceived risk of postoperative bleeding, compared with the early use of unopposed warfarin in less critically ill patients. There was no difference in reoperation or red blood cell transfusion rates in patients who did and did not receive a parenteral bridge, suggesting that selection of a parenteral bridge was more a response to clinical compromise than a cause. Our findings validate the commonly experienced clinical tension between the desire to prevent thromboembolism and the difficulty of achieving this goal in a complex postoperative patient population at high risk of bleeding in a real world setting outside of the carefully monitored clinical trial environment.
The recent Prevention of HeartMate II Pump Thrombosis Through Clinical Management (PREVENT) multicenter study of 300 patients found that full adherence to a standardized protocol of implant technique, pump speed, and antithrombotic therapy was associated with a low rate of pump thrombosis of just 1.9% at 6 months [ ]. This standardized protocol included the use of a postoperative parenteral anticoagulation bridge, with a reported overall adherence rate of 95%, with 21 of 23 sites having greater than 80% adherence to the use of heparin bridging for all of their subjects. The definition of adherence and specific details of the timing and intensity of parenteral bridging were not reported. The PREVENT study was also not powered to identify the effects of the individual components of the practice recommendations – implantation technique, heparin anticoagulation, and pump speed – on pump thrombosis development. We provide detailed assessment of the specific contribution of bridging anticoagulation to HM II thrombosis, with clear definitions of parenteral bridge practices according to timing of administration and therapeutic success. Point estimates of cumulative incidences suggest a lower 6-month rate of pump thrombosis when therapeutic parenteral bridging is used. At two years follow up, however, there was no significant difference in the incidence of overall HM II pump thrombosis according to use of a therapeutic parenteral bridge. These results suggest that post-implant parenteral bridging impacts early but not late pump thrombosis. These results affirm the PREVENT bridging recommendation and reinforce concerns that the transient hypercoagulable state induced by unopposed warfarin initiation may contribute to early pump thrombosis risk. This concept is further supported by our finding that 5 of 32 (16%) patients treated with unopposed warfarin had early confirmed pump thrombosis, while only one developed late pump thrombosis.
This study has several limitations. Results are restricted to the initial choice of early postoperative anticoagulation. To address this, we have included data on events associated with anticoagulation interruption, including delayed chest closure, reoperation, and red blood cell transfusions. These factors were not associated with an increased incidence of pump thrombosis. As a single center analysis, our results may not be reflective of broader trends in practice across experienced centers. However, all primary pump implants were performed by a single senior surgeon, which reduces variation in implant technique and pump positioning, factors demonstrated to affect the risk of pump thrombosis [ , ]. Although our results are restricted to the HM II LVAS, this device remains the most widely implanted LVAS at this time [ ]. Initial study of the centrifugal-flow HeartMate 3 (HM 3) has demonstrated a dramatic reduction in the 6-month incidence of pump thrombosis [ ]. Although this result is primarily attributed to innovative pump design, it is notable that the HM 3 trial protocol included the use of an initial parenteral anticoagulation bridge. Thus, while advances in pump design offer exciting potential for reduction in the incidence of pump thrombosis, the relative importance of early bridging anticoagulation in this setting remains unclear.
In conclusion, this single-center experience with 105 consecutive primary HM II implants demonstrates that the use of initial postoperative parenteral bridging anticoagulation is common as recommended by manufacturer guidelines but frequently sub-therapeutic. We demonstrate that achieving therapeutic parenteral anticoagulation as a bridge to warfarin post-implant results in a lower point estimate of the cumulative incidence of confirmed pump thrombosis and suspected pump thrombosis at 6 months in clinical practice. These findings suggest that the intensity of post implant bridging is a contributing factor in early pump thrombosis. At two years post-implant, however, there was no significant statistical association between initial anticoagulation strategy and the overall incidence of pump thrombosis. Prospective studies are needed to confirm the independent role of post-implant parenteral bridging on pump thrombosis. These studies should include detailed information on the achievement of anticoagulation targets as described in our study to provide guidance in optimization of the care of patients with LVAS.
