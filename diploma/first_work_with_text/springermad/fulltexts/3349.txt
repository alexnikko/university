Introduction
Cardiac hypertrophy is an important predictor of cardiovascular indisposition and mortality. It presents a threat of progressing into heart failure and even sudden death [ ] since it is affected by several factors like diabetes mellitus, hypertension and renal disorders [ , ]. Several new targets and pathways are being identified for cardiovascular diseases [ , ]. Posttranslational modifications of histones play a crucial role in regulation of transcription [ ].
Histone acetylation and deacetylation are regulated by two sets of opposing enzymes—histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs), respectively [ ]. Histone acetyltransferase produces acetylation of histones resulting into the activation of gene expression [ ]. On the contrary, histone deacetylases (HDACs) remove acetyl group from histones, resulting in its hypoacetylation. As a consequence, decline in space occurs between the nucleosome and DNA wrapped around it. The tighter wrapping of DNA diminishes the accessibility for transcription factors to bind to DNA, leading to repression of transcription [ ]. There are different classes of HDACs. The class I HDAC enzymes consisting of HDAC 1, 2, 3 and 8 are more closely related to the yeast ( Saccharomyces cereisiae ) transcriptional regulator RPD3 and are primarily located in the nucleus [ ]. On the other contrary, class II HDAC enzymes, which are homologous to yeast Hda1, shuttle between the cytoplasm and nucleus. Class II HDACs are further classified into class IIa (HDAC 4, 5, 7 and 9) and class IIb (HDAC 6 and 10) [ , ]. HDAC 11, which is zinc dependent, shares similarity to class I and II HDAC enzymes and hence is uncategorized [ , ]. Various data suggest that class I and class II HDACs play contrasting roles in cardiac hypertrophy with class I HDAC being prohypertrophic and class II being anti-hypertrophic [ ].
Sodium butyrate has been clinically tested as an anticancer drug [ ]. The anticancer activity of sodium butyrate is generally ascribed to its non-specific HDAC inhibitory action, inhibiting both class I and class II HDACs [ , ]. Sodium butyrate is also reported to provide protection against adriamycin-induced cardiotoxicity [ ]. It suppresses myocardial remodeling and improves cardiac function in diabetic heart [ ]. Despite above-mentioned facts, direct reports of effect of sodium butyrate on cardiac hypertrophy are not available. Hence, aim of the present research was to study the effect of sodium butyrate (SB) on experimentally induced cardiac hypertrophy.
Methods and Materials
Animals and Experimental Protocols
The ethical approval for the animal usage was taken from the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee (IAEC) as per the guidance of the Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision of Experiments on Animals (CPCSEA), Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, Government of India, New Delhi. Adult Wistar rats, 6–8 week of age, of both the sexes were distributed into the following groups: CON—sham control, COB—sham control animals treated with sodium butyrate, HIC—hypertrophic control animals, HIB—hypertrophic animals treated with sodium butyrate. Sodium butyrate was dissolved in saline and was given per oral in dose of 5 mg/kg daily for eight weeks.
Partial Abdominal Aortic Constriction (PAAC)
Treatment of drug was started from 0th day in sham-treated and PAAC-treated animals. Surgical procedure was done on third day in PAAC control and PAAC-treated animal under anesthesia produced by ketamine (20 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). Incision was made in abdominal wall to expose abdominal aorta. Abdominal aorta was ligated suprarenal with 4.0 silk suture along with 7–0-mm blunt needle. Thereafter, needle was removed to leave abdominal aorta partially constricted. Sham control and sham-treated animal had undergone the same procedure except constriction of abdominal aorta [ ].
Blood Sample Collection and Serum Analysis
At the end of eight weeks, animals were bled, under light ether anesthesia, from the retro orbital plexuses of each rat. Serum was parted and analyzed for total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), triglycerides, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP) and creatinine kinase-MB (CK-MB) through biochemical analyzer (Prietest TOUCH Biochemistry Analyzer, 2.622 A, ROBONIK Pvt. Ltd.) using diagnostic kits (Labcare Diagnostics Pvt. Ltd., India) [ , ].
Invasive Hemodynamics
After blood collection and analysis, the animals were subjected to carotid artery cannulation for measurement of hemodynamic parameters using a transducer (BP 100) and Labscrib Systems (IWORX, New Hampshire, USA) as per previously reported methods [ , ]. Mean arterial blood pressure (MABP), rate of pressure development (dp/dtmax) and decay (dp/dtmin) and heart rate were measured. Labscribe software was used for analysis of the data (version 118).
Hypertrophy Assessment
Immediately after carotid artery cannulation, animals were euthanized by using an overdose of ketamine (80 mg/kg IM), hearts were isolated, and superfluous tissues were removed. The wet weight of the entire heart, right ventricle, left ventricle was measured. The femur was isolated, and length was noted. The left ventricular (LV) hypertrophic index (LVHI) and cardiac hypertrophic index (CHI) were calculated as per previously reported method [ , , ]. Further, left ventricular weight to right ventricular weight ratio (LVW/RVW) and weight to body weight ratio (HW/BW) were also estimated. We used left ventricular (LV) wall thickness measured using screw gauge micrometer [ ].
Oxidative Stress Measurement
Oxidative stress levels were measured in the left ventricular tissue of heart samples by preparing homogenate of left ventricle [ , ]. Quantification of tissue protein levels [ ], malondialdehyde levels (MDA) [ ], reduced glutathione levels (GSH) [ ] and superoxide dismutase levels (SOD) [ ] was performed.
Mitochondrial DNA Isolation and Quantification
Isolation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from the left ventricle of heart samples and mtDNA amount was determined by the method of Barja and Herrero [ ], by measuring the fluorescence after binding of the Hoechst 33258 dye.
Histopathological and Morphometric Analysis
Hematoxylin and eosin staining of left ventricular tissue sections was carried out at Sukoon Pathologies Laboratory, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India. Left ventricular tissue sections from four hearts in each treatment were studied under OLYMPUS (trinocular-CX21FS1) microscope with 400× magnifications for examination of overall morphology of left ventricle, and cell diameter measurements were taken with ImageJ analyzer software (NIH) 1.45 [ , ].
mRNA Expression Studies
Total ribonucleic acid (RNA) was extracted from intact hearts using the FastRNA ® Pro Green Kit (MPBIO) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The reverse transcription (RT) reaction was performed using first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Novagen). Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed in LightCycler ® 480 (Roche Applied Biosciences) using TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix for determining mRNA levels of histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) and histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5). Specific primers were designed with the ‘Primer3Plus’ program for HDAC2 (Sense: 5′-ACTTGCCGTTGCTGATGCTT-3′; Anti-sense: 5′-TTGAACACCAGGCGCATGT-3′) and HDAC5 (Sense: 5′-GCAGGAGAGCTCAAGAATGGA-3′; Anti-sense: 5′-AAGTTCCCATTGTCGTAGCGA-3′). All reactions were performed in duplicate. The PCR product was separated using electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel and semi-quantified as a ratio to GAPDH.
Statistical Analysis
All the values were expressed as mean ± SEM. Statistical analysis between normal control and disease control groups and between disease control and disease treated group was performed using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s posttest, using Prism 5.01 (GraphPad software). A p value less than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.

Oxidative Stress Parameters
PAAC control rats exhibited a significant increase in LV MDA levels and a significant decrease in LV GSH and SOD levels as compared to control group. Treatment with sodium butyrate significantly reduced LV MDA levels and significantly ( p < 0.05) increased LV GSH and SOD levels (Table 3 ).
mRNA Expression of HDAC2 and HDAC5
PAAC control rats exhibited a significant relative fold increase in HDAC2 and HDAC5 mRNA levels as compared to control rats. Treatment with sodium butyrate significantly reduced the expression of HDAC2 in PAAC hypertrophic rats as compared to control rats. However, administration of sodium butyrate in PAAC hypertrophic rats did not produce any significant change in HDAC5 mRNA levels as compared to control rats (Fig. 2 ).

Discussion
This study demonstrates, for the first time, the beneficial role of sodium butyrate in pressure overload model of cardiac hypertrophy, i.e., PAAC. Although sodium butyrate is reported as non-specific HDAC inhibitor, we have found that sodium butyrate inhibits class I HDAC in heart without altering class II HDACs. Mammalian HDAC family includes 18 enzymes. Class I HDAC enzymes consist of HDAC 1, 2, 3 and 8, whereas class II HDAC enzymes consist of HDAC 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 10 [ ]. Class I HDAC enzymes have been implicated in promotion of cardiac hypertrophy through stimulation of prohypertrophic pathway [ ]. Overexpression of HDAC2 and its role in inhibition of anti-hypertrophic factors like KLF4 and Inpp5f has been found in ablation of cardiac hypertrophy [ ]. On the contrary, class II HDAC enzymes have been implicated as inhibitors of prohypertrophic pathways. HDAC 4, 5 and 9 have been found to interact with myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) and regress hypertrophy [ ]. In lieu of this, HDAC2—a class I HDAC enzyme—and HDAC5—a class II HDAC mRNA levels—were measured in the heart in the present study. In the present investigation, HDAC2 and HDAC5 mRNA level was significantly increased in hypertrophic rats as compared to control rats. Increase in anti-hypertrophic HDAC5 might be due to an adaptive mechanism of heart due to pressure overload. Chronic treatment with sodium butyrate significantly reduced the HDAC2 mRNA level, but had no significant effect on HDA5 mRNA level. This could be attributed to the fact that, possibly, sodium butyrate inhibits prohypertrophic HDAC, i.e., HDAC2, and preserves the expression of anti-hypertrophic HDAC, i.e., HDAC5.
Left ventricular hypertrophy is characterized by collagen accumulation and other extracellular matrix elements which lead to ventricular fibrosis [ ]. In the present study, there was a significant increase in LV cardiac collagen deposition in PAAC-induced cardiac hypertrophic rats and treatment with sodium butyrate prevented the PAAC-induced LV collagen deposition. Phenylbutyrate was found to decrease type 1 collagen levels in human lung fibroblasts by its HDAC inhibitory and cAMP regulatory mechanisms [ ].
In the earlier stage, hypertrophied ventricle is able to compensate for increased work load, but eventually in the later stages, impairment of diastolic function followed by systolic function is observed, resulting in decompensation and heart failure [ ]. In the present study, hypertrophic rats exhibited hypertension, tachycardia and a significant decline in the rate of pressure development (d p /d t max ) and decay (d p /d t min ), which are indicative of left ventricular dysfunction. Treatment with sodium butyrate significantly controlled these hemodynamic alterations. Thus, sodium butyrate produces beneficial effect in preserving the left ventricular functioning.
Dyslipidemia is one of the most modifiable risk factors for CVDs. PAAC is a model of pathological hypertrophy and is associated with decreased fatty acid oxidation [ ]. Hence, in current study, we measured the lipid profile in PAAC control animals, which was found to be significantly altered, and treatment with sodium butyrate controlled the dyslipidemia.
Oxidative stress leads to damage of cardiomyocytes, dysfunctioning of endothelium, increased collagen synthesis and apoptosis which ultimately progresses into myocardial remodeling and cardiac failure [ ]. In the present study, there was a significant increase in pro-oxidant malondialdehyde levels and decrease in antioxidant enzyme activity which includes reduced glutathione and superoxide dismutase levels in left ventricle of the rats. Treatment with sodium butyrate significantly prevented this oxidative stress. It has been reported that owing to its HDAC inhibitory activity, phenylbutyrate might have increased MnSOD levels against adriamycin toxicity in a mouse model [ ]. In consistent with these reports, sodium butyrate owing to its HDAC inhibitory activity prevents oxidative stress in the myocardium.
Cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure have been frequently linked to accumulation of the deleted forms of mtDNA in the myocardium [ ]. In the present study, PAAC-induced cardiac hypertrophic rats exhibited decreased mtDNA concentration in left ventricle which was significantly increased by sodium butyrate treatment. Improvement in the cardiac functions was also supported by histopathological study of the transverse section of left ventricle tissue which showed prevention of cardiac hypertrophic changes and retaining of the normal architecture of the left ventricle.
More than three decades ago, several early in vitro and in vivo studies reported that sodium butyrate inhibits HDAC [ , ]. Subsequently, the detailed mechanism of sodium butyrate on HDAC was reported in 2003. Sp1 and Sp3 are mammalian transcription factors that function as activators or repressors which recruit HDAC2 and action of sodium butyrate is mediated through Sp1/Sp3 binding site, thus inhibiting HDAC2 [ ]. It has been reported that Hsp70-Hsp90 (Hop), heart-enriched nuclear factor, is a cardiac-specific regulator of gene transcription and generates cardiac hypertrophy by recruitment of class I HDAC—specifically HDAC2 [ ]. Further, it has been suggested that overexpression of cardiomyocyte-specific HDAC2 aggravates cardiac hypertrophy [ ]. Thus, this shows that sodium butyrate by virtue of its HDAC2 inhibition action controls cardiac hypertrophy.
To best of our knowledge, ours is the first report suggesting that sodium butyrate inhibits HDAC2 but does not alter HDAC5. Currently several HDAC inhibitors are under research for their cardioprotective action. Current investigation provides a base for future studies to alter the structure of sodium butyrate using molecular modeling and computer-aided drug design and develop novel molecules which enhance HDAC5 action and inhibit HDAC2.
Conclusions
Sodium butyrate produces beneficial effect on PAAC-induced cardiac hypertrophy through downregulation of class I HDACs, specifically HDAC2 without any effect on class II HDAC, i.e., HDAC5. Thus, selective class I HDAC inhibition is required for controlling cardiac hypertrophy. Newer HDAC inhibitors which are class I inhibitor and class II promoter can be designed to obtain a ‘pan’ or ‘dual’ natural HDAC ‘regulators.’
