INTRODUCTION
The chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is effective in the management of cancers which include colorectal, stomach, lung, ovarian, and breast cancers. “The drug is also effective against pre-cancerous skin lesions, actinic keratosis, viral warts, and basal cell carcinoma” ( , ). The effectiveness of the drug against various types of skin cancer has prompted the development of its topical dosage form due to which 5-FU is also available in a form of cream besides capsule, tablets, or injection solution. However, unfortunately, 5-FU which is a BCS class III drug exhibits low permeability ( ). The major challenge while developing oral and topical dosage forms for 5-FU is to overcome the poor permeability of the drug that decreases its bioavailability. Many techniques have been employed to overcome this challenge. In case of topical application, liposomes ( ), niosomes ( ), microspheres ( ), 5-FU micelle carrier ( ), etc. , have been used while strategies like the PLGA nanoparticle “hot-melt” method of microencapsulation have been used for improvement of oral bioavailability ( ). Pharmaceutical cocrystallization is one of the promising techniques that offers assistance in life cycle management through potential advantages of enhanced solubility, dissolution, bioavailability, permeability, and stabilization of unstable compound via intermolecular interactions ( , , ).
The application of this technique for solubility improvement is very well documented. But, the advantage of cocrystals for permeability enhancement is scarce. Sanphui et al ( ) and Dai et al ( ) have used cocrystallization to increase the oral and topical penetration of 5-FU. In the present manuscript, attempts were made to prepare cocrystals of 5-FU with a series of new coformers (gentisic acid (5-FUGA), 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (5-FUBA), and p -aminopyridine). Emphasis is given on evaluation studies such as oral absorption and topical permeation as compared to the drug and is ascertained by ex vivo and cell line studies.
Both 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid and gentisic acid are phenolic compounds found in many food plants having a variety of physiological activities which are of great benefit to health, including antioxidant and free radical scavenging activities. It is also used for chemical carcinogenesis and exhibits or exerts pro-apoptotic as well as antiproliferative effects in various cancerous tissues ( , , ).
The third conformer ( p -aminopyridine) possesses aqueous solubility and permeability. Besides this, it improves visual function and motor skills and relieves fatigue in patients with multiple sclerosis ( ).
EXPERIMENTAL
Materials
5-Fluorouracil was procured free of cost as a gift sample from Venus Remedies Pvt. Ltd., Chandigarh, India. Gentisic acid, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, and 4-aminopyridine (5-FUPN) were 99% pure and supplied from HiMedia Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai, India. The different solvents used for cocrystallization were of AR grade.
Preparation of Cocrystals
5-FU cocrystals with gentisic acid cocrystals were prepared by two methods: solvent-assisted grinding ( , ) and solution crystallization (5-FUGA) ( ). (i) In 5-FUGA, equimolar quantities of 5-FU (130.07 mg, 1 mmol) and gentisic acid (154.12 mg, 1 mmol) were ground using a mortar and pestle with the addition of 20–30 drops of ethanol for 1 h. The powder was dried and kept in airtight vials in a desiccator. (ii) Equimolar quantities of 5-FU (26.01 mg, 1 mmol) and gentisic acid (38.53 mg, 1 mmol) were dissolved into 4 mL of ethanol in a 25-mL conical flask and allowed to evaporate slowly at room temperature. After 10 days, needle-shaped single crystal was obtained. This crystal was filtered from the remaining solvent and dried under vacuum at 30°C and further stored in airtight vials. Crystals were found to be suitable for single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis ( ).
5-FUBA
The stoichiometric amount of 5-FU (130.07 mg, 1 mmol) and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic (154.12 mg, 1 mmol) was triturated using a glass mortar and pestle with the addition of few drops of ethanol for 60 min. Resulting solids were dried and kept in a desiccator under controlled humidity and temperature conditions and were characterized by different analytical techniques such as differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( ).
5-FUPN
Accurately weighed 5-FU (130.07 mg, 1 mmol) was triturated for 60 min in a glass mortar and pestle with former 4-aminopyridine (94.11 mg, 1 mmol). The drop-by-drop addition of solvent (ethanol) accelerated the molecular mobility and promoted high atomic efficiency. Resulting solids were dried and kept in a desiccator under controlled humidity and temperature conditions and subjected to characterization ( ).
Characterization
Differential Scanning Calorimetry
Thermal analysis of the cocrystal was performed by utilizing DSC Q20 (TA Instruments, USA). The accurately weighed amounts (2–3 mg) were placed in standard aluminum pans and sealed. The samples were scanned at a ramping rate of 10°C min −1 with a flow rate of 50 mL min −1 over dry nitrogen condition. The resultant data were analyzed with Advantage software supplied by TA Q Series. Before performing the thermal analysis, “DSC was calibrated with the help of indium.” First, all the empty cells were scanned from − 10 to 500°C at a ramping rate of 50°C min −1 with a flow rate of 100 mL min −1 over dry nitrogen condition. After that, the accurately weighed indium (3 mg) was placed in standard aluminum pans and sealed. The samples were scanned from 0 to 250°C at a ramping rate of 10°C min −1 with a flow rate of 50 mL min −1 over dry nitrogen condition.
Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
The infrared spectrum of the sample was obtained by an RX-I FTIR spectrometer employed in KBr diffuse reflectance mode. The sample (2 mg) was mixed in 20 mg of KBr, and the spectra were collected over the range of 4000–400 cm −1 . The analysis of data was done with the assistant of spectrum software, and eight cumulative scans were performed for each spectrum.
Powder X-Ray Diffraction
The X’Pert PRO diffractometer system having a Cu Kα radiation (1.54060 Å) was used to obtain the PXRD spectra. The tube current, voltage, and divergence slit and antiscattering slit were set at 45 mA, 40 kV, and 0.48° for the illumination on the 10 mm sample size. The aluminum sample holder was used for packing the sample and was scanned continuously 5–50° at 2 θ with a step size of 0.017°. X’Pert HighScore software was employed for the refinement of experimental PXRD patterns.
Solid-State Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy
A JEOL resonance 400 MHz spectrometer (JEOL, MA, USA, at IISc Bangalore, India) was employed to record the 13 C NMR spectra. The spectra were carried out on a 4-mm double-resonance CP-MAS probe at a 10 kHz spinning rate with a cross-polarization contact time of 3.5 ms and a delay of 5 s using Delta™ NMR software.
Intrinsic Dissolution
An intrinsic dissolution study was performed for 3 h in pH 6.8 (phosphate buffer) and pH 1.2 (0.1 N HCl) on the dissolution testing apparatus (Labindia DS 8000). A standard curve of 5-FU was obtained in both the media by HPLC at 265 nm. “The drug samples (100 mg), as well as cocrystals (100 mg), were passed through sieve no. 80 before performing the in vitro evaluation of the crystals via dissolution. This provides homogeneous particle size for the sample in the range of 0.175–0.177 mm.” This fine power further compressed at 2000 psi in die cavity with the aid of a bench top carver. After that, the base plate was disconnected from the die and a smooth, compact pellet with a “0.5 cm 2 surface” area was exposed and the shaft was mounted on the stirring drive. Further, dies were lowered into the dissolution vessel ( , , , ) having 900 mL of phosphate buffer at the temperature 37°C ± 1°C in one set of experiments. In another set of experiments, 900 mL of 0.1 N HCl was used as dissolution media. A speed regulating device was used that allowed the shaft rotation speed to be selected and maintained at the specified rate of 100 rpm. At a pre-determined time interval, a 5-mL aliquot was withdrawn and replaced by fresh media. The samples were filtered via nylon filters (0.45 μm), and the concentration was determined from the standard curve of the 5-FU in the respective media. Intrinsic dissolution rate (IDR) of the compounds was determined per unit time from the linear region of the dissolution curve. The experiment was performed in triplicate.
High-Performance Liquid Chromatography
The Waters Alliance system with the Waters 2695 separation module and Waters 2996 photodiode was used for HPLC analysis. A Thermo Fisher C18 5-μm column (4.6 mm × 150 mm) was used. A mixture of methanol and water (10:90) was used as mobile phase with 0.8 mL min −1 of the flow rate of four separations. Empower 2.0 software was utilized for data acquisition and analysis.
Crystal Structure Determination from Single-Crystal X-Ray Diffraction
Single-Crystal X-Ray Diffraction
A Bruker AXS Kappa APEX II diffractometer having a CCD detector with sealed-tube monochromated Mo Kα radiation (0.71073 Å) was used for SCXRD data collection. All the parameters like unit cell determination, data collection, refinement, and crystal centering were controlled by the APEX2 program. The narrow-frame algorithm was used for integrating frames with Bruker SAINT software. The data for absorption effects were corrected by the multi-scan method (SADABS) ( ). SHELXS-97 was used for solving the structure and further refined against F2 using SHELXL-97. SHELXTL V 11.0 was used for performing calculations. No residual peak > 1 e /A was observed. The hydrogen atoms were refined with isotropic displacement parameters. Hydrogen bonding parameters were produced with PLATON, and figures were drawn using Mercury V 3.2 ( ).
Crystal Structure Determination from PXRD
The Reflex Plus module of Materials Studio (BIOVIA 7.0) was used to determine crystal structure from PXRD data. XCell was used for indexing the peaks that range from 5 to 40° at 2 θ in the powder diffraction pattern to generate crystal unit cell. The Pawley refinement was performed until the figure of merit reached a good quality of fit. Before performing the power solving, the structure of drug and coformer was geometrically optimized using the DMol3 module (Scheme 1 ). Then, the optimized drug and coformer were introduced to powder solving using a simulated annealing algorithm, followed by the Rietveld refinement. Scheme 1 Chemical structures of the drug and coformers
Ex Vivo Skin Permeation and Dermatokinetic Studies
CPCSEA guidelines were followed to carry out all the experiments on the animal (PU/IAEC/5/15/51). The hair of the skin of male Wistar rats (weighing 180–200 g) was removed carefully by using a surgical blade. The removed skin (1.5 mm thick) was defeated, washed, and rinsed with saline. The integrity of the skin was checked microscopically for any cuts or pores. After that, the skin was fixed on a vertical Franz diffusion cell with a 3.14 cm 2 surface area. After, the stratum corneum was fixed towards the donor compartment and the dermal side towards the receptor compartment ( , ). The excess of 5-FU (40 mg) and its cocrystals was added to 1 mL of isopropyl myristate, and the suspensions were placed on a donor chamber and stirred at 100 rpm. At pre-determined time intervals, a 0.2-mL aliquot was withdrawn from the receptor chamber and replaced by an equal volume of fresh medium. The samples were filtered through a 0.45-μm nylon filter, and the concentration of 5-FU and its cocrystals was analyzed by HPLC. Dermatokinetics is a study where the drug concentration is determined in the skin continuously or intermittently for specific periods of time ( , ). Further, the preparation of diffusion cell assembly and skin was done as discussed in the above section. However, the only difference is that at the sampling point (1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 8 h, and 10 h), whole skin was removed from the assembly and washed two to three times with water to remove the adhering preparation. The skin was dipped in hot water for 30 s for the separation of both the layers (epidermis and dermis). The separated layers were cut into small fragments and sonicated for 5–10 min with the addition of 5–10 mL of methanol until the complete extraction of 5-FU from skin layers was obtained ( , , ). The solutions were filtered using a nylon filter (0.22 mm), and the supernatant was further analyzed using the HPLC method.
Cell Culture
Three cancer cell lines (MCF-7, Hela, and Caco-2; American Type Culture Collection) were procured from the NCCS, Pune, India. Cytogenetic analysis was performed to confirm authenticity. These cells were cultured according to their essential media. The MCF-7, Hela, and Caco-2 cells (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)) were made to adhered to plastic and grown in RPMI 1640 medium which was supplemented with 10% ( v / v ) fetal bovine serum, 1% ( v / v ) penicillin (100 units mL −1 ), 1% ( v/ v ) streptomycin (100 jigs mL −1 ), and 1% ( v / v ) l -glutamine (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA). Cells were maintained at 37°C in a 5% CO 2 –95% air atmosphere. Cell washing is done with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before subculture, and after every 48 h, the growth medium was changed. The cells were detached by trypsinization by employing trypsin-0.02% EDTA (0.05%).
Cell Viability Studies
Colorimetric MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay was used to determine the overall cell growth. It is based on the capability of a viable cell to reduce the yellow MTT reagent to a purple formazan product, a reaction occurring in mitochondria. These cells, after being sealed in 96-well plates (5 × 10 3 cells/well), were allowed to stand in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO 2 ) overnight at 37°C. After that, these cells were treated with 5-fluorouracil and its cocrystals at various concentrations (1 μg mL −1 , 10 μg mL −1 , 20 μg mL −1 , 30 μg mL −1 , 40 μg mL −1 , and 50 μg mL −1 ) and then incubated with 0.5 mg mL −1 of MTT for 4 h at 37°C, resulting into formazan crystals. Formazan crystals were dissolved in DMSO. The plates were left in a cell incubator for 3–4 h until formazan completely dissolved. After mixing on an orbital shaker, the number of living cells in treatment and control groups was directly proportional to the intensity of the purple product, which was quantitatively measured by a microplate reader (EnSpire, PE) at 570 nm. Each experiment was carried out in triplet ( ). $$ \%\mathrm{cell}\ \mathrm{viability}=\mathrm{treated}\ \mathrm{cells}/\mathrm{control}\ \mathrm{cells}\times 100\% $$
Statistical Analysis
The statistical analysis was run using SigmaPlot (version 11.1) by applying one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison tests. Statistical significance was considered at a P value < 0.05.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
As explained in the “ EXPERIMENTAL ” section, three cocrystals of 5-FU were prepared with 5-FUGA, 5-FUBA, and 5-FUPN (Scheme 1 ). After, preliminary characterizations of the cocrystals were performed by determining their melting point and comparing it with the parent drug molecules. According to the FDA, cocrystal is required to have a Δp K a difference of less than 1 between the coformers, indicating non-ionic species and minimal proton sharing. Moreover, in general, a larger Δp K a value (greater than 3) often results in the salt formation and a smaller Δp K a value (less than 1) will almost exclusively result in cocrystal formation. However, that parameter is inappropriate for accurately predicting cocrystal in the solid state when the Δp K a value is between 1 and 3, which is a relatively narrow range at the interface of salts and cocrystals. Structural information obtained from the single-crystal X-ray analysis, FTIR spectroscopy, and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) spectroscopy has shown the existence of cocrystals in many systems where the Δp K a value is expected to yield salt ( , , , ). Now, in the present manuscript, the p K a value of 5-FU, gentisic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, and 4-aminopyridine is 8.02, 2.53, 5.54, and 9.17, respectively. The differences of Δp K a are 1.15 in case of 5-FUPN cocrystal, 3.48 in case of 5-FUBA, and 5.49 in case of 5-FUGA. Thus, based upon the Δp K a , the isolated compounds were subjected to spectroscopic and structural analyses to confirm the existence of cocrystals.
Differential Scanning Calorimetry
DSC thermogram of 5-FU displayed a sharp single melting peak at 285.06°C which is followed by degradation, whereas the melting point of each of the coformers (GA, BA, and PN) showed a sharp single endotherm at 206.52°C, 204.07°C, and 154.38°C, respectively. However, in the DSC curve of 5-FUGA, 5-FUBA, and 5-FUPN, a single endothermic peak appeared at 233.28°C, 221.49°C, and 207.59°C, respectively, which is in between the melting point of 5-FU and the coformers, suggesting the presence of a new phase (cocrystal) different from the original components (Fig. 1 ). The shift in the melting point is due to the change in the crystal lattice of the drug in the presence of coformer, leading to the formation of cocrystals. Fig. 1 DSC thermograms of a cocrystal of 5-fluorouracil–gentisic acid, b cocrystal of 5-fluorouracil–3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, and c cocrystal of 5-fluorouracil– p -aminopyridine
Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
FTIR is an excellent analytical technique to study the changes in the position caused by the vibration modes of the functional groups. This technique reveals the shift in characteristic peaks of drug and coformer due to cocrystal formation involving H bonding between the corresponding functional groups. The FTIR spectrum of 5-FUGA showed a shift in the carbonyl stretch (C=O) of 5-FU from 1725 to 1717 cm −1 and in the N–H stretch from 3068 to 3078 cm −1 ( , ). A variation in the spectra of conformer (GA) was observed as the C=O stretch at 1671 cm −1 shifted to 1676 cm −1 and the O–H stretch shifted from 3137 to 3132 cm −1 , respectively. This suggests the formation of hydrogen bonding between the C=O and NH groups of 5-FU with the hydroxyl group of GA (Fig. 2 (c)). Fig. 2 FTIR spectra of ( a ) 5-fluorouracil, ( b ) gentisic acid, ( c ) cocrystal of 5-fluorouracil–gentisic acid, ( d ) 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, ( e ) cocrystal of 5-fluorouracil–3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, ( f ) p -aminopyridine, and ( g ) cocrystal of 5-fluorouracil– p -aminopyridine
Similarly, the FTIR spectra of cocrystal 5-FUBA showed a shift in the carbonyl stretch of 5-FU (C=O) from 1725 to 1719 cm −1 and in the N–H stretch from 3068 to 3103 cm −1 . While in the coformer (BA), the C=O stretch has shifted from 1673 to 1678 cm −1 and the O–H stretch from 3549 to 3538 cm −1 (Fig. 2 (e)). This indicates the formation of the hydrogen bond between carbonyl and –NH of 5-FU with a hydroxyl and a carboxylic group of BA.
Moreover, as shown in Fig. 2 (g), in case of 5-FUPN, the carbonyl (C=O) stretch and N–H stretch of 5-FU shifted to 1720 cm −1 and 3096 cm −1 , respectively. The spectra of PN shows a shift in the N–H stretch along with the C–N stretch from 3435 to 3405 cm −1 and from 1212 to 1218 cm −1 , respectively. This confirmed the presence of the hydrogen bonding between NH 2 and ring nitrogen of PN with C=O and N–H of 5-FU drug.
Powder X-Ray Diffraction
The PXRD analysis of 5-FUGA also witnesses the appearance of new peaks at 10.98, 14.87, 17.05, and 17.58 which was different from that of the drug and coformer. Certain characteristic peaks of 5-FU at 2 θ values of 11.30, 15.99, 20.07, and 32.88 disappeared while a characteristic peak at a 2 θ value of 22.52 has been shifted to 22.22. Moreover, in GA, the characteristic peak at 2 θ values of 25.18, 27.06, 29.04, and 31.71 has disappeared and some peaks at 7.45 and 19.21 have shifted to 7.60 and 19.48, respectively (Fig. 3 b). Fig. 3 Power X-ray diffraction pattern of a 5-FU, b 5-FUGA cocrystal, c 5-FUBA cocrystal, and d 5-FUPN cocrystal
Moreover, in the cocrystal of 5-FUBA, some new peaks at 2 θ values of 8.45, 19.40, 23.70, 30.74, and 41.09 have been observed which were absent in both 5-FU and BA. Moreover, certain unique peaks of 5-FU at 11.30, 15.90, 21.90, and 22.53 have disappeared and few peaks have shifted from 15.73, 27.92, and 33.30 to 15.41, 27.76, and 33.56, respectively. Similarly, some unique peaks of BA at 21.63, 24.45, and 31.12 have disappeared, while peaks at 2 θ values of 15.04 and 25.77 have shifted to 15.26 and 25.15, respectively (Fig. 3 c).
Similarly, variations were observed in the PXRD pattern (Fig. 3 d) of 5-FUPN cocrystal as some unique peaks at 2 θ values of 14.96, 26.91, 27.62, 31.57, and 34.88 have appeared which were absent in the drug as well as coformer. Moreover, some characteristic peaks of 5-FU at 11.30, 15.99, and 32.20 disappeared while some peaks at 16.33 and 22.53 shifted to 16.75 and 22.18, respectively. Besides this, few peaks of PN at 21.34 and 25.32 disappeared and few peaks at 17.53, 24.92, and 30.11 shifted to 17.33, 25.18, and 30.61, respectively. These changes in the PXRD data of respective cocrystal from 5-FU and coformers are suggestive of the formation of new forms.
Crystal Structure Description
5-FU, a pyrimidine analogue, exists in a monoclinic unit cell with the P-1 space group. The crystal structure of 5-fluorouracil showed that one molecule is attached to three neighboring molecules to form dimmers and appear like ribbons which lie parallel to form rippled layers. A dimer is formed where the hydrogen that attached to the pyrimidine nitrogen (N 1 ) is interacting with the carbonyl oxygen of the pyrimidine ring (N 1 H···O 2 ) of another molecule (B). Beside this, the carbonyl oxygen (O 1 ) of molecules (A) is hydrogen bonded to pyrimidine nitrogen (N 2 ) of the third 5-FU molecule (C). Now, the hydrogen that attached to the pyrimidine nitrogen (N 2 ) of the molecule (A) is interacting with the fourth molecule (D) N 2 ···HO 1 .
The crystal structure analysis of the present work shows that drug–coformer heterosynthons are formed by replacing N–H···O interactions present in pure 5-FU (Fig. 4 ) ( , ). Fig. 4 The crystal structure of form I of 5-FU
The crystals of 5-FUGA were large and stiff, which were sufficient to be isolated and analyzed by SCXRD, and were found to exist in a triclinic unit cell having the P21/n space group (Fig. 5 a). The asymmetric unit contains one 5-FU and one GA molecule. One 5-FU molecule is interacting with three different GA molecules, involving the hydrogen bond between different functional groups. Fig. 5 a , b Asymmetric unit cell. c Hydrogen bonding between 5-fluorouracil and gentisic acid. d Packing arrangement of 5-FUGA cocrystal showing a diagonal antiparallel layer
The carbonyl oxygen (O 2 ) of the pyrimidine ring of 5-FU ( ) is attached to the phenolic hydrogen (O 2 ···HO 4 ) of one GA molecule, whereas the hydrogen of pyrimidine nitrogen (N 1 ) is interacting with the phenolic oxygen of another GA (N 1 H···O 4 ). Further, the second gentisic acid interacted with the carbonyl oxygen of the second 5-FU through O 4 H···O 2 , leading to the formation of the tetramer. Beside this, a dimer is also formed between one molecule of 5-FU and one molecule of GA through N 2 H···O 5 and O 6 H···O 1 . So, there are two parallel layers of dimers interconnecting with each other at N 1 H···O 4 along the b -axis.
The crystal structure of 5-FUBA cocrystal crystallizes in a triclinic crystal having the P-1 space group with one 5-FU molecule and one coformer molecule in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 6 a). Fig. 6 a , b Asymmetric unit cell of 5-FUBA cocrystal. c Hydrogen bonding between 5-fluorouracil and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid. d Packing arrangement of 5-FUBA cocrystal showing a diagonal antiparallel layer
The hydrogen of the pyrimidine nitrogen of 5-FU forms a hydrogen bond with the phenolic oxygen (N 2 H···O 5 ) of BA while the phenolic hydrogen is interacting through the intermolecular hydrogen bonding with the hydroxyl oxygen of the carboxylic group (O 5 H···O 4 ) of another BA molecule. Furthermore, the carbonyl oxygen (O 1 ) of 5-FU is interconnected with the second phenolic hydrogen (O 1 ···HO 6 ) of BA while the carbonyl oxygen (O 2 ) of 5-FU is coupled with the carboxylic hydrogen (O 2 ···HO 3 ) of BA by replacing the N 1 H···O 2 and N 2 H···O 1 intermolecular interactions within the pure 5-FU (Fig. 6 b). Thus, overall, the lattice seems to be diagonal parallel to each other along the b -axis.
Similarly (Fig. 7 a), in the cocrystal of 5-FUPN, one 5-FU molecule and PN molecules were present in the asymmetric unit which consists of the P-1 space group and the triclinic crystal system. Fig. 7 a , b Asymmetric unit cell of 5-FUPN cocrystal. c Hydrogen bonding between 5-fluorouracil and p -aminopyridine. d Packing arrangement of 5-FUPN cocrystal showing a diagonal antiparallel layer
The carbonyl oxygen (O 2 ) of 5-FU is associated with the hydrogen of amine hydrogen of p -aminopyridine (O 2 ···H-N 4 ), whereas the hydrogen of pyrimidine ring of 5-FU formed a hydrogen bond with the ring nitrogen (N 1 –H···N 3 ) of PN. Beside this, 5-FU molecules form a hydrogen bond between the carbonyl group and amine group (O 1 ···H-N 2 ) (Fig. 7 c).
Therefore, a linear chain arrangement of 5-FUPN cocrystal formed a three-dimensional structure consisting of 5-FU and PN that are packed along the b -axis that seems in alternating parallel layers and dimers present in the original 5-FU are intact in this structure. The crystallographic data and geometric parameters are represented in Tables I and II .

ssNMR Spectroscopy
Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is used to characterize the cocrystals by studying the chemical environment of their nuclei and hydrogen bonding, and it also offers valuable information regarding solid-state interactions. The 13 CssNMR spectra fulfill the first basic criteria of cocrystal formation that is the spectrum of cocrystal varies from the spectra of known phases of input materials.
In the ssNMR of 5-FUGA cocrystal, the carbonyl carbon (C1 and C2) of 5-FU corresponding to 150.67 ppm and 162.89 ppm has shifted to 152.65 ppm and 163.02 ppm, respectively. A deviation in the hydroxyl and carbonyl carbon of carboxylic group in GA shifted from 152.81 ppm and 172.79 ppm to 154.09 ppm and 175.31 ppm, respectively (Fig. 8 b). This suggests an interaction between the carboxylic and hydroxyl groups of GA with the carbonyl and amine groups of 5-FU. Fig. 8 ssNMR of a 5-FU, b 5-FUGA cocrystal, c 5-FUBA cocrystal, and d 5-FUPN cocrystal
In the same way in 5-FUBA, a variation showed the chemical shift value which corresponds to C1 and C2 of 5-FU from δ 150.67 ppm and 162.89 ppm to 152.23 ppm and 163.15 ppm, respectively. A small chemical shift is also observed in the hydroxyl as well as carbonyl carbon of the carboxylic group of coformer BA from 153.12 ppm and 172.23 ppm to 154.86 ppm and 174.36 ppm, respectively (Fig. 8 c). Therefore, the hydrogen bonding interaction occurred between the carboxylic group and the hydroxyl group of BA with the carboxamide group of 5-FU.
Similarly, in 5-FUPN cocrystal, the peak corresponding to C1 and C2 of 5-FU has shifted to 163.36 ppm and 151.84 ppm along with small changes in the chemical shift of carbon atoms joined to the primary amine (NH 2 ) and ring nitrogen of PN from 153.56 ppm and 156.12 ppm to 154.43 ppm and 157.58 ppm, respectively (Fig. 8 d). This showed that 5-FU is associated with PN through the carbonyl and amine groups.
Intrinsic Dissolution Studies
The IDR of 5-FU and its cocrystals was calculated in both phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) and 0.1 N HCl (pH 1.2) at 37°C for 3 h. An almost three- to fivefold increase in the IDR of 5-FU cocrystals was observed. The enhanced intrinsic dissolution rate suggests that 5-FU is being dissolved more rapidly in its cocrystals (Table III ). Table III Intrinsic Dissolution Rate of 5-FU and Its Cocrystal in Simulated Gastric and Intestinal Fluids Compounds Intrinsic dissolution rate (mg cm −2 min −1 ) ± SD In simulated gastric fluid (pH 1.2) In simulated intestinal fluid (pH 6.8) 5-FU 0.12 ± 0.1 0.18 ± 0.4 5-FUPN 0.36 ± 0.1 0.54 ± 0.1 5-FUBA 0.5 ± 0.1 0.74 ± 0.3 5-FUGA 0.7 ± 0.5 0.92 ± 0.1 The differences in intrinsic dissolution rates of cocrystals compared to the drug are greater; there is a statistically significant difference ( P = < 0.05)
Ex Vivo Skin Permeation and Dermatokinetic Study
Permeation enhancement by cocrystallization is based on the hypothesis that some of the intermolecular interaction between the drug and coformer of the cocrystals would be retained in the physiological solution in a receptor cell of Franz diffusion cell. Moreover, cocrystallization would cause a variation in the mechanism of interaction with the proteins of rat’s skin that are responsible for the drug transport or integrity of the cellular layers. Permeability studies were carried out on rat’s skin membrane using the Franz diffusion cell. The concentration of drug in each cocrystal was measured at 1-h intervals for 10 h. The cumulative amount ( Q n ) of pure drug 5-FU as well as its cocrystals permeated per unit area is plotted against time and is given in Fig. 9 a. “The cumulative amounts ( Q n ) of cocrystals increased with time, which was found to be 51%, 81%, and 92% higher than that of pure 5-flourouracil” ( , , ). “The flux ( J s ) of pure 5-FU increased slowly up to 2 h; after that, steady penetration rate was maintained. However, in the case of cocrystals, the flux ( J s ) increased rapidly up to 1 h and started to decrease till 2 h. After that, that steady penetration rate was maintained.” Both plots (Fig. 9 a, b) showed the permeability, as well as the flux of 5-FU in its cocrystals, following the order 5-FUGA > 5-FUBA > 5-FUPN > 5-FU. Fig. 9 a Cumulative amount per unit area permeated ( Q n ). b Flux of 5-FU and its cocrystals with respect to time. c Amount of drug deposited in epidermis. d Amount of drug deposited in dermis of 5-FU and respective cocrystal in 10 h. The differences in the flux and amount of drug deposition values of cocrystals compared to the drug are greater; there is a statistically significant difference ( P = < 0.04)
Dermatokinetics is regarded as a study where the drug concentration is determined in the skin continuously or intermittently for specific periods of time. In the present manuscript, this studies showed that the amount of 5-FU deposited in both epidermis and dermis has increased in cocrystal as compared to pure drug (Fig. 9 c, d). However, at the end of experiments, the amount of drug in dermis was found to be slightly higher than that in epidermis ( ). This may be due to the fact that the metabolic enzymes which are responsible for decreasing the drug concentration are not present in ex vivo experiments. Moreover, in the ex vivo studies, drug clearance into systemic circulation in the dermis is not taking place (Table IV ).

In Vitro Cell Viability
MTT assay on MCF-7, Hela, and Caco-2 cancer cell lines was done to test the in vitro cell viability as well as the pharmacological efficacy of 5-FU in its cocrystals. Untreated cell lines were used as a negative control while the pure drug solution–treated cell line as a positive control (Fig. 10 a–c). The in vitro cell viability response of drug and cocrystals was found to be concentration dependent, and no significant effect was observed for free drug 5-FU, as well as cocrystals (5-FUPN, 5-FUBA, and 5-FUGA) below the concentration of 0.1 μg mL −1 . When the dosage concentrations of 5-FU increased from 1 to 50 μg mL −1 , the cell viability in the MCF-7, Hela, and Caco-2 cell lines dropped dramatically after 24 h from 90.35 to 70.67%, from 92.98 to 74.05%, and from 89.77 to 76.37%, respectively. However, in case of cocrystals, the cell viability was found to be in the range from 79.35 to 22.06, from 86.68 to 31.22%, and from 88.62 to 21.65% in MCF-7, Hela, and Caco-2 cell lines, respectively. A significant decrease in cell viability (equivalent to an increase in cell inhibition) established the improvement in the efficacy of these cocrystals which followed the order 5-FUGA > 5-FUBA > 5-FUPN > 5-FU. The in vitro cell viability results indicated that the cocrystals are more effective than free drug. The minimum effective dose was found to be 1 μg mL −1 , which started to show an effect after 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h. It was found to be more cytotoxic. Thus, the drug cocrystallized with gentisic acid, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, and p -aminopyridine exhibits better performance on getting lower cell viability or equivalent high cell inhibition. Therefore, these solid forms play an important role in enhancing the cell inhibition effect. The differences in the percentage of cell viability values of cocrystals compared to the drug are greater; there is a statistically significant difference ( P = < 0.03).

The differences in the percentage of cell viability values of cocrystals compared to the drug are greater; there is a statistically significant difference ( P = < 0.03)
CONCLUSION
The present study demonstrates the effectiveness of 5-fluorouracil cocrystals towards improved permeability and antitumor efficacy. Cocrystals of 5-FU with GA, BA, and PN prepared via the solvent assistant grinding method were systematically characterized through DSC, SXRD, PXRD, FTIR, and ssNMR. The ex vivo permeability study through the rat skin shows enhanced flux/permeability of 5-FU in all cocrystals. The in vitro cell viability of these solid forms that were formed using different cancer cell lines (MCF-7, Hela, and Caco-2) indicates better anticancer efficacy than that of free drug. Thus, in case of cocrystals, the cell viability was found to be in the range from 79.35 to 22.06, from 86.68 to 31.22%, and 8from 8.62 to 21.65% in MCF-7, Hela, and Caco-2 cell lines, respectively. Thus, the reported cocrystals have important implications for the use of a cocrystallization approach to improve drug’s permeability and efficacy in the pharmaceutical field.
