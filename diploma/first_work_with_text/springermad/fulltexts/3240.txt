INTRODUCTION
Wound, specifically, chronic wounds that lasted for more than 6 months, is a major health problem, which affects the quality of life of many people. Quick wound healing with promising results became the goal of many clinical treatments. The full knowledge about wound-healing process resulted in the development of many therapies.
Insulin, a peptide hormone, with multiple physiological roles, was found to have an excellent wound-healing property, having the ability to restore the integrity of the broken skins and with a lower cost in comparison with other growth factors ( ). It can stimulate keratinocyte migration and proliferation, and this effect was observed to be independent of epidermal growth factor (EGF), resulting in an epidermis with more mature morphology. It was able to accelerate wound healing by stimulating angiogenesis process and inducing a regenerative process of healing ( ).
It is well known that polypeptides are complex molecules with different molecular weights ranging from 5 to 200 kDa, whose delivery has been accomplished through an invasive method as injections ( ). However; these routes do not protect the protein from degradation due to proteases at the wound site and do not maintain the therapeutic levels, so they require frequent dosing. Moreover, a sustained release is required so as to lower the frequency of application, hence improving the patient compliance. Thus, continuous improvements in the formulation as well as the delivery are developed so as to formulate insulin for wound healing with increased stability and an extended release. It was found that liposomal vesicles can release peptides in a controllable manner and can protect it from the surrounding environment as peptidases ( ). In addition; the use of bio-adhesive hydrogels offers additional advantages such as prolonging the residence times on the application site and reducing the frequency of product administration. Chitosan is one of the hydrogels that by its bio-adhesive property seals leaks stops bleeding, binds tissues, and preferably facilitates the healing process ( ). Thus, formulation of insulin-loaded vesicles in an optimized bio-adhesive hydrogel could offer a controlled delivery into the wound area with promising results ( ).
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) initiated the quality by design (QbD) approach; which is a strategic product development approach that puts into consideration both, product and procedure factors that affect the final quality product ( ). A thorough knowledge about the process and the product is required by the pharmaceutical QbD. Moreover, the understanding of how the critical process parameters (CPP) affects the critical quality attributes (CQAs) is very important by the use of design of experiments (DoE) where, an operational design space (DS) could be established. Thus, a controlled DS could be generated for the process. The proper use of QbD will help to increase the robustness and quality of the product ( ). The QbD could be summarized into four major stages: (1) creating quality target product profiles (QTPP) and CQAs, (2) risk assessment (RA), (3) design of experiments and design space establishment, and (4) control strategy with continuous improvement ( ).
The present work is a case study for developing insulin liposomal chitosan gel using step-by-step QbD approach. The effects of total lipid content, phosphatidylcholine are as follows: cholesterol molar ratio and the insulin amount on the particle size, zeta potential, drug encapsulation efficiency, and the release rate were explored. A design space had been established, where, stability and clinical studies were fully studied to create a control strategy ensuring the continuation of the process with promising results for the clinical performance of the product.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
Insulin crystals were obtained as a generous gift from Sedico Company (Cairo, Egypt), L(α) phosphatidylcholine (type IV-s), and medium molecular weight chitosan were from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA), Cholesterol was from Bio Basic (Toronto, Canada). All other chemicals and solvents were of pharmaceutical grade, from ADWIC Company (Qalyubia, Egypt).
Preparation of Insulin-Loaded Liposomes
Dry thin film hydration was the method of choice used for the preparation of liposomes ( ). Lipid contents (egg phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol) were added to 7.5 ml solvent mixture of chloroform and methanol, where this organic solvent was then evaporated under vacuum at the specified temperature, using rotatory evaporator (Heidolph 2, Schwabach, Germany). A dry lipid film was formed, which was collected by hydration with an insulin solution in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) (pH 6.8) by rotation for the specified time. Sonication (bath-type) was applied to the formed dispersion (Jiotech UC-10, Serangoon, Singapore) at 900 H. The preparation was left overnight for maturation.
Liposomes without insulin were prepared exactly as mentioned, but without the addition of insulin, and were additionally analyzed to act as the negative control.
Establishing Quality Paradigm
Risk Assessment (RA)
The Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP) is the properties related to the quality which a drug product needs to have to be able to achieve the requirements set in the target product profile. QTPP should achieve a quantitative substitute to describe the efficacy and clinical safety by determining the critical quality attributes (CQAs), critical process parameters (CPP), and control strategy ( ). In the case of insulin loaded-liposomes, insulin with a sustained release and high stability were the main quality product profile. The risk assessment study started by listing all the factors that can affect the quality of the final product ( ). The most important step in risk assessment is to sort the main factors influencing the QTPP. These factors were categorized diagrammatically using a fish-bone diagram (also known as the Ishikawa diagram or cause-and-effect diagram), which was useful in determining the main risks and accompanying causes ( ). One main response, namely drug encapsulation efficiency (EE%), was defined and further delineated to identify all potential risks.
Screening Phase: Fractional Factorial Design
After risk analysis, the factors affecting the insulin entrapment efficiency were identified and found to be organic solvent volumetric ratio (chloroform: methanol) (X 1 ), hydration time (X 2 ), sonication time (X 3 ), and temperature of liposomes and film formation (X 4 ).
The first step in the screening phase was to choose a suitable experimental design, taking into consideration the number of factors to be tested and the availability of time and resources. The studied factors were studied at two different levels, low and high, as shown in Table I , which were all tested on the EE%.

Optimization Phase: Box–Behnken Design (BBD)
Based on preliminary experimental data, three critical process parameters (CPP) were selected for the Box–Behnken Design using response surface methodology (RSM) to allow the investigation of the studied CPP, namely total lipid content (X A ), phosphatidylcholine: cholesterol ratio (PC:CH) (X B ), and the insulin amount (X C ), at three different levels as shown in Table II , producing 17 runs. The impact of the CPPs was tested on the CQA, the particle size (Y 1 ), zeta potential (Y 2 ), EE% (Y 3 ), and the release rate (Y 4 ). The factors that showed a statistically significant effect, which were evaluated in the screening design, were set fixed at the level that achieves the highest EE% in Box–Behnken design.

Characterization of the Prepared Insulin-Loaded Liposomes
Morphology of the Prepared Liposomes
Scanning electron microscope (JSM-5600LV, JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and binocular light optical microscope (Leica Imaging Systems, Cambridge, UK) were used to test the morphology of the vesicles. Samples for scanning electron microscope were coated with platinum before analysis. The images were obtained with a scintillating secondary electron detector with an accelerating potential of 15 keV ( ).
Determination of Encapsulation Efficiency (EE%)
For EE% determination, 1 mL of the liposomal dispersion was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for the separation of the unentrapped insulin from the entrapped one, at a temperature 4°C for 1 h in a cool centrifuge (Megafuge 16R, Hanau, Germany). The formed precipitate was washed with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) twice. The test was conducted in triplicates at least. The supernatant was assayed spectrophotometrically for the free insulin ( C f ) ( λ max = 204 nm) ( ). The percentage of entrapped insulin was calculated as follows $$ \mathrm{EE}\%=\left[\left({C}_{\mathrm{t}}-{C}_f\right)/{C}_{\mathrm{t}}\right]\ 100 $$ (1)
Where C t is the initial insulin concentration, and C f is the concentration of unentrapped insulin in the supernatant.
Particle Size and Zeta Potential Analysis
Particle size and zeta potential measurements were done using a Zetasizer (Nano-ZS90, Malvern, Worcestershire, UK), after dilution 10 times with double distilled water, at 25°C, which were all measured in triplicate and all particle size data were expressed as “mean ± SD width.”
Preparation of Insulin-Loaded Liposomal Chitosan Gel
Insulin-loaded liposomal chitosan gel was formulated using a magnetic stirrer (PM010 JOAN Laboratory Hotplate Magnetic Stirrer Manufacturer, Zhejiang, China) by constantly stirring 4% w / v chitosan into 1% glacial acetic acid solution. Sonication was applied twice to remove air bubbles ( ). The insulin-loaded liposomal gel was prepared by triturating the insulin-loaded liposomal dispersion with the prepared gel to form 2% gel preparation. Free insulin chitosan gel was prepared exactly the same, but instead of incorporation of insulin-loaded liposomes, free insulin solution in PBS was incorporated.
In vitro Release Study
Vertical type Franz diffusion cells (Hanson research, Los Angeles, California, USA) was used for the in vitro release studies with 1 cm 2 diffusion area. Insulin-loaded liposomal gel or free insulin gel was placed in the donor compartment so as to make a comparison between the release of insulin from the free gel and the insulin-loaded liposomal gel. The receptor compartment was filled with 7 mL PBS at pH 6.8, maintained at 37°C ± 0.5 and adjusted at 500 rpm. The gel was separated from the receptor compartment using cellophane membrane (Spectrum Medical Inc., Los Angeles, CA, USA cutoff 12,000–14,000) which was previously soaked in PBS overnight.
Samples were withdrawn (400 μL) at (0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, and 24 h), time intervals and were replaced with fresh solvent. Each formula was conducted in triplicate.
The rate of the drug release was estimated by calculating the cumulative amount of insulin released per unit area (μg/cm 2 ) and plotting it against time (h) for each formula, where the slope of the linear part of the graph was used to calculate the release rate ( ) .
Viscosity Measurement of the Optimized Insulin-Loaded Liposomal Chitosan Gel
Viscosity of the gel was measured using Brookfield viscometer at 25 ± 1°C, attached with spindle No CP42 at 10 rpm ( ).
Data Analysis
Design-Expert 10.0.1.0® software (Stat-Ease Inc., Minneapolis, USA) was used to generate and analyze fractional factorial design, Box–Behnken design, and was used for the statistical analysis. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and regression equations were used to analyze responses. Statistically, the best fitting experimental model being taken on the basis of comparison of coefficient of variation (CV), multiple correlation coefficient (R 2 ), adjusted multiple correlation coefficient (adjusted R 2 ), predicted residual sum of square, and graphically by 3D response surface plot provided by the program. A level of significance of p value < 0.05 was considered. The linear regression plots (observed versus predicted value) and normal probability curves of CQAs were plotted.
Data Optimization and Model Validation
A design space was established by analyzing the effect of each CPP on CQA, to ensure the desired quality of the product. To achieve the target, the optimization was aiming to attain the largest particle size and zeta potential, highest EE%, with the slowest release rate. Several criteria were used in the optimization of the BBD, such as overlay plot and desirability. Furthermore, the two optimized formulae with the greatest desirability, O 1 and O 2 ; were taken as checkpoints so as to assure the reliability of the model, by calculating the percentage bias between the expected and the observed results.
Development of Design Space of Insulin-Loaded Liposomes with Optimum Quality
The correlation between the CPP and CQAs were described in the design space. The region where the CPP could be used to obtain the required CQAs was determined, and thus establishment of the design space. It is expected that working within the design space will produce a product with the highest desired CQAs.
Determination of Control Strategy of the Optimized Insulin-Loaded Liposomes
International conference on harmonization, Q10, defines the control strategy as “a planned set of controls derived from current product and process understanding that guarantees process performance and product quality. The controls can include parameters and attributes related to drug substance and drug product materials and components, facility and equipment operating conditions, in process controls, finished product specifications and the associated methods and frequency of monitoring and control.” ( ). Design space determined the acceptable range of the material attributes.
Stability Studies
Insulin liposomal dispersion was tested for the stability, where, one representative formula (O 1 ) with highest desirability was selected with 200 mg total lipid content, 2.5:1 M ratio between PC:CH and drug amount of 20 I.U. These samples were kept at 25°C and 4°C. At predetermined time intervals, the particle size and the amount of protein remaining, by EE% measurement, were determined (as mentioned earlier) and taken as indicators for stability.
Clinical Study
The current study was conducted on 15 patients, at Ahmed Maher Hospital (Department of Dermatology, Burns and Plastic Surgery), through a period of 8 months, from October 2016 to April 2017. A full medical history was performed on all patients, emphasizing on the cause and the duration of wound, any complications with the wound, and previous or present medication that may have an effect on the healing process in addition to the current medical conditions ( e.g. ,atherosclerosis, history of abnormal scar formation, diabetes mellitus, or history of any chronic conditions that may might have an effect on the study). The study protocol was explained to the patients before obtaining the informed consent and after approval from the ethical committees of MSA University and Cairo University. All procedures followed were in accordance with the ethical standards of Helsinki Declaration. After eligibility confirmation, patients were randomly divided into two groups (test group, 10 patients) receiving insulin-loaded liposomal chitosan gel or (control group, 5 patients) receiving liposomal chitosan gel (exactly the same as the insulin-loaded liposomal chitosan gel but without adding insulin). The package of the final working gels were each assigned a product code to ensure blindness of the study.
Inclusion Criteria
Patients with chronic wounds in different parts of the body, age between 21 to 75 years, are included in the study.
Exclusion Criteria
Patients excluded from the study are those who have severe infection (as determined by the presence of visible pus, wound exudate, redness, or warmth of the wound border), uncontrolled wound bleeding, smokers, patients with immunosuppression, cardiovascular diseases, or any chronic debilitating disease that might affect the outcome of the study.
Study Protocol
Complete general and dermatological examinations were performed, and evaluation of the wound emphasizing on the shape and wound area was conducted. Photographs of the wounds were taken at the beginning of the study and were set as the primary wound surface and shape, using digital camera. Progressive photographs were taken, where camera settings, lighting, and patient positioning were set constant at the beginning of the study, every 2 weeks for 2 months maximum, or when complete wound closure was achieved as evidenced by moist granulation tissue was no longer visible and wound area was covered by continuous layer of epithelium ( ).
The topical gel was applied once daily in both test and control groups, left to dry for 30 min, and covered with sterile cotton gauze.
Erythema Measurement
Directly after absorption of the formulae from the skin, the application sites were graded according to visual scaling. The erythema scale was as follows: 0, none; 1, slight; 2, well defined; 3, moderate; and 4, scar formation, on days 0, 1, 2, 7, and 14 ( ).
Wound Area Measurement
The wound area was measured by an expert physician using a sterile transparent paper; which was placed on the wound to mark wound borders. The largest two perpendicular diameters were multiplied to obtain the wound area in mm 2 . The rate of wound healing was depicted from the following equation $$ \left({W}_{\mathrm{i}}\hbox{--} {W}_{\mathrm{f}}\ \right)/\mathrm{time}\ \left(\mathrm{days}\right) $$ (2)
Where; W i is the primary wound area and W f is the final wound area in mm 2 .
Safety Measurement
Blood glucose level was measured before application and 1 h after application of the gel in both groups. Adverse events, including headache, sweating, and vertigo (due to hypoglycemia) were reported and recorded ( ).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Risk Assessment
Risk assessment could be performed by risk identification and risk analysis, which are two basic components of a risk assessment study as outlined in the ICH Q9 document. The first step is to devise and enlist the whole information that can harm the whole process and plays a role in the quality of the final product, through risk identification; whereas, risk analysis focuses on the linking between the qualitative or quantitative occurrence and severity of harm ( ).
The first step applied was the construction of the Ishikawa diagram as presented in Fig. 1 to identify the possible causes of product variability ( ). Fig. 1 Ishikawa diagram for the encapsulation efficiency of insulin-loaded liposomes
Drug encapsulation efficiency was found to be the highest risk factor, which is very important for both manufacturers and patients, because when it increases, reduction in the manufacturing cost could be achieved ( ); furthermore, a sustained release of insulin from liposomal vesicles would be accomplished with an increase in the insulin’s stability (being protected from the outer environment). Moreover, it facilitates the transport of high molecular weight protein to the skin layers ( ). Accordingly, as the goal of this study was to maximize the insulin entrapment within the liposomes, thus the formulations with entrapment efficiencies of less than 5% were excluded from further analysis.
Experimental Design
Screening: 24–1 Fractional Factorial Design
As shown in Table I , insulin-loaded liposomes encapsulation in the screening study varied from 17.02 to 78.41% for various prepared formulae for the screening study. The generated statistical model showed a very good correlation coefficient with a value of ( R 2 ) = 0.9934. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for further analysis which indicated a significant effect of the studied factors on the encapsulation efficiency ( p < 0.05). The linear regression equation representing the EE% for screening is outlined in Eq. ( ). $$ \%\mathrm{EE}=+43.78-6.31\ {X}_1+4.70\ {X}_2-16.04\ {X}_3 $$ (3)
Out of the four investigated factors, three were statistically significant, namely solvent volumetric ratio (X 1 ), hydration time (X 2 ), and sonication time (X 3 ) while the effect of the temperature of liposomes and film formation (X 4 ) was insignificant.
As can be observed from Eq. (3), the EE% increased as the solvent volumetric ratio decreased, with a longer hydration time and without sonication, which probably could be due to the leakage of the free insulin due to sonication ( ). The temperature was found to have an insignificant effect on the EE%, as the two chosen temperatures (45 and 65°C) were above the (Tc) of the liposomes, which is around 40°C ( ).
The significant factors in the screening step were adjusted so as to obtain the highest EE% in the further optimization study.
Optimization of Insulin Liposomes: Box–Behnken Design
Seventeen experimental runs were conducted. Probability values ( p value) by regression analysis test values were evaluated for the four critical quality attributes that have a 95% confident level. A large p value for lack of fit (> 0.05) gives an indication that the lack of fit test is insignificant suggesting that the correlation between the CPP and the CQA is significant.
Particle Size
The particle size range was found to be between 701.7 and 184 nm as observed from Table II .
All CQAs and their combined actions had a significant effect on the particle size except PC:CH ratio (X B ) and its interaction between any of the total lipid content (X AB ) or the drug amount (X BC ) as represented in Table III .

The equation that represents the linear regression model for insulin-loaded liposomes of particle size, as obtained from factorial study (Table III ), shows that an increase in the liposomal particle size was observed as the total lipid content increases, which may be due to the positive impact of the lipid concentration on the internal volume of the individual vesicles, which in turn may lead to the increase in their size ( ). These results were in accordance with Soema et al . who showed that when egg phosphatidylcholine was present in high amounts, a larger vesicular size was observed. ( ). Moreover, the vesicular size was observed to be smaller as the drug amount increases, as confirmed from the negative coefficient of (X C ). This could be attributed to that some of the insulin is located in the bilayers of the vesicles being amphipathic in nature ( ), which leads to incorporation of the drug to the bilayers of liposomes resulting in an increase in the cohesion among the apolar portions of the membrane, thus the vesicle diameter may be reduced ( ). The positive coefficient of (X AB ) reveals that the vesicular size of liposomes was found to increase as the total lipid amount together with the drug amount increases.
Zeta (ζ) Potential Measurement of Prepared Liposomes
Zeta ( ζ ) potential was found to have a negative charge at pH 6.8 as the main used component is egg phosphatidylcholine (PC) ( ), which gives an indication to the presence of a weak electrostatic repulsive force between the phosphatidylcholine vesicles at pH 6.8. In addition, insulin at pH 6.8 imparts a negative charge ( ). The range of the ζ potential values was − 18.8 to − 22.9 mv, which is considered a good value.
The linear regression models for insulin loaded liposomes of ζ potential, as obtained from factorial study, was represented in Table III , which shows that zeta potential absolute value increased as the total lipid content decreased. Moreover, the zeta potential was augmented as the PC:CH molar ratio was decreased. This may be attributed to the decrease in the relative amount of phosphatidylcholine, which leads to an increase in the zeta potential ( ), and the subsequent increase in the cholesterol amount may increase the zeta potential, as the hydroxyl group that is present in the polar head of the cholesterol combine easily with the choline present in in the polar region of phosphatidylcholine. This will lead to production of a kind of dipole tropism that increases the liposomal surface’s negative charges ( ). Furthermore, the presence of the cholesterol at the bilayers might reduce the binding affinity at the surface between the cations in the buffer solution and its bilayer surface, which in turn leads to an elevated value of the negative zeta potential ( ).
Encapsulation Efficiency
Encapsulation efficiency for optimization was found to be in the range of 14.15 to 96.16%. It can be deduced from Table III that the CQAs and their combined actions were significant model terms, where EE% was found to increase as any of the main factors increased as observed from their positive coefficients.
The linear regression model for insulin-loaded liposomes of EE%, as obtained from factorial study (Table III ), showed that the increase in the vesicular entrapment efficiency was detected when the total lipid content was increased, which may be due to that the presence of high amount of lipid within liposomes could create more space to encapsulate more insulin within the liposomes ( ). Moreover, it is known that lipid concentration positively affects the liposomal encapsulation efficiency of most hydrophilic drugs (small or large molecules), thus the insulin encapsulation may be increased by the increase in the total lipid content, owing to its effect on the total internal volume of liposomes, which is determined by the entrapment volume of individual vesicles and the total vesicle number ( ).
An increase in the encapsulation efficiency was also observed as the PC:CH molar ratio increased. This may be attributed to two reasons: first, the increase in the PC content would lead to an increase in the liposomal formation and hence the EE% would increase as well ( ). Second, the decrease in the cholesterol amount, as the competition between cholesterol and insulin for the packing space within the bilayer will be lowered and thus reducing the exclusion of the drug from the vesicles. However, reduction of cholesterol above a certain limit can disrupt the regular linear structure of the liposomal vesicles, thus it should be adjusted within a certain range ( ).
On increasing the amount of insulin added, an increase in the insulin entrapment efficiency was observed too, which can be observed from the positive coefficients of (X C ). This could be due to the saturation of the medium with insulin at higher concentration enforcing it to be encapsulated into liposomal vesicles ( ).
The interaction between any of the studied CPP had different behavior than their individual effects; where an increase in both the total lipid content with the PC:CH molar ratio (X AB ) or the total lipid content with the drug amount (X AC ) resulted in a decrease in the entrapment efficiency, while the increase in the PC:CH together with the amount of insulin resulted in a significant increase in the EE%.
In vitro Release Rate
As can be observed from Fig. 2 , a biphasic release profile was observed for the in vitro release of insulin. Probably, this may be attributed to the presence of the unencapsulated and encapsulated insulin, as the lipid has a small capacity to encapsulate large amounts of the drug, resulting in the deposition of the free insulin at the surface ( ). The biphasic release was observed due to the presence of free protein which will be released rapidly then the entrapped insulin will be released slower and more sustained due to its diffusion through the lipid bilayers of the vesicles, thus encapsulating insulin in liposomes had a very good impact in controlling and sustaining the release of insulin ( ) . Fig. 2 In vitro release profiles of Insulin from insulin-loaded liposomes
The release rate was found to be from 36.96 to 218.44 μg/cm 2 /h as shown in Table II and was significantly affected by all factors and their interaction except the drug amount and its combined action with the total lipid content (Table III ).
It was found that the increase in the total lipid content may accelerate the release rate as can be deduced from the positive coefficient of (X A ). Furthermore, by increasing the molar ratio between the PC and cholesterol, i.e. , decreasing the cholesterol amount relatively, the release rate was increased. This could be attributed to the effect of cholesterol when incorporated into the bilayer, which might cause the lipid vesicles to change their packing geometrical structures as surface lipid bilayer rigidity. In addition, the Hamaker constant, van der Waals forces, electrostatic repulsive forces, and hydration forces between the lipid bilayers or lipid vesicles may all be affected following the incorporation of cholesterol into the lipid vesicles. Thus reduction in the cholesterol amount leads to a decrease in the rigidity of the vesicles thus accelerating the drug release ( ).
Acceleration of the release of insulin from the liposomal vesicles was observed as a result of increase in both the total lipid content and the PC:CH, which may be due to the positive impact of each individual CPP on the release rate. Additionally, an increase in the phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol molar ratio together with the drug content, accelerated the release rate as confirmed by the positive coefficient of (X BC ).
Viscosity Measurement of the Optimized Insulin-Loaded Liposomal Chitosan Gel
Viscosity of the optimized insulin-loaded liposomal chitosan gel was found to be 11,404.390 ± 105.89 cp due to the presence of the insulin in the liposomes, and their incorporation into chitosan gel is considered to be very beneficial for sustaining the release of insulin ( , ).
Three-D Plots
Three-D plots of the studied CQAs were represented in Fig. 3 . Analysis of 3-D plots reveals that the P.S. was decreased as the total lipid content was reduced, and the insulin amount was increased, keeping the PC:CH fixed at the two used levels till a certain point after which a remarkable increase in the particle size was observed. Moreover, decreasing the total lipid amount and PC:CH molar ratio resulted in remarkable higher zeta potential, which may be due to their individual effects. Furthermore, increasing the total lipid amount and decreasing the drug amount while fixing the (X B ), a remarkable higher EE% was observed. While the relationship between total lipid amount and PC:CH molar ratio with the release rate was not linear, their increase lead to an initial increase in the release rate followed by a slowdown.

Morphology of the Prepared Liposomes
Photomicrograph of the selected formulae were represented in Fig. 4 . As can be observed, the structure of a well-identified sealed spherical vesicles, which were nearly homogenous in shape, were predominantly present with the multilamellar walls. In addition; the method of preparation was validated by the absence of fragments in the field ( ).

Statistical Design and Analysis
The results of the response surface design (RSD) were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA), the effect of each CPP was discussed separately, the type of each model was analyzed, and the R 2 values of each CQA were outlined in Table ( III ).
Statistical tests were performed to predict when a significant change occurred in the stability and the clinical tests, using GraphPad Prism®, version 5.01. (California Corporation, USA).
The “Pred R-Squared” was in reasonable agreement with the “Adj R-Squared”, i.e. , the difference was less than 0.2. Moreover; this model could be used to navigate the design space as the adequate precision was greater than 4, indicating an adequate signal.
Data Optimization and Model Validation
Superimposing of the CQAs on a contour plot was done so as to obtain the graphical optimization. This resulted in an overlay plot as illustrated in Fig. 5 having two regions: a yellow region with accessible response values within the design space and the gray region with response values not fitting the quality product criteria. Accordingly, based on desirability criteria and overlay plot, two optimized batches (O 1 and O 2 ) were selected.

Determination of Control Strategy of the Prepared Insulin-Loaded Liposomes
The upper and the lower limits for the CQA and the CPP can be defined as “the control space (or normal operating ranges) where these parameters are routinely controlled during production in order to assure reproducibility” ( ). The control space should be within the design space. If the control space is much smaller than the design space, the process is then considered robust. Insulin-loaded liposomes satisfying these criteria were prepared and evaluated by the previously mentioned tests. The compositions of the prepared formulae were reported in Table IV , along with the observed and predicted responses. Each had three CPP, the first optimized batch (O 1 ) was 200 mg total lipid content, 2.5:1 M ratio between PC:CH, and drug amount of 20 I.U, with desirability 0.465; while the other (O 2 ) was with total lipid content of 200 mg, 2.75:1 M ratio between PC:CH, and drug amount 20 I.U, with desirability 0.463. The predicted value for particle size, zeta potential, EE%, and the release rate were respectively 257.751 nm, − 20.548 mv, 87.379%, and 91.521 μg/cm 2 /h for O 1 and 257.829 nm, − 20.483 mv, 91.792%, and 103.307 μg/cm 2 /h for O 2 in overlay plot, while the results for observed values were shown in Table IV .

The experimental observation was in reasonable agreement with the model prediction; thus, the validity of the model was established.
The release rate was comparatively evaluated for the free insulin gel and the optimized insulin-loaded liposomal gel as represented in Fig. 6 , where it shows the liposomal formulation ability to sustain the release of insulin up to 24, whereas a release for 6 h only was observed with the free insulin gel.

Stability Study of Insulin-Loaded Liposomes
The stability study was performed on O 1 , having higher desirability.
As shown in Fig. 7a , at 25°C, after 14 days, the particle size was increased from 219.45 to 365.7 nm followed by a dramatic significant increase in the size after 2 months to reach to 548 nm, which may be due to the flocculation of the colloidal dispersion, reflecting a poor stability of the liposomal dispersion under this temperature, owing to the increase in the thermodynamic motion of liposomes at this temperature which promotes aggregation ( ). Moreover, a change in the internal arrangement of molecules inside the liposomal vesicles at high temperature may occur as self-association or aggregate formation of insulin in the liposomal membrane ( ). Fig. 7 a Liposome storage stability at 25°C. (I) Particle size and distribution width (shown as error bar and (II) remaining encapsulated protein% (mean ± SD). b Liposome storage stability at 4°C. (I) Particle size and distribution width (shown as error bar) and (II) remaining encapsulated protein% (mean ± SD)
The results show that after 14 days, the remaining amount of the protein reached 71.71% for O 1 , while after 1 month, a significant amount of insulin leaked out from the liposomes (61.66%), ensuring the instability of the liposomal dispersion at 25°C. The instability of liposomes in terms of the insulin leakage could be due to the high lipid molecular mobility at such temperature, which results in an increased lipid bilayer permeability leading to a higher protein partitioning and faster diffusion, hence, rapid protein leakage ( ). Furthermore, high collision and coalescence rates of liposomal vesicles might take place, leading to particle aggregation and lipid fusion resulting in more insulin leakage. Moreover, the probability of leakage of insulin from the liposome internal aqueous compartment is less due slow diffusion, unless the integrity of the liposome bilayer is lost under stress ( ).
At 4°C as represented by Fig. 7b , the particle size was found to show no significant increase in the vesicular size after 6 months (from 257.75 to 281.54 nm), which may be due to triggering the hydrolysis of the ester bonds linking the fatty acids to the glycerol in the backbone of the lipids when refrigerated ( ). Also, the refrigerated conditions avoid hydrolysis and oxidation of the phospholipids ( ). It can be observed that no significant protein leakage till 4 months for O 1 (remaining insulin encapsulated reached 86.62% after 4 months storage period) . The more intense thermodynamic motion was, the easier the encapsulated protein to leak, thus liposomes supposed to be stored at 4°C ( ).
Clinical Study
Results from the patients in the study were tabulated and expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD), were explored using Kolmogorov–Smirnov test of normality, and were found to have parametric distribution.
Erythema Measurement
A significant change occurred at day 14 for the control group ( p value < 0.05), which may be due to the anti-inflammatory effect of the chitosan. Chitosan is believed to have role in the enhancement of the inflammatory cells functions such as macrophages, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and fibroblasts, which promotes granulation and organization ( ). The test formulation showed a statistical improvement in the erythema at day 7, which may be due to the effect of the insulin as an anti-inflammatory agent due to its vasodilatory effect, where it releases endothelial nitrogen oxide (NO) in arteries, veins, and capillaries. This vasodilatation reduces leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium and subsequent infiltration. Moreover, it inhibits platelet adhesion and aggregation. Furthermore; insulin suppresses three important inflammatory mediators: intercellular cell adhesion molecular-1 (ICAM-1), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) expression, and nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) binding in human aortic endothelial cells in vitro . These effects could be blocked by nitrogen oxide inhibitor N(G)-nitro-L-arginine, indicating the effects are mediated by nitrogen oxide release. Tumor necrosis factor alpha pro-inflammatory cytokines is considered the most active one in triggering the production of other cytokines such as interleukine-6 (IL-6) and other expression molecules ( ).
By comparing the control group with the test group, no significant difference among the groups was observed ( p value = 0.1172), the only observed change is that insulin accelerated the erythema disappearance only.
Rate of Wound Healing
It could be observed from Fig. 8 that the control group produced a moderate significant change after 8 weeks with a healing rate of 2.27 ± 1.034 mm 2 /day, while the test group showed a healing rate of 36.67 ± 12.179 mm 2 /day with a significant change in the wound area at the 4th week. A highly significant difference was observed between the control and the test group. It can be observed that the rate of wound healing of the test was about 16 times (highly significant) the control. It should be noted that a highly significant increase between the control and the test group was observed. The control group showed a good healing process due to the presence of chitosan, while the test group showed a dramatic improvement, which may be due to the anabolic action of insulin as a growth factor in healing events, where, insulin acts on growth hormone receptors and increases reepithelialization as well as collagen content, granulation tissue, wound tensile strength, and local production of insulin-like growth factors by fibroblasts ( ). Insulin also stimulates proliferation and migration of human keratinocytes, which stimulates cell growth and enhances wound healing ( ).

Safety Evaluation
No significant adverse drug events or reactions were observed, and none of the participants experienced adverse systemic effects such as hypoglycemia, vertigo, sweating, and headache related to insulin administration. Blood glucose levels did not differ between treatment groups or following application of the treatment. No wound infection or uncontrolled wound bleeding occurred during the treatment period, and none of the subjects had local pain, thus ensuring the safety of the prepared formulation.
CONCLUSION
The present study describes how the QbD approach was adopted for the development of liposomal insulin with enhanced stability and sustained release to be used in wound healing. The effects of CPP on CQA were assessed using Box–Behnken design for achieving the desired QTPP.
Insulin found a solution to its instability and uncontrollable release, by formulating it into a liposomal chitosan gel. The liposomal dispersion remained stable for at least 6 months in aqueous dispersion state at 4°C, and the protective ability of liposomes on insulin was proven. The formulation was applied once daily, which improves patient’s compliance, especially with the painful wounds. Moreover. the clinical study showed outstanding results, reducing the erythema and the duration to wound healing, with an increase in the wound healing rate to about 16 times as the control formula. The insulin-loaded liposomal chitosan gel offered a very good solution to the problems of insulin, by the use of the successful quality by design concepts to achieve the best quality attribute with a strategy to continuous improvement.
