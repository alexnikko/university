Introduction
The safety of the commonly used vasodilators, regadenoson and adenosine, during routine stress testing has recently been brought into question by United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) package label changes. Several case reports in the literature of myocardial infarction (MI) during regadenoson stress, , along with reports to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) resulted in additions to the drug labels of both adenosine and regadenoson in October of 2013 over concerns of increased risk of MI and death. Additional changes to the drug labels to include atrial fibrillation and flutter, seizure, and cerebrovascular accident occurred in September 2014. With millions of stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) studies being performed annually in the US, these agents are used regularly in millions of patients.
Since its approval by the FDA in April of 2008, regadenoson has become the most commonly used vasodilator agent for pharmacologic stress MPI. Stress testing performed in the non-acute setting has been found to be very safe with adverse event rates of 0.01-0.05%. , While adenosine, and even dipyridamole, as a MPI stress agent has literature supporting its safety and efficacy in the setting of MI, , regadenoson does not. Studying a higher risk cohort with elevated cardiac biomarkers may shed light on potential safety issues of these agents which might also affect lower risk cohorts. Accordingly, the aim of the present study was to investigate the safety of performing vasodilator stress MPI in the setting of elevated cardiac biomarkers. We chose to study this population because (1) such patients are at higher risk and have a higher incidence of adverse events which is helpful given the rarity of adverse outcomes among patients undergoing stress testing, and (2) the role of stress MPI in evaluating and risk stratifying patients with elevated cardiac biomarkers is only expected to increase with the advent of widespread use of high-sensitivity troponin assays.
Methods
Study Design
This was a retrospective multicenter cohort study using prospectively collected stress MPI data and retrospectively collected outcomes data. Included in the analysis were all patients who had undergone a clinically indicated exercise or pharmacologic stress single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET) MPI study at Hartford Hospital (a 900 bed urban teaching hospital) or Mount Sinai Hospital (a 1200 bed inner city teaching hospital) between 1/1/2010 and 12/31/2012 with positive cardiac troponin (>the upper limit of normal) ≤7 days prior to the MPI study. The reason for obtaining cardiac biomarkers was clinically driven, and patients were not excluded based on the indication for the testing. Patients with incomplete data were excluded. This study was approved by and conducted within guidelines of the Institutional Review Board at Hartford Hospital and Mount Sinai Hospital.
Troponin results were obtained from electronic medical records. At Hartford Hospital, a positive test was defined as a troponin-I level >0.3 ng/ml or a troponin-T level >0.03 ng/ml, while at Mount Sinai Hospital, it was defined as a >0.5 ng/ml and was lowered to >0.4 ng/ml in 2011. At Hartford Hospital, the assay changed from troponin-T to troponin-I in July 2010. At the time of stress MPI, pertinent demographic and clinical information, past cardiac history, and coronary artery disease (CAD) risk factors were recorded based on patient report or available medical records. A family history of premature CAD was defined as a diagnosis of CAD in a first degree relative prior to or at 55 years of age. Smoking history was defined as past or present smoking. History of MI was based on patient report or available medical records and did not include the index infarction for which the subject was included in this study. For each patient, a Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) score, used clinically to determine the likelihood of ischemic events or mortality in patients with unstable angina or non-ST segment elevation MI, was calculated. As such, each of the following criteria constitutes one point for TIMI scoring: age ≥65 years; 3 or more risk factors for CAD (family history of CAD, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use); known CAD (stenosis >50%); aspirin use in the past 7 days; severe angina (≥2 episodes in 24 h); ST-segment deviation ≥0.5 mm; and elevated cardiac biomarker.
Stress and Imaging Protocols
Standard exercise and pharmacologic protocols as endorsed by the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology were employed. Pharmacologic agents used during this time period were adenosine, dipyridamole, regadenoson, and dobutamine. Pharmacologic stress was generally reserved for patients unable to perform adequate exercise, and all pharmacologic stressors except regadenoson were given using weight based protocols. Adenosine was administered as a 6-min infusion at 140 μg/kg/min which could be reduced to 110 μg/kg/min if severe symptoms or hemodynamic effects were encountered. Dipyridamole was infused over 4 min at a dose of 0.56 mg/kg. Regadenoson was administered as a 0.4 mg/5 ml bolus followed by a 5 ml saline flush. With dipyridamole or regadenoson, aminophylline (50 to 125 mg intravenous over 30 s) was routinely administered a minimum of 3 min after radiotracer injection for reversal (or prevention) of side effects. The dobutamine protocol consisted of an initial infusion of 5-10 μg/kg/min, increasing incrementally every 3 min to 40 μg/kg/min to achieve a target heart rate of ≥85% of predicted maximal with the addition of atropine and/or arm exercise if ≥85% of the maximum predicted heart rate was not achieved after the maximum dose. Exercise testing was performed using the symptom-limited Bruce or modified Bruce protocol. Exercise was terminated for limiting cardiac symptoms or for >2 mm horizontal or downsloping ST segment depression measured 80 ms after the J-point over at least 3 consecutive beats. For ambulatory patients with known or perceived functional limitations at the time of testing, a combined stress protocol of vasodilator stress with adjunctive exercise was also utilized. In such cases, exercise stress began after completion of dipyridamole infusion, at the start of adenosine infusion, and if a patient was unable to reach a standard exercise testing endpoint, regadenoson was used only as needed. The patients who underwent a combined protocol were analyzed within the respective vasodilator agent used for testing and not as a separate stress modality group. Standard SPECT and PET imaging and radionuclide dosing protocols as endorsed by the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology were used for all patients.
Endpoints
Data regarding adverse events within 24 h of stress MPI were obtained from the stress test reports and by reviewing electronic medical records. The primary endpoint was a composite of death, non-fatal MI (ST elevation that persisted beyond the stress test associated with angina symptoms or increase in troponin after an initial decrease), congestive heart failure [(CHF) clinical worsening or new onset of symptoms], stroke, ventricular arrhythmias (new onset non-sustained and sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation), atrial fibrillation/flutter, or atrioventricular (second or third degree) block requiring intervention. The secondary endpoint comprised the individual components of the primary (composite) endpoint.
Statistical Analysis
Clinical and baseline characteristics were expressed as mean ± standard deviation or as percentages. Inter-group comparisons were performed using analysis of variance, with a post hoc Scheffé’s test to evaluate differences between any two stressors for continuous variables and the Chi-square or Fisher exact test for categorical variables. Logistic regression was performed to determine if any variables were independent predictors of the primary (composite) endpoint. In this analysis, stress modality [exercise or vasodilator (pooled)] was included in the model as were variables with a P value ≤0.2 on univariate analysis. An a priori alpha level ( α ) of 0.05 was used as the basis for statistical significance; however, a Bonferroni correction was applied for multiple categorical comparisons such that statistical significance was declared for results yielding P < α / k , where k was the number of comparisons. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS version 21 (IBM, Armonk, NY USA 2013).
Results
During this 3-year time period, a total of 703 stress MPI studies (91.3% pharmacologic) were performed in patient with a positive troponin ≤7 days prior to the MPI study. A total of 360 (51.2%) patients underwent regadenoson stress, 199 (28.3%) underwent dipyridamole stress, 74 (10.5%) underwent adenosine stress, 9 (1.3%) underwent dobutamine stress, and 61 (8.7%) underwent exercise stress (Figure 1 ). Of the 61 patients who underwent exercise stress, 40 (66%) achieved ≥85% of the maximum predicted heart rate. Of the 9 patients who underwent dobutamine stress, 6 (67%) achieved ≥85% of the maximum predicted heart rate. There was no statistically significant association between achieving ≥85% of the maximum predicted heart rate and adverse events in these two groups. Notably, 16 (2.3%) patients underwent a combined protocol of vasodilator stress (1 using adenosine, 1 using dipyridamole, and 14 using regadenoson) with adjunctive exercise. Of the 703 patients, 184 (26.2%) patients underwent PET perfusion imaging.
The demographic and clinical characteristics in all patients are shown in Table 1 . Patients having undergone exercise stress were younger than those having undergone pharmacologic stress. In addition, traditional CAD risk factors including hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia were less prevalent in patients who underwent exercise stress as was a history of MI, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). There were differences in the demographic and clinical characteristics between the three vasodilator stress groups which may reflect differences in patient populations between the participating centers. The patients in the dipyridamole group were significantly younger, while a higher percentage was male as compared to the regadenoson and adenosine groups. There was a significant difference in the TIMI scores among stressor groups (3.5 ± 1.2 for regadenoson, 3.5 ± 1.4 for dipyridamole, 3.3 ± 0.8 for adenosine, 3.1 ± 1.5 for dobutamine, and 2.9 ± 1.5 for exercise ( P < 0.001). In post hoc analysis, the only significant differences in the TIMI scores were between either the regadenoson or dipyridamole and exercise stress groups ( P < 0.05). When the vasodilator stress agents were pooled, there was a significant difference in the TIMI score compared to exercise (3.5 ± 1.2 vs 2.9 ± 1.5 respectively, P < 0.001). There was no significant difference between the vasodilator stress groups for history MI, PCI, or CABG. At the time of stress MPI, most of the study patients were hospitalized, with only 1 outpatient (recent discharge after acute MI treated with PCI) and 9 were from the emergency department. The time from elevated troponin to stress MPI was 3.0 ± 2.0 days for regadenoson, 3.3 ± 2.3 days for dipyridamole, 2.9 ± 2.1 days for adenosine, 4.4 ± 4.1 days for dobutamine, and 2.0 ± 1.4 days for exercise ( P < 0.001). When the vasodilator stress agents were pooled, there was a significant difference in the time from elevated troponin to stress MPI compared to exercise (3.1 ± 2.1 vs 2.0 ± 1.4 days respectively, P < 0.001).

Of the 703 patients, 11 (1.6%) had an adverse event (Table 2 ). The incidence of adverse events was low in all vasodilator stressor groups with the composite endpoint ranging from 1% to 1.4%. The highest incidence of the composite endpoint was in the dobutamine stress group at 11.1%. The incidence of the composite endpoint in the exercise stress group was 3.3% with no significant difference among pharmacologic stressors ( P = 0.137). When the vasodilator stress agents were pooled, there was no significant difference in the composite endpoint compared to exercise (1.3% vs 3.3% respectively, P = 0.217). No adverse events occurred in the patients who underwent a combined protocol of vasodilator stress with adjunctive exercise. The most frequent adverse event was non-fatal MI which occurred in 7 (1.0%) of all patients, and within each of the stressor groups occurred in 3 (0.8%) patients following regadenoson stress, in no patients following dipyridamole stress, in 1 (1.4%) patient following adenosine stress, in 1 (11.1%) patient following dobutamine stress, and in 2 (3.3%) patients following exercise stress ( P = 0.005); in post hoc analysis, the only significant difference was between exercise and dipyridamole ( P = 0.01). The other adverse events were death in 1 (0.5%) patient following dipyridamole stress, CHF in 1 (0.3%) patient following regadenoson stress, ventricular arrhythmia (non-sustained ventricular tachycardia) in 1 (0.3%) patient following regadenoson stress, and atrial arrhythmia in 1 (0.5%) patient following dipyridamole stress.

The details of the adverse events in the 11 patients are summarized in Table 3 . Of the 7 patients with non-fatal MI during or after stress testing, 2 patients had angiography and PCI performed after stress testing and subsequently had elevations in troponin. This could be reflective of a Type IV PCI related MI and not a consequence of the stress test. Three patients had ST segment elevation MI during or after stress testing. One of these patients experienced chest pain with ST segment elevation during dobutamine stress (maximum dose of 40 μg/kg/min and achievement of 85% of the maximum predicted heart rate) and underwent urgent angiography which revealed a 90% stenosis in the right coronary artery and was treated with PCI. Another patient who was admitted with chest pain, diffuse T wave inversions on the electrocardiogram (ECG), and elevated troponin underwent exercise and at peak stress [completion of stage 4 (12 min) of the Bruce protocol achieving 86% of the maximum predicted heart rate] developed severe anterior chest pain that persisted 10 min into recovery. This was accompanied by ST elevations in the inferolateral leads which resolved 5 min into recovery. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed no significant obstructive coronary disease. The third patient exercised for 9 min and 30 s (stage 4 of the Bruce protocol) and achieved 80% of the maximum predicted heart rate without chest discomfort or ECG changes. Ten minutes into recovery, the patient suddenly developed severe chest pain, and the ECG showed ST segment elevation in leads 1 and AVL. Urgent angiography revealed 99% ostial stenosis in the diagonal branch of the left anterior descending coronary artery which was treated with PCI. The other 2 patients had elevation of cardiac troponin after stress testing but were asymptomatic and without significant ECG changes.

There was only 1 death occurring within 24 h after stress testing in our study cohort. A patient with known three-vessel CAD, prior CABG, and severe ischemic cardiomyopathy underwent dipyridamole stress for recurrent chest pain. The MPI study revealed a large fixed anteroseptal defect and a small inferior defect with minimal reversibility. The patient was being considered for repeat CABG; however, EuroSCORE predicted a mortality of over 30%. The day after stress testing, the patient had symptomatic bradycardia with a drop in blood pressure which required placement of a temporary transvenous pacemaker. Subsequently, the patient had episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia. The pacemaker wire was repositioned, but the patient subsequently had a pulseless electrical activity arrest and could not be revived despite resuscitative efforts. The initial bradycardia in this patient was thought to be partly secondary to premature ventricular complexes with compensatory pauses, which could have reflected ischemia, and the episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia were likely due to ischemia or transvenous pacemaker placement and less likely secondary to the stress agent.
One patient had symptoms of new onset CHF within 24 h of regadenoson stress. One patient had new onset of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia 16 h after regadenoson stress. One patient experienced new onset of atrial flutter within 24 h of dipyridamole stress.
As shown in Table 4 , there were no significant differences in the clinical variables between patients with and without an adverse event. The clinical variables most related to the composite endpoint ( P ≤ 0.2) were age (patients with an adverse event were younger), hypertension (lower proportion with an adverse event), and smoking (higher proportion with an adverse event). The proportion of patients having undergone vasodilator stress was lower, albeit slightly, in those with an adverse event ( P = 0.207). The time from elevated troponin to stress MPI (days) in patients with an adverse event was shorter, but not significantly so, than in those without ( P = 0.103). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine whether any variables were independent predictors of adverse events. For this analysis, dobutamine stress was excluded due to low patient numbers, and vasodilator stress was pooled based on the fact that there were no significant differences between the three agents regarding the incidence of adverse events. As shown in Table 5 , similar unadjusted (univariate) logistic regression findings for each of these variables (none statistically significant) emerged regarding the occurrence of the composite endpoint [advancing age: less likely; hypertension: less likely; smoking: more likely; vasodilator stress: less likely; and shorter time from elevated troponin to stress MPI; more likely]. These five variables were included in a multivariate logistic regression model, and none emerged as an independent predictor of adverse events (Table 5 ).

Discussion
To our knowledge, there was no literature prior to the current study on the safety of using regadenoson for stress MPI in patients with recently elevated cardiac biomarkers. We chose to study this population because this higher risk cohort with elevated cardiac biomarkers would also shed light on potential safety issues which might affect lower risk cohorts which is helpful, given the rarity of adverse outcomes among this patient population. When compared to adenosine or dipyridamole, regadenoson has a more pronounced increase in heart rate and a longer duration of action than adenosine which raises concerns regarding its safety in the immediate post-MI period. , There are currently several case reports of MI during regadenoson stress, , as well as reports of seizure. , Despite the aforementioned concerns, our findings indicate that using vasodilator stress agents, including regadenoson, in patients with recently elevated cardiac biomarkers for stress MPI is safe with an incidence of adverse events within 24-h that is both very low and comparable to that observed with exercise testing. Moreover, neither univariate nor multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that performance of vasodilator stress was a significant predictor of adverse outcomes.
The safety of exercise and vasodilator stress in the non-acute setting has been examined repeatedly. Reviewing 170,000 tests, exercise stress testing was found to have a risk of death of approximately 1 in 10,000 and a combined mortality and morbidity of 4 in 10,000. Dipyridamole was extensively studied in 74,000 patients and was similar to exercise with 7 cardiac deaths, 13 non-fatal myocardial infarctions, 6 significant arrhythmias, and 10 transient cerebral ischemic attacks or strokes. In the approximately 2000 patients studied in the ADVANCE trials of regadenoson and adenosine, there were no major adverse events reported. , The safety of exercise stress and dipyridamole stress has been studied in several small cohorts in the post-MI setting with no significant major adverse events reported in several hundred patients. , In the INSPIRE study, 728 survivors of acute MI were prospectively studied with no adenosine- or procedure-related adverse events reported.
Despite what appears to be an excellent safety profile, there are reports of MI induced by vasodilator stress in the literature and in the FAERS database. Hsi et al. described a case of acute MI 15 min after regadenoson injection in a patient with ischemic cardiomyopathy and an implantable cardioverter defibrillator. In this report, the patient developed severe chest pain and ST segment elevation in multiple leads and unstable ventricular tachycardia which was successfully terminated by his device. During vasodilator stress, this patient had a higher than average heart rate response with a 35 beats/min increase compared with the mean of 25 ± 11 observed in clinical trials. Subsequent angiography in this patient revealed 100% occlusion of proximal LAD and mid RCA. Notably, the regadenoson stress protocol in that report did not utilize aminophylline for reversal (or prevention) of side effects while the protocol for regadenoson stress employed by both laboratories in the current study routinely utilizes aminophylline for this purpose. It is possible, although not investigated in this study, that the routine use of aminophylline may prevent subsequent adverse events caused by vasodilator stressors. In another report, Shah et al. also described a case of acute ST elevation MI in a patient 6 min after regadenoson administration. Subsequent angiography revealed 95% critical stenosis of the LAD. In the literature, there is one case reported of ST segment elevation MI and two cases of non-ST segment elevation MI during adenosine stress. - Cases such as these and others reported to the FAERS database resulted in package label changes to adenosine and regadenoson in October of 2013. , Several mechanisms for infarction due to vasodilator stress have been proposed and include a decrease in coronary perfusion pressure due to systemic hypotension in the setting of a critical stenosis, prolonged coronary steal without adequate collateral flow, coronary vasospasm, or an enhanced tendency for thrombus formation due to intimal injury resulting from increased turbulent flow across a stenotic lesion. In our study, non-fatal MI was the most frequently occurring adverse event although the incidence was low with any form of vasodilator stress and occurred more frequently with dobutamine and exercise stress. The high physiologic stress and myocardial oxygen demand associated with exercise or dobutamine (the latter reportedly carrying the highest risk of adverse events among stress modalities) increases the risk of ischemia and acute plaque rupture and may explain the aforementioned findings. While the literature refers to performing both symptom-limited or submaximal exercise stress in the post-MI patient, - two-thirds of the exercise stress and dobutamine stress patients in this cohort achieved ≥85% of maximum predicted heart rate which may not be ideal despite no statistically significant association ( P = 1.0) between heart rate achieved and adverse events in this cohort.
More recently published reports have noted cases of seizure, asystole, and unresponsiveness following regadenoson use. Due to concerns over the increased incidence of seizures following regadenoson and adenosine use, the package insert was changed to include warnings on seizures. It is thought that adenosine selective A(2A) receptors located in the central nervous system have both inhibitory and excitatory effects and may play a role in the initiation of seizures. Our study focused on cardiac-related adverse events with stress testing and did not investigate these neurological complications. Additional recent package label changes to adenosine and regadenoson included atrial fibrillation/flutter and cerebrovascular accident which resulted from post-market reporting to the FDA. In our study, the incidence of both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias with any stressor was low, and there were no strokes observed.
The role of stress MPI in evaluating and risk stratifying patients with elevated cardiac biomarkers is only expected to increase with the advent of widespread use of high-sensitivity troponin assays. Our study population likely consisted of two distinct patient cohorts. The first was patients who suffered a MI, who did not undergo an early invasive strategy of management, and who were referred for stress MPI for post-MI risk stratification. The second cohort was patients with minimal elevations in troponin who were referred for stress MPI to determine if the elevated troponin was the result of CAD. Both of these populations are expected to remain important in the future as MPI remains a gate keeper to the cardiac catheterization laboratory and remains an important diagnostic tool for emergency department patients. It is of interest to speculate on the clinical significance of the adverse events in this cohort and if the events were directly related to the stressor. In 5 of the patients (2 NSTEMI’s, 1 CHF, and 2 arrhythmias), the clinical significance of the adverse event was negligible while causality cannot be definitively determined. Two additional patients had elevations in troponin following successful PCI making the Type IV MI unlikely to be related to the stressor. Finally, the 3 STEMI’s (2 in exercise stress patients) and the single death are certainly clinically important, but the causality between the stressor and the death in the patient with multi-vessel CAD and an ischemic cardiomyopathy is not certain.
Limitations
The current study was retrospective with all of the associated limitations. Comparisons of adverse events between each of the vasodilator stressors and exercise would not allow for adequate power to detect differences given a literature reported incidence of adverse events of 0.04%-0.05%, , and may result in type II errors (concluding that there was no difference when in reality there was a difference). Due to the rarity of events, multiplicity of stress testing modalities, and potential over-fitting of the logistic regression model, the statistical conclusions should be accepted with caution. However, these comparisons may still be useful as the clinical significance of finding a low or zero event rate in patients undergoing vasodilator stress is separate and arguably more important than the statistical significance. This study’s sample size is clinically relevant and equivalent to the annual volume of many labs and thus can provide useful data for the practicing clinician. Assuming an equal (50%-50%) distribution of patients into two groups, a non-inferiority design comparing the incidence of adverse events associated with pharmacologic stressors and those associated with exercise would require 894,000 subjects in each group for a total sample size of 1,788,000 subjects to achieve 79.5% power to detect those differences based on the literature reported incidence of adverse events. Preliminary data such as these may serve as the foundation for larger future studies examining the safety of vasodilator stress in patients both with and without elevated cardiac biomarkers. There was not a control group (patients with elevated cardiac troponin who were not referred for non-invasive testing) included for comparison and, while beyond the scope of this study, may provide further insights regarding the safety of performing stress MPI in this high-risk population. Some of the adverse events observed may have been destined to occur, even without stress testing, given the high risk nature of this population with elevated cardiac biomarkers. We reviewed all patients with an elevated cardiac troponin ≤7 days of the MPI study regardless of the indication for troponin testing and therefore had some degree of heterogeneity in the population. The troponin assays were different at the two hospitals and the assays changed during the study period precluding a comparison of the absolute troponin elevations between patients. We did not investigate for the occurrence of seizures as an adverse event during or following stress testing.
Conclusion
In the current era of medicine, patients now referred for stress MPI are often high risk and have an increasing burden of comorbidities and cardiac risk factors. , In patients with elevated cardiac biomarkers, serious complications with exercise or vasodilator stress testing appear to be relatively rare, both in the current study and in past literature. The evaluation of acutely ill cardiac patients is not without risks, but in this study, there was no increased risk attributable to a particular vasodilator stressor. Remaining cognizant of the fact that stress testing is an elective procedure and patients with unstable symptoms or conditions should not be studied is paramount.
New Knowledge Gained
While adenosine and dipyridamole as MPI stress agents have literature supporting their safety and efficacy in the setting of MI, regadenoson does not. The evaluation of acutely ill cardiac patients is not without risks, but in this study of over 700 patients, there was no increased risk attributable to a particular vasodilator stressor. The primary endpoint of adverse cardiac events occurred in 11 (1.6%) patients with an incidence of 1.4% ( n = 5), 1.0% ( n = 2), 1.4% ( n = 1), 11.1% ( n = 1), and 3.3% ( n = 2) following regadenoson, dipyridamole, adenosine, dobutamine, and exercise stress, respectively ( P = 0.137). In the setting of elevated troponin, serious complications associated with either exercise or vasodilator stress testing appear to be relatively rare, both in the current study and in past literature.
