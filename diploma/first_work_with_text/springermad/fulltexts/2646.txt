Introduction
Small ruminant production fulfils important economic and social function in Nigeria due to the position of goat as a source of investment and protein for the teeming countries’ population. The WAD goat is the dominant breed of small ruminants found in the West Africa where they are raised under smallholder management system. According to Chiejina and Behnke ( ), Nigeria has the largest WAD goat population with approximately 11 million in the humid zone of eastern Nigeria, and this population may be higher today. It is a trypano-tolerant breed reared mainly for meat and weighed between 20 and 30 kg at maturity (Ahamefule et al. ). Despite this potential, the productivity of WAD goats in most tropical countries is low due to high cost of feed supplement and poor nutrient intake, and this has burden ruminant nutritionist on how to find cheaper and readily available feed supplements to reduce cost of feed. Availability of several close substitute feed ingredient could solve this problem of high cost of feed supplement for small ruminant production. Local and non competitive feed supplement is the only means of reducing the production cost of WAD goats, and this could be achieved through the use of leaf meal of tropical browse plants such as Moringa. Moringa oleifera is a multi-purpose tree that has considerable fodder yield in the tropical humid forest zone of Nigeria during the wet and dry seasons (Fadiyimu et al. ). It is a well-known tree in semi-arid zone where it is often cultivated as a live fence around people’s houses. Moringa leaf is rich in protein and energy and moderate in β-carotene, ascorbic acid, iron, methionine and cysteine with negligible amount of tannins (Makkar and Becker ) and could be use as feed supplement for ruminants.
The proximate biochemical composition of Moringa leaf and the growth performance of animal feed, Moringa leaf, have been researched extensively. Goats (Akinbamijo et al. ; Fadiyimu et al. ), snail (Ani et al. ) and broilers (Olugbemi et al. ) fed with Moringa leaf showed improved feed intake, nutrient utilization and growth rate. To date, little research has been conducted on the effect of Moringa leaf as feed component of WAD goats on blood characteristics of WAD goats. Therefore, the thrust of the study was to evaluate the effect of Moringa oleifera leaf meal on blood chemistry and haematology of West African Dwarf goats.
Materials and methods
This experiment was conducted at the small ruminant unit of the teaching and research farm, Michael Okpara University of Agriculture, Umudike, Nigeria. The study lies between latitude 05 o 28 1 N and longitude 07 o 31 1 E. Fresh Moringa oleifera leaves were collected in Ihitte Uboma and Obowo in Imo State, southeast Nigeria. They were sun dried for 5 days, milled and stored in polyethene bags. Proximate composition of experimental diets was determined as described by AOAC ( ) at the Department of Animal Production and Management Laboratory, Michael Okpara University of Agriculture Umudike, Nigeria. Four experimental diets were formulated as follows: A (control), which contained 0% MOLM, B, C and D which contained 5, 10 and 15% MOLM, respectively (Table 1 ). Thirty six (36), 10–11 months healthy WAD goats were purchased at a local market in Ihitte-Uboma, Imo state southeast Nigeria. The experimental animals were divided into four groups of nine animals each, with each group replicated thrice with three animals per replicate. Each group was allotted to one of the diets in a completely randomized design. Care was taken to balance the weight of these animals among the groups. Each animal was housed in a compartment measuring 10 × 15 m in an open-sided goat house, and feed was offered based on 3% body weight per day. In addition, all the animals were offered 2 kg fresh forage sward of Panicum maximum , Aspillia africana and Alchornea cordifolia . Water was given ad libitum, and the feeding trial lasted for 90 days. The experimental animals were acclimatized for 21 days before the commencement of the study in accordance with the permission and stipulated guidelines of the Federal University of Technology, Owerri (FUTO) Animal Ethics Committee.

On the 90th day of the experiment, blood was collected from the jugular vein of three animals in each group. The samples were separated into two lots and used for biochemical and haematological determinations as described by Dacie and Lewis ( ). Five milliliters of blood sample was collected from each sample in labelled sterile universal bottle containing ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) and used for haematological analysis. Another 5 ml was collected over anti-coagulant free bottle and used for serum biochemical determination. Serum biochemistry and haematological parameters were measured using Beckman Coulter Ac-T10 Laboratory Haematology Blood Analyser and Bayer DCA 2000+ HbA1c analyser, respectively. Mean cells haemoglobin (MCH), mean cell volume (MCV) and mean cell haemoglobin concentrations (MCHC) were calculated. The results were analysed using the Special Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) Windows 17.0. One way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed to determine the means and standard error. Treatment means were compared using Duncan’s new multiple range test (Duncan ).
Results
Effect of MOLM supplementation on haematological parameters
The proximate compositions of the experimental diets, MOLM and forage sward are presented in Table 2 . The analysis revealed the presence of dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), crude fibre, ether extract, ash and gross energy. The haematological characteristics are shown in Table 3 . PCV value for the goats on control diet were lower ( p < 0.05) to those on diet D, but similar to those on diet B and C ( p > 0.05). The haemoglobin (Hb) and red blood cell (RBC) count values obtained in this study showed no significant ( p > 0.05) differences among dietary groups. MCV values for the goats on control diet were significantly lower ( p < 0.05) to those on diet C, but similar to those on diet B and D ( p > 0.05). MCH and MCHC values were similar among treatments ( p > 0.05). The MOLM-based diets improved WBC count ( p < 0.05) among the dietary groups. The lymphocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils values were not affected ( p > 0.05) by the treatment diets, but the lymphocyte concentration generally increased in a dose related manner.

Discussions
This study determined the proximate biochemical composition of MOLM. It also evaluated the effect of leaf meal of MOLM on blood chemistry and haematology of WAD goats. The CP value of 23.24% reported for MOLM in the present study is an indication that Moringa leaf is a good source of protein, and this is similar to the crude protein values of 23.27 and 22.2% reported by Nouala et al. ( ) and Asaolu et al. ( ), respectively. The crude protein content of all the diets was above the minimum nitrogen requirement of 8% needed by micro-organisms to support basic rumen activities in goats (Tona et al. ). The haematology showed that PCV values fell within the normal value of 21.0–36.9% reported for clinically healthy WAD goats by Daramola et al. ( ). The significantly high PCV value at 15% inclusion level could be attributed to enhance utilization of the diets as corroborated by Asaolu et al. ( ) who reported improved PCV in WAD placed on Moringa leaf multinutrient block. These results are also in agreement with the results of Babeker and Bdalbagi ( ) who reported increased Hb concentration, RBC and WBC counts, RBC indices in goats fed Moringa leaf meal based diets. The values of MCV, MCH and MCHC reveals that the quality in the ration are similar to that of the control (Asaolu et al. ) thus indicating that the nutritional quality of the ration was not compromised. There were significant variations in the circulating WBC count among goats in all the dietary groups. These values were found within the reported normal range of 6.8–20.1× 10 3 /μl (Daramola et al. ) hence ruling out the possibility of leukocytosis. The significant variations in the WBC counts of goats on treated diets could be attributed in part to improved digestibility and utilization of nutrients in the diets. The absolute lymphocyte counts for goats in group B (57.13%), C (59.50%) and D (61.13%) were higher than that of group A (53.50%); however, these values fell within the range of 47–82% reported for clinically, healthy goats (Daramola et al. ).
The values of serum creatinine fell within the range of 0.7–1.5 mg/dl reported by Olaifa and Opara ( ) for WAD goats. These values were however, higher than the value of 0.25–0.30 mg/dl reported by Ikhimioya and Imasuen ( ), and the observed difference could be attributed to breed effect. Eggum ( ) associated high blood urea level with poor protein quality in animal. The similarity serum urea value between goats in treated groups and the control is an indication that the quality of the diets was not compromised. The AST values fell closely the value of 1.2–3.8 mmol/l for WAD goats by Olaifa and Opara ( ). In addition, the present values were within the range of 0.8–9.7 mmol/l reported by Daramola et al. ( ) for clinically healthy WAD goats. The value of total bilirubin obtained for goats in groups B, C and D in the current study compared favourably with values of 0.80 mg/dl obtained for WAD goats by Okonkwo et al. ( ). Serum enzymes are used as an index of feed quality (Ogbuewu et al. ), and the lack of significant difference in most of the serum enzymes measured (all which remained within the normal value for the breed) is an indication of high quality of the test diets (Oluwole-Banjo et al. ).
Conclusions
In conclusion Moringa oleifera leaf meal is of very good nutritional value and is suitable for goat production. It is therefore recommended that WAD goats can tolerate up to 15% MOLM in their diets without deleterious effects on blood characteristics.
