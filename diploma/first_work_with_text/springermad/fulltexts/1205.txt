Introduction
Whooping cough (pertussis) caused by Bordetella pertussis ( B. pertussis ) is one of the most prevalent vaccine-preventable diseases with worldwide reported cases at nearly 450,000 during 2014–2016 [ , ]. Rapid waning of vaccine immunity is considered one of the key factors for the recent resurgence of pertussis [ , , , ]. As innate immunity shapes the adaptive immune response to vaccination, a better understanding of the innate immune response to B. pertussis may help the development of more effective vaccine formulations. Both humoral immunity and cell-mediated immunity contribute to the protection of pertussis infections [ , , ]. The cell-mediated response to B. pertussis infection is predominantly characterized by Th1 and Th17 cells. Both IFNγ and IL-17 activate and enhance bacterial killing by macrophages, whereas IL-17 also induces expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, antimicrobial peptides and adhesion molecules, and neutrophil accumulation at the site of infection [ , , ]. In addition to Th1 and Th17 cells, IFNγ and IL-17 can be secreted by innate immune cells. Innate IFNγ and IL-17 provide early control of bacterial infections including Staphylococcus aureus , Escherichia coli , and Listeria monocytogenes ( L. monocytogenes ) [ , , ]. The innate IFNγ and IL-17 influence the degree and type of inflammation and shape the subsequent adaptive Th1 and Th17 responses through yet to be defined mechanisms [ , , ]. Innate IFNγ and IL-17 secretion is likely induced by upstream cytokines such as IL-12, IL-1β, and IL-23 produced by antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells (DCs) which also guide the naive T cell differentiation. In a model of B. pertussis infection in BALB/c (B/c) mice, NK cells were the primary early source of IFNγ in the lung [ ]. Depletion of NK cells resulted in enhancement of bacterial load in the lungs and dissemination of the bacteria to the liver, indicating that NK cells contribute to the resistance to B. pertussis [ ]. In another study, lung γδT cells were shown to be the early source of innate IL-17 in C57BL/6 (B6) mice [ ]. Neutralization of early IL-17 increased the bacterial burden and reduced the production of antimicrobial peptides in the lungs, demonstrating that γδT cells provide early protection to B. pertussis by secreting IL-17 [ ].
The influence of genetic differences on the immune response to vaccination or infections is well established through studies in mice, humans, and other species [ , , , ]. Among inbred mouse strains, B/c and B6 mice are the most commonly used strains in biomedical research. B/c mice are prone to a Th2 response and B6 mice to a Th1 response, resulting in different susceptibility to a variety of pathogens including Leishmania major , Trypanosoma cruzi , Chlamydia muridarum , Burkholderia pseudomallei , Yersinia enterocolitica , Mycobacterium avium , and L. monocytogenes [ , , , , , , ]. In addition to adaptive immunity, innate immunity could also contribute to the different susceptibility between B/c and B6 [ , , ]. We recently observed marked quantitative differences between B/c and B6 mice in the innate IFNγ and IL-17 secretion by mouse splenocytes stimulated with heat-killed B. pertussis (hkBp). We report here on experimental studies aimed at elucidating the mechanisms underlying these differential cytokine responses. Knowledge of factors that drive the innate IFNγ and IL-17 responses may inform the design of more effective vaccines against B. pertussis .
Materials and methods
Mice
Female BALB/c (B/c) and C57BL/6 (B6) mice (5–8 weeks old) purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) were maintained in a barrier facility in ventilated cages with food and water provided ad libitum. Mice were euthanized by CO 2 asphyxiation for spleen collection. The protocol was approved by the Purdue University Animal Care and Use Committee.
Bacterial strain and culture
Bordetella pertussis strain D420 was kindly provided by Dr. Tod Merkel (Food and Drug Administration, Rockville, MD, USA). B. pertussis was cultured on Bordet-Gengou agar (Remel, Lenexa, KS, USA) at 37 °C for 3 days. To make heat-killed B. pertussis (hkBp), bacteria were re-suspended in sterile PBS, the OD 600 reading measured, and heat inactivation performed at 65 °C for 30 min as reported previously [ , ]. The concentration of the hkBp (pfu/ml) was determined by interpolation of the linear regression equation between the absorbance and the concentration of the bacteria (pfu/ml) previously calibrated.
Stimulation of spleen cells and ELISA for cytokines
Splenocytes were collected from B/c or B6 mice by grinding spleens on a metal mesh with the plunger of a 5-ml syringe. Red blood cells were removed by ammonium-chloride-potassium lysing buffer (0.15 M NH 4 Cl, 10 mM KHCO 3 , 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.2–7.4) and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Total splenocytes were seeded into 24-well plates (3 × 10 6 /well) in Iscove’s Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (IMEM; Corning, Manassas, VA, USA) supplemented with 10% FCS, antibiotic-antimycotic solution (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), and 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma). Cells were stimulated for 18 h with hkBp at ratios of 200:1 and 50:1 (bacteria to cell). The concentration of IL-17 and IFNγ in the supernatants was determined by ELISA (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA). Cytokine concentrations below the detection limit were assigned a value equivalent to half of the detection limit.
In cytokine neutralization experiments, anti-IL-1β (clone B122, BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA), anti-IL-23p19 (clone MMP19B2, BioLegend), anti-IL-12p35 (clone C18.2, eBioscience), or anti-IL12/IL23p40 (clone C17.8, BioLegend) antibodies were added immediately prior to hkBp stimulation.
Flow cytometry for identification of IL-17 and IFNγ-secreting cells
Splenocytes were prepared and stimulated as described above for 18 h. Brefeldin A (BioLegend) was added during the final 4 h prior to analysis by flow cytometry. In experiments to identify the percentage of γδT-17 among total γδT cells, splenocytes were stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) (25 ng/ml) plus ionomycin (1 μg/ml) for 4 h in the presence of Brefeldin A. Cells were washed, incubated with Zombie Violet™ Fixable Viability Kit (BioLegend) for 20 min, blocked with anti-mouse CD16/32, and labeled with combinations of fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal antibodies (all from BioLegend) against mouse TCRβ (clone H57-597), Nkp46 (clone 29A1.4), CD49b (clone DX5), TCRγδ (clone GL3), CD4 (clone GK1.5), CD8a (clone 53-6.7), B220 (clone RA3-6B2), CD27 (clone LG.3A10), and CD44 (clone IM7). After fixation and permeabilization, cells were labeled with anti-mouse IL-17A (clone TC11-18H10.1) or anti-IFNγ (clone XMG1.2). After the final wash, cells were examined in a FACSCanto II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). Data were analyzed by FlowJo software (FlowJo, Eugene, OR, USA).
Stimulation of dendritic cells
DCs were generated from the bone marrow of B/c and B6 mice as previously described [ ]. Cells were cultured with or without hkBp (100:1, 10:1, or 1:1) for 8 h. As a positive control, DCs were primed with 1 μg/ml LPS for 4 h and stimulated with 2 mM ATP for another 4 h. Supernatants were analyzed for IL-12p70, IL-1β, and IL-23 by ELISA (eBioscience).
Western blot for dendritic cell signaling
Dendritic cells were seeded in IMEM in 12-well plates (2 × 10 6 /well). After overnight incubation, cells were stimulated with hkBp (100:1) for 30 or 60 min. Control DCs were stimulated with LPS (1 μg/ml) or with medium only. DCs were washed once with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS, and cell lysate was collected in 100 μl of lysis buffer (1% NP40, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 8.0) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA) and Halt™ Phosphatase Inhibitor (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA). Cell lysate was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (GenHunter, Nashville, TN, USA). The membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk and probed with anti-phospho-IKKα/β (#2697), anti-phospho-IκBα (#9246), anti-phospho-p38 MAPK (#9216), anti-phospho-SAPK/JNK (#4668), anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK (#4376), anti-p38 MAPK (#9212), anti-SAPK/JNK (#9252), and anti-p44/42 MAPK (#4695; all from Cell Signaling) and anti-β-actin (sc-47778) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA). After washing, membranes were incubated with goat anti-rabbit or mouse secondary antibody labeled with horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA). The stained protein bands were revealed by Amersham™ ECL™ Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare Biosciences, Pittsburgh, PA, USA), and the images were captured in a G:Box (Syngene, Frederick, MD, USA).
Stimulation of column-purified γδT cells in the presence of DCs or cytokines
Splenocytes from B/c and B6 mice were passed through nylon wool columns to deplete B cells and enriched for TCRγδ + T cell using an isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec, San Diego, CA, USA). Purified γδT cells were transferred into 96-wells with bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DCs) seeded the day before at 2 × 10 5 /well. HkBp (50:1 to DC number) were added to each well, and supernatants were collected after 18 h to determine cytokine concentrations. In other experiments, γδT cells were incubated with recombinant IL-1β (0.5 ng/m), IL-23 (1 ng/ml), and/or IL-12 (5 ng/ml) (eBioscience) in the presence or absence of hkBp for 18 h.
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as mean + SEM. The statistical significance of differences between groups was determined by Student’s t test or one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test (GraphPad Prism 6, La Jolla, CA, USA; SPSS Statistics 23, IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA).
Results
Cellular composition of the spleens from B/c and B6 mice
The spleen is a secondary lymphoid organ involved in immune responses to B. pertussis in mouse models [ ]. Since our studies were focused on differences in the response to B. pertussis by spleen cells from B/c and B6 mice, we first determined the percentages of NK cells and T cell subpopulations. The distributions were similar except for γδT and CD4 T cells (Table 1 ). B/c had a significantly lower percentage of γδT cells and a significantly higher percentage of CD4 T cells than B6 mice (Table 1 ).

B. pertussis induces a stronger innate IFNγ response and weaker innate IL-17 response in B6 than B/c mice
The B. pertussis antigens prepared by heat inactivation induced higher levels of cytokines than those prepared by sonication of the bacteria [ ]. In addition, incubation of live B. pertussis with splenic macrophage resulted in cell death [ ]. Hence, heat-killed B. pertussis (hkBp) were used to stimulate splenocytes for innate IFNγ and IL-17 secretion.
Upon incubation with hkBp for 18 h, B/c splenocytes secreted significantly less IFNγ and more IL-17 than B6 splenocytes (Fig. 1 a, b). The sources of the innate IFNγ and IL-17 secretion were identified by flow cytometry. The primary IFNγ-secreting cells in B/c mice were NK cells (43.8 ± 5.8%) while IFNγ in B6 mice was predominantly secreted by CD8 + T cells (39 ± 4.1%) and NK cells (19.5 ± 4.9%) (Fig. 1 c). NKT cells comprised 1.9 ± 0.4% in B/c mice and 4.4 ± 1.3% in B6 mice of the total population of IFNγ-secreting cells (Fig. 1 c). The major IL-17-secreting cell population was identified as γδT cells for both strains (B/c 74.19 ± 2.37%; B6 52.42 ± 7.06%), whereas NK, NKT, CD4 + , or CD8 + T cells contributed little or none (Fig. 1 d and data not shown). Fig. 1 B6 splenocytes generated a stronger innate IFNγ and weaker IL-17 responses than B/c upon heat-killed B. pertussis (hkBp) stimulation. a , b Splenocytes from B/c and B6 were cultured with or without hkBp (50:1 and 200:1) for 18 h.

Figures are representative of four independent experiments
Role of IL-12 for innate IFNγ reactions in B/c and B6 mice
Dendritic cells can induce IFNγ production by NK cells by secreting IL-12 upon exposure to B. pertussis [ ]. Therefore, we first examined the level of IL-12 secretion by B/c and B6 DCs. Although hkBp induced secretion of IL-12 from both B/c and B6 DCs, the concentration of IL-12 was significantly higher in B6 DCs (Fig. 2 a). The role of IL-12 in the production of innate IFNγ was determined by neutralization with anti-IL-12p40 or IL-12p35 antibodies (the components of IL-12p70). Neutralization of IL-12p35 or IL-12p40 significantly reduced the concentration of IFNγ, while neutralization of IL-1β and IL-23p19 had no effect for both strains (Fig. 2 b, c). This suggests that B. pertussis stimulates innate IFNγ secretion via the induction of upstream IL-12 by DCs for both B/c and B6, and that the increased frequency of IFNγ-secreting cells in B6 mice correlates with increased secretion of IL-12. Fig. 2 IL-12 from dendritic cells (DCs) contributed to the stronger innate IFNγ response to hkBp in B6 mice. a DCs from B/c and B6 mice were incubated with hkBp (100:1, 10:1, or 1:1) or medium only for 8 h, or with LPS (1 μg/ml) for 4 h plus ATP (2 mM) for another 4 h as a positive control.

IFNγ in the supernatant was measured by ELISA.

The bars represent the mean + SEM of two to four independent experiments. Groups with different symbols are statistically different from each other ( p < 0.05)
Role of IL-1β and IL-23 for innate IL-17 reactions in B/c and B6 mice
Previous studies demonstrated that IL-1β and IL-23 can directly induce IL-17 production from γδT cells [ ]. Incubation of B/c and B6 DCs with hkBp induced secretion of IL-1β and IL-23 (Fig. 3 a, b). B/c DCs secreted more IL-1β than B6 DCs in response to hkBp while there was no significant difference in the secretion of IL-23 and IL-6 (Fig. 3 a, b and data not shown). To confirm the role of these upstream cytokines in stimulating IL-17 production, neutralizing antibodies were used to block IL-1β, IL-6, IL-23p19, IL-12p35, or IL12/IL23p40 (a subunit of both IL-23 and IL-12). The concentration of IL-17 was decreased significantly by anti-IL-1β or anti-IL23p19 as well as by anti-IL12/IL23p40 in both mouse strains (Fig. 3 c, d). Blocking IL-12p35 or IL-6 by neutralizing antibodies did not affect IL-17 secretion (Fig. 3 c, d and data not shown). These data suggest that hkBp stimulates γδT activation via induction of upstream IL-1β and IL-23 secreted by DCs, and that greater secretion of IL-1β contributes to the increased innate IL-17 secretion in B/c mice. Fig. 3 Cytokines from dendritic cells (DCs) contributed to the stronger innate IL-17 response to hkBp in B/c mice. a , b DCs from B/c and B6 mice were incubated with hkBp (100:1, 10:1, or 1:1) or medium only for 8 h, or with LPS (1 μg/ml) for 4 h plus ATP (2 mM) for another 4 h as a positive control.

Signaling in B/c and B6 DCs activated by B. pertussis
To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the difference in IL-12p70 and IL-1β secretion between B/c and B6 DCs, the activation of NF-κB and MAPK signaling was compared following stimulation with hkBp. Following stimulation of DCs from B/c and B6 with hkBp, activation of both NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways was indicated by the increased phosphorylation of the representative molecules (Fig. 4 ). However, activation of JNK signaling was significantly stronger in B/c DCs than in B6 DCs, but there was no significant difference in other phosphorylated MAPK or NF-κB signaling molecules (Fig. 4 and S1 a). Stimulation of cells with LPS also revealed phosphorylated JNK differences between B/c and B6 DCs (Fig. 4 and S1 b). Fig. 4 Differences in cell signaling induced by hkBp in dendritic cells from B/c and B6 mice. Dendritic cells were stimulated with hkBp (100:1) or LPS (1 μg/ml) for 30 or 60 min, and cell lysate was collected and subjected to Western blot for examination of NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways. The figure is representative of three independent experiments
Both extrinsic and γδT cell-intrinsic factors contributed to the differences in innate IL-17 secretion by γδT cells in B/c and B6 mice
To further examine the mechanisms underlying the different innate IL-17 responses from γδT cells between B/c and B6 mice, we co-cultured column-purified γδT cells from one mouse strain with DCs from the other mouse strain in the presence of hkBp. B/c γδT cells secreted more IL-17 when co-cultured with B/c DCs than with B6 DCs (Fig. 5 a), indicating that T cell-extrinsic factors such as the differential production of cytokines by DCs contributed to the IL-17 difference between B/c and B6 mice. However, B/c γδT cells consistently secreted more IL-17 than B6 γδT cells when co-cultured with either B/c or B6 DCs (Fig. 5 a), suggesting that intrinsic factors from γδT cells also contributed to the greater innate IL-17 secretion in B/c mice. Because the purity of column-purified γδT cells was lower for B/c than B6 (65 ± 0.3 vs 81 ± 1.4%, respectively), the results of the secreted IL-17 was confirmed by determining the percentage of IL-17-secreting γδT cells by flow cytometry (Fig. 5 b, c). Fig. 5 Both extrinsic and γδT cell-intrinsic factors contributed to the differences in innate IL-17 secretion by γδT cells in B/c and B6 mice. a Column-purified γδT from spleens of B/c and B6 mice were co-cultured with dendritic cells from B/c or B6 in the presence of hkBp (50:1 to DCs). The concentration of IL-17 was measured after 18 h by ELISA. b , c The number of IL-17 secreting γδT cells was quantified as TCRβ − TCRγδ + IL-17 + cells by flow cytometry. The representative flow staining results is shown. Data is also presented as the mean + SEM of three independent experiments. * p < 0.05; **** p < 0.001. d Column-purified γδT from of B/c and B6 spleens were incubated with recombinant IL-1β (0.5 ng/ml), IL-23 (1 ng/ml), and/or IL-12 (5 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of hkBp (50:1). The secreted IL-17 was measured by ELISA after 18 h. ** p < 0.01
We further confirmed the effect of cytokines and hkBp on γδT cell activation by treating purified γδT cells with recombinant IL-1β, IL-23, and/or IL-12 in the presence or absence of hkBp. HkBp or IL-23 alone did not induce IL-17 secretion from γδT cells, but the combination of IL-1β and IL-23 was sufficient to induce the secretion of IL-17 by γδT cells even in the absence of hkBp (Fig. 5 d). Furthermore, the addition of IL-12 along with IL-1β, IL-23, and hkBp suppressed the secretion of IL-17 (Fig. 5 d), indicating that IL-12 counteracts directly the effect of IL-1β and IL-23. The production of IL-17 by B6 γδT cells was generally much lower than that from B/c γδT cells. Although a similar effect of the upstream cytokines on B6 γδT cells was observed as in B/c mice, the effects did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 5 d). Our data support a role for extrinsic signals such as cytokines from DCs and γδT cell-intrinsic factors in the differences in the innate IL-17 responses.
Comparison of γδT cells between B/c and B6 mice
The γδT cells were further analyzed to reveal potential γδT cell-intrinsic factors. Although γδT cells played a minor role in IFNγ secretion upon hkBp stimulation, a higher percentage of IFNγ-secreting cells was found among B6 γδT cells compared with B/c mice (Figs. 1c , 6a , and S2 a). CD27 expression has been reported to distinguish between IL-17 (CD27 − ) and IFNγ (CD27 + )-secreting γδT cells in B6 mice [ ]. Consistent with these observations, the majority of IFNγ-secreting γδT cells in both B/c and B6 mice were CD27 + CD44 + , but both strains also contained a CD27 − CD44 + subpopulation (Fig. 6 b). As mentioned earlier, the major IL-17-secreting cell population comprised γδT cells in both B/c and B6 mice (Fig. 1 d). Within the γδT cell population, the percentage of IL-17 + cells (γδT-17) from B/c was significantly higher than that of B6 upon B. pertussis stimulation (Fig. 6 c and S2 b). The majority of γδT-17 cells were CD27 − CD44 hi in both B/c and B6 mice (Fig. 6 d). To determine if the higher percentage of γδT-17 cells in the spleen of B/c mice was specific for stimulation with hkBp, splenocytes were activated with PMA and ionomycin. B/c mice contained more γδT-17 cells per 10 6 splenocytes and more γδT-17 cells as a percentage of total γδT cells than B6 mice (Fig. 6 e, f and S2 c). These data suggests that the presence of more γδT-17 cells in the spleen contributed to the stronger innate IL-17 response in B/c mice.

Discussion
Experiments with IFNγ or IL-17-knockout mice and neutralization of IL-17 demonstrate the important role of these cytokines in the protection against B. pertussis infection [ , , , , ]. In the current study, we identified cells of the innate immune system that secrete IFNγ and IL-17 in response to hkBp, and demonstrated differences between B/c and B6 mice, indicating genetic regulation of these responses. These strain differences in innate IL-17 and IFNγ responses could not be explained by a different cellular composition of the spleen. The proportions of the examined types of cells were similar except for a higher percentage of CD4 + T cells and fewer γδT cells in B/c than in B6 spleens. The higher percentage of CD4 + T cells in B/c mice is consistent with previously reported data for male mice, but this report did not include γδT cells [ ].
The hkBp in these experiments was prepared from the same strain of B. pertussis as used previously to re-stimulate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in a baboon model of pertussis infection and vaccination [ , ]. Stimulation of baboon PBMCs with hkBp induced secretion of IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-23 similar to mouse DCs [ ]. However, hkBp did not induce innate IL-17 secretion in PBMCs from naïve baboons in contrast to our findings in mice. Possible explanations for this difference include the different source of cells, species differences, and the culture of PBMCs in RPMI-1640 medium which has a low concentration of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonists and limits IL-17 secretion from CD4 + T and Vγ9Vδ2 T cells compared with IMEM used in our studies [ , ].
CD8 + T cells are traditionally considered adaptive rather than innate sources of IFNγ, but previous studies have reported that CD8 + T cells can contribute to early IFNγ secretion in response to infections of L. monocytogenes , B. pseudomallei , or Cryptosporidium parvum [ , , , , ]. This innate response of CD8 + T cells can be induced by type I interferons, IL-12, and IL-18 through TCR/CD3 and self-peptide-MHC interactions [ , , ]. The innate IFNγ response provided resistance to L. monocytogenes infection in B6 but not in B/c mice, which did not have an innate CD8 + T-IFNγ response [ ]. Whether the difference in the innate CD8 + T-IFNγ response affects protection against B. pertussis requires further investigation.
It was reported that both IL-1β and IL-23 are necessary for γδT-17 activation even without T cell receptor engagement from anti-CD3 antibody [ ]. Our data clearly support this observation. The combination of IL-1β and IL-23 induced IL-17 production from purified γδT cells to a similar extent when the stimulation included hkBp. Our data also suggest that the higher level of IL-12 production in B6 contributes to the lower IL-17 secretion from B6 γδT cells since the addition of IL-12 to purified γδT cells decreased the secretion of IL-17 induced by IL-1β and IL-23. IL-12 promotes Th1-IFNγ polarization from naive CD4 + T cells and a shift from Th17 to Th1 cells [ ]. Our data suggest that this is also true for innate cellular secretion of IL-17 and IFNγ. Thus, both increased IL-1β and decreased IL-12 secretion by B/c splenocytes such as DCs likely contribute to the greater secretion of IL-17 by γδT cells in B/c mice compared with B6 mice.
Previous studies have shown the importance of NF-κB and MAP kinase signaling pathways in IL-23p19 and IL-12p40 promotor activation [ , , , ]. We observed significantly increased phosphorylation of JNK in B/c DC compared with B6 DC. Activation of JNK inhibits the expression of IL-12p40 in human macrophages [ ], but downstream transcription factors of JNK, including ATF2 and c-Jun, can activate the AP-1 site in the promoter region of IL-23p19 [ ]. Since IL-12 is composed of IL-12p40 and IL-12p45 and IL-23 is composed of IL-12p40 and IL-23p19, this suggests that the increased phosphorylation of JNK could reduce the secretion of IL-12 by B/c DC while maintaining the secretion of IL-23 resulting in a shift from IFNγ to IL-17 in B/c mice.
In addition to the extrinsic factors such as DC-derived cytokines, γδT cell-intrinsic factors also contribute to the differences in innate IL-17 secretion in B/c and B6 mice. The γδT-17 cells constituted a larger fraction of total γδT cells in B/c spleens compared with B6 spleens. A high percentage of γδT cells in the spleen of B6 mice were γδT-IFNγ as previously reported [ ]. There was a modest shift from Th1 to Th2 response upon B. pertussis infection in γδT cell-deficient mice compared with wild-type B6 mice [ ]. These experiments suggest that the early IFNγ secretion by γδT cells supports the development of a Th1 response in B6 mice.
In summary, we identified a significant difference in innate IFNγ and IL-17 secretion in response to B. pertussis in B/c and B6 mice. Although these observations were made with splenocytes stimulated ex vivo, it has been shown that activation of NK and γδT-17 cells provides the early control B. pertussis infection prior to the generation of adaptive Th1 and Th17 cells in B/c and B6 mice, respectively. These findings provide new insights into the immune response to B. pertussis and emphasize the importance of the choice of inbred mouse strain in pertussis research.
