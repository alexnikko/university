Introduction
Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is a rare immune disorder of infancy, characterized by a lack of antigen-specific T cell response and concurrent variable B cell function and lymphopenia. SCID syndromes are usually classified and diagnosed by either their genotype or cellular immunophenotype. Genotypes confer disease pathophysiology [cytokine signaling defects (i.e., JAK3 , IL2R ), dysfunctional rearrangements (i.e., RAG1 , RAG2 ), metabolic defects (i.e., ADA ), and so forth], yet require considerable genetic testing. Immunophenotype (T−, B+/−, NK+/−) enables rapid assumptive bottom-up diagnosis [ ]. The presence of dysfunctional T cells can be found in some “leaky” forms of SCID, such as Omenn syndrome or due to maternally engrafted T cells [ ]. Early hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been the mainstay of treatment for SCID, notwithstanding its caveats: rejection, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), poor B cell reconstitution with subsequent dependence on intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusions, morbidity, and mortality associated with pre-transplantation chemoablation. The need for conditioning in profound immunodeficiencies is debated—conditioning appeared necessary to achieve superior engraftment, yet it entails substantial adverse effects. Moreover, SCID is a unique HSCT indication in the sense that patients completely lacking T cell immunity may not demand myeloablation before the procedure, especially when human leukocyte antigen (HLA)–matched donors are available. However, a considerable number of patients receive HSCT from donors who are mismatched at some degree or have residual T cell immunity, thus warranting chemotherapeutic pre-transplantation conditioning and/or post-procedural GVHD prophylaxis [ ]. The donor’s compatibility to the recipient is the most important factor dictating the HSCT method and has a significant effect on overall survival. The multitude of variants affecting the transplantation procedure has produced a lack of consensus regarding optimal practice. Centers differ in many aspects of treatment: from their algorithm for donor choice, through their choice to condition (and if so—which protocol to use), to follow-up methods and duration [ ].
Immune reconstitution may be evaluated in several ways. Successful engraftment is assessed by lymphocyte chimerism and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in gender-mismatched transplants. It should be noted that full donor chimerism is not expected and probably not necessary [ ]. Quantification of immunoglobulins and characterization of lymphocyte subpopulations can further demonstrate immune recovery. In recent years, quantification of T cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) and kappa-deleting excision circles (KRECs) and analysis of the T cell receptor (TCR) and B cell receptor (BCR) repertoires have proven to be the most advanced assays for this purpose [ , , ]. TRECs and KRECs are circular episomal excision products of the T and B cell maturation in the thymus and bone marrow, respectively. A highly heterogeneous repertoire of lymphocyte receptors is created in these sites through the variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene rearrangement processes. In T cell maturation, V, D, and J segments are flanked by recombination signal sequences (RSSs), where recombination activating genes (RAGs) cleave the DNA. V(D)J exons with coding joints (CJs) join and continue transcription and translation into T cell receptors. The “leftover” DNA, fenced by two RSS, fuses to create a signal joint (SJ), thus producing an extrachromosomal circular excision product, a.k.a. SJ-TREC. In B cell maturation, a similar process occurs during the rearrangement of the kappa light chain. Both elements (hereinafter TRECs, KRECs) are stable, do not replicate, and therefore are renowned as markers for new lymphocyte output. Soon after identification, their quantification by means of real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) has been a part of SCID diagnosis, characterization, and treatment monitoring [ , , ].
In this study, we described and characterized the clinical and laboratorial immune reconstitution of our cohort, comprised of different genotypes and donor sources. We examined our data through the prism conditioning—a subgroup of seven unconditioned patients vs. ten conditioned ones.
Methods
Patients
Seventeen consecutive patients with SCID transplanted at the Sheba Medical Center (Tel HaShomer, Israel) between 2008 and 2015 were recruited to this study, after approval of their parents and the institutional review board. Diagnosis was based on clinical findings implying immunodeficiency, family history, immunological evaluation, and genetic testing. HLAs A, B, C, and DR were typed using serological or DNA hybridization methods in order to define donor–recipient compatibility. Patients with matched related donors (MRDs), no evidence of Omenn’s syndrome nor substantial maternal engraftment, were assigned for a procedure without conditioning. Patients who failed to fulfil the above underwent cytoreductive protocols. SCID genotype did not affect assignation.
Transplantation
Patients received the transplantation inhouse, at our hemato-oncology unit. Standard prophylactic medications consisted of trimethoprim/sulfametaxozole for Pneumocystis jiroveci (PCP), IVIG to maintain IgG level above 6 g/L, acyclovir in the occasion of donor–recipient serologic cytomegalovirus (CMV) disparity, and cyclosporine A (CSA) or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) for GVHD in conditioned patients. GVHD was graded between I and IV according to convention, and the acuteness chronicity limit defined at 100 days. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was given from the day of transplant until neutrophil counts were above 1.0 × 10 9 /L for three consecutive days. The HSCT infusion itself originated from either bone marrow, peripheral blood, or cord blood. Conditioning regimens were based on the European group for blood and marrow transplantation (EBMT) and European Society for Immunodeficiencies (ESID) guidelines for HSCT in PID [ ].
Engraftment and immunologic assessment
Neutrophil engraftment was defined after three consecutive days with an absolute count of over 0.5 × 10 9 /L. Lymphocyte engraftment and chimerism were evaluated mainly by analysis of microsatellite variable numbers of tandem repeats, or FISH studies using Y-specific probes in gender-mismatched couples.
Absolute numbers and percentages of lymphocytes were quantified by assessment of cell surface markers using immunofluorescent staining and flow cytometry (Epics V; Beckman Coulter, Hialeah, FL, USA) with antibodies purchased from Beckman Coulter. Serum immunoglobulin concentrations (IgG, IgM, IgA) were measured using standard nephelometry.
TREC and KREC quantifications were performed serially on genomic DNA extracted from patients’ peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and determined by RQ-PCR. RQ-PCR reactions were carried out in an Applied Biosystems™ StepOnePlus™, using TaqMan universal PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems™), specific primers, and FAM-TAMRA probes for TRECs and KRECs. Absolute levels in each sample were automatically calculated by comparing the cycle threshold (Ct) value to a validated standard curve. Age-matched healthy individuals were used as controls, amplification of RNAseP served as a quality control, and Ct thresholds were positioned at similar levels.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software for windows, version 22.0 by IBM. p values less than 0.05 on a two-sided test were considered statistically significant. Clinical parameter distributions were tested for normality by the Shapiro–Wilk test. The Mann–Whitney U test and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used for continuous variables with a non-normal distribution, and the relationship between categorical variables was evaluated using Fisher’s exact test, which was more appropriate than the χ 2 test due to the small sample size. Unless otherwise specified, values are given as mean ± standard deviation (SD).
Results
Patients
From a total of 17 patients, 16 manifested with classical SCID-associated symptoms, such as failure to thrive (FTT), recurrent fevers, and infections. Five patients displayed clinical manifestations of Omenn syndrome. Patient #3, benefitting from having an afflicted elder sibling who underwent genetic workup and HSCT, was diagnosed prenatally. Most patients (13/17) had a proven or presumptive family history of primary immunodeficiency, compatible with the high percentage of consanguinity found in our cohort. The mean age at diagnosis was suboptimal, at almost 6 months (range 0–16), with the unconditioned group being diagnosed significantly earlier than the conditioned one (3.3 ± 2.3 vs. 7.1 ± 4.4 months, respectively; p value < 0.05). Immunological evaluation was positive for disease in all patients— absolute and relative lymphocyte deficiencies and undetectable TRECs. Thorough genetic testing managed to discover the disease-causing mutation in 15/17. A consequent of the consanguinity mentioned above, 14 patients had autosomal recessive mutations—11 with RAG1/2 , 2 siblings with ADA , and 1 with a JAK3 mutation. One patient suffered from X-linked SCID (common γ chain deficiency), and the culprit mutations of the remaining two evaded our tests. Table 1 summarizes immunological evaluation at diagnosis.

Transplantation
Patients were retrospectively classified into two groups based solely on the presence or absence of pre-transplantation conditioning: group 1 consisted of seven patients who did not receive conditioning (patients 1–7) and ten patients who did receive (patients 8–17). The choice whether to opt a conditioning or unconditioning protocol was based on SCID type, available donor, presence of Omenn syndrome or maternal engraftment, patient performance status, age, and future access to IVIG. Overall, the mean age at transplantation of the cohort was 252 days (range 61–657), a dissatisfactory fact, explained by the rather late age of diagnosis noted above. The entire unconditioned groups’ donors were MRDs—mostly siblings, but also two mothers and a cousin. Five of seven grafts were from bone marrow, one from maternal peripheral blood, and one from the cord blood of a newly born sibling. The conditioned group varied much more—five haplo donors, two MUDs, and three patients who underwent conditioning even though an MRD was available—due to Omenn syndrome, old age, and advanced disease. In accordance with the higher donor age, more grafts (six of ten) were from peripheral blood, three from bone marrow, and one from cord blood.
Conditioning was done by a variety of regimens. As described, GVHD prophylaxis, when used, was based mainly on CSA. MMF and corticosteroids were added when GVHD was suspected or diagnosed. Acute and chronic GVHD appeared only in conditioned patients, all of which received adequate prophylaxis. Febrile episodes were also slightly more prevalent in this group. Table 2 summarizes the clinical and genetic features of the patients pre-HSCT. Characteristics of the HSCT procedures and their complications are depicted in Table 3 . Despite physical and pharmacological measures, viral and/or bacterial infections complicated all patients post-HSCT. Quite uniquely to our cohort is the fact that 13/17 received the Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine postnatally, before their diagnosis. Consequentially, nine developed local or disseminated BCG infections (“BCGitis”) and were treated effectively with anti-mycobacterial regimen which included rifampin, isoniazid, and ethambutol.

Immune reconstitution
Comparison of pre- vs. post-transplant lymphocyte subsets demonstrates quantitative improvement, with limited clinical correlation. Lymphopenia (defined as an ALC < 2500) was exhibited by 13/17 patients (76%) beforehand, and in 9/15 (60%) at end of follow-up, with conditioned patients less lymphopenic than unconditioned ones ( p value < 0.05). CD3 cell was initially deficient (CD3 < 1000) in 12/17 (71%), a percentage later improving to 33% (5/15). A few factors confound pre-transplant T cell numbers—concurrent infections causing lymphocytosis, Omenn phenotype, and maternal engraftment. As of CD20 counts, all B− patients were deficient (CD20 < 250) before transplantation, improving later in 4 patients (9/13, 69%), again, all from the conditioned group ( p value < 0.05).
Pre-transplant TREC levels were, by definition, undetectable or insignificant in all patients. Levels were serially quantified along the follow-up, showing gradual and steady increases. Out of 15 live patients, 10 returned to what we consider normal TREC values (> 400 copies) by the study’s end, without a statistically significant difference between groups. On average, conditioned patients demonstrated a faster incline in TREC levels compared with unconditioned ones and reached higher endpoint levels (1605 ± 1351.3 vs. 620.8 ± 990.9 copies). Yet, the unconditioned group showed an earlier presence of TRECs when compared during the first 4 months post-HSCT (25.6 ± 60.3 vs. 59.3 ± 78.6 copies), though trends soon decussated in the following quadrimester (283.8 ± 408.8 vs. 653.6 ± 946.2 copies). As anticipated, high TRECs had a positive predictive value concerning prognosis, though the opposite is less evident. Figure 1 demonstrates TREC dynamics along the follow-up. Fig. 1 TREC levels in the conditioned group and the unconditioned group along three quadrimesters in the post-transplant year. TRECs were serially checked along the follow-up. The unconditioned group showed an earlier presence of TRECs immediately after transplantation (59.3 ± 78.6 vs. 25.6 ± 60.3 copies), though trends soon decussated in the following quadrimester (283.8 ± 408.8 vs. 653.6 ± 946.2 copies), eventually reaching higher endpoint levels in the conditioned group (620.8 ± 990.9 vs. 1605 ± 1351.3 copies). High TRECs had a positive predictive value concerning prognosis, though the opposite is less evident
Two factors influenced analyses of KRECs. First, KRECS were not part of the regular post-transplant workup, but rather conducted retrospectively on available specimens. Second, patients who initially had B+ SCIDs (#3 and #13) must be distinguished from the latter B− patients. Overall, the unconditioned cohort’s KREC levels varied between undetectable to low (15.8 ± 33.1 copies), coinciding with their categorical dependency on IVIG infusion at the end of follow-up (7/7). In the conditioned group, KRECs were satisfactory in most patients (1439.3 ± 1511.4 copies, p value < 0.01). Two of eight relied on IVIG— patient #10 who indeed had unsatisfactory KRECs and patient #15 whose specimens were unavailable for testing. Conditioned patients had a higher chance of being IVIG independent at the end of their follow-up ( p value < 0.01). Table 4 summarizes patients’ basic cell-mediated and humoral immune reconstitution.

Long term follow-up and clinical outcomes
Mean follow-up for the entire cohort was 355 days from HSCT, ranging from 18 to 511 days. Overall survival was excellent (88%). Although the aim of this study was to follow patients for the year after their HSCT, 14 of them are still observed periodically at the PID and/or the hemato-oncology clinics at our institution and are alive and well, some over 9 years past their procedure. Patients #7 and #12 unfortunately died soon after their HSCTs—the former from septic shock 6 months post her transplant and the latter from early HSCT complications, just days after his procedure. Patient #3 was lost to follow-up at our hospital but is known to be in satisfactory condition.
As expected, the engraftment as portrayed by lymphocyte microsatellites and FISH followed opposite trends between groups (Fig. 2 ). Unconditioned patients’ engraftment began from near 0% and raised steadily, eventually reaching a mean of 30% (range 4–68%) at the end of follow-up. Conditioned patients began from full engraftment (kept by 5/10) and lost by the remaining who declined to values averaging 34% (range 5–69%). Engraftment chimerism did not correlate with clinical outcomes, corroborating the notion that full engraftment is not necessarily an important goal. It is imperative to note that due to differences in the follow-up technique between patients, we used FISH and microsatellite percentages interchangeably, acknowledging that only subtle differences occur between their results [ ]. Table 5 summarizes and compares various parameters between the groups. Fig. 2 Average donor lymphocyte chimerism in the post-HSCT year. Donor lymphocyte engraftment was assessed interchangeably by microsatellite or FISH studies. Averages of each group are depicted above. The conditioned group began from full engraftment (kept by half), slowly declining to an average of 75% (range 5–100%). The unconditioned group began from near 0%, slowly inclining to average 30% (range 4–68%). Engraftment did not correlate with clinical outcomes Table 5 Comparison of various immunological and clinical factors between the conditioned and the unconditioned group Criteria Unconditioned Conditioned p value Total Number Sum Percent Number Sum Percent Number Sum Percent Pre-BMT Total patients 7 – – 10 – – – 17 – – Age at diagnosis (months) 3.3 – – 7.1 – – < 0.05 5.5 – – Age at HSCT (months) 5.9 – – 10.2 – – NS 8.4 – – B cell negative 6 7 86% 9 10 90% – 15 17 88% ALC < 2500 7 7 100% 6 10 60% NS 13 17 76% CD3 < 1000 7 7 100% 5 10 50% < 0.05 12 17 71% CD20 < 250 a 6 6 100% 9 9 100% NS 15 15 100% TREC < 400 0 7 0% 0 9 0% NS 0 16 0% Mode of transplant Donor type (MRD/MMRD/MUD) 7 0 0 3 5 2 – 10 5 2 Graft (PB/CB/BM) 1 1 5 6 1 3 – 7 2 8 GVHD prophylaxis 5 7 71% 9 9 100% – 14 16 88% End of follow-up Acute GVHD 0 7 0% 4 9 44% NS 4 16 25% Chronic GVHD 0 7 0% 2 9 22% NS 2 16 13% Febrile episodes b 6 7 86% 8 9 89% NS 14 16 88% BCGitis c 5 5 100% 4 6 67% NS 9 11 82% ALC < 2500 6 6 100% 3 9 33% < 0.05 9 15 60% CD3 < 1000 3 6 50% 2 9 22% NS 5 15 33% CD20 < 250 a 5 5 100% 4 8 50% < 0.05 9 13 69% TREC < 400 3 6 50% 2 9 22% NS 5 15 33% KRECs a (copies) 15.8 5 – 1439.3 6 – < 0.01 792.3 11 – IVIG dependency a 6 6 100% 2 8 25% < 0.01 8 15 53% Chimerism 7 – 29% 10 – 67% NS 17 – 51% Alive and well 6 7 86% 9 10 90% NS 15 17 88% ALC absolute lymphocyte count, BCG Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (vaccine), HSCT hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, CB cord blood, GVHD graft vs. host disease, IVIG intravenous immunoglobulin, KREC kappa-deleting recombination excision circles, MMRD mismatched related donor, MRD matched related donor, MUD matched unrelated donor, NS not significant, PB peripheral blood, TREC T cell recombination excision circles a B cell–negative patients only b Patients with one or more febrile episodes, excluding patient #12 who died soon after transplant c Excluding patients who did not receive the BCG vaccine
Discussion
SCID, the most severe type of congenital immunodeficiency, is curable by HSCT. The use of conditioning before HSCT for SCID and its effect on long-term outcome remains controversial and is a subject which calls for continuing research [ , ]. Herein, we described 17 patients with SCID who underwent HSCT with or without conditioning at our center.
Overall 1-year survival rate in our cohort, regardless of the presence or absence of pre-transplantation conditioning, was excellent (88%). This is similar to results obtained from several large single or multicenter studies comparing survival in SCID after HSCT, probably attributed to our high percent of MRDs (10/17 patients). The use of matched related and unrelated donors (including cord blood) whenever possible and limiting the use of mismatched haploidentical donors are well-accepted approaches now [ ]. Our results when using mismatched haploidentical donors were satisfactory, and only one such recipient deceased [ , ].
Donor compatibility is a factor of paramount importance, but still second to prompt diagnosis and treatment. In their multicenter study, Pai et al. have shown that survival rates are similar among infants who received transplants at 3.5 months of age or younger (94%) and among older infants without prior infection (90%) or with a resolved infection (82%), regardless of donor type [ ]. The late diagnosis and HSCT timing (averaging 5.9 and 10.2 months, respectively) of our patients is an issue that demands introspection and action. In the era of newborn screening, diagnosis must precede clinical manifestations and transplant should occur at the recommended age of 3.5 months [ ]. The whole group was diagnosed and treated before 2016, when the Israeli national newborn screening program began to implement TREC quantification as a method for early recognition of T cell–deficient SCIDs. Reports from other countries, along with preliminary data from Israel, make it safe to assume that the screening program will substantially shorten the intervals from birth to diagnosis and diagnosis to transplant [ , ]. Yet, a large portion of our patients come from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, a fact that has significant medical impacts. First, there is no newborn screening there. Second, Palestinian neonates receive the BCG vaccine at birth, known to cause a very high complication rate in patients with SCID. Therefore, until the establishment of newborn screening for SCID there, and in the absence of a safer vaccine, this routine vaccination should be postponed, particularly when family history indicates former PIDs [ ].
Another aspect in which our cohort differs from traditional cohorts is genetically. As noted, at least 82% of our patients had autosomal recessive SCID variants, with the T−B−NK+ phenotype comprising the majority and the RAG1/2 genotype being the largest subset. This is quite consistent with data from regional and nationwide studies, reflecting both the high level of consanguinity in our patient population (autosomal recessive > X-linked), and the “founder effect,” influencing which of the autosomal recessive mutations is the prevalent one (e.g., RAG1/2 > ADA ) [ , ]. Several conclusions concerning treatment and prognosis may be drawn from this fact. The first involves finding an MRD—most patients with SCID must settle for an alternative donor source, as only about 20% have an available one. Contrarily, in highly consanguineous populations, there is a higher chance of finding a next of kin who is an MRD [ ]. Indeed, almost 60% of our patients received HSCTs from MRDs. The second regards B cell engraftment, as our cohort was relatively abundant in B cell–deficient patients. The molecular type of SCID is the main factor that influences B cell reconstitution. Host B cell function may normalize even without conditioning, particularly in B+ patients. While conditioning does not guarantee B cell engraftment and function, it does significantly improve the chance that it will occur [ , ]. All our B− unconditioned patients (six of six) remained dependent on IVIG at the end of follow-up, despite receiving transplants from MRDs. Sixty-seven percent (four of six) of our B− conditioned patients regained enough B cell function to stop routine IVIG infusions. Data from a study by Heimall et al., where 47% of conditioned vs. 14% of unconditioned were off IVIG at 1-year post-transplant, also supports this concept [ ]. To our patients, this brings forth another consideration when contemplating which transplantation regimen to conduct—accessibility to centers that provide IVIG therapy. In patients whose compliance and access to IVIG is expected to be limited, the tension between better B cell engraftment and a riskier transplantation may be shifted towards the latter.
Appropriate immune reconstitution is a major contributor to long-term quality of life in patients with SCID after HSCT. A myriad of quantitative and qualitative tests have been suggested for the follow-up of transplantees, and no specific battery has been proven superior. We, and others, have successfully used TRECs and KRECs as markers for T and B cell immune reconstitution and as predictors for post-transplant morbidity and mortality [ , ]. Here, TRECs were an excellent mean of diagnosis and follow-up. Attaining normal levels (> 400) was concordant with a favorable outcome in all cases. The opposite may not be concluded, as several well-recovering patients had suboptimal TREC levels at the end of their follow-up. In the first quadrimester, unconditioned recipients exhibited higher TREC levels than conditioned ones. From that point until the end of follow-up, the conditioned group’s TRECs were superior. KRECs were not followed in a sequential manner; therefore, their predictive value was not assessed. Yet, the correlation between sufficient KREC levels and independency from IVIG in our study, and their proved role as heralds of B cell function, may promote their use as early markers for beginning IVIG weaning [ ].
Engraftment chimerism trends were opposite between groups. Patients after chemoablation began from full chimerism, some maintaining it and some transiting into mixed chimerism. On the other hand, unconditioned patients began from null, developing engraftment with time. The exact desired donor engraftment is not defined, but both groups managed to average > 10% chimerism (deemed sufficient by some sources [ ]), and most importantly were free of significant infections. We assume that lineage-specific chimerism is much more important than the general chimerism, as depicted by the fact that some patients with low total chimerism eventually displayed sufficient TRECs, still resulting in a better clinical outcome. In recent years, advanced assays (such as TRECs, KRECs, TCR repertoire) brought the advantage of quantitative and qualitative evaluation of immune recuperation and lessened the role of chimerism studies in long-term follow-up [ ].
To summarize, we studied a cohort of severely immunodeficient patients who underwent life-saving medical procedures. Though differing in laboratorial and clinical data, we showed excellent outcomes with both treatment methodologies and debated the pros and cons of their application. The small cohort, together with the differences in genotypes, ages, donor types, and procedures, limitations of the study, withholding deduction of significant statistical conclusions. Nevertheless, the study contributes to the body of knowledge concerning the treatment of SCID and to the support of TRECs and KRECs as surrogates of immune reconstitution and tailored therapy. Concerning the dilemmas featured by most of our patients—consanguinity, BCGitis, accessibility, etc.—the study delineates important considerations. Furthermore, it reiterates the importance of newborn screening and obtaining family history as secondary preventive measures—granting early diagnosis as well as averting opportunistic and vaccine-related infections.
