Introduction
The global upsurge in the prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) has remained a key health threat with significant economic burden (Bakirel et al. ). While DM is on the increase in the developing countries, it has assumed an epidemic state in industrialized nations, with the type 2 form accounting for over 90% of reported cases (Abdulazeez and Ponnusam ). With this report, more than 12% (727 billion dollars) of the global health expenditure is currently spent on the disease and about 552 million people of the world’s population are estimated to be diabetic by the year 2030, if no practical solution is sought (IDF ).
Besides lifestyle abuses, free radicals and reactive oxygen species-mediated oxidative stress are also fundamental to the pathogenesis of DM (Sabiu and Ashafa ). Although the conventional oral hypoglycemic drugs have been effective in the treatment and management of DM, high cost and significant adverse effects have undermined their usage. Little wonder, new and emerging evidence-based phytotherapeutic studies geared towards diabetes management are now exploring more affordable and easily accessible natural plant formulations endowed with reasonable antioxidant attributes (Gull et al. ; Ghosh et al. ). Such studies are not only envisaged to pave ways for a new therapeutic strategy for diabetes treatment and its related complications (Mendes et al. ; Sabiu et al. ) but would also offer safer and less expensive adaptogenic biological agents that would ultimately improve the quality of life of diabetic patients (Ray et al. ). This is the case with the Solanaceae family, with most of its members potentiating significant anti-hyperglycaemic activity (Gupta et al. ; Poongothai et al. ).
Solanum incanum L (SI) also called sodom/bitter apple/garden egg belongs to the family Solanaceae (Schmelzer and Gurib-Fakim ). It is an erect or spreading perennial herb/shrub of about 1.8 m, with occasional spines on the leaves and stems, and velvet haired leaves (Sambo et al. ). The berry fruits are about 2–3 cm in diameter and are initially yellowish but later turn black (Matu ; Sambo et al. ). SI grows freely in the Middle and Far East Asia and many regions of Africa including Nigeria (Mwonjoria et al. ). Its therapeutic significance as anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, antimicrobial, antinociceptive, antipyretic, and spasmolytic agents have been documented (Assefa et al. ; Taye et al. ; Alamri and Moustafa ). It is an ethnomedicinally valued vegetable for treating several ailments including diabetes. Although its fruit extracts have been studied to elicit good in vivo hypoglycemic potential (Musabayane et al. ; Uchenna et al. ), information on its tentative mechanism is lacking till date. Hence, this study investigated its probable mechanisms of hypoglycemic activity against Saccharomyces cerevisiae glucose uptake and the activities of prominent enzymes (α-glucosidase and α-amylase) linked to carbohydrate metabolism. The study also evaluated its chemical profiling, membrane stabilization, and antioxidant potentials.
Methodology
Sample collection and authentication
Healthy fruits of Solanum incanum were purchased from a local vendor at Ilorin, Nigeria. They were identified at the Herbarium unit, University of Ilorin, Nigeria, by Mr. Bolu Ajayi, and a reference number (UILH/002/1045) was issued for its voucher specimen that was subsequently deposited for future reference.
Extract preparation
The fruits of SI were thoroughly washed with distilled H 2 O, chopped, and air-dried to constant weight. This was then powdered and a portion (100 g) of it was suspended in 1000 mL of distilled H 2 O for 24 h under constant agitation. Using Whatman No. 1 filter paper, the resulting mixture was filtered and subsequently lyophilized (40 °C). The extract obtained (SIAE) was kept airtight and refrigerated before use.
Reagents and chemicals
The 1,1-diphenyl-2 picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast), acarbose, porcine pancreatic α-amylase, rat intestine acetone powder (RIAP), and para-nitrophenyl-glucopyranoside (pNPG) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, USA. Soluble starch (extra pure) and dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) were products of J. T. Baker Inc., USA, while other reagents and chemicals used were of good analytical standard.
In vitro radical scavenging assays
DPPH assay
In this assay, a previously reported method (Turkoglu et al. ) was adopted in evaluating the capability of SIAE to scavenge DPPH free radicals using silymarin as standard. The inhibitory ability (I%) of SIAE on DPPH radical was then calculated and the concentration of SIAE produced 50% inhibitory (IC 50 ) effect extrapolated from a standard curve.
Hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical (OH−) inhibitory potential
The reported procedures of Ruch et al. ( ), and Smirnoff and Cumbes ( ) were respectively used for the determination of the H 2 O 2 and OH − radicals-scavenging potential of SIAE. While silymarin served as standard, sterile distilled H 2 O 2 replaced SIAE and served as control in each case. The IC 50 values were also calculated from the calibration graph.
Lipid peroxidation assay
In this experiment, the capability of SIAE to halt generation of lipid peroxide in an egg yolk homogenate as described by Oyedemi et al. ( ) was adapted. Distilled H 2 O was used as blank and silymarin as reference standard.
Membrane stabilization activity
Bovine erythrocyte suspension preparation and heat-induced hemolysis assay
A modified procedure of Oyedapo et al. ( ) was employed in this assay. Bovine whole blood was taken in EDTA-coated tubes and centrifuged (10 min, 3000 rpm). The plasma and leucocytes (supernatant) was removed, while the pellet (packed erythrocytes) was carefully rinsed severally with a solution containing NaCl (154 mM) prepared in sodium phosphate buffer (10 mM, pH 7.4) and recentrifuged (10 min, 3000 rpm) to have a clear supernatant. Subsequently, the final pellet obtained was used in the preparation of the stock suspension (2% v / v ) of red blood cells (erythrocytes) used in this assay.
For the assay, an isotonic buffer (4.5 mL) containing either SIAE (0.25–2.0 mg mL −1 ; 0.5 mL) or ibuprofen (0.1 mg mL −1 ; 0.5 mL) was put into two sets of centrifuge tubes. For the control, 5.0 mL of distilled H 2 O was kept in another tube. Thereafter, 0.5 mL of the erythrocyte stock suspension was introduced into each tube and vortexed by inversion. While a set of the tube was maintained on ice bath (0–5 °C), the second set was kept in a water bath (54 °C, 20 min). Following this, each set up was centrifuged (5 min, 3000 rpm,) prior to spectrophotometric absorbance reading (540 nm) of the hemoglobin liberated into the supernatant. The % protection conferred by SIAE against hemolysis of the erythrocyte in the test sample was thereafter evaluated from the expression: $$ \%\mathrm{protection}\ \mathrm{offered}\ \mathrm{on}\ \mathrm{erythrocyte}\ \mathrm{against}\ \mathrm{hemolysis}=\left({A}_{\mathrm{H}}\hbox{--} {A}_{\mathrm{U}}/{A}_{\mathrm{c}}\hbox{--} {A}_{\mathrm{U}}\right)\times 100. $$ A c , A H , and A u represent the respective absorbance readings of the heated sample (control), heated test sample, and unheated test sample.
Hypoglycemic studies
In vitro glucose uptake modulatory assay
The S. cerevisiae used in this study was made in accordance with an earlier reported procedure (Gupta et al. ). Briefly, 2 g of S. cerevisiae was continuously rinsed under centrifugation (4200 rpm) in sterile distilled H 2 O to have a reasonably clear supernatant. Thereafter, a suspension of the yeast cell (10% v / v ) was prepared in distilled H 2 O to serve as stock. Various concentrations (1.0–5.0 mg) of SIAE were mixed with 2 mL each of glucose solutions (5.0–25.0 mmol/L) in different tubes prior to incubation (10 min, 37 °C). Following this, 200 μL of the yeast suspension was mixed with the resulting content in the tube for reaction initiation. This was then thoroughly mixed and incubated (60 min, 37 °C). Finally, the reaction mixtures were centrifuged (5 min, 3800 rpm) and the supernatant obtained in each case was spectrophotometrically measured (515 nm) as the concentration of glucose in each tube. The increase in the uptake of glucose by S. cerevisiae at each SIAE concentration was then evaluated from the expression: $$ \%\mathrm{Increase}\ \mathrm{in}\ \mathrm{uptake}\ \mathrm{of}\ \mathrm{glucose}=100\times \left[\left({\mathrm{Abs}}_{\mathrm{control}}\hbox{--} {\mathrm{Abs}}_{\mathrm{sample}}\right)/{\mathrm{Abs}}_{\mathrm{control}}\right]. $$ Abs sample and Abs control respectively represent the absorbance of the sample (test) and that of the control (comprising all the reagents save the sample (test)).
Carbohydrate-metabolizing enzymes’ inhibitory studies
Alpha-amylase inhibitory assay
This involves preparation of stock solutions of 0.25–10.0 mg/mL of either SIAE or acarbose (standard) in distilled H 2 O. From the stocks, 500 μL each was added to 500 μL of 0.5 mg/mL of ice-cold solution of porcine pancreatic α-amylase in sodium phosphate buffer (0.02 M, pH 6.9) and incubated (10 min, 25 °C). Subsequently, 500 μL of starch (1%) solution in sodium phosphate buffer (0.02 M, pH 6.9) was introduced prior to further incubation (10 min, 25 °C). DNS (1.0 mL) was added to halt the reaction and the content was heated (5 min, 100 °C), completely cooled (25 °C) and 15.0 mL of sterile distilled H 2 O was added prior to absorbance reading (540 nm). The control contained the buffer (500 μL) instead of SIAE and the experiments were replicated three times. The inhibitory potential of SIAE on alpha-amylase was then calculated and presented as % from: $$ \mathrm{Inhibitory}\ \mathrm{effect}\ \left(\%\right)=100\times \left[\left(\Delta {A}_{\mathrm{control}}\hbox{--} \Delta {A}_{\mathrm{extract}}\right)/\Delta {A}_{\mathrm{control}}\right]. $$ ∆ A extract and ∆ A control are the respective changes in absorbance of the SIAE and control. The IC 50 value of SIAE against alpha-amylase was thereafter calculated using calibration plot (Mohamed et al. ).
To determine the kinetics parameters of the inhibitory effect of SIAE against the activity of α-amylase, 100 μL of either the extract (at it IC 50 ) or sodium phosphate buffer (0.02 M, pH 6.9) was incubated (10 min, 25 °C) with α-amylase solution (100 μL) in two sets of test tubes. Following this, starch (0.3–5.0 mg/mL) corresponding to substrate ( S ) was introduced into both sets of tubes for the reaction to start. Finally, the resulting solution in each case was further treated with DNS (100 μL), boiled (5 min, 100 °C), cooled (25 °C) and diluted with sterile distilled H 2 O. The absorbance of the released sugar was then taken (540 nm), values estimated from maltose standard curve and subsequently expressed as reaction rates ( v ). The kinetic indices ( K m and V max values) and the tentative mechanism of inhibitory action of SIAE on alpha-amylase activity were then deduced (Lineweaver and Burk ).
Alpha-glucosidase inhibitory assay
The solution of alpha-glucosidase used was prepared as earlier reported (Oki et al. ). This was done by homogenizing 25.0 mg/mL of RIAP in ice-cold phosphate buffer (50 mM) followed by centrifugation (6000× g , 15 min). The resulting clear supernatant represents alpha-glucosidase solution. For the assay, the procedure of Elsnoussi et al. ( ) was used. Briefly, 0.25–10.0 mg/mL of either SIAE or acarbose were prepared and 50 μL from each stock solution was introduced into 1.0 M of alpha-glucosidase solution (100 μL) prepared in phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 6.9). This was then incubated (10 min, 25 °C) in 96-well plates prior to the addition of 50 μL of 5 mM p NPG solution (made in phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 6.9)). The resulting solutions were further incubated (5 min, 25 °C) and the absorbance in each case was read (405 nm) in a micro-plate reader. The values obtained were compared with that of the control which had 50 μL of the buffer in place of SIAE. The inhibitory potential of SIAE on the alpha-glucosidase activity was calculated and the IC 50 was subsequently determined from the standard calibration curve.
To further determine the inhibitory kinetics of SIAE on activity of α-glucosidase, 50 μL of either SIAE at its IC 50 value or phosphate buffer (pH 6.9) was pre-incubated (10 min, 25 °C) with solutions of alpha-glucosidase (100 μL) in two sets of tubes. Subsequently, 50 μL each of 0.63–2.0 mg/mL ( p NPG) was introduced into the two set-ups for reaction initiation before allowing an incubation period of 10 min at 25 °C. To halt the reaction, Na 2 CO 3 (500 μL) was added and the released sugar in each case was colorimetrically estimated from para-nitrophenol calibration curve. The reaction rates ( v ) were then estimated and Lineweaver-Burk double reciprocal plot was used to predict the nature of inhibition of the enzyme by SIAE.
Phytoconstituent analysis of SIAE using GC-MS
The Agilent Technologies GC systems with GC-7890A/MS-5975C model (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with HP-5MS column (30 m in length × 250 μm in diameter × 0.25 μm in thickness of film) was used in the analysis. The concentration of the individual constituent in SIAE was presented as % on the basis of the peak area in the chromatogram. For their identification, matching of their characteristic features with the different components in the NIST library was used.
Statistical evaluation
Except otherwise stated, data were processed by one-way analysis of variance complemented with Duncan’s Multiple Range Test using SPSS software package for windows V16.0. Results are represented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) of triplicate determinations. At a p < 0.05 confidence level, the values of the mean were considered statistically significant.

Mechanisms of hypoglycemic potential of SIAE
The glucose uptake modulatory activity of SIAE on S. cerevisiae revealed a concentration-dependent effect and reduced as glucose concentration increases (Fig. 1 ). At 5 mg SIAE, maximum activity was observed across all the glucose concentrations with the most prominent effect (89.35%) elicited in the presence of 5 mM glucose treatment (Fig. 1 ). Fig. 1 Glucose uptake modulatory effect of aqueous fruit extract of S. incanum (SIAE) on Saccharomyces cerevisiae
Table 3 shows the inhibitory potential of SIAE on the activities of alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase. When compared with SIAE (IC 50 : 7.08 mg/mL), the standard (acarbose) elicited the best inhibitory ability (IC 50 : 5.59 mg/mL) against alpha-amylase activity. A probe into the elucidation of its kinetics showed a reduction in both the values of K m and V max relative to the control (Fig. 2 ). The respective values for the Vmax and Km for the control were 0.04 μM/min and 0.0012 mg as against 0.02 μM/min and 0.0006 mg for SIAE, thus indicating an uncompetitive inhibitory action (Fig. 2 ). On the contrary however, SIAE had the most potent (IC 50 : 2.98 mg/mL) inhibitory effect ( p < 0.05) on alpha-glucosidase activity relative to that of acarbose (IC 50 : 4.93 mg/mL) (Table 3 ) and further investigation into its mode of inhibitory influence on the enzyme revealed a competitive type of inhibition (Fig. 3 ). By this, the V max value (0.03 μM/min) remained constant for both the control and SIAE, while the K m values increased from 0.001 mg for the control to 0.002 mg for the extract (Fig. 3 ).

Compounds belonging to flavonoids (kaempferol, quercetine), carotenoids (lycopene), alkaloids (nicotine, scopolamine, atropine), and saponin (solanin, solanine, solanidine, agamenoside A) were identified as the main constituents of SIAE as revealed from the results of GC/MS analysis conducted (Fig. 4 and Table 4 ).

Discussion
The global efforts on the search for novel therapeutic agents for the management of DM have advanced relentlessly. A good number of such efforts have been on the use of herbal medicines with significant hypoglycemic effect (Musabayane et al. ; Sabiu et al. ). Recently, research have not only been conducted on the antidiabetic effect of plants using different experimental models, but further investigations into their tentative mechanism(s) of action have been in the forefront (Gupta et al. ; Sabiu and Ashafa ). For instance, the probing into the manner of glucose transport across the membrane of S. cerevisiae has been receiving attention as a reliable and suitable in vitro method to evaluate hypoglycemic effect of taxa. The transport of glucose across the membrane of S. cerevisiae is extremely complex and facilitated by diffusion. However, the effective and efficient removal of intracellular glucose by a suitable agent makes it a coveted model of interest and the glucose concentration left in the system after a particular period is indicative of the glucose uptake by S. cerevisiae (Teusink et al. ). In this study, the observed dose-dependent increase in the % inhibition of glucose uptake in S. cerevisiae subsequent to the increased concentration of SIAE is a probable indication of the hypoglycemic potential of the extract. This may also imply that the extract is endowed with phytoconstituents that could either effectively modulate or regulate removal of intracellular glucose which is a key regulatory mechanism in diabetes. The effect elicited by SIAE in this respect agrees with earlier reports (Gupta et al. ; Karpagasundari and Kulothungan ), where the authors demonstrated the respective significant glucose uptake inhibitory potential of the extracts of Bauhinia purpurea Linn and Physalis minima on yeast cells.
Similarly, of the carbohydrates-metabolizing enzymes, alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase represent the main pharmacological targets in the management of DM (Krentz and Bailey ). These enzymes facilitate hydrolysis of starch to glucose with consequential increase in the systemic concentration of glucose in diabetes. This increased hyperglycemia may constitute a significant risk factor for complications associated with oxidative stress-mediated DM (Kim et al. ). Hence, targeting to inhibit the specific activities of these enzymes has been identified as another viable mechanism to delay glucose absorption and modulate hyperglycemia (Sabiu et al. ). Conventionally, the use of oral hypoglycemic agents have been the therapeutic measure employed to lower blood glucose level, however, the associated unpleasant consequences have undermined their application (Sabiu and Ashafa ). Conversely, emerging findings suggest a shift to the development of safer and more effective antidiabetic herbal remedies with lesser side effects (Elsnoussi et al. ; Sabiu et al. ). In this study, judging by the IC 50 values of SIAE relative to that of the acarbose, it may be logically inferred that the extract potentiated milder action on alpha-amylase activity than alpha-glucosidase and this has been therapeutically identified to be significant in annihilating the adverse effects consistent with the conventional inhibitors of the two enzymes (Shai et al. ). This observation implies that the extract is a probable pharmacologically potent inhibitor of carbohydrate metabolizing enzymes and agrees with previous submission (Kwon et al. ). The reduction in the values of K m and V max for the extract (predicting its uncompetitive modulatory action on the activity of alpha-amylase) may suggest a higher affinity of the enzyme for SIAE than the substrate, thereby strategically regulating further hydrolysis of systemic carbohydrate. Furthermore, the competitively inhibited activity of the α-glucosidase is indicative of a stronger structural resemblance of the major constituent of the extract to that of the substrate. This favorably facilitated the binding of the extract on the enzyme’s active site at the expense of the substrate. As a result, the rate of starch hydrolysis to free glucose is either effectively reduced or abolished.
For decades, the relationship between free radicals generation and the pathogenesis of DM and its associated risk disorders has been established (Scartezzini and Speroni ; Modak et al. ). In the present study, SIAE elicited marked antioxidant activities as evident from its IC 50 values when compared with those of silymarin. This observation may be suggestive of the tendency of the extract to either regulate or stall free radicals chain reactions associated with diabetes complications. Apart from being consistent with previous in vitro studies (Sabu and Kuttan ; Sabiu et al. ), the submission from this study is also in agreement with earlier findings (Scartezzini and Speroni ; Panda and Kar ), where plant-derived antioxidants proved effective in treating DM in vivo. Furthermore, plants endowed with significant antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potentials have also been shown to annihilate deleterious effect of lysosomal enzymes and facilitate membrane stabilization (Amujoyegbe et al. ). Judging by the results of the membrane stabilization potential of SIAE, it may be logically inferred that, SIAE at 2.0 mg/mL conferred marked stabilization potential (86.67%) on the RBC against hemolysis. Such effect might either be adduced to the influence of SIAE to adhere to the erythrocyte membrane to prevent deleterious attacks on the membrane and promote dispersion of ions as normally observed in erythrocyte hemolysis. This potential of SIAE may be considered significant and supportive of its antioxidant effect that may provide further protection against free radicals-mediated β-cell injury, which by effect aided its regulatory capability on both glucose uptake by yeast cells and the specific activities of alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase.
Plants with adaptogenic effect are rich source of complex phenolics or tetracyclic triterpenoids/steroids, which have multiple biological effects, including antioxidant and hypoglycemic activities (Abdelmoaty et al. ). Hence, the overall effects elicited by SIAE in the present report could be attributed to its phytonutrients with established bioactivities as revealed by the GC-MS data. Besides the antioxidant attributes of these phytoconstituents, the significant hypoglycemic effects of quercetin, luteolin, kaempferol, apigenin, cinnamic acid and capsaicin to improve insulin sensitivity, inhibit alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase activity, and regenerate pancreatic β-cells have been reported (Panda and Kar ; Abdelmoaty et al. ; Guo et al. ; Zhang et al. ). The marked influence of lycopene in ameliorating inflammatory response and oxidative stress linked to antidiabetic nephropathy has also been documented (Guo et al. ). Additionally, the identification and grouping of the other compounds as either alkaloids or saponins could further support the hypoglycemic potential of the extract. For instance, while alkaloids are known to enhance improved glycemic control (Shukla et al. ), the normalization of hemostatic imbalance and amelioration of oxidative stress in experimental animals have been associated with antidiabetic properties of saponins (El Barky and Hussein ). The overall synergistic effects of these adaptogenic phytonutrients in the fruit extract of SI might justify its medicinal property as a viable antidiabetic candidate.
Conclusion
The findings from this study have shown S. inacanum fruit aqueous extract as a potent antioxidant with significant membrane stabilization and hypoglycemic activities. This has not only lent credence to its folkloric usage but also suggested antioxidant, glucose uptake modulation, and carbohydrate-metabolizing enzymes’ inhibition as its tentative mechanisms of hypoglycemic action.
