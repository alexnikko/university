Background
Esophageal cancer is the eighth most common cancer worldwide, with nearly 145,000 new cases diagnosed in 2012. Overall the incidence remains highest in Eastern Asia and lowest in Western Africa [ ]. There has been a rapid increase in incidence of esophageal cancer in India and a wide variation across major regions (Males 6.3-10.3/100000; Females 2.6-7/100000) [ ]. Total new cases detected in India in 2012 were 27,152 in men (7th most common cancer) and 14,622 in women (6th most common cancer) [ ]. Together with prostate, liver and lung cancer; it is the leading cause of cancer related mortality across the globe, causing more than 400,000 deaths per year [ , ].
The management of esophageal cancer is still evolving. The role of preoperative chemoradiation and chemotherapy has been debated for several years. Most of the earlier randomized trials failed to show any survival benefit with either approach. Most of these studies had concerns of poor study design, small sample size and poor overall survival in surgery alone group [ , , ]. However the randomized controlled trial by Walsh et al. did show improvement in median survival with multimodality treatment [ , ]. The most recent meta-analysis did suggest overall survival benefit with preoperative chemoradiation compared to preoperative chemotherapy across all patient groups (squamous and adenocarcinoma [ ].
Kelsen et al. in a randomized trial on preoperative chemotherapy vs upfront surgery showed an R1 resection rate of 25 % in patients with primary surgery and 5 year overall survival less than 40 % [ ]. The most recent randomized trial on the role of neoadjuvant chemoradiation and surgery did show a statistically significant improvement in disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) with preoperative concurrent chemoradiation followed by surgery compared to surgery alone [ ]. Inspite of Level I evidence; preoperative chemoradiation followed by radical esophagectomy is still not the favored treatment modality in most centers in India and other developing countries. Overall there has been a general reluctance to accept the protocol of preoperative chemoradiation for esophageal cancer due to fear of increased perioperative morbidity / mortality and non-availability of infrastructure facilities; i.e. medical, radiation and surgical oncology under one roof.
Aims and Objective
To carry out a retrospective analysis of induction therapy followed by surgery for carcinoma esophagus in terms of early and delayed postoperative outcome and survival analysis.
Methods
We carried out a retrospective comparative study of patients undergoing radical esophagectomy after neoadjuvant therapy (preoperative chemotherapy or preoperative concurrent chemoradiation) versus patients undergoing upfront surgery at Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Research Center, New Delhi, India.
Clinical data was collected using HIS Vista ®. A total of 118 patients who underwent Radical Esophagectomy from January 2009 to December 2013 were included in the study. All surgeries were performed by a single surgical team.
Treatment protocol included initial assessment by UGI Endoscopy & Biopsy for tissue diagnosis and disease staging by CECT Chest and Abdomen or Whole Body FDG 18 PET CT. Most patients with clinical stage T2/N2 or above underwent preoperative therapy (Group A; n = 66) concurrent chemoradiation or preoperative chemotherapy. Patients found suitable for upfront surgery underwent preoperative workup with CBC, KFT, LFT, Viral Markers, Blood group and Type screening, 2D Echo and PFT followed by radical esophagectomy (Group B; n = 52) after pre-anaesthetic assessment and optimization. Preoperative concurrent CTRT was done by IMRT /3D CRT to a total dose of 50.4 Gray / 28 # with weekly CDDP (Cisplatinum). All patient tolerated the treatment well with Grade 3 or 4 toxicity in 6 % patients only. Disease response assessment was done at six weeks of completion of therapy with Whole body FDG 18 PET CT followed by Radical Esophagectomy there after. Seven patients received preoperative chemotherapy only for locally advanced GE Junction adenocarcinoma with three weekly cisplatinium based chemotherapy.
Different patient variables analyzed included patient age, sex, presence or absence of comorbidities; various tumor characteristics including tumor location, histology and clinico-radiological stage. Treatment variables studied included type of surgery (Transhiatal/ Ivor Lewis/ Mckeown) and surgical approach (conventional open/ thoracoscopic esophagectomy).
Data was analyzed to assess feasibility of surgery after neoadjuvant therapy, to include total operative time, ICU/Hospital stay, early and delayed surgical complications and survival (DFS and OS). Besides routine histopathological parameters, overall pathologic response and tumor margin status was studied with reference to preoperative therapy.
Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS Version 22 (IBM). Outcomes were compared using Chi square test, p value of <0.005 was considered statistically significant. Disease free survival and overall survival was calculated using Kaplan Meir Curve.
Results
From January 2009 to December 2013, total of 118 patients underwent radical esophagectomy by a single surgical oncology team. Out of 118 surgeries performed, 66 underwent surgery after induction therapy (59 patients with preoperative concurrent chemoradiation and 7 patients with preoperative chemotherapy) while 52 patients underwent upfront surgery.
Patient Variables
Comparison of patient characteristics in group A and group B did not reveal any statistically significant difference in patient age, sex, and histologic subtype (Table 1 ). Nearly one fourth of patients in group 2 were adenocarcinoma compared to 13.6 % in group A; and most patients were mid third esophageal cancers (45/66). On the other hand most patients in group B were lower third esophageal and GE Junction tumors (33/52). In both groups the most commonly performed surgery was Mckeown’ Esophagectomy with two-field lymphadenectomy (89.3 % in group A and 73.0 % in group B); while others underwent either transhiatal or Ivor Lewis esophagectomy. Clinico-radiological stage grouping suggested more of locally advanced tumors (cT3/4) in group A (64/66). All patients in group B were either clinical stage T1or 2 (Table 1 ).

Surgical Outcomes
The mean operative time in group A and group B was 343 min and 335 min respectively, and was not statistically different ( p = 0.157). Mean duration of ICU stay in group A and B was 6.35 vs. 6.47 days respectively ( p = 0.314). Mean duration of total hospital stay was comparable in both groups (14.25 days vs. 14.48 days, p = 0.267). Overall postoperative complications in group A and B were similar for number of cardiac (9.1 vs 7.7 % ) and pulmonary (21.2 vs. 19.2 %) events respectively. The anastomotic leak rate in group A and B was 9 vs 7.7 % respectively. Incidence of postoperative chylothorax was however higher in group A (6.1 vs 1.9 %) while anastomotic stricture was lower (3.0 vs. 9.6 %) in group A. However the difference was not statistically significant (Table 2 ). We did not find any significant increase in perioperative mortality in patients undergoing surgery after induction therapy (3.0 vs. 5.8 %; p = ns).

Histopathological Outcomes
Almost 40 % of patients receiving preoperative therapy (chemotherapy or chemoradiation) showed a pathological complete response (pCR) to induction therapy on post-surgery histopathological assessment. Assessment of histopathological margins (proximal, distal and circumferential radial margin) suggested R0 resection in 97.0 % in group A and 95.9 % in group B. The mean number of mediastinal and abdominal lymph nodes retrieved were 9.3 and 11.5 in group A and 11.5 and 15.9 in group B respectively. Overall 62.5 % patients in group A and 50 % patients in group B were node negative pathologically (pN0). Comparison of PETCT done pre and post induction therapy, revealed significant response in 71 % patients with complete response in 49 % and nodal response in 68 %, which co-related with pathological complete response seen in 39 % and pathological nodal negativity of 62.5 % respectively (Table 3 ). Based on postoperative histopathology report; 43.75 % patients in group B patients required adjuvant therapy.

Survival Outcomes
Out of 118 patients, follow up data of 92 patients was available for outcome analysis. Overall and disease free survivals, calculated using Kaplan Meir curve, revealed statistically similar results in group A and B (Fig. 1 ) . However there was a trend towards increase in DFS from 24 months and a better OS from 48 months in group A as compared to group B (p = ns) (Table 4 ). Fig. 1 Comparison of OS and DFS in group A and B Table 4 Comparison of OS and DFS in group A AND B Months Overall survival Disease free survival Group A Group B Group A Group B 12 84.2 % 76.2 % 73.7 % 73.1 % 24 60 % 50.0 % 68.1 % 40.5 % 36 47.6 % 55.1 % 52.7 % 28 % 48 47.6 % 45.1 % 47.3 % 28.8 % 60 47.6 % 36.1 % 47.3 % 28.8 %
There was no statisticall significant impact of tumour location, histologic subtype and clinical stage on DFS and OS, whereas pathological staging did affect the survivals (Table 5 ). Patients with pathologically negative nodes faired significantly better in terms of OS as well as DFS in both groups A and B ( p value = 0.027). Patients who had complete response had mean survival of 39.6 months as compared to 20.3 months in those with a poor response.

Discussion
The objective of preoperative concurrent chemoradiation is to increase overall and disease free survival by possibly treating micro metastasis and achieving better loco regional disease control. It may also act as a methodology for in vivo assessment of biologic behavior of the disease and plan further adjuvant therapy depending upon the clinico-radiologic and pathological response. Initial studies on preoperative chemo radiation, revealed survival benefit, but at the cost of morbidity and mortality. In the meta-analysis by Florica et al. [ ], increase in survival was offset by double postoperative mortality while Urshel and Vasant [ ] suggested an increase in mortality, with benefit of preoperative therapy seen only after 3 years of treatment. In a study by Bossetet al [ ] there was improvement in disease free survival with induction therapy in stage I and II, but low overall survival due to increase in postoperative mortality from 3.6 to 12.3 %.
In spite of dismal results in OS in most studies comparing preoperative therapy and surgery with surgery alone; the pathologic complete response rate was higher with preoperative chemoradiation than with preoperative chemotherapy alone (17–31 vs 2.5–8 %) respectively. Although there was no survival benefit due to increased perioperative mortality at that time [ , ].
Further milestone in the evolution of esophageal cancer management was laid by the studies showing decreasing morbidity and mortality due to the advances in patient selection, perioperative and postoperative care [ ]. CROSS trial revealed pCR rate of 29 % and a low inhospital mortality of 4 %, however increased overall survival, especially in squamous cell carcinoma [ ]. Sjoquist et al., in their meta-analysis revealed absolute benefit in overall survival of 2 years in both squamous and adenocarcinoma and similar 30 day perioperative mortality [ ].
There is limited experience of use of preoperative chemoradiation followed by radical esophagectomy in developing nations, mostly due to inacceptance by surgeons due to fear of increased perioperative mortality and morbidity, poor performance status and nutrition of patients; and in certain areas due to non-availability of resources and comprehensive cancer care facilities.
In our study, both groups were comparable in terms of age, sex and histologic subtype. Significant difference in tumor location could be explained by the tendency to consider mid thoracic tumors for induction therapy and lower esophageal tumors for upfront surgery. Group A had more advanced cases as clinically T2 patients were selected for upfront surgery in the initial period of the study. All patients received neoadjuvant therapy as planned and as reported in most of above-mentioned studies. However, we used a different concurrent chemotherapy regimen (weekly cisplatinium) in our patients; instead of carboplatin and paclitaxel as used by the CROSS trial due to better treatment tolerance of concurrent cisplatin in our patients.
A statistically non significant, but slightly higher total operative time in group A suggests that surgery after induction therapy maybe somewhat more difficult especially in certain centers; but it is feasible and safe and can be performed without increasing the morbidity due to prolonged anesthesia. Similar ICU stay reflects comparable general condition, hydration status, maintenance of vitals, time to no intravenous fluid requirement, blood parameters and chest imaging and untoward events in the early postoperative period. Total hospital stay was also no different; pointing to same time for ICD removal, starting of oral feed and return to basic activities in patients undergoing surgery after induction therapy. Morbidity was not increased by induction therapy, as suggested by similar cardiopulmonary events and anastomotic leak rate. Fibrosis and loss of tissue planes account for higher number of chylothorax and more frequent stapled anastomosis account for lower stricture rate in group A though not significant. No increase in perioperative mortality corresponds to the latest studies showing survival benefit with chemoradiation not offset by toxicity.
Rate of pathological complete response and its survival benefit after neo-adjuvant therapy in our study, was similar to that observed in other studies [ ]. Higher rate of pathological nodal negativity after induction therapy merits a special mention, as pN0 was the only factor to significantly alter the overall as well as disease free survival in both group A & B. R0 resection rates in locally advanced tumors patients (group A) highlights the benefit of induction therapy, though its significance for survival remains to be established. Comparison of overall and disease free survival in group A and B suggest that induction therapy not only narrowed the expected difference in survival due to selection bias (all early cases in group B), but also materialized into survival benefit after a few years (2 and 4 years for DFS and OS).
The tolerance and feasibility of chemo-radiation in the preoperative setting in esophageal cancer with trend to survival benefit, not being affected by postoperative morbidity or mortality requires further randomized studies with longer follow up data.
Conclusion
Radical esophagectomy after preoperative chemoradiation is feasible and safe even in developing nations with acceptable and comparable morbidity and mortality. Preoperative chemoradiation results in high rate of pCR, which correlates well with better loco regional control rates and survival across all patient groups and variable when compared to upfront surgery. However, randomized studies with longer follow up are required to substantiate our results and prove the survival benefit.
