Introduction
Achieving cost-effectiveness while maintaining strict quality regulations is an emerging topic in pharmaceutical manufacturing. One issue here is the production cost. In the US pharmaceutical industry, the average share of cost of goods sold for brand-name companies is around 30 %, while twice this percentage was anticipated for generic drug producers [ ]. This is mainly caused by the high R&D and production expenses that a firm must pursue to sustain its pharmaceutical business [ ]. The other challenge is the demand for maintaining a high quality standard, which must comply with good manufacturing practice (GMP) by, e.g., the US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) [ ]. Several quality criteria are imposed on pharmaceutical production, and the design windows of the production processes are restricted so that the products fulfill the designated quality. Therefore, any reduction in operating costs that sacrifices quality is prohibited beyond the defined quality levels.
To realize improvements in production processes, there have been many studies in the field of process systems engineering or pharmaceutical engineering. Process analytical technology (PAT), a group of novel analytical technologies enabling quality control at a higher precision with minimal end testing, such as soft sensors, is one of the most intensively studied fields [ , , , ]. Continuous manufacturing of solid drug products is another emerging theme, e.g., [ ], which is expected to increase productivity while decreasing batch-to-batch variations in quality. Other topics in manufacturing such as yield enhancement/loss reduction [ , ], scheduling and lead time optimization [ , ], or energy reduction [ ] have also been studied in recent years. These contributions commonly address the importance of having scientific foundations as a basis from which the optimal process setups and conditions can be determined. To enhance such science-based approaches for process design and redesign, however, there are still numerous topics in manufacturing to be covered by methodological research.
Among various processes and materials in manufacturing, we focused on the use process of pharmaceutical excipients: material reception, testing, storage, and actual use for production. Excipients are a group of chemicals used as additives for various active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), the main components responsible for drug efficacy [ , ]. The excipients are utilized for various purposes from preservatives to solubilizers. Some of the problems regarding excipients include their potential detrimental effect on the quality of the drugs, such as negative interactions with the API [ ] and also their degradation by oxidation or hydration. For example, benzyl alcohol, which is considered in this paper, is widely used as a preservative and antibacterial agent, but also causes public concern because of the side effects of the by products formed through oxidation. Benzaldehyde, one of the oxidized products of benzyl alcohol, is considered to be a cause of neonate deaths [ ]. Benzyl acetal, a condensation product of benzyl alcohol and benzaldehyde, is also considered to be a toxic impurity formed by oxidation [ ]. While studies on compatibility to prevent API–excipient interactions and PAT technologies for quantifying impurities have been published elsewhere [ , ], very limited work has been performed on the use processes, i.e., how to manage the storage and testing of excipients.
In this work, we present a multiobjective design method for determining optimal setups for using pharmaceutical excipients considering both quality and cost-effectiveness. A case study was performed using benzyl alcohol as an illustrative example. Here, the volume of the benzyl alcohol container and the purchase frequency were set as the design variables, and the degree of oxidation and the cost of operation were calculated using a model-based approach. Different process and technology options were considered, e.g., adoption of PAT for the quality control of benzyl alcohol. The multiobjective optimization yielded the Pareto frontier, i.e., the set of points that are not dominated by any other points in at least one category, and the optimal process setups were identified.
Materials and Methods
Method Overview
Figure 1 shows the developed methodology, which consists of setup of the problem, creation of models to calculate the quality and economic objective functions, and finally the multiobjective evaluation to identify the Pareto frontier. The scope of the use process is from material reception to the actual use for production including GMP-related testing and storage of materials in between. In the case study on benzyl alcohol, the quality aspect was assessed based on the amount of oxidized impurities, which was calculated based on the oxidation kinetics throughout the use process. The economic performance of the process was represented by the total costs associated with the material testing that must be performed to meet the GMP regulations. The multiobjective optimization was performed by plotting the processes based on the calculated values of the objective functions and by identifying the Pareto frontier. Fig. 1 Proposed steps of the multiobjective design
The entire procedure is general as an optimization method; however, the novelty here is the integration of multiscale information from the reaction level to the process level for decision support.
Step 1: Setup Design Problems
For the development of excipient use processes, the basic information relevant to the process is first collected. This may include clear definitions of the underlying problem(s), the usage environment, and possible alternative technological options. To support objective decision-making, objective functions, which are the indicators that represent the problem(s) of the process in a quantitative manner, must be defined. The relationship between the objective functions to be maximized or minimized and the parameters describing the use processes will then be ruled out. In general, these parameters are divided into two groups, the constraints and the design variables. The constraints are the parameters that take constant values and are determined based on the boundary conditions of the process. The design variables are the parameters that have some freedom in the values they may take, but will define the process by the values they take. In addition, different possible technological options to replace the existing methods should be considered to clarify the effect of introducing new technologies.
In the case study on benzyl alcohol, the factors to be considered for the objective functions were chosen as: (1) the quality of the excipient at the point of actual use for production and (2) the total cost associated with the material testing. According to the current and internationally recognized GMPs [ , ], excipients are subjected to two types of tests, the release and the identification (ID) tests. The release test is performed at the point of the material reception. In this test, various material properties, e.g., purity, concentration, and visual appearance, are scrutinized. In the ID test, which is performed just before the first actual use for production, the material in hand is confirmed to be actually the material that is intended to be used. In both tests, the containers are opened for sampling and the material inside can be exposed to an oxidative environment.
In this study, the peroxide value, PV [−], was chosen as the objective function to assess the quality aspect of the use process, as shown in Eq. 1 . According to the US pharmacopeia [ ], the peroxide value is the number that expresses, in milliequivalents of active oxygen, the quantity of peroxide contained in 1000 g of the substance. The value for benzyl alcohol must be not more than five [ ]. $$ PV=\frac{\mathrm{Moles}\kern0.28em \mathrm{of}\kern0.28em \mathrm{oxidized}\kern0.28em \mathrm{products}}{\mathrm{Mass}\kern0.28em \mathrm{of}\kern0.28em \mathrm{excipient}\kern0.28em \mathrm{in}\kern0.28em \mathrm{g}}\times {10}^6 $$ (1)
In the industrial processes, multiple containers are delivered as a batch at certain intervals, and PV among the containers can vary depending on the periods exposed to oxidative environments. Thereby, by following the worst-case approach, the container with the largest degree of oxidation was regarded as the representative one, and its PV was defined as the quality indicator of the process.
The economic performance of the process was measured by the operating cost OC [$/year]. As explained below, the total cost for these tests was defined as the indicator of the process based on the number of release and ID tests conducted per year.
Process and technology alternatives can also be included in the analysis. As an illustrative example, the introduction of Raman spectroscopy for ID testing, one of the best-known PAT technologies, was considered. The advantages of using such PAT technologies include the ability to conduct faster and cheaper inspections while preventing possible degradation of the material by keeping the containers unopened throughout the testing. However, a concrete and quantitative assessment of the advantages gained by the introduction is indispensable for clarifying the extent of the possible improvements. In this work, therefore, the effect of introducing Raman spectroscopy was assessed based on the PV and the OC after adding modifications in the calculation methods (see Evaluate Process and Technology Options for details). The parameter values used in the calculations are summarized in Table 1 .

Step 2: Create Quality Degradation Models
In this step, a mathematical model that describes quality degradation is created. Both the understanding of the degradation kinetics and the modeling of the process will be required to calculate the objective functions, to clarify the relevant constraints, and also to determine the design variables.
Model Degradation Phenomena
The basic chemical reaction equations responsible for the by product formation are to be determined. Based on the degradation mechanisms, i.e., first- or second-order reactions, differential equations for calculating the by product formation kinetics are defined, and their analytical solutions are to be deduced. The variables that do not take constant values in the analytical solution equations are relevant to the design variables, and their behaviors must be monitored through the modeling of the degradation process, as described in “ Model the Degradation Processes .”
For benzyl alcohol oxidation, the PV was calculated based on the concentrations of the products formed by the two-step oxidation. The oxidation reaction of benzyl alcohol has been considered to proceed via aerobic oxidation with hydroxyl radicals (·OH) in the gas phase, following the reaction formulas: Open image in new window (2)
We referred to the reaction equations disclosed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the references therein [ , ], where the kinetic constant values are provided for the reactions at room temperature, the general condition in the industry. In the calculation, the process temperature, T , was defined as 293.15 K. According to the reaction formulas in this database, benzaldehyde is first formed by the oxidation of benzyl alcohol; then, with an additional reaction with the hydroxyl radicals, a group of “further oxidized products” is produced. Both reactions are known to follow second-order kinetics equations with the constants listed in Table 1 . In this work, the “further oxidized products” were considered to be the elements that account for the peroxide species inside the benzyl alcohol, and the content was calculated and transformed into PV .
The oxidation mechanism of benzyl alcohol in the container was considered to follow the conventional aerobic oxidation, as depicted in Fig. 2 . Fig. 2 Assumed oxidation mechanism of benzyl alcohol in the container
First, benzyl alcohol present in the gas phase is oxidized to form benzaldehyde. The produced benzaldehyde is then simultaneously separated into the gas phase and the liquid phase, i.e., benzyl alcohol phase, following the gas–liquid equilibrium. The formation of the further oxidized products proceeds by the oxidation of only the benzaldehyde present in the gas phase by the reaction with hydroxyl radicals. The further oxidized products obtained are assumed to be dissolved into the liquid benzyl alcohol instantly after formation.
The reaction kinetics for benzyl alcohol oxidation can be written: $$ \begin{array}{c}\hfill \frac{\mathrm{d}\left[\mathrm{BAld}\right]}{\mathrm{d}t}={k}_1\left[\mathrm{BAlc}\right]\left[\cdot \mathrm{O}\mathrm{H}\right]-{k}_2\left[\mathrm{BAld}\right]\left[\cdot \mathrm{O}\mathrm{H}\right]\hfill \\ {}\hfill \frac{\mathrm{d}\left[\mathrm{Oxid}\right]}{\mathrm{d}t}={k}_2\left[\mathrm{BAld}\right]\left[\cdot \mathrm{O}\mathrm{H}\right]\hfill \end{array} $$ (3) where [BAlc], [BAld], [Oxid], and [⋅OH] represent the molar concentrations of benzyl alcohol, benzaldehyde, the further oxidized products, and the hydroxyl radicals in the gas phase, respectively. The terms k 1 , k 2 , and t represent the kinetic constants for the first and second reaction steps and the reaction time, respectively. The value of [BAlc] was assumed to be constant at the saturation concentration, which was obtained from the saturation vapor pressure of benzyl alcohol, p BAlc , at the temperature T . The value of [BAld] was calculated assuming that benzaldehyde always follows the gas–liquid equilibrium. The distribution ratio, K , defined by the ratio of the total moles of benzaldehyde in the liquid and in the gas phases was formulated as: $$ K=\frac{n_{\mathrm{BAld},\mathrm{l}}}{n_{\mathrm{BAld},\mathrm{g}}}\kern0.3em \cong \kern0.3em \frac{\frac{\rho_{\mathrm{BAlc},\mathrm{l}}{V}_{\mathrm{l}}}{{\mathrm{MW}}_{\mathrm{BAlc}}}{x}_{\mathrm{BAld}}}{\frac{p_{\mathrm{T}}{V}_{\mathrm{g}}}{RT}{y}_{\mathrm{BAld}}}=\frac{\frac{\rho_{\mathrm{BAlc},\mathrm{l}}{V}_{\mathrm{l}}}{{\mathrm{MW}}_{\mathrm{BAlc}}}}{\frac{p_{\mathrm{T}}{V}_{\mathrm{g}}}{RT}H} $$ (4) where n BAld,l and n BAld,g are the total moles of benzaldehyde in the liquid and gas phases, V l and V g are the volume of the liquid and the gas phases inside the container, MW BAlc is the molecular weight of benzyl alcohol, x BAld and y BAld are the molar fractions of benzaldehyde in the liquid and in the gas phases, and p T , R , and ρ BAlc,l are the total pressure of the gas phase, the gas constant, and the density of benzyl alcohol liquid, respectively. The substances are assumed to follow the ideal gas equation. The term H is the Henry’s constant of benzaldehyde based on the molar fraction in the gas and liquid phases ( y BAld = H x BAld ). The value of H at the temperature T was estimated from the gas–liquid equilibrium data of benzyl alcohol–benzaldehyde based on the UNI Functional-group Activity Coefficients (UNIFAC) method in ASPEN Plus® [ ], a commercial simulator for chemical processes.
The particular analytical solutions to Eq. 3 were obtained, and the total moles of benzaldehyde in the gas phase as well as those of the further oxidized products, n Oxid,g , were expressed as: $$ \begin{array}{l}{n}_{\mathrm{BAld},\mathrm{g}}\left|{}_{t=t}\right.=\frac{k_1\left[\cdot \mathrm{O}\mathrm{H}\right]{V}_{\mathrm{g}}}{k_2}-\frac{k_1\left[\mathrm{BAlc}\right]{V}_{\mathrm{g}}-{k}_2{n}_{\mathrm{BAld},\mathrm{g}}\left|{}_{t=0}\right.}{k_2} \exp \left(-\frac{k_2\left[\cdot \mathrm{O}\mathrm{H}\right]t}{K+1}\right)\hfill \\ {}{n}_{\mathrm{Oxid},\ \mathrm{g}}\left|{}_{t=t}\right.={n}_{\mathrm{Oxid},\mathrm{g}}\left|{}_{t=0}\right.+{k}_2\left[\cdot \mathrm{O}\mathrm{H}\right]\hfill \\ {}\left\{\frac{k_1\left[\cdot \mathrm{O}\mathrm{H}\right]{V}_{\mathrm{g}}}{k_2}t-\left(\frac{k_1\left[\mathrm{BAlc}\right]{V}_{\mathrm{g}}-{k}_2{n}_{\mathrm{BAld},\mathrm{g}}\left|{}_{t=0}\right.}{k_2}\right)\left(-\frac{K+1}{k_2\left[\cdot \mathrm{O}\mathrm{H}\right]}\right) \exp \left(-\frac{k_2\left[\cdot \mathrm{O}\mathrm{H}\right]t}{K+1}\right)\right\}-\frac{k_1\left[\mathrm{BAlc}\right]{V}_{\mathrm{g}}-{k}_2{n}_{\mathrm{BAld},\mathrm{g}}\left|{}_{t=0}\right.}{k_2}\left(K+1\right)\hfill \end{array} $$ (5)
The value of n Oxid,g was considered as the total moles of the further oxidized products formed throughout the whole process. For calculating PV , this quantity was considered to be present in the liquid phase by following the worst case approach, and thereby, the value of n Oxid,g was substituted for n Oxid,l . From the above equations, the main variables that strongly influence PV were indicated to be V g and t .
Model the Degradation Processes
Based on the equations derived from the model of the degradation phenomena, the variables affecting the objective functions are first identified. The use process as a whole, from materials reception to disposal, is monitored and the unit operations relevant to the variables and the objective functions are outlined. The transitions in the values of the variables in relation with the unit operations are then sought to calculate the final values of the objective functions.
The changes in the values of V g and t were investigated by analyzing the use processes of the benzyl alcohol. Figure 3a shows the period from the material reception of n containers to the actual use for production, with the time scale on the x -axis and the number of containers on the y -axis. The time points of the first opening are shown with the vertical green lines (emphasized with the green arrows) and those of the last use for production with the vertical black lines. Here, constant consumption of excipient is assumed. According to the current GMP, assuming that n containers were received, \( \left(\sqrt{n}+1\right) \) containers will be opened for the release test at the material reception, and all n containers will undergo the ID test at the first actual use for production. If the containers were numbered from 1 to n , and were used in this numerical order, the \( \left(\sqrt{n}+1\right) \) th container will be the last one to be used among those that were subjected to release testing. Therefore, the \( \left(\sqrt{n}+1\right) \) th container has the longest oxidation period and thus its PV was investigated further. In practice, the number of \( \left(\sqrt{n}+1\right) \) is rounded up, and if n is equal to 1 or 2, n containers will be opened for release testing. However, for the sake of simplification, the expression “ \( \left(\sqrt{n}+1\right) \) th container” is used in the text hereafter. Fig. 3 a Stepwise decrease in the number of containers and the time points at which the containers are opened for release and ID testing. The \( \left(\sqrt{n}+1\right) \) th container is highlighted as the one with the longest oxidation period. b Time dependency of the headspace and the excipient volume of the \( \left(\sqrt{n}+1\right) \) th container
Figure 3b shows a schematic depicting the time dependency of the headspace and the excipient volume of the \( \left(\sqrt{n}+1\right) \) th container. As shown in Fig. 3a, b , the use process of excipients can be divided into two stages for ease of analysis: first, the period between the release and ID testing (shown with red rectangles in Fig. 3a, b for the \( \left(\sqrt{n}+1\right) \) th container) and second, the period between the ID testing and the point of using up the container (shown with the blue rectangles in Fig. 3a, b for the \( \left(\sqrt{n}+1\right) \) th container).
The time periods for these stages were defined as t 1 and t 2 , respectively. The oxidation of benzyl alcohol initiates at t = 0 when the container is opened for the release test, i.e., the delivered material is assumed to contain no impurities. The headspace ratio, defined as V g / V l , was fixed to 0.1 in the initial state. During the period of t 1 , the oxidation is considered to proceed with the constant headspace volume ratio of 0.1. The value of t 1 can be calculated as: $$ {t}_1=\frac{365}{f\times n}\times \sqrt{n}=\frac{365}{\sqrt{\frac{E\times f}{V}}} $$ (6) where f and E represent the frequency of purchasing the excipients per year, and the excipient amount required per year, respectively. The term V is defined to be the purchased and labeled volume of the liquid excipient, which is equal to V l at material reception, and referred to as container volume hereafter. The excipients were assumed to arrive at the manufacturing site at equal time periods of 365/ f days. The period in days for a container to be subjected to ID testing and to be fully consumed will be 365/( f × n ) as can be seen in Fig. 3a . The value of t 1 was calculated according to Eq. 6 because the use of the \( \left(\sqrt{n}+1\right) \) th container will start immediately after the \( \sqrt{n\ } \) th container is consumed.
In the period t 2 , a constant amount of benzyl alcohol, v , is used for actual productions at periodic intervals, Δt . The oxidation proceeds with increasing headspace volume and decreasing liquid phase volume, both in a stepwise manner until the material is totally consumed. This second stage can be considered as the multiple repetition of storage and actual use of the material. The oxidation kinetics were calculated assuming that the oxidation proceeds only during the time of storage under a constant headspace volume. The changes in the headspace volume and the impurity contents, i.e., benzaldehyde and further oxidized products, occur only at the actual use for production, which was for our calculations treated as instantaneous.
First, the method to calculate the effect of oxidation within one storage period was investigated. The value of t 2 , schematically shown in Fig. 3a , can be calculated by Eq. 7 . $$ {t}_2=\frac{365}{\frac{E}{V}} $$ (7) where N is the number of containers used in a year. The values of Δt are calculated by: $$ \varDelta t={t}_2/k $$ (8) where k is the number of times a certain container is used and is calculated as: $$ k = V/v $$ (9)
The oxidation proceeds with maintaining the distribution ratio K constant during the period Δt , and the content of impurities n Oxid,l after the storage intervals can then be calculated using Eq. 5 . The initial value to be used is the impurity contents after the previous actual usage.
Next, the method to calculate the effect of oxidation over different storage periods was investigated. During the use of excipients for production, no oxidation was considered to proceed because the time span of this process was considered to be much shorter than Δt . The total impurity content after the actual usage was calculated from the remaining excipient contents, considering that the concentrations of the impurities are constant. The relationship between the total moles of the impurity substances before and after the i th usage can be calculated as: $$ \begin{array}{l}{n}_{\mathrm{Oxid},\mathrm{l},i+1}={n}_{\mathrm{Oxid},\mathrm{l},i}\ \left(\frac{k-i}{k-i+1}\right)\hfill \\ {}\hfill {n}_{\mathrm{BAld},\mathrm{l},\ i+1}={n}_{\mathrm{BAld},\mathrm{l},\ i}\ \left(\frac{k-i}{k-i+1}\right)\hfill \end{array} $$ (10)
The impurity content just before the ( i + 2)th usage is calculated using Eq. 5 , with n BAld,l, i + 1 and n Oxid,l, i + 1 as the initial terms, and from the results obtained, the impurity content momentarily after the ( i + 2)th usage is calculated using Eq. 10 . The final PV was calculated by repeating these calculations until the excipient is consumed and was finally assigned as the representative indicator for assessing quality as: $$ PV=\frac{n_{\mathrm{Oxid},\mathrm{l}}}{\rho_{\mathrm{BAlc}}v}\times {10}^6 $$ (11)
Step 3: Create Economic Evaluation Models
Economic assessment of the use process is essential for clarifying the relationships, i.e., trade-offs or simultaneous improvements, between the quality and the total cost. Addressing all the factors, especially those strongly related to the design variables, is indispensable for precise quantification.
For the benzyl alcohol use processes, the total cost regarding excipient usage, or the operating cost, OC , was calculated based on the sum of the annual costs for release testing and ID testing. These values are calculated using: $$ \mathrm{Annual}\;\mathrm{cost}\;\mathrm{f}\mathrm{o}\mathrm{r}\;\mathrm{r}\mathrm{elease}\;\mathrm{testing}={C}_1\left(\sqrt{n}+1\right)f={C}_1\left(\sqrt{\frac{E}{V\times f}}+1\right)f $$ (12) $$ \mathrm{Annual}\;\mathrm{cost}\;\mathrm{f}\mathrm{o}\mathrm{r}\;\mathrm{ID}\;\mathrm{testing}={C}_2\times N={C}_2\left(\frac{E}{V}\right) $$ (13)
The terms C 1 and C 2 represent costs of release testing and ID testing, respectively, and their values in the calculation are summarized in Table 1 .
The calculation model discussed above was designated as the Initial model . This model could represent the existing process in many companies and will serve as a reference to the alternative models to be described in the later “ Evaluate Process and Technology Options .”
Step 4: Perform Multiobjective Optimization
Create Multiobjective Plot
The multiobjective optimization, or the process assessment based on the objective functions, can be performed as follows. First, identification of the design variables, x = x 1 , x 2 …, is conducted by identifying the variables with degrees of freedom. Based on the calculations using the design variables, the objective functions, f 1 , f 2 …, are plotted on a matrix in the form of ( f 1 ( x 1 ), f 2 ( x 1 ) …); ( f 1 ( x 2 ), f 2 ( x 2 ) …); …. The points that are not dominated by any other points in at least one category belong to the Pareto frontier. The optimal processes can be determined based on the design variables that are in the frontier. From Eqs. 6 , 7 , 12 , and 13 , the variables V and f were observed to be the ones that will define the process by taking certain values. Therefore, V and f were defined as the design variables, and the PV was plotted against OC depending on the values {1, 2.5, 5, 10 L} as V and {1, 2, 3, 4, 6 time(s) per year} as f , respectively. The quantity of E was set to be 120 L.
Evaluate Process and Technology Options
Consideration of various technical options is important to show that the use process can be drastically improved from both the quality and the economic perspectives through bottom-up renovation. This includes the introduction of novel technologies and also making slight amendments without much investment. Understanding the nature of these changes will enable the appropriate modification in the calculation method of the objective functions and will be useful for comparing with the objective functions of the original use process.
In this work, two alternative models, the Raman model and the Discard model , each representing a use process, were devised to observe the effect of changing the initial use process. Raman model As an example of introducing a new analytical instrument, the Raman model was devised, in which Raman spectroscopy was introduced into the process for ID testing. With this technology, the analyses can be performed with the containers kept closed during testing, and the cost per test is significantly reduced. Because the \( \left(\sqrt{n}+1\right) \) th container is opened for the release test, the PV was calculated in accordance with the Initial model. The OC was calculated after replacing the value of C 2 with C 3 , a reduced value. Discard model To enhance the quality of the excipients without introducing new technologies, one possibility is to dispose of all the excipient containers that were opened at release test. In this way, the period for the degradation will be shortened because the degradation will only start after the ID test, not the release test. One disadvantage of this method is that extra excipients must be purchased to cover not only the material used for pharmaceutical production but also those to be discarded without being used for production at all. In this model, designated as the Discard model , the number of excipient containers to be purchased was calculated so that the number of containers after the disposal of those used in the release tests will be equal to the number used in production. OC was calculated based on the above modifications, i.e., additional procurement using the material cost of benzyl alcohol C 4 [$/m 3 ], while PV was calculated using the time period between the ID testing and the container disposal as the reaction period.
It is also possible to predict the performance of the process after simultaneous employment of both alternatives, which is designated as the Combined model . When the combination of the two methods was applied, the PV was calculated following the Discard model , while the OC was calculated based on the combination of the two models, that is, by replacing the cost of ID testing for the Raman analyses and by adding the cost for the additional purchase of the containers according to the Discard model .
Identify Pareto Frontier and Draw Conclusions
The objective functions calculated based on the different process models can be plotted in the same matrix ( f 1 ′ ( x 1 ), f 2 ′ ( x 1 ) …); ( f 1 ′ ( x 2 ), f 2 ′ ( x 2 ) …); … to make a direct comparison of both the effect of the process parameters and the use process itself. The comparison on the Pareto frontiers will be a support for the decision-making in designing the excipient use processes. The calculated results for the Raman model , Discard model , and the Combined model were plotted for further investigation. From the comparison in the Pareto frontiers, the understanding of the effect of introducing new technologies was visualized to deduce the conclusions.
Results and Discussion
Influence of Choosing Container Volume and Purchase Frequency
The objective functions PV and OC , calculated based on the Initial model, were plotted for the multiobjective optimization (Fig. 4 ). Regarding the quality evaluation, none of the process options exceed the regulatory limitation of PV value, which is defined as five in the US pharmacopeia [ ]. The influences of V and f on the objective functions, PV and OC , were first investigated. Having a larger V causes an increase in PV because of the longer degradation periods, while the OC decreases. The reduced number of total containers brought to site annually by employing larger containers was the main reason. Having a higher value of f led to increased OC because the number of tests increased; however, only a small reduction in the PV was confirmed. Under the conditions of the Initial model, changing the container volume played a larger effect in improving the quality than changing the purchase frequency. A clear trade-off between the quality and total cost, which is impossible to overcome, was signified (depicted with black dotted lines in Fig. 4 ), and the design variables attributed to the Pareto frontier could be indicated. Fig. 4 Multiobjective evaluation result for identifying the Pareto frontier of the Initial process
Evaluation of the Alternative Processes and Technologies
The effect of introducing various changes to the Initial model was further investigated. Objective functions for the three alternative models ( Raman model , Discard model , and the Combined model ) were calculated and plotted following the same procedures as above (Fig. 5 ; only the plots for f = 1 are shown for clarity). The dotted lines again show the Pareto frontiers of each model. Fig. 5 Multiobjective evaluation result for comparing the Pareto frontiers of Initial process ( filled circles ), Raman process ( unfilled circles ), Discard process ( filled diamonds ), and Combined process ( unfilled diamonds )
Irrespective of the container volumes, the use of Raman spectroscopy led to reduced OC , especially when smaller containers were used. Little improvement in the quality by using the Raman spectroscopy was observed. This is because, as mentioned in “ Evaluate Process and Technology Options ,” this technique can only be used for the ID test and because the \( \left(\sqrt{n}+1\right) \) th container is already opened at the release test, the calculation of PV was identical with that in the Initial model.
An issue that must be taken into consideration is that the Raman model discussed in this work does not include the investment and depreciation costs. To consider the net economic perspective of the novel technologies, similar calculations for all the various potential excipients that will be tested using the new equipment should be performed, and a comparison in the net total cost should be made to verify its economic advantages.
The objective function calculated using the Discard model exhibited similar traits. A significant increase in the OC was observed for all cases because of the additional costs of the discarded excipients. However, the PV was reduced by not using the opened materials. From these comparisons, it could be shown that even a slight change in the use process without the introduction of a novel technology may significantly improve the final products. Furthermore, the Combined model possessed the advantages of the Raman model and the Discard model , having a lower PV and OC than the Initial model.
Graphic analyses have also pointed out the improvements in the points attributed to the Pareto frontiers by the introduction of new processes to different extents. The discard process, which does not require additional equipment installation, provides better process conditions, while the introduction of Raman spectroscopy will lead to a significant cost reduction.
If the Initial model corresponds to an existing process of a company, this result clearly shows the opportunity for successful process retrofitting in both quality and cost.
Conclusions and Outlook
In this article, we have presented a multiobjective design method for the use processes of pharmaceutical excipients, considering quality degradation and operating costs as the objective functions. The method follows the general steps of process modeling and optimization: setup of the problem, creation of evaluation models, and finally multiobjective optimization. The novelty here is the integrative nature of multiscale data, tools, and information to deal with degradation phenomena, storage and testing processes, GMP, and new technology introduction, rather than the procedure itself.
The method was demonstrated in the case study on benzyl alcohol, an important but oxygen-sensitive pharmaceutical ingredient. Peroxide value and operating costs were defined as the quality and economic objectives, respectively, and the container volume and purchase frequency were set as the design variables. To calculate the quality indicator, the consecutive oxidation reactions in the container were first modeled, and this model was then combined with the use process considering the opening of the container. For the economic evaluation, the total operating costs associated with the release and ID testing were calculated. Both results were summarized in a multiobjective evaluation plot, and the graphical analysis indicated the process setups on the Pareto frontier. Within the information considered in this work, the container volume showed the larger influence on the results for both objectives than the purchase frequency. Furthermore, the analysis included additional process and technology options: introduction of Raman spectroscopy, purchase and discard of additional containers, or their combination. The comparison of the Pareto frontiers reflected the character of each process or technology, especially the cost-effectiveness of the Raman technology as far as operating cost is concerned. Another finding was the importance of seeking optimization not only in new technologies but also in slight amendments without much investment.
The methodology presented, which is primarily focused on excipients, could be extended to starting materials in general that suffer from trade-offs between quality and cost. Here, integrative use of different disciplines such as reaction engineering, chemical kinetics, and process analysis is the key to enhancing the scientific approach for designing the manufacturing processes considering quality, cost-effectiveness, and/or various other criteria such as environmental aspects.
