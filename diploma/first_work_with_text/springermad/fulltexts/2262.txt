Introduction
Ischemic stroke (IS) is a leading cause of death worldwide, and it accounts for more than 80% of all stroke cases (Loo and Gan ). Although the pathogenesis of IS remains unclear, stroke is widely accepted as a complex process of interactions between genetic and environmental factors (Boehme et al. ). Genome wide association studies have addressed the relationship between genetic variants and IS. Gene variants, such as rs11196288 variant near hyaluronan binding protein 2 gene and rs2107595 variant in histone deacetylase 9 gene, are related to susceptibility to IS (Azghandi et al. ; Li et al. ). These researches suggest that genetic factors play an important role in the process of IS.
Calmodulin 1 gene ( CALM1 ), which is located in chromosome 14q32.11, encodes a highly conserved calmodulin (CaM) protein. CaM plays an important role in brain physiology. The CaM plasma levels in patients with stroke are significantly higher than normal controls (Yuan et al. ). The level of CaM activity increased in rat ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) of the brain (Tang et al. ). CaM binds to calcium ions and mediates various signals involved in cellular functions, including cell division, differentiation, and signal transduction (Hanley et al. ; Chin and Means ). Calcium ion overload caused by the loss of mediation by CaM aggravates IRI during ischemic brain damage (Moha Ou Maati et al. ).
A quantitative transcriptomics analysis has reported that CALM1 is highly expressed in human brain tissue (Fagerberg et al. ). Moreover, some studies have addressed the association between CALM1 gene and stroke. Yuan et al. ( ) reported that CALM1 is regulated by miR-126, and it influences the expression of CaM protein, which contributes to the progression of acute cerebral infarction brain injury. Luke et al. ( ) demonstrated that CALM1 rs3814843 mutation is associated with increased risk of stroke in European. These findings suggest CALM1 gene and its mutation are involved in the stroke process. However, the association between other variants of CALM1 gene and IS is poorly understood. CALM1 rs3179089 is located in 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR). Mutations within 3′-UTRs influence translation procession (Teng et al. ; Yin et al. ). The relationship between functional rs3179089 and IS should be studied. Therefore, we conducted a case–control study to evaluate the association between CALM1 rs3179089 polymorphism and IS in Chinese Han population.
Materials and Methods
Study Subjects
This study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi University of Chinese Medicine. A total of 550 patients with IS and 550 control subjects with comparable to sex and age were recruited from the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi University of Chinese Medicine from September 2010 and June 2017. The IS diagnosis was according to the diagnostic criteria of cerebrovascular diseases from the Fourth National Conference. All recruited patients with IS underwent head magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography scanning. The patients with hemorrhagic stroke, transient ischemic attack, cerebral infarction, and stroke caused by arteritis, tumor, blood disease, brain trauma, cerebrovascular malformation, and medicine were excluded from the study. Healthy controls were free from cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, autoimmune disorders, severe hepatic and renal dysfunction, malignant tumor, and immunological disease.
Clinical Data Collection
All subjects’ clinical data including gender, age, ethnicity, and family history were extracted from medical records. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were measured by electronic sphygmomanometer. Biochemical parameters, namely, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting and 2-h plasma glucose, total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), were measured by standard laboratory procedures using a Hitachi 7600 Automatic Biochemistry Analyzer. Blood coagulation markers, including platelet (PLT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), plasma D-Dimer (D-D), fibrinogen (FIB), international normalized ratio (INR), prothrombin time (PT), prothrombin time activity (PTA), and thrombin time (TT), were measured by a MINDRAY 6900 automatic blood cell analyzer. All operations were completed by professional technicians of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi University of Chinese Medicine in accordance with standard laboratory procedures.
Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR)
QRT-PCR was performed in 80 patients with IS and 80 control subjects. Total RNA was extracted from study subjects using TRIzol (Invitrogen Co., America), and subsequently reverse-transcribed using a PrimeScriptTM RT reagent kit with a gDNA eraser (TaKaRa Co., Dalian, China) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. The primers were designed and synthesized by TaKaRa Bio of Dalian. GAPDH served as an internal standard. The sequences of the forward and backward primers used were as follows: 5′-TGGCAGTGCCCTTGAAGTTG-3′ and 5′-CAAGTCTCAGGCTAAAGCAGGATG-3′ for CALM1 , and 5′-AGTCCTTCCACGATACCAAAGT-3′ and 5′-CATGAGAAGTATGACAACAGCCT-3′ for GAPDH. QRT-PCR was performed to determine the mRNA expression of CALM1 by a SYBR Premix Ex TaqTM II kit (TaKaRa Co., Dalian, China). Amplification was carried out under the following conditions: predenaturation at 95 °C for 30 s and 40 repetitive cycles at 95 °C for 30 s and at 60 °C for 34 s. Results of the qRT-PCR experiments were calculated using the 2 −∆∆ C t method.
DNA Isolation and Genotyping
EDTA-coated tubes were used to collect the fasting blood of all study subjects for genotyping. Total DNA was extracted with a whole blood genomic DNA kit (Aidlab biotechnologies CO. Ltd) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA concentration was determined by DNA spectrophotometer (ND-2000, NanoDrop, Wilmington USA). DNA was quantified using electrophoresis on 1.25% agarose gel. The primers used in PCR amplification were designed using Assay Designer version 3.1 and synthesized by Bomiao Biological Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). PCR amplification was performed using 5′-ACGTTGGATGAACTGGAACTCAGCATTCCC-3′ and 5′-ACGTTGGATGCCTGCAGCGTATCCTAAAAG-3′ as the forward and reverse primer pairs, respectively. Genotyping for CALM1 was determined by Sequenom MassARRAY system (Agena Bioscience) and conducted by laboratory technicians (Bomiao Biological Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) blinded to the case–control status. For quality control and validation purposes, genotyping on 5% of the samples was repeated, and a reproducibility of 100% was reported.
Statistical Analysis
Genetic association was processed by PLINK software ( http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/ ). Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was detected via a goodness-of-fit Chi-square ( χ 2 ) test. The genetic association of rs3179089 with IS susceptibility was evaluated in terms of the four genetic models (additive, dominant, recessive, and allelic models) through unconditional logistic regression analysis. The association of rs3179089 and quantitative traits was detected through linear regression analysis. The remaining statistical analyses were processed using SPSS version 16.0. Continuous variables were compared between different groups using the independent sample t test or Mann–Whitney U test. Categorical variables were compared between cases and controls using χ 2 test. Statistical significance was assumed at P < 0.05.
Results
Characteristics of Study Population
In this study, a total of 550 patients with IS (306 males and 244 females) and 550 control subjects (293 males and 257 females) were recruited. The mean age was 70.10 ± 8.82 years for the patients with IS and 69.23 ± 9.68 years for the control subjects. The mean age and male-to-female ratio were not different between controls and patients with IS ( χ 2 = − 1.560, P = 0.119 for age, χ 2 = 0.619, P = 0.468 for ratio). When the patients with IS were grouped according to the age of 65, a total of 182 patients with IS (96 males and 86 females) under the age of 65 and 378 patients with IS (168 males and 210 females) over 65 years old were recorded. The IS risk between males and females showed no difference among the age group of the test ( χ 2 = 3.399, P = 0.065). Patients with IS presented higher SBP ( P < 0.001), DBP ( P < 0.001), FPG ( P = 0.045), and PLT ( P = 0.044) levels and lower HDL-C ( P < 0.001), APO-A ( P < 0.001), and PTA ( P = 0.009) levels than those of the controls. Nevertheless, the P2hPG, TC, TG, LDL-C, VLDL, D-D, and FIB levels showed no different between two groups. (data not shown).
CALM1 mRNA Expression Comparison
As shown in Fig. 1 , CALM1 mRNA expression was significantly differential between patients with IS and control subjects, but highly expressed in patients with IS ( P = 0.006).

Genotype Frequency Distribution and HWE Test
A total of 549 patients with IS and 546 control subjects were successfully genotyped. The success rate of genotyping was > 95%. The genotypic distribution of CALM1 gene variant rs3179089 is presented in Table 1 . The genotype distribution of rs3179089 was in accordance with HWE in control group ( P > 0.050), and not different between patients with IS and control subjects ( χ 2 = 2.720, P = 0.256). When analyzed by gender, the genomic frequency distribution was significantly different between female patients with IS and control ( χ 2 = 6.043, P = 0.047). However, the genotypic frequencies of rs3179089 showed no difference was found between male patients with IS and control subjects ( χ 2 = 4.130, P = 0.127). Moreover, the CALM1 rs3179089 genotype distribution was not different between female and male groups ( χ 2 = 0.779, P = 0.056) (data not shown).

CALM1 rs3179089 Polymorphism and Risk of IS
The association between CALM1 rs3179089 polymorphism and risk of IS under four genetic models, namely, additive model (OR 1.12, P = 0.115; adjusted OR 1.18, P adj = 0.144), dominant model (OR 1.24, P = 0.099; adjusted OR 1.23, P adj = 0.122), recessive model (OR 1.19, P = 0.618; adjusted OR 1.15, P adj = 0.679), and allelic model (OR 1.20, P = 0.109), showed no significance. When analyzed by gender, rs3179089 polymorphism was associated with the risk of IS in female patients in recessive model. GG genotype significantly increased the risk of IS compared with that of the CC+GC genotype in females (OR 8.68, P = 0.042; adjusted OR 8.72, P adj = 0.042). Nonetheless, the three other genetic models showed no association between CALM1 rs3179089 polymorphism and the IS risk (Table 2 ).

CALM1 rs3179089 Polymorphism and IS-Related Risk Factors of Patients with IS
CALM1 rs3179089 polymorphism was associated positively with the D-D of patients with IS in recessive model ( β a = 3.24, P = 0.018; β b = 3.20, P adj = 0.019). Additionally, rs3179089 polymorphism was related positively to the TT of patients with IS in addictive ( β a = 2.32, P = 0.005, β b = 2.26, P adj = 0.006) and recessive model ( β a = 11.19, P = 0.001, β b = 11.13, P adj = 0.001) (Table 3 ). The patients with IS were divided into four groups according to the percentile of patients’ platelets. The TT and plasmas D-D among these four groups were compared. Results showed that the 25, 50, and 75% percentile PLT levels of patients with IS were 192, 228, and 271 × 10 9 /L, respectively (data not shown). In addition, no significant difference was observed in TT and plasmas D-D among these four groups ( χ 2 = 6.534, P = 0.088 for thrombin time, χ 2 = 6.859, P = 0.077 for plasmas D-D) (Table 4 ). Furthermore, rs3179089 polymorphism was not correlated with blood pressure, blood glucose, and serum lipid levels of patients with IS ( P > 0.050 for all) (Tables 5 , 6 , 7 ).

Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to analyze the relationship between CALM1 rs3179089 polymorphism and IS in Chinese Han population. Our findings revealed that CALM1 mRNA expression was differential between patients with IS and control subjects, thereby indicating that CALM1 expression is involved in the development of IS. Moreover, rs3179089 polymorphism in CALM1 was associated with increased susceptibility to IS in females and also correlated with blood coagulation of patients with IS. These finding increased our knowledge regarding the effect of CALM1 gene on the process of IS.
Calmodulin genes, which consist of CALM1, CALM2 , and CALM3 , encode ubiquitous calcium ion sensor CaM protein (Boczek et al. ). CaM can binds calcium ion and different signaling pathways involved in cell division (Moisoi et al. ), membrane trafficking (Tyteca et al. ), and PLT aggregation (Oury et al. ). CaM plasma levels are significantly higher in patients with stroke than those in normal controls (Yuan et al. ). However, the comparison of CALM1 mRNA expression between patients with IS and healthy subjects has not been reported yet. In present study, our results showed that CALM1 mRNA expression is higher in patients with IS than those in controls, which suggests that CALM1 is associated with the pathogenesis of IS.
Given that CALM1 expression is involved in the IS process, we further explored the effect of CALM1 variant on susceptibility to IS. Our results showed that rs3179089 polymorphism was correlated with increased susceptibility to IS in females. Similar to our finding, Luke et al. ( ) found that rs3814843 polymorphism in CALM1 is associated with increased risk of stroke. According to functional predictions of CALM1 rs3179089 and rs3814843 located regions in National Institute Environmental Health Sciences, rs3179089 and rs3814843 are located at 3′-UTR, and they possess miRNA binding sites. MiRNAs may regulate protein production by binding to the rs3179089 and rs3814843 of CALM1 and blocking translation and/or increasing degradation (Teng et al. ; Yin et al. ). Furthermore, calcium overload plays a vital role in IRI during ischemic brain damage (Moha Ou Maati et al. ). These two functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CALM1 may possibly affect the increased risk of IS, that is, rs3179089 and rs3814843 mutations may affect the translation of CaM protein, thereby influencing the intracellular calcium in the brain. Further studies on the mechanism underlying the affects of these two SNPs on susceptibility to IS risk are needed to confirm our findings.
In addition, we noticed that rs3179089 polymorphism affected IS risk in females but not in males, which indicates that the effect of rs3179089 polymorphism on IS risk presented sex difference. Similar to our findings, Wang et al. ( ) and Xu et al. ( ) reported that gene polymorphisms affect stroke risk in females. Nevertheless, Titov et al. ( ) and Gu et al. ( ) showed that gene variants are associated with the susceptibility to stroke in males. These findings may suggest that genetic susceptibility to stroke differs by sex and emphasize the importance of considering heterogeneity in genetic and stroke association studies. Stroke is a sex-specific disease (Poorthuis et al. ). The prevalence of stroke in women is lower than that in men (Rothwell et al. ; Lewsey et al. ; Wang et al. ), but stroke rates and mortality are higher among older women than those among older men (Turtzo and McCullough ; Petrea et al. ). These results suggested the innate differences in stroke occurrence between women and men. Sex differences to stroke may be due to the involvement of age, genetics, sex hormones, lifestyle, and other factors (Haast et al. ; Samai and Martin-Schild ).
In addition to genetic factors, conventional risk factors, such as high blood pressure (Han ; Saiz et al. ), high blood glucose (Chen et al. ; Xue et al. ), dyslipidemia (Kraft et al. ; Otite et al. ), and smoking (Otite et al. ), also contribute to the development of IS. To investigate in the relationship between CALM1 rs3179089 polymorphism and IS-related risk factors of patients with IS, we conducted a linear regression analysis. We discovered that CALM1 rs3179089 polymorphism was associated positively with D-D and TT of patients with IS, which indicates that rs3179089 polymorphism influences the blood coagulation of patients with IS. Coagulation is an integral part of the IS pathology. Previous research showed that calcium mobilization leads to cell activation, and eventually to microparticles (MPs) generation (VanWijk et al. ; Neri et al. ; Cordazzo et al. , ). MPs are small membrane vesicles (VanWijk et al. ), which are involved in a number of physiologically relevant responses, including cell–cell communication (Distler et al. ), inflammation (Distler and Distler ), and blood coagulation (Celi et al. ; Leroyer et al. ). Furthermore, MP may express tissue factor (Falati et al. ), which may increase its procoagulant potential. An increase in calcium ion may increase MP release (Neri et al. ), which adds to MP procoagulant potential. Thus, we deduced that the influence of CALM1 in blood coagulation of patients with IS may relate to the increase in MP release. Nonetheless, further studies are needed to verify our findings.
Our case–control study has few limitations, which have to be taken into account during interpretation of the results. Firstly, the p value of the association of CALM1 rs3179089 with IS risk is at the border of significance, which may be likely due to the small sample size. Larger sample size is needed to verify our findings. Secondly, IS risk factors, such as obesity, smoking, and alcohol were not collected, which limited our ability to evaluate gene–environment interaction. Thirdly, present study cohort consisted of mostly Chinese Han individuals, and to generalize the results for other ethnicities may be difficult.
Conclusion
CALM1 expression is altered in patients with IS. CALM1 rs3179089 polymorphism affects IS risk in females and influences blood coagulation of patients with IS in Chinese Han population.
