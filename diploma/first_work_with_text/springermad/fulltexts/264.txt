Introduction
Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. VTE affects 1–2% of the general population [ ]. Inferior vena cava filters (IVCF), first introduced in the 1970s, serve as a therapeutic adjunctive or alternative to anticoagulation therapy [ ].
Permanent IVCF are associated with long-term complications such as DVT, inferior vena cava (IVC) thrombosis and filter penetration, migration and fracture [ , , ]. In an effort to reduce these long-term risks, retrievable IVCFs were developed in the 1990s. Their introduction led to a dramatic increase in IVCF placement since associated long-term risks were perceived to be lower due to their retrievability [ , ]. Further, the largest increase in IVCF use has been due to filter insertion for prophylactic indications (i.e. no evidence of acute DVT or PE), a setting in which filter placement is controversial [ , , ]. However, IVCF retrieval was found to be attempted in only a minority of patients; and even then, technical issues prevented retrieval in 10–25% of the cases [ , , ]. Moreover, recent studies have shown that associated filter-related complications may be even more prevalent for the retrievable than the permanent IVCF [ , ]. These observations raise major concerns regarding the extensive utilization of IVCF and challenge their potential advantages.
Review of studies that revealed a high rate of filter placement for prophylactic indications, coupled with a low retrieval rate [ , ], prompted us to implement an institutional protocol aimed to improve these rates. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the impact of this protocol on the patterns of use and outcomes of IVCF.
Materials and methods
Institutional protocol implementation
An institutional protocol was developed during the early months of 2015 as a collaborative, multidisciplinary effort among the divisions of interventional radiology and coagulation service to prospectively follow patients who underwent IVCF placement (Fig. 1 ). A dedicated physician in the coagulation service was assigned the task of updating a prospective database in an Excel spreadsheet format (Microsoft, Redmond, Washington) of patients who underwent IVCF placement, and of coordinating their follow up and timely removal of IVCF if indicated. Patients were scheduled for a follow-up visit at the coagulation clinic at the time of their discharge. At such visit, a thrombosis specialist assigned a filter status from one of three options: declared permanent, candidate for immediate retrieval or indeterminate. The latter status dictated a repeat evaluation every 1–3 months until the filter was declared permanent or a candidate for retrieval. Patients were considered eligible for attempted retrieval if they had no contraindications for anticoagulants, or no apparent risk for VTE in cases in which the IVCF was placed prophylactically. As part of the follow-up process, a routine computed tomography scan of the abdomen, pelvis and legs, with the administration of intravenous contrast media, was performed in each patient, either before retrieval if eligible, or at the end of follow-up if the filter was deemed permanent. In patients at risk for contrast nephropathy or iodine allergy, computed tomography scan without contrast media, combined with lower extremity Doppler ultrasonography, were performed. One fellowship trained radiologist reviewed all available radiographic images. Findings evaluated were filter penetration (>3 mm outside the IVC wall), migration (>2 cm), tilt (>15°), fracture and deformity, according to the Society of Interventional Radiology guidelines [ ]. The aforementioned efforts were supplemented by a series of in-hospital lectures that discussed the indications for IVCF placement and their outcomes. These were held for all referring services in our medical center. During the period of protocol implementation, decisions regarding filter placement and retrieval were based on the recommendations of the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) and the American Society of Hematology (ASH) evidence-based guidelines for IVCF placement, as well as the FDA recommendation to remove a filter as soon as mechanical protection from PE is no longer necessary [ , , ].

Data collection
Our medical center is a large university hospital with a level I trauma center. Medical records of all consecutive patients who underwent IVCF insertion between January 1st, 2009 and December 31st, 2014 (pre-intervention group-PRE) before the protocol was established were retrospectively reviewed using the hospital electronic database. These data were compared to prospectively collected data of all patients who underwent IVCF placement between June 1st 2015 and May 31st 2016 (post-intervention group-POST), after the protocol was implemented. Data obtained included patient demographics (age and sex), oncologic comorbidities, the indication for IVCF placement (i.e. therapeutic-contraindications to anticoagulation, adjunct to full anticoagulation or catheter-directed thrombolysis therapy, or prophylactic in trauma patients or in peri-operative patients with no acute VTE), filter type, retrieval data, use of anticoagulation therapy, filter related complications and follow-up data. The primary outcomes compared between the PRE and POST groups were the overall number of IVCF placed, indications for IVCF placement and the retrieval rate. Institutional Review Board approval waiving informed consent was obtained for the study.
Statistical analysis
Patient characteristics are described as proportions for categorical variables and medians and interquartile range for continuous variables without a normal distribution. Significance between groups was assessed using the Chi square test and Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables, and the Mann–Whitney U test for continuous variables without a normal distribution. A two-sided P-value < 0.05 indicated statistical significance. The data were analyzed using Software Package for Statistics and Simulation (IBM SPSS version 22, IBM Corp, Armonk, NY).
Results
Filter placement
Overall, a total of 493 patients underwent filter insertion and were included in our study. During study period, all attempts at filter insertion were successful and made by the same interventional radiologists team at our medical center. All filters placed were retrievable. Four-hundred fifty-five patients underwent IVCF placement in the PRE group (average − 76 filters/year) compared to 38 patients in the POST group. This represents a decrease of 50% in the utilization of IVCF. In the vast majority of patients (n = 476, 96.6%), the filter type used was Celect (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Indiana). In the remaining 17 patients (3.4%), all in the PRE group, retrievable filters of different types were used ALN (Pyramed, Basingstoke Hampshire, United Kingdom), Optease (Cordis, Fremont, California), Gunther-Tulip [Cook Medical, Bloomington, Indiana].
Patient characteristics
A summary of patient clinical characteristics is shown in Table 1 . The median age of this cohort was 56 (IQR 34–72) years. A male predominance was observed, with 291 males (59.0%) and 202 females (41.0%). The clinical referring services for filter placement included medical and surgical intensive care units (n = 197, 40.0%), surgical division (e.g. neurosurgery, general surgery and orthopedics) (n = 156, 31.6%) and internal medicine division (e.g. internal medicine, oncology and hematology) (n = 140, 28.4%). The PRE and POST groups did not differ in terms of sex distribution, age at IVCF placement, presence of active cancer and referring clinical service (Table 1 ). One hundred and fifty-eight patients (32.0%) had major trauma. The PRE group comprised 152 trauma patients (33.4%), and the POST group, 6 (15.8%) (P = 0.03).

Indications for filter placement
Indications for filter placement varied significantly between the PRE and POST groups (Table 1 ). IVCF were more likely to be placed for therapeutic rather than prophylactic indications in the POST compared to the PRE group (P = 0.003). For the PRE group, 40.2% (n = 183) of IVCF were placed as prophylactic measure, against PE in the setting of trauma or peri-operatively; while 220 filters (48.4%) were placed in patients with acute VTE (DVT or PE), with a contraindication to full anticoagulant therapy. In contrast, in the POST group, 29 (76.3%) IVCF were placed due to evidence of VTE, with a concomitant contraindication to full anticoagulant therapy; and 8 (21.1%) were placed for prophylactic indications.
Filter retrieval
Retrieval was attempted in 99 patients (20.1%) and was technically successful in 83 (83.8%) of them. The overall removal rate was thus 16.8%. The rate of attempted retrieval was significantly higher in the POST than the PRE group: 60.5 (23/38) vs. 16.7% (76/455), P < 0.0001. The overall increase in attempted retrieval in the two periods was +43.8%.
In the PRE group, the rate of attempted retrieval was similar between trauma and non-trauma patients: 16.4 vs. 16.8%, P = 1.0; whereas in the POST group, the rate was significantly higher among trauma than non-trauma patients: 100 vs. 53.1%, P = 0.05. In the POST group, retrieval was attempted in 100% of patients who had the filters placed for prophylactic indications and 50.0% of those with filters placed for non-prophylactic indications (e.g. presence of acute VTE). This compared with 18.0 and 15.8%, respectively, in the PRE group, P < 0.0001 for both comparisons.
Of 455 filters placed in the PRE group, 379 (83.3%) were not retrieved due to- lack of follow-up in 262 (57.5%), death within 12 weeks after filter placement in 70 (15.4%) and ongoing contraindication to anticoagulation therapy in 47 (10.4%). Of 38 filters placed in the POST group, 10 (26.3%) were not retrieved due to death and ongoing contraindication to anticoagulation therapy in 5 (13.2%) patients each. All retained filters were originally placed for therapeutic indications (e.g. acute VTE with a contraindication to full anticoagulant therapy).
The median filter indwell time at the first retrieval attempt was 105 [IQR 64-165] days in the PRE group compared to 50 [IQR 26-104] days in the POST group (P = 0.006). Failure of attempted retrieval occurred at similar rates in the PRE (15.8%, 12/76) and POST groups (18.2%, 4/22) (P = 0.75). Reasons for failure of filter removal were filter adherence onto the IVC wall (n = 12), filter thrombosis (n = 2), filter migration into the liver (n = 1) and abnormal filter position (n = 1). The overall removal rate was 14.1% in the PRE and 50.0% in the POST group (P < 0.0001).
Filter-related thrombotic complications
Technical success was achieved in all filter insertions, with no procedural complications. No cases of insertion site thrombosis or bleeding were documented. Fifty-two patients (10.5% of all patients) had at least one filter-related complication, for a total of 67 complications, including- DVT (n = 39), IVCF thrombosis (n = 20) and PE (n = 8) (Table 2 ). The median time to complications was 96 [IQR 25-350] days. There was a trend towards a higher thrombotic complication rate in the PRE than the POST group of patients: 11.2 (51/455) vs. 2.6% (1/38), P = 0.16.

Imaging findings
A systematic imaging protocol was applied during the period of protocol implementation. All but the 9 (23.7%) patients in the POST group who died early had available imaging studies for analysis; the mean imaging follow up period was 4.6 ± 3.5 months. Filter penetration was noted in 21 patients (72.4%), with organ involvement in three of them two involving the duodenum and one the vertebral body. Filter migration was documented in nine patients (31.0%) and tilt in 2 (6.9%); there were no events of filter fracture or deformity. Among patients in the POST group for whom retrieval was attempted, the rate of filter migration, penetration or tilt was not different between those with successful or failed attempt: 73.7 vs. 75%, P = 1.0.
Follow up data
One-hundred and forty-two patients (28.8%) were followed at our coagulation clinic. Follow-up rates were significantly higher in the POST than the PRE group (100 vs. 22.9%, P < 0.0001). Nevertheless, even in the PRE group, significantly higher rates of attempted retrieval were observed in patients followed than not followed at our coagulation clinic: 43.3 vs. 8.8%, P < 0.001.
During the study period, 185 (37.5%) patients died. Of them, 59 (31.9%) had active cancer. Most deaths (60.5%, 112/185) occurred within the first year following filter placement. Survival rates were comparable at the end of follow-up between the patients in the PRE (61.5%, 280/455) and POST (73.7%, 28/38) groups (P = 0.16).
Discussion
The current study shows a different pattern in IVCF use and in outcomes of IVCF placement following implementation of an institutional protocol, compared to the preceding period. Specifically, the overall number of filter placements decreased, as did their prophylactic usage; while their retrieval rate increased.
Parallel with our results, a number of published studies have shown that retrieval rates of up to 60% can be achieved in selected populations of patients by instituting a variety of patient tracking and outreach programs, including dedicated IVCF clinics, automatic patient emailing and follow up letters [ , , , ]. However, those studies were designed to improve retrieval rates and focused on the post filter placement follow-up [ , , , ]. As such, the number of IVCF placed during the post-implementation period increased, with a larger proportion placed for prophylactic indications [ , , ]. According to the ACCP and ASH guidelines, prophylactic IVCF placement should be discouraged due to the lack of class I evidence in its support [ , ]. We addressed these shortcomings by establishing a protocol that included educating referring services regarding the indications for filter placement, and implementation of a multidisciplinary decision before each filter placement. The aim was to improve the selection of patients according to evidence-supported guidelines. The result was a decrease in the number of filters placed and reduction in the proportion of prophylactic insertions.
Despite shorter indwell times in the period following implementation of the protocol, the rate of failed retrieval was similar to that in the preceding period. This contrasts with a study that concluded that longer filter indwell times may negatively affect filter removal rates [ ]. However, our findings concur with a large recently published study that demonstrated, in a multivariate analysis, no association between dwell time and successful retrieval [ ]. Interestingly, for 87.5% of patients who experienced retrieval failure in the current study, the attempted retrieval was performed within the time period defined by the manufacturer for retrieval (up to 67 weeks) [ ]. Therefore, the actual safe dwell time remains undefined. Moreover, the substantial proportion of removal failure found in this study, which is similar to other reports, further highlights that selection of patients for filter placement is critical [ ].
Multiple factors may account for the previously reported low rates of filter retrieval; the most common are patient loss to follow-up and lack of follow up [ ]. Higher rates of IVCF retrieval were previously shown in patients followed at a coagulation clinic [ , ]. In the present study, the IVCF retrieval rate increased by almost fourfold after the establishment of a protocol that ensured follow-up in a coagulation clinic of all patients who underwent filter placement. The similar rate of failed retrieval, before and after implementation of the protocol, suggests that this improved removal rate did not result from improved technical procedure, but rather from more meticulous patient management and follow-up. Follow-up and retrieval rates were 100% for the trauma patients. This is remarkable since these patients represent a unique group that is difficult to follow, with lower rates of attempted retrieval [ , , ]. In addition, retrieval was attempted for all filters placed for prophylactic indications; and all retained filters had been placed for therapeutic indications. We believe that regardless of the referring service, patients who undergo IVCF placement should be followed by thrombosis specialists, as dictated by our protocol. Heightened awareness of the hematology service, in particular the thrombosis unit, for IVCF associated complications, may lead to enhanced diligence in the management of these patients [ ].
The current study showed a trend toward lower rates of thrombotic complications in patients treated after implementation of the protocol. The higher IVCF removal rate observed in this group seems to account for this finding, as IVCF retainment has been shown to be associated with a significantly higher rate of DVT [ ]. Despite the encouraging results regarding thrombotic complications, the current study was not designed to assess the role of protocol implementation on this outcome. This matter should be directly addressed in future studies.
Study limitations
Limitations of the present study include biases inherent in a retrospective review, such as was performed to assess patient data for the period prior to the implementation of the protocol. Some of these patients may have presented with complications or had their filters removed elsewhere. In addition, the complication rate is likely underestimated in this group, as systematic imaging surveillance was not routinely performed. Finally, our study was performed in a single-center, which may limit the general applicability of our results to hospitals with different patient populations. Nevertheless, the strengths of our study include its large cohort of patients at a level I trauma center and the long follow-up period.
Conclusions
This current study demonstrates that an institutional prospective protocol can improve both patterns of use and retrieval rates of IVCF. Maintaining a prospective protocol appears to play a paramount role in optimizing the appropriate use of IVCF and in facilitating retrieval when possible. Prospective studies with longer follow-up period are needed to confirm our findings and better delineate the effect of an institutional protocol on long-term IVCF-related complications.
