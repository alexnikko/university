Introduction
Huntington’s disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder with a characteristic phenotype including chorea and dystonia, incoordination, cognitive decline, and psychiatric symptoms [ ]. It is caused by an abnormal expansion of a CAG codon in exon 1 of the huntingtin gene [ ]. Neuropathological hallmarks include intranuclear aggregates of mutant huntingtin and selective neurodegeneration of striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) [ , ], which are the principal projection neurons within the striatum. Survival and maintenance of MSNs are especially dependent on the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) signaling pathway [ , ], and the selective vulnerability in HD has been linked to reduced neurotrophic support caused by reduced levels of BDNF [ , , , ]. Therefore, exogenous BDNF administration or pharmacological treatments that raise BDNF levels have been proposed and extensively studied to slow or prevent the HD disease progression. However, these therapeutic strategies only ameliorate or partially improve morphological phenotypes or motor and cognitive behavior in different HD mouse models [ , , , ]. Several studies suggest that BDNF signaling deficits can be related not only to altered BDNF delivery but also to inappropriate levels of expression or activation of its receptors, TrkB and/or p75 NTR [ , , , , , , ]. TrkB is a member of the neurotrophin tyrosine receptor kinase family that activates cytosolic signaling cascades to promote survival and maintain neurochemical and morphological properties of neurons. On the other hand, BDNF binds also to p75 NTR , a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily [ ]. p75 NTR can potentiate or reduce Trks signaling, promoting or hampering cell growth and survival depending on the cellular context and Trks or neurotrophins abundance, but it can also act independently activating NF-Kβ, c-Jun kinase (JNK), and RhoA/ROCK pathways [ , , ]. p75 NTR , which is known to be induced in several disease conditions, can activate degenerative pathways, particularly in states in which deficiency of neurotrophins or Trks occurs [ , ]. Importantly, it has been demonstrated that signaling via either TrkB or p75 NTR receptors is compromised in HD. Downregulation of TrkB receptor levels or defects in TrkB signaling have been reported in HD cellular models and HD mice brain [ , , , , , , ] while increased levels of p75 NTR have been demonstrated in the striatum and hippocampus of different HD mouse models [ , , , ]. These observations support the idea that a correctable defect in the response to BDNF underlies striatal dysfunction in HD. However, no studies have examined the precise contribution of the BDNF/TrkB/p75 NTR pathway in the onset of HD motor coordination deficits. Based on these previous reports, we hypothesized that motor behavioral abnormalities in HD are directly associated with improper expression of p75 NTR , TrkB, and BDNF. Therefore, neuroprotective therapy for HD must involve the reestablishment of not only BDNF but also the complete BDNF/TrkB/p75 NTR system. To test our hypothesis, motor behavior and striatal neuropathology were evaluated along the disease progression in double-mutant mice, expressing one copy of mutant huntingtin but heterozygous for p75 NTR (KI:p75 +/− ). Our results showed that genetic normalization of p75 NTR expression in mutant Hdh Q7/Q111 (KI) mice delayed by several months the onset of motor coordination deficits and striatal neuropathology. This improvement might be attributed to the prevention of BDNF/TrkB/p75 NTR imbalance, the normalization of BDNF-TrkB-phospholipase C-gamma (PLCγ) signaling, and/or the attenuation of the p75 NTR -associated JNK pathway. Importantly, at 10 months of age, downregulation of p75 NTR is not enough to achieve this improvement supporting the hypothesis that proper levels of TrkB and BDNF are also needed to prevent HD progression. We validated this hypothesis by showing that chronic infusion of fingolimod (FTY720) improved motor coordination behavior and striatal neuropathology in HD transgenic mice which were associated with normalization of p75 NTR levels in the BDNF/TrkB/p75 NTR system.

Normalization of p75NTR Levels in the Striatum of KI Mice Delays the Onset of Motor Coordination Deficits
We have described that mutant KI mice manifest motor coordination impairments at the age of 8 months [ ]. Given the critical role of p75 NTR in HD pathology, we evaluated whether normalization of striatal p75 NTR levels prevents these motor deficits. To address this question, levels of p75 NTR were normalized in KI mice by cross-mating of Hdh Q7/Q111 with p75 NTR /Exon III +/− mice (p75 +/− mice) to obtain double-mutant mice (KI:p75 +/− ). First, p75 NTR levels were analyzed by Western Blot in striatal extracts from wild type (WT), p75 +/− , KI, and KI:p75 +/− mice. As expected, quantification of band intensities revealed a significant increase of p75 NTR in KI mice, which was significantly reversed in KI:p75 +/− mice at the three different ages evaluated (6, 8, and 10 months) (Fig. 1 a). In contrast, no increased expression of p75 NTR was observed in the cortex of HD mice according to previous published data by our group [ ]. Therefore, both p75 +/− and KI:p75 +/− mice presented reduced cortical p75 NTR levels compared with WT mice (Supplemental Fig. 1A ). Next, motor coordination was evaluated. Mice were first trained at 10 rpm during three consecutive days (Fig. 1 b), and performance in the rotarod at 10 and 24 rpm was assessed longitudinally in WT, KI, p75 +/− , and KI:p75 +/− mice from 7 to 12 months of age (Fig. 1 c). Motor coordination was severely impaired in KI mice starting at 8 months of age and worsening thereafter, with a number of falls significantly higher than WT mice along trials (Fig. 1 c). We observed a significant reduction of number of falls in KI:p75 +/− mice compared with KI mice at 8 and 9 months when evaluated at 24 rpm while at 10 rpm, these differences were significant only at 9 months. Similar results were obtained when spontaneous locomotor activity was measured in the open field (Fig. 1 d). KI mice manifested a significant reduction in the distance traveled compared with WT mice at 8 and 10 month of age while KI:p75 +/− mice only displayed significant differences at 10 months of age. At 8 months, performance in open field by KI:p75 +/− mice was comparable to WT mice, traveling more distance than KI mice, although these differences were not statistically significant ( P = 0.053). Altogether, these data indicate that normalization of striatal p75 NTR levels in KI mice delays the onset of motor coordination impairments.

Normalization of p75NTR Levels in the Striatum of KI Mice Delays Striatal Neuropathology
Reduced levels of striatal proteins such as dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein Mr 32 kDa (DARPP32) [ ], phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A) [ ], or adenosine receptor type 2A (A2AR) [ ] have been reported in several experimental models of HD and associated with striatal dysfunction. In accordance with these data, a significant decrease in these three proteins was found in KI striatal extracts at 6, 8, and 10 months of age (Fig. 2 a–c). Interestingly, in KI:p75 +/− mice, the levels of these striatal markers were preserved until 10 months of age, when a similar reduction was observed. Our results support the idea that striatal pathology can be delayed by normalization of p75 NTR levels. To further confirm this hypothesis, two other neuropathological hallmarks of HD striatal dysfunction, such as mutant huntingtin (mHtt) aggregates [ , ] and dendritic spine alterations [ , ], were analyzed in mice aged between 7 and 10 months. First, mHtt aggregates were detected by EM48 diaminobenzidine staining in the striatum of KI and KI:p75 +/− mice (Fig. 3 a). A significant reduction in both the number of positive nuclear inclusions and EM48 labeling intensity (staining index) was found in KI:p75 +/− compared with KI mice between 8 and 9 months (Fig. 3 a), while similar aggregate density and staining index were observed at 10 months in both KI and KI:p75 +/− mice (Fig. 3 b). Next, DiOlistic labeling was performed to analyze dendritic spine density in fixed brain slices obtained from WT, p75 +/− , KI, and KI:p75 +/− at 7–8 months (Fig. 3 c) and 10 months of age (Fig. 3 d). The number of spines per micrometer of dendrite length was significantly reduced in KI mice at the different ages evaluated, while a significant increase was observed in KI:p75 +/− mice when compared with KI mice. Surprisingly, p75 +/− presented a significant increase in spine density when compared with WT mice at 7–8 months, while only an increasing trend at 10 months of age. These results are in accordance with the negative role of p75 NTR in dendritic spine density previously reported [ ]. Interestingly, at earlier disease stages (3 months), no differences were observed between genotypes supporting the hypothesis that p75 NTR downregulation in the striatum prevents the loss of dendritic spines during the course of the disease (Supplemental Fig. 2 ). Altogether, these data suggest that normalization of p75 NTR levels contributes to delay the onset of striatal neuropathology, in accordance with the delayed onset of motor deficits described above.

Normalization of p75NTR in the Striatum of KI Mice Delays the Reduction of BDNF/TrkB Expression
Survival and maintenance of MSNs are especially dependent on the BDNF-TrkB signaling pathway [ , ]. Low striatal BDNF protein levels have been reported in postmortem HD brain samples and in several HD mouse models [ , , , ]. Moreover, we have demonstrated an imbalance of p75 NTR and TrkB expression in mouse and human HD brain associated with increased striatal susceptibility [ ]. Therefore, we have examined whether normalization of striatal p75 NTR expression could affect BDNF and TrkB levels in the striatum. Total levels of BDNF (tBDNF) including both BDNF isoforms, the precursor proBDNF and the mature (m)BDNF, were assessed by ELISA (Fig. 4 a), while only mBDNF was measured by Western Blot analysis (Fig. 4 b). The specificity of the commercial anti-BDNF antibodies used in the study was validated by Western Blot using brain lysates from homozygous and heterozygous BDNF mice and recombinant BDNF as a positive control (Supplemental Fig. 3 ). In line with previous published data in other HD mouse models [ , ], 8- and 10-month-old KI mice exhibited a robust reduction in striatal tBDNF levels analyzed by ELISA (Fig. 4 a). Although this reduction in tBDNF could be attributed to a reduction in both BDNF isoforms, it has previously been shown that proBDNF is barely detectable in WT and HD striatum [ ]. Importantly, decreased tBDNF levels could not be observed in KI:p75 +/− mice until the age of 10 months with comparable tBDNF levels between KI:p75 +/− and WT mice at 6 and 8 months of age. However, no statistical differences were detected between 8-month-old KI:p75 +/− and KI (Fig. 4 a). Interestingly, the observed decrease in tBDNF levels by ELISA correlates well with the significant reduction of mBDNF protein revealed by Western Blot in 8-month-old KI mice (Fig. 4 b). Furthermore, a significant increase in mBDNF levels was observed in KI:p75 +/− at 8 months but not at 10 months of age compared to KI mice (Fig. 4 b), indicating that normalization of p75 NTR levels delays mBDNF downregulation in KI:p75 +/− mice. It is noteworthy that we observed a trend toward an age-dependent reduction of tBDNF levels in the four genotypes which is consistent with previous studies that have shown loss of BDNF gene transcription with aging [ , , , , ]. Since cortical afferents are the main source of striatal BDNF [ ], we further evaluated mBDNF levels in cortical extracts from WT, p75 +/− , KI, and KI:p75 +/− at 6, 8, and 10 months of age (Supplemental Fig. 1B ). Our results demonstrated unaltered mBDNF levels between genotypes at any of the evaluated ages suggesting that cortical mBDNF production is not affected neither by upregulation of p75 NTR in the striatum of KI mice nor by the genetic normalization of its levels in KI:p75 +/− . Similarly to striatal BDNF, a reduction in full-length TrkB levels was observed in KI mice from 8 months of age while such decrease could not be detected in KI:p75 +/− mice until 10 months (Fig. 5 a). No changes in the levels of the truncated TrkB isoform were observed (Fig. 5 b). Next, activation of TrkB was analyzed by quantification of TrkB phosphorylation at tyrosine residues 816 (Y816), which lies within the C-terminus of TrkB-binding phospholipase C-gamma (PLCγ) and 515 (Y515), mediating SHC binding (Fig. 5 c, d) [ ]. A significant decrease in Y816 phosphorylation was found in KI mice at 8 months of age which could not be detected in KI:p75 +/− mice until the age of 10 months (Fig. 5 c). The levels of phosphorylated TrkB at the Y816 site in KI:p75 +/− were significantly higher in comparison with KI mice at the age of 6 and 8 months. No significant differences on Y515 phosphorylation were found between genotypes (Fig. 5 d). Taken together, these data indicate that BDNF-TrkB deficits along with altered TrkB phosphorylation status can be delayed in KI mice through normalization of p75 NTR levels. Fig. 4 Delayed reduction of striatal BDNF levels by normalization of p75 NTR expression in KI mice.

Impaired TrkB-Induced Phosphorylation of PLCγ Can Be Delayed in KI Mice by Normalization of Striatal p75NTR Levels
Since levels of TrkB and BDNF are decreased in the striatum of KI mice from 8 months of age, we evaluated the three major downstream signaling pathways associated with TrkB activation: PI3K/Akt, MAP/ERK1/2, and PLC/PKC [ ]. Western Blot analysis of striatal tissue at different ages revealed an increased activation of Akt at 8 and 10 months of age in KI mice (Fig. 6 a). This sustained Akt activation is consistent with previous results shown in knock-in and transgenic HD mouse models [ ] and has been considered a pro-survival mechanism associated to reduced levels of PHLPP1 phosphatase [ ] and to an abnormal NMDA receptor activation [ ]. No changes in ERK activation were observed in the striatum of KI mice until the age of 10 months, when a slight but not significant decrease was observed (Fig. 6 b). Importantly, a significant reduction on PLCγ activation was present from 6 months of age (Fig. 6 c). Because aberrant levels or activation of p75 NTR can alter TrkB signaling [ ], we also investigated these pathways in KI:p75 +/− mice. pAkt and pERK levels where comparable between KI and KI:p75 +/− mice, indicating that these pathways are not affected by normalization of p75 NTR levels (Fig. 6 a, b). In contrast, reduced pPLCγ levels were restored in KI:p75 +/− mice at 6 and 8 months but not at 10 months of age, when phosphorylation of PLCγ was reduced to similar levels of KI mice (Fig. 6 c). Since Akt, ERK, and PLCγ pathways via TrkB signaling have been shown to phosphorylate CREB, promoting transcription of its target genes, such as BDNF, we also evaluated phosphorylation levels of CREB. However, no differences were observed between genotypes at any age evaluated (Supplemental Fig. 4 ). Altogether, these data demonstrate that normalization of p75 NTR levels in the striatum of KI mice delays the deficient activation of PLCγ induced by TrkB. Fig. 6 Impaired PLCγ activation can be delayed by normalization of p75 NTR expression in KI mice.

Normalization of p75NTR in the Striatum of KI Mice Delays the Upregulation of JNK Activation
Activation of cell death signaling pathways, including JNK upregulation, has previously been reported in different HD models by our group and others [ , , ]. Given that p75 NTR -mediated neurodegeneration has been associated with JNK activation [ ], we next examined whether normalization of p75 NTR levels in KI mice was accompanied by a reduction in JNK phosphorylation. Western Blot analysis of striatal extracts from WT, p75 +/− , KI, and KI:p75 +/− mice revealed a significant increase in pJNK levels at 8 and 10 months of age in KI mice but not in KI:p75 +/− animals, although no significant differences were observed between KI and KI:p75 +/− (Fig. 7 a). Since JNK activation mediates direct phosphorylation of its substrate c-Jun, we assessed levels of phospho-c-Jun (Ser63) (pc-Jun) by Western Blot analysis. A significant increase in this pro-apoptotic transcription factor was detected at 10 months of age in KI mice while only a trend was observed at 6 and 8 months (Fig. 7 b). Interestingly, pc-Jun was significantly reduced at 6 and 8 months in KI:p75 +/− mice in comparison with KI mice. To determine whether reduced JNK activation was also associated with inhibition of caspase-3 activity, the caspase-3 cleaved spectrin fragment SBDP120 was analyzed by Western Blot. No significant changes in SBDP120 levels were found between genotypes (Fig. 7 c). These findings indicate that activation of JNK apoptotic pathway can be partially prevented by normalization of p75 NTR expression in KI mice. Despite the activation of these death signaling pathways, it is widely accepted that the Hdh Q7/Q111 mouse model is spared of evident neuronal loss. Indeed, we found no cleaved caspase-3 positive-stained cells in corticostriatal slices from WT and KI mice (Supplemental Fig. 5 ), which confirms previous studies showing unaltered NeuN+ neuronal density in the striatum of Hdh Q7/Q111 mice for up to 12 months [ ]. Supporting the lack of neurodegeneration in this HD mouse model, no changes in cortical thickness were neither observed between genotypes (Supplemental Fig. 6 ). Overall, these results showing no neuronal death in our Hdh Q7/Q111 HD model indicate that the early increase in p75 NTR levels could lead to neuronal dysfunction without affecting cell viability.

Chronic Administration of Fingolimod Prevents TrkB/p75NTR Imbalance and Ameliorates Neuropathology in the Striatum of R6/1 Mice
We have previously demonstrated that chronic treatment with fingolimod (FTY720), a sphingosine-1 phosphate receptor modulator, prevented the reduction of TrkB and BDNF levels and normalized the expression of p75 NTR in the hippocampus of R6/1 transgenic mice [ ]. Given that genetic normalization of striatal p75 NTR expression delays BDNF/TrkB/p75 NTR signaling alterations and improve neuropathology, we wondered whether FTY720 administration was also able to prevent striatal pathology in HD mice. To this aim, we used the R6/1 mouse model that displays earlier onset and faster disease progression than KI mice and presents a good correlation between the onset of motor impairments [ ] and the upregulation of p75 NTR in the striatum at 12 weeks of age [ ]. Mice were treated with FTY720 from presymptomatic (8 weeks) to symptomatic (20 weeks) stages, when R6/1 mice manifest overt motor and cognitive behavioral deficits. In agreement with previous findings [ , , , ], R6/1 mice at the age of 20 weeks did not show reduced levels of mature BDNF and full-length TrkB but a trend toward an increase in p75 NTR protein levels ( P = 0.052; Fig. 8 a). Notably, treatment with FTY720 completely prevented p75 NTR upregulation, showing R6/1-treated mice similar levels of p75 NTR compared with WT mice. These results demonstrate that chronic administration of FTY720 prevents the TrkB/p75 NTR imbalance in the striatum of HD mice. Next, we analyzed whether normalization of this imbalance could ameliorate striatal neuropathology. The presence of mHtt aggregates was evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis. Treatment with FTY720 significantly decreased the number of EM48 positive nuclear inclusions (Fig. 8 b). Moreover, in accordance with the partial recovery of DARPP32 expression observed in the striatum of KI:p75 +/− mice (Fig. 2 a), FTY720 treatment also prevented DARPP32 reduction, as shown by the increase in protein levels exhibited by FTY720-treated R6/1 mice compared with vehicle-treated animals (Fig. 8 c). Altogether, these data demonstrate that regulation of p75 NTR levels by therapeutic strategies like FTY720 can maintain BDNF/TrkB/p75 NTR balance preventing striatal neuropathology.

Chronic Administration of Fingolimod Ameliorates Motor Coordination Deficits in R6/1 Mice
We have previously demonstrated that genetic normalization of p75 NTR expression delays the onset of motor coordination deficits in KI mutant mice. Given that FTY720 treatment restores the balance between TrkB and p75 NTR expression in R6/1 mice, we next assessed the potential of FTY720 to prevent or ameliorate motor abnormalities. Behavioral analysis using the rotarod at 24 rpm revealed that R6/1 mice start showing significant differences from WT mice at 14 weeks of age (Fig. 8 d). Remarkably, the beneficial effects of the compound on motor function and coordination were first observed at this age, after 6 weeks of treatment (Fig. 8 d). Chronic infusion of FTY720 significantly improved the rotarod performance of R6/1 manifested as a decrease in the number of falls compared with vehicle-treated R6/1 mice. No significant differences were observed between vehicle- and FTY720-treated WT mice. Overall, these results indicate that HD striatal neuropathology and motor coordination disturbances are dependent on the balance between TrkB and p75 NTR expression.
Discussion
The present study demonstrates the critical contribution of the BDNF/TrkB/p75 NTR pathway to the onset of motor deficits and striatal neuropathology in HD mice. Longitudinal motor behavioral evaluation of full-length HD mice reveals a correlation between the onset of motor coordination abnormalities, the reduction in BDNF and TrkB levels, and the increase in p75 NTR protein levels. Accordingly, genetic normalization of p75 NTR expression in KI mutant mice delayed the onset of motor deficits and striatal dysfunction likely by restoring the balance between BDNF/TrkB/p75 NTR expression and signaling. It is important to keep in mind that KI and R6/1 mice show increased levels of p75 NTR in the striatum and hippocampus but not in the cortex [ ]. This finding supports our hypothesis that the normalization of p75 NTR in the striatum of KI mice is the responsible of the delay in motor deficits. Similarly, as previously reported by our group, hippocampal memory and synaptic plasticity deficits in KI mice can be prevented by the genetic downregulation of p75 NTR in the hippocampus [ ]. Furthermore, we also found that chronic pharmacological treatment with fingolimod improved motor behavior and striatal neuropathology in HD transgenic mice by normalizing p75 NTR protein levels and therefore correcting the BDNF/TrkB/p75 NTR imbalance.
Deficits of neurotrophic support to striatal neurons in HD have recently been associated not only to reduced levels of BDNF but also to impaired BDNF signaling and altered expression of BDNF receptors [ , , , , ]. Besides these new pieces of evidence, no studies so far have explored the contribution of deficient BDNF signaling or impaired balance of BDNF receptors (TrkB and p75 NTR ) to the onset of motor coordination deficits. To address this question, we have used double-mutant mice in which p75 NTR expression has been normalized and we have evaluated many outcome measures such as motor coordination, striatal pathology and biochemical analysis along disease progression. Although in some measures 8-month-old KI:p75 +/− mice did not perform significantly better than the KI, they did not show significant differences compared with WT neither. Then, our results show that normalization of p75 NTR expression in KI mice delays from 6 to 10 months of age the onset of motor coordination deficits and striatal pathology, as well as the reduction in TrkB and BDNF protein levels. Interestingly, downregulation of p75 NTR levels at 10 months of age fails to prevent striatal neuronal dysfunction and loss of motor coordination in KI mice most likely because the reduction in TrkB and BDNF levels can no longer be blocked. These results suggest that a correct balance in BDNF/TrkB/p75 NTR levels is critical to support the neurotrophic signaling in medium spiny neurons (MSNs) needed to control motor function. Certainly, it is well known that the survival, maintenance, and function of MSNs are particularly dependent on the BDNF-TrkB signaling pathway [ , ]. Consistently, key striatal-enriched proteins such as DARPP32, A2AR, and PDE10A whose expression is reduced in HD [ , , ] were preserved as long as the BDNF/TrkB/p75 NTR imbalance was prevented. Importantly, the function of these proteins is critical to regulate striatonigral and striatopallidal downstream signaling cascades that work for the fine-tuning of movement [ , , ]. Thus, A2AR is required for most of the synaptic functions of BDNF/TrkB [ , , ] while DARPP32, a key integrator of dopamine and glutamate neurotransmission in MSNs [ , , ], participates through interaction with adducin to modulate dendritic spine stability [ ]. Indeed, in our double-mutant KI:p75 +/− mice, normalization of p75 NTR levels prevented the loss of striatal dendritic spines. Altogether, these findings support the idea that abnormalities in the BDNF/TrkB/p75 NTR signaling may contribute to reduce the expression of key striatal proteins leading to neuronal dysfunction and subsequent motor deficits in HD. As previously discussed, BDNF/TrkB pathway and striatal integrity cannot be restored by normalization of p75 NTR at late disease stages in KI:p75 +/− , probably due to other pathological mechanisms triggered by mutant huntingtin, such as progressive transcriptional alterations, which have been already described in our Hdh Q7/Q111 mouse model [ ].
It remains unclear how the increment in p75 NTR found in the striatum and the consequent restoration in the double-mutant mice can affect striatal mBDNF. In agreement with our results, several studies have described decreased striatal mBDNF levels without cortical BDNF alterations [ , , ]. These results suggested that anterograde transport of mBDNF and/or proBDNF from cortex to striatum could be impaired [ , ]. Since it is well known that p75 NTR is involved in axonal degeneration [ ], it is possible to hypothesize that normalization of p75 NTR in HD mice could contribute to reduce the axonal pathology in corticostriatal connections present in HD mice [ , ] and restore BDNF transport. Further studies would be necessary to elucidate this potential mechanism.
Beyond the observed alterations of BDNF and TrkB protein levels, we found that the onset of motor deficits and the reduction of striatal-enriched proteins in KI mice were also associated with a specific decrease in TrkB-PLCγ signaling. Thus, in line with previous studies in other HD mouse models [ , ], reduced phosphorylation of PLCγ and TrkB at Y816, the tyrosine residue associated with PLCγ activation, was observed in KI mice along the disease progression. In contrast, TrkB phosphorylation at Y515 remained unchanged between genotypes. This differential phosphorylation of TrkB tyrosine residues could be the result of BDNF-independent molecular mechanisms already described in several studies [ , , , ]. Interestingly and consistent with a delay in motor dysfunction, impaired TrkB-PLCγ signaling was also delayed by normalization of p75 NTR levels. This data might be explained by the restored BDNF levels observed in double-mutant KI:p75 +/− mice and/or by a direct effect of p75 NTR on TrkB phosphorylation sites. Indeed, previous studies have already reported attenuation of BDNF-mediated autophosphorylation of TrkB by p75 NTR [ ] and increased TrkB phosphorylation has been observed under p75 NTR masking conditions in hippocampal neurons [ ]. Evidence showing that p75 NTR directly interacts with Trk receptors [ ] leads to speculate that binding of BDNF to p75 NTR directly affects conformation and, therefore, the affinity of TrkB for BDNF. However, this crosstalk between p75 NTR and TrkB receptor affecting BDNF signaling in HD needs to be further explored.
Altered neuronal function in different brain disorders has been associated with abnormal activation of PLCγ resulting in impaired neuronal activity and ultimately cell death [ ]. In our HD model, reduced PLCγ activity might contribute to striatal pathology by decreasing striatal protein markers such as DARPP32 [ , ] and A2AR [ ]. On the other hand, due to the role of PLCγ signaling in the functional changes of spine actin cytoskeleton [ , , ], the decreased striatal spine density detected in mutant KI mice could be a consequence of PLCγ activity downregulation.
Besides the recovery of the pro-survival signaling pathway PLCγ following normalization of p75 NTR expression, we also demonstrated reduced activation of the pro-apoptotic JNK pathway. Based in our previous published data showing that the increase in p75 NTR levels is associated with DARPP32+ striatal neurons [ ], we can hypothesize that the observed increase in JNK activation could also occur in these neurons. It is noteworthy that even though in the p75 +/− heterozygous mice a dose-dependent effect of p75 NTR gene copy number on pJNK levels would be expected, we observed that p75 +/− mice mostly display phenotypes similar to WT. We hypothesize that the activation or inhibition of specific pathways are dependent on an “optimal range” of p75 NTR expression levels. Moreover, we cannot exclude that additional pathways could regulate JNK activation since p75 NTR levels are increased at 6 months of age in KI mice striatum but JNK activity is unaltered at this age. The involvement of JNK in mHtt-mediated striatal neurotoxicity is supported by a number of different in vitro and in vivo studies [ , , ]. Activation of cellular stress response manifested as JNK phosphorylation has been reported in cells expressing polyglutamine aggregates while inhibition of JNK activation slowed and reduced the formation of such polyQ-protein aggregates [ , , ]. In this view, we propose that attenuation of JNK signaling activation by normalization of p75 NTR expression might also contribute to reduce the number of intranuclear mHtt aggregates observed in the striatum of double-mutant KI:p75 +/− mice. Indeed, it has been recently shown that modulation of p75 NTR by small molecules that specifically enhances pro-survival downstream signals and inhibits pro-apoptotic JNK activation ameliorates HD striatal pathology [ ]. Moreover, JNK activation has also been shown to mediate the inhibitory effect of mutant huntingtin on axonal transport [ ]. Therefore, the present data showing JNK activity downregulation underlying the beneficial effect of p75 NTR normalization on KI mice pathology might explain why a variety of therapies based on neurotrophic factors partially improve mutant huntingtin-induced pathology in other mouse HD models. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude that other pathways associated with p75 NTR signaling, like RhoA/ROCK cascade [ , ], could also be involved. Aberrant activity of p75 NTR in HD mice increases RhoA activation leading to impaired synaptic plasticity [ , , ], and importantly, inhibition of the ROCK pathway enhances mHtt degradation and reduces aggregation while improving motor function in R6/2 mice [ , , , ]. These findings suggest that the reduction of mHtt aggregates could be due to the inhibition of JNK, as well as RhoA/ROCK signaling, once levels of p75 NTR are normalized.
We further confirmed the critical contribution of the proper balance of BDNF/TrkB/p75 NTR to motor deficits in HD mice by using a pharmacological approach. Fingolimod (FTY720) is an immunomodulator known to improve BDNF release in the striatum, to rescue motor deficits in mouse models of Rett’s syndrome and HD [ , ], and to prevent cognitive deficits and imbalance of BDNF receptors in the hippocampus of R6/1 mice [ ]. Chronic administration of fingolimod improved motor function in 20-week-old R6/1 mice, reduced mHtt aggregates and increased DARPP32 expression, in agreement with previous data in R6/2 mice [ ]. Notably, FTY720 treatment also normalized p75 NTR levels, aberrantly expressed in R6/1 mice between 12 and 30 weeks of age [ ]. BDNF levels were not found significantly decreased in the striatum of R6/1 mice at 20 weeks of age. While this finding is consistent with previous reports [ ], other studies have found decreased BDNF mRNA or protein levels at the same age analyzed [ , ]. The addition of behavioral tasks prior to obtaining samples, the use of different genetic backgrounds, or the diversity in commercial antibodies against BDNF could account for the observed different results. No changes in TrkB levels at 20 weeks of age between WT and R6/1 mice were observed neither, consistent with previous studies reporting downregulation at 30 weeks of age [ ]. We cannot rule out that other mechanisms modulated by FTY720 might contribute to the therapeutic benefits observed in R6/1 mice. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that FTY720 can increase phosphorylation of mutant huntingtin at serine 13/16 residues to attenuate protein toxicity [ ], as well as modulate CREB expression [ ] or inhibit class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) in neurons [ ]. Nevertheless, based on our findings, we hypothesize that the improvement in motor coordination observed in FTY720-treated R6/1 mice can be mainly attributed to prevention of BDNF/TrkB/p75 NTR imbalance.
It can be argued that the genetic or pharmacological normalization of p75 NTR is not exclusively neuronal since expression of p75 NTR in astrocytes has been reported following different brain injuries [ , ]. However, we have previously demonstrated that the aberrant p75 NTR increase in the striatum and the hippocampus of the Hdh Q111 mice is neuron-specific [ , ], supporting the idea that normalization of p75 NTR contributes to restore BDNF/TrkB signaling in neurons.
In conclusion, this work shed new light on how the imbalance of the BDNF/TrkB/p75 NTR system can affect striatal neuropathology and motor behavior in HD. It demonstrates that this imbalance leads to impaired BDNF signaling trough reduced TrkB-PLCγ pathway and increased JNK activation. More importantly, we show that normalization of p75 NTR expression delays such impairments that follow the well-described “dying back” pattern of neuronal degeneration in HD [ ]. Our study further supports the role of p75 NTR signaling in striatal pathophysiology highlighting the potential benefits of restoring BDNF/TrkB/p75 NTR balance for preventing, delaying, or reversing the progression of HD pathology.
Methods
Animals
Heterozygous HdhQ111 knock-in mice (KI) [ ] and p75 +/− heterozygous mice (p75 NTR /ExonIII) from the Jackson Laboratory were bred. KI and p75 +/− were C57BL/6 genetic background. Only males from each genotype, Hdh Q7/Q7 (WT), Hdh Q7/Q111 (KI), p75 +/− , and KI:p75 +/− , were used for all experiments. Male R6/1 transgenic mice (B6CBA background) expressing the exon-1 of mutant huntingtin with 145 repeats were used for pharmacological experiments [ ]. Male C57BL/6J (WT) mice, BDNF +/− mice, and BDNF −/− from the Jackson Laboratory were bred and used to test specificity of BDNF antibodies. Experimental procedures were approved by the Local Ethical Committee of the University of Barcelona (99/01) and the Generalitat de Catalunya (00/1094), following European (2010/63/UE) and Spanish (RD 1201/2005) regulations for the care and use of laboratory animals.
Drug Administration
FTY720 was obtained as a powder from Cayman Chemicals and dissolved in EtOH 10% in distilled water (vehicle). For chronic pharmacological treatment, intraperitoneal injections of FTY720 were given every 4 days at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg for 12 weeks, starting at 8 weeks of age. Animals were weighted weekly in order to determine the appropriate dose. Mice were distributed into four experimental groups ( n = 10–12 each): WT + FTY720, WT + vehicle, R6/1 + FTY720, and R6/1 + vehicle. Last dose of FTY720 was administered 24 h before sacrificing the animals for histological and biochemical analysis.
Behavioral Assessment
Fixed Rotarod
Motor coordination and balance were evaluated on the rotarod apparatus at distinct rotations per minute (rpm), as described elsewhere [ ]. In brief, KI mice (5–6 months old) and R6/1 mice (7 weeks old) were trained at constant speed (10 rpm) for 60 s. We performed two trials per day for three consecutive days, and the latency to fall and the number of falls during 60 s was recorded. No differences between groups were detected at this period. After training and starting at 7 months of age, KI mice were evaluated once a month at 10 and 24 rpm until 12 months of age, and the number of falls in a total of 60 s was recorded. R6/1 mice were evaluated at 24 rpm, once a week, from 10 to 19 weeks of age. The animals were put on the rotarod several times until the addition of the latency to fall off reached a total of 60 s.
Open Field
Independent cohorts of 8- and 10-month-old WT, KI, p75 +/− , and KI:p75 +/− animals (only males) were used. The device consisted of a white circular arena with 40 cm diameter and 40 cm high. The light intensity was 40 lx throughout the arena, and the room temperature was kept at 19–22 °C and 40–60% humidity. Mice were placed into the arena during two consecutive days (15 min/day), and spontaneous locomotor activity was measured as total distance traveled. The arena was rigorously cleaned between animals in order to avoid odors. Animals were tracked and recorded with SMART Junior Software.
Western Blotting
WT and HD mice were killed by cervical dislocation, and the brains were quickly removed, dissected, frozen in dry ice, and stored at − 80 °C until use. Protein extracts were prepared from striatal brain samples by sonication on ice for 10 s in lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris base (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% NP-40 supplemented with 1 mM sodium orthovanadate and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich). Samples were centrifuged at 10,000× g for 10 min, and the protein contents determined by Detergent-Compatible Protein Assay (bicinchoninic acid, BCA; Bio-Rad). Protein extracts (30 μg) were mixed with 4× SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, resolved by 8–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Blots were blocked in 10% non-fat powdered milk in Tris-buffered saline Tween-20 (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, 0.05% Tween-20) for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies: anti-DARPP32 (1:1000, BD Biosciences, cat. no. 611520), anti-PDE10A (1:1000, Abcam, cat. no. ab14622), anti-A2AR (1:1000, Santa Cruz, cat. no. sc-32261), anti-BDNF (1:1000, Santa Cruz, cat. no. sc-546), anti-BDNF (1:1000, Icosagen, cat. no. 327-100, Clone 3C11), anti-p75 NTR (1:1000, Promega, cat. no. G3231), anti-phospho-TrkB (Tyr816) (1:1000, Abcam, cat. no. ab75173), anti-phospho-TrkB (Tyr515) (1:1000, Abcam, cat. no. ab131483), anti-TrkB (1:1000, BD Biosciences, cat. no. 610101), anti-phospho-Akt (Ser473) (1:1000, Cell Signaling, cat. no. 3787), anti-Akt (1:1000, Cell Signaling, cat. no. 2920), anti-phospho p44/42 ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) (1:1000, Cell Signaling, cat. no. 9101), anti-ERK1/2 (1:2500, BD Biosciences, cat. no. 610123), anti-phospho-PLCγ1 (Tyr783) (1:1000, Cell Signaling, cat. no. 2821), anti-PLCγ1 (1:1000, Cell Signaling. cat. no. 2822), anti-phospho-CREB (Ser133) (1:1000, Millipore, cat. no. 06-519), anti-CREB (1:1000, Cell Signaling, cat. no. 9197), anti-phospho-SAPK/JNK (Thr183/Tyr185) (1:1000, Cell Signaling, cat. no. 9251), anti-SAPK/JNK (1:1000, Cell Signaling, cat. no. 9252), anti-phospho-c-Jun (Ser63) (Santa Cruz, 1:1000, cat. no. sc-822), anti c-Jun (Santa Cruz, 1:1000, cat. no. sc-74,543), anti-spectrin (1:1000, Chemicon, cat. no. MAB1622), anti-α-tubulin (1:50,000, Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. T9026), and anti-actin (1:20,000, MP Biomedicals, cat. no. 69100). Membranes were then rinsed three times with Tris-buffered saline Tween-20 (TBS-T) and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After washing for 30 min with TBS-T, membranes were developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence substrate kit (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Gel-Pro densitometry program (Gel-Pro Analyzer for Windows version 4.0.00.001) was used to quantify the different immunoreactive bands relative to the intensity of the α-tubulin or actin band in the same membranes. Data are expressed as the mean ± SEM of band density obtained in independent experiments or sample.
BDNF Immunoassay
BDNF quantification was performed using an ELISA as previously described [ ], with minor modifications. In brief, 96-well white polystyrene plates (Nunc) were coated with 1 μg of anti-BDNF #1 antibody in 100 μl carbonate buffer (pH 9.7) per well overnight at 25 °C. Plates were blocked with 4% BSA in PBS and washed three times with TBST. Samples and standards (1–1024 pg of recombinant purified BDNF per well) supplemented with 1% BSA and 1% NP-40 were incubated for 3 h at 30 °C together with BDNF #2 antibody coupled to HRP. Plates were washed three times with TBST. SuperSignal ELISA Femto Substrate (Life Technologies), diluted 50% in H 2 O, was used as the substrate. With these modifications to the assay, we improved its sensitivity to detect 1 pg of BDNF per well. In addition, using a range of standards with different amounts of recombinant BDNF (1–1024 pg/well), we generated standard curves for each experiment performed, which allowed us to precisely quantify the BDNF present in striatal tissue. The following antibodies were used [ ]: mouse BDNF monoclonal (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) for ELISA, BDNF #1 at 1 μg/well for plate coating, and HRP-labeled BDNF #2 at 12 ng/well.
Dendritic Spine Dying and Confocal Analysis
Neurons were labeled using the Helios Gene Gun System (Bio-Rad) as previously described [ ]. Briefly, a suspension containing 3 mg of DiI (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) dissolved in 100 μl of methylene chloride (Sigma) and mixed with 50 mg of tungsten particles (1.7 mm diameter, Bio-Rad) was spread on a glass slide and air-dried. The mixture was resuspended in 3.5 ml distilled water and sonicated. Subsequently, the mixture was drawn into Tefzel tubing (Bio-Rad) and then removed to let tube dry during 5 min under a nitrogen flow gas. Then, the tube was cut into 13 mm pieces to be used as bio gun’s cartridges. Dye-coated particles were delivered in the striatum using the following protocol. Shooting was performed over 150 μm coronal sections at 80 psi through a membrane filter of 3 μm pore size and 8 × 10 pores/cm 2 (Millipore). Sections were stored at room temperature in PBS for 3 h protected from light, then incubated with DAPI, and finally mounted with Mowiol to be analyzed. DiI-labeled medium spiny neurons of the dorsal striatum were imaged using a Leica Confocal SP5 with a × 63 oil-immersion objective. Conditions such as pinhole size (1 AU) and frame averaging (4 frames/z-step) were held constant throughout the study. Confocal z-stacks were taken with a digital zoom of 5, a z-step of 0.2 μm, and a resolution of 1024 × 1024 pixel, yielding an image with pixel dimensions of 49.25 × 49.25 μm. Z-stacks were deconvolved using the Acoloma plugins from ImageJ to improve voxel resolution and reduce optical aberration along the z -axis. Segments from MSN dendrites were selected for the analysis of spine density according the following criteria: (1) segments with no overlap with other branches that would obscure visualization of spines and (2) segments either “parallel to” or “at acute angles” relative to the coronal surface of the section to avoid unambiguous identification of spines. Only spines arising from the lateral surfaces of the dendrites were included in the study, ignoring spines located on the top or bottom of the dendrite surface. Given that spine density increases as a function of the distance from the soma, reaching a plateau 45 μm away from the soma, we selected dendritic segments of basal dendrites 45 μm away from the cell body.
Immunohistochemistry
For immunohistochemical analysis, mice were deeply anesthetized and immediately perfused transcardially with saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate buffer. The brains were removed and postfixed overnight in the same solution, cryoprotected by immersion in 30% sucrose, and then frozen in dry ice-cooled methylbutane. Serial coronal cryostat sections (30 μm) through the whole brain were collected in PBS as free-floating sections.
For EM48 immunohistochemistry, sections were first incubated for 30 min in a 0.01 M sodium citrate buffer (pH 6) preheated to and maintained at 80 °C in a water bath (just for KI and KI:p75 +/− animals). Next, endogenous peroxidases were blocked for 45 min in PBS containing 3% H 2 O 2 . Non-specific protein interactions were blocked with 3% normal horse serum. Tissue was incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody anti-EM48 (1:500, Millipore). Sections were washed three times in PBS and incubated with a biotinylated anti-mouse antibody (1:200; Pierce) at room temperature for 2 h. The immunohistochemical reaction was developed using the ABC kit (Pierce) and made visible with diaminobenzidine. No signal was detected in controls in which the primary antibodies had been omitted. Automated quantification of the number of nuclear huntingtin aggregates and the number and intensity of EM48-stained nuclei within the striatum were performed using CellProfiler v2.8 software. Three coronal striatal sections per animal spaced 240 μm apart were chosen for the analysis. Bright field images from the 100% of the striatum were acquired at × 40 magnification with a BX51 Olympus microscope with the cast system software (Olympus Danmark A/S). The CellProfiler pipeline file containing the specific parameters of the automated quantification is available upon request. In particular, for KI and KI:p75 +/− striatal sections, diffuse EM48 immunostaining was quantified as a “staining index” that captures both the nuclear staining intensity and the number of immunostained nuclei, as described previously [ , ].
For cleaved caspase-3 immunohistochemistry, sections were rinsed two times in PBS, treated with 50 mM NH4Cl for 30 min, rinsed three more times in PBS, and permeabilized and blocked in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and 10% normal horse serum (Pierce Biotechnology) for 90 min at room temperature. Sections were then washed in PBS and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody anti-cleaved caspase-3 (1:250, Cell Signaling). Slices were washed three times and then incubated 2 h shaking at room temperature with the secondary antibody anti-rabbit Cy3 555 (1:100, Jackson ImmunoResearch). Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258 (1:10,000, Molecular Probes, Life Technologies) for 10 min. No signal was detected in controls in which the primary antibodies had been omitted. As positive controls, sections were obtained from animals which had undergone physical lesion in the corticostriatal region causing cell apoptosis. Images were acquired with a BX60 epifluorescence microscope (Olympus) with an Orca-ER cooled CCD camera (Hamamatsu).
Nissl Staining
Nissl staining was performed in floating sections (30 μm, three sections/mouse) after incubation with cresyl violet solution (0.1 g/L) for 45 min. Images were acquired at × 4 with a BX51 Olympus microscope, and thickness of motor cortex (M1) was measured using ImageJ.
Statistical Analysis
All data are expressed as mean ± SEM. Statistical analysis was performed by using the unpaired Student’s t test (95% confidence), one-way ANOVA, two-way ANOVA, and the appropriate posthoc tests as indicated in the figure legends. Values of P < 0.05 were considered as statistically significant.
