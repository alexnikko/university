Introduction
Histones, the chief protein components of chromatin, are subject to post translational modifications by enzymes, including methylation, acetylation and ubiquitination [ ]. Histone modification influences chromatin condensation, and poise genes for either transcriptional activation or repression. Histone methylation status is regulated by histone methyltransferase (“writer”) and demethylases (“eraser”) [ , ]. Dysregulated histone methylation by mutational and expressional alterations of histone methyltransferases such as KMT2A and KMT6 have been found in cancers [ , ]. Also, histone demethylases are frequently altered in many cancers by mutational and expressional changes. For example, a histone demethylase KDM6A (also known as UTX ) is frequently inactivated in kidney and bladder cancers by somatic mutations and considered a tumor suppressor gene (TSG) [ , ]. There are two classes of histone demethylase genes, i.e. KDM1 family and Jumonji C family. PHF2, a plant homeodomain finger gene, is a member of the Jumonji C family. PHF2 demethylates H3K9-Me2 (lysyl dimethylation) and participates in epigenetic regulation of transcription [ ]. PHF2 gene is deleted and hypermethylated in breast cancer and its expression is lost in head and neck cancer [ , ]. Functionally, PHF2 interacts with p53 and enhances p53-mediated gene expression and cell death [ ]. In the absence of PHF2, anti-cancer drug-induced and p53-mediated cell killing is not efficient in cancer cells [ ]. PHF2 expression is downregulated in colorectal (CRC) and gastric (GC) cancers [ ]. Together, these data suggest that PHF2 may behave as a candidate TSG in CRC and GC.
About one third of GCs and CRCs are classified as high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) cancers [ ]. Many TSGs harbor frameshift mutations at monocleotide repeats in MSI-H cancers [ ]. In the human genome database, we observed that the PHF2 gene possess nucleotide repeats in coding sequences that might be mutated in MSI-H cancers. Frameshift mutations of PHF2 gene, however, have not been reported in CRC and GC. Intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) is a common phenomenon in cancers, which may result in cancer evolution and influence on clinical outcomes [ , , ]. Thus, identification of genetic ITH is important in understanding clinicopathologic as well as biological features of the cancers. The current study aimed to find whether PHF2 mutations are common and harbor ITH in MSI-H CRC and GC.
Materials and Methods
Tissue Samples and Microdissection
In this study, we used 124 CRCs and 79 GCs. The CRCs included 79 CRCs with MSI-H, 45 CRCs with microsatellite stable/low MSI (MSS/MSI-L), 34 GCs with MSI-H and 45 GCs with MSS/MSI-L (Table 1 ). Approval for this study was obtained from institutional review board of the Catholic University of Korea. . These cases over-represent MSI-H cancers, because we collected separately MSI-H and MSS/MSI-L cancers in different times. We adopted an MSI evaluation by using five mononucleotide repeats (BAT25, BAT26, NR-21, NR-24 and MONO-27) [ ]. For 16 CRCs with MSI-H, we used 4–7 regional cancer areas per CRC for ITH evaluation. These multi-regions were examined under light microscope and used to detect mutational ITH of ZMPSTE24 . Cancer and matched normal cells were micro-dissected as described in our earlier reports [ , ].

Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism (SSCP) and DNA Sequencing Analyses
Targets of this mutation study were two A8 repeats (an A8 in exon 12 and another A8 in exon 21) in PHF2. Genomic DNA from matched normal and cancer cells was separately amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with radioisotope ([ 32 P]dCTP). We determined aberrant motility on SSCP (FMC Mutation Detection Enhancement system; Intermountain Scientific, Kaysville, UT, USA) by visual inspection. The aberrant migrated products were further analyzed by Sanger DNA sequencing. Other procedures for PCR-SSCP were defined in our earlier reports [ , ].
Results
Mutational Analysis
Genomic DNAs of 124 CRCs and 79 GCs were studied to detect frameshift mutations within the nucleotide repeats of PHF2 (an A8 in exon 12 and another A8 in exon 21) by the PCR-SSCP analyses. In SSCP, we observed aberrant bands in 29 cases (26 cases for the A8 in exon 12 and 3 cases for the A8 in exon 21) (Table 2 and Fig. 1 ). Normal tissues of matched patients revealed no aberrant migration in SSCP, which indicated that the aberrant bands had somatically risen (Fig. 1 ). Sanger DNA sequencing confirmed somatic mutation of PHF2 gene (Fig. 1 ), which was either a deletion or a duplication (insertion) mutation in the A8 repeats that would lead to termination of PHF2 translation (Table 2 ). Twenty-two of 79 CRCs (27.8 %) and 7 of 34 GCs (20.6 %) carrying MSI-H showed frameshift mutations in PHF2 . Any of the cancers did not harbor two or more frameshift mutations of the repeats simultaneously. These mutations were found in MSI-H cases (29/113), but there was not any in MSS/MSI-L cases (0/90) (Table 2 ) (Fisher’s exact test, p < 0.001) (Fig. 2 ).

Intratumoral Heterogeneity of PHF2 Frameshift Mutations
From 92 of 16 CRCs (4–7 fragments per CRC) with MSI-H were analyzed for the ITH status of the PHF2 frameshift mutations . In two (CRC41 and CRC49), one of the frameshift mutations of PHF2 (c.1475delA) exhibited ITH. One CRC (CRC41) showed the mutation in two of five regions, but no such mutation in the other three. Likewise, the other (CRC49) exhibited the mutation in three of six regions (Table 3 ). Collectively, the ITH of PHF2 frameshift mutation was identified in 2 (12.5 %) of 16 CRC cases.

Discussion
Earlier studies have identified that the chromosomal region 9q22.2–31.2, where PHF2 resides, is frequently deleted in human cancers including CRC [ ], suggesting that this region might harbor a TSG. A TSG is a gene that protects a cell from cancer development, and when mutated, the mutated TSG would lead the cell to cancer development. Inactivating frameshift mutation in the repeat sequence of a TSG is frequent in MSI-H CRCs and GCs [ ]. These findings led us to further dissect the genetic alterations of PHF2 gene in CRC and GC. This study by us identified that both MSI-H GC and CRC exhibited PHF2 frameshift mutations (25.7 %). Our data suggest that the TSG activities in PHF2 may be lost by various mechanisms including inactivating mutations identified in this study as well as the deletion and hypomethylation identified in earlier studies [ , , ].
The PHF2 protein consisted of an N-terminal PHF domain (7–53 amino acid residues), a Jumonji C domain (201–336 residues) and a C-terminal p53-interacting domain (820–1096 residues) [ ]. The PHF2 mutations identified in the present study would lead to loss of amino acids after the residue 492 or 954 (Table 2 ), which would delete the C-terminal domain. An earlier study reported that the C-terminal domain-deleted PHF2 profoundly inhibited TSG activities, including chemotherapy-induced anti-cancer effects [ ]. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the PHF2 mutations in this study might probably inhibit TSG activities and contribute to cancer development. A previous study reported that PHF2 expression is downregulated in GC and CRC [ ], too. These reports, together, may indicate that PHF2 is inactivated by multiple mechanisms, including somatic mutation and protein loss in CRC and GC.
Genomic instability in a cancer may result in an elevated level of somatic mutations and contribute to ITH development by providing a pool of mutations upon which selection can act in a given microenvironment [ ]. While the majority of the mutations in a cancer appear to be passenger mutations, only a small fraction represents driver mutations, conferring a selective advantage to the cancer [ ]. In this study, we identified mutational ITH of PHF2 frameshift mutation in 2 (12.5 %) of 16 CRCs, which is consistent with previous studies that had reported frequent mutational ITH in CRCs with MSI-H [ ]. Functionally, PHF2 is known to possess TSG activities [ ]. The modest incidence of mutational ITH of PHF2 (12.5 %) and functional relevance on TSG inactivation may indicate that the ITH in PHF2 frameshift mutation might possibly contribute to the pathogenesis and influence the clinical outcomes. However, it should be further studied how the ITH change during the progression and the ITH play a causal role in tumor pathogenesis. We were not able to find any significant difference between cancers with the ITH and those without it, probably because the number of cases with the ITH was small. Analysis of a larger cohort with the mutations is required in future studies.
PHF2 is known to ensure cell death in response to chemotherapy [ ]. Thus, evaluation of PHF2 expression and mutation status might provide a clue to delineate chemotherapy response in GC and CRC. In this point, In this point, our data may reveal information on biological mechanisms as well as therapeutic strategies in cancer cells.
