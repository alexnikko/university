Introduction
Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is an innate, inherited, heterogeneous immune deficiency disorder of phagocytes that renders patients susceptible to recurrent, severe bacterial and/or fungal infections and excessive hyperinflammatory responses [ , , , , , ].
A balance between generation and removal of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is relevant for health. Deficient ROS production results in phagocyte dysfunction due to decreased levels or dysfunctional forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-reduced (NADPH) oxidase components, while excessive ROS can induce tissue damage [ ]. Patients with CGD have a genetic defect in the NADPH oxidase in their phagocytes, leading to impaired ROS production [ , ]. Mutations affect one of the five genes ( CYBB , CYBA , NCF1 , NCF2 , and NCF4 ) that encode structural components of the NADPH oxidase (gp91 phox , p22 phox , p47 phox , p67 phox , and p40 phox protein, respectively) [ , , ]. In Western countries, 65 to 70% of CGD patients belong to the X-linked recessive (XLR) inheritance group, which is usually associated with a severe clinical phenotype. The autosomal recessive form (AR) of CGD presents in about 30% of patients, with variable clinical manifestations, from very mild to severe clinical phenotype [ , ]. In Israel, as well as in most Eastern counties, the AR inheritance is the predominant form of the disease, related to the high rate of consanguinity and founder effects [ , , , ].
In the National Laboratory for Leukocyte Functions, 2420 Israeli and Palestinian patients were referred for evaluation for a suspected phagocytic disorder over a period of 31 years [ ]. CGD was diagnosed in 94 patients, of whom 17 were of Kavkazi origin.
We have previously reported that most Kavkazi-Jewish CGD patients are homozygous for the c.579G>A mutation in NCF1 (p 47 phox Trp193Ter) [ ]. Almost 90% share a common haplotype, indicating a founder effect. This uniformity indicates that the c.579G>A mutation in NCF1 was introduced in the Kavkazi population about 1200 to 2300 years ago [ , ].
In this study, we focused on the Kavkazi CGD patients, their biochemical and genetic characteristics, clinical presentation as manifested by clinical score, disease course and its complications, response to different treatment modalities, and patient outcomes.
Subjects and Methods
From November 1986 to July 2017, 2420 Israeli and Palestinian patients with recurrent, severe infections were referred from ambulatory and hospital centers to our Laboratory for Leukocyte Functions at Meir Medical Center, Israel, for phagocytic leukocyte evaluation. Medical records were carefully reviewed. Referring physicians completed detailed demographic and medical history questionnaires for each patient. Detailed molecular studies were conducted at the Sanquin Research Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. This retrospective study was approved by the Helsinki Committee of Meir Medical Center, affiliated with Tel Aviv University.
Neutrophils were isolated by Ficoll-Histopaque sedimentation, followed by erythrocyte lysis, as described by Böyum [ ]. Cell purity was 99% and viability > 95%. CGD diagnosis was established by assessing the ability of neutrophils to produce ROS. The rate of superoxide production was measured as superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of ferricytochrome c based on the method described by Weisbart et al. [ ], using a UV-260 Shimadzu spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) at 550 nm. The superoxide release was calculated with the Massey extinction coefficient for ferricytochrome c of 2.1 × 10 4 M −1 cm −1 . Normal values of superoxide production by PMA-stimulated neutrophils were above 2.0 nmol O 2 − /10 6 /cells/min. The neutrophil hydrogen peroxide generation was assessed by dihidrorhodamine-1,2,3 (DHR) assay, as described by Vowells et al. [ ]. The stimulation index (SI) was calculated by dividing the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of stimulated neutrophils by the MFI of unstimulated neutrophils (normal > 30). We also assessed the percentage of stimulus-responding cells (normal ≥ 90%) and their fluorescence intensity (normal > 110 MFI).
The bactericidal activity was assessed as previously reported and expressed as the decrease in the number of viable bacteria [ ]. Bacteria ( S. aureus , 502A, ATCC, Rockville, MD, USA) with neutrophils (3:1 ratio) were incubated in the presence of autologous and homologous serum. Normal values were above 0.5 log decrease of colonies per hour. Evaluation of bactericidal activity served as an additional tool for assessing the severity of the disease. CGD was confirmed in all patients based on molecular and genetic studies.
Western blot analysis was performed for protein analysis of the NADPH-oxidase system [ ]. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin was used to detect binding of these antibodies to the blot. DNA was purified from leukocytes by standard methods and analyzed by PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing of NCF1 exons with their intron/exon boundaries [ ]. Primers were developed on NCF1- specific points in the introns of NCF1 to amplify only NCF1 and not pseudo-gene-specific sequences. Sequence data analysis was performed with Ion Reporter Software (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
We used a previously published clinical severity score to quantify the clinical status, general condition of the patients, and therapeutic response [ ]. As shown later in the “ Results ” section, the clinical score was validated by statistical analysis. Score 1: Alive and well, with sporadic bacterial and/or fungal infections (≤ 2/year). Adequate response to treatment. No hospitalization required. Score 2: Recurrent bacterial and/or fungal infections (≤ 4/year). Adequate response to treatment. No hospitalization required. Score 3: Recurrent prolonged, bacterial and/or fungal infections (> 4/year). Inconsistent response to treatment. Hospitalization might be required. Score 4: Recurrent, severe bacterial and/or fungal infections (> 6/year), some life-threatening with multi-organ involvement and poor response to treatment. Hospitalization is mandatory.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was accomplished with the SPSS software package, version-23 (SPSS, IBM, New York, NY, USA). Student’s t test (or Mann-Whitney U test for nonparametric conditions) was used to compare two means for continuous variables. Pearson or Spearman correlations were analyzed between continuous variables, each when appropriate. P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Demographic Characteristics
In this study, 17 Kavkazi-CGD patients (12 males, 5 females) from 14 families of Jewish origin were enrolled. Kavkazi were defined according to the geographic country of origin (Georgia, Azerbaijan, or Dagestan) and their ancestors’ origin. Their median age at biochemical and genetic diagnosis was 8.8 years (range 0.5 to 26 years) and median age at onset of clinical manifestations 3.1 years (from 1 day to 9 years) (Fig. 1 ). Three families had two affected siblings; 13 patients originated from Dagestan, 2 from Azerbaijan, and 2 from Georgia (Table 1 ). Fig. 1 Age at onset and diagnosis of CGD.

Biochemical and Genetic Features
All Kavkazi CGD patients had negligible superoxide production and significantly decreased H 2 O 2 production in the DHR assay (Table 2 ). Bactericidal activity was assessed in 15 patients, and moderate to severe deficiency was found in all. NCF1 gene mutation (c.579G>A, p.Trp193Ter, in exon 7), which leads to the premature termination of p47 phox protein synthesis, was found in homozygous form in 15 patients; two additional patients were compound heterozygous with another mutation in the other allele (splice site mutation or GT deletion in exon 2). SI values on DHR assay were < 3, but 7.6 in one patient who was found to be compound heterozygous with the GT deletion on the other allele.

Clinical Manifestations and Associated Infectious Diseases
The clinical spectrum of Kavkazi CGD patients varied from mild to severe disease expression. Significant correlation was found between the clinical score and the number of infections ( r = 0.697, p = 0.002), as well as with chronic complications ( r = 0.846, p = 0.0001). Ten of 17 patients had mild clinical scores (1 and 2); three patients scored 3, and four patients had a severe clinical score of 4.
The severity of the disease was compared to that of 7 patients from our previous cohort of 94 CGD patients. These 7 patients have a GT deletion in the NCF1 gene (c.75_76delGT, p.Tyr26HisfsX26), leading to absence of p47 phox . The clinical severity of the Kavkazi CGD patients with the c.579G>A mutation was significantly higher than that of CGD patients with the GT deletion ( p < 0.05), while the residual H 2 O 2 generation, as expressed by the mean SI value of the DHR test in the Kavkazi group, was significantly lower (2.5 ± 1.6) than that in the GT deletion group (6.4 ± 2.8), p < 0.001. Nevertheless, the superoxide generation was zero in both groups. The discrepancy between H 2 O 2 and O 2 − generation in case of absence of p47 phox is assumed to be due to direct formation of some H 2 O 2 via FAD within gp91 phox , without O 2 − as an intermediate [ ]. Apparently, the c.579G>A mutation led to lower residual H 2 O 2 as compared to the GT deletion mutation, resulting in more severe clinical expression of the disease. Indeed, the patient with compound heterozygosity, who presented with both mutations, showed a higher residual H 2 O 2 of 7.6 (SI) associated with milder clinical expression. We have no explanation for this difference in hydrogen peroxide generation between the two groups of p47 phox -deficient patients.
The location of infections in Kavkazi CGD patients is reported in Fig. 2 . Pneumonia was the most frequent symptom (76%), followed by cutaneous-subcutaneous abscesses (59%), suppurative lymphadenitis (53%), liver abscesses (53%), lung abscesses (41%), and sinusitis (24%). These findings are in accordance with those previously reported in CGD [ , , ]. Fig. 2 Type of infection and percentage of patients affected
The most frequent etiological agents isolated were catalase-positive bacterial and fungal infections, as shown previously [ , ]. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 59% of the CGD patients, followed by Aspergillus fumigatus and Escherichia coli , each isolated from 18% of the patients, and other opportunistic microorganisms isolated from 12% of the patients (Fig. 3 ). One patient received anti-tuberculosis therapy. Additionally, 71% of the patients with large, suppurating abscesses, not adequately responsive to intravenous antibiotics, required percutaneous drainage. Two patients underwent partial lung resection and two partial liver resections (24%). Fig. 3 Infecting organisms and percentage of patients infected
Chronic manifestations were observed in 16 patients (Fig. 4 ). Patients with recurrent severe infections developed hyperinflammatory states associated with diffuse granuloma formation in the skin, liver, brain, lungs, and kidneys (59% of the patients). The primary chronic manifestations were anemia of chronic infections (59%), lymphadenopathy (47%), and tissue granuloma formation (59%). Failure to thrive was diagnosed in 24% of the children and chronic lung disease (CLD) in 18% of the patients. As we previously reported, gastrointestinal manifestations of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting, as well as Crohn’s disease or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), were present in 16% of this Kavkazi cohort [ ]. Fig. 4 Chronic findings and percentage of patients affected
Therapeutic Approach and Outcome
Patients in this study were prophylactically medicated with double or triple drugs (Fig. 5 ). These included trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (94%), anti-staphylococcal antibiotics (82% ) , and itraconazole (59%) or voriconazole (24%). Steroids were administered to five patients (29%) because of tissue granulomatosis causing organ dysfunction. Granuloma obstruction was found in the gastrointestinal tract in 1 patient (pyloric stenosis), in the respiratory system in three patients, and in the genitourinary tract in one patient (ureteropelvic junction). Fig. 5 Therapy and prophylaxis and percentage of patients treated. Therapy: According to the isolated agent and its sensitivity. Prophylactic therapy: included two or three drugs (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole + anti-staphylococcal drug and according to the agent and clinical condition, additional antifungal drug)
Recombinant human interferon-gamma (rIFN-γ) was given for 1 year to two patients; one did not respond to treatment and the other is off therapy for 20 years, alive and well. The clinical benefit of this treatment modality is controversial because prolonged compliance is uncertain [ , , ]. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was performed in two patients. While one patient had an uncomplicated, successful course, the other suffered graft failure and underwent a second unsuccessful HSCT.
The present cohort displays an encouraging 88% overall long-term survival, with a median follow-up of 14 years for living patients. Two brothers with high clinical score died at 47 and 28 years of age (Table 1 , patients 1 and 2); the younger following disseminated lung granulomatosis associated with fibrosis, bronchiectasis, and sepsis; the older had CLD and diabetes mellitus type 2. The early onset of infections associated with delayed diagnosis in these patients, aggravated the course of the disease (Fig. 1 ).
Discussion
CGD is a rare disorder with varying incidence throughout the world. The disease affects multiple ethnic groups with diverse genetic, cultural and environmental backgrounds. Israeli society is heterogeneous and multi-cultural, containing Jews from disparate countries. The incidence of CGD in Israel is relatively high at 1:86,000, with predominance of AR inheritance [ ]. The Jewish Kavkazi population in Israel that comprises about 100,000 members has a higher CGD prevalence of about 1:5900. This high prevalence is related to the founder effect in this community [ ] and to the high inter-ethnic marriage rate. All Kavkazi CGD patients have a c.579G>A mutation in the NCF1 gene, causing p47 phox deficiency [ ].
We diagnosed 17 CGD Kavkazi patients from 14 unrelated families, aged 0.5 to 26 years. The period between the disease onset and diagnosis varied from 3 weeks (Table 1 , patient 16) to 26 years (Table 1 , patient 1; Fig. 1 ), supporting the interpatient variations associated with this genotype. Early diagnosis is important, and prompt initiation of prophylactic antibiotics and antifungals seems to be beneficial. Two patients were diagnosed with CGD at 6 months and 3 years of age because of an affected sibling, before any clinical disease expression. Since diagnosis, these patients received prophylactic therapy with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and itraconazole. Of note, one is disease free since birth (currently 11 years old), and the other developed mild suppurative lymphadenitis at age 5 and rapidly recovered following treatment (currently 7 years old). We speculate that instituting early therapy prevents recurrent pyogenic infections. Nonetheless, late onset was found in some CGD patients, so we should keep in mind that genetic, socio-economic, and cultural factors, including compliance with treatment, influence disease prognosis.
Additionally, delayed diagnosis might result in an adverse clinical course. Tissue damage could develop, often as disseminated granulomatosis and fibrosis in vital organs, particularly the respiratory system, resulting in CLD with restrictive respiratory insufficiency. This can be associated with significant shorter life expectancy, as found in this study (Table 1 , patients 1 and 2). Nonetheless, in immune deficiency diseases such as CGD, patients can suffer from acute deteriorations due to opportunistic microorganisms, e.g., gram-negative sepsis or disseminated fungal infections, including Burkholderia cepacea , Serratia marcescens , aspergillosis, candidiasis, or other agents that eventually result in rapid death [ , , ].
Cultures from blood, urine, bronchial secretions (Broncho-alveolar lavage), and tissue cultures are imperative. CGD involves a wide spectrum of pathogens that are not easily isolated in every infectious event. We successfully isolated the etiological agents in most patients in this cohort (Fig. 3 ). It is remarkable that very unusual CGD pathogens were isolated, such as Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and the catalase-negative Streptococcus pneumoniae . Pyogenic infections were localized in the lungs, lymph nodes, cutaneous-subcutaneous tissues, perianal area, liver, spleen, kidneys, and brain (Fig. 2 ). The persistence of infections that never completely resolved frequently induced hyperinflammatory states and tissue granulomatosis. This excessive, recurrent inflammation can be attributed to reduced neutrophil apoptosis, inefficient efferocytosis, and imbalance of innate neutrophil receptors with induction of highly proinflammatory Th17 cells, as well as exaggerated TNF-α production with inflammasome activity [ , , ].
The type and localization of infections, etiological agents, chronic manifestations, and treatment approach in Kavkazi CGD patients were not significantly different from other Israeli CGD patients previously reported [ ]. Nonetheless, disease severity as assessed by the clinical score was less pronounced in this Kavkazi cohort than in other AR-CGD subtypes, but more severe than that found in patients with the GT deletion (c.75_76delGT) in the NCF1 gene. The GT deletion mutation is found worldwide in 97% of p47 phox deficiency patients and is known to be clinically milder than other CGD subtypes [ , , , , ]. In the present series, most patients were homozygous for the nonsense mutation c.579G>A. This mutation was also found in other ethnic groups from Oman (13 patients) [ ], Turkey (4 and 8 patients) [ , ], Italy (6), Jordan (3), Egypt (2), Eritrea (1), Ethiopia (2), Romania (1), Malta (1) [ ], and recently, we diagnosed 2 Palestinian patients from Nablus. Of note, the same mutation was found in about 1% of Ashkenazi Jews, although only in the heterozygous form, so none of these have CGD [De Boer et al., accepted for publication, Journal of Medical Genetics]. Of interest, so far this mutation was not reported in the non-Jewish Kavkazi population [ ].
Broad heterogeneity is seen in clinical manifestations of patients with the same c.579G>A mutation in the NCF1 gene. It is remarkable that the heterogeneous phenotype was also reported in another common genetic background such as found in 13 Omani CGD patients with the same c.579G>A mutation, who presented with mild to severe recurrent pneumonia, lymphadenitis, and liver abscesses. Most patients in that group were alive and well, but two with severe clinical manifestations underwent successful HSCT. Another patient was reported to have died [ ]. Phenotypic heterogeneity was also found in 21 Indian CGD patients with the GT deletion mutation. Of note, many patients in this study received empirical antimicrobial therapy, which could have affected the clinical course of the disease [ ]. Furthermore, 48% of the CGD patients of the Indian series suffered from tuberculosis, emphasizing the influence of environmental factors. The wide phenotypic heterogeneity seen in the above groups suggests that factors in addition to the mutation type have a crucial role in clinical manifestations of CGD.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis was present in one of our patients, an immigrant from Russia, who previously received BCG vaccination without any side effects. In the last 20 years, the incidence of tuberculosis in native Israelis was 0.8/100,000 individuals, being 27/100,000 in the population of non-Jewish working immigrants. Tuberculosis has significantly decreased in Israel between 1970 and 1990, and no BCG vaccination was given to Israeli newborns since 1980, except in selected populations of immigrants or children with positive tuberculin test over 4 years old. (Health Ministry of Israel. In: “Tuberculosis incidence in Israel-1989-2013”). Of note, the incidence of tuberculosis increased in the 1990’s, following the big wave of immigration from Russia and Ethiopia. We previously reported on a large unselected group of 84 CGD patients in Israel and identified 3 cases of tuberculosis from the Palestinian authority. Two of these patients received BCG vaccination and developed BCGitis [ ]. The much lower incidence of tuberculosis in Israel than in India, China, and Latin America reflects the difference in socio-economic and environmental conditions. Obviously, the immune-compromised CGD patients are prone to suffer from the disease.
In contrast to other reports [ , , ], no significant correlation was found between the phenotypic variability and residual hydrogen peroxide in this group of Kavkazi patients, since in this cohort, low levels of residual H 2 O 2 were found in all patients with homozygous c.579G>A mutation (DHR SI < 3). Nevertheless, we can note an indirect linkage between the phenotype, genotype, and the residual H 2 O 2 by comparing the c.579G>A mutation (Kavkazi group) with the GT deletion mutation (other AR-CGD patients with p47 phox deficiency). The GT group presented with higher residual H 2 O 2 (SI > 3) and milder phenotype expression compared to the former group. Although both mutations lead to absence of p47 phox , the specific c.579G>A mutation is associated with higher clinical severity of the disease, suggesting that other factors might be involved.
Management of CGD has advanced substantially in recent years, evolving from a fatal disease of early childhood to one of long-term survival. Today, HSCT is the definitive treatment for CGD and should be performed, if feasible, in severely affected XLR or AR patients, before tissue damage is irreversible [ , ]. Successful engraftment does not always assure a good prognosis or prevent late morbidity and mortality. Prolonged tissue damage and the secondary CLD with extensive lung fibrosis, granuloma formation, and pulmonary bronchiectasis, seems to be a determining factor in the mortality of CGD patients, before and after HSCT. Transplanted patients had a significantly better quality of life than did non-transplanted patients [ , ]. In the present cohort, two patients underwent allogeneic HSCT (Table 2 , patients 2 and 5). Patient 2 underwent successful HSCT, followed by 8 years free of serious infections, but developed progressive pulmonary restrictive disease. Seven years post-HSCT, bilateral lung transplantation was successfully performed, but a year later, he developed severe pneumonia due to Acinetobacter baumanni and E . coli and died. The patient’s history suggests that the delayed diagnosis and HSCT resulted in this poor outcome.
New treatment strategies, including gene therapy are evolving [ , ], but there is still much to be improved in this field. A novel therapeutic approach with pioglitazone could be effective until definite treatment with HSCT is performed. It was hypothesized that pioglitazone restores bactericidal activity and mitochondrial oxidant (mtROS) production in neutrophils and monocytes [ , ]. This approach is currently under investigation.
In conclusion, we found that Kavkazi CGD patients harbor a common genetic mutation that is associated with a heterogeneous clinical phenotype. Correlation between genotype and phenotype is unpredictable, although clinically, the Kavkazi patients were more severely affected than other patients with p47 phox deficiency. Early diagnosis and proper clinical management in a center experienced in treating phagocytic leukocyte disorders is imperative to ensure favorable patient outcomes. Since the incidence of CGD in the Kavkazi population harboring this specific mutation is high, we support genetic screening in young couples before marriage.
Epidemiological awareness and vaccination programs are an imperative part of CGD care, particularly in endemic tuberculosis areas. Efficient communication, persistent academic activity, and communication between hospitals and community clinics in Israel, led to early referrals for molecular, biochemical, and genetic studies, including prenatal diagnosis in pregnant women with CGD history in the family, when required. Genetic, ethnic, cultural, socioeconomic and medical care seem to be essential factors affecting the incidence and prognosis of CGD. Further studies are needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms of this phenotypic heterogeneity.
