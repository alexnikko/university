Introduction
The biological activities and ecological behavior such as escape from predators, finding bait, and mating under Depth Sea with rather low light requirement and ecological behavior such as escape from predators, finding bait, and mating can be important (Kimley et al. ). Meanwhile it is a relation between central nervous system compliance especially hindbrain with biological activities during their larvae life (Bauchot et al. ).
Ray-finned fish demonstrate a widespread range of evolution variety and this is also affected in their brains. The variation of hindbrain areas is distinguished by the genealogical and ecological adaptations of species (Nieuwnhuys ). Hindbrain has two main parts: cerebellum and medulla oblongata. The fourth ventricle in all fishes is large and its roof has organized by choroid plexus with different degrees. Cerebellum is one of the supplementary areas with relative growth on chondrosteans. Integration of specific sensory messages such as hearing and lateral line is the responsibility of this part (Wagner ).
The growth rate of cerebellum is significantly varying in ray-finned fish species but in the all of them is two parts: 1. Corpus cerebelli (in dorso-rostral area) 2. Valvula cerebelli (in ventro-rostral area and below optic tectum)
The other characteristic of cerebellum in ray-finned fish is the existence as pairs of cell columns called eminente granulares which corpus cerebelli located on its dorsal part (Huesa et al. ).
Both corpus and valvula cerebelli in ray-finned fish have electrosensory and as momyridae are very large. Cerebellum has the near connection with electrosensory lateral line lobe and grows up in electrical fishes (Meek and Nieuwenhuys ); they are to play roles in eye motion, motor coordination, and spatial orientation (Evans ). The diversity in different species with respect to their relative development of corpus and valvula cerebelli especially with regard to electro-receptors is very severe (Lauder and Liem ).
The medulla oblongata is a sensory area and in lower vertebrates like fishes, is similar to spinal cord with a large central canal (Evans ). Its important ability is maintaining of balance and effect on lateral line-auditory system. Also, in some fishes plays a role in control chromatophor cells (Broglio et al. ). Until now, there are no researches on hindbrain and its volume in Huso huso . This study was designed to peruse hindbrain morphogenesis and estimate its volume from 1 to 54 days old.
Materials and methods
For this research, we obtained 36 samples of larvae H. huso , on the ages of 1, 3, 6, 15, 21, and 54 days post-hatching (dph) from Shahid Marjani Aghghela propagation station in Gorgan. Six larvae of each age were fixed in 10% neutral formalin, dehydrated with ethanol series to 100%, cleared in xylene, and embedded in paraffin. Because brain larvae were very small in size, total head fixed and sited in paraffin blocks. Blocks were cut frontally and sagittaly to serial sections with regular intervals into 6 μm thickness from the primary specimens to ends by using a microtom. Tissue sections were deparaffinized and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for general histological studies with light microscope (Olympus CX22). Stereological studies were done by the Cavalieri principle (Gundersen and Jensen ); in order to estimate the different areas of hindbrain, about 10 sections from each specimen selected and figures prepared by the camera attached to the light microscope. Then a point counting grid with the 0.5 cm distance was used for counting points. Grid sited on the figures and each area from the hindbrain separately counted, then an unbiased estimate of the hindbrain volume obtained by using following formula: $$ \mathrm{V}\left({\mathrm{mm}}^3\right)=\mathrm{d}\times \sum \mathrm{p}\times \mathrm{a}\left(\mathrm{p}\right) $$
d interval between sections or sections thickness ∑ p total number of points considered on the area of sections a ( p ) the area represented of each point in the grid
Then at the end, data obtained were analyzed using the SPSS (Version 19. SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA). The statistical analysis was carried out by one-way ANOVA in level P < 0.05. All results are represented as mean ± SD.
Result
The hindbrain in H. huso larvae contained two major parts cerebellum and medulla oblongata on 1 day old (Fig. 1 ), and contained cortex and medulla similar to other sturgeons.

The prominent part of hindbrain called cerebellum was observed on 1 and 3 days old (Figs. 1 and 2 ), but the cell layers were not visible. Overall, the cerebellum occupied in the rostro-dorsal area of fourth ventricle. On 6 days old, the cortex of cerebellum had three layers, molecular, purkinje, and granular cell layers (Fig. 3 ). From this age, the cerebellum grew and contained two parts of corpus and valvula cerebellum (Fig. 3 ).

On 15 days old, valvula cerebellum lied down the optic tectum to forward and inside the tectal ventricle. On 21 and 54 days old, the locality of valvula cerebelli was the same as 15 days old, though it has grown up (Fig. 8 ). On 15 days old, we recognized nucleus visceral secondary (nvs) in latero-medial part of valvula cerebelli (Fig. 6 ). Corpus cerebelli recognized from 6 days old (Fig. 3 ) and contained cortex and medulla, it lied caudally on the midbrain. The corpus cerebelli had two bilateral parts and one middle part was extended into fourth ventricle. With aging, these parts grew and developed to have pair of lateral expansion in both side and a central part (Figs. 5 and 6 ). On 6 days old, granular layer of corpus cerebelli, eminentia granularis, and less valvula cerebelli contained Golgi type II, and purkinje cells. The cell masses of Golgi type II were spread inside molecular layer on 15 days old and this layer contained dendrite of purkinje and glial cells (Figs. 7 and 8 ).
Three sulcus structures recognized in cerebellum from 15 days old (Fig. 5 ): sulcus limitans of His (SlH), sulcus intermedius ventralis (SiV), and sulcus intermedius doralis (SiD). In ventral part of corpus cerebellum and in front of medulla oblongata observed raphe nucleus (Ra), it was approximately below the fourth ventricle on 15 days old (Fig. 8 ). Other structure in bilateral of cerebellum recognized auricula cerebelli (Ac) and contained mass of granular cells on 6 days old (Fig. 4 ). In caudo-medial part of cerebellum exactly under the fourth ventricle, there was observed medial longitudinal fascicle (mlf) on 6 days old, and developed by aging (Figs. 4 , 5 , and 6 ). In the latero-medial part of cerebellum and fourth ventricle, motor nucleus trigeminal nerve complex (vm) on 6 days old was viewed. Below this nerve was observed auditory/vestibular trigeminal nerve (VIII nerve) (Figs. 4 and 5 ).

In H. huso larvae, there was not recognized clear pons and instead, nuclei aggregation and nerve fibers in the ventral area of cerebellum were observed. Fourth ventricle in H. huso larvae was visible on 1 day old (Fig. 1 ) and by aging was elongated, such that on 21 and 54 days old it was significantly larger and comprised the longest ventricle (Figs. 10 and 12 ). The fourth ventricle was surrounded in dorsal wall with cerebellum and in caudo-lateral part by medulla oblongata (Fig. 12 ). On 1 day old, the roof of fourth ventricle had a thin vascular membrane called caudal coroid plexus. In caudo-ventral area of fourth ventricle, on 15 days old, there appeared the nucleus, locus coeruleus (LC) (Figs. 5 and 6 ). The fourth ventricle extended caudally and continued into central canal (cc) in spinal cord (Fig. 11 ). Embryonic mantle (EM) observed as a thin and dense ribbon in periventricular gray area on 54 days old (Fig. 12 ).
Medulla oblongata was located at the caudal part of cerebellum from 1 day old (Fig. 1 ). On 6 days old, the eminentia granularis (EG) was recognized (Fig. 4 ). On 54 days old, crista cerebelares (CriC) was located in the rostro-dorsal surface of medulla oblongata and contained a thin membrane of connective tissue which is meninx and found mostly blood cells (RBC and lymphocyte); they were not visible until 21 days old and in its ventral area contains medial octavolaterialis nucleus (Fig. 12 ). Medulla oblongata as well as cerebellum had columns of columnar cells in its gray matter. These columns were clearly visible from 6 days old. In these cell columns, the nuclei were totally separated and by aging, on 21 and 54 days old were more visible (Fig. 12 ). Nuclei of facial and vagal nerves were in ventral thick part of medulla oblongata and formed facial and vagal lobes that were visible on 6 days old (Fig. 3 ), with aging these nuclei grew larger and nerve fibers were thicker (Fig. 7 ) (Figs. 8 and 10 ). In the caudal of vagal lobes, lorenzini ampullae located on 21 days old that innervates by vagal nerve of medulla oblongata and is sensory receptors (Fig. 9 ) (Figs. 10 and 11 ). In ventro-lateral part of medulla oblongata, two large nerve cells located in both sides that was named Mauthner cells (Ma) on 21 days old (Fig. 9 ).

The medial longitudinal fascicle (mlf) within ventral part of medulla oblongata was observed on 6 days old that continued from cerebellum (Fig. 4 ). Sulcus limitans of His (SlH) in both lateral sides of fourth ventricle, in each side of medulla oblongata’s inner walls on 15 days old (Figs. 5 and 8 ). The white and gray matter in Hindbrain was visible on 1 and 3 days old (Figs. 1 and 2 ), and the amount of gray matter was a lot. But, on 6 days old, the rate of white matter increased (Fig. 4 ). Also, the largest amount of white matter was found on 1 and 3 days old, in middle part of cerebellum. On 54 days old, the gray matter was observed as a thin strip in both side of fourth ventricle (Figs. 11 and 12 ).

Stereology results
SPSS ANOVA version.19 was used for statistical analysis and value is expressed in terms of mean and standard deviation (mean ± SD). Stereological characteristics in different parts of the hindbrain are summarized in Tables 1 , 2 , and 3 . Stereological results showed that significantly distinctive regional differences in the volume of different parts of hindbrain represented a correlation and P < 0.05 was accepted as statistical. This study showed that the volume of hindbrain from 1 day old up to 54 days old significantly increased ( P < 0.05) such that it had the largest volume compare to other parts (Tables 1 and 3 ). The volume of fourth ventricle was increased considerably by aging. Cerebellum had the largest part of hindbrain and had the most volume compare to other parts of hindbrain. Medulla oblongata was after to the cerebellum in volume rate. These areas increased by aging (Tables 1 and 2 ). The volume of gray matter on 1 and 3 days old was great, and on 6 days old, it was decreasing significantly, instead the volume of white matter increased so that on 54 days old, its volume was approximately 2.5 times more (Tables 1 and 2 ).

Discussion
Chondrostei are a large group of actinopterygians and this group in the evolution of hindbrain has differences between sturgeon species. Generally, the level of neuron increasing and migration of them in different parts of hindbrain leads to allometric differences in various species (Nieuwnhuys ).
The sturgeons that during their embryonic development, migration of cells was low: have laminar brain and the ratio of volume and weight brain to the body is lower than the other fishes; and this diversity, independently happens during development (Northcutt and Davis ).
Overall, the brain of sturgeons contains supplementary area (cerebellum and forebrain) and sensory area (midbrain and medulla oblongata), so hindbrain has supplementary and sensory areas (Bauchot et al. ).
In H. huso larvae on 1 day old, the hindbrain contained two parts: cerebellum and medulla oblongata.
Cerebellum similar to the other sturgeons especially in sharks is the largest part of Hindbrain but in Hug fishes is essentially unrecognizable. It contains two areas: corpus and valvula cerebelli covered the dorsal wall of fourth ventricle and the same as other vertebrates has evagination in its dorsal surface during ontogenesis; and formed fourth ventricle (Nieuwnhuys ). Valvula and auricula cerebelli like other actinopterigians grow and locate in the central and lateral of cerebellum (Pouwels ). In H. huso larvae, like other fishes it functions for balance of movements, muscle contractions, and body balance maintenance. Addition to balance of movement and orientation are different in fishes (Singh ). The sturgeons are fast swimmers. In some fishes like cat fish, they are incorporation of sensory messages (Johnston ).
Cerebellum in chondrostei is origin of efferent nerves that control the movements. Though, according to same studies, corpus cerebelli does not have relation with fish balance. But it controls the synergism movements of body muscles, fins, and tails (Ito et al. ). In H. huso larvae on 6 days old, cortex cell layers of cerebellum were distinguished. The purkinje layer contains purkinje cells and granular layer contains axons of purkinje cells. Also molecular layer contains dendrites of purkinje and glial cells. The granular layer is different in size and growth rate; they relate with the peripheral hearing apparatus (Popper and Fay ).
Acoustic nerve from the inner ear and afferent nerves from the muscles connected with this part of brain on 6 days old. Cerebellum in the actinoptregians is the center of incorporation of hearing sensory messages and lateral line (Finger ). The lateral extensions on both side of the corpus and valvula cerebelli were observed on 15 days old and lied on toward optic tectum. They relate with orientation, motor coordination, eye movement, and proprioception (Evans ). Sturgeons like other species have three sulci: sulcus limitans of His viewed in dorso-lateral plate (alar plate) as well as ventro-medial plate (basal plate), sulcus intermedius ventralis was divided to two parts in alar and basal plate: ventralis and intermedio-ventralis, sulcus intermedius dorsalis also in alar and basal plate of cerebellum were divided to two areas: dorsalis and intermedio-dorslis. They were visible from 15 days old in cerebellum of H. huso . These structures contain afferent nerve terminals from viscerosensory, somatosensory, electroreceptive, and mechanoreceptive centers of lateral line system; and originate through vestibular and auditory organs (Norris ). In some of chondrosteons, these nerve terminals connect with octavolateral areas (Theunissen ). In chondrosteons, the sensory receptors of the lateral line system contain neuromasts or mechanoreceptors and the organs which are relative with them, similar to ampullae of lorenzini (Teeter et al. ). In sturgeons, the growth of ampullae of lorenzini is longer than neuromasts and observed on 21 days old in H. huso larvae. But, its evolution was visible as well on 54 days old, and helps the H. huso to find food. In a developmental peruse of lateral line in the shovelnose sturgeons ( Scaphirhynchus platorynchus ), the bony lateral line channels originate to form about 10 days old (Teeter et al. ) and are fully developed on 36 days old, while the ampullae of lorenzini are not fully grow until 27 days old (Gibbs and Northcutt ). In Acipenser naccarii , it is observed on 40 days old the dorsal and intermediate parts expand the normal adult fish (Vazquez et al. ). The sturgeons have large barbels and their responsibility is similar to the ampullae of lorenzini. The barbels are in relation with taste sensory; but the ampullae of lorenzini are mostly around their snout; however, they are part of electroreceptors in the sturgeons (Northcutt ). There are direct connection between cerebellum size and the high number of ampullae of lorenzini in many of fishes including the sturgeons (Helfman et al. ).
Fourth ventricle in H. huso as other sturgeons covered by caudal choroid plexus from 1 day old and was surrounded dorsally by cerebellum and on the lateral sides to caudally with medulla oblongata. Fourth ventricle is the largest ventricle in the brain of sturgeons as well as in H. huso larvae. In rostro-ventral area of fourth ventricle, from 15 days old, observed nucleus named locus coeruleus (LC) produces CSF and catecholamines. In H. huso , its level is low and contains noradernergic cells (Davis and Northcutt ). The fourth ventricle continues toward caudal part into central canal in the spinal cord (Davis and Northcutt ).
Medulla oblongata in fishes is similar to spinal cord with a larger central canal. The nuclei situated in medulla oblongata are main receptor of hearing-lateral line system (Burr ). In connection area of corpus cerebelli to medulla oblongata, bilaterally there was a convexity area called eminantia granularis which was visible from 15 days old in H. huso larvae. Crista cerebelli in fishes has different sizes and plays the role of mechanosensory of lateral line in medulla oblongata (McCormik ), and was visible in H. huso larvae on 54 days old. The vagal and facial nerves originate from medulla oblongata and in some fishes like cyprinidae, the size of facial and vagal lobes in medulla oblongata are in connection with growth of taste receptors (Brandstatter and Kotrschal ).
Medulla oblongata in sturgeons as well as H. huso larvae was visible from 1 day old and forms the sensory area of hindbrain; it is from sulcus limitance to spinal cord. Nearly area of sulcus limitance named visceral area and the further area is somatic. Medulla oblongata maintains balance and effect on the auditory-lateral line system (Nieuwnhuys ). Developed barbels that end up to facial nerves in medulla oblongata and ampullae of lorenzini which are electroreceptors in sturgeon and end up to vagal lobe of medulla oblongata have the main roles on ecological behavior and life activities (Northcutt ). The medulla oblongata in H. huso was more developed than olfactory and visual areas that effects of barbels and ampullae of lorenzini in this species. The viscerosensory part of medulla oblongata contains nerve endings of X, IX, and VII and is in relation with gustatory system in sturgeon. This part is large in all sturgeons (Butler and Hodos ), and indicates that gustatory system has an important role in identification and selection of food for sturgeons (Nieuwnhuys ). This area (viscerosensory) in H. huso larvae was quite similar to adult model on 54 days old. Overall, in the sturgeons, the growth of gustatory system is better than visual and electroreceptive systems (Nieuwnhuys ).
The visceromotor nuclei of medulla oblongata in basal plate are in contact with motor nuclei of facial, glossopharyngeal, and vagal nerves. In sturgeons, these nuclei situate at periventricular of fourth ventricle in medulla oblongata, and present at feeding start of larvae (Eaton et al. ). In H. huso , they are less visible on 6 days old, though they were clearly visible from 54 days old. This part contains efferent nerves from solitary tract system; their role is in ingestion and swallowing of food (Eaton et al. ).
Between the somatomotor nuclei, the significant Mauthner cells observed bilaterally on exiting level of octavus nerve and transversely below fourth ventricle on 21 days old that were part of reticular formation structure in fish and functions in the equilibrium. In sturgeons, these cells are formed from 1 day old, but, due to imperfect myelinated, are not clearly visible until 21 days old (Hernando et al. ). In the sturgeons, they help in scaping from predators (Eaton et al. ). The white and gray matters in H. huso larvae resembled other fishes. The white matter was peripheral, and little on 1 and 3 days old, but gradually, it grew larger and its ratio was vice versa and increased amount of white matter which indicates, increasing of myelinated nerve fibers. With aging the volume of gray matter decreased and became a thin ribbon around fourth ventricle on 54 days old. The estimation of different brain parts such as hindbrain can be related with the living environment of the fish and depends on the ecological factors such as nutrition activities, lifestyle, fast swimming, and higher maneuverability of fishes (Kimley et al. ).
According to stereological results, with aging, the volume of hindbrain especially cerebellum increased significantly and it seems that the activities of H. huso larvae depended on supplementary brain area (cerebellum). The highly volume of cerebellum in sturgeons is due to use its supplementary brain part more than sensory part in behavior activities, and helps balancing the fish (Helfman et al. ). The medulla oblongata in sturgeons also is rather developed which this is due to the existence of strong barbels and ampullae of lorenzini in this species (Kotrschal et al. ). Fourth ventricle compare to other brain ventricles had the most volume and cerebellum formed its dorsal wall.
Conclusion
With respect to above studies, it seems that in H. huso larvae, the activities of fish were mostly depended on the volume of hindbrain. This study showed that the volume of hindbrain from 1 day old up to 54 days old significantly increased ( P < 0.05). The ratio volume of different parts of sensory areas (medulla oblongata) and supplementary part (cerebellum) indicates the role of hindbrain in ecological activities such as hunting activity and complex behaviors in sturgeons. Finally, we suggest studying hindbrain development on the other species and comparing to the point in the time of growth of the hindbrain.
