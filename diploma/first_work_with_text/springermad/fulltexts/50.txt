Introduction
Appropriate dosing for resin yttrium-90 radioembolization (Y90 RE) is determined through a simplified formula that incorporates multiple factors, including patient height and weight as well as tumor and liver volumes [ ]. Liver and tumor volumes are usually derived through volumetric software analysis of contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images. While this method may accurately estimate the entire liver volume, its reliance on vascular landmarks to delineate lobar anatomy—based on traditional Couinaud scheme—may not be as reliable when calculating lobar volumes. This effect may be especially pronounced in patients with variant vascular anatomy or disease-induced liver changes such as those seen with advanced cirrhosis. As delivered dose is based on lobar volume, inaccurate calculation of volume may lead to clinically significant misdosing [ , , , ]. Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is commonly performed in the fluoroscopy suite during arterial mapping as part of treatment planning prior to Y90 RE, as it provides image quality similar to conventional CT helpful for intraprocedural decision making [ , ]. Image acquisition during selective hepatic angiography allows reliable identification of hepatic arterial anatomy as well as the presence of extrahepatic arterial perfusion [ ]. The technique is perhaps most useful in its ability to differentiate areas of segmental perfusion and thus provide an accurate information regarding distinct supply from the left and right hepatic arteries. This benefit of CBCT has led some investigators to advocate its use over standard cross-sectional imaging in determining lobar volume for use in Y90 RE dose calculations [ ].
The goal of this study is to compare liver lobar volume measurements obtained from standard cross-sectional imaging with those obtained with CBCT, with the hypothesis that volume determined by CBCT may more accurately represent the volume of the planned treatment area during Y90 RE.
Materials and Methods
An IRB-approved, retrospective analysis was performed on all patients who underwent Y90 RE in a single academic institution between July 2015 and September 2016. All patients were evaluated in a multi-disciplinary setting by both an interventional radiologist (Author 9) with 6 years of experience and a radiation oncologist (Author 8) with 7 years of experience in Y90 RE who jointly made the final treatment recommendation. All evaluated patients met the standard eligibility criteria to undergo Y90 RE, including ECOG < 2, total bilirubin < 2 mg/dL, liver-dominant tumor burden and life expectancy of at least 3 months [ ].
During the study period, a total of 52 patients underwent Y90 RE for primary or secondary liver-dominant malignancies. Five patients were excluded due to incomplete CBCT imaging (incomplete imaging of the right hepatic lobe in 4 patients and contrast reflux in 1). Motion artifact was not experienced. Of the 47 patients included in the study, 35 underwent bilobar treatment and 12 had treatment to only one lobe. Three patients had undergone prior lobectomies (2 right, 1 left). Conventional hepatic arterial anatomy was present in 75 lobes (91%). Variant anatomy, as defined by the Michel Classification, was present in 8 lobes (10%): 2 patients had an accessory left hepatic artery arising from left gastric artery (type V); 2 had a replaced right hepatic artery (type III); 1 had a replaced left hepatic artery (type II); 1 had an accessory right hepatic artery arising from the superior mesenteric artery (type VI); and 2 had segmental supply arising from the proper and common hepatic arteries [ , ]. Twenty-one patients were treated for metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma (45%), 12 for hepatocellular carcinoma (26%), 6 for metastatic pancreatic malignancies (13%), 4 for cholangiocarcinoma (8%), and one each for metastatic endometrial, gastric, prostate and anal cancer (8%) (Table 1 ).

All patients underwent standard mapping angiography performed in an angiographic suite with the capability of performing cone-beam CT (Artis Zee, Siemens, Munich, Germany) under moderate sedation with intravenous administration of fentanyl and midazolam. A 5-Fr catheter was advanced via common femoral arterial access, and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) of the superior mesenteric and celiac arteries was performed with power injection of Visipaque 320 (GE Healthcare, Chicago, Illinois) diluted 1:1 with 0.9% normal saline. Selective angiography was then performed of the common and proper hepatic arteries as well as the left gastric, gastroduodenal and right gastric arteries. Coil embolization of arteries with demonstrated extrahepatic supply was performed at the operating physician’s discretion.
DSA of the right and left hepatic arteries was performed with the catheter tip in the location of planned Y90 RE treatment. CBCT was performed immediately following DSA using a standard rate of 2 mL/s for 11 s in the right hepatic artery and 1 mL/s for 11 s in the left hepatic artery. Infused rate and total volume for CBCT were adjusted at the operator’s discretion if reflux was visualized during DSA. CBCT was obtained with a 6-s imaging delay and an 8-s imaging time. CBCT images were reconstructed with a 5-mm slice thickness. 99 Tc-macroaggregated albumin ( 99 Tc-MAA) was injected following CBCT.
Hepatic volumes were calculated using Varian Eclipse contouring software (Varian Medial Systems, Palo Alto, California) per standard institutional practice, dividing the liver into right and left lobes using a line passing at 1 cm right of the middle hepatic vein. The intrahepatic portal veins were included in the volume calculation, while the portal veins in the porta hepatis were excluded. Hepatic volumes based on the patient’s most recent CT or MRI were determined prospectively by a senior radiation oncology resident (Author 4). A total of 33 (70%) CT and 14 MRI (30%) studies were reviewed. Regions of interest (ROI) were drawn on every 3rd to 5th axial slice of the entire liver or lobe, from which the software then extrapolated the hepatic volume. The computer-extrapolated volume was reviewed in axial, coronal and sagittal reconstructions with manual corrections made as needed. All volume measurements were reviewed by a radiation oncologist (Author 8) to ensure accuracy.
Hepatic volumes based on CBCT-acquired images were calculated retrospectively by 2 radiology residents in their 2nd and 3rd years of training (Author 1 and Author 2) and reviewed by an attending physician (Author 9), using volume calculation software provided by Siemens (Brand Name, Siemens, Munich, Germany) (Fig. 1 ). As with CT and MRI images, ROI was drawn manually over every 3rd to 5th axial CBCT images, from which the software tool extrapolated the lobar volume. This extrapolated volume was then reviewed in all 3 dimensions to ensure accuracy, with manual corrections made as needed.

Dose calculations were then performed using the SIR-Spheres Microspheres Activity Calculator (SMAC) (Sirtex Medical Limited, North Sydney, Australia), according to the manufacturer and practice guidelines [ ]. SMAC-derived target dose calculation is based on the body surface area method utilizing tumor and lobar volumes, lung shunt and estimated lung mass. Tumor volumes were acquired retrospectively utilizing only CT or MRI data, already calculated at the time of treatment. Doses were retrospectively calculated independently using both CT- and MRI-based and CBCT-based volumetric measurements.
Statistical analysis was performed utilizing Statistical Analysis System software version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina). Descriptive statistics are presented as means and range for continuous variables and frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. CBCT- and CT- and MRI-based volumetric and dosimetric calculated data for each treated hepatic lobe and both combined lobes were compared using a two-tailed, paired Student’s t test. Mean differences between CBCT- and CT- and MRI-based volumetric values were compared utilizing Bland and Altman plots. The differences between the calculated doses utilizing the two methods were empirically categorized as < 10, 10–25, 25–50 and > 50%. A p value < 0.05 was used to indicate statistically significant difference.
Results
A total of 82 lobar volumes (44 right and 38 left) in 47 patients were measured using either CT or MRI and CBCT imaging. Of the 44 right lobes included, 31 volumes were calculated utilizing CT data and 13 MRI data, respectively. Lung shunt fraction was 7.5% (range 2.1–23.0%) for the CT-derived right lobes and 9.2% (3.0–24.6%) for the MRI-derived right lobes, respectively ( p = 0.782). Of the 38 left lobes included, volumes for 29 were calculated utilizing CT data and 9 were calculated using MRI data. Lung shunt fraction was 7.9% (range 1.5–23.0%) for the CT-derived left lobes and 10.9% (3.8–24.6%) for the MRI-derived left lobes, respectively ( p = 0.657).
CT- and CBCT-Derived Volumes and Differences
The mean whole liver volume based on CT was 1900.3 cubic centimeters (cc) (range 637.2–3746.4 cc), and the mean whole liver volume based on CBCT was 1953.8 cc (range 996.7–3682.7 cc) ( p = 0.655). The mean right lobe volume based on CT was 1220.9 cc (range 630.0–2217.1 cc), while the mean right lobe volume based on CBCT was 1228.5 cc (range 438.2–2425.6 cc) ( p = 0.944). Mean left lobe volume based on CT was 756.8 cc (range 189.2–2213.2 cc) and 777.1 cc (range 179.7–2151.5 cc) based on CBCT ( p = 0.867). The mean difference between CT- and CBCT-derived combined hepatic volumes was 25.57% (range 0.6–142.9%), without a significant direction of difference. The mean difference in calculated right lobar volume between CT and CBCT was 21.1% (range 0.6–75.9%). The mean difference in calculated left lobar volume between CT and CBCT was 30.3% (range 2.4–142.9%) (Table 2 ); the difference of 142.9% was observed in a patient with a replaced right hepatic artery (RHA) and segment 4 artery arising from the RHA and lung shunt of 4.9% (Table 3 ). CBCT-derived left hepatic volume was obtained by adding the perfused volume from the left hepatic artery supplying the left lateral segment and volume from the segment IV artery injection (Fig. 2 ).

The difference between each single lobe measured with CBCT and CT was then analyzed with a Bland and Altman plot, which did not demonstrate any statistically significant difference (Fig. 3 ) (95% CI − 661.7 to 689.08; correlation 0.118; p = 0.759). Fig. 3 Bland and Altman plot, CT- and corresponding CBCT-derived volumes. The line of observed average agreement crosses near 0, indicating overall agreement between measurements, although the limits of agreement are wider than expected (95% limits of agreement− 661.7 to 689.08; correlation 0.118; p = 0.759) and greater dispersion is visualized with greater volume averages, suggesting decreased agreement and increased ambiguity
CT- and CBCT-Derived Activity and Differences
The mean nominal right lobe activities using volumes obtained from CT and CBCT were 1.28 gigabecquerel (GBq) (range 0.65–2.14 GBq) and 1.33 GBq (range 0.5–2.69 GBq), respectively ( p = 0.682). The mean calculated nominal left lobe activities using volumes obtained from CT and CBCT were 0.69 GBq (range 0.25–1.88 GBq) and 0.74 GBq (range 0.23–1.69 GBq), respectively ( p = 0.525). The mean difference between CT- and CBCT-derived nominal right lobe activities was 18.67% (range 0.91–75.82%). The mean difference between CT- and CBCT-derived nominal left lobe activities was 27.7% (range 0–143.9%) (Table 2 ). The difference of 143.9% was observed in the same patient with a replaced right hepatic artery and segment 4 artery arising from this aberrant vessel.

Discussion
Liver volume is a prominent component in the body surface area method of dose calculation for resin Y90 RE. Inaccurate measurement of liver volume may lead to significant over- or under-dosing of Y90 activity. As it is dependent on the use of anatomic landmarks to delineate hepatic segments as defined by Couinaud, current practice of assessing liver volume using standard, contrast-enhanced CT or MRI may be inaccurate in patients whose hepatic and portal venous anatomy does not correlate with arterial supply to the right and left hepatic lobes. That is, as catheter-directed treatment is performed from either the left or right hepatic artery, use of parenchymal perfusion—as depicted by CBCT—may provide a more accurate assessment of the treated hepatic lobar volume and thus of delivered dose. This is especially true in cases of variant hepatic arterial anatomy, in which territorial supply provided by individual aberrant arterial branches is even less clear [ ]. Arterial territories are further altered in the presence of cirrhosis and hypervascular malignancies [ , , ]. Furthermore, as contrast is administered peripherally during conventional CT, treatment planning based on CT does not take into consideration catheter position, reflux of contrast and resin microspheres, or patient-specific parameters encountered during radioembolization treatment.
For many interventional radiologists, CBCT is already a standard part of the mapping angiogram used to identify extrahepatic arterial supply and reduce the risk of gastrointestinal ulceration or other sequelae of non-target embolization [ , ]. CBCT has been shown to demonstrate tumors and feeding branches not identified by contrast-enhanced CT or MRI [ ]. Moreover, CBCT has already been validated to accurately estimate perfused liver volume during transarterial chemoembolization [ ]. There are, however, technical challenges inherent to CBCT that do not affect conventional CT or MRI. The patient’s ability to breath hold and remain still can significantly affect image quality, as can beam-hardening artifact from intraprocedural monitoring devices. CBCT is also limited by a smaller field of view, especially when patients have a large body habitus or large liver volume. Four patients were excluded from our study, in fact, due to incomplete imaging of their liver on CBCT. Reflux of contrast during selective catheter injection can further degrade CBCT images [ , , , ].
The data presented suggest that, although there is not a significant difference between lobar volume measured by CBCT and that measured by standard contrast-enhanced CT or MRI, there is high variability in calculated dose when the two methods are compared. This may reflect the importance of lobar volume in the determination of calculated dose-magnifying statistically insignificant differences in volumetric calculation. Although 93% of comparative volume calculations fell within two standard deviations from the mean, the calculated dose using the two methods differed by greater than 25% in more than a quarter of the patients we assessed (26%), and the dose differed by more than 50% in 7 patients. As multiple studies have demonstrated a direct correlation between administered dose and both disease response and radiation-induced liver toxicity, as well as other complications including radiation pneumonitis, it may very well be that more accurate assessment of hepatic volume—and thus more accurate dose planning—would have a direct effect on patient outcome [ , , , ]. The findings of our study suggest further investigation into a correlation between the use of CBCT for treatment planning and patient outcome is warranted.
This study was inherently limited by its retrospective nature and use of single-center data with a relatively small sample size. Differences between imaging techniques were mitigated by performing a separate analysis for CT and MRI data. Inter-reader variability in volume measurement was not assessed for either method, although potential effects were mitigated by having all measurements reviewed by a second reader.
Conclusion
The data presented show that prescribed Y90 RE dose can vary widely—in some cases, by more than 50%—depending on the method of hepatic volume calculation. As volume measurement based on CBCT better represents actual perfused volume, this method likely provides a more accurate representation of planned treatment volume, especially in those patients whose hepatic vascular anatomy is atypical. While our study did not analyze the degree to which perfusional-based volume calculation affects disease response or radiation-induced liver damage, the significant differences reported between two methods of dose planning warrant further investigation into whether this variability extends to patient outcome.
