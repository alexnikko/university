Introduction
Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) is a unique phenomenon, where by 3–4 consecutive ischemia-reperfusion episodes subjected to remote tissues, at a distance from the target organ, results in protection to target organ against sustained ischemia and reperfusion injury, with the same efficacy as local ischemic preconditioning [ ]. Przyklenk et al. demonstrated that 4 cycles of 5 min occlusion and reperfusion of the left circumflex artery attenuate the infarct size induced by sustained left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion [ ]. In the later years, studies have shown the efficacy of RIPC in attenuating ischemic myocardial injury in various animals like mice, rabbits, pigs, sheep, swine and dogs [ , , , ].
In clinical practice also, RIPC has been shown to alleviate ischemia-reperfusion injury in patients undergoing coronary angioplasty, coronary artery bypass surgery, percutaneous coronary intervention and elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair [ , ]. RIPC has also been shown to improve the coronary microcirculation in myocardial infarction and heart failure patients [ ]. In contrast, two recent multicenter, randomized trials, the Remote Ischemic Preconditioning for Heart Surgery (RIPHeart) [ ] and Effect of Remote Ischemic Preconditioning on Clinical Outcomes in Patients Undergoing Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery (ERICCA) [ ] suggest that RIPC did not confer cardioprotection in patients who underwent cardiac surgery. The possible use of propofol as primary anesthetic was proposed to be the plausible factor contributing to reducing the cardioprotective effects of RIPC [ ]. These latter studies also suggest that a number of hurdles are to be overcome before RIPC becomes fully functional in clinical practice.
Adenosine is an endogenous purine nucleoside that modulates many physiological processes like cellular homeostasis and is released in blood in response to ischemia [ ]. Adenosine acts on G-protein coupled receptors namely A 1 , A 2 a, A 2 b, A 3 for modulating various biochemical processes and transducing a variety of signals in the cells [ ]. Adenosine regulates energy metabolism and adenosine agonists have been shown to reduce myocardial ischemia-reperfusion-induced injury [ ]. Indeed, the cardioprotective effects of adenosine are mediated due to its abundant presence of receptors in the heart [ ]. Furthermore, adenosine is a critical mediator of ischemic preconditioning and contributes to cardiac resistance toward sustained ischemia-reperfusion-induced injury [ ]. Transient RIPC episodes also result in the release of substances including adenosine to activate a cascade of cardioprotective pathways and defend the myocardium toward sustained-ischemia reperfusion-induced injury [ , ]. However, the mechanisms involved in adenosine preconditioning-induced cardioprotection are unexplored.
Transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV) is a nonselective cation channel that is widely expressed in the primary sensory nerves [ ]. Different physical and chemical stimuli may activate TRPV 1 channels and subsequently trigger the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P from peripheral nerve terminals [ ]. Previous studies have witnessed that blockade of TRPV 1 in mice induces more severe cardiac injury and a significant reduction in cardiac function has been documented by exogenous administration of CGRP [ ] and TRPV 1 activation [ ]. Previous studies have documented the role of these channels in mediating ischemia-reperfusion injury [ ] and ischemic preconditioning [ ]. Ruthenium red has been employed as a TRPV channel inhibitor to explore the role of these channels in different pharmacological studies [ ].
CGRP is a member of the calcitonin family of peptides, which exists in two forms, α-CGRP and β-CGRP [ ]. The release of CGRP is regulated by various factors including ischemia, and a brief ischemic period of even 5 min may release a significant amount of CGRP in isolated guinea pig hearts [ , ]. It has been illustrated that capsaicin (TRPV 1 agonist), which provokes CGRP release from sensory nerves, protects against ischemia-reperfusion injury in the isolated perfused rat heart [ ]. The CGRP receptor antagonist CGRP-(8–37) has been shown to inhibit the cardioprotection of ischemic preconditioning [ ]. Sumatriptan has been employed as a CGRP release inhibitor in different pharmacological studies [ ]. The present study was designed to investigate the role of TRPV1 and CGRP in adenosine and remote preconditioning-induced cardioprotection in rats, using sumatriptan, a CGRP release inhibitor and ruthenium red, a TRPV inhibitor.
Material and Methods
Animals, Drugs and Chemicals
Wistar albino rats (150-220 g) were employed in the present study. They were fed on standard laboratory Chow prepared by Ashirwad Industries, Kharar, Mohali, India, and had free access to water and food. The Institutional Animal Ethics Committee approved the experimental protocol (107/99/CPCSEA/2016/04) and care of the animals was carried out as per the guidelines of the Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision of Experiments on Animals (CPCSEA), Ministry of Environment and Forest, Government of India. In the current study, adenosine (Samarth Life Sciences Pvt. Ltd., India) and sumatriptan (Sun Pharma Pvt. Ltd., India) were employed. Adenosine was dissolved in distilled water and sumatriptan was dissolved in normal saline. Based on previously published reports and pilot studies, the doses of adenosine [ ], ruthenium red [ ] and sumatriptan [ , ] were selected. Creatine phosphokinase (CK) estimation kit was obtained from Agappe Diagnostics Ltd. Kerala, India. All analytical grade chemicals were procured from S.D. Fine chemicals, Mumbai, India.
Remote Limb Preconditioning
Thiopental sodium (50 mg kg −1 , i.p.) was given to rats for anesthesia. For remote preconditioning a pressure cuff was tied around the hind limb of the rat and was inflated with air up to 150 mmHg to produce ischemia in the hind limb and during reperfusion pressure was released. Four cycles of ischemia and reperfusion, each consisting of 5 min of inflation and 5 min of deflation of the pressure cuff were used to produce remote limb preconditioning [ ]. The blood pressure cuff for neonatal mammals with the size range of 3.3 cm to 5.5 cm was employed to induce transient hind limb ischemia. Clinically, the RIPC stimulus is delivered in the form of inflation of the blood pressure cuff tied around the upper arm 20 mm greater than the systolic blood pressure followed by deflation of the cuff [ ]. Similarly, for experimental RIPC in rats, the blood pressure cuff was inflated to achieve a pressure of 150 mmHg, which is much higher than the systolic blood pressure.
Isolated Rat Heart Preparation and Measurement of Haemodynamic Parameters
The animals were heparinized about 20 min before sacrificing. The heart was rapidly isolated and immediately mounted on cannula of Langendorff apparatus [ ] within one minute. The isolated heart was perfused in reverse fashion (retrograde) at constant pressure (70 mmHg) with Kreb’s Henseleit (KH) buffer, pH 7.4, maintained at 37 °C, bubbled with 95% O 2 and 5% CO 2 . Flow rate was maintained at 7–8 ml/min. To record left ventricle developed pressure (LVDP) and its cyclic derivatives dp/dtmax and dp/dtmin, a latex balloon filled with fluid was inserted into the left ventricle and connected to a pressure transducer (AD instruments, Australia). By blocking the inflow of Kreb’s Henseleit solution, global ischemia was produced for 30 min. It was followed by reperfusion for 120 min. At different time intervals, i.e. after stabilization (immediately before ischemia), immediately after reperfusion, 5 min after reperfusion and 30 min after reperfusion, samples of coronary effluent were collected for biochemical estimations.
Assessment of Infarct Size
After reperfusion of 120 min, the heart was detached from Langerdorff apparatus and kept overnight in the freezer (−18 °C). The frozen heart was sliced into equable sections of 2–3 mm thickness. The slices were incubated in 1% TTC (triphenyl tetrazolium chloride) in 0.2 M Tris buffer (pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 20 min. The NADH and dehydrogenase enzyme present in the viable cells convert TTC to red formazane pigment, which results in deep red staining of viable tissue. The infarcted cells which lack the enzyme and cofactor remain unstained or dull yellow [ ]. The heart slices were positioned between two glass slides. A transparent plastic grid with 100 squares in 1 cm 2 was placed above it. The numbers of squares falling on an infarcted and non-infarcted portion on either side were calculated and infarct size was expressed in % volume. Infarcted dull yellow part and red strained parts were dissected apart and weighed to express the infarct size as a percentage of weight [ ].
Estimation of Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH)
Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was estimated by 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine method as described by King [ ], in samples of coronary effluent collected after stabilization of the heart, immediately after reperfusion and 30 min after reperfusion.
Estimation of Creatine Kinase (CK)
The levels of CK in the coronary effluent were estimated using a diagnostic kit procured from Agappe Diagnostics Ltd. Kerala, India. The levels were estimated in coronary effluents collected after stabilization and 5 min after reperfusion.
Experimental Protocol
The following groups, each comprising six Wistar albino rats, were employed in the present study: ( Fig. 1 ) Fig. 1 Diagrammatic representation of experimental protocol
Group I (Sham Ischemic Control)
A blood pressure cuff was tied around the hind limb, but was not subjected to inflation/deflation. After that the rat heart was removed and perfused on Langendorff’s apparatus. The heart was allowed to stabilize for 10 min followed by 30 min of global ischemia and 120 min of reperfusion.
Group II (RIPC)
A blood pressure cuff was tied around the hind limb of anaesthetized rats and was inflated to produce ischemia in the hind limb and deflated to reperfuse the limb. Four episodes of ischemia and reperfusion, each comprising of 5 min of inflation and 5 min of deflation, were used to produce remote limb preconditioning. Immediately after the last episode of remote preconditioning, the heart was isolated and subjected to 30 min global ischemia followed by 120 min reperfusion as described in group I.
Groups III and IV (Adenosine Preconditioning 2 mg/Kg and 4 mg/Kg, respectively)
Adenosine (2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg i.p.) was injected intraperitoneally 40 min before removing the heart. Thereafter, the heart was subjected to 30 min of global ischemia followed by 120 min of reperfusion as discussed in group I.
Group V (Sumatriptan in RIPC)
Rats were administered sumatriptan (8 mg/kg i.p.) 30 min before RIPC as described in group II. Subsequently, the isolated rat heart was subjected to 30 min of global ischemia followed by 120 min of reperfusion.
Group VI (Ruthenium Red in Adenosine Preconditioning)
Rats were administered ruthenium red (8 mg/kg i.p.) 30 min before administering adenosine (4 mg/kg i.p.). After 40 min, the heart was subjected to ischemia and reperfusion as described in group I.
Group VII (Sumatriptan in Adenosine Preconditioning)
Rats were administered sumatriptan (8 mg/kg i.p.) 30 min before adenosine administration. After 40 min, the heart was subjected to 30 min of global ischemia followed by 120 min of reperfusion.
Group VIII (Sumtriptan in Sham Ischemic Control)
Rats were administered sumatriptan (8 mg/kg i.p.) 70 min before the heart was removed and perfused on Langendorff’s apparatus. The heart was allowed to stabilize for 10 min followed by 30 min of global ischemia and 120 min of reperfusion.
Group IX (Ruthenium Red in Sham Ischemic Control)
Rats were administered ruthenium red (8 mg/kg i.p.) 70 min before the heart was removed and perfused on Langendorff’s apparatus. The heart was allowed to stabilize for 10 min followed by 30 min of global ischemia and 120 min of reperfusion.
Statistical Analysis
The results were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). The statistical analysis for LDH, CK, % change in LVDP, +dp/dtmax, and -dp/dtmin was done using two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferonni’s post hoc test, while the results of infarct size were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple range test for post hoc analysis. A value of p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
Results
Effect of Remote Preconditioning and Different Pharmacological Interventions on Myocardial Infarct Size
Myocardial injury was significant following 30 min of global ischemia and 120 min of reperfusion, in terms of increase in myocardial infarct size, both by volume and weight methods. Approximately 58 ± 4.0% of myocardial tissue was found to be infarcted during ischemia-reperfusion injury. However, four alternate episodes of inflation (5 min) and deflation (5 min) of blood pressure cuff on the hind limb in the form of remote preconditioning (RIPC) significantly abrogated the ischemia-reperfusion induced increase in myocardial infarct size. A significant reduction in infarct size (34 ± 4.0%) was observed in RIPC treated animals as compared to the sham group. Administration of sumatriptan (8 mg/kg i.p.) and ruthenium red (8 mg/kg i.p.) before the RIPC abolished the infarct-sparing effect of RIPC in a significant manner. Moreover, exogenous treatment of adenosine (2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg i.p.) elicited infarct-sparing effect like RIPC. Administration of ruthenium red (8 mg/kg i.p.) and sumatriptan (8 mg/kg i.p.) also abolished the infarct-sparing effect of adenosine in a significant manner ( Fig. 2 ). However, administration of ruthenium red (8 mg/kg i.p.) and sumatriptan (8 mg/kg i.p.) in rats prior to removal of the heart and perfusion on Langendorff system did not modulate ischemia-reperfusion-induced increase in infarct size in the sham ischemic control group.

Data were statistically analyzed by using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple range tests. Values were expressed as mean ± S.D. with n = 6 in each group. For weight method, a = p < 0.05 Vs Sham; b = p < 0.05 Vs RIPC (Remote Ischemic Preconditioning.); c = p < 0.05 Vs adenosine preconditioning
Effects of RIPC and Different Pharmacological Interventions on LVDP, +Dp/Dtmax and -Dp/Dtmin
There were no significant differences in the basal values of LVDP, +dp/dtmax, and -dp/dtmin between different experimental groups at the end of 10 min of stabilization period. After the induction of ischemic reperfusion injury, a marked drop in contractility parameters i.e. LVDP, +dp/dtmax, and -dp/dtmin during reperfusion period was observed. Remote preconditioning and pharmacological preconditioning with adenosine (2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg i.p.), enhanced the recovery of the ventricles after I/R injury, when compared with the sham group at different time intervals of reperfusion. On the other side, administration of ruthenium red (8 mg/kg i.p.) and sumatriptan (8 mg/kg i.p.) significantly abrogated the improvement in post-ischemic cardiac performance in RIPC and adenosine-treated animals during the reperfusion period However, administration of ruthenium red (8 mg/kg i.p.) and sumatriptan (8 mg/kg i.p.) did not modulate ischemia-reperfusion-induced decreases in contractility parameters in the sham ischemic control group ( Tables 1 , 2 and 3 ).

Effect of Remote Preconditioning and Different Pharmacological Interventions on the Release of Creatine Kinase (CK) in Coronary Effluent
The peak rise in the release of creatine kinase in the coronary effluent was recorded at 5 min of reperfusion following 30 min of global ischemia. RIPC and pharmacological preconditioning with adenosine significantly attenuated the I/R-induced increase in creatine kinase release in the coronary effluent, as compared with the sham group. Conversely, pre-treatment with ruthenium red (8 mg/kg i.p.) and sumatriptan (8 mg/kg i.p.) abolished the creatine kinase release attenuating the effects of RIPC and adenosine preconditioning (Fig. 3 ). However, administration of ruthenium red (8 mg/kg i.p.) and sumatriptan (8 mg/kg i.p.) did not modulate ischemia-reperfusion-induced increase in CK release in the sham ischemic control group.

The peak rise in the release of LDH in the coronary effluent was documented immediately after reperfusion and at 30 min of reperfusion RIPC and pharmacological preconditioning with adenosine (2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg i.p.) significantly attenuated I/R-induced increased release of lactate dehydrogenase at different time periods. Pre-treatment with ruthenium red (8 mg/kg i.p.) and sumatriptan (8 mg/kg i.p.) abolished LDH release attenuating the effect of RIPC and adenosine preconditioning ( Fig. 4 ) However, administration of ruthenium red (8 mg/kg i.p.) and sumatriptan (8 mg/kg i.p.) did not modulate ischemia-reperfusion-induced increase in LDH release in the sham ischemic control group.

Discussion
In the present investigation, 30 min of global ischemia followed by 120 min of reperfusion produced significant myocardial injury assessed in terms of increase in infarct size, increase in the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK) in the coronary effluent. Furthermore, there was a significant decrease in the cardiac contractility parameters including LVDP, +dp/dtmax, and -dp/dtmin. Ischemia-reperfusion-induced changes in the present study are in consonance with our previous studies [ ]. Four episodes involving inflation (5 min) and deflation (5 min) of pressure cuff tied around the hind limb of rats in the form of RIPC significantly decreased ischemia and reperfusion-induced myocardial injury in terms of LDH, CK release, infarct size and contractility parameters. The results obtained in this investigation are consistent with our earlier reports of remote renal preconditioning [ , ] and remote hind limb preconditioning-induced [ , ] cardioprotection.
In the present investigation, pharmacological preconditioning with adenosine mimicked the cardioprotective effects of RIPC against ischemia reperfusion-injury. There have been a number of studies suggesting adenosine as a critical mediator of RIPC [ , ]. In response to an RIPC stimulus, the levels of adenosine are shown to be increased in the serum [ ]. Furthermore, pharmacological antagonists of adenosine are shown to abolish cardioprotective effects of RIPC [ , ]. In the present study, administration of ruthenium red, a non-selective TRPV antagonist, abolished the cardioprotective effects of adenosine preconditioning suggesting that adenosine mediated cardioprotection may be mediated through activation of TRPV channels. An earlier study from our research group demonstrated that ruthenium red abolishes the cardioprotective effects of RIPC, suggesting the involvement of TRPV channels in RIPC-induced cardioprotection [ ]. In the present investigation, administration of ruthenium red in rats before heart isolation and perfusion did not modulate ischemia-reperfusion injury in sham ischemic control animals, suggesting a lack of pharmacological preconditioning effects of ruthenium red.
TRPV channels belong to the category of mechanosensitive channels and are localized on the sensory nerve endings innervating the heart [ ], sciatic nerve [ ] and skeletal muscles [ , ]. Lu et al. stated that hypoxic preconditioning-dependent cardioprotective effects are mediated via activation of TRPV 1 receptors [ ]. Furthermore, previous studies have indicated that ischemic preconditioning-induced cardioprotective effects were completely abrogated in TRPV 1 −/− mice supporting the key role of these channels in mediating cardioprotection [ ]. Apart from ruthenium red as a TRPV blocker, it also blocks ryanodine receptors [ ] suggesting the possible role of ryanodine receptors in RIPC-induced cardioprotection. Our present study is a continuation of our previous studies in which ruthenium red and capsazepine, a selective TRPV 1 antagonist, have been shown to block the effects of RIPC to a comparable degree and capsaicin, a selective TRPV 1 agonist, was shown to mimic the cardioprotective effects of RIPC [ , ]. Accordingly, it was hypothesized that the activation of TRPV 1 is involved in RIPC-induced cardioprotection.
TRPV 1 receptors are primarily localized on the pre-synaptic nerve terminals of the sensory nerve endings innervating the different tissues, including the heart [ , ]. Most of the effects of TRPV 1 receptors are mediated through CGRP, which is released in response to TRPV 1 activation [ ]. In the present study, the cardioprotective effects of adenosine preconditioning and RIPC were abolished in the presence of the CGRP release inhibitor sumatriptan, suggesting that CGRP may be possibly involved in adenosine preconditioning and RIPC-induced cardioprotection. There have been studies suggesting a role of CGRP in ischemic and remote preconditioning-induced cardioprotection [ , ]. Furthermore, it has been reported that short episodes of mesenteric artery occlusion and reperfusion in the form of RIPC significantly increase the CGRP levels in plasma levels [ ]. The precise molecular mechanisms involved in CGRP mediated cardioprotection are not defined. However, it has been proposed that CGRP possibly reduces the free radical generation and neutrophil infiltration to provide protection against ischemia-reperfusion injury [ , ].
Sumatriptan is a 5-HT 1B/1D receptor agonist and has been widely used in the management of migraine due to its cranio-selective vasoconstriction and CGRP release decreasing activities [ ]. Sumatriptan produces vasoconstriction due to its 5-HT 1B/1D receptor agonist activity, however, its actions are preferentially limited to cranial blood vessels as compared to coronary arteries [ ]. A previous study of Le Grand et al. demonstrated that sumatriptan did not modulate coronary flow rate and left ventricular developed pressure in normal isolated perfused guinea pig hearts [ ]. Furthermore, in the present investigation, in vivo administration of sumatriptan in rats prior to removal of the heart and perfusion on Langendorff system did not modulate ischemia-reperfusion-injury suggesting a lack of pharmacological preconditioning.
Based on this, it may be hypothesized that during RIPC and adenosine preconditioning the activation of TRPV channels is followed by CGRP release, which subsequently acts on its receptors localized in the heart to induce cardioprotection. However, it may not be ruled out that apart from TRPV blockade and inhibition of CGRP release, the additional pharmacological actions of ruthenium red (ryanodine receptor blockade) and sumatriptan (5-HT 1B/1D receptor activation), respectively may influence the cardioprotective effects of RIPC and adenosine preconditioning. Nevertheless, further studies with highly specific pharmacological antagonists and CGRP measurement in the blood may establish the role of TRPV 1 channels and CGRP in RIPC and adenosine preconditioning-induced cardioprotection.
