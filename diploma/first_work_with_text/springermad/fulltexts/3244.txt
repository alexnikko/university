INTRODUCTION
Haloperidol (Hal) is a dopamine D 2 receptor antagonist. It is a commonly used typical antipsychotic drug. It can be used for the treatment of acute schizophrenia and for maintenance therapy too. It can also be used for treatment of mania and other psychiatric disorders ( , ). Upon oral administration, the liver metabolizes about 50% of the given dose leading to limited bioavailability ( ). Also, the invasiveness of the intramuscular route makes it unpreferred to most patients.
Accordingly, the transdermal route may represent a potentially suitable alternative. By possessing log P value of 4.3, small molecular weight of 375.9, solubility of 14μg/ml in water ( ), and a low therapeutic concentration of about 2–13ng/ml ( ), Hal represents a potentially promising candidate for transdermal drug delivery. The maximal flux of Hal from aqueous vehicle was predicted theoretically from its molecular structure to be about 0.15μg/cm 2 .h ( , ). Yet, practically, stratum corneum (SC) binds Hal strongly leading to limited permeation ( ). Among the different trials to increase the amount of Hal permeated across the skin are the application of proniosomal gels ( ), penetration enhancers (PEs) like farnesol ( ), and limonene ( ), and finally using iontophoresis as a physical technique ( ).
Spanlastics are nanovesicular colloidal drug carriers made of nonionic surfactants. They are uni- or multilamellar spherical structures like liposomes and niosomes ( ). They consist mainly of Span®, as a lipophilic nonionic surfactant, together with an edge activator; which imparts elasticity to the nanovesicles. They are promising in dermal, ocular, and intestinal drug delivery ( , , ).
So, this work aimed to formulate Hal spanlastics for transdermal delivery. Spanlastics were thought to be capable of sustaining the release and increasing the permeation of Hal. This would achieve similar therapeutic outcomes to the oral route with lower doses and less frequent administration.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
Haloperidol (Hal) was a kind gift from Al Kahira Pharmaceutical Company, Cairo, Egypt. Tween®80, absolute ethanol, methanol, isopropyl alcohol, D,L-Lactic acid, propylene glycol, anhydrous disodium hydrogen phosphate, anhydrous potassium dihydrogen phosphate, sodium chloride, and sodium acetate trihydrate of analytical grade were purchased from El-Nasr Pharmaceutical Chemicals Company, Cairo, Egypt. Methanol (HPLC grade), acetonitrile (HPLC grade), Span®60, Pluronic®F68, and Tween®60 were bought from Sigma Chemical Company, USA. The semipermeable membrane tubing (Spectra Por©) of molecular weight cutoff 12,000–14,000 was bought from Spectrum Laboratories Inc., CA, USA. The animal house of Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo University, Egypt, supplied the hairless, newborn rat skin.
Determination of equilibrium solubility of Hal in phosphate buffer saline pH7.4 (PBS)-ethanol (1:1) mixture and in lactic acid solution (0.03%v/v)
Hal equilibrium solubility was determined according to the method described by Tenjarla et al ( ). An excess quantity of Hal was added to 10ml of test medium in screw-capped glass vials. These vials were placed in a thermostatically controlled shaking water bath (GFL, Gesellschatt Laboratories, Berlin, Germany) operating for 48h at 37°C at 50 strokes per minute. The solution was then filtered through 0.45μm membrane filter, and the filtrate was spectrophotometrically analyzed at λ max of Hal (248nm) using UV/Vis spectrophotometer (model UV-1601 PC, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) after suitable dilution, in order to determine the amount of drug dissolved. The experiment was carried out in triplicate.
Experimental design
For investigating how selected independent variables influenced the spanlastics characteristics, a factorial design (3 1 .4 1 ) (Table I ) was used. In this factorial design, edge activator type (EA type) ( X 1 ) and Span®60 to edge activator ratio (S60:EA ratio) ( X 2 ) were selected as independent variables. Twelve formulae resulted. Their compositions are listed in Table II . The chosen dependent variables were percentage entrapment efficiency (EE%) ( Y 1 ), particle size (PS) ( Y 2 ), deformability index (DI) ( Y 3 ), and percentage drug released after 4h (Q4h) ( Y 4 ). To detect the significance of independent variables and the significance between the levels of each significant variable, ANOVA factorial followed by Fisher’s PLSD post hoc tests, if needed, was employed using Abacus® Statview® software V 4.51. Selection criteria (Table I ) were to achieve highest values for EE%, DI, and Q4h and to obtain the least possible PS. Choice of selected formulae (SF) would be based on the desirability criterion using the Design-Expert-7® software. Significant differences between the response values for different SF were detected using one-way ANOVA.

Preparation of Hal-loaded spanlastics
Spanlastic dispersions of Hal were made using the ethanol injection method ( ). The aqueous phase (of temperature 60°C), which is an edge activator (EA) (Pluronic®F68, Tween®80 or Tween®60) solution, was magnetically stirred using a magnetic stirrer (Model MSH-20D, Witeg Labortechnik GmbH Germany) at 800rpm. Ethanol solution of Hal and Span®60 was injected dropwise into the aqueous phase. The volume ratio of organic phase to EA solution (aqueous phase) was 1:5. The ratios of Span®60 to EA investigated were 9:1, 8:2, 6:4, and 5:5, respectively. The spanlastics were spontaneously formed turning the resulting solution slightly turbid. The formed turbid solution was left on the magnetic stirrer for 30min for removal of ethanol by evaporation. The resultant aqueous dispersions of Hal spanlastics were subjected to sonication for 5min using an ultrasonic water bath sonicator (Crest Ultrasonics Corp., Trenton, USA) to aid the formation of spanlastics of smaller particle size.
Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR)
The FT-IR spectral analysis was performed to test whether a chemical intermolecular interactions may be present between Hal, Span®60, and the EA. Pure Hal, its mixture with Span®60, and its mixture with the EA of choice were scanned in the spectral region between 4000 and 400cm −1 using Affinity-1 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Measurements were done after purging the detector with dry nitrogen gas for moisture reduction and increasing the signal level ( ).
In vitro characterization
Drug content and EE%
Spanlastic lysis was performed using methanol ( , ). Total drug content (free + entrapped) of each formula was determined by dissolving 0.2ml of it in methanol to make 25ml. Hal concentration in the resultant solution was determined spectrophotometrically at λ max (243nm). The EE% was determined by filtration of the formula using Whatman filter paper (grade No. 1, 11μm). Owing to its extremely low solubility in water, the unentrapped Hal was sedimented and trapped over the filter paper ( , ). Meanwhile, Hal containing vesicles passed through the filter paper into the filtrate. Then, the filtrate was treated as mentioned for determination of drug content. The percentage of drug entrapped was calculated using the following formula: $$ EE\%=\frac{amount\ of\ haloperidol\ entrapped\ (mg)}{total\ drug\ content\ (mg)}\times 100 $$ (1)
Determination of PS, polydispersity index (PDI), and zeta potential (ZP) of the prepared spanlastics
The mean PS, PDI, and ZP were determined by Zetasizer (Malvern Instrument Ltd., Worcestershire, UK) at 25°C. The PDI indicates the vesicle size distribution. The formulation was properly diluted with distilled water to have a suitable scattering intensity before PS measurement ( ). The ZP measurement was carried out by observing the electrophoretic mobility of charged spanlastics in distilled water under an electrical field ( ). Two replicates were prepared for each formula, each measured twice.
Measurement of spanlastics elasticity
Comparative measurement of elasticity was performed by extruding vesicles suspension through cellulose acetate filters of 200nm pore size ( , ) under a pressure of 2.5 bar using air compressor (Haug Kompressoren AG, Büchi Labortechnik AG, Flawil, Switzerland). The expression of spanlastic membrane elasticity in terms of deformability index (DI) was according to the following equation ( ): $$ \mathrm{DI}=J\ {\left(\frac{r_{\mathrm{v}}}{r_{\mathrm{p}}}\right)}^2 $$ (2)
Where J is the weight of dispersion extruded in 10min, r v is the size of vesicles after extrusion (nm), and r p is the pore size of the barrier (nm).
In vitro release of Hal from the prepared spanlastics
The release of Hal from spanlastics was performed using the in vitro dialyzing method at 37°C and 50 strokes per minute, for 4h in the thermostatically controlled water bath shaker ( ). Presoaked Spectra Por© semipermeable membrane tubing is used as the dialysis membrane. The release medium was a mixture of PBS and ethanol (1:1). An amount of each spanlastic suspension, equivalent to 5mg drug, was loaded and sealed in 5cm tubing, placed in amber-colored glass bottles containing 50ml of the release medium and fitted in the horizontal shaker. Aliquots of 1ml each were taken at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4h time intervals and analyzed for drug content. Equal volumes of fresh medium were added to make up for the decrease in medium volume. The release trials were performed in triplicates.
Lyophilization of selected formulae (SF) for differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) investigation
For each SF, the filtrate containing Hal spanlastics after removal of unentrapped Hal was obtained as mentioned before. The filtrate was frozen and lyophilized for 24h at − 45°C under a pressure of 7×10 −2 mbar using a lyophilizer (Novalyphe-NL 500, Savant Instruments; NY, USA). DSC analysis of lyophilized SF was performed in comparison to pure Hal, Span®60, and Hal-Span®60-Tween®80 physical mixture. Each sample (3–4mg) was heated in hermetically sealed flat-bottomed aluminum pan over a temperature range of 30 to 250°C, at a constant heating rate of 10°C/min, under an inert nitrogen flow of 30ml/min. A previously calibrated (purified indium of 99.9%) differential scanning calorimeter (Shimadzu DSC 50; Kyoto, Japan) was used for recording DSC thermograms ( ).
Ex vivo permeation
The institutional review board, Research Ethics Committee-Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo University (REC-FOPCU), reviewed and approved the protocol of the study.
Dorsal skin of newly born rats was excised after rat scarification and prepared as previously stated ( , ). Hal permeation, through the prepared rat skin into 0.03% v / v lactic acid solution, from each SF and the Hal solution in propylene glycol (PG) was studied ( ). The skin was allowed to thaw then it was soaked in PBS for 2h before the experiment. The skin was mounted on a plastic dialysis tube with 1.5cm 2 cross sectional area ( n = 3 per formula). The donor compartment contained an amount of a SF or Hal solution equivalent to 5mg Hal placed on the stratum corneum (SC) side while the permeation medium was 30ml of lactic acid solution stirred at 100rpm at 37 ± 0.5°C. For up to 2h, no drug could be detected in preliminary studies. So, sampling started at 2h. Half ml of receptor medium was withdrawn at (2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48h). Each removed sample was immediately replaced by fresh lactic acid solution to guard against receptor medium volume change and maintain sink conditions. Samples were analyzed using a validated HPLC method ( , ).
Permeation data representation and statistical analysis
The cumulative amounts of drug permeated per unit area ( Q ) (μg/cm 2 ) were plotted against time for representing the permeation profiles of different formulae. The average flux ( J ) (μg/cm 2 .h) was the slope of the permeation profile ( ). SPSS 20 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA) was used for application of one-way ANOVA for detection of significant differences in Q and J at 24, 36, and 48h and lag time among different formulae and Hal solution. The best formula would be chosen for obtaining the highest permeability based on these statistical analyses results.
RESULTS
Equilibrium solubility of haloperidol (Hal) in phosphate buffer saline (PBS)-ethanol (1:1) mixture and in lactic acid solution (0.03% v/v)
The equilibrium solubility of Hal in a mixture of PBS-ethanol (1:1) was 0.726 ± 0.02 mg/ml and in lactic acid solution (0.03% v / v ) it was 1.16 ± 0.08 mg/ml.
Preparation of Hal spanlastics
Various spanlastic dispersions were successfully prepared. Preliminary studies showed that a sonication time of 5min led to a good compromise between suitable particle size (PS) and percentage entrapment efficiency (EE %).
Fourier-transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) studies
Figure 1 a–c show the FT-IR spectra of pure Hal, its physical mixture (1:1) with individual excipients. The FT-IR spectrum of pure Hal showed characteristic peaks at 3124.68 (aliphatic O–H stretch) and 1678.07 cm −1 (–C=O stretching). No considerable changes in the peaks were observed in the spectra of Hal with excipients.

Table III illustrates that the ranges of EE%, PS, PDI, ZP, and DI for all the prepared spanlastics ranged from 29.61 to 99.2%, 133.8 to 375.2nm, 0.22 to 0.57, − 28.3 to − 37.38mV, and 0.7 to 4.3 respectively.

In vitro release of Hal from the prepared spanlastics
The results of the in vitro release of Hal from the prepared formulae in comparison with that of drug solution in PBS-ethanol mixture (1:1) are graphically illustrated in Fig. 2 a–c. It is evident that the release of the drug from its solution is much faster than that from the spanlastic formulae.

Factorial design analysis
The effects of the studied variables on different responses are shown in Fig. 3 a-h. Fig. 3 Effect of the studied factors (type of EA on the left and Span®60 to EA ratio on the right) on EE %( a and b ), PS ( c and d ), DI ( e and f ), and Q 4h ( g and h )
Effect of independent variables (IVs) on EE% of Hal spanlastics
The obtained EE% values ranged from 29.61 to 99.2% (Table III ). Figure 3 a and b show the effect of the studied factors (edge activator type (EA type) and Span®60 to edge activator ratio (S60 to EA ratio)) on the EE% of the nanovesicular formulae. The ANOVA results showed that both factors significantly affected the EE% of the prepared formulae ( p = 0.0008 for EA type and p < 0.0001 for S60:EA ratio).
Fisher’s PLSD test for EA type showed that Tween®60 containing spanlastics had significantly lower EE % than Tween®80 and Pluronic®F68 containing ones.
With respect to S60 to EA ratio, Fisher’s PLSD test showed that S60 to EA ratios of 9:1 and 8:2 were not significantly different. As the ratio decreases below 8:2, the EE % decreases significantly.
Effect of IVs on PS of Hal spanlastics
The obtained PS values ranged from 133.8 to 375.2nm (Table III ). Figure 3 c and d show the effect of the two independent variables on the PS of the nanovesicles. The ANOVA results revealed that both factors significantly affected the PS of the spanlastics ( p < 0.0001).
Fisher’s PLSD test showed that the smallest PS was observed in the case of nanovesicles prepared using Tween®80 followed by Tween®60 then Pluronic®F68.
Fisher’s PLSD test for S60 to EA ratio showed that the smallest PS was obtained in formulae prepared using the highest EA contents (6:4 and 5:5). These two ratios were not significantly different from each other. Yet, both were significantly different from the other two ratios (9:1 and 8:2).
Effect of IVs on DI of Hal spanlastics
The obtained DI values ranged from 0.66 to 4.34g (Table III ). Neither of the independent variables significantly affected the DI of formulae ( p = 0.159 for the EA type and p = 0.4623 for the span to EA ratio) (Fig. 3 e and f).
Effect of IVs on the percentage of drug released after 4 hours (Q4h) of Hal spanlastics
The percentage of drug released after 4h ranged from 36.38% to 47.92% (Table III ). Both EA type and S60 to EA ratio significantly affected Q4h ( p = 0.0186 for the EA type, p = 0.0007 for the S60 to EA ratio (Fig. 3 g and h).
With respect to EA type, Fisher’s PLSD test showed that lower drug released percentages were achieved with Tween®60-containing spanlastic vesicles. On the other hand, Tween®80 and Pluronic®F68-containing spanlastics were not significantly different from each other. With respect to S60 to EA ratio, Fisher’s PLSD test showed that spanlastics prepared using 9:1 ratio released significantly lower amounts of the drug after 4h. The other ratios proved to be nonsignificantly different from one other.
Choice of selected formulae (SF) based on the desirability criterion
SF were to be chosen according to the degree of fulfilling the constraints listed in Table I which were chosen to produce high quality spanlastics. Both independent variables had no significant effect on DI, so they were excluded from the selection criteria. Desirability of each formula (F1–F12) was calculated using Design-Expert- 7® software ( ). Formula F6, composed of Span®60 and Tween®80 as an EA at the weight ratio of 8:2, had the highest desirability value (0.747), followed by F7, composed of Span®60 and Tween®80 as an EA at the weight ratio of 6:4 which had a desirability value of 0.725. Thus, F6 and F7 were both chosen for further investigation as one-way ANOVA comparison between F6 and F7 showed that F6 had significantly more entrapped Hal, while F7 had a significantly smaller PS (Table III ).
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)
The DSC thermograms of Hal, Span®60, Hal-Span®60-Tween®80 physical mixture, and lyophilized SF (F6 and F7) are illustrated in Fig. 4 a–e. The DSC thermogram of Hal showed one sharp endothermic peak at 153.7°C corresponding to its melting point ( ). The endothermic peak corresponding to the melting point of Span®60 at 56.5°C appeared in its DSC thermogram ( ). The individual peaks for Span®60 and Hal appeared at lower temperatures, 55.6 and 141.3°C, respectively, in their physical mixture DSC thermogram. The DSC thermogram of SF showed two broad endothermic peaks for each formula at 48.5°C and 117.9°C and at 48.2°C and 117.4°C for F6 and F7, respectively. Fig. 4 DSC thermograms of pure Hal ( a ), Span®60 ( b ), Hal-Span®60-Tween®80 physical mixture ( c ), lyophilized spanlastic formula (F6) ( d ), and lyophilized spanlastic formula (F7) ( e )
Ex vivo permeation
The permeation profiles for F6 and F7 along with Hal solution are represented in Fig. 5 . It’s clear that the drug entrapment in spanlastics decreased the lag time and increased the total amount permeated per unit area ( Q ) and the average flux value ( J ) in comparison with drug solution. Q and J were calculated at 24, 36, and 48h for Hal solution in propylene glycol (PG), F6, and F7. This obtained data along with the lag times are shown in Table IV .

Statistical analysis of (Q), (J), and lag time data
It is obvious from Table IV that the Q and J values are higher for the spanlastic formulae than for the drug solution, with shorter lag times. Upon analysis of different Duncan’s tests, highest Hal permeation enhancement was found with F7. It was of the highest subset in Q 24 , Q 48 , J 24, and J 48 and the lower subset in lag time. Also, it had significantly higher Q 36 and J 36 than F6 and Hal solution.
DISCUSSION
Preparation of haloperidol (Hal) spanlastics
Span®60 (sorbitan monostearate) is a lipophilic nonionic surfactant of HLB 4.7. Its saturated alkyl chain has a lipophilic nature that would allow the formation of mono and/or multilamellar matrix vesicles. The presence of an edge activator (Tween®60, Tween®80, or Pluronic®F68) can decrease the stability of the spanlastics membranes, increasing their deformability by lowering the interfacial tension and thus creating systems whose packing characteristics differ in their degree of disruption ( ). This would impart a higher elastic nature to the spanlastics allowing them to squeeze in through slightly smaller pores and increase drug penetration ( ).
Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR)
The preservation of characteristic drug peaks in the physical mixtures with the two surfactants ensures that there had been no interference. Hal can be used with no problems with these surfactants.
Polydispersity index (PDI) and zeta potential (ZP)
The aforementioned PDI range means that the vesicles were to somewhat heterogeneous ( ). Also, the ZP values may indicate the good physical stability of the nanovesicles ( ).
Deformability index (DI)
Based on the insignificant effect of the tested variables on DI, this response was excluded from formulae selection process.
Effects of the studied factors on the measured responses
Edge activator (EA) type
Tween®60-based spanlastics had significantly lower percentage entrapment efficiency (EE%) than either those containing Tween®80 or Pluronic®F68 as EA. That was not expected as it was predicted that Tween®60-based spanlastics would be superior. On one hand, it is saturated unlike Tween®80. Tayel et al . reported that Tween®80 presence in the vesicular membrane decreased its tightness. This was owed to the ability of Tween®80 alkyl chains to bend due to their unsaturation. This bending can increase the permeability of the spanlastics membrane and increase the probability of escaping of drugs to the outside. On the contrary, Tween®60 would lead to the formation of more rigid spanlastics membranes that can decrease the drug leakage due to absence of unsaturation in its alkyl chains ( , ). On the second hand, Abdelrahman et al . ( ) suggested that a lipophilic drug may prefer being entrapped in more hydrophobic vesicles; so, Hal, being a lipophilic drug, might prefer being entrapped in the relatively lipophilic spanlastics containing Tween®60 (HLB = 16) rather than the relatively polar ones containing Pluronic®F68 or Tween®80 (HLB > 24). That was not the case in our study. The formulae containing Tween®60 as EA were relatively more viscous during formulation. This may be a sign of early hardening of the vesicles that might have led to certain inability of Hal to partition effectively into the formed vesicles resulting into relatively lower EE% ( ).
Tween®80-based spanlastics were significantly smaller than the other ones. That might be due to the fact that Tween®80 is less bulky than Pluronic®F68, and having a site of unsaturation which is not present in Tween®60. Both characters might have resulted into enhancement of the bending of chains which led to the formation of smaller vesicles. These assumptions were supported by the results reported by Tayel et al . ( ) who found that Tween® 80-based spanlastics were significantly smaller than those based on Tween®60. Also, Tween®60-based spanlastics exhibited significantly smaller particle size (PS) than Pluronic®F68-based ones. This may be attributed to the smaller molecular weight of Tween®60 making it less bulky upon its integration into the vesicles’ membranes.
However, the EA-type effect on the percentage of drug released after 4h (Q4h) was in line with that reported by Abdelbary et al . and Tayel et al ., who found that the release rate of gentamicin and pravastatin from Tween®60-based niosomes and spanlastics, respectively, is lower than that of containing Tween®80. This was explained in the light of the release dependence on alkyl chain characters. The unsaturated chains of Tween®80 would not be able to form rigid condensed membranes, allowing for the release of higher drug percentages ( , ). As for Pluronic®F68, it was insignificantly different from Tween®80 as it contains a relatively large number of hydroxyl groups aiding in rapid interaction which the release medium and subsequent rapid drug release ( , ).
Span®60 to edge activator ratio (Span®60 to EA ratio)
At the higher EA ratios (> 20%), there was a significant decrease in EE%. That might be due to those higher concentrations of EA that produced destabilization in the vesicle bilayer membranes ( , , ), which could lead to decreased EE% due to pore formation ( , ). Higher EA level may also lead to diffusion of the drug outside the nanovesicles into the dispersion medium during their preparation due to higher drug solubilization ( ). In addition, upon elevating the EA content beyond certain limit, another reason for the decrease in EE% may be the beginning of micelles or mixed micelle formation ( , ). These suggestions were supported by Al-mahallawi et al ., who found that increasing sodium cholate concentration negatively affected the EE% of ciprofloxacin in transferosomes ( ).
Spanlastics containing EA more than 20% had significantly lower PS than those containing lower EA content. That may be attributed to the formation of smaller spanlastics due to the lowered interfacial tension in the presence of higher levels of EA, ( ). Also, there may be an increase in emulsification power associated with the use of higher concentrations of EAs. This may be due to the lower EA concentrations that are insufficient to cover the whole spanlastics surface. So, some vesicles would aggregate in an attempt to decrease their surface area such that the amount of the EA present could coat the whole surface of the agglomerate. This would lead to the formation of larger spanlastics and a relatively more stable dispersion ( ). Also, insertion of more alkyl chains of Span®60 into the hydrophobic part of the spanlastics led to reducing the interaction between the polar heads of the EA molecules and subsequently increasing the spanlastics size ( ). In addition, at high EA levels, mixed micelles may be formed instead of vesicles. These mixed micelles are smaller in size leading to lower measured PS ( , , ). These suggestions were supported by Tayel et al ., who found that using Span®60 and EAs at the ratio of 1:1 produced significantly smaller pravastatin-loaded spanlastics than other higher ratios ( ).
The significantly lower Q4h found with S60 to EA ratio of 9:1 relative to other ratios could be explained in accordance with PS and the solubilizing effect of the EA. At each time point, the amount of the dissolved drug in the receptor medium is inversely proportional to the radius of the spanlastics. Then at higher edge activator concentrations, the smaller spanlastics would reduce the drug diffusional distance and subsequently this leads to higher drug dissolution rates ( , ). Also, the higher EA concentrations lead to increased fluidity of the vesicles membranes and increase the permeability of the vesicles membranes and thus promote the drug release ( , , ). These suggestions were supported by Al-mahallawi et al . ( ), who found that using increased concentrations of sodium cholate as EA led to significant increase in ciprofloxacin released per time from transferosomes.
Choice of selected formulae (SF)
The value of desirability for each formula is based on the degree to which this formula simultaneously fulfills the predetermined constraints. In this study, two formulae (F6 and F7) were chosen as SF. They had nearly the same Q4h, yet they had different trade-offs with respect to EE% and PS. F6 had significantly higher EE% yet larger PS while F7 had significantly lower PS yet lower EE%. Performing ex vivo study on these two formulae enabled testing how EE% and PS affected transdermal permeation of Hal from spanlastic formulae.
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)
DSC is used to explore the thermotropic properties of the samples, assess their degree of crystallinity, and detect the presence of interactions. According to Kakkar and Kaur ( ), the presence of interaction is indicated by the elimination of melting peak(s), the appearance of new peak(s), the changes in the peak shape, onset, area, or enthalpy. The measuring temperature range of the adopted DSC equipment extends from 25 to 725°C. Thus, being a liquid at room temperature, the thermotropic properties of Tween®80 could not be evaluated in this work. It was clear that thermograms of Hal and Span®60 describe typical crystalline materials. The shift of individual peaks in the physical mixture may be attributed to the possible interaction between Hal, melted Span®60, and Tween®80. Regarding F6 and F7, the lowering of the melting point of Span®60 from 56.5 to 48.5°C and 48.2°C in F6 and F7, respectively, elucidates the role of Tween®80 as an edge activator that perturbs the packing characteristics of Span®60 and thus fluidizes the vesicular bilayers ( ). The development of a less-ordered lattice arrangement in case of the spanlastics formulae (F6 and F7) compared with the pure crystalline ingredients is evident from the changes in the positions of the melting points of Hal and Span®60 together with the lowering of the corresponding melting enthalpies. These results may indicate the possible dispersion of Hal in an amorphous state throughout the spanlastics ( ).
Ex vivo permeation
The observed lag times in drug solution and spanlastic formulae may be due to the strong binding of Hal to stratum corneum (SC) ( ) which delays the drug permeation. However, the superiority of spanlastic formulae in different permeation parameters may be due to the fact that drug entrapment inside the deformable spanlastics hides the drug from SC and that the surfactants used enhance the permeation of drug leading to a final Hal flux increase across the skin. This is of course in addition to the inherent nature of spanlastics which allows them to squeeze themselves through the skin.
Statistical analysis of the total amount permeated per unit area (Q), average flux values (J), and lag time data
Hal dissolved in propylene glycol (PG) had very low permeability through the skin samples despite of being dissolved in PG which is a permeation enhancer. This was to be predicted due to the strong barrier properties and low permeability of skin to different molecules ( ). Another factor that may have decreased the permeability of Hal from PG solution even much more is that Hal has known tendency to bind with SC ( ). Spanlastics are known for their ability to increase the transdermal permeability of molecules ( ). This is attributed to their flexible nature that allows them to squeeze themselves through pores of skin and their surfactant content which helps in decreasing the integrity of the hydrophobic SC barrier ( ). In the case of Hal, there is even one more reason which is shielding Hal from the binding sites of SC. Thus Q and J were significantly higher, and lag time was significantly shorter for both F6 and F7 compared with drug solution. F6 had significantly more entrapped Hal than F7 (95.4 ± 1.7 vs. 75.3 ± 9.9%, p < 0.05), while F7 had a significantly smaller PS than F6 (189.3 ± 3.3 vs. 240.9 ± 10.3nm, p < 0.05). The significantly higher Q 36h and J 36h of F7 from F6 may indicate that the smaller PS aided more than higher entrapment in achieving higher permeation (Fig. 5 ).
CONCLUSION
Haloperidol spanlastics were successfully prepared by ethanol injection method according to a 3 1 .4 1 full factorial design. The FT-IR studies showed that Hal maintained its characteristic peaks, thus confirming compatibility with the studied excipients. Analysis of the factorial design revealed that the studied factors had significant effects on all the measured responses except the deformability index. Based on the desirability criterion, two formulae (F6 and F7) were chosen for further investigation. The DSC thermograms showed shifts in endothermic peaks of Hal in spanlastic formulae with decline in their intensity meaning that Hal was successfully entrapped within the vesicles. The statistical analysis of the ex vivo permeation data showed superiority of the two spanlastic formulae compared with drug solution in permeation parameters. F6 and F7 were insignificantly different in all permeation parameters except for total amount permeated per unit area after 36h (Q 36 ) and average flux value during 36h ( J 36 ) where F7 was significantly higher than F6. This may indicate that the significantly smaller PS of F7 aided more than the significantly higher entrapment of F6 in achieving higher permeation. J 48 of F7 was 3.5 ± 0.2μg/cm 2 .h and this indicates that it is very promising for being used for transdermal therapy with Hal to overcome the common problems accompanying oral and intramuscular routes.
