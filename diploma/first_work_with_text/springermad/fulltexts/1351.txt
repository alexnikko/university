Introduction
The Onchoproteocephalidea Caira, Jensen, Waeschenbach, Olson and Littlewood, 2014 is one of the recent erected cestode orders (see Caira et al. ), the members of which parasitize freshwater fishes, frogs, snakes, lizards, and elasmobranchs (de Chambrier et al. ; Caira et al. ). Those species parasitizing the elasmobranchs, i.e. batoids and sharks, are known as the hook-bearing members of the order, the majority of which are intestinal helminths of batoids; however, 77 species, considering the known undescribed cestode species, live in intestines of sharks (Caira et al. ). This cestode group includes 11 genera, one of which is Phoreiobothrium Linton, 1889 containing 14 valid species (Caira et al. ), 12 of which, except for P . exceptum Linton, 1924 and P. pectinatum Linton, 1924, exhibit oioxenous specificity so that each one possesses its own single species of host (Caira et al. , ; Caira and Jensen ). In addition, several species of Phoreiobothrium have been considered species inquirenda (see also Caira et al. ; Caira and Jensen ).
Recently, Naylor et al. ( ), according to the phylogenies inferred from NADH2 gene, proved that many species of sharks and batoids are in fact species complexes, most of which cannot be easily distinguished from one another based on morphology. In addition to using molecular data, it seems that oioxenous specificity of cestodes for their hosts can also be helpful in accurate diagnosis of elasmobranchs. In this respect, Caira and Jensen ( ) used the tree species of Phoreiobothrium exhibiting oioxeny to distinguish the three types of sharks within the Rhizoprionodon acutus (Rüppell) species complex. They described P . nadiae Caira and Jensen , P . swaki Caira and Jensen , and P . jahki Caira and Jensen respectively from Rhizoprionodon cf. acutus 1 (sensu Naylor et al. ) off Senegal, R . cf. acutus 2 (sensu Naylor et al. ) off northern Australia, and R . cf. acutus 3 (sensu Naylor et al. ) off Borneo. Nonetheless, onchoproteocephalid cestodes of the fourth type of this species complex, i.e. R. acutus sensu stricto (sensu Naylor et al. ) extending around the Arabian Peninsula, are still unknown. Rhizoprionodon acutus sensu stricto is known as a dominant species in the Persian Gulf, northern Arabian Peninsula (Jabado et al. ). To complete the puzzle of the Phoreiobothrium faunas of the R. acutus species complex, a new species of this cestode genus is described from the fourth member of the milk shark species complex.
Carcharhinus macloti (Müller and Henle) is another carcharhinid shark, the data on cestode fauna of which is very rare. To date, only an onchoproteocephalid cestode Platybothrium sp. (without mention of sampling locality) and the trypanorhynch Otobothrium carcharidis (Shipley and Hornell, 1906) from the Gulf of Oman were reported from C. macloti (Healy ; Haseli , respectively). This shark species is probably a species complex because the specimens identified morphologically as C. macloti and used in the phylogeny of Naylor et al. ( ) were placed in three clades. One clade was composed of the specimens from India and the Gulf of Oman, another clade consisted of the specimens from Borneo, and the Australian specimens were placed in the third clade. Given the oioxeny of most of the species of Phoreiobothrium for their hosts, thereby examination of the Phoreiobothrium fauna of each clade of this shark species complex is helpful for future taxonomic works on C. macloti . In this respect, a new species of Phoreiobothrium is described from the specimens identified molecularly as C. macloti and registered in the Global Cestode Database.
Materials and methods
Under the project of stock assessment conducted by Iranian Fisheries Science Research Institute during November–December 2007, a total of 18 specimens of Rhizoprionodon acutus (13 males and 5 females; total length 52–77 cm) were collected on board the research vessel Ferdous I at a water depth of between 12 and 89 m in the Persian Gulf (26° 15′–27° 07′ N, 52° 53′–56° 28′ E). Furthermore, a total of five specimens of Carcharhinus macloti (4 males, 1 female; total length 71–85 cm) were collected by local fishermen from the Gulf of Oman, Iran in May 2009. The identification of these specimens was verified using NADH2 gene and registered in Global cestode Database as C. macloti (specimen numbers MM33–37) [ http://tapewormdb.uconn.edu/index.php/hosts/specimen_results/elasmobranch/ ].
The intestines of all the sharks from both samplings were removed, cut longitudinally from the ventral side, and placed into a plastic bag filled with 10% seawater-buffered formalin. Small pieces of muscle and liver of the specimens of C. macloti were sent, while kept in the small vials filled with 100% ethanol, to Professor Janine N. Caira (University of Connecticut) for molecular identification and later the sequences were used in the construction of the phylogeny of the carcharhinid sharks by Naylor et al. ( ). The cestodes were isolated using the stereomicroscope, stored in 70% ethanol, stained with acetic carmine, dehydrated in an ethanol series, cleared in methyl salicylate, and mounted on slides in Canada balsam. For line drawing of the newly discovered species, we used a drawing tube attached to an Olympus CH2 microscope.
To prepare specimens for scanning electron microscopy, some specimens earlier mounted were separated from the Canada balsam using xylene, washed in 100% ethanol, hydrated, stored in 1% osmium tetroxide for 20 h at 4 °C, dehydrated in an ethanol series, dried in hexamethyldisilazane, mounted on stubs, coated with gold using a K450X carbon coater (Quorum Technologies) to a thickness of 5 nm, and examined using a Vega 2 LM scanning electron microscope (Tescan Orsay Holding) at 15 kv.
An ocular micrometre was used for measurement reported through the text in micrometres. All measurements were presented as the range followed by the mean, standard deviation, the number of the measured worms ( N ), and the total number of measurements for each character ( n ) in parentheses. Hook terminology follows Caira ( ). ImageJ 1.46r (Wayne Rasband, NIH, USA) was used in measuring the microtriches. Chervy ( ) was followed for the terminology of the microtriches.
The type material was deposited in the Muséum d’Histoire Naturelle, Geneva, Switzerland (MHNG).

Remarks
Phoreiobothrium golchini n. sp. is differentiated from P. lasium Linton, 1889 and P . blissorum Caira, Richmond and Swanson, 2005 by the number of bothridial subloculi (11–15 vs 25–30 and 23–31, respectively) and the number of proglottids (24–39 vs 54–107 and 55–79, respectively). Whereas the basal prongs of the medial and lateral hooks are well developed and can be seen easily in the new species, the basal prongs of the medial and lateral hooks in P . exceptum , P . lewinense Caira, Richmond and Swanson, 2005, and P . puriensis Srivastav and Capoor, 1982 are extremely reduced. Phoreiobothrium golchini n. sp. with tri-pronged hooks is different from P . manieri Caira, Healy and Swanson, 1996 possessing the bi-pronged hooks. The approximately medial position of the genital pore in the new species distinguishes it from P . anticaporum Caira, Richmond and Swanson, 2005 in the proglottids of which the genital pore is extremely anterior. Unlike P. pectinatum in which the basal prong of the lateral hook is less than one-half length of the basal prong of the medial hook, the basal prongs of the lateral and medial hooks in P . golchini n. sp. are approximately the same in size. It is differentiated from P . perilocrocodilus Caira, Richmond and Swanson, 2005 by the number of bothridial subloculi (11–15 vs 15–18) and the number of testes (53–114 vs 36–49). In addition, this new species lacks the 4–5 small, muscular papillae on the anterior margin of muscular pad seen in P . perilocrocodilus . Unlike P. robertsoni Caira, Richmond and Swanson, 2005 and P. tiburonis Cheung, Nigrelli and Ruggieri, 1982 in which the gladiate spinitriches cover the proximal bothridial surface, this region in P . golchini n. sp. is adorned only with papilliform filitriches. The new species is distinguished from P . rozatii n. sp. by its possession of smaller hooks (e.g. B 32–43 vs 43–52, C 30–39 vs 38–53, D 30–48 vs 48–62). In addition, unlike P . rozatii n. sp. possessing the triangular bothridia, it possesses the rectangular bothridia. The new species differs from the congeners parasitizing the Rhizoprionodon acutus species complex as follows. P . golchini n. sp. possessing the oblong posterior loculus is distinguished from P . jahki in which the posterior loculus is obovoid. The new species is distinguished from P . nadiae by the number of subloculi (11–15 vs 18–28). In P . golchini n. sp., the proximal bothridial surface lacks, rather than possesses, gladiate spinitriches seen in P . swaki .
Caira et al. ( ) considered the five species off India, i.e. P . arabiansi Shinde, Jadhav and Mohekar, 1984, P . girjamami Shinde, Motinge and Pardeshi, 1993, P . ratnagiriensis Shinde and Jadhav , P . shindei Shinde, Jadhav and Jadhav, 1990, and P . vinodae Jadhav , to be species inquirenda since the descriptions and illustrations presented in each case are poor and disagree with one another, some described characters are not consistent with the genus, type material is unavailable and host identities are questionable and that the identities of all five species are dubious (see also Caira and Jensen ). Caira et al. ( ) noted that the identity of the host of all five species was suspect and that the authors were actually referring to Rhizoprionodon acutus . In this respect, Caira and Jensen ( ) again discussed the taxonomic status of these Indian species in relation to the fourth member of the Rhizoprionodon acutus species complex occurring, as suggested by Naylor et al. ( ), in the Indian Ocean.
Since there was no type material for each of these five species and given that the descriptions and illustrations were very poor, a comprehensive comparison of the Indian species and P . golchini n. sp. ex R. acutus sensu stricto (sensu Naylor et al. ) from the northwestern Indian Ocean was impossible. Nonetheless, regarding both the illustrations and descriptions, P . golchini n. sp. is dramatically different from P . girjamami , P . ratnagiriensis , and P . shindei for each of which a U-shaped ovary was ironically described (see Shinde et al. ; Shinde and Jadhav ; Shinde et al. ). In contrast to P . golchini n. sp. in which the vagina is anterior to the cirrus-sac, P . arabiansi possesses a vagina posterior to the cirrus-sac (see Shinde et al. ). Jadhav ( ) described P . vinodae such that its neck lacks any spines. It seems that he meant “the lack of microscopically visible microtriches on the cephalic peduncle”, a feature seen easily in the new species. Therefore, due to the inaccuracy as well as numerous mistakes and defects in the descriptions of the species of Phoreiobothrium from the Indian waters, P . golchini n. sp. completes the puzzle of the Phoreiobothrium faunas of the R. acutus species complex.

Remarks
The new species differs from P. tiburonis , P . swaki , and P. robertsoni in that it lacks, rather than possesses, gladiate spinitriches on proximal bothridial surface. The oblong posterior loculus in P . rozatii n. sp. distinguishes it from P . jahki in which the posterior loculus is obovoid. P . rozatii n. sp. differs from P . manieri n. sp. in that it possesses, rather than lacks, the basal prongs in its lateral and medial hooks. Whereas the basal prongs of the medial and lateral hooks are well developed and can be seen easily in P . rozatii n. sp., the basal prongs of the medial and lateral hooks in P . exceptum , P . lewinense , and P . puriensis are extremely reduced. Unlike P. pectinatum in which the basal prong of the lateral hook is less than one-half length of the basal prong of the medial hook, P . rozatii n. sp. possesses the basal prongs of the hooks which are approximately the same in size. Phoreiobothrium rozatii n. sp. is distinguished from P. lasium and P . blissorum by the number of bothridial subloculi (12–15 vs 25–30, 23–31, respectively) and the number of proglottids (21–36 vs 54–107 and 55–79, respectively). Whereas it possesses approximately the medially positioned genital pores in its proglottids, the genital pores are extremely anterior in the proglottids of P . anticaporum . P . rozatii n. sp. differs from P . perilocrocodilus in its possession of a greater number of testes (66–103 vs 36–49). In addition, it lacks the 4–5 small, muscular papillae on the anterior margin of muscular pad seen in P . perilocrocodilus . P . rozatii n. sp. possesses a fewer number of bothridial subloculi than does P . nadiae (12–15 vs 18–28). It differs from P . golchini n. sp. in its possession of larger hooks (e.g. B 43–52 vs 32–43, C 38–53 vs 30–39, D 48–62 vs 30–48). In addition, P . rozatii n. sp. has the triangular bothridia, whereas P . golchini n. sp. possesses the rectangular bothridia.
Discussion
Given the highly host specificity of the members of the genus Phoreiobothrium , this hypothesis can be expressed that the species of Phoreiobothrium may cospeciate with their host species. To examine this hypothesis, a cophylogeny between the shark species and their Phoreiobothrium faunas are in need. Although such a study has not yet been carried out, the divergence of the members of the milk shark species complex was shown in the phylogeny provided by Caira and Jensen ( ) from which it can be realized that the model of divergence is probably the allopatric speciation. If the hypothesis of cospeciation of the members of the milk shark species complex and their cestodes is considered, the Phoreiobothrium fauna of the fourth member of the milk shark species complex gives this opportunity to understand what characters can diverge quickly in a recent allopatric speciation. While most of the quantitative characters overlap, some differences are observed (Table 1 ), including the width of the scolex at level of hooks as well as the length of the bothridium, muscular pad, anterior loculus, and cirrus-sac. In addition, these four species show variation in the number of the subloculi as well as post–vaginal testes, the presence or absence of the mature proglottid, the morphology of the posterior loculus and the surface ultrastructure of the proximal bothridial surface (see Table 1 ). It seems that scolex can diverge more rapidly in size and morphology than strobila. Regardless of the measurements, the approximately homogenous proglottid anatomy in this genus can partly confirm this hypothesis so that except for P . anticaporum in which the genital pore is located in the extreme anterior portion of the proglottid, it is approximately medial. In all the species, the vagina extending anteriorly along the median line curves laterally along the anterior margin of the cirrus-sac and then opens into the genital pore. The morphology of the ovary and uterus, the distribution of the testes in one layer, and the acraspedote proglottid are also homogenous in Phoreiobothrium . In contrast, significant variation is seen in the scolex specifically in the morphology of the hooks and the number of the subloculi. For example, regarding the morphology of the hooks, the species of Phoreiobothrium can be categorized based on the status of the basal prong of the medial and lateral hooks, i.e. its presence, absence, conspicuousness, and inconspicuousness. In addition, the equality or inequality in the size of the basal prongs of the medial and lateral hooks is variable in the genus Phoreiobothrium .

Unlike two of 16 valid species within this genus, i.e. P . exceptum and P. pectinatum , co-occurring in a single host species, i.e. Sphyrna zygaena (Linnaeus) (see Caira et al. ), the oioxenous specificity of the newly described species is in accordance with most of the species of Phoreiobothrium . Of the 15 known host species for Phoreiobothrium , 10 host species belong to the Carcharhinidae and five are the members of the Sphyrnidae (Caira et al. ). According to Jabado et al. ( ), Jabado and Ebert ( ), and Henderson et al. ( ), the carcharhinid sharks occurring in both the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman include Carcharhinus amblyrhynchoides (Whitley), C. amblyrhynchos (Bleeker), C. amboinensis (Müller and Henle), C. brevipinna (Müller and Henle), C. dussumieri (Müller and Henle), C. falciformis (Müller and Henle), C . leiodon Garrick, C . cf. leucas 1 or 2 (sensu Naylor et al. ), C . cf. limbatus (Müller and Henle), C. macloti *, C . cf. melanopterus (Quoy and Gaimard), C. plumbeus (Nardo)*, C. sorrah (Müller and Henle), Galeocerdo cuvier (Péron and Lesueur), Loxodon cf. macrorhinus (Müller and Henle), Negaprion acutidens (Rüppell)*, Rhizoprionodon acutus *, R. oligolinx Springer, Scoliodon laticaudus Müller and Henle, and Triaenodon obesus (Rüppell). C. altimus (Springer), C. hemiodon (Müller and Henle), C. longimanus (Poey), and Prionace glauca (Linnaeus) occur only in the Gulf of Oman and C . humani White and Weigmann occurs only in the Persian Gulf. Regarding the Sphyrnidae, Sphyrna lewini 1 (sensu Naylor et al. )* and Sphyrna mokarran 1 (sensu Naylor et al. )* live in both water localities and Eusphyra blochii (Cuvier)* and Sphyrna zygaena * occur only in the Gulf of Oman. The species with asterisk are those from which the species of Phoreiobothrium were described. Except for the host species of the present study, information on Phoreiobothrium faunas of N. acutidens , C. plumbeus and all the sphyrnid species is available (see Caira et al. ). Hence, given the genera from which the oioxenous species of Phoreiobothrium were described, we estimate that at least 15 new species of Phoreiobothrium should occur in the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. At present, based on the unpublished and preliminary studies, C. sorrah and C. dussumieri each harbours an undescribed species of Phoreiobothrium from the region.
The surface ultrastructure of Phoreiobothrium was discussed by Caira et al. ( ). The microtriches of the three species described from the three species of the Rhizoprionodon acutus species complex (see Caira and Jensen ) as well as those of the Iranian congeners were congruent with the characteristics of the genus. Although 13 of 16 valid Phoreiobothrium species have the described microtriches (Caira et al. , ; Caira and Jensen ; present study), the generic diagnosis of Phoreiobothrium lacks any information on these characters. Hence the microtriches are added to the generic diagnosis based on the terminology presented by Chervy ( ) as follows: distal bothridial surface adorned either with papilliform or with acicular filitriches, proximal bothridial surface covered either with papilliform filitriches only or with gladiate spinitriches interspersed with papilliform, acicular or papilliform to acicular filitriches. Cephalic peduncle covered with gladiate spinitriches interspersed with papilliform, acicular or acicular to capilliform filitriches; strobila adorned with gladiate spinitriches interspersed with papilliform, acicular, capilliform or acicular to capilliform filitriches.
The described species did not add any specific character to the generic diagnosis of Phoreiobothrium amended recently by Caira et al. ( ). One of the characters used by Caira et al. ( ) as well as Caira and Jensen ( ) was the number of the columns of the testes anterior to the cirrus-sac. This character was also used in the couplet 10 to divide P. lasium from P . blissorum (with 7–8 vs 5–6 columns anterior to the cirrus-sac, respectively). Both P . golchini and P . rozatii were variable in this character and had 4–8 and 5–8 columns respectively. It seems that using such a character at least for identification keys needs cautiousness.
