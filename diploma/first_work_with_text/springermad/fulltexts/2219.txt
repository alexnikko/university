Introduction
The generation of new neurons continues during adulthood [ , ]. This process involves neural stem cells, which generate neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. Neurogenesis constitutively occurs in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and in the system formed by the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricles (SVZ) and the olfactory bulb [ , , ]. In both cases, neural stem cells reside in permissive neurogenic microenvironments [ , ]. Interestingly, the hippocampus has shown a pronounced vulnerability to conditions in which neurogenesis is affected, such as ischemia, epilepsy, acute and chronic stress, neurodegeneration, and aging [ , , , ]. Therefore, several investigators have sought to stimulate the neurogenic process in the hippocampus as preventive or regenerative strategies. These strategies include physical activity and an enriched environment as external effectors [ ], the use of neurogenic small molecules [ ], mesenchymal stem cell transplantation [ ], or the use of factors released from stem cells found in the secretome [ , ], which have shown interesting results.
Stem cells release growth and angiogenic factors, hormones, cytokines, chemokines, extracellular matrix proteins, extracellular matrix proteases, hormones, microvesicles, and exosomes; all of these elements have been detected in the conditioned medium (CM) during in vitro culture [ , ]. Soluble factors (SFs) contained in the CM have been obtained from different sources of mesenchymal stem cells (i.e., bone marrow, adipose tissue, dental pulp, and umbilical cord), whose therapeutic applications have highlighted neuroprotective-like effects on murine models of Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases, among others [ , , ].
Moreover, the olfactory epithelium, another neurogenic region that is also considered a source of neural progenitors [ , , , ], has attracted attention due to its ability to repair the central nervous system (CNS) [ , , ]. The olfactory epithelium is a heterogeneous tissue composed of horizontal basal cells (HBCs), globose basal cells (GBC), mature and immature olfactory sensory neurons, sustentacular cells, and Bowman’s glands/ducts. In addition, the axons of the olfactory sensory neurons project to the olfactory bulb, accompanied by olfactory ensheathing glia cells (OECs) [ , , , ]. The olfactory epithelium also contains mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that are mainly located in the lamina propria [ ], thus forming a complex scenario for the interpretation of results related to the neuronal replacement benefits of the olfactory epithelium-derived cells. Despite of this complexity, horizontal basal, globose basal, mesenchymal stem, and OECs produce neurons in vitro and in vivo, but may also release trophic factors that influence several events in the neurogenic process, including proliferation, survival, and differentiation [ , ]. In this regard, some studies have reported improvements in CNS function after therapy using stem cells obtained from the olfactory mucosa (i.e., the olfactory epithelium and lamina propria) [ , , ]. However, one interpretation of this benefit may also be that SFs produced by transplanted cells favor neuronal regeneration in the hippocampus [ ]. Interestingly, OECs-CM induce neuronal differentiation of neural stem cells [ , ], suggesting that the OECs may provide soluble factors that impact the generation of new neurons in the hippocampal dentate gyrus.
As shown in our recent studies, human neural stem/progenitor cells derived from the olfactory epithelium (hNS/PCs-OE) express several mRNAs that encode pluripotency-associated markers, such as Sox2, Oct4, Klf4, Nanog, and Lin28 [ , ]. In addition, hNS/PCs-OE increase their differentiation and neurogenic potential in response to pharmacologically induced epigenetic modifications [ ]. Moreover, hNS/PCs-OE respond to neurotrophins and growth factors [ , , , ]. However, to our knowledge, the identity and the capability of SFs contained in the secretome of hNS/PCs-OE to induce the differentiation of murine adult hippocampal precursor cells (AHPCs) is not known. We, thus, hypothesized that AHPCs are an excellent model for characterizing the soluble factors present in the secretome of hNP/PCs-OE that participate in inducing the differentiation of these cells.
Materials and Methods
Human Neural Stem/Progenitor Cells Derived from the Olfactory Epithelium
Human NS/PCs-OE were exfoliated from the anterior region of the medial lateral turbinate using a special brush and circular movements to obtain cells from the lateral wall of nasal cavity and septum, as described in our previous study [ ], with slight modifications[ , ]. The Ethical Committee of the National Institute of Psychiatry approved this study (CEI/C/084/2015-CEI/C/077/2016). Prior to nasal exfoliation, participants provided written informed consent for all procedures. The mini-international neuropsychiatric interview and Symptom Checklist-90-R were applied to evaluate signs of psychopathological antecedents in five participants. However, for the present study, we used hNS/PCs-OE from a 38-year-old participant. Those cells have been cloned and expressed pluripotency associated markers [ , ]. Cells were harvested in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium containing F-12 (DMEM/F-12) (Gibco, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA), 4 mM l -glutamine (Gibco, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA), 100 g/ml streptomycin, and 100 IU/ml penicillin (Gibco, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) and were dissociated mechanically. Dissociated cells were cultured in serum-supplemented DMEM/F-12. All experiments were performed on cells from passages 5 to 10.
For cell differentiation, hNS/PCs-OE were cultured in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% FBS for 48 h. Then, the serum-supplemented media were removed and cells were incubated in a serum-free medium supplemented with 1% ITS (Gibco, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA), 1% B27 (Gibco, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA), and 0.5% N2 (Gibco, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) in the presence of 1 μM all-trans retinoic acid (Sigma, Toluca, Mexico), 5 μM Forskolin (Tocris, Bristol, United Kingdom), and 15 nM Sonic hedgehog (PeproTech, Mexico City, Mexico) (Boone et al. 2010) for 7 days prior to performing immunocytochemistry for nestin, Ki67, βIII tubulin, GFAP, or MAP2; or performing Western blot analyses for nestin, Ki67, βIII tubulin, PSD-95, tau, MAP2, NeuN, and GFAP proteins.
Cytokine Antibody Array
Human NS/PCs-OE were seeded in 5 ml of proliferative medium (10% FBS—DMEM/F12) in a T-25 flask and cultured for 2 days. Then, cells were switched to a neurobasal medium (Gibco, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 2% B27 and growth factors (20 ng/ml human epidermal growth factor (EGF) and 20 ng/ml human fibroblast growth factor 2 (bFGF) (PeproTech, Mexico City, Mexico) for 48 h. CM was collected and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 8 h. Protein concentrations were quantified using a Pierce® BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA). Three milligrams of total protein were used for a RayBio Biotin Label-based Human Antibody Array (RayBiotech Inc., Norcross, GA, USA). The array was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Biotin-conjugated antibodies on each membrane served as positive controls. Images of the arrays were captured and analyzed using a ChemiDoc™ MP System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The array detects 507 secreted proteins. Experiments were performed in triplicate. Only the proteins detected in all three experiments are shown.
Murine Adult Hippocampal Precursor Cell Culture
Murine AHPCs were isolated from the hippocampus of adult C57Bl/6 mice and characterized as previously described [ , , ]. Brains were removed from the skull to isolate the dentate gyrus, which was then dissociated by enzymatic digestion. After separation on a Percoll gradient, precursor cells were plated on laminin-coated 96-well plates. Precursor cells were cultured with 20 ng/ml human EGF and 20 ng/ml human bFGF in a neurobasal medium supplemented with 2% B27. Once precursor cells reached 80% confluency, they were passaged and used in experiments.
For cell differentiation, AHPCs were cultured in neurobasal medium supplemented with 2% B27,20 ng/ml of human EGF, and 20 ng/ml of human bFGF. Forty-eight hours later, the growth factors were removed, and cells were incubated in neurobasal medium supplemented with 2% B27 for 7 days to perform immunocytochemistry for nestin, phospho-histone H3 (Ser10) (pH 3), GFAP, and MAP2; or to perform Western blot analysis for the expression of nestin, proliferaton cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), MAP2, and GFAP proteins, respectively.
Cell Viability (Wst-1 Assay)
Cells were cultured under proliferation conditions to test the effect of CM from hNS/PCs-OE on AHPC viability. Hippocampal precursor cells were cultured in media supplemented with 2% B27 plus growth factors (EGF and bFGF) for 2 days. Thus, AHPCs were cultured with different dilutions of CM from hNS/PCs-OE (5, 10, 15 20, 25, 50, and 100%) without B27 and growth factors for 24 and 48 h. In other experiments, AHPCs were cultured with different concentrations of a neutralizing anti-human EGF antibody (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and two dilutions of CM from hNS/PCs-OE (15 and 100%). One hour before the end of the experiments, the Wst-1 reagent (Roche, Hague Road, IN, USA) was added to the cultures. The metabolic activity was determined by measuring the formation of formazan. The formazan content was analyzed in four wells per dilution of CM from hNS/PCs-OE and repeated at least three times. Plates were read in an ELISA reader at a wavelength of 450 nm (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland).
Cell Proliferation (BrdU Incorporation Assay)
For proliferation studies, AHPCs were cultured under proliferation conditions for 2 days and then switched to medium without B27 and growth factors that contained different dilutions of CM from hNS/PCs-OE (15, 50, or 100%) and cultured for 24 and 48 h. In other experiments, AHPCs were cultured with a neutralizing anti-human EGF antibody plus two dilutions of CM from hNS/PCs-OE (15 and 100%). One hour before the end of the experiment, precursor cells were labeled with 20 μM BrdU to further quantify labeled (BrdU+/DAPI+) and non-labeled cells (BrdU-/DAPI+), the latter indicates the total number of cells per well. Images were captured using a Leica DMIRE2 microscope and analyzed with ImageJ software (NIH). Experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated at least three times.
Immunocytochemistry
For differentiation studies, AHPCs were cultured in medium that contained EGF and bFGF for 2 days. Then, AHPC were cultured in presence of different dilutions of CM from hNS/PCs-OE (15, 50, and 100%) without B27 and growth factors for 24 and 48 h. In other experiments, AHPCs were cultured with a neutralizing anti-human EGF antibody along with two dilutions of CM from hNS/PCs-OE (15 and 100%). The cellular phenotypes of differentiated AHPCs cells were analyzed after fixation with 4% formaldehyde and blocking with 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in 1× PBS, pH 7.4, supplemented with Triton 0.2%. Cultures were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. The primary antibodies were anti-GFAP (1:1000; Dako, Via Real, CA, USA), mouse anti-MAP2 (1:500; Sigma, Toluca, Mexico), mouse anti-proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA; 1:500; Millipore, Naucalpan, Mexico) or rabbit anti-phosphohistone 3 (pH 3; 1:500; Millipore) and mouse anti-nestin (1:500, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). On the next day, we added the corresponding Alexa Fluor® 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) secondary antibody (1:500, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) and Alexa Fluor® 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) secondary antibody (1:500, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA). Nuclei were stained with DAPI. Finally, coverslips were mounted using Fluorogel (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA, USA). Images were captured using a Leica TCS SP8 microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Precursor cells (nestin), proliferating cells (pH 3), astrocytes (GFAP), and neurons (MAP2) were identified separately. These phenotypes were quantified at least three times in duplicate.
Western Blot
One million AHPCs were seeded in each well of a six-well plate. After 48 h, cells were washed thrice with a neurobasal culture medium. Then, AHPCs were incubated with a neurobasal culture medium for 1 h. The respective treatments (untreated control, neurobasal culture medium +20 ng/ml EGF, neurobasal culture medium + 50 ng/ml NT-4, and 15, 50, and 100% CM) were applied at different times points (5, 15, 45, 90, and 180 min). Additional treatments were applied, including dilutions of the CM (15, 50, and 100%), neurobasal medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml EGF (positive control), and neurobasal medium supplemented with or without the anti-human EGF neutralizing antibody at the concentration recommended by the R&D Systems (0.1 μg/ml anti-human EGF per 2 ng/ml EGF), and incubated for 1 h. Treatments were added to the AHPCs and incubated for 5 min before protein lysates were obtained.
In additional experiments, some cells were incubated with 1 ml of neurobasal culture medium, 1 ml of neurobasal culture medium + inhibitors (PP1/PP2), or 1 ml of neurobasal culture medium + one of the two inhibitors (PP1 or PP2) for 1 h. After incubation, the respective treatments were applied (neurobasal culture medium, neurobasal culture medium + PP1/PP2, neurobasal culture medium + 20 ng/ml EGF, neurobasal culture medium + 20 ng/ml EGF + PP1, neurobasal culture medium + 20 ng/ml EGF + PP2, neurobasal culture medium + 20 ng/ml EGF + PP1/PP2; the same groups were treated with 100% CM). The inhibitor concentrations were 1 μM for PP1 and 0.1 μM for PP2, as previously reported [ , ]. Treatments were applied at 5 and 45 min.
Precursor cells were lysed with RIPA buffer (1× PBS, 0.1% SDS, 1% NP40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.24 mg/ml AEBSF, 8 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 mM benzamidine, 20 mM β-glycerophosphate, 10 mM NaF, 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 , 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM EGTA). The total protein content was quantified using a Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit®. Proteins were separated and transferred to a nitrocellulose paper. Proteins were identified with a rabbit anti-pTrkB antibody (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), a rabbit anti-TrkB antibody (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), a rabbit anti-pEGFR antibody (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), and a rabbit anti-EGFR antibody (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA). GAPDH was used as a loading control (1:1000; mouse anti-GAPDH antibody, Genetex). Proteins were visualized with the Millipore-enhanced chemiluminescence detection system in a ChemiDoc™ MP System. The densitometric analysis was performed with the Image Lab software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).
Antibody Array to Detect Intracellular Signaling
Hippocampal precursor cell extracts were prepared to analyze protein phosphorylation as an indicator of activation using the PathScan® Intracellular Signaling Antibody Array Kit (Chemiluminescent Readout; Cell Signaling Technologies, Danvers, Massachusetts, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Images of the arrays were captured and analyzed using the ChemiDoc™ MP System.
ELISA for IL-6 and EGF
EGF and IL-6 concentrations in the CM from hNS/PCs-OE were quantified using ELISA kits for EGF (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and IL-6 (PeproTech, Mexico City, Mexico) according to the manufacturers’ protocols. The 96-well plates were read in an ELISA reader (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland) at a wavelength of 450 nm.
Statistical Analysis
Results were analyzed using the GraphPad Prism 5 software (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). Data are presented as means ± SEM. Results were analyzed using one- or two-way ANOVA followed by the appropriate post hoc test. Differences were considered statistically significant at p ≤ 0.05.
Results
Characterization of Human Neural Stem/Progenitor Cells Derived from the Olfactory Epithelium
Human NS/PCs-OE cultured under proliferative conditions express proliferation (Ki67) and precursor stage (nestin; Fig. 1 a) markers. These cells also expressed βIII-tubulin, but they did not express markers of mature neurons and glial cells (Fig. 1 b, c). Moreover, hNS/PCs-OE showed the capability to differentiate into mature neurons after being cultured in the presence of a cocktail containing retinoic acid, forskolin, and Sonic hedgehog (rafnshh) (Fig. 1 d–f). Based on the protein levels, hNS/PCs-OE cultured in the presence of growth factors expressed Ki67, nestin, and βIII-tubulin, indicating their neural lineage restriction and their capability to proliferate (Fig. 1 g, h). Moreover, after a differentiation was induced with rafnshh for 7 days, Ki67 expression was lost and we observed a significant reduction in the levels of the nestin and βIII-tubulin proteins (Fig. 1 g). In addition, hNS/PCs-OE also showed significantly increased levels of MAP2c, a marker related to neuritogenesis, after differentiation [ , ]. Interestingly, a similar increase in the level of tau, a microtubule associated protein, was also observed (Fig. 1 g, h), confirming the potential of hNS/PCs-OE to form mature neurons. Moreover, hNS/PCs-OE cultured under proliferation or differentiation (rafnshh for 7 days) conditions showed similar levels of a synapse-related protein (PSD-95) (Fig. 1 g, h).

Soluble Factors Released by Human Neural Stem/Progenitor Cells Derived from the Olfactory Epithelium
We identified some of the soluble factors released by hNS/PCs-OE cultured under proliferation conditions for 2 days using a proteomic array approach to obtain insights into the identities of these factors (Fig. 2 ). This array allowed the identification of proteins involved in different cellular events, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, death, and viability, among others. Arrays were hybridized with a culture medium supplemented with B27 or B27 plus EGF that were not exposed to the hNS/PCs-OEor were hybridized with the CM from hNS/PCs-OE (Fig. 2 a). Proteins detected in the arrays were grouped according to their abundance, ranging from the most to the least abundant proteins according to the densitometric values (Fig. 2 b) or according to their cellular function (Fig. 2 c). As shown in the array images, a considerable proportion of proteins detected corresponded to proteins involved in migration (21%), differentiation (29%), proliferation (13%), and neurite outgrowth (3%). We also detected some proteins that were involved in migration and differentiation (5%), proliferation and differentiation (5%), or proliferation and survival (3%), and very low levels of apoptosis-related proteins (3%) were detected. Interestingly, half of the ten most abundant proteins were cytokines (IL-8, GRO, MIP2, MCP-1, and IL-6; Fig. 2 b; Table 1 ), but their functions in cells belonging to the neural lineage have not yet been completely elucidated. However, interleukin-6 (IL-6) promotes astrocyte formation [ , ]. Surprisingly, after 48 h of hNS/PCs-OE culture, a positive signal for epidermal growth factor (EGF) was observed. This growth factor favors AHPC proliferation and is involved in maintaining the precursor lineage in cells of murine origin, and some studies have reported its effect on the formation of astrocytes [ ]. Fig. 2 Soluble factors in the conditioned medium of hNS/PCs-OE. a Representative images of array membranes hybridized with non-conditioned (left) or conditioned medium (right) are shown. In both cases, the positive (C +) or negative (C-) controls are shown. b Graphs show the proteins secreted by hNS/PCs-OE in the order of high to low abundance. c Classification of secreted proteins according to their cellular function in stem cells Table 1 Relative expression levels of soluble factors detected in cytokine antibody arrays. The values were normalized with respect to the average of the positive controls contained in the antibody-array.

Soluble Factors from hNSPCs-OE Maintain the Viability of Murine AHPCs
Once we identified some of the soluble factors released by the hNS/PCs-OE, we then tested the effect of CM from hNS/PCs-OE on the self-renewal capability of murine adult hippocampal precursor cells and on their potential to generate neuronal or glial cells [ , ]. Interestingly , transplanted cells have been hypothesized to provide soluble regulators that favor the neurogenic process in the hippocampus [ ]. Murine AHPCs cultured under proliferative conditions express proliferation (PCNA or pH 3) and precursor stage (nestin; Fig. 3 a–d) markers. Moreover, AHPCs showed the capability to differentiate into astrocytes and neurons (Fig. 3 e–g). Based on the protein levels, AHPCs cultured in the presence of growth factors expressed nestin and PCNA, indicating their neural lineage restriction and their capability to proliferate (Fig. 3 e, f). Moreover, after growth factor withdrawal, nestin and PCNA expression were lost (Fig. 3 e, f). In addition, AHPCs showed slightly significant increased levels of MAP2 and GFAP (Fig. 3 e–g). Moreover, differentiated precursor cells confirmed the potential of AHPCs to form mature neurons and astrocytes (Fig. 3 e–g). Thus, we analyzed whether the addition of soluble factors contained in the CM from hNS/PCs-OE affected the viability of AHPCs (Fig. 4 ). A 24-h treatment with CM from hNS/PCs-OE did not produce a significant difference in the viability of AHPCs compared to the growth factor control group (20 ng EGF + 20 ng bFGF); in contrast, the former group showed a significant increase in viability (30, 41, 42, 43, 44, and 17%) compared to cells cultured without growth factors (cells without growth factors vs cells cultured with 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, and 100% CM; p < 0.001; p < 0.05%, respectively; Fig. 4 a, b). Interestingly, 100% CM from hNS/PCs-OE did not show a greater effect on AHPC viability than lower percentages of CM from hNS/PCs-OE (≤ 50%). Moreover, according to the results of an analysis performed after 48 h (Fig. 4 a, b), some concentrations of CM from hNS/PCs-OE (20, 25, 50, and 100%) maintained the viability of AHPCs at a significantly higher level than cells cultured without growth factors (17, 18, 28, and 16%, respectively, p < 0.001), but this treatment did not reach the percentage observed in AHPCs cultured with growth factors. Importantly, at both time points (24 and 48 h), AHPCs treated with most concentrations of CM from hNS/PCs-OE showed increased viability compared to the control group cultured without growth factors. Thus, the CM from hNS/PCs-OE maintains the viability of AHPCs to a similar extent as growth factors at 24 h, and at a later time point, CM from hNS/PCs-OE promotes AHPC viability compared with cells cultured without growth factors.

Soluble Factors from hNS/PCs-OE Maintain the Proliferative Capability of Murine AHPCs
We further assessed the effect of CM from hNS/PCs-OE on BrdU incorporation, an indicator of cell proliferation, in AHPCs treated with three concentrations of CM (15, 50, and 100%; Fig. 5 ). An analysis of BrdU incorporation showed a decrease proportion of proliferating cells after 24 or 48 h compared with cells cultured with growth factors (24 h: 20 ng EGF + 20 ng bFGF vs 15, 50 and 100% CM, 34, 34, and 33% decreases, respectively, p < 0.001; 48 h: 20 ng EGF + 20 ng bFGF vs 15, 50 and 100% CM, 32%, 34, and 32% decreases, respectively, p < 0.001; Fig. 5 a, b). However, higher levels of cell proliferation induced by CM from hNS/PCs-OE were observed in AHPCs after 24 h compared with cells cultured without growth factors (15, 50, and 100% CM vs cells cultured without growth factors, 14, 14, and 15% increase, respectively, p < 0.001; Fig. 5 a, b). Similar effects, but to a lesser extent, were observed after 48 h of culture (15, 50, and 100% CM vs cells cultured without growth factors, 7, 5, and 7% increase, respectively, p < 0.001; Fig. 5 a, b). Based on these results, SFs from hNS/PCs-OE maintain AHPC proliferation.

Different Effects of Soluble Factors from hNS/PCs-OE on the Differentiation of Murine AHPCs
We cultured AHPCs in presence of three concentrations of CM (15, 50, and 100%) for 48 h to evaluate the effects of CM from hNS/PCs-OE on the expression of markers of precursor or mature cells (Fig. 6 ). An analysis of each phenotype revealed that less than 5% of the cells treated with 15% CM from hNS/PCs-OE showed the precursor phenotype, as identified by nestin expression, whereas the treatment with 50 and 100% CM from hNS/PCs-OE increased the percentages of cells with this phenotype by approximately 26 and 50%, respectively, compared to AHPCs cultured without growth factors (7%) ( p < 0.001; Fig. 6 b). Interestingly, AHPCs cultured with 100% CM from hNS/PCs-OE showed similar proportion of nestin-positive cells (58%) as cells cultured with growth factors (71%), but the difference was significant ( p < 0.001; Fig. 6 b). However, AHPCs treated with the three concentrations of CM from hNS/PCs-OE (15, 50, and 100%) only showed a very low proportion of mitotic cells identified by pH 3 staining (15% CM and 50% CM (1%) and 100% CM (2%)) compared to 5% of the precursor cells in the control group treated with growth factors undergoing mitosis ( p < 0.01; Fig. 6 a, b). The analysis of the neuronal lineage showed an increase proportion of MAP2-positive cells following treatment with both concentrations of CM from hNS/PCs-OE (15 and 100%; 7 and 5%, respectively) compared to cells treated without growth factors (1%), but the difference was not statistically significant (Fig. 6 a, b). However, the analysis of the glial lineage revealed that treatment with 100% CM from hNS/PCs-OE-CM produced a significant increase ( p < 0.001) in the proportion of GFAP-positive cells (22%) compared to the growth factor control group (0%) and cells cultured without growth factors (8%) (Fig. 6 a, b). Thus, the highest concentration of CM from hNS/PCs-OE promotes different cell phenotypes, such as nestin-expressing precursor cells or GFAP-expressing glial cells, after 48 h of treatment.

Soluble Factors from hNS/PCs-OE Increase Erk1/2 Phosphorylation in Murine AHPCs
We analyzed the intracellular signaling pathways associated with survival, cell proliferation, cell death, and stress to obtain insights into the mechanism underlying the effects of SFs from hNS/PCs-OE on AHPCs (Fig. 7 ). The densitometry analysis showed significantly increased signals for five phosphorylated proteins in AHPCs treated with CM from hNS/PCs-OE (Erk1/2 (Thr 202/Tyr 204), Stat3 (Tyr 105), Akt/PKB (Thr 308/Ser 473), PRAS40 (Thr 246), and GSK3β (Ser 9)) compared with cells cultured with growth factors for 5 min (20 ng EGF + 20 ng bFGF vs 15% CM (PRAS40, 13.23%, p < 0.001; GSK3β, 30.34%, p < 0.001); 20 ng EGF + 20 ng bFGF vs 50% CM (Erk1/2, 15.67%, p < 0.05; Akt (Thr 308), 32.61%, p < 0.01; Akt (Ser 473), 24.24%, p < 0.05; PRAS40, 13.05%, p < 0.001; GSK3β, 44.63%, p < 0.001); and 20 ng EGF + 20 ng bFGF vs 100% CM (Stat 3, 387.43%, p < 0.001; GSK3β, 35.84%, p < 0.001; Fig. 7 a, b)). AHPCs treated with SFs from hNS/PCs-OE for 48 h only showed increased phosphorylation of three proteins (Stat3 (Tyr 105), PRAS40 (Thr 246), and GSK3β (Ser 9)) compared to cells cultured with growth factors (20 ng EGF + 20 ng bFGF vs 15% CM (PRAS40, 20.81%, p < 0.001; GSK3β, 29.72%, p < 0.001), 20 ng EGF + 20 ng bFGF vs 50% CM (PRAS40, 21.2%, p < 0.001; GSK3β, 23.96%, p < 0.001), and 20 ng EGF + 20 ng bFGF vs 100% CM (Stat 3, 125.79%, p < 0.01; PRAS40, 61.84%, p < 0.001; GSK3β, 29.51%, p < 0.001)) (Fig. 6 c, d). Based on these results, two major signaling pathways related to cell proliferation and survival in AHPCs are activated by SFs from hNS/PCs-OE.

Interleukin-6 and Epidermal Growth Factor in the CM from hNS/PCs-OE Are Candidates to Explain the Effects on Murine AHPCs
According to the analysis of SFs from hNS/PCs-OE (Fig. 2 ; Table 1 ), several molecules, including IL-6, might explain the changes observed in AHPCs. First, we determined the concentrations of IL-6 and EGF in the CM from hNS/PCs-OE. Based on the ELISA results, the CM from hNS/PCs-OE contained 11 ng/ml IL-6 and 13.6 ng/ml EGF, the latter was residual EGF used to induce proliferation. We thus tested the effects of IL-6 (11 ng/ml) and EGF (13.6 ng/ml) on the proliferation and differentiation of AHPCs. As shown in Fig. 8 , EGF promoted the expression of the precursor phenotype (nestin) to the same extent as the proliferation control group (20 ng EGF + 20 ng bFGF vs EGF). However, IL-6 mainly induced astrocyte differentiation (GFAP) compared with the proliferation control group (20 ng EGF + 20 ng bFGF vs IL-6, 31,935% increase, p < 0.001); these effects were similar to treatment with 100% CM from hNS/PCs-OE (nestin: 20 ng EGF + 20 ng bFGF vs 100% CM, 14% decrease, p < 0.001; GFAP: 20 ng EGF + 20 ng bFGF vs 100% CM, 15,247% increase, p < 0.01; Fig. 8 a, b). Interestingly, AHPCs treated with the combination of EGF + IL-6 showed the precursor phenotype (Fig. 8 b), but IL-6-induced astrocyte differentiation was prevented by the addition of EGF (Fig. 8 b). Thus, EGF and IL-6 control the proliferation and glial differentiation of murine AHPCs, respectively, and EGF has a very interesting role in maintaining hippocampal precursor cells, as previously reported [ ]. Fig. 8 Effects of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) on the differentiation of human NS/PCs-OE. a Micrographs of cells subjected to different treatments, including controls (left to right; hippocampal precursor cells cultured with 20 ng EGF + 20 ng bFGF (proliferation control), without growth factors, with EGF 13.6 ng/ml, IL-6 11 ng/ml, EGF/IL-6, and 100% CM).

EGF Is Important for the Viability, Proliferation, and Maintaining the Precursor Stage, but Not for Inducing Murine AHPCs to Differentiate into Astrocytes
Because EGF maintains the proliferative and precursor phenotype of AHPCs [ ], we thus confirmed its effects using a neutralizing anti-human EGF antibody (anti-hEGF) (Fig. 9 ). First, we evaluated cell viability (Fig. 9 a) after 24 or 48 h of treatment. AHPCs treated with growth factors (20 ng EGF + 20 ng bFGF) or with 15% CM from hNS/PCs-OE plus the neutralizing anti-human EGF antibody showed decrease viability compared with the groups that were not incubated with the neutralizing antibody (20 ng EGF + 20 ng bFGF vs 20 ng EGF + 20 ng bFGF + anti-hEGF, 19%, p < 0.01; 15% CM vs 15% CM + anti-hEGF, 26%, p < 0.001). However, AHPCs cultured with 100% CM from hNS/PCs-OE in the presence or absence of the neutralizing antibody did not show differences in cell viability after 24 h of treatment (100% CM vs 100% CM + anti-hEGF, 10% increase, p > 0.05). Interestingly, at 48 h, the positive effect of CM from hNS/PCs-OE was not blocked by the neutralizing antibody, in contrast to AHPCs treated with both growth factors in the presence of the neutralizing antibody (20 ng EGF + 20 ng bFGF vs 20 ng EGF + 20 ng bFGF + anti-hEGF, 66% decrease, p < 0.001; 15% CM vs 15% CM + anti-hEGF, 4% increase, p > 0.05 and 100% CM vs 100% CM + anti-hEGF, 5% increase, p > 0.05). Fig. 9 Effects of a neutralizing anti-human epidermal growth factor antibody (anti-hEGF) on cell viability and proliferation. a Representative micrographs showing the effects of 15% CM, 15% CM + anti-hEGF, 100% CM, and 100% CM + anti-hEGF on the viability of the adult hippocampal neural precursor cells 24 and 48 h after treatment. The graphs depict the results of the cell viability assay (WST-1) 24 and 48 h after treatment. b Representative micrographs showing the effects of15% CM, 15% CM + anti-hEGF, 100% CM, and 100% CM + anti-hEGF on the proliferation (BrdU incorporation) of adult hippocampal neural precursor cells 24 and 48 h after treatment. The graphs depict the results of the proliferation assay (BrdU incorporation) 24 and 48 h after treatment. The results were analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s post hoc test. Hippocampal precursor cells cultured with 20 ng EGF + 20 ng bFGF were compared with cells cultured with 20 ng EGF + 20 ng bFGF + anti-hEGF, cells cultured with 15% CM were compared with cells cultured with 15% CM + anti-hEGF and cells cultured with 100% CM were compared with cells cultured with 100% CM + anti-hEGF. For the cell viability assay performed at 24 h, F 14, 44 = 8.955; p < 0.0001; for the assay performed at 48 h, F 14, 44 = 144; p < 0.0001. For the BrdU incorporation assay performed at 24 h, F 6, 20 = 137.4; p < 0.0001; for the assay performed at 48 h, F 6, 20 = 1161; p < 0.0001. ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001. Scale bars represent 100 μm
Moreover, the BrdU incorporation assay confirmed that EGF participated in the pro-proliferative effects of the CM from hNS/PCs-OE on AHPCs observed after 24 h (20 ng EGF + 20 ng bFGF vs 20 ng EGF + 20 ng bFGF + anti-hEGF, 29% decrease, p < 0.001; 15% CM vs 15% CM + anti-hEGF, 8% decrease, p < 0.001 and 100% CM vs 100% CM + anti-hEGF, 13% decrease, p < 0.001; Fig. 9 b). Although this effect was reduced in AHPCs cultured for 48 h (20 ng EGF + 20 ng bFGF vs 20 ng EGF + 20 ng bFGF + anti-hEGF, 43% decrease, p < 0.001; 15% CM vs 15% CM + anti-hEGF, 6% decrease, p < 0.001 and 100% CM vs 100% CM + anti-hEGF, 9% decrease, p < 0.001), the results are consistent with the decrease in the proportions of precursor and proliferating cells, as measured by the expression of the nestin and pH 3 proteins, respectively (nestin: 100% CM vs 100% CM + anti-hEGF, 38%, p < 0.001; pH 3: 100% CM vs 100% CM + anti-hEGF, 1%, p < 0.01; Fig. 10 a). In addition, we observed decrease neuronal differentiation (MAP2: 100% CM vs 100% CM + anti-hEGF, 3%, p < 0.05%), but increased astrocyte differentiation (GFAP: 100% CM vs 100% CM + anti-hEGF, 15%, p < 0.01%) in AHPCs cultured in the presence of the neutralizing anti-human EGF antibody together with the CM from hNS/PCs-OE (100%; Fig. 10 b). Based on these results, EGF controls the proliferative capacity and precursor stage of AHPCs, whereas another factor, such as IL-6, promotes astrocyte differentiation (Fig. 8 ).

Transactivation of TrkB Initiated by the EGF Receptor Is Involved in the Effects of EGF on Murine AHPCs
The SFs from hNS/PCs-OE and EGF produced effects on AHPCs consistent with the recent proposal that transactivation of growth factor or neurotrophin receptors might be involved in the signaling pathways that control the neurogenic process [ ]; one of these receptors is the TrkB receptor that transduces signals from BDNF and NT4 [ , ]. Therefore, we explored whether SFs from hNS/PCs-OE increase the phosphorylation of EGF and BDNF receptors (EGFR and TrkB, respectively; Fig. 11 ). Interestingly, NT4, but not BDNF, was identified in the CM from hNS/PCs using the antibody microarrays (Fig. 2 ). According to the analysis of the phosphorylation time course, SFs from hNS/PCs-OE increased EGFR and TrkB phosphorylation, and the maximal phosphorylation value was observed after 15 min (Fig. 11 a, b). Similar effects were observed in murine AHPCs treated with EGF, but not with NT4 (Fig. 11 a, b). Then, we analyzed whether EGF was responsible for TrkB phosphorylation in AHPCs (Fig. 11 c). Surprisingly, both EGFR and TrkB phosphorylation caused by SFs from hNS/PCs-OE or EGF were prevented by the neutralizing anti-hEGF antibody (pEGFR/EGFR: EGF vs EGF + anti-hEGF, 63.53% decrease, p < 0.001; 15% CM vs 15% CM + anti-hEGF, 57.41% decrease, p < 0.01; 50% CM vs 50% CM + anti-hEGF, 43.15% decrease, p < 0.05 and 100% CM vs 100% CM + anti-hEGF, 63.17% decrease, p < 0.01; pTrkB/TrkB: EGF vs EGF + anti-hEGF, 88.72% decrease, p < 0.001; 15% CM vs 15% CM + anti-hEGF, 76.77% decrease, p < 0.01; 50% CM vs 50% CM + anti-hEGF, 89.44% decrease, p < 0.001 and 100% CM vs 100% CM + anti-hEGF, 88.18% decrease, p < 0.001; Fig. 11 d). Finally, we explored the participation of Src proteins in EGFR-mediated TrkB transactivation in murine AHPCs (Fig. 11 e–h). According to the results of the EGFR and TrkB phosphorylation analysis, AHPCs treated with the PP2 Src inhibitor for 45 min exhibited decreased TrkB phosphorylation (pTrkB/TrkB: 100% CM vs 100% CM + PP2, 56.09% decrease, p < 0.05), an effect that was not observed after a short-term treatment (5 min) (pTrkB/TrkB: 100% CM vs 100% CM + PP2, non-significant difference). Thus, the Src protein acts downstream of EGFR to induce TrkB transactivation in murine AHPCs. Fig. 11 TrkB is transactivated by epidermal growth-factor receptor (EGFR) signaling in adult hippocampal neural precursor cells stimulated with conditioned medium. a Activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) in response to different dilutions of conditioned medium (15, 50, and 100% CM) at different time points. b The graphs depict the results of EGFR and TrkB activation in cells treated with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and conditioned medium, but not with NT-4. c Inactivation of TrkB and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) with a neutralizing antibody (anti-hEGF) in cells incubated with the conditioned medium and the control medium supplemented with EGF. d The graphs depict cells exposed to the different treatments for 5 min.

Discussion
In this work, human neural stem / progenitor cells derived from the olfactory epithelium release soluble factors that affect the phenotype and fate decision of murine adult hippocampal neural precursor cells in vitro. The mechanism underlying the effects of SFs of hNS/PCs-OE included proteins involved in cell proliferation (Erk1/2) and survival (Akt). Among the SFs from hNS/PCs-OE, IL-6 was a candidate that induced AHPCs to differentiate into astrocytes. However, we also tested the effects of EGF as a modulator of the precursor phenotype of AHPCs and showed that it may involve the transactivation of the TrkB receptor.
The olfactory epithelium is a heterogeneous tissue [ , , , , ]. Interestingly, it has been reported several benefits of stem cells obtained from the olfactory mucosa [ , , ]. However, the benefits reported may also be that the effects of SFs produced and released by transplanted cells positively impact neuronal regeneration in the hippocampus [ ]. The hippocampal dentate gyrus is a region in which new neurons are generated [ ]. New neurons are involved in several cognitive functions that are affected in several conditions such as ischemia, epilepsy, acute and chronic stress, neurodegeneration, and aging, among others [ , , , ]. Thus, cell transplantation or the use of stem cell-related SFs might be an option to modulate endogenous neurogenesis [ , ]. In this sense, the olfactory epithelium is considered as a source of neural progenitors for autologous transplantation [ , , , ] and has attracted attention for its ability to induce neuronal regeneration [ , , , ]. However, from our perspective, the capability of these cells to produce and release factors that may impact hippocampal neurogenesis must be revealed, which we explored in controlled in vitro cultures in this study.
Human NS/PCs-OE express nestin and βIII-tubulin proteins, indicating their neural lineage; however, they also express several mRNAs that encode pluripotency-associated markers, such as Sox2, Oct4, Klf4, Nanog, and Lin28, and respond to neurotrophins and growth factors [ , , , , ]. Here, hNS/PCs-OE showed the capability to differentiate into neurons. We observed a concomitant decrease in the levels of Ki67, nestin, and βIII-tubulin along with increased levels of MAP2c and tau proteins, but changes in the PSD95 level were not observed. Interestingly, human olfactory neuronal precursors were recently shown to differentiate into neurons after a 6-h treatment with melatonin. However, the differentiation of those cells was analyzed by monitoring the tau protein as an indicator of axon formation, but neuronal differentiation and cell cycle exit were not confirmed to ensure that 6 h was sufficient to induce the neuronal differentiation of olfactory neuronal precursor cells [ ]. The latter is important because the doubling time of these cells is approximately 21–38 h [ , ]. In addition, tau is also expressed in neural stem cells and increased levels are observed after differentiation induction [ ], suggesting that this marker is not appropriate for analyzing the terminal differentiation of olfactory neuronal precursor cells. Independent of these differences, our study adds information related to the expression of protein markers of proliferation and differentiation that are more relevant for a better characterization of hNS/PCs-OE.
Moreover, hNS/PCs-OE release SFs that have been reported in other types of stem cells, mesenchymal cells [ , ], astrocytes [ ], and even in cells obtained from the olfactory epithelium and more abundantly from the basal strata [ ]. The differences observed between the profiles of hNS/PCs-OE and other cells are largely due to several factors, including the detection method (antibody-preloaded experiments versus mass spectrometry), sampling method, time of collection (24, 48, and 72 h), and the type and origin of the cells. The proteins expressed in several cell types and in hNS/PCs-OE cultured in the presence of conventional mitogens (EGF and bFGF) include TIMP-1, TIMP-2, IL-8, nidogen, MMP2, IGFBP2, and MCP-1. The functions modulated by these proteinsinclude the proliferation, migration, and differentiation of several types of stem cells [ , , , , , , , ]. However, the SFs from hNS/PCs-OE also contained IL-6, NT4, and VEGF. VEGF has recently been shown to induce migration, without modifying the proliferation and viability of hNS/PCs-OE [ ], and together with the identification of VEGF in the present study, these findings suggest that this factor may also act as a paracrine signal in hNS/PCs-OE.
Here, SFs from hNS/PCs-OE maintained the precursor stage and the proliferative capability and viability of murine AHPCs to a lesser extent than the combination of EGF plus bFGF [ ]. Interestingly, some cells showed expression of neuronal (MAP2) or astrocyte (GFAP) markers after AHPCs were incubated with SFs from hNS/PCs-OE, effects that were concentration-dependent and greater than the effects observed on cells cultured without growth factors [ ]. The effects of SFs from hNS/PCs-OE on AHPCs suggest the involvement of several signaling pathways that control the proliferation, survival, and differentiation neural precursor cells [ , , , , , , , , , , , ]. Among these proteins, Erk1/2, Akt, and GSK3β are associated with the proliferation and maintenance of the precursor phenotype of AHPCs [ , , , ]. Moreover, the activated signaling pathways included the Akt/mTor/PRAS40 pathway that promotes cell growth [ , ]. Interestingly, the astrocytic fate of AHPCs may be explained by the activation of the STAT3 protein that is involved in the differentiation of neural precursor cells into astrocytes [ , ]. However, STAT3 levels were not determined in the present study.
Moreover, an analysis of SFs from hNS/PCs-OE suggested that IL-6 might be one of the candidates with the potential to induce astrocyte differentiation, as previously reported [ ]. Although IL-6 is not a unique factor associated with astrocyte differentiation, this cytokine was the first candidate tested in this study to explain the effect of the CM from hNS/PCs-OE on the differentiation of AHPCs into astrocytes. IL-6 is expressed in the CNS and triggers several responses, including inflammation and the generation of new neurons or astrocytes [ ]. Specifically, IL-6 is involved in the neuronal differentiation of rat neural progenitor cells from the adult rat hippocampus [ ], evidence that inconsistent with our findings. Here, IL-6 generated astrocytes from AHPCs to a similar extent as the CM from hNS/PCs-OE. Thus, IL-6 is a mediator present in the SFs from hNS/PCs-OE that induces the astrocytic fate decision of AHPCs. The generation of astrocytes in the hippocampus is important, because these cells not only act as cellular components of the microenvironment but also provide nutrients, growth factors, and lactate to the neurons [ , ]. Astrocytes also induce the generation of new neurons in the hippocampus [ , , ]. However, the effects of SFs from hNS/PCs-OE on the precursor stage and proliferative capacity of AHPCs cannot be explained by IL-6. Surprisingly, EGF was present in the CM from hNS/PCs-OE; thus, EGF was identified by the antibody array approach and confirmed by ELISA. However, the source of this factor was not the hNS/PCs-OE and its presence likely corresponded to residual EGF used to induce the proliferation of hNS/PCs-OE. EGF stimulates the proliferation of mouse hippocampal precursor cells and maintains the precursor phenotype [ , ], an effect that was also observed in the present study. The role of EGF in maintaining the precursor stage and proliferative capability without affecting the differentiation of AHPCs was prevented by the neutralizing antibody used in our study. We did not collect CM from hNS/PCs-OE cultured without the conventional combination of EGF/bFGF, because that this strategy induces lower production and, consequently, lower concentrations of SFs released from precursor cells [ ].
Notably, the important effects of each of the SFs identified in hNS/PCs-OE using the proteomic approach on AHPCs should be assessed in a complex screening study. However, we decided to explore the mechanism by which EGF controls the proliferation and the precursor stage of AHPCs, which could explain the effects of the CM from hNS/PCs-OE. EGF transactivation of TrkB receptor in murine cortical precursor cells has recently been linked to migration [ ]. In addition, transactivation of TrkB by other receptors, such as the sigma-1 receptor, plays a significant role in regulating dendritic spine density and morphology in hippocampal and cortical neurons [ ]. Similarly, estradiol-mediated transactivation of synaptic TrkB modulates the spine cytoskeleton, enhancing synaptic responses in the adult hippocampus [ ]. Here, we observed the phosphorylation of both EGFR and TrkB by EGF and SFs from hNS/PCs-OE, an effect that was not observed with NT4, which, in addition to BDNF, is a TrkB ligand. Very low levels of NT4 were identified using the proteomic approach. This neurotrophin promotes cell survival and induces neuronal differentiation [ ]; however, it cannot explain the effects of the CM from hNS/PCs-OE. Thus, the mechanism by which TrkB receptor is activated in AHPCs might be mediated by EGF induced-transactivation, as previously reported [ , ]. In our model, TrkB is transactivated by EGFR. Interestingly, the mechanism of transactivation between these two receptors involves Src kinase following EGFR activation. These kinases phosphorylate TrkB domains, an event that is inhibited by two inhibitors of Src, PP1 and PP2 [ , ]. Here, Src inhibition by PP2 required a longer time to decrease TrkB phosphorylation caused by EGF or the CM from hNS/PCs-OE in AHPCs. However, EGFR phosphorylation was not affected by the Src inhibitor, suggesting that the EGF-induced, Src-mediated transactivation of TrkB is involved in the effects of EGF and SFs from hNS/PCs-OE on AHPCs. Similarly, the activation of both EGFR and TrkB is required to maintain the precursor phenotype, proliferation, and survival of adult hippocampal precursor cells [ , , ]. Interestingly, the result of the phosphorylation of both receptors is the activation of several signaling pathways, such as the MAPKs, Akt, and GSK3β [ , ], which showed increased phosphorylation in proliferating AHPCs in the precursor population, effects of EGF and CM from NS/PCs-OE.
Conclusions
Based on the aforementioned information, our study produced three main findings: (1) human neural stem/progenitor cells derived from the olfactory epithelium produce and release soluble factors; (2) murine adult hippocampal precursor cells respond to SFs from hNS/PCs-OE by mainly undergoing astrocyte differentiation, with a relevant role for IL-6 as a mediator of this process; and (3) EGF induces TrkB transactivation to regulate the proliferative capability and the precursor stage of murine adult hippocampal precursor cells.
Although hNS/PCs have been proposed as a promising alternative for autologous transplantation, more studies are necessary to support this hypothesis and to increase the capability of these cells to form functional neurons in the CNS. However, the role of hNS/PCs-OE as a source of modulators of the neurogenic process, including neurotrophins, growth factors and cytokines, suggest their potential use in treating neurodegenerative disorders. However, this hypothesis requires additional studies that extend to an analysis of additional soluble factors released by hNS/PCs-OE and an evaluation of their possible effects in vivo. Nevertheless, our present data indicate a role for SFs from hNS/PCs-OE in adult neurogenesis, and their potential medical relevance is worth pursuing.
