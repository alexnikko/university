INTRODUCTION
The human nail plate is hard, durable, and has a complex structure. Nail plate protects the underlying bed region that is rich in blood vessels. It also safeguards the nail matrix region responsible for the cell proliferation and nail growth, located in the proximal ventral surface of the nail ( ). The nail plate consists of 80–90 layers of dead cells with three basic macroscopic strata layers: dorsal, intermediate, and ventral. These strata layers are composed of hard hair type keratin, soft skin type keratin, 10–30% of water, and 0.1–1% of lipid ( ). The structure and composition of nail plate limit the transungual permeation of drug substances, reducing the effectiveness of treatment therapies in nail disorders ( ). Onychomycosis is the most common prevailing nail disease, caused by fungal infection ( ). The causative agent of onychomycosis is predominantly dermatophyte fungi, but yeasts (especially Candida albicans ) and non-dermatophyte molds may also lead to onychomycosis ( , , ). The symptomatic indications of onychomycosis include thickening of the distal end of the nail along with loosening of the nail plate from the nail bed. Butter yellow-colored, vertical bands starting at the distal end of the nail are also observed in the disorder ( , , , , ).
Normally the treatment strategies for onychomycosis include a wide variety of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Antifungal drug is delivered orally for prolonged periods; however, the low therapeutic efficiency of these drugs due to limited availability at the site of action is a major concern in onychomycosis therapy ( , , , ). To overcome the mentioned limitation, either high doses or increased dosing frequency of drugs are prescribed. This in turn leads to consequences of side effects, drug-drug interaction, increased recurrence rate due to microbial resistance, and high treatment cost. Recently approved topical antifungal formulations for the treatment of onychomycosis like Penlac®, Ciclopoli®, Kerydin®, and Jublia® are alcohol based resulting into short residence time and insufficient permeation of therapeutic agents from the formulation across the nail plate ( , , ).
Terbinafine hydrochloride (TBF-HCl) is a potent synthetic allylamine-based antifungal agent, used for the treatment of superficial fungal infections pertaining to skin and nails ( ). TBF-HCl inhibits the enzyme squalene epoxidase required in fungal ergosterol biosynthesis, which in turn induces accumulation of intracellular squalene and causes cell’s death ( , ). Liposomes are colloidal phospholipidic vesicles comprised of lipid bilayers similar to that of bio-membranes existing in humans ( ). Liposomes have emerged as a promising drug delivery vehicle for increasing the permeation flux of many drugs across the biological membrane ( ). The present research was thus aimed at developing a liposome-loaded medicated nail lacquer formulation of TBF-HCl, which would increase the permeability flux of drug substance across the nail plate and efficiently deliver a therapeutic concentration of drug at the site of action.
MATERIALS AND METHODS

Hyderabad, India; gratis samples of DPPC and LIPOID S75 were obtained from LIPOID, Germany; cholesterol; nitrocellulose; and all the other chemicals, reagents, and solvents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, India. C. albicans was procured from Dr. Willmer Schwabe, India.
Methods
Formulation and Optimization of TBF-HCl-Loaded Liposomes
The drug-loaded liposomes were prepared utilizing conventional thin film hydration technique ( , , ). Particle size and lamellarity of the formed lipid vesicles (MLVs) were further reduced utilizing probe sonication technique. The process and formulation parameters for preparing liposomes with the desired properties were screened and optimized using the quality by design (QbD) approach.
Defining the Quality Attributes and Identifying CPPs
Critical quality attributes (CQAs) which would affect the efficiency and performance of the liposomes ( ) were identified and listed in Table I . Risk assessment and Pareto analysis studies, to identify the potential factors which may predominantly affect the quality target product profile (QTPP) of the liposomal formulation, were carried out based on the observations of preliminary trial experiments. The critical process parameters (CPPs) and critical material attributes (CMAs) that would significantly contribute and affect the quality of the formulation were screened and further utilized in experimental designing ( , ). Table I Critical Quality Attributes that Would Affect QTPP Quality targets Critical quality attribute (CQAs) Particle size of liposomal formulation Drug to lipid ratio, lipid to cholesterol molar ratio, temperature of rotary evaporator (for forming thin lipid film), speed of rotary evaporator, film rehydration fluid volume, rehydration time, amplitude of sonication and sonication time Physical stability of liposomal formulation measured in terms of PDI and zeta potential Entrapment efficiency
Optimization of Drug-Loaded Liposomes Employing Statistical Experimental Design
The Box-Behnken experimental design was employed for optimizing, process and formulation parameters used, for preparing liposomes through the design of experiment (DOE) approach for preparing the liposomes ( , , , ). Multiple regression analysis was applied on CPPs and CMAs (independent variables), screened on the basis of QTPP ( , , ). The Box-Behnken design with three independent factors, taken at three different levels, was used to construct a second-order polynomial equation used for optimizing the formulation with desired properties. Table I depicts the screened independent variables taken at three different levels. Dependent variables (responses), which are primary quality targets of liposomal formulation, are also mentioned in Table II . Significant contribution of each independent factors (CPPs and CMAs) at different levels, towards the responses, were estimated by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and P value (at 5% significance level) using the Design Expert 8.0.5.2 version software. The second-order polynomial equation generated by the design is as follows: $$ R={\mathrm{B}}_0+{\mathrm{B}}_1{\mathrm{X}}_1+{\mathrm{B}}_2{\mathrm{X}}_2+{\mathrm{B}}_3{\mathrm{X}}_3+{\mathrm{B}}_{12}{\mathrm{X}}_{12}+{\mathrm{B}}_{13}{\mathrm{X}}_{13}+{\mathrm{B}}_{23}{\mathrm{X}}_{23}+{\mathrm{B}}_{11}{{\mathrm{X}}_1}^2+{\mathrm{B}}_{22}{{\mathrm{X}}_2}^2+{\mathrm{B}}_{33}{{\mathrm{X}}_3}^2 $$ Table II Design Parameters of Liposomal Formulation with Responses and Constraints Parameter Levels used −1 0 1 CPPs and CMAs X1 (drug/lipid ratio) 1:3 1:5 1:7 X2 (sonication time in seconds) 0 60 120 X3 (sonication amplitude) 20 25 30 Responses Constraints Particle size In range (150–250 nm) PDI Minimum (0.1) Zeta potential Target (± 30 mV) Entrapment efficiency Maximum (100%)

Checkpoint Analysis
Independent variables at three random points, one from each contour plot, were taken and theoretical values of particle size, PDI, zeta potential, and entrapment efficiency were calculated using respective polynomial equation. Liposome formulation was prepared experimentally at three checkpoints and evaluated for the responses, which were statistically compared against the theoretically obtained values.
Formula Optimization
Influence of each factor on the responses was also graphically demonstrated by response surface plots ( , , ). Finally, the optimized formulae for formulating liposomes with the desired quality targets (set goals/constraint values) was predicted by the overlay plot generated by the software. The optimized formulae with desirability factor near to one were further validated by comparing the experimentally generated response values with the software-predicted response values.
Characterization of TBF-HCl-Loaded Liposomes
Particle Size, Polydispersity Index, and Zeta Potential
The particle size and polydispersity index (PDI) of the drug-loaded liposomes was measured using diffraction light scattering technique through photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS) using a zeta sizer (Nano ZS 90 Malvern Instruments, UK) ( ). Helium laser was used as a light source and scattering was monitored at 25 °C temperature and 90° detector angle. Fifteen milliliters of the liposomal formulation was diluted to 100-fold with purified water, and particle size was determined. Zeta potential of the formulated liposomes was measured by electrophoretic light scattering technique using a zeta sizer, which measures the electrophoretic mobility of particles moving in a liquid medium under an electric field. The particle size and morphology of the prepared liposomes was further determined through TEM analysis.
Encapsulation Efficiency
The liposomal suspension was centrifuged for 45 min at 14,000 rpm at 25 °C temperature. The supernatant was separated and non-entrapped drug concentration in the settled layer was determined by dissolving the settled drug pellets in methanol and quantifying by HPLC ( , ). The entrapment efficiency was calculated from the following equation: $$ \% EE=\frac{\left( Wa- Ws\right)}{Wa}\times 100 $$
where, Wa = concentration of drug added to formulation Ws = free drug concentration.
In Vitro Drug Release
Drug release rates from liposomes were determined through a dynamic dialysis procedure described previously. Briefly, TBF-HCl-loaded liposomal suspension was transferred into a dialysis tube. The dialysis tube (MWCO:100KD, 5 ml) was preconditioned in deionized water for 15 min and then in dialysis buffer (described below) for 30 min. Subsequently, the liposomes contained in the dialysis tube was dialyzed against 2 L of phosphate buffer pH 5.8, at 37 °C for 24 h. Twenty microliters of sample aliquots were withdrawn at regular time intervals, diluted and quantified using HPLC analysis using a UV detector at 263 nm. All experiments were replicated thrice and the results were presented as the mean of three observations with SD.
Lyophilization of TBF HCl-Loaded Liposomes
Five percent of trehalose was added as a cryoprotectant to TBF HCl-loaded liposomal suspension, filled into vials. Sample vials were then placed in a lyophilizer (Lyostar 3 SP Scientific, Gardiner). The lyophilization cycle was scheduled by initially decreasing the temperature to 5 °C from room temperature. The temperature was then progressively decreased to −5 °C and finally to −40 °C. Primary drying was achieved by maintaining the sample chamber pressure to 57 mTorr for 6 h. After primary drying, the sample temperature was gradually increased to 30 °C at a rate of 0.1 °C/min for 30 h for secondary drying ( ).
Formulation of Nail Lacquer Containing TBF HCl-Loaded Lyophilized Liposomes
Fifteen milliliters of nail lacquer loaded with a lyophilized form of TBF HCl liposomes was prepared using the formulation ingredients as mentioned in Table III . Initially, nitrocellulose was dissolved in 75% of the solvent mixture (butyl acetate + ethyl acetate + toluene), and plasticizer was added to the above solution followed by addition of resin with constant stirring for 30 min. The remaining amount of solvent was then added ( , , ). Finally, drug-loaded lyophilized liposomes equivalent to 1% w / w of TBF HCl were dispersed in the prepared nail lacquer vehicle with gentle stirring. Table III Formulation Components of Nail Lacquer Sr. No. Formulation component Quantity Purpose 1 Butyl acetate 23% Solvent 2 Ethyl acetate 27% Solvent 3 Toluene 20% Solvent 4 Nitrocellulose 15% Film forming agent 5 Toluene sulfonamide formaldehyde 8% Adhesive resin 6 Dibutyl phthalate 7% Plasticizer 7 Optimized drug-loaded liposome formulation (drug to lipid ratio 1:4.5, sonication time 67 s, and sonication amplitude 25%) Equivalent to 1% of TBF HCl Antifungal agent
Characterization of Liposome-Loaded Nail Lacquer Formulation
Drug content : Nail lacquer equivalent to 10 mg of TBF HCL was diluted to 100 mL with methanol. To the above solution, 10% triton X was added and vortexed for 10 min to facilitate lipid lysis. The resultant solution was then filtered through a 0.22-μm membrane filter and quantified for drug content through double-beam UV spectrophotometer ( , , ).
Film thickness : Single film layer of the formulated nail lacquer was cast on a petri plate with 12.5 cm 2 area, using a lacquer applicator brush. The film was allowed to dry at room temperature. The dried film was peeled off from the petri plate, and the thickness of the formed film was determined using a digital vernier caliper ( , , ).
Non-volatile content : 5 mL of formulated nail lacquer was evenly spread in a glass petri plate with an area of 6.2 cm 2 . Petri plate was then weighed and dried at 105 °C for 1 h. The reduction in the weight after drying was reported as total weight of non-volatile contents in nail lacquer ( , , , ).
Film drying time : A thin, single film (300 μL) of formulated nail lacquer was cast on a glass petri plate of area equivalent to 12.5 cm 2 , with the aid of a lacquer applicator brush. The time required to form a “dry to touch” film was reported as drying time of the film ( , , ).
Viscosity : To assess the rheology and “smoothness to flow” property, viscosity analysis of the formulated nail lacquer was carried out using viscometer (Brookfield LVDV). Five milliliters of the formulated nail lacquer was placed in a small sample adaptor, and viscosity was determined at room temperature using spindle no. SC4 at 20 rpm ( , , , ).
Adhesive strength : To ensure sufficient residence time of the film on the nail surface, adhesive strength determination study of the medicated nail lacquer formulation was performed. A TA XT-plus, texture analyzer (Stable micro system, UK) with p/25 cylindrical probe, was used to determine the adhesive strength of the nail lacquer film. A glass plate with a thin film of nail lacquer formulation cast with an applicator brush was clamped on the stage surface of the texture analyzer. The upper probe was then displaced from the height of 10 mm at a rated speed of 0.5 mm/s until it reaches the film surface. Once the probe touches the film, a trigger force of 0.4 N was applied for 1 s followed by withdrawal of the probe from the surface. The force required to detach the probe from the surface was recorded against time. The maximum force required for detachment was reported as the adhesive strength of the formulation ( , , , ).
In Vitro Drug Permeation
Permeation of drug from the fabricated nail lacquer formulation was determined across cattle hooves and human nails using Franz diffusion cell. Freshly excised cattle hooves were collected from the slaughter house, and the adhering cartilaginous and connective tissues were removed. One millimeter of membrane was then slashed from the distal end of the hooves and immersed in distilled water for 24 h to hydrate the tissue. Similarly, the hydrated human nail plate membrane was prepared to study the drug permeation rate. The nail clippings were collected from healthy human volunteers (male and female age, 20–35 years). The collected nail plates were washed with 70% v / v of ethanol with subsequent rinsing with deionized water; the nail plates were dried for overnight at room temperature. The thickness of the nail plates was found to be around 0.5 ± 0.09 mm and that of cattle hoof was around 0.8 ± 0.05 mm. The sectioned cattle hoof membrane/human nail plate was then mounted on Teflon ‘O’ ring between the receptor and donor compartments of the glass diffusion cell with the aid of clamps. The effective diffusion area of the nail plate was observed to be 0.505 cm 2 . The receptor chamber of the diffusion cell was filled with 12.5 ml of pH 5.8 phosphate buffer. On the nail plate/hoof membrane mounted on the Teflon ring, 2.5 ml of medicated nail lacquer formulation equivalent to 10 mg of TBF HCl was applied. The temperature of the diffusion medium, filled in receptor chamber, was maintained at 32 ± 2 °C by a water jacket. Constant stirring was maintained within the medium by a magnetic bead rotating at 100 rpm. Sample aliquots (0.5 ml) were withdrawn at predetermined time intervals and quantified with the aid of HPLC to determine the drug concentration. Permeation flux (J) of TBF HCl across the membranes was calculated using the equation, $$ J=\varDelta Q/ A\varDelta T $$
where J is permeability flux, ΔQ/ΔT is the slope of % cumulative permeated Vs time plot, and A is the effective area of diffusion ( , , , ).
Antifungal Activity
Drug-loaded liposome-based nail lacquer formulation was evaluated for its antimicrobial activity by cup plate method. C. albicans fungal suspension (0.2 mL) was inoculated in molten sabouraud dextrose agar media. Twenty milliliters of the culture medium was poured into a sterile petri plate and allowed to completely solidify. Cup wells with 8 mm diameter were dug in the solidified medium under aseptic conditions using a sterile cork borer. In one well plate, 0.5 mL of drug-loaded nail lacquer was added and in the other well, pure drug solution of similar concentration was added. The petri plate was then incubated at 27 °C for 72 h. After the incubation period, the zone of inhibition was measured using a zone reader ( ).
Statistical Analysis
Results of antimicrobial activity were expressed as mean value ± standard deviation (SD) of growth inhibition zone diameters obtained with standard drug solution and liposome-loaded nail lacquer formulation. Two-tailed Student’s t test was used to compare the results between the two variants. P values lower than 0.05 ( p < 0.05) were considered significant.
RESULTS
Formulation and Optimization of TBF-HCl-Loaded Liposomes
Defining the Quality Attributes and Identifying CPPs
Particle size, PDI, entrapment efficiency, and zeta potential were identified as critical quality attributes (CQAs) which would affect the efficiency and performance of the liposomal formulation. Risk assessment studies as shown in Table IV and Pareto analysis as shown in Figs. 1 and 2 depicted that drug to lipid ratio, the amplitude of sonication, and time duration for which the samples were exposed to sonication are critical process parameters (CPPs) and critical material attributes (CMAs) that significantly affected the quality targets of the liposomes. The orange bars in the Pareto chart indicated positive impact of independent variables on responses, and blue bars indicated negative or inverse impact. Bars closer to “ t value” limit of 2.228 depicted factors that would significantly affect the quality attributes.

Formulation Optimization of Drug-Loaded Liposomal Delivery System Employing Statistical Experimental Design
A total of 17 experimental runs, comprising center points and edge midpoints lying on the multidimensional cube, was developed using the Box-Behnken experimental design. Center points were replicated for five times to design a total of 17 experiments used to investigate the effect of all independent variables on dependent variables as depicted in Table V . The observed responses were used to construct a quadratic response surface graph, and a second-order polynomial equation was generated employing multiple regression analysis. The generated polynomial equation was used for optimization process, to fabricate liposomes with the desired properties.

Data Analysis
The 3D response surface plots showing the impact of independent variables on the responses is as shown in Fig. 3 . The observed experimental response values were fitted to various models, such as linear, cubic, quadratic, and 2FI using Design Expert software, and adequacy and good fit of the model were tested using analysis of variance (ANOVA). The predicted residual sum of square (PRESS) and multiple correlation coefficient values was used as factors for selection of model required to generate a secondary polynomial equation. The model with the smallest PRESS value and high correlation coefficient value was considered as the best fit model to generate a polynomial equation.

The particle size and morphology analysis of the optimized liposomal formulation were done through TEM analysis. TEM images, as shown in Fig. 6 , confirmed the formation of liposomes in a size range of 140–185 nm. Fig. 6 TEM images of the optimized liposomal formulation
In Vitro Drug Release Studies from Optimized Liposomes
In vitro , drug release data indicated that complete amount of the drug loaded in liposomes was released within a time span of 9 h, as depicted in Fig. 7 . Fig. 7 In vitro release profile of TBF HCl from liposomes
Characterization of TBF HCl Liposome-Loaded Nail Lacquer Formulation
Results of characterization studies for TBF HCl entrapped liposomes, dispersed in nail lacquer, are depicted in Table VII . Table VII Characterization Parameters for TBF HCl-Loaded Nail Lacquer Characterization parameter Observation Drug content 89.58 ± 2% Non volatile content 40.5 ± 0.5% Thickness of film 0.72 ± 0.05 mm Drying time 59 ± 5 s Adhesive strength 0.7 ± 0.1 N Viscosity 325± 15cps
In Vitro Drug Permeation
The calculated permeation flux of TBF HCl through liposomal nail lacquer formulation, across human nail plate, was observed to be 12.37 μg/mL/cm 2 . The observed flux was significantly more (t-score, 1.8 and P value, 0.0422 < 0.05) than the permeation flux of TBF HCl dispersion in nail lacquer formulation with 1% thioglycolic acid as a permeation enhancer. Permeation flux value of TBF HCl using permeation enhancer was observed to be 5.71 μg/mL/cm 2 . The permeability rate of TBF HCl across human nail plate, through liposomes, loaded nail lacquer was higher in comparison to drug-dispersed nail lacquer as shown in Fig. 8 . The permeability rate determination studies across cattle hoof as depicted in Fig. 9 also revealed that the permeability flux of TBF HCl through liposomal-loaded nail lacquer was observed to be 11.2 μg/mL/cm 2 across cattle hoof which was significantly higher (t-score, 2.74 and P value, 0.0057 < 0.05) than the permeation flux value of 4.25 μg/mL/cm 2 for TBF HCl dispersion in nail lacquer with permeation enhancer. Thus, from the permeability rate determination studies, it was concluded that TBF HCL entrapped liposomes increased the permeation rate of the drug substance across the nail plate, thereby increasing the therapeutic efficiency of the drug substance. Fig. 8 In vitro drug permeation studies across human nail plate Fig. 9 In vitro drug permeation studies across cattle hooves
Determination of Zone of Inhibition
The zone of inhibition around the well poured with pure drug solution was observed to be 24.0 ± 0.21 mm, whereas the zone of inhibition around the well filled with liposome-loaded nail lacquer formulation was observed to be 23.26 ± 0.37 mm. Thus, it can be inferred from the observations that the TBF HCl-loaded liposomal nail lacquer was efficient as pure drug dispersion in its antifungal activity.
Statistical Analysis
From the observed t score of 4.62, calculated “ p value” was found to be 0.0017 < 0.05. Thus, it can be inferred that there was no significant difference in the antimicrobial activity exhibited by TBF HCl solution and TBF HCl liposome-loaded nail lacquer formulation.
DISCUSSION
Pareto chart of particle size analysis revealed that the particle size increases with increase in lipid ratio and decreases with increase in sonication time and amplitude owing to increased kinetic energy during sonication. Similarly, Pareto chart of entrapment efficiency analysis revealed that entrapment efficiency increases with increase in lipid concentration and decreases with sonication time and sonication amplitude, due to probable leaching of the drug from the lipid bilayers because of repetitive sonication cycles. Pareto chart of PDI analysis revealed that polydispersity in particle size range increases with increase in sonication time, sonication amplitude, and drug to lipid ratio. Pareto chart of zeta potential analysis revealed that factors like drug to lipid ratio, sonication time, and sonication amplitude have a greater impact on zeta potential than other formulation or process parameters.
The coefficient values of the polynomial equations and the edge curves of response surface plots obtained from software-based experimental optimization studies indicated that particle size, PDI, zeta potential, and entrapment efficiency parameters are significantly affected by the independent variables screened by risk assessment and Pareto chart analysis.
Positive coefficient values in the polynomial equation derived for studying the impact of independent variables on responses indicated that with an increase in drug to lipid ratio, the particle size of the liposomes would increase, whereas negative coefficients indicated that with an increase in sonication amplitude and sonication time, the size of liposome would decrease. Negative coefficients for the interactions between two variables indicated an inverse response on the particle size.
Positive coefficient values of main effects like drug to lipid ratio indicated that with an increase in the value of effect, the PDI of the liposomal formulation would also increase. Negative coefficients indicated that with an increase in sonication amplitude and sonication time, the PDI of the liposome would decrease. Negative coefficients for the interactions between two variables indicated an inverse and favorable response on PDI.
Positive values of the coefficient in the generated polynomial equation for studying the impact of independent variables on zeta potential depicted with an increase in drug to lipid ratio, and sonication amplitude, the zeta potential of the liposomal formulation would increase. Negative coefficients indicated that with an increase in sonication time, the zeta potential of liposome would decrease. Negative coefficients for the interactions between two variables indicated an unfavorable response on zeta potential.
Positive coefficient values in the polynomial equation constructed for entrapment efficiency response indicated that with an increase in drug to lipid ratio, entrapment efficiency of liposomes would increase. Negative coefficients indicated that with an increase in sonication amplitude and sonication time, the drug entrapment efficiency of liposome would decrease. Overall, positive coefficients for the interactions between two variables indicated a favorable response on entrapment efficiency.
Results of the three checkpoint batches prepared and evaluated to validate the constructed polynomial equations from software-based experimental design revealed that there is no significant variation (Student’s t test analysis, P < 0.05) in theoretical responses predicted from the polynomial equation and the experimentally observed responses. Thus, it was concluded that the obtained mathematical equations are valid for predicting the responses.
Characterization studies of liposome-loaded nail lacquer formulations revealed that the drug content in the lacquer formulation was adequate. Non-volatile content which in turn may affect the drying time of the lacquer formulation was observed adequate since the drying time required for film formation was observed to be within 1 min. The results also revealed that the lacquer formulation exhibited sufficient viscosity required to spread uniformly over the nail surface. The thickness and adhesive strength of the formed film were sufficient to retain the film on the nail surface for the desired time span.
Permeability rate determination studies indicated that TBF HCl-entrapped liposomes increased the permeation rate of the drug substance across the nail plate, thereby increasing the therapeutic efficiency of the drug substance. Enhanced permeation of TBF HCl across the nail plate, delivered via liposome-dispersed nail lacquer, can be attributed to intact permeation of lipid vesicles across the nail plate due to its small vesicular size. Permeation enhancing the effect of the liposomal formulation across the nail plate can also be attributed to the generated hydration force and osmotic gradient. Antimicrobial studies revealed that the developed formulation was equally efficacious when compared to pure drug solution.
CONCLUSION
It can be concluded from the research findings that the permeation rate of TBF HCl across human nail plate was significantly enhanced when delivered through liposome-loaded nail lacquer formulation in comparison to medicated nail lacquer with a penetration enhancer. The designed drug delivery system thus would serve as an efficient tool for transungual permeation and can further be explored for the delivery of drug substances used specifically in nail disorders.
