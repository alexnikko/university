Introduction
Colorectal cancer is considered as one of the most prevalent types of cancer globally particularly in developing countries [ ]. In Saudi Arabia, it showed that colorectal cancer was the second most prevalent malignancy among Saudis at all ages (10.3 %) and is considered as the number one malignancy in males (11.8 %) [ ]. Previous epidemiological reports noted that diagnosis of colorectal cancer was at a younger age from different regions in Saudi Arabia [ , , , , ]. Earlier studies also show that factors contributing to the decrease in cancer mortality rates include an increase in cancer screening rates, appropriate normal screening test follow-up, and treatment advances [ , ]. Furthermore, colorectal cancer screening rates are decreasing, relatively far behind those of all other cancer screening tests [ ]. Barriers influencing the decision of patients to engage in colorectal cancer screening programs should deserve an attention to improving uptake of colorectal cancer screening.
When colorectal cancer screening detects bowel cancer at an early stage before it spreads, the 5-year relative survival rate and the likelihood of successful treatment is high [ , ]. There are several types of a screening test for colorectal cancer which are recommended by the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) such as high sensitivity Faecal Occult Blood Test (FOBT), flexible sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy [ ]. Faecal Occult Blood Test has been shown to reduce mortality significantly from bowel cancer [ ]. Furthermore, a number of factors that may contribute to colorectal cancer screening disparities include inadequate health literacy and lack of awareness and about the importance of completing cancer screening tests [ ].
Several studies have shown that low health literacy is associated with limited awareness about cancer screening, lack of desire for screening, and poorer access to care [ , ]. Health literacy is defined as “the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, communicate, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions” [ ]. Thus, gaining a better understanding of the predictors of colorectal cancer screening among Saudi colorectal cancer patients is important for identifying targeted cancer controlled interventions.
From the patient perspective, it is essential to understand the potential benefits, harms, alternatives, and uncertainties associated with a recommended colorectal cancer screening tests when making a decision. Health literacy may play an important role in patients’ decision making particularly in colorectal cancer screening [ ]. Nevertheless, measuring patients’ health literacy is challenging because it involves awareness, multiple skills, previous personal experiences, settings, and contexts [ ]. Several tools has been developed and tested in order to measure health literacy such as the Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (TOFHLA), the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM) tests, and the National Center for Education Statistics’ National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL) [ , , , , ]. Additional instruments such as Health Literacy Skills Instrument (HLSI) is available in shorter version and some instruments have been validated in other languages [ , , ]. In addition, some develop instruments measure skills associated with reading, understanding text, and ability to seek information via the Internet [ ].
Less is known, however, about the level of health literacy of colorectal cancer patients in Saudi Arabia and is associated with low awareness, beliefs, and attitudes about colorectal cancer screening tests. There is a lack of knowledge about colorectal cancer (CRC) screening in Saudi regions and it is natural that attitude and beliefs regarding this are influenced by an individual’s level of education. Most often there is fear of undergoing investigation, and the same reason would likely make people decide to choose less invasive testing, using barium enema or a CT of the abdomen. Therefore, a population-based study has been developed to explore the association between functional health literacy and awareness of, beliefs, and attitudes about colorectal cancer screening test. This information is essential to identify specific areas for intervention and focus on health promotion and education to improve uptake of colorectal cancer screening and awareness of colorectal cancer among Saudi patients.
Methods
Study Subjects and Data Collection
A total of 256 adult Saudi patients were included in this descriptive cross-sectional study. All subjects were recruited from two tertiary hospitals (King Khalid University Hospital and Security Forces Hospital) in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, from October to December 2015. The selected hospitals were chosen because of the availability of surgical and oncology specialties and accessibility for the participants. Ethical approval was obtained from the King Saud University (CAMS 22–36/37) and from each of the selected hospitals prior to distribution of the survey questionnaires.
The eligibility criteria of the participants for the study was their age, in which they had to be 40 years of age or older, and they had no prior history of colorectal cancer. The age threshold was chosen according to the colorectal cancer screening guidelines recommended by the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and a study about age to start screening for colorectal cancer among Saudi nationals [ , ]. According to the USPSTF, the average age of screening for colorectal cancer patients should begin at age 50 years for average-risk adults and at 40 years for high-risk adults [ ]. In addition, the recommended colorectal cancer screening in Saudi Arabia should start at an earlier age, namely, 45 years at least, for women [ ]. After obtaining verbal informed consent, all included participants were given a self-administered survey for the first and second part of the survey questionnaire which includes demographic and measuring colorectal cancer screening independent variables such as awareness, beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors. Meanwhile, the third part of the questionnaire was done through an interview by a trained researcher to whom they answered verbally.
Questionnaire Design
The survey instrument consisted of basic demographic information such as age, educational level, and marital status. Selected items on measuring colorectal cancer screening awareness, beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors were chosen from a previous study [ ]. In addition, the Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (STOFHLA) was selected because it was demonstrated across different countries to have both sufficient validity and reliability to assess health literacy of patients with colorectal cancer [ ]. The second part of the questionnaire which includes independent variables measuring colorectal cancer screening like awareness, beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors was translated by a professional Arabic-English language translator from English to Arabic and back to English for scoring a better response from the participating subjects. The survey questions about colorectal cancer and tests to screen for colorectal cancer were formatted in a five-point adjectival scale, with anchors of “very good” to “very poor,” “extremely concerned” to “not at all concerned,” and “definitely not” to “definitely yes.” A smaller number of items required “yes” or “no” responses. The instrument was pilot-tested and modified prior to data collection. The alpha coefficient for the survey questionnaire was 0.712 suggesting that the items have relatively internal consistency.
Functional health literacy assessed using STOFHLA [ ] consisted of a 36-item test based on two passages selected from instructions for preparation for an upper gastrointestinal series and the patient rights and responsibilities section of a Medical aid or insurance application form. The STOFHLA was a reading comprehension test which assesses patients’ ability to read passages using real materials from the healthcare setting. The raw scores were classified as inadequate functional health literacy (scores 0–16), marginal functional health literacy (scores 17–22), or adequate functional health literacy (scores 23–36). Inadequate functional health literacy and marginal functional health literacy, which did not have enough number of responders, were kept together in one group. Patients who indicated they could not read at all ( n = 13) were assigned a score of 0. In addition, patients who indicated they could not see or do not have their glasses ( n = 8) were assigned a score of 0 because when asked to read something, patients with limited literacy was often hiding their limited literacy skills by reporting they forgot their reading glasses.
Statistical Analysis
All data were entered and analyzed using SPSS 22 (Chicago, Illinois). The STOFHLA questionnaire was supplemented with a scoring manual which was followed by the researchers. Subjects were dichotomized based on functional health literacy level: adequate and inadequate/marginal functional health status group. For group comparisons, all colorectal cancer screening items were dichotomized into categories such as independent variables like correct and incorrect (awareness) and agree and disagree (attitudes). Differences between dependent variables (the two literacy groups) were compared with chi-square. When chi-squares were significant, the effect size was calculated using an odds ratio and corresponding 95 % confidence intervals. Frequency distribution was presented as percentages. P value was set at 0.05 and considered statistically significant.
Results
Characteristics of the Study Subjects
Demographics of the respondents is presented in Table 1 . Seventy-five percent of the participants were in the age group of 40 to 50 years (Mean—47.98 SD 6.95). The majority of the participants were males (71.5 %) and married (85.5 %). More than half of the participants had a university degree (57.4 %) and 69 % were employed. Health status or quality of life was self-reported as good by 52.3 % of the participants and as very good by 44.5 %.

The mean STOFHLA score was 14.7 (0–36) as shown in Table 1 . More than half of the participants had inadequate functional health literacy skills, 16.4 % had marginal functional health literacy, and 17.6 % had adequate health literacy. The STOFHLA scores were significantly related with age ( p = 0.004), gender ( p = 0.001), marital status ( p = 0.010), employment status ( p = 0.016), and quality of life ( p = 0.026).
Awareness About Colorectal Cancer in the Participating Subjects
Tables 2 and 3 show the association between awareness, attitudes, and beliefs of the participants between functional health literacy. Overall, the majority of the participants in both groups (adequate and inadequate groups) showed a limited awareness about colorectal cancer and colorectal cancer-related screening and testing. After chi-square analysis, no significant association was found between functional health literacy and awareness about colorectal cancer and colorectal cancer screening. For example, almost all of the participants heard about colorectal cancer, FOBT, sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy but there was no association between their STOFHLA scores. However, the chi-square analysis showed significant association of functional health literacy with awareness about the age of testing recommended for sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy ( p = 0.001). A significant association was also found in patients for understanding frequencies for the number of colorectal cancer tests and functional health literacy ( p = 0.001).

Beliefs and Attitudes About Colorectal Cancer in Participating Subjects
The majority of the participants in both groups believed that colorectal cancer was harmful and nearly all of the participants were concerned that FOBT, sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy may reveal cancer. However, there was no significant association between these factors and STOFHLA scores. Similarly, no significant association was found between functional health literacy as assessed by STOFHLA and concerns that FOBT ( p = 0.384) and sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy might cause embarrassment ( p = 0.089), harm ( p = 0.917), and pain ( p = 0.849). Also, the majority of the participants with adequate and inadequate/marginal health literacy would likely to know if they had cancer. Participant inadequate and inadequate/marginal health literacy responded that chances of being cured were very poor if diagnosed with colorectal cancer and was statistically associated with functional health literacy ( p = 0.028) as well as the participant’s belief of the probability that they had to develop colorectal cancer compared to the general population ( p = 0.033).
Discussion
This study provides insight into the level of health literacy, awareness, beliefs, and attitudes of Saudi nationals about the concept of colorectal cancer and colorectal cancer screening tests. The finding indicates that majority of the participants have low health literacy and less awareness about colorectal cancer screening. Our findings were similar to a study done in Australia where awareness and awareness of colorectal cancer were low [ ]. Furthermore, the present study indicates that most of the participants were aware of colorectal cancer but were not able to define of what age should a person begin testing and how often should a person be tested for colorectal cancer. The findings of this study are parallel to the previous cohort study done in Ireland where patients displayed no clear understanding about colorectal cancer and colorectal cancer screening [ ]. The present results also showed that majority of the participants were not sure whether their awareness about colorectal cancer and colorectal cancer screening were correct. The results indicate a need for awareness program about colorectal cancer and colorectal cancer screening. For example, using mass media like printed materials and media advertising that show the importance of colorectal cancer screening will help in increasing such awareness. Studies have shown that media advertising about colorectal cancer and colorectal cancer screening was significantly associated with greater awareness and awareness on colorectal cancer [ ]. It has been proven that using mass media promotions and the advertisement was found to be an important trigger for participation in colorectal cancer screening [ ].
Awareness is not the only factor that encourages the patients for considering going through colorectal cancer screening; other factors include attitude and beliefs of patients such as fear from receiving and knowing the results, embarrassment or shame, access to medical checkups, and financial barriers [ , ]. Our study shows that a large number of participants in both groups with adequate and inadequate/marginal functional health literacy were keen to understand if they had cancer after having a colorectal cancer screening. However, the majority of the participants were concerned that the screening test might be embarrassing and cause harm or pain. Studies show that feeling of embarrassment or shame was strongly associated with intention of getting screened as cancer patients; however, it was not an independent predictor of screening intent [ , , , ]. Meanwhile, patient concerns about embarrassment and shame vary from the studies done in Spain [ ]. This shows the need for educational and screening promotion and programs that would address this misbelief toward colorectal cancer and screening that exist between various cultural groups. These factors could also be well addressed by providing health education as well as discussions with healthcare providers who are in good position to advocate patients to undergo colorectal cancer screening. A physician or health provider’s recommendation also influences patients on completion of colorectal cancer testing and screening [ , ]. Patients’ regular medical check-ups have been found to be positively associated with adherence to colorectal cancer screening [ , ].
This study also highlights an important finding that a significant proportion of patients had a low or marginal functional health literacy indicating that there was still failure among patients to clearly understand the concept and need for colorectal cancer screening. Our findings show that low health literacy had a significant association with awareness, attitude, and beliefs of patients about colorectal cancer screening. Various studies have examined that low health literacy is associated with limited awareness about colorectal cancer screening [ , , ]. It also affects patients’ desire and adherence for cancer screening and poorer access to care [ , ]. This stresses a need for powerful public health initiatives that can provide awareness among patients’ insights about the significance of colorectal cancer screening and influence health-seeking behavior of patients to comply with screening [ , ].
Colorectal cancer screening is a complex procedure which involves most contact and preparations such as collection of stool and dietary preparations prior to colonoscopy. These procedures demand literacy skills to comprehend or follow instructions. The low level of health literacy among patients may explain the low rates of adherence to colorectal cancer screening. Patients with low health literacy levels often cannot comprehend or follow instructions for screening and medications as well as in making decisions regarding their healthcare [ ]. Health literacy is essential for everyone because it helps us to understand and use health information and services. Furthermore, improving patients’ health literacy may help to protect and prevent health problems as well as better management of various problems and unexpected situations that may happen.
This study presents some limitations. The study is limited in terms by the small number of the sample size which cannot be a representative of the general patient population. The participants were also recruited from one region and cannot represent all Saudi adults. Another limitation of the study was the questionnaire used in this study which might have created a bias because of compliance and misinterpretation of the questions. However, these findings might be useful in formulating public health awareness about the importance and adherence to colorectal cancer screening.
In conclusion, the present study revealed the low level of health literacy among Saudi adults. Although the level of literacy was low, the biggest concern is the low level of awareness and beliefs of Saudi adults about colorectal cancer and colorectal cancer screening. The results also suggest a positive attitude among the participants to undergo colorectal cancer screening. This study suggests for implementing more public health awareness program that will enhance the level of awareness of the participants and provide correct information to them about colorectal cancer and colorectal cancer screening.
