Introduction
Pemphigus is a collective term for a rare group of organ-specific autoimmune diseases that affect the skin and the mucous membranes. These intraepidermal bullous diseases manifest with vesicles and erosions on the epithelium of mucous membranes and skin, often causing a prominent impairment of quality of life and increased morbidity and mortality [ , ]. The etiopathogenesis of pemphigus is characterized by the formation of autoantibodies directed against different proteins of the desmosomes. The binding of these autoantibodies to desmosomal components disrupts intraepidermal adhesion, leading to acantholysis and intraepithelial blister formation [ , ].
Different subtypes of pemphigus have been identified, based on clinical and histologic features as well as on the specific antigens targeted by circulating autoantibodies. While pemphigus vulgaris (PV) and pemphigus foliaceus (PF) are the two most common forms, some nonclassical forms have been recognized in the last decades, including paraneoplastic pemphigus (PNP), pemphigus herpetiformis (PH), and IgA pemphigus [ ].
Regardless of pemphigus subtype, the development of autoantibodies directed against desmosomal components has long been considered the main process in the disease pathogenesis. In addition to the indispensable role of humoral immunity, the role of T-cell-associated responses in the promotion of autoantibodies should not be ignored in the pathogenesis of the disease [ ].
The epidemiological features of pemphigus vary substantially in different regions across the world. The prognosis, mortality, and clinical outcomes of patients with pemphigus have undergone dramatic change throughout the years. Furthermore, comorbidities and associated conditions among patients with pemphigus are not firmly established, due to the paucity and inconsistency of previous observational studies.
The current review aims to describe the epidemiology, mortality, and comorbidities of the different subtypes of pemphigus. In addition, an overview regarding each subtype of the disease will be reviewed.
Pemphigus vulgaris
PV has been recognized as the most prevalent type of pemphigus, comprising up to 70% of all cases of pemphigus [ ]. The initial clinical presentation includes extremely painful erosions on the mucous membranes. While the oral mucosa is most frequently affected, leading to dysphagia and weight loss, the involvement of other mucosal surfaces, including the pharyngo-laryngeal, esophageal, genital, anal, and conjunctival mucosae, has been reported. Skin involvement usually occurs after mucosal involvement and is characterized by flaccid vesicles localized mainly in the flexural areas, face, scalp, and extremities [ , ].
The etiopathogenesis of PV is characterized by acantholysis and intraepidermal blister formation, resulting from IgG autoantibodies directed against transmembrane desmosomal glycoprotein desmoglein 3, and in some cases desmoglein 1 [ , ]. Anti-desmoglein 3 IgG antibodies are both necessary and sufficient to cause characteristic suprabasal epidermal blisters in mouse models of passive transfer [ ].
Pemphigus vegetans
Pemphigus vegetans is a rare clinical type of PV characterized by vegetating skin lesions in the folds, mainly in the axillary, umbilical, perianal, inguinal, and mammary areas. Patients presenting with a longstanding course may develop dry, hyperkeratotic, and fissured vegetations. In addition to the typical acantholysis, histological analysis reveals hyperacanthosis and papillomatosis. The deposition pattern seen via direct immunofluorescence is identical to typical PV [ , , ].
Epidemiology
PV shows an uneven geographic and ethnic distribution, with annual incidence rates ranging between less than 0.76 per million population in Finland [ ] to 16.1 per million population in Israel [ ] (Table 1 ). Interestingly, a high incidence of pemphigus was observed in some ethnic groups, namely Ashkenazi Jews and those of Mediterranean origin. In a recent population-based study, PV was 3.6 times more frequent among Jews as compared to Arabs in Israel [ ]. In a study by Simon et al. [ ], the annual incidence of PV in North America was reported to be 32 per million population in people with Jewish roots and 4.2 per million population in people from other ethnic groups. This observation has been shown to be strongly related to several HLA class II genes, HLA-DRB1*04 and HLA-A*10, which have been more frequently found among Ashkenazi Jewish pemphigus patients [ , , , ]. Recently, a polymorphic variant in ST18 encoding a proapoptotic molecule was found to be significantly associated with PV in Jewish and Egyptian cohorts, but not in a German sample [ ].

The age of presentation in PV ranges between 36.5 years in Kuwait [ ] and 72.4 years in Bulgaria [ ]. Interestingly, a recent Israeli population-based study showed that the mean age of onset among Arab patients was substantially younger than that of Jewish patients (44.3 ± 15.4 vs. 54.5 ± 15.6 years, respectively, P = 0.001) [ ], and is comparable to the age of onset in other Middle Eastern and Arab countries, including Iran (42 years) [ ], Turkey (43 years) [ ], and Saudi Arabia (43.1 years) [ ]. Apart from two studies originating from Kuwait [ ] and Saudi Arabia [ ], a female preponderance was reported in all the remaining study cohorts, with a female to male ratio ranging between 1.1 in Finland [ ] and 5.0 in the USA [ ].
Mortality
Mortality among pemphigus patients, and those with PV in particular, has dramatically diminished from 75 to 30% following the advent of corticosteroids in the early 1950s [ ]. Subsequently, the adjuvant use of immunosuppressants in the 1980s contributed to the further decrease in mortality from the disease itself to below 5% in study populations and 0.021 per 100,000 inhabitants in the USA [ , , ]. In a recent study from the USA, patients with a secondary diagnosis of pemphigus had significantly higher inpatient mortality (3.2%) than those with a primary (1.6%) or no (1.8%) diagnosis of pemphigus, further supporting the hypothesis that direct mortality from the disease is currently low [ ]. In a British population-based study using a computerized database, mortality among PV patients was 3.3 times higher than among age- and sex-matched control subjects [ ]. In Israel, the mortality of PV patients was reported to be 2.6 times higher than expected in the age- and sex-matched general population (standardized mortality ratio [SMR] = 2.6) [ ]. In addition, the overall survival rates at 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 years were estimated at 95.2, 92.9, 89.5, 80.2, and 65.3%, respectively [ ].
Infections, especially pneumonia and sepsis, were the most frequent causes of death in different study populations [ , , , ]. Only two studies, originating from Israel and Taiwan, had explored cause-specific SMRs among pemphigus patients, aiming to estimate the risk for mortality due to specific causes relative to the general population [ , ]. In Israel, the risk of death due to an infectious disease was 22.6-fold higher than observed in the matched general population [ ]. Relative to the general population, pemphigus patients showed a statistically significant increased likelihood of death resulting from pneumonia (SMR = 26.5 in Israel [ ]; SMR = 3.6 in Taiwan [ ]) and sepsis (SMR = 8.6 in Israel [ ]; SMR = 11.6 in Taiwan [ ]). Cardiovascular diseases and peptic ulcer disease were also significant causes for death as compared to the control population [ , ].
Pemphigus foliaceus
PF is the second most prevalent variant of pemphigus. Its clinical presentation frequently consists of erosions surrounded by erythema that heal with crusting and scaling, with sparing of the mucosal surfaces. As the vesicles are superficial and fragile, only the resultant erosion can be observed in most cases. Although a predilection for seborrheic regions (central face, neck, chest, and upper back) is well-known, lesions of PF can potentially become more generalized, evolving even to erythroderma [ ].
The autoantigen implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease is desmoglein 1, an adhesive cadherin protein found in the desmosomal cell junction in the epidermis. Blister formation is superficial, occurring in and around the granular layer of the epidermis. This is because the uppermost layer of the epidermis is the only zone in which desmoglein 1 is required for cell adhesion (due to lack of co-expression of desmoglein 3) [ , ]. Binding of these autoantibodies with desmoglein 1 results in acantholysis and the development of the clinical phenotype of PF [ ].
Pemphigus erythematosus ( Senear-Usher syndrome ) is a clinical variant of PF characterized by a less severe presentation that resembles PF but is usually restricted to the face, over the nose, and cheeks in a butterfly distribution, imitating lupus erythematosus or seborrheic dermatitis [ , ]. Granular IgG or C3 deposits along the dermoepidermal junction similar to that of a lupus band test may be seen in some patients, in addition to the typical intercellular staining. Many patients with pemphigus erythematosus present with serologic findings suggestive of systemic lupus erythematosus, especially the presence of anti-nuclear antibodies [ ].
In addition to sporadic cases, endemic types of PF have been described in several foci across the world. Patients with endemic PF are clinically, histologically, and immunologically indistinguishable from patents with sporadic PF [ , , ]. Endemic PF differs from sporadic PF in its geographic distribution, familial predisposition, and younger age of presentation [ , ].
Epidemiology of sporadic pemphigus foliaceus
Sporadic PF is a rare disease, corresponding to 20–30% of pemphigus cases. Its estimated annual incidence in the USA and in Europe is estimated at less than 1 case per million inhabitants [ ] (Table 1 ).
An association with HLA-DRB1*0101 was observed among Mexican patients with sporadic PF [ ]. HLA-DRB1*04 was associated with increased risk for PF in Brazilian, Dutch, French, and Italian populations [ , , ]. However, no ethnic predisposition in PF was noted in Israel, where the adjusted incidence rate of the disease was comparable between Jews and Arabs [ ].
Epidemiology of endemic pemphigus foliaceus
Brazilian pemphigus foliaceus (folgo selvagem)
This disease occurs in some subtropical areas of Brazil. Most of the epidemiological data has been gathered from the Limao Verde Amerindian reservation in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, where the prevalence of the disease in this population is as high as 3–5% [ ]. The majority of patients are young outdoor workers who live in poor hygiene and housing conditions in forest areas adjacent to rivers and streams. No ethnic or sexual predisposition was reported. The lower prevalence observed in industrial areas of Sao Paulo and Parana was attributed to better housing conditions [ , ].
A well-established association has been made between the incidence of fogo selvagem and the infestation of endemic areas with some insects, including Simulium (also known as “black fly”). A seasonal pattern has also been observed, with the highest incidence occurring at the end of the winter and the lowest incidence during the dry summer [ ]. This temporal and geographic clustering lends weight to the hypothesis that an exogenous antigen triggers the induction of molecular mimicry involving desmoglein 1. This hypothesis was further substantiated by serological studies demonstrating high positivity rates of anti-desmoglein 1 antibodies in sera of individuals without pemphigus living in endemic regions [ ]. These sera recognized epitopes restricted to the extracellular (EC)-5 nonpathogenic domain. It was hypothesized that in individuals living in endemic areas with the known HLA susceptibility alleles, a response to the pathogenic EC-1 and EC-2 domains may subsequently occur by epitope spreading and thus induce the clinical signs of the disease [ ]. A switch from IgG subclasses 1, 2, and 3 to IgG4 paralleled with a switch of the antibody response from the nonpathogenic EC-5 to the pathogenic EC-1 or EC-2 domains is another potential mechanism that has been suggested for the development of this endemic disease [ , ]. HLA-DRB1 alleles *0404, *1402, *1406, and *0102 have been previously identified as risk factors for the disease [ ].
Colombian pemphigus foliaceus
The El Bagre region in northern Colombia is another focus of endemic PF, especially in rural areas [ ]. Most of the included patients were illiterate and poor and performed outdoor activities, such as forestry and farming. The prevalence of the disease in the area is approximately 5% [ ]. Unlike fogo selvagem, a prominent male preponderance (95%) was observed [ ].
Tunisian pemphigus foliaceus
This disease mainly occurs in the southern area of Tunisia, as well as in other north African Arab countries (Algeria and Morocco) and some sub-Saharan countries, such as Mali [ , ]. While the annual incidence of pemphigus in Tunisia is estimated at 6–7 cases per million inhabitants nationally, the rate of endemic PF in some areas of South Tunisia exceeds 20 cases per million inhabitants. The disease is characterized by a notable predilection for young females, with the majority of patients aged between 25 and 34 years. Similar to the PF in Brazil and Colombia, the disease was associated with poor living conditions in rural areas.
The disease was associated with HLA-DRB1*03, similar to nonendemic PF in patients with other parts of Tunisia [ ]. A high prevalence of anti-desmoglein 1 antibodies has been detected in the sera of individuals living in endemic areas, as well as among genetically related or unrelated household members of patients [ , , ]. Subclass analysis of anti-desmoglein 1 antibodies revealed that they were almost exclusively of the IgG2 subclass in healthy control sera and of the IgG4 subclass in patients with PF [ ].
Mortality
PF is usually considered to have a better prognosis than PV. In contrast to the potentially devastating nature of PV, PF has a more benign and chronic course that tends to persist for months to years [ ]. In a recent population-based study originating from Israel, the mortality among patients with PF was not significantly increased as compared with the age- and sex-matched general population (SMR, 1.4; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.6–2.9) [ ]. In the same study, the overall survival rates at 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 years were estimated to be 100, 96.7, 92.5, 81.2, and 81.2%, respectively [ ].
Comorbidities of the common subtypes of pemphigus (pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus)
Pemphigus was found to be associated with several autoimmune diseases in numerous controlled studies. Leshem et al. [ ] and Parameswaran et al. [ ] reported that autoimmune thyroid diseases and rheumatoid arthritis were significantly more prevalent in patients with pemphigus than in their first-degree relatives and the general population, respectively. The latter revealed that type-1 diabetes mellitus was also more prevalent among pemphigus patients [ ]. In a large-scale Taiwanese study, additional comorbidity was identified with Sjögren’s syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, and alopecia areata [ ]. The prevalence of ulcerative colitis, but not Crohn’s disease, was increased among pemphigus patients relative to matched control subjects [ ]. Furthermore, first-degree family members of patients with pemphigus have been shown to have a significant increase in the prevalence of autoimmune diseases when compared to controls [ ].
A novel association between pemphigus and psoriasis had been recently detected in three large-scale studies [ , , ]. These findings lend weight to multiple case reports depicting the coexistence of the two entities in individual patients [ , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ].
The association of PV and PF with comorbid malignancies is yet to be firmly established. Ogawa et al. [ ] reported that the prevalence of internal malignancies among 496 Japanese patients with pemphigus (5.0%) was higher than expected in the general Japanese population (0.6%), with lung cancer being the most frequent solid malignancy. In a recent German case-control study, PV was found to be associated with oropharyngeal (odds ratio [OR], 7.2; 95% CI, 2.7–19.9), gastrointestinal (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.9–3.5), and colon (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.6–3.6) neoplasms, whereas PF was associated with nonmelanoma skin cancer (OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.4–4.0) [ ]. In the same study, PV, but not PF, was reported to be associated with hematologic malignancies (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.4–3.0) [ ]. The latter was further substantiated by a recent population-based study demonstrating that the prevalence of chronic leukemia (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.2–3.6), multiple myeloma (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.2–3.9), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.0–2.2) was greater in patients with pemphigus than in controls [ ].
Two recent Israeli cross-sectional studies, encompassing 1985 patients, revealed an association between pemphigus and bipolar disorder [ ] and schizophrenia [ ]. A smaller Israeli study has shown an increased prevalence of comorbid depression among patients with pemphigus relative to matched control subjects [ ]. In the study of Kumar et al. [ ] examining 50 Indian pemphigus patients, psychiatric comorbidity was diagnosed in 26% (according to ICD-10) and in 40% of the patients (according to GHQ-12). An Iranian study reported a 73.7% prevalence of mental disorders among patients with pemphigus [ ]. Anxiety and depression have been reported to correlate with disease activity [ ] and to persist during quiescent periods [ ]. Recently, a large-scale population-based study revealed that the prevalence of several neurological conditions, namely epilepsy, dementia, and Parkinson’s disease among patients with pemphigus, was significantly higher than in healthy control subjects [ ]. The association of pemphigus with Parkinson’s disease and epilepsy was demonstrated in an earlier cross-sectional uncontrolled study [ ].
An increased prevalence of osteoporosis was identified in patients with pemphigus as compared to control subjects (40.4 vs. 6.5%, respectively) [ ]. These findings were reinforced by a subsequent controlled study examining patients with autoimmune bullous diseases, including pemphigus [ ]. This comorbidity was attributed to corticosteroids administered to patients with pemphigus [ ].
Table 2 summarizes the well-established comorbidities found to be associated with pemphigus. Only significantly associated conditions observed in more than one well-designed controlled study were listed.

Paraneoplastic pemphigus
PNP is a rare and devastating intraepidermal autoimmune bullous disease associated mainly with lymphoproliferative neoplasms [ ]. PNP demonstrates severe mucocutaneous lesions in a polymorphous presentation that resembles PV, erythema multiforme, and lichen planus [ ]. Cutaneous involvement with a slight predilection for the upper body usually appears following the onset of mucosal lesions [ ].
The disease is thought to be caused by an autoimmune response generated by antibodies to tumor antigens that cross-react with epithelial antigen, including both desmosomal and hemidesmosomal antigens. The central autoantigens implicated in PNP are the plakin family proteins (plectin, desmoplakins I and II, envoplakin, periplakin, and BP-230) and desmogleins 1 and 3 [ , ]. Alpha-2-macroglobulin-like protein 1 has been recently identified as the 170-kDa PNP antigen thought to be critical in PNP pathogenesis [ ]. Progressive respiratory failure triggered by severe restrictive bronchiolitis frequently leads to a fatal outcome in patients with PNP.
Epidemiology
PNP is an extremely rare disease, with only approximately 450 cases to date in the literature [ ]. Thus, the true incidence of the disease has not been fully elucidated. It typically affects patients between 45 and 70 years of age, but it may also occur in children, particularly when associated with Castleman’s disease [ ]. Among children with PNP, an ethnic predisposition in those of Hispanic origin was identified [ ]. A male predominance was reported in a French cohort (58.5%) [ ], as compared to a female predominance (56.7%) in an international cohort encompassing a majority of Asian patients [ ].
Genetic studies revealed an association with HLA class II DRB1*03 and HLA Cw*14 in the Chinese population, distinct from HLAs associated with PV and PF (HLA DRB1*04 and DRB1*14) in the same population [ , ].
Mortality
The prognosis of PNP is considered poor, with a mortality rate ranging from 75 to 90% in varying lengths of follow-up. The prognosis relies on the associated malignancy. A subgroup of patients experiences rapid improvement after excision of a benign tumor, such as in Castleman’s disease [ ]. Nevertheless, PNP associated with malignant neoplasms is characterized by high fatality, both from the underlying neoplasm and the from the recalcitrant course of the disease and its complications, including mainly infections and bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) [ ].
In a recent analysis of 53 PNP patients, the mortality rates were estimated at 51, 59, and 62% at 1, 2, and 5 years following the diagnosis of PNP [ ]. Infectious complications were the main cause of death (58.3%), followed by the progression of the underlying neoplasm (16.7%) [ ]. Erythema multiforme-like lesions were associated with a 2-fold increased risk of death and a 3-fold increased risk of death when accompanied by severe cutaneous or mucosal involvement at presentation [ ].
Ohzono et al. [ ] reported a mortality rate of 40% among 104 PNP patients throughout 16 years of follow-up. This figure may be an underestimate due to the high loss to follow-up rate (26.9%). Overall, 40% of deaths were attributed to BO, while the remaining 60% due to infections (mainly pneumonia) and the underlying malignancies.
Comorbidities
PNP was originally reported in 1990 by Anhalt et al. in 5 patients with lymphoproliferative disorders [ ]. Since then, more malignancies have been linked to the disease, with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic myeloid leukemia being the most frequently associated. A review summarizing all 163 published cases of PNP between the years 1990 and 2003 revealed that the prevalence of associated malignancies was as follows: non-Hodgkin lymphoma (38.6%), chronic myeloid leukemia (18.4%), Castleman’s disease (18.4%), and nonhematologic neoplasms (16.0%), including carcinoma (8.6%) and sarcoma (6.2%) [ ]. In a recent international retrospective cohort study of 104 PNP patients, the leading underlying malignancy was malignant lymphoma (45%), followed by solid malignancies (16%), Castleman’s disease (15%), thymoma (7%), sarcoma (6%), and a surprisingly lower prevalence of leukemia (7%) [ ]. Among pediatric patients, Castleman’s disease emerged as the leading associated neoplasm [ ].
Ethnic variation exists in the distribution of the underlying malignancies. Castleman’s disease is the predominant neoplasm among Chinese patients, while non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia account for approximately two-thirds of the associated neoplasms in the USA, Europe, and Japan [ , ].
It is noteworthy that the overall prevalence of PNP among patients with lymphoproliferative diseases is extremely low: of the 100,000 cases of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia reported to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, only 12 were found to be associated with PNP [ ]. In studies of patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, the most severe lesions in the course of the PNP occurred 2–3 years following the onset of the lymphoma [ ].
One of the major complications in PNP is BO, often leading to respiratory failure and death. The respiratory involvement is usually irreversible despite aggressive immunosuppressive therapy [ , , ]. In the largest study cohort of PNP patients to date, the prevalence of BO was estimated at 19.2%, with only 20% of these patients surviving by the end of the follow-up period [ ]. In a smaller study of 17 PNP patients, BO was reported in only 17.6% [ ]. Conversely, a strikingly high prevalence of 92.8% was reported among 28 patients with Castleman’s disease-associated PNP, with 84.6% fatality among these patients [ ]. The recently discovered autoantigen epiplakin, known to be expressed in the respiratory bronchiole, was correlated with an increased risk for BO in Japanese patients. Mice injected with anti-epiplakin autoantibodies showed histopathologic changes in pulmonary epithelia, suggesting that it may represent a specific autoantigen in PNP-related BO [ ]. Although the pathomechanism of the respiratory failure in PNP is not fully established, it was attributed to autoantibody-mediated injury of the bronchial epithelium, leading to the plugging of terminal alveoli and causing airflow obstruction and ventilation-perfusion impairment [ ].
Pemphigus herpetiformis
PH is a rare variant of pemphigus that resembles dermatitis herpetiformis clinically, but has the histological and immunopathological features of pemphigus. It was described by Jablonska et al. in 1975 [ ], although it had originally been reported since 1955 under other terms, such as “dermatitis herpetiformis with acantholysis” and “mixed bullous disease.” Diagnosis of PH is established in patients presenting with a clinical appearance compatible with dermatitis herpetiformis and with superficial intraepithelial intercellular IgG and C3 deposits on direct immunoflouresence [ , ]. Indirect immunoflouresence microscopy utilizing several epithelial substrates usually demonstrates intercellular binding of IgG. ELISA immunoassay reveals reactivity against desmoglein 1 more often than against desmoglein 3, implicating an autoimmune process closer to PF than to PV (this can be also concluded from the superficial deposition of immunoreactants in direct immunofluorescence microscopy) [ ]. However, there seems to be a consensus in the literature on the consideration of PH as a distinct variant of pemphigus, owing to its clinical peculiarity, indolent course, and distinct histological analysis [ , ].
The clinical presentation is usually similar to dermatitis herpetiformis, with polymorphous rash with erythematous, gyrate, papular, vesicular, or bullous lesions frequently in an annular-shaped pattern, imitating other autoimmune bullous diseases, such as IgA pemphigus and linear IgA bullous dermatosis [ ]. A predilection for the trunk and proximal extremities was reported [ ]. Severe pruritus is frequently associated and mucosal surfaces are usually spared [ , ].
Epidemiology
More than 100 cases of PH have been reported since its initial description [ ]. In an Italian study of 84 consecutive patients diagnosed with pemphigus, the prevalence of PH was estimated at 6% across 13.5 years of follow-up [ ]. The age range of reported cases extended from 5 to 92 years [ ], with the majority of patients presenting in the fifth and sixth decades. Four cases had been reported among pediatric patients [ , , ]. PH cases had been reported from different regions worldwide, without a prominent ethnic predisposition. Four case series of PH have been reported to date. Fifteen polish PH patients with an average of 60.1 years and equal sex distribution had been reported in 1987 [ ]. Santi et al. [ ] described 7 patients in Brazil with a mean age of 54.7 years and without sex predilection. In a Tunisian case series, 7 female patients with a mean age of 28.1 years had been reported [ ]. The young age of presentation among Tunisians accords with that reported in Arab and Mediterranean patients with other forms of pemphigus [ , , ]. The fourth series originated from Canada and included 8 patients with varied ancestry (Caucasians, Asians, and one Greek) in which the mean age of presentation was 53.4 years with no apparent sex predilection [ ].
Mortality
Although the mortality of PH was not investigated systematically in the past, it is considered to be less life-threatening than other types of pemphigus and has a generally indolent course and favorable prognosis. However, progression to PV has been reported in several patients, requiring more intense management [ , ]. While a good response to monotherapy with dapsone (100–300 mg daily) is usually achieved, a combination treatment with low doses of systemic corticosteroids may sometimes be warranted [ ].
Comorbidities
Due to the rarity of the disease and the small number of patients available for study, observational studies are severely limited. Our knowledge about comorbidities arises mainly from anecdotal case reports that may reflect simple coincidence rather than a true association. Several cases of PH have been reported in conjunction with solid malignancies of the lung [ , ], esophagus [ ], and prostate [ ], as well as with angiosarcoma [ ].
A coexistence of PH with psoriasis [ , ], systemic lupus erythematosus [ ], autoimmune hemolytic anemia [ ], and HIV infection [ ] has also been reported in individual patients. The development of PH subsequent to ultraviolet irradiation therapy [ ] and the intake of penicillamine [ , ] and thiopronine [ ] have also been described.
IgA pemphigus
IgA pemphigus is a rare and distinct type of pemphigus, characterized by circulating and tissue-bound IgA antibodies targeting desmosomal or nondesmosomal cell surface antigens in the epidermis. The characteristic clinical manifestation includes pustules, erosions, or crusts at the margins of erythematous annular or configurative plaques [ ], with a predilection for the trunk, proximal extremities, and intertriginous regions [ , ]. The distinguishing histopathological picture consists of slight epidermal acantholysis and widespread neutrophilic infiltration in either the whole epidermis or in the uppermost section [ ]. In most cases, there are epidermal cell surface tissue-bound IgA autoantibodies detectable by direct immunofluorescence or circulating IgA autoantibodies detectable by immunoserological assays [ ].
IgA pemphigus is subdivided into two subtypes in accordance with the histopathological and immunological features: (1) intraepidermal neutrophilic IgA dermatosis type (IEN type), whose target autoantigen remains to be fully elucidated (most likely a nondesmosomal cell surface protein); and (2) subcorneal pustular dermatosis type (SPD type), whose target antigen is desmocollin 1 [ ]. Histopathologically, the two subtypes can be differentiated by the location of the clefts and pustules: while the SPD type is characterized by subcorneal pustules, the IEN type is characterized by clefts and pustules localized in the lower or entire epidermis [ , ].
Epidemiology
IgA pemphigus is a highly rare entity, with no more than 70 reported cases as of 2010 [ ]. Since IgA pemphigus is a newly proposed disease with a prominent paucity of large case series, its epidemiological features have yet to be established. There is no evidence for ethnic predisposition, as cases were reported from all over the world [ ]. A slight female predominance was reported among 28 cases, with a female to male ratio of 1.3. The age range spanned from 1 month to 85 years [ , , ].
Mortality
Prognosis and mortality of patients with IgA pemphigus has not yet been characterized, due to both the rarity of the disease and the fact that it is a newly described entity. However, it is accepted that the clinical phenotype of IgA pemphigus is much milder than that of classic pemphigus [ ]. The main determinants of the prognosis are the side effects caused by corticosteroids and adjuvant immunosuppressants, rather than the activity of the disease itself [ ].
Comorbidities
Hematological malignancies were reported in association with IgA pemphigus, particularly with the SPD type [ ]. In a review of 29 cases, Wallach [ ] found that 6 (20.7%) had associated monoclonal IgA gammopathy, with the majority of these patients having ĸ- light chains. It is noteworthy that in 2 of these 6 patients, the monoclonal gammopathy developed several years after the onset of IgA pemphigus [ ]. In the same review, 1 patient (3.4%) had a B-cell lymphoma and 2 patients (6.9%) had multiple myeloma [ ].
The coexistence of IgA pemphigus with the following comorbidities was reported sporadically in individuals: ulcerative colitis [ , , ], lung cancer [ , ], and linear IgA bullous dermatosis [ ].
Distribution of the variants of pemphigus in different cohorts across the world
The distribution of the different variants of pemphigus varies substantially in different cohorts reported worldwide. Apart from countries where PF is considered an endemic disease (Brazil [ ], southern Tunisia [ ], and Mali [ ]), PV was the leading variant in all the remaining study cohorts (Fig. 1 ). The prevalence of PV ranged from 94.7% in Saudi Arabia [ ] to 16.7% in Mali [ ], with prominently high rates among Israeli [ , ] and Iranian pemphigus patients. This observation is in accord with the ethnic predisposition for PV in these populations [ , ]. Meanwhile, the prevalence of PF was 5.3 and 6.4% in Saudi Arabia [ ] and Israel [ ], respectively, and 83.3% in Mali [ ] (Fig. 1 ). It is notable that an increasing trend in the incidence of PV was recently reported in southeastern Brazil, a region endemic for fogo selvagem [ , ]. The prevalence of the newly described variants was much lower in the reported cohorts. Of note, 6% of the 84 patients with pemphigus reported in southern Italy had PH [ ] (Fig. 1 ).

Conclusions
The epidemiology of pemphigus varies significantly worldwide. A decreasing trend was observed in the mortality rates of patients with pemphigus. However, it remains higher than expected for the general population. This group of diseases has been linked to a wide range of comorbidities, with only several associations being established based on well-performed observational studies (Table 2 ).
