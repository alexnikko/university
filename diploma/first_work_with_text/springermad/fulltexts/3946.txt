Introduction
Identification of the antibacterial properties of sulfonamides and penicillin prior to World War II marked the introduction of perhaps the most influential group of clinically useful drugs in history. Academic scientists and pharmaceutical companies devoted decades to screening soil samples and naturally-occurring sources for the next class of antibiotics. However, as was soon realized, identification of a new antibiotic was soon followed by reports of resistance to that agent, often before the drug was approved by the regulatory agencies to be marketed (Fig. 1 ). Fig. 1 Rapid development of resistance associated with the introduction of new antibacterial agents. Resistance dates in red indicate that resistance was reported before, or at the same time, as the drug was approved for marketing. Note that linezolid is the only agent listed that is not derived from a natural product (Color figure online)
Antibiotic drug discovery and development has languished over the past two decades as large pharmaceutical companies have abandoned the field for more lucrative therapeutic areas [ , ]. Agencies such as the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA), the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have raised alarms about the lack of new drugs as antibiotic resistance increased [ , , , ]. The United States (US) has attempted to address the issue through the passage of the GAIN act (Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now) with its provisions for additional economic incentives for antibiotic development and fast-tracked drug approvals [ ]. As a result of the GAIN act, the FDA can designate new antibacterial agents to treat serious or life-threatening infectious diseases as Qualified Investigational Drug Products (QIDPs), allowing them fast track development with priority review by the FDA ( http://blogs.fda.gov/fdavoice/index.php/tag/qualified-infectious-disease-product-qidp/ or, FDA, Guidance for Industry Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions – Drugs and Biologics, March 2014).The European response has perhaps been more aggressive than the US [ , ], notably through the formation of the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) ND4BB (New Drugs for Bad Bugs) by the European Union to fund public–private partnerships with the intention of accelerating antibiotic drug discovery and development [ ].
In this review, recently approved antibiotics and antibacterial agents in the development pipeline for systemic use will be presented, together with their current development status as of July 2016 as listed on company websites or the website https://clinicaltrials.gov/ . Mechanisms of action will be discussed, as well as the emergence of resistance to these agents. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic considerations will also be examined in light of newer approaches to these issues. For those agents whose discovery and spectrum of activity have been described in previous review articles [ , , , ], only a brief description of their antibacterial properties will be presented and the discussion will focus on information published or presented in the time frame from 2014–2016.
Recently approved antibacterial drugs
β-Lactamase inhibitor combinations
Ceftolozane–tazobactam
Ceftolozane is a potent anti-pseudomonal drug that is combined with the widely-used β-lactamase inhibitor (BLI) tazobactam (Fig. 2 ), originally developed in combination with the antipseudomonal ureidopenicillin, piperacillin. Like other β-lactams, ceftolozane functions by binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), transpeptidases responsible for the final biosynthetic steps of cell wall biosynthesis [ ]. Ceftolozane, which was not developed as a stand-alone cephalosporin, has intrinsic antibacterial activity against enteric bacteria and P. aeruginosa [ ]. It is labile to hydrolysis by many β-lactamases, including the carbapenemases (class A and class B) and some class A extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs), thus requiring the addition of a BLI for broad-spectrum coverage of enteric bacteria [ ]. Tazobactam in combination with ceftolozane inhibits bacteria producing the more common penicillinases and class A CTX-M enzymes that represent the most common ESBLs [ , ]. After development by groups at Calixa and Cubist Pharmaceuticals [ ], Zerbaxa ® (ceftolozane–tazobactam) was approved as a QIDP by the FDA in December, 2014, and is now being marketed by Merck for treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI), including pyelonephritis, and for treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) when used in combination with metronidazole [ ]. Fig. 2 Structures of recently approved cephalosporin-β-lactamase inhibitor combinations
Ceftazidime–avibactam
Ceftazidime is an expanded-spectrum oxyimino-cephalosporin (Fig. 2 ) that has been used since the mid-1980s to treat infections caused by enteric bacteria and P. aeruginosa . As a result of its widespread use, β-lactamase-mediated resistance has become increasingly common [ ], frequently as a result of production of ESBLs, carbapenemases or derepressed AmpC cephalosporinases [ ]. The bridged diazabicyclooctane (DBO) avibactam first investigated by Novexel scientists (Fig. 2 ) represents a new class of non-β-lactam BLI with a novel mechanism of action. Its spectrum of inhibitory activity includes class A β-lactamases including serine carbapenemases, class C cephalosporinases and some class D β-lactamases [ ]. In contrast to the irreversible suicide inactivators tazobactam and clavulanic acid, avibactam rapidly and reversibly acylates the active site serine in class A, class C and selected class D β-lactamases, with subsequent slow release of the intact inhibitor by most β-lactamases [ , ]. Primarily on the basis of Phase 2 data, the QIDP ceftazidime–avibactam combination (Avycaz ® in the US) was approved in early 2015 to “treat adults with cIAI, in combination with metronidazole, and cUTI, including kidney infections (pyelonephritis), who have limited or no alternative treatment options” [ ]. The combination received full Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in June 2016 for the treatment of cUTI and cIAI (together with metronidazole) in patients with infections due to ceftazidime–nonsusceptible β-lactamase-producing pathogens [ ]. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has also recommended approval of ceftazidime–avibactam (Zavicefta ® in Europe) for the same indications [ ]. Development of the combination was under the direction of Allergan (Forest/Actavis) in the US and AstraZeneca outside the US.
Antibacterial drugs in clinical development
β-Lactams
Three siderophore-containing β-lactams have entered human clinical trials. A Phase 1 trial for the cephalosporin GSK3342830, selected as a lead from the Shionogi-GSK joint discovery program on siderophore-conjugated molecules, has been registered ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/ ), but no details of activity or structure are available. The dihydroxypyridone-substituted monosulfactam BAL30072 from Basilea has completed Phase 1 trials. The 3-catechol-substituted cephalosporin S-649266 from Shionogi (Fig. 3 ), selected as a lead from the Shionogi-GSK joint discovery program, has completed Phase 2 clinical studies. BAL30072 and S-649266 have enhanced activity against Gram-negative organisms due to their iron-chelating abilities that allow entry through the iron-siderophore uptake system [ , ]. BAL30072 has a broad spectrum of activity against many Gram-negative pathogens, including P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. Like other monocyclic β-lactams, it is not inactivated by class B metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs), but is subject to hydrolysis by some class A ESBLs, or AmpC cephalosporinases when overexpressed [ ]. A BAL30072 combination with meropenem has been described to provide coverage of β-lactamase-producing multidrug-resistant (MDR) enteric bacteria [ , ], but the combination is not currently under development ( http://www.basilea.com/Portfolio/Portfolio/ , accessed 10 January 2017). S-649266 also has a broad spectrum of activity that includes many β-lactamase-producing Gram-negative pathogens, including enteric and non-fermentative bacteria with carbapenemases [ , , ]. The cephalosporin exhibits potent antibacterial activity with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ≤2 μg/ml against meropenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae with both serine carbapenemases and MBLs [ ]. Although early siderophore-containing β-lactams rapidly selected for mutations in iron transport proteins [ , ], BAL30072 and S-649266 tend to have lower frequencies of resistance selection [ , ] (see below). Fig. 3 Structures of siderophore-containing β-lactams
β-Lactamase inhibitors and β-lactamase inhibitor combinations
Two carbapenem–BLI combinations are currently in Phase 3 clinical trials, imipenem (with cilastatin) in combination with the DBO relebactam from Merck and meropenem in combination with vaborbactam, a novel boronic acid BLI from The Medicines Company (Fig. 4 ). Like avibactam, relebactam is a potent inhibitor of class A and class C β-lactamases, with notable inhibitory activity against KPC and other serine carbapenemases and no inhibition of class B MBLs, but with reduced inhibitory activity against class D OXA enzymes [ , ]. Relebactam restores susceptibility to imipenem in many carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and P. aeruginosa, but not Acinetobacter spp. [ , ]. Vaborbactam, currently the only boronic acid BLI in clinical trials, is a selective inhibitor of serine carbapenemases, but not mammalian serine proteases [ ]. It is being developed in combination with meropenem in order to capitalize upon the vaborbactam inhibitory activity against KPC carbapenemases in enteric bacteria, and the meropenem antimicrobial activity against P. aeruginosa [ ]. Fig. 4 a , b Structures of β-lactamase inhibitors and identified accompanying β-lactam partners
Two avibactam combinations are currently in Phase 2 clinical development, ceftaroline–avibactam and aztreonam–avibactam, developed by Allergan in the US and AstraZeneca outside the US (Fig. 4 ). Both combinations offer the same broad spectrum inhibitory activity against enteric bacteria as seen in the ceftazidime–avibactam combination [ , ]. The addition of avibactam to ceftaroline, an anti-MRSA cephalosporin, extends the potent anti-staphylococcal activity of ceftaroline to encompass MDR enteric bacteria [ ] by overcoming β-lactamase-mediated resistance, but does not achieve useful activity against non-fermenters. Ceftaroline-avibactam has been studied in Phase 2 clinical trials in the US for the treatment of cUTI. An aztreonam-avibactam combination is currently under development under the auspices of the IMI ND4BB program in Europe and the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) in the US [ ]. The antibacterial spectrum of the aztreonam-avibactam combination parallels that of ceftazidime–avibactam, with two notable exceptions. The anti-pseudomonal activity of the aztreonam combination is not as potent as ceftazidime–avibactam [ ], but it is effective against MBL-producing enteric bacteria due to the inherent stability of the monocyclic β-lactams to MBL hydrolysis [ ].
BLIs that have entered or completed Phase 1 clinical trials include RG6080 (formerly OP0595 from Meiji/Fedora), a DBO being developed by Roche with an unannounced β-lactam partner; the penicillanic acid sulfone AAI101 from Allecra in combination with cefepime; and the DBO zidebactam (WCK 5107) from Wockhardt also being developed in combination with cefepime (Fig. 4 ). The DBOs RG6080 and zidebactam share similar unusual multi-targeted approaches. Like avibactam they have potent enzyme inhibitory activity against class A, C and some class D β-lactamases [ , ]. Additionally, they have inherent antibacterial activity on their own, through high affinity binding to PBP2 in MDR Gram-negative bacteria, including P. aeruginosa [ ]. Finally, they appear to have a currently unexplained enhancer activity that extends the activity of the DBO to potentiate the antibacterial activity of the accompanying β-lactam in the absence of β-lactamases [ , ]. AAI101 in combination with cefepime demonstrated modest activity in restoring the activity of cefepime in a collection of cefepime-non-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae, with the cefepime MIC 50 /MIC 90 values lowered to 0.12/0.5 μg/ml from >64 μg/ml against ESBL-producing isolates [ ]. In addition, Wockhardt is developing the clinically proven agents, cefepime with tazobactam, in a combination called WCK 4282, using high dose regimens of cefepime [ ]. The combination, when tested in vitro with 8 μg/ml of tazobactam in contrast to the usual 4 μg/ml, demonstrated small improvements in cefepime activity against ESBL-producing enteric bacteria. Small enhancements of activity were observed against KPC-carbapenemase-producing strains when serum was present in the testing medium, with cefepime susceptibility at 37% for K. pneumoniae [ ].
Two preclinical BLIs with intriguing activity against Acinetobacter include the DBO WCK 4234 and the rationally designed diazabicyclooctenone ETX2514 (Fig. 4 ). WCK 4234 from Wockhardt, to be partnered with meropenem, has potent inhibitory activity against class A, class C and many class D β-lactamases, including OXA carbapenemases found frequently in Acinetobacter spp. [ ]. ETX2514, a DBO analog from Entasis, also has similar β-lactamase inhibitory activity against class A, class C and class D enzymes, and exhibits binding to PBPs 1a, 2 and 3 in both P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. [ ]. In vitro testing showed greatest synergistic activity with imipenem against P. aeruginosa, but with sulbactam against Acinetobacter .
Agents active on the cell wall or cell membrane
TD-1792, a glycopeptide-cephalosporin hybrid antibiotic from Theravance (Fig. 5 ), has potent antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, specifically targeting MDR staphylococci with MICs < 0.06 μg/ml [ ]. R-Pharm in partnership with Theravance is currently conducting a Phase 3 clinical trial in complicated skin infections [ ]. Two agents with activity directed against the cell wall or cell membrane in Phase 2 clinical development include murepavadin (POL7080) from Polyphor [Drug Spider, http://drugspider.com/drug/murepavadin ], and brilacidin from Cellceutix (originating from PolyMedix), (Fig. 5 ). Murepavadin (POL7080), a peptidomimetic agent which targets the LptD protein involved in LPS biosynthesis specifically in P. aeruginosa [ , ], was in Phase 2 clinical studies in patients with Ventilator Associated Pneumonia (VAP) caused by P. aeruginosa , but the trial was terminated in June 2016 ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/ ). Brilacidin, another peptidomimetic, causes membrane depolarization in Staphylococcus aureus [ ]. It has completed Phase 2 studies as a systemic agent to treat serious staphylococcal skin infections and is currently in Phase 2 studies as an oral rinse to attenuate oral mucositis in patients being treated for head and neck cancers ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/ ). A second glycopeptide-cephalosporin heterodimer from Theravance, TD-1607, structurally different from TD-1792 but with similar microbiological properties [ ], has completed Phase 1 single and multiple ascending dose studies in humans ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/ ). Late preclinical polymyxin analogs were recently described as potential colistin replacements: SPR741, a novel cationic peptide from SperoTherapeutics being developed as a potentiator of antibiotic activity in MDR Gram-negative bacteria [ ], and FADDI-287, a less nephrotoxic polymyxin from The Medicines Company [ ]. FADDI-287 had greater potency than colistin against P. aeruginosa , carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii , and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, but was cross-resistant to colistin [ ]. Fig. 5 Structures of agents interfering with the cell wall or cell membrane
Inhibitors of RNA/DNA synthesis
Two novel inhibitors of DNA gyrase are currently in Phase 2 development. ETX0914 (Fig. 6 a), being developed by Entasis Therapeutics Inc., belongs to a new class of spiropyrimidinetrione-based inhibitors of DNA gyrase [ ]. It lacks activity against resistant Gram-negative ESKAPE pathogens but is active against fluoroquinolone-, and ceftriaxone-resistant Neisseria gonorrheae [ ]. Gepotidacin (GSK2140944), a triazaacenaphthylene DNA gyrase inhibitor (Fig. 6 a) from GlaxoSmithKline with in vivo activity against MRSA [ ] is also being targeted against drug-resistant N. gonorrheae [ , , ]. In Phase 1 studies is TNP-2092 from Tennor Therapeutics, a hybrid dual action rifamycin-quinolizinone (Fig. 6 a) with activity against gastrointestinal pathogens, including H. pylori and C. difficile due to inhibitory activity against RNA polymerase, DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV [ ]. Fig. 6 a Structures of non-quinolone inhibitors of DNA or RNA synthesis; b structures of quinolones that inhibit DNA synthesis
Several (fluoro)quinolones are in the clinical development pipeline (Fig. 6 b). WCK 2349 is an orally bioavailable form of WCK771, which is an arginine salt of the active isomer of nadifloxacin [ ], and has entered phase 2 clinical trials under development by Wockhardt Ltd. It is not expected to have significant activity against resistant Gram-negative pathogens, or any of the CDC urgent threat pathogens. Finafloxacin [ ] is in phase 2 trials, and is being developed by MerLion Pharmaceuticals Pte Ltd for systemic use in the treatment of cUTI, acute pyelonephritis, cIAI, acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections [ ]. An otic suspension formulation was approved by the USA FDA for the treatment of acute otitis externa [ ]. Finafloxacin has the potential for improved activity in acidic environments and has a potential spectrum encompassing some resistant Gram-negative ESKAPE pathogens [ ]. Nemonoxacin [ ] is in phase 3 development by TaiGen Biotechnology Co. Ltd for use in treatment of CABP, diabetic foot infection, and ABSSSI. It has been already approved for treatment of CABP in Taiwan. It is not expected to have significant activity against resistant Gram-negative pathogens, or any of the CDC urgent threat pathogens. Zabofloxacin [ ] is in phase 3 development by Dong Wha Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd for community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. It is not expected to have significant activity against resistant Gram-negative pathogens, or any of the CDC urgent threat pathogens. Lascufloxacin (KRP-AM1977X) is entering phase 3 clinical development by Kyorin Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., and is being studied as both oral and IV dosing [ , ] for respiratory infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria, including MRSA. Delafloxacin [ ] has completed phase 3 development by Melinta Therapeutics Inc. for ABSSSI, CABP and cUTI. It has been reported to show some activity against resistant Gram-negative ESKAPE pathogens, and some of the CDC urgent threat pathogens.
Metabolism inhibitors
Two novel, selective enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase ( Fab I) inhibitors with antibacterial activity only against S. aureus including MRSA have entered clinical development (Fig. 7 ). Debio 1450 (a prodrug of AFN-1252 from Affinium), as described in previous reviews [ , ], is now being developed by Debio with both oral and intravenous (IV) formulations for Phase 2. Debio 1450 with a QIDP/Fast Track designation by the US FDA, successfully completed a Phase 2 trial for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) caused by staphylococci [ ] and is currently being studied for the treatment of staphylococcal ABSSSI ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/ ). CG-400549, a FabI inhibitor from Crystal Genomics [ ], completed a Phase 2 clinical study in 2012 for treatment of patients with cABSSSI (major cutaneous abscesses) due to MRSA ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/ ) ( http://www.crystalgenomics.com/en/clinical/main.html ). Fig. 7 Structures of metabolism inhibitors
Iclaprim (Fig. 7 ), a novel inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase, was originally discovered by Hoffman-La Roche scientists and then licensed for development to Arpida. It has particularly potent antibacterial activity against Gram-positive pathogens, including trimethoprim-resistant isolates, as well as against respiratory pathogens such as Haemophilus influenzae and Chlamydia pneumoniae [ ]. Drug development was discontinued in 2008 after the FDA did not approve it for the treatment of complicated skin infections, due to its failure to demonstrate statistical non-inferiority [ , ]. It is currently under development by Motif Bio ( http://www.motifbio.com/iclaprim/ ) in two Phase 3 trials for the treatment of cABSSSI ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/ ).
Inhibitors of protein synthesis
Five protein synthesis inhibitors from traditional antibiotic classes have reached late Phase 3 clinical development (Fig. 8 a): the fluoroketolide solithromycin and the fusidane fusidic acid developed by Cempra, the aminoglycoside plazomicin under development by Achaogen, and two tetracyclines, omadacycline from Paratek and eravacycline from Tetraphase. Solithromycin, like other ketolides, has potent antibacterial activity against streptococci, Neisseria gonorrhoeae , the Gram-negative respiratory pathogens H. influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis , and atypical bacteria including Legionella pneumophila and C. pneumoniae [ , ]. It is being studied for the treatment of community acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP). Fusidic acid is an oral antibiotic that has been used for many years outside the US to treat staphylococcal infections. It is currently in Phase 3 clinical trials in the US to treat complicated skin infections and staphylococcal bone and joint infections ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/ ). Plazomicin, a novel aminoglycoside with potent activity against enteric bacteria and Acinetobacter spp., was optimized to avoid plasmid-encoded aminoglycoside modifying enzymes. Phase 3 clinical trials are in progress for treatment of cUTI and for patients infected with CRE ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/ ). Omadacycline and eravacycline are structurally related to the glycylcycline tigecycline, with a similar spectrum of activity [ [ ], [ ] ]. Against enteric bacteria, eravacycline often exhibits 2-fold higher potency than tigecycline, whereas omadacycline tends to be less potent [ , ]. None of these agents has useful anti-pseudomonal activity. However, plazomicin and eravacycline all demonstrate consistent activity against carbapenemase-producing CRE [ , , ], and, together with omadacycline, have received designation as QIDPs with Fast Track status and eligibility for expedited approvals [ ]. Eravacycline, which completed a successful Phase 3 trial in cIAI as IV therapy, did not meet its primary endpoint of statistical non-inferiority compared to levofloxacin in a pivotal cUTI study with IV and step-down oral therapy [ , , ]; a second cUTI study with IV dosing only has been initiated [ ]. More complete descriptions of the mechanisms, antimicrobial spectra and resistance mechanisms for the Phase 3 protein synthesis inhibitors have been described previously [ [ ], [ ] ]. The most unusual protein synthesis inhibitor in Phase 3 trials is lefamulin (formerly BC-3781), a pleuromutilin under development by Nabriva, primarily targeted against Gram-positive bacteria, but with activity against Gram-negative respiratory pathogens [ , , ]. It is currently in Phase 3 trials to treat CABP ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/ ), with intentions to develop it for both oral and IV dosing [ http://www.nabriva.com/programs/development/ ]. Fig. 8 a Structures of protein synthesis inhibitors in late stage development; b structures of protein synthesis inhibitors in Phase 1 or 2
Earlier development protein synthesis inhibitors include the oxazolidinones MRX-1 from MicuRx that has completed Phase 2 studies, and LCB01-0371 from LegoChem that has completed Phase 1 evaluations but that does not appear to be progressing into later development ( http://www.legochembio.com/en/sub2_3.php?PageNum=2&subNum=3 ). Like other oxazolidinones, these agents target primarily Gram-positive bacteria [ ]. The tetracycline-derived agents TP-271 from Tetraphase (Fig. 8 b) and KBP-7072 from KBP Biosciences (Fig. 5 ) are currently in Phase 1 clinical trials ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/ ); ( http://www.kbpbiosciences.com/pipeline/ ). TP-271 has MIC 90 values ≤1 μg/ml against sensitive and resistant Gram-positive bacteria including MRSA and Enterococcus faecium , respiratory Gram-negative pathogens, and Acinetobacter spp. [ ] It is being developed to treat respiratory diseases such as CABP and infections caused by biothreat pathogens with the support of the National Institutes of Health’s (NIH) National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID); it has received QIDP and Fast Track designations [ ]. KBP-7072 is claimed to have antibacterial activity against MDR Gram-positive bacteria, anaerobic pathogens and Acinetobacter spp. ( http://www.kbpbiosciences.com/pipeline/ ). The pleuromutilin BC-7013 (Fig. 8 b) from Nabriva has activity against Gram-positive organisms, and is reported to be in Phase 1 clinical trials as a topical treatment for skin infections [ ]; ( http://www.nabriva.com/programs/development/ ). Finally, nafithromycin (WCK4873) from Wockhardt, a lactone ketolide (Fig. 8 b) with potent activity against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), streptococci and other key respiratory pathogens [ ], has completed dose-ranging Phase 1 clinical studies [ ].
Resistance mechanisms for pipeline drugs
Resistance to new β-lactam-containing agents or BLIs
Traditionally, resistance to the β-lactam antibiotics in Gram-positive bacteria has been due to the production or acquisition of low affinity PBPs [ ], with contributions from penicillinases in the staphylococci [ ]. In Gram-negative bacteria, the most common cause for β-lactam resistance is production of β-lactamases [ ], either chromosomally encoded or encoded on genes found on transferable elements such as plasmids or integrons [ ]. Overexpression of chromosomal enzymes is frequently associated with decreased penetration or increased efflux, resulting in a dual resistance mechanism [ , ]. For transferable β-lactamases, perhaps most worrisome is the ability of bla -encoding genes to accumulate on plasmids that acquire multiple β-lactamase genes in addition to other antibiotic resistance determinants [ ]. Among the acquired β-lactamases, mutational changes frequently emerge as the result of single nucleotide polymorphisms in β-lactamase genes, resulting in altered biochemical functions of the enzyme. Currently there are more than 2100 unique β-lactamases with varied functional properties [Bush, personal communication].
Resistance to older BLIs was often due to overexpression of the target β-lactamase, mutations in the common TEM or SHV enzymes, or to production of multiple β-lactamases that competed for the finite (inadequate) amount of inhibitor present [ ]. For ceftazidime–avibactam, as well as for all current BLI combinations excluding those with a monobactam, production of MBLs results in intrinsic resistance in clinical isolates [ ]. In native populations of P. aeruginosa , resistance to the inhibitor combinations is most commonly due to penetrability and compound-specific efflux [ ]; as a result, cross resistance is not always observed between ceftazidime–avibactam and ceftolozane–tazobactam [ ]. An unusual resistance mechanism for aztreonam-avibactam was identified in a set of naturally-occurring E. coli isolates with the NDM-1 MBL; a four amino acid insertion sequence in PBP3 resulted in broad-spectrum resistance to the β-lactams that bind to PBP3 as their primary killing target, but not to other antibiotics [ ].
Resistance to the newer BLI combinations has been studied primarily in the laboratory, due to the limited clinical usage of these agents. Using ceftazidime–avibactam, selection of resistance in KPC-3-producing enteric bacteria resulted in alterations of the Ω-loop, either as a result of point mutations or insertions immediately preceding the loop [ , ]; similar selection in AmpC-hyperproducing P. aeruginosa resulted in deletions in the Ω-loop [ ]. Resistance in vitro to the ceftolozane–tazobactam combination in P. aeruginosa has been associated with hyperproduction of the pseudomonal AmpC cephalosporinase, resulting in cross-resistance to other antipseudomonal cephalosporins [ , ]. To determine how AmpC molecular variations could affect ceftolozane activity, 20 AmpC alleles were inserted into an AmpC-negative P. aeruginosa strain; ceftolozane MICs increased as much as 64-fold as a result of mutations in the Ω-loop, the R2 domain and the C-terminal end of the protein [ ]. In a second study, high level ceftolozane resistance (MICs > 16 μg/ml) required selection in a mismatch-repair-deficient (Δ mutS ) mutator derivative of P. aeruginosa PA01, resulting in a large fitness cost [ ].
Clinical resistance to the BLI combinations has been reported in KPC-2 carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae isolates with elevated ceftazidime–avibactam MICs in strains with both ESBLs and porin mutations [ , ]. A resistant K. pneumoniae isolate with a ceftazidime–avibactam MIC > 32/4 μg/ml contained multiple resistance factors including two carbapenemases, KPC-2 as well as the MBL VIM-4, the cephalosporinase CMY-2, together with TEM, and SHV β-lactamases, in addition to an overexpressed AcrAB-TolC efflux pump and reduced expression of the OmpK35- and OmpK37 porins, providing a logical explanation for high level resistance [ ]. In a recent study of 16 patients with infections caused by ceftolozane–tazobactam-susceptible P. aeruginosa , resistance to the combination was reported in three of the seven isolates recovered from patients who failed therapy, with ceftolozane–tazobactam MICs as high as >256/4 μg/ml [ ];the resistance mechanism was not defined.
Plasmid-encoded resistance for other classes
Plasmid-encoded resistance to new antibiotics is less important than for the β-lactams and for the BLI combinations, with a few exceptions. Resistance to protein synthesis inhibitors includes ribosomal protection, reduced penetration, target mutations and efflux mechanisms that are most commonly chromosomally encoded [ ]. For quinolones and topoisomerase inhibitors, first step mutations in one or two target enzymes, DNA gyrase and DNA topoisomerase IV, represent the primary resistance mechanisms, although plasmid encoded genes, such as those in the qnr family or genes encoding efflux pumps, also contribute to the resistance profile [ ]. For the new aminoglycoside plazomicin, resistance has been virtually avoided in terms of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes [ ], but was reported in an early study of carbapenemase-producing isolates; in organisms producing the NDM-1 MBL; high resistance to plazomicin was identified due to production of 16S rRNA methyltransferases [ ]. For the cell wall/cell membrane agents in the polymyxin family, a novel plasmid encoded mcr - 1 gene conferring resistance to the polymyxin family via a member of the phosphoethanolamine transferase enzyme family raised many concerns when it was identified in 2015 [ ] Although chromosomally mediated colistin resistance had been known for some time, transferable polymyxin resistance arising from animals in the food chain had now been detected in human pathogens. The fear is that this gene will migrate into MDR isolates that will no longer be treatable by any currently approved antibiotic. It is not clear whether any of the new polymyxin analogs will be able to overcome this resistance.
Outer membrane role in Gram-negative resistance
The defining characteristic of Gram-negative bacteria is provided by the outer membrane which acts as barrier to antibiotics and confers a varying degree of resistance according to the details of its composition [ , , ]. The outer membrane is comprised of an outer leaflet formed from lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and an inner leaflet that is more usual bacterial phospholipids, reflecting the composition of the cytoplasmic membrane. LPS is comprised of three parts: the O-antigen polysaccharide, the core saccharide and lipid A. The long glycan chains of the O-antigen may contribute to the formation of unstirred layers that limit the diffusion of solutes close to the outer membrane, for mutant strains that are defective in the synthesis of the O-antigen have increased susceptibility towards exposure to antibiotics [ , , , ]. The core saccharide has two domains [ ]: the inner core, comprising 3-deoxy- d -manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (KDO) and l -glycero- d -manno-heptose (HEP) units, and the outer core comprising mostly hexoses. Only the KDO units of the inner core are essential for bacterial growth but mutants with a “deep-rough” phenotype, lacking the HEP units, have a hyperpermeable outer membrane, exhibiting increased susceptibility towards antibiotics such as erythromycin, novobiocin and rifampicin [ , ]. Lipid A is essential for bacterial growth and mutant strains with a defect in lipid A biosynthesis are hypersensitive to some antibiotics [ , , ]. Acquired resistance mediated through LPS is usually the result of modifications made to LPS that decrease its negative charge. Polymyxin B-resistant strains of Gram-negative bacteria usually become so through acquisition of mutations in the PmrA transcription factor, which controls genes encoding the enzymes responsible for modification of lipid A with phosphatidyl ethanolamine or 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose [ , , , ]. Both modifications introduce an additional positive charge (at physiological pH) and therefore presumably serve to decrease the avidity of binding of cationic antibiotics such as the polymyxins.
Porins form water-filled channels through the outer membrane and thereby constitute the most important route by which hydrophilic antibiotics can pass the outer membrane barrier. Their role in restricting the influx of antibiotics and thus contributing to resistance has been described in many organisms [ , , , , ]. There is a delicate interplay between the role of porins, or their absence, and the active extrusion of the antibiotics by efflux pumps [ ]. This is compounded in the case of β-lactams by the active destruction of the antibiotic in the periplasmic space through the action of β-lactamases. When there is a significant decrease in the rate of entry, for example through the loss of a specific porin [ ] or significant extrusion by an efflux pump [ ], relatively modest hydrolytic activity is sufficient to cause high-level resistance [ ]. Understanding the way in which molecules permeate through porins has been a focus of the TRANSLOCATION project of the Innovative Medicines Initiative “New Drugs 4 Bad Bugs” ( https://www.imi.europa.eu/content/translocation ). Studies of the interactions of antibiotics with native and mutant porins have helped to define the ways in which residues that are altered in the resistant mutants contribute to the filtering of antibiotics [ ].
A few natural antibiotics, known collectively as sideromycins, by-pass the porin route of transport and exploit instead the energy-dependent ferric iron uptake systems of Gram-negative bacteria to gain accelerated uptake into the periplasm [ ]. The antibiotics have an antimicrobial warhead conjugated to a ferric iron-binding motif than enables them to be recognized and transported by the outer membrane receptor proteins of the iron uptake systems. Further uptake into the cytoplasm, where the antibiotic moieties should act, is dependent on release of the iron-binding motif and either facilitated or passive diffusion across the cytoplasm. Resistance to these natural antibiotics can occur through deletion of the outer membrane protein, or loss of enzymes essential for release of the antibiotic from the siderophore conjugate. Synthetic approaches based on the sideromycins have been a rich field of experimentation and, as described above, two siderophore conjugated β-lactams (BAL30072 and S-649266) have entered clinical trials [ , ]. Some of the issues that have been encountered in the development of such molecules will be discussed below.
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic index for β-lactams
Ceftazidime is a third-generation cephalosporin that has served as a model compound for the understanding of the relationship between pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of β-lactams in general and in the development of β-lactam/β-inhibitor combinations. A wealth of data from studies in in vitro PK models and animal infection models has shown that the duration of non-protein-bound plasma concentration above the MIC (% f T/MIC) is the PK/PD index that best correlates with the drug-related response, with the MIC usually defined as the breakpoint used to define susceptibility [ ]. With data obtained from a variety of mouse infection models involving both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant bacteria, it was found that bacteriostasis at 24 h was best predicted by a % f T/MIC of 40%, and a % f T/MIC of 60–65% was found to give near-maximal bactericidal effect [ , , ]. These % f T/MIC indices have been used to define clinical breakpoints and as targets to be attained during therapy [ ]. Confirmation of these general targets in human infections has been achieved using retrospective analysis of clinical trial data for ceftazidime [ ] and ceftobiprole [ ]. Risk factors that might lead to failure to achieve the desired PK/PD targets in critically ill patients, and potential measures to ensure proper dosing, have been described [ , ].
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic issues for BLI combinations
When the first BLI combinations of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid or ampicillin-sulbactam were developed, pharmacokinetic (PK) considerations aided appropriate dose selection, but the era of PD as a driver of antibiotic dosing strategies had not yet evolved. Perhaps the first time PD played a role in dose justification was during the development of piperacillin–tazobactam, when it was observed that the tazobactam concentration could fall below a defined threshold as long as sufficiently high concentrations were available to render all the β-lactamases inactive before the next dose [ ]. Current thinking with the new BLI combinations suggests that PK/PD modeling will vary according to the specific BLI and companion β-lactam, as summarized in two recent review articles [ , ]. Updated summaries of the conclusions are discussed below.
Mouse thigh infection models with ceftolozane–tazobactam demonstrated predictable behavior for ceftolozane with PD efficacy indices of 26–32% f T > MIC for stasis and one log 10 killing effects, and threshold concentrations of 0.25 or 0.5 μg/ml for tazobactam (depending upon the amount of β-lactamase was produced by the infecting pathogen) [ , ]. However, recent studies with DBO combinations show that other indices may correspond more closely to efficacy. In a hollow fiber study of imipenem in combination with relebactam, a new PD index was defined as time above instantaneous MIC (T > MIC i ], with MIC i derived from empirical simulations to represent fluctuating imipenem concentrations [ ]. The same combination studied in a mouse thigh infection model showed that %T > MIC was a poor indicator of efficacy and that AUC/MIC (where AUC is the area under the concentration–time curve) was a better predictor of efficacy across bacterial strains [ ]. Hollow fiber studies with avibactam combinations have demonstrated that a threshold effect is most likely the driving factor that determines the efficacy of avibactam when dosed with either ceftazidime or aztreonam [ ]. That threshold was estimated to be 2–2.5 μg/ml for avibactam, whereas a more recent in vitro PK/PD study showed that avibactam at concentrations as low as 1 μg/ml synergized with aztreonam [ ]. As the new inhibitors progress through evaluation and regulatory approvals, PK/PD considerations will continue to be refined to correlate with human PK/PD and clinical responses.
Siderophore issues
Siderophore conjugates of several classes of β-lactam have been investigated exploiting either catechol or its isostere hydroxypyridone as the iron-binding moiety. Recently several compounds have been profiled in pre-clinical development including monocarbams, pursued initially at Squibb (pirazmonam) [ ] and Upjohn (U-78608) [ ], Pfizer (MC-1) [ ] and Astra-Zeneca (e.g. SMC-3176) [ ], monobactams pursued at Pfizer (MB-1) [ ], monosulfactams pursued at Basilea (BAL30072) [ ], and the cephalosporin S-649266 pursued by Shionogi [ , ]. Resistance to monocarbams was acquired in E. coli through loss of TonB or the catecholate receptors Cir and Fiu.47 [ ]. Loss of the receptors PiuA and PirA has been reported to lead to loss of in vivo efficacy for MC-1 in P. aeruginosa [ ], with loss of PiuA alone sufficient to cause loss of in vitro activity in iron-replete medium. A number of genes involved in iron-uptake, including piuA , piuC , pirR , fecI , and pvdS were found to be mutated in strains with acquired resistance towards SMC-3176 [ ]. The fecI gene was also found to be mutated after selection with BAL30072 in unphysiological iron-replete growth medium, but no genes involved in iron-uptake were affected when the selection was performed in more physiological medium with iron-limitation [ ]. The mutation in the fecI gene results in up-regulation of the ferric-citrate transport system and consequent down-regulation of other iron-transport systems including PiuA and PirA. Profiling of MB-1 suggested that the native siderophores could complete with the synthetic siderophore-conjugate, decreasing its efficacy in some models [ , ]. However, no correlation between siderophore production and MIC of BAL30072 in iron-limited growth medium was observed [ ]. Both MB-1 and SMC-3176 were reported to exhibit unpredictable efficacy in neutropenic mouse models of P. aeruginosa infection [ , ]. A study of the PK/PD relationship of SMC-3176 in the neutropenic mouse thigh model for five strains of P. aeruginosa showed predictable effects with efficacy for four of the isolates corresponding to the f T > MIC using the MIC determined in iron-depleted growth medium [ ]. The response to SMC-3176 against the fifth strain was inconsistent with f T > MIC exposures and implied a threshold concentration that was greater than the MIC. Both the Pfizer [ ] and Astra-Zeneca [ ] groups described additional tests that could be performed to improve the predictability of in vitro studies towards efficacy in animal models although these may only be applicable to the individual series for which the assay was developed [ ].
Conclusions
New antibacterial agents continue to progress through development. However, as seen in Fig. 9 , most of these new molecules are derived from known classes of antibiotics or are utilizing previously known bacterial targets. The need for indisputably new antibacterial drugs remains unabated. Although the GAIN act has resulted in the approval of five new antibacterial agents over the past two years, these molecules were not inhibiting novel cellular targets. Creative approaches to antibacterial treatment through the use of combination therapy, novel targeted agents that may not fit into the current paradigm of small molecule antibiotics, or novel drug delivery systems would be welcome additions. However, development of novel agents will depend heavily on validated in vitro pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) and animal infection models that serve as key tools in the antibiotic development process; as new agents emerge, these models will continue to need refinement. Additional regulatory considerations and incentive programs will be necessary to ensure that agents with QIDP designations will be identified and progressed rapidly to the marketplace. However, resistance will continue to emerge, and, in fact, has already been described for the ceftazidime–avibactam combination in a set of patients treated with this new agents [ ]. As additional environmental pressure is placed upon the pathogenic bacteria, they will continue to evolve to survive the introduction of new compounds. Pharmacologists, medicinal chemists and microbiologists must be prepared to meet these emerging bacteria with novelty and imagination.
