This bird’s eye view from the 2017 American Heart Association Scientific Sessions which was held in Chicago, Illinois from November 10 to 14 will review key abstracts presented at the meeting related to imaging following a similar structure to our view from previous years. , , Below we summarize selected studies presented in the meeting in the fields of nuclear cardiology, cardiac computed tomography (CT), cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), and echocardiography recognizing that many more studies in these fields were presented at the meeting that cannot all be reviewed here.
Nuclear Cardiology
Many interesting abstracts have been presented at the American Heart Association 2017 meeting regarding advances in nuclear cardiac imaging.
Caffeine and adenosine compete for the same A2 A receptor; still, the effect of caffeine on the diagnostic accuracy of adenosine stress myocardial perfusion imaging has been controversial. , , , Byrne et al. evaluated myocardial flow reserve in healthy volunteers undergoing adenosine stress positron emission tomography (PET) using different doses of caffeine (0, 100, 200, 300, and 400 mg), and found that a caffeine dose ≥ 200 mg significantly reduced myocardial flow reserve, while a dose of 100 mg (equivalent to one cup of coffee) had no effect on flow reserve compared to zero mg (no caffeine intake) (Circulation. 2017;136:A16339). They therefore conclude that one standard cup of coffee taken one hour prior to the pharmacological stress test is unlikely to affect its diagnostic accuracy.
Recent advances in PET allow measurement and quantification of global and regional myocardial blood flow (MBF), which has value in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) and for risk stratification. , . Lu et al. sought to assess the value of 13 NH 3 perfusion PET in 133 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and non-obstructive CAD (Circulation. 2017;136:A12343). Stress-MBF heterogeneity index was obtained by dividing the highest regional MBF value by the lowest regional MBF value; a heterogeneity index was defined as ≥ 1.85 using receiver operating characteristics. Twenty-four patients (24/133) experienced ventricular arrhythmias during 5 years of follow-up. Stress-MBF heterogeneity index was significantly higher in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients who developed ventricular arrhythmia (1.82 ± 0.77 vs 1.49 ± 0.25, P < 0.001), and was an independent predictor of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia/ventricular tachycardia (HR 3.7, 95% CI 1.4 to 9.7), and ventricular tachycardia alone (HR 16.1, 95% CI 3.2 to 80.3).
Moreover, MBF assessment is of particular interest in patients post heart transplant who often have graft vasculopathy. Feher et al. (Circulation 2017;136:A17345) showed a weak but statistically significant inverse relationship between global coronary flow reserve and time-interval since transplantation ( r = − 0.27, 95% CI − 0.45 to − 0.07, P = 0.009). Patients with graft vasculopathy on coronary angiogram had significant lower CFR. Furthermore, severely reduced CFR (CFR ≤ 1.5) was associated with a 3-fold increase in risk of all-cause mortality ( P = 0.03), therefore providing a non-invasive modality for the assessment and prognostication of graft vasculopathy.
The prognostic value of hyperemic MBF among 4714 consecutive patients with and without diabetes mellitus undergoing pharmacologic stress Rb-82 PET was recently evaluated (Circulation 2017;136:A18459). Decreased hyperemic MBF (per 1ml/g/min) was associated with an adjusted 79% and 150% increase in the rate of cardiac death/myocardial infarction at 2 years for patients with and without diabetes ( P < 0.001 for both), and added incremental prognostic value to traditional clinical risk factors (c index, 0.828 to 0.843, P = 0.009; 0.849 to 0.880, P = 0.03, respectively)
Besides MBF assessment, there have been recent advances in PET imaging of atherosclerotic plaques. In particular, 18 F-sodium fluoride ( 18 F-NaF) PET imaging reflects active coronary atherosclerotic calcification associated with an inflammatory stimulus. Kitagawa et al. (Circulation. 2017;136:A14870) evaluated 118 coronary lesions from 34 patients who underwent cardiac coronary CT and 18 F-Na PET imaging. Focal 18 F-NaF uptake of each lesion was quantified using maximum tissue-to-background ratio, and was significantly higher in partially calcified plaques and vulnerable plaques. Patients with a tissue-background ratio > 1.28 had higher one-year coronary events. Hence, 18 F-Na PET imaging may provide a non-invasive way to detect vulnerable plaques and potentially predict short-term future coronary events.
Goto et al. (Circulation 2017;136:A17070) recently studied the mechanism of chronotrophic incompetence using molecular imaging with PET. Indeed, chronotropic incompetence which is the inability of the heart to increase its rate commensurate with increased activity, is associated with exercise intolerance, and is an independent predictor of all-cause mortality. Using a radioactive labeled ligand 11 C-CGP 12177, Goto et al. successfully quantified the cardiac beta-adrenergic receptor density, and showed that it was significantly lower in patients with chronotropic incompetence than in the control group (3.8 ± 1.8 vs 7.9 ± 2.3 pmol/mL, P < 0.01), hence proving the association between receptor density downregulation and chronotropic incompetence.
Diastolic dysfunction is a powerful predictor of mortality (Circulation 2012 Feb 14;125(6):782-8). Phase analysis of gated perfusion imaging evaluates mechanical contraction and relaxation, and provides quantitative mechanical synchrony indices for both systolic and diastolic phases. While most studies have focused on systolic dyssynchrony, there has been emerging interest in diastolic dyssynchrony. In a large retrospective study of 1310 patients, Fudim et al. (Circulation. 2017;136:A18331) demonstrated that worsening of diastolic dyssynchrony was associated with increased all-cause mortality (5% for every 10° increase in histogram bandwidth), similar to worsening of systolic dyssynchrony. These parameters are reproducible, repeatable, and easily obtained from gated SPECT or PET imaging.
Cardiac Computed Tomography
American Heart Association 2017 included several abstracts in the field of cardiac CT, some of which are reviewed here.
Coronary artery calcium (CAC) predicts CAD and cardiovascular events in adults with diabetes; however, its sex-specific impact on disease prevalence and mortality is not well established. Using data from the CAC Consortium, a prospective registry of 66,636 subjects who underwent CAC scanning from 2004 to 2014, Wong et al. (Circulation. 2017;136:A16090) identified 4503 adults with diabetes mellitus (32.5% women, mean age 60.5 years). CAC was absent in 39% of women and 20% of men with diabetes, and was associated with very low event rates. Compared to CAC = 0, the adjusted hazard ratios associated with CAC 1 to 99, 100 to 399, and ≥ 400 in women ranged from 1.0 to 6.3 for cardiovascular death and 1.4 to 4.1 for total death; in men the hazard ratios ranged from 1.4 to 3.5 and 1.4 to 2.6, respectively. There was a significant interaction between sex and CAC categories for cardiovascular and total death ( P < 0.05), as higher CAC levels predicted outcomes more strongly in women as compared to men.
The impact of diabetes control on coronary atherosclerosis burden and significant stenosis (≥ 50%) was evaluated by Park et al. (Circulation. 2017;136:A11790) among 6434 consecutive asymptomatic individuals without previous history of CAD who underwent coronary CT angiogram. Patients were categorized as normal ( n = 5409), controlled diabetes (hemoglobin A1C < 7%, n = 666), and uncontrolled diabetes (hemoglobin A1C ≥ 7%, n = 359). Compared with normal individuals, patients with controlled diabetes had a higher risk for any atherosclerotic plaque (odds ratio 1.23, P = 0.029), but there was no difference between the groups in significant coronary artery stenosis ( P = 0.145), or 2-year outcomes (hazard ratio 1.12 [0.60 to 2.11], P = 0.726). In contrast, patients with uncontrolled diabetes had consistently higher risks of any atherosclerotic plaque (odds ratio 2.26, P < 0.001), more significant coronary artery stenosis (odds ratio 3.46, P < 0.001), and increased risk of cardiac events (hazard ratio 2.71 [1.50 to 4.91], P = 0.001) as compared to normal individuals, hence highlighting the importance of diabetes control.
In addition to risk stratification among diabetic patients and smokers, CAC score was recently shown to provide prognostic value in older adults. Wang et al (Circulation. 2017;136:A18835) evaluated 2,474 asymptomatic patients ≥ 75 (mean age 79.1 ± 3.7 years, 44% women) with mean and interquartile ranges for CAC 520 (136 to 1281) for men and 151 (26 to 512) for women. CAC was predictive of cardiovascular mortality in men (hazard ratios as compared to the lower quartile were significantly increased in the 3rd and 4th quartiles 1.6 [1.0 to 2.6] and 2.3 [1.5 to 3.6], respectively), and women (hazard ratios increased in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th quartiles 2.1 [1.0 to 4.1], 2.6 [1.3 to 4.9], and 4.8 [2.6 to 8.9], respectively). Using data from the same CAC Consortium, Mirbolouk et al. (Circulation 2017;136:A20332) showed that CAC score independently predicted all-cause death and cardiovascular death among smokers and non-smokers. Also, the impact of family history of premature CAD on CAC score and severity of coronary artery stenosis was evaluated by Patel et al. (Circulation 2017;136:A17209) who analyzed 43,295 patients from the same registry. Compared to those without a family history, those with a family history were more likely to have cardiovascular risk factors, higher mean total CAC score, and vessel involvement. After multivariate adjustment, family history was a predictor of increased number of vessels involved and more diffuse atherosclerosis, independent of the CAC score.
There are multiple clinical and imaging variables beyond the traditional risk factors and CAC score that can be obtained from a cardiac CT study, including total number and density of CAC plaques, CAC volume scores, and extracardiac CAC scores (thoracic aortic, aortic valve and mitral valve calcification), comprising more than 100 variables. Machine learning algorithms take into account all these variables, provide the needed tool to do complex analyses, and in a recent study showed better discrimination to predict moderate (CAC score > 100) and high-risk (CAC score > 400) cardiovascular disease than Framingham risk score in the asymptomatic population (area under the curve 0.86 [0.85 to 0.86] vs 0.74 [0.73 to 0.75]; P -value < 0.001, and 0.89 [0.88 to 0.90] vs 0.77 [0.75 to 0.79]; P -value < 0.001, respectively) (Circulation 2017;136:A18581). Similarly, Nakanishi et al. (Circulation 2017;136:A15137) showed that the machine learning algorithms were better predictors of 10-year cardiovascular events than traditional clinical risk factors and CAC score.
Epicardial adipose tissue is an emerging risk factor of coronary atherosclerosis. Senoo et al. (Circulation. 2017;136:A17929) quantified epicardial fat volume by coronary CT angiography in 747 patients without known CAD and showed that high epicardial fat volume (≥ 100 mL/m 2 ) was associated with increased cardiovascular event rate (hazard ratio 3.01, P = 0.0009), and remained predictive after adjustment for coronary artery stenosis (hazard ratio 4.10, P = 0.0001). This predictive power was more prominent in non-obstructive CAD patients. In a similar study, Tanaka et al. evaluated the impact of visceral abdominal fat on coronary atherosclerosis; indeed, a high visceral to subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue was an independent predictor of high coronary atherosclerotic burden (Circulation 2017;136:A17900). Moreover, fat deposition in the liver, particularly non-alcoholic fatty liver, was shown to be associated with non-calcified plaque (adjusted odds ratio 1.27, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.48, P = 0.003) and significant coronary stenosis (adjusted odds ratio 1.28, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.61, P = 0.030), suggesting an increased cardiovascular risk.
It has been well established that inflammation plays a role in the pathogenesis of coronary artery plaques and perhaps plaque rupture. Cardiac CT identifies low-density plaques with positive remodeling that are considered high-risk plaques, and likely a feature of a vulnerable plaque. Sakamoto et al. evaluated the association between CT-high-risk plaques and immunoglobulin G4 which is a marker of immuno-inflammation in 184 patients (Circulation 2017;136:A14640). After adjusting for age, gender, glomerular filtration rate, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, lipid profile, and serum immunoglobulin, G4 levels were independently associated with high-risk plaques (odds ratio 2.13 per 100 mg/dL increase, 95% confidence interval 1.34 to 3.40, P = 0.001).
While statins have anti-inflammatory properties which are though to contribute to lower cardiovascular event rate, many non-statin lipid lowering therapies are currently on the market and used as second line therapy. Post-hoc analysis of a large registry of patients undergoing cardiac CT, showed that non-statin therapy did not result in differences in plaque composition and did not modify the impact of statin therapy on plaque composition (Circulation. 2017;136:A1873).
One of the limitations of coronary CT angiography is the difficulty to evaluate the luminal stenosis at calcified plaques. Novel CT scanner with ultra-high spatial resolution was recently developed. Motoyama et al. (Circulation. 2017;136:A16173) evaluated 79 patients who underwent coronary CTA with ultra-high-resolution CT (U-HRCT: 1792 channels and 0.25-mm slice thickness × 128 row); compared to conventional CT (C-896 channels and 0.5-mm slice thickness × 320 row), ultra-high-resolution CT improved image quality, particularly around calcified plaques that could be better visualized as well the adjacent luminal stenosis.
Left atrial appendage is well visualized on cardiac CT, but little data exist on diagnostic accuracy of CT for detection of thrombus. Kuronoma et al. showed that delayed CT imaging resulted in higher diagnostic accuracy for the detection of left atrial appendage thrombus (area under the curve 0.95 with delayed imaging as compared to 0.83 for early imaging), with a sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and negative predictive value of 100%, 93% 94%, and 100 %, respectively, although low positive predictive value 38% (Circulation 2017;136:A19711). The additional radiation dose was minimal with dose-length product 29.6 mGy.cm. In addition, the enhancement pattern for the left atrial appendage has been recently categorized as low risk and high risk for prediction of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation, even after adjusting for CHA2DS2-VASc score and ejection fraction (Circulation 2017;136:A19955).
Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging
Several exciting CMR-based studies were presented at the American Heart Association 2017 Scientific Sessions. We review few of these here.
CMR has shown capability to detect lesions created during radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) procedures performed for arrhythmia. However, the relationship between the size of abnormality seen on CMR in the actual lesion size, along with the time course of imaging and histological findings, is not completely understood. In a preclinical study, Tao et al. (Circulation 2017;136:A16988) performed RFCA in the left ventricle of swine, then performed T1-weighted and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging immediately after RFCA, at 21 days, and at 1 to 3 months post-RFCA. Hearts were excised for histologic examination in some of the animals after the first CMR, while in others excision and histology were performed after the subsequent CMR examinations. Lesion size as seen on T1-weighted imaging was similar to that on histologic examination immediately after RFCA, and decreased in size subsequently, underestimating histologic lesion size by 11% at 21 days and shrank further subsequently. LGE imaging performed immediately after RFCA showed that the area of LGE was larger than the histologic size in the acute phase, and also shrank by day 21 and then showed no change in size subsequently. They concluded that T1-weighted CMR is useful in the early phase and LGE more useful for assessing lesion extent in the chronic phase after one-month post-RFCA.
Assessment of myocardial strain is an emerging technique for evaluation of a number of myocardial diseases. As with echocardiographic-derived strains, there are various methods for measuring strain using CMR; the agreement among these various methods may vary. Cao et al. (Circulation. 2017;136:A20373) undertook a systematic evaluation in 77 patients with cardiomyopathy and ten normal controls on a 1.5 T scanner using strains derived from MR tagging, displacement encoding with stimulated echoes (DENSE), and from standard steady-state free precession (SSFP) cine imaging with feature tracking. They analyzed peak strains in the circumferential (Ecc), longitudinal (Ell), and radial (Err) directions. Feature tracking strains were analyzed using software from three commercial vendors while that from tagging and DENSE analyzed using special proprietary software. Ecc showed good agreement among the various analytic methods, with Ell showing somewhat lower agreement, and poor agreement among the various modalities for determining Err (ranging from 23 ± 9% to 64 ± 33%). All methods showed excellent intra- and inter-observer reproducibility. Based on these findings, it would seem that use of Ecc and/or Ell would be preferable to use of Err in analyzing and comparing myocardial strain across methods and analytic software tools.
Determination of diastolic dysfunction is a challenge regardless of the modality employed for assessment, because available methods assess parameters that are dependent on the loading conditions. It would be preferable to have a method that directly assesses the stiffness of the myocardium. MR elastography (MRE), which measures the propagation velocity of transverse acoustic waves in tissue introduced via a vibrating transducer, is an established method for assessing stiffness of liver tissue and potentially attractive for study of the myocardium. However, application of this method to the myocardium in beating hearts has proven difficult. In a very interesting abstract illustrating a new direction in CMR, Arani et al. (Circulation 2017;136:A15381) employed a novel, high-frequency MRE method using a vibrating acoustic frequency of 140 Hz to assess 58 normal volunteers in nine patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), using a 1.5 T scanner. They found that myocardial stiffness in HFpEF patients (11 ± 2 kPa) was higher than that in normal controls (8 ± 1 kPa, P = 0.006). If this technique can be implemented widely, it could potentially revolutionize the assessment of diastolic function.
Stem cell injection into the myocardium as a regenerative therapy for heart failure in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy has been of clinical interest for many years. , CMR, using certain acquisition sequences, is particularly attractive as a tracking tool to locate position and the presence of these stem cells and assess response to therapy. Microvascular obstruction (MVO) following MI is known to cause worse outcomes, but may make administration of stem cells more effective if they can be trapped in the infarct zone and not free to circulate and migrate. In an interesting new application of CMR in stem cell therapy, Davidson et al. (Circulation 2017;136:A14189) analyzed baseline, pre-stem cell injection CMR in 153 patients with anterior MI who underwent successful primary PCI/stent and participating in the Cardiovascular Cell Therapy Research Network (CCTRN) TIME trial or its pilot trial, in which MI patients received either autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMCs) or placebo. They found that patients with MVO as evidenced by LGE CMR had larger infarct size, greater LV volumes and lower LVEF compared to those without MVO, and at 6 months had less improvement in LVEF and worse adverse LV remodeling. The patients with MVO who received BMCs had less adverse LV remodeling at 6 months than those who received placebo treatment, but had similar changes in LVEF at this time point. This abstract points to a potential use of CMR in selecting patients who may respond favorably to therapy.
LGE has been shown in a multitude of studies to be useful in evaluating myocardial viability, scar, and interstitial fibrosis by CMR methods. In fact, all currently available contrast agents for clinical CMR are gadolinium based. However, there are emerging techniques using manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) to evaluate myocardial viability. MEMRI allows measurement of viable cardiomyocytes due to the specific uptake of manganese ion through the L-type calcium channel. Sano et al. (Circulation 2017;136:A14068) employed MEMRI with T1 mapping as compared to LGE and native T1 mapping, to evaluate the peri-infarct region in 11 patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy, using quantitative methods to measure scar size. They demonstrated that MEMRI was able to depict three separate zones of myocardium in these patients, based on the measured T1 value after contrast: Infarct core showing a 5.7% reduction in T1, peri-infarct region showing a 16.2% reduction in T1, and remote regions showing a 27% reduction in T1 after manganese contrast injection. Native T1 mapping and LGE techniques were unable to visualize a separate peri-infarct region. To the extent that determination of peri-infarct zones has clinical relevance including in pathogenesis of ventricular arrhythmia, manganese-based contrast agents may show utility.
Echocardiography
American Heart Association 2017 Scientific Sessions included several interesting presentations of scientific advances using echocardiography.
Current guidelines time surgical intervention for primary organic mitral regurgitation based on left ventricular ejection fraction. Hiemstra et al. (Circulation. 2017;136:A16287) evaluated the prognostic value of global longitudinal strain (GLS) by echocardiography before surgical intervention on outcomes after surgery in 593 patients with severe organic mitral regurgitation. During a median follow-up of 6.4 years, 25% of patients died. Baseline GLS and LVEF were associated with mortality on univariate analysis but only GLS and age maintained this association after multivariate adjustment. This robust association of GLS with outcomes after mitral valve surgery indicates that it may be useful to fine-tune the timing of surgery in these patients.
A hypertensive response to exercise (HRE) is commonly seen with exercise stress tests. HRE is known to be associated with decreased specificity of stress testing and may also be associated with decreased sensitivity if the stress test is terminated early due to safety concerns. Kunchakarra et al. (Circulation 2017;136:A16553) evaluated the clinical predictors of HRE in a study of 143 consecutive patients with HRE compared to 143 and age- and gender-matched controls without HRE. HRE was defined as a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of greater than or equal to 220 mmHg in males and 210 mmHg in females, or a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of greater than or equal to 110 mmHg in either gender with exercise. In multivariate analysis, diabetes, obesity, black race, and elevated resting SBP were significant predictors of HRE. When resting SBP was divided into quartiles (< 120, 120 to 140, 140 to 160, and > 160 mmHg), each increased in SBP quartile was associated with a 4-fold increased likelihood of HRE. The only modifiable risk predictor of HRE is resting SBP. Control of SBP prior to stress testing may significantly decrease the risk of HRE.
The left atrial appendage is an important source of thrombus formation that may result in strokes. However, the prognostic significance of left atrium and its appendage remodeling in patients who already suffered a stroke is unknown. Park et al. (Circulation 2017;136:A17299) reported on the association of left atrial parameters with stroke recurrence and mortality in 71 patients (mean age 61 years) who underwent transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography after presenting with a stroke. Higher left atrial appendage strain was independently associated with stroke recurrence at 1 year while left atrial area was associated with 2-year mortality. In this study, the CHADS2 and CAHDS2-VASC scores were not associated with outcomes. Anticoagulation treatment was not reported in the abstract. This study demonstrates that evaluation of left atrial parameters may help in risk stratification of patients who already had a stroke.
Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have a high rate of cardiovascular disease. , Prior studies have demonstrated that an impaired LVEF is associated with poor prognosis in these patients. Hensen et al. (Circulation 2017;136:A15399) studied 200 patients (mean age 60 years) with CKD stage 3b to 5 and preserved LVEF using speckle tracking echocardiography. An impaired systolic dysfunction was defined as a GLS ≤ 15.2%. The cohort was followed for a median of 33 months during which time 9% were admitted with heart failure and 28% died. An impaired LV systolic function by GLS was present in 32% of patients and this was associated with significantly higher cumulative rate of adverse events during follow-up. This study demonstrates that early systolic dysfunction as determined by speckle tracking GLS is common in patients with CKD and that it is associated with increased risk of heart failure and mortality.
Ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD) is a novel non-invasive technique that can deliver drugs and/or genes to target organs in living animals. This technique allows for targeting a specific region with minimal delivery to other regions, delivers the drug and/or gene directly to the vasculature which is an advantage in ischemic pathologies and is therefore suitable for interventions that aim at enhancing angiogenesis, and is non-invasive. In a prior report, Cao et al. demonstrated that UTMD can be used to improve tissue perfusion and vascular density in a rat model of chronic limb ischemia. Translating this therapy to a larger animal model, Chen et al. (Circulation 2017;136:A19897) evaluate UTMD of 1 mg minicircle VEGF DNA (longer lasting, greater gene expression vs plasmids) vs. empty vector in Myocardial Infarction prone Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHLMI) rabbits that underwent left femoral artery ligation and stripping 4 weeks prior to therapy. VEGF administration improved microvascular blood flow assessed by contrast-enhanced ultrasound at 8 and 12 weeks after artery ligation. Femoral angiography at 12 weeks after ligation demonstrated improved collateral vessel formation and reconstitution of the distal arterial bed in VEGF UTMD-treated rabbits. This study demonstrates the potential of UTMD-targeted gene therapy in a large animal model of peripheral arterial disease.
