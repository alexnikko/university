Introduction
One out of every four deaths in America is due to cancer, making it the second leading cause of death in the USA. In 2014, approximately 600,000 lives were lost due to cancer [ ]. Although cancer mortality rates have declined over the last two decades as a result of increased emphasis on early detection, smoking cessation, and improved treatment methods [ ], cancer remains a significant burden to patients and their families. While the mechanism through which excess body fat, caloric intake, and physical inactivity impact cancer risk is unclear, it is evident these factors are intricately intertwined [ ]. Therefore, primary prevention efforts such as promoting health behaviors and preventative lifestyle, as well as early detection efforts remain a priority [ ].
Understanding the adoption of primary prevention efforts as it influences cancer risk perception should be examined. Risk perception is an intrinsic motivation that may facilitate or hinder cancer protective behaviors such as physical activity, healthy diets, non-smoking, and routine cancer screening [ , ]. Assessing an individual’s perception of cancer risk is often conceptualized cognitively by asking, “how likely are you to develop cancer in your lifetime?” Yet, this conceptualization is only somewhat effective in explaining risk as a precursor to practicing preventive behaviors [ , ]. An alternative, and possibly more effective, method of assessing an individual’s perceived cancer risk is by engaging the affective domain. Risk perception as conceptualized in the affective domain involves assessing feelings and emotions towards cancer [ , ]. One such emotion or feeling which may be a powerful predictor of future behaviors as it relates to cancer protective health behaviors is worry [ ]. The primary function of worry is the cognitive avoidance of a perceived threat [ ]. Cancer worry is defined as a negative emotional reaction to feeling susceptible to a positive cancer diagnosis [ ]. Worry has been shown to direct attention to a threat, facilitate analytical thinking, and sometimes elicit problem solving and self-protective behavior to reduce the threat [ ].
Our study builds upon evidence demonstrating the influence worry has on health behaviors. Worrying has been associated with positive health-related behaviors such as healthy eating [ ], condom use [ ], smoking cessation [ ], HIV testing [ ], and uptake for immunizations [ ]. In cancer research, cancer worry has been shown to positively influence cancer-screening behaviors [ , ]. Despite the existing literature demonstrating the influence of worry on health-related behaviors, few studies have explicitly examined the relationship between perceived cancer risk (conceptualized in the affective domain), operationalized as cancer worry, and its influence on cancer-related health-protecting behaviors—physical activity, healthy diets, non-smoking, and routine cancer screening among a nationally representative sample. Further, given that sociodemographic factors play a significant role in why individuals may worry about cancer, and the limited literature on the role of sociodemographic factors on cancer-related protective health behaviors, it is imperative to begin to address this knowledge gap.
Two primary questions guide this study: 1. What sociodemographic characteristics are associated with cancer worry? 2. What is the influence of cancer worry on four cancer-related health protective health behaviors (physical activity, healthy diets, smoking status, and routine cancer screening)?
Methods
Instrument
Data from the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) (4th cycle of the 4th iteration) was used for all analyses. HINTS is a nationally representative survey of the US non-institutionalized adult population that collects data on the public’s need for, access to, and use of health-related information among the American population [ ]. HINTS dataset and detail information is available online to the public [ ]. HINTS sample design was a two-stage stratified sample with addresses selected from a comprehensive United States Postal Service national residential file, and individual respondents were selected per each household in the sample. More details on survey design, sampling strategies, and methodology of the HINTS are published elsewhere [ , ].
As noted by Nelson et al. (2004), there were three primary requirements for item inclusion on the HINTS: “scientific validity, utility and implementation” (p. 447). In terms of psychometric properties, Nelson et al. (2004) vie “Scientific validity criteria emphasized including items that have been demonstrated to measure population-based constructs in reliable ways, and for which external evidence has been collected to demonstrate suitability of the measure in assessing the construct in question” (p. 447). Thus, the items included in this investigation have been thoroughly vetted and deemed appropriate by not only experts but also the extant literature. Also, this research was exempt from the human research protocol review by the institution affiliated with the authors because secondary data were utilized for all analyses. The institutional review board deemed this study exempt from review because it is a secondary and national dataset.
Variables
The demographic variables that were used as controls for this study included participant age in years, income ranges, and body mass index (BMI). Dummy coded variables for level of education were included for participants that had a high school degree, some college experience, a college graduate degree, and a postgraduate education with less than high school degree being the reference group. Dummy variables for marital status were included for participants that were single, divorced, and other marital status with married participants being the reference group. Dummy variables for race were included for participants that identified as Hispanic, Caucasian, and African American with other being the reference group. Lastly, a dummy for gender was included for female participants with males being the reference category. See Table 1 for a breakdown of the frequencies and percentages for gender, ethnicity, marital status, and education. The cancer worry variable asked participants: “How worried are you about getting cancer?” This variable consisted of a five-point Likert scale with lower values indicating no worry and higher values indicating extreme worry.

Physical exercise was an index constructed from two variables that asked participants (1) how many days during the week they engaged in moderate exercised and (2) how many minutes during these days they engaged in moderate exercise. These variables were multiplied to create an index of minutes per week a participant engaged in moderate physical activity. The distribution for this variable had considerable right skew and was log transformed to provide a more normally distributed approximation.
Smoking: This nominal variable asked a participant to identify whether they are a current smoker, a former smoker, or if they have never smoked cigarettes.
Fruits and vegetables was an index constructed from two variables that asked participants (1) how many cups of fruit (including 100% pure fruit juice) they consumed per day and (2) how many cups of vegetables (including 100% pure vegetable juice) they consumed per day. For both variables, they consisted of a seven-point Likert scale that ranged from lower values indicating “none” to higher values indicating “more than 4 cups a day.” These variables were summed to reflect the total amount of fruit and vegetables a participant consumes in 1 day.
The routine screening variable asks participants “About how long has it been since you last visited a doctor for a routine checkup?” Responses consisted of a five-point Likert scale that ranged from lower values indicating “Never” to higher values indicating “Within the past year.”
Data Analysis
For the purposes of this study, only participants who indicated that they never had cancer were used for the analyses ( n = 3160). To examine the relationship between worrying over cancer and exercise, smoking, nutrition, and cancer screening, several regression models were created to examine the predictive nature of worrying over cancer. Before the regression models were run, missing data patterns were assessed to determine if treatment of the missing data would be necessary. Results indicated that 7.07% of the total proportion of values in the data matrix were missing and Little’s MCAR test was significant, χ 2 (1328) = 1824.82, p < .001, indicating that the data was not missing completely at random. Since more than 5% of the data was missing and the missing was at random (MAR), multiple imputation was used to treat the missing data. Multiple imputation estimates and replaces missing values into several data sets (usually 5 to 10 datasets) using iterative random draws. Statistical analyses are then conducted on each dataset and results are pooled to a single set of parameter estimates, standard errors, and test statistics. This study utilized 10 imputed datasets and employed a fully conditional specification (FCS) using the chained equations methods in Stata.
Results
The largest percentage of participants had an income ranging from $50,000 to $74,999 (16.7%), their age ranged from 18 to 97 ( M = 53.20, SD = 16.05), and BMI scores ranged from 7.8 to 85.5 ( M = 28.24, SD = 6.61), see Table 1 .
A logistic regression model predicting cancer worry from the demographic variables was significant, F (14, 19,032.8) = 8.73, p < .001. Age, education, marital status, ethnicity, BMI, and gender were all significant predictors. Older participants (OR = .99, p < .001) and participants with higher BMI (OR = 1.01, p = .017) were more likely to report worrying over cancer. In addition, the more education participants had the more likely they were to report worrying over cancer. Finally, females (OR = 1.39, p < .001) were more likely to worry over cancer compared to males and divorced participants (OR = 1.23, p = .030) were more likely to worry over cancer compared to married participants.

A linear regression model predicting exercise from cancer worry and controlling for demographic variables was also significant, F (15, 337.9) = 10.04, p < .001. Of the predictor variables, only education, ethnicity, BMI, and income were significant. Participants with more education were associated with higher exercise scores relative to participants who had no high school education. In addition, Hispanic participants were associated with higher exercise scores ( β = .427, p = .001) while African American participants were associated with lower exercise scores ( β = −.332, p < .001). Participants who had higher BMI scores were associated with lower exercise scores ( β = −.198, p < .001). Finally, participants with higher income were associated with higher exercise scores ( β = .108, p = .004). However, cancer worry was not a significant predictor of exercise, p = .346.

A multinomial logistic regression predicting smoking status from cancer worry and the demographic variables was also significant, F (30, 54,682.8) = 13.06, p < .001. Current smokers and former smokers were assigned as the observed categories of the dependent variable and the reference category was participants who never smoked. For the current smokers category of the DV, participants who worried about cancer were more likely to be current smokers (RRR = 1.20, p < .001) compared to participants who never smoked. In addition, divorced participants (RRR = 1.78, p < .001) and participants who identified as “other” marital status (RRR = 1.47, p = .043) were more likely to be current smokers. Participants who were college graduates (RRR = .411, p < .001) or had postgraduate degree (RRR = .300, p < .001) were less likely to be current smokers. Female participants were less likely to be current smokers (RRR = .618, p < .001) compared to males. Caucasian participants were more likely to be current smokers (RRR = 1.98, p < .001) compared participants who identified as “other” for racial categories. Participants who had higher levels of BMI were less likely to be current smokers (RRR = .969, p = .001) than participants who never smoked. Lastly, participants with higher income were more likely to be current smokers (RRR = .821, p < .001) compared to participants who never smoked.
For the former smokers category of the dependent variable, older participants were more likely to be former smokers (RRR = 1.02, p < .001). Participants who were divorced were more likely to be former smokers (RRR = 1.38, p < .001) compared to participants who never smoked. In addition, participants who identified as Caucasian (RRR = 2.00, p < .001) were more likely to be former smokers than participants who identified as the “Other” race category. Participants who have higher BMI are more likely to be former smokers (RRR = 1.02, p < .001). Lastly, female participants were less likely than males to be former smokers (RRR = .596, p < .001). However, cancer worry was not a significant predictor of former smoking status, p > .05 (Table 4 ).

A linear regression predicting nutrition from cancer worry and the demographic variables was also significant, F (15, 2800.9) = 14.55, p < .001. Of the predictor variables, only education, marital status, BMI, income, and gender were significant. Participants who were college graduates ( β = .204, p = .009) or postgraduates ( β = .334, p < .001) were associated with higher nutrition scores. In addition, participants who were divorced ( β = −.119, p = .022) were associated with lower nutrition scores compared to participants who were married. Participants with lower BMI ( β = −.079, p < .001) and participants with higher income ( β = .084, p < .001) were also associated with higher nutrition scores. Finally, female participants were associated with higher nutrition scores ( β = .242, p < .001) compared to male participants. However, cancer worry however was not a significant predictor of nutrition, p = .110. For a detailed breakdown of the statistics, see Table 5 .

Of the predictor variables, age, education, ethnicity, and gender were significant. Older participants (OR = 1.04, p < .001) and participants with a high school degree (OR = .59, p = .006) were more likely to be screened for cancer. In addition, African American participants (OR = 1.97, p = .001) and female participants (OR = 1.67, p < .001) were more likely to be screened for cancer.

Discussion
The purpose of this manuscript was to investigate what demographic variables influence cancer worry and the influence cancer worry has on protective health behaviors such as smoking, exercise, diet, and routine cancer screening. Demographic factors significantly associated with cancer worry were being older, having a higher BMI, being female, and having a higher education. The only behavior associated with cancer worry was being a current smoker.
The significant association with cancer worry among older participants might be related to cancer disproportionally affecting those who are older [ ]. Advance in age is the most recognized risk factor for cancer and in fact, in the USA, the median age of cancer diagnosis is 66 years [ ]. The increased cancer worry among older participants might be related to having reached an age of which cancer screening is recommended. For instance, the U.S. Preventative Services recommends screening for breast cancer and colorectal cancer for adults over the age of 50 years [ ]. Additionally, among older adults, cancer worry is associated with family history of cancer, having health problems, having a low perception of health status, and decreased social support [ ].
Higher BMI was another significant factor for cancer worry. A strong relationship between being overweight or obese has been linked with several cancers including breast, colon and rectum, pancreas, kidney, and esophagus [ ]. The link between cancer and obesity is especially concerning as some research has demonstrated that weight gain in young adulthood is a more influencing factor for cancer than weight gain in adulthood [ ]. However, the connection linking obesity with cancer is likely related to the diet consumed, as well as to the interactions of the gut microbiota hosted by the obese individual. Previous studies demonstrate that greater cancer worry positively influences obesity-related behaviors such as increased exercise and higher consumption of fruit and vegetables [ ]. Our results however, did not find a significant association between worry and physical activity or nutrition behaviors. The need to educate the public on the effect of physical activity on cancer risk was identified in a previous study of worry and physical activity among college women [ ]. Bernat [ ] demonstrated that very few women, 31%, met physical activity recommendations and the qualitative interviews demonstrated lack of knowledge about physical activity as an influencing factor for cancer risk.
For nutrition behaviors such as fruits and vegetables intake, females who adhered to the National Cancer Institute’s guidelines of consuming at least 5 to 9 servings of fruits and vegetables a day were more likely to perceive themselves at lower risk of breast cancer than females who did not adhere to the guidelines [ ]. Additionally, even among individuals who report being physically active and maintaining a healthy diet for cancer prevention, majority still do not meet the minimum recommendations for cancer prevention [ ], emphasizing the need for increased education on the influence of physical activity and nutrition behaviors on cancer prevention.
Being female was another significant factor for cancer worry. According to our findings, women were more likely to worry about developing cancer than men which is supported by past research [ , ]. The increased worry among women has been associated with higher screening rates for cancer among women compared to men [ ]. Among women with breast cancer, worry influences health information seeking and results in increased perceived knowledge and decreased worry after 2 months of health information seeking [ ]. In another study, men were more likely to have increased cognitive cancer risk perceptions [ ]. The cognitive vs. affective perceptions may align with gender differences related to logical and emotional responses to threat [ ]. More research is needed to determine if gender differences in cancer risk perception occur in other samples. Men and women may respond differently to risk perception messages, involving both cognitive and emotional appeal, and some research suggests that gender-specific messaging may be necessary [ ].
Having higher education increased cancer worry. Individuals with higher education have been found to have higher levels of cancer knowledge, which may influence cancer worry [ ]. Education is linked to socioeconomic status which has been demonstrated to contribute to disparities in information as individuals of higher SES are more likely to have access to cancer information [ ]. Those with higher education have also been shown to have different levels of knowledge of cancer risk [ ]. In particular, the level of health literacy has been demonstrated to influence levels of cancer worry [ ]. Those of higher SES and knowledge may have more knowledge of the different causes of major cancers therefore increasing worry [ ]. For those with higher worry though, information seeking has been found to lower cancer worry and increase knowledge [ ].
Cancer worry did not influence routine screening in this study. This result contradicts previous results [ , , , , ]. Several factors may have influenced the difference in findings, such as follows: (1) other studies have focused on site-specific cancers [ , ], while this study focuses on cancer in general; (2) our study population was a general nationally representative sample as opposed to specific high risk groups like those with a family history of cancer [ , ] or older adults [ , ]; (3) the way worry has been measured previously asks about the frequency of cancer worry (how often do you worry?) [ ] while our examination of worry is associated with the intensity/magnitude of cancer worry; and lastly, our examination of general routine screening instead of cancer routine screening may have influenced our results.
Another salient finding was that the only behavior significantly associated with cancer worry was current smoking status. There is very strong evidence linking smoking and increased cancer risk [ ] as well as public health campaigns that link smoking to cancer [ ]. For example, young adults are more likely to identify smoking as a risk factor for cancer due to highly publicized campaigns [ ]. Those who smoke may have increased cancer worry due to being in a group with increased risk of cancer [ ]. Nutrition and PA behaviors unlike smoking are highly publicized in the media in relation to obesity but not cancer. For cancer prevention, public health programs that aim for prevention stress early detection as the principal prevention method for cancers [ ]. There is currently mixed evidence on the effect of the consumption of fruits and vegetables. Some studies have found a positive relationship with the consumption of fruits and vegetables and cancer [ , ], while others have found the opposite results [ , ]. The difference between these studies is likely that those that found positive influence of diet on cancer occurrence use human tumor cell lines that show that bioactive components of food have the potential to inhibit cancer growth/progression, while those that have found negative results are population studies. Thus, more studies are needed to tease out the relationship between diet and cancer. There are also mixed findings on the relationship between physical activity and cancer risk [ , ].
Further, cancer can develop due to risk factors beyond diet, such as genetics, environmental factors, and geographical area [ ]. Future studies might explore other factors such as genetics, environment, geographic location, and advice from healthcare providers. Given the continued growth in the number of persons with cancer in the USA [ ], the primary prevention of cancer remains an urgent public health priority. As the field of cancer prevention continues to mature and scientific knowledge evolves, it is imperative to challenge the status quo and embrace new approaches to cancer prevention. To accomplish this goal, a more transdisciplinary and multifaceted approach is needed, adapted as appropriate for different populations and stages of life. The greatest improvements in cancer prevention may occur as a result of innovative, multilevel interventions that build on the expanding scientific evidence base. In the future, the greatest improvements in cancer prevention might occur as a result of innovative, multilevel interventions that build on the expanding base of scientific evidence
Health promotion professionals are often enlisted to develop culturally appropriate programs that are in the forefront of promoting voluntary behavior change. Since many Americans do not perceive exercise or a healthy nutrition to be a form of cancer prevention, using motivating factors such as feelings of personal predisposition from a family cancer event could be a way to raise one’s consciousness and promote physical activity. Although, worry is only an emotional influence on health behavior and may be short-lived, the influence of worry on health-related decision making is likely to have a lasting effect even when the emotions are no longer present [ , ].
Limitations
A key limitation of our study is that it is based on self-report. However, studies have found cancer family history reports to be generally accurate, particularly in cases of breast and colorectal cancer [ , ]. Further, we have no information on the age at which the family member was diagnosed, number of family members diagnosed, or degree of relationship with the family member diagnosed. Another limitation includes the cross-sectional design and the inability to establish cause and effect. An important strength of the current study was the nationally representative sample. Evidence suggests that some cancers in adolescents and young adults may have unique genetic and biological features. Inconsistencies in defining an age range for adolescents and young adults are understandable given the realities of the complex biologic and psychosocial developmental processes experienced in the lengthy transition from childhood to adulthood in Western cultures In conclusion, the results from this study confirm that health promotion specialists have the challenge of promoting physical activity, nutrition, and routine screening as a form of cancer prevention. While the general population more readily accepts medical interventions, such as screenings, as a method of disease prevention, additional awareness campaigns are needed to illustrate that 30% of cancers can be averted with physical activity [ ]. Cancer worries and cognitive risk perception can be utilized to promote lifestyle changes as long as Americans understand the strong benefits of exercise.
