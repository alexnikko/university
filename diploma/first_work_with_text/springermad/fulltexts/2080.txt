Introduction
Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a devastating subtype of hemorrhagic stroke with high mortality and severe disability [ , ]. Early brain injury is recently considered the main cause of mortality in patients with SAH [ , ]. Accumulating evidence has indicated that neuronal apoptosis is one of the primary mechanisms in early brain injury after SAH [ , ]. Finding ideal anti-apoptotic agents remains a meaningful and challenging task.
Mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1 (MST1) is a crucial serine-threonine kinase, which is a critical component of the Hippo signaling pathway [ ]. MST1 is expressed ubiquitously with multiple biological effects including cell growth [ ], oxidative stress response [ ], apoptosis [ ], and tumor suppression [ ]. Previous studies have demonstrated that MST1 is a pro-apoptotic protein that is localized predominantly in the cytoplasm [ ]. In response to various apoptotic stimuli, MST1 could be cleaved by caspases to form a 34- to 36-kDa N-terminal constitutively active fragment [ ]. This cleaved MST1 (cl-MST1) is subsequently translocated to the nucleus where it phosphorylates Histone H2B, leading to cell apoptosis [ ]. In addition, MST1 phosphorylates the transcription factor FOXO, inducing neuronal apoptosis [ ]. Previous studies have indicated that MST1 can be regulated at the posttranslational level [ ]. MST1 autophosphorylation can amplify apoptotic responses by enhancing cleavage of caspases [ ]. Regulation of the activity of MST1 might be a novel therapeutic target to improve the survival of neurons after SAH. Protein-protein interactions play a critical role in the regulation of MST1 activity [ ]. Protein- l -isoaspartate ( d -aspartate) O -methyltransferase (PCMT1) can bind to the N-terminal fragment of MST1 and inhibit MST1-mediated myocardial cell apoptosis [ ]. PCMT1 is highly enriched in the brain, especially in neuronal cells [ ]. However, the role of PCMT1 and MST1 have not been studied in early brain injury after SAH.
This study aimed to investigate the effect of PCMT1/MST1 pathway in SAH-induced neuronal apoptosis and further explore the underlying mechanisms of the inhibitory effect of PCMT1 on MST1-mediated neuronal apoptosis in SAH rats.
Materials and Methods
Animals
All experiments were approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of the Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine. We strictly followed the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health and Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines. One hundred ninety-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing between 300 and 320 g were purchased from Slac Laboratory Animal Company Limited (Shanghai, China). Forty-eight rats were excluded due to death from cerebral hernia and a low SAH grade (less than 8). The rats were housed under controlled temperature and humidity conditions with 12-h light/dark cycles. All rats were randomly divided into parallel experimental groups.
Endovascular Perforation SAH Model
This model was performed according to previous studies [ , ]. Briefly, all rats were given 40 mg/kg pentobarbital sodium via intraperitoneal injection. Subsequently, we exposed the left carotid artery and its branches. A sharpened 4-0 monofilament nylon suture was inserted lightly into the internal carotid artery from the external carotid artery. Resistance appeared when the suture reached the bifurcation of the anterior and middle cerebral arteries. Then, we used the nylon suture further to puncture this bifurcation. Sham rats received the same surgical procedure without the puncture of the bifurcation. All rats were placed on a heating pad to maintain the body temperature at 37.5 °C measured by a rectal thermometer.
Experimental Design
Four separate experiments were conducted in this study. Experiment I. To determine the endogenous expression profiles, western blot assay was performed for MST1 in sham and SAH model for 2, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h ( n = 6 for each time point). In addition, double immunofluorescent staining was used to examine the localization of endogenous PCMT1 and MST1 in the left hemisphere of SAH rats ( n = 6). Experiment II. To assess the effect of an exogenous PCMT1 agonist (CGP 3466B) after SAH, neurobehavioral functions and brain water content were assessed at 24 and 72 h after the endovascular perforation. The rats were divided into the following three groups: sham, SAH + vehicle (saline), and SAH + CGP 3466B (0.14 mg/kg, subcutaneous injection 1 h after SAH) ( n = 6 each group). Experiment III. To detect changes in endogenous PCMT1, MST1, and active caspase 3 after the administration of CGP 3466B in SAH rats, western blotting was performed 24 h after the endovascular perforation. In addition, immunofluorescence was performed 24 h after the endovascular perforation to detect TUNEL-positive neuronal cells. Sham, SAH + vehicle (saline), and SAH + CGP 3466B (0.14 mg/kg) were measured with western blotting or immunofluorescence ( n = 12 each group). Experiment IV. Chelerythrine, an MST1 agonist that acts via caspase-dependent cleavage [ ], was formulated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Chelerythrine (1 mmol/L, 10 μL) [ ] was given immediately via intracerebroventricular administration after SAH. Calyculin A, another MST1 agonist that acts via enhancing autophosphorylation [ ], was dissolved in DMSO. Calyculin A (0.5 μmol/L, 10 μL) [ ] was given immediately via intracerebroventricular administration after SAH. Thirty rats were divided into the following five groups: sham, SAH + vehicle (saline, subcutaneous injection) + vehicle (DMSO, intracerebroventricular injection), SAH + CGP 3466B (0.14 mg/kg, subcutaneous injection) + vehicle (DMSO, intracerebroventricular injection), SAH + CGP 3466B (0.14 mg/kg, subcutaneous injection) + chelerythrine (1 mmol/L, 10 μL, intracerebroventricular injection), and SAH + CGP 3466B (0.14 mg/kg, subcutaneous injection) + calyculin A (0.5 μmol/L, 10 μL, intracerebroventricular injection) ( n = 6 each group). Western blotting was performed to detect several proteins, including PCMT1, MST1, cl-MST1, p-MST1, Bcl-2, Bax, and active caspase 3.
Neurobehavioral Function and Severity of SAH Assessment
We blindly assessed neurobehavioral function according to the previously reported Garcia Scoring System with modifications [ ]. Briefly, six tests were conducted to measure spontaneous activity, spontaneous movements of all limbs, response to vibrissae touch, climbing, forelimb stretching, and body proprioception. The SAH grading score was used to estimate the severity of the brain injury as described in previous studies [ ]. Briefly, the basal cistern was divided into six segments. Each segment was graded from 0 to 3, depending on the amount of bleeding. The total score of the SAH grade for each rat ranged from 0 to 18. We only included moderate-severe SAH rats (SAH grade ≥ 8 at 24 h) in this study.
Brain Water Content
Brain edema was detected by measuring the brain water content as previously described [ ]. The brain was separated into four parts, including the left hemisphere, right hemisphere, cerebellum, and brain stem. Immediately, each part was weighed (wet weight) and promptly dried for 72 h at 105 °C (dry weigh). The brain water content was calculated as follows: (wet weight − dry weight)/wet weight × 100%.
Western Blotting
Western blotting was performed as previously described [ ]. We extracted the proteins of left (puncture side) basal cortex in RIPA buffer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA). The primary antibodies that were used included PCMT1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-100977), MST1 (Cell Signaling Technology, CST#3682), p-MST1 (Thr183) (Cell Signaling Technology, CST#3681), active caspase 3 (Abcam, ab49822), Bcl-2 (Cell Signaling Technology, CST#2876), and Bax (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-493).
Immunofluorescence Staining
Immunofluorescence staining was performed as previously described [ ]. After 4% paraformaldehyde fixation and 30% sucrose solution dehydration, brain samples were frozen and cut into coronal frozen slices (slice thickness 8 μm) with a cryostat microtome (Leica CM3050S-3-1-1, Bannockburn, IL). Sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies, including PCMT1 (Sigma, HPA003239), MST1 (Biolegend, 611052), and NeuN (Abcam, ab177487 or ab104224), followed by the appropriate fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). In addition, TUNEL staining was performed according to the protocol from the manufacturer (Roche Inc., Basel, Switzerland). A fluorescence microscope (LSM-710; Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) was used to visualize the sections. The percent of TUNEL-positive neurons was calculated in a blinded manner.
Statistical Analysis
All data were expressed as the mean ± SD. The analyses were performed using SPSS version 22.0 (SPSS Inc.). One-way ANOVA analysis of the mean values followed by an LSD test was performed for multiple groups. A Mann-Whitney U test was used for the Garcia score and SAH grading score. Statistical significance was defined as P <0.05.

Endogenous PCMT1 and MST1 Were Coexpressed in the Cytoplasm of Neuronal Cells
Double immunofluorescent staining of PCMT1 and MST1 with neuronal specific nuclear protein (NeuN) indicated that both PCMT1 and MST1 were expressed in the cytoplasm of neuronal cells (Fig. 2 ). Moreover, double immunofluorescent staining of PCMT1 and MST1 demonstrated that PCMT1 and MST1 were coexpressed in neurons, respectively (Fig. 2 ).

Exogenous CGP 3466B Treatment Improved Neurological Function and Reduced Brain Edema at 24 and 72 h after SAH
Exogenous CGP 3466B (0.14 mg/kg) was subcutaneously applied 1 h after SAH. There were no differences in the SAH scores between the SAH rats receiving CGP 3466B and the SAH groups at 24 and 72 h ( P > 0.05, Fig. 3 b). SAH group rats had a significantly worse Garcia score at 24 and 72 h (13.17 vs. 16.78 at 24 h, P < 0.01; 11.67 vs. 17.33 at 72 h, P < 0.01; Fig. 3 a) and a higher ratio of brain water content in the left hemisphere (81.24% vs. 79.46% at 24 h, P < 0.05; 81.55% vs. 79.36% at 72 h, P < 0.01; Fig. 3 c) and cerebellum (80.63% vs. 79.65% at 24 h, P < 0.05; 81.20% vs. 79.29% at 72 h, P < 0.05; Fig. 3 c) compared to the sham group. SAH rats that received the CGP 3466B (0.14 mg/kg) treatment showed improved neurological function (15.67 vs. 13.17 at 24 h, P < 0.01; 14.83 vs. 11.67 at 72 h, P < 0.01; Fig. 3 a) and a significant decrease in brain water content in the left hemisphere (79.58% vs. 81.24% at 24 h, P < 0.05; 80.02% vs. 81.55% at 72 h, P < 0.05; Fig. 3 c) after SAH compared to the SAH group. In addition, no significant difference of brain edema was observed in the right hemisphere between SAH and sham groups at 24 h (80.00% vs. 79.45%, P < 0.05; Fig. 3 c), while a significant increase in brain edema was found in SAH rats compared with sham group at 72 h (80.86% vs. 79.25%, P < 0.01, Fig. 3 c). Brain water content in the right hemisphere was significantly reduced in SAH rats receiving CGP 3466B (0.14 mg/kg) compared to vehicle group at 72 h after SAH (79.63% vs. 80.86%, P < 0.05, Fig. 3 c).

Exogenous CGP 3466B Treatment Decreased Neuronal Apoptosis by Inhibiting the Caspase 3 Pathway
Immunofluorescence staining was applied to detect neuronal apoptosis 24 h after SAH. We observed that the percentage of TUNEL-positive neurons was 32.08 ± 4.11% in SAH rats that received vehicle compared to 2.97 ± 1.05% in the sham group ( P < 0.01, Figs. 3 d and 4 ). SAH rats that received CGP 3466B showed a significant decrease in TUNEL-positive neurons (13.73 ± 4.44%) compared to the SAH group ( P < 0.01, Figs. 3 d and 4 ). Western blotting was performed to examine different expression of PCMT1, MST1, and active caspase 3 among three parallel groups after SAH. The results showed a 64.82% decrease in the expression of PCMT1 ( P < 0.01, Fig. 5 a) and an 88.15% decrease in the expression of MST1 ( P < 0.01, Fig. 5 b), and there was over threefold increase in active caspase 3 ( P < 0.01, Fig. 5 c) in SAH rats that received vehicle compared to the sham group. SAH rats that received exogenous CGP 3466B treatment showed an over threefold increase in the expression of PCMT1 ( P < 0.01, Fig. 5 a) compared with SAH rats that received vehicle. Exogenous CGP 3466B even can upregulate the expression of PCMT1 to normal level as sham rats ( P > 0.05, Fig. 5 a). PCMT1 has been reported to inhibit the activity of MST1. Here, we observed that SAH rats receiving CGP 3466B showed a significant increase in the expression of MST1 ( P < 0.01, Fig. 5 b), but did not reach to normal level as sham group ( P > 0.05, Fig. 5 b). In addition, exogenous CGP 3466B decreased the level of active caspase 3 after SAH ( P < 0.01, Fig. 5 c).
Either Chelerythrine or Calyculin A Abolished the Effects of CGP 3466B on Inhibiting SAH-Induced Apoptosis
Chelerythrine could activate MST1 via caspase-dependent cleavage, and calyculin A activates the full-length form of MST1 through phosphorylation. In this part, we tested whether the anti-apoptotic effect of PCMT1 depend on inhibiting the activity of MST1. Exogenous CGP 3466B treatment showed a significant improvement in Garcia score compared with SAH group ( P < 0.05, Fig. 6 a). Chelerythrine and calyculin A could reverse the neuroprotective effect of PCMT1 in Garcia score, respectively ( P < 0.05, Fig. 6 a). Both chelerythrine and calyculin A have no effects on the expression of PCMT1 ( P > 0.05, Fig. 6 b). Due to the activity of MST1 by chelerythrine or calyculin A, the full-length form of MST1 showed a significant decrease in both groups that received MST1 agonists ( P < 0.05, Fig. 6 c). Correspondingly, the expression of cl-MST1 was upregulated in SAH rats that received CGP 3466B and chelerythrine compared with those SAH rats only receiving CGP 3466B ( P < 0.05, Fig. 7 a). The expression of p-MST1 increased in SAH rats that received CGP 3466B and calyculin A ( P < 0.01, Fig. 7 b). These two MST1 agonists, chelerythrine and calyculin A, reversed the anti-apoptotic effect of CGP 3446B. SAH rats that received CGP 3466B plus chelerythrine or calyculin A significantly increased active caspase 3 ( P < 0.05, Fig. 6 d) and Bax expression ( P < 0.05, Fig. 7 d), and decreased Bcl-2 ( P < 0.05, Fig. 7 c) compared to SAH rats that received CGP 3466B plus vehicle.
Discussion
This study aims to investigate the role of PCMT1 in anti-apoptosis via the regulation of MST1 activity during early brain injury after SAH. We demonstrated that PCMT1 and MST1 were coexpressed in the cytoplasm of neurons. The exogenous PCMT1 agonist, CGP 3466B, reduced brain edema, decreased neuronal apoptosis, and improved neurological function. The upregulated expression of PCMT1 inhibited the production of cl-MST1 and p-MST1, altering apoptosis-related proteins, including Bcl-2, Bax, and active Caspase 3. However, exogenous chelerythrine and calyculin A, respectively, enhanced MST1 cleavage and MST1 autophosphorylation, weakened the effect of PCMT1 on improving neurological function, and inhibited neuronal apoptosis after SAH. Therefore, PCMT1/MST1 pathway might be an alternative therapeutic target for alleviating early brain injury after SAH.
In our study, we observed that PCMT1 and MST1 were coexpressed in the cytoplasm of neuronal cells after SAH. This finding was consistent with previous studies. PCMT1 was reported as a ubiquitously expressed protein in various tissues ranging from bacteria to humans, but it was particularly abundant in the brain [ ]. Moreover, the substantia nigra pars compacta, the locus coeruleus, and the paraventricular nucleus were confirmed to be areas with high PCMT1 expression in the brain [ ]. MST1 was also detected in neurons and found to mediate oxidative stress-induced neuronal cell apoptosis [ ]. Based on these findings, PCMT1 and MST1 might have important roles in neuronal activities.
Neuronal apoptosis was a major effect of early brain injury after SAH [ , ]. PCMT1 has been reported to be a protective agent against dopamine- [ ], hypoxia- [ ], or H 2 O 2 -induced [ ] cell apoptosis. MST1 is a pro-apoptotic protein that acts by enhancing the cleavage of caspase-3 in multiple neurological disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [ ] and Alzheimer’s disease [ ]. Immunoprecipitation of PCMT1 and MST1 has shown that Flag-PCMT1 binds to the N-terminal fragment of MST1 in HEK293 cells [ ]. Thus, we hypothesized that PCMT1 suppresses the activity of MST1 to reduce neuronal apoptosis after SAH. Previous studies in a myocardial ischemia model determined that PCMT1 reduces the activity of MST1 but does not influence the amount of MST1 [ ]. The present study showed a significant decrease in MST1 in rats suffering from SAH and a remarkable increase in MST1 in CGP-3466B-treated SAH rats. However, the total amount of MST1 and cl-MST1 showed a similar level among the parallel experiment groups. This result indicated that PCMT1 inhibited the transformation from MST1 to cl-MST1, but did not alter protein expression. In addition, the present study showed that the expression of cl-MST1 and MST1 autophosphorylation markedly increased 24 h after SAH. Previous studies have confirmed that cl-MST1 translocates into the nucleus and induces apoptotic cell death [ ]. MST1 autophosphorylation has been regarded as an important enhancer for caspase cleavage that results in powerful amplification of apoptotic responses [ ]. These results indicate that MST1-induced apoptosis might play an important role in early brain injury after SAH. CGP 3466B has been used as an anti-Parkinson’s drug with anti-apoptotic effects that act by enhancing PCMT1 expression in neurons both in in vivo and in vitro studies [ , ]. Previous studies indicated that CGP 3466B significantly increased the level of PCMT1 mRNA and protein in cardiomyocytes [ ]. Overexpression of PCMT1 induced by CGP 3466B could inhibit neuronal apoptosis. However, this anti-apoptotic effect of CGP 3466B was markedly attenuated in PCMT1 specific siRNA transfected cells [ ]. In addition, subcutaneously CGP 3466B can pass through the blood-brain barrier [ ], which has been observed in both rodent and primate models of Parkinson’s disease [ ]. In the present study, PCMT1 expression increased after exogenous CGP 3466B administration. Upregulated expression of PCMT1 reduced neuronal apoptosis and alleviated brain edema. Moreover, decreases in cl-MST1 and p-MST1 were also observed in the CGP-3466B-treated SAH rats. These findings were consistent with previous studies in which CGP 3466B upregulated PCMT1 and subsequently inhibited the action of MST1 in cardiomyocytes subjected to hypoxic injury [ ]. This neuroprotective effect was reversed by chelerythrine and calyculin A. However, it should be noted that chelerythrine and calyculin A are not special agonists of MST1. Chelerythrine is a potent protein kinase C inhibitor [ ] and calyculin A is a serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor [ ], thus they both have several targets. Although previous studies have demonstrated that chelerythrine could activate MST1 via caspase-dependent cleavage, and calyculin A activates the full-length form of MST1 through phosphorylation [ ], chelerythrine and calyculin A may lead to apoptosis through other pathways in our study.
Several limitations should be noted in this present study. One, the present study was the lack of direct evidence of an interaction between PCMT1 and MST1. Previous coimmunoprecipitation tests have shown that PCMT1 directly binds to MST1 [ ]; however, we cannot exclude another possibility that the reversal of anti-apoptotic effect of PCMT1 by chelerythrine or calyculin A may instead be simply the agonist function of an independent, deleterious pathway. Second, we did not study the effects of different drug administration on the rats’ cerebral blood flow, which may affect the outcomes. Finally, the long-term role of PCMT1/MST1 pathway in SAH-induced brain injury further needs to be investigated.
In conclusion, our study found that the agonist of endogenous PCMT1 inhibited neuronal apoptosis by reducing MST1 phosphorylation and the level of cl-MST1. PCMT1/MST1 might be an alternative therapeutic target for alleviating the symptoms of early brain injury after SAH.
