INTRODUCTION
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is one of the most prevalent skin conditions, affecting mainly children ( ). AD has a complex pathophysiology, related to impaired skin barrier function and immune dysregulation ( ). Pruritus is considered one of the most crucial symptoms of AD. It can substantially affect the patient’s quality of life ( ).
There is no ultimate cure for AD so far, but there is a multi-faceted approach to the alleviation of the symptoms. The treatment plan includes the use of emollients—to aid in skin hydration—and topical anti-inflammatory medications ( ).
Topical corticosteroids are considered as a cornerstone in the treatment plan. They can efficiently relieve pruritus due to their potent anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative effect. However, the chronic use of topical corticosteroids may cause a series of adverse effects due to systemic infiltration such as glaucoma or even Cushing’s syndrome in severe cases ( ).
Beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) is a highly potent topical corticosteroid with remarkable anti-inflammatory activity. It is available in the market as a cream with an oily base, as BDP exhibits very poor water solubility. The main issue with commercial formulations is their limited ability to successfully deliver BDP into the skin without procuring high systemic levels or causing any impairments to the skin barrier function ( ).
The main aim of this work is to develop a drug delivery system such as mixed micelles (MX) which could deliver BDP into the skin layers with negligible systemic effects.
MX are nanocarriers usually composed of a mixture of amphiphilic co-polymers combined above their critical micelle concentration in an aqueous medium ( ). Triblock co-polymers are widely used to form micelles having high stability and solubilization capacity. They are composed of poly(ethylene oxide) and poly(propylene oxide) blocks arranged in a standard conformation PEO–PPO–PEO ( ).
The common application of MX in the pharmaceutical field is enhancing the bioavailability of oral poorly soluble drugs or enhancing the solubility of intravenous drugs. However, MX can also be utilized to enhance the stratum corneum penetration and drug deposition into the dermis.
The encapsulation into MX could lead to an increase in the solubility, local concentration, and thermodynamic activity constituting a driving force for the drug to penetrate the stratum corneum ( ). Moreover, MX could actually get dismantled so that the individual polymer chains would facilitate stratum corneum penetration by acting as chemical enhancers ( ).
An important consideration in case of topical formulations is their convenient application and biocompatibility. Hydrogels are composed of hydrophilic polymers, which could be applied to the skin without causing irritation or systemic side effects due to their elastic nature ( ). This is particularly advantageous for AD patients suffering from skin inflammation.
Based on the previously mentioned challenges and requirements, the aim of the current study was to statistically optimize BDP loaded mixed micelles, followed by the incorporation of the optimal MX formula into hydroxypropyl methylcellulose hydrogel. The prepared hydrogel was subjected to ex vivo evaluation study, where the amount deposited into and through the skin was measured to predict the drug concentration accumulated locally into the skin and the systemic side effects, respectively. Moreover, in vivo evaluation study using an animal model followed by histopathological evaluation was performed to compare the time required for the healing of sub-chronic dermatitis in case of both the hydrogel and Beclozone®.

Experimental Design
A 3 2 ·2 1 full factorial design (FFD) was employed to statistically optimize the formulation variables of BDP polymeric micelles in order to achieve micelles of high entrapment efficiency (%EE), small particle size (PS), high zeta potential (ZP), and small polydispersity index (PDI). Generation and evaluation of the experimental design was carried out using the Design Expert® software (version 7; Stat-Ease Inc., Minneapolis, MN). According to the followed factorial design, 18 formulae were prepared. Each formula was performed twice in two separate replicates giving a total of 36 runs. PL-L121 was utilized with either P84 or PL-F127. The independent variables were Poloxamer type (A), percentage of PL-L121 in nanomicellar mixtures (B), and ratio of the total mixture of surfactants to the drug (C), whereas dependent variables were %EE (Y 1 ), PS (Y 2 ), ZP (Y 3 ), and PDI (Y 4 ) as shown in Table I . The composition of the 18 formulae listed in standard order is shown in Table II . Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out to estimate the significance of the model. Probability p values ( p < 0.05) denoted significance.

Preparation of BDP-Loaded MX by Thin-Film Hydration Technique
A mixture of BDP (10 mg) and different weights of PL-L121 with either P84 or PL-F127—according to the previously mentioned design—was dissolved in acetone (10 ml) in a round-bottom flask. The solvent was subsequently evaporated at 60°C under reduced pressure using a rotary vacuum evaporator at 150 rpm to obtain a thin dry film of either BDP/PL-L121/P84 or BDP/PL-L121/PL-F127 on the flask wall. The resulted film was then hydrated using 10 ml distilled water under normal pressure for 1 h. Unincorporated drug aggregates were removed by filtration through 0.45 μm membrane filter and a solution of BDP polymeric micelles was obtained.
In Vitro Characterization of the Prepared BDP-Loaded MX
Determination of BDP Entrapment Efficiency
The amount of entrapped BDP was determined spectrophotometrically at λ max 241.6 nm (Shimadzu UV-1601 PC, Kyoto, Japan). The λ max was determined after spectrophotometric scanning of BDP dissolved in 60:40 mixture of distilled water/ethanol. The analysis of the solution obtained from separation of the unincorporated BDP was done after appropriate dilution with ethanol. BDP concentration was determined by comparing the absorbance of the filtered solution to a preconstructed drug calibration curve in 60:40 mixture of distilled water/ethanol ( R 2 = 0.9999, n = 3). Each experiment was carried out in triplicate and the mean value was deduced. The EE% was calculated according to Eq. ( 1 ): $$ \mathrm{EE}\%=\left(\mathrm{weight}\ \mathrm{of}\ \mathrm{drug}\ \mathrm{in}\ \mathrm{micelles}/\mathrm{weight}\ \mathrm{of}\ \mathrm{drug}\ \mathrm{used}\ \mathrm{in}\ \mathrm{micelles}\ \mathrm{preparation}\right)\times 100 $$ (1)
PS and ZP Analysis of BDP-Loaded MX
A definite volume of the BDP-loaded MX was diluted with deionized water (1:10) then subjected to dynamic light scattering (DLS) for determination of PS, ZP, and PDI using Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern 126 Instrument Ltd., Worcestershire, UK). DLS measures the intensity of the light scattered due to the Brownian motion of particles which is affected by the size of these particles ( ).
Formulation Optimization
After applying constraints on EE%, PS, ZP, and PDI as shown in Table I , two formulae were chosen using the Design Expert® software. The nanomicellar mixture in one formula was composed of PL-L121/P84 while in the other was composed of PL-L121/PL-F127. The suggested formulae were then prepared and evaluated in triplicates to check the validity of the optimal formulation factors and predicted responses given by the software. Ex vivo studies were performed on both formulae.
Characterization of the Two Chosen Formulae
Determination of %EE
The EE% of the chosen BDP polymeric micelles formulae was determined as previously described. The residual between the predicted and observed responses was calculated. The confidence intervals for the predicted values were calculated in order to demonstrate the validity of the optimization and prediction processes.
PS and ZP Analysis
The determination of PS, ZP, and PDI of the selected BDP formulae was carried out adopting the same technique previously mentioned. The residual values and confidence intervals were also calculated.
Ex Vivo Study
The skin used was obtained from newly born CD-1 mice (6 days). The experiment protocol (PI 1488) was approved by the research ethics committee of Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo University and was in accordance with the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International expectations for animal care and use/ethics committees. The animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation which is considered acceptable for mice less than 7 days old. The scarification was performed by professionally trained individuals and was done according to the AAALAC International’s Council on Accreditation “AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals: 2013 Edition” ( ).
The underlying cartilage was removed and then the skin was excised. The skin was washed with normal saline then dried between two filter papers. It was then stored in a freezer at − 21°C for 1 week.
At the start of the experiment, the skin was examined for any incisions or deformities using a magnifying lens. Then it was anchored on a plastic syringe, which was cut from both sides, and fixed using a rubber band. The skin was in contact with the receiving compartment, while the stratum corneum was facing the donor compartment ( ).
The area of the skin was 0.785 cm 2 . The experiment was performed three times and the results were displayed as the mean values ± standard deviation. The receiving compartment was composed of 45 ml ethanol/water 1:1 ( v / v ) to ensure sink conditions. It was stirred throughout the entire experiment using a magnetic stirrer set at 100 rpm and the temperature was maintained at 37°C.
A known weight of formulae containing an equivalent amount of 0.64 mg of BDP was applied to the stratum corneum. Aliquots of 1 ml were withdrawn at predetermined time intervals (0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 h). The permeated drug was analyzed using HPLC.
The assay was performed using an HPLC apparatus consisting of 600E pump, 996 photodiode array detector (PDA detector), and 717 Plus autosampler coupled with Millennium 32 software, version 4.0 (Waters, USA). BDP was separated using Nova-Pak® C18 150 mm × 4 mm stationary phase (Waters, USA) at room temperature and λ max 254 nm. Peak retention time was 5 min and the calibration curve was constructed from integrated peak area using known concentrations of standards. This method was shown to be “fit for purpose” in terms of accuracy, precision, and linearity ( R 2 = 0.9994) ( , ).
At the end of the permeation experiment, the skin was demounted from the set up and washed with saline for 20 s to remove any residual drug. Then the skin was cut into small pieces and placed into a capped vial containing 5 ml of ethanol for drug extraction. The solution was vortexed for 5 min and soaked for 24 h to allow the efficient extraction of BDP from the skin. After 24 h, the solution was vortexed for 15 min, sonicated for 90 min, and then centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min. Finally, the solution was filtered through a membrane filter (0.45 μm) and analyzed using HPLC to determine the amount of dug deposited into the skin ( ).
The cumulative amount of the drug permeated (μg/cm 2 ) was plotted against time. The drug flux at 6 h ( J max ) was calculated using the following equation: $$ {J}_{\mathrm{max}}=\mathrm{amount}\ \mathrm{of}\ \mathrm{permeated}\ \mathrm{drug}/\left(\mathrm{area}\ \mathrm{of}\ \mathrm{membrane}\times \mathrm{time}\right) $$ (2)
Finally, local accumulation efficiency (LAC) values for BDP were calculated by dividing the amount of the drug deposited into the skin by the total amount permeated at the end of the experiment.
Statistical Analysis
Two-group comparison was conducted by one-way ANOVA using SPSS 17® statistical software. Differences were considered to be statistically significant when p < 0.05.
Morphological Examination, Physicochemical Stability Study, and Hydrogel Preparation of the Optimized BDP-Loaded MX
The optimized formula resulting from ex vivo studies was morphologically characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), subjected to a physicochemical stability study and finally was formulated as a hydrogel for ex vivo and in vivo evaluation.
TEM
A drop of the optimal formula was placed onto a carbon-coated copper grid, leaving a thin liquid film. The samples were stained using 2% phospho-tungstic acid aqueous solution. The films were then viewed on a Jeol TEM and photographed ( ).
Physicochemical Stability Study
The optimal formula was stored in a sealed glass vial at 25°C for 3 months, and by the end of the storage period, samples were examined for their clarity, EE%, and PS.
Preparation of Hydrogel-Loaded BDP MX
HPMC hydrogel was prepared by dissolving 200 mg HPMC in 10 ml of the optimal formula at 50°C using a magnetic stirrer and then was air dried to remove the air bubbles ( , ).
In Vitro Characterization of the Prepared Hydrogel
Evaluation of the Rheological Properties of the Prepared Hydrogel
The rheological properties of the hydrogel were evaluated using cone and plate viscometer (Brookfield viscometer; type DVT-2). The temperature of the plate was kept at 35 ± 0.1°C by coupling it to a thermostatic water bath. One-gram sample of the tested gel was added to the plate. The speed settings were adjusted over a range of 0.5 to 100 rpm with 10 s prior to each speed alteration. Results were obtained only when the torque was within the acceptable range (10–100%).
The rate of shear was increased uniformly and the viscosity was detected from the instrument readings. The results were fitted to the power-law constitutive equation ( ): Open image in new window (3) where ɽ is shear stress, c is shear rate, and m and n are power-law model constants. “ m ” is a measure of the fluid consistency, and “ n ” measures the degree of non-Newtonian nature. The farther the value of “ n ” from one, the more prominent the degree of the non-Newtonian characteristics of the fluid is.
Several equations (Bingham, Casson, and Carreau) were employed to identify the type of the non-Newtonian system by comparing their regression coefficients. Bingham equation was used to describe the linear plastic system:
Open image in new window (4) where ɽ ○ is the yield value. Casson equation was employed to describe the non-linear plastic system:
Open image in new window (5) While pseudoplastic shear thinning systems were described by Carreau’s equation:
$$ \left(\mbox{\fontencoding{U}\fontfamily{phon}\selectfont\char110} -{\mbox{\fontencoding{U}\fontfamily{phon}\selectfont\char110}}_{\infty}\right)/\left({\mbox{\fontencoding{U}\fontfamily{phon}\selectfont\char110}}_{\bigcirc }-{\mbox{\fontencoding{U}\fontfamily{phon}\selectfont\char110}}_{\infty}\right)=\Big(1/{\left(1+{\left({k}_c\right)}^2\right)}^{\mathrm{m}/2} $$ (6) where n ○ and ɳ ∞ indicate viscosity values at lowest and highest shear rate values, respectively, K is a constant parameter with the dimension of time (1/ K is the rate of shear at which viscosity begins to decrease), and m is a dimensionless constant referring to the degree of pseudoplasticity. The parameters n ○ , ɳ ∞ , and K could be calculated from the shear rate–viscosity curve ( ).
Ex Vivo Evaluation of the Prepared Hydrogel and Comparison to the Brand Product
An accurate weight of the hydrogel and the commercial formula containing an equivalent amount of 0.64 mg of BDP was applied to the stratum corneum. The commercial formula used for comparative studies was Beclozone® cream, where each gram contains 0.25 mg of BDP. The conditions of the ex vivo evaluation study were the same as described before.
In Vivo Evaluation of the Anti-Inflammatory Effect of the Prepared Hydrogel Compared to a Commercial Product Using an Animal Model
Experimental design and treatment of animals were approved by the Faculty of Pharmacy Cairo University Research Ethics Committee, Cairo, Egypt (serial number of the protocol PI 1488).
Experimental Design
Thirty-six male adult Wister rats (220–280 g) were divided into four groups. The animals were kept in individual cages under well-defined and standardized conditions (humidity- and temperature-controlled room; 12-h light and 12-h dark cycle).
Three rats were randomly assigned as a negative control treated with acetone (group I); three other rats were randomly assigned as a positive control treated with a phorbol ester, TPA (group II). The remaining 30 rats were divided into two groups (15 rats per group). Group III was treated with Beclozone® cream and group IV was treated with the prepared hydrogel.
At day zero, each rat was anesthetized using 50 mg/kg ketamine hydrochloride in addition to 5 mg/kg diazepam intramuscular injection. The removal of hair from rat dorsum was done using a hair removal cream. TPA (200 μl of 0.01% solution in acetone) was applied to each rat’s dorsum over an area of 6 cm 2 (groups II, III, and IV); the negative control group (group I) was treated with acetone only ( ).
The application of TPA was continued for 6 days to achieve a sub-chronic dermatitis animal model ( ). After 6 days, the treatments were applied to the affected rats’ dorsum in both groups (III and IV) twice daily with a layer thickness of about 4–6 mm. Following the humane scarification under the same dose of anesthesia previously mentioned, skin samples were excised from three rats of the two treated groups at days 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12.The skin samples from the first two groups were excised at day 12. The skin samples were histopathologically examined to assess the anti-inflammatory activity where time was considered as the factor judging the healing capacity of both the hydrogel and Beclozone® cream. The bodies and the remains of rats were frozen and transferred to be incinerated at Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Cairo University.
Histopathological Examination
Autopsy samples were excised from the skin of rats in different groups and fixed in 10% formol saline for 24 h. The samples’ washing was done using tap water and then serial dilutions of alcohol (methyl, ethyl, and absolute ethyl) were used for dehydration. Specimens were cleared in xylene and immersed in paraffin at 56°C in a hot-air oven for 24 h. Paraffin beeswax tissue blocks were prepared for sectioning at 4 μm thickness by sledge microtome. The obtained tissue sections were preserved on glass slides, deparaffinized, and then stained by hematoxylin and eosin for examination utilizing the light electric microscope ( ).
RESULTS
Statistical Analysis of the 32·21 FFD for BDP Polymeric Micelle Formulation
EE%, PS, ZP, and PDI were selected as the response variables. Each response was analyzed individually and fitted to linear, two-factor interaction and quadratic models using linear regression. In the present study, the highest order unaliased model with the highest prediction R 2 and lowest predicted residual error sum of squares (PRESS) was the one of choice. Further improvement of the chosen model was achieved through model reduction by removing any non-significant model terms that were not needed to support hierarchy.
Statistical Analysis of EE%
The quadratic model was the highest order unaliased model. The EE% of the prepared BDP MX formulae ranged from 6.28 ± 1.02% (M12) to 99.79 ± 0.01% (M1) as shown in Table II . ANOVA was done to determine the significant terms of the quadratic model affecting the EE%. The final equation relating different factors and interactions for EE% in terms of coded variables is as follows: $$ \mathrm{EE}\%=51.05+10.41\mathrm{A}+12.88\mathrm{B}+19.5\mathrm{C}-4.85\mathrm{AB}-9.9\mathrm{BC}+16.43{\mathrm{B}}^2 $$ (7)
Statistical analysis using quadratic model showed that all three factors (A, B, and C) had a significant effect on EE% ( p < 0.05).
Statistical Analysis of PS
The quadratic model was the highest order unaliased model. The PS of the prepared BDP MX formulae ranged from 48.5 ± 6.29 nm (M1) to 2474 ± 84.85 nm (M2) as shown in Table II . ANOVA was done to determine the significant terms of the quadratic model on PS. The final equation relating different factors and interactions for PS in terms of coded variables is as follows: $$ \mathrm{PS}=509.25+98.34\mathrm{A}+96.4\mathrm{B}+9.99\mathrm{C}+59.67\mathrm{AB}+151.65{\mathrm{B}}^2-391.{\mathrm{C}}^2 $$ (8)
Poloxamer type and PL-L121 percentage had a significant quadratic effect on PS.
Statistical Analysis of ZP and PDI
The quadratic model was the highest order unaliased model. The ZP of the prepared BDP MX formulae ranged from − 12.3 ± 0.707 mV (M1) to − 30.4 ± 0.14 mV (M15) as shown in Table II . ANOVA was done to determine the significant terms of the quadratic model regarding ZP. The final equation relating different factors and interactions for ZP in terms of coded variables is as follows: $$ \mathrm{ZP}=-24.17-0.91\mathrm{B}+5.61\mathrm{C}-1.57\mathrm{BC}+2.66{\mathrm{C}}^2 $$ (9)
Surfactant mixture-to-drug ratio (factor C) was the only factor having a significant quadratic effect on ZP. No factor was found to have a statistically significant influence on PDI.
Formulation Optimization
After applying constrains on EE%, PS, ZP, and PDI, BDP polymeric micelles with the highest EE% and ZP and the smallest PS and PDI were obtained. Several solutions (factors’ levels combinations) were found by the Design Expert® software. Two formulae were selected: a formula prepared using PL-L121/P84 surfactant mixture (M1) and the other was prepared using PL-L121/PL-F127 surfactant mixture (M10). The overall desirability value of M1 was 0.966 and that of M10 was 0.864.
After the suggested BDP polymeric micelles formulae were prepared and evaluated, the residual between the predicted and observed responses was calculated. The residual appeared to be small, demonstrating the validity of the optimization process. The predicted and observed values for the chosen BDP polymeric micelles formulae (M1 and M10) are shown in Table III . The confidence intervals for the predicted values were calculated in order to demonstrate the validity of the optimization and prediction processes and are shown in Table III .

Ex Vivo Permeation and Drug Deposition Studies
The results of the skin permeation studies of M1 and M10 are shown in Fig. 1 a. The amount of the drug permeated in case of M1 was 541.76 ± 20.71 which is significantly higher than that of M10 which was 81.11 ± 4.96 ( p < 0.05). M1 showed a flux of 90.29 ± 0.59 μg/cm 2 h which was significantly higher than M10 that showed a flux of 13.52 ± 0.83 μg/cm 2 h ( p < 0.05). Fig. 1 a Ex vivo permeation profiles through mice skin of BDP from M1 and M10, b ex vivo permeation profiles through mice skin of BDP from GM10 and Beclozone, and c relationship between shear rate (S.R.) and viscosity of GM10
At the end of the experiment, the amount of BDP retained into the skin after 6 h in case of M1 and M10 was 366.89 ± 10.58 and 632.52 ± 15.59 μg/cm 2 , respectively. The amount retained in M10 was significantly higher than M1 ( p < 0.05).
The calculated LAC ratio was found to be in case of M1 0.67, while that of M10 was 7.79.
Morphological Examination, Physicochemical Stability Study, and Hydrogel Preparation of the Optimized BDP-Loaded MX
As M10 showed the lowest flux and the highest LAC ratio, it was subjected to further studies.
TEM
Photomicrographs of the optimized BDP-loaded polymeric micelles (M10) are illustrated in Fig. 2 . It is clear that the developed micelles formed homogeneous small-sized spherical micellar structures with a smooth surface. Fig. 2 Transmission electron micrograph of M10
Physicochemical Stability Study
After 3 months, the samples remained clear without any apparent aggregation. The measured EE% and PS were 73.2 ± 2.63% and 130.4 ± 10.35 nm, respectively. There was no significant difference ( p < 0.05) between EE% and PS of the stored samples when compared to the freshly prepared ones.
In Vitro Characterization of the Prepared Hydrogel
Evaluation of the Rheological Properties of the Prepared Hydrogel
The gel viscosity decreases with the shear rate as shown in Fig. 1 c, indicating a shear thinning flow. The flow index deduced from the power law equation was 0.41. Fitting the data into the three equations (Carreau, Casson, and Bingham), the calculated regression coefficient was 0.994, 0.974, and 0.993, respectively.
Ex Vivo Evaluation of the Prepared Hydrogel and Comparison to the Brand Product
The results of the skin permeation studies of M10 gel (GM10) and Beclozone® cream are shown in Fig. 1 b.
The amount of the drug permeated in case of Beclozone® was 661.12 ± 58.8 which is significantly higher than that of GM10 (55.78 ± 0.62) ( p < 0.05). The commercial formula showed a flux at 6 h of 110.41 ± 9.8 μg/cm 2 h, which is significantly higher than GM10 that showed a flux of 9.29 ± 0.17 μg/cm 2 h ( p < 0.05).
At the end of the experiment, the amount of BDP retained into the skin after 6 h in case of the commercial formula was 170.14 ± 30.92 μg/cm 2 , while that of GM10 was 545.84 ± 5.62 μg/cm 2 . The amount retained in case of the commercial formula was significantly lower than in case of GM10 ( p < 0.05).
The calculated LAC ratio was found to be in case of GM10 9.78 which was significantly higher ( p < 0.05) than Beclozone® having a LAC ratio of 0.25.

DISCUSSION
Statistical Analysis of the 32·21 FFD for BDP Polymeric Micelle Formulation
Statistical Analysis of EE%
Solubilization of BDP could be achieved using micelles of an amphiphilic polymer such as PL-L121. The drug would be incorporated in the hydrophobic core; meanwhile, the hydrophilic corona would provide dispersion stability by preventing micelle–micelle interaction ( ). However, the hydrophilic segment of PL-L121 constitutes only 10% of its molecular weight; therefore, it does not provide sufficient steric hindrance and stability ( ). The combination of a hydrophobic pluronic (with a low HLB) with a hydrophilic one (with a higher HLB) would result in a higher kinetic stability. Two amphiphilic polymers were used in combination with PL-L121 (HLB = 1), which were P84 (HLB = 18.5) and PL-F127 (HLB = 22) ( , ) .
Poloxamer type had a significant effect on the EE% ( p < 0.0001). A higher amount of BDP was entrapped in case of polymeric micelles of P84 and PL-L121 in comparison with PL-F127 and PL-121. Despite the fact that P84 possess only 43 hydrophobic PPO units compared to PL-F127 which possess 65 hydrophobic PPO units, P84 can be considered more hydrophobic than PL-F127 ( ). The hydrophobicity of P84 is contributed to the smaller PEO region (38 units). This smaller PEO region facilitates the incorporation of BDP into the hydrophobic core, resulting in higher entrapment. On the other hand, PL-F127 has a longer PEO region acting as a steric barrier and hindering the movement of BDP into the hydrophobic core ( ).
Besides, the solubilization of a hydrophobic drug in the core of polymeric micelles is related to the HLB of the polymers forming the micelles. The lower the HLB of the polymers, the higher is the amount of the drug entrapped in the micelles ( ). In this case, P84 has a lower HLB than PL-F127; therefore, a higher EE% is observed in case of P84.
With respect to factor B (% of PL-L121), increasing the % of PL-L121 in the nanomicellar mixture led to an increase in the %EE, evidently showing that PL-L121 had a much better solubilization capacity than PL-F127 or P84 ( , ).
This can be attributed to the fact that PL-L121 is more hydrophobic than P84 or PL-F127. Therefore, it offers a suitable medium for BDP solubilization due to the hydrophobic interaction between the drug and the PPO fraction of PL-L121 as explained by the London dispersive forces ( ). That is when a hydrophobic drug is dispersed in water, the mutual attraction (London dispersive force) between the drug and the PPO fraction is higher than that between the drug and water ( ). A more hydrophobic pluronic with a higher PPO/PEO ratio will offer a higher solubilization capacity for hydrophobic drugs, leading to a higher %EE ( ).
The positive coefficient of term C in Eq. ( 7 ) indicates that increasing the surfactant mixture-to-drug ratio led to an increase in the %EE. At low surfactant mixture-to-drug ratio, the amount of micelles formed was not able to solubilize the entire amount of the drug in the formula ( ). On the other hand, a larger number of micelles were formed at high surfactant mixture-to-drug ratio causing an increase in the %EE ( , ).
The %EE value of 99.7% observed at a surfactant mixture-to-drug ratio (50:1) indicates the ability of the pluronic micelles to solubilize the entire amount of the drug in the formula. As the poloxamer amount increased, the opportunity of interaction—in the form of hydrogen bond—between the hydroxyl group of BDP and the ether oxygen of PEO chains of the pluronics also increased ( , ).
The negative coefficient of term BC in Eq. ( 7 ) indicates a significant negative interaction between PL-L121 percentage and surfactant mixture-to-drug ratio ( p < 0.0001) for EE%. At low surfactant mixture-to-drug ratio, increasing PL-L121 percentage leads to a significant increase in the EE%. However, at higher surfactant mixture-to-drug ratio, increasing the PL-L121 percentage has a lower effect on EE%.
Statistical Analysis of PS
A smaller particle size was observed in case of PL-F127 compared to P84 due to the difference in HLB and length of PEO chains of both polymers.
PL-F127 has a higher HLB and a longer PEO outer shell. This outer shell could serve as an efficient steric barrier against the micelle–micelle assembly resulting from the hydrophobic interaction between the micelles’ core ( , ). This may lead to a more stable system with a smaller PS ( , ). A longer PEO chain, in case of PL-F127, could also hinder the formation of large PL-L121 aggregates ( ). From that, it can be concluded that the outer shell of PL-F127 is more efficient in preventing micelle aggregation than that of P84. Moreover, the higher entrapment in case of P84 can contribute to a larger PS compared to PL-F127.
The positive coefficient of term B in Eq. ( 8 ) indicates that increasing the PL-L121% was associated with a significant increase in the PS. As previously demonstrated, increasing PL-L121% was associated with an increase in the amount of BDP entrapped into the hydrophobic core. Higher entrapment may lead to an increase in the particle size of the micelles ( , , ). Moreover, at high %PL-L121, the tendency of PL-L121 to separate forming larger aggregates in the aqueous milieu is higher due to the inability of the existing PEO chains to sterically hinder this aggregation, consequently a significant increase in the particle size was observed ( ).
Statistical Analysis of ZP and PDI
The positive coefficient of term C in Eq. ( 9 ) indicates that increasing the surfactant mixture-to-drug ratio was associated with a significant increase in the ZP to a more positive value ( p < 0.0001).
BDP is a carboxylic acid derivative that undergoes ionization in aqueous environment resulting in an overall negative charge. Increasing the surfactant mixture-to-drug ratio may cause a higher drug entrapment, shielding the negative charge and causing a more positive zeta potential ( ). Also increasing the amount of pluronics would increase the amount of PEO chains which may lead to shifting the shear plane at which zeta potential is measured producing a more positive zeta potential ( ).
Formulation Optimization
Ex Vivo Permeation and Drug Deposition Studies
The difference between the two MX formulae (M1 and M10) may be explained on the basis of the variations in PS. M1 showed a PS of 48.9 nm, which could possibly facilitate the diffusion through skin layers into the systemic circulation.
The Lower LAC ratio in case of M1 compared to M10 is due to the higher amount permeated per unit area as the LAC ratio measures the amount retained versus the amount permeated.
In Vitro Characterization of the Prepared Hydrogel
Evaluation of the Rheological Properties of the Prepared Hydrogel
The flow index deduced was smaller than one, therefore indicating a non-Newtonian, shear thinning behavior. Carreau’s equation yielded the highest regression coefficient; therefore, the produced gel exhibited a pseudoplastic flow.
Ex Vivo Evaluation of the Prepared Hydrogel and Comparison to the Brand Product
Based on drug permeation studies, J max and LAC, it can be concluded that the GM10 achieved a successful delivery into the skin with a high amount retained into the skin compared to the low amount permeated into the systemic circulation, when compared to Beclozone®.
There are several theories postulated to shed light on the reason behind the capability of MX to enhance skin deposition. Some studies assumed that the polymeric micelles segregate, leaving the individual polymers to act as chemical penetration enhancers. Others attributed the increase in skin deposition to an increase in contact area and in the ability of the micelles to accumulate in skin appendages. Therefore, micelles may serve as a reservoir from which the drug can infiltrate into different skin layers ( , ).
Bachhav et al . found that econazole delivery using mixed micelles enhanced its skin deposition by increasing the surface area and contact time allowing the mixed micelles to act as a depot for the drug molecules ( ).
Therefore, the management of the right combination of PS, ZP, and an optimum entrapment can lead to a significant enhancement in skin deposition and a decrease in the unwanted systemic side effects.
In Vivo Evaluation of the Anti-Inflammatory Effect of the Prepared Hydrogel Compared to a Commercial Product Using an Animal Model
It was observed that the necrosis—in case of the commercial formula—lasted for 9 days compared to 3 days in case of GM10. Tissue regeneration started after 12 days in case of the commercial formula compared to 6 days in case of GM10 where almost complete healing was observed after 12 days. Therefore, healing of tissues in case of GM10 was earlier (6 days) than in case of Beclozone® cream.
CONCLUSION
This study revealed that the formulation of BDP in mixed micelles enabled the local delivery to the skin with minimal systemic levels. The formulation of BDP mixed micelles into HPMC hydrogel contributed to the difference in skin biocompatibility compared to the marketed formula. Tissue regeneration in case of the mixed micelle formula started earlier (6 days) compared to the commercial formula (12 days). Moreover, minimal systemic levels in case of the mixed micelles would possibly result in enhanced patient compliance in case of patients suffering from such a chronic disease as atopic dermatitis.
