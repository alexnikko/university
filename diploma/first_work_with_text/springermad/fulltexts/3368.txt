Introduction
Phthalic acid esters (PhE) are used in a wide range of industrial productions of lubricants, glues, insect repellents, dielectric fluid, and plastics [ ]. These materials are used in medical devices such as blood bags and tubing for ventilation or parenteral nutrition. Phthalic acid is a precursor in the manufacture of phthalic acid ester (PAEs). Phthalates or phthalate esters are esters of phthalic acid. Other esters of phthalic acid include: phthalic anhydride, di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, butyl benzyl phthalate, diallyl phthalate, di(2-ethylhexyl) adipate, tris(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate, and 2-ethylhexyl sulfate (sodium salt) [ ]. Among the PhEs, di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is one of the most frequently used materials in the production of elastic polyvinyl chloride. Despite concerns about the toxicity of PhE for humans, the cytotoxic properties of these materials have not been clearly characterized [ , ]. The application of these substances is widespread globally, and their metabolites are therefore widely detectable in body’s fluids such as serum and urine among populations of different societies [ , , ]. PhE can be absorbed to human body through inhalation, oral ingestion, skin absorption, and via the parenteral routes [ , , ]. Studies have reported that phthalates can also cross the feto-placental barrier and enter the amniotic fluid and fetal circulation [ , , ]. Concerns have increased during the last decade about the risk of human exposure to phthalates, especially for susceptible individuals such as pregnant women and children [ ]. A number of studies have reported some adverse effects of PhE on kidneys, liver, and reproductive and endocrine systems. Several studies have reported testicular atrophy and liver enlargement in animals treated by DEHP [ , ]. So far, there are no studies reporting the adverse effects of PhE on the function and/or histology of cardiovascular system, and limited information is therefore available on the toxicokinetic and cardiotoxicity of PhE. Some studies have showed an association between the disturbances of intrauterine environment and the increasing risk of cardiovascular diseases such as arthrosclerosis and hypertension during adulthood [ , ].
Some studies have shown that exposure to PA among 1-day-old rats can destroy the essential components of gap junctions in cardiac cells such as connexin-43, as well as the genes associated with cardiac arrhythmogenicity [ ]. It has also been reported that exposure to PA can change the cardiomyocyte metabolic profile and can consequently make heart prone to ischemia and ventricular dysfunctions. In other words, exposure to DEHP alters the expression of genes associated with cellular metabolism of cardiomyocytes [ ].
Impaired NO production by coronary artery endothelial cells is one of the major factors causing physiological and morphological changes in cardiovascular systems, which, in turn, would lead to cardiac diseases such as hypertension [ , ]. Changes in the atrophicity of heart and arteries, particularly an increase in the WT and a decrease in the arterial diameter, play an important role in determining the extent of vasoconstriction and vasorelaxation of arterial walls as well as the composition of cellular and noncellular components of arterial walls. BP could be the result of the aforementioned structural changes [ , ]. As already mentioned, no comprehensive study has yet reported the effect of PA on the cardiac structure and NO activity of mature neonates during pregnancy. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of PA on cardiac performance parameters associated with BP, morphological properties of the septal branch of descending left coronary artery (LCA), NO activity in aorta, and measuring the oxidative stress in cardiac tissue of 3-month-old offspring rats that were exposed to PA during pregnancy.
Methods
Animals
Twenty-four female Wistar rats weighing 200–250 g, prepared from the Pastor Institution (Tehran, Iran), were used in this study. Rats were maintained inside steel cages for 12 h of light and dark cycles under the same environmental dampness, room temperature (22 °C), and relative humidity (55.95 %). Rats were kept on a basal standard diet and tap water ad libitum. Each of the two virgin female rats was located in a cage with one male rat for 24 h, and the vaginal smears of female rats were examined the following morning. In case any sperms were observed in the vaginal smears and if vaginal plugs existed, the female rats were considered as pregnant [ ]. After mating, the male rat was removed and each female rat was placed in an individual cage until the end of the study. The pregnant rats were categorized on a random basis into three equal groups and were housed individually. This research was conducted in accordance with the Principles of Laboratory Animal Care (NIH publication, revised in 1985). All the study experiments were approved by the Animal Research Ethics Board and approved prospectively by the Ethics Committee of Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Iran.
Diet and Dosing
Following pregnancy, rats were randomly categorized into three groups: control group: No substances were added to their nutrition during the study and used only natural food and water; first intervention group: PA (pure, Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI 99.5 %) was added with a dosage of 2.5 % (1763 mg/kg) + daily nutrition; and second intervention group: PA was added with a dosage of 5 % (2981 mg/kg) + daily nutrition. The diets were received daily from the seventh day to the 16th day of pregnancy. Since PA has a very low solubility in water and oil, and due to the necessity of exposing rats to the large amount of PA, we used the method of adding PA to water ad libitum in this study. This method of administration is useful with agents that are to be given in large amounts or are difficult to be dissolved in vehicles that would be tolerated in other treatment routes [ ].
A predetermined amount of PA was weighed and added to a small aliquot of ground basal diet. This premix was then added to a preweighed ground basal diet and blended with mill (Irie Shokai, Tokyo, Japan) for 30 min. The control rats were fed a basal diet only ad libitum. Due to the lack of relevant studies, we selected the method used for rat’s embryo with substances similar to PA for selecting the proper and effective dosage of PA on rat’s embryo [ ]. The PA diet was prepared fresh daily.
Measurement of Cardiac Function Parameters
Systolic blood pressure was measured in all groups by the tail plethysmographic method and was registered on a BP recorder. The heart rate (HR) of the offspring rats was measured at the end of the third month using the tail plethysmography method in all the 3 groups. In addition, the mean weight of rats’ heart was measured using a digital scale at the end of the third month.
Morphology and Geometry Assay
At the end of the experiment, 3-month-old animals were killed by an overdose anesthesia via 100 mg/kg/body weight of phenobarbital intraperitoneally, their chests were opened, and their cardiovascular system was perused at a constant pressure of 120 mm Hg for 10 min via a cannula placed in the left ventricle. Glutaraldehyde 300 mM in phosphate buffer 100 mM was used as the fixative. After perfusion, the hearts were excised and weighed. The proximal part of the septal branch of the left descending coronary artery (RS) was excised, cleaned and divided into three segments (about 1 mm), fixed with the same fixative, postfixed with 40 mM OsO4, stained en bloc with uranyl acetate, dehydrated through ascending concentration of alcohol, and finally embedded in Durcupan ACM (Sigma-Aldrich co., Germany). Morphology and geometry assay were performed according to the previously reported method [ ]. Briefly, two randomly selected blocks of the artery were cut perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis. The inner diameter (ID), arterial wall thickness, tunica intima, and tunica media (WT) were measured via light microscopy. The arterial WT was measured at about 450 intervals around the circumference of the artery.
In the coronary artery, volume densities (VD) of endothelial cells, subendothelial matrix (space between endothelial cells and first layer of smooth muscle cells, including elastic lamina), smooth muscle cells, and extracellular matrix among smooth muscle cells were measured by the point counting method [ ] using ultrathin sections. The same blocks used for the light microscopic measurements were also used for morphometric measurements at the electron microscope level. Volume density was calculated, and the total number of points falling on a particular structure/total number of points falling on the entire vessel wall (tunica intima + tunica media) was expressed as µm 3 /µm 3 vessel wall (tunica intima + tunica media). The cross-sectional area of tunica intima and tunica media (CSA) and circumferential tension (BP × ID/WT) were calculated similar to previous studies [ ].
Oxidative Stress Assay
Serum level of malondialdehyde (MDA) was measured according to the formation of MDA in thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) using a previously reported method [ ]. MDA is a product of lipid peroxidation, and thus, it is a marker of oxidative stress. Tissues’ glutathione peroxidase (GPx) enzyme activity was measured as IU/gm wet tissue by the reaction between glutathione remaining after the action of GPx and 5,5-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid). Glutathione peroxide activity of 1 U/mg protein was defined as 1 μg of GSH consumed/min/mg protein [ ]. Superoxide dismutases (SODs) activity was measured according to the method of Kono [ ]. Both SOD and GPx are antioxidant enzymes.
Nitric Oxide Synthesis (NOS) Assay
NOS activity was determined by measuring the formation of 3H- l -citrulline from [3H]- l -arginine (Amersham, Little Chalfont, UK), as previously described [ ]. Briefly, 50 µl of 10 % homogenates was incubated in the presence of 50 mmol/l Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 10 µmol/l [3H]- l -arginine (specific activity 5 GBq/mmol, about 100,000 day/min), 30 nmol/l calmodulin, 1 mmol/l βNADPH, 3 µmol/l BH4, and 2 mmol/l Ca 2+ in a total volume of 100 µl. After 20-min incubation at the 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by addition of 1 ml of 20 mmol/l HEPES buffer (pH 5.5), containing 2 mmol/l EDTA, 2 mmol/l EGTA, and 1 mmol/l L-citrulline. The samples were applied to 1 ml Dowex 50WX-8 columns (Na + form). [3 H]- l -citrulline was eluted by 1 ml of water and measured by liquid scintillation counting [ ].
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed by SPSS 16. All the values are presented as mean ± SD. Mean differences between groups were tested via independent t test and within groups via paired t test. A level of p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
Results
Table 1 demonstrates the hemodynamic properties and the weight of offspring rats after 3 months. A significant increase in the mean BP was seen among offspring rats which had been treated with PA 2.5 and PA 5 %, compared to the control group. In addition, PA treatment with a dose of 5 % significantly increased the PB among the offspring rats compared to the dose 2.5 %. No significant increase was seen in the HR using the 2.5 % dose of PA compared to the control group. On the other hand, treatment with PA 5 % significantly increased the HR, compared to the control group. There was no significant difference in the mean HR of mature rats between the two groups of PA 2.5 and 5 %. A significant decrease in the BW of offspring rats was seen among the two groups of PA 2.5 and 5 %, compared to the control group. In addition, a significant decrease in the BW of rats was seen in the PA 5 % group, compared to the PA 2.5 % group. PA treatment with dosages of 2.5 and 5 % caused a significant decrease in the rats’ mean heart weight, compared to the control group. An increase was seen in the HW/BW ratio among the two groups of PA 2.5 and 5 %, compared to the control group. This increase was only significant for the PA 5 % group (Table 1 ).

Table 2 shows the morphological changes in thoracic aorta in a mature offspring which has been exposed to phthalic acid during pregnancy. As shown in this table, the wall thickness (tunica intima + tunica media) has significantly increased in groups receiving PA 2.5 and 5 %, compared to the control group. In addition, the mean aorta thickness was significantly higher in the PA 5 % group, compared to the PA 2.5 % group. The mean cross-sectional area (CSA) was significantly higher among rats in both groups of PA 2.5 and PA 5 %, compared to rats in the control group. Furthermore, the mean CSA in the PA 5 % group was significantly higher compared to the group of PA 2.5 %. Although the mean internal diameter in the PA 2.5 and 5 % groups was reduced compared to the control group, no statically significant reduction was observed in any of the cases. The ratio of the wall thickness to internal diameter was significantly increased in the mature rats treated with PA 2.5 and 5 %, compared to the control group (Table 2 ).

The septal branch morphologic changes in the descending LCA are shown in Table 3 . The mean WT in the PA 2.5 and PA 5 % groups showed a significant increase compared to the control group. In addition, the mean WT was lower in the PA 5 % compared to the PA 2.5 % ( p < 0.05). The mean CSA was increased in both groups of PA 2.5 and PA 5 %, compared to the control group. The mean CSA in the PA 5 % group showed a significant increase, compared to the PA 2.5 % group ( p < 0.05). The mean ID in the PA 2.5 and PA 5 % groups showed a significant decrease compared to the control group. The mean ID was higher in the PA 5 % group compared to the PA 2.5 % ( p < 0.05). The WT/ID ratio in the groups treated with PA 2.5 and PA 5 % was significantly higher than that in the control group. However, the mean WT/ID ratio in the PA 5 % group did not show any significant difference compared to the PA 2.5 % group (Table 3 ).

In Fig. 1 , the mean and standard deviation of MDA level have been compared among mature rats in the three groups. Among rats in PA 2.5 and PA 5 % groups, the MDA level was significantly increased compared to the control group (35.2 ± 0.98 and 39.1 ± 4.4 vs. 28.2 ± 3.4, p < 0.05 and <0.01, respectively). In addition, the mean level of MDA in the PA 5 % group was significantly higher compared to the PA 2.5 % group (39.1 ± 4.4 vs. 34.4 ± 3.5, p < 0.05). Fig. 1 Prenatal exposure to phthalic acid (PA) on MDA level of heart tissue in offspring rats. Pregnant rats were treated with saline (control) or PA, and MDA levels of heart tissue were determined from 3-month-old male offspring rats. Values are mean ± SD, N = 8. * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01 compared to control group, + p < 0.05 compared to PA 2.5 %
Figure 2 illustrates the mean GPx level of cardiac tissue among mature rats in the three different groups. Although the mean GPx in the PA 2.5 % group was lower than that in the control group, this difference was not significant (27.2 ± 1.4 vs. 30.8 ± 1.2, p = 0.086). However, the mean GPx level in the PA 5 % was significantly lower than both the control group (21.5 ± 1.6 vs. 30.8 ± 1.2, p < 0.01) and the PA 2.5 % group (21.1 ± 1.6 vs. 27.2 ± 1.4, p < 0.05). Fig. 2 Prenatal exposure to phthalic acid (PA) on GPx level of heart tissue in offspring rats.

Values are mean ± SD, N = 8. * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01 compared to control group, + p < 0.05 compared to PA 2.5 %
The SOD level in both the PA 2.5 % and the PA 5 % groups showed a significant reduction, compared to the control group (9.4 ± 1.4 and 5.5 ± 1.7 vs. 15.4 ± 2.4, p < 0.05 and <0.01, respectively). In addition, PA treatment with a dose of 5 % caused a greater reduction in the SOD level compared to the dose of 2.5 % ( p < 0.05) (Fig. 3 ). Fig. 3 Prenatal exposure to phthalic acid (PA) on SOD level of heart tissue in offspring rats. Pregnant rats were treated with saline (control) or PA, and SOD level of heart tissue was determined from 3-month-old male offspring rats.

The NOS activity in the aorta of the control group was measured as 63.4 ± 6.5 dpm/µg/min. On the other hand, the NOS activity among rats in the PA 2.5 % group and rats in the PA 5 % group was significantly reduced compared to the control group (52.5 ± 8.5 and 48.4 ± 7.5 vs. 63.4 ± 6.5 dpm/µg/min, p < 0.05 and <0.01, respectively). The mean NOS activity in the PA 5 % group showed a significant reduction compared to the PA 2.5 % group ( p < 0.05) (Fig. 4 ).

Discussion
Phthalic acid esters are widely used in the manufacture of medical devices such as bags and tubes for the carriage of blood, plasma, intravenous fluids and parenteral nutrition, nasogastric and central tubes, umbilical catheters, and hemodialysis tubes. Because of their lipophilic properties, phthalic acid esters can enter the human body through blood, plasma, platelets, intravenous nutrition contents, and fluid lipids [ ]. Therefore, exposure to DEHP increases dramatically with multiple medical interventions and whole blood products can reach as high as 620 μg/mL DEHP concentration (FDA: Center for Devices and Radiological Health 2002).
Studies show an increase in the dosage and exposure duration of PA during neonatal periods in clinical conditions [ ], so that the dosage to which neonates are exposed is about 10–20 mg/kg/day. Multiple organ failure caused by PA toxicity and its different kinds of esters has been reported by several animal studies [ ].The results of those studies performed on humans, reporting the dysfunction of endocrine and reproductive systems after exposure to PA, have raised the concerns about the toxic effects of PA on human’s health [ ]. Nevertheless, there are still a few investigations into the effect of PA on metabolism and arrhythmogenecity in clinical conditions [ ]. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of prenatal PA exposure, in different dosages, of PA on hemodynamic parameters, contractile and functional properties and oxidative stress in the cardiac tissue of rats’ offspring.
Our study showed that PA significantly increased the BP and HR among rats’ offspring in the intervention groups, compared to those in the control group. In addition, BW and HW of the rats exposed to PA during pregnancy were impaired and these rats had lower weights compared to those in the control group. The effects of PA on BP, HR, total BW, and HW were all dose-dependent, such that PA 5 %, compared to PA 2.5 %, significantly increased the BP and HR among exposed rats. This dose-dependent effect was also seen for the BW and HW as shown in Table 1 . The only study investigating the effect of PA, di-(2-ethyl hexyl) phthalate (DEHP), on the BP of 60- and 200-day-old rats, showed that DEHP caused a decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) as well as the HR in both 60- and 200-day rats, which was in contrast with our study [ ]. The aforementioned study concluded that the reduction in DEHP-associated blood pressure was due to the reduction in the serum testosterone level. In our study, the PA-associated increase in the BP could be due to cardiac hypertrophy and increase in the thickness of aorta wall and the descending LCA. Different findings are usually taken by studies with different methodology or mechanisms. Despite an intensive search, we only found limited number of studies to investigate the effects of PA on the cardiovascular system particularly during fetal period. Most of relevant studies reported the same findings as ours. Though the Martinez-Arguelles study showed a relatively different result, however, their results were obtained from 60- and 200-day rats, and therefore, PA may act differently among lower ages and older rats. Also, due to restricted number of studies performed in this field, this substance may show different effects in different conditions.
As shown by the results of the current study, PA can increase WT in both aorta and descending LCA, in a dose-dependent manner. Changes in cardiac atrophy, particularly an increase in the thickness of coronary walls (tunica media + tunica intermedia) with a decrease in the ID, can induce the BP [ , ]. This matter was well demonstrated in our study, and PA increased the WT and decreased the diameter of aorta and descending LCA.
The current study revealed that the level of MDA was significantly higher in the PA 2.5 and PA 5 % groups, compared to the control group, in a dose-dependent manner.
However, contrary to MDA, the levels of GPx and SOD enzymes increased in a dose-dependent manner, compared to the control group. It seems that one of the mechanisms of vascular dysfunction by PA is due to ROS aggregations and induction of fetal programming of vascular hypertensive reactivity in adult offspring [ , , , ]. Based on these results, it could be said that exposure to PA during pregnancy is associated with increased ROS species. Many studies have shown that increased ROS species and decreased vascular SOD were associated with vascular dysfunction [ , ]. According to these results, the present study is the first research to represent an increase in the oxidative stress of cardiac tissue and a decrease in the antioxidant capacity of cardiac tissue among rats which have been exposed to PA during pregnancy. In previous reports, the association between increase in the oxidative stress and the incidence of BP was revealed in an animal study [ ].
On the other hand, the present study showed a significant decrease, via a dose-dependent manner, in the activity of NOS among rats exposed to PA, compared to the control group. Cosentino et al. [ ] reported the impaired production of endothelial NOS among prehypertensive rats, which was in accordance with the results of the present study. In addition, other studies have shown that increase in the oxidative stress and superoxide through reduction in tetrahydrobiopterin causes a decrease in the NO level as a result of insufficient NOS activity [ , , ]. It has been shown that the excess superoxide reacts with nitric oxide and disturbs its physiological signaling through the production of peroxynitrite [ ]. This result is similar to that of the present study which showed a reduction in the SOD level and the NOS activity. Totally, it could be said that the present study provides the first report about the effects of PA, during pregnancy, on the geometry of coronary vessels, oxidative stress of the cardiac tissue, and the NOS activity of the thoracic aorta. It is still unknown that the vascular or cardiotoxicity observed in offspring is a result of direct effects of maternal transfer of phthalic acid or its metabolites and it has been previously explained by different studies in animal or human models [ , , ]. Studies on health effects of PAEs in humans have remained controversial due to limitations of the study designs. Some of findings in human populations are consistent with animal data suggesting that PAEs and their metabolites produce toxic effects in the reproductive system. However, it is not yet possible to conclude whether phthalate exposure is harmful for human reproduction and needs further investigations [ ].
The results of the present study showed that PA, in a dose-dependent manner, can increase the BP as well as the HR which, in turn, is caused through the effects of PA on the geometry of coronary arteries and creating cardiac hypertrophy. The results also showed that PA, through a dose-dependent manner, can increase the oxidative stress and decrease the antioxidant capacity of the cardiac tissue. Also, results showed that the NOS activity among rats exposed to PA during pregnancy has significantly decreased. Future studies may need to investigate the effects of PA on the genes encoding NADPH oxidase and peroxynitrite production as well as the different subunits of NOS (i.e., iNOS and eNOS).
Conclusion
This study revealed that prenatal exposure of rats to PA can cause irreversible effects on the cardiac structure and also elevated markers of oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction in offspring rats.
