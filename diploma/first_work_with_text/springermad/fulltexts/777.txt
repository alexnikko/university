Introduction
Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is a heterogeneous antibody deficiency syndrome ( www.esid.org ). In 30% of CVID patients, the immunodeficiency not only affects the humoral response against pathogens but is also associated with autoimmunity and inflammatory organ disease [ , , ]. Immunologically, these patients often present with altered T cell counts or composition of subpopulations [ , ]. Only in some patients mutations in genes potentially affecting both antibody production as well as T cell function have been identified which include ICOS [ ], LRBA [ ], CTLA4 [ ], and the NF-κB1 subunit p50 [ ]. According to clinical presentation, patients have been divided into patients with “infection only” (CVIDio) and patients with secondary clinical complications such as interstitial lung disease, autoimmunity, granulomatous inflammation, liver and gastrointestinal inflammatory disease, splenomegaly, lymphoproliferative disorders, or the development of cancer or lymphoma (hereinafter referred to as CVIDc) [ , ]. The increased morbidity and mortality in CVID patients with these non-infectious complications [ , , , , ] demands a better understanding of the etiology of the underlying immune dysregulation in order to improve therapy for this subgroup of patients.
Recently, an expansion and altered differentiation of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) has been suggested to contribute to the dysregulation of the immune system in CVIDc patients [ ]. ILC subsets which are of lymphoid lineage but lack recombination-activating gene (RAG)-dependent rearranged antigen receptors have important effector functions during the early stages of the immune response against microbes [ , ], in tissue repair [ , ] and in maintaining epithelial integrity at barrier surfaces [ ].
Uncontrolled activation and proliferation of ILCs can contribute to severe inflammation and damage of different organs in different disorders [ , , , , , ]. A dysregulation of ILCs has been observed in human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [ , ], asthma [ ], chronic rhinosinusitis [ , ], and psoriasis [ ].
There are conflicting results regarding ILCs in CVID. Ganjalikhani et al. [ ] observed a reduction of ILCs in CVID patients, while Cols et al. reported an expansion of inflammatory ILCs in circulation and mucosal tissues of CVID patients with secondary complications [ ]. The authors suggested that especially the inflammatory ILC3 subset contributes to the higher IFNγ serum levels and the IFN signature in whole blood cells of these CVIDc patients [ ]. As an alternative source of IFNγ, Giovannetti et al. had observed an association of secondary complications in CVID patients with a decrease of naïve CD4 T cells and a shift towards IFNγ-producing CD4 T cells [ ].
We were interested to resolve these conflicting results and correlate them with the clinical as well as immunological phenotype in our cohort of CVID patients.
Methods
Patients and Blood and Sample Processing
All procedures performed in this study were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments. Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants before inclusion into the study. Peripheral blood samples were obtained from 58 CVID patients (34 female and 24 male patients, age 19–75 years) and 33 healthy adult volunteers. Lymph nodes (LNs) were removed in seven CVID patients with lymphadenopathy for diagnostic purposes. Six tumor-free lymph nodes of cancer patients served as controls. Four disease control bronchoalveolar lavage samples (BALs) of patients with suspected sarcoidosis and nine BAL samples of CVID patients with interstitial lung involvement were analyzed.
All patients fulfilled the criteria for CVID according to the European Society for Immunodeficiencies (ESID) ( www.esid.org ; [ ]). The following clinical data was recorded (Table 1 ): splenomegaly (defined as a diameter of greater than 11 × 4.7 cm proven by ultrasound or computer tomography (CT scan), generalized lymphadenopathy (LNs > 1 cm in diameter in at least two different anatomical sites detected by clinical examination, ultrasound, or CT), granulomatous disease (suggested by CT in case of pulmonary nodules or proven by histology in four patients), autoimmune cytopenias (autoimmune hemolytic anemia or immune thrombocytopenia), interstitial lung disease and respiratory disorders (based on CT morphology, bronchoalveolar lavage or biopsy and pulmonary function tests), enteropathy (based on histology, biopsy and endoscopic analysis), and liver disease (based on ultrasound and biopsy). Patients with at least one complication were included into the CVIDc group while all others comprised the “infection-only” CVID group (CVIDio). Patients who never underwent the respective diagnostic workup were excluded for association studies. In addition, all patients were classified according to EUROclass classification [ ], considering the reduction of switched memory B cells (smB) and the expansion of CD21 low B cells.

Isolation of PBMCs, Lymph Node Mononuclear Cells, and Cells from BALs
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by Ficoll density centrifugation (Pancoll, Pan-Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany). Mononuclear cells from lymph nodes were isolated by mechanical disruption. The tissue was minced with a scalpel and the cell suspension was pressed through a sieve (380 μm mesh). After washing, the cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium (Pan Biotec, Aidenbach) + 10% FCS. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples were filtered through a sterile gauze, then centrifuged at 4 °C at 500× g for 10 min. BAL fluid was removed and BAL cells were washed twice in PBS, once with RPMI + 10% FCS, and resuspended in appropriate amount of medium.
Immunophenotyping by Using Flow Cytometry
ILCs were identified as CD3 − CD19 − CD1a − CD14 − CD34 − CD11c − BDCA2 − CD123 − FcεRI − (Lineage − ) CD127 + CD161 + cells gated on CD45 + lymphocytes, and the different subsets were differentiated according to their expression of the surface markers CRTH2, c-kit, and NKp44 following the protocol by Hazenberg and Spits [ ]. All used antibodies are listed in Supplementary Table 1 in the Online Repository. For intracellular cytokine staining, PBMCs were rested over night at 37 °C and 5% CO 2 and subsequently stimulated with 5 ng/ml PMA and 750 ng/ml ionomycin in the presence of 10 μg/ml Brefeldin A (all Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 4 h. For intracellular cytokine detection of IFNγ, the Cytofix/Cytoperm™ Fixation/Permeabilization Solution Kit (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and for IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 detection, the Foxp3/Transcription Factor Buffer Set (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Data acquisition was performed with a Gallios flow-cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL). Data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Treestar, Ashland, OR).
T cell subsets were stained in whole blood and identified as CD3 + CD4 + CD45RA − lymphocytes and further subdivided into T H 1-, T H 2-, T H 17-, T H 1/17-like cells based on the expression of CXCR3 and CCR6.
Statistical Analysis
Values were expressed as means ± SDs. Statistical significance was assessed with the Kruskal-Wallis test for comparison of more than two groups for datasets without Gaussian distribution, followed by Dunn’s multiple correction test, unless otherwise specified. Results of ROC analysis were reported as percentages.
Results were analyzed with GraphPad Prism software (version 6.07 and 7.01; GraphPad Software, La Jolla, Calif), and P values of less than .05 were considered significant.
Results
Reduced Numbers of Circulating ILCs Affecting Especially ILC2s in CVIDc Patients
In this study, we identified and subtyped ILCs according to hierarchical gating of Lin − CD127 + CD161 + cells within the lymphocyte gate (Fig. 1 a). The ILC family was further divided into ILC1 (CRTH2 − c-Kit − Nkp44 − ), ILC2 (CRTH2 + ), and NCR − ILC3 (CRTH2 − c-Kit + Nkp44 − ). The NCR + ILC3 subset (CRTH2 − c-Kit + Nkp44 + ) was not detectable in peripheral blood but detectable in bronchoalveolar lavages (BALs) and lymph nodes (Fig. 1 a). Fig. 1 Phenotype and gating strategy for ILC subpopulations. a ILC subpopulations were determined by flow cytometry as indicated by examples from peripheral blood, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and lymph node. For details, see methods. NCR + ILC3s are absent in peripheral blood but detectable in BAL and lymph node tissue. Total circulating ILCs ( b ) and ILC subsets ( c ) were analyzed in healthy donors (HDs), CVID patients with secondary complications (CVIDc), and CVID patients suffering only from infections (CVIDio), both for absolute (left panels) and for relative counts (right panels). * P < .05, ** P < .01; *** P < .001; **** P < .0001, Kruskal-Wallis test
Fifty-eight CVID patients and 33 healthy donors (HDs) were analyzed for circulating ILCs in the peripheral blood. In healthy controls circulating innate lymphoid cells constitute 0.09% ± 0.04% of CD45 + lymphocytes, which were composed of 17% ± 4.8% ILC1s, 33% ± 12% ILC2s, and 45% ± 12% NCR − ILC3s. This corresponds to absolute values of 1757 ± 535 total ILCs/ml, consisting of 282 ± 85 ILC1/ml, 550 ± 284 ILC2/ml, and 865 ± 359 NCR − ILC3/ml.
Eighty-one percent of the patients in our cohort had secondary clinical complications, like autoimmune cytopenia, splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, granulomatous disease, lung disease, and liver disease or enteropathy (Table 1 , for detailed information see material and methods). Overall, absolute (Fig. 1 b, left) but not relative counts (Fig. 1 b, right) of total ILCs were decreased in CVIDc patients (mean 863 ± 690 ILCs/ml) when compared to HD. For CVIDio patients, ILC counts varied substantially and were not statistically different from ILC counts in HD or CVIDc patients (Fig. 1 b). Closer analysis of the different ILC subsets revealed that the absolute reduction of ILCs in CVIDc patients was evident for all subsets (Fig. 1 c, left), but affected especially ILC2 (Fig. 1 c, right). ILC3s were relatively expanded in CVIDc patients compared to CVIDio, while the proportion of ILC1 was comparable to controls for both patient groups (Fig. 1 c, right).
Longitudinal investigations of the distribution of circulating ILCs showed stable absolute ILC counts in 7/9 patients and 2/3 HD (Supplementary Fig. 1 a). All patients with stable ILC numbers had an uneventful disease course in that time period, while those with changes (CVID no. 2 and CVID no. 8) needed hospitalization because of urticaria with angioedema with adapted medication or experienced an extended episode of elevated serum CRP levels with unknown origin of the inflammation, respectively. Stable counts were observed for the ILC1 and ILC2 subsets, while in some patients, ILC3s showed greater variances over time (Supplementary Fig. 1 b–d).
In addition to the phenotypic characterization, ILC subsets have been divided according to their cytokine profiles [ ]. Therefore, IFNγ, the prototypic cytokine produced by ILC1 and a subgroup of ILC3 and IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, produced mainly by ILC2, were measured after 4 h of PMA/Ionomycin stimulation (Supplementary Fig. 2 ). CVID patients had similar numbers of IL-4 and IL-5 producing ILCs when compared to HD, whereas IL-13 producing ILCs seem to be slightly reduced in CVID patients (Supplementary Fig. 2 b). In regard to the percentage of IFNγ-producing ILCs, we noticed a heterogeneity among CVID patients but could not detect a significant difference for total CVID, nor CVIDc or CVIDio patients in comparison to HD (Supplementary Fig. 2 b). Analyses of the recorded immunological and clinical parameters failed to identify underlying factors for this bimodal distribution. IL-17A, typically produced by ILC3, was not detected in circulating ILCs of HD or CVID patients (data not shown).
Reduced ILCs Are Not Specifically Associated with Single Secondary Complications
Next, we tested if the altered ILC phenotype was associated with a specific clinical manifestation. A reduction of absolute counts of all ILC subsets was observed for every investigated secondary complication (Fig. 2 a–d and Supplementary Fig. 3 ). This was usually not the case in patients who did not suffer from the respective manifestation, but a significant difference between patients with and without the complication was detectable only for interstitial lung disease, colitis, and splenomegaly (Fig. 2 a–c, left panels). Affected patients had lower absolute counts of ILC1 in blood compared to unaffected patients and HD. The relative shift towards NCR − ILC3s observed for CVIDc patients was only reproducible for patients with colitis, splenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy (Fig. 2 b–d, right panels) but not for all other tested secondary manifestations, like nodular regenerative hyperplasia of the liver, granulomatous disease, and autoimmune cytopenia (Supplementary Fig. 3 ). Fig. 2 The ILC subset distribution in correlation to manifestations of lung and gastrointestinal involvement and of lymphoproliferation. Absolute (left panels) and relative (right panels) counts of ILC subsets were correlated with the manifestation of lung involvement, including interstitial lung disease (ILD) and other respiratory diseases (other resp. disease) ( a ); enteropathy, including colitis, sprue-like disease (sprue), and nodular lymphoid hyperplasia (NLH) ( b ); splenomegaly ( c ) and lymphadenopathy ( d ). * P < .05; ** P < .01; *** P < .001; **** P < .0001, Kruskal-Wallis test
Investigation of ILCs in the BAL of affected patients showed a comparable percentage of total ILCs as well as the ILC subset distribution in BAL samples of CVIDc patients and sarcoidosis patients who served as a disease control cohort (Supplementary Fig. 4 a). Comparing ILC differentiation in the BAL of both disorders revealed no significant differences. Similarly, the relative increase of NCR − ILC3 in blood of patients with lymphadenopathy was not detectable among ILCs in CVIDc lymph nodes (Supplementary Fig. 4 b).
Additional correlation with IgA serum levels, elevated CRP serum levels, ongoing steroid treatment, or route of IgG application did not reveal any significant association with the ILC phenotype (data not shown).
ILCs Are More Reduced in CVID 21low Patients
When stratifying the cohort according to the EUROClass B cell phenotype [ ], the reduction of total ILCs was significant for patients with expanded CD21 low B cells (CVID 21low) and was less pronounced in CVID 21norm patients, regardless of the presence or absence of switched memory B cells (smB) (Fig. 3 a). Analysis of ILC subsets revealed similar results for all three subpopulations (Fig. 3 b, left panel). When analyzing the relative composition of the ILC subpopulations, ILC2s were significantly reduced in smB-21low patients and NCR − ILC3s showed a trend towards higher percentages when compared to HD and 21norm patients (Fig. 3 b, right). Fig. 3 Correlation of ILC compartment with the B cell phenotype. Absolute (left panels) and relative (right panels) counts of total ILCs (a) and ILC subsets (b) were analyzed in CVID patients stratified according to the EUROClass classification. * P < .05, ** P < .01 *** P < .001, **** P < .0001, Kruskal-Wallis test
Expanded CXCR3+CCR6− TH1-like memory CD4 T Cells in CVIDc Patients
Given the reported IFNγ signature in CVIDc patients and previous reports of a predominantly T H 1-polarized CD4 compartment in CVIDc and smB-21low patients, we analyzed the distribution of T H 1-, T H 2-, and T H 17-memory CD4 T cells according to their CXCR3 and CCR6 expression (Fig. 4 a). CXCR3 + CCR6 − T H 1-like memory CD4 cells were significantly expanded in CVIDc patients compared to CVIDio patients and HD, while the frequencies of T H 2-like and T H 17-like memory CD4 T cells were reduced in CVIDc patients (Fig. 4 b, right). Absolute counts of T H 2- and T H 17-like subsets were also reduced in CVIDc patients while T H 1-like memory CD4 T cells were normal, corroborating the skewed memory compartment towards T H 1 in CVID patients with immune dysregulation (Fig. 4 b, left). Fig. 4 Characterization of the T cell phenotype in CVID patients. a Gating strategy for cT H 1, cT H 1/17, cT H 2, and cT H 17 in the CD4 memory compartment of a representative healthy donor (HD, left), CVIDc (middle), and CVIDio patient (right). Absolute ( b , left) as well as relative counts ( b , right) were compared between HD, CVIDc, and CVIDio patients. * P < .05; ** P < .01; *** P < .001; **** P < .0001, Kruskal-Wallis. c Correlation of NCR − ILC3s and T H 1 cells in HD (white triangles with black border), CVIDc (black circles), and CVIDio patients (gray squares). The horizontal line depicts the cut-off for NCR − ILC3s and the vertical line depicts the cut-off for T H 1 cells according to the highest value for HD. d ROC analysis: T H 1 (black circles) and NCR − ILC3 cells (gray squares) were analyzed to discriminate CVIDc patients from HD and CVIDio patients
Since both the expanded T H 1 subset and the NCR − ILC3s were associated with complications in CVID, we tested if these alterations in the T and ILC compartment correlated with each other. Neither for CVIDc patients nor for HD and CVIDio patients, we found a direct correlation between both cell populations, indicating that the observed alterations in both compartments may occur independently (Fig. 4 c). For comparisons in regard to the better discriminator of CVIDc and CVIDio patients, we set a cut-off according to the highest values in HD at 33% for T H 1-like CD4 memory T cells and at 65% for NCR − ILC3s, respectively. 73.3% of the CVIDc patients, but also 27.3% of the CVIDio patients, exceeded the threshold level for T H 1-like CD4 memory T cells, whereas only 26.6% of the CVIDc patients would be identified if the relative amount of NCR − ILC3s in healthy donors were used to identify patients with secondary complications (Fig. 4 c), but in this case, no false positive CVIDio patients would fall into this group. In the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, the area under the curve (AUC) indicated that T H 1-like CD4 memory T cells (AUC 0.85, P value < 0.0001) present a better parameter to distinguish between CVIDc and CVIDio patients and HD compared to NCR − ILC3s (AUC 0.63, P value 0.02) (Fig. 4 d).
Discussion
In a recent paper, Cols et al. [ ] linked the manifestation of secondary complications in CVID patients to an expansion of circulating ILC3s in the affected patients. The authors had identified these cells as a potential source of the previously reported IFN signature in these patients [ ]. In this study, we investigated the Freiburg cohort of CVID patients according to Cols et al. and additionally correlated the alteration in the ILC compartment with specific clinical complications and immunological phenotypes. Since we had previously observed a T H 1 CD4 memory expansion in CVIDc patients [ ], we were especially interested in the association of the altered ILC and T cell phenotypes.
In contrast to Cols et al., but in line with Ganjalikhani et al. [ ], we observed reduced absolute counts of total ILCs in CVIDc patients. Also, the reference range of our HD cohort was significantly lower than that reported by Cols et al., but reflected data of absolute ILC counts in HD cohorts of other groups [ , , ]. These differences are probably explained by technical differences in the definition of the ILC gate by adding anti-CD1a, anti-CD34, anti-BDCA2, anti-CD123, and anti-FcεRI into the lineage marker mix to exclude also stem progenitor cells, monocytoid and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and mast cells. We had also included the pan-ILC marker CD161 for a better definition of this population which might exclude a small number of NKp44 − ILC3s as suggested in a recent paper by Simoni et al. [ ]. Like Cols et al., we saw a relative expansion of NCR − ILC3s in CVIDc patients compared to CVIDio due to a more severe reduction of ILC2s. This phenotype was stable over time in case of an uneventful disease course as has previously been observed in patients with systemic sclerosis [ ]. Up to now, only few situations influencing the ILC frequency or subset distribution have been well described. Thus, viral infections like HIV can lead to an irreversible ILC depletion from peripheral blood in the acute phase and persistent low counts in chronic infection [ ]. Interestingly, especially ILC3s recovered significantly after anti-retroviral therapy, but all three ILC subsets failed to return to normal frequencies and remained lower than in uninfected people despite undetectable viral loads. Similar to CVIDc, in HIV, ILC depletion and shift of subset distribution were associated with an interferon-driven immune activation [ ]. We therefore assume that the observed alterations in CVID patients are rather secondary and not primary due to a genetic background, especially since this would need to affect over 50% of the investigated CVID patients.
We found reduced ILC numbers in CVIDc patients independent of the specific secondary manifestations. A significant difference between CVID patients with and without the specific manifestation we only saw for patients with lymphoproliferation, interstitial lung disease, and colitis. We therefore tried to investigate whether these changes in the blood were associated with altered tissue homeostasis of ILCs in the respective compartment. Kloverpris et al. [ ] had previously reported ILCs in tonsil and gut tissues of HIV-infected patients without providing evidence that ILCs are either recruited to or depleted from tonsils or gut mucosal barrier in chronic HIV-1 infection. Unfortunately, we were not able to collect sufficient material from gastrointestinal biopsies of CVIDc patients with colitis, but could analyze ILCs in BAL and lymph nodes of a few CVIDc patients. In comparison to sarcoidosis patients and lymph node tissue of healthy controls, respectively, we could not detect an enrichment of ILCs in the affected tissues or other abnormalities, but these studies are limited by the number of investigations and lack of proper controls. Interestingly, patients with or without autoimmune cytopenia showed an equally altered ILC phenotype, suggesting that the manifestation of autoimmune cytopenia is probably less strongly associated with the described ILC phenotype.
Given the fact that ILC3s have a supportive role in mucosal IgA production [ , ], we investigated the association of circulating ILC3s and serum IgA but we did not find higher numbers of circulating ILC3s in patients with detectable serum IgA compared to CVID lacking IgA.
Since alterations in compartments of the immune system are often an expression of more general alterations, we compared the observed shifts in the ILCs with the known alterations in the B cell [ ] and T cell compartment [ ]. CVID patients with elevated CD21 low B cells had absolutely less total ILCs, relatively less ILC2s, and relatively more ILC3s than healthy controls while patients with normal numbers of CD21 low B cells showed no difference in this regard. This coincides with the fact that in 21low CVID patients secondary complications like splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, or granulomas are more prevalent [ ]. We could not identify a direct association of the altered ILC phenotype with a shift in T H 1 vs. T H 2 CD4 T cells in CVID patients, but we observed a significant polarization towards T H 1 in the CD4 memory compartment in CVIDc patients. This effect was not seen by Cols et al. [ ], but previously reported by Giovannetti et al. [ ] and others.
Since the numbers of circulating CD4 T cells are about 500-fold higher than that of ILCs and NK cells, another prominent source of IFNγ, have been reported to be rather severely reduced in CVID patients with non-infectious complications [ , , , ], we assume that the observed T H 1 shift of CD4 memory T cells in CVIDc patients contributes substantially to the IFN signature in this patient group. Interestingly, recent findings of our laboratory demonstrate that the expansion of CD21 low B cells correlates with the shift of the CD4 memory compartment towards a T H 1 phenotype and might be even by itself an expression of this change in cytokine environment [ ]. In this case, the altered B cell, T cell, and ILC phenotype might represent different aspects of the same dysregulation of the immune system, as a similar pattern is for example observed in HIV [ , , , ]. Longitudinal studies will be necessary to explore the developing pathophysiology of this dysregulation.
Conclusions
Innate lymphoid cell numbers are absolutely reduced in the blood of CVIDc patients, especially due to a severe decrease of ILC2s, whereas NCR − ILC3 counts are less strongly affected. This phenotype is fairly stable over time and part of a broader immune dysregulation observed in these patients. While the T H 1 shift observed in CD4 memory T cells has probably the stronger impact on the prevalent IFN signature, future studies need to examine a potential role of the shift in ILCs on shaping this immune dysregulation.
