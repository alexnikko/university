Introduction
Hemophilia A is a genetic bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency of functional clotting factor VIII (FVIII), affecting 1 in 6500 male births [ ]. As a result, hemophilia patients are unable to form clots in response to vascular injury and are thus prone to bleeding episodes. Among the most severe patients (i.e. those with less than 1% of normal FVIII activity), bleeds may occur spontaneously, particularly in joints, resulting in debilitating arthropathy. Current hemophilia therapy consists of regular intravenous infusions of exogenous FVIII to maintain FVIII levels above a certain trough at all times. Often, the selected trough is 1% (or 10 IU L −1 ), based on the observation that the rate of increase in joint score of moderate patients with endogenous FVIII activity between 1 and 3% was halved compared with those with endogenous levels below 1% [ ]. Furthermore, a correlation between time spent below the 1% threshold and the occurrences of bleeds and hemarthroses has been demonstrated [ ].
Today, there is global consensus that prophylaxis should be initiated at a young age, before joint disease is apparent [ , , ]. However, no optimal regimen has been determined due to a highly variable pharmacokinetic (PK) response between patients. High between subject variability (BSV) and relatively low interoccasion variability (IOV) suggests that FVIII dosing regimens ought to be tailored to the individual to ensure both the safety of the patient and the responsible use of expensive clotting factor concentrates [ , ]. The classic approach to PK-based dose tailoring has been difficult to apply in a clinical setting, especially when using the approach recommended by the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) for bioequivalence studies with new concentrates, which requires more than 10 samples taken over the course of 48 h. More recent ISTH-issued guidelines detail the value of a population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) approach to PK studies oriented to dose individualization [ , ]. A PopPK model, which provides typical values of PK parameters (e.g. clearance [CL], central volume [V 1 ]) and quantifies the variability within the population based on patient covariates, can act as informative prior knowledge for the Bayesian estimation of individual PK parameters including half-life and time to target trough.
Several PopPK models for standard half-life (SHL) FVIII products have been published in the literature, and are summarized in Table 1 . Each of the cited models is dedicated to one specific brand of FVIII, and FVIII products do vary in ways that may be clinically relevant (Fig. 1 ). One such characteristic is the source of the FVIII concentrate, which may be plasma-derived (pdFVIII) or recombinant (rFVIII). Plasma-derived concentrates can be further categorized based on their von Willebrand factor (vWF) content: intermediate purity (vWF:FVIII > 1), high purity (vWF:FVIII = 0.2–0.4), or immunopurified (vWF:FVIII < 0.1) [ ]. The presence of a native FVIII-vWF complex in pdFVIII has been shown to impact the early phase of the PK profile, but does not appear to affect half-life [ ]. Recombinant FVIII products can be classified according to their structure. In 2000, the first B-domain deleted recombinant FVIII product (BDDrFVIII) was released, followed by a B-domain truncated product in 2013 [ ]. The purpose of this deletion was to improve production efficiency, with no changes to immunogenicity or pharmacokinetic profile. While some studies have found BDDrFVIII products to be bioequivalent to their full-length counterparts [ , , ], others have found that half-lives are shorter after this modification [ , ]. This may be due to disrupted intermolecular interactions that impact the life span of FVIII [ ]. Despite these differences in source and structure, variability seems to be greater across patients than across brands [ ]. Thus, a generic PopPK model for SHL FVIII products can be a valuable tool, especially if one considers that hemophilia is a rare disorder with an abundance of similar products, all of which benefit from PK-tailored dosing regimens.

The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a generic PopPK model for SHL FVIII products, both plasma-derived and recombinant, using data acquired through the Web Accessible Population Pharmacokinetic Service—Hemophilia (WAPPS-Hemo) project. The development of such a model will help to determine if there are distinct PK differences between FVIII brands and the clinical relevance of these differences. Further, the model will be incorporated into the WAPPS-Hemo platform, which tackles the issue of high BSV by using PopPK models for Bayesian forecasting to obtain individual PK estimates from relatively few patient samples. Clinicians provide 2–4 factor levels, along with demographic information, and are provided with individual estimates of relevant PK parameters (such as half-life, time to 1% FVIII activity, or FVIII activity at 72 h). Furthermore, the wide covariate space of the generic model may permit its use for patients on brands of SHL FVIII that are not included in the modelling dataset, making it particularly useful in cases where a dedicated, brand-specific PopPK model is lacking.
Methods
Patient data
Data for recombinant and plasma-derived SHL FVIII was collected from multiple industry sources through the WAPPS-Hemo project. The model was developed using FVIII activity measurements from 310 densely sampled patients (one infusion per patient), consisting of between 4 and 12 factor levels (median: 10). All samples were measured using the one-stage clotting assay. All patients had either severe or moderate hemophilia (< 1% or 1–5% of normal FVIII activity, respectively) and did not present detectable inhibitors at the time of PK analysis. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) varied among studies, ranging between 4 and 12.5 IU L −1 (median = 10 IU L −1 ) and samples that were below limit of quantification (BLQ) comprised 6.9% of the dataset. Demographic details of the modelling dataset can be found in Table 2 .

Population modelling
PopPK model building was performed using non-linear mixed effects modelling techniques implemented in NONMEM and PDxPop (v7.3 and v5.2, respectively; ICON Development Solutions, Ellicott City, MD, USA). Graphical analysis was conducted in MATLAB (R2017b, Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA). Samples that were BLQ were handled using the M3 method [ ].
First, the structural component of the model was developed. The model describes not only the exogenous dose administered, but also endogenous FVIII production and any residual FVIII from prior doses as trials did not necessarily include a washout period. $$C\left( t \right) = Ae^{ - \alpha t} + Be^{ - \beta t} + endogenous\; FVIII + (predose - endogenous)e^{ - \beta t}$$
The endogenous FVIII component was considered to be constant; when the endogenous level was unknown or unmeasurable, it was assumed to be half of the LLOQ. Residual exogenous FVIII decayed according to the terminal rate constant; if no predose measurement was taken, it was assumed that there was no exogenous FVIII remaining when the dose was administered. The standard 1- and 2-compartment models were tested. For each, three different residual error models were explored: additive, proportional, and combined additive/proportional.
Following this step, between subject variability (BSV) terms were added to PK parameters using an exponential form. For example: $$CL_{i} = CL_{pop} \cdot e^{{\eta_{i} }}$$ where \(CL_{i}\) is an individual’s clearance, \(CL_{pop}\) is the population value for clearance, and \(\eta_{i}\) is the individual’s deviation from population value. The \(\eta\) values follow a normal distribution with a mean of zero, such that the PK parameters are log-normally distributed. Decision-making during these steps was driven by changes in the objective function value (ΔOFV) and shrinkage of the random effects.
The inclusion of explanatory covariates helps to minimize unpredictable BSV. Only covariates that were consistently available for all data sources were investigated; these included body weight, fat-free mass (calculated from body weight, age, and height using the maturation model defined by Al-Sallami et al. [ ]), age, and brand. Preliminary covariate analysis consisted of examining plots of \(\eta\) -values versus each covariate. Covariates were then added to the model in a stepwise manner, and either kept or removed based on their effect on OFV, BSV, and parameter estimates. Body weight, fat-free mass, and age were incorporated prior to brand so that demographic differences between datasets were not falsely attributed to brand. Body size metrics were modelled using allometric functions; a variety of functions were considered to model the age effect. Power, linear, and piecewise linear relationships are shown below: $$CL_{i} = CL_{pop} \cdot \left( {\frac{{cov_{i} }}{{cov_{med} }}} \right)^{{\theta_{{\text{cov} - CL}} }} \cdot e^{{\eta_{i} }}$$ $$CL_{i} = CL_{pop} \cdot \left( {1 + \theta_{cov - CL} \cdot \frac{{cov_{i} - cov_{med} }}{{cov_{med} }}} \right) \cdot e^{{\eta_{i} }}$$ $$CL_{i} = CL_{pop} \cdot \left( {1 + \theta_{cov - CL} \cdot \hbox{max} \left( {0,\frac{{cov_{i} - cov_{med} }}{{cov_{med} }}} \right)} \right) \cdot e^{{\eta_{i} }}$$ where \(cov_{i}\) is the individual’s value for the covariate, \(cov_{med}\) is the median value for the covariate, and \(\theta_{cov - CL}\) is the estimated effect of the covariate on CL.
After taking body size and age effects into account, the effect of brand was explored. Initially, each brand was modelled with its own covariate effect either on CL and V 1 . $$CL_{i} = CL_{pop} \cdot \left( {1 + \theta_{Brand1 - CL} \cdot Brand_{1} } \right) \cdot \left( {1 + \theta_{Brand2 - CL} \cdot Brand_{2} } \right) \cdots \cdot \left( {1 + \theta_{Brand7 - CL} \cdot Brand_{7} } \right) \cdot e^{{\eta_{i} }}$$ where \(Brand_{i} = 1\) if the individual was dosed with Brand \(i\) ; otherwise, \(Brand_{i} = 0\) .
Subsequently, brands were grouped together according to results of the previous runs, or based on their source (e.g. plasma-derived, recombinant) and structure (e.g. full-length, B-domain deleted) in an effort to reduce the number of model parameters. Grouping schemes are delineated in Table 3 .

Model evaluation
The final SHL FVIII model was evaluated in several steps. First, graphical techniques were employed to assess the model’s goodness-of-fit and to assure that all model assumptions were met. Bootstrap analysis was also performed to assess estimated parameters and their associated confidence intervals. One thousand datasets consisting of 310 individuals were generated by randomly sampling the original dataset with replacement; to ensure all groups were represented in the bootstrap datasets, the original dataset was stratified according to age and brand. Parameter estimation was performed for each dataset and the median parameter estimates and corresponding 95% confidence intervals were calculated.
To evaluate the model for use in Bayesian forecasting, internal cross validation and limited sampling analysis were performed. A fivefold cross validation was performed, meaning the dataset was randomly split into 2 subsets, one containing 80% of the data (the learning subset) and the other the remaining 20% (the validation subset). Relative error on individual PK parameters was calculated using the following equation: $$Relative\;Error = \frac{{P_{CV} - P_{full} }}{{P_{full} }}$$ where \(P_{CV}\) is the individual parameter estimate (CL, V 1 , half-life) obtained during the cross validation using Bayesian forecasting and \(P_{full}\) is the “true” value estimated from the initial dataset.
Limited sampling analysis can be used to determine how well the model can predict individual PK parameters from sparse samples. Using a method similar to that described by Brekkan [ ], a population of 1000 virtual subjects was generated from the final SHL FVIII model using covariate distributions from the original dataset. For each virtual subject, a treatment regimen corresponding to 50 IU kg −1 on a Monday-Wednesday-Friday schedule was simulated for 4 weeks, with the last Friday dose being used for analysis. Different limited sampling schemes consisting of convenient sampling times (e.g. predose, peak, 24 h post-infusion) are described in detail in Table S3; a total of 34 designs were tested. Each design was used to obtain estimates of individual PK parameters using Bayesian forecasting, and estimates from the limited sampling strategies were compared to those obtained from the full sampling design using the following equation: $$Relative\;Error = \frac{{P_{LSS} - P_{full} }}{{P_{full} }}$$ where \(P_{LSS}\) is the parameter estimate from the limited sampling strategy and \(P_{full}\) is the parameter estimate from the rich sampling design.
External evaluation was performed using data extracted from the WAPPS-Hemo database. Using Bayesian forecasting, PK outcomes including clearance, central volume, half-life, and time with FVIII activity above 2% (TAT2%) were estimated using both the generic SHL FVIII model and a brand-specific model as available on WAPPS. The evaluation dataset was extracted on September 14, 2018 and contained PK for 394 patients on three brands of factor product: Kovaltry (full-length rFVIII), ReFacto AF (BDDrFVIII), and Fanhdi/Alphanate (intermediate purity pdFVIII, not included in the modelling dataset). PK data for Xyntha, a BDDrFVIII product produced using the same manufacturing process as ReFacto AF but calibrated using a different assay, was also included in the evaluation; Xyntha doses were scaled by a factor of 1.38 to account for the difference in calibration, as done in Abrantes et al. [ ]. Patients in the validation dataset ranged between < 1 and 78 years of age and weighed between 10.6 and 138.8 kg.
Results
An abridged log of model building steps is found in Table S1. A 2-compartment structure with a combined residual error model and random effects on clearance (CL) and central volume (V 1 ) was found to be the superior base model; random effects were not included on intercompartmental clearance (Q) or peripheral volume (V 2 ) due to high shrinkage (> 40%). Of the two body size metrics available, fat-free mass had the strongest correlation with \(\eta_{CL}\) and \(\eta_{{V_{1} }}\) (0.558 and 0.808, respectively) and provided the greatest improvement to the model in terms of both OFV (ΔOFV = − 485) and unexplained BSV on CL (Δω CL = − 10.5%) and V 1 (Δω V1 = − 28.1%). The addition of a fat-free mass effect on V 2 further reduced the OFV by 116. Based on covariate plots (shown in Fig. S1), the effect of age on CL was explored. Power, linear, and piecewise linear functions for the age effect were investigated. Ultimately, a piecewise linear function with no age effect below the median age was selected.
After accounting for body size and age, there still appeared to be significant differences across brands as shown in Fig. 2 . Initially, a unique effect for CL and V 1 was estimated for each brand. In an effort to reduce the number of model parameters, brands were grouped in a number of ways. We began by estimating an individual effect on CL and V 1 for each of the brands included in the dataset, using Advate as the reference brand (Table 3 , Scheme 1). Based on the results of this run, effects were either removed (when effect sizes were below 10%) or combined (when effect sizes were within 10% of one another). The brand-specific effects of Kogenate, NovoEight, and Octanate on V 1 were removed, but no brands were similar enough to group (Table 3 , Scheme 2). We also explored a grouping scheme based on the source and structure (Table 3 , Schemes 3 and 4, respectively) of the factor products. While grouping scheme 2 produced the lowest OFV (25325), grouping scheme 4 was ultimately selected for the final model. This decision was driven by the objective of building a model that can be used for all SHL FVIII products. Since grouping scheme 4 is based on the source and structure of the product, choosing a group for a product not included in the model dataset is intuitive. Although OFV is somewhat increased for this scheme (ΔOFV = + 64), parameter estimates (including BSV) were relatively unchanged. The final model is summarized by the following expression: Fig. 2 Boxplots of \(\eta\) -values for clearance (left) and central volume (right) across brands before (top) and after (bottom) inclusion of brand as a covariate $$\left\{ {\begin{array}{*{20}c} {\begin{array}{*{20}c} {CL = CL_{pop} \cdot \left( {\frac{FFM}{53.0}} \right)^{{\theta_{FFM - CL} }} \cdot \left( {1 + \theta_{AGE - CL} \cdot max\left( {0,\frac{AGE - 21.0}{21.0}} \right)} \right) \cdot \left( {1 + \theta_{PD - CL} \cdot PD} \right) \cdot \left( {1 + \theta_{BDD - CL} \cdot BDD} \right) \cdot e^{{\eta_{CL} }} } \\ {V_{1} = V_{1 pop} \cdot \left( {\frac{FFM}{53.0}} \right)^{{\theta_{{FFM - V_{1} }} }} \cdot \left( {1 + \theta_{{PD - V_{1} }} \cdot PD} \right) \cdot \left( {1 + \theta_{{BDD - V_{1} }} \cdot BDD} \right) \cdot e^{{\eta_{{V_{1} }} }} } \\ \end{array} } \\ {\begin{array}{*{20}c} {Q = Q_{pop} } \\ {V_{2} = V_{2 pop} \cdot \left( {\frac{FFM}{53.0}} \right)^{{\theta_{{FFM - V_{2} }} }} } \\ \end{array} } \\ \end{array} } \right\}$$ where \(PD = 1\) for plasma-derived products and \(BDD = 1\) for B-domain deleted products.
Goodness-of-fit plots indicate that the model described the data well, with R 2 values of 0.748 and 0.945 for the population and individual predictions, respectively (Fig. 3 ). Plots of the residual errors suggest that all assumptions of normality are followed, and the pcVPC demonstrates an adequate description of both median values and variability across all time points (Fig. 4 ). Bootstrap analysis demonstrated the model’s stability; RSE % was ≤ 30% for all parameters except those associated with the PD brand group (RSE % ≈ 50%; Table 4 , Fig. S2) and the additive error component (≥ 90%), which was subsequently removed. Internal cross-validation was performed to evaluate the model’s utility for Bayesian forecasting. The results summarized in Table S2 and Fig. S3 show low errors (95th percentile of error < 2%) on all parameters of interest (CL, V 1 , half-life, and TAT2%). Optimal sampling analysis further evaluated the model’s ability to accurately estimate PK parameters from sparsely sampled data. Estimates of half-life and time to 2% (TAT2%) from sampling designs containing 2–3 levels were generally within 15% of those obtained from the rich sampling design (Fig. 5 ). Errors appear to be largest in sampling schemes that contain only a 72 h point in the tail of the curve, as this sample is likely to be BLQ for a significant proportion of the virtual population. The full results of the optimal sampling analysis can be found in Table S3.

Using data from the 394 patients collected through the WAPPS-Hemo network, we compared the performance of the generic SHL FVIII model to brand-specific models for FVIII products in each of the brand groups of the final model: Kovaltry (full-length rFVIII), ReFacto AF/Xyntha (BDDrFVIII), and Fanhdi/Alphanate (pdFVIII). In each case, Bayesian forecasting produced similar estimates of clearance, central volume, half-life, and TAT2% (Fig. 6 ) from both models (Kovaltry: \(R^{2} =\) 0.94–0.97; ReFacto AF/Xyntha: \(R^{2} =\) 0.86–0.94; Fanhdi/Alphanate: \(R^{2} =\) 0.94–0.99); the correlation is slightly poorer in the ReFacto AF comparison as the comparator model has a one-compartment structure.

Discussion
This study describes the development and evaluation of a generic PopPK model for SHL FVIII products, built on a dataset containing data measured using the one-stage assay for seven different brands of SHL FVIII. The estimates of population PK parameters were similar to those reported in published brand-specific models despite differences in modelling data, approach, and objective (Table 5 ). Fat-free mass explained a significant portion of the BSV on CL and V 1 and was likely superior to total body weight due to its better correlation to plasma volume. Age was also found to be a significant covariate for CL, possibly acting as a surrogate for changes in levels of vWF [ ], an important predictor of FVIII clearance [ ]. It has been shown that vWF levels increase with age in hemophilia A patients [ ], resulting in lower clearance and longer half-lives among older patients. The choice of a piecewise linear function to describe this age effect was primarily due to high correlation between FFM and age in children and teenagers. Including both covariates for patients in this age range produces a falsely high estimate of the FFM effect on CL, which in turn results in half-life estimates decreasing when FFM increases. As in the brand-specific models developed for WAPPS-Hemo, the median age (21 years) was selected as the cut-off for the age effect; this value is physiologically plausible, as vWF levels are fairly stable up to this age [ ] and the correlation between age and FFM is much weaker after puberty (Fig. S4). Unfortunately, vWF could not be directly included in the model because patient vWF levels were not available for all brands in the modelling dataset; blood group (which can also act as a surrogate for vWF) was also not available consistently and therefore could not be included. However, published models for FVIII that include vWF or blood group as covariates on CL had similar unexplained BSV on CL; moreover, unexplained BSV on CL only decreased by 5–8% after adding vWF or blood group compared to the base or structural model [ , ]. For the final SHL FVIII model described here, unexplained BSV on CL and V 1 remained high (42% and 31%, respectively) in the final SHL FVIII, even after incorporation of explanatory covariates; one possible explanation for this observation is inter-laboratory variability, as the modelling dataset was compiled from numerous sources. For the one-stage assay, this variability has been estimated to be around 10% for peak levels, but closer to 35% at levels below 50 IU L −1 [ , , , ].

This model was developed with two purposes in mind. First, the model is intended for use in Bayesian analysis to produce accurate estimations of relevant PK parameters from sparse patient data. To evaluate the model for this purpose, fivefold cross-validation and optimal sampling analysis were performed, the results of which indicate the model is well-suited for this purpose. Secondly, it was hoped that by combining data from a variety of SHL FVIII products, we could develop a model that performs Bayesian estimation accurately for all brands of SHL FVIII, including those not included in the modelling dataset. To assess this capability, we compared the estimates of PK parameters for 49 patients on Fanhdi/Alphanate (a plasma-derived SHL FVIII) produced by the generic SHL FVIII model and a dedicated Fanhdi/Alphanate model [ ]. Agreement between the estimates from each model was good (R 2 ≥ 0.94 for \(y = x\) regression for all parameters), suggesting that the models produce similar predictions of the parameters of interest. Based on these results, the model seems capable of predicting PK for brands outside the original covariate space, and may prove to be especially valuable for brands for which there is no dedicated PopPK model. An additional strength of the model is the ability to leverage pediatric data from other produts when brand-specific pediatric data is unavailable.
Although it performed well in all evaluations, the model does have some limitations and there may be some instances in which a brand-specific model is more appropriate. For example, the covariate model of the SHL FVIII model was limited to values that were available across all seven brands. It is well known that additional covariates such as vWF, blood group, and hematocrit can be useful for predicting the PK of FVIII; a brand-specific model may allow for the incorporation of these covariates, resulting in lower unexplained BSV. Additionally, the modelling dataset does not contain pediatric PK data for all of the included brands; NovoEight alone represents over 60% of the data for children under the age of 5. If estimating PK in young patients, a brand-specific model may be preferable, provided that the model is built on enough patients, with an adequate proportion of the data coming from children. On the contrary, the SHL FVIII model allows for the leveraging of pooled pediatric data and may prove extremely useful in cases where data in young patients is lacking.
Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a generic PopPK model for plasma-derived and recombinant SHL FVIII products measured using the one-stage assay. Fat-free mass, age, and brand of factor product were found to significantly influence PK parameters. All evaluation steps suggest that the model is fit for Bayesian forecasting and capable of accurately predicting individual PK for SHL FVIII, including brands outside the original covariate space.
