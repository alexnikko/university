Introduction
Many epidemiological studies, most of which have been published since the last decade of the twentieth century, described that respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, as well as general morbidity and mortality, may be associated with increased values of air pollutants, especially particulate matter (PM) [ , , ]. More recent meta-analyses also suggest that short-term exposure (i.e., 3–7 days before the event) to PM 10 or PM 2.5 (i.e., PM with aerodynamic diameter of < 10 or < 2.5 μm, respectively) and to gaseous pollutants originated from combustion processes such as nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) may increase both incidence and mortality of stroke [ , , , ]. The effect of transient increases of air pollutants are thought to be mediated by a combination of autonomic, hemostatic, inflammatory and vascular endothelial disturbances, which ultimately lead to substantial abnormalities in cardiac and vascular function [ , , ]. To the best of our knowledge, no reliable data have been published about the possible influence of air pollutants on the risk of fatal stroke and potentially fatal neurological deterioration after intravenous thrombolysis (IVT). IVT with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) within 4.5 h of stroke onset is one of the few evidence-based acute stroke treatments; however, the number of patients who may be treated remains relatively small. In the subjects receiving rt-PA, the natural history of ischemic stroke can be modified through effective restoration of cerebral blood flow and neurological deficits may improve or resolve, but clinical deterioration can occur secondary to hyperperfusion of the tissue due to late recanalization or reocclusion of the artery.
Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the possible association of short- and medium-term exposure to PM and NO 2 with the risk of 3-month mortality in stroke patients undergoing IVT. A secondary aim was to explore whether short- and medium-term exposures to PM and NO 2 were correlated with 3-month functional outcome and associated with causes of neurological deterioration after IVT including symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), cerebral edema (CED), and persistence or new appearance of hyperdense cerebral artery sign (HCAS).
Materials and methods
Study design
We conducted a retrospective analysis based on data prospectively collected from 996 consecutive ischemic stroke patients treated with IVT, who were consecutively admitted to the Stroke Unit of the University Hospital of Verona, between January 2007 and February 2016. All patients were registered in the Safe Implementation of Treatment in Stroke-International Stroke Thrombolysis Register (SITS-ISTR). The baseline and demographic characteristics, stroke severity, risk factors, time logistics, imaging data, and 3-month outcome data were systematically collected. Neurological and functional scores according to the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) were recorded as for clinical routine.
The data about air pollution were obtained from the Regional Environmental Protection Agency (ARPAV) [ ] of the Veneto Region (Italy). The ARPAV has permanent monitors, which provide daily data on air pollution (24-hours averages) of the entire district of the town of Verona (a geographical area with a population of approximately 270,000 inhabitants), which includes both the centre of the town and its suburbs. All measurements of the different pollution agents are regularly validated by standardized quality control procedures [ ]. The analyzers used for PM 10 , PM 2.5 , NO 2 are based on a filtering pre-treatment of air sample, aspirated by an appropriate pump system, and the quantitative assessment is then performed with a gravimetric method, as specified in ARPAV website [ ]. Daily data on PM and NO 2 concentrations are typically expressed as 24-h averages. A hazard cutoff of 50 µg/m 3 is usually chosen for PM 10 exposure, since this value is in agreement with the current 24-h limit value for protection of human health according to the European Union (EU) [ ]. Contrary to PM 10 , no daily limit value has been currently established by the EU for PM 2.5 and NO 2 . The “short-term” exposure has been defined as exposure in the last 3 days before stroke, and the “medium-term” exposure as exposure in the last 4 weeks, in agreement with the Joint World Health Organization (WHO)/Convention Task Force on Health Aspects of Air Pollution [ ]. All patients living in our selected geographical area (i.e., the town of Verona and suburbs), for which complete data of 24-h PM and NO 2 levels were available, were finally included in our study, whereas those who were not resident in the town or in the immediate neighborhood (i.e., within a 10-km radius from the air-quality monitoring station) were excluded. In addition, patients treated with endovascular procedures after IVT and without follow-up data at 3 months were also excluded from the study.
Outcome measures
Mortality within 3-month from IVT was identified as the main outcome measure. To assess the 3-month functional outcome of the survivors, we used the mRS score as an ordinal scale from 0 to 5, (excluding 6, i.e., death), because it usually requires a smaller sample size to demonstrate effect than dichotomous outcomes [ ]. The other secondary outcome measures were the following causes of neurological deterioration after IVT: (1) ICH (any type of ICH radiologically classified according to the Safe Implementation of Thrombolysis in Stroke-Monitoring Study [SITS-MOST] protocol) [ ], (2) CED (any type of CED radiologically classified according to the SIST-MOST protocol) [ ], and (3) HCAS (persistence or new appearance of HCAS) defined according to follow-up CT scan at 24–36 h (or earlier when imaging scan was needed due to worsening of clinical conditions) combined with symptomatic neurological deterioration (an increase of ≥ 1 NIHSS point from baseline or death) within 7 days of IVT.
Statistical analysis
Differences between groups were assessed with 2-tailed Fisher exact test for dichotomous variables and Student’s T-Test or Mann–Whitney test or 1-way ANOVA for continuous variables, when appropriate. Proportions were calculated for categorical variables, by dividing the number of events for the total number after exclusion of missing/unknown cases. Continuous variables were reported as mean (standard deviation [SD]). A value of P < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
A correlation was performed between outcome measure and daily data of PM or NO 2 recorded in the 3 days and 4 weeks before the stroke (entered as continuous variables). Moreover, a correlation was also performed between outcome measures and the rate of PM 10 levels > 50 µg/m 3 exposure in the short- and medium-term period.
For each level of PM and NO 2 , linearity in the logit was assessed via Box-Tidwell transformation. After establishing that linearity was not a concern, the possible association of PM and NO 2 levels with outcome measures was estimated with different regression models. The possible association with 3-month mortality was estimated with a Cox proportional hazards regression model adjusted each time by all variables with a probability value < 0.10 in the univariate analysis. Hazard Ratios (HR) were reported with two-sided 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). The possible correlation with 3-month mRS score from 0 to 5 was estimated with an ordinal regression model adjusted each time by using all variables with a probability value < 0.10 in the univariate analysis. The possible association with the other secondary outcome measures were estimated with a logistic regression model adjusted each time by using all variables with a probability value < 0.10 in the univariate analysis, when the association was found to be significant in the unadjusted analysis. Odds Ratios (OR) were reported with two-sided 95% CI. Kaplan–Meier curves were finally used to estimate the different survival rate according to the 50 µg/m 3 cutoff for PM 10 exposure in the short- and medium-term period, and the cumulative risk of death. The statistical analysis was performed with SPSS version 22.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA).
Results
A total number of 47 (4.7%) patients ought to be excluded from the original sample (i.e., 996 patients) since they were resident over 10-km radius from the air-quality monitoring station, 3 (0.3%) patients were excluded because they were treated with endovascular procedures after IVT, and 2 (0.2%) patients due to lack of data on 3-month follow-up. Therefore, our final study population consisted in 944 patients.
Table 1 shows the differences of the clinical characteristics and values of air pollutants before stroke in our patient population according to the main outcome (i.e., 3-month mortality). Briefly, 3-month mortality occurred in 115/944 (12.2%) patients, and these were older, more disabled before stroke onset, and more frequently had hypertension, atrial fibrillation (AF), congestive heart failure, and HCAS on baseline CT scan. NIHSS score, PM and NO 2 values in the short- and medium-term period were found to be higher in patients who died within 3 months of IVT than in those who survived, whereas the values of diastolic blood pressure (BP) were higher in patients who survived than in those who died within 3 months of IVT. All causes of symptomatic neurological deterioration were also more frequent in patients who died within 3 months of than in those who survived.

Univariate cox regression analysis revealed that older age, hypertension, AF, congestive heart failure, pre-stroke mRS score > 0, higher baseline NIHSS score, lower diastolic BP, higher glucose levels, and hyperdense artery sign were associated with higher rate of 3-month mortality. In the unadjusted regression model, higher values of PM 2.5 and PM 10 in the last 3 days and 4 weeks, and PM 10 values > 50 µg/m 3 in the last 3 days and 4 weeks before stroke were associated with higher rates of 3-month mortality (Supplemental Table 1). In the adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression model, higher values of PM 2.5 and PM 10 in the last 3 days before stroke were found to be independently associated with a higher rate of 3-month mortality (HR 1.014, 95% CI 1.005–1.024, p = 0.003, and HR 1.079, 95% CI 1.055–1.103, p = 0.001, respectively) (Supplemental Table 1). Higher values of PM 2.5 and PM 10 in the last 4 weeks before stroke were found to be independently associated with a higher rate of 3-month mortality (HR 1.019, 95% CI 1.005–1.032, p = 0.008, and HR 1.015, 95% CI 1.004–1.027, p = 0.007, respectively) (Supplemental Table 1). PM 10 values > 50 µg/m 3 in the last 3 days and 4 weeks before stroke were independently associated with a higher rate of 3-month mortality (HR 1.675, 95% CI 1.103–2.544, p = 0.016, and HR 1.694, 95% CI 1.072–2.676, p = 0.024, respectively) (Supplemental Table 1). Older age, and higher baseline NIHSS score were the other variables that remained independent predictors after each multivariate analysis (Supplemental Table 1). The Kaplan–Meier survivor analysis showed that a 50 µg/m 3 cutoff for PM 10 at 3 days and 4 weeks was associated with a greater risk of cumulative 3-month mortality (Fig. 1 ).

Kaplan–Meier survivor analysis showed that values of PM 10 > 50 µg/m 3 in the last 3 days and in the last 4 weeks before stroke onset were associated respectively with an approximately 1.8 and 1.6 fold higher risk of 3-month mortality
Data of 3-month mRS score of the survivors were available in 701 (74.3%) patients. Differences of PM and NO 2 levels among the groups of patients with and without data on 3-month mRS score are provided in the Supplemental Table 2. PM and NO 2 levels in survivors without data of 3-month mRS score were higher than in survivors with mRS score 0–2, and similar to patients with mRS score 3–5 or 6.
The 3-month mRS score was 0 in 268 (38.2%) patients, 1 in 108 (15.4%) patients, 2 in 97 (13.8%) patients, 3 in 91 (13%) patients, 4 in 99 (14.1%) patients, and 5 in 38 (5.4%) patients. Symptomatic ICH occurred in 52/887 (5.9%) patients, symptomatic CED in 109/887 (12.3%) patients, and symptomatic persistence or new appearance of HCAS in 52/887 (5.9%) patients.
Univariate ordinal regression analysis revealed that older age, female sex, hypertension, AF, congestive heart failure, pre-stroke mRS score > 0, higher baseline NIHSS score, and hyperdense artery sign were correlated with higher values of 3-month mRS score from 0 to 5. In the unadjusted ordinal regression model, higher values of PM and NO 2 in the last 3 days and 4 weeks, and PM 10 values > 50 µg/m 3 in the last 3 days before stroke were correlated with higher values of 3-month mRS score from 0 to 5 (Supplemental Table 3). In the adjusted ordinal regression model, higher values of PM 2.5 and PM 10 in the last 3 days before stroke were found to be independently correlated with higher values of 3-month mRS score from 0 to 5 (OR 1.013, 95% CI 1.004–1.022, p = 0.005 and OR 1.009, 95% CI 1.002–1.017, p = 0.018, respectively) (Supplemental Table 3). Higher values of PM 2.5 , PM 10 , and NO 2 in the last 4 weeks before stroke were found to be independently correlated with higher values of 3-month mRS score from 0 to 5 (OR 1.014, 95% CI 1.002–1.026, p = 0.024, OR 1.011, 95% CI 1.001–1.022, p = 0.027, and OR 1.015, 95% CI 1.002–1.029, p = 0.026, respectively) (Supplemental Table 3). Older age, female sex, pre-stroke mRS score > 0, higher baseline NIHSS score, and hyperdense artery sign were the variables that remained independently correlated with higher 3-month mRS score form 0 to 5 after each multivariate analysis (Supplemental Table 3).
Univariate analysis revealed that higher glucose levels, higher baseline NIHSS score, and hyperdense artery sign were associated with higher rates of symptomatic CED. In the unadjusted regression model, higher values of PM 2.5 , PM 10 , and NO 2 in the last 3 days and 4 weeks, and PM 10 values > 50 µg/m 3 in the last 3 days before stroke were associated with higher rates of symptomatic CED (Supplemental Table 4). In the adjusted regression model, higher levels of PM 2.5 and PM 10 in the last 4 weeks before stroke were found to be independently associated with a higher rates of symptomatic CED (OR 1.023, 95% CI 1.007–1.040, p = 0.006, and OR 1.017, 95% CI 1.003–1.032, p = 0.021, respectively) (Supplemental Table 4). Higher glucose levels, higher baseline NIHSS score, and hyperdense artery sign were the other variables that remained independent predictors of symptomatic CED after all the multivariate analyses (Supplemental Table 4).
In the univariate analysis, no significant association was observed between PM or NO 2 levels and other causes of neurological deterioration (Supplemental Tables 5 and 6). In the multivariate analysis, older age and higher baseline NIHSS score were the variables that remained independent predictors of symptomatic ICH (Supplemental Table 5). In the multivariate analysis, higher glucose levels and hyperdense artery sign were the variables that remained independent predictors of symptomatic persistence or new appearance of HCAS (Supplemental Table 6).
Discussion
The most interesting finding of this study is the association between 3-month mortality in stroke patients treated with IVT and a short- and medium-term higher exposure to PM, which was found to be independent from major confounders. PM 10 values > 50 µg/m 3 in the last 3 days and 4 weeks before stroke were also independently associated with a higher risk of 3-month mortality. Notably, higher PM values in the last 3 days and 4 weeks and higher NO 2 values in the last 4 weeks before stroke were found to be independently correlated with higher values of 3-month mRS score among the survivors. Also, higher values of PM in the medium-term period were also independently associated with a higher risk of symptomatic CED; whereas no significant association was observed with other causes of neurological deterioration (i.e., symptomatic ICH and persistence or new appearance of HCAS).
In accordance with previous findings in populations of non-thrombolysed stroke patients [ , , , ], our study also shows that higher levels of air pollutants are consistently associated with enhanced risk of mortality after IVT with rt-PA. This is also in line with previous evidence showing that higher exposure to air pollutants had a negative impact on many health outcomes, causing higher morbidity and mortality from respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. In addition, a significant correlation between air pollutants levels and mRS score among the survivors was observed. Nevertheless, precise information about the possible association of exposure to air pollutants with functional outcome and potentially fatal causes of neurological deterioration after ischemic stroke in general, and after IVT in particular, has not been published so far to the best our knowledge.
Although the mechanisms underlying symptomatic neurological deterioration after IVT with rt-PA in stroke patients are complex and often overlapping, we found an independent association of higher values of PM in the last 4 weeks before stroke with symptomatic CED, but not with symptomatic ICH or persistence or new appearance of HCAS. A recent study showed that CED was frequent (28%) in thrombolysis-treated ischemic stroke patients, with a 10% frequency in patients with more severe disease [ ]. In this previous study, higher baseline NIHSS score, presence of HCAS on baseline CT scan and longer treatment delay were also associated with development of edema, whilst CED was a strong independent predictor of poor outcome (mRS score 3–6) and mortality within 3 months from IVT [ ]. Experimental data suggest that late reperfusion may increase infarct volume and lead to blood-brain-barrier (BBB) disruption [ , ], thus causing ICH and profuse vasogenic edema [ ]. Although the impact of reperfusion on CED development remains a matter of debate, the net effect of reperfusion depends on size, severity and duration of previous brain ischemia. Most likely, late reperfusion in an irreversibly damaged area of the brain leads to BBB disruption. The pathological process underlying development of CED after IVT with rt-PA could be magnified in patients exposed to higher values of PM in the medium-term period, since the prolonged contact with these air pollutants may contribute to impair the mechanisms maintaining BBB integrity and cerebral autoregulation through activation of pro-inflammatory and immune pathways, as well as by sustained activation the autonomic nervous system [ ]. Unfortunately, this explanation remains speculative since the underlying mechanisms cannot be definitely elucidated without using more sophisticated imaging techniques. Therefore, additional studies would be needed to clarify whether the exposure to air pollution may have an impact on the natural history of acute physiological changes, the mechanisms behind these changes, and the effect these changes have on unfavorable outcome of IVT in stroke patients.
This study has some inherent limitations, the first of which is the retrospective nature, potentially associated with collection and entry bias, and residual confounding. In particular, we could not adjust our analysis for individual differences, such as like socioeconomic class and ethnic origin. In addition, missing information about the secondary outcome measures may be a limitation of the study. A second possible limitation is represented by the lack of adjustment for the most common environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity and air pressure. Nevertheless, no study has ever been published about a potential link between environmental conditions and outcome after IVT, so that an impact of these variables on our findings remains unpredictable but yet to be demonstrated. Third, ambient PM is a heterogeneous mixture of various compounds (e.g., organic and elemental carbon, metals, sulfates, nitrates, and microorganisms) from multiple sources (e.g., traffic, manufacturing, power generation). Therefore, the predictive significance on CED and mortality in stroke patients receiving IVT of each of these components or sources, individually or in combination, remains unclear.
Conclusions
Our study suggests that higher exposure to PM in the last 3 days and 4 weeks before stroke may be associated with higher 3-month mortality after IVT, independently of many potentially confounding variables. Notably, we also found that higher exposure to PM in the last 4 weeks before the onset of stroke may be independently associated with symptomatic CED after IVT.
