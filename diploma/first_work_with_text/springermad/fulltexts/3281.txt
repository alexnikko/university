Introduction
Since the introduction of multiple-unit pellet systems (MUPS) tablets, they are increasingly favored over pellet-filled capsules due to advantages such as the avoidance of gelatin and high efficiency of tablet manufacturing ( , ). Besides modification of drug release rates, the pellet coat may be used to mask unpleasant taste and separate incompatible substances. Therefore, the coat integrity post-compaction is of great importance to achieve the desired outcome. Numerous approaches have been attempted to optimize the tableting process parameters and formulation variables in MUPS tableting. Formulation strategies can be broadly categorized into the modulation of the following: (i) pellet core, (ii) pellet coat, and (iii) cushioning excipients ( , ).
Various processing methods ranging from spray drying to extrusion-spheronization have been employed to produce cushioning excipients in the form of pellets/granules ( , , , , ). Compared to the unprocessed powders, pellets/granules are relatively larger in size, which helps to minimize segregation during tableting. Several authors have reported the usefulness of porous excipients as cushioning excipients in MUPS tableting. Yuasa et al . studied 14 different types of excipients (unprocessed powders) and found that film fracture of coated pellets was substantially reduced with porous calcium silicate ( ). In a bid to produce highly porous and deformable cushioning pellets, Habib et al . employed extrusion-spheronization to produce microcrystalline cellulose (MCC)-based pellets, which were then dehydrated by freeze-drying ( , ). However, the choice of excipients in the extrusion-spheronization process is greatly limited and revolves around MCC, a gold standard pelletization aid.
Besides typical applications of freeze-drying in the manufacture of biologics and parenterally-administered pharmaceutical products, the process has gradually expanded into other niche areas in the production of oral solid dosage forms ( ). Fundamentally, freeze-drying consists of three main stages: freezing, primary drying, and secondary drying. In primary drying, water is removed from the frozen sample by sublimation, resulting in a porous product. The morphology of the pores formed as a result of sublimation depends largely on the ice crystals formed during freezing, which affects the properties of the freeze-dried product ( , ). In bulk freeze-drying, the material is placed into a tray and dehydrated to form a cake ( , ). This method is suitable for materials that are not highly sensitive to oxygen or moisture ( ). Current applications of bulk freeze-drying in the pharmaceutical industry include lyophilization of active pharmaceutical ingredients for stability reasons ( ) and live microorganisms to produce dry powder probiotics ( ). To date, bulk freeze-drying as a processing method to develop specialized excipients is still a relatively unexplored area.
It was hypothesized that porous excipients with suitable cushioning effect could be produced by bulk freeze-drying cum milling. This approach is postulated to be more versatile and applicable to a wider range of materials than the conventional extrusion-spheronization-freeze-drying method ( , ) as discussed previously. In this study, three hydrophilic polymers, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, partially pregelatinised starch, and polyvinylpyrrolidone, without/with lactose, were employed. These polymers are commonly used as excipients in tablet formulations ( ). The physicomechanical properties and cushioning performance of the resultant freeze-dried products were evaluated. The results, which included particle rearrangement and compression behavior during compaction and drug release kinetics, were further analyzed to obtain a good understanding of the factors that impact on the cushioning function.
Materials and Methods
Materials
Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC, vLV grade; Dow Chemical, USA), partially pregelatinized starch (PGS; Colorcon, USA), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, K25 grade; Ashland Inc., USA), and lactose (Lac; GranuLac 200, Meggle Pharma, Germany) were used to prepare the freeze-dried products. Dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCP, Emcompress; Edward Mendell Co. Inc., USA), MCC (Avicel PH-102; FMC BioPolymer, USA), and MCC micropellets (Celphere CP-203; Asahi Kasei Chemicals Corporation, Japan) were used as reference materials in compression behavior studies. The unprocessed excipients were used as supplied for comparison in characterization studies.
Sugar pellets (Pharm-a-spheres, Hanns G. Werner, Germany) of size fraction 355–425 μm were used as pellet cores. The drug layer deposited on the cores consisted of HPMC vLV, PVP K17 (Ashland Inc., USA), and metformin (USP grade; Granules India, India) as the model drug. Aqueous ethylcellulose dispersion (Surelease; Colorcon, USA) was used as the overcoat to form the drug diffusion barrier. Magnesium stearate (Riedel-de Haën, Germany) and sodium starch glycolate (JRS Pharma, Germany) were added to the tablet formulation as the internal lubricant and disintegrant, respectively.
Methods
Preparation of Freeze-Dried Products
Formulations containing various compositions of HPMC, PGS, PVP, and lactose (Table I ) were prepared by adding the excipients in deionized water and mixed using an overhead stirrer (CAT R50D, Rose Scientific, Canada) until homogeneous dispersions were obtained. The solid content and final weight of the pre-lyophilized dispersions were 20%, w / w and 300 g respectively and freeze-dried (SMART LYO™ 2; GEA Lyophil, China) in open stainless steel trays according to the conditions shown in Fig. 1 . All formulations were prepared in triplicate batches.

The Roman numerals I, II, and III represent the freezing, primary drying, and secondary drying phases, respectively. Samples were unloaded from the freeze-dryer under ambient temperature (25°C) and pressure (1.01 × 10 6 μbar)
Preparation of Milled Freeze-Dried Cushioning Products
The freeze-dried products were processed using a cone mill (Comil U5, Quadro Engineering, Canada) with a 1575-μm aperture size grated screen and operated at 1000 rpm. The milled products were then sieved using a set of standard test sieves with aperture sizes in √2 progression from 125–1000 μm on a mechanical sieve shaker ( VS 1000, Retsch GmbH, Germany) for 10 min at 1 mm amplitude. All freeze-dried products were stored in desiccators containing silica beads.
Assessment of Morphology
The morphology of the sample was examined under a scanning electron microscope (JSM-6010LV, Jeol, Japan). Samples were mounted on aluminum studs using conductive carbon tapes and gold sputter coated (JFC-1100, Jeol, Japan) before observation.
Powder X-ray Diffraction Analysis
The crystalline or amorphous nature of the individual unprocessed excipients and freeze-dried products were determined using an X-ray powder diffractometer (XRD-6000, Shimadzu, Japan) with Cu K α radiation ( λ = 1.5406 Å) at a scanning rate of 2° (2 θ ) per min. As freeze-dried lactose was too hygroscopic to handle, the lactose dispersion was freeze-dried directly in the XRD sample holder for X-ray diffraction analysis.
Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
Interactions between the excipients present in the binary freeze-dried products were investigated by FTIR spectroscopy (Spectrum 100, PerkinElmer, USA) using the attenuated total reflection method to obtain infrared spectra of the samples. Background reading was taken before loading samples. Sixteen scans were each taken for the background and sample to obtain a good signal to noise ratio.
Determination of Moisture Content
An accurately weighed sample was dried at 105°C in a hot air oven for an hour and cooled in a desiccator for an hour before weighing. The moisture content was calculated by dividing the weight loss after drying with the original weight of the sample. Measurements were carried out in triplicates.
Size Analysis
The size range of unprocessed excipients was quantified by laser diffractometry (LS 230 Coulter, Coulter Corporation, USA) with a liquid module. Isopropyl alcohol was used as the dispersion medium for lactose, HPMC, and PGS while cyclohexane was used for PVP. Water was used as the dispersion medium for DCP and MCC. Measurements were carried out in triplicates and results averaged.
The size distribution of the milled freeze-dried products was determined by sieve analysis as described in the earlier section. The weight of the freeze-dried products retained on each sieve was determined and the cumulative weight undersize curve (with an upper limit of 1575 μm based on the aperture size of the sieve used in milling) was plotted to determine d 10 , d 50 , and d 90 , which are the diameters at the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles, respectively.
Study of Particle Rearrangement and Compression Behavior
The compression behavior of the materials was studied using the Heckel equation: $$ \ln \left(\frac{1}{1-D}\right)=\mathrm{KP}+A $$ (1) $$ {\rho}_{\mathrm{app}=}\frac{W_{\mathrm{c}}}{\pi {r}^2h} $$ (2) where P is the compression pressure and D is the ratio between apparent density ( ρ app ) of the compact and true density of the material determined using a helium pycnometer (Penta-pycnometer, Quantachrome, USA). The ρ app was calculated with Eq. 2 , where W c is the weight of the compact, r is the compact radius, and h is the compact thickness. K and A are the gradient and y-intercept of the linear portion of the Heckel plot (correlation coefficient greater than 0.998) respectively. The reciprocal of K was calculated to obtain the yield pressure values ( P y ).
The test material (400 mg) was weighed out individually for the preparation of compacts using the universal testing machine (Autograph AG-100kNE, Shimadzu, Japan) and 15-mm flat face punches. The compacts were prepared at constant compression speed of 10 mm/min while the compression pressure was varied in the range of 28.3–141.5 MPa. Compaction was carried out for five replicates at each pressure. The compact thickness was measured using a micrometer (Series 293; Mitutoyo, Japan).
The extent of particle rearrangement in the die was quantified using the following equations based on the A value obtained from the linear portion of the Heckel plot ( , ): $$ {D}_{\mathrm{a}}=1-{e}^{-A} $$ (3a) $$ {D}_{\mathrm{b}}={D}_{\mathrm{a}}-{D}_0 $$ (3b) where D a is the densification due to die filling, particle slippage, and rearrangement. D 0 is the initial relative density at the point where the applied pressure equals to zero. As D 0 values describe the initial rearrangement phase of densification due to die filling, low D 0 values would indicate loose packing ( ). The difference between D a and D 0 gives D b , which indicates density changes at low pressure due to particle movement and rearrangement prior to appreciable interparticle bonding.
Preparation of Coated Pellets
The sugar cores were coated with two consecutive layers, namely the drug layer followed by the controlled release layer using the FlexStream TM module (MP-1 Multi-processor, GEA-Aeromatic Fielder, UK). The coating solution for the drug layer consisted of 6%, w / w HPMC vLV, 1%, w / w PVP K17 and 20%, w / w metformin in deionized water. An amount of 2-kg sugar cores was coated under the following conditions: airflow rate of 140 m 3 /h, atomizing air pressure of 2.5 bar, spray rate of 20 g/min, inlet air temperature of 60°C, nozzle tip diameter of 0.8 mm, and tip protrusion of 1.2 mm. The nozzle was placed 9 mm away from the powder bed. The theoretical percent increase in dry weight of cores after drug layering was 27%.
For the controlled release layer, the required amount of aqueous ethylcellulose dispersion was diluted from 25%, w / w to 15%, w / w solids and stirred for approximately 1 h before use. The following conditions were used: airflow rate of 80 m 3 /h, atomizing air pressure of 2.5 bar, spray rate of 12 g/min, and inlet air temperature of 60°C. The nozzle was set up in the same manner as above. The theoretical increase in dry weight after coating was 15%, w / w . The dried pellets after coating were cured at 60°C for 18 h in a hot air oven. The coated pellets were sieved to obtain size fraction of 355–710 μm for subsequent studies.
Tableting of Coated Pellets
Tablets (1 g) containing 50%, w / w coated pellets, 44%, w / w cushioning excipient (355–710 μm), 5%, w / w sodium starch glycolate, and 1%, w / w magnesium stearate were prepared. The ingredients were weighed out individually and mixed in a glass container for each tablet. The mixture was compacted using the universal testing machine with 15-mm flat face punches at a compression speed of 10 mm/min and pressure of 28.3 MPa. The MUPS tablets produced were stored in a desiccator for at least 1 day before further analysis.
MUPS Tablet Disintegration Test
The disintegration tests were conducted according to the British Pharmacopoeia disintegration test for tablets and capsules (Test A, Appendix XII A, 2016) using a disintegration tester (DT2, Sotax, USA). The disintegration time of three tablets for each formulation was determined. The tablets comply with the test requirements if they disintegrate completely within 15 min.
Drug Release Study and Kinetic Modeling of Drug Release
Pellet coat damage post-compaction would increase the drug release rate from the tablets, which can be used to indirectly infer the effectiveness of cushioning excipients at minimizing coat damage. The dissolution studies were carried out according to the United States Pharmacopoeia basket method (Apparatus I) using a dissolution tester (9ST Dissolution Tester, Caleva, UK) with an automated sampler. The baskets were rotated at 100 rpm. Filtered samples were assayed spectrophotometrically (UV-1201, Shimadzu, Japan) at 233 nm at pre-determined time points. Dissolution tests were carried out in triplicates, with uncompacted drug pellets as control. Model-independent parameters, T 75% (time taken for 75% of drug to be released), mean dissolution time (MDT), and similarity factor ( f 2 ) were calculated to compare the drug release profiles using Eqs. 4 and 5 , respectively ( ). $$ \mathrm{MDT}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n{\overline{t}}_{\mathrm{mid}}\cdot \varDelta {M}_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n\varDelta {M}_i} $$ (4) where i is the dissolution sample number (i.e., i = 1 for data at 1st time point), n is the number of dissolution sampling time points and \( {\overline{t}}_{\mathrm{mid}} \) represents the time at the midpoint between i –1 and i . ΔM i is the difference in the amount of drug dissolved between i –1 and i . $$ {f}_2=50\times \log \left\{{\left[1+\left(\frac{1}{n}\right){\sum}_{t=1}^n{\left|{R}_t-{T}_t\right|}^2\right]}^{-0.5}\times 100\right\} $$ (5) where n is the number of dissolution sampling time points, R t and T t are the mean percentage drug release from the uncompacted drug pellets and MUPS tablets respectively at time t. Two identical profiles will result in a value of 100 while an average difference of 10% at all measured time points will result in a f 2 value between 50 and 100, which was taken to be the criterion for equivalence.
The drug release profiles of the uncompacted pellets and tablets were fitted to zero-order, first-order, and Korsmeyer-Peppas models to determine the kinetics of drug release using the DDSolver program ( ). Details of the models are given in Table II ( , ). Table II Release Models Tested Release model Equation a Description Zero-order Q t = Q 0 + K 0 t Drug release rate is constant and is independent of drug concentration First-order ln Q t = ln Q 0 + K 1 t Drug release rate is dependent on the drug concentration Korsmeyer-Peppas Q t / Q ∞ = K KP ⋅ t n n ≤ 0.45: Fickian diffusion; 0.45 < n < 0.89: non-Fickian diffusion (anomalous) ( , ) a where Q t is the amount of drug released at time t , Q 0 is the initial amount of drug in the product, K 0 is the zero-order release constant, K 1 is the first-order release constant, Q t /Q ∞ is the fraction of drug released at time t , K KP is the constant incorporating the structural and geometric characteristics of the drug dosage form and n is the release exponent indicative of the drug release mechanism
Statistical Analysis
One-way analysis of variance with post-hoc Bonferroni test was performed at a significance level of p = 0.05 using a statistical analysis software (IBM® SPSS® Statistics, version 21.0, USA).
Results and Discussion
Morphology of Unprocessed Excipients and Milled Freeze-Dried Products
SEM photomicrographs of the unprocessed excipients and milled freeze-dried products are presented in Fig. 2 . Unprocessed HPMC existed as elongated strands while unprocessed PGS and PVP were mostly irregular or in the form of spherical particles, respectively (Fig. 2 a–c). Fig. 2 SEM photomicrographs of a – c unprocessed excipients and d – i milled freeze-dried products
The milled freeze-dried products were distinctly different from their unprocessed counterparts. They were composed of irregular particulates with reticulated appearance, attributed to the shearing of the porous freeze-dried cake against the grated screen during milling. Differences in the reticulated appearance were observed. FD-PVP consisted of a more orderly arrangement of tubule-like crevices, while FD-HPMC was interspersed with crevices in a less orderly manner (Fig. 2 d, f). These observations are in agreement with reported findings of freeze-drying studies on HPMC and PVP ( ). In contrast, FD-PGS showed a sponge-like structure with more pronounced and regular pores (Fig. 2 e). The pores and crevices observed in the freeze-dried products were formed as a result of sublimation of ice crystals during the primary drying phase. The addition of lactose appeared to have little effect on the morphology of FD-HPMC and FD-PVP but it transformed FD-PGS to a multi-layered structure with large crevices (Fig. 2 g–i).
XRD and FTIR Spectroscopy Analyses of Milled Freeze-Dried Products
The XRD diffractograms of the unprocessed and freeze-dried polymers (Fig. 3 a–c) did not reveal any sharp and large peaks that are indicative of crystalline materials. It can be inferred that the long molecular chains of the polymers were arranged randomly, making large regions of highly structured morphology unlikely ( , ). In contrast, sharp and large peaks were observed at the 2 θ region of 18–22 deg. for both unprocessed and freeze-dried lactose, indicating their crystalline nature. Interestingly, disproportionately small peaks were observed in this region for FD-Lac-HPMC and FD-Lac-PGS (Figs. 3 a, b) and none observed for FD-Lac-PVP (Fig. 3 c), suggesting that the crystallinity of lactose was affected by freeze-drying with the polymers. Fig. 3 XRD diffraction patterns of a unprocessed HPMC, FD-HPMC, FD-Lac-HPMC, and FD-Lac; b unprocessed PGS, FD-PGS, FD-Lac-PGS, and FD-Lac and c unprocessed PVP, FD-PVP, FD-Lac-PVP, and FD-Lac and d unprocessed lactose and FD-Lac
The FTIR spectra of individual as well as physical blends of unprocessed excipients were obtained for comparison, where the spectra did not reveal significant interactions between the polymer and lactose in the physical blends. The FTIR spectra of the binary freeze-dried products and corresponding physical blend were largely superimposable for all three polymers. Theoretically, the ketone moiety of the PVP molecule may form hydrogen bond with lactose. However, the prominent C=O stretch around 1648 cm −1 for FD-Lac-PVP indicates the absence of significant hydrogen bonding between PVP and lactose (Fig. 4 c). Fig. 4 FTIR spectra of a unprocessed lactose, unprocessed HPMC, physical blend of HPMC with lactose, FD-HPMC, and FD-Lac-HPMC; b unprocessed lactose, unprocessed PGS, physical blend of PGS with lactose, FD-PGS, and FD-Lac-PGS and c unprocessed lactose, unprocessed PVP, physical blend of PVP with lactose, FD-PVP, and FD-Lac-PVP
Collectively, the results show that freeze-drying did not have significant effects on the polymer and lactose that might induce or negate any interactions between them. However, the bonding between the lactose molecules was affected by the presence of the polymer, leading to the loss of lactose crystallinity in the binary freeze-dried products. Therefore, freeze-drying the binary dispersion of polymer and lactose might produce a composite product with significantly different physicomechanical properties.
Particle Size Analysis of Milled Freeze-Dried Products
The particle size of the freeze-dried products milled under constant conditions was used to indicate the physicomechanical properties of the freeze-dried cake of the various formulations. FD-HPMC produced significantly larger particles than FD-PGS and FD-PVP ( p < 0.05) (Fig. 5 a). Examination of the freeze-dried cakes showed random cracks, which are manifestations associated with tension or stress during the formative process. Very fine hairline cracks were observed in FD-HPMC while large and extensive cracks were found in FD-PGS and FD-PVP, suggesting materials of different mechanical strength. Since size reduction is achieved by a process of crack propagation, the presence of large and extensive cracks facilitated the comminution of FD-PGS and FD-PVP into smaller particles ( , ). Fig. 5 Size distribution of milled freeze-dried products containing a polymers alone: FD-HPMC ( ), FD-PGS ( ), and FD-PVP ( ) and b polymer with lactose: FD-Lac-HPMC ( ), FD-Lac-PGS ( ), and FD-Lac-PVP ( )
Keeping the total weight of solids constant in the pre-lyophilized dispersions, the addition of lactose was accompanied by a reduction in polymer amount. This generally resulted in smaller particle size (Fig. 5 b) and was most pronounced for HPMC, highlighting the important contribution of HPMC to the mechanical strength of the freeze-dried cake. These observations were congruent with the greater extent of cracks in the FD-Lac-HPMC matrix, which increased the ease of fragmentation during milling. Hence, the mechanical strength and particle size of the milled product could be modulated by the type and proportion of polymer used in the formulation.
Compression Behavior of Milled Freeze-Dried Products
The compression behavior of unprocessed excipients and freeze-dried products were investigated to assess the influence of freeze-drying on the nature of the materials that may affect their cushioning performance (Table III ). The compression behavior of 2 types of MCC (a reference material that exhibits dominant plastic deformation when compressed) and DCP (a reference material that exhibits dominant fragmentation when compressed) was also determined in this study for comparison ( ). MCC Avicel PH-102 consisted of irregular particles that were smaller than the spherical MCC Celphere CP-203 particles.

The particle size is known to affect the compression behavior of materials ( ). As there is a significant size disparity between the unprocessed excipients and freeze-dried products (Table III ), the differences observed in the P y values cannot be ascribed entirely to the effect of freeze-drying. Hence, two different size fractions of freeze-dried products, 90–180 and 355–710 μm, were investigated to understand the effect of particle size on the compression behavior of the freeze-dried products. All the excipients were stored in desiccators with silica beads to minimize the effect of moisture. The moisture content of the excipients, which was less than 10% of the total weight, was not expected to have significant effect.
Comparison of D 0 and D b Values
The parameters, D 0 and D b , provide some insights on the packing ability of particles and extent of particle rearrangement and fragmentation ( ). All the unprocessed excipients had higher D 0 value than the milled freeze-dried products. Except for MCC Celphere-203, they also had generally smaller particle size, which accounted for better packing ability. The negative effect of the larger particle size of MCC Celphere-203 was compensated by its spherical particle shape, which favored close packing. Regardless of size fraction, FD-PVP had higher D 0 value than FD-HPMC and FD-PGS, indicating better packing within the die. Across all freeze-dried formulations, the larger size fraction had lower initial packing ability, which could be attributed to larger inter-particulate voids that prevented close packing of the particles ( ). The results showed that bulk freeze-drying allowed the formation of a cake that could be milled to produce particles of various size, physical structure, and packing ability.
A high degree of particle fragmentation under low compression pressure will increase the particle size distribution, thereby enabling greater particle rearrangement that results in higher D b value. Both MCC Celphere-203 and PVP had relatively low D b values, largely due to their close packing which would result in less space for particle rearrangement. The D b values of the blends were intermediate between those of the constituents. In contrast, the freeze-dried products had markedly higher D b values, indicating a much higher degree of particle rearrangement due to particle fragmentation under low compression pressure ( ). The larger size fraction (355–710 μm) had higher D b value than the corresponding smaller size fraction (90–180 μm), reflecting a greater propensity for fragmentation by larger particles. Within the same size fraction, the addition of lactose to HPMC or PGS decreased the D b value significantly, suggesting the formation of a composite of higher plasticity and unlikely to fragment under low compression pressure. This effect of lactose was not observed for PVP, as indicated by the insignificant difference in D b value ( p > 0.05) between FD-PVP and FD-Lac-PVP. Among the three polymers, HPMC consistently gave rise to freeze-dried products with the highest D b value. It can be inferred that FD-HPMC and FD-Lac-HPMC exhibited the greatest extent of rearrangement compared to the other corresponding freeze-dried products.
Comparison of P y
The P y obtained from the Heckel plot distinguishes between materials that consolidate mainly by fragmentation (e.g., DCP) or plastic deformation (e.g., MCC) ( ). Materials with higher P y generally exhibit lower plasticity and higher tendency to undergo fragmentation when compressed, resulting in denser packing ( , ). The unprocessed DCP had relatively high P y of 336.2 MPa while MCC Avicel PH-102 and MCC Celphere CP-203 had relatively low P y of 79.78 and 109.6 MPa, respectively. As indicated by higher P y , all the freeze-dried polymers exhibited lower plasticity than their unprocessed counterparts (Table III ). Among the three polymers, HPMC gave rise to freeze-dried products with one of the highest P y while PVP produced the lowest P y . The P y of FD-HPMC (186.1 MPa, 365.7 MPa) and FD-PGS (187.3 MPa, 225.3 MPa) were closer to that of DCP (336.2 MPa), while the P y of FD-PVP (114.2 MPa, 139.9 MPa) was closer to that of MCC. For the freeze-dried products, the two P y values given in the parentheses refer to the smaller size fraction (90–180 μm) and larger size fraction (355–710 μm), respectively. It can be inferred that the freeze-dried products were porous but they were susceptible to fragmentation and plastic deformation to different degree. HPMC and PGS favored fragmentation while PVP favored plastic deformation. Unlike the other two freeze-dried polymers, FD-PVP had tubule-like crevices in an orderly arrangement, which might have facilitated plastic deformation.
The compression behavior of the physical blends containing lactose and polymer (1:1) was also determined. The compression behavior of a binary powder blend usually presents as an intermediate between the blend components, with one component exhibiting a dominant effect on the powder densification behavior ( ). As indicated by the higher P y , the blends had lower plasticity than the individual polymers. In particular, the P y of Lac-PVP blend (138.2 MPa) was markedly higher than that of PVP alone (61.8 MPa) and MCC (79.8 MPa, 109.6 MPa). This suggests that the addition of lactose reduced the plasticity of the material. However, this effect of lactose was not observed in the freeze-dried products, where the addition of lactose decreased the P y and increased the plasticity for HPMC and PGS, but had little effect on PVP. Particle size analysis of the milled freeze-dried products revealed much lower d 50 and d 90 values when lactose was added to HPMC or PGS but little change was observed for PVP. As mentioned in the section on particle size analysis, the addition of lactose reduced the mechanical strength of the material, enabling greater particle size reduction. The increased plasticity of the freeze-dried products containing lactose could be attributed to this reduction in mechanical strength of the materials. Nevertheless, the P y of FD-Lac-HPMC, FD-Lac-PGS, and FD-Lac-PVP were still higher than that of MCC, indicating that the particles would exhibit a greater degree of fragmentation than MCC when compressed. The balance between these two aspects of the compression behavior is dependent on the freeze-dried formulation. Collectively, the results showed that lactose could improve the plasticity of freeze-dried HPMC and PGS, but not PVP.
Influence of the Freeze-Dried Products on Coated Film Damage During Tableting
The cushioning effect of the freeze-dried products and their unprocessed counterparts was investigated by comparing the dissolution profiles of the resultant MUPS tablets with that of the uncompacted pellets. The disintegration of all MUPS tablets was first evaluated to determine if the disintegration time had any significant impact on the dissolution profiles. Of the six tablet formulations containing freeze-dried products, those containing FD-HPMC and FD-Lac-HPMC had prolonged disintegration time of around 120 and 45 min, respectively. Tablets containing unprocessed HPMC had similarly long disintegration time. It was also visually observed that a hydrogel barrier formed around the tablets containing unprocessed HPMC or FD-HPMC. HPMC is commonly used in controlled release formulations and is known to form a hydrogel barrier, which reduces water penetration into the tablet and retards drug release ( ). The disintegration time of all the six tablet formulations exceeded 15 min. Hence, the disintegration time of the respective MUPS tablets had to be taken into consideration when the dissolution profiles were compared in this study. For a more comprehensive comparison, T 75% values were determined in addition to MDT and f 2 values (Table IV ).

Comparison of Drug Release Parameters
In this study, the function of the insoluble ethylcellulose layer was to control the release of the highly water-soluble drug, metformin, from the pellets (Fig. 6 ). The uncompacted drug pellets exhibited a drug release profile with an initial slow-release phase (0–30 min), a constant-release phase (30-60 min), and a declining-rate phase thereafter ( ). The T 75% and MDT of the uncompacted pellets were 154 and 94.7 min, respectively.

Drug release from tablets containing unprocessed excipients was generally faster compared to the tablets containing the freeze-dried products and the uncompacted pellets (Table IV , Fig. 6 ). The more rapid drug release was attributed to the damage inflicted on the pellet coat during compaction. Clearly, the freeze-dried products imparted greater cushioning effect than unprocessed excipients. Statistical difference ( p < 0.05) was found for T 75% and MDT between uncompacted pellets and all tablets, except those containing unprocessed HPMC. As reported in the literature, it was observed that a hydrogel barrier formed around the tablet containing unprocessed HPMC. The drug release was therefore expected to be slower, but the results showed insignificant change, suggesting that the pellet coats were damaged during compaction. The more rapid drug release from the damaged pellets was negated by the release retarding effect of the hydrogel barrier. Extrapolating from this explanation, the T 75% and MDT values of the tablets containing FD-HPMC, which were found to be higher than those of the tablets containing unprocessed HPMC, suggest little damage to the coat of the pellets compacted with FD-HPMC.
Among the tablets, only those containing unprocessed HPMC or FD-Lac-HPMC had f 2 value of at least 50, indicating that these tablets and the uncompacted pellets had similar drug release profiles. In the absence of the confounding effects of prolonged tablet disintegration and hydrogel barrier, the similar drug profiles would imply insignificant damage to the pellet coat and thus effective cushioning performance of the excipients. The tablets containing FD-Lac-HPMC exhibited faster disintegration than those containing unprocessed HPMC, which diminished the confounding effect of tablet disintegration on the evaluation of the cushioning effect through drug release. Hence, FD-Lac-HPMC potentially conferred greater protective cushioning effect to the pellet coats than unprocessed HPMC during compaction. The tablets containing FD-Lac-HPMC had higher f 2 value than those containing FD-HPMC, indicating that the drug release profile of the former tablets was closer to that of the uncompacted pellets. It can therefore be inferred that FD-Lac-HPMC imparted greater cushioning effect than FD-HPMC.
Kinetic Modeling of Drug Release
The drug release kinetics was analyzed by fitting different models into the dissolution data obtained (Table IV ). The criterion for choosing the most appropriate model was based on the best goodness of fit ( R 2 ), where R 2 value close to unity indicates excellent fit while negative R 2 value indicates extremely poor fit.
Drug release for the uncompacted pellets was best described by the first-order kinetics model ( R 2 = 0.974), which is aligned with the findings of other studies ( , ). The same was also observed for all tablets containing unprocessed excipients or freeze-dried products, except FD-HPMC. It could be inferred that the drug release was dependent on the drug concentration ( ), but any damage to the pellet coat would increase the drug release rate. FD-HPMC produced a hydrogel barrier around the tablet, which accounted for the better fit to zero-order release ( R 2 = 0.971) than first-order release ( R 2 = 0.948). The effect of the hydrogel barrier in tablets containing unprocessed HPMC was however less significant, suggesting more severe damage to the pellet coat and possible confounding effects of the sugar in the pellets.
The Korsmeyer-Peppas equation was fitted to the dissolution data for a better understanding of the drug release mechanism (Table II ). As the pellets were coated by an insoluble layer of ethylcellulose, drug release for the uncompacted pellets would occur by Fickian diffusion. This release mechanism was substantiated by the n value of the uncompacted pellets (0.508), which is close to 0.45, the upper limit corresponding to Fickian diffusion mechanism (Table II ). The tablets containing unprocessed excipients or freeze-dried products (excluding HPMC, FD-HPMC, and FD-Lac-HPMC) also showed Fickian diffusion-controlled release mechanism, as indicated by their n values of less than 0.45. The tablets containing unprocessed HPMC ( n = 0.577), FD-HPMC ( n = 0.875), or FD-Lac-HPMC ( n = 0.535) showed different extent of anomalous non-Fickian diffusion-controlled release mechanism, which could be attributed to drug diffusion through the gradually eroding hydrogel barrier. Among these, it could be inferred from the n value of FD-Lac-HPMC tablets that the ethylcellulose coating on the pellet played a more significant role in controlling the drug release from the tablet rather than the poor disintegration of the tablet, where the latter would have resulted in a diffusion mechanism that is based on erosion or relaxation control. As indicated by the high n value (0.875), this release mechanism was highly dominant in tablets containing FD-HPMC.
Relationship Between the Compression Behavior and the Cushioning Performance of Excipients
The freeze-dried products were found to impart much greater cushioning effect than the unprocessed excipients. Some studies have suggested a positive relationship between material plasticity and cushioning performance ( , , ). On the other hand, Stubberud et al . reported that volume reduction properties of the cushioning excipients via fragmentation were important for minimizing damage to ethylcellulose pellet coat during compaction ( ). Among the materials investigated in the present study, FD-Lac-HPMC emerged as the best cushioning excipient. Besides having little hydrogel barrier effect, it can be inferred from the compression behavior study that FD-Lac-HPMC exhibited a good balance of brittle and plastic properties. During tableting, the materials in the die will be subjected to progressive high compression pressure. As indicated by its relatively low D b value, FD-Lac-HPMC would fragment at low compression pressure and give rise to smaller particles, which would rearrange and fill the voids surrounding the coated pellets. This would reduce pellet-pellet contact, which could otherwise damage the pellet coat during tableting. At higher compression pressure, it was likely that the plastic deformation behavior of FD-Lac-HPMC would aid in dispersing the local stresses generated within the tablet. As a result, the deleterious impact of compression pressure on the pellet coats was reduced with FD-Lac-HPMC compared to the protection conferred by other freeze-dried products as shown from the drug release profiles. Hence, it was proposed that materials with a good balance of the desired brittle and plastic properties would confer more protective effect to the coated pellets.
Conclusion
This study demonstrated that bulk freeze-drying milling could be employed to develop highly porous and directly compressible particulates as cushioning excipients. This method was applicable to different polymers, which included HPMC, PVP, and PGS, and avoided the formulation challenges associated with the production of pellets/granules as cushioning excipients. The various formulations, comprising the polymer with/without lactose, were easily freeze-dried and milled to form particulates. The bulk freeze-drying process modified the materials in a unique manner which could impart cushioning properties. The structural morphology, mechanical strength, and compression behavior of the formulations were altered to varying extent. Freeze-dried HPMC and PGS exhibited a more brittle nature while freeze-dried PVP was more plastic. The addition of lactose to the polymers improved the plasticity of the freeze-dried products. It also shortened the tablet disintegration time and reduced the formation of HPMC hydrogel barrier. FD-Lac-HPMC gave the best cushioning performance, revealing that a good balance of brittle and plastic properties was more effective than either brittle or plastic properties for protecting the coated pellets during tableting. The novel bulk freeze-drying milling approach has great potential in the development of cushioning excipients from a wide range of materials.
