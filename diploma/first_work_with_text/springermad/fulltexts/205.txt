Highlights
Continuous head noises, tinnitus and cloud-like white matter hyperintensity in MRI are common in both IJV stenosis and CVS stenosis. Intracranial hypertension related headache, visual damage, and papilledema were more common and severe in CVS stenosis. The appearance of abnormal collateral-vessels is a key feature of IJV stenosis.
Introduction
Internal jugular vein (IJV) is well known as a continuation of the cerebral venous sinus (CVS) anatomically. IJV stenosis and CVS stenosis belong to two subsets of cerebral-jugular venous outflow insufficiency. Various pathological issues can result in IJV stenosis and/or CVS stenosis, leading to cerebral-jugular venous outflow disturbances, such as endoluminal lesions (giant arachnoid granule in transverse sinus, thrombosis, lengthy valve in IJV), the vessel wall disorders of CVS or IJV, and extraluminal compression (tumor, transverse or cervical process, etc.) [ , ].
CVS stenosis induced IH, which was easily misdiagnosed as idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Farb et al. found that more than 90% of the patients with so-called idiopathic intracranial hypertension have transverse sinus stenosis,[ ] and the increased ICP returned to normal after the transverse sinus stenosis was corrected by stenting [ , ]. In recent years, researchers figured that some IJV stenosis could induce IH, which can also be corrected by stenting. However, the majority of IJV stenosis had only mild or even normal intracranial pressure, and was also easily misdiagnosed or missed diagnosis [ ]. What is more, other reports revealed that some IJV stenosis are unable or not needed to be corrected by stenting [ ].
In an attempt to provide a better understanding of IJV stenosis and CVS stenosis, and made proper treatment accordingly, this study aimed to analyze the similarities and differences between IJV stenosis and CVS stenosis from two aspects, clinical and imaging features, in patients with non-thrombotic IJV stenosis or CVS stenosis.
Methods
Patient selection
Patients with non-thrombotic IJV stenosis or CVS stenosis, confirmed by contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance venography, were enrolled in this study from October 2017 through July 2018. Their clinical and imaging data, obtained from our inpatient database, were collected and analyzed by two neurologists and two experienced radiologists, respectively.
The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) non-thrombotic IJV stenosis or CVS stenosis confirmed by contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance venography. (2) No gender or age limitation. (3) The first-time confirmed diagnosis of IJV stenosis or CVS stenosis was in our institution.
The exclusion criteria involved: (1) Anti-IH drug use; (2) Drug-mediated IH; (3) Cerebrospinal fluid shunt history; (4) Bariatric surgery history; (5) Intracranial mass occupation; (6) Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis or internal jugular thrombosis; (7) The clinical data was incomplete.
Clinical evaluations
All patients’ neurological deficits and clinical outcomes were evaluated by the National Institute of Health stroke scale (NIHSS) and the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores. The intensity of headache was evaluated by the numerical rating scale (NRS), [ ] and the impacts of headache on daily life were assessed by HIT-6 [ ]. The severity of papilledema was evaluated by the Frisen papilledema grade criteria [ ]. ICP was detected by lumbar puncture, IH was identified as lumbar puncture opening pressure ≥ 200 mm water column [ ].
Neuroimaging evaluation
Images obtained from 3.0T of magnetic resonance were analyzed, including the sequences of axial T1WI, T2WI, DWI, FLAIR, ADC and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance venography. Images of 3D-computer tomography of brain and neck was used to evaluate osseous oppression associated IJV stenosis.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analysis was performed with the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 21.0 program. In which, categorical variables were expressed as counts and percentages, and tested by Fisher exact test. Continuous variables were described as mean ± SD and calculated by t-test, or recorded as median (interquartile range) and tested by the Mann–Whitney U test, if the variables didn’t fit the normal distribution and a value of p < 0.05 was considered as statistical significance.
Approvals and consents
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University. All participants signed the consent form prior to entering in this study.
Results
A total of 82 eligible patients were enrolled in this study, including 52 females and 30 males, aged from 23 to 81 years, the mean age was 53.27 ± 15.44 years. Patients were classified into IJV stenosis and CVS stenosis subsets, according to the location of the stenosis.
Demographic data were displayed in Table 1 . In IJV stenosis dataset, the number of male patients was almost equal to the females (52.50% vs. 47.50%), while, in CVS stenosis, females accounted for the majority (females vs. males = 73.81% vs. 26.19%). However, no statistical difference in ages was found in the two subsets (IJV stenosis vs. CVS stenosis = 56.03 ± 14.86 vs. 50.64 ± 15.69 years). The median course of IJV stenosis was 5 (3.00, 10.00) years and of CVS stenosis was 3.5 (1.00, 12.25) years. The predominant clinical features of IJV stenosis and CVS stenosis included: headache (55.00% and 57.14%), visual disorders (32.50% and 57.14%), sleeping disturbances (55.00% and 42.50%), hearing loss (50.00% and 30.95%), tinnitus (52.50% and 45.24%), head noises (37.50% and 45.24%), neck discomfort (12.50% and 19.05%), papilledema (25.00% and 63.41%), and poor Frisen papilledema grade scores [1.00 (1.00, 2.00) and 3.00 (1.00, 3.25)], respectively. In which, visual disorders, the high rates of papilledema and the poor Frisen papilledema grade scores were more common in CVS stenosis. Among 46 out of 82 patients complained that headache influenced their daily life, both the average NRS scores and HIT-6 scores were higher in CVS stenosis than IJV stenosis, but did not reach statistical significance (all p > 0.05) ( Fig. 1 ) . Hierarchical analysis displayed that no statistic difference between IJV stenosis and CVS stenosis, regarding the ratios of mild (NRS = 1–3) headache (45.45% vs. 37.50%) and moderate (NRS = 4–6) headache (50.00% vs. 33.33%), while the ratio of severe (NRS = 7–10) headache in CVS stenosis was much higher than that in IJV stenosis (IJV stenosis vs. CVS stenosis was 4.55% vs. 29.17%, p = 0.049). In addition, the ratio of IH was higher in CVS stenosis than that in IJV stenosis ( Fig. 1 ) .

Neurological deficits and laboratory data were displayed in Table 2 . The NIHSS and mRS between IJV stenosis and CVS stenosis subsets showed no statistical differences at either admission or discharge (all p > 0.05), while the average ICP in CVS stenosis was much higher than that in IJV stenosis ( Fig. 1 ) .

In terms of imaging findings ( Table 3 ) , the most vulnerable segment in IJV stenosis was J3 (33/40), followed by J2 (10/40) and J1 (4/40). The ratios in unilateral IJV stenosis (20/40) and bilateral IJV stenosis (20/40) were both accounted for 50%. In CVS stenosis dataset, unilateral transverse sinus stenosis (29/42) accounted for 69.05%, followed by bilateral transverse sinus stenosis (21.43%, 9/42) and transverse sinus-sigmoid sinus boundary stenosis (11.90%, 5/42), sinus interior giant arachnoid granules induced CVS stenosis accounted for 9.52% (4/42). The similarity of IJV stenosis and CVS stenosis in neuroimaging feature was the cloud-like white matter hyper-intensity around bilateral pre-ventricular area symmetrically on T2WI and FLAIR sequences of MRI; while the difference was that the abnormal collateral-vessels were in almost all IJV stenosis instead of CVS stenosis, especially the compensation of vertebral venous plexus, which was rarely presented in CVS stenosis ( Figs. 1 , 2 ) .

Discussion
IJV and CVS stenosis are imperative components of the cerebral venous outflow tract, although IJV is a continuation of CVS, the clinical and imaging features of IJV stenosis and CVS stenosis are different in both. In order to improve the understanding of IJV stenosis and CVS stenosis, so as to make customized management, we analyzed the data of the two subsets of the 82 eligible patients came from a single-center. To our best knowledge, this study is the first time to compare the similarities and differences between IJV stenosis and CVS stenosis.
The similarities of CVS stenosis and IJV stenosis
Long history of illness and high rates of misdiagnosis
All patients with either IJV stenosis or CVS stenosis had a long-term illness history prior to confirming the diagnosis of CVS stenosis or IJV stenosis, ranging from months to decades. Almost all patients were misdiagnosed and missed diagnosis at their first-time clinic visiting, which resulted in treatment delay. The reason may be as follows: On the one hand, both IJV stenosis and CVS stenosis are lack of specific manifestations and local signs; on the other hand, the insufficient understanding of the doctors to IJV stenosis and CVS stenosis. Such as, some CVS stenosis and IJV stenosis were misdiagnosed as idiopathic intracranial hypertension, the majority of IJV stenosis were misdiagnosed as anxiety, neurosis, Meniere’s disease, etc.[ , , ] Giant arachnoid granules mediated CVS stenosis was misdiagnosed as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis [ ]. In this study, giant arachnoid granules induced CVS stenosis was found in four patients, which displayed as a spherical occupation in the stenosis segment of the sinus in MRV image.
Headache, head noises, tinnitus, visual disorders, sleep disturbances, hearing loss, neck discomfort, papilledema, and IH
Headache, head noises, tinnitus, visual disorders, hearing loss, sleep disturbances, and neck discomfort are the common clinical manifestations of either CVS stenosis or IJV stenosis. In which continuous head noises and tinnitus are the features of both CVS stenosis and IJV stenosis. Tinnitus and head noises, usually accompanied by hearing loss and sleep disturbances, are hints for changes in blood flow at CVS stenosis or IJV stenosis,[ ] which can be effectively corrected by stenting [ , ].
Both IJV stenosis and CVS stenosis can result in long-term IH, which may be a serious issue when led to permanent visual damage, and may not be cured even after the IH relieved, resulting in adverse clinical outcomes. Our clinical practices revealed that IH induced by IJV stenosis or CVS stenosis can be safely and effectively corrected by stenting instead of traditional medication and cerebrospinal fluid shunt [ , ]. Moreover, timely diagnosis and proper treatment are very crucial to avoid permanent visual damage and disability [ ].
Bilateral cloud-like white matter hyperintensity on MRI
For both IJV stenosis and CVS stenosis, the features of images were cloud-like white matter hyper-intensity around bilateral pre-ventricular area symmetrically on T2WI and FLAIR sequences of MRI. Which differed from the asymmetrical point-piece white matter hyperintensity mediated by cerebral arterial disorders on MRI.
Although previous reports suggested that aging might lead to white matter damage, [ , ] in this study, the majority of patients with cloud-like white matter hyperintensity were youth and middle-aged individuals. Moreover, the ages of patients in IJV stenosis were well matched with those in CVS stenosis. However, the underlying mechanisms of the cloud-like white matter hyperintensity are still unclear; we suppose that the disruption of blood–brain barrier integrity mediated by IJV stenosis or CVS stenosis may contribute to this white matter image.
The difference of CVS stenosis and IJV stenosis
Severe headache, visual disorders, papilledema, and IH are more common in CVS stenosis
In our study, severe headache (NRS score = 7–10), visual disorders, papilledema resulted from IH, are more common in CVS stenosis than IJV stenosis. Endovascular stenting can attenuate these issues [ ].
Besides the different location of stenosis, the remarkable difference of IJV stenosis and CVS stenosis was the abnormal collaterals, especially the vertebral venous plexus. In this study, almost all IJV stenosis patients had the abnormal collaterals (100%), while only a few (28.5%) CVS stenosis cases had collaterals.
All mentioned above can explain why the ratios of severe IH and visual damage in CVS stenosis are more common than those in IJV stenosis [ ]. Therefore, patients, when confirmed as CVS stenosis, especially with severe IH, should immediately undergo CVS stenosis stenting, if not, timely optic nerve sheath decompression should be considered to avoid irreversible visual damage. That is concordant with the previous study reported by Ahmed et al. that stenting was beneficial for CVS stenosis with severe IH [ ].
The majority of IJV stenosis dataset had mild IH or even normal ICP (severe IH only accounts for minority). While, classical manifestations, such as headache, head noises, tinnitus, visual disorders, sleep disturbances, and neck discomfort, can also be found in IJV stenosis. Whereby, the manifestations of IJV stenosis mentioned above cannot be only explained as resulting from IH. We hypothesize that all clinical manifestations may due to long-term venous outflow obstruction induced deoxyhemoglobin stagnated in capillaries, which affects oxygen exchange in the brain. In addition, IJV stenosis patients with mild IH or normal ICP also need underwent timely treatment, as the symptoms of IJV stenosis affected the quality of daily life. Therefore, for IJV stenosis with normal ICP, symptomatic treatment such as oxygen intake may improve the hypoxic state and attenuate clinical symptoms [ ]. However, these hypotheses need further confirmation by clinical trials. For IJV stenosis caused by osseous oppression, orthopedic surgery may be an effective way to relieve the external oppression induced IJV stenosis [ , ].
There are also some limitations in our study: Firstly, this is a single-center retrospective study. Secondly, the number of subjects enrolled in this study is small, which may result in the selection bias. Further studies with multi-centers and large number clinical trials are still needed, and some of them are ongoing.
Conclusions
Continuous head noises or tinnitus and cloud-like white matter hyperintensity on MRI are the features of both IJV stenosis and CVS stenosis. Intracranial hypertension related headache, papilledema, and visual damage were more common and severe in CVS stenosis, whereas, collaterals compensation was a prominent feature of IJV stenosis. So, patients should undergo intravenous stenting as soon as the CVS stenosis was confirmed. While, patients with IJV stenosis can be treated with time-selecting stenting after the symptomatic treatment failed.
