Introduction
Since the advancement of nuclear and radiation physics, human being is prone to exposure of ionizing radiation through useful medical procedures or by nuclear accidents. Human tissues contain around 80 % of water, and the major radiation damage is followed by the generation of highly reactive aqueous free radicals [ ], which can interact with important biomolecules (DNA, proteins or membranes) and induce cell dysfunction and death [ ]. Radioprotective agents are synthetic or natural molecules, basically free radical scavengers, antioxidants or immunomodulators that help in mitigating the radiation injuries [ ] and, ideally, should produce no cumulative or irreversible toxicity [ ]. Since 1950s, many classes of radioprotective agents were explored, which include thiol-containing molecules [ ], bis-benzimidazol [ ], nitroxides [ ], superoxide dismutase-metal complexes [ , ] and natural antioxidants of animal and herbal origin [ ]. However, herbal bioactives have been in focus for last 20 years due to relatively lower toxicity as compared to all other synthetic alternatives. Some of the recent reviews cite many researches in which herbal isolates and extracts are successfully studied for antioxidant and radioprotective activities [ , , ]. Trans-resveratrol (RVL) is one of the immensely studied polyphenols with numerous therapeutic potentials including anticancer [ , ], antioxidant and radioprotective effects [ , , ] but shows low systemic bioavailability (<1 %) owing to poor solubility and extensive metabolism [ ]. Moreover, due to low natural abundance of RVL, appropriate strategies are needed that could enhance the solubility, increase its bioavailability, lower the rate of metabolism and provide sustained and long systemic circulation that will cut down the dose as well as cost. In this respect, PEGylated solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) could be effectively utilized for the delivery of RVL, which has noticeable advantages of small size, enhanced and controlled release, long circulation, enhanced stability, ease of sterilization and scale-up [ , ].
SLNs can be prepared by various methods like high-pressure homogenization, microemulsion, solvent emulsification/evaporation and double emulsion and ultrasonication techniques each having its own advantages and disadvantages [ ]. However, increasing environmental and regulatory concerns emphasize the use of green technology with minimal use of organic solvent. Use of supercritical fluid (SCF) technology is one such attempt that is successfully been applied in the development of various nanocarriers [ , , ]. SCFs have liquid-like densities with gas-like transportability with variable solvent power depending upon pressure and temperature. In this research, we aimed to develop and characterize RVL-loaded long circulating SLN using rapid expansion of supercritical fluid (RESS) technology in which SCF was made to solubilize the mixture of drug and excipient at specific temperature/pressure (above critical point of 30.95 °C and 73.76 bar for CO 2 ) and expanded to precipitate the product [ ]. In vitro antioxidant and radioprotective assays were done on the developed SLN, and finally, in vivo pharmacokinetic study was performed to establish its long circulating effect.
Materials and Methods
Materials
Trans-resveratrol (RVL) was obtained from Tianjin Pharmacn Medical Technology (China). Gelucire® 50/02 and 50/13 pellets were generously gifted by Gattefosse (France). Tween 80 was purchased from Hi-Media (Mumbai, India). All other chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade and used without further purification.

Method
A total of eight formulations were prepared by varying two levels of operating temperature, drug–lipid ratio and lipid–surfactant ratio (Table 1 ). Gelucires are polyethylene glycol glycerides composed of monoglycerides, diglycerides and triglycerides and monoesters and diesters of polyethylene glycol (PEG). In the designation of gelucire names, for example, Gelucire® 50/02, 50 indicates melting point and 02 indicates its hydrophile–lipophile balance (HLB) value. So, Gelucire® 50/02 and Gelucire® 50/13 showed the property of lipid and surfactant, respectively.

Slurry of RVL, Gelucire®50/02 and Gelucire®50/13 in 5 mL of ethanol, was put in the stirring vessel (Fig. 1 ). The valves V2 and V1 were opened to activate the RESS system and inflow of CO 2 , respectively. Vessel temperature was set using system software. Stirring (at 100 rpm) was done at pressure of 350 bar until the drug–lipid mixture saturates the SCF indicated by a translucent cloudy mix visible through the glass window. V3 was opened slowly to exhaust ethanol, and system was allowed to regain the pressure. Finally, valve V4 (nozzle valve) was opened slowly to produce enough turbulence inside the collection bottle containing 200-mL aqueous solution Tween 80 to spray and mix the product. However, concentration of Tween 80 was optimized to only 1 % to prepare all the formulations as 0.5 % v / v caused particle agglomeration and 1.5 % v / v led to high lather formation. V4 was kept opened until pressure drops down to 300 bar and closed again to regain 350 bar. The process was repeated until cloudiness disappears from the glass window. The collected dispersion was bath sonicated for 15 min and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 45 min. Pellets were washed, frozen at −80 °C for 3 h and freeze-dried in Dry/Shell Freeze System (Labconco Corp., MI, USA) for 48 h using 5 % sucrose as cryoprotectant. The formulation with optimized percentage yield, particle size and entrapment efficiency was PEGylated as described in “PEGylation of Solid Lipid Nanoparticle” section.
PEGylation of Solid Lipid Nanoparticle
For PEGylation, the formulation was processed in the same way, but 30 mg (2.5 % w / w ) of Lipoid® N -(carbonyl-methoxypolyethylenglycol-2000)-1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphoethanolamine) was added along with drug–lipid mixture.
Characterization of Solid Lipid Nanoparticle
High Performance Liquid Chromatography of Trans-Resveratrol
High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of RVL was performed on a Shimadzu system composing of quaternary LC-10A VP pumps, a UV–visible detector, a SPD-10AVP column oven and a SCL 10AVP system controller consisting of 25 cm × 4.6 mm i.d., 5-μm particle reverse phase column (Supelco). The mobile phase consisted of a mixture of 0.5 % v / v acetic acid in water and methanol (50:50 v / v ). Total run time was optimized at 8 min, flow rate was kept at 1.5 mL/min and detection was performed at wavelength of 304 nm. Calibration curve (CC) for the determination of entrapment efficiency and drug release profiling was prepared by first adding 1 mL of water and 2 mL of ethyl acetate in 1 mL of different ethanolic RVL concentrations (0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1 μg/mL). Ethyl acetate layer was separated, dried and mixed with 1 mL of mobile phase, and 20 μL was directly injected into the HPLC system. For CC in rat plasma, a primary stock (PS) solution of RVL (1 mg/mL) was prepared in ethanol and adequate aliquot was spiked in 1 mL of blank plasma to obtain concentrations of 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1 μg/mL. Caffeine (0.1 μg/mL) was added as internal standard (IS). RVL was extracted by liquid–liquid extraction method. Briefly, 1 mL of ethanol was added in spiked plasma followed by addition of 2 mL of ethyl acetate. The mixture was vortexed for 2 min and centrifuged at 800 g for 10 min. Ethyl acetate layer was separated and dried, residue was mixed with 1 mL of mobile phase, and 20 μL was injected into the HPLC system.
Percentage Yield
The lyophilized SLNs were weighed, and percentage yield was calculated as follows: $$ \mathrm{Percentage}\ \mathrm{yield}\left(\%\right)=\mathrm{Weight}\ \mathrm{of}\ \mathrm{the}\ \mathrm{product}\ \mathrm{obtained}/\mathrm{total}\ \mathrm{weight}\ \mathrm{of}\ \mathrm{the}\ \mathrm{ingredients}\times 100 $$
Particle Size and Size Distribution
Particle sizes of SLNs were analyzed using Zetasizer (Nano ZS, Malvern Instruments, UK). Ten milligrams of dried SLN was dispersed in 5 mL distilled water, bath sonicated for 1 min and put into the disposable cuvette and analyzed [ ].
Entrapment Efficiency
Ten milligrams of lyophilized SLN was mixed with 1 mL of ethanol and heated at 40 °C to make a clear solution followed by centrifugation (10,000 rpm, 10 °C, 15 min) by which lipid separates while the drug remains in the solution. Supernatant was mixed with 1 mL of water and 2 mL of ethyl acetate and vortexed. Organic layer was separated and dried to recover RVL. Quantification was performed as per the method described in the “ High Performance Liquid Chromatography of Trans-Resveratrol ” section. Entrapment efficiency (%EE) was calculated as follows: $$ \%\mathrm{E}\mathrm{E}=\left[\mathrm{R}\mathrm{V}\mathrm{L}\ \mathrm{entrapped}/\mathrm{R}\mathrm{V}\mathrm{L}\ \mathrm{added}\right]\times 100 $$
Scanning Electron Microscopy
The surface morphology of the pure RVL and SLNs was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) after coating with 5 nm gold through Zeiss Gemini 5 1530 FEG scanning electron microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH, Germany).
Transmission Electron Microscopy
Transmission electron microscope (JEOL 2100F, Japan) was used to study the shape of SLNs. The instrument was set at 200 kV and 0.18-nm resolution. A drop of SLN dispersion in water was put on the holey film grid and observed after drying.
Differential Scanning Calorimetry
For differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis, 10 mg of lipid mixture, pure drug and physical admixture of each ingredient in the same ratio present in optimized formulation as well as the optimized formulation were separately sealed in a 40-μL aluminium crucible and put in the pan. Empty crucible was taken as reference. The instrument (PerkinElmer, USA) was set to raise the temperature from 20 to 350 °C at a constant rate of 5 °C/min to get the thermograms.
X-Ray Diffraction
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained for RVL, lipid mixture and the SLNs (samples containing equivalent amount of RVL were taken for free RVL and in the SLNs) by X-ray diffractometer (PANalytical X’pert Pro, The Netherlands) using monochromatic Ni-filtered Cu–K radiation. Patterns were obtained by using a step width of 0.04° with a diffraction angle (in 2θ) between 5° and 90°.
In Vitro Drug Release
The drug release from optimized PEGylated SLNs (F9) and pure RVL was carried out in 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4 using the dialysis bag method. Lyophilized SLNs and RVL (equivalent to 2 mg drug) were dispersed in 1 mL of distilled water and put in the dialysis bag (MWCO 12 kD, Sigma-Aldrich, USA), sealed and put in the beaker containing 10 mL release medium along with 10 mL ethanol to maintain sink conditions. Dissolution medium was maintained at 37 °C and a stirring speed of 100 rpm. One milliliter of sample was withdrawn at different time intervals (0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h), and the same volume of fresh dissolution medium was added. One milliliter of ethanol and 2 mL ethyl acetate were added to the sample and analyzed by the RP-HPLC. All the operations were carried out in triplicate protected from light.
In Vitro Antioxidant Assays
All the assays were performed on the samples taken out from the drug release study at different time intervals (0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72 h) for the exact simulation of formulation behaviour on antioxidant and radioprotective effects.
Inhibition of Lipid Oxidation (Total Antioxidant Activity)
The assay was performed using the ferric thiocyanate (FTC) method with slight modification [ ]. Of sample, 0.5 mL was dissolved in 0.5 mL absolute ethanol and added to a mixture of 1 mL 2.51 % linoleic acid in absolute ethanol, 2 mL 0.05 M sodium potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7) and 1 mL distilled water. The mixture was incubated at 40 °C in the dark for 1 h. To 0.2 mL of this solution, 19.4 mL of 75 % ethanol and 0.2 mL of 30 % ammonium thiocyanate were added. To the reaction mixture, 0.2 mL of 0.02 M ferrous chloride in 3.5 % hydrochloric acid is finally added, and the absorbance was measured precisely after 3 min against a reagent blank at 500 nm each 24 h, until absorbance of the control reached a maximum (120 h). The reaction mixture without sample was used as the control. The oxidation index (OI) and antioxidant activity (AA) were determined as follows: $$ \begin{array}{l}\mathrm{O}\mathrm{I}=\mathrm{Absorbance}\ \mathrm{at}\ t=120\kern0.5em \mathrm{h}/\mathrm{Absorbance}\ \mathrm{of}\ \mathrm{Control}\ \mathrm{at}\ t=0\hfill \\ {}\mathrm{AA}=100\hbox{-} \left[\mathrm{O}\mathrm{I}\ \mathrm{of}\ \mathrm{sample}/\mathrm{O}\mathrm{I}\ \mathrm{of}\ \mathrm{control}\times 100\right]\left(\mathrm{After}\ 120\hbox{-} \mathrm{h}\ \mathrm{incubation}\right)\hfill \end{array} $$
Superoxide Radical Scavenging Assay
Superoxide radical scavenging activity of RVL-SLN and RVL was carried out by the method described by Liu et al. with some modifications [ ]. Here, superoxide radicals were produced by phenazine methoxy sulphate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (PMS-NADH) system and assayed by reduction of nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT). Briefly, 2.6 mL of sodium pyrophosphate buffer (0.052 M, pH 8.3), 50 μL of sample, 100 μL PMS (186 μM), 300 μL NBT (300 μM) and 200 μL NADH (780 μM) were mixed and incubated for 90 s at 37 °C. To this, 1 mL of acetic acid and 4 mL of butanol were added and shaken. Absorbance was taken at 560 nm after 10 min against butanol as blank. Control experiment consisted of reaction mixture excluding sample. $$ \mathrm{Superoxide}\ \mathrm{radical}\ \mathrm{scavenging}\ \mathrm{activity}\left(\%\mathrm{S}\mathrm{O}\mathrm{R}\right)=\left[\left({A}_0\hbox{-} {A}_1\right)/{A}_0\right]\times 100 $$
where A 0 was the absorbance of the control and A 1 was the absorbance of samples.
2-Deoxy-d-Ribose Degradation Assay
Time-dependent inhibition of 2-deoxy- d -ribose degradation by the developed formulation was carried out using the method by Halliwell et al. [ ]. The reaction mixture consisting of 50 μL of sample, 650 μL phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.4), 50 μL FeCl 3 (100 μM), 50 μL EDTA (100 μM), 50 μL hydrogen peroxide (1 μM), 100 μL 2-deoxy- d -ribose (3.6 mM) and 50 μL ascorbic acid (100 μM) was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C; 1 mL of 10 % trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and 1 mL of 0.5 % thiobarbituric acid (TBA) were mixed and incubated for 30 min at 100 °C, and absorbance was measured at 532 nm. The complete reaction procedure except the addition of sample was considered as control. The percentage inhibition of 2-deoxy- d -ribose degradation (%IDD) was calculated as follows: $$ \%\mathrm{I}\mathrm{D}\mathrm{D}=\left[\mathrm{Absorbance}\ \mathrm{of}\ \mathrm{control}\hbox{--} \mathrm{Absorbance}\ \mathrm{of}\ \mathrm{sample}\right]/\mathrm{Absorbance}\ \mathrm{of}\ \mathrm{control}\times 100 $$
1,1-Diphenyl-2-Picryl-Hydrazyl Free Radical Scavenging Assay
1,1-Diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assay was performed following the method by Blois [ ]. Nine hundred fifty microliters of 100-μM ethanolic solution of DPPH was added to 50 μL of sample and kept in the dark for 30 min, and absorbance was taken at 517 nm. The control was prepared by adding 50 μL water in lieu of sample to DPPH reagent. The following equation was used to calculate percentage DPPH scavenging activity (%IDPPH) $$ \mathrm{IDPPH}\%=\left[\mathrm{Absorbance}\ \mathrm{of}\ \mathrm{control}\hbox{--} \mathrm{Absorbance}\ \mathrm{of}\ \mathrm{sample}\right]/\mathrm{Absorbance}\ \mathrm{of}\ \mathrm{control}\times 100 $$
In Vitro Radioprotective Action
Lipid Peroxidation Assay
Fifty microliters of the sample was mixed with 1 mL of 10 % w / v liver homogenate in a series of petri dishes and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Lipid peroxidation was initiated by irradiation (250 Gy) using Gamma chamber 5000 (BRIT, India), and petri dishes were again incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Phosphate buffer saline (pH 7.4) was added to make the volume to 6 mL. One milliliter of TCA (10 %) and 1 mL of TBA (0.67 %) were added, and the mixture was kept in boiling water bath until the pink colour stabilizes. Absorbance was measured at 535 nm. The whole procedure without addition of the sample served as a control. Percent inhibition of lipid peroxidation (ILPO) was assessed by using the following formula [ ]: $$ \%\mathrm{ILPO}=\left[\mathrm{Absorbance}\ \mathrm{of}\ \mathrm{control}\hbox{--} \mathrm{Absorbance}\ \mathrm{of}\ \mathrm{sample}\right]/\mathrm{Absorbance}\ \mathrm{of}\ \mathrm{control}\times 100 $$
Plasmid DNA relaxation assay
Radioprotective efficacy of the formulation against radiation-induced DNA damage was evaluated using agarose gel electrophoresis. Two microliters of pBR322 plasmid DNA (25 μg/mL) was mixed with 50-μL sample along with 2 μL sodium edetate (TE buffer, pH 8; 30 mM) and 2 μL KH 2 PO 4 buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4). The mixture was exposed to 60 Co-gamma radiation (250 Gy) in a Gamma Cell 5000 (BRIT, India) at a dose rate of 2.50 kGy/min and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Four microliters of loading dye (15 % bromophenol blue, 0.25 % xylene cyanol FF and 15 % sucrose) was mixed, and 20 μL was loaded onto 1 % w / v agarose gel fixed in an electrophoresis unit (Wealtec, Taiwan). A 45-V (24 A) current was supplied using an Elite 300 power supply (Wealtec, Taiwan). The agarose gel was stained with ethidium bromide (0.5 μg/mL deionized distilled water) for 30 min. The ethidium bromide-stained DNA bands were seen under ultraviolet light, and the densitometric analysis of image was performed using Alphamager EC gel documentation system (Cell Biosciences, CA, USA). The maintenance of supercoiled form of plasmid DNA (P-form) characterized protective ability of formulation, while DNA damage is represented by open circular form (D-form). Percent protected (%P) and percent damage (%D) were calculated using integrated density values (IDV) of bands as follows: $$ \begin{array}{l}\%\mathrm{P}=\mathrm{ID}{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{P}\hbox{-} \mathrm{form}}/\left(\mathrm{ID}{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{P}\hbox{-} \mathrm{form}} + \mathrm{ID}{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{D}\hbox{-} \mathrm{form}}\right)\times 100\hfill \\ {}\%\mathrm{D} = \mathrm{ID}{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{D}\hbox{-} \mathrm{form}}/\left(\mathrm{ID}{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{P}\hbox{-} \mathrm{form}} + \mathrm{ID}{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{D}\hbox{-} \mathrm{form}}\right)\times 100\hfill \end{array} $$
In Vivo Pharmacokinetic Studies
In vivo pharmacokinetic study was performed after proper authorization from Institutional Animal Ethics Committee, Jamia Hamdard, New Delhi, and strict guidelines of Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision of Experiments on Animals (CPCSEA, Ministry of Culture, and Government of India) were followed. The animals were kept under standard laboratory conditions at 25 ± 2 °C temperature and 55 ± 5 % relative humidity and housed in polypropylene cages with free access to standard laboratory diet (Lipton feed, Mumbai, India) and water ad libitum. Eighteen male Wistar rats (weighing 200–250 g; n = 6) divided randomly into three groups with three rats each were used in the study. Firstly, RVL solution (RVL s , 10 mg/mL) was prepared in 0.2-M hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin solution in water for injection by probe sonication. A single dose equivalent to 200 mg/kg body weight of RVL s , non-PEGylated SLN (formulation F7) and PEGylated SLN (formulation F9) dispersion in water for injection were slowly administered intravenously to groups I, II and III, respectively. Of blood, 0.25 mL was withdrawn from the tail vein under light anaesthesia at specified time intervals (pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 18, 24, 48 and 72 h), heparinized and separated immediately by centrifugation (3000 rpm for 15 min) to obtain plasma (and stored at −40 °C). Extraction of RVL was carried out as explained in the “High-Performance Liquid Chromatography Analysis of Trans-Resveratrol in Aqueous Sample and Rat Plasma” section.
Accelerated Stability Studies and Shelf Life Determination
ICH Q1A (R2) guideline was applied to determine the stability of the RVL-loaded optimized SLN (F9) and was compared with RVL. Since the developed formulation was intended to be stored at refrigerated conditions, accelerated stability study was performed at 25 °C ± 2 °C/60 % RH ± 5 % RH for 6 months [ ]. Formulation F9 (lyophilized) and RVL powder were kept in the amber-coloured vial and stored in the stability chamber ( n = 3). At sampling time of 0, 3 and 6 months, RVL content was analyzed by HPLC. Slope of log % RVL remaining vs time curve was used to calculate the degradation rate constant ( K ) as per the following equation: $$ \mathrm{Slope}=-K/2.303 $$
Other characteristics like particle size, size distribution and redispersibility were also checked at same time intervals.
For the shelf life determination, samples were kept at three different temperatures (20, 30 and 40 °C) and Arrhenius plot (log K vs 1/T) was prepared. From the equation of the curve, values of K at 25 and 8 °C (K 8 and K 25 ) were calculated and shelf life was predicted both at room temperature (25 °C) and refrigerated temperature (8 °C).

Percentage Yield, Particle Size, Polydispersity Index and Entrapment Efficiency
The percentage yield, particle size, polydispersity index (PDI) and entrapment efficiency of all the formulations are shown in Table 1 . Minimum and maximum yield was respectively found in case of formulation F1 (36.87 ± 5.45 %) and F8 (68.49 ± 4.86 %). Particle size varied from 261.5 ± 4.18 nm (F7) to 892.5 ± 12.33 nm (F2). F7 was found to be of minimum particle size and having most uniform size distribution (PDI = 0.18 ± 0.029). In all the cases, lyophilization increased the particle size of SLN by an average of around 10–15 %. There was an increase of 33.7 ± 6.78 nm in the particle size of F7 after lyophilization. Maximum %EE was also observed in case of F7 (65.24 ± 2.67 %). On the basis of these data, F7 was selected as optimized formulation and was subsequently PEGylated. PEGylated SLN (F9) showed percentage yield (%), particle size (nm), PDI and entrapment efficiency of 68.48 ± 5.73 %, 276.7 ± 5.33 nm, 0.18 ± 0.032 and 62.66 ± 4.52 %, respectively. F9 was selected as final formulation and characterized further.
Scanning Electron Microscopy and Transmission Electron Microscopy
SEM microphotographs of pure RVL and PEGylated formulation (F9) before and after hydration are presented in Fig. 3a–c , respectively, which revealed that pure RVL particles were highly crystalline and around 10–500 μm in size. The SEM of sprayed particles collected from just above the aqueous surface revealed that there were no RVL crystals present and large particles (50–500 μm) with smooth surface were present. However, after the hydration with surfactant, sonication and lyophilisation, the particles obtained were nearly spherical in shape with particle size in corroboration with zeta size analysis. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the formulation (Fig. 3d ) showed nearly similar particle size as that obtained by particle size analysis. In addition, it also revealed a possible PEG layer around the particles (Fig. 3d (inset)).

Differential Scanning Calorimetry and X-Ray Diffraction
DSC thermograms of lipid–surfactant (Gelucire®50/02 and Gelucire®50/13) mix, pure RVL, RVL–lipid–surfactant mix and formulation F9 are given in Fig. 4a–d , respectively. Distinct peaks were observed for lipids and drugs in admixtures, but in case of F9, RVL peak was found to be significantly diminished (Fig. 4d ). XRD patterns of RVL (Fig. 5 (A)) showed sharp peaks between 2θ of 5° and 50°, while low-intensity peaks were observed for lipid admixture (Fig. 5 (C)). However, for formulation F9, diminished and low-intensity RVL peaks were observed (Fig. 5 (B)).

In Vitro Drug Release
Formulation F9 and pure RVL suspension showed maximum drug release of 70.05 ± 3.003 and 34.44 ± 1.696 %, respectively, after 72 h. A burst effect was observed in case of F9 where 31.004 ± 0.659 % of the drug was released in 2 h and later on the drug released in a sustained manner (Fig. 6 ). Fig. 6 In vitro drug release profiles of RVL suspension and optimized formulation F9
In Vitro Antioxidant Assays
Inhibition of Lipid Oxidation (Total Antioxidant Activity)
OI of control was plotted against time, which gives maximum value at 120 h of incubation (Fig. 7a (inset)), so 120 h was selected as incubation time of all the samples. Total AA of both crude drug and F9 increased with drug release time. More than 50 % activity was observed within 2 h for F9, which was achieved only after 24 h for the crude drug. After 72 h, F9 showed a significantly higher (69.12 ± 2.461 %) activity with respect to RVL (52.59 ± 0.775 %) (Fig. 7a ).

Superoxide Radical Scavenging Assay
F9 was found to be substantial superoxide radical scavenger as compared to free RVL. Around 60 % of superoxide radicals were scavenged within 2 h, and 88.32 ± 0.731 % scavenging was achieved in 72 h. RVL showed a maximum of 50.03 ± 2.023 % scavenging effect in 72 h (Fig. 7b ).
2-Deoxy-d-Ribose Degradation Assay
Inhibition of deoxyribose degradation was increased with increase in released drug concentration for both free RVL and SLN. Significant enhancement in activity was seen with of F9 as compared to RVL. Fifty percent inhibition was attained in little less than 4 h in case of F9, while for free RVL, it took around 48 h to achieve the same. A maximum of 84.77 ± 2.382 and 58.62 ± 3.226 % inhibition was observed in 72 h for F9 and free drug, respectively (Fig. 7c ).
1,1-Diphenyl-2-Picryl-Hydrazyl Free Radical Scavenging Assay
A corroborative increase in DPPH radical scavenging was observed with increase in cumulative drug release. F9 showed more than 55 % effect in 2 h and more than 75 % effect in 12 h. Higher than 75 % activity was sustained from 12 to 72 h with maximum up to 86.88 ± 1.229 %. RVL showed poor efficacy as compared to F9 with maximum scavenging of 52.72 ± 2.363 % with 72-h release sample (Fig. 7d ).
In Vitro Radioprotective Action
Lipid Peroxidation Assay
Inhibition of radiation-induced lipid peroxidation was more pronounced in case of F9 throughout the study period. Nearly 50 % inhibition was attained with 2-h drug release sample (at 31.00 ± 0.659 μg/mL), and maximum inhibition up to 73.43 ± 1.395 % was achieved with 72-h sample in a sustained manner. Free RVL could only inhibit the LPO up to 52.36 ± 2.230 % maximally with 72-h sample in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 8a ).

Plasmid DNA Relaxation Assay
Electrophoretograms of radiation-induced damaged plasmid DNA (p-DNA) treated by drug release samples taken out at stipulated time intervals are presented in Fig. 8b . Non-irradiated (control) group showed more than 90 % of undamaged or protected (P-type) p-DNA, while there was more than 80 % damage (D-type) in 0.5-h release sample-treated p-DNA. Percentage of P-type (%P) was significantly increased with increase in concentration of drug samples. However, F9 treatment has significantly higher protective ability than free RVL as F9 directed 50 % protection in nearly 2 h for which free RVL took more than 12 h. Maximum protection after 72 h was 69.25 ± 2.811 and 80.34 ± 3.712 % for free RVL and F9, respectively.
In Vivo Pharmacokinetic Studies
Pharmacokinetic parameters of different formulations after single slow intravenous dose (200 mg/kg body weight) were determined using plasma concentration–time curve (Fig. 9 ). Time ( T max ) to reach maximum plasma concentration ( C max ) was observed a t = 0 for RVL solution (RVLs), while it was 2 h for both F7 (non-PEG SLN) and F9 (PEG-SLN). C max was found to be 2.74 ± 0.068 mg/mL, 2.33 ± 0.062 mg/mL and 1.72 ± 0.042 mg/mL for RVLs, F7 and F9, while AUC 0-t was calculated to be 2.32 ± 0.063 mg h mL −1 , 15.95 ± 3.939 mg h mL −1 and 40.03 ± 1.837 mg h mL −1 , respectively.

Accelerated Stability Studies and Shelf Life
The changes in redispersibility, particle size and PDI observed at different time intervals (at 25 °C) are presented in Table 2 . The results showed non-significance that F9 at the end of 6 months had its original appearance and non-significant change in particle size and PDI. The study of drug degradation kinetics revealed straight-line plot between log % drug remaining and time, which implies that drug degradation followed first-order kinetics (Fig. 10 ). The degradation rate constant for RVL present in F9 and RVL powder was found to be 5.465 × 10 −4 and 1.799 × 10 −3 day −1 (at 25 °C). The shelf life both at refrigerated (8 °C) and room temperature (25 °C), i.e. the time required to degrade the drug by 10 %, was predicted by Arrhenius plot (log K vs 1/T) developed by calculating the K at three different temperatures (20, 30 and 40 °C). Predicted shelf life was found to be 2.09 and 0.83 years for F9 and 0.31 and 0.16 years for RVL powder at 8 and 25 °C, respectively.

Discussion
Gelucire® has pronounced advantage in the lipid-based drug delivery systems in comparison to other lipids, as they consist of mixture of monoglycerides, diglycerides and triglycerides with different chain lengths leading to more imperfections within the particles due to which higher encapsulation efficiency could be achieved [ ]. Various studies confirm the use of Gelucire® for SLN preparation and provided encouraging results in terms of getting improved physical stability as well as enhancing the bioavailability of poorly soluble drugs [ , ]. A controlled drug release system, which utilizes stearoyl polyoxylglycerides (Gelucire® 50/02) as a coating material, has been developed by using the SCF technology [ , ]. Moreover, Gelucire® 50/13 has been used in many works for its particle stabilizing effect on the solid lipid nanoparticles. In a recent study, Ramalingam and Ko developed resveratrol-loaded SLNs that comprised Precirol ATO 5, PA, Gelucire 50/13® and Tween 80 for improved oral delivery [ ]. Likewise, another study reports preparation of resveratrol SLN by ethanol injection method employing Compritol 888 ATO and Gelucire 50/13® for enhancement of bioavailability and hepatoprotection [ ]. In this study, we are using the combination of two Gelucire® lipids 50/02 and 50/13 with HLB values of 02 and 13 acting as lipid and surfactant, respectively, for the production of SLNs by rapid expansion of supercritical solution (RESS) technique. Application and feasibility of supercritical fluid (SCF) technology in the emerging field of nanomedicine are a mandate of the current researches and a stride towards sustainable development. Supercritical carbon dioxide (SCO 2 ) is a good replacement of the harmful organic solvents, which may be, otherwise, present while using conventional methods of development of nanocarriers [ ]. The method presented here uses ethanol in very low quantity (5 mL in 2.4 g of solid), and it is further reduced to almost negligible amount in the final product. This is a preliminary study design to evaluate the use of SCF in the production of SLNs in which we have studied the effect of two levels of three basic variables, i.e. temperature, RVL/(lipid + surfactant) ratio and lipid/surfactant ratio. Pressure was kept as much higher (∼350 bar) to saturate the SCO 2 with RVL–lipid–surfactant mixture, which eventually gets expanded to precipitate the SLNs. Our study observations showed that there was relative increase %yield and %EE while decrease in particle size of the formulations with increase in temperature, which might be an indicative of higher solubility of the mixture. Higher solubilization might have led to increased mass transfer (↑%yield), increased RVL solubilization in the lipid mix (↑%EE) and higher precipitation rate, leading to lower time of aggregation (↓z-avg) [ , ]. Moreover, at low temperature, PDI was higher, which means that some of the larger undissolved particle was also carried along with SCO 2 , which may also be responsible for higher average particle size and non-uniform particle distribution (PDI >0.3 for F1–F4). At low temperature, lowering of RVL/(lipid + surfactant) ratio has a non-significant effect on %yield, particle size or PDI but had a significant positive effect on %EE. The increase in %EE might be due to enhanced molecular dispersion of RVL in lipid matrix and lower rate of recrystallization. But, at higher temperature and higher RVL/(lipid + surfactant) ratio, apart from decrease in %EE, there was a decrease in %yield and increase in particle size also. Change in PDI had been non-significant. The possible reason might be the increased solubility of RVL in SCO 2 and excess might have remained un-entrapped and washed away during the washing process (↓%yield and ↓%EE). Moreover, increased RVL dispersion would have taken place in the lipid matrix at higher temperature, and during the precipitation step, the effect of surfactant in stabilizing the particle growth might have been diminished (↑z-avg). Decreased lipid/surfactant (Gelucire®50/02/Gelucire®50/13) ratio had significant negative impact on particle size but insignificant effect on %yield, PDI and %EE, which implies that increased level of surfactant would have helped in de-aggregation and stabilization of particles during sonication step (↓z-avg) [ ]. Lyophilization is one of the key factors determining lipid nanoparticle characteristics. Our study showed an increase of 33.7 ± 6.78 nm in the size of F7 after lyophilization step after using 5 % sucrose as a cryoprotectant. That might be due to crystallization of lipids at very low temperatures and Ostwald ripening. Increase in the size of glyceryl mono-oleate solid lipid nanoparticles due to lyophilization is well explained by Chauhan et al. [ ]. However, in our case, the increase in the nanoparticle size was relatively not very high. This may be due to the combined effect of cryoprotectant, development of well-formed structures during expansion of supercritical solvent and relatively stable Gelucire®50/02 and 50/13 combination. On the basis of %yield, Z-avg, PDI and %EE, F7 was PEGylated to get formulation F9, which showed very slight changes in characteristics and considered to be negligible. SEM of the RVL powder showed highly crystalline surfaces with particle size of 10–500 μm, while the dry sprayed particle collected just before its mixing into surfactant solution had large smooth particles ranging from 10 to 500 μm. This transition is due to change of crystallinity of RVL and its encapsulation into lipid matrix. However, when the particles were mixed into surfactant solution, sonicated and lyophilized, small nanometric spherical particles were obtained. TEM studies showed the clear outline of the particles with distinct PEG layer. The particle size analyzed by Zetasizer uses dynamic light scattering (DLS) technique that utilizes fluctuation of scattering intensities when particles are in Brownian motion and correlate to the particle size [ ]. As it is an indirect method, we confirmed and corroborated this result with manual measurement and counting of particles in the TEM observations, which revealed an insignificant difference between the two methods. Diminished peaks of RVL in both DSC thermograms and XRD patterns for RVL-loaded SLN evidenced the molecular entrapment of drug into the lipid system (Figs. 3d and 4b ). Drug release study showed increased dissolution of RVL through F9 as compared to pure drug because of reduced crystallinity and complete molecular dispersion of drug into the matrix. These results were in concordance with previous studies on SLN systems [ , ]. Release pattern showed an initial burst effect followed by sustained release throughout 72 h of study period. Burst effect might be due to direct dissolution of drug molecules from outer surface of the SLN, but later on, diffusion of the drug from the core would have led to sustained release [ ]. In vitro antioxidant effects of the formulation F9 and pure drug were observed at different time intervals of drug release and showed direct correlation with the concentration of drug in the sample analyzed. In all cases, F9 showed significantly enhanced activity with respect to pure drug beyond 1-h samples, which is the influence of higher dissolution rate of RVL through SLN. Minimization of radiation-induced lipid peroxidation and DNA damage was considerably higher with increase in dissolution of RVL as compared to pure drug. The results of these assays strongly suggested that antioxidant and radioprotective potentials of RVL were greatly enhanced when incorporated into SLN, which is primarily due to increased dissolution profile. Effect of PEGylation on the pharmacokinetics of RVL was clearly observed in case of F9 (PEG SLN) as compared to F7 (non-PEG SLN). The effect is indicative of capability of PEG SLN to escape reticuloendothelial system (RES). Elimination of RVL from F7 was relatively slower with respect to pure drug, which might be due to shielding of RVL when encapsulated into SLN [ ]. Encapsulation of RVL in SLN also improved the physical stability and reduced drug degradation as well as higher predicted shelf life. However, the developed SLN should preferably be stored in refrigerated condition (8 °C) to achieve a shelf life of more than 2 years.
Conclusion
In this study, RVL-encapsulated SLN was successfully prepared using SCF technology using Gelucire®50/02 and Gelucire®50/13. The technology employs rapid expansion of drug–lipid–supercritical CO 2 solution in aqueous surfactant medium. The optimized formulation on the basis of percentage yield (%), particle size (nm), PDI and entrapment efficiency (%) was obtained and PEGylated to give it stealth property. Antioxidant and radioprotective assays were performed and revealed significant increase as compared to pure drug. Pharmacokinetic profile proved the long circulation and enhanced residence time of RVL after i.v. bolus injection of PEGylated SLN in Wistar rat as compared to pure drug. Moreover, good stability and a shelf life of more than 2 years (at 8 °C) were predicted after accelerated stability profiling. These results are encouraging in providing protection against the hazards of ionizing radiation at relatively lower dose of RVL for longer period of time.
