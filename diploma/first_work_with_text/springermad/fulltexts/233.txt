Highlights
Anticoagulants are life-saving therapies. ICH is an infrequent complication of anticoagulation VKA-ICH is a high mortality rate despite availability of reversal therapy Although there are robust data on the success of PCCs to correct the INR, data for improved functional status and mortality are lacking for VKA-associated ICH Additional research is needed to assess outcomes associated with DOACs and the effect of DOAC reversal
Introduction
Anticoagulation therapy with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) has been the mainstay treatment for primary and secondary prevention of thromboembolism in patients with atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolic disease, and prosthetic heart valves. VKAs increase the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) by two to three-fold [ ], and although its absolute risk remains low, vitamin K antagonist–associated intracerebral hemorrhage (VKA–ICH) is often lethal with a 50–60% early mortality [ , ].
VKA-ICH is a medical emergency that requires rapid diagnosis and treatment. Both the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association [ ] and Neurocritical Care Society/Society of Critical Care Medicine [ ] guidelines strongly recommend urgent reversal of the international normalized ratio (INR) in patients with intracranial hemorrhage who are on VKA therapy with INR ≥ 1.4. The degree of INR elevation at the time of VKA–ICH correlates with initial hematoma size and mortality [ , ]. The intent is to rapidly restore hemostasis, and thereby limit hematoma expansion and further neurological decline. Nevertheless, the effect of rapid reversal on functional improvement and mortality is less clear. This issue is germane given that the lack of reversibility has been an often-cited barrier to use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs).
Given the approval of idarucizumab for dabigatran reversal and pending approval of andexanet alfa for reversal of factor Xa inhibitors [ ], a current appraisal of the evidence for reversal of VKAs on neurological outcome in ICH is needed as a bench mark for current practice. Our objective was to systematically review the literature on anticoagulation reversal in VKA–ICH to better ascertain its association with functional improvement and mortality and to assess the quality of existing evidence.
Methods
Search methods and study selection
We used PubMed to search for studies published up to March 4, 2018. Our search included a combination of MESH terms and key words to target intracranial hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage, warfarin, and VKA (Fig. 1 ). The bibliographies of the full reviewed articles and the Neurocritical Care Society/Society of Critical Care Medicine 2016 guideline [ ] were searched. To account for publication bias, we also searched ClinicalTrials.gov ( http://www.clinicaltrials.gov ) to identify completed but unpublished studies meeting our eligibility criteria.
Fig. 1 Flow diagram of search methods and study selection. A flow diagram illustration of our search strategy and study selection procession
Using pre-specified inclusion and exclusion criteria, two investigators assessed titles and abstracts for relevance to the topic. Full-text articles identified by either investigator as potentially relevant were retrieved for further review. Disagreements on inclusion, exclusion, or the major reason for exclusion were resolved by consensus or by a third investigator.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
We included all study designs from all countries that examined outcomes of VKA (warfarin, dicumarol, acenocoumarol, phenprocoumon) reversal in non-surgical patients with ICH (intraparenchymal or intraventricular hemorrhage). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies including case series with more than 5 patients were eligible for review. Our study populations were adults 18 years or older on VKA for any indication. We considered all warfarin reversal agents—prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), fresh frozen plasma (FFP), recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa), and vitamin K—in different doses and formulations. Studies that reported aggregated results for all types of intracranial bleeding were excluded.
Data collection
Data elements abstracted included study design, setting, period, sample size, intervention, outcomes, and exclusion criteria. When reported, we also noted the number of patients in each study who were deemed ineligible for reversal due to near-death or comfort care status. Information on patient characteristics at the time of presentation included age, sex, indication for warfarin, INR level, location and size of ICH, and neurological status. Time to presentation, time to therapy initiation, and time to successful INR reversal were collected when available. When reported, door-to-computed tomography (CT) and CT-to-therapy times were noted. Doses and route of administration of warfarin reversal agents were identified. The primary outcomes of our study were mortality and post-ICH functional level. The timing of the outcome measurements and the specific functional assessment scales used in the studies were noted.
All studies except case series were assessed for the following risk of bias elements: study type (observational vs. RCT), timing of outcome events (prospective vs. retrospective), selection bias, performance bias, confounding by indication, and outcome assessment bias (blinded vs. non-blinded to the outcome or exposure) [ , ].
Results
Our search strategy identified 3692 citations, and 21 studies met the selection criteria (Fig. 1 ). No RCT met our selection criteria. The list of three multicenter RCTs that are published [ , , ] as well as completed but unpublished and ongoing RCTs on VKA reversal is shown in Online Source Table 1. The three multicenter published RCTs were excluded because they either did not report outcomes separately for ICH [ , ] or excluded patients with ICH [ ]. Two completed and unpublished trials (NCT02281201, NCT00618098) did not report any results. Three trials (NCT02740335, NCT01961804, NCT03064035) are currently recruiting patients.
Our final selection [ , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ] included studies that specifically focused on ICH. Quantitative synthesis of the selected studies was not feasible due to the significant heterogeneity in the study populations, management of VKA–ICH, and overall lack of functional improvement as an endpoint. We highlight these aspects in subsequent sections.
Study characteristics
Study characteristics are summarized in Table 1 . Three studies were case series and 18 studies were retrospective cohort studies. There were no RCTs with available results. The study populations represented 13 countries and publication dates spanned from 1992 to 2017. Generally, the sample size of the individual study was small. Fourteen studies included fewer than 100 patients. Two of the largest and the most recent studies included 1176 patients from 19 centers in Germany, 661 of whom had information on reversal agents used [ ] and 1547 patients from 16 stroke registries in 9 countries [ ]. Fourteen were single center studies [ , , , , , , , , , , , , , ].

Patient selection and exclusion criteria
Eight studies excluded very ill patients who arrived in a coma or in whom the level of care was limited due to a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order (Table 1 ) [ , , , , , , , ]. Most, but not all, studies excluded traumatic ICH or any other secondary cause including structural abnormalities, brain tumor, and hemorrhagic transformation of an ischemic stroke [ , , , , , , , , , , , , ].
Two studies excluded patients who had a delayed presentation from onset of symptoms [ , ].
Baseline patient characteristics
The mean or median age of the study populations ranged from 63 to 87 years (Online Source Table 1). Women comprised more than 60% of the study populations in 15 studies. When reported, 35–86% of patients were taking warfarin for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. Most of the studies had initial mean or median INR level between 2 and 3 with 6 studies reporting mean INR ≥ 3 [ , , , , , ].
Eight studies excluded patients with either moribund status at presentation or a DNR order, ranging from 6 to 41% of the total ICH population [ , , , , , , , ]. After exclusion of such patients, most enrolled patients presented with mild to moderate neurological impairment as determined by Glasgow coma scale (GCS), NIH stroke scale (NIHSS), or reaction level scale (RLS)—85 (Online Source Table 1).
Interventions
Interventions for VKA–ICH differed among the studies. Eleven studies compared the use of PCC (with and without FFP and vitamin K) versus FFP (with and without vitamin K) [ , , , , , , , , , , ]. In the Kuramatsu study [ ], which included 661 patients for its subgroup analysis for reversal treatment, there were 11 patients in the FFP group compared to 650 patients in the PCC group, preventing any meaningful comparison. In 3 studies, a significant number of patients received either no treatment or vitamin K alone [ , , ].
Both 3-factor PCC and 4-factor PCC were administered using either a weight-based dose or a fixed dose protocol (Online Source Table 2). Four studies did not specify dose protocol or report mean or median dosage. Three studies included patients who received recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) [ , , ]. FFP volume given varied considerably within and among the studies.
Time process measures
Time from symptom onset to presentation was reported in 7 studies and varied widely [ , , , , , , ]. Four studies reported mean/median time of ≤ 4 h [ , , , ]. One study reported 95–100% of patients presented within 48 h [ ]. Ten studies reported time from symptom onset to initiation of INR reversal, which varied widely up to 16 h [ , , , , , , , , , ]. In the Kuramatsu study [ ], the largest study reporting this time parameter, the median time from symptom onset to therapy was 3.5–4 h. Data on reversal in this study was available for 56% of the cohort. Three studies reported door-to-CT or onset-to-CT time with a range up to 68 h [ , , , ]. Three studies reported CT-to-therapy time with a median time of 90 min–3.3 h [ , , ].
Time to INR reversal was investigated in many of the studies. Nearly all assessed time from the first INR measurement to the next scheduled INR measurement without consistency in the monitoring schedule. Also, different studies used different INR cut-offs as the definition of INR reversal. Time to INR reversal in all studies using PCC was shorter than for those using FFP [ , , , , , , ] (Online Source Table 2).
Primary outcomes
Mortality and morbidity were high among the VKA–ICH patients enrolled in these studies with or without warfarin reversal (Table 2 ). 3-month mortality, when reported, generally ranged 40–60% [ , , , , ]. The study by Kuramatsu (n = 1176 for mortality analysis) reported that 79% of patients had severe neurological deficits or died (mRS 4–6) at discharge. Neurological status at the time of presentation was the most common significant factor associated with clinical outcomes with or without reversal therapy [ , , , , , , , , ] (Online Source Table 3).

Among the modifiable factors that may affect clinical outcomes, the Kuramatsu study found that INR reversal to less than 1.3 within 4 h combined with systolic blood pressure less than 160 mmHg was associated with an absolute risk difference of 7.2% for in-hospital mortality [ ]. The effect of INR reversal agents on clinical outcomes was not consistent across the studies. Four studies reported that treatment with PCC did not improve mortality [ , , , ] or functional outcome [ , ] compared to FFP. The study by Huttner et al. reported that although PCC reduced the risk of hematoma enlargement, it did not improve the risk of poor outcome (mRS 4–6) at 1 year [ ]. Three studies reported improved survival with PCC [ , , ]. Early FFP administration led to quicker INR reversal but did not improve outcome [ ] and some patients experienced hematoma enlargement despite administration of FFP and after INR reversal [ ]. One study reported faster INR reversal in sicker patients [ ].
Risk of bias assessment
All studies were retrospective observational studies (Online Source Table 4). Potential source of significant selection bias included exclusion of patients with poor prognosis or DNR/palliative status. Performance bias was suspected in all studies because there was no standardized protocol for the use of reversal agents, scheduled serial INR measurements, or repeat imaging study. Confounding by indication, in which patients with a poorer prognosis were treated less aggressively, may also have biased the results. In many studies, it was unclear if functional outcome was assessed in a blinded manner.
Discussion
Our systematic review demonstrates that VKA–ICH has a high mortality rate despite available reversal therapy. A significant portion of patients with non-traumatic VKA–ICH die or are comatose upon arrival to the emergency department. Despite the availability of agents to reverse VKAs, there is no clear evidence to support improvement in functional outcomes associated with use of these agents. Most studies have significant limitations. First, the overall quality of the studies was suboptimal with 3 of 21 studies being case series and the remainder all retrospective observational in design. Second, with the exception of two studies [ , ] the overall sample size of each study was small preventing any meaningful comparisons across treatment subgroups. For example, the 7 studies that investigated the role of PCC on clinical outcomes compared a range of 10–60 patients in the PCC group to an often even smaller control group. Third, there was significant intra and inter-institution variation in the management of VKA–ICH. The choice of reversal agents varied from no treatment to a combination of PCC, FFP, and vitamin K. Since the management decision depends on each individual physician and the clinical characteristics of the patients, confounding by indication seriously limits interpretation of the data on effectiveness of different reversal agents as patients deemed to have the best prognosis may have been treated more aggressively. Sample size in general was too small to adjust for key confounding factors. The lack of uniform inclusion and exclusion criteria also influence study interpretation. Fourth, the dose and timing of the reversal agents used, timing of subsequent INR monitoring, and decision for repeat imaging varied considerably among the studies, further limiting our ability to synthesize the data. Finally, functional outcomes were ascertained using different scales and time points in a non-blinded manner in the few studies that reported on residual disability.
Being non-randomized and retrospective in design, the study by Kuramatsu et al. [ ] is vulnerable to selection and performance bias. The study findings of the benefits of time-intensive treatment, INR less than 1.3, and systolic blood pressure less than 160 mm Hg within 4 h may reflect unmeasured patient or system factors associated with treatment intensity and better outcome. In addition, these metrics were associated with changes in hematoma volume and not a predesignated change in modified Rankin score or functional disability. In our review, there was a significant delay from symptom onset to arrival in the emergency department among the studies that reported this parameter. This initial delay is the major barrier to timely urgent clinical intervention.
To date, three multicenter trials on VKA reversal comparing PCC to plasma have been published [ , , ]. None met our selection criteria as explained previously. Several aspects of these three trials limit translation of their results to the ICH population in clinical settings. The study by Sarode et al. excluded patients expected to die within 3 days and patients with GCS < 7 or ICH volume > 30 cm 3 [ ]. In addition, only 12% of the enrolled patients in the study had intracranial hemorrhage [ ]. The study by Goldstein et al. excluded ICH and only included patients requiring VKA reversal for urgent surgery or invasive procedure [ ]. The study by Steiner et al. enrolled 50 patients with either ICH or subdural hematoma and was not powered to detect difference in clinical outcomes [ ].
Reversal Effects of Idarucizumab on Active Dabigatran (RE-VERSE AD) trial was a single-arm, multicenter study to determine dabigatran reversal with idarucizumab, a neutralizing antibody, in patients with acute major hemorrhage (group A, n = 301) or were planned to undergo an urgent surgery or invasive procedure (group B, n = 202) [ ]. Among group A, 98 (32.6%) presented with intracranial hemorrhage, 53 (17.6%) of whom sustained ICH. The 30-day mortality for the intracranial hemorrhage group was 16.4%. Mortalilty for the ICH group was not reported separately. The Andexanet Alfa, a Novel Antidote to the Anticoagulation Effects of FXA Inhibitors (ANNEXA-4) trial was a single-arm, multicenter study to determine reversal of factor Xa inhibitors (apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, enoxaparin) with andexanet alfa, a factor Xa decoy, in patients with acute major hemorrhage [ ]. Unlike the RE-VERSE AD trial, ANNEXA-4 excluded patients with intracranial hemorrhage and Glasgow coma scale < 7 or ICH volume > 60 cm 3 and patients expected to die within 1 month. Of the total of 67 patients enrolled, 28 (41.7%) presented with intracranial hemorrhage, 14 (20.9%) of whom sustained ICH. The 30-day mortality for the intracranial hemorrhage group was 21.4%. Mortality for the ICH group was not reported separately. A recent retrospective study reported in-hospital mortality among patients with ICH enrolled in the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association Get With The Guidelines–Stroke registry [ ]. Of the 141,311 patients included, 10.6% were receiving warfarin and 3.5% DOACs. It is not specified if trauma-associated ICH was excluded. The unadjusted in-hospital mortality rates were 32.6 and 26.5%, respectively. The conclusion that DOAC-associated ICH is associated with improved outcomes is tempered by the lack of data on in-hospital treatment (comfort care, surgery, reversal), dose of DOAC and timing of last DOAC dose, missing discharge functional status on 43.7% of patients, and the confounding by treatment-bias associated with hospital transfer (35–38% of registry-enrolled patients).
Given the approval of idarucizumab for dabigatran reversal and pending approval of andexanet alfa for reversal of factor Xa inhibitors [ ], our systematic review provides a timely appraisal of the evidence and bench mark for anticoagulation reversal in VKA–ICH. Our results demonstrate that despite availability of warfarin reversal agents, mortality and morbidity remain high following ICH. Studies published to date are limited by confounding by indication, small sample sizes, and differences in inclusion criteria, dose, timing, and endpoint definitions. No results from RCTs are available to determine the efficacy and safety of the reversal agents in VKA–ICH. Steps to reduce ICH in this patient population include blood pressure control, avoidance of concomitant antiplatelet therapy, close monitoring of the INR, and use of DOACs for appropriate patients given their reduced risk of ICH compared to warfarin.
