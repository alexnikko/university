Introduction
Endometrial cancers are common cancers affecting women worldwide. The estimated incidence of uterine corpus cancer was found to be 6.4% in the USA and 2.3% in India [ ]. The accurate diagnosis of uterine tumors is possible only on histology, so every hysterectomy and endometrial biopsy specimen should be subjected to thorough histopathological examination. The sensitivity of endometrial biopsy for the detection of endometrial abnormalities has been reported to be as high as 96% [ ].
Numerous significant developments and changes have been taken place regarding the classification and terminology of tumors of uterine corpus. Presently, World Health Organization (WHO) 2014 classification [ ] which is based on the cell of origin and the anticipated tumor behavior is being followed. They have classified tumors of the uterine corpus into epithelial tumors, mesenchymal tumors, mixed epithelial and mesenchymal tumors, miscellaneous tumors, lymphoid–myeloid tumors and secondary tumors [ ].
Uterine corpus tumors are one of the most common reasons for morbidity and mortality of women around the world. There is an increasing trend in the incidence of uterine corpus tumors among Indian women, and histopathological diagnosis is the key for better management of the patients. Hence, this present work is an attempt to study the tumors of the uterine corpus based on its histopathology and to correlate them with the clinical parameters.
Materials and Methods
The present study of 433 uterine corpus tumors was conducted over a period of 5 years in the Department of Pathology of our institution. All unequivocally diagnosed cases of tumors of the uterine corpus, reported from the specimens of endometrial biopsy, endometrial curettage, myomectomy, polypectomy and all types of hysterectomy specimens, were included in the study. Abdominal hysterectomy/panhysterectomy specimens were received in cases of large mass and clinical suspicion of malignancy, whereas rest of the hysterectomy was vaginal hysterectomy. The specimens were fixed in 10% formalin, and after careful gross examination, tissue bits were given. The bits were processed, paraffin-embedded blocks were prepared, and 5-micron-thick sections were taken. The sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin stain, and microscopic examination was carried out.
Clinical data regarding the age, parity, menstrual history, presenting complaints and clinical diagnosis were obtained. The tumors were classified as per the WHO classification of uterine corpus tumors 2014 [ ]. Gestational trophoblastic diseases were excluded since they are now considered to be a separate entity. The data thus compiled were analyzed for various clinical parameters, histopathological features and incidence of different histologic types.
Results
The present study included 433 cases of histopathologically diagnosed uterine corpus tumors. They constituted 15.2% of total gynecologic cases and 4.6% of the total surgical pathology cases.
The tumors were classified according to the WHO 2014 classification [ ] (Table 1 ). There were 414 benign tumors, 16 primary malignant tumors, two borderline tumors and a single secondary tumor. It was found that the cell of origin was mostly mesenchymal ( N = 400, 92.4%) and most of them were leiomyoma. Epithelial tumors were less common ( N = 13), and all of them were malignant. Overall, leiomyoma ( N = 395, 91.2%) was the most common tumor in our study, whereas the most common malignant tumor was endometrial carcinoma ( N = 13, 3%).

Table 2 depicts the age and parity distribution of uterine tumors. Among benign tumors the peak was observed in the age-group of 31–40 years ( N = 169, 40.8%), whereas among malignant tumors the peak was observed a decade later, i.e., 41–50 years ( N = 6, 35.3%). The tumors in general showed a predilection for multiparous woman. Both cases of borderline tumor were seen in multiparous women belonging to the fifth decade of life.

Leiomyoma In the present study, there were 395 cases which showed leiomyoma. The youngest age affected was 24 years and the oldest was 82 years with the greatest frequency in the age-group of 31–50 years ( N = 304, 77%). Most of them were multiparous. The most common clinical feature was found to be heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) (35.9%) followed by pain in the abdomen (30.1%) (Table 3 ). Table 3 Various clinical features of leiomyoma Clinical features N (%) Lump in the abdomen 1 (0.2) HMB 156 (35.9) Pain in the abdomen 131 (30.1) PMB 2 (0.5) Heavy and prolonged menstrual bleeding 82 (18.8) Spotting 2 (0.5) Mass descending per vaginum 61 (14) Total 435 (100)
Leiomyomas showed a wide variation in their gross appearance. Five leiomyomas could not be appreciated grossly but were diagnosed on microscopy. The most common location was intramural ( N = 272, 68.9%), and majority were solitary ( N = 237, 60%) (Fig. 1 a). The size varied from microscopic ( N = 5, 0.6%) to greater than 9 cm ( N = 29, 3.8%). Majority of the leiomyomas were less than or equal to 3 cm in size ( N = 562, 72.3%). The largest leiomyoma noted was of size 20 cm.

The cut surface shows solid and cystic areas
Microscopically, 29.66% of leiomyomas showed secondary changes (Fig. 2 ); hyalinization ( N = 110, 27.8%) was the most common. Other secondary changes noted were calcification ( N = 8), cystic degeneration ( N = 5), myxoid degeneration ( N = 5), ossification ( N = 2), hyalinizing necrosis ( N = 1), hydropic change ( N = 1), osseous metaplasia ( N = 1) and red degeneration ( N = 1).

Histologic changes (Fig. 2 ) were seen in 4.55%; cellular leiomyoma ( N = 7, 1.8%) was the most common followed by epithelioid leiomyoma ( N = 4), apoplectic leiomyoma ( N = 2), atypical leiomyoma ( N = 2), lipoleiomyoma ( N = 1), mitotically active leiomyoma ( N = 1) and neurilemmoma-like leiomyoma ( N = 1).
Fifty-four leiomyomas (13.7%) showed an association with adenomyosis. Endometrial changes seen in association with uterine leiomyomas were also analyzed, and proliferative phase endometrium ( N = 197, 50.4%) was the most common (Table 4 ). Out of 395 cases of leiomyoma, the endometrial changes could not be evaluated in four cases because they were myomectomy specimens.

Adenomyomas ( N = 17) were encountered in 36–70-year-old women presenting with pain in the abdomen, HMB and mass descending per vaginum. They were 0.5–14.5 cm solitary, well-circumscribed intramural masses with whorled appearance. Microscopically, the lesion consisted of a circumscribed mass comprising of proliferating bland smooth muscle cells arranged in interlacing fascicles and bundles admixed with endometrial glands and stroma. Endometrial stromal nodule ( N = 1) was diagnosed in a 55-year-old multiparous woman with pain in the abdomen. It was a 2.5 cm intramural mass with yellow tan appearance, and microscopy revealed uniform small cells with round to oval nuclei and a scant amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm. At places, whorling of tumor cells around the arterioles was seen. A case of adenomatoid tumor ( N = 1) was seen in a 66-year-old multiparous woman with mass descending per vaginum. It was a solitary 2.5 cm intramural mass with gray white appearance. Microscopy showed a mass with formation of tubules lined by flattened mesothelial cells having round nuclei with small nucleoli and scant pale cytoplasm with intervening hypertrophied smooth muscle cells.
Endometrial carcinoma The 13 cases in the present study were either uniparous or multiparous women, belonging to the age-group of 40–70 years (Table 5 ). The youngest was 35 years old, and the oldest was 74 years old. Postmenopausal bleeding (PMB) ( N = 10) was the most common clinical feature. The specimens received were endometrial curettage, endometrial biopsy and panhysterectomy specimen. In panhysterectomy specimens, the tumor size ranged from 3.5 to 6 cm and the cut surface showed gray white appearance (Fig. 1 b). Based on microscopic findings, they were divided into endometrioid carcinoma (12 cases) and clear cell carcinoma (1 case) (Fig. 3 ). Out of the 12 endometrioid carcinomas, six showed typical features of endometrioid carcinoma, three showed villoglandular architecture, and the remaining three showed squamous. Endometrioid ( N = 12, 92.3%) was the most common type of endometrial adenocarcinoma. The three-step grading system [ , ] was applied in this study, and most of the endometrioid carcinomas were found to be grade I (75%).

Leiomyosarcoma There were two cases of leiomyosarcoma observed in 30-year-old and 42-year-old multiparous women. Both presented with HMB and a mass of 9 cm in largest dimension with cut surface showing a variegated fleshy appearance (Fig. 1 c). Microscopy (Fig. 4 a–c) in both the cases revealed interlacing fascicles and bundles of spindle-shaped cells having elongated blunt-ended nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm. In areas, increased cellularity, moderate-to-severe nuclear atypia with hyperchromasia, bizarre cells, tumor giant cells, increased mitotic activity (> 10/10 HPF) and extensive areas of coagulative tumor cell necrosis (CTCN) were seen. Fig. 4 Photomicrograph of leiomyosarcoma showing spindled cells with: a increased mitosis (H&E, ×400), b viable tumor cells with an abrupt transition to tumor cell necrosis (H&E, ×100) and c nuclear atypia, admixed with bizarre cells (H&E, ×400)
Adenosarcoma A single case was diagnosed in a 50-year-old multiparous woman with PMB. A 6 × 6 × 4 cm broad-based polypoidal, nodular mass was seen arising from the fundus, projecting and obliterating the endometrial canal. The cut surface showed multiple cysts varying from 1 to 15 mm in diameter with mucoid material, and the solid areas showed gray to yellow appearance (Fig. 1 d). The microscopic examination (Fig. 5 ) showed a combination of benign-appearing endometrial glands and a cellular stroma. Majority of the glands were lined by mucin-secreting endocervical-type epithelium and occasionally by squamous lining. Spindle-shaped stromal cells were arranged in sheets, short fascicles and whorls with areas of increased cellularity and at places forming periglandular cuffs or showing a phyllodes-like appearance. Mild-to-moderate nuclear atypia, occasional mitosis and giant cells were also seen. Sex cord-like elements in the form of small nests, anastomosing cords, trabeculae and tubules comprised 10% of the total tumor.

Secondary tumor A case of squamous cell carcinoma of cervix with spread to the endometrium and myometrium was seen in a 68-year-old woman who presented with mass descending per vaginum. A 3 × 3 × 1.5 cm irregular, infiltrative growth was seen in the endocervix, involving the isthmus and parametrium. Microscopically, the endometrium and myometrium showed involvement by a tumor composed of neoplastic squamous cells with increased mitotic activity.
Smooth muscle tumor of uncertain malignant potential (STUMP) Both the cases were seen in multiparous women belonging to the fifth decade of life, presenting with pain in the abdomen and PMB. The first case showed a 26 × 22 × 9 cm gray white mass with convoluted, whorled pattern, areas of necrosis and mucoid degeneration. The second case was a 2 cm intramural mass with areas of hemorrhage. Microscopically, both the cases showed oval- to spindle-shaped cells with elongated blunt-ended nuclei and a scant amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm arranged in interlacing fascicles and bundles. At places, CTCN was seen, but there was an absence of nuclear atypia and mitotic figures.
Discussion
The ancient Greeks regarded the uterus (hysteros) as the seat of the soul. Uterine tumors were known from ancient times. The uterine leiomyoma was known in the classical age of Greece [ ]. Hippocrates (460–375 B.C.) referred to such lesions as “uterine stones,” while Galen, in the second century of the Christian era, described the findings as “scleromas.” The term “fibroid” was introduced by Rokitansky (1860) and Klob (1863), while Virchow demonstrated that these tumors originated from the uterine smooth muscle. Thus, the term “myoma” came in clinical use [ ].
Leiomyoma The greatest frequency of leiomyoma was in the age range of 31–50 years ( N = 304, 77%) similar to the other studies [ , , , ]. Most women were multiparous (97.2%); only 2.8% were nulliparous analogous to other studies [ , , , ]. The commonest clinical manifestation was HMB (35.9%) in the present study followed by pain in the abdomen (30.1%). HMB may be due to the increased vascularity, increased endometrial surface and altered uterine contractility, whereas pain in the abdomen is possibly due to degenerative changes in leiomyomas [ ]. These findings were analogous with other studies [ , , , , ]. Mass descending per vaginum was 14% in the present study, which was also observed by Nayak et al. [ ]. As per the findings of a few studies [ , , ], HMB was the most common clinical manifestation followed by lump in the abdomen.
Leiomyomas were mostly intramural location 68.9% followed by subserosal 10.6% and submucosal 5.1% similar to other studies [ , ]. The number of leiomyomas in uterus varied from 1 to 18, of which 60% of patients had solitary leiomyomas in concordance with Gowri et al. [ ]. In a few studies [ , , , , ], majority of patients had multiple fibroids.
Variants of leiomyoma were seen in 4.5% which was analogous to the other studies [ , ]. Secondary degenerative changes were noted in 29.6% of the cases. Among them, hyalinization (27.8%) was the most commonly encountered secondary change similar to the other studies [ , , , ].
Few of the studies [ , , , , ] found that the most common associated lesion with leiomyoma was adenomyosis which was analogous with our findings. Coexistence of these lesions is due to unopposed estrogen and entrapment of glands within hypertrophied myometrium.
Endometrial stromal nodule It needs to be differentiated from low-grade endometrial sarcoma and cellular leiomyomas. In our case, the absence of infiltrating margins and vascular invasion helped to rule out low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma. Cellular leiomyomas grossly have an appearance that closely resembles with those of endometrial stromal nodule. But microscopically, cellular leiomyomas are composed of spindle-shaped cells with a fascicular growth and show cleft-like spaces [ ].
Leiomyosarcoma Most of the studies [ , , ] had the youngest patient in the second to third decades of life and the oldest in the seventh to ninth decades of life which correlated well with the present study. Most common clinical presentation in some studies [ , ] was PMB which was analogous with our findings.
The mitotic count was found to be ≥ 10/10 HPF by Loizzi et al. [ ] in 68% of the cases, 44.8% by Kim et al. [ ] and 74% by Larson et al. [ ]. Mitotic count ≥ 10/10 HPF was found in both the cases in our study.
The type of necrosis is a powerful predictor in leiomyosarcoma. CTCN shows an abrupt transition between necrotic cells and preserved cells, whereas hyalinizing necrosis shows a zone of eosinophilic collagen interposed between the dead and the preserved cells and hemorrhage. The presence of CTCN necessitates the exclusion of STUMP, which was possible because STUMP shows less than or equal to 10 mitotic figures/10 HPF and none-to-mild nuclear atypia [ ].
Smooth muscle tumor of uncertain malignant potential (STUMP) According to the work of Kempson et al., STUMP is diagnosed when [ ] CTCN is present, mitotic count is ≤ 10/10 HPF, and nuclear atypia is mild; CTCN is absent, mitotic count is > 10/10 HPF with focal moderate-to-severe atypia; or when CTCN is absent, mitotic count is ≤ 10/10 HPF with diffuse moderate-to-severe atypia. The differential diagnosis includes leiomyosarcoma. Though CTCN was present, the absence of atypia and mitotic figures helped in distinguishing STUMP from LMS in the present study.
Endometrial carcinoma The distribution of the different types of endometrial carcinoma, age, parity, gross and microscopic features in the studies done by Rathod et al. [ ] and Abd El-Wahed et al. [ ] was analogous to the present study.
Endometrial carcinoma is the most common invasive cancer of the female genital tract and accounts for 7% of all invasive cancer in women, excluding skin cancer [ , ]. The peak incidence is in 55–65-year-old women.
It is classified by Bokhman into two broad categories, referred to as type I and type II [ , ]. Type I carcinomas are the most common, accounting for greater than 80% of all cases. Majority is well differentiated and is referred to as endometrioid carcinoma. Type II carcinoma is poorly differentiated (grade 3) and occurs in women a decade later than type I carcinoma, and in contrast to type I carcinoma, they usually arise in the setting of endometrial atrophy [ ]. In the present study, majority of the endometrial carcinomas were type I ( N = 12, 92.3%) and only a single case was type II.
Adenomyoma The findings of the present study correlated well with the other studies [ , ]. Tahlan et al. [ ] found associated leiomyoma in 46.9% of the cases, and in the present study, it was seen in 6 cases (35.3%). Few of the cases showed cystic areas and one to two typical mitotic figures per 10 HPF in the endometrial stroma which was not seen in our study. A study by Gilks et al. [ ] showed minor foci of tubal-type epithelium (14 cases), mucinous endocervical-type epithelium (2 cases) and squamous epithelium (1 case).
Adenomyoma can also present as a polypoidal mass and may sometimes show atypia in the endometrial glands (atypical polypoid adenomyoma). Adenomyosis may simulate adenomyoma, and it is differentiated on the grounds that it does not form a well-circumscribed mass.
Adenosarcoma Rekhi et al. [ ] did a study on nineteen cases of adenosarcoma and the clinical, gross and microscopic features correlated well with our findings. In their study, the epithelium was endometrioid in most tumors followed by cuboidal with apical snouts and squamous, ciliated columnar and secretory type in a single tumor, each, respectively, whereas in the present study mucin-secreting endocervical-type epithelium was seen in many glands. Out of the nineteen cases in their study, one case had sex cord elements which were seen in our case also.
Adenomatoid tumor They are usually solitary intramural masses, often less than 4 cm with a nodular gray white and firm cut surface. They should be differentiated from lymphangioma and adenocarcinoma. The character of the cells lining the spaces and the absence of lymphocytes within the spaces eliminate the possibility of lymphangioma. The absence of atypia, mitotic figures and invasion eliminates the possibility of adenocarcinoma. The findings of other studies [ , , , ] were analogous to the present study.
Secondary tumors According to Agashe et al. [ ] and Marwah et al. [ ], the common patterns of the uterine corpus involvement by cervical cancer are through deep myometrial penetration and lymphatic dissemination. Superficial surface spread of in situ or invasive squamous cell carcinoma of cervix over the contiguous endometrial surface may occur in rare instances. Since in the present study endometrium and myometrium were involved, the mode of spread may have been both superficial and lymphatic spreads.
Metastatic carcinoma in the corpus should be suspected if there is an unusual histologic pattern for primary endometrial carcinoma; diffuse replacement of endometrial stroma with sparing of preexisting glands; lack of premalignant changes in endometrial glands; and disproportionate involvement of the serosa and outer myometrium [ ].
Conclusion
Benign tumors were more common than malignant tumors. Leiomyoma was the most common benign tumor, and endometrial carcinoma was the most common malignant tumor. Many uterine tumors present with similar clinical features. Hence, histopathology plays an important role in the accurate diagnosis of different types of tumors having different biological behaviors and thus helps in providing the patient with appropriate management.
