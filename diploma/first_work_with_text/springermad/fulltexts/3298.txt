Introduction
Celecoxib, 4-[5-(4-methylphenyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl] benzenesulfonamide, was chemically sulfonamides non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) ( ). CXB could have selectively influence on inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 activity, thereby blocked the prostaglandin biosynthesis that is responsible for antipyretic-analgesic and anti-inflammation ( ). At the same time, it had no inhibition in cyclooxygenase-1 expression that reduced gastrointestinal side effects ( ). Acute pain, osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis were treated by the first synthesis anti-inflammatory drug of CXB ( ). CXB had poor aqueous solubility and caused serious side effects ( ). Therefore, formulation of CXB was designed as microemulson-based gel to improve permeation of skin and reduce side effects of systemic administration.
At present, nanotechnology in different drug delivery systems was researched more and more to overcome the poor aqueous solubility and bioavailability, such as microemulsions ( ), nanoparticles ( ), nanosuspensions ( ), solid lipid nanoparticles ( ), et al . The formation mechanism of microemulsion had not been researched completely, Schulman considered that interfacial tension ( ) took control of the formation of microemulsion. In this research, the o/w balance was broken by adding surfactant and co-surfactant ( ). Microemulsion determined as thermodynamically stable ( ) and clear liquid solution with droplet size in range 10–100 nm do not combine. Microemulsifiying obtained application widely, because of simple preparation method, good drug stability, and good drug dispersibility have recently gained various approach of administration such as oral, injection, and transdermal ( ). Microemulsion has good biocompatibility with biomembrane that could improve permeation ( ) when drug pass though fat-soluble stratum corneum or aqueous channels. Transdermal administration based on microemulsion could reduce first-pass effect, side effect, and improved transdermal permeation ( ). The defects of microemulsion viscosity would be considered to influence the drug retention and confine the range of drug application. Against this defect, drug-loaded microemulsion was designed as gels ( ). Gelling agents could be selected from carbopol, chitosan ( ), hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) ( ), sodium alginate ( ), and carrageenan ( ). Carbopols ( ) was made by cross-linking with acrylic acid and allyl ethers of pentaerythritol to synthesize high molecular weight polymers. Carbopol 934 was used to form transparent, stable, and easy-storage network gels and suitable for transdermal administration system.
In this study, based on the results of solubility screening, the three factors including oil phases, surfactants, and co-surfactants were found out by adopting an L9 (34) orthogonal experimental design ( ). For each factor, three levels including visual inspection, globule size, and drug-loading rate were accepted as the standard of grading to optimize the microemulsion about the influence of mentioned factors and levels in experiment procedure. Pseudo-ternary phase diagrams were also built to obtain the optimization microemulsion ( ). The final formulation was evaluated for appearance, pH, viscosity, stability, drug content determination, globule size, and zeta potential. The further research was performed to ensure the safety and validity by skin irritation study and in vivo anti-inflammatory activity study ( ). Ex vivo permeation study in mice was designed to compare permeation and transdermal ability between microemulsion formulation and conventional gel ( ). Bioavailability was compared to market Celebrex® by in vivo pharmacokinetic study in rabbits.

Triethanol amine (TEA) was purchased from Shanghai Jinshan Pavilion New Chemical Reagent Factory. (Shanghai, China). Methyl alcohol was purchased from Shanghai Ludu Chemical Reagent Factory. (Shanghai, China). Unless otherwise stated, all other materials were of analytical grade.
Screening of Oils, Surfactants, and Co-surfactants for Microemulsion
To find out suitable surfactant, co-surfactant, and oil phase in microemulsions, the solubility of CXB in various oils was screened such as castor oil, isopropyl myristate, triacetin, ethyl oleate, and olive oil; surfactants like Labrasol, Tween 40, Tween 80, and Labrafil and co-surfactants including ethanol, propylene glycol, Transcutol-P, and PEG 400 were determined. There are three parallel test performed for solubility assay.
One milliliter of oils, surfactants, and co-surfactants were selected separately though adding an excess amount of CXB in 10 ml-capacity stopper vials and the mixture was shaken reciprocally by vortex mixer for 5 min. Then, the mixture was kept in shaker for 24 h at ambient temperature (37 ± 0.5°C) to reach equipoise. The mixtures were removed from the shaker to 5 ml-capacity stopper vials and filtered though a 0.45-μm membrane filter after centrifuged for 10 min at 3000 rmp. The filtrates were diluted to appropriate concentration with methanol and 20 μl of the resulting solution was analyzed with high performance liquid chromatography (LC-20A, Shimadzu, Japan) analysis using a Kromasil C 18 column (4.6 mm × 250 mm, 5 μm), methanol-distilled water in the ratio of 80:20 as mobile phase, at detection wavelength of 251 nm and flow rate of 1.0 ml min −1 ( ). The column temperature was 35°C. Method validation results indicated calibration cure of y = 58881 x + 4579.1 ( R 2 = 0.9965) were linear in the concentration range of 0.2–60 μg/ml. Average recovery at 80, 100, and 120 μg/ml ranged from 98.76 to 101.18%. The value of average precisions was all below 0.18%.
Orthogonal Experimental Design
In this research, orthogonal experimental design was applied. The orthogonal experimental design was an efficient, rapid, and economical method for studying the multiple factors and levels. Representative points which had the character of dispersed and uniform were selected from comprehensive experiment based on orthogonal design. A factor and level were found to have the most extent influence on the target product.
The more solubility of CXB in the oil phase, surfactant, and co-surfactant was selected. The mass ratio of the formulation is oil phase, surfactant, and co-surfactant equal to 1:5:4. Distilled water was added drop wise ( , ) until the mixture of oil/S mix became transparent and clear at a certain point by appropriate magnetic stirrer for orthogonal experimental. The L9 (3 4 ) method was chosen to design the orthogonal experiment in our studies.
Structure of Pseudo-Ternary Phase Diagrams
As shown in Fig. 1 , the concentration range of components was obtained by using water titration method to construct pseudo-ternary phase diagrams, which range the microemulsion existence. The weight ratio of surfactant to co-surfactant (Km) varied as 1:2, 1:1, 2:1, and 3:1 for each pseudo-ternary phase diagram. At each S mix ratio, the mixture containing surfactant, co-surfactant, and oil was prepared with the volume ratio of oil to the S mix at 9:1, 8:2, 7:3, 6:4, 5:5, 4:6, 3:7, 2:8, and 1:9, respectively ( ). Clear and transparent microemulsion was obtained though adding double distilled water drop wise in oily mixture with magnetic stirring. Fig. 1 Structure of pseudo-ternary phase diagrams
The pseudo-ternary phase diagrams was completed by calculating the concentration of components, and then, the contents of oil, surfactant, co-surfactant, and water at appropriate weight ratios were selected based on these results. The software OriginPro 8.6 was used to construct pseudo-ternary phase diagrams of CXB microemulsion and prepared microemulsion according to ternary phase diagram.
Experimental Design
Central Composite Design
Pseudo-ternary-phase diagrams were used to determine the ratio of surfactant and co-surfactant. However, the ratio of S mix , oil, and water that enables microemulsion formation must also be determined. Factorial design experiment indicated the ratio of S mix , oil, and water had significant influences on microemulsion-based gel. Central composite design (CCD) is the most common method for response surface design. As shown in Table I , the independent factors were optimized, and the main effects, interaction effects, and quadratic effects of response variable were evaluated by designing a 13-run, two-factor, five-level CCD. Two factors ( X 1 and X 2 ) were selected as independent variables using CCD. The cumulative penetration quantity in 24 h ( Q 24 , μg cm −2 ) and the permeation rate ( J ss , μg cm −2 h −1 ) were taken as response variable. Software Design-Expert® 8.0 was used to design and analyze 13 batches of four factorial points, four axial points, and five replicated center points prepared by the formulation in Table I .

Response Surface Methodology
The model was fitting as polynomial regression equations that described the influence of the independent variables on the response variables. $$ Y={\beta}_0+{\beta}_1{X}_1+{\beta}_2{X}_2+{\beta}_3{X}_1{X}_2+{\beta}_4{X_1}^2+{\beta}_5{X_2}^2 $$ where Y = response variable; β 0 = intercept representing the arithmetic average of all quantitative outcomes of 13 runs; β 1 – β 5 = coefficients computed from the observed experimental values of Y ; X 1 and X 2 = coded levels of independent variables; X 1 X 2 = factor interaction; X 1 2 and X 2 2 = quadratic term ( ).
Based on the obtained polynomial regression equations, the contour and response surface plots of independent variables and response variables were drawn by using Software Design-Expert® 8.0.
Physicochemical Characterization of Optimized Microemulsion
The three samples (A1, A2, A3) were prepared based on the optimized microemulsion for next validation.
Staining Test
Methylene blue (water soluble dye) was used to perform staining test.
Phase Separation
The physicochemical characterization of microemulsion was determined by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 15 min and phase separation was observed in visual ( ).
Globule Size and Zeta Potential Measurement
Compared to the coarse emulsion, the microemulsion obtained the small globule size because the interfacial tension was broken by the presence of co-surfactant. Malvern Zetasizer nano instruments (ZS-90, Worcestershire, UK) were used to measure the globule size and zeta potential. The polydispersity index (PDI) was determined by the same instruments. The measurement was performed at room temperature in triplicate ( ).
Transmittance Measurement
Transparency of prepared microemulsion was measured by UV-visible spectrophotometer (UV-1800 Shimadzu, Japan) at 251 nm. Purified water was considered as blank ( ).
Preparation and Characterization of Microemulsion-Based Gel
6.83 g triacetin, 21.86 g Tween 80, and 21.86 g Transcutol-P were mixed in the stirrer device until forming homogeneous system. The CXB (1.5 g) was added into the mixture and shaken reciprocally to dissolve by vortex mixer for 5 min. One percent carbopol 934 was added into water (49.45 g) and then swelled for 24 h to form gel and adjusted pH by using triethanol amine (TEA). Then, optimized microemulsion was gradually added into the 1% carbopol gel and stirred to form smooth, viscous, clear CXB microemulsion-based gel. The three samples (A1, A2, A3) were prepared based on the final formulation of microemulsion-based gel for next validation.
Appearance
The prepared formulation of CXB microemulsion-based gel was inspected for the homogeneous texture and color in visually.
Measurement of pH
The pH value was measured using a pH meter. CXB microemulsion-based gel was dissolved to prepare solutions.
Globule Size and Zeta Potential Measurement
Malvern Zetasizer nano instruments (ZS-90, Worcestershire, UK) were used to measure the globule size and zeta potential. The measurement was performed at room temperature.
Viscosity
The gel adhered to the skin is essential and the carbopol 934P was selected to improve viscosity for application on skin. Viscosity was determined at 37°C using Rotational NDJ-79 Viscometer (Precision Instrument, Shanghai, China) ( ).
Measurement of Stability
The 1 g of CXB microemulsion-based gel was added to 100 ml methanol. The solutions were centrifuged for 10 min at 3500 rmp. The supernatant layer was diluted from 5 to 50 ml in volumetric flask and added methanol to scale. At predetermined time intervals (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 h), aliquots of 2 ml solution were taken out and maintained sink conditions by replacing aliquots of 2 ml buffer solution at 37 ± 1°C during experimental procedure. The samples were filtered by a 0.45-μm membrane filter and quantified by high performance liquid chromatography analysis. The measurement of stability test revealed the change in content of solution in 12 h.
Drug Content Determination
The 1 g of CXB microemulsion-based gel was added to 100 ml methanol. The solutions were centrifuged for 10 min at 3500 rmp. The supernatant layer was diluted from 5 to 50 ml in volumetric flask and added methanol to scale. Content was measured at 251 nm by high performance liquid chromatography (LC-20A, Shimadzu, Japan) analysis as described in the section “screening of oils, surfactants, and co-surfactants for microemulsion.”
Ex Vivo Permeation Study
Abdominal skin of the freshly shaven mice were used as a diffusion membrane to carry out this permeation study. A cotton swab was used to rub the skin and remove the adipose tissue layer. The skin was stored into sterile saline solution overnight and then frozen in refrigerator. The excised rat skin was sandwiched between the donor and receptor compartments of Franz diffusion cell with the stratum corneum facing donor compartment. Donor compartment which was exposed to receptor compartment was 1.76625 cm 2 (Φ1.5 cm) in the effective permeation area, and volume of receptor compartment was 17 ml.
0.5 g optimized microemulsion-based gel and conventional gel were applied on the prepared skin and put it into receptor medium (30% ethanol and 10% PEG-400 saline solution were pre-chosen) and maintained at 37 ± 1°C and were stirred at 200 rmp; at predetermined time intervals (4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, and 34 h), aliquots of 2 ml solution were taken out and maintained diffusion conditions by replacing aliquots of 2 ml buffer solution at 37 ± 1°C. The samples were filtered by a 0.45-μm membrane filter and quantified at 251 nm by high performance liquid chromatography (LC-20A, shimadzu, Japan) in triplicates.
Cumulative amount of drug and a function of time ( t , h ) was plotted to draw curve. CXB released though transdermal permeation at predetermined time (the cumulative amount; Q i ) was calculated using following equation: $$ {Q}_i=\frac{C_iV+{\displaystyle \sum_1^{i-1}{C}_i{{}_{-}}_1\times {V}_i}}{A} $$
where A represents the effective sink area; V represents the volume of the receiver solution; V i represents the volume after each sampling time; C i represents the drug concentration at predetermined time ( i h ) in receptor medium.
Skin Irritation Study
The study of CXB microemulsion-based gel was performed on albino rabbits. The experiment was designed by separating the rabbits into two groups: group 1: blank gel (control); group 2: CXB microemusion-based gel. The 2 g of formulation were applied on the corresponding shaven skin (3 cm × 3 cm square) of rabbits three times a day. After an exposing duration 24 h, the text sites were wiped with water. The change of skin was observed in color and morphology for a period of 1, 24, 48, and 72 h after removal. The evaluation of erythema and edema formation was based on the standard of grading (Table II ). Table II The Standard of Grading in Skin Irritation Study Irritation to skin Score Erythema No erythema 0 Mild erythema (barely visible) 1 Moderate erythema (visible) 2 Morbid erythema 3 Purple erythema or mild eschar 4 Edema No edema 0 Mild edema (barely visible) 1 Moderate edema (obvious uplift) 2 Morbid edema (skin uplift 1 cm and edge sharpness) 3 Severe edema (skin uplift more than 1 cm and have expanded) 4
In Vivo Anti-inflammatory Activity
The study of CXB microemulsion-based gel was performed on albino male rats. Rats were separated into three groups: group 1: blank gel (control); group 2: CXB microemusion-based gel; group 3: marketed diclofenac sodium gel. The 0.5 g of formulation was applied on the properly left hind paw skin of rats three times a day. After 3 days, each rat was injected 0.1 ml 10% fresh egg white in the text sites. The paw volume was measured for a period of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 h using the following equation:
The degree of edema (mm) = perimeter of paw after inflame (mm) − perimeter of paw before inflame (mm) $$ {\scriptscriptstyle \raisebox{1ex}{$0$}\!\left/ \!\raisebox{-1ex}{$0$}\right.}\mathrm{inhibition}=\mathrm{V}\mathrm{c}-\frac{\mathrm{Vt}}{\mathrm{Vc}}\times 100\% $$
where Vc represents increasing of paw volume in control group and Vt represents increasing of paw volume in test group.
In Vivo Pharmacokinetic Study in Rabbits
The in vivo pharmacokinetic study of CXB microemulsion-based gel was implemented on the basis of the “Principles of Laboratory Animal Care” and was permitted by the Nanjing Medical University Institutional Animal. The study of CXB microemulsion-based gel was performed on albino rabbits. Rabbits were separated into two groups: group 1: CXB microemusion-based gel; group 2: marketed Celebrex®. The rabbits had fasted the previous day and the 2 g (150 mg/10 g) of gel and 30 mg of market capsule were applied on the corresponding shaven skin (10 cm × 10 cm square) of rabbits, respectively. The plasma (3.0 ml) was collected in sodium heparin tubes (anticoagulant) for a period of 0.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 24, 30, and 36 h after dosing. The samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 3500 rmp and the supernatant was stored in a freezer (−20°C) until assayed ( ).
Carbamazepine was added to methanol solution as an internal standard (2.0 μg/ml). The sample (1.0 ml) was added to 10 ml of plastic centrifuge tube mixed with 50 μl internal standard. Then, 3 ml of ethyl acetate was vortexed by vortex mixer for 5 min. The solutions were centrifuged for 10 min at 3500 rmp. The supernatant layer was transferred to a new 10 ml plastic centrifuge tube and evaporated to dryness in a vacuum evaporator. The residues were reconstituted in 100 μl methanol solution and the 20 μl was injected into high performance liquid chromatograph (LC-20A, shimadzu, Japan) system using a Kromasil C18 column (4.6 mm × 250 mm, 5 μm), methanol-distilled water in the ratio of 58:42 as mobile phase, at detection wavelength of 251 nm and flow rate of 1.0 ml min −1 ( ). The column temperature was 35°C.
Method validation results indicated calibration cure of y = 0.0151 x + 0.0017 ( R 2 = 0.9865) were linear in the concentration range of 50–800 ng/ml. Extraction recovery at 50, 100, and 500 ng/ml ranged from 81.07 to 83.88%; the inter- and intra-day precisions were all below 10%. Software WinNonLin® was used to analyze concentration-time data and the pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by standard two-compartment.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Screening of Oils, Surfactants, and Co-surfactants for Microemulsion
Table III reveals solubility of CXB in various solvents such as surfactants, co-surfactants, and oils at room temperature. CXB showed the highest solubility in triacetin followed by castor oil, IPM, and ethyl oleate. Among surfactants, the solubility of the drug in Tween 80 was greater than that in Labrasol, Tween 40, and Labrasol. CXB was found to be more soluble in Transcutol-P when compared to ethanol, propylene glycol, and PEG-400.

Orthogonal Experimental Design
The factors and levels were listed in Table IV though L9 (3 4 ) orthogonal experimental design. Three factors were considered: oil phases, surfactants, and co-surfactants. For each factor, three levels including visual inspection, globule size, and drug-loading rate were accepted to validate the results. Table IV lists the standard of grading in orthogonal experiment design which was considered as visual inspection, globule size, and drug-loading rate. Table IV shows the result of orthogonal experimental design. Comprehensive score is 50 in total, of which accounted for visual inspection, globule size, drug-loading rate are 10, 50, 40%, respectively.

Table V shows the result of variance analysis. As is known in visual analysis, surfactant has the largest effect on the formation of the microemulsion, followed by co-surfactants. The influence of co-surfactant could be arranged in a descending order as follows Transcutol-P > PEG-400 > ethanol and the influence of oil could be arranged in a descending order as follows triacetin > IPM > ethyl oleate. Therefore, the formulation optimization was selected synthetically that the oils, surfactants, and co-surfactants was triacetin, Tween 80, and Transcutol-P.

Structure of Pseudo-Ternary Phase Diagrams
To survey phase behavior, batches of microemulsion with different ratios of component were prepared. As is shown in Fig. 2 , there are triacetin, Tween 80, Transcutol-P, and distilled water with various Km values in the pseudo-ternary phase diagrams (without CXB). Fig. 2 Pseudo-ternary phase diagrams of MEs comprised of triacetin, S mix (Tween 80 and Transcutol-P), and water with various Km values. Note: Km = 1:2 ( A ); Km = 1:1
The result reveals that the microemulsion region was significantly increased when the Km value changes from 0.5 to 1.0, likely due to the increased proportion of surfactant and strengthening ability of emulsification. The microemulsion region has contraction and the clarification point of microemulsion showed an increasing trend when the microemulsion region expanded as the Km value from 1.0. surfactant co-surfactant ratio (S mix ) 1:1 shows better region of microemulsion synthetically.
Formulation Optimization
As shown in Table I , 13-run experiments were designed to study the influence of two-factor, five-level on the response variables and the response data were recorded. The obtained models were analyzed by an ANOVA. P value of J ss and Q 24 was equal to 0.0004 and 0.0007 (<0.05) respectively, indicated that the polynomial regression equations were statistically significant. The polynomial regression equations of X 1 , X 2 on the cumulative penetration quantity in 24 h and the permeation rate were represented as follows: $$ \begin{array}{l}{Y}_1\left({J}_{\mathrm{ss}}\right)=12.94+0.72{X}_1+3.33{X}_2+0.14{X}_1{X}_2-4.53{X_1}^2-3.01{X_2}^2\hfill \\ {}{Y}_2\left({Q}_{24}\right)=273.86+16.45{X}_1+71.89{X}_2+3.55{X}_1{X}_2-91.65{X_1}^2-59.49{X_2}^2\hfill \end{array} $$
The contour and response surface plots of independent variables and response variables were shown in Fig. 3 . By keeping oil ratio constant and with the increase of S mix , both the permeation rate ( J ss , μg cm −2 h −1 ) and the cumulative penetration quantity in 24 h ( Q 24 , μg cm −2 ) increased first and subsequently decreased. By keeping S mix ratio constant and with the increase of oil phase, the same trend was also obtained. To maximize J ss and Q 24 , the results were optimized by using Software Design-Expert® 8.0 and the optimal formulation was obtained when oil/microemulsion was 6.83% and S mix was 43.72%. The final composition was 6.83% triacetin, 21.86% Tween 80, 21.86% Transcutol-P, and 49.45% water. The three samples were prepared for the next validation about the predicted and experimental value of the response variables, as shown in Table VI . The relative error was less than 5%, revealing that the experimental value was similar to the predicted value.

The microemulsions were designed by CCD and response variable was measured, the cumulative penetration quantity in 24 h ( Q 24 , μg cm −2 ) and the permeation rate ( J ss , μg cm −2 h −1 ). The permeability curves of the CXB-loaded microemulsions are shown in Fig. 4 . It reflects that the cumulative penetration quantity and the permeation rate were affected by oil ratio and S mix .

Physicochemical Characterization of Optimized Microemulsion
Background was changed to blue and globule appeared colorless in staining test. The staining test result determined o/w-type microemulsion was formed. Although microemulsion is thermodynamically stable system, the absence of phase separation was confirmed by subjecting to centrifugation. Physical stability was certificated and optimized formulation did not appear any sign of phase separation after centrifuging at 6000 rpm for 15 min. The droplet size with PDI and zeta potential of prepared microemulsion was shown in Table VII . Zeta potential was also shown in Table VII . The average of globule size was 31.07 with PDI of 0.183.

Ex Vivo Permeation Study
0.5 g optimized microemulsion-based gel and conventional gel were used to design the study. The release curve was shown in Fig. 5 . It reveal that the drug was released in zero order from 0 to 12 h, gradually released slowly from 12 to 24 h and tended to steady after 24 h. As it shown in the Table X , the cumulative penetration quantity of microemulsion gel within 24 h ( Q 24 ) was 4.07 times and the permeation rate of microemulsion gel ( J ss ) was 4.10 times than conventional gel. The results indicated that optimized microemulsion-based gel gained higher permeation as compared to conventional gel preparation and transdermal ability was greatly improved. High permeation based on smaller globule size and high drug loading of microemulsion. The cumulative penetration quantity of microemulsion gel and conventional gel within 34 h ( Q 34 ) were 265.09 and 69.23 μg cm −2 , respectively. It revealed permeation of drug tended to steady after 24 h.

Skin Irritation Study
The study of CXB microemulsion-based gel was performed on albino rabbits to confirm the safety. A two-group value of skin erythema and edema score for a period of 1, 24, 48, and 72 h were graded at 0 and evaluated that the prepared formulation is not a skin irritant. This result revealed that all excipients used in CXB microemulsion-based gel are safe for topical application. Therefore, it may be considered that formulation was no-irritation potential and safe for skin.
In Vivo Anti-inflammatory Activity
The study of CXB microemulsion-based gel was performed in albino male rats. The result shown in Table XI revealed that egg white effected on paw edema. The CXB microemulsion-based gel has obviously inhibition of paw edema compared with blank gel and there was statistically significant difference between them. The CXB microemulsion-based gel and marketed diclofenac sodium gel both have inhibition of paw edema and there was statistically no significant difference between them. Thus, it may be concluded that formulation have inhibition of paw edema. The % inhibitions of CXB microemulsion gel and market diclofenac sodium gel group were 56.43 and 42.82%. The result indicated that the CXB microemulsion-based gel was more effective in anti-inflammatory activity than marketed gel.

Fig. 6 Mean plasma concentration-time curve following transdermal administration of celecoxib microemulsion-based gel and marketed Celebrex® in rabbits ( n = 6) Table XII Vivo Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Transdermal Administration of Celecoxib Microemulsion-Based Gel and Marketed Celebrex® in Rabbits Parameters Marketed Celebrex® Celecoxib microemulsion-based gel T max (h) 7.67 ± 0.82 5.34 ± 1.03 C max (ng mL −1 ) 271.11 ± 29.31 386.32 ± 39.11 AUC (0 − t ) (ng mL −1 h) 3273.71 ± 103.07 5460.61 ± 81.47 AUC (0 − ∞ ) (ng mL −1 h) 3281.21 ± 114.67 6048.51 ± 75.12 MRT (0− ∞ ) (h) 10.60 ± 1.23 16.17 ± 1.31 Relative bioavailability (%) 100 184.3
The figure revealed that advanced time of C max in CXB microemulsion-based gel than marketed Celebrex® may be owing to fast release rate. The AUC (0-∞) values of marketed Celebrex® and CXB microemulsion-based gel were compared. Self-made formulation with the relative bioavailability of 184.3% revealed that CXB microemulsion-based gel had better bioavailability than Celebrex®.
CONCLUSION
In this paper, the formulation was developed through the solubility, orthogonal experimental design, and pseudo-ternary phase diagram design, while optimized by using central composite design and response surface methodology. Microemulsion was prepared with triacetin (6.83%), Tween 80 (21.86%), and Transoutol-P (21.86%) to achieve the optimum qualities of globule size and drug loading. To enhance the viscosity and retention in the skin, 1% carbopol 934 was added to form the CXB microemulsion-based gel. Following ex vivo permeation study in mice, the final formulation showed higher permeation as compared to conventional gel preparation and transdermal ability was greatly improved. The in vivo pharmacokinetic study in rabbits reveals enhanced bioavailability compared to market Celebrex®. Therefore, the results have indicated the CXB microemulsion-based gel could be a promising formulation in drug delivery than the conventional dosage forms.
