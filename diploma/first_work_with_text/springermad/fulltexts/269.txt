Introduction
Non-Vitamin-K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have been approved by FDA and EMA, are recommended by the ESC and AHA guidelines [ , , ] and are used increasingly in daily practice [ ] to prevent stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non valvular atrial fibrillation (AF). Dabigatran was the first available NOAC; it directly inhibits the action of factor II (thrombin), it is administered in fixed doses of 110 or 150 mg twice daily and requires no routine laboratory anticoagulation monitoring [ ]. However, assessment of its anticoagulation effect may be needed in special clinical situations such as bleeding, thrombosis, need for urgent surgery or drug interactions. In the case of non-elective surgery the anticoagulation level is important to make decisions regarding the optimal time for the operation. According to the current recommendations of the ESC/EHRA on the use of NOACs [ ], patients on dabigatran who are scheduled for elective surgery should stop the drug, depending on renal function, 24–96 h before the operation. This time window may seem too long for non-elective cases and surgeons would like to know if the operation could be performed safely earlier.
The aim of our study was to assess the number of patients on dabigatran who could theoretically undergo surgery 12 h post last drug dosing by measuring drug levels and anticoagulant activity.
Methods
We studied 75 consecutive patients with non-valvular AF who were receiving dabigatran for at least 1 month to ensure steady anticoagulation status. The dose was chosen by the responsible physician. All patients gave written informed consent to participate in the study which was approved by the Ethics Committee of our hospital.
Baseline clinical characteristics, including risk factors, somatometric indices, concomitant drug use, history of bleeding, were recorded for all patients. CHA 2 DS 2 VASc score and HASBLED scores were calculated. Estimation of glomelural filtration rate (eGFR) was done using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula with the most recent available creatinine value.
The patients were instructed to receive the evening dose of dabigatran as usually and present next morning before the next scheduled dose for blood sampling (trough levels). After the blood was drawn the patient received the dabigatran dose so that the anticoagulant treatment was uninterrupted by our study protocol.
For each patient, two whole blood samples of 2.7 ml each, were obtained in tubes containing 0.3 ml of 0.109 M sodium citrate. One of them was centrifuged at 2500× g for 20 min and the supernatant plasma was used to measure both dabigatran levels and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). The second sample was used to perform thromboelastography (TEG) testing.
Dabigatran levels were determined using the HEMOCLOT thrombin inhibitor (HTI) assay (Hyphen Biomed, Neuville-Sur-Oise, France) which is an automated, modified thrombin time assay where patient citrated plasma is diluted 1:8 with 0.15 M NaCl and then incubated with normal plasma before the addition of thrombin. The HTI assay is a sensitive and reproducible assay for the determination of dabigatran levels and has been shown to be linear across a wide range of values [ , , ]. Plasma levels ≤30 ng/ml were considered low. APTT testing was performed using a dedicated reagent (Pathromtin SL, Siemens Diagnostics). Both measurements were performed on a Siemens BCS XP analyzer.
TEG was performed using the TEG-500 analyzer (Hemonetics) with CaCl 2 as activator. The TEG parameters that were measured were clot reaction time (R; normal value 2–8 min), clot growth index (k; normal 1–3 min), angle (α; normal 55–78 degrees), maximum clot strength by means of maximal amplitude (MA; normal 51–61 mm) and the percentage of clot lysed after 30 min (LY30; normal 0–8%).
Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation or median with 10th and 90th percentile values for continuous variables and as percentages for categorical ones. Normal distribution was evaluated using the Shapiro–Wilk test. Continuous variables were compared using t-test or Mann–Whitney U test, as appropriate. Associations of dichotomous variables were tested by chi square or Fisher’s exact test, depending on the number of expected observations. All tests were 2-tailed and considered to be significant at a 0.05 level. Correlations of drug levels with other coagulation parameters were assessed by the Spearman’s rank-order coefficient. A value of ρ ≥ 0.6 was considered to represent a strong, 0.6 > ρ ≥ 0.3 a moderate and ρ < 0.3 a weak correlation. Statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software (version 18, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
The baseline clinical characteristics of all patients are shown in Table 1 . The coagulation variables are shown in Table 2 . Dabigatran levels had significant inter-individual variability with trough values ranging from 10 to 430 ng/ml. A subgroup of 12 patients (16%) was identified with low trough dabigatran levels (≤30 ng/ml). This subgroup in comparison to the 63 patients with levels >30 ng/ml had no significantly different clinical characteristics apart from less likelihood to be female (Table 3 ). As expected aPTT values were lower in this subgroup with none of the patients having a value greater than 47 s. Three patients with aPTT <40 had dabigatran concentrations >30 mg/ml. Conversely, 11 of 63 patients with higher dabigatran levels had a low aPTT <40 s. The only TEG parameter that was different in the low dabigatran level subgroup was R (Table 3 ). None of these patients had an R value >8.7 min.

Discussion
Dabigatran and the other NOACs have no need for routine monitoring of anticoagulation activity. However in certain clinical situations, like bleeding, stroke, need for surgery, suspected overdose or the need for antidote administration, it is important to know the drug levels. Dilute thrombin time and ecarin clotting time are considered the best available tests for dabigatran since clotting time prolongation is linearly and dose-dependently related to drug concentrations [ , ].
In this study we measured anticoagulation activity and dabigatran levels in a consecutive series of patients with non valvular AF. The drug levels show a significant inter-individual variability with trough levels ranging widely among patients. The 10th and 90th percentile values ranged from 26 ng/ml (no relevant anticoagulant activity) to 170 ng/ml (level associated with increased bleeding risk). This is well known from previous studies such as the RE-LY where the respective values were 28 and 155 for patients on 110 mg dose or 40 and 215 ng/ml for patients on 150 mg dose [ ]. This is why, in the case of planned surgery the recommended stopping rule is to withhold therapy for more than 24 h [ ] in order to be certain that drug levels will be sufficiently low even in the case of over-responders. In our study we found that one-sixth of patients treated with dabigatran have low drug levels and coagulation activity 12 h after last dose and at least theoretically this could allow non-elective surgery early on. All such patients were receiving the 110 mg dose but none of the patients on 150 mg dose had low trough levels.
Since the HEMOCLOT assay is not widely available [ ] other global anticoagulation estimates have been used. Dabigatran prolongs aPTT in a concentration dependent manner but the correlation is curvilinear and less accurate in higher dabigatran concentrations [ , ]. In our cohort, few patients with low aPTT had dabigatran levels above 30 ng/ml but no patient with aPTT over 47 s had low drug levels. The correlation of aPTT with dabigatran levels was significant and moderately strong with a ρ-value of 0.69. Therefore, a low aPTT value can be used as screening to identify patients with a greater possibility of having low dabigatran levels.
TEG is also used as a global coagulation assay since it measures the formation of a fibrin clot in time [ ]. The correlation of dabigatran levels with the TEG parameters was not significant except for R-TEG which showed a significant but weaker ρ-value of 0.54. When R TEG was longer than 8.7 min the dabigatran levels were never lower than 30 ng/ml. TEG is a less valuable tool in comparison to aPTT.
We found no clinical characteristics (ie age, sex, renal function) that could predict low trough dabigatran levels. It seems that with the dose of 150 mg this is less likely to occur.
There are important limitations in our study. First, most patients were receiving the 110 mg dose of dabigatran. This was the choice of the treating physician and it can be explained by the fact that this was the only available dose in our country initially. Second, our patients had good renal function. There was no selection bias, however, as this cohort was a consecutive series of patients. In fact, the clinical characteristics of our patients is similar to the typical patients seen in real life international registries like the Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation (ORBIT-AF I), the Global Anticoagulant Registry in the FIELD (GARFIELD) [ , ] and the national country wide Registry of Atrial Fibrillation to Investigate New Guidelines (RAFTING) [ ]. It must be emphasized that this patient population did not actually undergo surgery and therefore we do not have the proof that surgery is safe when dabigatran levels are low. However, the fact that the other parameters are also suggesting low anticoagulation activity would reassure the surgeon to proceed with a procedure that cannot wait until the recommended time for elective surgery elapses. Of course the type of surgery should be taken into consideration. For example, an orthopaedic surgeon would happily proceed to an early non-elective hip-replacement operation with low dabigatran levels while a neurosurgeon would rather wait. In fact, there is an analogy with patients being anticoagulated with anti-vitamin K drugs; a short discontinuation of warfarin and an INR value of 1.6 may allow early moderate bleeding risk surgery, while a longer discontinuation to ensure entirely normal INR is preferable in high risk procedures.
In conclusion, our pilot study with a limited number of patients suggests that the possibility of having low enough levels of dabigatran after 12 h of the last dose intake is not small, especially for patients with good renal function receiving the 110 mg dose. Therefore, some patients can be candidates for early non-elective surgery, should such a need arise. aPTT can serve as a screening tool, since only a low value may be related to truly low dabigatran levels as assessed by the gold standard dilute thrombin time. Further studies with more patients who actually undergo surgery after different discontinuation intervals are needed to relate anticoagulation parameters and drug residual levels with perioperative bleeding events. At present, it must be noted that for elective surgery existing discontinuation rules as suggested by current guidelines should be respected.
