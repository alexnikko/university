1 Introduction
Psychiatrists are often consulted to provide their expert advice regarding behavioral issues that are co-morbidly seen among patients admitted in various medical wards. One of the common complaints that we are expected to address is altered sleep, in such settings. Patients on maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) suffer from poor quality of sleep [ , , ]. Previous literature suggests that nearly 53–87% of the patients on MHD have poor quality sleep as measured by Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index [ , , ]. Poor quality sleep has been correlated with the older age, female gender, poor quality of life, depression, and knowledge about their illness [ , ]. It has been shown that persons who use the internet to get the knowledge regarding their illness sleep better [ ]. Advancing age, female gender, and presence of depression are already known factors that may worsen the quality of sleep and make a person prone to insomnia [ , ].
Some other factors have also been analyzed in the MHD patients that could be related to the poor quality sleep; however, the results have been controversial. Some studies have reported that increasing duration of dialysis, physical health, co-morbidities, burden of kidney disease, sexual function, dyspnea, pain, itching, mean corpuscular volume, serum albumin, and diabetes mellitus worsen the quality of sleep [ , , , ]. However, contradictory studies are also available that suggest that quality of sleep in MHD patients is not related to age, gender, biochemical parameters, and other factors mentioned above [ , ]. Sleep quality has been reported to be independent of type of dialysis, i.e., the MHD and peritoneal dialysis suggesting that it could be either the burden of illness or the biochemical parameters that govern the quality of sleep [ , ].
Poor quality of sleep has been found to increase the mortality among patients on MHD [ , ]. However, one study did not find any correlation between the mortality and poor sleep among these patients [ ]. Not only the mortality but the morbidity is also important and poor quality of life has been consistently reported in patients on MHD with poor quality of sleep [ , , , ]. Moreover, patients with poor quality of sleep are also prone to consume a number of medications, e.g., hypnotics, antidepressants, antihistaminics, and narcotics [ ]. These medications may have their own adverse effects and can interfere with the disease course.
Thus, considering a high prevalence of poor quality of sleep which can negatively influence the quality of life among patients on MHD, it becomes an important issue. In addition, to treat the condition, we must understand the factors associated with poor quality of sleep. As we have already mentioned, contradictory predictors and correlates have been found across studies, thus necessitating the further exploration in this area. In view of these factors, we had planned to assess the prevalence of poor quality of sleep and its correlates among patients undergoing MHD.
2 Methodology
The present study was conducted after obtaining approval from the institute’s ethics committee in the dialysis unit of a teaching hospital. All adult patients undergoing MHD were explained the rationale of the study and participated after giving the written informed consent. However, subjects having chronic pain for any reason, those with impaired cognition, unable to respond to the questionnaire, having psychotic illness, having a previous diagnosis of sleep apnea or parasomnia were excluded from the study. Similarly, patients meeting criteria for RLS were also excluded [ ].
Demographic and anthropometric data of the subjects including age, gender, occupation, and body weight were recorded. Diagnosis and staging of CKD was made according to the standard criteria [ ]. Details regarding the etiology and duration of CKD, the presence of co-morbidities such as smoking, alcohol consumption, diabetes, and cardiovascular disorders were recorded. They were also asked if they were using any hypnotic medication.
In addition, data related to the shift of dialysis (day/evening/night), frequency of dialysis per week, and duration of dialysis were retrieved from the records of the patients. They were subjected to laboratory investigations, e.g., hemoglobin, albumin, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), serum iron, kidney function tests (blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine), serum albumin, calcium, phosphate, and potassium. In addition, sero-reactivity to Hepatitis B and C was also recorded from the medical records.
2.1 Measurement of Sleep Quality
Sleep quality was measured using Hindi version of Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) [ ].This instrument assesses the sleep quality on seven subscales which assess subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, its duration, sleep efficiency, daytime dysfunction, use of sleep medications, and sleep disturbances over the past 1 month. All scores are summed together to reach a final score. Score of 5 and above depicts poor sleep quality. This scale has the sensitivity of approximately 90% and specificity around 87% to differentiate between good sleepers and poor sleepers. This questionnaire has been used in both original and Hindi version in India [ , , , ]. English version of this questionnaire has been validated against polysomnography [ ]. We have validated the Hindi version of PSQI with a gold standard tool (unpublished data).
2.2 Statistical Analysis
The analysis was performed using statistical software SPSS version 22 (IBM Corp. Released 2013. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 22.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.). Difference in the proportions between categorical variables was analyzed using the Chi-square test. Independent sample t test was used to compare the means between those with good and poor sleep quality. Lastly, the variables that achieved statistical significance were put into binomial logistic regression to bring a model.
3 Results
A total of 253 patients were requested out of which 201 patients consented and hence they were included in this study. Average age of the subjects was 54.7 ± 15.1 years and duration of kidney disease was 37.1 ± 19.8 years. 40.3% subjects were women and 50.7% complained of poor quality of sleep. Further information of the study sample may be seen elsewhere [ ].
Gender distribution was comparable between good and poor sleepers (X2 = 0.79; P = 0.37), so was the duration of MHD ( P = 0.25). Prevalence of hypertension (X2 = 0.28; P = 0.59), smoking (X2 = 0.01; P = 0.9), alcohol intake (X2 = 0.4; P = 0.52), hepatitis C (X2 = 0.08; P = 0.76), and hepatitis B (X2 = 1.75; P = 0.18) was also comparable between both groups. However, poor sleepers had less than 3/week dialysis (68.6% among poor sleepers vs. 21.2% among good sleepers; X2 = 45.58; P < 0.001), nighttime dialysis shift (52.9 vs. 20.2% among good sleepers; X2 = 35.29; P < 0.001), diabetes mellitus (56.9 vs. 39.4% among good sleepers; X2 = 6.14; P = 0.01), and hypnotic use (X2 = 18.02; P < 0.001). Similarly, subjects with poor quality of sleep were older (57.3 ± 14.3 years vs. 52.1 ± 15.4 years among good sleepers; P = 0.01). Other parameters are shown in Table 1 .

Binomial logistic regression suggested that 43% variance in the results were because of the factors that were included in regression model (Negelkerke R square = 0.43). This model was able to classify 77.8% good sleepers and 74.5% poor sleepers correctly. Logistic regression analysis showed that adequacy of dialysis and schedule of MHD predicted the poor sleep quality. Less than thrice a week dialysis increased the odds for poor sleep by 6.6 ( P < 0.001; 95% CI 3.2–13.4) and afternoon and nighttime MHD shift by 3.2 ( P < 0.001; 95% CI 1.2–8.3) and 4.6 ( P < 0.001; 95% CI 2.1–10), respectively.
4 Discussion
This study showed that MHD patients with poor quality of sleep were older, had inadequate dialysis, often had night time dialysis shift, had diabetes mellitus, hypnotic use, and higher rates of mortality in the subsequent 1 year. However, on binary logistic regression only the less than 3/week dialysis, and afternoon and nighttime dialysis shifts appeared to have influenced the sleep quality even after removing known cases of confounding factors such as sleep apnea, RLS, and parasomnias.
Earlier studies have also shown that a huge proportion of patients on MHD have poor quality of sleep. Various studies have reported that this range varied from 53 to 88% [ , , , , , , ]. Poor quality of sleep is an important factor to be considered in this group as this has been found to worsen the quality of life [ , ]. The available literature shows that a variety of factors are associated with poor sleep quality, e.g., young age, older age, depression, reduced appetite, diabetes, body pain, sedentary life, body mass index, waist circumference, dyspnea, and sleep apnea to name a few [ , , , , , ].
In the present study, older age was a significant predictor for poor quality of sleep in univariate model; however, in the multivariate regression, this was not found to contribute to the poor quality of sleep. These findings need to be assessed further in view of contradictory results that have been reported earlier [ ]. In the same fashion, although diabetes mellitus was found as a predictor for the poor quality of sleep in univariate analysis but in the multivariate model it did not show any significant effect. Similar results have been reported earlier as well [ , , ], except one study where diabetes remained a significant predictor even in multivariate model [ ]. Thus, in view of contradictory evidences, these findings need to be replicated in a multi-centric study with larger sample size.
Several biochemical factors have also been reported to be associated with poor quality of sleep, e.g., high ferritin, high serum calcium, low level of parathyroid hormones in serum, high serum creatinine, high serum phosphorus before dialysis [ , , ]. However, in this study we did not find any association between the sleep quality and these factors. This difference could be related to difference in the methods adopted for measuring the sleep quality. Unruh et al. [ ] used the Medical Outcome Study Sleep Problem Index to assess quality of sleep and Turkmen et al. [ ] have assessed the sleep quality using Post-sleep Inventory. Both the studies have reported a significant association between poor quality of sleep and pre-dialysis serum phosphate levels. However, studies that have used the PSQI to measure sleep quality did not find any association between sleep quality and various biochemical parameters, like the present study [ , , , ].
Previous literature suggests that patients with poor quality of sleep are more likely to be prescribed hypnotics, opioids, antidepressants, and antihistaminics to induce sleep [ , ]. We also found that subjects with poor quality of sleep had higher chances of being prescribed any of these medications or a combination of them. Whether these agents were responsible for the poor quality of sleep or they were prescribed because of poor quality of sleep could not be ascertained owing to the cross-sectional nature of these studies including the present one.
Multivariate logistic regression in the present study depicted that only the shift of dialysis and less than thrice a week dialysis increased the odds of poor quality of sleep. Poor quality of sleep was reported more when the dialysis was done in the evening or night shift. This finding has several explanations, e.g., patients in our dialysis unit usually come from far-situated areas and they reach their home during late hours of the day thus compromising their sleep. However, we think that it is an over simplistic explanation and these are physiological changes that occur during and after the dialysis that actually play a major role in determining quality of sleep. Sleep apnea is an important factor in these patients and using a screening questionnaire, approximately one-third to half of them has been found to suffer from sleep apnea [ , ]. Patients on the evening shift of hemodialysis had higher chances of having sleep apnea which could worsen the sleep quality, explaining the findings of the present study [ ]. However, though we excluded cases that already had a diagnosis of sleep apnea, still we did not assess for the sleep apnea in the present study. This leaves a small window that had allowed some patients with sleep apnea to be included in the present study and thus this clearly remains an area for the future research.
Whether the dialysis frequency is related to the sleep quality is a matter of debate. It has been suggested that in a subset of patients, twice weekly dialysis is optimal, while other study has found that more intensive dialysis is better [ , ]. Our nephrology unit caters patients from distant areas with a span of nearly 150 km and most of the patients are bearing the expenditure of the treatment themselves. These factors were responsible for twice weekly MHD in a subset of patients against the recommended dose of three times or more a week. Since these factors were unique to our center, we could not find similar study. However, one study did not find any effect of dose of hemodialysis on sleep quality [ ]. Another study compared the effect of 8-h MHD thrice a week with 4-h MHD thrice a week and reported an improvement in sleep quality with longer MHD [ ]. But this effect disappeared after 2 months. However, effects of these regimens on sleep are still to be assessed.
In conclusion, we found that the evening or night shift of hemodialysis and twice weekly hemodialysis worsened the quality of sleep. These factors are modifiable and measures should be taken in this regard. This knowledge may help us to improve the sleep of the patients and restrict the prescription of hypnotic drugs.
