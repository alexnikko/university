Introduction
Vasovagal syncope is the most common neurally-mediated syncope in clinical practice, which accounts for approximately 30–50% in patients with syncope [ ]. The Bezold–Jarisch reflex has been suggested to be an important mechanism for vasovagal syncope. This reflex might be provoked by orthostatic challenge which causes reduction in venous return and decrease in blood pressure (BP). The following compensative sympathetic activation results in positive chronotropic and inotropic cardiac effects. This hypercontractility of the hypovolemic ventricle is thought to stimulate ventricular afferents in the left ventricle and then trigger an inhibitory response by sympathetic withdrawal and/or vagal overdrive [ ]. This autonomic reflex finally causes bradycardia (cardio-inhibitory response) and/or hypotension (vaso-inhibitory response) and can result in syncope.
Although essentially all humans are regularly subjected to orthostatic stress (e.g., upright posture), vasovagal syncope is relatively rare with increased incidence in subsets of subjects. Abnormal sympathetic modulations might contribute to the occurrence of syncope in these subjects. For instance, an initial exaggerated sympathetic activation in response to decreased thoracic blood volume may induce reflex hypotension and/or bradycardia and cause vasovagal syncope [ , , ], which is considered to be a protective mechanism against sympathetic overactivity [ ]. And a withdrawal of sympathetic tone is observed to be another factor causing vasovagal syncope [ ], which is in accordance with the evidence of reduced cardiac and renal norepinephrine spillover in syncope patients [ ].
Based on the this evidence, we hypothesized that individuals might have different sympathetic responses when faced with initiative factors for vasovagal syncope. Veratridine is a classical chemical compound used to induce the Bezold–Jarisch reflex by stimulating the ventricular afferents [ , ], and has been used to simulate the process of vasovagal syncope in canines [ ]. The present study aims to investigate the potential different sympathetic responses involved in vasovagal syncope using a canine model of veratridine-induced vasovagal reaction and to provide evidence for the elucidation of abnormal autonomic modulations which affect the occurrence of vasovagal syncope.
Methods
Animal preparation
Twenty male mongrel dogs (1–1.5 years old) weighing 13–20 kg were used for the study. All animal studies were approved by the animal experimental administration of Wuhan University and the ethics committee of Wuhan University Renmin Hospital. Since autonomic responses may differ between sexes, we used only male dogs to exclude the potential sexual interference. Dogs were anesthetized with 3% pentobarbital sodium (30 mg/kg) and then ventilated with room air through a trachea cannula by a positive pressure ventilator. Additional doses of 2 mg/kg pentobarbital sodium were administered at the end of each hour during the experiments. Body temperature was maintained at 36.5 ± 1.5 °C using a heating pad. The right femoral artery and vein were cannulated for arterial pressure monitoring and compensation for body fluid loss with normal saline (100 ml/h), respectively. Surface ECG was continuously recorded. Left thoracotomy was performed at the fourth intercostal space to expose the heart. The pericardium was opened to expose the left atrial appendage and the left stellate ganglion was exposed for neural recordings (Fig. 1 ). The left stellate ganglion was located above the aortic arch and posterior to the left common carotid artery and the left subclavian artery.

Induction of the Bezold–Jarisch reflex
The Bezold–Jarisch reflex was induced by a bolus of veratridine (15 μg/kg) injected into the left atrium through the left atrial appendage. Standard surface electrocardiogram and arterial pressure were continuously monitored before and after injection, and recorded by the PowerLab data acquisition system (16/30; AD Instruments, New South Wales, Australia). Data were analyzed using the LabChart 7.2 software (AD Instruments).
Recording and analysis of nerve activity in left stellate ganglion
The left stellate ganglion nerve activity was continuously recorded before and after veratridine injection. The electrodes were constructed from silver-coated stainless-steel pins and were enclosed by Teflon except the tips. The electrodes were then inserted into the left stellate ganglion and fixed in place with tissue glue. A ground lead inserted under the skin was used at the time of recording. Nerve activity from the left stellate ganglion was recorded with a PowerLab data acquisition system (16/30; AD Instruments) with band-pass filters set at 300 Hz to 1 kHz and a sampling rate of 1000 Hz. Notch filtering was applied to eliminate the electrical noise. The nerve activity was determined using the spike histogram module in the LabChart software. Two different types of left stellate ganglion nerve activity were observed in our study: spike discharge activity and burst discharge activity, which had been described in a previous study [ ]. Spike discharge activity was usually characterized by its relatively higher amplitudes and discernible spikes, while burst discharge activity always had relatively lower amplitudes and unobvious spikes. Since veratridine injections were sometimes immediately followed by burst discharge activity, which might result from direct stimulation of veratridine, this activity was excluded by selectively counting only the activity of high-amplitude spikes that exceeded a signal-to-noise ratio of 3:1 [ , ] using the amplitude discriminator. A time segment of 30 s both before and after veratridine injection was manually selected for the analysis of heart rate (HR), BP and spike discharge activity. The 30-s segment post-veratridine was selected from the beginning of the plateau stage of BP lowering to reveal the most evident changes in HR, BP and nerve activity. Spikes per 30 s were counted as the frequency of nerve activity, and biphasic heights of spikes were measured from each 30-s segment and then averaged as the amplitude of nerve activity.
Measurements of plasma norepinephrine and acetylcholine
Blood samples were collected from femoral vein 30 s before and 30 s after veratridine injection. After centrifugation at 2000 g , 4 °C for 10 min, plasma samples were then stored at − 20 °C. The concentrations of norepinephrine and acetylcholine were determined using the canine norepinephrine ELISA kit and the acetylcholine ELISA kit (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, P. R. China), according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer.
Data analysis
Data analysis was performed using Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) v.17.0. All continuous variables were tested for normality of distribution using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Data with normal distribution were expressed as mean ± SD, paired t test was used to analyze the changes before and after veratridine injection and Student’s t test was used to compare the differences between two groups. Data with skewed distribution were expressed as median [interquartile range]. The total range was calculated as the difference between the highest and lowest values and the interquartile range was calculated as the difference between the third quartile and the first quartile. As shown in Fig. 3 b, c, median, interquartile range and total range were illustrated as horizontal line, bar and whiskers, respectively. For skewed data, the changes before and after veratridine injection were compared with Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test and the differences between two groups were compared with Mann–Whitney U test. All significance levels are computed as 2-tailed and the level of significance was set at p < 0.05.
Results
In all dogs, veratridine injection resulted in decreases in both HR and BP. Two types of neural activity (high-amplitude spike discharge activity and low-amplitude burst discharge activity) were recorded from the left stellate ganglion. Veratridine induced high-frequency spike discharge activity in some dogs (Group A, n = 11), and one typical example is shown in Fig. 2 a. In contrast, spike discharge activity was scarce and relatively unresponsive to veratridine in the remaining dogs (Group B, n = 9). In these dogs, no distinct high-frequency spike discharge activity was observed or only low-amplitude burst discharge activity was found after injection of veratridine (one typical example is shown in Fig. 2 b). The contribution of left stellate ganglion high-frequency spike discharge activity to the reflex responses after injection of veratridine was evaluated by comparison of HR, BP, and plasma levels of norepinephrine and acetylcholine in Group A versus Group B dogs.

Nerve activity from the left stellate ganglion
Figure 2 a shows a typical example of left stellate ganglion neural recordings after veratridine injection from a dog in Group A. The injection of veratridine resulted in distinct high-frequency spike discharge activity in left stellate ganglion shortly after BP and HR started to decrease, accompanied by attenuated decreases in HR and BP. In contrast, only scarce spike discharge activity and/or low-amplitude burst discharge activity were recorded from the left stellate ganglion after injection of veratridine in Group B, for which an example is shown in Fig. 2 b. Figure 3 shows the changes in left stellate ganglion nerve activity before and after veratridine injection in the two groups. Spike discharge activity was quantified and compared, whereas burst discharge activity was excluded from the analyses and not included in the results shown in Fig. 3 b, c. In Group A, both the frequency and amplitude of left stellate ganglion neural discharges were increased sharply after veratridine injection [frequency, 3 (2–10) vs. 175 (114–375) spikes per 30 s, p = 0.003; amplitude, 0.014 (0.003–0.019) vs. 0.028 (0.023–0.035) mV, p = 0.003]. In Group B, only the frequency of left stellate ganglion neural discharges was slightly increased after veratridine injection [5 (3–9) vs. 11 (9–14) spikes per 30 s, p = 0.012], while the amplitude was not significantly increased [0.007 (0.005–0.020) vs. 0.005 (0.004–0.018) mV, p = 0.373]. The frequency and amplitude of post-veratridine left stellate ganglion nerve activity in Group B were both significantly lower than those in Group A (both p < 0.01).

Plasma norepinephrine and acetylcholine
Veratridine induced increases of norepinephrine and acetylcholine in both groups. As shown in Fig. 4 , similar increases of acetylcholine were observed in the two groups (Group A, from 158.18 ± 5.17 to 198.55 ± 20.68 μg/ml, p = 0.003; Group B, from 154.09 ± 12.92 to 178.23 ± 14.22 μg/ml, p < 0.001). However, the increase of norepinephrine in Group A was significantly greater than in Group B. In Group A, plasma norepinephrine increased from 7.90 ± 0.89 to 111.63 ± 15.1 ng/l ( p < 0.001), while, in Group B, this increase was from 6.72 ± 1.68 to 48.11 ± 33.81 ng/l ( p = 0.026). The post-veratridine norepinephrine in Group A was significantly higher than that in Group B ( p = 0.002). Fig. 4 Changes in plasma norepinephrine and acetylcholine after veratridine.

Changes in HR
Injection of veratridine resulted in rapid decreases in HR, while this response was significantly attenuated in Group A. As shown in Table 1 , there were no differences in baseline HR between Group A and Group B. Veratridine induced significant HR decreases in both groups. HR decreased from 153 ± 16 to 69 ± 22 bpm ( p < 0.001) in Group B, while in Group A the HR decrease was from 139 ± 18 to 102 ± 23 bpm ( p < 0.001). A less intense drop in HR was observed in Group A compared with Group B (HR decrease, − 37 ± 24 vs. − 84 ± 28 bpm, p = 0.001; percentage change of HR, − 26 ± 16% vs. − 54 ± 14%, p < 0.001). The post-veratridine HR in Group A was significantly higher than that in Group B (102 ± 23 bpm vs. 69 ± 22 bpm, p = 0.004). In addition, the longest RR intervals after veratridine injection in Group A were significantly shorter than those in Group B (0.7 [0.5–0.8] vs. 1.2 [1.1–3.5] s, p < 0.001). Veratridine induced a longest RR interval of 7.4 s in Group B, while the longest RR induced in Group A was just 1.1 s.

Changes in arterial pressure
Veratridine induced decreases in systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) in both Group A and Group B, while the responses were significantly blunted in Group A. As described in Table 2 , the baseline SBP, DBP and MAP showed no significant differences between two groups. Significant decreases of SBP, DBP and MAP after veratridine injection were observed in both groups (all p < 0.01). However, BP reductions (expressed as percentage change, ΔSBP %, ΔDBP % and ΔMAP %) were significantly attenuated in Group A compared with Group B (ΔSBP %, − 14 ± 10 vs. − 30 ± 11%, p = 0.004; ΔDBP %, − 30 ± 12 vs. − 56 ± 16%, p < 0.001; ΔMAP %, − 23 ± 11 vs. − 44 ± 12%, p < 0.001). And the post-veratridine DBP and MAP in Group A were significantly higher than those in Group B (both p < 0.05), while no significant difference was found in post-veratridine SBP.

Discussion
In the canine model of vasovagal syncope, the Bezold–Jarisch reflex was successfully induced by veratridine. Different types of sympathetic responses were observed after veratridine injection. In some of the dogs, distinct high-frequency spike discharge activity from the left stellate ganglion was induced by veratridine, while in the other dogs such spike discharge activity was scarce and relatively unresponsive to veratridine. The bradycardia and hypotension involved in the Bezold–Jarisch reflex were both significantly attenuated in dogs with distinct left stellate ganglion high-frequency spike discharge activity when compared with the other dogs without such left stellate ganglion firings. This result indicated that the distinct sympathetic activation was protective against veratridine-induced Bezold–Jarisch reflex.
Veratridine might have directly activated sympathetic nerves, as revealed by the nerve activity evoked within 5 s of veratridine injection (see Fig. 2 a). This direct effect would probably occur shortly after veratridine reached the left stellate ganglion (e.g., with 2–3 cardiac cycles, around 1 s when HR was 140–150 bpm). However, the high-amplitude spike discharge activity in group A or the low-amplitude burst discharge activity in Group B appeared after 10–15 s following veratridine injection, when veratridine had taken effect for a period of time and HR and BP had already started to decrease, indicating that these firings were reflex activations rather than direct activations. To confirm the sympathetic nerve activity recorded from the left stellate ganglion, sodium nitroprusside was injected in some dogs and rapid increase in the spike discharge activity was observed. In addition, the nerve activity recorded from the left stellate ganglion and the veratridine-induced decreases of HR and BP all disappeared after ganglionic blockade. This evidence suggested that the veratridine-induced decreases of BP and HR and related left stellate ganglion activity were associated with autonomic reflex. Similar to our results, divergent responses of sympathetic nerve activity were observed during the Bezold–Jarisch reflex in a previous study on rats [ ]. The cardiac sympathetic nerve activity was inhibited or excited in response to the induction of the Bezold–Jarisch reflex. And the excitation of cardiac sympathetic nerve activity was evidently inhibited after bilateral vagotomy, proving that it was related to vagal afferents. The authors suggested that a possible mechanism of the sympathetic activation in the Bezold–Jarisch reflex was sympathovagal coactivation, which was recognized as a centrally generated autonomic motor pattern [ ].
Since our results have revealed an association between distinct sympathetic activation and the attenuation of the Bezold–Jarisch reflex, it is conceivable that sympathetic activation might play important protective roles against the occurrence of vasovagal syncope. Rapid adjustment to maintain appropriate BP and HR during different stress conditions is an important function of cardiovascular sympathetic nerves. When susceptible individuals are challenged by triggers such as ventricular hypercontractility, the subsequent Bezold–Jarisch reflex will lead to severe sympathetic withdrawal and/or vagal overdrive and finally cause syncope. These triggers might also induce similar autonomic fluctuations in normal individuals; however, they might be quickly corrected due to rapid activation of the sympathetic nervous system. As shown in Fig. 2 a, shortly after BP decrease, the distinct firing in left stellate ganglion was gradually intensified and further BP lowering was prevented, which suggested the protective roles of sympathetic activation.
The insufficiency of sympathetic activation in patients with neurally-mediated syncope have also been observed in clinical settings. Blunted increases in muscle sympathetic nerve activity and plasma norepinephrine levels accompanied by syncope during tilt were observed in patients with neutrally-mediated syncope, when compared with control subjects [ ]. In the present study, distinct left stellate ganglion spike discharge activity and greater plasma norepinephrine increases were found in Group A, in which the BP and HR decreases were significantly attenuated. According to the results, we suggest that susceptible individuals of vasovagal syncope might also have sympathetic activations when facing triggers of syncope, but that these sympathetic activations might be different or weaker in comparison to healthy individuals.
The treatment for vasovagal syncope remains to be a great challenge up until now. Based on the theory that sympathetic overactivity during orthostatic stress was the initiating factor for vasovagal syncope [ ], beta receptor blockade has been used to treat vasovagal syncope. However, beta-blocker was not more effective than placebo in a clinical trial [ ]. In the present study, distinct sympathetic activation was found to be protective in vasovagal syncope. Since sympathetic activation will be compromised by the use of beta-blockers, this treatment may not be a good therapeutic option for vasovagal syncope. Cardiac pacing seems to be an effective therapy for cardio-inhibitory vasovagal syncope; however, its efficacy remains questionable [ ]. In recent years, autonomic intervention such as ganglionated plexus (GP) ablation has been suggested to be a novel therapy for vasovagal syncope, as proved by several trials using GP ablation to treat cardio-inhibitory or mixed-type vasovagal syncope [ , , ]. However, the effects of GP ablation on vaso-inhibitory vasovagal syncope have not been confirmed. The suggested mechanism for the therapeutic role of GP ablation was parasympathetic attenuation which weakened the efferent cardio-inhibitory limb of vasovagal syncope [ ], thus GP ablation may not be effective for the vaso-inhibitory subtype. According to the present study, to enhance the sympathetic tone might be another way to prevent syncope in both cardio-inhibitory and vaso-inhibitory vasovagal syncope. And further efforts should be made to elucidate the abnormalities of sympathetic activation and central autonomic motor patterns in patients with vasovagal syncope.
Study limitations
Although the veratridine-induced Bezold–Jarisch reflex is a classical model for vasovagal syncope, it may not accurately simulate the process of vasovagal syncope in humans. In addition, although the present study observed an association between distinct left stellate ganglion firings and the attenuation of the Bezold–Jarisch reflex, the underlying mechanisms were not elucidated. Since neurons of the left stellate ganglion are heterogeneous, and project to multiple target organs, they may respond differently to veratridine injection and cause varied changes in HR and BP. However, the types of neurons generating the distinct spike discharge activity recorded from the left stellate ganglion were unknown, which was another limitation of the study. Furthermore, only male dogs were used in this study, thus the results may not apply to female dogs.
Conclusions
Different types of sympathetic responses (with or without high-frequency spike discharge activity in left stellate ganglion) were observed in a canine model of the Bezold–Jarisch reflex-mediated vasovagal syncope induced by veratridine. Distinct sympathetic activation as represented by left stellate ganglion high-frequency spike discharge activity protected against both bradycardia and hypotension in this model of vasovagal syncope. Our findings may have therapeutic implications.
