Psycopathological symptoms have frequently been described in patients with cirrhosis, but few data are available on their association with cirrhosis prognosis (Singh et al. ; Rocca et al. ; Häuser et al. ; Krahn and Di Martini ; Nardelli et al. ; Pegum et al. ).
The MELDNa score, taking into account also the effect of low serum sodium, has been described to perform better than the MELD score as a cirrhosis prognostic and severity tool (Kim et al. ). However, although hyponatremia has been shown to be associated with depression in other settings (Marco et al. ), the MELDNa has never been used to investigate the association between cirrhosis prognosis and the severity of psycopathology.
No data are available on defense mechanisms investigated by structured questionnaires in cirrhotic patients.
In cirrhotic patients, advanced disease and hyponatriemia are associated with impaired health-related quality of life (HRQoL) (Cárdenas and Riggio ; Orr et al. ) and reduced HRQoL has been reported to be associated with psychopathological symptoms (Singh et al. ; Häuser et al. ; Nardelli et al. ; Gutteling et al. ; Palmieri et al. ).
The literature provides several evidences that poor cirrhosis prognosis, assessed by the Child-Pugh or the MELD score, is independently associated with reduced HRQoL (Orr et al. ). No data are available on the independent association between MELDNa and HRQoL in cirrhosis.
HRQoL improvement has been demonstrated after liver transplantation (LT) (Yang et al. ). Psychopathological symptoms are frequent after deceased donor LT and, although prospective studies have shown some amelioration within one year from LT, there is a need of data on long-term changes with respect to the pre-transplant picture (Pegum et al. ; O’Carroll et al. ; Burra et al. ).
In the present study, we aimed to compare in cirrhotic patients three disease prognostic indexes, namely the Child-Pugh, the MELD and the MELDNa scores, as predictors of psychopathological symptoms, defense style mechanisms and HRQoL. In addition, we compared psychopathological symptoms, defense style mechanisms and HRQoL before and after LT.
Patients and methods
Patients
Caucasian cirrhotic outpatients, elective candidates for deceased-donor LT, were consecutively recruited to this observational cohort prospective study between February 12th 2010 and January 23rd 2013 at the Liver Transplant Unit of “Sapienza” University of Rome ( n = 232).
Exclusion criteria were (Fig. 1 ): liver-based genetic defects ( n = 5); current or previous episodes of overt hepatic encephalopathy clinically assessed according to West Haven Criteria (Ferenci et al. ) ( n = 92); alcohol-related liver disease without an abstinence period of at least 6 months, as certified by our alcohol- related disorders Center ( n = 43); a diagnosis of Axis I Psychiatric Disorders assessed by the SCID-I according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-R) criteria ( n = 39) (American Psychiatric Association ), with the exception of alcoholic behaviour disorders; not completely answered questionnaires ( n = 9). Forty-four cirrhotic patients were finally enrolled. The questionnaires were self-administered on the occasion of one of the first follow-up outpatient visits during assessment of eligibility to enter the LT waiting list, when they did not know yet if they would have entered the waiting list. In all patients we prospectively collected clinical data and demographics including educational level (high education levels such as university and higher professional education versus low-to-medium level, that is all other levels). As shown in Fig. 1 , 30 of the 44 enrolled patients entered the waiting list for LT and 20 were transplanted. Fourteen stable transplanted patients with a minimum post-operative follow-up of one year were submitted again to the same questionnaires. Forty-four control healthy subjects without a diagnosis of Axis I Psychiatric Disorders (American Psychiatric Association ), matched for age, sex, BMI and educational level were recruited among hospital staff and their relatives. This group did not include patients relatives. Fig. 1 Study population. Flow chart of patients enrolled and excluded before entering the liver transplant waiting list and after LT
Psychopathological and defense style profiles
Psychopathology was assessed by the Symptom Checklist-90-revised (SCL-90-R), which is a 90-item self-report questionnaire and measures 9 primary symptom dimensions: somatization, obsessive compulsive, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation and psychoticism. As global index of overall psychological distress, the General Severity Index (GSI) was calculated (Derogatis ; Prunas et al. ). Using the Defense Style Questionnaire (DSQ), a 88-item self-report questionnaire, we assessed four defense styles: maladaptive action, image distorting, self sacrificing and adaptive (Bond ; San Martini et al. ). In both the SCL-90-R and DSQ questionnaires higher scores indicate more severe symptoms.
Health-related quality of life
Screening for HRQoL was performed by the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36), which contains eight independent subscales: physical functioning (limitations in physical activities), physical role (limitations in usual role activities because of physical health problems), bodily pain, general health perception, vitality (energy and fatigue), social functioning (limitations in social activities because of physical or emotional problems), emotional role (limitations in usual role activities because of emotional problems), mental health (psychological distress and well-being). Scores for each subscale range between 0 and 100, with increasing values indicating better quality of life perception (Ware and Sherbourne ; Apolone and Mosconi ).
Ethical considerations
This study was approved by our University Research Ethics Committee and informed written consent was obtained from all patients. The work was performed in accordance with the principles of the 1983 Declaration of Helsinki.
Statistical analysis
Data are reported as medians (25th–75th percentile) and as numbers (percentage) for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. Intergroup differences for categorical variables were estimated by the Chi-square or the Fisher exact test, as appropriate. Intergroup differences for continuous variables were evaluated by the Student t-test or the Mann-Whitney U test, after assessment of normality by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. In cirrhotic patients, the performance at each scale was considered abnormal when the score was above, for the SCL-90-R and DSQ questionnaires, or below, for the SF-36 questionnaire, the median score of the healthy control group. To verify the independent association between performance at the SCL-90-R, DSQ and SF-36 questionnaires and MELDNa, MELD and CHILD-Pugh scores we used separate binary logistic regression models for each prognostic score. In each model, the performance at the SCL-90-R, DSQ and SF-36 questionnaires (abnormal vs normal) was entered as dependent variable while those variables with P -value less than 0.10 at univariate analyses were considered as independent covariates for the multivariable analyses.
SCL-90-R, DSQ and SF-36 questionnaire performance before and after LT was compared by the Student t-test or by the Wilcoxon test, as appropriate. Correlations were assessed by the Spearman test. A value of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Analyses were carried out using the “Statistical Package for Social Sciences” (SPSS, version 22.0, Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
Study population and healthy control characteristics and performance at SCL-90-R, DSQ and SF-36 questionnaires
Table 1 shows demographics of the healthy control and cirrhotic groups and clinical variables of the latter. No difference in age, gender, BMI and educational level was present between the two groups. Cirrhotic patients had advanced disease with median MELD, MELDNa and Child-Pugh scores of 13.0, 14.0 and 7.0, respectively. Twenty-six of the patients presented with an HCC, all within the Milan transplant criteria (Mazzaferro et al. ).

Absolute and relative frequencies are reported for categorical ones
No difference at SCL-90-R and DSQ questionnaire performance was found between healthy controls and the cirrhotic group (Supplementary Table 1 ). In particular, with regard to the SCL-90-R, no differences were found at the GSI (median value in cirrhotics and controls, respectively: 0.42 vs 0.43, P = 0.69).
With regard to the SF-36 questionnaire, cirrhotic patients showed significantly lower values than healthy controls at physical functioning ( P < 0.001), physical role limitation ( P < 0.001), general health perception ( P < 0.001), social functioning ( P = 0.03) and emotional role limitation ( P = 0.009). The physical ( P < 0.001) and mental ( P = 0.02) component summaries were significantly lower in cirrhotics than in healthy controls.
To evaluate whether the relationships between psychopathological symptoms and quality of life differed within the cirrhotic and the healthy control group, we separately correlated the global score index at the SCL-90-R questionnaire and each of the SF-36 scales in each group (Supplementary Table 2 ). The GSI at the SCL-90-R questionnaire: a) did not correlate with physical role limitation in both groups; b) showed a significant negative correlation with physical functioning, pain and social functioning in cirrhotic patients, but not in healthy controls; c) showed a significant negative correlation with general health perception, vitality, role limitation in emotional problems, mental health, physical component summary and mental component summary in both groups. The correlations present in both groups were stronger in cirrhotics than in healthy controls.
Factors associated with abnormal performance at the SCL-90-R questionnaire in cirrhotic patients
Univariable analyses of the MELDNa, MELD and Child-Pugh scores between patients with abnormal and normal performance at each SCL-90-R scale are reported in Supplementary Table 3 . As shown in Fig. 2 , statistically significant differences included [median (25th–75th percentile)]: higher MELDNa [17.00 (13.50–20.00) vs 13.00 (9.00–15.00), respectively; P = 0.003] and MELD [14.50 (11.00–18.00) vs 10.50 (9.00–15.00), respectively; P = 0.03] in the GSI; higher MELDNa [17.00 (13.00–19.00) vs 13.00 (9.00–15.00), respectively; P = 0.01] in the depression scale; higher MELDNa [15.50 (13.50–19.00) vs 12.00 (8.50–17.00), respectively; P = 0.02] in the paranoid ideation scale; higher MELDNa [16.00 (12.50–18.50) vs 10.00 (9.00–14.00), respectively; P = 0.03], MELD [14.00 (10.00–17.00) vs 9.00 (8.00–13.00), respectively; P = 0.01], and Child-Pugh [7.00 (6.00–9.00) vs 6.00 (5.00–7.00), respectively; P = 0.02] in the psychoticism scale. The AUROC of MELDNa for abnormal GSI was 0.720 (95% CI: 0.568–0.873; P = 0.01).

Univariable analyses of patients’ demographic and other clinical variables according to SCL-90-R performace are reported in Supplementary Table 4 .
Table 2 shows significant associations found at multivariable analyses between abnormal performance at the different SCL-90-R scales and increasing values of the MELDNa, MELD and Child-Pugh prognostic scores in the cirrhotic group. Abnormal performance at the GSI was independently and significantly associated with MELDNa ( P = 0.02), but not with MELD and Child-Pugh scores. Other significant associations were: interpersonal sensitivity scale with MELDNa score ( P = 0.02); depression scale with MELDNa ( P = 0.01), MELD ( P = 0.02) and Child-Pugh ( P = 0.03) scores; psychoticism scale with MELDNa ( P = 0.04), MELD ( P = 0.02) and Child-Pugh ( P = 0.04) scores.

Factors associated with abnormal performance at the DSQ questionnaire in cirrhotic patients
Univariable analyses of the MELDNa, MELD and Child-Pugh scores between patients with abnormal and normal performance at each DSQ scale are reported in Supplementary Table 3 .
Statistically significant differences included only higher MELDNa score [16.00 (12.50–19.00) vs 13.00 (9.00–17.00), respectively; P = 0.04]. Univariable analyses of patients’ demographic and other clinical variables according to DSQ performace are reported in Supplementary Table 5 .
At multivariable analyses, no significant association was found between abnormal performance at the different DSQ scales and the MELDNa, MELD and Child-Pugh prognostic scores.

Univariable analyses of patients’ demographic and other clinical variables according to SF-36 performace are reported in Supplementary Table 6 .
Table 2 shows the significant associations found at multivariable analyses between abnormal performance at the different SF-36 scales and increasing values of the MELDNa, MELD and Child-Pugh prognostic scores in the cirrhotic group. Significant associations were: role limitation for physical problems scale with MELDNa score ( P = 0.05); vitality scale with MELDNa ( P = 0.02) and MELD ( P = 0.03) scores; role limitation for emotional problems scale with MELDNa score ( P = 0.03).
Comparison of SCL-90-R, DSQ and SF-36 questionnaire performance of cirrhotic patients before and after liver transplantation
Thirty patients entered the LT waiting list and 20 were transplanted (Fig. 1 ). In 14 stable transplanted patients with a follow up of at least 1 year after LT, SCL-90-R, DSQ and SF-36 questionnaires were repeated after 875 (562.5–1181.3) days [median (25th–75th percentile)] from LT and 1312 (681.3–1481.0) days from the pre-LT questionnaire administration. As shown in Table 3 , the only significant differences between questionnaire performance after LT compared to those obtained before LT were a worsening in the somatization scale and GSI at SCL-90-R, and an improvement in the general health perception scale at SF-36. In particular, after transplantation compared to the pre-operative status: a) the number of cirrhotic patients showing an abnormal performance was respectively 12 (86%) and 5 (36%) for SCL-90-R somatization scale, and 14 (100%) and 5 (36%) for SCL-90-R GSI; b) the SCL-90-R GSI worsened in all patients and performance at the SCL-90-R somatization scale worsened in all but one patient, in which remained stable at his very high pre-operative level; c) the number of cirrhotic patients showing an abnormal performance was respectively 6 (43%) and 13 (93%) for SF-36 general health perception scale.

Table 4 shows the correlations between the GSI at the SCL-90-R questionnaire and each of the SF-36 scales in the 14 cirrhotic patients studied before and after LT. Before LT, the GSI negatively correlated with almost all the SF-36 scales with the exception of physical functioning, social functioning and mental health. At difference, the only correlations of the GSI after LT were those with mental health and with mental component summary.

Discussion
We found that, in cirrhotic out-patient candidates to LT without major psychiatric disorders who still do not know whether they will enter or not the LT waiting list, increasing MELDNa score was independently associated with psychopathology in the scales of interpersonal sensitivity, depression, psychoticism and GSI at the SCL-90-R questionnaire. Increasing MELD and Child-Pugh scores were not associated with abnormal interpersonal sensitivity and GSI, but only with abnormal depression and psychoticism scoring. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first investigating the predictive ability of the MELDNa, MELD and Child-Pugh scores with respect to psychopathology in cirrhosis. Rocca et al. previously found that the severity of depression and anxiety symptoms was independently associated with the Child-Pugh score in liver transplant cirrhotic candidates including subjects (43%) with a psychiatric diagnosis (Rocca et al. ). In our study, after exclusion of psychiatric patients, we confirmed the association between depressive symptoms and the Child-Pugh score.
The second result of our study was that increasing MELDNa was independently associated with poor HRQoL, with regard to role limitation for physical and for emotional problems and vitality at the SF-36 questionnaire, while the MELD score did so only in the vitality domain.
Several studies have previously investigated the association between HRQoL and disease stage in cirrhotic patients showing that, in general, increasing the severity of chronic liver disease worsens HRQoL (Orr et al. ). Some studies used the MELD score (Orr et al. ) and, to the best of our knowledge, only one study investigated and found the association of MELDNa with HRQoL in cirrhotics, but no multivariable analysis was performed (Ranawaka et al. ). Most studies showing an association of reduced HRQoL with increasing severity of cirrhosis used the Child-Pugh score, which includes also the presence and severity of ascites and hepatic encephalopathy, two clinical variables with a strong independent negative impact on HRQoL (Orr et al. ). In our present study, we did not find any association between HRQoL and Child-Pugh score. This could be due to the fact that hepatic encephalopathy was an exclusion criteria and our cirrhotics did not have severe ascites, as they were closely followed up within a liver transplant program.
The better association of the MELDNa, compared to the MELD score, with reduced HRQoL and the presence of psychopatholgy could simply be due to the better prognostic ability of the MELDNa in reflecting cirrhosis severity (Kim et al. ). With regard to psychopathology, patients with high MELDNa scores could be those with more symptoms because they are stressed by the awereness of a poor prognosis. In addition, patients with high MELDNa scores are likely to be under high-dose diuretic administration, with subsequent hyponatremia, and fluid and sodium intake restriction for ascites management. Pharmacological treatment and dietary restrictions could act as stressors.
Alternatively, hyponatremia (which increases the MELDNa score) could be the result of psychopathology and caused by a poor compliance to sodium restriction indicated for the treatment of ascites in cirrhosis. These patients in fact, are prone to develop ascites as a consequence of portal hypertension and, differently from the healthy subjects, develop dilutional hyponatremia in the case of poor compliance to fluid restriction, because of a disproportionately higher renal retention of water with respect to sodium retention. In keeping with the hypothesis that psychopathology could induce hyponatremia via a poor compliance to dietary restrictions, stressors involving interpersonal tension have been related to an increased dietary sodium intake in healthy women (Jaremka et al. ). However, in analogy to the reported direct association between hyponatremia and worse HRQoL (Cárdenas and Riggio ; Ahluwalia et al. ; Ahluwalia et al. ), also psychopathology could be secondary to hyponatremia with an unknown mechanism at the neurological level.
The third result of the present study was obtained by repeating the questionaries after LT in 14 stable patients. We found that general health perception ameliorated after LT, while somatization and GSI of psychopathological symptoms worsened. In addition, before LT the SCL-90-R GSI negatively correlated with almost all the SF-36 scales, while after LT the correlation of the SCL-90-R GSI was restricted only to the mental health domain and mental component summary. The correlation between psychopathology and worse quality of life that we found in cirrhotic patients before LT, which was present also in our healthy control group and in other clinical settings (Heba Ibrahim and Hesham ; Chang et al. ), is probably driven by cirrhosis severity. To explain the lack of correlation between psychopathological status and HRQoL that we found after LT, we hypothesize that graft recipients are focused on their body with the fear of possible disease recurrence, liver rejection and immosuppression treatment complications. In fact, the informed consent for entering the LT waiting list containing these possible complications, was signed after the administration of the pre-transplant test battery in all cases. Furthermore, post-transplant increased somatization scoring, which has been already shown to occur frequently post-transplant (Baranyi et al. ), could result from the perception by the recipient of housing inside his body one else liver readapting bodily self-image. All these causes could determine the use of their own body as a communication vehicle for preferential expression of psychological distress which increases after LT, while general health ameliorates.
Our prospective data on post-transplant changes in psychopathology constitute a further novelty of our study, because the considerable time elapsed after LT at retesting allowed stabilization of their psychopathological status. However, a limitation of the study is the small number of patients evaluated again after LT. In addition, we only used self-reported psychological measures but not also intensive interview or narrative-rating procedures.
Age, gender, BMI and educational level have been shown to influence quality of life in cirrhotic patients (Orr et al. ). Although no data are available on the association between performance at the SCL-90-R questionnaire and demographic characteristics in cirrhotic patients, the performance at the SCL-90-R questionnaire has been shown to correlate with age and educational level in healthy controls (Hyphantis et al. ) and with age, gender, educational level and BMI in patients with different medical conditions (Hyphantis et al. ; Martínez et al. ). Because all these demonstrated correlations between demographic characteristics and both quality of life and psychopathology, it is very important, as we did in the present study, to use an age, gender, BMI and educational level matched healthy control group to define the abnormal cut-offs for each scale of the SCL-90-R and of the SF-36 questionnaries.
As expected, we found reduced HRQoL in cirrhotic patients compared to the healthy controls. However, at difference from one study by Palmieri et al., where cirrhotics had higher SCL-90-R scores than healthy controls (Palmieri et al. ), we found similar scores in the two groups. Since increasing age influences performance at the psychopathological tests, this discrepancy could be explained by the fact that in our study the healthy controls were older and cirrhotics were younger than in Palmieri’s study. In addition, our cirrhotic patients might have had a beneficial psychological impact by the liver transplant prospect.
Finally, our results indicate that the relationships between psychopatological symptoms and reduced perceived quality of life is stronger in cirrhotics than in healthy controls. This suggests that, to improve the quality of life in patients with cirrhosis, in addition to clinical interventions designed to control the severity of liver disease, is advisable a specific psychological support which, in turn, could also improve adherence to clinical interventions.
In summary, the clinical impact of the present study is that in LT cirrhotic candidates, even in the absence of major psychiatric disorders, the severity of cirrhosis should be monitored by the MELDNa score to better establish the right psychological counselling aimed to improve quality of life. If confirmed in a larger population, the second clinical message of the present study is that, although general health perception improves after LT, transplanted patients should be also carefully investigated for psychopathology. In fact, after LT there is a worsening of psychopathology and in particular of somatization, while psychopathology and HRQoL are not anymore strictly related as they are before LT. For the above mentioned reasons every liver transplant centre should include a dedicated psychiatrist/psychologist to manage patients both before and after transplantation in close collaboration with the hepatologists and surgeons.
