Introduction
It is now suspected that inflammation might play a critical role in the tumor occurrence, progression and metastasis [ ]. The neutrophil count rises while the lymphocyte count drops during systemic inflammation, which could lead to a change in the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) [ ]. The NLR has been studied as an effective predictive marker of a range of cancers, including gastrointestinal cancer [ ] and epithelial ovarian cancer [ ]. Several studies suggested that NLR might be a predictor of poor survival in bladder cancer patients [ , , , ], but to date there has been no systematic review to make a pooled analysis. Therefore, we conducted this review to evaluate the evidence regarding NLR as a potential predictive factor in bladder cancer.
Materials and methods
Selection of studies
We reviewed PubMed and Embase citations between January 1, 1966 and November 10, 2016. The search terms used were [NLR OR (neutrophil lymphocyte ratio)] AND [(bladder cancer) OR BCa OR NMIBC OR MIBC]. All studies meeting the following criteria would be included: (1) studies evaluating NLR as a prognostic factor in bladder cancer patients, including non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) and muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC); (2) studies with detailed data on main oncology outcomes including overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), or progression-free survival (PFS), with hazard ratio (HR) and the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for NLR; (3) studies published in the English language. When more than one publication was identified from the same clinical trial, the most recent or complete one would be used. According to the International Bladder Cancer Group and the articles enrolled, recurrence was defined as the first histologically confirmed tumor relapse in the bladder, regardless of its stage. Progression was defined as an increase in tumor grade from low to high, or an advance in T stage from Tis or Ta to T1, development of T2 or greater or lymph node (N+) disease or distant metastasis (M1) [ ].
Data extraction and clinical endpoints
Data abstraction was conducted according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses statements and any discrepancies between reviewers were resolved by consensus. For each study, the following information was extracted: first author’s name, year of publication, country, study design, cancer staging, sample size, NLR cutoff values, outcome measured, HR with 95% CI, and mean follow-up time. The primary endpoint was the OS and the secondary endpoints were CSS, RFS and PFS.
Statistical analysis
The survivals were extracted from selected articles directly and pooled survivals were calculated using random-effects or fixed-effects models depending on the heterogeneity. Statistical heterogeneity among studies was assessed by using the Cochran Q statistic, and inconsistency was quantified with the I 2 statistic which estimates the percentage of total variation across studies due to heterogeneity rather than chance. The assumption of homogeneity was considered invalid for P < 0.05. When substantial heterogeneity was not observed, the pooled survivals were calculated on the fixed-effects model with the Generic Inverse Variance method. When substantial heterogeneity was observed, the pooled survivals were calculated on the random-effects model with the Der-Simonian Laird method. Stata 14.0 for windows (StataCorp LP, USA) was used to extract, pool and analyze data for summary estimates. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Publication bias was assessed by using Begg’s or Egger’s test.
Results
Characteristics of eligible studies
The initial search yielded 60 articles from PubMed and 109 from Embase. The abstracts of 169 studies were evaluated and 58 duplicated articles were excluded. The remaining 111 articles were screened and 76 were excluded by titles and abstracts. Subsequently the full texts of the remaining 35 studies were read carefully and 18 more were excluded because of no survival data or HR value. In the end, 17 studies were ultimately selected for the meta-analysis, comprising a total of 5,425 patients (Fig. 1 ) [ , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ]. Fig. 1 The article selection process
All of the eligible articles were published between 2012 and 2016. Five studies were conducted in Japan, two in Canada, three in USA, and the others were conducted in Austria, China, Netherlands, Italy, Israel, Korea and Spain, respectively. Of the 17 eligible studies, 16 were based on retrospective analysis of survival data. The sample size ranged from 68 to 1,117 four were multicenter studies and the others were single-center ones. Four studies recruited patients with NMIBC, three recruited patients with MIBC, one study did not provide this information and the others recruited patients with all stages. Except for the four studies enrolling NMIBC patients who underwent transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT), all the patients in the other studies were treated with radical cystectomy (RC) with or without neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) and salvage chemotherapy (SC). The NLR cut-off value ranged from 2 to 3. The OS, CSS, RFS and PFS were recorded in 11, 8, 8 and 6 studies, respectively. All studies were published in full manuscript form (Table 1 ).

Outcome from eligible studies
For OS, an elevated NLR predicted a worse outcome with a pooled HR of 1.19 (95% CI 1.07–1.31) from 11 studies. A significance regarding heterogeneity ( I 2 = 72%) showed the inconsistency of clinical and methodological aspects between the studies ( P < 0.01), and the random effect model was applied (Fig. 2 ). Fig. 2 Meta-analysis of NLR regarding OS in bladder cancer patients
For CSS, an elevated NLR predicted a worse outcome with a pooled HR of 1.40 (95% CI 1.17–1.69) from eight studies. A significance regarding heterogeneity ( I 2 = 87%) showed the inconsistency of clinical and methodological aspects between the studies ( P < 0.01), and the random effect model was applied (Fig. 3 ). Fig. 3 Meta-analysis of NLR regarding CSS in bladder cancer patients
For RFS, an elevated NLR predicted poor outcomes in both MIBC and NMIBC patients, with a pooled HR of 1.39 (95% CI 1.02–1.90) from four studies and 1.79 (95% CI 1.26–2.55) from four studies, respectively. Pooled analysis showed the same result with a pooled HR of 1.58 (95% CI 1.24–2.03) from all the eight studies. Significant heterogeneities between these studies were observed in both the MIBC subgroup ( I 2 = 83.2%, P < 0.01) and the NMIBC subgroup ( I 2 = 76.0%, P < 0.01), and the random effect model was applied (Supplementary Figure 1).
For PFS, only one study enrolled patients with MIBC disease and the elevated NLR predicted a poor outcome in that study with a HR of 1.25 (95% CI 1.10–1.42). The significance of heterogeneity between studies cannot be applied in this subgroup. The other five studies enrolled NMIBC patients and a higher NLR predicted a worse outcome with a pooled HR of 1.74 (95% CI 1.34–2.28). Combining all these studies together, the result remains the same. Patients with a higher NLR, MINC or NMIBC will have a worse PFS, with a HR of 1.33 (95% CI 1.19–1.49). No significance regarding heterogeneity was detected between the studies in both the NMIBC subgroup ( I 2 = 24.0%, P = 0.261) and all the studies ( I 2 = 50.7%, P = 0.072), and the fixed effect model was applied (Supplementary Figure 2).
Heterogeneity
Heterogeneities between studies were observed for OS, CSS and RFS. To find the potential source of heterogeneities, meta-regression was conducted by using the variables year of publication, geography (Asian vs. non-Asian), sample size (≥200 vs. <200), cancer type (NMIBC vs. all stage), treatment (RC vs. TURBT) and NLR cut-off value (≥2.5 vs. <2.5).
For OS, the results showed that sample size ( P = 0.001) contributed to the source of heterogeneity, while year of publication ( P = 0.163), geography ( P = 0.313) and NLR cut-off value ( P = 0.051) did not. All the studies for OS had the same cancer type (all stage) and treatment (RC).
For CSS, the results showed that sample size ( P = 0.951), geography ( P = 0.136) and NLR cut-off value ( P = 0.808) did not contribute to the source of heterogeneity whereas year of publication ( P = 0.000) did. All the studies for CSS had the same cancer type (all stage) and treatment (RC).
For RFS, the results showed that year of publication ( P = 0.000), geography ( P = 0.005), cancer type ( P = 0.000) and treatment ( P = 0.000) contributed to the source of heterogeneity, whereas sample size ( P = 0.718) and NLR cut-off value ( P = 0.161) did not.
Publication bias
Because the number of studies enrolled was less than 20, the publication bias was evaluated using Egger’s method. Publication bias was detected for all the outcomes, viz. OS ( P = 0.001), RFS ( P = 0.001), PFS ( P = 0.026) and CSS ( P = 0.010), as shown in Supplementary Figures 3–6.
Discussion
Many biomarkers extracted from the routine blood test have been evaluated for predicting the outcomes of bladder cancers in recent years, including hemoglobin level, lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR), platelet counts, leukocyte counts, platelet-to-leukocyte ratio (PLR), fibrinogen value, NLR, serum C-reactive protein (CRP) value. Gierth showed that anemia was associated with worse RFS, CSS, and OS in bladder cancer patients following RC [ ]. Temraz found that lower LMR was associated with reduced DFS and OS in bladder cancer patients after RC [ ], while Bhindi reported that LMR was not an independent predictor in these patients, and NLR and hemoglobin together might be the most efficient variables for predicting CSS and OS [ ]. Schulz found that a lower PLR and leukocytosis were significantly associated with worse oncological outcomes in patients undergoing RC for bladder cancer [ ], since platelets might provide cancer cells with protection from the immune system and facilitate tumor cell adhesion to the vascular endothelium by forming tumor thrombi [ ]. Liu found that elevated fibrinogen tended to be an independent predictor of advanced bladder cancer [ ], while Roche reported that fibrinogen mediated bladder cancer cell migration in an in vitro test [ ]. Of these parameters, NLR and CRP were the top two most frequently reported. Dai conducted a meta-analysis and found that an elevated CRP level was associated with poor OS and RFS in patients with urological cancers [ ], and we conduct this meta-analysis to find whether NLR could be a predictor for the oncological outcomes in bladder cancer patients.
This meta-analysis showed that NLR had predictive value for survival outcomes in bladder cancer patients, including OS, CSS, RFS and PFS. Bladder cancer patients with higher pretreatment NLR had worse survival.
Further studies have found that there was an intimate connection between inflammation and cancer [ , , ]. The hypothesis was that inflammatory mediators and cytokines released in inflammatory reactions could led to cell damage and gene mutation, which were considered to be important elements for cancer cell development and were helpful in creating a microenvironment promoting cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. In addition, the inflammation would accelerate cancer progression by increasing vascular permeability and up-regulating lymphatic infiltration and stromal invasion at metastatic sites [ ].
The NLR value increases in inflammatory reactions, in which the neutrophil granulocyte count increases while the lymphocyte count decreases, and thus it could be an effective predictive factor in cancers. In comparison with other examinations, the NLR can be easily obtained by peripheral blood tests before treatment and it is cheap and convenient. The NLR value has been proven to be effective in gastrointestinal cancers [ ], and high NLR might also be a prognostic factor in bladder cancer patients, with a worse oncological outcome providing appropriate prognostic information for these patients [ ]. There have been several studies focusing on this issue within recent years, and this meta-analysis summarizing these studies shows that bladder cancer patients with a higher NLR have worse oncological outcomes, including OS, CSS, PFS and RFS.
Significant heterogeneities have been observed between studies for OS, CSS and RFS. The meta-regression showed that different factors contributed to different outcome measures, including the year of publication, geography, sample size, cancer types and treatments, and this could partially explain the heterogeneities. In addition, there might be heterogeneities in selection bias, which were inevitable in small sample size studies.
Significant publication bias has been detected in this meta-analysis as well. The potential reason might be that those studies with negative results would have less opportunity to be published, and the fact that only studies in English were enrolled might contributed to this as well. Considering this, if all the studies had been reported, there could potentially be a different conclusion, that the NLR was of no value in predicting the outcome in bladder cancer patients.
However, there are several limitations to this meta-analysis. First, evidence evaluating the main oncology outcomes with NLR value for bladder cancer patients is still limited: only 11 studies were enrolled for OS, eight for CSS and PFS, and only six for PFS. If more studies were enrolled, the result might be more reliable. Second, most of the studies included were retrospective, so biases in patient selection and data analysis were unavoidable, which contributed to the heterogeneities and influenced our final results. Third, a clear definition of the cut-off values remained to be determined, and within the studies included different values defined “high NRL”, ranging from 2 to 3. This heterogeneity would hinder the clinical practice of NLR. Fourth, the NLR values could also be affected by some other clinical, for example liver disease, inflammatory diseases and infection [ , , ], but we could not access these data and include them in the pooled analysis.
Despite these limitations, our meta-analysis supported the value of NLR for predicting survival outcomes in bladder cancer patients. Nevertheless, well-designed and large-scale studies are still needed, and a definite NLR cut-off value needs to be further clarified since it is still under evaluation.
Conclusion
This meta-analysis of published studies revealed that elevated NLR might be valuable as a predictive factor for survival in bladder cancer patients, and economical and easily conducted as well. However, well-designed and large-scale studies are still needed, and a definite NLR cut-off value needs to be further clarified.
