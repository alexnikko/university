Introduction
Calcium is a potent endogenous regulator of cell signaling, and its role in neurological and psychiatric diseases has been extensively reviewed [ , , ]. Voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) are key players of calcium entry into neurons, and they are classified as high voltage-activated (N-, L-, P-, Q-, and R-types) or low voltage-activated (T-type) channels [ , ]. Nine of ten VGCC isoforms are expressed in the nervous system, in cell bodies of neurons, dendritic and axon regions, pre-synaptic nerve terminals, and primary afferent nerves in the spinal dorsal horn. Dysfunctional calcium channels have been implicated in several diseases, such as ataxia, migraine, pain, Parkinson’s disease, and epilepsy [ , , ]. In addition, many groups have reported that VGCCs might play a critical role in chronic neuroinflammation [ , , ].
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory, demyelinating, and autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) [ ]. According to the Multiple Sclerosis International Federation, approximately 2.5-million people are affected by MS, and there is currently no cure for this disease [ ]. Classically, MS has been regarded as the result of peripheral immune system activation (lymphocytes, macrophages, antigen-presenting cells) with consequent destruction of protective myelin sheaths that surround nerve fibers, due to oligodendrocyte loss, cytokine release, microglia activation, and chronic oxidative injury [ , ]. The most common clinical symptoms are fatigue, vision impairment, motor incoordination, sensory disturbances, pain, and cognitive deficits, as well as urinary frequency [ , ]. In the progressive form, MS has a substantial economic impact, mainly by compromising young adults, with neurological disability associated with incapacity to work and early retirement [ , ]. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a classical model to study MS in rodents [ ]. An EAE model has been translated successfully into effective treatments for MS patients, such as fingolimod and interferon-β, as well as some monoclonal antibodies [ ]. Of note, Tokuhara and colleagues showed that EAE induction in mice lacking the α1β subunit of N-type VGCC resulted in a mild form of the disease [ ]. Furthermore, it has recently been shown that nimodipine, a selective L-type VGCC blocker, induced microglial apoptosis by decreasing the levels of nitric oxide (NO), inducible NO synthase (iNOS), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a mouse EAE model, besides displaying apoptotic effects in cultured microglial cell lineages [ ].
Peptide toxins isolated from animal venoms either inhibit or activate a large number of targets such as acetylcholine receptors, coagulant/anticoagulant besides voltage-gated sodium, and calcium channels [ , ]. CTK 01512-2 is a recombinant version of the peptide Phα1β, derived from the Brazilian armed spider Phoneutria nigriventer [ , ]. Several studies reported that Phα1β toxin exhibits marked antinociceptive effects in pre-clinical pain models, through the inhibition of N-type VGCCs [ , , ]. In addition, our group demonstrated that spinal blockage of N-type VGCC by Phα1β attenuated nociceptive and inflammatory events associated with hemorrhagic cystitis, including bladder oxidative stress, neutrophil migration, and cytokine production [ ]. Recently, Tonello and colleagues reported that CTK 01512-2 inhibited the calcium influx induced by allyl isothiocyanate, a TRP ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) agonist, as assessed in hTRPA1-HEK293 cells, IMR90 fibroblasts, or dorsal root ganglion neurons [ ]. CTK 01512-2 also caused a significant reduction of tumor development in an orthotopic mouse glioblastoma model [ ]. The N-type VGCC blocker ziconotide, obtained from the cone snail Conus magus and commercially known as Prialt®, was approved by the FDA in 2004 and it is used for the management of chronic intractable pain [ ]. This reinforces the notion that VGCC inhibitors might be clinically useful, with a satisfactory safety profile.
Considering the limited number of therapeutic options to control signs, symptoms, and progression of MS, and the potential relevance of calcium channels for neuroinflammation, the present study sought to characterize the effects of CTK 01512-2 on behavioral, biochemical, histological, immunological, and imaging parameters in the mouse model of EAE. Actions of CTK 01512-2 were compared to those produced by ziconotide or, by the drug used in clinics for MS, fingolimod, in this animal model. Herein, we provide novel evidence, indicating that CTK 01512-2, possibly by blocking calcium influx, displays beneficial effects in the mouse model of EAE.
Materials and Methods
Experimental Animals and Ethical Statement
All animal experimental procedures complied with the National Institutes of Health Animal Care Guidelines (NIH publications n° 80-23), and were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul (PUCRS, Porto Alegre, Brazil) (protocol number 14/00424). Female C57BL/6 mice (18–22 g, 6–8 weeks old, total number 197 animals) were obtained from the Center of Experimental Biological Models (CeMBE/PUCRS). The animals were housed in a room with controlled temperature (22 ± 1 °C) and humidity (50–70%) under a 12:12-h light-dark cycle (lights on 07:00 AM). Food and water were provided ad libitum. The animals were randomly distributed among the experimental groups, and all the behavioral assessments were conducted without knowledge of the treatments to reduce the experimental bias. The number of animals and the intensity of noxious stimuli used were the minimum necessary to demonstrate consistent effects. The description of the data for this study is in agreement with the “Checklist for reporting and reviewing studies of experimental animal models of multiple sclerosis and related disorders” [ ].
Study Design—EAE Induction, Clinical Scoring, and Animal Care
EAE was induced on day 0 by a subcutaneous immunization into the flanks with 200 μg of myelin oligodendrocytes glycoprotein (MOG 35-55 ) peptide, dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and emulsified with an equal volume of complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) supplemented with 500 μg of Mycobacterium tuberculosis extract H37Ra (total volume 200 μL per animal). This procedure was repeated after 7 days to increase the incidence of EAE, as previously described [ ]. Additionally, the animals were also injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) on days 0 and 2 post-immunization with 300 ng of Pertussis toxin to increase the permeability of the blood-brain barrier. Non-immunized (naïve) and EAE animals were used as negative and positive control groups, respectively. Mice were monitored daily and were weighed every 5 days (as parameters of health), for up to 25 days. To assess the neurological impairment, a clinical EAE scoring system was used according to the following scale: score 0, no disease; score 1, loss of tail tone; score 2, hindlimb paresis; score 3, hindlimb paralysis; score 4, tetraplegia; and score 5, moribund and or death [ ]. Clinical signs were measured 7 days post-immunization, every 2 days, over a total period of 25 days. The mice that did not develop the disease were excluded from the study. A humane end-point was adopted when (i) weight loss exceeded 20% of the mouse initial weight, (ii) if a mouse reached a clinical score of 5, (iii) if a mouse was unable to right itself, or (iv) if the animal exhibited a total loss of ability to access food and water for 24 h.
Pharmacological Treatment Protocols
The animals were treated intrathecally (i.t.) according to the technique described by Hylden and Wilcox [ ], with minor modifications. The animals were slightly anesthetized with sevoflurane, and a needle connected to a 10-μL microsyringe was introduced through the skin. Subsequently, 5 μL of PBS containing the recombinant peptide CTK 01512-2 (25, 50, or 100 pmol/site) or ziconotide (25, 50, or 100 pmol/site) were injected between the L5 and L6 vertebral spaces. Fingolimod, which is a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator, was administered by the oral route (p.o.), once a day, for 19 days (days 7–25), beginning to count at the time of the first MOG 35-55 injection (day 0). CTK 01512-2 and ziconotide were administered on the 4th, 10th, 15th, 20th, and 24th days after EAE induction by MOG 35-55 . The control animals received the same volume of PBS i.t. or p.o. For the systemic treatment, mice were also slightly anesthetized with sevoflurane, and CTK 01512-2 (0.2 mg/kg) or ziconotide (0.2 mg/kg) was injected by retro-orbital route, every 3 days, after 7 days of the first MOG 35-55 application (7th, 10th, 13th, 16th, 19th, 22nd, and 25th days). The protocols of treatment for all the tested drugs (doses, route of administration, and time of injection) were chosen in accordance with previous publications [ , , , ].
Mechanical Hypersensitivity
To assess the mechanical hypernociceptive response, mice were placed individually in clear Plexiglas boxes (9 × 7 × 11 cm) on elevated wire-mesh platforms to allow access to the ventral surface of the right hind paw [ ]. The animals were acclimatized for 1 h before behavioral testing, and mechanical hypersensitivity was evaluated at several time-points (2nd–14th day). The withdrawal response frequency (in percentage) was measured following ten applications (with a duration of 3 s each, and interval of 15 s among each) of von Frey hairs (VFHs, North Coast, Gilroy, USA). Stimuli were delivered from below to the plantar surface of the right hind paw. The 0.4 g VFH produces a mean withdrawal frequency of about 15%, which is considered an adequate value for the measurement of mechanical hyperalgesia [ ]. In order to determine the basal mechanical thresholds, all the groups were evaluated before disease induction. The incidence of mechanical hyperalgesia was ~ 75% in the positive control group (vehicle).
Thermal Nociception
The hot-plate test was used to measure the thermal response latencies according to the method described by Tsagareli [ ], with some modifications. In these experiments, the hot-plate apparatus (Ugo Basile, Verese, Italy) was maintained at 50 ± 1 °C. The animals were placed into a glass cylinder 20 cm in diameter on the heated surface, and the time between placement and jumping or licking the paws was recorded as the index of response latency. A 30-s cut-off was adopted as the maximal time of reaction to avoid tissue damage. All the animals were evaluated before disease induction to determine the basal thermal threshold. Thermal nociception was assessed at several time-points until day 15, since after this day the clinical signs of EAE, such as motor incoordination, were visible. Thermal hypersensitivity evoked by an EAE model was reproducible throughout the different experimental sets, with the latency ranging between 10 and 15 s for the positive control group (vehicle).
Spatial Memory Test
The spatial memory was evaluated at day 7 or day 10 (acute phase) after the first MOG 35-55 administration, using the object location test. The apparatus used in the study was an acrylic open-field arena (46 × 46 × 36 cm), placed in a sound-isolated room, under a weak red light (8 ± 2 lx). On day 7 or day 10, the mice were individually placed in the center of the arena for 5 min, where they were allowed to explore two identical copies of plastic rectangles (4 × 2 × 2 cm; named training phase). Both types of objects could be either white or black, and they were placed 7 cm away from the walls of the apparatus. The arena was cleaned with 30% alcohol after each animal was tested. Ninety minutes after the training phase, mice were returned to the arena for the testing phase, when they were allowed to explore one copy of the object at the same location and one copy of the object at a novel location. The time spent by the animals exploring (when mice sniffed, whisked, or looked at the objects from no more than 1 cm away) the objects at new (novel) and at old (familiar) locations was recorded over 5 min. All locations of the objects were counterbalanced among the groups. To analyze the cognitive performance, a location index was calculated as previously described by Dutra et al. (2013) [ ]: (Tnovel × 100)/(Tnovel + Tfamiliar), where Tnovel is the time spent exploring the displaced object and Tfamiliar is the time spent exploring the non-displaced object. The test is based on the spontaneous preference of mice, previously exposed to two identical objects, for the novel location, and has been used for the assessment of hippocampal-dependent memories [ , ].
Rotarod Activity
The ability of mice to maintain balance and motor coordination was evaluated through the rotarod apparatus (Insight, Ribeirão Preto, Brazil). The apparatus consists of a rod (3 cm in diameter) with five flanges at intervals, allowing for up to four mice to be tested simultaneously. Mice were placed in the rotarod at a constant speed of 16 rpm until 60 s. The latency to fall was automatically recorded in seconds. All the animals were given a habituation training session on the apparatus (inter-trial interval of 3 min to minimize the effect of fatigue), prior to EAE induction, and consisted of three consecutive trials, in which the animals became familiar with the task. After disease induction, the mice were tested every 2 days, until 25 post-immunization.
Activity Monitor—Open Field
To evaluate the spontaneous locomotor activity, an automatic open-field system consisting of an acrylic box (46 × 46 × 36 cm) with infrared sensors (Activity monitor, Insight, Ribeirão Preto, Brazil) was used. Mice were habituated in the behavioral testing room for at least 30 min. During the tests, the animals were placed in the automatic open-field apparatus for 6 min, with 1 min for habituation and exploration of the arena, and 5 min of locomotor evaluation. The apparatus was cleaned at each behavioral test performed with alcohol 30°, as recommended by the manufacturers. The activities detected were ambulatory movement, distance traveled (mm), and speed (mm/s). The movements are monitored on the x , y , and z -axes, which represent height, width, and depth, respectively.
Neurological State
An eight-point neurological severity score (NSS) was used to measure the general neurological state of mice, according to the scale described by Dutra et al. [ ], with minor modifications. This score mimics the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) that is used in MS patients. Each animal was evaluated for the following parameters: presence of paresis; inability to walk straight; impairment of seeking behavior; absence of a perceptible startle reflex; inability to exit from a 30-cm-diameter circle; and inability to walk on 3-, 2-, and 1-cm-wide beams. If the mouse demonstrated incapacity in one of these parameters quoted above, a value of one was inferred for each trait. The total sum of the values was used as an indicative of neurological impairment. NSS was analyzed 23 days after the first MOG 35-55 administration.
Analysis of Cytokines Production, and Splenomegaly
Levels of TNF, IL-1β, IL-17, IL-23, IL-10, IFN-γ, CCL3, and leptin were evaluated in serum, spleen, spinal cord, and brain, except leptin that was evaluated only in serum. After 25 or 15 (leptin) days of disease induction, the mice were euthanized and the structures were collected and frozen (− 80 °C) for further analysis. Posteriorly, the tissues were homogenized according to the methodology described previously by Fernandes et al. [ ]. Cytokine levels were measured by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) using dual-set ELISA kits, according to the manufacturer’s instructions (R&D Systems; Minneapolis, USA). The results were expressed in picograms per hundred milligrams of tissue or per hundred milliliters of serum. As an additional index of the inflammatory process, the wet weight of each spleen (splenomegaly) was registered and expressed as grams per 25 g of animal body weight.
Histological Analysis
After the euthanasia (25 days post-EAE induction), the brains and the lumbar spinal cords (L1-L6) were fixed in 10% buffered formalin solution for 24 h. After this period, the samples were embedded in paraffin after dehydration. The histological analysis of inflammation and demyelination was performed using hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and luxol fast blue (LFB) staining, respectively. Procedures were performed in 4-μm brain and spinal cord slices. Each HE-stained section was scored for inflammation from 0 to 4: 0, indicated normal; 1, indicated cells infiltrating the meninges; 2, indicated one to four small focal perivascular infiltrates; 3, indicated five or more small infiltrates and/or one or more large infiltrates invading the parenchyma; and 4, indicated extensive cell infiltration involving ≥ 20% of the white matter. [ ]. Demyelination of the brain and spinal cord was scored as described by Rynda et al. (2010) with 0 indicating normal, 1 indicating one small focal area of demyelination, 2 indicating two or three areas, 3 indicating one to two large areas of demyelination, and 4 indicating extensive demyelination involving ≥ 20% of the white matter. [ ],
Immunohistochemistry Assay
The expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1), which are biochemical markers of astrocyte and microglia activation, respectively, was measured by immunohistochemistry. The brain and the lumbar spinal cord (L1-L6) were rapidly excised (at day 25 post-immunization), and immediately fixed in 10% formalin solution for 24 h. The immunopositivity for GFAP or Iba1 was assessed on paraffin tissue sections (4 μm) by using the monoclonal rabbit anti-GFAP (1:250; Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) and monoclonal mouse anti-Iba1/AIF1 (1:300; Cayman Chemicals, Michigan, USA), according to the method previously described [ ]. High-temperature antigen retrieval was performed by immersing the slides in water bath at 98 to 100 °C in Tris/EDTA buffer, pH 9.0 (anti-GFAP) and 10 mM trisodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0 (anti-Iba1), for 40 min. The peroxidase was blocked by incubating the sections with 5% perhidrol for 30 min. The nonspecific protein binding was blocked with 5% milk serum solution for 30 min. After overnight incubation at 4 °C with primary antibodies, the slides were washed with PBS and incubated with the secondary antibody HRP conjugate (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA), ready to use, for 20 min at room temperature. The immune complexes were visualized with 0.5% 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB; Dako Cytomation, Glostrup, Denmark) plus 0.03% H 2 O 2 in PBS. The reaction was stopped by thorough washing with water, and the slides were counterstained with hematoxylin. Images to assess glial activation were examined with a Zeiss AxioImager M2 light microscope (Carl Zeiss, Gottingen, Germany). For each section, two to five images were taken, in order to include most areas of the brain and lumbar spinal cord. The images were captured in × 200 magnification. The number of GFAP-positive astrocytes and Iba1-positive microglia cells/region was quantified in the following anatomical areas of the lumbar spinal cord: right dorsal horn, left dorsal horn, right ventral horn, left ventral horn, and central canal. The analyzed brain areas were cerebral cortex, cerebral nuclei, brain stem (interbrain, thalamus, hypothalamus, midbrain, hindbrain), and cerebellum.
MicroPET Imaging
In order to assess neuroinflammation in the mouse EAE model, the technique of [ 18 F]-FDG microPET imaging was used, as referenced by Radu et al. 2007 [ ]. The animals were randomly divided into five experimental groups: PBS, EAE + vehicle, EAE + CTK 01512-2 (50 pmol/site, i.t.), EAE + ziconotide (50 pmol/site, i.t.), and EAE + fingolimod (0.3 mg/kg, p.o.). Initially, the animals were individually anesthetized using a mixture of isoflurane and medical oxygen (3–4% induction and 2–3% maintenance dose) and [ 18 F]-FDG was injected (250 μCi) through the tail vein. After recovery from anesthesia, the mice remained isolated and conscious for 40 min. Mice were placed in a headfirst prone position and scanned with the Triumph™ microPET (LabPET-4, TriFoil Imaging, Northridge, CA, USA), under isoflurane inhalation. Throughout these procedures, the animals were kept on a pad heated at 36 °C. For 30 min, each animal was scanned with the brain region positioned in the center of the microPET field-of-view (FOV). At the end of the acquisition, mice were returned to their cages until complete recovery and kept under heating to prevent hypothermia. The animals were scanned on days 0, 7, 14, and 23 after the first MOG 35-55 application, totalizing 180 microPET scans. All data were reconstructed using the maximum likelihood estimation method (MLEM-3D) algorithm with 20 iterations. Each reconstructed microPET image was spatially normalized into a [ 18 F]-FDG template using brain normalization in PMOD (version 3.5) and the Fusion Toolbox (PMOD Technologies, Zurich, Switzerland). An MRI mouse brain template was used to overlay the normalized images, previously registered to the microPET image database. The glucose metabolism was expressed as standard uptake values (SUVs) for several brain regions [ ].
Data Analysis
Results are presented as the mean ± standard error mean of 6 to 21 animals per group, depending on the experimental protocol, as specified in each figure. The percentages of inhibition were calculated for every experiment, and in some cases, the area under curve (AUC) was used for this purpose. Statistical comparisons of the data were performed by using one- or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), depending on the experimental protocol, followed by Newman-Keuls or Bonferroni’s post-test. p values < 0.05 were considered significant. All tests and the construction of graphs were performed using the GraphPad Prism® software version 5.01 (San Diego, USA).
Materials
The following drugs and reagents were used: MOG 35-55 peptide (MEVGWYRSPFSRVVHLYRNGK) was purchased from EZBiolab (Carmel, USA). Mycobacterium tuberculosis extract H37RA was obtained from Difco Laboratories (Detroit, USA). Complete Freund’s Adjuvant oil and Pertussis toxin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich® (St. Louis, USA). Giotto Biotech S.r.l. (Sesto Fiorentino, Italy) synthesized the recombinant peptide CTK 01512-2. Ziconotide was purchased from Latoxan (Valence, France). CTK 01512-2 and ziconotide were diluted in PBS and fingolimod was solubilized in distilled water. [ 18 F]-FDG was produced by an on-site cyclotron (PET Trace 16 MeV; GE Medical System) and automated synthesis system (Fastlab GE).
Results
Mechanical and Thermal Hyperalgesia Are Attenuated by CTK 01512-2 and Ziconotide in the Mouse Model of EAE
As it can be seen in Fig. 1 a, b, during the EAE induction phase (days 0–7), there was a significant and long-lasting increase in the response frequency after von Frey filaments application (0.4 g; which represents an innocuous stimulus), in the right hind paw of the mice, indicating the occurrence of mechanical hypersensivity. This process started on day 2, and remained elevated for up to 14 days after the first MOG 35-55 administration (Fig. 1 a). The treatment with CTK 01512-2 or ziconotide (25, 50, and 100 pmol/site), by i.t. route, significantly reduced the mechanical hypersensitivity in animals with EAE, until the 14th day, with inhibitions of 24 ± 3%, 47 ± 11%, and 56 ± 5%; and 20 ± 3%, 46 ± 4%, and 25 ± 6%, respectively, according to the calculated AUC (Fig. 1 b). Of note, CTK 01512-2 produced a characteristic dose-response effect. Conversely, ziconotide showed a U-shaped curve profile. In addition, it was possible to observe that the antinociceptive effect of the recombinant peptide CTK 01512-2 was maintained until the 8th day, even with the treatment onset 4 days before. In contrast, the analgesic effect of ziconotide was diminished (Fig. 1 a). To assess the effect of fingolimod (the drug used in clinics for MS) in mechanical hypernociceptive response, mice were treated from day 7 to day 25, once a day, p.o. Fingolimod (0.3 mg/kg) treatment showed similar results to that obtained with the dose of 25 pmol of both toxins (19 ± 6% of inhibition) (Fig. 1 b). Fig. 1 Antinociceptive effects of CTK 01512-2, ziconotide, and fingolimod in the multiple sclerosis model induced by MOG 35-55 in mice. Effects of treatment with CTK 01512-2, the recombinant form of the peptide Phα1β derived from the spider Phoneutria nigriventer , ziconotide (Zico) from the cone snail Conus magus (25, 50, or 100 pmol/site, dosed at days 4, 10, 15, 20, and 24 post-MOG 35-55 ), by intrathecal (i.t.) route, or fingolimod (0.3 mg/kg, dosed once a day, beginning 7 days after the first MOG 35-55 injection), by oral route (p.o.), on the mechanical ( a and b ) and thermal ( c and d ) hypernociception in the model of MOG 35-55 -evoked experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in C57BL/6 mice. Fingolimod was used as a positive control drug for multiple sclerosis treatment. Mechanical (von Frey filaments) and thermal (hot-plate test) hypersensitivity were assessed before (B baseline) and at the 2nd–14th and 3rd–15th days after onset of first MOG 35-55 administration, respectively. Differences in the mechanical and thermal nociception were determined by one-way analysis of variance, followed by Newman-Keuls or Bonferroni post hoc test. Each column represents the mean and the vertical lines show the standard error mean. The experimental N of each group is provided in graphs a and c . ### p < 0.001 significantly different from naïve values. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001 significantly different from vehicle values. $ p < 0.05 significantly different from ziconotide (100 pmol/site) values. MOG myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein
A separate group of mice was intrathecally treated with CTK 01512-2 or ziconotide to assess the effects on EAE-related thermal hyperalgesia. A reduction in the paw withdrawal latency to heat stimulus was observed at 3 days after MOG 35-55 immunization, as an indicator of thermal hypersensitivity. This effect remained stable until day 15 (Fig. 1 c). When the animals received CTK 01512-2 (50 and 100 pmol/site, i.t.) or ziconotide (50 pmol/site, i.t., p = 0.0927; 100 pmol/site, i.t., p < 0.05), the thermal hyperalgesia was reduced in comparison to the positive control group (vehicle). The percentages of inhibition were 37 ± 6%, 66 ± 3%, and 35 ± 10%, respectively (Fig. 1 d). A comparison of CTK 01512-2 and ziconotide (100 pmol/site, i.t.) effects revealed that CTK 01512-2 showed a superior antinociceptive activity (66 ± 3% versus 34 ± 10%). The treatment with fingolimod showed a tendency to reduce the thermal nociception ( p = 0.0845; Fig. 1 d).
Intrathecal Administration of CTK 01512-2 Improves the Cognitive Deficits Related to EAE
Cognitive impairment can affect up to three-quarters of patients with secondary progressive MS [ ]. Therefore, we investigated whether CTK 01512-2 might improve learning and memory impairment during EAE. Firstly, the short-term spatial memory of mice was evaluated through the object location test. Seven days after EAE induction, the performance in the object location test was significantly impaired, with no difference in the time spent exploring displaced and non-displaced objects (Fig. 2 b). However, mice treated with CTK 01512-2 (50 and 100 pmol/site, i.t., day 4) explored the object replaced in a novel location for a longer time, in relation to the non-displaced object, indicating an increase in the location index when compared to the EAE non-treated control group (vehicle) (Fig. 2 b). The results were similar to the negative control group (naϊve). The percentages of increase of the location index, in comparison to vehicle group, were 84 ± 18% and 60 ± 8%, respectively. The i.t. application of ziconotide (at all the tested doses) failed to alter the cognitive deficits associated to EAE, as it was also observed for fingolimod. As expected, the results depicted in Fig. 2 a did not show any difference in the time of exploration of the objects (training phase). Fig. 2 Effects of treatment with CTK 01512-2, ziconotide (Zico) (25, 50, or 100 pmol/site, dosed at days 4, 10, 15, 20, and 24 post-MOG 35-55 ), by intrathecal (i.t.) route, or fingolimod (0.3 mg/kg, dosed once a day, beginning 7 days after the first MOG 35-55 injection), by oral route (p.o.), on the spatial memory test ( a and b ) and motor coordination ( c and d ) in the model of MOG 35-55 -induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in C57BL/6 mice. Fingolimod was used as a positive control drug for multiple sclerosis treatment. Spatial memory (object location test) and motor coordination (rotarod) were assessed before (training phase; B baseline) and at the 7th and 2nd–24th days after onset of first MOG 35-55 application, respectively. Differences in the object location and rotarod test were determined by one-way analysis of variance, followed by Newman-Keuls or Bonferroni post hoc test. Each point represents the mean and the vertical lines show the standard error mean. The experimental N of each group is provided in the graphs ( a – c ). ### p < 0.001 significantly different from naïve values. ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001 significantly different from vehicle values. $$$ p < 0.001 significantly different from ziconotide values. MOG myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein
The Recombinant Toxin CTK 015012-2 Promotes an Improvement of Motor Coordination from 14 Days After MOG35-55-Induced EAE
Herein, mice treated with CTK 01512-2 (50 pmol/site, i.t., days 4, 10, 15, 20, and 24) or fingolimod (0.3 mg/kg, once daily from day 7) demonstrated a longer permanence time in the rotarod apparatus, when compared to the EAE control group (vehicle). The percentages of increase were 20 ± 4% and 15 ± 3%, respectively (Fig. 2 d). It is worth mentioning that CTK 01512-2 was able to retard the progression of motor alterations in the EAE model, until the 20th day, a sign of great importance in MS. The results observed for CTK 01512-2 were similar to those obtained with the drug used in humans, fingolimod. Alternatively, the N-type VGCC blocker ziconotide failed to improve the locomotor activity of the animals in the three tested doses, when administered on days 4, 10, 15, 20, and 24 after first MOG 35-55 injection. Additionally, our results suggest that animals develop persistent mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia before motor neurological dysfunctions, corroborating previous data by Fairless et al. (2014) and Dutra et al. (2013) [ , ].
CTK 01512-2 Modulates the Progression of Disease, Clinical Symptoms, Body Weight Loss, and Neurological Severity Elicited by EAE in Mice
As previously reported by Alberti et al. (2016) [ ], mice exhibited the clinical symptoms of EAE from day 13–14 after the beginning of the induction protocol, reaching a maximal clinical score on day 17–18 (Fig. 3 a, Supplementary videos 1 and 2 ). In our study, the positive control group (vehicle) did not gain weight during 25 days, with an approximate body weight loss of 1.5 g at day 15 (Supplementary Figure 2A and 2D ). In addition, the levels of leptin (an essential hormone that governs satiety/hunger [ ] and affects proliferation and cytokine production in naïve and memory T cells [ ]) were quantified in serum, 15 days post-EAE induction. MOG 35-55 administration was associated with a marked increase of leptin levels, compared to the negative control group (naïve) (Fig. 3 d). Of high interest, the treatment with CTK 01512-2 (50 pmol/site, i.t.) caused a remarkable and significant inhibition of leptin contents (38 ± 15%; Fig. 3 d). This effect was not observed in ziconotide and fingolimod groups. In this experimental time-point, there was a significant increase in the severity of disease. Fig. 3 Effects of treatment with CTK 01512-2, ziconotide (Zico) (25, 50, or 100 pmol/site, dosed at days 4, 10, 15, 20, and 24 post-MOG 35-55 ), by intrathecal (i.t.) route, or fingolimod (0.3 mg/kg, dosed once a day, beginning 7 days after the first MOG 35-55 injection), by oral route (p.o.), on the clinical score ( a and b ), neurological severity ( c ), and leptin levels ( d ) in the model of MOG 35-55 -induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in C57BL/6 mice. Fingolimod was used as a positive control drug for multiple sclerosis treatment. Clinical score, neurological severity, and leptin levels were evaluated from day 7 to 25, at day 23, or at day 15, respectively, after the first MOG 35-55 injection. Differences in the clinical and neurological scores and leptin levels were determined by one-way analysis of variance, followed by Newman-Keuls or Bonferroni post hoc test. Each point represents the mean and the vertical lines show the standard error mean. The experimental N of each group is provided in the graphs ( a , c , and d ). To show the EAE model reproducibility, we showed ten clinical scores of vehicle-treated mice at onset of chronic phase (day 17). # p < 0.05 and ### p < 0.001 significantly different from naïve values. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001 significantly different from vehicle values. $ p < 0.05 and $$$ p < 0.001 significantly different from ziconotide values. MOG myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein
CTK 01512-2 (25–100 pmol/site) or ziconotide (25–100 pmol/site) was administered i.t. on days 4, 10, 15, 20, and 24 after the first MOG 35-55 injection to test the therapeutic effect on EAE. Interestingly, the treatment with 50 and 100 pmol of CTK 01512-2 prevented the occurrence of symptoms implicated in the progression of EAE, when compared to the vehicle group. Both doses delayed the onset of symptoms and reduced the clinical manifestations of EAE, as it can be seen by calculating the AUC, with inhibitions of 48 ± 6% and 37 ± 5%, respectively (Fig. 3 b). The same protocol of treatment prevented the body weight loss at the 5th, 10th, 15th, 20th, and 25th days, when compared to the vehicle group (Supplementary Figure 2A –F). Nevertheless, ziconotide administration (25–100 pmol/site, i.t.) did not significantly diminish the clinical score or the body weight reduction induced by EAE. The oral daily administration of fingolimod (0.3 mg/kg, from day 7 to day 25) reduced the clinical symptoms associated with the EAE model (55 ± 10%) and delayed the disease progression (Fig. 3 a, b). The animals treated with fingolimod did not display any body weight loss throughout all the evaluation period (Supplementary Figure 2A –F).
Next, mice were evaluated according to the 8-point scale for neurological severity. As illustrated in Fig. 3 c, the administration of MOG 35-55 was associated with an increased neurological severity score, as compared to the negative control group (naϊve), and assessed 23 days after EAE induction. Noteworthy, CTK 01512-2 (50 and 100 pmol/site, i.t., days 4, 10, 15, and 20) prevented EAE-elicited neurological impairment. The inhibition percentages were 33 ± 4% and 31 ± 8%, respectively (Fig. 3 c). The reference drug fingolimod also reduced the neurological severity score (44 ± 8%). In contrast, ziconotide did not change the neurologic severity score, when administered at the doses of 25, 50, and 100 pmol/site, by the i.t. route, on days 4, 10, 15, and 20 after the first MOG 35-55 injection.
Inhibition of Pro-inflammatory Cytokines and Chemokine Production by CTK 01512-2 in the Central Nervous System, as well as at the Systemic Level in the Animal Model of MS
Based on the obtained results, especially regarding the improvement of neurological deficits and clinical signs, the dose of 50 pmol/site of CTK 01512-2 was selected for the biochemical, histological, immunohistochemical, and imaging experiments, to further characterize its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects in the EAE model.
The immunization with MOG 35-55 caused a pronounced increment in the levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, namely TNF, IL-1β, IFN-γ, IL-17, and IL-23 in the brain, spinal cord and spleen (except for IL-23), and the chemokine CCL3 in the spinal cord, 25 days after EAE induction (Figs. 4 and 5 and Supplementary Figures 3 and 4 ). Interestingly, the treatment with CTK 01512-2 (50 pmol/site, i.t., days 4, 10, 15, 20, and 24) significantly reduced the levels of TNF, IL-1β, IFN-γ, IL-17, and IL-23. The values were close to those observed in the negative control group (naϊve), according to the evaluation of the spleen, brain, and spinal cord, except for IL-1β in the spleen, and IL-23 in the brain and spleen. The percentages of inhibition were 83 ± 8%, 60 ± 8%, and 84 ± 9% for TNF; 70 ± 4% and 69 ± 8% for IL-1β; 76 ± 11%, 46 ± 18%, and 76 ± 11% for IFN-γ; 74 ± 12%, 76 ± 8%, and 75 ± 8% for IL-17; and 67 ± 2% for IL-23, respectively. In addition, CTK 01512-2 abolished the elevation of CCL3 levels in the spinal cord (Fig. 5 f). The animals treated with ziconotide (50 pmol/site, i.t., on days 4, 10, 15, 20, and 24) had reduced levels of IL-1β and IL-23 in the CNS, as well as IL-17 production in the spleen, 25 days after MOG 35-55 -elicited EAE.

The treatment with fingolimod, at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg, orally, once a day, from day 7 to day 25, reduced the levels of TNF (spleen and spinal cord), IL-1β (spinal cord), IFN-γ (spleen and brain), IL-17 (spleen and spinal cord), and CCL3 (spinal cord), in the EAE model. This effect occurred in a significant manner, with inhibition percentages of 85 ± 5% and 35 ± 14% for TNF, 40 ± 21% and 46 ± 4% for IL-1β, 81 ± 4% and 60 ± 9% for IFN-γ, 60 ± 9% and 60 ± 12% for IL-17, and 86 ± 6% for CCL3, respectively (Figs. 4 and 5 ; Supplementary Figure 3 and 4 ).
As depicted in Fig. 5 h, EAE induction caused splenomegaly in the positive control group (vehicle), as well as in the ziconotide group (at dose of 50 pmol/site), compared to the naïve group, as assessed by determination of spleen weight, at 25 days post-MOG 35-55 application. The spleen weight was sensitive to fingolimod treatment (0.3 mg/kg), dosed once a day, by oral route, from day 7 to day 25. The recombinant peptide CTK 01512-2 (50 pmol/site) significantly reduced EAE-elicited splenomegaly, reaching values close to those of the naϊve group.
Intrathecal Administration of CTK 01512-2 Increases the Production of the Anti-inflammatory Cytokine IL-10 in the Animal Model of EAE
In the present study, IL-10 levels were analyzed in serum, spleen, brain, and spinal cord, 25 days post-EAE induction. In the Supplementary Figure 3G and Figure 4G , it is possible to observe that there was a reduction in spleen and brain IL-10 levels, when compared to the negative control group (naïve). The pharmacological treatment with CTK 01512-2 (50 pmol/site, i.t., on days 4, 10, 15, 20, and 24) increased IL-10 production in the spleen, brain, and spinal cord in relation to the negative control group (vehicle) (Supplementary 3G , Figure 4G and 5G , respectively). This effect occurred in a significant manner, with a raise percentage of 108 ± 28%, in the spinal cord, when compared to the naïve group (Fig. 5 g). The same was observed in the spleen and spinal cord after fingolimod injection (0.3 mg/kg, p.o., 1× daily, starting at day 7). In contrast, ziconotide administration, at the same dose as CTK 01512-2, was not able to alter IL-10 levels in the EAE model.
CTK 01512-2 Diminished Inflammatory Infiltrate and Demyelination in EAE Mice
Inflammatory infiltration and demyelination were evaluated by HE and LFB staining, respectively. Histopathologic evaluation showed that MOG 35-55 induced a marked increase of inflammatory and demyelination scores in the lumbar spinal cord (2.0 ± 0.5 and 2.4 ± 0.4; Fig. 6 a, b and Fig. 7 a, b) and brain (2.2 ± 0.5 and 2.5 ± 0.4; Figure Supplementary 5A , B and 7E , F), respectively, in EAE mice. Notably, the inflammatory infiltration and demyelination was diminished by CTK 01512-2 administration, at the dose of 50 pmol/site (0.6 ± 0.2 and 0.8 ± 0.3), when compared with the positive control group (vehicle), whereas ziconotide and fingolimod failed to significantly alter this parameter in the lumbar spinal cord tissue. A similar response can be observed for brain tissue (Fig. 7 e, f), except for fingolimod treatment, which reduced the demyelination score (1.0 ± 0.4; Fig. 7 f). Together, these data indicate that MOG 35-55 -induced neuroinflammation might be mediated by inflammatory infiltrate and demyelination, which in turn could be partially reduced with CTK 01512-2 treatment. Fig. 6 Effects of treatment with CTK 01512-2, ziconotide (Zico) (50 pmol/site, dosed at days 4, 10, 15, 20, and 24 days post-MOG 35-55 ), by intrathecal (i.t.) route, or fingolimod (0.3 mg/kg, dosed once a day, beginning 7 days after the first MOG 35-55 injection), by oral route (p.o.), on the following parameters: hematoxylin-eosin (HE, inflammation) staining ( a ), luxol fast blue (LFB, demyelination) staining ( b ), immunohistochemical for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, astrocytic marker) ( c ), and ionized-binding adapter molecule-1 (Iba1, microgila marker) ( d ) in the model of MOG 35-55 -evoked experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in C57BL/6 mice.

Fingolimod was used as a positive control drug for multiple sclerosis treatment. Differences in the inflammatory score, demyelination score, immunostaining for GFAP, and Iba1 were determined by one-way analysis of variance, followed by Newman-Keuls or Bonferroni post hoc test.

CTK 01512-2 Prevents Glial Activation Triggered by MOG35-55
It has been demonstrated that the MS and EAE models trigger glial activation (microglia, astrocyte) in the central nervous system, an effect that leads to the maintenance of the neuroinflammatory process, and consequently the disease progression [ , ]. Here, we assessed whether these effects could be inhibited by the recombinant peptide CTK 01512-2 and ziconotide (50 pmol/site, i.t., 4th, 10th, 15th, 20th, and 24th days post-MOG 35-55 ). The subcutaneous injection of MOG 35-55 caused a significant increase in the levels of the astrocytic activation marker GFAP, and the microglial marker Iba1, in the lumbar cord (Figs. 6c and 7c ) and in the brain (Supplementary Figure 5C and Figure 7G ). CTK 01512-2 significantly prevented the increased activation of glial cells in the mouse lumbar cord (reduction of 65 ± 6% for GFAP, Figure 6c and 7c ) and brain (tendency for GFAP, p = 0.0938, 25 ± 9% for Iba1; Fig. 7 g, h and Supplementary 5C , D). The same was observed for ziconotide and fingolimod (0.3 mg/kg, p.o., once a day, starting day 7 post-MOG 35-55 ) in the lumbar cord for GFAP (Fig. 7 c), or in the brain for Iba-1, except for ziconotide (Fig. 7 h). These results suggest that MOG 35-55 -induced neuroinflammation partly relies on calcium signaling.
Effects of CTK 01512-2 on the Neuroinflammatory Responses Induced by MOG35-55
As demonstrated in Fig. 8 b–g and Supplementary Figure 6 , there was no difference in glucose metabolism among the experimental groups, on days 0, 7, and 14 after MOG 35-55 application, in the following brain structures: striatum, cortex, thalamus, amygdala, cerebellum, superior colliculi, inferior colliculi, midbrain, and cingulate cortex. However, on the 23rd day, there was a marked increase in the [ 18 F]-FDG metabolism in all the analyzed structures, suggesting the occurrence of neuroinflammation. For other studied regions, however, increased [ 18 F]-FDG uptake was also evident on day 7 (hippocampus; Fig. 8 e), and on day 14 (hypothalamus and the brain stem; Supplementary Figure 6B and Figure 8F ). Interestingly, the treatment with CTK 01512-2 (50 pmol/site, i.t., days 4, 10, 15, and 20) significantly reduced the neuroinflammatory process in all the evaluated brain regions, except for the hippocampus, 23 days after the first MOG 35-55 injection. The same results were observed for the reference drug fingolimod (0.3 mg/kg, p.o., once a day, from day 7), except for the striatum and the cingulate cortex. Ziconotide, at a dose of 50 pmol/site, was able to attenuate the [ 18 F]-FDG uptake in the superior colliculi and the cingulate cortex in the EAE model (Supplementary Figure 6C and 6F ). Together, these results suggest that calcium-mediated neuroinflammation contributes to the increased glucose consumption induced by MOG 35-55 in the brain. Fig. 8 Intrathecal CTK 01512-2 reduces the [ 18 F]-FDG hypermetabolism associated with MOG 35-55 -induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice.

CTK 01512-2 Through the Systemic Administration Decreases the Symptoms Evoked by MOG35-55 in EAE Mice
Thinking translationally in a potential treatment with greater adherence by MS patients, we decided to administer the toxin CTK 01512-2 through the intravenous route (i.v.) in the EAE-affected mice. As shown in Fig. 9 and Supplementary Figure 7 and 8 , MOG 35-55 induced a marked increase in mechanical and thermal nociception, clinical score, spleen wet weight, with a reduction of the spatial memory, motor coordination, locomotor activity, and body weight in the EAE model. Notably, CTK 01512-2, when applied by the systemic route, at the dose of 0.2 mg/kg, every 3 days, starting on day 7 post-MOG 35-55 injection, reduced all behavioral and non-behavioral parameters mentioned above, showing a similar efficacy when compared to the i.t. application. Interestingly, these effects were not observed in mice treated with ziconotide at the same dose and therapeutic scheme, except for the distance traveled in the open-field arena. Fingolimod demonstrated similar results to those presented at the beginning of the study. These results suggest that mice systemically treated with CTK 01512-2 have a significant reduction of the symptoms observed in the animal model of MS. The percentages of inhibition for this experimental set are provided in the Supplementary Table 1 . Fig. 9 Systemic treatment with CTK 01512-2 reduces the symptoms caused by experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model in mice.

Discussion
Several cellular and molecular mechanisms contribute to the neuroinflammatory process in MS. CNS calcium dysregulation has been implicated in reduced neuronal viability, with the activation of glial (especially microglia and astrocytes) and T cells. In turn, massive cytokine production is triggered, and the consequent oligodendrocyte death leads to demyelination and oxidative stress, hence promoting neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration [ , , ]. In this study, we show for the first time that the recombinant peptide CTK 01512-2 is capable of modulating several of these events. The treatment with CTK 01512-2 attenuated the MS-like clinical symptoms in the mouse model of MOG 35-55 -evoked EAE, which was mirrored by histopathological, biochemical, and neuroimaging evaluation. This study further confirms the relevance of VGCC in MS, pointing out CTK 01512-2 as a potential therapeutic alternative for neuroinflammatory diseases.
Chronic pain affects the majority of MS patients, with a significant interference in the life quality of the affected individuals. It was previously shown that MOG 35-55 injection in mice leads to significant alterations in nociception signaling [ , ]. Notably, we demonstrated that both N-type VGCC blockers, ziconotide and CTK 01512-2, were able to reduce the mechanical and thermal allodynia in the EAE model. Of note, CTK 01512-2 produced a characteristic dose-response effect, displaying a long-lasting action when compared to ziconotide, at the three tested doses. Accordingly, the analgesic effects of CTK 01512-2 remained significant on day 8 (when dosed on day 4), whereas the effects of ziconotide ceased, as assessed by the von Frey test. Indeed, a previous study from our group showed that treatment with the native form of CTK 01512-2 (Phα1β) prevented trypsin-induced scratching behavior for up to 12 h, whereas ziconotide application displayed anti-pruritus effects with a maximal duration of 4 h [ ]. Moreover, the analgesic effects of Phα1β or CTK 01512-2 had already been demonstrated in several animal models of pain, including the acute pain induced by capsaicin [ ], hemorrhagic cystitis [ ], visceral nociception [ ], and cancer pain [ ]. VGCCs play an important role in pain development through the release of excitatory neurotransmitters (glutamate, substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide), calcium-dependent enzyme activation (mitogen-activated protein kinase), and modulation of nociceptor gene expression [ ]. This study provides novel evidence showing the analgesic activity of CTK 01512-2 and ziconotide in the neuroinflammatory-related nociception in the EAE model.
Inflammatory infiltrate and demyelination are common findings in the brain and spinal cord of MS patients, being associated with motor impairment, cognitive deficits, and neurological disability [ , ]. In the present study, we demonstrated that EAE-affected mice developed the symptoms mentioned above after MOG 35-55 application, as indicated by the rotarod test and the spatial memory paradigm, in addition to the clinical and neurological severity scores. Importantly, these parameters were accompanied by an increase in inflammatory infiltrate and axonal damage (demyelination) in the CNS parenchyma. The treatment with CTK 01512-2 prevented neuroinflammation and axonal loss, promoting an improvement of motor coordination, cognition, and clinical course of MOG 35-55 -evoked EAE. These results were not observed with ziconotide treatment. Therefore, CTK 01512-2 might have another pharmacological target, in addition to the N-type VGCC. A recent study conducted by Palhares and colleagues showed that Phα1β peptide potentiated by 15-fold the antinociceptive action of the TRP vanilloid 1 blocker SB366791, in a model of acute pain induced by capsaicin [ ]. Moreover, Phα1β and CTK 01512-2 selectively inhibited calcium responses and currents induced by the TRPA1 agonist, allyl isothiocyanate, in dorsal root ganglion neurons, human fetal lung fibroblasts (IMR90), or HEK293 cells expressing the human TRPA1 [ ]. It is tempting to suggest that beneficial effects of CTK 01512-2 in the EAE model are related to the inhibition of calcium influx, likely via N-type VGCC and TRPA1 modulation. Accordingly, Schampel et al. demonstrated that calcium signaling inhibition by nimodipine, a selective L-type VGCC blocker, also promoted favorable effects in a mouse model of MS [ ].
It is well recognized that some MS patients might lose weight during disease progression, although the mechanisms underlying this response are not completely understood [ ]. Herein, we observed that 15 days after the first MOG 35-55 administration, mice had a significant body weight loss. Thereby, we investigated whether the serum levels of leptin (a mediator of long-term regulation of energy balance that suppresses food intake) were altered. We showed that MOG 35-55 administration significantly increased the production of leptin in serum of vehicle-treated mice. Curiously, the animals treated with CTK 01512-2 had a reduction in leptin levels, and consequently they did not lose weight over the EAE model course. This was not observed in animals treated with ziconotide, or even with the clinically used drug fingolimod. Interestingly, the risk of MS and its severity has been correlated to gene polymorphisms of leptin and leptin receptor, besides altered leptin levels [ ]. Added to that, leptin affects in vitro proliferation and cytokine production in naïve and memory T cells [ ], which might partly explain the onset of the neuroinflammatory process and the motor-related severity in EAE mice, at 14–15 days after MOG 35-55 injection. Nevertheless, this study provides compelling evidence that the recombinant peptide CTK 01512-2 is able to modulate the leptin secretion in the mouse model of MS.
In chronic inflammatory diseases, such as MS, leukocytes that invade the CNS are a major source of inflammatory mediators, including cytokines. EAE is the prototypical animal model for neuroinflammation initiated by tissue-invading leukocytes as seen in MS [ ]. Herein, we have documented a significant increase in the levels of several pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF, IL-1β, IFN-γ, IL-17, IL-23, and CCL3 in the brain and spinal cord of MOG 35-55 -treated mice. In a secondary lymphoid organ as the spleen, cytokine production was similar to that observed in the CNS, except for IL-23 and CCL3, suggesting that the inflammatory process at the peripheral level is maintained for up to 25 days after MOG 35-55 injection, which might be an important source of autoreactive T lymphocytes in this model. In contrast, no changes were observed in the serum. Importantly, the treatment with the recombinant peptide CTK 01512-2, given by i.t. route, reduced all the pro-inflammatory cytokines mentioned above in the brain and spinal cord after 25 days of EAE induction. Conversely, ziconotide treatment was not effective in reducing the majority of these inflammatory mediators. Fingolimod partially reduced these parameters. In addition to the decrease of pro-inflammatory cytokines in CNS, mice treated with CTK 01512-2 displayed an increased production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Previously, we have shown that Phα1β, the native form of CTK 01512-2, led to an increase of IL-10 production in the mouse model of hemorrhagic cystitis elicited by cyclophosphamide [ ]. Importantly, IL-10 serum levels showed a negative correlation with the EDSS score and IL-10 seems to be effective in mouse models of virus-induced demyelination [ , ].
In MS patients, the destruction of myelin sheath and/or oligodendrocytes in the CNS is associated with microglia activation [ ]. Additionally, astrogliosis is one of MS pathological hallmarks [ ]. Herein, we showed that treatment of mice with MOG 35-55 led to a significant increase of microglia and astrocyte activation, as indicated by a raise of GFAP and Iba1 immunoreactivity in the CNS, after 25 days. Moreover, we showed that treatment with either ziconotide or CTK 01512-2 reduced GFAP immunostaining in the spinal cord of MOG 35-55 -treated animals, suggesting that N-type VGCC activates astrocytic cells, thus contributing to the neuroinflammatory process induced by MOG 35-55 in the present experimental paradigm. Regarding the Iba1-positive microglia, this process does not appear to depend exclusively on the N-type VGCC activation, since CTK 01512-2-treated animals showed a marked and significant inhibition of Iba-1 immunopositivity in the brain, while ziconotide treatment failed to alter this parameter. Again, it is tempting to propose the relevance of TRPV1/TRPA1-related calcium influx in the effects of CTK 01512-2 against neuroinflammation. Altogether, the present findings suggest that CTK 01512-2 acts by decreasing the presence of glial cells (astrocytes and microglia) in the CNS, promoting neuroprotective effects, mainly related to protection towards axonal damage, in EAE-affected mice. Indeed, the L-type VGCC blocker nimodipine was able to induce microglia-specific apoptosis in the EAE model evoked by PLP-MBP [ ], corroborating our data on the relevance of calcium signaling in experimental MS.
CNS inflammatory lesions in the EAE model might be visualized in vivo using [ 18 F]-FDG microPET-based imaging, in a non-invasive manner [ ]. To further investigate the neuroinflammatory process along the EAE model, we performed a longitudinal evaluation of [ 18 F]-FDG brain uptake on days 7, 14, and 23, after the first MOG 35-55 administration. As expected, there was no significant difference in [ 18 F]-FDG uptake among the experimental groups at day 0 (before EAE induction). Histopathological changes, demyelination, cytokine production, and glial activation induced by MOG 35-55 were associated with increased [ 18 F]-FDG uptake, as evaluated in 12 brain structures at 23 days, thus supporting the presence of neuroinflammatory lesions in the EAE model used herein. Conversely, on days 7 and 14, no difference was visualized in the analyzed brain regions, except for the hippocampus, brain stem, and hypothalamus. Indeed, comparable results showing EAE-related neuroinflammation, by employing microPET imaging, were observed in the spinal cord of rats and mice [ , ]. In addition, our data showed that treatment with CTK 01512-2 significantly attenuated the glucose hypermetabolism in all brain regions, except for the hippocampus, 23 days after MOG 35-55 injection. A similar efficacy was observed for the positive control drug for MS treatment, fingolimod. This study provides compelling evidence indicating the effectiveness of the recombinant peptide CTK 01512-2, given by i.t. route, in the neuroinflammatory processes related to MS.
Next, we examined to what extent CTK 01512-2 might prevent MS-related pathological changes when administered systemically. We showed that i.v. treatment with CTK 01512-2 markedly prevented the parameters of nociception, impaired locomotion and movement, cognition, and clinical scores, besides body and spleen weight, in the mouse model of EAE. Conversely, the i.v. administration of ziconotide showed inhibitory effects only on the nociceptive behavior elicited by EAE induction. A recent study conducted by Thell and cols. demonstrated that the nature-derived cyclic peptide kalata B1, when given orally, prevented disease progression in the EAE model. This oral activity was possible due to the presence of cysteine residues in the compound, which in turn confers intrinsic stability to resist to chemical, enzymatic, and thermal degradation [ ]. It is important to report that the CTK 01512-2 recombinant peptide has 11 cysteine residues in its structure, in a total of 55 amino acids, which might partially explain the stability and beneficial effects of this compound, when dosed by i.v. route in the EAE model. Additionally, the i.v. route increases the attractiveness of this molecule as a promising alternative for the treatment of MS.
Altogether, our present results revealed that spinal administration of the calcium channel blocker CTK 01512-2 consistently inhibited the symptoms evoked by MOG 35-55 in mice, probably by reducing the inflammatory infiltrate, demyelination, leptin levels, the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, astrocytic and microglial activation, and brain glucose hypermetabolism, associated with an increase of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 (Fig. 10 ). These beneficial effects of CTK 01512-2 were superior to the drug used in clinics for MS, namely fingolimod, in important parameters, such as nociception, spatial memory, IL-10 production, leptin secretion, inflammatory score, and spinal cord demyelination. Moreover, splenomegaly and EAE symptoms were attenuated by the systemic administration CTK 01512-2, with a higher efficacy in most evaluated parameters, when compared to fingolimod. Thus, we suggest that in a near future, CTK 01512-2 might well be used in combination with current MS therapies, as an innovative strategy for relapsing-remitting and progressive MS form. Finally, these results confirm and extend the idea that calcium influx is an important event in MOG 35-55 -induced EAE, and seems to be crucial to neuronal and axonal damage, a remarkable event in MS. Fig. 10 Schematic representation of the neuroinflammatory responses in MOG 35-55 -induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice, and the effects of spinal or systemic treatment with recombinant peptide CTK 01512-2, ziconotide, or fingolimod (orally). (1) Subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of MOG 35-55 /CFA plus Pertussis toxin/PBS (intraperitoneally, i.p.) induces peripheral autoreactive T cells in lymphoid organs. After, blood-brain barrier disruption is necessary to (2) immune cell infiltration into the central nervous system (CNS), in which autoreactive T cells acquire the ability to expand clonally. (3) The white blood cell migration stimulates the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF, IL-1β, IFN-γ, IL-17, IL-23, and CCL3. (4) Consequently, these inflammatory mediators increase glial activation (gliosis), including astrocyte and microglia cells. Together, the inflammatory microenvironment promotes (3) axonal damage, leading to CNS demyelination. Oppositely, the blockage of N-type VGCC and/or TRPA1 (?) by CTK 01512-2 diminishes the (5) inflammatory infiltrate, demyelination, leptin levels, the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, astrocytic and microglial activation, and brain glucose metabolism, associated with an increase of the (6) anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. CTK 01512-2 effects were mirrored by a reduction of EAE-elicited MS-like symptoms and signals in female C57BL/6 mice. Treatment with the selective N-type VGCC blocker ziconotide failed to attenuate the neuroinflammatory processes. Fingolimod, an antagonist of sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor (S1RP), which inhibits T cell egress, reduced partially these signals and symptoms related to EAE.
