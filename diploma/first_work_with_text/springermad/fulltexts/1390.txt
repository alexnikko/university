Introduction
Canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) is a chronic systemic zoonotic disease caused by the protozoan Leishmania infantum and transmitted by the female phlebotomines Lutzomyia longipalpis and L. cruzi . The formation and deposition of CVL immunocomplexes cause glomerulonephritis and tubulointerstitial injuries. These changes are responsible for the onset of proteinuria, changes in urinary sediment, and loss of renal function (Martinelli et al. ; Abranches et al. ; Baneth et al. ). Measurement of serum urea and serum creatinine (SCr) may be influenced by several factors unrelated to the rate of glomerular filtration, such as muscle mass, age range, and diet, which may hamper the interpretation of results. Many human patients and dogs with visceral leishmaniasis (VL) may also present cachexia, which can decrease SCr levels, leading to false-negative results (Randers and Erlandsen ; Elshafie et al. ).
Urea and creatinine are not sufficiently sensitive for the early diagnosis of kidney disease. The detection of kidney disease in early stages allows rapid intervention, slowing the progression of the disease and therefore improving the expectation of life. Finding new markers to establish an early and accurate diagnosis of asymptomatic kidney disease is thus necessary (Palacio et al. ; García-Martínez et al. ). Cystatin C is freely filtered in the kidney through the glomeruli, reabsorbed, and catabolized in the proximal renal tubules (Randers and Erlandsen ; Antognoni et al. ). Several studies of renal function in dogs and human patients have confirmed the importance of cystatin C for assessing the rate glomerular filtration (Almy et al. ; Antognoni et al. ). Elshafie et al. ( ) demonstrated highly elevated serum levels of cystatin C in human patients with acute form of visceral leishmaniasis.
Urinary gamma-glutamyltransferase (uGGT) has been considered an early marker of tubular injury, which is formed on the brush borders of the epithelial cells of the proximal contorted tubules of nephrons, and levels two- to threefold above baseline indicate injury to the tubular epithelium (Grauer ). The uGGT/urinary creatinine ratio (uCR) mimics the excretion of uGGT over a 24-h period, and the test adjusts the uGGT fluctuations that are influenced by urine flow (Rivers et al. ). The median uGGT/uCR in 39 dogs with VL is significantly higher in dogs with proteinuria of tubular origin, with values seven times higher than those with only glomerular proteinuria. uGGT/uCR can therefore be useful for identifying proteinuria of tubular origin in dogs with leishmaniasis (Ibba et al. ).
Doppler examination of the renal artery evaluates blood flow and provides data on arterial resistivity by measuring the resistive index (RI). Increases in renal arterial resistive index (RARI) may be the first indication of impairment of renal function; this index can also be used to monitor the progression or regression of previously diagnosed nephropathies (Novellas et al. ).
In the present study, we used dogs with VL and with varying degrees of renal damage as a model of renal injury to evaluate whether serum and urinary biomarkers (cystatin C, urinary GGT, and uGGT/uCR) and RARI are earlier than creatinine for the diagnosis of chronic kidney disease. Such research could thus contribute substantially to the early diagnosis of renal disease and the therapeutic management of nephropathies, considering the nephrotoxicity of the drugs used in VL therapy. Methodologies could also be validated for other species, especially humans due to the similarity of the problems.
Material and methods
The study was conducted in the small-animal medical clinic of the Veterinary Hospital of the Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul. We tested 59 untreated dogs naturally infected with Leishmania infantum . The research project was initiated after approval by the Animal Ethics Committee of the Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul (Protocol No. 679/2015).
The criteria for inclusion/exclusion of the dogs were the diagnosis of VL confirmed by the observation of amastigote forms on cytological examination, obtained by aspiration of lymph nodes and/or bone marrow. All dogs with diagnosis of VL were submitted to molecular tests for Ehrlichia canis and Leptospira sp. For the first agent, nested PCR of whole blood was performed according to the methodology described by Wen et al. ( ) and for the second agent, standard PCR of whole blood and urine samples was performed according to the technique described by Merien et al. ( ). Animals positive for E. canis and Leptospira sp. were excluded from the study.
A urinalysis, UP/C and SCr concentrations, was performed, and animals with proteinuria of post-renal origin were excluded from the study, as well as animals with a history of previous diseases, anesthetic, and surgical procedures and dogs with previous renal disease (acute or chronic), renal lithiasis, and a history of previous use of diuretics and nephrotoxic drugs.
The animals were distributed into groups based on the degree of proteinuria and the presence or absence of azotemia. The dogs were classified into the following groups (G) based on their SCr concentrations and UP/C: G1 ( n = 15), dogs with SCr < 1.4 mg/dL and UP/C < 0.5; G2 ( n = 13), dogs with SCr < 1.4 mg/dL and UP/C of 0.5–1.0; G3 ( n = 16), dogs with SCr < 1.4 mg/dL and UP/C > 1.0; and G4 ( n = 15), dogs with SCr > 1.4 mg/dL. A fifth group of healthy dogs ( n = 10) was the control.
Peripheral blood for the laboratory tests was obtained by jugular venipuncture. SCr levels were measured using an automatic biochemical analyzer (Cobas® C 111, Roche Diagnostic Ltda, Mannheim, Germany). Commercial reagents were used for each metabolite analyzed, based on system standards. The ACREj2® kit (Roche Diagnostics Ltda) was used for measuring creatinine. The cystatin C was measured by automated nephelometry using an N Latex Cystatin C reagent kit (Dade Behring, Deerfield, USA).
Urine samples were obtained by cystocentesis or transurethral bladder catheterization with a sterile disposable urethral catheter (Mark Med® Ltda, São Paulo, Brazil). A subsample of urine was submitted to urinalysis, and a second subsample was stored at − 20 °C for PCR analysis to diagnose leptospirosis. uGGT was measured using a semi-automatic spectrophotometer (Spectrum®, Celer Biotecnologia SA, Belo Horizonte, Brazil) and a commercial GGT reagent (Gold Analisa, Belo Horizonte, Brazil); the concentrations were calculated using the formula proposed by De Schepper et al. ( ). uCr was measured by the Cobas® C 111 analyzer. Urinary protein concentration was measured colorimetrically using pyrogallol red using a semi-automatic spectrophotometer (Spectrum®, Celer Biotecnologia SA). A commercial proteinuria reagent (Proteinuria PP, Gold Analisa) was used to measure urinary protein. Protein and uCr concentrations were calculated as follows: UP/C = total protein (mg/dL)/uCr (mg/dL). uGGT/uCR was calculated as follows: uGGT/uCR = uGGT (IU/L)/uCr (mg/dL).
Ultrasound real-time images and color flow maps were obtained using a 5/6 convex array and a 5/8 transducer with a pulsed wave Doppler scanner (Mylab® 30 Vet Gold, Biosound Esaote Inc., Indianapolis, USA). Three consecutive spectral waves were obtained by pulsed Doppler wave for further RI measurement using the software of the ultrasound device (Fig. 1 ) (Novellas et al. ; Bigé et al. ). The means for the three waves for each region were used for the statistical evaluation.

A Lilliefors test was used to examine the normality of the variables. An analysis of variance was chosen for testing normally distributed parametric variables (uGGT and uGGT/uCR), and a Kruskal-Wallis test was used for testing the variables that were not normally distributed (cystatin C, right RARI, and left RARI). The Tukey, Bonferroni, and Dunn post hoc tests were used for multiple comparisons. The Spearman correlation test was used to assess the relationships between the variables. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. Statistical analyses used BioEstat 5.0 (Ayres et al. ).
Results
The mean serum concentration of cystatin C was higher in G4 than the other groups ( p < 0.05) and the control (Table 1 ). Hypercystatinemia was observed in only 8 (13%) of 59 dogs with visceral leishmaniasis; the upper limit of reference considered was 1.3 mg/L (Braun et al. ).

Mean and median concentrations, standard deviations, and coefficients of variation of uGGT and uGGT/uCR are presented in Table 1 . The mean uGGT concentrations were significantly higher in G3 and G4 than G1 and the control ( p < 0.05) and in G2 than the control ( p < 0.05). The mean uGGT/uCR was significantly higher in the groups of dogs with azotemia and proteinuria than the group of healthy and non-proteinuric dogs ( p < 0.05).
uGGT concentration was higher in16 of the 59 dogs (27%); enzymuria was observed in 2 of 13 dogs (15%) in G2, 6 of 16 dogs (37%) in G3, and 8 of 15 dogs (53%) in G4. We considered the increase in enzyme levels for dogs that presented uGGT values higher than 92 IU/L (De schepper et al. ).
Forty of the 59 dogs (67%) had a high uGGT/uCR. The ratios were above the reference range for 1 of 15 dogs (6.66%) in G1, 11 of 13 dogs (84.61%) in G2, 13 of 16 dogs (81.25%) in G3 dogs, and 15 of 15 dogs (100%) in G4. According to Gossett et al. ( ), the values < 0.42 of uGGT/uCR are considered normal.
Table 1 shows the measures of central tendency of RI for the right renal arteries in all groups. RI, however, differed significantly only between G4 and the control ( p < 0.05). RARI for the right renal artery (RRARI) was high for 29 of the 59 dogs (49.15%). RRARI was high for 6 of 15 dogs (40%) in G1, 2 of 13 dogs (15.38%) in G2, 8 of 16 dogs (50%) in G3, and 13 of 15 dogs (86.66%) in G4. Dogs with RI values of the renal arteries less than 0.7 were considered normal (Rivers et al. ).
In the present study, we found a moderate correlation between cystatin C and creatinine ( r = 0.69; p < 0.001) and between cystatin C and UP/C ( r = 0.67; p < 0.001); however, when we correlated cystatin C with uGGT ( r = 0.47; p < 0.001) and cystatin C with uGGT/uCR ( r = 0.42; p < 0.01) and cystatin C with RRARI ( r = 0.37; p < 0.01), we noticed a poor correlation (Table 2 ). We also observe weak correlations between RRARI and uGGT ( r = 0.3; p < 0.05) and between RRARI and uGGT/uCR ( r = 0.4; p < 0.05), and we found moderate correlations between UP/C and uGGT ( r = 0.5; p < 0.001) and between UP/C and uGGT/uCR ( r = 0.52; p < 0.001) (Table 2 ).

Discussion
In the present study, the stratification of groups of dogs with VL was based on serum creatinine values and whether or not proteinuria occurred. In order to stratify the groups of infected dogs, it was preferred to use creatinine instead of urea as an indicator of renal function, since the latter could be influenced by factors of non-renal origin, such as protein intake and gastroenteritis (Randers and Erlandsen ). The results of the present study demonstrated increases in uGGT and uGGT/uCR activity before the onset of azotemia and that IRAR assessment and sequential measurement of serum cystatin C may be useful when monitoring the progression of the disease in dogs with VL.
We demonstrated that serum cystatin C concentrations were significantly higher in G4 (1.34 ± 0.48 mg/L) than the other groups, similar to the findings by Antognoni et al. ( ), who also reported significantly higher concentrations of serum cystatin C only in azotemic dogs with VL; however, the animals in this study had different diseases and were not stratified by the degree of renal injury.
We verified that G3 (0.49 ± 0.27 mg/L) showed higher serum cystatin C concentration than the control group. In this way, we can infer that serum cystatin C increased with the worsening of renal disease and that this marker may be useful when it is desired to verify the decrease in glomerular filtration rate. The study also found that the mean cystatin C concentration tended to increase with the severity of renal disease. Unlike other studies, we stratified the groups of dogs with VL by the degree of renal impairment, but we did not find a higher precocity of cystatin C relative to SCr for the diagnosis of renal disease.
Wehner et al. ( ) reported that the best alternative was to associate the SCr and cystatin C dosages, because they observed a higher sensitivity of cystatin C relative to creatinine and a higher specificity of creatinine compared to cystatin C. In this study, the authors used exogenous creatinine plasma clearance (ECPC) as a gold standard to evaluate GFR, and the correlation between cystatin C and ECPC was stronger than the correlation between SCr and ECPC. Considering that ECPC is not commonly used as a routine practice and also the results obtained in the present study, we can infer that cystatin C may be useful to the veterinarian to monitor the rate of glomerular filtration, especially in non-azotemic dogs, with VL, diabetes mellitus, hyperadrenocorticism, or receiving nephrotoxic drugs.
In our study, enzymuria appears before the onset of azotemia in dogs with VL. Grauer ( ) reported that increases in uGGT two to threefold over the baseline indicated clinically relevant tubular injury. These findings corroborate those of our study, in which uGGT concentrations were significantly higher in infected dogs in proportion to the severity of the nephropathy. We observed increases in uGGT activity according to the magnitude of proteinuria; dogs with VL often show glomerulonephritis, proteinuria, and progressive loss of renal function, so our research demonstrates that proteinuria contributes to the progression of nephropathy, allowing the clinician to identify and control chronic proteinuria.
Ibba et al. ( ) stated that the presence of tubular components in the urine was indicative of the progression of renal disease, in agreement with our findings, where uGGT/uCR was higher in more advanced renal disease. It is also worth mentioning that the dosage of UP/C, uGGT, and uGGT/uCR is a simple and low-cost procedure. In the study by Ibba et al. ( ), the authors identified tubular proteinuria using electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate and agarose gel, which has a higher cost and is easily not performed in any laboratory.
Greco et al. ( ) stated that uGGT could be used to monitor patients receiving nephrotoxic drugs. Most of the drugs used to treat leishmaniasis are highly nephrotoxic, so our results suggest that measurements of uGGT and uGGT/uCR could help clinicians to identify tubulopathies, before and after leishmanicide therapy.
RARI was significantly higher only in G4 (0.76 ± 0.06), suggesting that RARI could not be used to diagnose early renal disease in dogs with VL. Ikee et al. ( ) reported that the initial evolution of renal disease produced adaptive and compensatory alterations that helped to prevent the increase in RARI, as in G2 (0.67 ± 0.08) and G3 (0.7 ± 0.08) in our study, and that the area of the vessel and interstitial fibrosis would be responsible for the increase in RARI with maintenance of the lesion and evolution to chronic kidney disease, as in G4 in our study. Morrow et al. ( ) found that animals with glomerulopathies had normal RIs and that RI increased in patients with tubular and interstitial lesions. RARI is strongly influenced by the location of the lesion with in the renal parenchyma (Platt et al. ). Pathologies in the tubulointerstitial region (acute tubular lesion, interstitial nephritis) and/or vasculitis usually increase RI. Glomerulonephritis is the most common renal lesion in CVL (Baneth et al. ), so a significantly higher mean can only be justified for G4 (0.76 ± 0.06). RARI did not differ significantly between G1 (0.68 ± 0.09), G2 (0.67 ± 0.08), G3 (0.7 ± 0.08), and the control (0.61 ± 0.08), suggesting that strictly, glomerular diseases may evolve and affect interstitial, tubules, and blood vessels and thereby increase RARI. RARI is thus not a good indicator for the early diagnosis of glomerular disease in dogs with VL but can be used to evaluate the progression of renal disease.
UP/C and serum cystatin C were positively and significantly correlated ( r = 0.67; p < 0.0001). This correlation may have been due to the glomerular injury that resulted in proteinuria, verified by UP/C, and to a decrease in glomerular filtration that elicited increases in serum cystatin C. Chew et al. ( ) reported that a decline of renal function and therefore the rate of glomerular filtration activated adaptive mechanisms, which increased filtration, and that the increase in intraglomerular pressure favored the appearance of proteinuria. Antognoni et al. ( ) reported positive correlations between serum cystatin C and creatinine and between serum urea and phosphorus. We also found to strong correlations between serum cystatin C and creatinine ( r = 0.69; p < 0.0001) and between uGGT ( r = 0.47; p < 0.0001) and uGGT/uCR ( r = 0.42; p < 0.0001). We also found positive and significant correlations of uGGT and uGGT/uCR with UP/C ( r = 0.50; p < 0.0001, and r = 0.52; p < 0.0001). These findings suggest that glomerular damage allows the filtration of proteins, causing proteinuria that would damage the renal tubular epithelium, indicated by higher uGGT and uGGT/uCR. The correlations suggest that the reduction in renal excretory function is associated with an increase in proteinuria and with the onset of tubulopathy, supporting the importance of evaluating UP/C and enzymuria in dogs with VL, even if they have normal renal excretory function.
We found weak significant correlations between RARI and uGGT ( r = 0.32; p < 0.005) and between RARI and uGGT/uCR ( r = 0.40; p < 0.005). These results suggest that an increase in RARI in dogs with VL may indicate tubular injuries, emphasizing the importance of the evaluation of enzymuria in these patients. Our results were similar to those by Morrow et al. ( ), who observed higher RARIs in dogs with tubular and interstitial injuries. We also found weak positive correlations between RARI and creatinine and between RARI and cystatin C, in contrast to those obtained by Rivers et al. ( ), who found no correlation between RARI and creatinine in dogs and cats with renal injury. These authors, however, investigated RARI in animals with acute renal injury, but we studied dogs that commonly have glomerulonephritis and are often submitted to clinical examination with chronic kidney disease.
The research collaborated to support new proposals for the diagnosis of nephropathies in dogs with VL and also to reduce the existing gap in the literature on this area. In this way, the research contributed to highlight the importance of early detection of renal disease in dogs with VL, with the intention of preventing the progression to more advanced stages, allowing greater chances of success in therapy and therapeutic adjustments according to the degree of renal damage. The assessment of renal function after the end of a treatment protocol would also be relevant for future studies in order to understand whether or not renal function is altered by the different drugs used in CVL therapy. In addition, the reference values of cystatin C, uGGT, and uGGT/uCR mentioned in the literature have a high discrepancy. However, new research with more dogs is indispensable and with different diseases.
Conclusions
The results obtained under the conditions of the present study allow us to conclude that (1) the measurement of serum cystatin C does not enable the early identification of renal disease, but cystatin C is useful for monitoring the progression of renal disease in dogs with VL, (2) uGGT and uGGT/uCR are more precocious than traditional analytes for detecting the presence of renal disease in dogs with VL, and (3) the measurement of RARI does not detect the presence of renal disease before the appearance of proteinuria and azotemia in dogs with VL.
