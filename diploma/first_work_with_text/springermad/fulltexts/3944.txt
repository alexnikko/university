Introduction
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic demyelinating disease in which the nerve cells of the brain and spinal cord are damaged. This damage disrupts the ability of parts of the nervous system to communicate, resulting in a range of signs and symptoms, including physical, mental, and sometimes psychiatric problems. The disease onset typically occurs between the ages of 20 and 40 years and is more common in women than in men [ ].
Natalizumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the alpha-4 subunit of the α 4 β 1 and α 4 β 7 integrin on mononuclear leukocytes, is approved for the treatment of MS. Increased lymphocyte trafficking into brain parenchyma is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of MS. Binding of natalizumab to its target, the alpha-4 receptor, reduces immune cell migration into the brain, thereby decreasing disease activity as measured by gadolinium-enhancing (Gd) lesion count and annualized relapse rate (ARR) [ , , ].
In a phase 2 study (AN100226-231), intravenous (IV) dosing regimens of 3 or 6 mg/kg (corresponding to flat doses of 144.0 or 594.6 mg, respectively) given every 4 weeks (q4w) for up to 6 months were evaluated in MS subjects [ ]. The dose of 6 mg/kg was found to be more efficacious than the 3 mg/kg dose, associated with greater reductions in new Gd lesions and total relapses across MS subjects [ ]. In two phase 3 studies (C-1801 and C-1802), a fixed 300-mg IV dose given q4w for up to 24 months was evaluated and found efficacious relative to placebo and interferon β-1a, respectively [ , ]. A monotherapy phase 3 study (C-1801) at 1 year demonstrated that natalizumab reduced the risk of relapse by 68% and resulted in 92% fewer Gd lesions compared with placebo [ ]. In the postmarketing REFINE study (101 MS-206), doses of 150 and 300 mg natalizumab administered either IV or subcutaneously (SC) once every 12 weeks (q12w) were evaluated along with 300 mg IV q4w or 300 mg SC q4w. Efficacy was not achieved with q12w administration of either the 150- or 300-mg dose [ ].
An earlier population model describing the relationship between natalizumab exposure and biomarker (α 4 -integrin saturation) response has been established [ ]. However, while PK levels (trough concentrations) were measured in all dosed subjects across all the studies mentioned above, α 4 -integrin saturation was measured in only a small cohort of subjects across studies, leaving us without the data to correlate α 4 -integrin saturation and disease endpoints. Except in study AN100226-231, exposure was correlated with response rather than α 4 -integrin saturation. In the absence of a link between the pharmacokinetics [PK]–α 4 -integrin saturation model and disease response variables (Gd lesion count and ARR), the PK–α 4 -integrin saturation model is not of significant help in corroborating the current clinical dosing regimen or illuminating the natalizumab exposure–disease response relationship in MS subjects.
In this manuscript, we combined data from four clinical studies of Gd lesion count and three clinical studies of ARR to (a) develop a population model characterizing the natalizumab exposure–response (i.e., Gd lesion count and ARR) relationship with IV or SC dosing of natalizumab in MS subjects and (b) conduct model-based simulations to determine the appropriateness of the current clinical dose and regimen based on response.

Response assessments
MRI assessments
Gadolinium is used as a contrast-enhancing agent in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spinal cord to diagnose disease activity in MS subjects. Because gadolinium chelates do not pass the blood–brain barrier (due to their hydrophilic nature), they are useful in enhancing lesions commonly observed in relapse-remitting or secondary progressive MS (in which the blood–brain barrier is compromised). In most cases, enhancement of new lesions persists for 2–6 weeks [ ].
All scheduled MRI scans with gadolinium were evaluated at a central MRI reading center for disease-activity purposes. Samples to assess Gd lesion counts were obtained as part of protocol-specified visits (Table 1 ).
ARR assessments
ARR is an outcome measure used for evaluating the efficacy of MS drugs [ ]. Relapses, defined as new or recurrent neurologic symptoms not associated with fever or infection, lasting for at least 24 h, and verified by an examining neurologist, were counted across individual MS subjects over a dosing interval following administration of natalizumab. The ARR for each subgroup of interest was calculated as the cumulative number of relapses experienced in that group divided by the total number of days of study for that group, and the ratio was multiplied by 365 [ , , ]. ARR observations for modeling the exposure-ARR relationship were available from all studies except RESTORE (101 MS-205). Samples to assess individual relapses were assessed at predefined time points (see Table 1 ).
Exposure data
A previously developed population PK (PopPK) model was used to derive exposure values for the exposure–response model [ ]. Individual model-estimated post hoc PK parameters were utilized to derive exposures over dosing intervals across the clinical studies. Individual serum concentration data to derive exposures were available across all subjects in all the studies used for Gd count/ARR model development except study AN100226-231, in which 115 of 142 subjects with measured Gd lesion counts and ARR had no serum samples collected to measure serum natalizumab concentration during the course of the study. In these subjects, exposures over dosing intervals were derived with a simulation step in NONMEM using final PopPK model parameters.
In this analysis, model-estimated individual average concentration (C avg ), calculated as AUCτ/τ (where AUC is the area under the time-concentration curve and τ is the dosing interval), was utilized as the exposure parameter. The use of C avg was more biologically plausible than the use of trough concentration, as the changes in clinical response (Gd lesion count and ARR) were expected to be due to cumulative changes in exposure rather than a change in trough concentration. AUCτ was not used as an exposure parameter, as the wide range of values was expected to cause numerical instability of the exposure–response model.
Population exposure–response model development
A sequential approach was adopted to model the relationship between natalizumab concentration and Gd lesion count/ARR data. The population exposure–response model for analysis of Gd lesion counts and ARR data was simulated using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling with NONMEM version 7.3.0 (Icon Development Solutions, Hannover, MD) [ ]. All models were developed using the first-order conditional estimation method with Laplacian and −2LL options in NONMEM. The dosing, covariate, and exposure–response data were merged and formatted for the population analysis using R, Version 3.1.3 ( http://www.r-project.org/ ).
Modeling of Gd lesion count data
The choice of models for Gd lesion count data have been well studied and published as part of analysis conducted for other MS drugs in the literature [ , , , , ]. Earlier work [ , ] analyzed the data at an individual level using a Markovian model in which any observed Gd lesion was assumed to be a function of a previous Gd lesion. The objective of these models was to characterize intra-individual changes in Gd lesion counts over time. Gd lesion counts, however, are also characterized by high inter-individual variability. MacKay Altman et al. [ ] addressed this issue by extending the Markovian models [ , ] and analyzing the data using a population approach. More recently, Velez de Mendizabal et al. [ ] compared several discrete distribution models for modeling Gd lesion count in nine MS patients treated with methylprednisone; these models incorporated different distribution families (Poisson, ZIP, generalized Poisson, negative binomial, or zero-inflated negative binomial) with or without a Markovian element. The authors concluded that a negative binomial model with a Markovian element was best able to characterize the overdispersion and large proportion of zero count. In the data set used by Velez de Mendizabal et al., Gd lesions were collected monthly for 48 months; this dense sampling allowed them to evaluate the model with a Markovian component, which would otherwise have been difficult. Extending this work, Hang et al. [ ] have adequately described the changes in Gd lesion counts over time upon administration of interferon β-1a in MS subjects with a negative binomial (NB) distribution, which allows for a flexible relationship between the mean and variance of Gd lesion count data.
Based on the literature (as summarized above), a negative binomial distribution has been used to describe the probability distribution of count data observed in MS trials. The parameterization of the negative binomial distribution is as described in Eq. 1 : $$P\left( {x = \kappa } \right) = \left[ {\frac{{\varGamma \left( {\kappa + r} \right)}}{\kappa !* \varGamma \left( r \right)}} \right]*p^{r} *(1 - p)^{\kappa } , \kappa \ge 0$$ (1) P represents the probability that the random variable x is equal to the number of counts kappa ( κ ) and p represents the probability of success, whereas r represents the number of failures. To account for overdispersion in data, this negative binomial distribution was modified as shown in Eq. 2 [ ] to describe the probability distribution of Gd lesion count and ARR data: $$P\left( {x = \kappa } \right) = \left[ {\frac{{\varGamma \left( {\kappa + \frac{1}{OVDP}} \right)}}{{\kappa !* \varGamma \left( {\frac{1}{OVDP}} \right)}}} \right]*\left( {\frac{1}{1 + OVDP*\lambda }} \right)^{{\frac{1}{OVDP}}} *\left( {\frac{\lambda }{{\lambda + \frac{1}{OVDP}}}} \right)^{\kappa } ,\quad \kappa \ge 0$$ (2) P represents the probability that the random variable x is equal to the number of counts kappa ( κ ). The expectation for the negative binomial distribution, \(E\left( x \right) = \lambda\) , corresponds to the mean number of counts in a given time period; overdispersion (OVDP) is the parameter that accounts for overdispersion, and Γ is the gamma function.
The exposure (C avg ) effects on Gd lesion count and ARR as expressed by λ were explored using either E max (the maximum drug-inhibitory effect on lesion count) or log-linear functional forms: $$\lambda_{\text{ij}} = \lambda_{{{\text{i}}0}} *\left( {1 - {\text{E}}_{\hbox{max} } *\frac{{{\text{C}}_{{{\text{avg}}_{{_{\text{ij}} }} }} }}{{{\text{EC}}_{{{\text{avg}}_{{_{50} }} }} + {\text{C}}_{{{\text{avg}}_{{_{\text{ij}} }} }} }}} \right),$$ (3) $$\lambda_{\text{ij}} = \lambda_{{{\text{i}}0}} *e^{{\left( {\beta * C_{{{\text{avg}}_{\text{ij}} }} } \right)}}$$ (4)
In Eqs. ( 3 ) and ( 4 ), λ ij represents the mean parameter of distribution for subject i at time j, λ i 0 the baseline λ , \({\text{C}}_{{{\text{avg}}_{\text{ij}} }}\) the exposure value for subject i at time j (either 0 [for placebo subjects or at baseline] or the estimated exposure over the dosing interval), parameter β the slope of exposure effect in log scale, and \({\text{EC}}_{{{\text{avg}}_{ 50} }}\) the average concentration at which a 50% inhibitory effect is achieved.
A mixed-effects modeling approach was used to analyze Gd lesion count data. A naive pooled and mixed-effects model was compared to describe ARR data. Given the large heterogeneity observed in baseline Gd lesion count data, a bimodal mixture model was also evaluated (Eq. 5 ). With the mixed-effects model, a random effect on baseline λ i0 was assumed to come from two subpopulations: one with low lesion activity and another with relatively higher lesion activity. A separate OVDP parameter was estimated across each of the subpopulations: $$\lambda_{{{\text{i}}0}} = \lambda_{{{\text{i}}0 , {\text{A}}}} *{\text{I}} \left\{ {{\text{Y}} = {\text{A}}} \right\} + \lambda_{{{\text{i}}0 , {\text{B}}}} *{\text{I}}\{ {\text{Y}} = {\text{B}}\}$$ (5)
The subpopulations ( \(\lambda_{{{\text{i}}0 , {\text{A}}}} ,\lambda_{{{\text{i}}0 , {\text{B}}}}\) ) were assumed to follow a log-normal distribution, with a mean μ and variance ω.
Distribution models used for Gd lesion counts were subsequently used to model ARR data, given the similar distribution properties as the Gd lesion count data.
Covariate model development
The correlation between age and baseline Gd count was investigated based on the assumption that subjects with a longer duration of MS prior to starting natalizumab (reflected by age) would have lower Gd lesion counts at baseline due to reduced relapses as they progress to SPMS. We also assessed whether baseline lymphocyte count had an observable relationship with baseline Gd lesion count (with high lymphocyte count correlating with high Gd count and vice versa). This was done to explore whether there was any mechanistic correlation between lymphocytes and disease activity as measured by Gd count. However, no such relationship was observed. Hence, no further covariate analysis was conducted as part of the exposure response analysis, and the covariate effects characterizing the variability in exposure were assumed to explain the variability in response.
Model evaluation and validation
Model evaluation was based on simulation-based diagnostics on account of their ability to reliably and efficiently depict variability and structural aspects of the model. Simulation-based diagnostics were conducted using visual and numerical predictive checks. Five hundred data sets were simulated using the final model and the corresponding parameter estimates. The observed and simulated data were then divided into 21 intervals according to exposure value, with 1 group of zero exposure and another 20 groups of positive exposure such that approximately equal numbers of subjects were in each of the 20 different subgroups. For each interval, variances were binned, and the median and 5th and 95th percentiles were calculated. Finally, the overall median and percentiles were represented graphically together with the median and percentiles corresponding to the raw data. A bootstrap resampling technique was later conducted to assess the precision of the parameter estimates and to confirm the robustness of the final model. One thousand bootstrap replicates were generated by randomly resampling from the original data set with replacements. The mean values and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) (i.e., the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles) from these bootstrap replicates were compared with the point estimates from the original data set. Visual predictive check (VPC) and bootstrap procedures were implemented with PsN version 4.4.0 [ ].
Simulations
Simulations were conducted based on the exposure–response model to explore whether the data supported the current approved clinical dose. Individual subject-specific demographics were sampled from the observed distribution in the clinical database, which encompassed studies AN100226-231, C-1801, 101 MS-205, and 101 MS-206. All subjects were expected to have no anti-natalizumab antibodies.
Simulations to support the dose–response relationships
To validate the current dose, four q4w treatment groups (75, 150, 200, and 300 mg) with n = 1000 per dosing group were simulated. At 1 year, the proportion of subjects with 0–1 Gd lesions in each dosing group and its corresponding mean ARR were calculated. From these simulations, the dosing group which at 1 year ensured that 90% of the enrolled subjects had 0–1 Gd lesions and a mean ARR of 0.25 was considered the clinically effective dose. The criteria for Gd lesion count and ARR were selected based on results of the monotherapy phase 3 study (C-1801) [ ].
Results
Demographics and subject characteristics
In total, the clinical data set comprised 1512 subjects who contributed 6913 Gd assessments and 1341 subjects who contributed 1341 ARR assessments. All the studies except for AN100226-231 enrolled only RRMS subjects. Of the 213 subjects randomized and dosed in study AN100226-231, 144 (68%) had RRMS and 69 (32%) had SPMS. Approximately 50% (737 of 1512) of the MS subjects in the placebo and treatment arms across the clinical studies showed no Gd lesions during the entire study period. These subjects were excluded from the exposure–Gd lesion count model, as the objective of this analysis was to model data with at least one observed Gd lesion during the study. Although some subjects showed no Gd lesions, they had documented relapses over the treatment period. This could be attributed to the sampling schedule and the fact that Gd lesions remain detectable by MRI for only 2 or 6 weeks after becoming inflamed. After all the exclusions, the final exposure–Gd lesion count modeling analysis data set comprised 3480 observation records from 775 subjects.

Gd lesion count model
A descriptive analysis of Gd lesion counts was performed before the actual model-building step. This analysis was meant to identify global trends and guide the modeling strategy. The time course of individual Gd lesion counts from the phase 2 studies is shown in Fig. S1. It is apparent that for a wide range of baseline disease activity, with the administration of natalizumab, Gd lesion count starts decreasing rapidly to zero and becomes more noticeable with increasing exposure to natalizumab.
Base exposure Gd model
The model development process is summarized in Table S1. The initial model (Table S1, Run 001) assumed an E max functional C avg effect on Gd (Eq. 3 ), with estimated variability on the baseline Gd and OVDP parameters. This model converged successfully but was statistically less significant (Δ = 174.441) than a drug-effect model that had a log-linear C avg effect on the Gd lesion count model (Table S1, Run 002). Hence, moving forward, the log-linear functional form was used to characterize the C avg effect on Gd lesion count. Although the model converged successfully, the gradients on variability estimates for the OVDP parameter were low. Given the asymmetric distribution of baseline Gd lesion count data, a bimodal mixture model was evaluated. An initial two-subpopulation mixture model (Table S1, Run 003) was run, assuming different variability in baseline count but the same overdispersion between the subpopulations. This resulted in significant reduction in objective function value (OFV; Δ = −40.82) relative to the previous model (Table S1, Run 002). As a next step, the influence of a separate between-subject variability on OVDP parameter for each of these subpopulations on the overall model predictability was assessed. This model (Table S1, Run 004) converged successfully, but the variability on the OVDP parameter was extremely low (1E−5). Rerunning the model after variability on the OVDP parameter was removed (Table S1, Run 003) resulted in a more stable model, with no change in OFV value (Δ = 0). Estimation of separate slope parameter for each subpopulation resulted in slopes that were comparable between the two subpopulations (0.0910 vs 0.0899); hence, the model was simplified to include just one slope parameter across both the populations.
Final exposure Gd lesion count model
The final model was a two-population mixture model on the parameters baseline Gd lesion count ( λ i 0 ) and OVDP. Inter-individual variability was estimated on baseline Gd lesion count ( λ i 0 ). Consistent with our assumption, the random effect on baseline ETA followed a log-normal distribution (Fig. S2). The exposure as expressed by C avg on Gd lesion count was characterized using a log-linear function. The final parameter estimates are shown in Table 3 . Median (95% CI) values of the parameters estimated from the bootstrap analyses listed in Table 3 were in good agreement with the NONMEM point estimates, indicating model robustness.

The typical values of \(\lambda_{i0} \varvec{ }\) are estimated to be 1.840 and 12.20 for the lower-Gd-lesion-activity and higher-Gd-lesion-activity subpopulations, respectively. The coefficient of variation for inter-subject variation on \(\lambda_{i0} \varvec{ }\) for the lower and higher Gd lesion activity subpopulations was estimated to be 88 and 120%, respectively. The estimated Gd lesion count baseline variability was consistent with the observed wide range of disease activity at baseline. The OVDP parameters were 0.614 and 3.26 for the low-lesion and high-lesion activity groups, respectively.
The estimated slope of the C avg effect on log (λ) was −0.0905, which implied that with each additional increase of 7.65 mg/L in C avg , λ was reduced by an additional 50%. With a model-predicted steady-state C avg of 47.2 mg/L, the mean AUC for the 300 mg q4w group, λ, was predicted to decrease by approximately 86% from baseline level across subjects with low and high disease Gd lesion activity. These results were consistent with published phase 3 study results [ ].
The VPC for mean Gd lesion count by C avg group is presented in Fig. 1 . It shows that the mean of simulated data is in good agreement with the mean of observed data, and the mean of observed data falls within the 95% CI for mean of simulated data. Figure 2 represents the marginal probability of different lesion counts (ranging from 0 to 10) based on 1000 simulations with the final Gd lesion model. The Gd lesion count observations were divided into 21 groups according to associated C avg (with one group for C avg = 0 and 20 groups for all positive C avg values). The dots connected by a line were the observed proportion for different lesion count categories and the shaded region were the corresponding 95% CI based on the simulation. From this figure it can be inferred that there is a trend for increased proportion of zero count with increasing C avg and that these C avg values lie inside the confidence band. This is also true for large-count numbers, for which the observed proportions fall well within the 95% CI. Fig. 1 VPC for the Gd lesion count–C avg by subgroup. Data were divided into 21 subgroups according to magnitude of C avg . The mean Gd lesion count was obtained for each subgroup and plotted against the median value of C avg in the same group. The median and 95% CI for the mean Gd lesion count were obtained by 500 simulations Fig. 2 VPC for marginal probabilities of different Gd lesion categories based on simulations using the final exposure–Gd lesion model. The dependent variable (DV) is Gd lesion count
Exposure-ARR model
The model development was conducted by beginning with a naive pooled model and assuming a log-linear C avg effect on ARR. The naive pooled model was qualified by comparing the model-estimated ARR to observed ARR at 1 year. Based on this criterion, the model adequately characterized the marginal distribution of the data, as the model-estimated mean ARR at 1 year for placebo was within 10% of the observed data (model-estimated ARR: 0.671; observed ARR: 0.740). Further evaluation of an E max functional form with or without a Hill coefficient on ARR resulted in very small gradients close to 0 on the parameters E max and EC50 (drug concentration that gives half-maximal response). Changing initial conditions did not improve the outcome. Given the model instability with the E max functional form as indicated by the low gradients, a log-linear functional form was selected to characterize the exposure ARR relationship.
Further evaluation of ARR data indicated that the distribution of ARR was highly asymmetric, with only 26% of the subjects in the combined natalizumab treatment and placebo arms having relapses during the course of study. Based on this, a random effect was added to the parameter (λ i0 ), which was assumed to follow a log-normal distribution, and the model was evaluated. This model converged successfully, with minimal change in objective function value and very low precision (170%) on the estimated baseline random effect (η λ_i0 ). Hence, this model was not included for further analysis. Adding a random effect on OVDP resulted in an unstable model with no covariance step and an estimated variability on OVDP close to 0. Given that each individual contributed only one C avg observation at steady state, random effect on slope was not evaluated, as the parameter was considered nonidentifiable.
Based on the above assessments, the naive pooled model that characterized the exposure as expressed by C avg on annualized relapse data using a log-linear functional form was chosen as the final base model. The model adequately characterized the marginal distribution of the data, as the model-estimated mean ARR at 1 year for placebo was within 10% of the observed data (model-estimated ARR of 0.671 vs observed ARR of 0.740). The parameter and the median (95% CI) bootstrap estimates are shown in Table 4 .

A negative slope (β = −0.0205) suggested that ARR decreased as C avg increased. With a model-predicted steady-state C avg of 45.4 mg/L, the mean AUC for the 300 mg q4w group, the mean ARR was estimated to be 0.242, representing a 61% ARR reduction compared with the placebo group (baseline ARR λ i 0 = 0.618).
The qualification of the final exposure-ARR model was evaluated by VPC. The VPC for mean ARR by C avg group is presented in Fig. 3 . It shows that the mean of simulated data is in good agreement with the mean of observed data and that the mean of observed data falls within the 95% CI for the mean of simulated data.

Simulations
Simulation results summarizing the mean (95% CI) for natalizumab exposure, the number of Gd lesions, the proportion of subjects that had 0–1 Gd lesions, and ARR at 1 year are presented in Table 5 . Figures 4 and 5 depict the natalizumab exposure (C avg ) effect on Gd lesion counts and ARR. The box plots within the figure represents the PK model-estimated steady-state C avg across the different simulated dosing arms. From the figures it is evident that the 300 mg q4w dose substantially lowers Gd lesion counts and ARR in the majority of subjects, thereby providing greater protection from disease activity. From Table 5 it can also be inferred that with a 300-mg dose, more than 90% of enrolled natalizumab-naive subjects treated with natalizumab had 0–1 lesions at 1 year, and these subjects had a mean ARR of 0.240. These results were comparable to the phase 3 published study results [ ] and support the current approved natalizumab clinical dosing regimen (300 mg q4w).

Discussion
A population model was developed to characterize the natalizumab exposure–disease response relationship in MS subjects. In the exposure–Gd lesion count model, the heterogeneous nature of the disease, as seen from the large variability in Gd lesion counts observed between subjects at baseline (Fig. S1), was best characterized using a bimodal-mixture model. Based on the model, the proportion of subjects with low Gd lesion activity was estimated to be ≈88%, which was counterintuitive, as MS subjects enrolled in natalizumab clinical studies were expected to have high Gd lesion activity. Nonetheless, 80% of the data used towards the development of the model were collected when natalizumab was undergoing clinical development, during which subjects with a wide range of Gd lesion activity enrolled in natalizumab studies. Initiation of treatment with natalizumab also resulted in a decrease in ARR. Based on parameter estimates of the model, a 300-mg q4w dose was expected to result in a mean ARR of ≈0.242 upon a year of treatment. This represents an ARR reduction of >60% relative to the placebo group.
The mean (95% CI) slopes from the exposure–Gd lesion count model and exposure-ARR model are −0.0903 (−0.100, −0.081) and −0.0222 (−0.026, −0.015) (mg/L) −1 , respectively. From the slopes, it can be inferred that both Gd lesion count and ARR in MS subjects decrease with increasing exposure to natalizumab. Furthermore, the model-estimated mean Gd lesion count and ARR after 1 year of treatment with 300 mg q4w natalizumab dose were comparable with the published monotherapy phase 3 study results (model Gd lesion count: 0.08 vs 0.10 for observed; model ARR: 0.24 vs 0.22 for observed) [ ]. These results further substantiate the predictability of the model.
Although the exposure–Gd count model adequately characterizes the data, approximately 50% of the subjects had to be excluded due to lack of disease activity during the course of the study. Efforts to account for these subjects with zero inflated NB distribution resulted in an unstable model. Given the available options, the decision was made to exclude subjects with no Gd activity during the entire duration of study and model only those subjects with Gd activity. This limitation needs to be taken into account, and any future study should be powered to ascertain the impact of dose/dosing regimen based only on Gd lesion data.
Another major limitation of the current analysis is the infrequent collection of Gd lesion counts; more frequent collection would have allowed exploration of the relationship between MRI (Gd count) and relapses. Based on published literature [ ], MRI measures of inflammatory activity (Gd lesions) correlate weakly with relapses, the clinical manifestation of MS inflammatory component. A clinical hypothesis is that there is a delay between the observed MRI measure of inflammation and a relapse. This may be attributable to the fact that the Gd counts recorded every month represent the total number of Gd lesions and that older lesions observed in previous months might persist over time depending on administered dose (with such lesions disappearing more slowly with a lower dose). Thus, though the clinical relapse (symptoms that appear in acute periods) usually lasts less than a month, the active inflammatory event might persist for a longer time. In studies 101 MS-205 and 101 MS-206, subjects treated with natalizumab for a minimum of 1 year were randomized to alternate treatment arms. If a relapse was observed in these alternate treatments arms the subjects were rescued and put back on regular natalizumab treatment. Hence, given the study designs, patient population, and wide interval between Gd count measurements, it was not possible to establish a relationship between Gd lesion count and ARR, which would have clarified the exposure–response relationship.
Based on the Gd lesion count/ARR models, a 300 mg SC dose administered q4w is expected to provide comparable efficacy. Nonetheless, the response data for SC administration used in the model were derived exclusively from study 101 MS-206 (REFINE), in which the subjects had been treated with IV natalizumab prior to the start of the study [ ]. Therefore, the plasma concentration required for a 300 mg q4w SC dose to be efficacious in natalizumab-naive subjects could not be quantified. Considering both the described exposure–MRI/ARR relationships and the REFINE study design, though a 300 mg SC dose achieves a comparable trough concentration to that of a 300 mg IV dose, the resulting exposure might still be insufficient to maintain efficacy.
Although treatment with natalizumab is efficacious, it is associated with the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), an opportunistic brain infection that is caused by the JC virus [ ]. In the context of PML development, questions have been raised about the appropriateness of the approved 300 mg q4w dosing regimen to maintain treatment efficacy [ , , ]. Specifically, it has been raised whether a dose less than or less frequent than 300 mg q4w should be considered for natalizumab MS patients. To address the above question, model-based simulations were conducted to provide further evidence to support the approved dose. Based on these simulations (Table 5 ), a 300-mg dose would ensure more effective protection from disease activity in a majority of the enrolled subjects based on both Gd lesion counts and ARR than other simulated doses (75, 150, or 200 mg q4w). Reductions in Gd lesion counts and ARR were observed with lower natalizumab doses, but only the 300-mg q4w dose was associated with an ARR ≤ 0.25 and was considered clinically effective.
Recent publications have listed persistently high α 4 -integrin saturation is one of the risk factors for PML, due to loss of immune surveillance in the central nervous system [ , , ]. To mitigate the risk of PML, various MS treatment centers have explored alternate dosing regimens in MS subjects as a way modulating α 4 -integrin saturation [ ]. However, while it is unknown whether this approach would lower the risk of PML, current data does enable characterization of the risk of extended dosing regimens on Gd lesion counts and ARR. Our analysis showed that C avg values >40 mg/L are expected to confer substantial protection from disease activity (nearly zero new Gd lesions and ARR ≈0.24). It can therefore be inferred that dosing subjects with extended-interval dosing regimens (i.e., 300 mg every 6 weeks or 300 mg every 8 weeks) would result in inadequate protection from disease activity (Gd lesion count and ARR).
Conclusions
An exposure–response model created to characterize the relationship between natalizumab exposure, Gd lesion counts, and ARR in MS subjects described the data adequately. Model-based simulation analysis demonstrated that 300 mg IV administered q4w is the most appropriate dose for the majority of MS subjects in a population with varied demographic background and baseline disease activity (Gd lesion counts and ARR). This could not be deduced from the traditional, per-trial data analysis, demonstrating the value of identifying the exposure–response relationship for natalizumab.
