Introduction
The free radicals which are produced as a consequence of aerobic respiration can cause cumulative oxygen damage which may contribute to aging process (Rahman ). Oxygen is an indispensable molecule for all aerobic cells for chemical production of energy; however, it is often converted into highly reactive forms commonly known as reactive oxygen species (ROS) which may produce harm to vital cell components (Wang and Hai ). Enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant defense mechanisms neutralize the toxicity of metabolic oxidants (Bjørklund and Chirumbolo ). When an imbalance between the production and neutralization of oxidants occurs, an accumulation of ROS leads to oxidative stress (Rani et al. ). The oxidative stress in cells may cause metabolic dysfunctions such as loss of cell integrity, enzyme dysfunction, and genomic instability, which ultimately lead to progression of many diseases including ischemia, cancer, atherosclerosis, inflammation, Parkinson’s disease, and Alzheimer’s disease (Azzam et al. ; Deavall et al. ). Alzheimer’s disease is the most common known type of dementia observed in older age due to the degeneration of cholinergic neurons (Cummings and Kaufer ). Oxidative stress (Bonda et al. ) and inflammation (Schwab and McGeer ) are the important mediators for the neuronal damage in age-related dementia. The neurodegeneration in turn causes more oxidative damage which may further exacerbate the pathological condition. Recently, there is an interest in search of drugs to reduce or reverse the losses of cholinergic neuron by increasing the levels of acetylcholine in brain through the use of acetylcholine precursors, or use of inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase or use of muscarinic agonists (Giacobini ).
Walnuts being the most popular nuts from the time immemorial provide a wide range of nutritive and non-nutritive bioactive compounds. These nuts are being extensively examined in various clinical and pre-clinical studies in last few years. The hypoglycemic, and hypotensive activities of walnuts have been reported earlier (Fukuda et al. ). Previously, a diet rich in walnuts slowed the growth of cancer (Feldman ) and oral administration of a polyphenolic-rich fraction of walnuts prevented liver damage in mice (Banel and Hu ). The potential positive effects of nuts on memory function particularly in older subjects have been suggested previously (Ros ). The walnuts are nutrient-rich food because of their high poly-unsaturated fat and protein content (reviewed by Pribis and Shukitt-Hale ). These nuts also contain many minerals including manganese, zinc, selenium as well as vitamins such as thiamine, folate, vitamins B6, B12, and choline (Morley ). Besides this valuable composition, walnuts also contain antioxidative phenolic compounds (Chrzanowski et al. ; Hayes et al. ). Researchers and food manufacturers have now become more interested in polyphenols because of their potential role in the prevention of various diseases associated with oxidative stress and their abundance in natural food sources (Scalbert et al. ). Walnut kernels along with the pellicle have shown the highest phenolic levels among the 25 types of commonly consumed foods tested by Gunduc and El ( ). Recently Slatnar et al. ( ) reported twenty-seven phenolic compounds in kernel of walnut majority of which are hydrolysable tannins (approximately 60%). Scientists suggest the role of dietary nutrients in the prevention of various diseases associated with oxidative stress such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders (Everitt et al. ). Previously in vitro studies have demonstrated that phenolic extract of walnut can inhibit fibrillization of amyloid-β (Aβ), solubilize pre-existing Aβ fibrils (Chauhan et al. ), and give protection against Aβ induced oxidative stress and apoptosis (Muthaiyah et al. ).
Decreased muscarinic cholinergic receptor density has been associated with the normal aging (Tayebati et al. ). The induced cholinergic dysfunction by pharmacological intervention may produce similar memory impairment in young subjects as observed in older age (Francis et al. ). On the basis of this hypothesis, scopolamine has been used previously by many researchers to develop animal model of amnesia (Fan et al. ; Hancianu et al. ). It has been suggested that age related neurodegeneration due to oxidative stress may involve disruption of cholinergic muscarinic receptors by impairing the cellular 2nd messenger cascade (Mattson and Pedersen ). Moreover, Antioxidant enzyme activities are decreased following scopolamine injection in rats (Budzynska et al. ). The present study investigates the protective effects of walnut in scopolamine-induced amnesia. We also examined the effect of walnuts on specific involvement of cholinergic function by assaying acetylcholine content and measuring acetylcholinesterase activity. Considering the antioxidative potential of walnut, this study further examined the possible anti-oxidative mechanism of walnut for scopolamine-induced oxidative stress.
Material and methods
Animals
The experimental procedures were approved by the institutional ethics and animal care committee and performed in strict accordance with National Institute of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Publication No. 85–23, revised 1985). Locally bred Albino Wistar rats with an average body weight of 180–200 g and age 5–6 month old were purchased from Dow University of Health Sciences, OJHA campus, Karachi, Pakistan. To avoid effect of social interaction, animals were housed individually with ad libitum access to cubes of standard rodent diet (A control diet (4.47 kcal/g) containing wheat flour (400 g), gram flour (171 g), barley flour (171 g), corn flour (100 g), vegetable oil (50 g), milk powder (100 g), vitamin mixture (2.5 g), iodized salt (NaCl; 5.5 g)) and tap water under a 12:12 h light/dark cycle (lights on at 7:00 am) at controlled room temperature (22 ± 2 °C). Prior to experiments, animals were subjected to three days of acclimation period and to various handling procedures in order to reduce the stress of novelty and handling. All experiments were carried out in a balanced design to avoid influence of order and time.
Experimental protocol
Shelled walnuts of American imported quality were purchased from the local super market which were then peeled, finely crushed and refrigerated in air tight bottle. Rats were orally administered with freshly prepared walnut suspension for 28 days. Initially, three different doses were tested to obtain effective dose of walnut. Test groups ( n = 6) were treated with 200, 400 or 800 mg/kg walnut suspension and water given to the control group. After 28 days of administration rats were subjected to elevated plus maze (EPM), and Morris water maze (MWM) and novel object recognition (NOR) task for memory assessment (Fig. 1 a). In experiment B and C effective dose of walnut was pre-administered in scopolamine-injected rats to assess scopolamine-induced amnesia (Fig. 1 b) and oxidative stress (Fig. 1 c). Rats were divided into two control and test groups. Effective dose of walnut was given to the test group and control animals were treated with water. Both groups were further divided into saline- and scopolamine-injected rats ( n = 8) after twenty-eight days of walnut administration. Scopolamine was injected intraperitoneally five minutes before the start of each memory test at the dose of 0.5 mg/kg. All experiments were carried out between 8:00 and 17:00 h. Rats were decapitated immediately after behavioral tests to collect their brains. Whole brain was removed from the skull within 30 s after decapitation. All brain samples were immediately stored at −70 °C for neurochemical assays. Acetylcholine and acetylcholinesterase activity was estimated in hippocampus and frontal cortex, whereas, oxidative status was determined in whole brain of rat. A balanced design was followed for all the treatments and behavioral procedures in order to avoid effect of order and time. Fig. 1 Schematic representation of experimental protocol
Memory assessment
The dimensions of the apparatus used for EPM, MWM, NOR and their procedures were same as described earlier (Batool et al. ). The method for passive avoidance task (PAT) was essentially the same as reported by Quevedo et al. ( ).
Neurochemical analysis
The brain tissue acetylcholine content and acetylcholinesterase activity were estimated by the method of Hestrin ( ) and Ellman et al. ( ) respectively.
Oxidative parameters
The whole brains were removed, rinsed in isotonic saline, and weighed. A 10% ( w / v ) tissue homogenate was prepared with 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 10,000×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was used for the estimation of lipid peroxidation (Chow and Tappel ), superoxide dismutase (SOD) (Chidambara Murthy et al. ), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) (Flohe and Gunzler ) and catalase (CAT) (Sinha ) activities.
Statistical analysis
Data were presented as mean±SEM and statistically analyzed using SPSS version 20. Dose related effects of walnut administration were analyzed by Tukey’s test post-hoc test following one-way ANOVA. Results for the training and test sessions obtained from EPM, MWM and PAT were analyzed by Bonferroni test following three-way (walnut × scopolamine × sessions) ANOVA with repeated measure design. Recognition index, acetylcholine, MDA concentrations and enzyme activities were statistically estimated by two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test to compare the different groups. One-sample t test was used to determine whether the exploration ratios in NOR test under each condition were significantly different from chance levels. Furthermore, various correlations were also determined by Pearson correlation test. Values of p < 0.05 were considered as a statistically significant difference.
Results
Experiment a: Dose related effects of walnut on memory function
Dose related effects of walnut on memory function was assessed by EPM, MWM and NOR following 28 days of administration (Fig. 2 ). One-way ANOVA showed significant effects of walnut on transfer latency [ F (3, 20) = 9.24, p < 0.01]. Post hoc test revealed that walnut administration at all three doses significantly decreased ( p < 0.01) transfer latency as compared to that of untreated controls. One-way ANOVA for escape latency [ F (3, 20) = 19.46, p < 0.01] and recognition index [ F (3, 20) = 23.67, p < 0.01] also showed significant effects of long term administration of walnut. Whereas, post hoc analysis by Tukey’s test showed that walnut administration at the dose of 200 mg/kg significantly increased memory function as evident by significant decrease ( p < 0.05) in escape latency and significant increase ( p < 0.05) in recognition index. These nootropic effects were more enhanced at the doses of 400 and 800 mg/kg which showed p < 0.01 level of significance for escape latency and recognition index as compared to that of control rats. These results demonstrate that supplementation of walnut significantly increased the memory function in rats and that feeding 400 and 800 mg/kg walnut had the optimal nootropic effects. Therefore, 400 mg/kg walnut administration regimen was selected as a moderate dose for the rest of experiments in this study. Fig. 2 Dose related effects of walnut on memory and cognitive functions in rats fed with 200, 400 or 800 mg/kg for 28 days. Memory retention was assessed as transfer latency by elevated plus maze and escape latency by Morris water maze after 24 h of training. Cognitive ability was determined by novel object recognition task as recognition index. Values are means ± SEM ( n = 6). Data was analyzed by Tukey’s test following one-way ANOVA. Statistical difference is represented as ** p < 0.01 versus controls
Experiment B: Effects of pre-administration of walnut on scopolamine-induced amnesia and cholinergic dysfunction
Memory assessment by EPM, MWM and NOR
Memory function was assessed by EPM, MWM and NOR tasks following the administration walnut in saline and scopolamine treated rats (Fig. 3 ). Three-way ANOVA with repeated measure design was used to analyze the data of EPM and MWM. Statistical analysis of EPM (Fig. 3 a) data revealed significant effects of walnut administration [ F (1, 28) = 50.60, p < 0.01], scopolamine [ F (1, 28) = 38.21, p < 0.01], sessions [ F (2, 56) = 104.41, p < 0.01] and significant interactions between walnut × sessions [ F (2, 56) = 3.38, p < 0.05]. Other interactions were statistically not significant. Analysis of MWM (Fig. 3 b) data also showed significant effect of walnut administration [ F (1, 28) = 41.40, p < 0.01], scopolamine [ F (1, 28) = 16.69, p < 0.01], sessions [ F (2, 56) = 199.44, p < 0.01] and a significant interactions between walnut × sessions [ F (2, 56) = 3.40, p < 0.05] and scopolamine × sessions [ F (2, 56) = 4.33, p < 0.05]. Other interactions were statistically not significant. Multiple group comparisons showed significant improvement of learning acquisition ( p < 0.01) and memory retention ( p < 0.01) walnut-treated rats as compared to that of controls in both EPM and MWM paradigm. Walnut-treated rats also showed improved learning acquisition ( p < 0.01) and memory retention ( p < 0.01) as compared to that of training and acquisition sessions, respectively. Scopolamine administration resulted in impaired learning acquisition in EPM ( p < 0.01) and MWM ( p < 0.05) tasks as compared to that of controls. Diminished memory retention ( p < 0.05) was also observed in scopolamine treated rats as compared to controls. Pre-administration of walnut significantly prevented the scopolamine-induced memory impairment as shown by comparable transfer latency and escape latency in Wal + Sco group with controls. Fig. 3 Effects of walnut pre-administration (400 mg/kg) in scopolamine-induced memory impairment were assessed by a elevated plus maze as transfer latency, b Morris water maze as escape latency. Values are means ± SEM ( n = 8). Significant differences by Bonferroni test: * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 from respective control animals; ++ p < 0.01 from training phase values of similarly treated animals; # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01 from acquisition phase values of similarly treated animals, following three-way ANOVA repeated measure design. Memory was also assessed using novel object recognition task as c recognition index and d chance performance. Data for recognition index was analyzed by Tukey’s test following two-way ANOVA; significant differences are represented as ** p < 0.01 from saline-treated controls and ++ p < 0.01 from water-treated controls. Data for chance performance was analyzed by one-sample t test; ** p < 0.01 represents that mean values are significantly different from chance performance (i.e., 50%; no discrimination between old and new objects)
Pre-administration of walnut for 28 days attenuated scopolamine-induced impaired recognition memory in NOR task (Fig. 3 c). Two-way ANOVA demonstrated a significant effect of the walnut administration [ F (1, 28) = 105.67, p < 0.01], scopolamine [ F (1, 28) = 7.86, p < 0.01] and a significant interaction between walnut × sessions [ F (1, 28) = 19.29, p < 0.01]. Post-hoc analysis by Tukey’s test showed that walnut administration significantly increased recognition index ( p < 0.01) as compared to the saline-treated control rats indicating enhanced recognition memory. Scopolamine group exhibited impaired cognitive ability as evident by decreased recognition index ( p < 0.01) as compared to that of controls. Scopolamine-induced reduced recognition memory was significantly attenuated by the pre-administration of walnut in Wal + Sco group as this group exhibited increased cognitive ability as compared to the scopolamine-treated group ( p < 0.01).
NOR data was also evaluated for chance performance. Chance performance was defined as the point at which rat was unable to distinguish between old and new objects (i.e. equal % time spent with both objects). Data for chance performance was analyzed by one-sample t test. Saline-treated group exhibited 50% chance performance [ t (7) = 0.21, p > 0.05], whereas, scopolamine impaired the memory performance than the chance level [ t (7) = 7.09, p < 0.01]. Walnut treatment on the other hand significantly improved memory performance than the chance level in both saline-treated [ t (7) = 4.58, p < 0.01] and scopolamine-treated [ t (7) = 10.25, p < 0.01] animals. This result also emphasizes the attenuation of scopolamine-induced memory dysfunction by walnut pre-administration.
Cholinergic function
Cholinergic function was determined in hippocampus and frontal cortex in terms of acetylcholine content and acetylcholinesterase activity. The hippocampal and frontal cortical acetylcholine content are presented in Table 1 . Two-way AVONA for the data of hippocampal acetylcholine content showed significant effect of the scopolamine [ F (1, 28) = 64.58, p < 0.01], a significant interaction of walnut × scopolamine [ F (1, 28) = 6.23, p < 0.05]. Effect of walnut was not significant [ F (1, 28) = 0.034, p > 0.05]. The acetylcholine content in scopolamine injected rats was significantly reduced ( p < 0.05) as compared to that of saline-treated rats. The pre-administration of walnut in scopolamine-injected rats also exhibited significantly decreased acetylcholine content ( p < 0.01) in hippocampus as compared to that walnut-treated animals. Analysis of frontal cortical acetylcholine data revealed significant effect of the scopolamine [ F (1, 28) = 29.69, p < 0.01]. Effect of walnut [ F (1, 28) = 2.27, p > 0.05] and interaction between walnut × scopolamine [ F (1, 28) = 0.663, p > 0.05] were not significant on frontal cortical acetylcholine concentration. Similar pattern of acetylcholine content was observed in frontal cortex following post-hoc analysis. Scopolamine-injected rats showed significantly decreased ( p < 0.05) acetylcholine concentration as compared to that of saline-treated controls. Wal + Sco group exhibited significant decrease ( p < 0.01) in acetylcholine concentration as compared to that of walnut group. Table 1 Effects of walnut pre-administration on acetylcholine concentration (μmol/g) following scopolamine injection Hippocampus Frontal cortex Control Walnut Control Walnut Saline Scopolamine Saline Scopolamine Saline Scopolamine Saline Scopolamine 4.43 ± 0.82 3.09 ± 0.64** 5.07 ± 0.61 2.54 ± 0.61** 2.38 ± 0.48 1.71 ± 0.38* 2.28 ± 0.42 1.38 ± 0.31** Values are mean±SEM ( n = 8). Data was analyzed by Tukey’s test following two-way ANOVA. Statistical difference is represented as * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 from saline-treated controls
Statistical analysis of acetylcholinesterase activity data did not show any significant effects of treatment, therefore, correlation between acetylcholine content and acetylcholinesterase activity was obtained to have an idea about the cholinergic function in controls and walnut-treated rats (Table 2 ). Pearson correlation test revealed a positive correlation between acetylcholine levels and acetylcholinesterase activity in the walnut-treated that were administered with either saline or scopolamine ( r = 0.551, p < 0.05), whereas, this correlation was not observed in the saline and the scopolamine injected control rats ( r = −0.188, p > 0.05) in hippocampus. In frontal cortex similar pattern was observed that is a significant positive correlation in the walnut-treated saline- and scopolamine injected rats ( r = 0.692, p < 0.01) and a non-significant correlation in saline- and scopolamine-injected control rats ( r = 0.401, p > 0.05) was obtained. These results intended us to find out the correlation between acetylcholine levels and memory function in both controls and walnut-treated rats (Table 2 ). Walnut treatment in saline- and scopolamine-injected rats exhibited a strong positive correlation between acetylcholine content of hippocampus ( r = 0.863, p < 0.01) and frontal cortex ( r = 0.633, p < 0.01) with memory retention. The saline and the scopolamine injected control rats exhibited non-significant correlation of hippocampal and frontal cortical acetylcholine concentration with memory retention.

Experiment C: Effects of pre-administration of walnut on scopolamine-induced amnesia and oxidative stress
Memory assessment by PAT
This part of the study was conducted to evaluate the effects of long term walnut administration on scopolamine-induced memory loss and brain oxidative alterations. The effects of long term administration of walnut on step down latency (Fig. 4 ) following scopolamine-induced memory impairment was analyzed by three-way ANOVA with repeated measure design revealed significant effect of walnut administration [ F (1, 28) = 544.49, p < 0.01], scopolamine [ F (1, 28) = 95.30, p < 0.01], sessions [ F (2, 56) = 287.01, p < 0.01] and significant interactions between walnut × scopolamine [ F (1, 28) = 16.87, p < 0.01], walnut × sessions [ F (2, 56) = 104.04, p < 0.01], scopolamine × sessions [ F (2, 56) = 27.31, p < 0.01], walnut × scopolamine × sessions [ F (2, 56) = 3.70, p < 0.05]. Post-hoc test showed that administration of walnut at the dose of 400 mg/kg for 28 days resulted in an increase in learning acquisition ( p < 0.01) and memory retention ( p < 0.01) as compared to that of controls. Learning acquisition ( p < 0.01) and memory retention ( p < 0.01) were also significantly increased as compared to training session and acquisition session, respectively in walnut-treated rats. The scopolamine group exhibited impaired acquisition ( p < 0.05) as compared to control rats. Twenty-four hours after the training session, the scopolamine injected rats showed significant increase ( p < 0.01) in step-down latency as compared to acquisition session this improvement may be due to the effect of repeated exposure to the same stimuli, however, compared to that of untreated controls they showed reduced memory performance ( p < 0.01). Pre-administration of walnut significantly prevented the scopolamine-induced memory impairment as shown by significant increased step-down latency in Wal + Sco group as compared to that of controls. Fig. 4 Effects of pre-administration of walnut (400 mg/kg) in scopolamine-induced memory impairment assessed by passive avoidance task as step-down latency (sec). Values are means ± SEM ( n = 8). Significant differences by Bonferroni test: * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 from respective control animals; ++ p < 0.01 from training phase values of similarly treated animals; ## p < 0.01 from acquisition phase values of similarly treated animals, following three-way ANOVA repeated measure design
Oxidative status
The effects of long term walnut administration following scopolamine-induced amnesia on MDA levels and antioxidant enzymes activities are shown in Table 3 . Two-way ANOVA for MDA levels showed significant effect of walnut administration [ F (1, 28) = 54.90, p < 0.01], scopolamine [ F (1, 28) = 9.92, p < 0.01] and a significant interaction between walnut × scopolamine [ F (1, 28) = 10.71, p < 0.01]. The walnut administered rats exhibited significantly ( p < 0.05) reduced lipid peroxidation as compared to untreated rats following Tukey’s post-hoc test. Scopolamine administration significantly ( p < 0.01) induced oxidative stress as evident by increase in MDA levels as compared to that of control rats. Whereas, pretreatment with walnut significantly ( p < 0.01) reduced lipid peroxidation in Wal + Sco group as compared to that of scopolamine-treated rats. Table 3 Effects of walnut pre-administration on oxidative status following scopolamine injection Control Walnut Saline Scopolamine Saline Scopolamine MDA (μM/g) 17.9 ± 1.09 25.7 ± 1.95** 13.0 ± 0.22+ 12.8 ± 0.89++ SOD (U/g) 27.9 ± 1.17 20.7 ± 1.04* 28.7 ± 1.95 26.0 ± 2.76 GPx (μmol/g/min) 42.7 ± 1.21 35.3 ± 1.86** 42.3 ± 1.15 42.4 ± 1.24++ CAT (mmol/g/min) 38.2 ± 0.70 31.8 ± 0.58** 34.3 ± 0.83+ 40.2 ± 1.31**++ Values are mean±SEM ( n = 8). Data was analyzed by Tukey’s test following two-way ANOVA. Statistical difference is represented as * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 from saline-treated controls and + p < 0.05, ++ p < 0.01 from water-treated controls
Two-way ANOVA revealed significant effect of scopolamine [ F (1, 28) = 7.05, p < 0.05] but non-significant effect of walnut administration [ F (1, 28) = 2.64, p > 0.05] and a non-significant interaction between walnut × scopolamine [ F (1, 28) = 1.48, p > 0.05] on SOD activity. It was observed that scopolamine administration significantly ( p < 0.05) reduced SOD activity as compared to that of controls following Tukey’s post hoc analysis. This scopolamine-induced decreased SOD activity was normalized by pre-administration of walnut in Wal + Sco group. In case of GPx activity, there was a significant effect of walnut administration [ F (1, 28) = 5.63, p < 0.05] and scopolamine injection [ F (1, 28) = 6.84, p < 0.05]. A significant interaction between walnut × scopolamine [ F (1, 28) = 7.01, p < 0.05] was also observed following analysis by two-way ANOVA. Post-hoc analysis by Tukey’s test revealed significant decrease ( p < 0.01) in GPx activity in rats injected with scopolamine alone than untreated rats. This reduced activity of GPx was not observed in Wal + Sco group. Pre-administration of walnut in Wal + Sco rats exhibited significantly increased ( p < 0.01) GPx activity as compared to that of scopolamine injected rats. Data for brain CAT activity was also analyzed by two-way ANOVA which showed significant effect of walnut administration [ F (1, 28) = 6.22, p < 0.05] and a significant interaction between walnut × scopolamine [ F (1, 28) = 46.20, p < 0.01] but a non-significant effect of scopolamine [ F (1, 28) = 0.070, p > 0.05] was observed. Scopolamine administration induced significant reduction ( p < 0.01) in the CAT activity as compared to controls. Rats administered with walnut alone exhibited significant decrease ( p < 0.05) in CAT activity as compared to that of untreated rats suggesting its direct action on the enzyme activity. Administration of walnut significantly increased ( p < 0.01) the SOD activity in Wal + Sco group as compared to that of scopolamine-injected rats.
In order to determine the effect of walnut on oxidative status, a correlation test was performed between MDA levels and % memory retention. The saline and the scopolamine injected control rats exhibited a negative correlation of MDA levels with % memory retention ( r = −0.663, p < 0.01). The walnut-treated rats, that were administered with either saline or scopolamine, did not show this correlation between MDA levels with % memory retention ( r = 0.218, p > 0.05). Negative co-relations of MDA levels with SOD ( r = −0.542, p < 0.05), GPx ( r = −0.708, p < 0.01) and CAT ( r = −0.847, p < 0.01) activities were also observed in the saline and the scopolamine injected control rats, whereas, these correlations were not observed in the walnut-treated saline and scopolamine injected rats. These correlations emphasized the antioxidative properties of walnut administration against scopolamine-induced oxidative stress (Table 4 ).

Discussion
Researchers are looking for dietary patterns and specific nutrients that may enhance brain function and hence reduce the risk of developing dementia (Whalley et al. ). Dietary supplementation of walnut has been reported to improve learning and memory performance in transgenic animal model of Alzheimer’s disease (Muthaiyah et al. ). Consistent with these studies, the present investigation also revealed that long term walnut pre-administration significantly attenuated scopolamine-induced impaired memory as evident by decreased transfer latency and escape latency in EPM and MWM, respectively in Wal + Sco rats. This improved memory was also consistently observed in NOR and PAT in the present study. These results can be attributed to the improved cholinergic function in walnut-treated rats as further evident by positive correlation between acetylcholine concentrations and % memory retention.
Aging is associated with the alteration of neurotransmitter mechanism (Chand Basha et al. ; Haider et al. ). The cholinergic neuronal circuit that is present in forebrain, hippocampus and cerebral cortex play important role in memory function and age-related memory disorders (Preston and Eichenbaum ). Changes in hippocampal cholinergic function has been implicated in dementia and the use of muscarinic antagonist in animal model provides an approach to study the role of cholinergic system in memory-related disorders (Milner et al. ; Francis et al. ). It has been shown that the blockage of post-synaptic receptor by antagonist increases the release of neurotransmitter in synaptic cleft leading to its increased degradation (Toide ). In the present study scopolamine treatment in rats resulted in reduced levels of acetylcholine content in hippocampus and frontal cortex which was accompanied with the observed memory impairment. This suggests that the blockade of muscarinic receptors by scopolamine may result in an increase degradation of acetylcholine causing an impairment of memory. The adult rodents supplemented with choline during developing stage exhibited significant and irreversible changes in hippocampal activity including increased proliferation of hippocampal progenitor cells and decreased cell death (Albright et al. , ), enhanced long-term potentiation (Pyapali et al. ; Montoya et al. ), and improved memory functions (Williams et al. ). These effects were hypothesized to attribute to the increased availability of brain choline for the synthesis and release of acetylcholine (Zeisel ). Increased hippocampal acetylcholine release was demonstrated during the memory performance in rats (Fadda et al. ). Lim and Suzuki ( ) have shown improved memory function following the intake of phoshatidylcholine rich diet for four months. These scientists postulated that phoshatidylcholine provides choline precursor for the synthesis of acetylcholine and thus improved the learning and memory function in mice.
In present study rats administered with walnut for 28 days exhibited a non-significant increase in hippocampal acetylcholine concentration however a significant improvement in memory performance was observed compared to that of untreated controls. Whereas, Wal + Sco group which was pre-administered with walnut resulted in decreased acetylcholine but showed improved memory performance as compared to rats treated with scopolamine alone. The data published by US Department of Agriculture and Nutritional database shows that 100 g walnut contains 39.2 mg of choline (USDA ). Therefore, in present study it may be suggested that choline content in walnut may increase the synthesis and release of acetylcholine as compared to scopolamine injected rats and more acetylcholine may be available to bind with remaining receptors and, therefore, produce memory enhancing effects (Babb et al. ; Wozniak et al. ). It is further postulated that beside cholinergic function some other mechanism may be involved in walnut-induced memory improvement. Previously increased level of brain tryptophan, precursor of serotonin (5-HT), has been reported from our lab following the long term administration of walnut in rats. Levels of 5-HT and its metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, were also significantly enhanced in walnut-treated rats indicating increased 5-HT metabolism by walnut administration (Haider et al. ). Walnut is the rich source of essential amino acids and essential unsaturated fatty acids (Brufau et al. ). It is suggested that supplementation of tryptophan and vitamin B6-rich food may increase 5-HT levels and prevent its deficiency (Shabbir et al. ). The improved learning and memory function following the supplementation of tryptophan has been shown previously (Haider et al. ). Evidence also showed improved serotonergic neurotransmission and reduced aggressive behavior and suicidal rate by the intake tryptophan-rich diet. (Mawson and Jacobs ; Voracek and Tran ). Unsaturated fatty acid content of neuronal membrane influences the neurotransmission by affecting the mechanism of biogenic amine synthesis and degradation (Salem et al. ; Salem ). Walnuts contain n-3 and n-6 fatty acids at the effective ratio of 1:4 which has been demonstrated to improve memory performance in young rats (Yehuda and Carasso ) and senescence-accelerated mice (Umezawa et al. ). Rats supplemented with essential fatty acids exhibited increased neuronal membrane fatty acid composition as shown by Yehuda et al. ( ). Since walnuts provide tryptophan and essential fatty acids, it is conceivable that walnut derived essential nutrients could account for the effects of supplementation on scopolamine-induced amnesia in this study. Other constituents of walnuts such as melatonin, folate, vitamin E, and phenolic compounds could also be contributing to the memory enhancing effects of walnut supplementation (Tuzcu and Baydas ; Raghavendra and Kulkarni ).
Oxidative stress (Bonda et al. ) and inflammation (Schwab and McGeer ) are prominent features in the pathophysiology of age-related cognitive impairments. This study was also concerned with the brain oxidative status of walnut-treated rats following scopolamine injection. Scopolamine-induced impaired memory and oxidative stress has been reported earlier (Budzynska et al. ). Cholinergic muscarinic receptors are involved in antiapoptotic- and antioxidant- responses. The muscarinic agonists mediate antiapoptotic activity by stimulating antioxidant defense mechanism (Giordano et al. ). It has been shown that the blockage of muscarinic receptor induces decreased expression of nuclear factor-E2 related factor-2 (Nrf2), a transcription factor that regulates the expression of proteins which collectively constitute antioxidant cellular responses (Espada et al. ). Hence, it is proposed that age-related cholinergic dysfunction or administration of muscarinic antagonist leads to downregulation of expression of antioxidant enzymes including SOD, CAT and GPx via decreased Nrf2 expression (Venkatesan et al. ; Lee et al. ). Our results are also consistent with these findings as evident by significant increased MDA levels and decreased antioxidant enzyme activities in rats injected with scopolamine alone. However, pre-administration of walnut for 28 days in Wal + Sco group significantly reduced MDA level which was accompanied with normalized activities of antioxidant enzymes suggesting the attenuation of scopolamine-induced oxidative stress in these rats. The health benefiting effects of diet have attracted attention because of the repeated evidences that plant foods rich in phenolic compounds are an important class of defensive antioxidants (Keller et al. ). As mentioned in the introduction section that walnuts also contain valuable antioxidant phenolic compounds (Scalbert et al. ) and because of these compounds, walnut stands first among twenty-five commonly consumed foods (Gunduc and El ). The phenolic compounds of walnut showed strong antioxidant activities (Colaric et al. ). The consumption of various polyphenol-rich foods increases antioxidant capacity of plasma (Schrag et al. ). Acute consumption of walnut reduced lipid peroxidation, increased plasma polyphenol concentration and total antioxidant capacity in healthy human volunteers (Gutierrez-Merino et al. ). The possible mechanism for this action may involve the hydroxyl groups of polyphenols, which have shown to form hydrogen bonding with the polar head of phospholipids at the membrane surface (Manach et al. ). This adsorption of polyphenols probably limits the access of aqueous oxidants to the membrane surface and their initial attack on that surface thereby inhibiting the oxidative damage and reducing the lipid peroxidation (Schrag et al. ). The reduced brain MDA levels in walnut-treated rats in the present study indicates inhibition of lipid peroxidation and reduced oxidative stress probably due to antioxidant nutrients present in walnut.
In present study, it is suggested that the scopolamine may have induced an increase in lipid peroxidation and decrease in antioxidant enzyme activities, leading in an increased generation of free radicals, which are not effectively scavenged and hence accumulated, resulting a negative correlation between oxidative marker and enzyme activities. The antioxidant composition of walnut may provide protection against scopolamine-induced free radicals and thus decrease lipoperoxidation as no correlation of MDA levels with enzyme activities were found in walnut-treated rats resulting in attenuation of adverse effects of scopolamine. These results indicate that the antioxidant profile of walnut may provide protection against oxidative stress-induced neurodegeneration and memory dysfunction. The aforementioned statement is reflected by the correlation of acetylcholine levels with acetylcholinesterase and % memory retention (Table 2 ). The walnut administered group demonstrated a positive correlation between acetylcholine and acetylcholinesterase activity in both hippocampus and frontal cortex indicating increased cholinergic neurotransmission in these memory specific brain regions which was not observed in controls. Increase neurotransmission can be reflected by increased substrate levels and increased activity of degradative enzyme (Korf ). The reactive species that are generated as a result of oxidative stress in age-related memory impairments contribute to dysregulation of membrane proteins and thus cause a cascade of intracellular events resulting in more reactive species and cellular death that ultimately induce an apoptotic cascade mechanism and lead to degeneration of neuronal cells including cholinergic neurons in Alzheimer’s disease (Feng and Wang ). It has been suggested that the combination of different antioxidants derived from plant products may act synergistically for proper protection of the cell components against oxidative stress (Morris et al. ). The non-enzymatic antioxidants (such as polyphenol and tocopherol) halt lipid peroxidation by reducing free radicals, but this results in the conversion of antioxidant itself into an antioxidant radical which is still harmful for the cell (Buettner ). This antioxidant radical, therefore, needs to react with another antioxidant to further decrease its reactivity until it is no longer a threat to the cell (Blomhoff ). Thus, the present study demonstrates that antioxidant properties of walnut may provide augmented effects on cholinergic function by reducing oxidative stress and thus improving memory performance. A suggested mechanism of present finding is summarized in Fig. 5 . Fig. 5 Schematic representation showing suggested mechanism of memory impairment following scopolamine administration ( a ) and memory improvement following walnut administration ( b ). Scopolamine which is a muscarinic antagonist induces age related memory loss by reducing cholinergic functions and causing oxidative stress. The supplementation of walnut shows antioxidative potential and thus attenuates the scopolamine-induced oxidative stress and cholinergic dysfunction. Walnut enhances serotonergic system by providing the essential amino acids and fatty acids. Reduced oxidative stress and improved memory function are observed following walnut supplementation in the present study
In conclusion, the results revealed that long term pre-administration of walnut intake attenuated memory impairment induced by oxidative damage and cholinergic dysfunction by scopolamine. Walnut has been shown to enhance serotonergic system (Haider et al. ). In the present study, however, the improved cholinergic function and reduced oxidative stress were also observed following walnut supplementation. These findings further support the notion that consumption of walnuts in daily diet may be beneficial for a healthy brain function.
