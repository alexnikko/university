Introduction
The occurrence of adverse events after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) for ST elevation acute myocardial infarction (STEMI) is still high in a real-life scenario [ , ]. Platelets production and reactivity are significantly enhanced in patients with acute coronary syndrome following intracoronary plaque rupture [ ]. Consequently, adequate platelet inhibition with dual antiplatelet therapy is a key therapeutic goal after PPCI, aimed at protecting against stent thrombosis and increased mortality. The majority of aggregometric studies focused on clopidogrel poor responsiveness. High on-aspirin platelet reactivity was less investigated. Recent investigations have shown a high frequency of aspirin poor responsiveness (APR), defined as high on-treatment platelet reactivity following aspirin loading in acute coronary syndrome patients [ ] and in patients with evolving acute myocardial infarction [ ]. Importantly, adjunctive clopidogrel therapy did not reduce cardiovascular events among aspirin-treated patients with incomplete inhibition of thromboxane biosynthesis [ ].
Aspirin resistance has been explained by a combination of clinical, biological, and genetic properties affecting platelet function. The most important clinical causes of aspirin resistance include lack of patient adherence, non COX-1 mediated thromboxane A2 synthesis, increased activity of alternate platelet activation pathways and interference of aspirin action by other drugs [ ]. Moreover, there are no criteria for distinguishing true resistance from treatment failure [ ]. Some authors even suggested that it does not exist because it is usually caused by noncompliance of aspirin intake or consumption of inadequate doses of aspirin. [ ]. However, the majority of authors have suggested a relation between high platelet reactivity after clopidogrel and/or aspirin and increased rate of ischemic events in acute coronary syndrome patients [ , , , , , , ]. Moreover, APR appeared to be an independent predictor of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with acute coronary syndrome [ ].
Identification of APR has been shown to be a useful tool to identify patients at high risk for recurrence of vascular events [ ], acute coronary syndrome [ ] or cerebrovascular events [ ]. Marcucci et al. have shown that APR was a significant and independent predictor of MACE in patients with STEMI undergoing primary PCI [ ]. However, other studies were not able to detect a relationship between APR and clinical outcomes [ , ].
There is evidence that 200–300 mg aspirin maintenance dose might improve the effectiveness of platelet inhibition compared to a canvential daily dose of 100 mg [ ].
However, no benefit with respect to the cardiovascular outcomes was documented in acute coronary syndrome patients [ , , ]. There is also a lack of data regarding the clinical consequences of APR in patients with acute myocardial infarction, who are the highest-risk subgroup for acute stent thrombosis and adverse outcome. The present substudy aimed at investigating the impact of laboratory-determined APR, combined with aspirin dose modification, on clinical outcomes in STEMI patients undergoing PPCI.
Methods
Patient Population
We analyzed 961 patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) enrolled in the ART-PCI trial (trial registration number: ISRCTN64082539 - http://www.controlledtrials.com/ISRCTN64082539 ) between February 2008, and June 2011. The design and results of the trial have been described previously [ ]. The flow of patients included in the ART-PCI trial is shown on Fig. 1 . The research protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Clinical Centre of Serbia. All participants gave their informed consent in writing. Fig. 1 Flow of patients included in the ART-PCI trial, TPR = on-treatment platelet reactivity, test 1 (24 h following the loading dose), test 2 (7 days following the loading dose), LD = loading dose, MD = maintenance dose, ADP-HS = ADP - high sensitivity test
Multiple Electrode Platelet Aggregometry
Multiple electrode aggregometry has been performed using the impedance aggregometer (Multiplate analyzer, Dynabyte GmbH, Munich, Germany). Whole blood (test 1, Fig. 1 ) was sampled 24 h after the loading dose. In patients who received the IIb/IIIa inhibitor tirofiban blood samples were obtained at least 24 h after the completion of tirofiban infusion. Second test (test 2, Fig. 1 ) was sampled 5–7 days after aspirin dose tailoring. ASPI test was used to analyze the effect of aspirin on platelet reactivity. Aggregation was continuously recorded for 6 min after arachidonic acid (final concentration 0.5 mM/L). Reported intra-assay precision was 7.5 % while inter-assay precision was 8.7 %. TRAP test reflects a direct activation of the thrombin receptor using the thrombin receptor activating peptide (final concentration 32 μM/L). Results were expressed as aggregation units (U). Arachidonic acid-induced whole blood aggregation in the upper quintile of the ASPI values was linked with APR. ASPI values in the lower quintile of patients were linked with aspirin high responsiveness (AHR). The same method was used in another Multyplate trial assessing patients with drug-eluting stents [ ].
End Points and Definitions
The ART-PCI specified co-primary end points were: major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), as an efficiency composite end point, and serious bleeding as a key safety end point. MACE comprised death, nonfatal infarction, ischemia-driven target vessel revascularization and ischemic stroke. Our secondary end points were: definite stent thrombosis, individual components of MACE and total bleeding. Nonfatal infarction was defined as the presence of: (a) recurrent ischemic chest pain longer than 20 min; (b) ST deviation >0.1 mV or new pathognomonic Q waves (0.04 s or longer) in at least two contiguous electrocardiographic leads, and (c) increase of cardiac troponin above the upper reference limit. Stroke, classified as ischemic or hemorrhagic by computed tomography, was defined as a new onset of focal or global neurological deficit lasting over 24 h. Definite stent thrombosis was defined according to the Academic Research Consortium definition as an angiographic or autopsy confirmation of thrombus that originates in the stent or in the segment 5 mm proximal or distal to the stent with presence of the acute coronary syndrome within a 48 h time window. Serious bleeding was defined as type ≥3 bleedings in accordance with the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) definition, not related to coronary artery bypass graft surgery [ ]. Therefore, bleeding was defined as an overt non-coronary artery bypass graft surgery-related bleeding with hemoglobin drop of ≥3 g/dL, any transfusion with overt bleeding, cardiac tamponade, bleeding requiring surgical intervention for control or bleeding, bleeding requiring intravenous vasoactive agents, intracranial bleeding, intraocular bleed compromising vision or fatal bleeding.
Patients were followed-up for adherence to antiplatelet therapy and adverse events at 30 days after enrollment by scheduled telephone interviews and/or outpatient visits. Interviewers were blinded to the results of platelet aggregation. An independent Clinical Event Committee adjudicated the occurrence of major events and serious bleeding.
Statistical Analysis
Assuming the number of low responders to 300 mg aspirin of 15 % (6.5:1 ratio of responders to LRs) and 0.12 versus 0.05 proportion of predicted 30-day MACE, respectively, the sample size of 931 patients provided 80 % power to detect the superiority relative to the primary end point of 30-day MACE at a 2-sided significance level of 0.05.
Continuous variables were expressed as mean ± SD or median values with 25th and 75th quartiles, whereas categorical variables were expressed as frequency and percentages.
Analysis for normality of data was performed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Baseline differences between groups were analyzed using Student t-test or Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables, and Chi-square test for categorical variables. Data for patients who died before the end of the follow-up were censored at the time of death. Univariable logistic regression model was used to identify baseline differences between groups.
Multivariable logistic regression was performed to determine the influence of APR on outcomes. Adjustment for differences in baseline characteristics and variables that are known to influence platelet reactivity was performed using propensity score for APR, calculated from the multivariable logistic regression. The IBM SPSS software version 19 was used for statistical analysis. Two-sided p value <0.05 was considered significant for all analyses.
Results
The median value for the ASPI test at 24 h after the loading dose of aspirin was 58.7 U (interquartile range 39.7, 73.7). The cut-off value for the upper quintile of patients was 39.0 U. Baseline characteristics of patients with respect to the response to 300 mg aspirin loading dose are shown in Table 1 . Compared with aspirin sensitive patients (quintiles 1–4 patients), APR patients (upper quintile patients, n = 190) presented more frequently with diabetes, anterior myocardial infarction, heart failure at admission, renal dysfunction and suboptimal final TIMI flow. APR patients had also higher values of heart rate and leukocytes at presentation, as well as lower values of systolic blood pressure and ejection fraction. The cut-off value for the lower quintile of patients was 15.5 AU/min. Compared with quintiles 2–5, aspirin high responders (AHR, lower quintile patients, n = 193) had higher values of heart rate, creatine kinase, hemoglobin, leukocyte count and ejection fraction. Those patients also had more frequent heart failure at admission, renal dysfunction, and were treated more frequently with glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor tirofiban.

Overall, APR was detected in 190 of 961 (19.8 %) patients. Thirty-nine of 190 (20.5 %) APR patients were not candidate for dose modification because of the exclusion criteria. Therefore, 151 patients were treated with aspirin 300 mg. Second assessment of platelet reactivity revealed 33/151 (22.0 %) poor responders to 300 mg aspirin maintenance dose. Therefore, dose modification reduced the total number of aspirin poor responders almost 5-fold (from 151 to 33). However, 72/190 (37.9 %) patients (33 APR patients on 300 mg aspirin maintenance dose and 39 patients not modified because of the exclusion criteria) were not converted to aspirin responders.
Frequency of the efficacy and safety end points among APR group, including tailored patients, and aspirin sensitive group are shown in Table 2 .

APR patients had higher unadjusted mortality, definite stent thrombosis and a trend toward more serious bleedings. However, after adjustment for significant baseline differences between groups, no differences were found with respect to the efficacy end points. Furthermore, the rates of 30-day serious bleeding (primary end point, adjusted OR 1.92, 95 % CI 0.79-4.63, p = 0.16), total bleeding (secondary end point, adjusted OR 1.31, 95 % CI 0.63-2.75, p = 0.45) and blood transfusions (secondary end point, adjusted OR 1.80, 95 % CI 0.49-6.64, p = 0.37) were not higher in APR group, compared with responders to aspirin.

There were no significant differences between groups with regard to the efficacy and safety end points. Specifically, AHR was not linked with an increased rate of bleeding.
Discussion
In the present substudy, PPCI patients were classified according to the quintiles of ASPI test values determined at least 24 h after the loading dose of aspirin. Compared with aspirin sensitive patients, patients with APR (highest quintile group) more frequently had diabetes, anterior myocardial infarction, heart failure at admission, renal dysfunction and suboptimal final TIMI flow. Patients with AHR (lowest quintile group) had reduced values of creatine kinase, leukocytes, heart rate and systolic blood pressure. Compared with aspirin sensitive patients, the rates of 30-day efficacy and safety primary end points did not differ significantly neither in patients with APR whose maintenance dose was tailored in all suitable patients, nor in patients with AHR. Therefore, with respect to the efficacy end point, APR in combination with dose tailoring was not inferior compared with aspirin sensitive patients. Additionally, with respect to the safety end point, neither APR modified by tailoring nor AHR were associated with more serious bleeding.
The rate of APR in our trial of 19.8 % is in line with the finding that aspirin poor responsiveness is more prevalent in patients with acute coronary syndrome when compared with stable coronary artery disease patients [ , ]. Laboratory APR appeared to be more pronounced in women, smokers, patients with diabetes, older subjects and in patients with renal impairment [ , ]. In patients with acute myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, or patients undergoing coronary revascularization, the reported prevalence of APR has been as high as 50 % [ ].
It is well known that aspirin causes a dose-dependent inhibition of platelet thromboxane production since the inhibitory effect of daily low-dose aspirin is cumulative on platelet thromboxane [ ]. The observation of dose-dependent effects suggests that aspirin may exert antiplatelet properties through non–cyclooxygenase-1 pathways [ , ]. A majority of our APR patients were also poor responders to clopidogrel. Other authors have shown that nearly 50 % of APR patients were also resistant to clopidogrel, and that incidence of myonecrosis following elective PCI was 3 times higher in patients with dual antiplatelet poor response, compared to dual-sensitive patients [ ]. APR patients appear to have platelets that are more sensitive to ADP, which may partially explain the high prevalence of dual antiplatelet poor responsivenes in this population [ ]. Importantly, a recent meta-analysis of 20 studies showed that concomitant treatment with clopidogrel or tirofiban provided no clinical benefit to those patients identified as APRs [ ].
All trials trying to tailor antiplatelet regimen according to PR values failed. The majority of these studies were focused on clopidogrel [ , ]. Failure of clopidogrel tailoring to influence 30-day MACE in PPCI patients might be explained by the limitations to clopidogrel therapy including: large variations in inhibition of platelet aggregation, effectiveness depending on activation of active metabolite by the cytochrome P450 system, suboptimal onset of action in the acute setting and irreversible P2Y12 receptor binding. In contrast to the relatively short duration of treatment with double-dose clopidogrel in the CURRENT OASIS-7 trial [ ], we administered the tailored doses for 30 days after PPCI. In the GRAVITAS trial, the reduced rate of high on-treatment reactivity did not result in the reduction in the primary end point at 6 months [ ]. We have reduced the rate of APR 5-fold with the use of 300 mg aspirin daily, however APRs and aspirin sensitive patients did not differ with respect to efficacy end points in our trial. In addition, there is much evidence in the literature that patients with coronary artery disease and APR have a considerably higher incidence of post-PCI elevation in cardiac biomarkers [ ] and more frequent cardiovascular death and/or nonfatal events during the long-term follow-up [ , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ].
Neubauer et al. have treated APR with dose escalation from 100 mg daily to 500 mg daily, with adequate platelet response seen in all patients [ ]. Other authors have also recommended increasing the dose of aspirin to overcome APR [ , ]. Epidemiological studies, however, did not show any clinical benefit of an increased dose of aspirin on unselected patient populations [ ] or in patients with an acute coronary syndrome [ ]. Failure of aspirin dose modification to influence efficacy end points in some trials might be explained by the limitations of aspirin therapy. Incomplete platelet response to aspirin likely reflects a composite of processes. Since no single platelet activation pathway is responsible for all thrombotic complications, there is currently no optimal single treatment strategy proposed to overcome all thrombotic complications in patients with APR. The ongoing GLOBAL LEADERS trial is trying to remove aspirin from DAT after 1 month of treatment, and continue ticagrelor for the next 23 months in all comers after stent implantation. GEMINI ACS 1 trial is aiming to replace aspirin with oral rivaroxaban, combined with clopidogrel or ticagrelor in ACS patients. In case of noninferior results, these studies might provide an acceptable pattern of dealing with acute coronary syndrome patients proved to be poor responders to aspirin.
Opposite to some prior trials [ ], our results did not show that an increase in aspirin dose resulted in an increased rate of serious bleeding. It has been noted in the literature that aspirin appears to lack dose-responsiveness in its antithrombotic effects but does demonstrate dose-dependence for its side effects [ ]. Indeed, there is an agreement that gastrointestinal injury increases as aspirin dose exceeds the dosage required for the antiplatelet effect.
Conclusions
The majority of patients with APR according to ASPI test were suitable for aspirin dose modification after PPCI. With respect to the efficacy end point, the results of patients with APR, combined with aspirin dose tailoring in suitable patients, did not differ significantly from aspirin sensitive patients. Additionally, APR in association with an increase in aspirin dose did not result with increased rates of serious bleeding. Moreover, the rates of 30-day efficacy and safety primary end points did not differ in patients with AHR, compared with aspirin sensitive patients. However, since the number of patients who were tailored because of the APR was not large enough to investigate the effects of tailoring on 30-day outcomes, these results should be confirmed in a larger trial with the same end points.
Study Limitations
This report has several potential limitations. First, this is a single centre trial.
Second, there might be some unmeasured confounders that affect the association between APR and clinical outcomes. Third, the rate of bleeding might be influenced by interventional approach. We used the femoral approach in the majority of our patients.
Therefore, our results should not be generalized to patients who are treated exclusively by radial approach. We did not use bivalirudin in the acute phase of STEMI, which was proved to be associated with less bleeding complications, but a higher rate of stent thrombosis [ ]. Similarly, the rate of adverse thrombotic events might be affected by the type of stents used. Only 7 % of our patients were treated invasively with drug-eluting stents, therefore, our results apply mainly to patients with bare-metal stents. Additionally, thrombus aspiration was used only sporadically in the trial. Our results may be difficult to compare with other trials because there is a lack of standardized approach to the definition, optimal laboratory methodology, and clear cut-off values for defining APR in acute coronary syndrome patients. We investigated the prevalence of APR using the impedance aggregometer. Other platelet function tests, such as optical platelet aggregometry or flow cytometry, were not performed in this study. However, the impedance aggregometry which has been used in several prior investigations, showed good correlation with light transmission aggregometry as a gold standard [ ]. Compliance is a frequent limitation in any study investigating the efficacy of antiplatelet agents. In our trial, like in the study of Grundmann et al. [ ], aspirin had been given under supervision during the hospital stay. Since we did not measure plasma concentrations of aspirin and salicylate after discharge from hospital and because plasma half-life of aspirin is about 15 to 20 min, we controlled compliance by interviewing patients for adherence to therapy. Finally, our study was powered to assess the effect of treatment on composite events. The number of enrolled patients was not large enough to address the association between APR and stent thrombosis as well as other individual ischemic events. Similarly, the number of patients who were tailored because of the APR was not large enough to investigate the effects of tailoring on 30-day outcomes.
