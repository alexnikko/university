Introduction
Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic malignancy in developed countries and the second most common in developing countries, where cervical cancer tops the list. Clinical outcome depends on early intervention with accurate surgical staging and proper management. An overall 5-year survival of patients with surgical stage I disease is 85% or higher [ , ].
Surgical staging of endometrial Cancer has been proposed by the FIGO since 1988, but the extent of the surgery for endometrial cancer still remains controversial. In high-risk endometrial cancer, staging lymphadenectomy is acceptable and may have survival benefit, whereas its role in early-stage low-grade tumors is still debated. Endometrial cancer usually occurs in older women having associated co-morbidities like obesity, diabetes, hypertension, etc., in whom extended surgical procedures carry higher risks. One way to reduce surgical morbidity would be to perform extended staging procedures in those patients who are more likely to have lymph node metastases and avoid doing it in patients having a low probability of nodal spread. Such an approach would lead to lower morbidity without compromising the treatment outcome.
Determination of certain risk factors (tumor grade, myometrial invasion and size of the tumor) preoperatively or intraoperatively helps in predicting the lymph node involvement where lymphadenectomy is an appropriate treatment option [ ]. The concordance between the results of endometrial curettage and final histopathology specimen in grading of the tumor ranges from 36 to 96% [ , , ]. Whereas for the detection of the depth of myometrial invasion, imaging and intraoperative macroscopic examination reveal varying degrees of concordance with postoperative pathology, respectively, 78–85% and 81–91% [ , , ]. The grade of tumor and the depth of the myometrial invasion can be accurately determined by frozen section taken intraoperatively with accuracy rate varying from 58 to 98% for the grade and 54–95% for the depth of myometrial invasion [ , , , , , ]. This variation in accuracy between various centers underscores the need for validation of the procedure prior to its routine use for triaging patients for extended surgical staging.
Therefore, a study was undertaken to evaluate the role of the frozen section and its agreement to histopathology in determining the tumor grade and depth of the tumor invasion in carcinoma endometrium at our center.
Materials and Methods
A retrospective review of medical records of patients with suspected carcinoma endometrium, admitted in the Manipal Comprehensive Cancer Centre, Bengaluru, from January 2011 to October 2016 was done. A total of 185 patients’ records were appraised, of which 80 cases had a benign histology and thus were excluded from further analysis. Remaining 105 cases were considered for further analysis. Of these, 5 case reports were untraceable, thereby yielding a total of 100 cases for inclusion and analysis.
All patients with carcinoma endometrium underwent a complete clinical and radiological workup with relevant preoperative evaluation. Patients with uterus-confined disease then were subjected to Type I hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy by open or minimally invasive technique. The specimen was sent for frozen section analysis to assess the histological grade and depth of myometrial invasion.
Intraoperative frozen section assessment included fresh specimen sectioning followed by evaluation as per the CAP protocol by two pathologists experienced in gynecologic oncopathology. The technique included opening up of specimen in the midline, followed by the gross assessment of the tumor (whether arising from anterior wall, fundus, posterior wall or lower uterine segment); its extension into the endocervix and depth of myometrial involvement were noted. The specimen was then frozen to a temperature range of −24 to −29 °C, and multiple sections were taken, and grade of the tumor and depth of the tumor invasion were confirmed by microscopy.
Based on the report of frozen section, the patient underwent additional pelvic lymphadenectomy with or without para-aortic lymphadenectomy.
The criteria for pelvic lymphadenectomy were Grade 1 or 2 tumor with greater than 50% myometrial involvement. Grade 3 tumor. Endocervical extension of the tumor.
Para-aortic lymph node dissection was done for Grade 3 tumors with >50% myometrial invasion. Extra-uterine extension. Non-endometrioid histology (clear cell, mucinous, serous, carcinosarcoma, mixed type).
The final histopathology report obtained following surgery was compared with the report of frozen section taken intraoperatively.
Results
The mean age of the patients in the study was 60.80 ± 8.6 years (range 39–80, median of 61 years). As per the final histopathology report, majority (93%) were endometrioid adenocarcinoma. Non-endometrioid were carcinosarcoma (2%), clear cell (1%), mucinous (1%), papillary (1%), serous (1%) and undifferentiated (1%).
Tumor grading was comparable between frozen section versus histology across grades; majority were of grade 2 (66 vs. 70%) followed by grade 3 (18 vs. 19) and grade 1 (16 vs. 11) (Table 1 ). Table 1 Comparison of tumor grading by frozen section and histology of the study sample Frozen section grades Histology grades Total Grade 1 Grade 2 Grade 3 Grade 1 11 5 0 16 Grade 2 0 63 3 66 Grade 3 0 2 16 18 Total 11 70 19 100
Majority 74% showed <50% myometrial involvement by frozen section (vs 71% by histopathology) (Fig. 1 ). Fig. 1 Showing myometrial involvement by frozen section and histopathology of the study sample
The assessment by frozen section with final histopathological grading for grade 1, grade 2 and grade 3 was found to have a sensitivity of 100, 90 and 84.2% and a specificity of 94.3, 90 and 97.5%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values were 68.75, 95.4 and 88.8 and 100, 84.3 and 96.3%, respectively (Table 2 ). Table 2 Showing the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of frozen section with the histology grading Sensitivity (%) Specificity (%) Positive predictive value (%) Negative predictive value (%) Grade 1 100 94.38 68.75 100 Grade 2 90 90 95.45 84.375 Grade 3 84.2 97.53 88.88 96.34
The accuracy of pre-op biopsy with that of histological grading was 56% (Table 3 ; Fig. 2 ).

The overall agreement between both frozen section and histopathology for tumor grading and myometrial involvement was computed to 90 and 97%. On application of kappa statistics, the value was 0.794 with a standard error of 0.062 and P = 0.001, suggesting a significant and moderately high agreement between two methods. However, on application of kappa statistics for the level of agreement for myometrial involvement, the value was 0.925, with a standard error of 0.043 and P = 0.001, suggesting a significant and extremely high agreement between two methods (Table 4 ).

Discussion
Since 1988, surgical staging has become an integral part of the management of carcinoma endometrium. Though some surgeons are skeptical about the utility of intraoperative frozen section, its use for identifying high-risk patients has revolutionized the treatment strategy in carcinoma endometrium. Intraoperative frozen section can provide highly reliable data to guide intraoperative treatment decisions at institutions with appropriate pathology expertise.
Our study results showed that the assessment by frozen section with final histopathological grading for grade 1, grade 2 and grade 3 was found to have a sensitivity of 100, 90 and 84.2% and a specificity of 94.3, 90 and 97.5%, respectively. However, the positive and negative predictive values were 68.75, 95.4, 88.8 and 100%, 84.3% and 96.3%, respectively (Table 2 ). Similarly, a study by Turan et al. [ ] on accuracy of frozen section examination in endometrial cancer also revealed similar findings with a sensitivity and specificity of 89.3, 91.2 and 77.8 and 93.1, 96.1 and 99.5%, respectively, showing the accuracy of intraoperative pathologic evaluation in endometrial cancer being reasonably high.
The overall agreement between both frozen section and histopathology for tumor grading and myometrial involvement was computed to 90 and 97%. On application of kappa statistics, the value was 0.794 with a standard error of 0.062 and P = 0.001, suggesting a significant and moderately high agreement between two methods for tumor grading. However, on application of kappa statistics for agreement of myometrial involvement, the value was 0.925, with a standard error of 0.043 and P = 0.001, suggesting a significant and extremely high agreement between two methods. Similarly, this was also proved by a study by Morotti et al. [ ] of Italy; also overall accuracy of 81.8% with an overall concordance and agreement between frozen and permanent section of kappa = 0.75 add to the reliability similar to our study. The concordance in myometrial involvement was also discussed in a study by Wu et al. [ ] where FS was highly accurate for determining the depth of myometrial invasion with an overall concordance rate of 97.8%, higher than those reported in previous studies. Kumar et al. [ ] also proved this similar to our findings with a great agreement and concordance between FS and PS.
The accuracy of intraoperative FS has been discussed extensively in the literature, and the results are varied. Reported concordance rates between FS and PS range from 68 to 95% for tumor grade and from 72 to 95% for depth of myometrial invasion. However, some other studies did not find high concordance between FS and PS. Case et al. carried out a prospective blinded evaluation and found an accuracy rate of 58% in tumor grade and 67% in depth of myometrial invasion for FS, which correlated poorly with the final pathology [ , , , , ]. Papadia et al. [ ] reported that in 16% of 174 cases, FS underestimated the risk status for lymph node metastasis when compared with permanent section.
The greater agreement in our study for frozen section related to grade of the tumor and myometrial depth of invasion, suggesting that there was neither under- nor overtreatment of the disease having a significant result in the patient outcomes. However, the size of the tumor was not compared, as the data were inadequate. The concordance of the pre-op biopsy with the final histopathology was low, as most of the patients were referred with a pathology report after D&C elsewhere to our center.
Conclusion
Although frozen section sampling of the specimen has its own limitation, the information of grade and depth of myometrial invasion rendered through intraoperative frozen section generally correlates well with the final histopathology, thereby contributing to better surgical management and clinical outcome.
Overall, our study adds to a high concordance, extremely significant agreement between frozen section and histological grading by kappa statistics with high sensitivity for the same, and thus, the study adds on to the evidence favoring the reliance on frozen section.
