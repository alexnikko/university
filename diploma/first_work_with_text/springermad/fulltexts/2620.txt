Introduction
One of the physiological parameters of utmost importance in animals is the blood (Hesser ; Rey Vazquez and Guerrero ). It involves the evaluation of the total red blood cell counts (RBC), total white blood cell counts (WBC), hemoglobin content (HGB), packed cell volume (PCV), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) (Campbell ; Mmereole ), and many more. Normal hematological parameters vary in different fishes, ages, sexes, and stages of sexual maturity (Golovina ; Luskova ; Hrubec et al. ; Gabriel et al. ; Noga ). In addition, hematological parameters are closely related to the response of the animal to the environment; hence, the environment where fishes live exert significant influence on its hematological characteristics (Barton ; Kori-Siakpere et al. ; Gabriel et al. ; Solomon and Okomoda ).
Hematological parameters are often used as an important index for the assessment of the health status of the fish (Ruane et al. ; Okomoda et al. ). This is because it gives the possibility of knowing the physiological conditions within the fish long before an outward manifestation of a detrimental condition (Shah and Altindag ). Hence, there is need to establish the normal hematological reference ranges of fishes prior to their utilization in disease diagnosis or as prognostic tools in health management (Adeyemo et al. ). This is particularly important for newly domesticated fishes from the wild and novel hybrid crosses of intra/intergeneric origin targeted towards commercialization.
Despite the long history of the culture of the Asian catfish Pangasianodon hypophthalmus (Sauvage, 1878) and African catfish Clarias gariepinus (Burchell, 1822), intergeneric crosses between these fishes were just recently reported (Okomoda et al. , ). The resultant progenies of some of the hybrid cross (♀ C. gariepinus × ♂ P. hypophthalmus ) had a positive heterosis for growth when compared to the pure line crosses. In view of the popularity of the putative parent and the perceived aquaculture potential of the novel hybrid, this study was designed to obtain basic knowledge of the normal hematological reference range for the progenies of the novel hybrids. Assessment of these hematological parameters would provide some useful information for future researches associated with stress, disease, and environmental imbalances in these fishes.
Materials and methods
Fingerlings of C. gariepinus (♀CH × ♂CH), P. hypophthalmus (♀PH × ♂PH), and the reciprocal crosses Pangapinus (♀PH × ♂CG) and Clariothalmus (♀CG × ♂PH produced Clarias-like and Panga-like morphotypes) were obtained from the same breeding history following the method described by Okomoda et al. ( ). After 2 months of culture in re-circulatory aquaculture system, healthy fingerlings were tranquilized with 150 mg/L solutions of tricaine methanesulphonate (MS222) (Wagner et al. ) and blood was collected from the caudal peduncle by using a needle fitted with a 1 cm 3 /mL heparinized syringe. Blood of two or three fishes was pooled to obtain enough blood samples for ten replicates used for the hematological analysis (Note: population size of the various groups of fish varied based on the number of fish whose blood was pooled for each replicate). The collected blood was placed in coded 1.5 mL heparinized plastic tubes and stored on ice (Campbell and Murru ). Packed cell volume (PCV) was assayed by microcentrifugation in standard heparinized microhematocrit at 3500× g for 10 min (Barros et al. ). Hemoglobin concentration (Hb) was determined through the cyanmethemoglobin procedure adopted by Drabkin ( ). The number of red blood cell (RBC) and white blood cell (WBC) were, however, evaluated microscopically in an improved Neubauer hemocytometer chamber after dilution with an appropriate diluent (i.e., Hayem solution and Turk solution for RBC and WBC, respectively) (Barros et al. ). Mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) were calculated for each sample according to the formula adopted by Klinger et al. ( ) as shown below: $$ \mathrm{MCV}=\frac{\mathrm{PCV}\times 1000}{\mathrm{RBC}\times {10}^{12}} $$ where PCV Packed cell volume RBC Red blood cell count $$ \mathrm{MCH}=\frac{\mathrm{Hb}\left(\mathrm{g}.{\mathrm{L}}^{\hbox{-} 1}\right)}{\mathrm{RBC}\times {10}^{12}.{\mathrm{L}}^{\hbox{-} 1}} $$ where Hb Hemoglobin concentration RBC Red blood cell count $$ \mathrm{MCHC}=\frac{\mathrm{Hb}\left(\mathrm{g}.{\mathrm{L}}^{\hbox{-} 1}\right)}{\mathrm{PCV}\left(\mathrm{L}.{\mathrm{L}}^{\hbox{-} 1}\right)} $$
Descriptive statistics of the data collected were analyzed using mini tab 14 computer software to obtain the reference interval and the means of the hematological parameters. This was followed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and when significant ( P < 0.05) differences were observed, data were separated using Fisher’s least significant difference.
Result and discussion
Generally, the ranges of hematological parameters in this study were quite broad in all the fishes studied despite using healthy and active fingerlings of similar size raised in a good and suitable culture condition (Tables 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 ). Adeyemo et al. ( ) had earlier opined that many blood parameters have quite stable index values. This is because the fish maintain normal physiological standards by altering certain physiological mechanisms in compensation. Similar wide ranges have however been reported in other studies involving pure line fish or their hybrids with other fishes (Groff and Zinkl ; Rainza-Paiva et al. ; O’Neal and Weirich ; Ezeri ; Orun and Erdemli ; Fernandes and Mazon ; Adeyemo et al. ; Gabriel et al. ; Angelica et al. ). This study further reveals that there were far more RBCs in the peripheral circulation of the fishes examined compared to values of WBC. Norousta and Mousavi-Sabet ( ) had opined that erythrocytes are the most dominant blood cell in a vast majority of fish species.

According to Blaxhall and Daisley ; MyDr ( ), Sunmonu and Oloyede ( ), RBC, Hb, and PCV, are considered good indicators for diagnosing anemic conditions in fish. They are also thought to be indicators of secondary responses to environmental irritants (Adeyemo et al. ). A significant decrease in the value of these hematological parameters could give a reliable index of a stress sources (Rainza-Paiva et al. ; O’Neal and Weirich ). The studies reported by KoriSiakpere and Ubogu ( ), and Ogunji et al. ( ) had suggested that many parameters of the juvenile hybrids HeteroClarias ( Clarias anguillaris L. x Heterobrancus bidorsalis L. ) were similar and within normal values ranges of the pure line crosses. With exception of Panga-like Clariothalmus, other hybrid fingerlings in this study were similar to those reported for the pure crosses too (Table 6 ). The Panga-like Clariothalmus could be said to be in an anemic condition compared with their co-hybrid progeny as well as the pure line. This finding partially justifies the assumption of low fitness made by Okomoda et al. ( ) for the same hybrid when low tolerance to a 24-h anoxia condition was observed for some progenies of the cross. The reduce capacity for oxygen uptake as demonstrated in this study must have been responsible for the high mortality in the low-dissolved oxygen environment. However, dissimilarity of the progenies of the reciprocal crosses of this study in terms of hematological parameters and perceived performance under stressful conditions as reported in the referenced study may be linked to the different pattern of inheritance in the fish as well as evidence of genetic compatibility in the Panga-like Clariothalmus.

Similar to oxygen-related blood parameters in this study, the WBC in the Panga-like Clariothalmus was observed to be less than the other crosses. MyDr ( ) had opined that low WBC counts could indicate many possible medical conditions. This is because they are the main cells involved in defense in the fish (Blaxhall and Daisley ; Sunmonu and Oloyede ); hence, low values of these cells could indicate vulnerability to stress and infection. It could be concluded that the immune system and the ability of the Panga-like Clariothalmus to prevent infection as well as transport/distributes antibodies may be lower compared to the other crosses.
The other hematological parameters such as MCV, the MCH, and the MCHC showed some resemblance and variance with the results obtained in the evaluated primary hematological parameters (i.e., RBC, PCV, and Hb). Generally, these parameters are mathematical derivatives of the primary hematological analysis; hence, depending on the relation of derivation, they could be directly or inverse proportion to the primary parameters. A higher level of MCH in fish is an indication of a good volume of hemoglobin in the blood (Gabriel et al. ); hence this implies a good oxygen transportation system and as such a healthier fish. The higher level of MCH in the fish with Panga maternal origin could, therefore, be an indication of an efficient oxygen transport system compared to those of the Clarias maternal origin. This could also be related to the large respiratory surface area in the former as compared to the latter which is an adaptation for a more efficient oxygen uptake (Unpublished data of the authors). Galis and Barel ( ), Moron and Fernandes ( ), Fernandes and Mazon ( ) had earlier suggested that exclusive water-breathing fishes have larger gill respiratory surface which ensures efficient oxygen transport and hence, survival in a low oxygen environment. Fishes which undergo aerial respiration on the other hand (like the Clarias-like fishes in this study) have reduced gill surface area; hence, this compensated by the presence of accessory breeding organs (Schottle ; Dubale ; Carter ; Hughes and Morgan ). However, the reduce MCH of Panga-like Clariothalmus observed in this study despite the possession of large gill surface area further justify inherent reduce fitness hypothesized. This is in contrast to the finding of KoriSiakpere and Ubogu ( ) on the comparative studies of juvenile heteroclarias and their pure line crosses.
It is important to state that the reference ranges and mean values of hematological parameters for the fingerlings of pure C. gariepinus recorded for this study (Table 1 ) vary from the reported works of Ogunji et al. ( ), Gbore et al. ( ), Ochang et al. ( ), Omitoyin ( ), KoriSiakpere and Ubogu ( ), Sunmonu and Oloyede ( ) on fingerlings and juvenile of the same species raised under different experimental and field conditions. Similarly, the finding of this study is also not in consonant with the finding of feral adults of C. gariepinus from the Nile River (Sabiri et al. ), and Southeastern Nigeria (Ezeri ). Adeyemo et al. ( ) had reiterated the fact that hematological parameters of fingerlings African catfish had significantly diverse mean values (could be lower or higher) when compared with those of the adults. Orun et al. ( ), Fernandes and Mazon ( ) had also opined that blood profiles could vary with environmental factors, hence, that could be the reason for the variation between the result of this study under laboratory conditions and values reported for juvenile C. gariepinus from the different field condition of the referenced studies. A similar conclusion can be made for the blood parameters for P. hypophthalmus in this study (Table 5 ) when compared to the reports of Sirimanapong et al. ( ). In conclusion, the hematological parameters of this study are suggestive that the Panga-like Clariothalmus progenies would be less fit compared to the other progenies, hence could be vulnerable to water imbalances and susceptible to disease and parasite infestation. The baseline information established in this study could be used as an important future reference standard for studies on physiological, pathological, and toxicological tolerance of the fish under laboratory condition.
