Introduction
Stroke is the second most common cause of death, the primary cause of dependency, creates a huge societal burden and costs billions to the global economy in health and social care costs [ , ]. A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is an ischaemic brain attack with focal cerebral or retinal symptoms that last under 24 h, usually less than 1 h [ ]. Although patients with minor (non-disabling) stroke differ slightly from those with TIA as signs and symptoms last more than 24 h, minor stroke patients are assessed and treated similarly to TIA patients to prevent a further disabling stroke, myocardial infarction or death [ , , ]. Approximately 20–40% of people have a warning TIA or minor ischaemic stroke shortly before they have a major disabling stroke [ ]. The risk of stroke after TIA is between 3 and 10% at 2 days, and 9–17% at 90 days [ , , , , ], and this is placing an ever increasing burden on health care systems. Longitudinal cohort studies have shown that the risk of cardiovascular events remains high (≤44%) 10-year post-TIA or stroke [ , ]. In addition to preventative measures, reducing stroke mortality and long-term disability through evidence-based acute and post-discharge treatments is essential to reverse the trend of increasing human, social and economic burden of this disease [ ].
Current guidelines for stroke/TIA recommend multifaceted interventions to aid in preventing recurrent events [ , , ]. In this regard, short-term exercise and education programs, administered within 2 weeks of TIA or minor stroke diagnosis, have shown to be beneficial in improving systolic blood pressure (≤13 mmHg), diastolic blood pressure (≤7 mmHg) and blood lipid profile (~0.5 mmol/L for total cholesterol) [ , , ]. Longer-term, there is evidence to suggest that these benefits are maintained up to 12-month post-intervention [17, 18]. However, there is a paucity of research investigating long-term clinical outcome measures, such as hospital readmission, surgical intervention and recurrent events [ ]. A recent study with patients with non-cardioembolic mild ischemic stroke demonstrated that individuals who engaged in a 6-month exercise training, salt restriction and nutrition advice program experienced fewer recurrent vascular events than those in a control group, over a median period of 2.9 years [ ].
Long-term follow-up data on TIA/minor stroke patients are needed to (i) inform best-practice healthcare guidelines, (ii) identify optimal strategies for reversing the rising economic burden of recurrent events and (iii) guide further prospective experimental research. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the long-term (̴3.5-year post-TIA/minor stroke) effect of an exercise and education program, employed soon after TIA/minor stroke diagnosis on (i) clinical outcome measures and (ii) the costs associated with inpatient and hospital admissions.
Methods
Participants
This retrospective research study involved 60 patients (male, n = 31; 71 ± 10 years), who had been previously diagnosed with TIA or minor (non-disabling) stroke between February and October 2011, and had been randomised to either an 8-week exercise and education program or to a usual care (pharmacological management) control condition within 2 weeks of initial diagnosis (see Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table ) [ , ]. TIA diagnosis was determined by a member of the clinical team and was based upon criteria from New Zealand’s stroke assessment and management guidelines [ ]. Clinical diagnosis of TIA was based on an ABCD 2 score ≥2, while minor stroke was based on the National Institute of Health Stroke Severity Scale (NIHSS) score ≤5. A neurologist made a further designation of probable or possible stroke/TIA subtype based on the patient’s history, examination and available imaging and laboratory studies using the TOAST criteria [ ]. Fig. 1 Participant recruitment
Participants were eligible to participate in the original randomised controlled trial if they had been diagnosed with their first TIA or minor stroke, if they lived within the local district health board catchment and if they did not meet exclusion criteria. Exclusion criteria were as follows: unstable cardiac conditions, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, severe claudication, oxygen dependence, significant dementia and inability to communicate in English or unable to take part in exercise. Participants complied with drug treatment and standardised therapy in accordance with stroke physician recommendations during the period of the intervention. Of the 60 patients recruited to the study, only one participant received intravenous thrombolysis in the form of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) as a part of their acute treatment.
The trial was approved by New Zealand’s Central Regional Health and Disabilities Ethics Committee and registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (Trial Registration Number: ACTRN12611000630910). Written informed consent was obtained prior to participation.
Procedures
The National Health Index number, a unique identifier that is assigned to every person who uses health and disability support services in New Zealand, was used, in December 2014, to access electronic health records for all previously recruited patients. This process was conducted by a Capital and Coast District Health Board (CCDHB) neurologist. Patient data was then coded by a CCDHB employee with no trial involvement to identify the number and type of clinical outcomes that occurred in the CCDHB public hospitals, including both inpatient and outpatient visits. Clinical outcomes assessed included the following: stroke classification (major stroke [ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke], minor stroke, TIA), death, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, vascular surgery (coronary artery bypass graft [CABG], carotid endarterectomy, angiogram), ischaemic heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, congestive heart failure and hospital admissions. The medical records for each clinical outcome were reviewed by a CCDHB neurologist to confirm the diagnosis. A cost analysis was undertaken when a patient was (i) in the emergency department for more than 6 h or (ii) admitted to the inpatient hospital ward. The cost of each presentation was calculated using the Weighted Inlier Equivalent Separations (WIES) amount, which is a cost unit based on the disease-related group (i.e., stroke disease-related group includes ischaemic stroke, intra-cerebral haemorrhage) and the casemix (complexity of patient illness) used to fund public hospitals in New Zealand.
Statistical Analysis
Pearson chi-squared tests and independent samples t tests compared baseline descriptive statistics of exercise and control group participants. Following this, a series of one-way analyses of variance, whereby clinical outcome measures reported at follow-up (e.g., number of strokes, myocardial infarction, hospitalisations) were included as the dependent variable, the group (exercise vs. control) was included as the fixed factor and potentially pertinent baseline measures (i.e., number of participants with hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes, heart problems), as presented elsewhere [ ], were included as covariates. As the above covariates had no significant bearing on the clinical outcome measures, a series of independent samples t tests were used to compare the number of people who presented at hospital with a clinical outcome measure which was reported during the follow-up period, for each group (exercise vs. control). Levene’s test for equality of variance was used to determine whether the assumption of homogeneity of variance had been violated, while a Bonferroni correction factor was used to reduce the risk of type I error. Cohen’s d was used to identify the effect size, whereby 0.2, 0.5 and 0.8 represents a small, moderate and large effect [ ]. An identical analysis was used to assess the cost implications of patient visits to the hospital during the follow-up period.
The relative risk (RR), standard error of the log relative risk (SE) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated [ ]. Although RR does not imply causation, it is a useful measure to demonstrate an intended association between treatment and effect. A RR of 1.0 demonstrates that there is no difference in risk between the treatment (exercise and education) and control groups. A RR <1 means that the event is less likely to occur in the treatment group than in the control group, while a RR >1 means that the event is more likely to occur in the treatment group than in the control group. Lastly, as a marker of clinical significance, the number needed to treat (NNT) was calculated to estimate the number of patients who need to use the new treatment (exercise and education), rather than the standard treatment (usual care control group), to prevent one clinical outcome [ ].
Results
As previously demonstrated [ ], there were no between-group differences in demographic characteristics, stroke aetiology, history of CVD, lifestyle and medication use at baseline (all P > 0.05; Table 1 ). Table 2 summarises the number of patients who presented with clinical outcomes within the 3.5 ± 0.3 year follow-up period. During this period of assessment, participants randomised to the exercise and education intervention had significantly fewer recurrent strokes/TIAs than those in the control group ( P < 0.05; Table 2 ). Moderate to large effect sizes were reported for a number of outcome measures including the prevalence of recurrent strokes/TIAs, deaths and hospital admissions (Cohen’s d between 0.53 and 0.80; Table 2 , Fig. 2 ). Hospital admission costs were significantly lower for the exercise and education group ( n = 18; $9041 ± 15,080 NZD [~6000 ± 10,000 USD]) than the control group ( n = 23; $21,750 ± 22,973 NZD [~$14,000 ± 15,000 USD]) during the assessment period ( P < 0.05, Cohen’s d = 0.69). As shown in Table 3 , the RR for all markers of interest were <1, demonstrating that adverse events were less likely to occur in those randomised to the exercise and education intervention. In addition, the NNT to ensure a patient benefit was relatively low.

Discussion
This study demonstrated that patients who engaged in an exercise and education program soon after TIA/stroke diagnosis had fewer strokes and/or recurrent TIAs within the follow-up period than those patients who were provided usual care (control) treatment after their initial diagnosis. Furthermore, patients presented at hospital on fewer occasions, and hospital admission costs were, on average, lower for the exercise and education group than the control group during the follow-up period. These findings may be important when considering the long-term patient benefit and decreased economic burden associated with TIA and minor stroke patients engaging in an exercise and education program.
As reported elsewhere [ ], two patients in each group (exercise and education vs. control) experienced a recurrent TIA within 8 weeks of being randomised. When considering the longer-term follow-up data, which includes the statistics reported above, of the patients who took part in the exercise and education program, only three patients (10%) experienced a recurrent stroke or TIA during the 3.5-year follow-up period (Table 2 ). In contrast, 13 (43%) of the patients who were randomised to the usual care control group presented with a recurrent stroke or TIA. The statistical difference in the prevalence of ‘all’ strokes in the follow-up period is further supported by the large effect size, the small RR for the treatment (exercise and education) condition and the small number of patients required to demonstrate treatment benefit. When considering the latter, the present study suggests that for every three patients that engage in an exercise and education program rather than usual care, one patient will benefit. Encouraging trends were also evident when assessing the frequency of minor stroke and recurrent TIAs (Table 2 ); an interesting finding when considering that previous research has demonstrated high rates of TIA following an initial stroke/TIA episode [ , ]. The findings from the present study are in contrast to a recent meta-analysis which demonstrated no difference in the odds of stroke/TIA re-occurrence when patients engaged in a lifestyle management intervention compared to receiving usual care [ ]. The high heterogeneity of the meta-analyses’ study sample may offer some reasoning for this difference.
There are a number of reasons as to why those who participated in the exercise program may have a lower risk of reoccurring stroke. Exercise, for example, has been shown to (i) improve functional capacity by increasing aerobic fitness, strength, balance, flexibility and mobility; (ii) reduce the risk of cardio- and cerebrovascular disease by reducing blood pressure, and by improving blood lipid profile, glucose regulation, insulin sensitivity and anthropometric profile; and (iii) provide psychological benefits through improving quality of life, enabling physical independence and by reducing stress and anxiety [ , , , ]. Importantly, such physiological and psychological changes may also reduce the risk of other co-morbid conditions such as diabetes, obesity and metabolic syndrome.
The meta-analysis by Lawrence and colleagues [ ] has previously shown no significant differences in the odds of death between those partaking in lifestyle management interventions compared to those randomised to a usual care control group. The small number of studies investigated ( n = 4), the different lifestyle management interventions employed and the varying population groups assessed may be an underpinning reason for this finding. In our study, there does appear to be pragmatic benefit of implementing a secondary prevention exercise and education program soon after initial diagnosis as significantly fewer deaths occurred during the 3.5-year follow-up period (Tables 2 and 3 ). Based on the findings from our study, there is a pressing need for large, multi-site randomised controlled trials, with a significant follow-up period (>12 months) to ascertain the utility of lifestyle management interventions (i.e., exercise and education) in this population group. Our study emphasises the importance of implementing larger trials as despite the above favourable findings in terms of the prevalence of strokes/TIAs, death and hospitalisations; in total, there were slightly more cardiac-related complications (e.g., myocardial infarction, unstable angina, ischaemic heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, congestive heart failure) for those randomised to the exercise and education group ( n = 15) compared to the control group ( n = 11).
The present study provides preliminary evidence that early exercise and education engagement could significantly reduce the economic burden associated with recurrent vascular events post-stroke/TIA [ ]. This study has shown that the costs associated with hospital admissions were 141% higher in the usual care control group compared to those randomised to the exercise and education program. The difference in cost analysis is strongly associated with the number of hospital admissions during the follow-up period. In this study, 67% of patients in the exercise and education group presented at hospital, of which there were only 48 visits in total over a 3.5-year period. In contrast, 80% ( n = 24) of those individuals in the control group presented at hospital, of which there were 102 visits in total (Table 2 , Fig. 2 ). The moderate effect size and small number of patients required to demonstrate a treatment benefit (Table 3 ) provides further support for the implementation of an exercise and education program. When considering the time and cost of consultants, nurses, practitioners and technicians, the cost of imaging and equipment use (CT scans, etc.) and possible medicinal intervention [ ], a simple exercise and education intervention employed soon after diagnosis could have significant long-term financial benefit by reducing the number of follow-up hospital admissions.
Although the present study has shown favourable changes in specific clinical outcomes in those who engaged in the exercise and education program, it is pertinent to recognise the potential limitations of the study. First of all, this is a retrospective study with a small sample size. The original study by Faulkner and colleagues [ ] was designed and powered to assess the effect of an 8-week exercise and education program on short-term cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., blood pressure, total blood lipid profile), not long-term clinical outcome measures. Secondly, it is difficult to determine an exact cause and effect, as we did not monitor patients consistently during the follow-up period. For example, physical activity participation, nutrition, sleep and psycho-social markers of health were not assessed during the 3.5 year follow-up. Also, the relative risk data presented in this paper only describes an intended association between treatment and effect, and not causation. In addition, the research team were unable to ascertain pharmacological management during follow-up. Although previous research has shown no differences in medication at 12 months between an exercise and usual care control group [ ], we should not necessarily assume that this is the case at 3.5 years. It is also evident, retrospectively, that clinicians found it challenging to provide a specific stroke aetiology for a number of the participants (Table 1 ).
In conclusion, the present study has demonstrated that those patients who engaged in an exercise and education program soon after initial stroke/TIA diagnosis presented at hospital on fewer occasions, and experienced fewer recurrent strokes/TIAs and death, than those who received usual care over the course of a 3.5-year follow-up period. These findings, in combination with the lower financial implications, are highly pertinent when considering the long-term patient benefit and decreased economic burden associated with TIA and minor stroke patients engaging in an exercise and education program.
