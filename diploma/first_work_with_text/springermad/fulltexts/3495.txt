Introduction
Histamine receptors are a class of G protein coupled receptors that have been classified as; H1R, H2R, H3R, and H4R (Hill et al. ) among which H1R is responsible for causing allergic inflammation, Immune modulation and regulation of T cell function and auto-immunity (Jutel et al. ; Ma et al. ; Musio et al. ; Pedotti et al. ; Schaefer et al. ). Histamine influences its inflammation reaction by regulating its own receptor expression on endothelial cells (Schaefer et al. ). The signal transduction of H1R is typical for, and convergent with, that of other Gα q/11 protein-coupled receptors (Bakker et al. ; Brown et al. ). HIR activates phospholipase C, resulting in the catalysis of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate to inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol (DAG) which induces calcium ion release which is a trigger for symptoms of allergic response, vascular permeability and smooth muscle contraction. H1R also activates NF-κB in both a constitutive and agonist-dependent manner (Bakker et al. ) and induces granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin (IL)-8, IL-6 and IL-16 release from airway epithelial cells (Arima et al. ; Jeannin et al. ; Kanda and Watanabe ). H1R is effectively associated with the expression of some chemokines, and cytokines that is involved in inflammation (Matsubara et al. ; Caron et al. ). The CC chemokines, monocytic chemotactic protein (MCP) 1 and 3, RANTES and Eotaxin induced by Histamine H1 receptor suggests a prolonged inflammatory cycle, in the case of allergic rhinitis, between the cell that releases the histamine and their intensified migration to nasal mucosa (Fujikura et al. ). H1R plays a primary role in allergic rhinitis, urticaria, anaphylaxis and to a lesser degree, asthma (White ) and it also mediates inflammatory responses in human keratinocytes (Giustizieri et al. ). When the immune system overreacts to normally harmless substances in the environment, allergic reaction occurs as a result. This hypersensitivity occurs in various forms including atopic dermatitis, asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergies. The occurrence of allergy-related disorders has been increasing yearly. Especially in the case of food allergies where it has been estimated to have affected 4% of the adult population whilst 6% of children population (Venter et al. ). Many drugs have been developed such as immunosuppressants, antihistamines, and steroids to treat allergic disorders (Conen et al. ; Kim et al. ; Wong et al. ) Antihistamines effectively inhibit histamine-mediated symptoms, such as sneezing and nasal discharge, because they can block histamine (H1) receptors (Tarnasky and Van ; Wang et al. ). However, for alleviating H1 mediated disease symptoms, second generation H1R antagonist are more commonly used due to its selectivity and relatively lessened sedative effect. Thusly, we have selected the most popular and most commonly used second generation H1R antagonists to comparatively analyze and understand their binding pattern mechanisms and their quantum chemical attributes, to ascertain which of these commercial drugs is ideal for alleviating H1 mediated disease symptoms. However, although these drugs are effective, when taken for long periods, these drugs may have adverse effects such as cataracts, growth retardation, osteoporosis, diabetes, and hypertension (de Benedictis et al. ; Elphick and Southern ). Due to these potential problems, natural products may provide an alternative to effectively treat allergies with fewer adverse effects. Curcuma longa Linn ( Zingiberaceae ), has a rhizome called turmeric (given the name curry spice by the British), which has been widely consumed as a seasoning and used therapeutically to treat inflammatory disorders of respiratory and gastrointestinal systems in predominantly Asian countries such as India, Japan, Korea and China (Gilani et al. ; Srinivasan ). Turmeric has also been studied expansively for its pharmacological activities such as its anticancer, antioxidant, anti-microbial, neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects (Chandra and Gupta ; Lutomski et al. ; Rajakrishnan et al. ; Toda et al. ). Curcumin, the main active ingredient or compound, which is obtained from turmeric has been also claimed to be anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agent (Aggarwal et al. ; Balasubramanyam et al. ). Curcumin’s immunoregulatory activities has been extensively studied ever since they were first reported in 1999 (Antony et al. ). For example, curcumin attenuated allergic airway inflammation by regulating the balance of CD4þCD25þ regulatory T cells (Tregs)/T-helper (Th) in ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized mice (Ma et al. ). In allergic disorders, both turmeric and curcumin were found to ameliorate allergic contact dermatitis allergic rhinitis, food allergy, allergic conjunctivitis and asthma (Chung et al. ; Oh et al. ; Ringman et al. ; Thakare et al. ; Thompson and Tan ) through regulation of immune responses mediated by mast cells, IgE responses and Th2 responses, A cognate of T cell kinase ZAP70 in mast cells, Syk kinase, plays a crucial role in the IgE-dependent activation of mast cells. Syk kinase-dependent signaling events is inhibited by Curcumin in mast cells, which would result in broad beneficial effects, due to the suppression of multiple inflammatory mediators, which each play overlapping but distinct roles in the inflammatory response and thus might contribute to its antiallergic activity (Lee et al. ). Thus, we have selected the active main ingredient of Turmeric spice, Curcumin, as an alternative to the commercially produced second generation H1-receptor antagonists, for treatment of allergic symptoms.
Method and materials
Ligand preparations
Selected drugs were retrieved from Drug Bank (Wishart et al. ) and prepared using LigPrep wizard of Schrödinger suite (LigPrep, Schrödinger, LLC, New York, NY, 2017). Ionization state of these small molecules were generated at pH 7.0 ± 2.0 by using Epik (Shelley et al. ) for proper enumeration of tautomer and protonation states for better understanding in biological condition. Up to 32 possible stereoisomers per ligand were retained. By assigning bond order and bond angles, all the small molecules were minimized using OPLS3 (Harder et al. ) force field.
Protein preparation
The crystal structure of Histamine 1 receptor (PDB ID: 3RZE) was retrieved from Protein Data Bank (Berman et al. ) and prepared in protein preparation wizard (Madhavi Sastry et al. ) of Schrödinger maestro 11.2. Firstly, the protein was preprocessed by assigning bond orders, creating zero order bonds to metals and disulfide bonds. After removing water and adding Hydrogen bonds, the protein was preprocessed for review and modification, to be refined. By assigning H bond and keeping sample water orientation, the protonation states were optimized at neutral pH. Finally, a restrained minimization of the protein structure was performed using the default constraint of 0.30 Å RMSD and OPLS3 force field. Afterwards, the protein quality was checked in Ramachandran plot (Lovell et al. ) in protein preparation wizard.
Receptor grid generation and induced fit docking
Receptor grid was generated by specifying co-crystalized ligand. The default parameters were used to generate the grid for ligand docking. Glide induced-fit docking protocol (Sherman et al. ) was used for extensive accuracy of ligand docking. Prepared optimized ligands were introduced to Induced fit docking using the default parameters.
MM-GBSA calculation
The docked pose view files were introduced to Prime program (Prime, Schrödinger, LLC, New York, NY, 2017) for calculating the binding free energy employing MM-GBSA approach which is a physics-based method that computes the force field energies in implicit solvent of the bound and unbound molecules involved in the binding process. The MM-GBSA binding energy is calculated by using the Eq. 1 , where E denotes energy and includes terms such as protein–ligand van der Waals contacts, electrostatic interactions, ligand de solvation, and internal strain (ligand and protein) energies, using VSGB2.0 solvation model (Li et al. ) and OPLS3 force field. Residues within 5.0 Å of the ligand were allowed to relax throughout the minimization (minimization of all atoms in each residue) of the complex, keeping the rest of the structure fixed. $$\Delta {\text{G}}_{\text{binding}} = {\text{ E}}_{\text{complex}} - {\text{ E}}_{\text{protein}} - {\text{ E}}_{\text{ligand}} .$$ (1)
Quantum chemical calculations
Quantum chemical calculations have been performed by employing density functional theory (DFT) with B3LYP (Lee et al. ) method using 6-31G [d, p] basis set (Easton et al. ) in the Gaussian program (Frisch et al. ). Ligand optimization, Electronic energies, Enthalpy, Gibbs free energy of each compound were also investigated. Besides this, the dipole moments and drug polarizability has also been calculated. For observing molecular reactivity and stability, the frontier HOMOs, LUMOs and gap energies were calculated (Hoque et al. ; Parr and Zhou ).
P450 site of metabolism
Only the naturally-occurring compound curcumin (ID: DB11672), was undertaken to predict Site of metabolism, Intrinsic reactivity and Fe accessibility. The P450 Site of Metabolism (SOM) of selected compound was determined by induced fit docking on CYP2D6 isoform using the P450 Site of Metabolism module of Schrodinger Suite. Only intrinsic reactivity was determined for CYP3A4 isoform, based on ligand-based models to predict how a druglike compound is metabolized for CYP 3A4. Haloperidol (ID: DB00502), an FDA approved small molecule cytochrome substrate, was used in the role of a control.
Results and discussion
Quantum chemical calculation
Nowadays, quantum mechanics has reliable application in the study of electronic structure, wave function, modelling-simulation, vibrational spectra, IR spectra, ground state studies of an individual atom, NMR prediction and so on. Therefore, the frontier molecular descriptors such as HOMO (Highest occupied molecular orbital) and LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital), Gap energy, Hardness, Softness, can also be studied by employing quantum chemistry. The electronic energy, enthalpy and Gibbs free energy, along with the stoichiometry of selected drugs are reported in Table 1 . HOMO, LUMO, Gap energy, Dipole moment of those drugs are reported in Table 2 . Optimized structure, HOMO and LUMO plots are given in Figs. 1 and 2 , respectively. The lowest gap energy was found for DB09488 (Acrivastine) and DB11672 (Curcumin) which was calculated to be 0.05823 eV and 0.13329 eV, respectively.

Induced fit docking simulation and MM-GBSA calculation
In induced fit docking, both ligands and receptors are flexible. The glide induced fit docking has extra refinement features for advanced refinement and prediction of conformational changes within receptor active-site and minimization that proceeds to redock. Conformational changes are very crucial for accuracy of docking, which is why prime refinement and prediction is very necessary to ascertain accurate docking and characterizing of the binding sites. Ligand poses are ranked by glide score in an empirical function, which approximates ligand binding free energy. In this study; DB11672, DB04890, DB11614, DB09488, DB00557, DB00341, DB00341, DB00967 and DB00455 showed a glide score of − 12.111 kcal/mol, − 11.066 kcal/mol, − 11.974 kcal/mol, − 10.769 kcal/mol, − 12.076 kcal/mol, − 11.522 kcal/mol, − 11.094 kcal/mol and − 12.233 kcal/mol, respectively. The best ligand binding affinity was observed for DB00557 (Hydroxyzine), which was calculated to be − 140.491 kcal/mol. The details of docking results of selected candidates are reported in Table 3 . Among all docked complexes, the amino acid Tyr-431 was commonly found in H-bonding interaction except for in DB00341. However, interestingly the amino acid Trp-428 was found in pi–pi stacking interaction amongst all docked complexes. Therefore, Tyr-108 was also found to form pi-cation bonding in the complexes except for in the cases of DB00455 and DB11672. The most prominent interaction, however, was found for DB11672 (Curcumin), which interacts with Lys-191, Lys-179, Thr-194, Asp-107, Tyr-108, Tyr-431 by H bonding formation. Detailed ligand–receptor interaction diagrams are given in Fig. 3 . Please find their docked poses in Supplementary Fig. 5.

P450 site of metabolism
The enzymes of cytochrome p450 brings about the detoxification of drugs and other foreign compounds by undergoing various reactions such as hydroxylation, dealkylation, and double-bond oxidation (Liu et al. ). A metabolic reaction can ensue at a highly reactive site of a molecule, on the condition that it is properly oriented within the CYP enzyme to interact with the reaction center. Therefore, to understand the crucial aspects of iron accessibility, intrinsic reactivity to form combined SOM (site of metabolism), we performed induced fit docking using CYP2D6 isoform, as well as, CYP3A4 isoform for the compound Curcumin (Fig. 4 a) and the Control, Haloperidol (Fig. 4 b). Choice of CYP2D6 isoform, which is the most drug-metabolizing enzyme isoform aside from CYP3A4, allows for greater recognition of substrates due to its higher selectivity (Rydberg and Olsen ). Detailed scoring parameters have been given in Fig. 4 a, b for the label atoms, with the accessibility of the atoms to the iron. This is defined as the natural logarithm of the number of poses for an atom, in which the atom was within 5 Å of Fe. Larger values indicate greater accessibility. As seen below, Curcumin (Fig. 4 a) shows larger values in comparison to Haloperidol (Fig. 4 b), thusly indicating greater accessibility. CYP3A4 isoform, the most prevalent CYP enzyme, which catalyzes the metabolism of nearly half the drugs on the market (Koe et al. ), had only its intrinsic reactivity assessed because ligand-based models have been found to provide satisfactory prediction, with the intrinsic reactivity playing a significant role (Rydberg and Olsen ). Label atoms with the intrinsic reactivity for 3A4, were calculated with Hammett and Taft methodology. Positive values are more reactive, whilst negative values are less reactive. As shown in the figures below, certain label atoms of Curcumin express greater positive values indicating that they’re relatively more reactive in comparison to its control’s (Haloperidol) label atoms, which is therefore relatively less reactive. In the case of Combined SOM, all three annotations are displayed at the same time, in graphical form. The Fe-accessibility is indicated by a set of green rays drawn out from the atom to a given maximum length. Each full-length ray represents one unit of accessibility, so the number of full-length rays is the integer part of the score. Thus, the remaining partial ray represents the decimal part of the score. The circles represent the overall score and the intrinsic reactivity. The radius of the circle is proportional to this score. The intensity of the red color of the circle is proportional to the intrinsic reactivity. The blue perimeter indicates whether the atom passed the filtering stage, which has cutoffs for the intrinsic reactivity and the number of poses. Thusly, as illustrated down below, Curcumin displays relatively greater Fe-accessibility (greater set of green rays), increased overall score and intrinsic reactivity (greater radius, intensity and number of red circles), and a greater number of label atoms that passed the filtering stage (greater number of blue perimeters around circles) compared to that found with the control (Haloperidol). Overall, these findings indicate that Curcumin is potentially safer (relatively less toxic), compared to the FDA approved drug Haloperidol (ID: DB00502).

Conclusion
From our study, we have discovered the common binding sites residues of H1R, which are involved in interaction with FDA approved commercialized drugs which might be useful for future drug target site. Those active sites have also been shown to be inhibited by our proposed H1R antagonist, curcumin. Amongst the FDA approved drugs, DB00557 (Hydroxyzine), exhibited the best binding affinity. However, the best FDA approved drugs evaluated by in silico docking approach has been found to be less reactive than curcumin as reported in Table 2 . Besides this, the dipole moment of DB11672 (Curcumin) has found to be greater than DB00557 (Hydroxyzine), as reported in Table 2 . From ligand interaction analysis DB11672 (Curcumin) emphasized six H bonding network with receptor’s active sites, whereas DB00557 (Hydroxyzine), interacts with active site residues by four hydrogen bonding networks. Based on all the evidences given above, this study concludes with the firm belief that use of HIR inhibitor from naturally occurring compound Curcumin, is seen to be a comparatively more effective and a therapeutically more significant cure for H1R mediated allergic symptoms based on In-Silico approach.
