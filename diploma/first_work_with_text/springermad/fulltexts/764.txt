Introduction
Primary immunodeficiency diseases (PID) are a heterogeneous group of congenital defects in the immune system which lead to susceptibility to infections, as well as autoimmunity, lymphoproliferation, and atopy. Even in monogenic PID, penetrance can be variable resulting in heterogeneity in phenotype. The prevalence of disease-modifying factors is poorly understood in PID patients, which further confounds the ability to understand the prognosis of this population. Thus, the frequency of modifiable risks like underweight or obese body habitus which may alter the risks of complications in PID are important to define across the population of PID patients.
Historically, failure to thrive (FTT) and poor weight gain have been described as a textbook presenting feature of numerous PID. Due to this, FTT has been incorporated in the various “warning signs” systems developed to screen for PID in pediatric patients and weight loss has been incorporated in the adult criteria [ , ]. These criteria were based on expert consensus; however, additional analyses of pediatric patients with PID have supported failure to thrive one of the main clinical predictors of immunodeficiency in children with high specificity and sensitivity [ , , ]. FTT and poor weight gain in PID are multifactorial and have been associated with increased metabolic demand, decreased oral intake, and poor nutrient absorption due to inflammatory or infectious GI disease [ , , ].
Conversely, little is known about the significance of obesity in PID. In western countries over the last decades, the rate of obesity has increased significantly over the last half-century [ , , , ]. Obesity is a recognized worldwide health problem due to increased obesity-associated health risks including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. However, little is known about the overall prevalence of obesity in the PID population and how differences in body weight may affect the presentation of PID. In addition to the adverse effects of diabetes on immune function, there have been several demonstrations of subtler immune anomalies due to obesity. Obesity has been associated with decreased natural killer cell numbers and function as well as lymphocyte proliferation in response to mitogens [ , , , , ]. Increased adiposity has been linked to baseline adipocyte dysfunction and immune dysregulation, resulting in higher circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNFα, IL-6, and IL-18 [ ]. This process is complex and depends upon tissue infiltrating lymphocytes and macrophages [ ], and it is unclear to what extent it would be altered in patients with various forms of PID.
Herein, we present the first examination of the prevalence of underweight and obese status in adult and pediatric PID populations using data from the US Immunodeficiency Network (USIDNET) Database. Additionally, we sought to understand the relationship between underweight and obese body weight and disease complications in PID patients.
Methods
We performed a retrospective analysis of the USIDNET for all patient records containing complete information on body mass index (BMI) data. The USIDNET is a research consortium that maintains a patient-consented registry of clinical, molecular, and laboratory data from primary immunodeficiency patients in North America [ ]. Collection of patient data for this database requires Institutional Review Board approval from the patient’s home institution, and all patients provided informed consent for inclusion of their clinical data into the database.
Our search resulted in 1408 records of PID patients with BMI information. Observations which did not contain a valid age, height, weight, or gender were censored, leaving 1167 patient records for analysis. Patient age at data entry was used to categorize patients into adult (age > 20) and pediatric (age 2 to 20 years) groups for further analysis. Age cutoffs for inclusion into the pediatric group were chosen based on validation of standard BMI growth chart data for children ages 2 to 20 years old from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) [ , ]. There were 653 pediatric (age 2 to 20 years) and 514 adult (age > 20) patient records. Initial visit BMI data was used from the USIDNET database as provided from the clinician for all BMI analyses in this study. For adult patients (age > 20 years), body weight category was determined according to standard definitions as follows: underweight (BMI < 18.5), normal weight (BMI 18.5 to < 25), overweight (BMI 25 to < 30), and obese (BMI 30 or higher) [ ].
Pediatric BMI standard charts for boys and girls aged 2 to 20 were downloaded from the US CDC website [ ]. BMI percentiles were interpolated from these standard BMI tables using the gender, age, and BMI data provided to USIDNET for each patient. Data for children under the age of 2 was not analyzed in this study due to uncertainty if recumbent length had been obtained reproducibly for each patient. BMI percentile data for patients 2 to 20 years old were used to determine body weight category according to standard pediatric definitions as follows: underweight (BMI percentile < 5th), normal weight (BMI percentile 5th–85th), overweight (BMI percentile 85th–95th), and obese (BMI percentile ≥ 95th) [ , ].
Data received from USIDNET for analysis in this study included diagnosis, age of onset of symptoms, age of diagnosis and age at entry, year of birth, race, gender, details of immunoglobulin replacement therapy if used (age at initiation of therapy, route, and dose), and types of complications reported. Complications examined included infectious outcomes, autoimmune and atopic complications which were analyzed by BMI category within subsets of adult and pediatric patients with the same PID diagnosis to determine if obese or underweight status were associated with increased adverse events. Data were used as entered into USIDNET by investigators, and statistical analyses were performed in Stata (StataCorp, Collegetown, TX) and GraphPad prism (Graphpad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA).
Results
The goal of this study was to determine the prevalence of underweight and obese body weight within the population of patients in the USIDNET. After exclusion for incomplete data, our search returned 653 pediatric (age 2 to 20 years) and 514 adult (age ≥ 20 years) patient records. Our combined cohort represented 30.6% of the overall USIDNET database which had enrolled 3808 patients at the time of this study. Tables 1 and 2 compare our pediatric and adult study cohorts to the overall patient population in the USIDNET. In both pediatric and adult study cohorts, there were more male patients. This was more predominant in the pediatric cohort with 67% male patients compared to 58.7% males in the adult patient cohort. This was comparable to the overall USIDNET database, which was comprised of 63.4% male patients (Tables 1 and 2 ). Overall, our cohorts had similar age, gender, and race profiles when compared to the overall PID population captured in the USIDNET database. In adult patients (Table 2 ), common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) affected 67% of patients, representing the majority of the study cohort. An additional 9.3% of adult patients were categorized as having a miscellaneous antibody deficiency, which encompasses humoral defects not meeting criteria for CVID or agammaglobulinemia, including specific antibody deficiency, hypogammaglobulinemia, isolated immunoglobulin G subclass deficiency, and selective IgA deficiency. Notably, agammaglobulinemia, chronic granulomatous disease, and 22q11.2 were not as well represented within our adult study cohort when compared to proportions of patients in the USIDNET overall. Our pediatric cohort (Table 1 ) had a lower proportion of patients with humoral diagnoses when compared to the adult study cohort. This reflected more diversity in the cohort’s PID diagnoses with higher proportions of patients with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, agammaglobulinemia, severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), Wiscott-Aldrich syndrome, and chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) which more closely mirrored that seen in the overall USIDNET cohort.

Demographic data and primary immunodeficiency diagnoses of adult cohort patients compared to all USIDNET patients over 20 in database at the time of study
We examined the overall prevalence of obesity and underweight status in our adult and pediatric USIDNET body weight study cohorts (Fig. 1 ). In adult patients (Fig. 1 a), the overall prevalence of obesity was 25.8 (95% CI 22.2–29.8). We observed that 12% of adult patients in our cohort met criteria for class 2 obesity with BMI between 35 and 40. Of adults in the cohort, 4.4% met criteria for class III obesity with BMI over 40. There were no statistically significant differences seen between men and women (Fig. 1 a) or between adults with different types of PID diagnoses (Fig. 1 b). In comparison to national data, BMI-defined obesity for adults has exceeded 30% in the USA since 1999, and with disparities across race and gender [ ]. During this period of time, the prevalence of obesity in the US youths increased steadily from 13.9% in 1999 to 17.2% in 2013 [ ]. In our pediatric patients (Fig. 1 c), we observed a comparable prevalence of obesity to what has been observed in US population data with overall prevalence of 13.2 (95% CI 10.8–15.9). With rising rates of national obesity, the annual prevalence of underweight status in the US adults has steadily declined from 2% in 1999 to 1.4% in 2013; in children, the corresponding drop has been from 4.2 to 3.8% across the same timeframe [ , ]. We observed an adult rate of 5.6% (95% CI 4.0–8.0) underweight patients (Fig. 1 a) and pediatric prevalence of 6.6% (95% CI 4.9–8.8) underweight patients (Fig. 1 c). This seemed to represent an increase over national rates; therefore, we undertook further analysis to verify this. Fig. 1 BMI analysis by age, gender, and immunodeficiency diagnosis. a Adult patients were grouped as a whole or by gender using standard BMI category definitions as shown in the figure legend. Data are presented as overall prevalence across all data entry years (percent ± 95% CI). b BMI by PID diagnosis in adults, with median ± interquartile range displayed in red. BMI ranges are shaded on graph. Normal range (white), underweight (lower dark gray range), overweight (light gray range), obese (upper dark gray range). c Pediatric BMI percentile was calculated for each patient and used to determine underweight, overweight, or obese status per CDC definitions as shown in the figure legend. Data are presented as overall prevalence across all data entry years (percent ± 95% CI). d Breakdown of pediatric BMI in PID patients, by diagnosis. Median ± interquartile range displayed in red. Underweight (BMI percentile < 5th) (bottom dark gray shading), normal weight (white), overweight (BMI percentile 85th–95th) (light gray), obese (BMI percentile ≥ 95th) (top gray portion)
We therefore analyzed BMI data on a year-by-year basis using the USIDNET BMI entry year, permitting additional specific comparisons to national statistical weight data. USIDNET BMI data results from 2005 through 2014 were compared to National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) BMI data. NHANES is a cross-sectional, representative survey of the US non-institutionalized population which involves both survey and examination measures for data collection [ , , ]. The NHANES Survey design includes oversampling of some ethnicities. For comparison, from 2011 to 2014, 20,015 total patients were surveyed of which 33.3% were white, 25.0% were black, and 11.7% were Asian; of these, 25.8% were Hispanic [ ]. Despite these variations in demographics from our USIDNET cohort population, NHANES is a reliable source of cross-sectional BMI data in the US population as it also uses examination-based measures of BMI like the USIDNET. As patient-reported BMI has high levels of error, we felt that this would be the most accurate comparison population for our North American-based PID population. We excluded data from years 1999–2004 in this analysis because there were less than 20 enrolled USIDNET participants in our cohort per year during this time. There were no statistically significant differences in the prevalence of obesity reported in USIDNET compared to NHANES for adults or children, with the exception of adults in year 2009–2010 when there was a statistically significant decrease in obese patients in the USIDNET cohort (Fig. 2 a, c) [ ]. However, in adults, we observed statistically significant increased underweight prevalence (Fig. 2 b) in years 2005–2006, 2009–2010, and 2013–2014 [ ]. In pediatric patients, we observed a similar increase in the prevalence of underweight patients seen in USIDNET in 2011–2012 and 2013–2014 when compared to NHANES (Fig. 2 d) [ , ]. As seen in Fig. 1 d, underweight pediatric patients were present in all diagnostic categories. In contrast, 79% of underweight adult patients had CVID (Fig. 1 b) representing 6.6% of the total CVID cohort, which likely reflects that the majority of adult patients in this cohort had CVID. Fig. 2 Analysis of USIDNET data by year and comparison with National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data. USIDNET patient data was categorized by year of visit and BMI category for comparison to NHANES [ , ] data for adults for a obesity and b underweight are represented as prevalence ± 95% CI. Pediatric USIDNET body weight status by 2-year intervals compared to NHANES [ , ] data for c obesity and d underweight are also shown (* p ≤ 0.05)
Given that the majority of underweight patients in the adult cohort had CVID, we next examined complications of CVID across body weight categories (Table 3 ). We aimed to determine if there were significant associations in underweight or obese body weight with known complications of CVID including sinopulmonary infections, cytopenias, bronchiectasis, and interstitial lung disease. In the adult cohort of CVID patients, there was a significant association of underweight status with granulomatous disease (Table 3 ), with an associated odds ratio of 6.8 (95% CI 1.8–24.7) compared to patients of normal weight. We next examined the pediatric CVID cohort for similar complications of CVID across body weight, using pediatric appropriate body weight percentiles as in previous analyses. Interestingly, in the pediatric CVID population (Table 4 ), we did not see any significant association of body weight with infectious burden or with granulomatous disease. However, there was a significant association of underweight status with lymphopenia in pediatric patients with CVID with odds ratio of 8.8 (95% CI 2.0–42.6) compared to patients of normal weight. On an exploratory basis, we attempted to analyze infectious and inflammatory complications in the pediatric SCID, agammaglobulinemia, and CGD cohorts by body weight. Unlike in the pediatric CVID cohort, we did not find any significant associations. Additional adult PID subcohorts were not analyzed further due to low numbers of underweight patients in these groups. Table 3 Analysis of complications in adult CVID patients by BMI group Present?

Lastly, we analyzed the age of symptom onset and diagnosis in CVID patients to determine if abnormal body weight affected disease presentation. As shown in Fig. 3 a, in the adult CVID cohort, there was an association of obese patients developing symptoms later than underweight ( p < 0.001), normal weight ( p < 0.05), and overweight ( p < 0.05) patients with CVID. Similarly, linear regression models demonstrated that underweight BMI in adults with CVID was associated with significantly earlier age at diagnosis compared to normal weight, overweight, or obese patients (Fig. 3 b). For adult CVID patients, the mean age of diagnosis was 11.1 years (95% CI 3.0, 19.3) later in the normal group than in the underweight group, 12.6 years (95% CI 4.3, 20.8) later in the overweight group, and 16.0 years (95% CI 7.6, 24.4) later in the obese group. This trend was specific to adults with CVID and was not seen in other subgroups of pediatric or adult PID patients, including pediatric patients with CVID. Fig. 3 Underweight adults with CVID have earlier onset of symptoms and present earlier. Adults with CVID were grouped by BMI into groups by body weight category. Physician-reported age of a symptom onset ( n = 171) and b age of diagnosis ( n = 260) are graphed individually and as mean ± SEM. Between group differences were analyzed by linear regression with multiple comparisons with between group significance as noted
Discussion
To our knowledge, there have been no previous studies to examine the overall prevalence of abnormal body weight in large cohorts of PID patients. Using USIDNET data from 514 adults and 653 children with PID, we have examined the overall prevalence of underweight and obese status in PID patients. For the first time, we demonstrate a significantly higher prevalence of both adult and pediatric PID patients with underweight status when compared with a compared to nationally representative data from the NHANES database (Fig. 2 b, d). Underweight patients were distributed throughout the different types of PID diagnoses equally (Fig. 1 d), whereas in adults, the primary diagnosis category with underweight patients was CVID (Fig. 1 b). This latter finding is perhaps not surprising as CVID was the most frequent diagnosis seen in adult patients in this study, representing 66.9% of the overall cohort. One potential confounding effect within our data is that the distribution of PID diagnoses within our cohorts varies from the USIDNET population. However, as we do not have any BMI data available on the remainder of patients in the USIDNET, it is not possible to determine what effect this selection could have on our BMI analysis. Additionally, our study does not include longitudinal data and may have unintentionally excluded patients with significant weight changes over the course of disease.
Many previous case reports and case series have described the association of failure to thrive with primary immunodeficiency. Larger analyses of PID referral criteria support FTT as one of the signs with high specificity and sensitivity [ , , ], and in a population of Kuwati PID patients, FTT was one of several clinical variables found to be associated with death years after the onset of symptoms [ ]. Of importance, we found significant associations with underweight status with granulomas in adults with CVID (Table 3 ), and that underweight patients were diagnosed with CVID significantly earlier in life (Fig. 3 ). These findings suggest that in adults with CVID, underweight status may be a marker of more severe disease or a trigger for an evaluation. Alternatively, it is possible that preexisting poor nutritional status could modify disease outcome in persons predisposed to development of CVID. We observe a significant association of lymphopenia with the underweight category of children with CVID (Table 4 ). T cell lymphopenia has been described in a subset of patients with CVID and has been correlated with lower immunoglobulin G levels as well as more autoimmune complications [ , , ]. Children meeting criteria for CVID presenting with lymphopenia and weight loss or FTT warrant careful screening with lymphocyte enumeration and mitogen stimulation assay to exclude combined immunodeficiency, which may present similarly.
Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 2 b, d, with the exceptions of adults in 2009, we do not see a statistically significant decrease in the prevalence of obese pediatric or adult PID patients when compared to national data. There has been little focus on the effects of obesity on immune function in PID. However, studies in immunocompetent persons suggest that obesity modifies immune function as evidenced by reducing T cell proliferation in response to mitogens [ , ], and decreased response to hepatitis B and influenza vaccines [ , ]. Although we did not find any association between obesity and increased rate of infectious or inflammatory complications in PID patients, which may be attributable to the cross-sectional design of our study. It, it is possible that with longitudinal follow-up, it would be possible to capture differences in patient outcome attributable to obesity; however, additional studies are required to examine these outcomes in PID patients.
This study has several limitations. The PID patient data are limited to data from the USIDNET registry. Although the USIDNET registry collects data longitudinally when possible, this follow-up data is not available at this time for the majority of patients. Therefore, we employed a cross-sectional approach in this study using only the data point at the time of USIDNET entry for patients in the database without following changes in body weight or associated complications over time in this study. Additional detail regarding the timing of complications and longitudinal consequences is limited because the database is dependent on physician reporting of patient illnesses and may be subject to some error. Although this is the largest study of body weight in PID patients to date, it is possible that the smaller groups of PID patients within our study were not powered to find significant associations, and this is why we did not find any association with abnormal body weight and PID in these analyses. Further, some groups, including adults with 22q11.2 as well as both children and adults with NEMO deficiency, complement deficiency, or leukocyte adhesion disorders were not well represented for subgroup analysis by BMI in this study. Analysis of larger cohorts of PID patients could provide additional power to determine if there are interactions of body weight with disease-specific outcomes. This could also potentially permit testing of race as a covariate with body weight to determine if there is any bias of race on the impact of body weight on PID outcomes. This is significant as previous studies have demonstrated significant impact of race on obesity as well as access to medical care in the USA. However, one major strength of our approach is the ability to directly compare BMI data collected by physical examinations from PID patients in the USIDNET to the US population within NHANES. This permitted objective comparison of the BMI from patients with PID to a cross-sectional control population within the USA.
Conclusion
We identified that the prevalence of underweight patients is increased in both adult and pediatric PID populations compared to national background rates, whereas the prevalence of obesity is equivalent. In the underweight cohort of adults with CVID, we find a significant association with granulomas. Additionally, body weight had significant effects on the timing of CVID presentation and diagnosis in adults but not in children. Underweight pediatric patients with CVID were significantly more likely to have lymphopenia than normal weight counterparts. Further longitudinal studies of body weight and nutrition in PID are warranted to predict disease-modifying effects of both underweight status and obesity on PID.
