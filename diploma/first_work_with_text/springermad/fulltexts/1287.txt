Introduction
Globally, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most common malignant tumor of the esophagus. It predominantly occurs in men (two to ten times more often than in women) with a peak incidence in the seventh decade of life. The incidence of SCC widely varies by geography and ethnicity. High rates (>50 per 100,000 population) of SCC have been reported in males in Zimbabwe and in both genders in various provinces of eastern China, northern Iran, and certain areas of Kazakhstan. In central Asia, high risk populations include those of Turkish or Mongolian origin, and rates in African-Americans are two- to threefold higher than those in Caucasian Americans [ ]. Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), usually affects the middle third of the esophagus [ ]. Major risk factors for ESCC include consumption of tobacco, alcohol and hot beverages. Common presenting symptoms of ESCC include dysphagia, weight loss, retrosternal or epigastric pain, and regurgitation caused by strictures [ ]. Additionally, up to 3 % of ESCC patients have concurrent head and neck SCC [ ].
A crucial regulatory mechanism of cell death and homeostasis is programmed cell death (PCD), which involves both apoptosis and autophagy. Apoptosis, or type I PCD, is a caspase-dependent process. Autophagy, or type II PCD, leads to bulk degradation of intracellular components induced by cellular starvation and other metabolic stresses [ ].
The CASP-3 is synthesized as an inactive 32 kDa proenzyme. During apoptosis, CASP-3 is processed into its active form, which is composed of two subunits, p17–20 and p10–12. Activated CASP-3 is responsible for the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), actin and sterol regulatory element binding protein, which are associated with apoptosis [ ].
Recent studies suggest that autophagy may play an important role not only in the regulation of cancer development and progression, but also in the response of cancer cells to anticancer therapy [ , ]. Subsequent studies have also indicate that microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) [ ] and Beclin-1 [ , ] are essential markers of autophagy. Of the three LC3 isoforms (LC3A, LC3B, and LC3C), several lines of evidence show that LC3B is a good prognostic marker after chemotherapy (CT) for advanced breast cancer [ ].
Although autophagy and apoptosis are markedly different processes, several signaling mediators regulate both autophagic and apoptotic mechanisms. Therefore, this study performed immunohistochemical analyses to investigate the roles of autophagy and apoptosis in ESCC.

Immunohistochemical staining (IHC)
Blocks of tissue fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin were sectioned into thicknesses of 3 μm, deparaffinized, rehydrated, then autoclaved at 121 °C for 10 min in pH 6.0 Target Retrieval solution (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) to retrieve antigens. Endogenous peroxidase in the sections was blocked by 5 min incubation in 3 % hydrogen peroxide at room temperature. After washing with a Tris buffer solution, the sections were incubated with 1:200 dilution of rabbit polyclonal anti-human LC3B, Beclin-1, and CASP-3 antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. The sections were incubated with secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (REAL EnVision, Dako) for 30 min at room temperature. Finally, the slides were incubated in 3,3-diaminobenzidine for 5 min, counterstained with Mayer’s hematoxylin for 90 s, and mounted. The stains for Beclin-1, LC3B and CASP-3 were scored as follows: negative = 0 (≦10 % of tumor cells stained by the antibody); weak positive = 1 (11–30 % of tumor cells stained by the antibody); positive = 2 (31–70 % of tumor cells stained by the antibody); strong positive = 3 (71 %-100 % of tumor cells stained by the antibody) [ ]. For statistical analysis, scores of 0 and 1 were defined as low-level expression, and scores of 2 and 3 were defined as high-level expression [ ]. All LC3B, Beclin-1, and CASP-3 specimens showed cytoplasmic staining.
Statistical Analysis
Social Sciences for Windows, Version 19.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical analysis. For each clinicopathological parameter, Chi-square test was used to identify correlations with expressions of LC3B, Beclin-1, and CASP-3. The survival rate was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank test. Spearman rho was used to analyzed correlations between Beclin-1, LC3B, and CASP-3. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Correlations of expressions of Beclin-1, LC3B, and CASP-3 protein with clinicopathological parameters
IHC results for Beclin-1, LC3B, and CASP-3 were separately analyzed to determine how protein expressions were related to clinicopathological parameters such as age, gender, smoking, drinking, betel nut chewing, tumor size, recurrence, metastasis, tumor node metastasis stage, and adjuvant therapy (radiation therapy (RT) and/or CT). Tables 1 , 2 and 3 show that the chi-square analysis of these parameters revealed no significant correlations with expressions of Beclin-1, LC3B, and CASP-3 protein, respectively. The Spearman rho analysis showed that CASP-3 had no significant correlation with Beclin-1 ( p = 0.512) but had a significant negative correlation with LC3B ( r = −0.416, p = 0.012). Figure 1 shows that the IHC results revealed a negative association between LC3B and CASP-3.

Expressions of Beclin-1, LC3B, and CASP-3 as prognostic indicators in ESCC
The median overall survival was 12.88 months in patients with high Beclin-1 expression and 12.1 months in those with low Beclin-1 expression. Figure 2 a shows that Beclin-1 protein expression had no significant correlation with overall survival ( p = 0.824). The median overall survival time was 8.63 months in patients with high LC3B expression and 15.5 months in those with low LC3B expression. Figure 2 b shows that high LC3B expression was significantly associated with a poor prognosis ( p = 0.032). Conversely, patients with high CASP-3 expression had a median overall survival time of 16.7 months, and those with low CASP-3 expression had a median overall survival time of 7.13 months. Figure 2 c shows that low CASP-3 expression indicated by IHC staining was a significant predictor of a poor prognosis ( p < 0.01 ).

Discussion
In Taiwan, esophageal cancer is among the most aggressive malignancies of the gastrointestinal tract and was the ninth leading cause of cancer death in 2012. Its mortality rate is high (6.8 per population of 100,000) and is still increasing [ ], probably due to increasing consumption of cigarettes, alcohol, and betel nut. Additionally, ESCC is the most common histological subtype of esophageal cancer in Taiwan. Finally, the incidence of ESCC in Taiwan, especially in males, is also increasing, which contrasts with World Health Organization data for 2010 showing that the global incidence of ESCC is decreasing [ ].
This study performed IHC analyses of expressions of LC3B and Beclin-1 proteins, two important members of autophagy-related proteins involved in the autophagic pathway, in 43 ESCC patients. The results showed that high LC3B expression correlated with poor overall survival, which is consistent with previous studies [ ].
In some cases, autophagy is considered a form of PCD. In cancer patients, however, the main role of autophagy is to improve cell survival in stressful metabolic environments [ ]. Many studies show that inhibited autophagy sensitizes cancer cells to DNA-damaging anti-cancer reagents. For example, experiments performed in human colorectal cancer cells show that, when autophagy is inhibited by 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and Atg7 siRNA, cytotoxicity induced by 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is enhanced [ ]. Suppression of autophagy also enhances the therapeutic efficacy of cisplatin and 5-FU in esophageal and colon cancer cells, respectively [ , ]. Additionally, siRNA-mediated silencing of autophagy-related genes such as Beclin-1, Atg3, and Atg4b sensitizes resistant cancer cells to ionizing radiation [ ]. These studies suggest that autophagy may be a mechanism through which cancer cells acquire resistance to radiotherapy and CT.
Many studies agree that CASP-3 expression is associated with prognosis in many malignancies. CASP-3 protein expression substantially differs between primary ESCC patients with metastatic lymph nodes and those with primary tumors. In patients who undergo resection for ESCC, CASP-3 expression is an independent predictor of poor survival in those with lymph node metastasis but is associated with improved survival in those with primary tumors. Although further studies are needed, their findings suggest that CASP-3 protein expression may be a useful prognostic indicator in ESSC patients with metastatic tumors. However, further studies of CASP-3 are needed to improve understanding of the role of this familiar biomarker in ESCC [ ].
In our study, Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that low CASP-3 expression and high LC3B expression were predictors of poor prognosis. Spearman rho analysis revealed a significant negative correlation between LC3B expression and CASP-3 expression. These results suggest that autophagy and apoptosis may play opposing roles in overall survival of ESCC. Both apoptosis and autophagy are regulated by the mTOR complex, Bcl-2 family proteins, Beclin-1, DAPK, JNK, LC3, p62, and Atg5, which suggests the existence of crosstalk among these processes [ ]. Besides promoting autophagy, Atg5 enhances susceptibility to apoptotic stimuli [ ] that sensitize tumor cells to CT. Yousefi et al. [ ] reported that silencing this gene partially increases resistance to anticancer therapy. Additionally, autophagy induced by anticancer drugs such as cisplatin differs between normal and tumor cells in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner [ ]. Recent reports indicate that, upon activation by autophagosomes, caspase-8 interacts with autophagic factors such as p62 and ATG5; specifically, the caspase-8/FADD complex associates with ATG5 on ATG16- and LC3-positive structures, which suggests that the autophagosomal membrane functions as a platform for formation of a dual-armed Death-Inducing Signaling Complex that facilitates activation of caspase-8 and initiation of apoptosis [ ]. Conversely, studies show that the proteolytic Beclin-1 C-terminal fragment induces the release of apoptotic factors from mitochondria. Therefore, through cleavage and inactivation of Beclin-1, caspases inhibit autophagy and enhance apoptosis [ ]. These observations are a strong indication that autophagy is independent of apoptosis and vice versa [ ] and indicate the need for further detailed studies of these processes [ ]. When the apoptotic pathway is suppressed, autophagy is an adaptive response that switches from a protective role to a death-promoting role through crosstalk with the apoptotic pathway. [ , ]. From the above we can speculate that corsstalk among autophagy and apoptosis in tumor cells correlates with clinical outcomes in cancer patients, and LC3B and CASP-3 proteins can be used as prognostic markers. Autophagy might play a role as a self-protective mechanism in esophageal cancer cells, and its inhibition could be a novel strategy for the adjuvant therapy of esophageal cancer.
Our study has certain limitations. For example, the patient number was too small to identify clinicopathological parameters that significantly correlated with expressions of the Beclin-1, LC3B, and CASP-3 proteins. Further studies are needed in a larger population. Additionally, this study only performed IHC analyses. Further studies are needed to confirm the results using semi-quantitative methods or Western blot.
Conclusion
This study of ESCC patients showed that high LC3B expression and low CASP-3 expression were associated with poor overall survival. Additionally, expressions of LC3B and CASP-3 revealed a significant inverse correlation. Autophagy and apoptosis may have opposing roles in the development of ESCC tumors. Expressions of LC3B and CASP-3 may be useful markers for predicting outcome in patients with ESCC.
