Introduction
Breast cancer is the most common woman cancer and is a leading cause of cancer mortality in women worldwide [ , ]. Similarly, breast cancer is the most common cancer in Saudi women representing 27.4 % of all cancers [ ]. The number of diagnosed cases increased markedly in the last decade (from 602 in 2000 to 1473 in 2010) [ ]. Similarly, age-standardized incidence increased from 13.5 per 100,000 in 2000 to 24.9 per 100,000 [ ]. Breast cancer is the first cause of cancer mortality representing 18 % of all deaths from cancer among Saudi women, with age-standardized mortality of 9.1 per 100,000 [ ].
Several studies examined breast cancer awareness among women in Saudi Arabia during the last two decades [ , , , , , , , , , , , , ]. The majority of these studies showed limited awareness of its warning symptoms, risk factors, and early detection. However, lack of standardized tool to measure awareness, methodologic limitations, selection bias, and limited generalizability complicates any attempt to compare results from these studies. For example, all studies did not use internationally validated tool and several studies were completely [ , , , , ] or partially [ , ] missing a complete list of warning symptoms. Additionally, considerable number of studies examined the awareness in groups not necessarily reflecting the knowledge level of typical Saudi woman such as healthcare workers [ , ], high school or college students [ , ], and women in shopping malls [ , ].
Compared with Western countries, breast cancer in Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries is diagnosed at younger age (49–52 vs 63 years) and at advanced stage (71 vs 39 % non-local tumors and >40 vs <20 % locally advanced tumors) [ , ]. The younger age at presentation in Saudi Arabia is probably reflecting the wide-based population pyramid where females <50 years represent more than 90 % of the population compared with approximately 30 % in Western countries [ , ]. The advanced stage at diagnosis among Saudi women [ ] may reflect their very low utilization of breast cancer screening [ ]. Additionally, the delayed presentation of breast cancer (>12 weeks from initial symptom to presentation to a provider) has been linked to several sociocultural and economic factors including limited breast cancer awareness [ ]. Although few studies examined the barriers to breast examination [ , ], the perceived barriers to seeking medical care for breast cancer related complaints have been poorly examined among Saudi women. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the level of breast cancer awareness and perceived barriers to seeking medical care among Saudi women attending primary care services, using internationally validated tool.
Methods
Setting
The current study was conducted at primary health care clinics (PHCC) of King Khalid University Hospital (KKUH) located in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. KKUH is a large 1000-bed teaching tertiary care hospital of the College of Medicine of King Saud University. KKUH provides primary, secondary, and tertiary care services to a large patient’s catchment area in Riyadh. PHCC of KKUH provides governmentally funded free preventive and curative services for residents in northern part of Riyadh. Additionally, patients who need further assessment or management are referred to relevant specialties at KKUH.
Study Design
A cross-sectional design was used. The study obtained all required ethical approvals from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of King Saud University.
Population
The study was carried among adult women aged 18 years and above who were seeking or accompanying patients who were seeking primary care services in PHCC of KKUH during the month of February 2014. Those who were not Saudi nationals, had personal history of breast cancer, or had mental/cognitive problems were excluded. Illiterate women were not excluded.
Sample Size
According to previous studies done in Saudi Arabia in primary care setting [ , , ], the awareness of individual warning symptoms of breast cancer ranged between 1 and 65 %. We assumed that 288 patients will need to be recruited to detect a knowledge frequency of 25 % with confidence limits of 5 %.
Data Collection Tool
Data were collected using self-administered questionnaire based on the Breast Cancer Awareness Measure (CAM-breast) developed by the Cancer Research United Kingdom (UK) [ ]. CAM-breast has been validated and used as a tool to assess the knowledge of breast cancer symptoms, age-related risk, and frequency of breast checking among a multiethnic sample in the UK [ ]. Additionally, the tool has a domain that assesses the barriers to seeking medical help [ , ].
Tool Validation
The original measure was translated from English into Arabic and back-translated to English by two bilingual speakers and reviewed by three bilingual consultants of Family and Community Medicine to preserve the original construct. Additionally, the translated tool was piloted on 35 Saudi females attending the outpatient waiting area of PHCC of KKUH to assess the feasibility and understanding of the tool questions, with minor modifications done based on their feedback.
Recruitment
Women were approached in the outpatient waiting area to explain the study objectives and assess eligibility. Potentially eligible women who were able to give consent were given the questionnaire to fill. Illiterate women or those who had difficulty in reading or writing were interviewed by a trained data collector. Out of 483 women approached using convenience (non-randomized) sampling, 435 agreed to join the study (response rate 90 %). The reported reasons for refusal were either personal or limited time planned to spend in the clinic.
Statistical Analysis
Out of the 435 questionnaires, 145 were excluded because one or more of tool items were missing leaving 290 for the current analysis. Data were presented using frequencies and percentages for categorical data and mean and standard deviation (SD) for continuous data. As described before [ , ], a woman was considered aware of breast cancer if she identified five or more non-lump symptoms from the list of nine provided; identified that women aged 50 years and above were most likely to get breast cancer in the next year compared to a younger woman or a woman of any age; and reported checking her breasts at least once a week or once a month. A score was created, and each of three items was given an equal weight contributing one point to the total score which ranges between 0 and 3. Additionally, mean awareness percentage was calculated by giving equal weights to individual questions (rather than items) including the 13 questions of breast cancer symptoms, age-related risk, and frequency of breast checking [ ]. The associations of CAM-breast and barriers to seeking medical help with sociodemographic characteristics were examined using chi-squared test. Similarly, the associations of breast checking with other items of CAM-breast and barriers to seeking medical help were examined. All p values were two-tailed. p Value <0.05 was considered as significant. SPSS software (release 23, Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.) was used for all statistical analyses.
Results
A total 290 women were included in the current analysis. Sociodemographic characteristics of the included women are shown in Table 1 . The age ranged between 18 and 70 years with an average of 36.5 ± 11.7 years. Approximately 73 % of the women were aged less than 45 years. The majority (71 %) of the women were currently married, with 20 % singles, 5 % divorced, and 4 % widows. The majority (59 %) of the women had no education beyond the high school, including approximately 3 % illiterate women. Only a quarter (27 %) of the women were employed, with the majority were either unemployed (60 %) or students (13 %). Approximately 9 % of the women reported history of breast cancer in their first degree relatives, including mother, sister, or daughter.

Table 2 shows the responses of the included women to the breast cancer awareness measure. All women had knowledge of one or more of the warning symptoms of breast cancer. Having a lump or thickening in one of the breasts were the most frequently (83 %) identified warning symptom. This was followed by pain in one of the breasts or armpit (60 %), a lump or thickening under armpits (55 %), and discharge or bleeding from nipples (54 %) which were identified by more than half of the women. On the other hand, redness of breast skin (23 %) and nipple rash (13 %) were the least identified warning symptoms of breast cancer. Overall, only 30 % of the women were able to recognize five or more (out of nine) non-lump symptoms of breast cancer. Approximately 31 % of the women were able to correctly identify the age associated with highest risk of breast cancer (set as 50 or 70 years), with the remaining women either could not identify any age (55 %) or identified the wrong age (14 %). Approximately 28 % of the women reported frequent (at least once a month) breast checking for breast cancer, while the majority were rarely or never checking their breasts (54 %) or were doing this less than once a month (19 %). Considering the three items of the CAM-breast (recognizing five or more non-lump symptoms, recognizing the risky age, and frequent breast checking), approximately 41 % were completely unaware and approximately 5 % were completely aware. Considering all individual questions of the CAM-breast, approximately 40.5 % of all the 13 questions and 29.8 % of the 11 non-lump questions were correctly answered.

Reported barriers to seeking medical help are shown in Table 3 . The majority (94 %) reported one (55 %) or more (39 %) barriers, including approximately 13 % reported three or more barriers. The most frequently reported barrier was the difficulty of getting an appointment with the physician which was reported by 39 % of the women. This was followed by worries about the possibility of being diagnosed with breast cancer (31 %) and being too busy to seek medical help (26 %). On the other hand, only 1 % of the women expressed their fears from having breast cancer stigmata in the society.

The associations between sociodemographic characteristics and both CAM-breast and barriers to seeking medical help are shown in Table 4 . There was a trend of significance in the association between higher education and both better awareness ( p = 0.089) and reporting more barriers ( p = 0.056). However, none of the sociodemographic characteristics (including age, marital status, educational level, employment status, and having first degree relative with breast cancer) were significantly associated with awareness or perceived barriers to seeking medical help. On the other hand, frequent breast checking (practice) was significantly associated with the knowledge level of warning symptoms (Fig. 1 ). Therefore, approximately 45 % of women who were able to recognize five or more non-lump symptoms of breast cancer were checking their breast at least once a month compared to 20 % among those who could not recognize five or more non-lump symptoms of breast cancer ( p < 0.001).

Discussion
We are reporting a poor level of breast cancer awareness among adult Saudi women attending primary care services in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. For example, according to the CAM-breast tool used, only 5 % were fully aware of the three items of the tool while the majority were either partially aware (55 %) or fully unaware (41 %). Moreover, approximately 60 to 70 % of individual questions were incorrectly answered (i.e., not able to recognize symptoms or reporting wrong risky age or infrequent breast checking). The poor awareness of warning symptoms and risky age of breast cancer among women in the current study is generally confirming the results of previous local studies done in primary care setting [ , , ]. In these studies, even well-known symptoms of breast cancer such as lump or mass in the breast or axilla were recognized by only 44 to 55 % of women seeking primary care services [ , ]. Interestingly, better (college) education was more frequent in the current study than these studies (41 vs 21–33 %). However, a recent study done among women of similar educational level attending a primary care center in Medina showed a better knowledge of nipple changes but similar knowledge of breast lump compared with our results [ ]. We believe that fair comparisons of the findings from the current study and the above studies are practically difficult due to lack of standardized tool for measuring awareness. For example, in these studies rare symptoms such as breast skin changes (redness, puckering, and dimpling) were never included in the questionnaire [ , , , ]. Additionally, one of the studies was missing the words “lump” or “mass” in relation to the warning symptoms [ ]. Moreover, the method used in one of these studies did not allow for the choice of more than one warning symptom [ ].
Comparing the current finding to reports that used the same tool, the awareness among our women was slightly lower than the awareness in a multiethnic group in the UK [ ]. For example, in a validating study among 547 women who were attending the national breast screening program in the UK and completed all the three questions of CAM-breast, 13 % achieved score of 3 (fully aware), and 27 % achieved score of 0 (fully unaware) compared to 5 and 41 %, respectively, in the current study [ ]. However, in a larger more ethnically diverse population-based study by the same researchers in East London, the awareness was even lower than the current study. For example, 18 % of the 1515 women included recognized five or more non-lump symptoms, 14 % recognized the risky age, and 23 % had frequent breast checking, compared to 30, 31, and 28 % in the current study [ ]. This finding is in harmony with the global nature of poor breast cancer awareness [ ]. It is worth mentioning that in the current study, the correct risky age was modified to include age 50 in addition to age 70 in the original version [ ]. This was done to reflect the younger age of presentation and the relatively high risk among Saudi women aged between 45 and 70 years [ ].
Interestingly, in the current study and studies that used the same list of warning symptoms, lump in the breast was the most frequently recognized symptoms (51–93 %) while skin redness and nipple rash were the least frequently recognized symptoms (14–26 %) [ , , ]. This may indicate that using lump as indicator of awareness of breast cancer can overestimate the awareness level and minimize the discriminative ability of the tool used [ ]. It may also indicate the need to address more rare symptoms in woman education. As expected, having good knowledge of warning symptoms in the current study was associated with more frequent breast checking. Although some reports indicated that rates of knowledge of breast self-examination exceeded the rates of its practice [ , ], several local studies showed the positive influence of breast cancer awareness on breast self-examination [ , , ]. However, the question remains of the value of breast self-examination in breast cancer screening [ ]. Nevertheless, the goal of breast checking should be prompt reporting of any breast changes to primary care provider [ ].
Although the barriers to screen for breast cancer using clinical/self breast examination or mammography have been locally examined from the perspectives of patients [ , , ] and physicians [ ], there is limited data evaluating the woman perceived barriers to proactively seeking medical care for breast cancer-related complaints. This information is even more critical in a country known for its delayed presentation of breast cancer. Unlike previous data that overemphasized the embarrassment of both women and their treating physicians to do breast examination in a conservative society [ , ], women in the current study emphasized the importance of service-access issue (difficulty of getting an appointment) more than emotional issues such as the worry from the diagnosis or the embarrassment from breast examination. The significant barriers expressed by the women in the current study may reflect the very low breast cancer screening in Saudi Arabia [ , ] and reemphasize the critical need for national breast cancer education program [ ]. The almost indifferent level of awareness and perceived barriers across different sociodemographic groups (with some differences by education level) observed in the current study have been reported before [ ] and may indicate a problem across the board. This is another reason to call for an effective national breast cancer education program. Similar to previous studies, the examined woman in the current study did not have personal history of breast cancer which expected to overestimate the awareness. Therefore, the reported barriers represent factors that can prevent women from seeing a doctor when they have one or more symptoms of breast cancer. This should represent the belief of similar Saudi woman which is the target of our study but should not interpreted as real experience with own breast cancer.
The current study had the advantage of measuring awareness using internationally validated tool and birding local knowledge gab regarding the barriers to seeking medical care at primary care setting. In the light of relatively low incidence and consequently low cost-effectiveness of a systematic national screening program for breast cancer in Saudi Arabia, woman seeking primary care services are considered an ideal population for physician-initiated “opportunistic screening” of breast cancer [ , ]. On the other hand, inclusion of women accompanying patients who were seeking primary care services may have introduced a variable care-seeking behavior. Nevertheless, both should have similar sociodemographic, access and referral patterns as the PHCC of KKUH is providing free preventive, curative, and referral services to residents of the surrounding urban neighborhoods. Finally, being a single-center study in an urban community may limit the generalizability of the findings on Saudi women.
In conclusion, we are reporting a major gap in breast cancer awareness among adult Saudi women attending primary care services in Riyadh. The current findings highlighted several logistic and emotional barriers to seeking medical care among these women. The current findings emphasized the critical need for an effective national breast cancer education program to increase public awareness and early diagnosis.
