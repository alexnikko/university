Introduction
Carboplatin [cis-diammine(l,l,-cyclobutanedicarboxylato) platinum(II)], an analog of Cisplatin with reduced nephrotoxicity, is an alkylating agent that cross-links DNA strands and induces apoptosis in cancer cells, possibly via caspase-3 activation, and is commonly used to treat a variety of tumors [ ]. Despite the exact mechanisms of actions of this drug which is related to selective inhibition of DNA synthesis are not completely understood [ , ], currently, carboplatin is considered the standard chemotherapy for ovarian carcinoma and is suggested by some authors as a new therapeutic option for mammary tumors and lung cancers [ , ]. Inside the body, carboplatin undergoes a chemical reaction with water intracellularly resulting in the generation of a positively charged aquated species that attacks nucleophilic sites on DNA. This is the “alkylation” action of carboplatin that hinders the growth of the tumor by stopping division of cancer cells [ ]. Although carboplatin has improved treatment success rates over the past decade, but that success is fraught with a high rate of recurrences as the majority of patients experience a relapse, and in most patients, the disease persists [ , ]. The late-stage diagnosis and ineffective treatment contribute to a very poor prognosis for patient with cancer [ ]. Therefore, the development of a more effective chemotherapy treatment would be instrumental in the ability to fight cancer [ , , ]. The amount and schedule of carboplatin that patient receive depends on many factors, including height and weight, general health or other health problems, and the type of cancer or condition being treated. Nevertheless, as is usually the case, the wide variations in patient’s response to cancer therapy were attributed to the insufficient staging prior therapy that leads to inappropriate dose assessment responsible for chemo-resistance and treatment failure or disease recurrence [ , , , ]. Recently, targeting patient-personalized cancer medicine, Moawad presented in vivo and in vitro models for identifying effectiveness of cancer therapy at the cellular level. In those models, difference induced in patient-specific histologic grade ( H G ) before and after therapy expresses the antitumor activity of the cancer medicine [ , , , , , ]. Thus predicting patients’ response to therapy by identifying patient-specific H G would enable to avoid chemo-resistance to carboplatin observed in some malignancies by more accurate dose estimates for this drug whose full therapeutic potential is yet to be realized [ ]. On the other hand, combining carboplatin with paclitaxel is commonly used for the treatment of a variety of solid tumors including ovarian, lung, and breast cancer [ , , ], either as first line or salvage therapy, and such combination has proven effective with acceptable toxicity in which the interaction between paclitaxel and carboplatin is highly schedule dependent. The optimal schedule for this combination is sequential exposure of paclitaxel followed by carboplatin [ ]. Hereby, in this research, we evaluate the effectiveness of carboplatin in vivo in murine xenografts to construct dose-energy model which enables to predict the therapeutic response to carboplatin in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, we evaluate the combination of carboplatin with paclitaxel in tumorgraft of heterotransplantation of fresh human ovarian tumor that may more accurately represent the primary patient tumor.
Methods and Materials
Monitoring the Mechanical Behavior of the Tumor Response to Therapy
Comparing the mechanical behavior of tumor response of the treated groups by that of the control groups is assessed by determining the growth/or shrinkage constants of those tumors of different volumes along the corresponding periods [ ]. The tumor growth/ shrinkage constant at a certain time expresses the rate of the difference between Mitosis and Apoptosis with respect to the total number of the tumor cells (M–A) that characterize the tumor response at that time [ ]. If rate of mitosis is greater than that of apoptosis, tumor grows by growth constant of \( \frac{\ln 2}{{t_{\text{D}} }} \) , and vice versa if rate of mitosis is less than that of apoptosis, tumor shrinks by shrinkage constant of \( \frac{\ln 2}{{t_{{{1 \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {1 2}} \right. \kern-0pt} 2}}} }} \) [ , , , , , ]. $$ \begin{aligned} {\text{i}}.{\text{e}}. \, \left( {{\text{M}} - {\text{A}}} \right) &= \frac{\ln 2}{{t_{\text{D}} }}\,{\text{S}}^{ - 1} {\text{in case of tumor growth}}, \hfill \\ &\qquad\qquad {\&} \hfill \\ \, \left( {{\text{A}}{-}{\text{M}}} \right) &= \frac{\ln 2}{{t_{{{1 \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {1 2}} \right. \kern-0pt} 2}}} }} {\text{S}}^{ - 1} {\text{in case of tumor shrinkage}}, \hfill \\ \end{aligned} $$ where t D and t 1/2 in seconds.
The clinical staging model presented by Moawad showed that the tumor histologic grade ( H G ) that expresses doubling time–energy conversion in tumor cells can be identified using Emad formula [ , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ] according to the tumor response as follows:
In Case of Tumor Growth
$$ H_{\text{G}} = \ln \left( {\ln \frac{\ln 2}{{t_{\text{D}} }}} \right)^{2} \, \times \, C_{0} \, \times \, h \, \times \, 23234.59{\text{ MeV,}} $$ (1) where C 0 × h is the number of the hypoxic cells in the tumor or number of the inoculated cells in the transplanted tumor in xenografted models.
In Case of Tumor Shrinkage
The chemotherapeutic drugs affect the tumor cells such that the more the drug dose the less of mitotic cells or the more of apoptotic cells. The portion of tumor cells underwent apoptosis by therapy had been previously prevented from mitosis. Thus to apply Eq. 1 in the shrinkage case, the apoptotic tumor portion of half-life time ( t 1/2 ) would be replaced by the growth portion of doubling time ( t D ) which had been prevented first from mitosis whose rate of growth is inversely proportional to the rate of the shrinkage of the apoptotic portion as follows [ ]: $$ \left( {\frac{{V_{\text{Initial}} - V_{\text{Final}} }}{{V_{\text{Initial}} }}} \right)_{\text{Shrinkage}} = \left( {\frac{{V_{\text{Initial}} }}{{V_{\text{Final}} - V_{\text{Initial}} }}} \right)_{\text{Growth}}. $$ (2) Accordingly, from Eq. ( 1 ), the alteration in the treated tumor H G from that of the control tumor induced by the drug dose would be equivalent to the energy yield by the drug dose according to the following model: $$ E_{\text{Dose}} = \left[ {\ln \left( {\ln \left( {M - A} \right)_{\text{Treated}} } \right)^{2} - \ln \left( {\ln \left( {M - A} \right)_{\text{Control}} } \right)^{2} } \right] \times C_{0} \times h \times 23234.59\,{\text{MeV}} . $$ (3)
In Vivo Effectiveness of Carboplatin in Murine Xenografts
Treatment 1
As conducted and described by Westfall SD, Skinner MK [ ], treatments were initiated 7–10 days following an i.p. inoculation of athymic nude mice (NCR nu/nu) with 1 × 10 7 cells of the human ovarian cancer cell line OCC1-SEAP-12. Animals received i.p. injections of either vehicle control (PBS containing 25 % DMSO) or carboplatin (60 mg/kg) every other day for 6 days. Blood samples were collected into capillary tubes from saphenous vein lancings at regular intervals during and following treatments. Capillary tubes were centrifuged, and the plasma samples were frozen (−20 °C) until the time of SEAP assay. The Washington State University Animal Care and Use Committee approved all procedures.
Treatment 2
As conducted and described by Li et al. [ ], 2 × 10 7 CAOV3 ovarian cancer cells were inoculated subcutaneously in the mid-back region of athymic nude mice (25 ± 30 gm) and grown as xenografts [ , ]. After growth of tumors to 50–60 mm 3 , animals were treated by intraperitoneal injection with control solution, or 60 mg/kg carboplatin (Paraplatin; Bristol Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ, USA) in day 1. Tumor nodules were monitored by dimension measurements as before [ ], and experiments were terminated after 28 days.
Treatment 3
As conducted and described by Cassali et al. [ ], 2.5 × 10 6 4T1 mammary tumor cells were injected in the right posterior flank of fourteen female Balb/c mice (6 weeks, 20 g weight) to obtain solid tumor growth. Five days post-tumor cell inoculation, the mice were assigned to two groups of seven animals each. Animals were treated with three cycles of intraperitoneal injections every 7th day. The treated group received 100 mg/kg of carboplatin, and the control group received 100 μL of saline 0.9 %. Body weight and tumor size were determined periodically. Tumors were measured using a caliper ruler. The volume of the tumor was calculated using the equation: tumor volume (mm 3 ) = (length × width 2 )/2, with length and width given in millimeters.
Treatment 4
As conducted and described by Kumer et al. [ ], 5 × 10 6 non-small cell lung cancer (H460 NSCLC) cells were implanted subcutaneously in the hind flank of female nu/nu mice. Carboplatin of 75 mg/kg IP qw × 3 (75 % of MTD) was administered to athymic nude mice bearing subcutaneous H460 NSCLC tumors. Treatments were initiated when mean tumor volume was greater than or equal to 100 mm 3 . The animals were monitored for tumor growth and assessed for tolerability of the treatment regimen. A two-tailed student t test was used for statistical analysis of tumor growth inhibition.
In Vitro Effectiveness of Carboplatin
Treatment 5
As conducted and described by Micheal A. Nash et al. [ ], cell proliferation assay was performed on the established human ovarian cancer cell line 2774, with some modifications, using MTT uptake (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) to monitor growth as described previously [ ]. Human ovarian cancer cell line 2774 (4.4 × 10 4 /mL) cells were seeded into wells of a 96-well plate, allowed to settle overnight and treated with 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 μg/mL carboplatin. After 48 h incubation, the MTT assay was performed where four replicate wells were used to obtain all data points, and all of the reported experiments were performed at least twice.
In Vivo Effectiveness of Combining Carboplatin with Paclitaxel in Ovarian Tumorgraft
Treatment 6
As conducted and described by Weroha et al. [ ], ovarian tumorgraft model was generated by heterotransplantation of fresh human tumor in SCID mice that may more accurately represent the primary patient tumor as follows: Fresh tissues from consenting patient with ovarian cancer coded by PH015 were collected at the time of optimal debulking surgery at Mayo Clinic, Rochester. Frozen sections were first analyzed by a pathologist to make the diagnosis of cancer, and 3 cm 3 of non-necrotic adjacent malignant tissue was procured by clinical staff with specialized training in gross dissection. Tumor was minced on ice and in limiting volumes of ice-cold McCoy’s media (#10-050-CV, MediaTech). Approximately, 0.3–0.5 cc of tumor slurry was mixed with 1:1 McCoy’s media and injected intraperitoneally in at least three female SCID mice (C.B.-17/IcrHsd-Prkdcscid Lystbg; Harlan Labs), in accordance with the Mayo Clinic Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Moribund mice with tumor were sacrificed, and to maintain the tumorgraft model as low passage, tumor from the initial founder mouse/mice is expanding with a single passage into 10+ mice in order to generate sufficient tumor volume for banking and future experiments. Two groups of mice ( n = 6) with 0.5–1 cm tumors were randomized to undergo either IP saline (control group) or carboplatin (#61703-360-18)/paclitaxel (#55390-304-05) from NOVAPLUS at 50 and 15 mg/kg, respectively, on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 as described [ ]. The primary endpoint was changed in tumor size relative to day 1. Since tumor diameter accounts for only one dimension of growth, weekly cross-sectional area was measured by transabdominal ultrasonography to determine response of the two groups.
Results and Analysis
Identifying the In Vivo Effectiveness of Carboplatin in Murine Xenografts
Treatment 1 (Dose Effect of Carboplatin on the OCC1-SEAP-12 Tumor Model)
A dose of 60 mg/kg every other day for 6 days in human (70 kg, 2.5 L plasma) is equivalent to (60 × 3 × 70 mg/2.5 L) 5040 μg/mL. The SEAP levels were monitored during and following the treatment regimen. In 10 days, tumors in mice receiving the treatment of carboplatin (5040 μg/mL) had a growth curve with doubling time ( t D ) of 2.702381544 days [from 10 to 130 SEAP (ng/μL plasma)] when compared with t D of 3.010299957 days for group of tumors in mice that were treated with vehicle control [from 10 to 100 SEAP (ng/μL plasma)] [ ]. Accordingly, from Eq. 3 , the difference in tumor H G induced by 5040 μg/mL of carboplatin was as follows: $$ \left[ {\ln \left( {\ln \frac{\ln 2}{3 \times 24 \times 60 \times 60}} \right)^{2} - \ln \left( {\ln \frac{\ln 2}{2.7 \times 24 \times 60 \times 60}} \right)^{2} } \right] \times \left( {10^{7} \,{\text{cells}}} \right) \times 23234.59 = 3092317680 \times 10^{9}\,{\text{MeV}} . $$
Treatment 2 (Dose Effect of Carboplatin on the CAOV3 Ovarian Tumor Model)
A dose of 60 mg/kg in human (70 kg, 2.5 L plasma) is equivalent to (4200 mg/2.5 L) 1680 μg/mL. Results are given as mean ± s.e.m. for tumor volumes (mm 3 ) measured over a 28-day experimental period. CAOV3 tumors showed minimal response to therapy (50 mm 3 → 284 mm 3 ) with 60 mg/kg or 1680 μg/mL carboplatin compared to control group (50 mm 3 → 310 mm 3 ) [ ]. Thus, tumor t D in treated group was 11.18 days versus 10.64 days in the control one. Accordingly, from Eq. 3 , the difference in tumor H G induced by 1680 μg/mL of carboplatin was as follows: $$\left[ \ln \left( \ln \frac{\ln 2}{11.18 \times 24 \times 60 \times 60} \right)^{2} - \ln \left( \ln \frac{\ln 2}{10.64 \times 24 \times 60 \times 60} \right)^{2} \right] \times 2 \times 10^{7}\;{\rm cells}\; \times 23,234.59 = 3.24957026 \times 10^{9}\;{\rm MeV}. $$
Treatment 3 (Dose Effect of Carboplatin on the 4T1 Mice Mammary Carcinoma Tumor Model)
A dose of 100 mg/kg in human (70 kg, 2.5 L plasma) is equivalent to (7000 mg/2.5 L) 2800 μg/mL. Data represent mean ± SEM (* p < 0.05, t test) significant difference between the values of control and treated groups. The group of animals treated with carboplatin presented a 50 % reduction in tumor growth when compared to the control group ( p < 0.5) [ ]; after 21 days, tumor volume increased from 0.10 to 0.417 mm 3 and 0.9 mm 3 in treated and control groups, respectively. Thus, tumor doubling time ( t D ) in treated group was 12.62 days versus 8.2 days in the control one. Accordingly, from Eq. 3 , the difference in tumor H G induced by 2800 μg/mL of carboplatin was as follows: $$ \left[ {\ln \left( {\ln \frac{\ln 2}{12.62 \times 24 \times 60 \times 60}} \right)^{2} - \ln \left( {\ln \frac{\ln 2}{8.2 \times 24 \times 60 \times 60}} \right)^{2} } \right] \times 2.5 \times 10^{6}\,{\text{cells}} \times 23234.59 = 3.562956 \times 10^{9}\,{\text{MeV}}. $$
Dose-Energy Model of Carboplatin
The perfect correlation between the logarithms of carboplatin doses applied in those in vivo studies and their corresponding energy derived in current approach ( r = 1.0) shown in Fig. 1 boost the confidence to establish the following efficient estimation model shown in Fig. 2 and expressed in Eq. 4 with a perfect fit ( R 2 = 1) to describe the energy yield by carboplatin dose. $$ E_{\rm Carboplatin\,dose} = 6.12842672 \times 10^{8} \times \ln D - 1.30140592 \times 10^{9}\,{\text{MeV}}, $$ (4) where D is the carboplatin dose in μg/mL, while \( E_{\text{Carboplatin Dose}} \) is the corresponding energy yield of that dose in MeV.

Predicting the In Vivo Effectiveness of Carboplatin Using Dose-Energy Model
Treatment 4 (Dose Effect of Carboplatin on the Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Tumor Model)
The mean volume of NSCLC tumors of the control group grew from 125 to 1625 mm 3 ( p < 0.001) in 16.5 days [ ]. Thus, tumor doubling time ( t D ) in the control group was 4.46 days. The therapeutic response of H460 NSCLC tumor model can be predicted by knowing characteristics of the control tumor model and using dose-energy model of carboplatin as follows: Administration of carboplatin (75 mg/kg IP qw × 3) in human (70 kg, 2.5 L plasma) is equivalent to (15,750 mg/2.5 L) 6300 μg/mL.
From dose-energy model shown in Eq. 4 , the energy yield by 6300 μg/mL ( \( E_{{ 6 3 0 0\,\mu {\text{g/mL carboplatin}}}} \) ) is 4.05992864 × 10 9 MeV. Accordingly, by knowing tumor t D of the control, H460 NSCLC group was 4.46 days, and from Eq. 3 , the difference in tumor H G induced in treated H460 NSCLC group by 6300 μg/mL of carboplatin was as follows: $$ \left[ {\ln \left( {\ln \frac{\ln 2}{{t_{{{\text{D}} . {\text{Treated}}}} \times 24 \times 60 \times 60}}} \right)^{2} - \ln \left( {\ln \frac{\ln 2}{4.46 \times 24 \times 60 \times 60}} \right)^{2} } \right] \times 5 \times 10^{6}\,{\text{cells}} \times 23234.59 = 4.05992864 \times 10^{9}\,{\text{MeV}}.$$ Thus, the predicted tumor doubling time ( \( t_{{{\text{D}} . {\text{Treated}}}} \) ) would be equal to $$ t_{{{\text{D}} . {\text{Treated}}}} = \frac{{\ln 2 \times e^{{\sqrt {e^{{\frac{{4.05992864 \times 10^{9} }}{{23234.59 \times 5 \times 10^{6} }} + \ln \left( {\ln \frac{\ln 2}{4.46 \times 24 \times 60 \times 60}} \right)^{2} }} } }} }}{24 \times 60 \times 60} = 5.631233229\,{\text{days}}. $$
On the other hand, Kumer et al. have reported that significant tumor growth inhibition of 32 % was induced in treated groups compared with that in control group [ ]. The mean volume of NSCLC tumors of the treated group with 6300 μg/mL carboplatin grew from 125 to 1105 mm 3 ( p < 0.001) in 17.7 days [ ] with actual doubling time \( t_{{{\text{D}} . {\text{Treated}}}} = \frac{\ln 2 \times 17.7}{\ln 1105 - \ln 125} = 5.629687962\,{\text{days}} \) which is ~100 % identical to the predicted one in current thesis to strengthen the confidence in predicting the therapeutic in vivo response to carboplatin by identifying histologic grade of the control tumor and using dose-energy model shown in Eq. 4 .
Predicting the In Vitro Effectiveness of Carboplatin
Treatment 5 (Dose Effect of Carboplatin on Proliferation of Human Ovarian Cancer Cell Line 2774 In Vitro)
According to Moawad pathologic staging model, energy of the drug dose would be directly proportional to the induced growth inhibition and consequently to the decrease in proliferation labeled index (Li) in the treated sample compared to that of the control sample $$ {\text{I}} . {\text{E}}.\;E_{{{\text{Drug}}\,{\text{dose}}}} \propto \left( {{\text{Li}}_{\text{Control}} - {\text{Li}}} \right), $$ (5) where ( \( {\text{Li}}_{\text{Control}} - {\text{Li}} \) ) is the induced decrease in proliferation labeled index by the drug dose in the treated sample from that of the control sample [ , , , , , , , ]. The proliferation of samples of 2774 cell line was considerably inhibited by carboplatin with \( {\text{IC}}_{ 50} \) of 35.5 μg/mL (95.4 μM) [ ]. Thus, labeled index (Li) of cell proliferation induced by other carboplatin doses with respect to the control sample can be predicted using dose-energy model of carboplatin as follows: From Eq 4, the energy yield by 35.5 μg/mL of carboplatin ( \( E_{ 3 5. 5\,\upmu {\rm g}/{\rm mL\,carboplatin}} \) ) is 8.86156036 × 10 8 MeV with corresponding decrease in Li of cell proliferation of 50 % than that in the control sample. From Eq. 5 , energy yield by carboplatin doses is directly proportional to the decrease induced in Li of cell proliferation of the treated samples from that of the control sample. Thus, $$ \frac{{100\,\% - {\text{Li}}_{{{{\rm dose\,in}\,\upmu {\rm g/mL}}}} }}{{100\,\% - {\text{Li}}_{{35.5\,\upmu {\text{g/mL}}}} }} = \frac{{E_{{{{\rm dose\,in }\,\upmu {\rm g/mL\,carboplatin}}}} }}{{E_{{35.5\,\upmu {{\rm g/mL\,carboplatin}}}} }}. $$ (6)
Accordingly, from Eqs. 4 and 6 , the predicted (Li) of the treated groups of 2774 cells compared to the control group would be equal to $$ {\text{Li}}_{{20\,\upmu {\text{g/mL}}}} = 100\,\% - (100\, - 50\,\% ) \times \frac{{5.34506651 \times 10^{8} }}{{8.86156036 \times 10^{8} }} = (69.84127911\,\% )\sim 70\,\% , $$ $$ {\text{Li}}_{{40\,\upmu {\text{g/mL}}}} = 100\,\% - (100\, - 50\,\% ) \times \frac{{9.59296821 \times 10^{8} }}{{8.86156036 \times 10^{8} }} = (45.87314297\,\% )\sim 45.8\,\% , $$ $$ {\text{Li}}_{{50\,\upmu {\text{g/mL}}}} = 100\,\% - (100\, - 50\,\% ) \times \frac{{1.09604871 \times 10^{9} }}{{8.86156036 \times 10^{8} }} = (38.15712665\,\% )\sim 38.15\,\% , $$ $$ {\text{Li}}_{{60\,\upmu {\text{g/mL}}}} = 100\,\% - (100\, - 50\,\% ) \times \frac{{1.20778314 \times 10^{9} }}{{8.86156036 \times 10^{8} }} = (31.85268221\,\% )\sim 31.85\,\% , $$ $$ {\text{Li}}_{{80\,\upmu {\text{g/mL}}}} = 100\,\% - (100\, - 50\,\% ) \times \frac{{1.38408699 \times 10^{9} }}{{8.86156036 \times 10^{8} }} = (21.90500692\,\% )\sim 22\,\% , $$ $$ {\text{Li}}_{{100\, \upmu {\text{g/mL}}}} = 100\,\% - (100\, - 50\,\% ) \times \frac{{1.52083888 \times 10^{9} }}{{8.86156036 \times 10^{8} }} = (14.18899053\,\% )\sim 14.19\,\% . $$
On the other hand, Micheal A. Nash et al. have identified the actual (Li) of the treated groups of 2774 cells compared to the control group as shown in Table 1 [ ].
Those values of the actual (Li) of growth inhibition to human ovarian cancer cell line 2774 samples shown in Table 1 were ~100 % (99.47–100 %) identical to the corresponding values of the predicted (Li) in current thesis to strengthen the confidence in predicting the therapeutic response to carboplatin in vitro by identifying the histologic grade experimentally of only one treated sample and using dose-energy model shown in Eq. 4 .

Evaluating the Combination of Carboplatin with Paclitaxel
Treatment 6 (Dose Effect of Carboplatin Combined with Paclitaxel on Tumorgraft of Heterotransplantation of Fresh Human Ovarian Tumor)
PH015 ovarian tumorgraft demonstrated in vivo platinum responses reflective of the respective patient’s clinical response. After 4 weeks of carboplatin/paclitaxel as described in the Methods, PH015 ( n = 6) regressed [ ]. The initial tumor size (0.5–1 cm) at day 1 was \( \left( { \sim \frac{4}{3} \times \varPi \times \left( {\frac{0.75}{2}} \right)^{3} } \right) \) 0.22 cm 3 with initial weight of 0.22 g and 2.2 × 10 8 cells (1 cm 3 of human tissue = 1 g of 10 9 cells [ , , , , ]). The used tissue in the tumorgraft model was 3 cm 3 of non-necrotic adjacent malignant tissue; thereby, the percentage of the hypoxic cells in that tissue as normal was ~10 % [ , , , , ]. In our staging model, the initial number of the hypoxic cells (2.2 × 10 7 ) from the fresh human tumor-derived tumorgraft corresponds to the initial number of the transplanted cells from cell line-derived murine xenograft models [ , , , , ]. Representative serial ultrasound images showed that cross-sectional area of saline-treated (control) group grew without regression 2.026666667 times in 15 days (from initial cross-sectional area of \( 16\frac{2}{3} \times 6.94 \) mm to final cross-sectional area of \( 22\frac{2}{9} \times 10\frac{5}{9} \) mm [ ]). Accordingly, the volume of those saline-treated control tumors grew \( ( {( {\sqrt {2.026666667} } )^{3} } ) \) 2.885183812 times in 15 days with t D of 9.812494775 days. Representative serial ultrasound images showed that cross-sectional area of carboplatin/paclitaxel-treated group regressed by 25 % in 28 days [ ] (from initial cross-sectional area of \( 16\frac{2}{3} \times 6.94 \) mm to final cross-sectional area of 12 × 7.23 mm [ ] ). Accordingly, the final mean volume of those carboplatin/paclitaxel-treated tumors regressed \( ( {( {\sqrt {( {1 - 0.25} )} } )^{3} } ) \) \( \frac{3\sqrt 3 }{8} \) times the initial mean volume in 28 days. Thus from Eq. 2 , the volume of the equivalent virtual growing ( V VG ) image that prevented first from mitosis of this shrinking tumor would be \( \left( {\frac{{{\text{V}}_{\text{Initial}} - \frac{ 3\sqrt 3}{ 8}{\times \text{ V}}_{\text{Initial}} }}{{{\text{V}}_{\text{Initial}} }} = \frac{{{\text{V}}_{\text{Initial}} }}{{{\text{V}}_{\text{VG }} - {\text{V}}_{\text{Initial}} }}} \right) \) 3.853222145 times the initial mean volume in 28 days with t D of 14.38800594 days. Accordingly, from Eq. 3 , the difference in PH015 ovarian tumorgraft H G induced by four cycles of carboplatin/paclitaxel at 50 and 15 mg/kg, respectively, was as follows: $$ \left[ {\ln \left( {\ln \frac{\ln 2}{14.38800594 \times 24 \times 60 \times 60}} \right)^{2} - \ln \left( {\ln \frac{\ln 2}{9.812494775 \times 24 \times 60 \times 60}} \right)^{2} } \right] \times 2.2 \times 10^{7} \;{\text{cells}} \times 23234.59 = 2.754066487 \times 10^{10} \,{\text{MeV}}. $$
On the other hand, administration of carboplatin (50 mg/kg IP qw × 4)/paclitaxel (15 mg/kg IP qw × 4) in human (70 kg, 2.5 L plasma) is equivalent to 5600/1680 μg/mL. From dose-energy model of carboplatin shown in Eq. 4 , the energy yield by 5600 μg/mL carboplatin alone is 3.98774617 × 10 9 MeV which is 14.48 % only of the energy yield by the applied combination of carboplatin/paclitaxel. Thus, the amount of energy that yields by (15 mg/kg IP qw × 4)1680 μg/mL paclitaxel is (2.754066487 × 10 10 − 3.98774617 × 10 9 ) 2.35529187 × 10 10 MeV. In other words, the therapeutic response of PH015 ovarian tumorgraft to carboplatin (50 mg/kg IP qw × 4)/paclitaxel (15 mg/kg IP qw × 4) was ~7 times that to carboplatin (50 mg/kg IP qw × 4) alone.
Discussion
The purpose of this study is identifying the effectiveness of carboplatin to avoid chemo-resistance that may exhibit in some cases by predicting the therapeutic response of cancer to carboplatin prior to therapy. This study used in vivo tumor models in athymic mice which are commonly used to study tumorigenesis and assay efficacy of novel chemotherapeutics [ ]. Observations demonstrate that carboplatin can inhibit the growth of a variety of tumor types, as shown in both in vivo and in vitro experiments. The clinical and pathologic models for staging tumors and cell lines were conducted as described in earlier studies to determine the energy yield of carboplatin doses [ , , , ]. The efficient dose-energy model of carboplatin ( R 2 = 1) shown in Fig. 2 and expressed in Eq. 4 has been constructed as described in earlier studies of other chemotherapeutics [ , , , , , ]. The conformity between the predicted therapeutic response of cancer to carboplatin and the actual one in vivo and in vitro strengthens the confidence in both assays so that results of either assay can be predicted from results of the other one as shown in section of results and analysis. Thus, a possible decrease in number of sacrificed animals and in budgets of drug design would be expected to contribute in drug-cost reduction. Such matching between the results of the two assays provides also a clear-cut criterion for the accuracy of dose-energy model of carboplatin and boosts the confidence in predicting patient’s response to carboplatin therapy to avoid treatment failure and non-optimal treatments. As the use of any anticancer agent in the established cancer therapies is limited by its general toxicity, several studies recommended other anticancer agents to be used in combination with carboplatin. Such recommended combinations aim to use a much lower dose of carboplatin to decrease the drug side effects. In this respect, dose-energy model enables also to differentiate between treatments with carboplatin only or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agent. The differentiation should be assessed by identifying the effectiveness (energy yield) of the combined dose in vivo or in vitro as shown in section of results and analysis. Thereafter, the corresponding dose of carboplatin alone that yields the equivalent energy to that of the combined dose can be derived from the dose-energy model (Eq. 4 ) and compared to that in the combined dose. If there will be a significant dose reduction by the combined dose that results in a minimal toxicities accompanied by the same inhibition to tumor growth compared to that induced by carboplatin alone, then applying the combined dose becomes obligatory. This was shown in evaluating the combination between carboplatin and paclitaxel applied on PH015 ovarian tumorgraft; the response of cancer to their combination was 7 times that induced by the same dose of carboplatin in a monotherapy. Thus, such combination has proven effective with acceptable toxicity as it contributes also to decrease the required dose of carboplatin alone to induce the same effect. A further study for dose-energy model for paclitaxel is warranted to predict the response to paclitaxel either applied alone or in combination with other agent. Based on patient-specific H G , current approach provides an individual therapeutic strategy by which patient will undergo the personalized therapy for healing or at least the optimal treatment. The personalized dose leads to the death of tumor tissue that shrunken and absorbed by body till tumor vanishes. Thus, it will not be always possible to apply the personalized dose in the advanced stages that surpasses the maximum limit of drug toxicity. However, the optimal treatment should be based on the predicted responses of the treated patient to dose escalation in the tolerated range of the proposed drug (or combination of chemotherapeutic agents) compared to the control as presented in our thesis. The regimen of highest tumor regression is considered the optimal one [ ]. Hereby, patient’s response to carboplatin therapy should be predicted prior to therapy to administer the personalized dose if possible or at least to avoid the non-optimal treatments by identifying the tumor histologic grade ( \( H_{\text{G Control}} \) ) in vivo or in vitro through medical imaging [ , , , , , ] or proliferation assay [ , , ]. Thereafter, predicting the therapeutic response can be performed by knowing energy of the administered dose ( \( E_{\text{Carboplatin Dose}} \) ) from dose-energy model (Eq. 4 ) similarly as shown in predicting the therapeutic response of H460 NSCLC tumor model and human ovarian cancer cell line 2774 samples in section of results and analysis. Identifying the genetic alteration accompanying the disease is considered the step-key toward a precise staging of the cancer which enables to optimize doses and decrease side effects and risks of relapse. Thus, identification of specific markers defining cancer subtypes along with the concurrent stage of that cancer is likely to represent a priority in studies aimed at developing rational therapeutic approaches. Accordingly, identification of patient H G prior to and during treatment tantamount more precisely specific markers representation by which particular sensitivity to the used drug can be determined through alterations induced in H G by that drug [ , , , , , , , , , , , , ]. PH015 ovarian tumorgraft model was one of several tumorgraft models that have been presented by Weroha et al. [ ]. Nine of nine from these tumorgrafts (100 %) demonstrated in vivo platinum responses reflective of the respective patient’s clinical response to the same treatment. The same treatment applied to these different models was to classify the sensitivity or resistance to cisplatin. Four models exhibited tumor growth and classified as cisplatin-resistant tumor, while other five regressed and classified as cisplatin-sensitive tumor [ ]. The difference between both responses was due to the triggering of the tumor portion which had been prevented first from mitosis to undergo apoptosis in the cisplatin-sensitive tumorgraft models. A great part of apoptosis induction by the used combination is mainly caused by paclitaxel which is a cell cycle-specific drug [ ]. In an earlier study, we have presented the optimal regimen of docetaxel which is also cell cycle-specific drug to avoid such puzzling outcomes of a same dose in different models [ ]. Thus a similar investigation to the optimal cell cycle-dependent regimen is warranted for paclitaxel. On the other hand, three-quarters of the newly diagnosed women with invasive epithelial ovarian cancer are in the III/IV stage of the disease which becomes too extensive to be resected in a primary debulking surgery leaving no macroscopic residual disease by an experienced ovarian cancer surgical team [ ]. Hereby, the interval debulking is preferred in such a case to avoid the delay of the first course of chemotherapy and to resect the non-apoptotic or relapsed portion after chemotherapy instead of performing a secondary debulking in case of the cisplatin-resistant tumor. However, timing of surgical debulking or its type either before or after chemotherapy, optimal, or suboptimal should not affect the administered dose or its regimen. All of the above underscores the importance of individual patient treatment planning in which patient should be protected against treatment failure or non-optimal treatments.
Conclusion
Each of the in vitro and in vivo effectiveness of carboplatin conforms to each other so that results of either assay can be predicted from results of the other one. To avoid chemo-resistance observed in some malignancies, the therapeutic response of cancer to carboplatin should be predicted prior therapy by identifying each of patient’s histologic grade ( \( H_{\text{G Control}} \) )—in vitro or in vivo—and energy yield by the proposed dose using carboplatin dose-energy model. Paclitaxel administration would enable the use of a lower dose of carboplatin. Their combination is an effective way to control tumor growth in epithelial ovarian cancer patients with acceptable side effects.
