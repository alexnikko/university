Introduction
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a serious and ever-increasing global health problem which threatening roughly 3 % of the population worldwide [ ]. HCV is remarkably in high-efficiency at evading host immunity to establish persistent infection, which results in liver cirrhosis and even hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [ ]. By now, the standard treatment of interferon alpha (IFN-α)/ribavirin (RBV) failed in a considerable part of patients, especially those with HCV genotype 1 and 2 infection. Though the newly approved chemotherapeutic agents work better in anti-HCV infection, the costs are massive and patients suffer from kinds of possible side effects. Thus, researches in effective antiviral strategy and clinical therapy are urgently needed. Multiple mechanisms including viral immune evasion and host immune response have been identified to be crucial in improving the antiviral therapeutic efficacy. Among them, therapeutics reinvigorating the exhausted T cells is supposed to be one of the most potential approaches. And the unravelling of related molecular mechanisms has become research focus.
The activation and differentiation of T cell requires stimulation of two signal pathways, one is TCR-MHC complex and the other stems from the co-stimulatory molecules which are crucial for immunoregulation. Programmed cell death-1 (PD-1), which is expressed widely in activated T cells, natural killer cells, monocytes, and B cells, is one of the most important negative co-stimulatory molecules [ ]. It engages to its ligands programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) and PD-L2 and results in impaired T cell activities during chronic viral infection [ ]. PD-1/PD-L1 signal pathway has been implicated in several T cell-associated chronic viral infections, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HCV infections [ , ]. Recent studies have revealed that HCV core protein interacted with a complement receptor, gC1qR, which leads to the up-regulation of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitory signaling and thus inhibits T cell activity and promotes B cell activation [ , , ]. Elevated PD-1 expression is thought to contribute to the exhaustion of T cells, such as inhibited proliferation, cellular apoptosis and abnormal cytokine production. Fortunately, the impaired T cell activity could be partially restored by either anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibody [ , ].
HCV core protein, which is one of the most conserved proteins among various HCV genotypes, has been consistently shown to alter adaptive immune responses and participate in multiple functional activities, such as regulation of cell growth, cell differentiation and transcriptional activities [ , ]. In addition, F protein, an important HCV core +1 product encoded by an alternative +1 reading frame overlapping the core genomic region [ ], has always been ignored in the researches of HCV infection. It has been demonstrated that HCV F protein possesses part of immunoregulatory functions belonging to core protein and can even be down-regulated by the expression of core protein and vice versa [ , , ]. HCV F protein showed presence in 75 % of HCV-associated HCC patients and 45 % of HCV patients without HCC, and the titer of anti-F antibody was significantly higher in HCC patients [ ]. Moreover, the stimulation of F protein in PBMCs caused Th2 biased cytokine responses and weaker CTL immune response, which resulted in alleviative hepatic injury but continuous weak humoral immune response [ ]. In turn, the continuous weak immunoreaction allowed for the persistent viral antigen stimulation and then led to chronic infection. All these findings suggested the pivotal roles of F protein in humoral and cellular immune responses and HCV infection chronicity.
Since core protein affects the inhibitory signal pathway of PD-1/PD-L1, does F protein exhibit the same effect on it? Does F protein also regulate the proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis of T cells via the PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition signal pathway? And how about the secretion of immune-related cytokines? Is PD-1/PD-L1 involved in the HCV F protein-associated HCV infection chronicity? If so, can F protein-induced T cell dysfunction be restored by PD-1/PD-L1 blocking? Recent studies have covered HCV core protein-associated inhibitory immunomodulation, while limited information is available regarding the role of F protein in inhibitory immune responses.
Thus, in the present study, a dose of HCV core and F protein was introduced as HCV antigen to investigate the direct influence of PD-1/PD-L1 signal pathway on T cell immunomodulation. Namely, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from chronic HCV patients, and healthy controls were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) (as a positive control), HCV core, or F protein at the presence of anti-PD-1 antibody or its isotype antibody ex vivo to detect the variations in T cells. Altered percentages of PD-1 + /CD8 + T cells and PD-1 + /CD4 + T cells, T cell proliferation, cellular apoptosis and Th1 and Th2 cytokine expressions were detected. The results showed that PD-1/PD-L1 signal pathway played significantly important roles both in HCV core and F protein-regulated immunological reaction, revealing a worthwhile research area in chronic HCV infection.
Materials and methods
Study subjects
All the 20 HCV patients and 20 healthy controls were recruited at the Second Hospital of Nanjing and People’s Hospital of Yixing with informed consent provided by all patients. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Nanjing Medical University. All study procedures involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the Institutional Review Board of Nanjing Medical University and with the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.
HCV patients were all anti-HCV positive hemodialysis (HD) patients with chronic HCV infection for more than 10 years, and none of them has been treated with pegylated IFN and RBV. Healthy controls were all negative for HBV, HCV and HIV and without any history of hepatitis or other liver disease. HCV genotype, viral load and alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase (ALT/AST) testing were performed by clinical laboratory in hospitals. The anti-F antibody status in the sera of patients was evaluated with an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as previously described [ ]. HCV F protein (derived from HCV 1b) was produced, and the endotoxin was removed as previously reported [ ]. The stage of liver fibrosis was measured by transient elastography (FibroScan ® , Echosens, France). The clinical characteristics of the patients and healthy controls are delineated in Table 1 .

Isolation and culture of PBMCs
PBMCs were isolated from the peripheral blood of HCV patients and healthy controls within 8 h after blood drawing by Ficoll-Histopaque (TBD Biotech, Tianjin, China) density gradient centrifugation according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Cell purity was >95 %, as measured by flow cytometry. Purified PBMCs were cultured in RPMI-1640 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS, HyClone, UT, USA) and 100U/ml ampicillin–streptomycin (HyClone, UT, USA) at 37 °C in a humidified 5 % CO 2 atmosphere.
Analysis by flow cytometry
In PD-1/PD-L1 blocking assay, to determine the expression of surface markers CD8, CD4 and PD-1 on T lymphocytes, 1 × 10 6 PBMCs were co-cultured with 1 μg/ml anti-PD-1 antibody (Clone: J116; eBioscience) or its isotype-matched antibody (Mouse IgG1, kappa; eBioscience) for 4 h and followed by stimulation with 1 μg/ml PHA (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), 1 μg/ml HCV 1b core protein (ProSpec-Tany TechnoGene Ltd.) or 1 μg/ml HCV 1b F protein for 24 h before harvesting the cells for immunofluorescence staining. PBMCs without any stimulation were used as blank control. The harvested PBMCs were washed thrice in 1 ml FACS medium (BD Pharmingen) and then incubated with APC-anti-CD8 (Clone: RPA-T8; BD Pharmingen), PerCP-anti-CD4 (Clone: L200; BD Pharmingen) and PE-anti-CD279 (PD-1) (Clone: EH12.1; BD Pharmingen) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark place. The dosages of fluorescent-conjugated antibody in every sample were consulted to the operating instructions offered by the manufacturer. Subsequently, PBMCs were washed as described above and kept fixed in 4 % formalin/phosphate-buffered saline in the dark place until analyzed by FACSVerse flow cytometry (BD FACS™ Universal Loader). The data were processed by FlowJo software. The primary APC-, PerCP- and PE-isotype controls were used to determine the background staining level. For every sample, 2 × 10 4 events gated on lymphocytes were collected. The concentrations of antibodies and proteins were chosen in view of manufacturer’s instructions and some previous reports [ , ].
Measurement of IFN-γ and IL-4 by ELISA
PBMCs were co-cultured with anti-PD-1 antibody or IgG1 for 4 h followed by stimulation with PHA, HCV 1b Core or HCV 1b F as described above. PBMCs without any stimulation were used as blank control. Cells and supernatants were collected, respectively, after 72 h, and then stored at −80 °C until detection. ELISA (eBioscience. Affymetrix, CA) was used to detect the concentrations of IFN-γ and IL-4 in the supernatants of cultured PBMCs and the serum of 20 chronic HCV patients and 20 healthy controls as instructed.
Quantification of cytokines mRNA by real-time PCR
Cells collected, respectively, as described above from 20 HCV patients were merged into one group for the mRNA quantification after the co-culture according to the different stimulation and so were cells from healthy controls. Total RNA was extracted from cultured PBMCs by TRIzol kit (RNAiso Plus, TaKaRa, Japan) and reverse-transcribed by PrimeScript RT Master Mix (Perfect Real Time, TaKaRa, Japan). The transcription levels of Th1 cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-2, NF-κB, TNF-α) and Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-6, IL-10) were determined by real-time quantitative PCR with SYBR Premix Ex Taq (TaKaRa, Japan) on a LightCycler 2.0 (Roche) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. GAPDH was used as the internal control. The sequences of forward and reverse primers for these genes are listed in Table 2 . All data were normalized to internal control (GAPDH level), and in each group the PBMCs of chronic HCV patients without any stimulation were used to determine the basic transcription level. Results were presented as fold change to the blank control. The following formula was used to calculate the relative amount of the mRNA of interest: fold change due to treatment = 2 − [( C T gene of interest −C T internal control ) sample− ( C T gene of interest −C T internal control ) control ].

Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) proliferation assay
The influence of PD-1/PD-L1 blocking on HCV F-induced T cell proliferation was evaluated by a WST-8 Cell Counting Kit-8 (Beyotime C0037, China) as described previously [ ]. Briefly, 2 × 10 3 PBMCs were co-cultured with anti-PD-1 antibody or IgG1 for 4 h and followed by stimulation with PHA, HCV 1b Core or HCV 1b F for 96 h as described above in 96-well plates. PBMCs without any stimulation were used as blank control. Next, 20 μl CCK-8 solution was added to each well for another 2-h incubation at 37 °C. Then the absorbance was measured using a microplate reader (Bio-Rad, USA) at 450 nm with a reference wavelength of 650 nm. Each experiment was performed in triplicate, and the mean value was chosen to be the representative value for each sample. The healthy controls which co-cultured with IgG1 and without any antigen stimulation was used as the control group. The relative proliferative activity was calculated according to the following formula: relative proliferative activity = (absorbance of experimental group- absorbance of background staining)/(absorbance of control group- absorbance of background staining).
Cell apoptosis assay
To determine the effect of blocking PD-1/PD-L1 pathway on HCV F-mediated lymphocyte apoptosis, 1 × 10 5 PBMCs were co-cultured with anti-PD-1 antibody or IgG1 for 4 h followed by stimulation with PHA, HCV 1b Core, or HCV 1b F for 120 h as described above. PBMCs were then stained by FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD Pharmingen) according to manufacturer’s instructions. PBMCs without any stimulation were used as blank control. All data were collected in a FACSVerse flow cytometry (BD FACS™ Universal Loader) and analyzed by FlowJo software. PBMCs without staining were used to determine the background staining level, and 2 × 10 4 events gated on lymphocytes were collected. Number of apoptotic cells includes early apoptotic (Annexin V-positive, PI-negative) and late apoptotic (Annexin V-, PI-positive) cells. The apoptotic rate was calculated according to the following formula: $${\text{Apoptotic rate }}\left( \% \right) = \left[ {\left( {\text{number of apoptotic cells}} \right)/\left( {\text{number of total cells observed}} \right)} \right] \times 100\,\% .$$
Statistical analysis
The results are presented as mean ± SD. The differences between groups were examined by nonparametric tests, Chi-square test or independent samples t test. A two-tailed P value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. All the data processing was performed with SPSS 19.0 (Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
PD-1 expression on CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were elevated by HCV F protein and inversely reduced by PD-1/PD-L1 blocking
To investigate whether the PD-1/PD-L1 signal pathway was involved in HCV F-mediated immune response, the differential PD-1 expression on CD8 + and CD4 + T cells associated with antigen-specific stimulation at the presence of anti-PD-1 antibody or IgG1 were analyzed in chronic HCV patients ( n = 20) and healthy controls ( n = 20). As presented in Fig. 1 a, both the PD-1 + /CD8 + T cells and PD-1 + /CD4 + T cells were significantly higher in chronic HCV patients than those in healthy controls (15.3 ± 4.9, 13 ± 3.5 % vs. 3.7 ± 0.7, 6.7 ± 2.3 %, P < 0.01, P < 0.05) at baseline. Upon antigenic stimulation, PBMCs from chronic HCV patients achieved stronger response than healthy controls, and significant differences were found within HCV F stimulation. In chronic HCV patients, the average percentages with antigen treatment for PD-1 + /CD8 + by anti-PD-1 antibody was 21, 39 and 33 % versus IgG1 22, 43 and 38 %, P = 0.652, P = 0.321 and P < 0.05; for PD-1 + /CD4 + was 17, 30 and 22 % versus 21, 36 and 31 %, P = 0.076, P = 0.096 and P < 0.05. In healthy controls, the average percentages with antigen treatment for PD-1 + /CD8 + by anti-PD-1 antibody was 5.3, 4.9 and 4.1 % versus IgG1 6.5, 5.9 and 4.8 %, P = 0.48, P = 0.48 and P = 0.47; for PD-1 + /CD4 + was 9.3, 8.0 and 7.3 % versus 10.6, 10.2 and 8.0 %, P = 0.65, P = 0.37 and P = 0.76. In comparison, HCV F protein triggered a weaker PD-1 + /CD8 + and PD-1 + /CD4 + T cells increasing than core in chronic HCV patients. By PD-1/PD-L1 blocking, PD-1 expression percentages on CD8 + and CD4 + T cells were all declined, and statistical significances were maintained in F stimulation in CD8 + and CD4 + T cells in chronic HCV patients. These results are in line with some previous work [ , ] which suggested that blocked PD-1/PD-L1 can restore CD8 + and CD4 + T cell-specific immunoreactivity to some extent. Though in healthy controls, the statistical increasing was not significant, F stimulation did show its effect on PD-1 expression. These results suggested that as with HCV core protein, HCV F antigen-mediated stimulation of T cells also results in higher PD-1 expression, though the difference was not significant.

HCV F protein-induced cytokines IFN-γ and IL-4 were influenced by PD-1/PD-L1 blocking
The influence of PD-1/PD-L1 blocking on secreted cytokines in chronic HCV patients ( n = 20) and healthy controls ( n = 20) was determined by ELISA. Serum IFN-γ and IL-4 were significantly different in chronic HCV patients from healthy controls (0.277 ± 0.002 vs. 0.361 ± 0.005 pg/ml, P < 0.05; 0.185 ± 0.005 vs. 0.154 ± 0.001 pg/ml, P < 0.05) (data not shown in the figure). As shown in Fig. 2 , ex vivo, PHA exerted to be the strongest stimulus. Both HCV core and F stimulation resulted in the reduction of secreted IFN-γ in chronic HCV patients (3.33/3.75 vs. 5.25 pg/ml) and in healthy controls (7.3/7.5 vs. 8.4 pg/ml). For secreted IL-4, HCV F stimulation induced increased IL-4 in both chronic HCV patients and healthy controls (6.2 vs. 4.8 pg/ml; 5.9 vs. 3.7 pg/ml). In contrast, HCV core did not affect the secretion of IL-4 in chronic HCV patients significantly and performed a weaker induction than F in healthy controls (4.5 vs. 5.9 pg/ml). It was noteworthy that HCV F protein had stronger induction on the secretion of Th2 cytokine in PBMCs from both chronic HCV patients and healthy controls. Meanwhile, PD-1/PD-L1 blocking significantly promoted the secretion of both IFN-γ and IL-4 in PBMCs stimulated with PHA, HCV core and F in chronic HCV patients, which may be related to the restoration of T cell activity and immune response ability. HCV F-induced inhibition on secreted IFN-γ was weaker than core, and the restoration of cytokine secretion by PD-1/PD-L1 blocking seemed to be satisfied though it still below the control level in chronic HCV patients. In sum up, PD-1/PD-L1 blocking enhanced IFN-γ which may be inhibited by HCV F and further enhanced IL-4 in chronic HCV patients, suggesting an association of F protein with PD-1/PD-L1 signal pathway. Fig. 2 Influence of PD-1/PD-L1 blocking on HCV F protein-induced IFN-γ and IL-4 production. Data are shown as mean ± SD of independent experiments with separate donors, each measured in triplicate.

Cytokines mRNA varied with HCV F protein stimulation
To determine the peripheral mRNA level of cytokines which are reported to be involved in HCV F-mediated immune response, real-time PCR analysis was selected to detect the altered expression of these molecules in chronic HCV patients ( n = 20) and healthy controls ( n = 20). As shown in Fig. 3 , the PHA stimulation exhibited the strongest effect on all the cytokines at transcriptional level and PD-1/PD-L1 blocking further enhanced it, especially in chronic HCV patients. Both core and F stimulation inhibited transcriptional level of IFN-γ, IL-2 and NF-κB, and enhanced transcriptional level of TNF-α, IL-4, IL-6 and IL-10 in chronic HCV patients. HCV F protein exhibited weaker inhibition on Th1 cytokines, but stronger promotion on Th2 cytokines. By PD-1/PD-L1 blocking, Th1 cytokines IFN-γ, IL-2, NF-κB and TNF-α were partially or totally recovered from HCV core and F-induced Th1 inhibition in chronic HCV patients. Th2 cytokines IL-4, IL-6 and IL-10 were increased with the HCV core and F treatment and further reinforced by PD-1/PD-L1 blocking. It is noteworthy that the antigens triggered strong immune response on mRNA level of Th1 and Th2 cytokines in healthy controls, and PD-1/PD-L1 blocking worked well under the antigen stimulation. It may be attributed to the powerful and effective T cell immunoregulation in healthy controls. While in chronic HCV patients, it was speculated that PD-1/PD-L1 blocking functioned well with high PD-1 levels. Collectively, these data indicate that HCV F protein interacted with PD-1/PD-L1 signal and PD-1/PD-L1 blocking results in favorable restoration of cytokine production in chronic HCV patients. Fig. 3 Cytokines mRNA varied with PD-1/PD-L1 blocking. The results were presented as fold increase to the basic control. Data are shown as a value of 20 donors which were merged into one after cell culture and evaluated as an independent experiment. a Fold increase in mRNA levels of Th1 cytokines: IFN-γ, IL-2, NF-κB and TNF-α. b Fold increase in mRNA levels of Th2 cytokines: IL-4, IL-6 and IL-10
T cell proliferation was impaired by HCV F protein and inversely enhanced by PD-1/PD-L1 blocking
To assess the effect of PD-1/PD-L1 blocking on the proliferative ability of T cells stimulated by F protein, relative proliferative activity was conducted in chronic HCV patients ( n = 10) and healthy controls ( n = 10), and results were presented in Fig. 4 . The T cell proliferative ability in chronic HCV patients was significantly lower than that in healthy controls (0.6 vs. 1.0, P < 0.01) and was significantly inhibited by HCV core and F protein. However, the proliferative ability inhibited by HCV core and F protein both could be partially recovered by PD-1/PD-L1 blocking in chronic HCV patients. Similarly, in healthy controls, F protein-associated inhibition which was weaker than core could be fully recovered to normal level by PD-1/PD-L1 blocking. The average relative activity of T cells from chronic HCV patients by anti-PD-1 antibody was 2.13, 0.29, 0.47, 0.80 versus IgG1 1.90, −0.60, −0.12, 0.60, P = 0.12, P < 0.001, P < 0.001, P < 0.05. And for healthy controls by anti-PD-1 antibody was 4.12, 0.75, 1.03, 1.13 versus IgG1 3.84, 0.56, 0.92, 1, P = 0.054, P < 0.05, P = 0.52, P = 0.43. It was speculated that F played a weaker inhibition on T cell proliferation than core, and its inhibition could also be partly reversed by PD-1/PD-L1 blocking. In relation to this, Wei et al. [ ] found in its research that T cell is highly sensitive to PD-1-mediated inhibition especially in high PD-1 expression, and minute amounts of PD-1/PD-L1 signaling is able to perform its inhibition on T cell proliferation effectively. We speculated from this experiment that PD-1/PD-L1 blocking could enhance the proliferative ability of T cells and rescue both the HCV core and F inhibited or impaired T cell activity to some degree ex vivo. Fig. 4 HCV F protein-impaired T cell proliferation was repaired by PD-1/PD-L1 blocking. PBMCs were stimulated with PHA, HCV core or F protein in the presence of anti-PD-1 or IgG1 for 96 h, and then the T cell proliferation was analyzed by a WST-8 Cell Counting Kit-8. PBMCs without any stimulation were used as blank control. Data represent mean ± SD of independent experiments with separate donors, each measured in triplicate. P values were determined by Mann–Whitney test. Statistical significance is shown as *, * P < 0.05; *** P < 0.001
Cell apoptosis was accelerated by HCV F protein and inversely reduced by PD-1/PD-L1 blocking
Annexin V-FITC and PI double-staining assay was further employed to quantitatively determine the HCV F-mediated cellular apoptosis in chronic HCV patients ( n = 10) and healthy controls ( n = 10). As shown in Fig. 5 a, the apoptosis-promoting effect induced by both HCV core and F protein was significantly relieved by PD-1/PD-L1 blocking and even totally eliminated in chronic HCV patients. The cellular apoptosis was significantly reduced by PHA stimulation and further strengthened by PD-1/PD-L1 blocking in chronic HCV patients. The average percentages of apoptotic cell in chronic HCV patients by anti-PD-1 antibody was 54.9, 73.5, 67.6, 66.2 % versus IgG1 58.5, 94.7, 86.6, 75.4 %, P = 0.24, P < 0.01, P < 0.001, P < 0.05. And in healthy controls, by anti-PD-1 antibody was 35.7, 59.7, 55.8, 41.1 % versus IgG1 38.5, 63.4, 63, 53.4 %, P = 0.24, P = 0.43, P = 0.054, P = 0.061. Compared to HCV core protein, F exerted significantly less apoptosis-promoting effect on T cells in chronic HCV patients, and its effect on apoptosis could be relieved nearly to the healthy control level by PD-1/PD-L1 blocking. While in healthy controls, F protein induced an apoptosis effect to the same degree of core protein, and PD-1/PD-L1 blocking worked better on it though not relieved to the normal level. Critical analysis of these results revealed that PD-1/PD-L1 signal pathway participated in HCV F-induced cellular apoptosis and played important mediations in cells with elevated PD-1 expression level.

Discussion
PD-1 and its receptor PD-L1 are inducible inhibitory molecules playing important roles in immunosuppression during chronic viral infections [ , , ]. A considerable amount of researches have focused on the linkage between elevated PD-1 expression and virus-specific T cell dysfunction in LCMV, HIV, SIV, HBV and HCV infection during the last decades [ , , , , , ]. In chronic HCV-infected patients, CD8 + and CD4 + T cell responses are severely limited. The expression levels of HCV core-specific Th1 cytokines are significantly inhibited by persistent HCV antigen stimulation. Reports have considered HCV core-induced T cell exhaustion to be associated with the PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitory signal pathway [ , ].
This study further investigated the PD-1/PD-L1 signal pathway regulated immunological reaction in a HCV core +1 product, F protein, which also induced T cells dysfunction during chronic HCV infection. Reports have confirmed the double-edged functionality of HCV F in stimulation of T cells, such as affecting the activation and apoptosis of human dendritic cells, and its potential contribution of chronic inflammation to carcinogenesis [ , ]. Markedly, this was the first research which included F protein into the immunosuppression receptor-regulated immune response. The results revealed the participation of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitory pathway in HCV F-induced immune response, and revealed that HCV F-induced T cell dysfunction could be restored to a certain degree by PD-1/PD-L1 blocking.
A great number of studies focused on the effect of PD-1/PD-L1 blocking on expansion of T cells have been carried out and results in more functional T cells [ , , , , , , ]. Some of them considered that PD-1/PD-L1 blocking reinvigorated the cell viability completely, while some have negative point of view on it especially in high PD-1 expression tissues, regardless of the blocking antibody dose. However, these studies are limited to T cells from peripheral blood which encountered less active antigenic stimulation or from liver which were in differential degrees of liver disease. The sample T cells may not be in compatible status of HCV antigen stimulation. In addition, little information in the association of single HCV antigen-induced T cell dysfunction with the inhibitory signal pathway has been provided. Thus in this study, HCV core and F protein, which expresses higher in infected cells and contributes to the establishment of chronic HCV infection [ , ], were selected to stimulate PBMCs ex vivo to mimic part of the intracorporal process. Unfortunately, we failed to collect enough samples of intrahepatic T cells from chronic HCV patients, which may react more remarkably and effectively to PD-1/PD-L1 blocking. Further study on intrahepatic T cells is indispensable.
As expected, both HCV core and F protein induced significantly higher percentages of PD-1 + /CD8 + T cells and PD-1 + /CD4 + T cells in chronic HCV patients other than healthy controls, and PD-1/PD-L1 blocking worked very well in the down-regulation of F-induced PD-1 elevation. It suggested that HCV F protein could also trigger the PD-1/PD-L1 signal, though it exerted a weaker capacity in priming the inhibitory immune signal than Core. Additionally, PD-1/PD-L1 blocking functions well in elevated PD-1 expression T cells, but not obvious in healthy controls.
Cytokine production is a short-time stress response which occurs prior to cell division, expansion and apoptosis. It is also in a rapid reaction to inhibitory signaling pathway blockade. Cytokine production could be elevated immediately after PD-1/PD-L1 blocking, which suggested that PD-1/PD-L1 interactions to be the primary cause of the cytokine deficiency [ ]. It has been demonstrated that PD-1 expression was negatively correlated with reduced IFN-γ, IL-2 and TNF-α production [ ], and IFN-γ production could be blocked by low PD-1 level, while TNF-α and IL-2 production could be inhibited at even lower levels [ ].
We checked the effect of PD-1/PD-L1 blocking on variations of HCV core and F protein-induced Th1 and Th2 cytokines at transcriptional levels, which enables the reflection of real-time changes accurately. It seems that anti-PD-1 antibody up-regulated all of the tested cytokines in PBMCs from chronic HCV patients, especially with antigen stimulation. After PD-1/PD-L1 blocking, the Th2-biased cytokine responses induced by HCV F protein were partially equilibrated by the recovery of enhanced Th1 immune response. The significant fold increase in cytokines may also due to the T cells which were studied in this subject were from peripheral blood, which encountered less antigenic stimulation and be much less exhausted. Other results stated by Rosenblatt [ ] showed that PD-1 blockade in conjunction with DC/tumor fusion cell stimulation results in a skewing toward Th1 phenotype, as increased IFN-γ secretion and decreased IL-10 secretion in CD4 + T cells. It should be noted that our study has examined the cytokine production variation only at 72 h with some limitations, while different time points detection was in need for the determination of the final restoration of cytokine production in the progression of HCV infection. Notably, according to our results, PD-1/PD-L1 blocking trended to moderately improve the cytokine production, but the restoration was limited and still inferior to the normal range. It suggested that, in addition to PD-1, there were other inhibitory regulatory pathways and T cell differentiation programs involved in HCV infection and HCV core and F protein-induced disorder of cytokine expression.
Expansion of T cells is one of the most remarkable effects by PD-1/PD-L1 blocking. The presence of PD-1 on exhausted T cells plays a crucial role in the restoration efficiency of T cell activity by PD-1/PD-L1 blocking. We also demonstrated that blocking PD-1/PD-L1 signaling did improve the impaired T cell proliferation related to HCV infection and F protein stimulation, though not completely. The blocking also slowed down the cellular apoptosis, though not totally. Blackburn et al. [ ] demonstrated in LCMV that high levels of PD-1 expression were responsible for the dysfunction in some but not all exhausted T cells, and there was a significant fraction of T cells failed to respond to PD-1 blockade. That is to say, PD-1/PD-L1 blocking helps in enhancing immunomodulation therapy, but there are also other immunosuppressive signals interfering with HCV antigen stimulation and disease progression. It also reported that PD-1 expression alone is not a sufficient marker for exhausted T cells, and inhibitory receptors on virus-specific T cells are in co-expression patterns [ ]. We tentatively put forward that it may require an antibody cocktail which targets several inhibitory pathways in the complex immune regulation network.
Above all, we tentatively come up with the point that PD-1/PD-L1 blocking is markedly helpful in gaining an increase in T cell functionality in immunological therapy, and recovery of T cell activity could be achieved in certain patients. But for some others, especially patients with the terminal exhausted T cells, if the varying inhibitory receptor levels interfered with T cell dysfunction could be determined, cocktail blended with antibodies in synergistic effects in immunomodulation may be the preferential choice.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we found that PD-1/PD-L1 signal pathway also played important roles in HCV F protein-induced T cell dysfunction. PD-1/PD-L1 blocking reduced HCV F-induced PD-1 elevation on CD8 + and CD4 + T cells, and the functional restoration of T cells is related to the basic PD-1 level. By PD-1/PD-L1 blocking, T cell proliferation activity was partly restored, and the cellular apoptosis rate was reduced, and both the Th1 and Th2 immune response were strengthened with more effective cytokine secretion. However, restoration of T cell functionality by targeting PD-1/PD-L1 signal pathway only was limited, and the antibody cocktail which contained blocking antibodies in synergistic effects may be a good choice to achieve the perfect clinical therapy.
