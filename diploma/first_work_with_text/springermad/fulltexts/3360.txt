Introduction
Anthracyclines (ANT) are natural products with topoisomerase-interacting activity [ ]. These compounds are broadly utilized in the treatment of lymphoma, sarcoma, breast cancer, and pediatric leukemia [ ]. A main limitation of their utility is the dose-related cardiotoxicity. Acute toxicity is a reversible adverse effect that develops during or within days of ANT infusion, and its incidence has been significantly reduced by slowing the ANT infusion rates. Congestive heart failure due to chronic cardiotoxicity is the most common type of ANT damage, is irreversible, and peaks at 1–3 months but can occur even years after therapy. Myocardial damage occurs through several mechanisms, the most important of which are the generation of reactive oxygen species and the peroxidation of myocardial lipids, which contribute to myocardial damage [ ]. Compared with other, more common forms of cardiomyopathy, myocardial damage has been accompanied by a grave prognosis, has a 2-year mortality rate of up to 6 %, and seems to be refractory to therapy [ ]. The various approaches that can be employed in clinical practice include dosage restriction; encapsulating anthracyclines in liposomes to reduce myocardial uptake; and simultaneous administration with iron chelator dexrazoxane to reduce the free iron-catalyzed reactive oxygen formation and the alteration of ANT configuration. Nonetheless, anthracycline-induced heart failure has morbidity and mortality sequelae [ ].
Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) have been shown to postpone the progression of left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction; inhibit heart failure (HF) in asymptomatic, high-risk patients; and reduce mortality in postinfarction patients with LV systolic dysfunction and in patients with HF [ ], including patients with anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy (CMP) [ ]. Furthermore, ACEI therapy has been shown to have inhibitive effects against chemotherapy-induced CMP both in animal models [ , ] and in adult patients with early cardiotoxicity [ ]. The cardioprotective effects of ACEIs can be principally explained by the inhibition of the renin–angiotensin system, which plays a dominant role in the worsening of cardiac injury of ischemic origin. Their antihypertensive effects can also preserve cardiac performance by reducing the myocardial afterload. Furthermore, these agents play a significant role in regulating Ca 2+ hemostasis and improving myocardial inotropic response to beta adrenergic stimulation [ ]. There are few studies regarding prophylactic enalapril use in preventing ANT-induced CMP [ ]. Therefore, we designed this study to demonstrate the protective effect of enalapril.
Material and Method
This study was a randomized, single-blind, and placebo-controlled trial that enrolled patients with newly diagnosed malignancy and planned ANT therapy in the Toba Oncology Department of Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences between 2012 and 2014. The study was performed according to the guidelines of the Helsinki Declaration and was approved by the ethics committee of our institution. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. The patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 2 months of single-blind treatment with enalapril or placebo. Patients were blinded to the study aims. The physician caring for the patients in the clinics was not blinded to the study design. However, echocardiographer was blinded.
Patients
Eligible patients were aged 21–74 years and had an eastern cooperative oncology group (ECOG) performance status >2, normal sinus rhythm, and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction at baseline echocardiography. The patients had a newly diagnosed malignancy and adequate hematological, hepatic, and renal function. All patients provided written informed consent. Exclusion criteria were previous chemotherapy or radiotherapy, presence of HF symptoms or documented dilated, hypertrophic or restrictive CMP, LV ejection fraction (LVEF) < 50 %, prior myocardial infarction or documented coronary artery disease, presence of moderate or more mitral or aortic valve disease at baseline, persistent hypertension treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, history of allergy to ACEIs or ARB, systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg, pregnancy, and reluctance to participate in this study.
Study Design
Enalapril was initiated at least 24 h before the first cycle of chemotherapy. The initial dose was 5 mg twice daily. If systolic blood pressure persisted at more than 90 mmHg and the creatinine levels were less than 2.5 mg/dl, dosing was increased to 10 mg twice daily at 1 week after starting chemotherapy, and this level was maintained for 6 months during chemotherapy. If hypotension occurred, the dose was decreased or suspended, and the final dose was regained when SBP persisted at more than 90 mmHg. All patients received chemotherapy according to the protocols of our institution, and the patients were evaluated at the end of the follow-up period at 6 months after randomization.
Study End Points and Assessment
The primary end point in our study was the change from baseline in LVEF measured by echocardiography 6 months after randomization. Secondary outcome measures included troponin (Tn) I and creatinine kinase-MB (CK-MB) levels. The incidence of death, HF, significant LV systolic dysfunction, diastolic dysfunction, and severe life-threatening adverse events was recorded. If HF symptoms occurred, a thorough cardiac evaluation was performed. If significant LV systolic dysfunction (LVEF < 40 %) was documented, the patients were considered to have attained the end point of the study and were treated according to the standard HF treatment protocols. Previous studies have shown that elevated TnI at 1 month after each chemotherapy dose appears to identify at-risk patients [ ]. Therefore, troponin (Tn) I and CK-MB were measured 1 month after the initiation of chemotherapy. The plasma levels of TnI were measured using a mini-Vidas analyzer (BioMerieux, Yunycom) using the chemiluminescence immunoassay technique with a measurement range of 0.01–30 µg/L. The plasma levels of CK-MB were measured using an auto analyzer (Erba Mannheim) and were based on the direct measurement of CK-MB enzymatic activity, which was performed using a Pars Azmoon kit. Hypertension (HTN) was defined as a systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg, a diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg [ ], or the requirement of antihypertensive medication. Diabetes mellitus (DM) was defined according to the criteria of the American Diabetes Association [ ] or the requirement of insulin or oral hypoglycemic drugs. Hypercholesterolemia was defined as either a serum total cholesterol concentration ≥5.18 mmol/L or requiring cholesterol-lowering drugs [ ].
Echocardiography
Transthoracic echocardiography was performed at baseline within 24 h before the initiation of chemotherapy and was repeated 6 months later (after completion of chemotherapy and before the initiation of radiotherapy) for all patients by a Vivid S5 (GE Healthcare, Wauwatosa, WI, USA) 1–3 MHz transducer. All measurements represent the average of three consecutive beats between the normal heart rate range, with 60–100 beats per minute. The images were stored on a hard disk for better offline measurements, and the results were confirmed by an echocardiographer who was blinded to the patient’s information. The EF was defined as the LV end diastolic volume (LVEDV) minus the end systolic volume (LVESV) divided by the LVEDV from biplane apical two- and four-chamber views that were obtained using a modified Simpson’s technique. To assess the reproducibility of the determination of EF by a modified Simpson’s technique, this index was measured in 10 randomly selected patients and was repeated 24 h later to calculate the intra-observer correlation coefficients, which was found to be 0.93.
Pulse Doppler recordings of the diastolic transmitral flow velocity were obtained with the sample volume located at the tips of the mitral leaflets from the apical four-chamber view. The peak early diastolic velocity ( E wave), peak late diastolic velocity ( A wave), and E / A velocity were measured. Tissue Doppler imaging of the mitral annulus was obtained from the apical four-chamber view. A 5-mm sample volume was placed at the septal and lateral mitral annuli. The peak systolic velocity ( s ′) and early diastolic velocity ( e ′) were measured. The average of each velocity at the two annular sites was analyzed, and the E / e ′ ratio was calculated. The pulmonary venous flow velocity profile was obtained from the apical four-chamber view. The pulse Doppler sample volume was placed 1 cm into the pulmonary vein, and the peak systolic flow velocity ( S wave), peak diastolic velocity ( D wave), and peak atrial reversal flow velocity (AR) were determined. The LA diameter was measured in the parasternal long-axis view from a 2D image at the end systole.
Statistical Analysis
Continuous variables were expressed as the mean ± SD. Paired sample t-tests were used to compare the means of variables before and after chemotherapy, and an independent t -test was used to compare 2 groups. Percent changes in all of the echocardiographic variables following chemotherapy were determined. To determine normality, we evaluated each variable individually in both groups using the Shapiro–Wilk test. For variables that were non-normally distributed (TnI and CK-MB), the data were reported as medians (25th, 75th percentiles) and compared using the Mann–Whitney U -test. Categorical variables were compared with a chi-squared test and Fisher’s exact test. All statistical analyses were performed by the intention-to-treat method. A p value < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Furthermore, we used the one-way MANCOVA for determining whether there are any differences between case and control groups on echocardiographic parameters and removing the effect of covariate factors.
All statistical calculations were performed using SPSS/PASW (Predictive Analytics Software) Statistics 18 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The sample numbers were determined by previous studies [ ] using the following statistical formula: $$ \begin{aligned} & n = \frac{{\left( {z_{{1 - \frac{\alpha }{z}}} + z_{1 - \beta } } \right)^{2} \times \left( {\sigma_{1}^{2} + \sigma_{2}^{2} } \right)}}{{\left( {\mu_{1} - \mu_{2} } \right)^{2} }} = 36,\quad in\;each\;group \\ & z_{{1 - \frac{\alpha }{z}}} = 1.96,\quad z_{1 - \beta } = 0.84,\quad \alpha = 0.05,\quad \beta = 0.2 \\ & \sigma_{1}^{2} = 36,\quad + \sigma_{2}^{2} = 49 \\ & \mu_{1} = 56,\quad \mu_{2} = 60.3 \\ \end{aligned} $$
Results
Patient Population
From 2012 to 2014, 94 consecutive patients who were potentially eligible for the study were assessed, 88 of whom met inclusion criteria and 19 of whom were excluded. Thirty-four of the resulting 69 patients were randomized to the intervention group, and 35 belonged to the placebo group (Fig. 1 ). A total of 64 women and 5 men were enrolled in this study. The mean age was 47.40 ± 12.02 years. Ten patients (14.5 %) were hypertensive; 8 patients (11.6 %) were diabetic; and 7 patients (10.1 %) had hyperlipidemia. Sixty patients had breast cancer and received doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide; 6 patients had Hodgkin’s lymphoma and underwent R-CHOP chemotherapy, which included rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone; 1 patient had a Wilms tumor and received vincristine, dactinomycin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide; 1 patient had lung cancer and received vincristine, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide; and 1 patient had bone sarcoma and received cisplatin and doxorubicin. All patients received doxorubicin, and most of these patients received cyclophosphamide. None of the patients received trastuzumab or radiotherapy during the 6-month follow-up period. Eligible patients were treated with trastuzumab or radiotherapy after completion of our study. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive enalapril or placebo. In the intervention group, the mean dose per patient per day of enalapril was 17.94 ± 4.10 mg. Generally, enalapril was well tolerated; however, it was stopped in 2 patients during the first 30 days, and transient discontinuation was indicated in 1 patient during the 6-month follow-up period. Fig. 1 A total of 73 % of all eligible patients during a 2-year period were enrolled in the study and were randomized to the intervention or control group.

Patient Recruitment
At the end of the follow-up period, no patients died or were hospitalized for heart failure. The demographic characteristics and measures of common cardiovascular risk factors of the study group categorized by receiving or not receiving enalapril are presented in Table 1 . The matching between the groups was evaluated at the beginning of the study. An independent t-test did not show any significant difference for age between the groups. Further, the baseline characteristics and anthracycline dosages were balanced between the groups.

Treatment Exposure and Tolerability
Echocardiographic LVEF was similar in the intervention and control groups at baseline. No significant change in LVEF was observed in the enalapril group after chemotherapy ( p = 0.58). However, patients in the control group had significantly lower LVEF at the end of the follow-up period compared with their baseline values (LVEF: 46.31 ± 7.04 vs. 59.61 ± 5.70 %, respectively; p < 0.001) (Fig. 2 ). Furthermore, although there was no significant change in LVEDV, LVESV, LA diameter, E/A, S/D, AR, e ′ velocity, s ′ velocity, or E / e ′ ratio in the enalapril group, there was a significant increase in LVEDV (7.6 %, p = 0.022), LVESV (57 %, p < 0.001), LA diameter (4.26 %, p = 0.005), and E / e ′ (15 %, p = 0.002) and a significant decrease in E / A (9.1 %, p = 0.017), s ′ velocity (8.78 %, p = 0.020), and e ′ velocity (17 %, p = 0.001) in the control group. To determine the between-group differences in these parameters, an independent t- test was used. Upon comparing the differences between the groups after chemotherapy by using an independent sample t-test, there was a significant increase in LVESV ( p < 0.001), LA diameter ( p = 0.01), and E / e ′ ratio ( p = 0.003) and a decrease in EF (p < 0.001), s ′ velocity ( p = 0.033), and e ′ velocity ( p = 0.004) in the control group compared with the intervention group. However, there was no significant decrease in the E / A ratio ( p = 0.803) or increase in LVEDV ( p = 0.094) in the control group compared with the intervention group (Table 2 ; Figs. 3 , 4 , 5 ). Again, a one- way MANCOVA was performed with giving or not giving enalapril as the independent variable, age as covariate, and change in echo parameters before and 6 months after chemotherapy as the dependent variables. The results showed statistically significant differences between enalapril and control group in change of LVEF ( p < 0.001, power = 0.99), LVEDV ( p = 0.009, power = 0.77), LVESV ( p < 0.001, power = 0.99), and E / e ′ ratio ( p = 0.029, power = 0.59) 6 months after chemotherapy (Table 3 ).

TnI and CK-MB were measured one month after the initiation of chemotherapy. The Shapiro–Wilk test showed that these variables were not normally distributed. Therefore, the Mann–Whitney U -test was used to determine the differences between the groups. The TnI and CK-MB levels were significantly higher in the control group compared with the enalapril group (CK-MB: control group median = 20.27 ng/ml, 95 % confidence interval [18.75–21.25], enalapril group median = 16.44 ng/ml, 95 % confidence interval [15.46–18.75], p = 0.006; TnI: control group median = 0.065 ng/ml, 95 % confidence interval [0.03–0.1], enalapril group median = 0.016 ng/ml, 95 % confidence interval [0.005–0.05], p = 0.005). Furthermore, TnI elevation > 0.01 ng/ml occurred in 5 patients in the intervention group and 17 patients in the control group ( p = 0.003). TnI elevation greater than three times the upper reference limit (>0.12 ng/ml) occurred in 3 patients in the intervention group and 9 patients in the control group ( p = 0.064).
Discussion
This study’s aim was to identify whether enalapril can prevent ANT-induced CMP. Most previous studies have focused on the treatment of patients with documented LV systolic dysfunction [ ]. In those studies, the most common method was chemotherapy discontinuation and resumption after healing or avoiding the further use of anthracyclines. However, patients with ANT-induced CMP had a predisposition toward greater reductions in LV function after receiving more cycles of chemotherapy or experiencing stressful conditions [ ]. It seems that myocyte cell death can be a probable mechanism for ANT cardiac injury because of elevated serum troponin levels after anthracycline exposure. Other mechanisms include cellular sarcopenia, the suppression of several cardiac transcription factors’ expression, and the degradation of giant myofilament of titin. Cardiac injury from ANT therapy is determined by a LVEF reduction measured by echocardiography or other modalities. Cardiotoxicity is a LVEF decrease of ≥5 to <55 % with heart failure symptoms or a decrease of LVEF ≥10 to <55 % in asymptomatic patients. The concomitant use of adjuvant therapies combined with other risk factors, such as age, obesity, and physical inactivity, may increase cardiovascular vulnerability and, ultimately, the risk of premature cardiovascular-associated mortality after anthracycline therapy. The best predictor of cardiotoxicity is the total cumulative dose of anthracycline. Previous studies have shown a direct relation between the occurrence of heart failure and the cumulative anthracycline dose. The probability of developing CHF with doxorubicin increases considerably at cumulative doses of 450–550 mg/m 2 and higher. The incidence was found to be lower with a once-weekly plan compared with a 3-weekly plan of doxorubicin administration, indicating that peak concentrations may be an important factor in producing myocardial toxicity. The estimated cumulative percentage of patients with doxorubicin-related CHF was 5.0 % at a cumulative dose of 400 mg/m 2 , 26.0 % at 550 mg/m 2 , and 48.0 % at 700 mg/m 2 . Subclinical, late cardiomyopathy may happen in patients treated with doxorubicin in the absence of CHF, even in patients who received a cumulative doxorubicin dose of <550 mg/m 2 [ ]. In 2004, Perez et al. found that adjuvant doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide chemotherapy in patients receiving cumulative doxorubicin dose of 240 mg/m 2 was associated with frequent, acute decreases in LVEF when measured 3 weeks after the fourth cycle of treatment. In this study of 1572 eligible women with early-stage breast cancer who completed treatment, 1458 had pre- and postadjuvant doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide LVEF measurements. Among these women, over half (51.1 %) had at least a 15 % decrease in LVEF [ ].
Biomarkers are often utilized to recognize patients with early stages of cardiotoxicity. Although the peak values and duration of a troponin rise are exactly coordinated with the severity of LV dysfunction, the most favorable time for blood sampling is unclear [ ].
In 2010, Cardinale et al. evaluated 201 patients with a LVEF ≤ 45 % due to ANT-induced cardiomyopathy. Enalapril and, if possible, carvedilol were employed after detecting a LVEF decline. The percentage of full restoration of LVEF progressively decreased as the time from termination of chemotherapy to the beginning of HF treatment increased. They concluded that in cancer patients with ANT-induced CMP, LVEF improvement and cardiac event reduction may be achieved if cardiac dysfunction is detected early and if a modern HF treatment is promptly initiated [ ]. However, the researchers only included patients who experienced a LVEF ≤ 45 %, which represents a population with established chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity and a much greater risk of chemotherapy-induced heart failure.
In 2013, Bosch et al. (OVERCOME study) studied 90 patients with hematological malignancies and evaluated the efficacy of enalapril and carvedilol in preventing chemotherapy-induced LV systolic dysfunction. They concluded that a combined treatment with enalapril and carvedilol may prevent chemotherapy-induced LV systolic dysfunction. However, the results were limited, with a 3.1 % difference found in the mean LVEF between the case and control groups [ ]. The differences in mean EF of our study were higher than those found in the Bosch study. Additionally, Bosch et al. did not find a significant difference in the LV indices of diastolic function. We found significant deterioration in the LV indices of diastolic function, including a significant increase in LA diameter and E / e ′ ratio and a significant decrease in e ′ velocity in the control group after chemotherapy. However, these variables were similar before and after chemotherapy in the intervention group. Differences in the patient population may explain these different results. In the OVERCOME study, most patients were treated for malignant hemopathies. Conversely, our patients were predominantly breast cancer elective patients. In the OVERCOME study, 9 patients (20 %) in the intervention group and 15 patients (33 %) in the control group experienced life-threatening adverse events due to sepsis. None of our patients died or were hospitalized during the follow-up period. It seems that our patients had a more favorable risk profile. Furthermore, the intensity and type of chemotherapy may affect the long-term results. There is a significant relation between LA remodeling and the echocardiographic indices of diastolic function. Tissue Doppler e ′ is a more sensitive parameter of abnormal myocardial relaxation. Most patients with e ′ (lateral) <8.5 cm/s or e ′ (septal) < 8 cm/s have impaired myocardial relaxation. The E / e ′ ratio plays an important role in the estimation of LV filling pressures. Based on the septal E / e ′ ratio, a ratio <8 is usually associated with normal LV filling pressures, whereas a ratio 5 is associated with increased filling pressures [ ]. An early reduction in e ′ velocity of the mitral annulus has been reported in patients receiving anthracyclines and remained reduced during treatment and several years thereafter. The reductions in e ′ velocity appear to be heterogeneous, which suggests differences in regional wall stress, apoptosis, or fibrosis [ ]. In our study, the mean EF after chemotherapy in the intervention group was similar to the baseline EF but significantly decreased in the control group. Unfortunately, detecting a decreased LVEF after anthracyclines may be too late for treatment, which suggests the need for more sensitive parameters. The peak systolic velocity ( s ′) of the mitral annulus by pulsed-wave DTI could be useful adjunct information to LVEF when evaluating LV systolic function. A reduction in s ′ velocity was reported in animal models of doxorubicin-induced cardiac injury and in the chronic follow-up of patients treated with anthracyclines. A marked early decrease in s ′ velocity and its value as a potential predictor of changes of LV systolic function after chemotherapy have been reported in previous studies [ ]. We found a significant decrease in s ′ velocity after chemotherapy in the control group.
In our study, TnI and CK-MB were measured 1 month after the initiation of chemotherapy. Previous studies have shown that elevated TnI at 1 month after each chemotherapy dose appears to identify at-risk patients. We found significant differences in TnI and CK-MB levels in the enalapril group compared with the control group. The absence of these results in the Bosch study may be due to the unfavorable risk profile and systemic involvement of hematological malignancies.
Study Limitation
The main limitations of our study are its small sample size and short follow-up period. At the end of the follow-up period, none of our patients died or were hospitalized for heart failure. The limited number of patients may be the reason for this result. We evaluated the protective effect of enalapril only on early cardiotoxic effects and did not evaluate the late-term effects of chemotherapy.
Conclusion
Our study showed that prophylactic use of enalapril can be beneficial in preserving both systolic and diastolic function in cancer patients treated with ANTs.
