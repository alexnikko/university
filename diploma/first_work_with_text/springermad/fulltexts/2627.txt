Introduction
Orf disease or contagious ecthyma is caused by orf virus, a linear double-stranded DNA virus which belongs to the family Poxviridae , under the genus Parapoxvirus (Spyrou and Valiakos ). Other names for this disease include scabby mouth, contagious pustular dermatitis, sore mouth, and “puru” (Abdullah et al. ). This disease can affect any ruminant species; however, it mainly affects the sheep and goat species compared to other ruminants. The orf virus is also known to be zoonotic to humans through direct contact with lesions on affected animals; however, infection is often locally invasive and non-life threatening (Nandi et al. ).
Orf virus infection usually starts with the formation of erythematous spots, followed by formation of papules, vesicles, pustules, and later on scabs once the vesicles or pustules rupture. The lesions are mainly observed around the mouth, nose, feet of animals, and teats of lactating does or ewes (Spyrou and Valiakos ). This disease can affect all ages of production; however, young animals are more severely affected that may lead to death (Abdullah et al. ). Transmission is through direct contact with infected animal, or contact with environment or material which harbors the virus, for example during grazing. The virus enters the host through breaks on the skin and replicates in the epidermal cells, leading to formation of lesions (Kumar et al. ).
Infection with orf virus is usually benign and animals will recover spontaneously within 3 to 5 weeks (Kumar et al. ). Nonetheless, it will greatly affect the production status when affected animals refuse to eat due to pain from the lesions around or inside the mouth. Besides that, infection with orf virus can be aggravated by secondary bacterial infections (Nandi et al. ). Ruptured lesions might also attract flies, which could lead to cutaneous myiasis. Diagnosis of orf infection can be made through observation of scabby skin lesions around the mouth, legs or teats, histopathology of skin lesions, and serological testing for presence of antigen or antibody (Kumar et al. ; Sadiq et al. ).
Orf virus has been a recurring problem among the farms in Malaysia, affecting animal productivity and economic gains. Following the isolation and molecular identification of Malaysian orf virus by Abdullah et al. ( ), there is a further need to investigate the status of orf virus in small ruminant populations. Determination of IgM antibodies will provide valuable information on the status of recent or new infections in a flock. Thus, this study was designed to determine the rate of recent orf virus infection among small ruminants (goats and sheep) in selected farms from Selangor, Malaysia, based on IgM antibodies detection. The study also aimed to identify the risk factors associated with orf infection among the sheep and goat populations.
Materials and method
Sample location
The study was conducted in five small ruminant farms that were randomly selected from the state of Selangor, Malaysia. Total of 90 sheep and 90 goats were enrolled in this study. Questionnaire form was given to the farm owners at the time of sampling to ascertain the farm management system and water source. The farms were commercial farms maintained under both semi-intensive and intensive management systems.
Blood collection
A total of 180 animals (sheep; n = 90; goat; n = 90) were selected randomly by convenience from these farms. Each goat and sheep was physically restrained, and the site of jugular venipuncture was disinfected using 70% alcohol swab. Three milliliter of blood was collected in plain blood collection tubes from each animal. All the samples were labeled accordingly and transported in an ice box to the laboratory. The blood samples were allowed to clot and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min to separate the serum. The serum was collected in 1.5-mL tubes and kept at − 20 °C until subjected to indirect Sandwich-ELISA test.
Procedure of ELISA test kit
All serum samples from both goat and sheep were analyzed individually. The orf IgM ELISA was performed using sheep and goat Microelisa strip plate (SunLong Biotech Co., LTD) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Absorbance was read at 450 nm using a Microtiter Plate Reader.
Data analysis
All data collected from this study were analyzed using chi-square test (IBM SPSS Statistical software Version 22) with statistical significance set at p < 0.05.
Results
Result from this study revealed that 33 out of 90 goats (36.7%) and 7 out of 90 sheep (7.8%) (Table 1 ) were seropositive for orf IgM antibodies.

In goats, the seroprevalence of orf IgM antibodies in the young was 2.2%, while in adults it was 34.4%. However, there was no significant difference ( p > 0.05). In sheep, the young had a higher ( p < 0.05) seroprevalence of 7.8% compared to the adults (0%) (Table 2 ).

Male goats had a seroprevalence of 1.1% as compared to 35.6% in female goats. In sheep, a seroprevalence of orf IgM antibody was higher ( p < 0.05) in male (4.4%) than in female (3.3%).
There were significant differences in the seroprevalence of orf IgM antibodies between sheep and goats. Saanen and cross-bred goats had a higher seroprevalence compared to other breeds.
On the basis of lesion presence/absence, the seroprevalence of orf IgM antibody was higher ( p < 0.05) in goats without lesion than in sheep under the same category (Table 3 ; Fig. 1 ).

Based on the number of farms sampled, goats have a higher seroprevalence of orf IgM antibody ( p < 0.05) than sheep. Besides, a higher seroprevalence in goats was also observed in Farm 3 (17.8%) in comparison to other farms (Table 4 ).

Discussions
The results revealed that goats had a higher seroprevalence of orf IgM antibody compared to sheep. This might be associated with the higher number of farms from which sera samples were obtained for goats. This finding agrees with previous studies, where the prevalence of orf in sheep was 1.9% in England (Onyango et al. ), 34.9% in goats in China (Gao et al. ), and 76.6% in Indian goats (Bora et al. ). However, more obvious clinical signs of orf infection were seen in sheep than goats in this study. This is contrary to the findings of Zamri-Saad et al. ( ), which reported that goats are more likely to show severe orf lesions compared to sheep. This suggests that the goats were infected with the orf virus but showed no clinical signs of disease probably due to the ability of the immune system to control the infection, or the infection was very recent and clinical signs are yet to appear (Kumar et al. ; Mayr and Bϋttner ). Furthermore, the strain of the virus and the quantity of virus inoculated might also have contributed to the difference in seroprevalence between these two species (Bande et al. ; Abdullah et al. ).
Age was observed to be a significant determinant of infection in sheep but not in goats; this may indicate that goats are susceptible to orf infection regardless of age while young sheep are more susceptible than their adult counterparts. This result is in agreement with the findings of Onyango et al. ( ), who found that orf is more prevalent in lambs. On the other hand, the finding of this study also agrees with the study by Bora et al. ( ), where orf was more prevalent in goats more than 8 months old. In this study, even though the seroprevalence in adult goats was higher than in the young goats, there was no significant difference between the two factors. In general, young animals were more prone to infection and developed more severe lesions, often leading to death, mainly because of their naïve immune system (Spyrou and Valiakos ).
Gender was not a significant determinant of infection in goats despite having higher seroprevalence in females than males. In sheep, however, males were more predisposed to infection than females. This could be due to the imbalance of sample sizes between the two genders. There is paucity of information about the relevance of gender in orf seroprevalence (Nandi et al. ; Kumar et al. ; Spyrou and Valiakos ).
Breeds of animal could be potential risk factors for orf infection. In this study, cross-bred goats had a higher seroprevalence of orf than sheep, while Damara sheep breed had higher seroprevalence than other sheep breeds sampled. In a study by Gao et al. ( ) and Bora et al. ( ), it was reported that Chinese and Indian goat breeds were shown to have higher incidence of orf infection. Similarly, Kumar et al. ( ), stated that Boer goat breed were more predisposed to orf infection. In order to get a clearer picture, sampling from a larger population of different breeds will provide more information on the breed predisposition to infection in Malaysia.
The farm location also had a significant relation with the seroprevalence of orf in both sheep and goats, where the highest numbers of seropositive animals were from Farm 3. This may indicate that the disease might be endemic in certain farms sampled. All the farms enrolled in this study did not practice adequate biosecurity measures such as foot or vehicle dips and this can be the reason why certain farms have a higher seroprevalence of orf infection. Farms practicing intensive system are more prone to infection due to increased contact between the animals resulting in rapid spread of the virus (Gao et al. ), and this is in agreement with our study since Farm 3 practiced intensive management system. Regardless, other factors might also play a role in the seroprevalence of orf in the farms, and these include the following: the level of nutrition provided, source of animals, and frequency of visitors to the farm (Onyango et al. ; Kumar et al. ; Mayr and Bϋttner ).
The orf virus can remain dormant in the environment or in fallen scabs for a very long time, especially in tropical climates such as in Malaysia (Nandi et al. ; Spyrou and Valiakos ). Furthermore, immunity against the virus is short-lived, and animals previously infected with the disease can get re-infected again in future whenever they are under stress (Mayr and Bϋttner ; Nandi et al. ; Kumar et al. ).
The relation between vaccination against orf and the prevalence of the disease was not determined for both sheep and goats in this study because all the animals sampled were not vaccinated against orf. This certainly contributed to the higher seroprevalence in this species in comparison to sheep. There was no record of vaccination in both goat and sheep farms as vaccination is not practiced in the region. Nonetheless, this can be studied when orf vaccination is available and practiced in Malaysia, as vaccination against orf is proven to be helpful in countries that practice it, especially in young animals (Onyango et al. ; Kumar et al. ).
Conclusion
This study concludes that a significant number of goat population are already harboring active or recent orf infection, despite not showing any clinical signs as compared to sheep that had lower seroprevalence. Contributing factors such as age, gender, breed, and farm were also shown to play vital roles in predisposing animals to orf infection.
