Introduction
The lipid-based drug delivery systems have the capability to improve the solubility and bioavailability of oral administered poorly water-soluble and/or lipophilic drugs [ , ]. Nowadays, one of the most promising areas of research in drug delivery system is the design of lipid-based nanodelivery systems that are able to deliver active in the right dose at the appropriate time. Nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) are a second generation of solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and have shown better encapsulation efficiency in comparison to SLN [ ]. The better drug encapsulation is attributed to the differences in the structures of the solid and liquid lipids, and then formation of a perfect crystal is distorted. The inclusion of oil with solid lipid can produce more room in their structure for the encapsulation of drug and the drug molecules can be accommodated in between lipid layers and/or fatty acid chains [ , ]. Thus, the mixture accommodates the active in molecular form or in amorphous clusters [ , ]. Additionally, NLCs promote oral absorption of encapsulated drug via selective uptake through lymphatic route or Peyer’s patches [ ]. Due to the use of biocompatible and biodegradable lipids, it has been used as a potential drug delivery system with the lesser incidence of tissue toxicity [ , ]. Due to these characteristics, NLCs protect the drug from hepatic metabolism and overcome the disadvantages related with SLNs. The NLC system has reported higher drug loading which leads to enhancing drug availability to the systemic circulation [ , , , ]. In addition, it has shown sustained drug release pattern from the lipid matrix which results from prolonged drug concentration within therapeutic window [ ]. Due to above advantages, it has been reported that NLCs is one of the most applicable drug delivery systems among the other lipid delivery systems.
Olmesartan is a second most potent antihypertensive drug used as selective AT1 subtype angiotensin II receptor antagonist. It has shown more than 12,500-fold higher affinity for the angiotensin II receptor type 1 than for the angiotensin II receptor type 2 [ ]. It comes under class II drug in biopharmaceutics classification system with a log partition coefficient of 4.7, half-life of 10–15 h, and low absolute bioavailability (28.6%) [ , ]. The recommended daily oral dose of olmesartan is 10–40 mg for the treatment of hypertension in adult patients [ ]. Olmesartan medoxomil is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and converted to OLM during absorption and the formed active metabolite was subsequently excreted without further metabolism. Across the world, the use of systematic optimization of isotropic systems using the design of experiments (DoE) has become a routine practice [ ]. Among many statistically design approaches, Box–Behnken design was specifically selected for optimization because it requires lesser runs than a central composite design [ , , ]. There are a number of experimental studies reported on diverse nanosized formulations that showed the utility of this approach in developing the optimized formulations [ , , ].
The aim of the present study was to optimize the nanolipid carrier of OLM, a lipophilic antihypertensive drug. The independent variables were chosen as lipid concentration, surfactant concentration, and sonication time, while particle size, polydispersity index, and entrapment efficiency were selected as dependent responses. Based on the outcomes, the OLM-NLCopt was subjected to in vivo absorption assessment to elucidate their feasibility in enhancing the bioavailability efficacy.
Materials and Methods
Materials
Olmesartan medoxomil was received as a gift sample from Ranbaxy Research Laboratory (Haryana, India). Precirol ATO5, Compritol 888 ATO, and Transcutol HP were received from Gatteffose. Tween 80 and water were taken from S.D. Fine Chemicals (New Delhi, India). HPLC-grade methanol was supplied from Spectrochem Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai, India. Water for HPLC was purchased from Thomas Baker Chemicals Ltd., Mumbai. Double-distilled water was used for all experiments. All the materials used in the study were of analytical grade.
Methods
UPLC Method
The samples were assayed by UPLC method using water/ACN (95:5) and formic acid (0.5 mL) as mobile phase at 254 nm. UPLC system (Acquity UPLCTM system; Waters, Milford, USA) was equipped with a PDA detector and column (Sunniest C-18-HT, 2 μm, 50 × 2.1 mm). Rheodyne injector fitted with 5 μL capacity was taken to inject the sample and elution was carried out at a flow rate 0.7 mL/min. Data processing and collection were accomplished using Waters Empower™ chromatography data software.
Equilibrium Solubility Studies
Equilibrium solubility studies on OLM were carried out in various excipients (solid lipids, liquid lipids, surfactants) to be used in the formulation. The solubility of OLM in solid lipids was determined by adding an excess amount of OLM to a measured quantity of lipid. The minimum amount of molten lipid required to solubilize OLM was noted and end point of the solubility study was the formation of a clear solution. The solubility of OLM in different liquid lipids was determined by adding an excess amount of drug in 2 mL of oil in a glass vial. The vials were tightly closed and continuously shaken on a mechanical shaker for 48 h at 25 ± 2 °C to reach equilibrium. The mixture was centrifuged (5430R; Eppendorf) at 17,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was collected, diluted with methanol, and analyzed at 254 nm in triplicate by a UV spectrophotometer (Shimadzu-1800, Japan). The miscibility of both solid and liquid lipids is required to get the best imperfections in the internal structure of NLC. The solid and liquid lipids in different ratios (9:1, 8:2, 7:3, 6:4, 4:1, 3:2) with highest solubilizing potential for OLM were selected for miscibility studies. The mixtures were heated up to 5 °C more than the melting point of solid lipid. The samples were visualized immediately after solidification and then at 24 h for uniformity in phase. The samples which did not show phase separation were selected for further studies.
Preparation of OLM-NLCs
The formulations of OLM-NLCs were prepared by the combination method of melt emulsification with ultrasonication technique. Briefly, the calculated amount of OLM, Precirol ATO5, and Transcutol HP were blended and melted at 75 °C to form a uniform and clear oil phase. The aqueous phase consists of Tween 80 as surfactant was dissolved in 5 mL of milli-Q water. This aqueous phase was heated to the same temperature and was added dropwise to the oil phase by the aid of agitation at 600 rpm for 10 min. The prepared coarse dispersion was then treated by probe sonicator (UP100H; Hielscher Ultrasonics GmbH, Berlin) at 50 W to obtain small size [ ]. The container having samples were kept in a beaker with ice which helps to maintain the temperature of formulation at 4 °C, and a pause or a gap of 5 min were taken in each cycle. Subsequently, the prepared particles were kept at room temperature to form LNPs and then were finally stored for further study. The developed OLM-NLCs were lyophilized using a freeze dryer (Freezone 6 plus; Labconco) at a chamber pressure of 20 Pa and cold trap temperature of − 20 °C in the entire process. The study was performed for 24 h for freezing, 4 h for primary drying at 0 °C followed by 10 °C for 2 h and 15 °C for 1.5 h and secondary drying at 25 °C for 3 h. Mannitol (3%) was added as a cryoprotectant to avoid lysis of NLCs.
Experimental Design
The three-factor, three-level Box–Behnken design (Design-Expert 8.0.5 software; Stat-Ease Inc., Minneapolis, USA) was employed to study the optimization of OLM-NLCs. The effect of independent variables [lipid mix (2–5% w / v ), surfactant concentration (3–5% w / v ), and sonication time (5–9 min)] were assessed on dependent variables [size ( Y 1 ), PDI ( Y 2 ), and entrapment efficiency ( Y 3 )] as depicted in Table 1 . The collected data for each response in each run was statistically analyzed and fitted into the different regression model. The numerical point prediction procedure was applied to optimize the formulation using the desirability function. 3D response surface plots were generated by statistical design software using all independent factors with their effects shown on dependent variables. The experimental design showed five midpoints to check the optimum formulation and to validate the chosen experimental domain. The obtained resultant experimental values of the responses were quantitatively compared to that of the predicted values.

Characterization of OLM-NLCs
Particle Size and PDI
Photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS) is used to determine particle size and polydispersity index. It works on the principle of dynamic light scattering (DLS) and is a non-invasive technique for measuring the size of very small particles in the dispersion using Zetasizer (Nano-s90; Malvern Instruments UK). The freshly prepared OLM-NLC sample (0.2 mL) was taken and diluted further to 10 mL of pre-filtered double-distilled water. The sample was sonicated to prevent the aggregation of particles before the size analysis.
Surface Morphology
The surface morphology of OLM-NLCopt was observed using transmission electron microscope. The sample was prepared by placing a drop of TMZ-NLCs on a copper grid and air-drying for 1 min [ , ]. Afterward, the grid was kept inverted, and a drop of 2 M aqueous solution of phosphotungstic acid (PTA) was applied for contrast enhancement. The excess PTA was removed by using filter paper, and the morphology was studied using TEM (Morgagni 268D, USA) operating at 80 kV. A combination of bright-field imaging at increased magnifications and diffraction modes was used to reveal the morphology of NLCs.
Entrapment Efficiency (EE) and Drug Loading (DL)
EE and DL of NLCs was calculated by determining the amount of free drug by ultracentrifugation techniques using an ultracentrifuge (Remi ultracentrifuge, Mumbai, India). Then 5 mL of NLC suspension was centrifuged at 25,000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant was collected, appropriately diluted, and quantified by UV spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan) at 254 nm [ ]. Consequently, the %EE and %DL were calculated by the following formulas: $$ {\displaystyle \begin{array}{l}\mathrm{Drug}\ \mathrm{loading}\left(\%\right)=\frac{\mathrm{Total}\ \mathrm{amount}\ \mathrm{of}\ \mathrm{OLM}-\mathrm{Amount}\ \mathrm{of}\ \mathrm{OLM}\ \mathrm{in}\ \mathrm{supernatant}}{\mathrm{Weight}\ \mathrm{of}\ \mathrm{NLCs}\ \mathrm{recovered}\times 100}\\ {}\mathrm{Entrapment}\ \mathrm{efficiency}\left(\%\right)=\frac{\mathrm{Total}\ \mathrm{amount}\ \mathrm{of}\ \mathrm{OLM}-\mathrm{Amount}\ \mathrm{of}\ \mathrm{OLM}\ \mathrm{in}\ \mathrm{supernatant}}{\mathrm{Total}\ \mathrm{amount}\ \mathrm{of}\ \mathrm{OLM}}\times 100\end{array}} $$
Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)
DSC study was done to determine the interaction between the excipients and drug. The pure drug and lyophilized OLM-NLCopt were separately sealed in an aluminum pan and kept in the machine (DSC Q100; TA Instruments). The study was performed between 50 and 300 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min in a nitrogen atmosphere. An empty pan was used as a reference and an inert atmosphere was maintained by purging with nitrogen during the study.
X-Ray Diffractometer Analysis (XRD)
X-Ray powder diffraction spectra of neat OLM and OLM-NLCopt were obtained using X-ray diffractometer (Miniflex 600; Rigaku). The system was operated at 15 mA, using the Cu Kα1 line as the radiation source. The samples were scanned from 3° to 50° (2 θ ) and diffractogram was obtained with a scanning rate of 4°/min.
In Vitro Drug Release Study and Mechanism
The comparative release study of NLCs was performed using activated dialysis bag technique membrane (molecular weight 12,000 g/mol; Sigma, MO, USA) with slight modification [ ]. The specified volume of OLM-NLCopt (2 mL) was placed in a pre-activated dialysis bag and both ends sealed. The bag was dipped in 250 mL release media (phosphate buffer pH 6.8 and phosphate buffer pH 4) at 37 ± 2 °C with continuous mixing at 50 rpm [ , ]. The released samples (1 mL) were withdrawn at predetermined time intervals for 24 h and replaced with the same volume. The collected samples were filtered through 0.2 μm membrane filter (polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane filters) and an amount of drug release was calculated by using a UV spectrophotometer. The data of drug release was incorporated into various release kinetic models as zero order model, first order model, Higuchi model, Hixon–Crown model, and Korsmeyer–Peppas and Weibull models [ ], and the best fit model was determined from the regression coefficient ( R 2 ) value.
In Vivo Absorption Assessment
The animals were procured from Institutional Animal Ethical Care Committee (IAEC), Jamia Hamdard, New Delhi, India, as per approved protocol (DS2016/IAEC/002). The mice of either sex weighing 20–25 g were selected for experiments and divided randomly into two groups ( n = 3). The mice were housed in a clean room with 12 h light and 12 h dark with free access to food and water ad libitum. The study was conducted as a single-dose design under fasting condition and both formulations were administered using an 18-gauge oral feeding cannula. The dose (1 mg/kg) was calculated on the basis of body surface area ratio of a rat to that of a human [ ]. The mice were anesthetized using diethyl ether and blood samples were collected in precoated EDTA tubes as an anticoagulant at different time intervals for 24 h. The samples were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min, and plasma was separated and stored at − 20 °C until further analysis. The plasma sample was added to 1 mL acetonitrile containing 1% ( v / v ) glacial acetic acid and vortexed for 2 min. Followed by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was separated, reconstituted using 200 μL mobile phase, and then analyzed by UPLC. The various pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by using Win Non-Lin version 4.0 (Pharsight Corp., Mountain View, CA).
Stability Study and Determination of Shelf Life
The stability study of the OLM-NLCopt was carried out as per guidelines given in the ICH Q1A (R2) (ICH topic Q1 (R2), 2009). OLM-NLCopt was stored at 25 ± 2 °C/65 ± 5% RH and 40 ± 2 °C/75 ± 5% RH for a period of 6 months in a stability chamber (Thermo lab, TH 90S). The samples were withdrawn at predetermined time intervals (0, 30, 60, 90, and 180 days) and analyzed. The graph was plotted between percent log drug remaining versus time (in days) to determine the degradation rate constant ( k ) where the slope of the curve was determined from the graph. $$ Slope=-\frac{k}{2.303} $$ where k is the degradation rate constant.
The shelf life of OLM-NLCopt was calculated at 25 °C by calculating the time required to degrade 10% of the drug in the NLC from the following equation: $$ {t}_{10\%}=\frac{0.1054}{k_{25^{\circ }C}} $$ where t 10% is the time required to degrade 10% of the drug in the NLCs.
Result and Discussion
Equilibrium Solubility Study
The results of solubility studies of OLM in different excipients were performed and results revealed that OLM has shown maximum solubility in Precirol ATO5 as solid lipid (44.32 ± 3.11 mg/g) and Transcutol HP as liquid lipid (52.47 ± 1.98 mg/mL) selected for NLC formulation. This solubility result is also supported by another report demonstrating that the solubility of a drug in a liquid lipid is higher than in a solid lipid [ ]. Different surfactants and co-surfactants were screened to check the emulsification efficiency. The results showed that Tween 80 (198.05 ± 7.45 mg/mL) was the most efficient surfactant and showed the maximum solubilizing power with the drug. Besides its emulsification efficiency, Tween 80 is a nonionic surfactant and thus is less toxic. The data of miscibility study revealed that blend exhibited better solubility for OLM in contrast to their individual lipids. This ratio showed that maximum solubility was selected for the formulation of NLC. Therefore, based on the above result among the different ratios studied, Precirol ATO5/Transcutol HP (7:3) ratio was selected for the formulation. OLM presented pH-dependent solubility, and the reported solubility of OLM in phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) is 128 μg/mL. The calibration curve was plotted between 2 and 20 μg/mL.
Data Analysis by Design Expert Software
The three-level, three-factor experimental design was applied to optimize OLM-NLCs prepared by hot emulsion probe sonication techniques. The three-dimensional plots are shown in Fig. 1 a–f for all three responses, size ( Y 1 ), PDI ( Y 2 ), and entrapment efficiency ( Y 3 ), respectively. These plots are known to study the interaction effects of the factors on the responses at one time. Fig. 1 a – f 3D response surface plots showing the influence of independent variables [lipid (Precirol ATO5), surfactant (Tween 80), and sonication time (min)] on size ( a , b ), polydispersity index ( c , d ), and entrapment efficiency ( e , f ) for the OLM-NLCs
Effects of Dependent Variables on Particle Size (Y 1)
The particle sizes of all formulations were varied in the range of 99.4 to 174.4 nm as shown in Table 1 . The particle size was clearly influenced by all three independent variables. The interaction effect of independent variables on particle size is shown on 3D response surface plots (Fig. 1 a, b). The mathematical relationship between independent variables and particle size for NLC is given by the following equation. $$ \mathrm{Particle}\ \mathrm{size}\left({\mathrm{Y}}_1\right)=+152.00+20.94{\mathrm{X}}_1-13.80{\mathrm{X}}_2+0.76{\mathrm{X}}_3-5.75{\mathrm{X}}_1{\mathrm{X}}_2+3.17{\mathrm{X}}_1{\mathrm{X}}_3+9.65{\mathrm{X}}_2{\mathrm{X}}_3-22.29{\mathrm{X}}_1^2+3.54{\mathrm{X}}_2^2-3.39{\mathrm{X}}_3^2 $$
As per the above polynomial equation, lipid concentration ( X 1 ) has shown a positive effect, whereas Tween 80 concentration ( X 2 ) has shown a negative effect on particle size. The highly significant factor governing the size of particles include lipid concentration ( X 1 ; p = 0.0034, F value of 18.77), while surfactant concentration and sonication time has shown lesser effect than lipid concentration ( X 2 , p = 0.0245, F value 8.15; and X 3 , p < 0.0871, F value 0.025). From the above equation, it was clear that the higher lipid concentration leads to an increase in particle size whereas increase in the Tween 80 concentration leads to a decrease in particle size. The value of “Prob > F ” less than 0.05 indicates the model term is significant. The “Pre R 2 ” of 0.9144 is in reasonable agreement with the “Adj R 2 ” of 0.9789 (Table 2 ). Table 2 Summary of regression analysis for responses Y 1 (particle size, nm), Y 2 (polydispersity index), and Y 3 (entrapment efficiency, %) for fitting to different models Model R 2 Adjusted R 2 Predicted R 2 SD % CV Remarks Particle size ( Y 1 ) Linear 0.8521 0.8553 0.8017 – – – 2F1 0.8714 0.8652 0.7143 – – – Quadratic 0.9812 0.9867 0.9138 2.55 1.13 Suggested Polydispersity index ( Y 2 ) Linear 0.6523 0.6411 0.6123 – – 2F1 0.6874 0.6567 − 0.9578 – – Quadratic 0.9883 0.9898 0.9654 1.21 0.56 Suggested Entrapment efficiency ( Y 3 ) Linear 0.6235 0.5991 0.4476 – – 2F1 0.4525 0.4623 0.3765 – – Quadratic 0.9989 0.9983 0.9923 0.78 0.23 Suggested
Effects of Formulation Variables on Polydispersity Index (Y 2)
PDI is the measure of the heterogeneity of sizes of particles and the value of polydispersity index for OLM-NLC formulations varies from 0.13 to 0.39. The result of the study indicates that the PDI of NLCs was quite wide . The smaller value of PDI is highly desirable in order to have the uniform size distribution in the formulations and higher value leads to variation in the size. The mathematical relationship between independent variable and PDI for NLC is given in equation $$ \mathrm{PDI}\left({\mathrm{Y}}_2\right)=+0.31-0.078{\mathrm{X}}_1+0.051{\mathrm{X}}_2+0.036{\mathrm{X}}_3-0.020{\mathrm{X}}_1{\mathrm{X}}_2+0.066{\mathrm{X}}_1{\mathrm{X}}_3-0.043{\mathrm{X}}_2{\mathrm{X}}_3+4.500\mathrm{E}-003{\mathrm{X}}_1^2+4.250\mathrm{E}-003{\mathrm{X}}_2^2+0.056{\mathrm{X}}_3^2 $$
The interaction effect of independent variables on PDI is shown on 3D response surface plots (Fig. 1c, d ). The polynomial equation showed the increase in surfactant concentration and sonication time leads to an increase in PDI with p < 0.0141 at the significant level, while sonication time showed less effect than lipid concentration ( p < 0.0001). From the above equation, it was clear that the concentration of Tween 80 has shown a positive effect while lipid concentration and sonication time have a positive effect. The sonication time has shown an increase in PDI due to non-uniformed reduction in the particle size or may be due to some particle growth. The higher concentration of surfactant produces high PDI that may be due to production and stabilization of smaller particles. The “Pre R 2 ” of 0.9843 is in reasonable agreement with the “Adj R 2 ” of 0.9811 (Table 2 ). The polynomial equation showed the lipid concentration and surfactant direct positive effect, whereas probe amplitude has a negative effect on PDI. Increasing the lipid concentration, the PDI increased with significant level, whereas an increase in surfactant concentration shows less increase in PDI.
Effect of Formulation Variables on Entrapment Efficiency (Y 3)
The interaction effect on EE is shown in 3D response surface plots (Fig. 1 e, f). The effect of various independent variables on EE was studied and the following equation was obtained: $$ \%\mathrm{Entrapment}\ \mathrm{efficiency}=+\mathrm{0.88.61}+3.43{\mathrm{X}}_1+1.0{\mathrm{X}}_2-0.54{\mathrm{X}}_3+0.60{\mathrm{X}}_1{\mathrm{X}}_2+0.41{\mathrm{X}}_1{\mathrm{X}}_3-0.85{\mathrm{X}}_2{\mathrm{X}}_3-3.64{\mathrm{X}}_1^2-0.25{\mathrm{X}}_2^2-0.91{\mathrm{X}}_3^2 $$
The polynomial equation showed that the lipid concentration and Tween 80 concentration have shown a positive effect and lead to significant increase in EE, while sonication time showed a negative effect ( p < 0.0001). As the lipid concentration increases, the EE also increases due to the higher concentration of lipid that solubilizes a higher amount of drug in the lipid and greater amounts of the drug were entrapped inside the oil-enriched lipid core. This can be explained due to the presence of more imperfections in the highly ordered solid lipid crystals due to the incorporation of a liquid lipid. Surfactant concentration has shown dual nature on the EE. It first increases the EE and then decreases after its concentration increases. The increase in EE due to optimum concentration of surfactant prevents leaching of the drug from the lipid matrix. The “Pre R 2 ” of 0.9876 is in reasonable agreement with the “Adj R 2 ” of 0.9721 (Table 2 ). The highly significant factor governing the EE include lipid concentration ( X 1 ; p = 0.0029, F value of 24.11), while surfactant concentration and sonication time showed less effect than lipid concentration ( X 2 , p < 0.032, F value 6.12; and X 3 , p < 0.0654, F value 0.054).
Optimization and Validation
The responses of all 17 formulations were fitted to different kinetic orders (first order, second order, quadratic models) and the best-fitted model for the developed formulations was found to be quadratic. The results of both the actual value (experimental value) and the predicted value (shown by software) were found to be very close to each other. The closeness between these two responses validates the results of all responses. The more closeness between the actual value to the predicted value shows that the results from the experimental process were accurate. Furthermore, it also shows the linear graph between the two values. The point prediction method of the Design Expert software® was used to select the optimized formulation (OLM-NLCopt) on the criteria of attaining the smaller particle size and polydispersity index with higher entrapment efficiency. The formulation composition with lipid mixture 3.1% ( w / v ), surfactant 4.2% ( w / v ), and sonication time 6.2 min was found to fulfill requisites that optimized formulation. The OLM-NLCopt has shown the particle size of 138.7 nm (Fig. 2 ), polydispersity index 0.18, and entrapment efficiency of 83.65%. The result was found to be very close to the predicted value of particle size (141.2), polydispersity index (0.19), and entrapment efficiency (81.22%) generated by design expert software. Fig. 2 Particle size image of OLM-NLCopt
Drug Loading
The DL for OLM-NLCs was found to be in the range of 7.24 ± 0.87% to 9.88 ± 1.23%. The high value of drug loading may be achieved due to the high solubility of OLM in both oil and in the lipid. It was found that as the concentration of total lipid increases, the drug loading also increases. The changes in the lipid content also reduced the escape of the drug into the external phase [ , ] . The lipophilic nature of OLM was the main reason for the high entrapment and loading into the lipids. However, drug loading in lyophilized NLC was found to be lower; this may be due to the destruction of the lipid structure during freezing and dehydration process of lyophilization.
Surface Morphology
The surface morphology of OLM-NLCopt was observed using TEM technique as depicted in Fig. 3 . The image of OLM-NLCopt showed an almost spherical structure and displaying sealed structure. The particle diameters were consistent with the results obtained by DLS characterization. Fig. 3 Transmission electron micrograph of OLM-NLCopt
Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)
The DSC thermogram of pure OLM and lyophilized OLM-NLCopt are shown in Fig. 4 a and b. The pure OLM showed sharp endothermic peaks at 182.24 °C (Fig. 4 a) indicates that the drug is in highly crystalline form. The drug peak shifted at 169.66 °C exhibited by OLM in lyophilized OLM-NLCopt was found less sharp and with a small peak, indicating that OLM was encapsulated by the NPs. It indicates a change in the melting behavior of drug and inhibition of crystallization using lipids and surfactants. The peak at 57.64 °C represents the presence of lipid in the stable crystalline form in NLC formulation. There were no other peaks visible in the formulation, which proved the stability of NLCs using the lipid in the formulation [ , ].

X-Ray Diffractometer Analysis (XRD)
The diffraction spectrum of pure OLM and overlay image of physical mixture and lyophilized OLM-NLCopt are shown in Fig. 5 a and b. The image showed a significant difference between the diffraction patterns of the OLM and lyophilized OLM-NLCopt. The image of OLM exhibited an intense and distinct peak having characteristic 2 θ value at around 8.1, 12.6, 13.3, 14.3, 18.9, and 25.3, indicating the highly crystalline nature of the drug. The diffraction patterns of OLM-NLCopt were characterized by the diffused spectra and disappearance of characteristic peaks of the OLM. The disappearance of intense peak in the lyophilized OLM-NLCopt was due to the transformation of the crystalline form of OLM to amorphous form, and this polymorphic transformation proved that the drug was molecularly dispersed in the lipid matrix [ ].

In Vitro Release Study and Release Mechanism
The comparative in vitro drug release study was performed with OLM-NLCopt and OLM susp. The OLM-NLCopt showed the biphasic release behavior with an initial burst release and steady sustained release profile. The percent cumulative drug release after 24 h for OLM-NLCopt was found to be 71.54 and 63.45% in phosphate buffer (pH 6.8), whereas OLM-susp showed only 38.90 and 25.36% release in phosphate buffer (pH 4) (Fig. 6 ). The initial burst release was achieved due to the presence of neat OLM in the outer phase of the particles. The sustained release pattern found due to the presence of surfactant enhances the solubility of OLM in lipid core [ ]. The lipophilic nature of the OLM could be another reason for the sustained release of the drug. The observed release kinetics for NLC was found to be Higuchi model as indicated by higher R 2 values of 0.9914 (Table 3 ). The best fit model was further characterized with n value to determine the mechanism of release pattern. The obtained value of n = 0.325 showed the release behavior of Fickian diffusion. There are many factors that can influence the release of a drug from NLCs, including the solubility of the drug in the lipid, the lipid matrix and its concentration, and the size of the particles [ ]. The n values were found for Fickian diffusion (0–0.5), non-Fickian (0.5–1), zero order (1), and super diffusion (> 1) for spherical particles [ ].

Pharmacokinetic Study
The plasma concentrations versus time profile of OLM following an oral administration of OLM-NLCopt and OLM-susp in mice model and the calculated pharmacokinetic parameters are given in Table 4 and Fig. 7 . The comparative plasma concentration profile showed a significant difference between OLM-NLCopt and OLM-susp at different time points. The OLM-NLCopt showed peak concentration ( C max ) of 412.78 ± 6.48, which was found to be significantly higher ( p < 0.01) over OLM-susp (165.78 ± 9.67 ng/mL). The T max of OLM-NLCopt takes a shorter time to reach maximum concentration (1.5 h) after administration, whereas OLM-susp takes 3 h to reach the maximum concentration. The rapid absorption of OLM in could attribute to the increased aqueous solubility and nanometric size effect after loading into NLCs. The difference between T max of OLM-NLCopt formulation was found significant ( p < 0.05) when compared to that of OLM-susp. The observed difference in AUC 0– t of OLM-NLCopt was found to be significant as compared to OLM-susp ( p < 0.05). The significantly high AUC value observed with OLM-NLCopt indicates increased bioavailability of the drug as compared to OLM-susp. The absorption of OLM from OLM-NLCopt resulted in about 3-fold increase in bioavailability as compared to OLM-susp. The result of the absorption study showed that OLM-NLCopt was much more effective than OLM-susp. There are multiple mechanisms involved in the enhanced bioavailability of OLM from lipid formulation [ ]. Due to the nanosize of lipid particle which has a larger effective surface area, avoidance of first-pass metabolism due to the influence of surfactant on the preferential uptake of lipid particles by Peyer’s patches also results in improved bioavailability. In addition, NLCs could significantly improve the solubilization capacity of OLM in the GI tract, which was a prerequisite for its intestinal absorption. The therapeutic efficacy of OLM depends upon the plasma concentration and could be more effective than OLM-susp in clinical trials.

Stability Studies and Determination of Shelf Life
There were minimal changes found in the initial values of particle size, PDI, entrapment efficiency, and drug loading after 6 months of storage. There was no phase separation found in the formulation over storage. The degradation rate constant and shelf life for OLM-NLCopt were calculated at 25 °C and found to be < 5% (0.8122 × 10 −4 ) and 566 days.
Conclusion
NLCs of OLM were successfully formulated by employing melt-emulsification method combined with the ultrasonication technique using lipid blend as the lipid phases. The formulated NLCs with lowest particle size and highest entrapment efficiency, loading efficiency, and drug release were selected for further in vivo study. The in vivo pharmacokinetic studies showed significant enhancement in bioavailability and may replace conventional oral dosage form. The formulated OLM-NLCopt was found to be stable and showed a shelf life of 566 days. The overall investigations of the present study showed that the developed formulation was an alternate drug delivery system for increasing the OLM bioavailability through the NLC methodology.
