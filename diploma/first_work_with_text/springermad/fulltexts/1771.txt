Introduction
Cerebellar contribution to working memory in humans has been established based on human cerebellar lesion and functional imaging studies in healthy subjects [ , , , ]. According to the model of Baddeley and Hitch [ ], working memory has been subdivided into different components. The central executive is thought to be the core component which controls slave systems, i.e., the phonological loop, the visuospatial sketchpad, and—as a link between working memory and long-term memory—the episodic buffer [ ]. The phonological loop is concerned with memorizing input which can be verbalized into the phonological store. Contents of the phonological store can be refreshed by subvocal articulation (“motoric rehearsal”). The visuospatial sketchpad is used for more complex visual information, which cannot be easily verbalized (e.g., abstract pictures, shapes, spatial orientations). Besides controlling the slave systems, the central executive is responsible for directing attention to relevant information and inhibiting irrelevant input, shifting between tasks and retrieval strategies and monitoring/updating working memory content [ ]. Neuroimaging studies point to a left cortical lateralization for verbal working memory and to a right cortical lateralization for visual working memory [ , ]. The central executive can be regarded as an amodal system which elicits bilateral cerebral activation patterns [ , ].
In functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of working memory, two paradigms have most commonly been used: the Sternberg task [ ] and the n-back task [ ]. In Sternberg tasks, at first a set of stimuli (e.g., six letters) is presented for an initial short period (encoding). Thereafter, a variable time without stimulus presentation follows, during which the information has to be maintained. Verbal information relies on articulatory rehearsal, visual information on the visuospatial sketchpad to refresh the input during this maintenance phase. Finally, for retrieval, a stimulus (e.g., single letter) is presented and participants have to decide whether this stimulus was also presented during encoding. During n-back tasks, single stimuli are presented one by one to participants. They have to judge if the current stimulus matches the stimulus before (“1-back”) or two/three stimuli before (“2-back”, “3-back”). The n-back task emphasizes manipulation of information and executive control more than stimulus maintenance, which is crucial in Sternberg tasks. Therefore, the executive functions are thought to dominate the contributions of the slave systems in n-back settings and possibly override asymmetries induced by the phonological loop and the visuospatial sketchpad [ ].
For example, bilateral activation of the cerebellar cortex was found during an n-back working memory task without evidence of lateralization regardless of verbal or abstract visual content [ , ]. It was concluded that the bilateral activation pattern is best explained by a contribution to the central executive. Specific contributions to verbal (phonological loop) or visuospatial (visuospatial sketchpad) processing would have likely led to lateralized activations [ ], as outlined above. Thus, n-back tasks are well suited to study the role of the central executive in working memory fMRI studies.
The aim of the present study was to further explore a cerebellar contribution to the central executive. Given that the cerebellum supports the central executive in n-back working memory tasks, one would expect increasing cerebellar activation with increasing working memory demands. Therefore, we compared activation following a 0-back, 1-back, and 2-back working memory task for both verbal and abstract modalities.
Methods
Participants
A total of 34 healthy participants (mean age of 26.8 ± 3.6 years, female/male: 15:19) were included. Exclusion criteria were known neurological or psychiatric disorders, compromised vision or motor deficits that would impair the behavioral demands of the working memory n-back task, and age under 18 years. Informed consent was obtained from all the participants. The study was approved by the local ethics committee. All participants were right-handed as assessed by the Edinburgh handedness scale [ ]. Seven participants were excluded from the final analysis. Exclusion criteria were insufficient behavioral performance in the n-back task ( n = 6) as described below and translational head movement exceeding 3 mm ( n = 1). Therefore, data of 27 participants (mean age 26.6 ± 3.8 years, female/male 12:15) were included in group statistical analysis.
N-Back Task
The n-back tasks for verbal and abstract stimuli were conducted using a block design in separate fMRI runs in close accordance to our prior study [ ]. A total of 20 stimuli were visually presented one at a time over a total interval of 30 s. The stimulus presentation time was 1300 ms with an inter-stimulus interval (ISI) of 200 ms in which a central fixation cross was presented. In the verbal working memory (WM) condition, six different letters (A, B, C, D for 1- and 2-back; X, Y for 0-back) served as stimuli, while six non-nameable shape stimuli [ ] were used in the abstract WM version (Fig. 1 ). All stimuli were projected in white on a black screen and had the same block-wise frequency. Participants responded to the task via button press. Key press responses were acquired using a fiber optic response keypad system (Lumitouch HHSC-1 × 4-CL/-CR, http://www.curdes.com/ ). In the 0-back task, two predefined stimuli indicated right or left presses on the device. In the 1-back task, the current stimulus had to be compared with the preceding stimulus. In case that both stimuli were the same, the trial was considered correct and participants had to press the right button. For incorrect trials, the left button had to be pressed. In the 2-back task, the current stimulus had to be compared with the second-to-last stimulus. Stimuli were counterbalanced to achieve 50 % correct trial combinations. Fig. 1 Abstract non-nameable stimuli generated according to method 1 of Attneave and Arnoult [ ] (compare[ ]), used with permission
The block design consisted of 16 rest blocks lasting 18 s each (white fixation cross on black screen), 15 introductory blocks indicating the following condition (0-back, 1-back, 2-back) lasting 4 s each, and 15 active blocks (5× 0-back, 5× 1-back, 5× 2-back) lasting 30 s each (Fig. 2 ). The total length of the n-back runs was 406 scans lasting 13:40 min. Generation and triggering of the visual stimuli as well as collection of behavioral data were done using E-PRIME software ( http://www.pstnet.com/eprime.cfm ). The visual stimuli were projected onto a screen and were viewed via a mirror mounted on a head coil inside the MRI scanner. Prior to scanning, two blocks for each condition were used to familiarize the subjects with the task. Fig. 2 Block design scheme of the n-back tasks used for verbal and abstract modality. The paradigm consisted a total of five blocks per condition (0-back, 1-back, 2-back), which were presented in an alternating order
fMRI Scanning
A whole-body 7-T MR scanner (Magnetom 7 T, Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) was used to acquire blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) contrast-weighted echo-planar images (EPIs) for functional scans. Head movements were reduced with the help of wedge-shaped bolsters. All fMRI images were acquired with a 32-channel head coil (Nova Medical, Wilmington, USA, www.novamedical.com ). Each EPI session consisted of 406 scans with 45 coronal slices: repetition time (TR) = 2000 ms, echo time (TE) = 23 ms, bandwidth 1108 Hz/pixel, field of view (FOV) = 220 × 220 mm 2 , matrix 128 × 128, parallel MRI (pMRI) GRAPPA R = 2, and acquisition time (TA) = 13:40 min. Flip angle alpha was 76° (Ernst angle). Non-interpolated voxel size was 2.0 × 2.0 × 1.0 mm 3 . The readout gradients used were sinusoidal. Because of magnetization relaxation effects, the first six volumes in each session were discarded from further analysis. The scans covered the entire cerebellum. To avoid ghost artifacts, coronal slices were measured with the phase-encoding direction feet to head (see [ ] for a more detailed explanation).
In addition, a three-dimensional (3-D) transverse volume of the entire brain was acquired using a T1-weighted magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo sequence (MPRAGE; 256 sagittal slices, TR = 3500 ms, TE = 3.71 ms, TI = 1100 ms, bandwidth 560 Hz/pixel, FOV = 256 × 224 mm 2 , matrix = 256 × 224, pMRI GRAPPA R = 2, TA = 6:15 min, flip angle 6°, and non-interpolated voxel size of 1 × 1 × 1 mm 3 ).
Image Analysis
Image analysis was performed using statistical parametric mapping (SPM) 8 (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK, www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/ ). The EPI images were realigned to correct for head motion, resulting in the creation of a mean EPI image. The first image was selected as a reference, and all images from all paradigms were realigned to this. Images were manually aligned to the spatially unbiased atlas template (SUIT) of the human cerebellum [ ]. The mean image was then used as a reference image to coregister the realigned functional images to the anatomical T1 image of the individual participant. For the first-level statistical analyses, a general linear model (GLM) was applied [ ] to the realigned and coregistered, but otherwise unsmoothed, EPI images. Prior to the statistical analyses, the parameter “defaults.mask.thresh” in SPM was changed from 0.8 to 0.5 to avoid signal dropouts within the hypointense cerebellar nuclei. The time series of each voxel was fitted with a corresponding task regressor that modeled a box car convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function. A temporal high-pass filter (cut off 128 s) was used to correct for the low-frequency drifts in the data, and serial autocorrelations were taken into account by means of an autoregressive model first-order correction (AR(1)).
For each of the experimental tasks, a significant change in the BOLD effect compared to the rest condition was tested. In addition, subtraction analysis was performed at the group level using the SPM “Image Calculator” function specifying the following contrasts: 2-back > 0-back and 2-back > 1-back.
Cerebellar Cortex
For the normalization of cerebellar cortical data, the T1-weighted images were deformed to fit the SUIT template of the human cerebellum using the SUIT toolbox in SPM8 [ ]. The program initially isolates the cerebellum and creates a mask. For each participant, the mask was manually corrected with the help of CARET software ( http://brainvis.wustl.edu/wiki/index.php/Caret:About ). Non-linear deformation was then applied to each contrast image. The normalized images were resampled at 1 × 1 × 1-mm 3 resolution and then smoothed by a 3-D convolution with an isotropic Gaussian kernel of 4-mm full width at half maximum (FWHM). After normalization, second-level statistical analysis was performed and consisted of one-sample t tests of contrasts. The cerebellar cortical activations are shown at a threshold of 0.05, family wise error (FWE) corrected for multiple comparisons. This corresponds to paradigm-dependent thresholds of t = 5.81 (all verbal n-back tasks) and t = 5.86:5.78:5.82 (abstract 0-back/1-back/2-back). For contrasts defined by subtraction analysis, the respective threshold of the minuend paradigm was used (e.g., t = 5.82 for abstract 2-back > abstract 1-back). Beta estimates within each cerebellar lobule were compared between the three conditions using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures. Only lobules with significant activation following subtraction analyses were considered in order to confirm the results of subtraction analyses. If a significant effect of condition was detected, post hoc paired t tests were used to determine significant differences between 2-back vs. 0-back and 2-back vs. 1-back tasks. Whenever the sphericity assumption was not met, degrees of freedom corrected using the Greenhouse-Geisser method are reported. The probabilistic atlas of the cerebellar cortex was used to define cerebellar lobules [ ]. Please note that the vermal lobules VIIaf and VIIat according to Schmahmann et al. [ ] are designated as vermal lobules crus I and crus II in this atlas.
Dentate Nuclei
The dentate nuclei were identified as hypointensities on the mean image and marked as regions of interest (ROIs) using MRIcroN software ( http://www.sph.sc.edu/comd/rorden/mricron/ ). For normalization, a modified version of the SUIT method described above was used. This normalization algorithm tries to deform the T1 image so that it fits to the SUIT template, while optimizing the overlap between the ROI and a dentate template [ ]. To avoid activation surrounding the dentate nucleus being smoothed into the ROI, the functional images were masked with the dentate ROI before normalization. The normalized functional data from the dentate nuclei were resampled at 1 × 1 × 1-mm 3 resolution and then smoothed with a 3-D convolution with an isotropic Gaussian kernel of 4 mm FWHM.
The random field (RF) cluster size correction was not considered suitable for this dataset because the search volume was very small. Bootstrap analysis was therefore used to correct the significance level for multiple tests [ ]. Sets of 27 random samples were drawn from all contrast images (with replacement) and multiplied with 1 or −1 to randomize the sign. For each of these simulated datasets, a t map was calculated and thresholded p = 0.005 uncorrected [ t (26) = 2.78], searching in both the left and right dentate. Following 1000 bootstrapping iterations, the value that would only occur in 5 % of the random datasets was determined. The corrected peak t value was 3.59 for both datasets. To describe the localization of dentate activations, the dentate template was divided into a dorsal and ventral section as described previously [ ].
Beta estimates from each dentate subdivision with significant activation following subtraction analyses were compared between the three conditions using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures. If a significant effect of condition was detected, post hoc paired t tests were used to determine significant differences between 2-back vs. 0-back and 2-back vs. 1-back tasks.
Results
Behavioral Data
The number of correct responses and reaction times were calculated for each participant in the three conditions (2-back, 1-back, 0-back) and for both tasks (abstract and verbal n-back tasks). As expected, the mean number of correct responses was highest and reaction times were shortest in 0-back tasks, followed by 1-back and 2-back tasks (Fig. 3 ). Insufficient task performance in 2-back tasks was defined as response accuracy below 1.5 standard deviations (SD) from the mean (threshold 65.86 % for verbal condition and 60.18 % for abstract condition). A two SD threshold is frequently applied to differentiate between “normal” and “abnormal” performance. Yet, using a 2 SD threshold (52.56 % for abstract, 59.1 % for verbal modality) would have led to inclusion of participants performing close to 50 % of correct responses which equals the probability of guessing in n-back tasks. Thus, we decided to use the 1.5 SD threshold to exclude participants who were not able to sufficiently solve the 2-back task. Two participants performed insufficiently in verbal 2-back and three participants in the abstract 2-back task. One participant had insufficient performance in both conditions. These participants ( n = 6) were excluded from subsequent analysis. Fig. 3 Behavioral data for the n-back tasks in verbal and abstract modality (mean ± standard deviation)
Cerebellar Cortical Activation
Cerebellar cortical activations are shown in Fig. 4 and Table 1 (verbal modality) and Fig. 5 and Table 2 (abstract modality). The patterns of activation were largely the same in the verbal and abstract tasks as reported in a previous study of our group [ ]. Most activation during the 0-back task was observed ipsilaterally to the finger press in lobules IV, V, VI, crus I, and lobule VIII. This activation pattern is typical for cerebellar activation in motor tasks such as finger tapping [ ]. It reflects dominating motor demands in the 0-back task, while cognitive demands are low. For the 1-back task, a similar pattern was seen with additional bilateral activation in four different locations: firstly, at the border region of lobule VI/crus I, secondly, within more inferior cerebellar structures (lobules VIIb and VIII), thirdly, within the posterior paravermal cerebellar cortex (lobules VI, crus I, and crus II), and fourthly, within the vermis (lobules VI, VIIb, VIIIa). This is largely consistent with meta-analyses of functional imaging results of cerebellar contribution to working memory/executive function tasks [ , ]. The 2-back task showed further increasing activation in similar locations as in the 1-back task comprising both cluster size and BOLD signal intensity. Additionally, there was also more prominent vermal activation (lobules crus II, IX, X) and lobule IX activation.

Subtraction analysis confirmed increasing bilateral activation of the above-mentioned areas with increasing task complexity. For the 2 back > 1 back contrast, activation was observed primarily within the posterior paravermal region, comprising bilaterally lobules VI, crus I, and crus II for the verbal modality and crus I and crus II for the abstract modality. In addition, vermal activation (lobules VI, VIIIb, IX) was present in the abstract modality. For the 2 back > 0 back contrast, we observed activation located at the border region of lobule VI/crus I in the lateral cerebellar cortex, within the posterior paravermal cortex (lobules VI, crus I, crus II), extending also to vermal lobule crus II for the abstract modality. Furthermore, there were significant clusters in the infero-lateral cerebellum (lobules crus II, VIIb, VIII, IX) and the vermis (lobules VI, crus II, VIII, IX).
To further confirm these observations, we conducted an ANOVA analysis of mean activation (i.e., beta estimates) from the lobules showing activation in the subtraction analyses (Fig. 6 , Table 3 ). As expected, there was significantly increasing activation in every lobule with higher task complexity. Highest activations were commonly found in the 2-back tasks.

Dentate Nucleus Activation
Dentate nucleus activations are shown in Fig. 7 and Table 4 . For the verbal modality, there was stronger activation with increasing working memory demands similar to the cortical activations. While 0-back and 1-back tasks led to almost exclusive activity ipsilateral to finger movements, stronger contralateral activation was detected during the 2-back paradigm. Furthermore, largest clusters and highest t values were found in the 2-back condition. Activations were present in both the dorsal and ventral parts of the nucleus, which is consistent with the segregation of the dentate nucleus into a motor and a non-motor area [ , ]. Subtraction analysis (2-back > 0-back) showed a single activated voxel in the left ventral-rostral nucleus, which is paralleled by significant increase of activation in ANOVA analyses within this subdomain (Fig. 6 , Table 4 ). Subtraction analysis for 2-back > 1-back revealed no significant difference between conditions. However, there was a clear trend for higher activation in the 2-back task in comparison to the 1-back task (215 vs. 105 activated voxels, higher t values in the 2-back task, higher mean activation). The abstract n-back tasks were not associated with increasing activations following higher n-back loads. The 0-back task already showed significant bilateral activity comprising the dorsal and ventral domains. Activation patterns did not change significantly following the 1-back and 2-back tasks. Following subtraction analysis, no significant activation was observed.

Discussion
Our results show that cerebellar cortical activation in n-back working memory tasks scales up bilaterally with increasing central executive demands independent of the underlying modality (verbal or abstract). This increase in activation can be mapped to four distinct cerebellar areas: (i) the border region of lobule VI and crus I, (ii) inferior parts of the lateral cerebellum (lobules crus II, VIIb, VIII, IX), (iii) posterior parts of the paravermal cerebellar cortex (lobules VI, crus I, crus II), and (iv) the inferior vermis (lobules VI, VIIb, VIII, IX). Task-related increases were less robust at the level of the dentate nuclei and were observed for the verbal modality only.
Two prior studies of our group investigated cerebellar activation patterns for similar 2-back > 0-back contrasts for both abstract and verbal modalities [ , ]. The results were in close accordance to the present study with prominent bilateral activation in the lateral cerebellar cortex involving lobule VI and crus I. Moreover, all studies revealed activation of more inferior parts of the lateral cerebellum (crus II, lobule VIIb, and VIII), posterior paravermal parts (lobule VI, crus I, and crus II), and vermal activation. While in the 1.5-T fMRI study of Hautzel et al. [ ], dentate activation was not reported, Thürling [ ] found caudal dentate activation using a 7-T MRI scanner and the same ROI-based analysis [ ]. Current results reinforce their findings.
There was a common pattern of additionally activated clusters with increasing task complexity for both verbal and abstract modalities. First, we found a cluster that was located at the border region of lobules VI/crus I and extended bilaterally. Cluster localization is typical for cerebellar activations in working memory fMRI studies based on meta-analyses [ , ]. Different fMRI studies, reviewed in an article by Marvel and Desmond [ ], tried to further characterize the exact functional role of this region in working memory. The authors found an association with the encoding phase during a Sternberg task [ ] which was thought to represent a subvocal articulation of verbal content since this region responds robustly to verbal but not non-verbal stimuli [ ]. Our group also found activation of this region following non-verbal stimuli [ , ]. Thus, there seems to be further functional relevance besides subvocal articulation for encoding of verbal content, which can be explained by amodal central executive demands.
Within the infero-lateral cerebellum, lobules crus II, VIIb, VIII, and IX had higher activity in response to increasing executive demands. Lobules VIIb and VIII have been well recognized as contributors to working memory [ ]. Their specific function was related to phonological storage during the maintenance phase of verbal Sternberg tasks [ ]. Since phonological storage requirements to solve abstract n-back tasks are minimal, increasing bilateral activity with more complex n-back paradigms for both modalities in this study also supports inferior cerebellar involvement to the amodal central executive. The activation found bilaterally within the posterior aspect of the paravermal cerebellar cortex may be explained along similar lines. The available meta-analysis data are in accordance with executive function and working memory involvement of that region [ , ].
Vermal activations were reported in some working memory functional imaging studies [ , , , ], although two meta-analyses did not support vermal activity [ , ]. The functional role of the vermis in working memory is so far less clear. In general, the vermis is classically thought to support motor function for control of whole-body posture [ ] or eye movement [ ]. Likewise, Desmond et al. [ ] argued that one possibility for the vermal activity elicited when comparing a high vs. low load verbal Sternberg task was, in fact, related to oculomotor control, since participants had to read six letters (high load condition) vs. one letter (low load). However, authors recognized that a motoric rehearsal task in their study with higher demands for oculomotor control did not lead to comparable activation, making oculomotor demands an unlikely source of vermal activity in this context. Within the framework of the cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome [ , ] the posterior vermis has been designated as the “limbic cerebellum” giving rise to primarily affective symptoms when lesioned, while cognitive symptoms are more prominent after lesions of the posterior lobe (lobules VI and VII). Yet, further morphometric and lesional studies do support a clearer contribution of the vermis also to cognitive functioning. For example, injury to the inferior vermis predicted a poor cognitive outcome after cerebellar tumor surgery [ ], and cognitive deficits in patients with fragile X syndrome or autism spectrum disorders are correlated with smaller inferior vermis size [ , , ]. The results of the present study showing increasing vermal activity as a function of executive load support vermal contribution to central executive demands. Further support for this notion comes from morphometric studies linking the attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) to decreased volumes of the inferior vermis [ , ]. ADHD patients exhibit executive dysfunctions as a core feature of their neuropsychological profile [ ].
For the verbal modality, dentate nucleus activations increased in parallel with more demanding n-back tasks. However, significant differences were only observed in the 2-back > 0-back comparison. The increases in the 2-back > 1-back comparison remained at a trend level ( p = 0.079). Activation was spread throughout the nucleus comprising the dorsal and ventral parts which is in agreement with previous studies [ , ]. The dorsal part of the nucleus is considered the motor domain based on its connectivity to cortical motor areas, while the ventral part makes up the non-motor area due to connections to the prefrontal and parietal cortex [ ]. It is remarkable that increasing activation was also observed in dentate motor parts although motor demands did not change among tasks. This might be explained by recruitment of neurons projecting from the dorsal nucleus to the premotor area [ ], since the premotor area is thought to contribute to an amodal executive network in n-back tasks as outlined in more detail below [ ].
Ventral activation observed after subtraction analyses points to stronger involvement of the non-motor part with higher executive load. In their study, adding executive demands to a verbal Sternberg task, Marvel and Desmond [ ] reported stronger dorsal dentate activation during maintenance and enhanced ventral activation following retrieval. While the activation pattern for the abstract modality was similar, we did not find increasing activity comparing the different n-back tasks. It may be that, already, the abstract 0-back task poses some executive demands for attention and stimulus differentiation leading to relative strong activations at the dentate level. Nevertheless, the abstract results were not expected and are at odds with our previous findings showing bilateral dentate activation for the 2-back > 0-back contrast [ ].
Apart from the use of the n-back task which favors central executive demands in working memory, the bilateral nature of increasing cerebellar activation is suggestive of central executive recruitment. For example, cerebellar activation is more prominent on the right side in response to verbal Sternberg tasks [ , ] presumably as a result of primarily using the phonological loop for this task. In contrast, cerebellar activation in tasks favoring executive functions is bilateral [ ] including also vermal activation [ ] as reported in the present study. This is in agreement with the bilateral cortical activation pattern of the frontal and parietal cortices during n-back tasks of different modalities [ ]. Specifically, a meta-analysis describes a bilateral network (comprising the dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, the premotor cortex, cingulate gyrus, and posterior parietal cortex) that is active during n-back tasks regardless of verbal or non-verbal modality [ ]. Another recent meta-analysis considering a variety of working memory fMRI tasks identified a similar “core network” sparing parietal areas [ ]. This core network is amodal and thus engaged independent of the task entity or task modulation. Authors concluded that the core network may be the neural base of the central executive, highlighting that the central executive is not confined to a particular brain region but rather implemented in a multinode neural network. The neocortical activations following n-back tasks were also shown to respond to higher working memory loads as found for the cerebellar activations in this study [ ]. Our present data strongly support the contribution of the cerebellum to this executive network in n-back tasks within cerebello-cerebral loops [ ]. Connectivity to the premotor, prefrontal, or parietal cortices has been shown in animal experiments for those cerebellar lobules that showed increasing activation following more executive demands in our study. The premotor cortex is target of cerebellar output from lobules V, VI, crus I, crus II, VII, and VIII [ ], while the prefrontal cortex is targeted by crus II and—to a lesser degree—the vermis (lobules VII, X) [ ]. The parietal cortex receives input primarily not only from lobules VI, crus II, and VIII but also from lobule IX and the posterior vermis (lobules VIII–X) [ ]. Likewise, studies of functional connectivity in humans show bilateral participation of cerebellar lobules to the executive network (lobules VI, crus I, crus II, VIIb, IX; [ ] or fronto-parietal network (lobules VI, crus I, crus II, VIIb, VIIIb, IX; [ ]).
Of note, the framework of the Baddeley and Hitch model is only one possible way to explain the role of the cerebellum in working memory. There are other models of working memory on one side and more general theories of cerebellar function on the other which allow to explain the current findings as well [ ]. From that perspective, the idea that predictive forward and inverse internal models reside within the cerebellum was originally applied to motor control [ ] and has been extended to cognitive functions [ , ]. According to the “modular selection and identification controller” (MOSAIC) model multiple pairs of controllers (inverse models) and predictors (forward models) are tightly coupled as functional units within the cerebellum [ ], supporting functions attributed to the central executive in the Baddeley and Hitch model [ ]. To put the current study within that framework, two results have to be pointed out. (1) The increasing neuronal activation in multiple cerebellar locations indicates a combination of multiple modules used to solve more demanding working memory tasks consistent with an anatomical modularity. (2) Several overlapping regions significantly more engaged when executing 1-back or 2-back tasks (e.g., lobules VI, VIIb) suggest that internal models in these regions represent common abilities to solve n-back tasks consistent with a functional multiplicity.
In conclusion, our data are in line with the view that the cerebellum participates in a modality-independent bilateral multinode neuronal network representing the central executive during working memory n-back tasks. Cerebellar activity is likely embedded into loops with the frontal and parietal cortices.
