Introduction
Cardiovascular diseases, especially coronary artery disease and ischemic heart disease, are the leading cause of death among humans worldwide; in particular, acute myocardial infarction accounts for a large portion of cardiovascular disease-associated mortality [ ]. Timely reperfusion that rapidly restores oxygen and blood supply results in smaller infarct size, improves patient survival and prognosis, and is a therapeutic measure used to treat myocardial ischemia. Although necessary to alleviate ischemic myocardium, ischemia reperfusion (I/R) causes transient injury following ischemia [ , , ]. As early as 1986, Murry first described ischemia preconditioning (IPC), in which preceding brief episodes of I/R reduced myocardial infarct size in a canine model [ ]. IPC has since been successfully demonstrated in several animal species, including mice, and has been confirmed in humans [ , , ]. Remote ischemia preconditioning (RIPC) elicits remote cardioprotection following the ischemia of kidney, intestine, limbs, liver, skeletal muscle, and brain [ , , , ]. Although IPC and RIPC have emerged as powerful methods for ameliorating I/R injury to the myocardium, their use as clinical cardioprotective strategies to attenuate the pathophysiological consequences of I/R injury is limited by the inability to predict the onset of clinical ischemia. Recently, Zhao reported a postconditioning cardioprotective strategy and determined that while the first 30 min of reperfusion is critical; during this time, postconditioning stimuli can still effectively reduce myocardial injury after I/R [ ]. IPC and ischemic postconditioning are powerful endogenous protective strategies against the I/R injury of several organs, including heart, brain and kidney [ ]. However, all of these cardioprotective strategies are limited in that they require the use of an ischemic stimulus to a second organ, which is not clinically desirable. We have identified an innovative cardioprotective phenomenon that occurs subsequent to remote trauma (abdominal incision) and have termed this phenomenon “remote preconditioning of trauma (RPCT)”; our published results demonstrate that this phenomenon reduces infarct size by 80–85 %. Thus, this phenomenon represents the most powerful cardioprotective phenomenon reported to date [ ]. The Gross et al. confirmed that RPCT operated in dogs and rats, and confirmed the requirement of bradykinin signaling, while pharmacologic blockade of adenosine and opioid signaling had no effect, unlike in IPC [ , ].
Ischemic postconditioning is a protective stimulus that can be administered at the beginning of reperfusion and can easily be performed as a post-ischemic intervention to decrease myocardial injury in patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass graft. Moreover, RPCT has been demonstrated to be one of the most powerful cardioprotective phenomena. Therefore, the remote postconditioning of trauma (RPostCT) appears able to provide effective cardioprotection. Previous studies have found that RPCT requires neurogenic signaling involving spinal nerves and the activation of cardiac sensory and sympathetic nerves and that it relies on the activation of PKC signaling involving K ATP channels for cardioprotection [ ]. Thus, the mechanism of RPCT is unique and distinct from those that have been elucidated for IPC and RIPC. Here, we studied 1) the cardioprotective effect of RPostCT, 2) the factor(s) that act as remote initiator(s) of RPostCT and how these factors elicit cardioprotection, and 3) the neurological basis of the cardioprotective effects of RPostCT. Collectively, these results are significant because the identification and characterization of a novel mechanism of RPostCT will allow for the development of new surgical preventive strategies to protect the heart from I/R injury in clinical settings.
Materials and Methods
Animals
Mice were maintained according to the Harbin Medical University institutional guidelines for the administration of laboratory animals, the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH, revised 1985) and the Position of the American Heart Association on Research Animal Use (1984). All procedures performed in this study involving mice were in accordance with the ethical standards of Harbin Medical University. Mice (B6129SF2/J F2, strain 101,045) in which the bradykinin type 2 receptor (BK2R) is not expressed due to targeted disruption of the Bk2R gene (BK2R−/−) were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). The development of BK2R gene knockout animals and Bk2R genotyping has been previously described [ , ]. Wild-type mice (B6129SF2/J F2) were obtained from the Harbin Medical University Animal Center and are as close as possible to the genetic background of the BK2R −/− mice.
Male and female animals were distributed equally among groups, and all mice used in this study were between 10 and 16 weeks of age. Post hoc analyses confirmed previous results indicating that there were no gender-related differences regarding RPostCT in mice. The research protocol was approved by the institutional ethics committee for the administration of laboratory animals at Harbin Medical University, China.
Mouse Model and Surgical Procedures
The experimental design is outlined in Fig. 1 . The mice were anesthetized using sodium pentobarbital (90 mg/kg, i.p.), intubated with PE 90 tubing, and ventilated using a mouse mini-ventilator (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA, USA). Mice then received a 45-min coronary occlusion, followed by a 2-cm transverse incision on the abdominal midline at the end of coronary occlusion (before reperfusion of coronary). The incision extended through the skin and muscle and into the peritoneum, and was immediately closed using 7–0 polypropylene sutures. The abdominal incision and the suture of incision took 2 min. The bleeding was minimal (<50 μL) [ , ]. Blood pressure and ECG (Digi-Med Sinus Rhythm Analyzer, Micro-Med, Inc., Louisville, KY) data were recorded 10 min before and during ischemia and for 10 min after reperfusion. The ventilation conditions used included a rate of 100 ± 5 breaths/min and tidal volume of 2.2 ml. The body temperature of the mice was maintained at 36 ± 1 °C [ ]. Infarct size was measured 24 h after cardiac reperfusion. To examine the long-term protection provided by RPostCT, infarct size was determined 4 weeks after reperfusion. Sham control mice were not subjected to abdominal incision, and experimental control mice were not given an abdominal incision but did receive pharmacological or surgical intervention (sham + treatment). RPostCT mice received pharmacological or vehicle treatment (RPostCT + treatment or RPostCT + vehicle, respectively). All mice were continuously monitored by electrocardiography. Fig. 1 Schematic representation of the experimental design. Time courses associated with pharmacological manipulations, surgical procedures and I/R are shown for the four experimental groups (sham, RPostCT, RPostCT + treatment, and RPostCT + vehicle)
For assessment of arterial blood gas, mice were anesthetized using sodium pentobarbital, intubated with PE 90 tubing, and ventilated. A catheter was inserted into the carotid artery, and the chest then opened through a midline sternotomy. Arterial whole blood samples were drawn from the carotid artery with a heparin coated syringe after mice received coronary occlusion. A 248 pH/Blood Gas Analyzer (9 2DX; Essex Co., Halstead, UK) was used for the measurement of pH, blood gas (pCO2, pO2).
To investigate whether the spinal cord was involved in the neural pathway of cardioprotection induced by RPostCT, we transected the spinal cord at different levels at 15 min prior to the 45-min myocardial ischemia. Mice were anesthetized (90 mg/kg, i.p.) and ventilated. Bone markers were identified at the thoracic vertebra C7 and T7 levels, and the spinal cords of C7 and T7 were transected by a sharp knife under a microscope, followed by abdominal incision at the end of coronary occlusion. The incision was immediately closed using 7–0 polypropylene sutures. The infarct size was determined 24 h after reperfusion. Sham controls were subjected to the same surgical manipulations and procedures (i.e., anesthesia, shaving, opening the skin and muscle, exposing the spinal column), but without actually cutting of the cord.
Assessment of Infarct Size and Apoptosis in the Myocardium
Twenty-four hours after reperfusion, mice were treated with phenobarbital sodium (90 mg/kg, i.p.), and the hearts were separated from the mice and perfused with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). After PBS perfusion, 2 % 2, 3, 5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining solution was added to identify ischemic tissue, and non-ischemic tissue was stained using 5 % phthalocyanine blue. Next, the hearts were harvested and fixed in 10 % formalin for histological studies and infarct size determination [ , , ]. Midventricular cardiac tissue sections were sliced in sections to assess infarct size and for TUNEL staining. In situ DNA fragmentation of apoptotic cells was assessed using the DeadEnd™ Fluorometric TUNEL system (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) followed by staining with an anti-sarcomeric actin antibody (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and staining with the nuclear dye DAPI (Invitrogen, South San Francisco, CA) [ , ]. TUNEL-positive (green) nuclei were counted in ten randomly chosen microscopic fields of the midventricular cardiac section (5 slices) and were expressed as a percentage of total nuclei (approximately 400 per animal). Apoptosis was determined using a cell death detection ELISA kit (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN, USA), which quantifies histone-complexed DNA fragments (nucleosomes) in the cytoplasm of apoptotic cells in a sandwich ELISA. The results were normalized to internal standards and expressed as fold increases over the control [ , ].
Pharmacological Intervention
The ganglionic blocker hexamethonium (Hex, 20 mg/kg, intravenous) [ ], the BK2R antagonist Hoe 140 (50 μg/kg, intravenous) [ ], the norepinephrine inhibitor propranolol (2 mg/kg, intravenous) [ ], and the PKC inhibitor chelerythrine (5 mg/kg, intravenous) [ ] were administered 15 min prior to 45-min coronary occlusion. All injectable drugs were dissolved in physiological saline. In all studies, vehicle controls were administered with the specific vehicle required for each agent referenced above. For all of the abovementioned agents, the vehicle control was the same as the vehicle used for each drug.
Statistical Analysis
As for sample size estimation, a 20 % difference in mean with standard deviation of 0.035 within a group was assumed according to our previous study [ ]. In a one-way ANOVA study, sample size of four for each group with the total sample of 16 subjects is obtained from the four groups whose means were to be compared, which could achieve 91 % power using multiple comparison test at a 0.05 significance level. Therefore, using a sample size of 10 for each group would achieve adequate power for the analysis. For parameters that required quantification and to evaluate statistical significance, the results were expressed as means ± SEM. Infarct size and risk region size were analyzed with a one-way ANOVA followed by unpaired Student’s t-tests (2-tailed distribution and 2-sample unequal variance) with the Bonferroni correction [ , ]. For multiple group comparisons, one-way analysis of variance followed by a Fisher’s post hoc test was used. Differences for which p ≤ 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 5 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).

Analysis of Artery Blood Gases
Mice ( n = 10) were ventilated at a rate of 100 ± 5 breaths/min and a tidal volume of 2.2 ml. Blood was drawn from the carotid artery for measurement of arterial blood gases, as described above. Animals showed a normal arterial pH (7.36 ± 0.02), P O 2 (235.3 ± 17.62 mmHg), and P CO 2 (26.3 ± 1.6 mmHg).
RPostCT Reduces Infarct Size and Apoptosis after I/R
A significant reduction was observed in infarct size after RPostCT (Fig. 2 a; 57 ± 2.7 % sham vs. 15.6 ± 2.16 % RPostCT; p ≤ 0.05; n = 10). The extent of apoptosis was assessed in both sham and RPostCT hearts after I/R. We used in situ end labeling of DNA fragmentation (TUNEL staining) and an ELISA-based nucleosome assay. A large decrease in the proportion of TUNEL-positive nuclei was observed in the myocardia of mice subjected to RPostCT (Fig. 2 b; 32.5 ± 1.3 % vs. 14.1 ± 1.1 %; p ≤ 0.05; n = 9). After RPostCT, quantitative nucleosome assay results showed that the level of mononucleosomes and oligonucleosomes was decreased relative to the sham control (Fig. 2 c).
Long-Acting Protection of RPostCT on Infarct Size
To demonstrate whether RPostCT provides long-term cardioprotection, infarct size was assessed 4 weeks after abdominal incision (the incision was made at the beginning of reperfusion). The results showed a sharp decrease in infarct size 4 weeks after RPostCT (Fig. 2 d; 41.7 ± 2.3 % vs. 7.5 ± 0.9 %; p ≤ 0.05; n = 10). This decrease in infarct size was significantly greater than that previously seen 24 h after RPostCT.
Bradykinin Receptor 2 (BK2R), β-Adrenergic Receptors (AR) and Protein Kinase C (PKC) Signaling Participate in the Cardioprotective Effects of RPostCT
To investigate whether the molecular mechanisms of RPostCT involve BK2R, β-AR and PKC signaling, BK2R knockout mice were studied. RPostCT did not exert a cardioprotective effect against myocardial infarction in BK2R knockout mice (Fig. 3 a; 56.7 ± 1.4 % BK2R knockout sham vs. 55.3 ± 2.1 % BK2R knockout RPostCT; p > 0.05; n = 10). Groups of mice were treated with the BK2R antagonist Hoe 140 (50 μg/kg) or vehicle 15 min prior to abdominal incision (Fig. 3 b). Based on infarct size, the BK2R receptor blocker completely blocked the cardioprotection induced by RPostCT (59.4 ± 2 % sham Hoe 140 vs. 56.3 ± 2.5 % RPostCT Hoe 140; p = 0.36; n = 10).
To assess whether RPostCT requires β-adrenergic signaling after RPostCT, groups of mice were treated with propranolol (2 mg/kg) or vehicle 15 min prior to abdominal incision (Fig. 3 c). Based on infarct size, the NE receptor blocker completely blocked the cardioprotection that was induced by RPostCT (57.2 ± 2 % propranolol vs. 14.7 ± 1.7 % vehicle; p ≤ 0.05; n = 10).
Similarly, mice were treated with chelerythrine (5 mg/kg, intravenous) or vehicle 15 min prior to abdominal incision. The blocking of PKC abolished the cardioprotection elicited by RPostCT (56 ± 2.9 % chelerythrine vs. 13.9 ± 1.6 vehicle, p ≤ 0.05; n = 10) (Fig. 3 d).
Cardioprotection after RPostCT Depends on Neurogenic Transmission
To determine whether neurogenic transmission is required for cardioprotection against MI by RPostCT, the sympathetic ganglionic blocker hexamethonium (20 mg/kg) was used to block the transmission before the RPostCT stimulus. The results demonstrated that neurogenic transmission played an important role in the cardioprotective effect induced by RPostCT (Fig. 4 a; 14.3 ± 1.6 % RPostCT vs. 55.7 ± 2.2 % RPostCT hexamethonium; p ≤ 0.05; n = 10). The spinal cord was then transected at vertebral levels C7 and T7 before RPostCT (Fig. 4 b). Transection of the spinal cord at C7 had no effect on RPostCT (Fig. 4 b; 15.5 ± 1.7 % sham vs. 16.8 ± 1.5 % C7 transection; n = 8). However, transection at T7 abolished the cardioprotective effects of RPostCT against MI (Fig. 4 b; 16.7 ± 1.6 % sham vs. 57.4 ± 2 % T7 transection; p ≤ 0.05; n = 8).
Discussion
Cardiac I/R injury contributes significantly to morbidity and mortality worldwide. A common pathologic change in heart disease is blood supply deficiency, which leads to myocardial infarction. Thus, suppressing myocardial I/R injury remains an important challenge. Although IPC and RIPC strategies continue to be widely applied as powerful model systems to elucidate potential therapeutic targets for I/R injury, their clinical usage is limited in practice due to the lack of prior knowledge of an ischemic event. However, remote ischemia preconditiomning induced by transient limb ischemia (cuff inflation and deflation of upper arm reduced endothelial IR injury in humans, and reduced experimental myocardial infarct size) [ ]. That result showed that transient limb ischemia was a simple preconditioning stimulus with important potential clinical applications. Furthermore, most patients arrive at the emergency room only after perceiving symptoms and thus suffer ischemia before coronary intervention. Therefore, it is extremely important to explore other clinically feasible and effective therapeutic strategies that address post-ischemic myocardial injury. Treatments that could be employed at reperfusion would be particularly valuable. Postconditioning that occurs at the beginning of reperfusion (after index ischemia) provides benefits for the ischemic myocardium, elicits a cardioprotective effect and is of great importance due to the widely recognized clinical relevance of cardioprotective strategies that can be applied at reperfusion. RPostCT might be more protective than ischemic or pharmacologic postconditioning because the protective signal travels via the cardiac nerves and does not require the re-establishment of blood flow; thus, cardioprotective signaling after RPostCT might rapidly protect more of the myocardium at reperfusion than other methods.
In a previous study, we found that activation of a specific skin nerve field (abdominal skin) through C-fiber nociceptors could protect against cardiac I/R injury [ ]. The fact that RPCT did not depend on transient ischemic trigger or the interruption of blood flow in organs or tissues fit with this finding. Thus, this study is innovative in that it develops the concept that skin nociceptor regulation might be an easily manipulated method of using neurogenic signaling to affect organ function, including protection against ischemic injury [ ] and RPCT is TNF-α-independent, unlike IPC [ ]. These results demonstrate that the mechanism of RPCT is unique and distinct from those of IPC and RIPC; thus, the cardioprotective mechanism of RPCT is novel. In a previous study, we found that the mechanism of RPCT involved the bradykinin subtype 2 receptor, the β-adrenergic receptor, protein kinase C and the mitoKATP channel in the myocardium [ ] and cytochrome 450 epoxygenase pathway was also involved in the cardioprotection elicited by RPCT [ , ].
In this study, we analyzed myocardial apoptosis using TUNEL staining and evaluated DNA fragmentation based on the formation of DNA nucleosome ladders in RPostCT. We found that remote RPostCT by surgical incision is equally as protective as RPCT (Fig. 2 b, c). This finding is extremely important due to the potential clinical significance of developing a treatment that could be given at reperfusion. Furthermore, infarct size was assessed 4 weeks after reperfusion, and infarct size was decreased by 81 % 4 weeks after RPostCT (Fig. 2 d). This decrease in infarct size is significantly greater than that observed previously 24 h after RPostCT and MI, suggesting that some adaptive remodeling might occur over the long-term after RPostCT. We consider it likely that this improvement in function is caused by the long-term reduction in post-I/R injury and MI. Taken together, these data support the idea that RPostCT provides long-term protection after MI and confirm the long-term protection provided by and clinical relevance of the RPostCT effect.
Bradykinin (BK), when released from sympathetic nerve endings in the heart during the brief IPC or remote IPC period [ , ] contributes to preconditioning of the heart by promoting norepinephrine (NE) release [ ]. Ample evidence suggests that NE, which is released from cardiac sympathetic nerve endings during ischemia, [ ] activates adrenoceptors [ ] and leads to preconditioning in vivo [ , , ] and in vitro [ ]. Based on published results that show that BK and the BK2R are required for IPC and RIPC [ , , ] and our published data regarding RPCT [ ], we sought to determine whether the BK2R receptor was also involved in RPostCT. In this preliminary study, we subjected four groups of mice ( n = 10), wild type mice and BK2R knockout mice, to I/R. Two groups were subjected to a RPostCT stimulus (abdominal incision) at reperfusion, and infarct size was assessed 24 h post-reperfusion. In the group of BK2R knockout mice, we found that the genetic abrogation of BK2R signaling completely prevented the protective effect of RPostCT against MI (Fig. 3 a). Further, the BK2R antagonist Hoe 140 also prevented the cardioprotective effect that was elicited by RPostCT (Fig. 3 b). Similarly, mice were treated with the NE receptor blocker propranolol or saline during a 45-min ischemia 15 min prior to the abdominal incision, which was performed at the start of reperfusion. We found that propranolol could completely block the cardioprotection induced by RPostCT (Fig. 3 c). These results illustrate that BK2R and NE are required for RPostCT.
The PKC signaling pathway plays an integral role in many of the signaling cascades that govern cellular behavior [ ]. Although one of the most highly expressed myocardial PKC isoforms, PKC-α is the least studied because, unlike PKC-δ and ε, PKC-α is not regulated in acute myocardial ischemia [ ]. Translocation modification has confirmed that PKC-δ is a critical mediator of post-ischemic cardiomyocyte necrosis and contractile dysfunction in mice, rats, and pigs [ , ]. In the normal myocardium, PKC-ε forms signaling complexes with various proteins that can be classified as structural elements, signaling molecules, and stress-responsive proteins. PKC-ε-dependent cardioprotection induces the dynamic modulation of these complexes, suggesting that these complexes play a role in the genesis of protection against I/R injury [ ]. Gross et al. showed that signaling by epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) was important downstream of bradykinin signaling in RPCT [ , ]. Though EETs were thought to act locally in an autocrine or paracrine manner, longer-distance actions cannot yet be ruled out in RPCT. Finally, a topical inhibitor of PKCγ, which was a neuron-specific PKC isoform, blocked RPCT, confirming the role of skin nerve fibers and providing a new pharmacologic target for inducing RPCT [ ]. The activation of BK2R and β-AR has been shown to increase the intracellular translocation of specific PKC isoforms during I/R [ , ]. In our published results, PKC signaling (increased PKC-ε and decreased PKC-δ) was found to be required for cardioprotection after RPCT and requires BK2R and β-AR activity. These results are consistent with the elicitation of PKC-mediated cardioprotection by the neurogenic stimulation of cardiomyocytes after RPCT. Therefore, in this study, we sought to determine whether PKC signaling is required for RPostCT. The results showed that the PKC receptor blocker chelerythrine can completely interdict the cardioprotection that is induced by RPostCT against MI (Fig. 3 d). These results support the hypothesis described in the introduction that RPostCT can be initiated and mediated in cardiomyocytes by intracellular signaling and the activation of cardioprotective effectors.
As the cardioprotection that is elicited by RPCT results from remote injury, we reasoned that the initiation of RPCT is mediated either by a humoral or a neurogenic pathway. In previous studies, RIPC was initiated by a neurogenic ganglionic mechanism [ ]; other investigations in which remote IPC was not affected by the ganglionic blocker hexamethonium implied the involvement of a humoral pathway but not a neuronal pathway in RIPC. In our previous study, we concluded that the ganglionic blocker (Hex) inhibits impulse transmission from both the preganglionic sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons and abolishes the protection of RPCT against MI, thus supporting a neurogenic mechanism [ ]. To determine whether the neurogenic mechanism is required for RPostCT, we treated mice with Hex (20 mg/kg, intravenous) 15 min prior to abdominal incision. Abdominal incisions were made in mice at the beginning of reperfusion. As shown in Fig. 4 a, the cardioprotective effect that is elicited by RPostCT was blocked by Hex.
We performed complete spinal cord transections at C7 or T7 in various groups of mice, followed by immediate abdominal incision 24 h before I/R. Infarct size was determined 24 h after reperfusion, during which time the mice remained under anesthesia. The sham group received a laminectomy without spinal transection. As shown in Fig. 4 b, spinal cord transection at C7 had no effect on RPostCT; however, transection at T7 completely abolished the effect of RPostCT. Therefore, we conclude that the signal that is generated at the remote site is relayed to the heart through the spinal cord. These data unequivocally show that the thoracic spinal cord is required for RPostCT. Thus, we concluded that neurogenic transmission is the pathway that is required for the cardioprotection that is elicited by the remote postconditioning of trauma (Fig. 5 ). Fig. 5 Schematic representation of the mechanisms and signaling pathways involved in the cardioprotective effects of RPostCT. Abdominal incision activates C-fibers in the skin to release CGRP and substance P from sensory nerve endings. CGRP and substance P then act on CGRP receptors and SP-sensitive NK1 receptors on sympathetic nerve endings to evoke NE release. Meanwhile, the cardiac sympathetic nervous system is activated via the spinal nerve, leading to release of BK and NE. BK and NE initiate intracellular signaling in target myocardial cells via BK2R and β-AR, either in parallel or via cross-signaling, resulting in PKC activation. These signaling cascades ultimately result in the cardioprotective effects that are elicited by RPostCT
Limitations of this Study
RPCT has both an early and late phase. The initial molecular mechanisms of the early phase of RPCT were reported to involve neurogenic activation of PKC and activation of myocardial ATP-sensitive potassium channels in mice [ ]. However, we found that the late phase of RPCT relied on activation of PKC and NF-κB, rather than KATP channels, and was iNOS independent [ ], suggesting that there are different mechanisms between early and late RPCT. In the present study, we largely focused on the initial molecular mechanism of cardioprotection elicited by RPostCT. Although there was some overlap between the mechanisms of early phase and late phase RPCT and RPostCT, the detailed mechanisms of RPostCT were not examined; for example, the molecular signaling pathways involved after activation of PKC signaling. In addition, Seyedi et al. found that release of substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) from afferent nerves could act on sympathetic nerves to stimulate release of NE and BK, and both could act on cardiomyocytes, which possess both adrenoceptors and BK2R [ ]. However, we were unable to examine this signaling pathway in the present study. Another issue is that eight animals were used in the transection of spinal cord group, while 10 animals were used in each of the other groups. This occurred due to higher mortality in this group associated with transecting the spinal cord followed by RPostCT. Furthermore, Gross et al. reported some similar pathways involved in RPTC in rats and dogs, with several additional molecular steps including the cytochrome P450 epoxygenase pathway and activation of γPKC [ , , ]. These studies provide strong support that RPCT can protected the heart against I/R injury in a variety of species. Nevertheless, there was a large variability in the degree of infarct size recovery induced by RPCT among the various species, which may be species-specific or involve a more complex RPCT signaling pathway in different species. Although abdominal incision will never be considered as an acceptable therapy for cardiac patients, it provided a peripheral nociceptive trigger that elicited remote cardioprotection through activation of C fibers in the skin. Indeed, we previously reported that chemical stimulation (capsaicin) could also induce activation of C-fibers to elicit remote cardioprotection [ ], which would be a more clinically appropriate technique. Thus, in our follow-up study of RPostCT, we will also examine the effect of topical capsaicin applied to the abdomen at the end of 45-min myocardial ischemia or cardioprotection via stimulation of peripheral nociceptors.
Conclusion
Application of a remote nociceptive stimulus (superficial abdominal incision) at the end of ischemia can reduce myocardial infarct size after I/R injury in mice, suggesting that RPostCT is cardioprotective. Our findings support a mechanism for RPostCT whereby activation of C-fibers in the skin at the anterior abdominal location (near T9–T10) sends a signal from the spinal ganglia at T9–10 to the spinal ganglia at T1–5, which in turn initiates a signal via the cardiac sensory nerves to the heart. In the heart, the sensory nerves release CGRP and substance P, which triggers release of NE from sympathetic nerves and BK from either the sensory or sympathetic nerves [ ]. NE and BK act upon cardiomyocytes, triggering PKC activation. Thus, study will aid in the development of more clinically relevant techniques to initiate RPostCT through the nerves, which may help to reduce mortality and morbidity after MI.
