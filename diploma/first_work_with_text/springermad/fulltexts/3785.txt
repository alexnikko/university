Background and aims
Phloroglucinol is an organic compound (1,3,5-benzenetriol) which is used therapeutically for its anti-spasmodic properties. Since its discovery in the nineteenth century [ ], it has been investigated as a treatment for various diseases and is commercialised under different brand names in the European Union [ ]. The pharmacodynamics of this drug is not well known, but its benefits are thought to come from its selective relaxation of smooth muscle cells of the ureter and biliary tract [ , ]. This is probably the result of direct inhibition of voltage-dependant calcium channels on smooth muscle cells [ ], although in vivo tests in dogs [ ] and rats [ ] have not confirmed this.
According to a report by the ANSM (Agence nationale de sécurité du médicament, French National Agency for Medicines and Health-Products Safety), phloroglucinol ranked ninth in terms of the quantity of boxes sold in pharmacies in 2013 in France. According to the Vidal® (one of the leading drug references in France) [ ], there are 17 pharmaceutical specialties containing phloroglucinol and commercialised, among which 15 are reimbursed at a rate of 15% by the National Health care system if prescribed by a doctor [ ]. All in all, more than 9 million euros were spent to reimburse these drugs in 2016 in France [ ].
The aim of this study was to do a systematic review of literature and a meta-analysis of all RCT comparing the efficacy of phloroglucinol on pain versus placebo.
Methods
A systematic review of literature was carried out up to May 2017. Articles were collected from the following online databases: Medline, Cochrane Library and Embase. The keywords were chosen after an initial MeSH term search: “phloroglucinol” and “randomized controlled trial”. Before beginning this review, the protocol details were registered in Prospero on the 28th of February 2017 (Number CRD42017058259). Following the results of the search strategy, minor alterations to the protocol were adopted to better interpret the results of the trials, a Table is available for consultation to illustrate these changes.
The presentation of this systematic review follows the PRISMA recommendations [ ].
The inclusion criteria used were: Randomised clinical trials (RCT) Administration of phloroglucinol versus placebo Full-text available in English or French Pain evaluation used as a variable
Add-on studies in which one group was given the standard treatment and phloroglucinol while the other was given the standard treatment and a placebo were not excluded [ ].
There were no restrictions concerning the length of treatment, the dosage, the type of pain (acute versus chronic) or year of publication.
Studies concerning obstetric or gynaecologic-related pain were not included and will be assessed and analysed in another research.
“The Cochrane collaboration tool for assessing risk of bias” was applied [ ] by two independent readers (CB and RB) to assess the quality of the studies included. The following criteria were taken into account: sequence generation allocation concealment blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessors incomplete outcome data selective outcome reporting and other potential sources of bias.
For each element, the risk of bias was noted as low, high or unclear. The latter was chosen if the authors did not give enough details in their article to determine if the bias had been avoided or not.
The main outcome chosen was pain intensity at the end of the intervention. It was analysed dichotomically: either the patient was considered responsive or unresponsive to the treatment. The cut-off depended on the definitions of each study. As this is a binary outcome, we compared risk ratios with a 95% confidence interval. Loss to follow-up was considered as failure (i.e. non-assessed patients were recorded as non-responsive in both groups) to limit the bias of attrition.
The secondary outcome was pain relief as a continuous outcome by presentation of the mean difference or standardised mean difference if pain relief was measured differently in the included studies. As this is a continuous outcome, we planned to do, when possible, sensitivity analyses using the baseline observation carried forward (BOCF) to deal with loss to follow-up cases in the trials included.
We used Review Manager 5.3 for the quantitative analysis (meta-analysis) and a p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. A random effect model and a Mantel-Haenszel method for all analyses were chosen when heterogeneity of the trials included was suspected.
Results
The literature search with appropriate filters yielded 54 studies after removal of duplicates (Fig. 1 ). Forty-nine were excluded because the title/abstract did not meet the inclusion criteria or satisfied one of the exclusion criteria. Two further articles [ , ] were excluded because it was impossible to obtain the full-text in English or French, even after contacting the Chinese authors (Fig. 1 ). Of these two, the first study [ ] was an add-on randomised placebo-controlled trial which showed a decrease in the consumption of analgesics if IV (intra-venous) phloroglucinol was administered after surgery for mixed haemorrhoids. The second study [ ] was a randomised placebo-controlled trial which concluded that oral phloroglucinol was efficient on the symptoms of IBS (irritable bowel disease), including abdominal pain intensity.

Three RCT were therefore included into the qualitative synthesis for quality assessment and systematic review and were included in the quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis).
Study characteristics
Table 1 describes the characteristics of the three trials included in the systematic review. The two RCT [ , ] concerning renal colic were monocentre add-on interventional studies. The one concerning IBS [ ] was a multicentre interventional trial with a composite drug commercialised in France containing both phloroglucinol and its methylated derivative in the same pill. All trials used pain intensity as main outcome and considered patients responsive if there was a decrease of at least 50% of the pain intensity measured with VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) between baseline and end of treatment. All studies included a similar number of patients (varying from 236 to 307) and the age range was also similar as only adult patients were included.

Risk of bias analysis
Quality assessment was focused on internal validity [ ]. The risks of bias analysis are summarised in Fig. 2 . Fig. 2 Risk of bias graph for the three studies included in the qualitative synthesis using the Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing risk of bias [ ]
The study concerning renal colic by Boubaker et al. [ ] used sealed random code envelopes. The envelopes were then assigned to patients in numerical order; thus, randomisation was judged to bear a high risk of bias. Although, the trial is reported as double-blind by the authors, the blinding procedure for patients, personnel and investigators was considered unclear.
The study concerning IBS by Chassany et al. [ ] did not describe the protocol for random sequence generation and allocation concealment so the blinding of participants and of outcome was unclear. A high risk of bias was added for this study because the role of the sponsor was not specified and as the authors had commercial ties to the pharmaceutical company providing the phloroglucinol, it was considered that they had a vested interest in the results.
The study concerning renal colics by Fu et al. [ ] was considered at a low risk of bias in all domains.
Main and secondary outcomes
Chassany et al. found results to support the prescription of phloroglucinol to treat abdominal pain in IBS patients. They found 62% of responsive patients in the test group versus 47% in the placebo group ( p = 0.011). Table 2 shows the mean value of VAS in both study groups of the Chassany 2007 trial at the beginning and end of treatment and shows that the mean difference in final VAS was of 7.9 mm on the 100 mm scale. Table 2 Secondary outcome: pain evaluation as a continuous outcome (analysed population included only) in each study illustrated by the mean VAS (visual analogue scale) in mm at beginning and end of trial in phloroglucinol and placebo groups as described by Chassany 2007 with SD (standard deviation), by Boubaker 2009 with SD and by Fu 2013 with SEM (standard error of mean) Study Phloroglucinol group Placebo group Mean difference between final values of VAS (mm[CI 95%]) Number of patients Initial value Final value Number of patients Initial value Final value Chassany 2007, VAS mean (SD) 151 62.0 (9.0) 25.9 (20.0) 149 61.8 (8.5) 33.8 (23.2) − 7.90 [− 12.80, − 3.00] Boubaker 2009, VAS mean (SD) 126 76 (18.0) 28 (2.5) 127 74 (15.0) 30 (2.3) − 2.00 [− 2.59, − 1.41] Fu 2013, VAS mean (SEM) 114 83.4 (10.5) 15.2 (19.4) 119 81.7 (13.6) 18.1 (21.2) − 2.90 [− 8.11, 2.31] Total included population 391 395 − 2.09 [− 2.68, − 1.51] * Mean difference in mm between final values of VAS with confidence interval of 95% in brackets. * p < 0.001
Both studies concerning renal colic did not find that phloroglucinol was more effective than placebo to treat pain. Table 2 shows the mean VAS value in the phloroglucinol and placebo groups at the beginning and end of the trial. The mean difference for both of these studies is illustrated in Table 2 .
Boubaker et al. concluded that their study did not support the idea of a combined therapy of NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) and phloroglucinol. Fu et al. argued that the combination of phloroglucinol with parecoxib acted faster on pain, rather than parecoxib with placebo because pain intensity variation from baseline was significantly different at intermediate measurements. The authors argued that this decreased the prescription of rescue analgesics in their study (secondary outcome). But at the end of the treatment (120 min), there was no statistically significant difference.
Meta-analysis
The mean difference between final values of VAS calculated using the data from the three included studies found a mean difference of − 2.09 [− 2.68, – 1.51] with p < 0.001. This is illustrated in Table 2 and shows that there was a statistically significant 2.09 mm difference between the placebo and the phloroglucinol group in favour of phloroglucinol. This result was calculated using Review Manager 5.3 with the mean VAS at the end of each included trial for the analysed populations.
As illustrated in Fig. 3 , the meta-analysis found that the pooled relative risk of responsiveness was of 1.10 (95% confidence interval, 0.95–1.27) compared with placebo. There was high heterogeneity among these studies with I -squared of 62%. For this outcome, we considered cases of discontinued treatment in the Fu et al. study as a treatment failure, and so, one patient in the phloroglucinol group and two in the placebo group were considered as unresponsive. Fig. 3 Forest plot Mantel-Haenszel method with risk ratio and random effect with inferior to 0.05 considered statistically significant. Responsiveness to the treatment (phloroglucinol or placebo) was considered an event. Constructed with Review Manager 5.3
The number to treat was not calculated as the results of the meta-analysis were not in favour of phloroglucinol.
Discussion
Summary of main results
There are very few studies testing phloroglucinol versus placebo. Only three RCT were analysed, two of which did not conclude in favour of phloroglucinol. One did find positive results with p = 0.011 but at a high risk of bias. The meta-analysis found a high heterogeneity between the three studies; however, this heterogeneity disappeared ( I -squared = 0%) if only the two studies on renal colic were analysed. This is one of the draw-backs of including all studies no matter the aetiology behind the pain.
The efficacy of phloroglucinol is not confirmed for the treatment of abdominal pain in this review. Regardless, it is a commonly prescribed drug in France and its possible side effects are often over-looked [ ]. When considering the risk/benefit balance, the possible side effects of this drug must be weighed against the risk of the treated symptom. Notably for IBS, only one RCT [ ] versus placebo was found and as the symptoms of IBS are benign, it is unlikely to tip the balance in favour of phloroglucinol for this indication.
Furthermore, we found a statistically significant mean difference between the two study groups when analysing the entire included population with a difference of − 2.09 mm [− 2.68, − 1.51] on the VAS in favour of phloroglucinol, though the clinical significance of this result is questionable. Indeed, although VAS is largely validated for evaluating pain [ ], the minimal clinically important difference is usually set at 10 mm according to various studies [ , , ].
Both studies which were not included in the systematic review, because the full-texts were not available, found positive results to encourage the use of phloroglucinol to treat abdominal pain after haemorrhoid surgery or for IBS symptoms [ , ]. Another study on a smaller population [ ] found that phloroglucinol was more efficient than mebeverine to relieve IBS symptoms which is also in agreement with Chassany et al. results [ ]. In terms of pharmacodynamics, the efficacy of phloroglucinol seems to be linked to an inflexion of intestinal activity [ , , ]. It would seem important to conduct a RCT of high quality to confirm efficacy of phloroglucinol in the treatment of abdominal pain in cases of bowel disease. Indeed, in France, phloroglucinol is prescribed for abdominal pain no matter the cause: gastroenteritis, colitis, cystitis etc. [ ]. This systematic review did not find a study evaluating the efficacy of phloroglucinol for undefined causes of abdominal pain.
Both studies concerning renal colic show that pain is not alleviated by the addition of phloroglucinol to the standard treatment (NSAIDs [ , ]).
This systematic review decided to use pain as the main outcome as phloroglucinol is authorised and reimbursed in France for this indication [ ]. Nevertheless, studies measuring other variables came up in the initial database search. For example, an add-on study by Dellabella et al. in 2005 [ ] found that phloroglucinol was inferior to tamsulosin in medical expulsive therapy for distal ureteral calculi. However, this study further validated that phloroglucinol accelerated the expulsion of renal calculi compared to spontaneous expulsion rate [ ]. In another study [ ], phloroglucinol was tested against no treatment to prevent bladder spasm after TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The authors concluded that phloroglucinol was safe and effective in this indication. Other anti-spasmodic drugs have been tested to treat renal or ureteral pain, such as drotaverine which relieved pain linked to renal colic in 79% of patients versus 46% in a placebo group in a study by Romics et al. in 2003 and with few side effects [ ]. This would be in favour of phloroglucinol relieving urinary tract spasm but there is insufficient evidence to recommend phloroglucinol for the treatment of renal colic today.
Quality of the evidence
The selected studies were on average of low quality as the population was limited with a short follow-up. The only study with positive results was judged at high risk of bias because of the commercial ties with the pharmaceutical company which commercialised the drug tested. Also, this study had exclusion criteria which made it difficult to extrapolate the results to the entire IBS population. Indeed, patients with long-standing IBS (more than 10 years) were excluded and patients with a high anxiety score were also excluded. This last exclusion criterion can be criticised as it has been shown that IBS patients often have psychiatric disorders, notably anxiety [ ]. The role of placebo in IBS has been studied [ ], and so, the high efficacy of placebo in the Chassany et al. trial is consistent with the literature.
Potential biases in the review process
The databases used (Medline, Cochrane and Embase) do not provide a comprehensive search as unpublished data, conference proceedings or medical theses were not screened for inclusion. This systematic review limited the full-texts to English or French languages which led to the exclusion of two Chinese studies. In light of the few positive results published on the subject, it is possible to think that any unpublished data was also inconclusive or not in favour of phloroglucinol. Considering the number of studies included, it was impossible to create a funnel plot to evaluate this risk of publication bias.
To be sure that only the effect of phloroglucinol would be analysed, only RCTs testing phloroglucinol against placebo were chosen in the initial protocol. This was not modified during this study, although the data collected was poor in quantity and quality.
Conclusion
This is the first systematic review exploring the efficacy of phloroglucinol for the treatment of abdominal pain. In light of the weak evidence existing to support the prescription of this drug, it is surprising that it is so frequently and largely prescribed in France. This study further validates the work encouraged by the CNGE (Collège National des Généralistes Enseignants, National College of Teaching General Practitioners) in France to rigorously evaluate the efficacy of medication to improve the shared-decision process [ ].
