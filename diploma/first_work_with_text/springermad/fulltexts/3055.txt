Introduction
Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 or 3, which is also called a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), bears a significant risk of developing into an invasive carcinoma, if left untreated [ ]. Cervical conization is the gold standard for the treatment of precancerous diseases of the uterine cervix, and various types of conization methods are described in the literature [ , , , ]. The rate of recurrence after conization is reported to be approximately 5% [ , , ]. Depending on the surgical method used, the incidence of peri- and postoperative complications differs [ ]. An unsatisfactory follow-up sometimes occurs because of cervical stenosis, which can lead to unsatisfactory colposcopy with the risk of unseen relapses [ ].
The objective of this study is to identify the predictors of recurrent or persistent HSIL after cervical conization and also the risk factors for postoperative cervical stenosis.
Materials and methods
Data source
The institutional review board of the Osaka University Hospital approved the present study. Medical records in Osaka University Hospital from January 2007 to December 2014 were retrospectively reviewed, and a total of 522 cases were treated using the Shimodaira–Taniguchi conization method, with HSIL diagnosed by pathological evaluation of the conization specimens. Visibility of the squamocolumnar junction (SCJ) before conization was reported as completely visible, partially visible, or not visible, according to the criteria of the Committee on Nomenclature of the International Federation of Cervical Pathology and Colposcopy [ ].
Surgical procedures and postoperative follow-up
We routinely performed cervical conization by the Shimodaira–Taniguchi method using an Honest Medical High Frequency Surgical Unit (MGI-202; Honest Medical, Tokyo, Japan) under intravenous anesthesia, as described in previous reports [ , , ]. The conization technique is illustrated in Fig. 1 . A 0.25-mm linear excision electrode was inserted into the cervical canal and rotated to extract the cone of tissue as a single informative specimen. The resected cervical tissue was carefully divided into 12 specimens and evaluated by pathologists. Within 3–4 months after conization, cervical cytology was conducted in 483 of the 522 patients, although the remaining 39 patients did not obtain cytology. Results of cervical cytology were reported according to the 2001 Bethesda System [ ]. Fig. 1 Shimodaira–Taniguchi conization method
Outcome measurement
We analyzed for factors potentially predicting the occurrence after conization of recurrent or persistent diseases or cervical stenosis. Recurrent/persistent disease after conization was defined as an occurrence of HSIL, diagnosed by histopathological evaluation of a biopsy or a subsequent surgical specimen, at any time after the initial conization was performed. Cervical stenosis was defined as a cervical narrowing that limited or prevented insertion of collection devices for obtaining cervical cytology samples or uterine sound, or a closed os requiring surgical intervention, or any other cases in which a clinician recorded the presence of stenosis in the medical records.
Statistical analysis
Recurrence-free probability was analyzed using the Kaplan–Meier method and was evaluated for statistical significance by the log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed to identify factors that could potentially affect the risk of recurrent/persistent diseases after conization. Nominal variables were dichotomized arbitrarily (presence vs. absence), and continuous variables (age) were dichotomized after the building of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Variables of interest were entered into a regression model using a Cox proportional hazard model.
Proportions of categorical variables were analyzed for statistical significance using the χ 2 test. Multivariate logistic regression was applied to identify variables that could potentially predict cervical stenosis after conization.
A value of p < 0.05 was considered to be significant when the data were compared between two groups. Bonferroni’s correction was used to assess differences among three groups: a value of p < 0.016 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis was conducted using JMP Pro 12 statistical software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).
Results
Patient characteristics
The characteristics of the 522 patients in this study are shown in Table 1 . The median age was 38.5 years (range, 20–83 years), and the median postoperative follow-up period was 19 months (range, 0–107 months). Of the 522 patients, 183 women (35%) were nulliparous; 142 women (27%) had smoked, and 275 women (53%) had never smoked; the smoking status of the remaining 105 women (20%) was unknown. SCJ visibility was evaluated as follows: “completely visible” in 322 women (62%), “partially visible” in 89 (17%), “not visible” in 90 (17%), and “unknown” in 21 (4%). The number of specimens obtained by the Shimodaira–Taniguchi method was also evaluated; in most cases (66%), a single adequate specimen was extracted. Of the 522 patients, 29 (5.6%) underwent cervical conization within 12 months after a childbirth.

Independent predictors of recurrent or persistent disease after conization
Overall, 25 of the 522 patients (4.8%) had an occurrence of a recurrent/persistent disease during the observation period. A total of 390 patients (74.7%) had negative margins in their resected specimens. The corresponding number of patients with a positive surgical margin was 87 (16.7%). In 8.6% of the patients (45 of 522), the resection margins were uncertain. As shown in Table 2 , the following baseline factors were associated by univariate analysis, with a higher recurrence/persistence rate: elderly (age equal to or older than 46 years) ( p < 0.001), SCJ visibility ( p = 0.0023), positive/uncertain surgical margin status ( p < 0.001), and abnormal cervical cytology within 3–4 months after conization ( p < 0.001). Parity, smoking status, and the number of pieces of the resected specimens were not significantly associated with recurrent/persistent disease. In multivariate analysis, the baseline factors independently associated with recurrent/persistent diseases were increasing age [hazard ratio (HR) 3.6, 95% CI 1.36–10.3, p = 0.0092] and positive/uncertain surgical margin status (HR 13.44, 95% CI 5.07–46.37, p < 0.001).

As shown in Fig. 2 a, recurrence-free probability of the elderly patients (aged ≥46) was significantly lower than that of younger patients ( p < 0.001). Figure 2 b shows that patients with a positive/uncertain surgical margin demonstrated a significantly higher rate of recurrent/persistent diseases compared to that of patients with a negative surgical margin ( p < 0.001).

Recurrence-free survival was assessed according to a number of the aforementioned poor prognostic factors; that is, according to whether the patients had 0, 1, or 2 total poor prognostic factors. As shown in Fig. 3 , recurrence-free survival was inversely correlated with the number of poor prognostic factors possessed by the patients. Patients with two risk factors (increasing age and surgical margin involvement) showed poorer prognosis than patients with no ( p < 0.001) or one risk factor ( p < 0.001). Two-, 3-, and 6-year recurrence-free probability in elderly patients with surgical margin involvement was 0.64, 0.59 and 0.39, respectively.

Risk factors associated with cervical stenosis after conization
Overall, cervical stenosis during the postoperative period occurred in 28 of the 522 patients (5.4%). Severe stenosis requiring surgical intervention (mechanical dilatation, reconstructive surgery, or hysterectomy) occurred in 4 of these 28 patients. Four of the 29 patients who underwent conization within 12 months after childbirth experienced cervical stenosis after conization, as did 15 of the 141 patients aged ≥46 years. As shown in Table 3 , in univariate analysis, the following baseline factors were associated with cervical stenosis: age ≥46 [odds ratio (OR) 3.37, 95% CI 1.56–7.28, p = 0.0011], SCJ visibility (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.04–4.85, p = 0.0351), and a shorter interval from childbirth to conization (within 12 months) (OR 3.13, 95% CI 1.01–9.70, p = 0.0382). In multivariate analysis, the baseline factors independently associated with cervical stenosis were age ≥46 years (OR 4.27, 95% CI 1.88–10.07, p < 0.001) and the shorter interval from childbirth (OR 5.42, 95% CI 1.42–17.41, p = 0.016).

Discussion
In the current study, the preoperative and postoperative risk factors potentially associated with recurrent/persistent HSIL and cervical stenosis after therapeutic conization were investigated. We found that age and surgical margin status were independent prognostic factors for recurrence, and that age and a shorter interval from childbirth were independent factors for predicting conization-associated cervical stenosis.
The overall rate of relapse after conization in the present study was 4.8%, which was similar to that of previous studies [ , ]. Although a positive surgical margin is a well-known predictor for recurrent or residual diseases after conization, other risk factors have recently been discussed as well [ , , ]. Persistent high-risk HPV infection after conization is associated with recurrent HSIL [ , ]. A retrospective study of 4335 patients with HSIL who underwent a loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) also reported that age is a strong independent predictor of persistent or recurrent diseases, especially in patients with surgical margin involvement [ ]. Although many clinicians do not regard incomplete excision itself as an indication to alter subsequent management [ ], cases with multiple risk factors for recurrent/persistent diseases may require further treatment.
The frequency of cervical stenosis after conization depends on the methods used to perform the procedure. In addition, the definition of cervical stenosis is not consistent in the previous literature. Some authors defined stenosis as a cervical narrowing that prevented insertion of a cotton swab [ ] or a Hegar dilator [ , ], and others considered stenosis as being only those cases with hematometra and secondary amenorrhea that needed to be addressed in a hospital [ ]. Therefore, the true incidence of such conditions is unclear. According to the literature, the incidence of severe cervical stenosis or complete occlusion requiring surgical intervention was reported to be less than 1% [ , ]. In the current study, severe cervical stenosis requiring an additional surgical procedure occurred in 0.8% (4 of 522), which is consistent with the previous literature. As described in previous reports [ ], cone depth is also associated with postoperative cervical stenosis. In contrast to the younger patients, SCJ of the elder patient is usually located in the endocervix. Deep conization is thus required to excise the precancerous lesion for these patients, which may lead to cervical stenosis.
In our experiences, increasing age (≥46 years) and an interval of 12 months or less after childbirth were both independent risk factors for predicting cervical stenosis. These conditions are associated with amenorrhea or decreased frequency of menstruation. Lack of natural dilatation of the cervical canal by menstrual blood may be the main reason behind this complication. According to a previous study by Penna et al. [ ] regarding laser conization, postmenopausal status was an independent predictor of cervical stenosis. The authors found that hormonal replacement therapy was associated with a lower incidence of cervical stenosis. Another report, by Koyama et al. [ ], described a case of complete cervical obstruction caused by conization during the breastfeeding period and a subsequent reconstructive surgery to open the cervical canal. They suggested that mechanical cervical dilatation for 1 month after the reconstructive surgery, using a synthetic osmotic dilator, was useful for preventing future reobstruction of the cervix. The utility of inserting an intrauterine device to prevent cervical stenosis has also been reported [ ]. Otherwise, there have been limited reports regarding preventive methods for cervical stenosis, and an optimal strategy to avoid such a complication has not yet been established.
We found that women aged 46 years or older were not only at higher risk of recurrence but also for cervical stenosis, which may lead to unsatisfactory follow-up. All older patients with HSIL should be informed about their risk for a postsurgical stenosis that could exclude adequate follow-up. As shown in Fig. 3 , the disease recurrence rate among elderly patients with surgical margin involvement was extremely high. Therefore, when a surgical margin involvement is confirmed in elderly patients, offering subsequent hysterectomy is beneficial to those patients.
In conclusion, we found that elderly patients with surgical margin involvement demonstrated a higher incidence of recurrence and postoperative cervical stenosis after therapeutic conization. Follow-up with screening cytology or biopsy may be considered in younger patients, whereas a secondary hysterectomy should be considered in older patients. Furthermore, clinicians should recognize the possibility of cervical stenosis after conization during the breastfeeding period, which may lead to secondary infertility or hematometra.
