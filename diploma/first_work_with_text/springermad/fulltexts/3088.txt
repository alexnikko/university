Introduction
Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome is characterized with inheritance of breast and ovarian cancer genetic mutations, most common being BRCA1 and BRCA2. Lifetime risk of breast cancer in women with HBOC is 50–85%, and risk of breast cancer in women above 50 years is 30–50%. Risk of ovarian cancer in women with inheritance of BRCA1 mutation is 25–30%, and that of BRCA2 mutation is 15–30% [ , ]. The likelihood of harbouring a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation is dependent on one’s personal and family history.
As per the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines (NCCN 2014) for the management of individuals at risk of HBOC [ ], breast self-examination, clinical breast examination, annual mammogram and breast MRI screening have been individualized based on the earliest age of breast cancer in the family. Ovarian cancer screening is not recommended in general population, but all cases of ovarian cancer should be counselled for genetic testing. Risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) or oral contraceptives are effective for prevention of ovarian cancer in BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation carriers. Oral contraceptives also have protective effect against ovarian cancer in women with BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations. Many more indications for genetic testing are mentioned in the NCCN guidelines that need a detailed family history and pedigree analysis.
There is a lack of awareness about HBOC genetic testing among both medical and non-medical personnel in India. Risk assessment, genetic testing and counselling are not routinely practiced in all clinical settings due to financial constraints too. This study was therefore planned to identify patients eligible for genetic testing and for counselling them so that their family members could benefit with the available preventive strategies.
Subjects and Methods
This prospective cohort study was conducted in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology and Department of Surgical Oncology of King George’s Medical University over a duration of 1 year. The study was approved by the Institutional Ethical Committee.
Inclusion Criteria
All patients with breast and/or ovarian cancer in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology or Department of Surgical Oncology were included.
Exclusion Criteria
Patients with non-epithelial ovarian cancer and those not willing for participation were excluded.
Methods
A total of 100 cases were recruited including 66 cases of epithelial ovarian cancer and 34 cases of breast cancer. Written informed consent was taken from all cases recruited.
A meeting was planned with the patient and her immediate family members as per their convenience. The meeting was conducted by the consultant in-charge managing the patient and the study investigator. Detailed family history was taken, and pedigree chart was prepared up to second-degree relatives.
Cases were identified for genetic testing according to NCCN guidelines version 4.2013 for breast/ovarian cancer genetic assessment as detailed below.
An affected individual with one or more of the following: An individual from family with known deleterious BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation. Personal history of breast cancer with one or more of the following: (a) Diagnosed at < 45 years. (b) Diagnosed at < 50 years with. An additional primary cancer. > 1 close blood relative with breast cancer at any age. An unknown or limited family history. (c) Diagnosed at < 60 years with a triple negative breast cancer. (d) Diagnosed at any age with. ≥ 1 close blood relative with breast cancer < 50 years. 2 close blood relative with breast cancer at any age. 1 close blood relative with epithelial ovarian cancer. 2 close blood relative with pancreatic cancer and/or prostatic cancer at any age. A close male relative with breast cancer. For an individual of ethnicity associated with higher mutation frequency associated with higher mutation frequency (e.g. Ashkenazi Jewish), no additional family history is required. Personal history of epithelial ovarian cancer. Personal history of male breast cancer. Personal history of pancreatic cancer or prostate cancer at any age with 2 close blood relative with breast and/or ovarian cancer. Family history only. (A significant limitation of interpreting test result for an unaffected individual should be discussed.) (a) First- and second-degree blood relative meeting any of the above criteria. (b) Third-degree blood relative with breast cancer and/or ovarian cancer with > 2 close blood relative with breast cancer. (c) Clinical judgment should be used to determine whether the patient has reasonable likelihood of mutation, considering unaffected patient’s current age and age of female unaffected relatives. (d) Testing of unaffected individuals should only be considered when an appropriate affected family member is unavailable for testing.
Second meeting was held with patients filling any one of the above criteria. Counselling was done about genetic testing of index cases. Written and verbal information about HBOC was given. Patients were allowed time to further think over.
Third meeting was held to record acceptance for genetic testing along with reasons for refusal among those refusing the genetic testing.
Outcome Measures of Study
(a) Incidence of cases needing genetic testing among patients of breast and ovarian cancer. (b) Acceptance rate for genetic testing. (c) Factors affecting acceptance of genetic testing and primary prevention.
Results
Out of 66 ovarian cancer cases, 43 cases were recruited from Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology and 23 cases were recruited from department of Surgical Oncology. All cases of breast cancer were recruited from Department of Surgical Oncology.
Table 1 shows the demographic profile of patients of breast and ovarian cancer recruited in the study. Peak incidence of ovarian cancer was found in 40–50 years, while breast cancer cases were almost equally distributed from 30 to 60 years of age. There were an almost equal proportion of premenopausal and postmenopausal cases of both cancers. Higher proportion of women were Hindus and came from rural areas. Most of the cases were multiparous and belonged to lower socioeconomic strata. Most had attained only school education.

Table 2 shows distribution of cases found suitable for genetic testing according to NCCN 2013 guidelines. All 66 cases of ovarian cancer were included due to personal history of epithelial ovarian cancer (criteria 3). Twenty-two cases of breast cancer were included due to age below 45 years (criteria 2a). Four of these 22 cases had family history of breast cancer on pedigree analysis. Thus, a total of 88 patients were designated as high risk of HBOC. All patients and their available family members were informed about this risk and counselled for genetic testing of the index cases.

Tables 3 and 4 show distribution and details of cases with the family history of breast or ovarian cancer. The pedigree analysis of these 6 cases showed that 12 unaffected relatives of ovarian cancer cases and 28 unaffected relatives of breast cancer cases could be the candidates for genetic testing due to their close relation with the affected women of study group.

Acceptance for Genetic Testing
Majority of our patients irrespective of type of cancer were not willing to undergo genetic testing. Only 11 (16.66%) cases of epithelial cancer and 6 cases (27.27%) of breast cancer were willing for genetic testing. There was no statistically significant difference in acceptance for genetic testing among the two groups ( p = 0.629).
Reasons for Refusal for Genetic Testing
The most common (80.68%) reason for refusal of genetic testing was high cost of the BRCA testing. The other reasons were: The caretakers were more concerned about the affected patients’ illness. They were not well convinced with the concept of investigation or treatment before appearance of symptoms of the disease. None of them had prior knowledge of HBOC, and they came to know about it for the first time during the study. Non-availability of decision makers of the family.
Table 5 shows association of demographic factors with acceptance for genetic testing. Socioeconomic status was found to have statistically significant correlation ( p < 0.001 and p = 0.030) with acceptance for genetic testing.

Discussion
Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) is an interesting group of diseases due to the availability of highly effective screening tools and preventive strategies. Though BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic mutations are the most common association, CHDH1, PTEN and p53 tumour suppressor gene may also be involved. HBOC follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern.
Murthy et al. [ ] found the peak incidence of ovarian cancer between 55 and 64 years. Our study showed the peak incidence in a younger age group of 40–50 years. Despite the peak in middle-aged women, 22.72% of cases were below 40 years of age. This is a serious issue and indicates either racial differences or changing profile of ovarian cancer in India. The decline in incidence of epithelial ovarian cancers after 60 years may be due to lower life expectancy in India. Anderson et al. [ ] found an increase in incidence of breast cancer after the age of 30 years. Hospital-based cancer registries (1994–1998, ICMR) found peak incidence in 40–44 years of age [ ]. Our study showed an increased incidence after 30 years of age, but it was equally distributed among women aged 30–60 years. These findings show an early onset of breast cancer without a clear age of peak incidence. Yet this is a significant finding because the risk of HBOC is certainly higher in women aged below 45 years.
Low parity and infertility are generally considered as risk factors for ovarian cancer. Negri et al. [ ] and Yen et al. [ ] found “reducing parity” as the most strongly associated risk factor. 86.36% cases of epithelial ovarian cancer were multiparous women in our study. Though it is a small sample size, the proportion is significantly higher than nulliparous women. Scully et al. [ ] and Berek [ ] found that 30% of ovarian neoplasm in postmenopausal women was malignant compared to only 7% in premenopausal women. American Society of Clinical Oncology [ ] stated that menopause after 55 years increases the risk of ovarian, breast and uterine cancer. Bodicoat et al. [ ] found that early age at menarche and late menopause increased the risk of breast cancer significantly. The present study found an almost equal proportion of premenopausal and postmenopausal cases of epithelial ovarian cancer.
Szpurek et al. [ ] found that there were no differences in advancement of ovarian cancer at the moment of diagnosis or in tumour type and size between women residing in large cities, small towns and rural areas. Our study also did not find any difference in prevalence of ovarian and breast cancer by rural or urban background of the patient. Parazinni et al. [ ] found that epithelial ovarian cancer is a disease of higher education status. In contrast, higher proportion of cases in our study belonged to lower socioeconomic and educational status. Recent studies have also shown an increase in breast cancer in low socioeconomic group.
Analysis of all demographic factors shows some major shifts in the profile of Indian women, particularly the increasing incidence in younger age, high parity and lower socioeconomic and educational status.
Antoniou et al. [ ] and Chen et al. [ ] showed that 1.3% women have lifetime risk of developing ovarian cancer which is increased to 39% with BRCA1 mutation and 11–17% with BRCA2 mutation. Howlader [ ] found 12% lifetime risk of breast cancer that increased to 55–65% with BRCA1 mutation and 45% with BRCA2 mutation.
Gao et al. [ ] showed increased risk of hereditary association before 45 years of age. The risk of second primary cancer in contralateral breast is also increased in early onset of breast cancer. Craqum et al. [ ] found that young black women below 50 years more commonly had hereditary disease (OR 2.0) and hence were counselled for genetic testing. In the present study too, 64.7% of breast cancer cases were categorized as high risk of HBOC due to age below 45 years. Saam et al. [ ] found that patients with two primary cancers are at increased risk of HBOC. 22.4% of women with both breast and ovarian cancer had either BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. Among women with both ovarian and colorectal cancer, 28.1% had a mutation associated with lynch syndrome [ ]. Easton et al. [ ] found that the pedigree is consistent with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance if more than two first-degree relatives are affected with breast cancer. In the present study, four cases of breast cancer had one more family member with breast cancer. All these cases were below 45 years too. BRCA assessment is most suitable for these patients but could not be done due to financial constraints. The family members of these patients can be informed about the high probability of genetic mutations in such cases, and they can at least be offered close monitoring with self and clinical breast examination in low-resource settings.
The demographic and clinical characteristics of the six patients with positive family history (Table 4 ) show that all these women were below 50 years of age, were multiparous (one unmarried), had primary education and belonged to rural and low/middle socioeconomic background. The family member had a breast tumour in all cases. All of them had advanced disease at diagnosis and were treated by multimodality treatment. These features were not significantly different from all other cases studied.
According to Breast Cancer Network Australia (2012), 15% of breast cancer cases are triple (oestrogen, progesterone and HER receptor) negative. They respond well to chemotherapy and have lower recurrence rates. Lundy et al. [ ] confirmed the importance of pedigree analysis for determining high-risk cases for HBOC. The testing of affected individual is the best approach to detect BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation in diagnosis of HBOC [ ].
Nakagomi et al. [ ] studied 670 patients for genetic analysis who were at risk of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome. 86% patients agreed to genetic testing. They realized that available preventive measures and/or counselling system may not be sufficient enough to convince the high-risk group to receive genetic testing [ ]. The acceptance rate for genetic testing was quite low in the present study too. On studying the factors affecting acceptance rates, families with younger patients (20–40 years) were more receptive. This may be due to greater concern about younger family members. Our results are in concordance with Hughes et al. and Thompson et al. [ ]. In contrast, Kinney et al. [ ] found that women above 39 years have more acceptance for genetic testing ( p = 0.02). The acceptance rate was higher in families residing in urban region. Yoon et al. [ ] also found that only 78% of the index patients informed their families of their risks and 11% of relatives came forward when offered free counselling and testing. Even when genetic counselling and testing are provided at free of cost, there remained significant societal and regulatory barriers to effective cancer genetic testing in Asian population [ ].
Joseph et al. [ ] found that pre-counselling education for low literacy women at high risk of HBOC by cancer risk education intervention tool (CREDIT) improves the acceptance for genetic counselling and testing. The acceptance rate was significantly higher among patients with high socioeconomic status. This is well understood considering the cost of genetic testing in our country. Moreover, this is an extra burden to the family who is coping with the treatment expenses with difficulty. Our results are in concordance with study by Lerman et al. [ ] which found that rate of testing is higher in patients belonging to higher socioeconomic status, those with health insurance (OR 3.74), knowledge of BRCA testing (OR 1.45) and more first degree affected (OR 1.59). Kieran et al. [ ] found that many women did not accept BRCA genetic testing due to financial reasons.
Domchek et al. [ ] studied the association of risk-reducing surgery in BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers with cancer risk and mortality. They found a significant reduction in the development of cancer with this intervention [ , ]. Two large multicenter case–control studies have reported risk reductions of 33% and 38%, with the maximum observed protection after 5 years of use of oral contraceptives in young women as an option against risk-reducing surgery. Kriege et al. [ ] evaluated the role of breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) screening in women with BRCA1/2 mutations. American Cancer Society also recommends the use of annual MRI screening for women at hereditary risk of breast cancer [ ]. Since none of our cases got tested for BRCA mutations, preventive options could not be offered to their family members.
BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic testing has recently become available in our country, but the cost is very high. Overall low acceptance was mainly due to high cost of the genetic test and primary concern for the treatment of the affected patient. There is lack of awareness among our patients, particularly those visiting government set-up who are less educated and belong to lower socioeconomic group. The present study has helped in increasing awareness about risk of HBOC among our patients and hospital staff.
Conclusion
Demographic factors like age, parity and socioeconomic status show a changing profile in this study. Genetic testing for HBOC is applicable to a large number of ovarian and breast cancer cases but not feasible due to the lack of awareness and financial constraints in our set-up.
