Introduction
Cervical esophageal cancer (CEC) is a relatively rare cancer accounting for 5.3% of all esophageal cancer cases in Japan [ ]. The vast majority of CECs are squamous cell carcinomas [ ]. The radical treatments for CEC are radiotherapy (RT) and surgery. CEC was historically managed using surgery, and whether such surgery should include laryngectomy depends on the extent of the disease [ ]. Mendenhall et al. reported that surgery and RT yielded similar 5-year overall survival (OS) rates of 12–27 and 15–32%, respectively [ ]. Because of this finding and the potential loss of the larynx during surgery, concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) is the current standard treatment modality recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) for CEC [ , ].
Chemoselection is a treatment approach that promotes laryngeal preservation in laryngeal cancer cases [ ]. In cases of head and neck cancer, several studies have demonstrated that response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is correlated with freedom from treatment failure [ ]. In chemoselection, surgery is performed on poor responders to NAC, and RT is performed on good responders to NAC. Some prospective studies have evaluated the efficacy of chemoselection in laryngeal cancer cases and have reported that it is associated with favorable laryngeal preservation and survival rates [ , ].
We have performed chemoselection for CEC; however, to our knowledge, there have been no reports concerning chemoselection for CEC. Therefore, in the study reported here, we compared the laryngeal preservation and survival rates for chemoselection with those for CCRT.
Patients and methods
Patient population
This was a retrospective cohort study of CEC patients treated using chemoselection or CCRT at Aichi Cancer Center Hospital between January 2000 and March 2013. A total of 42 patients met the following inclusion criteria: (1) carcinoma of the cervical esophagus; (2) histological diagnosis of primary cervical esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; (3) definitive therapy for primary cervical esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; (4) the CEC was not inoperable [considering extensive tracheal resection or carotid artery resection, respiratory dysfunction, or low performance status (World Health Organization 3–4)]; (5) no distant organ metastasis; (6) no previous cervical and thoracic RT or surgery; and (7) patients underwent chemoselection or primary RT as the definitive therapy. We excluded patients who received primary surgery as the definitive therapy. This study was approved by the ethics committee of Aichi Cancer Center Hospital.
Pretreatment staging
The pretreatment staging evaluation included physical examination, laryngoscopy, gastrointestinal endoscopy, esophagography, laboratory tests, and computed tomography (CT). Positron emission tomography scans were performed if the clinician considered it necessary to check for distant metastasis. In this study, pretreatment involved restaging by one head-and-neck surgeon and radiologist according to the Japanese Classification of Esophageal Cancer version 11 [ ].
Treatment policy
In our department, the basic treatment for CEC is either primary surgery or chemoselection. Chemoselection is recommended for patients who require maximal organ preservation without a reduction in treatment efficacy. However, we recommend primary RT for patients who request primary RT or for whom primary RT is considered a better option than primary surgery or chemoselection.
Chemoselection
In the chemoselection group, patients underwent NAC. Patients who responded to NAC underwent RT or CCRT unless they requested to undergo surgery. Patients who did not respond to NAC underwent surgery unless they requested RT or CCRT. We administered a weekly cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (CF) regimen or a triweekly CF regimen as the NAC, depending on the physician’s choice. The weekly CF regimen, which was administered to two patients, consisted of intravenous cisplatin (25 mg/m 2 ) for 1 day and continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (1000 mg/m 2 ) for 2 days, given 3–5 times. The CF regimen, which was given to 29 patients, consisted of intravenous cisplatin (80 mg/m 2 ) for 1 day and continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (600–800 mg/m 2 ) for 5 days, given 1–3 times every 3 weeks. One patient was performed once the CF regimen and three times the weekly CF regimen. Responders were defined as achieving a >30% decrease in the endoscopic or CT-determined major primary tumor axis.
Surgery
Patients selected for surgery as a result of chemoselection underwent cervical or total esophagectomy with or without laryngopharyngectomy. The regional lymph nodes located at 101, 102-mid, 102-up, 104, and part of 106 (Japanese Classification of Esophageal Cancer version 11 [ ]) that could be dissected in a cervical approach were routinely dissected. If mediastinal or intraperitoneal lymph node metastasis was suspected during pretreatment assessment, we undertook metastatic mediastinal or intraperitoneal lymph node dissection.
Salvage surgery
In general, we performed salvage surgery for patients who suffered locoregional recurrence unless the patient was inoperable or did not want to undergo salvage surgery. The procedure used and the regions containing the lymph nodes dissected were the same as for primary surgery.
RT planning
RT was delivered using a linear accelerator with a photon beam. Patients received 1.8 or 2 Gy per fraction to a total dose of 60–66 Gy. Regarding 3D conformal RT, a conventional beam arrangement was used that consisted of opposed anterior and posterior fields at doses of 36–40 Gy and off-cord oblique fields. After 2006, two patients in the primary RT group and eight patients in the chemoselection group received intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) using helical tomotherapy. A dose of 60 Gy was delivered over 6 weeks to the primary and nodal lesions, while 48 Gy was delivered to the prophylactic region using the simultaneous integrated boost technique.
The gross tumor volume of the primary site (GTV-P) and the gross tumor volume of the involved lymph nodes were determined using laryngoscopy, gastrointestinal endoscopy, esophageal angiography, CT, and magnetic resonance imaging. The clinical target volume of the primary site (CTV-P) was defined as the GTV plus craniocaudal margin, a 20–30 mm margin used to account for microscopic disease, and the lymph node clinical target volume (CTV-N), which included the GTV-N plus a 5-mm additional margin. The planning target volume (PTV) was defined as the CTV-P and CTV-N plus 5-mm margins in every direction. The prophylactic CTV was designed to include the cervical and supraclavicular lymph nodes (101, 102-mid, 102-up, 103, 104, 105, 106-rec, 106-pre, 106-tb, and 107: Japanese Classification of Esophageal Cancer version 11 [ ]).
Chemoradiotherapy
The chemotherapy regimens were CF, nedaplatin, and 5-fluorouracil (NF), weekly cisplatin, triweekly cisplatin, weekly docetaxel, and weekly carboplatin. The CF regimen consisted of intravenous cisplatin (80 mg/m 2 ) for 1 day and continuous infusion of 5-FU (700–800 mg/m 2 ) for 4 days, given 2–3 times every 4 weeks. The NF regimen consisted of intravenous nedaplatin (130 mg/m 2 ) for 1 day and continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (700 mg/m 2 ) for 5 days, given 2 times every 5 weeks. The weekly cisplatin regimen consisted of intravenous cisplatin (25–30 mg/m 2 ) for 1 day given 1–6 times every week. The triweekly cisplatin regimen consisted of intravenous cisplatin (80 mg/m 2 ) for 1 day given once every 3 weeks. The weekly docetaxel regimen consisted of intravenous docetaxel (12 mg/m 2 ) given five times every week. The weekly carboplatin regimen consisted of intravenous carboplatin (dosed according to the area under the dose–time concentration curve × 1.5) given four times every week. We treated CEC according to the standard treatments for head and neck cancer. Therefore, triweekly cisplatin and the weekly cisplatin, which are representative chemoradiotherapy regimens for head and neck cancer, were performed in many patients.
In the primary RT group, the CF regimen was performed in four patients; the weekly cisplatin regimen was performed in four patients; and the weekly docetaxel and triweekly cisplatin regimens were performed in one patient each. The reason for performing the weekly docetaxel regimen was heart failure.
In the chemoselection group, RT and CCRT were performed in five and 14 patients, respectively. Of those 14 patients, the weekly cisplatin regimen was performed in ten patients; the CF regimen was performed in two patients; and the triweekly carboplatin and the NF regimens were performed in one patient each. The reason for performing the weekly docetaxel regimen was low renal function with NAC. The NF regimen was performed after NAC.
Follow-up
History and physical examination, complete blood cell count, laryngoscopy, gastrointestinal endoscopy, and CT scanning of the neck, chest, and abdomen were performed approximately every 3–6 months after the initiation of treatment until death or loss to follow-up.
Data collection
The following information was recorded from the medical records and radiologic images of each patient: treatment initiation date; age; gender; World Health Organization performance status; cancer site; clinical stage according to the Japanese Classification of Esophageal Cancer version 11 [ ]; Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) [ ]; smoking history; alcohol history; and final date of survival assessment.
Statistical analysis
All patient characteristics were considered to be categorical variables. Specific comparisons between groups were made using the chi-squared test. The OS was calculated from the treatment initiation date to the time of death from any cause or to the censored time. The laryngeal preservation rate (LPR) was determined from the treatment initiation date to the documented date of loss of larynx or to the censored time. The locoregional control rate was calculated as the percentage of the patients (excluding recurrence-free patients) with locoregional control within the determined time. We defined locoregional control as no recurrence in the locoregional area or nonresidual disease. All analyses used the intention-to-treat approach to minimize bias and to compare the effects of therapeutic strategies. OS and LPR analyses were performed using the Kaplan–Meier method comparing survival curves with the log-rank test or using Cox proportional hazards models. Variables associated with the OS that had a P value <0.1 were included in the multivariate analysis. Univariate logistic regression analysis was performed to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and to identify independent risk factors for locoregional control. Multivariate analysis focusing on locoregional control could not be performed because the number of patients was not high enough. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 22.0 (IBM Japan, Tokyo, Japan) and R version 3.0.2 (R Project for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). A P value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.

NAC neoadjuvant chemotherapy
In the chemoselection group, 32 patients received chemotherapy as NAC. Of these 32 patients, 24 were assessed as responders and eight were assessed as nonresponders. Among the responders, six patients requested and underwent surgery whereas the other 18 patients received RT. Among the nonresponders, seven patients underwent surgery and one patient received RT as they refused surgery.
In the primary RT group, seven requested and received RT, while one received RT due to heart failure, another received RT due to dilated cardiomyopathy, and another received RT due to double oropharyngeal carcinoma.
Treatment outcomes
Overall survival
The median follow-up time was 26 (range 4–122) months. When all patients were considered, a statistically significant difference in OS was observed between the chemoselection and primary RT groups. The 2-year OS rates for the chemoselection and primary RT groups were 65.1 and 40%, respectively (HR 2.870; 95% CI 1.206–6.830; P = 0.017). The OS curve for each group is presented in Fig. 2 a.

The results of the univariate and multivariate analyses are detailed in Table 2 . Treatment strategy was found to have significantly influenced the OS in univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis indicated that treatment strategy independently influenced the OS. Because there were insufficient patients in the study, multivariate analysis of factors such as age, CCI, and cStage could not be performed. We did, however, carry out multivariate analyses that included treatment strategy and each of age, PS, CCI, smoking, alcohol, serum albumin, primary site, cTstage, cNstage, and cStage. In each of these multivariate analyses, treatment strategy was found to have significantly influenced the OS.

Locoregional control
When all the patients were considered, a significant difference in the 2-year locoregional control rate was observed between the chemoselection and primary RT groups. The 2-year locoregional control rates for the chemoselection and primary RT groups were 68.0 and 25.0%, respectively (OR 6.375; 95% CI 1.018–87.80; P = 0.048). The results of the univariate analysis are detailed in Table 3 . Because there were not enough patients, multivariate analysis could not be performed.

Among all the patients, 27 had residual disease or post-treatment progression. Of those 27 patients, four had residual disease after primary treatment, nine experienced locoregional relapse, eight experienced distant relapse, and six experienced locoregional and distant relapse. Of the four patients who had residual disease, one received chemoselection–RT and three received primary RT (Table 4 ).

Laryngeal preservation
When all patients were considered, there was no significant difference in LPR between the chemoselection and primary RT groups. The 2-year LPRs for the chemoselection and primary RT groups were 57.3 and 83.3%, respectively (HR 0.202; 95% CI 0.026–1.536; P = 0.122). The LPR curve for each group is presented in Fig. 2 b.

Discussion
Several studies of head and neck cancer have demonstrated that response to NAC is correlated with freedom from treatment failure [ ]. In chemoselection, surgery is performed for poor responders to NAC, i.e., the patients who are expected to have a high possibility of treatment failure. Thus, we consider that chemoselection can achieve lower treatment failure rates and improve survival. However, because chemoselection entails the possibility of surgery, the laryngeal preservation rate is lower than that of CCRT or RT. We consider that CEC treatment should aim for laryngeal preservation and to optimize locoregional control, and that chemoselection for CEC can achieve these objectives.
In the present study, the 2-year locoregional control, OS, and LRC rates for the chemoselection group versus the primary RT group were 68.0, 65.1, and 57.3%, respectively, versus 25.0, 40.0, and 83.3%, respectively; in addition, the OS survival curves for the two groups differed significantly. Therefore, we consider that chemoselection for CEC can promote favorable survival results and locoregional control and yield a tolerable laryngeal preservation rate. However, it is important to note that selection bias and the rate of salvage surgery influenced our results.
Stusckhke et al. reported that the 2-year locoregional control (LRC) and OS rates of 17 patients treated with RT or CCRT were 33 and 24%, respectively [ ]. Cao et al. reported that the 2-year LRC and OS rates of 171 patients treated with RT or CCRT were 69.9 and 51%, respectively [ ]. In the present study, the results for the primary RT group were inferior to those noted in Cao’s report. Because some patients received primary RT for comorbid diseases, patients with a potentially poor prognosis were assigned to primary RT by their physicians. Therefore, we feel that these results are influenced by selection bias.
Schieman et al. reported that relatively long-term survival could only be achieved in patients with local recurrence by treating them with salvage surgery [ ]. In the current study, the proportion of patients who underwent salvage surgery differed between the chemoselection group and the primary RT group. Eight (25.0%) of the 32 patients in the chemoselection group underwent salvage surgery, whereas one (10.0%) of the 10 patients in the primary RT group underwent salvage surgery. We believe that the difference in the rate of salvage surgery between the groups influenced the results obtained in this study.
When applying chemoselection, we consider that the laryngeal preservation rate is an important component of the survival results. The Veterans Affairs Laryngeal Cancer Study (VA study) demonstrated the efficacy of chemoselection at preserving the larynx in cases of locally advanced laryngeal cancer [ ]. In the chemoselection group in the VA study, based on the response to two courses of chemotherapy, the physician selected RT alone or concomitant laryngectomy. As a result, the 2-year OS and LPR were 68 and 66%, respectively, in the chemoselection group in that study, which are comparable with the OS and LPR values observed for the chemoselection group in the present study. Therefore, we feel that chemoselection for CEC could be a useful treatment strategy for laryngeal cancer.
While using RT as a larynx-preserving cancer therapy, Miyata et al. reported that larynx preservation limited cervical esophagus resection [ ]. They performed larynx-preserving esophagectomy or laryngoesophagectomy according to the efficacy of preoperative chemotherapy, preoperative CCRT, and preoperative RT. Those authors [ ] reported that 33 of 58 (56.8%) patients underwent larynx-preserving esophagectomy, and the 5-year OS was 57.8% in the larynx-preserving esophagectomy group and 25.8% in the laryngoesophagectomy group. Thus, the laryngeal preservation rate reported for that study was similar to that achieved in the present study. However, the definition of laryngeal preservation used by Miyata et al. [ ] considered whether or not larynx-preserving surgery had been performed at the time of the operation. That definition differs from our definition of LPR, which took into account laryngectomy after primary treatment.
The present study has several limitations. First, it was retrospective and involved a small number of patients. A second limitation was that the chemotherapy regimen applied and the number of chemotherapies that were performed for chemoselection varied. A third limitation was physician selection bias regarding the choice of chemoselection or primary RT for radical treatment. A fourth limitation was that the chemoselection group included patients who were treated surgically if requested by the patient.
In conclusion, we demonstrated the efficacy of chemoselection for CEC. The chemoselection group exhibited a better survival rate than the primary RT group and a tolerable LPR. Therefore, we consider that chemoselection is a suitable treatment strategy for CEC.
