Introduction
In a press release by IARC in December 2013, it was stated that with 528,000 new cases every year, cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer affecting women worldwide, after breast, colorectal and lung cancers [ ]. It is also the fourth most common cause of cancer death (266,000 deaths in 2012) in women worldwide. Almost 70% of the global burden falls in areas with lower levels of development, and more than one-fifth of all new cases are diagnosed in India [ ]. According to Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), cancer of the cervix is the third most common cancer with estimated 100,000 new cases in 2016 [ ]. Most of the cases of ca cervix (85%) present in advanced stages, and more than half (63–89%) have regional disease at the time of presentation [ ].
Concurrent chemo-radiation has been the standard of management for cervical cancer stage Ib-IVa following the publication of 5 randomized trials that demonstrated a survival advantage with the addition of cisplatin-based chemotherapy to Radiotherapy [RT] in the adjuvant and definitive setting. For patients treated with RT alone, the derogatory effect of treatment time prolongation is established. Current Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/Gynaecologic Oncology Group (RTOG/GOG) protocols on concurrent chemo-radiation for cervical cancer recommend that whole radiotherapy be completed within 56 days. Although this recommendation is based on outcomes for only RT, the impact of treatment time on tumour control and survival has not been adequately studied in the age of concurrent chemo-radiation and the optimal treatment time is yet to be defined.
Weekly cisplatin at 40 mg/m 2 has been the standard concurrent chemotherapy that has been evaluated and commonly prescribed. There has been few head-on comparisons of efficacy as well as toxicity between concurrent weekly cisplatin + RT and concurrent weekly paclitaxel + cisplatin in the cases of ca cervix.
In view of these facts, the present study was carried out on patients of cervical cancer registered in Department of Radiotherapy and Radiation Medicine, Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University (BHU), India, from June 2014 to May 2015, with the following objectives.
To evaluate the feasibility and outcome of completing the whole treatment in ≤ 4 weeks for patients receiving concurrent chemo-radiation. To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of weekly paclitaxel + cisplatin versus weekly cisplatin alone, as a part of concurrent chemo-radiation with shortened overall treatment duration.
Materials and Methods
Forty histopathologically proven, previously untreated patients of cervical cancer were taken up for this study, after approval from Departmental Research Committee as well as from Institutional Ethical Committee and following informed consent from patient.
All the patients underwent complete blood count, random blood sugar, renal function test (RFT), liver function tests (LFT), human immunodeficiency virus/hepatitis B virus/hepatitis C virus tests, X-ray chest-PA view, contrast-enhanced CT of abdomen and pelvis (Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine (DICOM) 4.4 was used to assess tumour volume); histopathology was confirmed after biopsies from four quadrants of growth. Staging of the disease was done according to the criteria laid down by International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging for cancer of the cervix uteri (2009).
Subject Selection
For inclusion in the study, patients were required to fulfil all of the following criteria: invasive cervical cancer histologically confirmed as squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, or adeno-squamous carcinoma, FIGO stage IB-IIIB, age-group > 18 and < 75 years, Eastern Co-operative Oncology Group performance status ≤ 2, haemoglobin (Hb) > 9 g/dl, total leucocyte count > 4500/mm 3 , platelet > 100,000/mm 3 , serum bilirubin ≤ 1.75 mg/dl, serum creatinine ≤ 1.35 mg/dl and creatinine clearance ≥ 40 ml/min.
Exclusion Criteria
A patient who met any of the following criteria was deemed ineligible for participation in the study: previous history of cancer or cancer of other site; already received chemotherapy or radiotherapy before being registered; candidates for curative resection or if immediate brachytherapy is feasible; post-operative cases; any serious medical condition that could jeopardise the safety of the patient and/or the efficacy and assessment for the study.
All the suitable patients fulfilling all above prerequisite criteria, after they gave consent were enrolled into study and control group using odd and even allocation. Patients were free to withdraw consent at anytime if they felt it to be appropriate.
Equal number of patients (20 each) were assigned in arm A as well as B. Patients in both the arms received concurrent chemo-radiation. In arm A, weekly cisplatin at 40 mg/m 2 prior to radiation. was given on day 1, 8, 15 and 22, respectively, whereas in arm B cisplatin 30 mg/m 2 + paclitaxel 50 mg/m 2 before radiation were given on the above-mentioned days of treatment. Radiotherapy technique, dose and schedule were same in both the arms as mentioned below.
External beam radiotherapy [EBRT] dose prescription to the whole pelvis was 4500 cGY in 20 fractions/5 fractions per week at the isocentre delivered via conventionally planned AP-PA or four-field box technique. 30 Gy to point A was delivered using caesium 137 source, tandem and ovoid applicators, via intracavitary radiotherapy (ICR) in a single setting, in between EBRT starting from day 13 onwards. Target was to complete the whole treatment within 28 days.
Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) was given when ANC fell below 1500 cells/mm 3 . If the haemoglobin level fell below the defined level (9 mg/dl), patients were transfused with appropriate number of blood units to restore the required level.
Based on physical examination, complete blood count, LFT, RFT patients were weekly assessed according to the Radiotherapy Oncology Group (RTOG) criteria for acute toxicities during treatment. Suitability for ICR application assessment was done at the end of second week and thereafter at weekly intervals. Follow-up was planned at monthly interval till 6 months, following which 3 monthly follow-up was advised. During follow-up, blood investigations and clinical assessment were done routinely coupled with, radiological and histopathological evaluation as required. Toxicity during follow-up was graded according to RTOG criteria for acute and late toxicities. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS software (version 21.0).
Results
Patient population was similarly distributed w.r.t. age, PS, stage, histology, tumour volume, pelvic lymphadenopathy and pre-treatment Hb. Though more patients in arm B had performance status 2 (10% in arm A vs 30% in arm B), the difference was not statistically significant (χ 2 = 1.879, p = 0.615). Most of the patients were of locally advanced stage (90%) in each arm. Patient and tumour characteristics are summarised in Table 1 .

Most of the patients in both arm (95%) completed the scheduled number (four) of chemotherapy cycles. Earliest ICR was performed on 13th day of treatment, 52nd day by latest. Mean day of ICR for cisplatin-only arm and cisplatin + paclitaxel arm was 23.45 days (standard deviation [SD] 8.67 days) and 21.3 days (SD 8.13 days), respectively. Difference is statistically not significant ( p = 0.84). Mean ICR day for all subjects was 22.38 days with standard deviation of 8.41 days. Distribution of ICR days is summarised in Table 2 .

Grade 3 acute toxicity (Table 3 ) across various systems varied between 10 and 15% amongst arms. Grade 4 toxicity wasn’t found in any of the patients. Grade 5 haematological toxicity was found in one patient (5%) of each arm. Overall treatment time varied between 26 and 52 days for the whole cohort. Mean and standard deviation of treatment duration for all the patients were 29.4 and 5.6 days. Treatment of 65% of cisplatin-only arm and 70% of cisplatin + paclitaxel arm patients could be completed by 28 days. By 30 days, 34 patients out of total 40 patients (80% of cisplatin only arm and 90% of cisplatin + paclitaxel arm) had completed the whole course of treatment. During the follow-up, apart from grade 1 late skin toxicity only late rectal toxicity (grade 1) was noticed in 2 patients (one patient of each arm).

The follow-up (FU) varied between 0 and 32 months across cohort. Three patients had expired before the first follow-up was due. As evaluated till last FU for each patient, 85% patients in each arm had complete loco-regional control. Residual disease was observed in a single patient (cisplatin-only arm), while distant metastasis without loco-regional evidence of disease was found in 2 patients (both of cisplatin + paclitaxel arm). Response and FU are summarised in Table 4 .

The mean overall survival (OS) for cisplatin-only arm, cisplatin + paclitaxel arm and overall was 25.85, 27.75 and 27.2 months, respectively. Median survival is yet to be reached by either arm or overall. Thirty-month survival rate (Fig. 1 ) is 72.2 and 69% for cisplatin-only and cisplatin + paclitaxel arm, respectively. Disease-free survival for the respective arms was 25.4, 27.4 and 26.7 months overall. None of the difference between the two arms is statistically significant ( χ 2 0.48, p 0.48).

Discussion
Despite the use of concurrent chemo-radiation (mainly cisplatin based), many patients continue to fail in the pelvis (20–25%) and at distant sites (22–27.5%) [ , ]. Analyses of concurrent chemo-radiation in ca cervix have suggested that longer treatment duration has been associated with increased local, distant failure as well as decreased progression-free and overall survival [ , , ]. The questions that were tried to be answered by this study were: (1) Is decreasing the overall treatment time (OTT) to ≤ 4 weeks feasible with acceptable increase in toxicity when ca cervix patients are treated with concurrent chemo-radiation; how will this decrease overall treatment time impact loco-regional/distant control; (2) whether combination of weekly cisplatin and paclitaxel produces better result than weekly cisplatin in the above setting.
In the current study, two changes were made in treatment protocol w.r.t. existing standard of treatment. Patients were randomized by allocating either to concurrent weekly paclitaxel [50 mg/m 2 ] + cisplatin [30 mg/m 2 ] (as arm B) or to weekly cisplatin [40 mg/m 2 ] (as arm A). In addition, the OTT was tried to be reduced by instituting a EBRT schedule [45 Gy/20#/5# per week] with an ICR application using LDR [30 Gy to point A in a single session] brachytherapy in between EBRT fractions. The EBRT and brachytherapy fractions and schedule were kept same for both groups.
In each arm, 95% patient received scheduled number (four) of chemotherapy cycles; all the patients completed EBRT and brachytherapy; and mean and standard deviation for treatment duration of all the patients were 29.4 and 5.6 days (range 26–52 days). Treatment of 65% of arm B (cisplatin + paclitaxel) and 70% of arm A (cisplatin) patients could be completed by 28 days. By 30 days, 34 patients out of total 40 patients (80% of arm B and 90% of arm A) had completed the whole course of treatment. Public holiday, absence of patient due to personal reason, accounted for treatment interruption in overall 65% patients, whereas toxicity and unsuitability for ICR interrupted treatment in 5% patients each (one patient in each arm). Cause was not available in rest of the interruptions. The patient in arm A who received ICR application very late (52nd day) had bulky disease (tumour volume of 143.5 cc, compared to overall mean tumour volume 37.7 cc), whereas the patient in arm B who received application on 46th day was the only patient with adenocarcinoma histopathology though the tumour volume was less than the mean volume. In both the patients, unsuitability for ICR application due to residual disease was reason for delay. The study was not designed to compare outcome on the basis of individual days to complete the treatment. Concurrent chemo-radiation studies from India have reported a complete response rate (CR) varying from 69 to 88% at first FU in which duration of treatment varied from 53 days to 10 weeks [ , , , ]. In this study, at first FU overall 90% CR was observed (3 patient’s unknown, 1 patient residual, 85% in arm A and 95% in arm B); till last FU, 85% local CR was maintained in each arm (one residual in arm A, 2 patients in arm B with distant metastasis without any evidence of local disease) during a FU of 32 months.
In systematic review of acute toxicity of concurrent chemo-radiation, Kirwan et al. [ ] reported grade 3/4 haematological toxicity and neutropenia to be 27.6 and 16.4%, respectively. Saibishkumar et al. [ ] reported 7%, and Jeyasheelan et al. [ ] (weekly cisplatin + paclitaxel) reported 20% grade 3 haematological toxicity. In the present study, 10% acute grade 3 toxicity was noted in each arm. Grade 3 neutropenia was noted in 12.5% patients overall. Grade 3/4 acute GI toxicity was 8% as noted by Kirwan et al.; it varied from 12 to 48% among studies from India [ , ]. In our study, upper and lower GI toxicities were 12.5 and 7.5% overall. No grade 3 and above skin/genitourinary toxicity were noted. However, grade 5 haematological toxicity was noted in one patient of each arm after completion of treatment before the first FU. Patient in arm A had grade 5 neutropenia, whereas patient in arm B had severe anaemia. In the first case, patient could not be resuscitated in spite of inpatient care, whereas the second patient didn’t come for hospital care despite repeated advice. Seven patients overall (17.5%) have expired, and 4 patients lost to FU till compilation of data. Overall, 70% patients were alive; mean OS was 26.9 months (95% CI 23.4–30.4 months, SE 1.8). Progression-free survival was 27.4, 24.9 and 26.5 months for arm A, B and overall, respectively. Difference between the two arms was statistically not significant for any toxicity, response or survival. This study was conducted with the help of telecobalt, and LDR brachytherapy lacks the volumetric information, tightening of dose around target and sparing of normal tissue achievable with conformal EBRT and image-guided brachytherapy.
Drawbacks
Small sample size and short FU duration prevented us from identifying any possible difference between the two arms. Odd–even allocations can at best be termed as a simple randomisation. Longer FU is needed to identify median survival and especially late toxicity.
Conclusion
Completing concurrent chemo-radiation and brachytherapy by 4 weeks is feasible with acceptable acute toxicity and encouraging outcome. Concurrent weekly cisplatin + paclitaxel do not improve loco-regional control or survival as compared to weekly cisplatin alone at the cost of similar toxicity. Large sample study and long FU are needed to establish the same and identify late toxicities. With the help of conformal EBRT and image-guided brachytherapy, shortening of overall treatment time can produce better result.
