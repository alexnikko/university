Introduction
In recent years, evidence which points to a role of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) in stroke has been growing. Darsalia et al. showed that the DPPIV inhibitor linagliptin counteracts stroke in the normal and diabetic mouse brain [ ]. This is supported by a meta-analysis that found a trend towards a lower stroke incidence in patients with type 2 diabetes using DPPIV inhibitors [ ]. The protective effect is not only attributable to an improved glycemic control alone but also to the prolonged half-life of neuroprotective DPPIV substrates [ , , ].
Several DPPIV substrates have been shown to be implicated in stroke. For example, stromal derived cell factor 1, neuropeptide Y, and B-type natriuretic peptide are correlated with stroke outcome and are proposed as biomarkers [ , ]. Interestingly, fibroblast activation protein (FAP), a DPPIV-related serine protease and member of the same prolyl oligopeptidase family, is able to inactivate several of these substrates [ ]. This is in agreement with Röhnert et al., who suggested that DPPIV and proteases with similar substrate specificity are potential therapeutic targets in cerebral ischemia [ ]. For more information on DPPIV and its substrates in ischemia, we refer to the review by Matheeussen et al. [ ].
In this study, we aimed to investigate if stroke severity, progression, and outcome were correlated with serum DPPIV and FAP activities and their kinetics shortly after stroke onset.
Materials and Methods
Study Population
This study is part of the Middelheim’s Interdisciplinary Stroke Study (ZNA Middelheim Hospital, Antwerp; 2005–2008). Patients with ischemic stroke underwent neuroimaging and were clinically, biochemically, neuropsychologically, and electrophysiologically evaluated. The subtype of the ischemic stroke was classified as described by the TOAST criteria (Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment) [ ]. The results of other biochemical analyses have been reported elsewhere [ , , , , ]. Serum samples from 50 patients, who did not receive thrombolytic treatment, were selected for analysis of DPPIV and FAP activities. Leftover samples from outpatients with C-reactive protein levels and glomerular filtration rates within normal ranges were used to create an age-matched control group of 50 samples. Patient and stroke characteristics can be found in Tables 1 and 2 , respectively. This study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Committees of ZNA Antwerp and the University of Antwerp.

Evaluation of Stroke Severity, Evolution, and Outcome
Trained stroke physicians determined neurological impairment according to the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) at admission, day 1, day 3, and day 7. Progressing stroke was evaluated as described by the European Progressing Stroke Study criteria [ ]. A brain MRI scan was performed to confirm the diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke. The infarct volume was assessed by two independent neurologists, as previously described [ , ]. After 3 months, stroke outcome was assessed with the modified Rankin scale, and severe disability was defined as an mRS score ≥4 [ ]. The mRS was obtained by trained and certified stroke physicians, in the majority of cases during face-to-face follow-up visits at the outpatient clinic. Assessment of the mRS via phone was performed if face-to-face was not possible. The individual distribution of the DPPIV and FAP activities for the different parameters of stroke severity, evolution, and outcome can be found in the supplemental data.
Blood Collection and DPPIV and FAP Activity Measurement
Venous blood samples were collected at admission, 1 day, 3 days, and 7 days after stroke onset, in serum tubes. After a centrifugation at 2000× g for 15 min at 4 °C, serum was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C.
The DPPIV activity was measured using Gly-Pro-pNA as described by Matheeussen et al. [ ]. FAP activity was measured using Z-Gly-Pro-AMC. Standards and samples were diluted in a 0.1 M Tris buffer (pH 8.0) containing 300 mM NaF, 1 mM NaN2, 1 mM EDTA, and 50 mM salicylic acid. Substrate was added and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped with 1.5 M acetic acid, and fluorescence was measured ( ʎ ex = 370 nm, ʎ em = 440 nm). In these assay conditions, all measured activity is attributable to FAP.
Statistical Analysis
All statistical tests were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 15. A one-way ANOVA or t test for independent samples was used to compare enzyme activities between groups, while a t test for paired samples was used for time-points within a group. Bonferroni post hoc analysis or correction was applied for multiple pairwise comparisons to prevent inflation of the type I error rate. Correlations between stroke severity, outcome or evolution, and changes in enzyme activity over 7 days after stroke onset (ΔDPPIV day7 and ΔFAP day7 ) were assessed with bivariate analysis. For continuous data such as infarct volume, a Pearson correlation was used after dichotomization, while ordinal data, for example stroke progression, was assessed with a Spearman rank correlation coefficient. Thresholds were prospectively selected as defined by Kehoe et al. [ ]. Multivariate analysis was performed by backward logistic regression analysis (using inclusion criterion of P < 0.010) to evaluate whether DPPIV and FAP activities were independently associated with infarct volume, stroke progression, the need for institutionalization at discharge, or long-term functional outcome (mRS score at 3 months). For this, a model including patient characteristics (age, gender), the interval between stroke onset and time of blood sampling, vascular risk factors (arterial hypertension, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, familial stroke, previous stroke, previous myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, smoking, and alcohol abuse), and the use of antidiabetic medication was constructed. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. All results are shown with the standard error of the mean.
Results
DPPIV and FAP Activity in Serum
DPPIV and FAP activities from the patient samples are shown in Fig. 1 . Compared to the controls, DPPIV showed a trend towards an increase immediately after stroke onset and decreased afterwards. FAP activities decreased significantly in the first week after admission. The lowest activities in patients were found at day 7. Fig. 1 Enzyme activities of the total study population and controls. a DPPIV activity at admission showed a trend towards higher levels compared to controls and tended to decrease afterwards. b FAP activity decreased steadily after stroke and reached statistical significance 7 days after stroke (* p < 0.05)
At admission, DPPIV and FAP activities were significantly correlated. This correlation was also seen for the kinetics of both enzymes over 7 days. On average, activities decreased by 11 % for DPPIV and 19 % for FAP. Enzyme activities of both enzymes at admission progressed independently from age, gender, or interval between stroke onset and time of blood sampling (Table 3 ).

Relation Between Patient Characteristics and Enzyme Activity
No relation was observed between the enzyme activities or their kinetics and risk factors associated with stroke (arterial hypertension, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, familial stroke, previous stroke, previous myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, smoking, or alcohol abuse), with the exception of DPPIV kinetics and dyslipidemia. Peripheral artery disease was correlated with DPPIV activities at admission (Table 3 ).
Both systolic and diastolic blood pressures, at presentation, were correlated with DPPIV and FAP activities at the same time and with their kinetics after 7 days. The same was true for HDL levels at admission. Glycemia at admission and after 7 days was correlated with the change in DPPIV activity over the same period. Inflammatory parameters were also correlated with the enzyme activities. FAP admission levels inversely related with CRP levels at admission and its kinetics with CRP levels after 7 days. All the data is summarized in Table 3 .
DPPIV and FAP Activity in Relation to Stroke Severity
DPPIV activities at admission were significantly higher in patients with higher infarct volumes (≥5 ml) and showed a trend towards a more pronounced decrease of DPPIV and FAP during the first week after stroke onset (Fig. 2 a, c). Logistic regression analysis confirmed DPPIV activity at admission as an independent predictor for infarct volume (Exp( β ) (95 % CI) = 1.134 (1.001–1.285), P = 0.048). Fig. 2 Enzyme activity kinetics and stroke severity. a Patients with large infarct volumes (≥5 ml) have significantly higher DPPIV activities at admission. b Its activity did not differ at any time-point between patients with high or low NIHSS scores (≤7). c FAP activity did not differ significantly between patients with large or small infarct volumes ( d ) or high or low NIHSS scores (* p < 0.05)
Patients were divided in two groups based on their NIHSS score. Mild stroke was defined as NIHSS ≤7 and more severe stroke as NIHSS >7. Patients with a more severe stroke at admission showed a more pronounced decrease in DPPIV activity during the first week after stroke (Fig. 2 b, d and Table 3 ).
DPPIV and FAP Activity in Relation to Short-Term Stroke Outcome and Evolution
Patients who developed progressive stroke, according to the EPSS criteria, had a more pronounced decrease in DPPIV and FAP activity than those with a more favorable outcome. In addition, changes in NIHSS during the first week were related with DPPIV levels at admission and the kinetics of both enzymes over 7 days (Fig. 3 a, c). Patients who were institutionalized after discharge had higher DPPIV and FAP activities at admission and a more pronounced decrease towards day 7 (Fig. 3 b, d). The decrease in DPPIV and FAP activities was confirmed to be independent predictors of stroke progression (Exp( β ) (95 % CI) = 1.326 (1.008–1.745), P = 0.044 and Exp( β ) (95 % CI) = 1.746 (1.144–1074.156), P = 0.042) by logistic regression analysis. The same model showed that DPPIV and FAP activity at admission were predictive for institutionalization at discharge (Exp( β ) (95 % CI) = 1.212 (1.039–1.412), P = 0.014 and Exp( β ) (95 % CI) = 1.746(1.144–1074.156), P = 0.042). Fig. 3 Enzyme activity kinetics and short-term outcome. a DPPIV activities were higher in patients with progressive stroke after 1 and 3 days. b Patients who were institutionalized after discharge had significantly higher DPPIV activities at admission. c FAP activities tended to be higher at admission, 1 day, and 3 days after stroke in patients who developed a progressive stroke. d FAP activities were significantly higher at admission in patients who had to be institutionalized after discharge (* p < 0.05)
DPPIV and FAP Activity in Relation to Long-Term Stroke Outcome
Long-term outcome was assessed with the mRS score after 3 months. Patients with a severe disability (mRS ≥ 4) had a more pronounced decrease in DPPIV and FAP activities during the first week after stroke onset (Fig. 4 ). However, after logistic regression, the decrease in DPPIV and FAP activities, during the first week, was shown not to be an independent predictor of long-term stroke outcome. Fig. 4 Enzyme activity kinetics and long-term outcome. No difference could be found in DPPIV ( a ) or FAP activity ( b ) between patients with a severe disability and no or mild disability at any of the time-points (* p < 0.05)
Result Validation
In order to validate the results, hematocrit was chosen as an internal standard. As erythrocytes have a long half-life, this can be considered as a stable parameter. No significant difference was observed in change in hematocrit after 7 days between most of the investigated subgroups. In the groups with a change in hematocrit, the DPPIV or FAP activities showed the reverse trend (i.e., inclined where hematocrit declined), excluding that differences between groups were influenced by factors such as changes in plasma volume.
Discussion
In recent years, there has been a growing interest in dipeptidyl peptidases in stroke. As most research focuses on the effects of inhibition or on the role of physiological substrates of DPPIV [ , , ], there exists a knowledge gap on DPPIV activity levels in stroke. While the involvement of DPPIV activity and related proteases has been reported in cerebral ischemia-induced inflammation in rats [ ], we are the first to report on the kinetics of DPPIV and FAP activity in patient serum in hyperacute stroke and the 7 days following stroke onset. While DPPIV activities only tended to increase shortly after stroke and decrease thereafter, FAP activities decreased significantly during the first week after stroke onset. Both enzymes reached their lowest levels at day 7.
The increase in soluble DPPIV shortly after stroke onset is in agreement with Röhrborn et al. who showed in vitro that DPPIV is shed during hypoxia [ ]. After admission, this hypoxic state is relieved and the activity lowers to baseline. Since we did not observe a significant increase in FAP activity, we have no indication for a similar mechanism for FAP. Interestingly, DPPIV shedding is also increased by inflammation [ ]. Consequently, small inflammatory molecules generated intracerebrally might cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and induce DPPIV activity systemically. Alternatively, intracerebral inflammation is known to increase the BBB permeability. As a consequence, cerebral DPPIV/FAP might also leak into the bloodstream [ ].
This hypothesis might help explain the beneficial effect of a pretreatment with DPPIV inhibitors in an animal model [ ]. This is most likely a class effect as both linagliptin and alogliptin show a beneficial effect [ , ]. As inhibitors prevent the sudden rise in DPPIV, the biological half-life of neuroprotective substrates such as glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is extended [ ]. Similar to DPPIV inhibitors, DPPIV and FAP are unable to cross the BBB. In contrast, several DPPIV and FAP substrates are able to cross the BBB [ , ]. The higher enzyme activities result in biological inactive substrates or even antagonists that might cross the BBB and abolish the neuroprotective effect of their intact counterparts [ ]. Nevertheless, the effect on hyperglycemia should not be forgotten, as hyperglycemia is associated with worse outcomes in stroke [ ].
The fact that we did not find a correlation between cardiovascular risk factors and enzyme activities, especially of DPPIV, is surprising. A recent meta-analysis found a reduction in all-cause mortality and major cardiovascular events during DPPIV inhibitor treatment [ ]. This might be explained by the fact that the meta-analysis only included patients with diabetes mellitus type 2.
We showed that both the systolic and the diastolic blood pressures increased with higher DPPIV and FAP activities. The role of DPPIV in blood pressure is controversial. While the majority of authors state that DPPIV inhibitors can lower blood pressure, others claim a rise [ , ]. However, the truth probably lies in between as Jackson et al. showed that the effect of DPPIV inhibitors is context dependent [ ]. We are the first to show a correlation of FAP levels with blood pressure. Nonetheless, the mechanism behind this remains unclear as its expression is tightly regulated [ ]. An explanation might be sought in the overlap with DPPIV concerning its cardiovascular-active substrates.
The correlation between glycemia and DPPIV kinetics is not very surprising, as its best known substrate, GLP-1, is involved in glucose homeostasis [ ]. The correlation of inflammation with FAP activity is equally unsurprising as it was shown earlier that its expression is induced during inflammation through TNFɑ [ ].
To conclude, this study describes the decrease in DPPIV and FAP activities during the first week after stroke onset and its correlation with stroke severity, progression, and outcome. These novel insights help us to better understand the biological significance of both enzymes in stroke and warrant further investigation of the use of DPPIV inhibitors in stroke in humans.
Limitations
The first limitation of this study is that the age-matched control population consisted of “apparently healthy” outpatients who came to the hospital for a check-up (C-reactive protein and glomerular filtration rate were within the normal range). A second limitation is the fact that it is impossible to exclude the effect of all confounding factors.
