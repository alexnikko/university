Introduction
Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases (MSMD) (OMIM20995) is a rare congenital syndrome. Patients with this condition suffer from infectious disease secondary to Mycobacterium bovis –Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination [ , ]. Although it is commonly identified in children, it has been also reported in young adults [ ]. The clinical manifestation of these patients is disseminated infections and loco-regional or recurrent infections by intracellular bacteria such as environmental mycobacteria (EM) and Salmonella . Patients also suffer from extra pulmonary infection by M. tuberculosis . As shown by de Beaucoudrey et al., one-fourth of patients can also develop chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis [ ]. Sporadic cases have been reported with rare infections caused by Listeria , varicella zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and herpes virus 8 [ , ]. To date, 23 genetic etiologies have been found in MSMD patients, 15 of which are autosomal recessive (AR), six autosomal dominant (AD), and two X-linked recessive (XR). These partial or complete defects are located on different genes including IFNGR1 , IFNGR2 , IL12RB1 , IL12RB2, IL23R, IL12B , ISG15 , STAT1 , TYK2 , IRF8 , CYBB , NEMO , and SPPL2A [ , , ]. Complete IL-12Rβ1 deficiency, due to bi-allelic mutations in the IL12RB1 gene, is the most common type of MSMD; it results in lack of expression or expression of non-functional IL-12Rβ1. Therefore, NK cells and activated T cells are unable to exert an appropriate immune response to intracellular pathogens in these patients [ ]. Infected macrophages of healthy individuals produce IL-12 and IL-23 which bind to their receptors on the surfaces of T and NK cells with high affinity and lead to the secretion of IFN-γ. In turn, ligation of IFN-γ to its receptors on macrophages results to the intracellular killing of the ingested bacteria [ ]. The pathogenesis of MSMD is mostly depended on either insufficient production or inadequate response to IFN-γ [ ]. The IFN-γ circuit (loop) triggers an immune response to intracellular microbes, and any kind of defects in this loop can lead to complicated infections in these patients [ ]. Besides BCG vaccination, these patients are susceptible to infection with other species of environmental mycobacteria [ , ]. The ability of immune cells to produce IL-12/23 and IFN-γ in an appropriate stimulating setting of whole blood cells is an inexpensive, available, and quick way for early screening of patients who are suspected to suffer from MSMD [ ].
In this study, we examined Iranian children with disseminated (BCG-osis) or loco-regional (BCG-itis) infection, following BCG vaccination or a history of previous intracellular infections. Based on the revised pediatric immunodeficiency classification, the phenotypes of BCG-induced disease were classified as BCG-itis with local and/or regional (loco-regional) patterns and BCG-osis with distant or disseminated patterns [ ]. To understand the abnormalities in cytokine loop pathways, we measured whole blood IFN-γ/IL-12 cytokine levels in all patients studied here.
Materials and Methods
Patients’ Characteristics
Patients who were suspected of MSMD and presented with complicated local or systemic reactions to BCG vaccination including unilateral/bilateral axillary or cervical lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly (identified by abdominal ultrasound evaluation), or a positive family history of BCG-itis/BCG-osis were entered into this study. They were referred to Immunology, Asthma and Allergy Research Institute (IAARI), at Tehran University of Medical Sciences, between 2012 and 2016. A questionnaire asking for demographic characteristics, history of disease onset and manifestations, parental consanguinity, previous admissions, and drug history was completed for each patient. Immunological evaluations for these patients included screening tests to assess humoral immunity (isohemagglutinin, three classes of immunoglobulins, and complements), phagocytic function, and cellular immunity (immunophenotyping and proliferation assay against phytohemagglutinin (PHA), BCG, and Candida ). The cases with normal immunological function, except BCG-treated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) proliferation (but normal response to PHA) in a lymphocyte transformation test (LTT) setting, were evaluated for IL-12 and IFN-γ secretions. Patients with impaired cytokine release were assumed to have MSMD (16 patients) and cases with other forms of primary immunodeficiencies (PID) were excluded from the research. Finally, a genetic analysis was performed for the MSMD patients to confirm the disease. This study was approved by ethics committee of Tehran University of Medical Sciences (code number: 412/p/171) and informed consent forms were signed by patients or their legal guardians.
Immunological Assessments
Patients were evaluated for immunological elements and responses including the ability to produce immunoglobulins (Igs), oxidation burst activity of neutrophils [nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) or dihydrorhodamine (DHR) test], complement system compartments, and immunophenotyping of B, T, and NK cells (evaluation of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, and CD16-CD56 by flow cytometry). They were also checked for HIV infection (virus copy number with PCR method). HIV negative patients with normal above mentioned immunological assessments were evaluated for polyclonal and specific stimulation of PBMCs using LTT assay. To study proliferation activity of patients’ samples compared to the healthy controls, Stimulation index (SI) was determined against PHA (as a polyclonal activator), BCG, and Candida (as specific antigens).
PBMCs were isolated using density-gradient centrifugation on Ficoll-Histoprep, from 2 to 3 ml of heparinized blood. Then, PBMCs were seeded in a 96-well flat bottom (Nunc, Denmark) tissue culture plates at a concentration of 1 × 10 5 cells/well containing 100 μl of RPMI-1640 (supplemented with 10% FCS) tissue culture medium. Cells were cultured in the presence of either BCG ( M. bovis BCG, Pasteur® sub-strain) at an MOI of 20 BCG/leukocytes or 10 6 CFU/ml of heat-inactivated (60 °C for 30 min) Candida albicans ( C. albicans ) antigens (Strain 1386, DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany). C. albicans were used at an effector/target ratio of 1:1. Positive and negative controls were established using unstimulated cells for negative control and PHA (7 μg/well, Gibco, USA)-stimulated cells as positive control. A healthy control sample was concomitantly tested in the same culture period and stimulation conditions. For every condition, each sample was assayed in triplicates. Then, the plate was incubated at 37 °C, by 5% CO 2 incubator. Cell proliferation was assessed using a colorimetric bromodeoxyuridine (5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine) [BrdU] proliferation kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Roche, Germany). In brief, an overnight incubation was done after adding BrdU on day 4. Thereafter, DNA was fixed and HRP-conjugated anti-Brdu antibody was used to detect Brdu incorporation to DNA. Enzyme-substrate interaction was detected as the change of colorless substrate to blue, using 1% sulfuric acid. The absorbance point was read at 450 nm within a maximum period of 30 min after adding stop solution by a micro plate spectrophotometer (Powerwave, Biotek, USA). Final results were calculated as a SI:
SI = OD of stimulated cells by PHA or antigens (mean of triplicates)/OD of unstimulated cells (mean of triplicates)
The cutoff values of LTT setting were determined using statistical analysis of the stimulation indices of 100 healthy BCG-vaccinated children under the age of 13 years (using the remains of their routine checkup examination after obtaining signed informed consent by their guardians). Then, LTT results of patients and age-matched healthy controls were analyzed using the cutoff values, determined as 3.4 (sensitivity = 80%, specificity = 73%), 2.3 (sensitivity and specificity = 99.62%), and 2.8 (sensitivity = 80%, specificity = 73%) for PHA, BCG, and Candida -stimulated PBMCs, respectively.
Cytokine Measurement
Since measuring IL-12 and IFN-γ levels are essential for identifying the loop defect, as previously described, we assessed these cytokines in an activated whole blood sample setting. [ ]. Three to 5 ml heparinized whole blood samples were drawn from patients and age-matched healthy controls ( n = 12; male: 5, female: 7). Then, blood samples were diluted 1:2 in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 g/ml streptomycin (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) at a final volume of 1 ml dispensed into four separate wells of a 24-well plate. Then, cells were incubated 18 h with live BCG at an MOI of 20 BCG/leukocytes plus recombinant human IFN-γ (rhIFN-γ, 5000 IU/ml; Imukin, Boehringer Ingelheim) and 48 h with live BCG plus recombinant human IL-12 (rhIL-12, 20 ng/ml; R&D Systems, USA) for IL-12p70 and IFN-γ assessments, respectively. After finishing the incubation time, using ELISA kits (eBioscience, USA), cell-free supernatants were collected and stored at − 70 °C to measure the cytokines according to the manufacture’s instruction. Two wells were also considered for medium alone and live BCG, as controls. The final results were standardized by expressing them as pg/ml/10 6 PBMC. Using blood cell count, the total number of PBMCs was determined on the first day of culture.
Genetic Study
Genomic DNA (gDNA) was obtained from patients, siblings, and parents’ whole blood samples when they were available. gDNA (3 μg) of 12 MSMD patients was sheared with a Covaris S2 Ultrasonicator (Covaris). An adaptor-ligated library was prepared with the Paired-End Sample Prep Kit Illumina. Exome sequencing was performed on an Illumina Genome Analyzer to generate 72 base reads. Coding exons of IL12RB1 or IL12B were amplified with specific primers (PCR amplification conditions and primers are available upon request) using Sanger sequencing method. PCR products were analyzed using electrophoresis in 1% agarose gel, sequenced with the Big Dye Terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems) and analyzed on a ABI Prism 3700 (Applied Biosystems).
Statistical Analysis
Data analysis was performed using SPSS version 20 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL). Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was applied to examine the normality of quantitative variables. Independent t test was used in order to compare the mean difference between two groups. ROC curve analysis was used to calculate cutoff values. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered as significant. Graphpad prism5 software was used for drawing the graphs.
Results
Clinical and Demographic Findings in 16 Patients with MSMD
In this study, we evaluated 16 patients (11 male and 5 female) from 15 Iranian families (P3 and P4 were siblings). These patients were suspected of having a PID and referred for further immunological evaluations. Demographic features, clinical manifestations, and concomitant infections of the patients are summarized in Table 1 . Consanguinity was found in all patients’ families. Parents of 8 patients were first-degree relatives, while the parents of the remaining individuals were second-degree relatives. Family history of PIDs was positive in roughly 81% of the patients (13 out of 16). Patients belonged to five different regions of Iran: northeast ( n = 1), northwest ( n = 2), southeast ( n = 4), southwest ( n = 1), and central ( n = 8) regions of the country. The mean age of the patients was equal to 5.1 ± 3.4 years (min = 1, max = 13) when evaluated for PID. Except for two patients with positive family history of MSMD and death of previous siblings (P4 and P6), all the remaining cases had been immunized with BCG vaccine due to lack of early diagnosis. All healthy controls in this study had been vaccinated against BCG without negative effects. Moreover, other infections including non-tuberculosis Mycobacterium spp. (P4 and P6), Salmonella (P7 and P8), Leishmania (responsible for visceral form) (P4 and P15) Aspergillus (P1), and Influenza virus (P9) were found among the patients. Accordingly, different organs were involved including the gastrointestinal tract (P3, P5, P8, P10, P11, and P13), esophagus (P3, P4, and P16), liver and spleen (all except for P3, P6, and P11), lung (P1, P3, P4, P6, P11, and P15), skin (P4, P7, P9 and P12), bone and joints (P7, P8, P14, and P16), brain (P7, P9, and P16), ear (P6), and nail (P3). Henoch-Schonlein purpura was also detected in P7 and P13 patients. A definitive genetic diagnosis of MSMD could help physicians start the appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotics for managing the infections; especially tuberculosis (isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, and streptomycin) and/or IFN-γ therapy. Accordingly, IFN-γ therapy was done for 7 patients (P3, P4, P5, P7, P8, P9, and P12) with genetically proven IFN-γ deficiency. All patients are now alive except for P10 (death at the age of 3.7 years) and P16 (death at the age of 10 months). P10 died because of disseminated BCG-osis and H1N1 influenza and P16 died with refractory ascites and electrolyte disturbances due to disseminated BCG-osis.

Immunological Findings in MSMD Patients
Laboratory findings of our patients (16 cases) are shown in Table 2 . The HIV test results were negative for all patients. Serum levels of immunoglobulins (IgM, IgG, IgA, and IgE), phagocytic activity of neutrophils (normal results for NBT and DHR tests), the percentages, and numbers of B and T cells and CD4/CD8 ratio were normal in all patients.

Regarding the cutoff values of PHA-, BCG-, and Candida -stimulated PBMCs (as shown in materials and methods; 3.4, 2.3, and 2.8, respectively), impaired proliferation capacity of T cells was observed in the presence of live BCG, as a regular feature of MSMD. T cell responses were normal as determined using stimulation by PHA, while various responses were obtained among patients for an irrelevant antigen like Candida . The SI of PBMC proliferation against Candida antigen was below the cutoff values for some patients including P4, P5, P9, P10, P12, P14, and P15. These patients were considered for chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC)-related gene evaluation. Among 10 patients with clinical symptoms or past history of oral or precutaneous candidiasis, seven had an impaired response to Candida (as mentioned above) and three showed normal SI scores (Tables 2 and 3 ). Due to IFN-γ loop defects in MSMD patients, we evaluated the levels of IL-12p70 and IFN-γ in the cell-free supernatant of whole blood samples stimulated by BCG, with or without IFN-γ and IL-12, respectively (see the Materials and Methods). Cytokine assessment was simultaneously performed in patient samples and the age-matched healthy controls. Patterns of cytokines produced by each patient sample are shown in Table 3 .

Only two patients had low levels of IL-12 (P7:1.5 and P15:0.8). This could be due to a genetic defect in IL12B gene or IFNGR receptor. Unlike IL-12, the majority of patients (13 out of 16) were unable to produce IFN-γ subsequent to IL-12 stimulation, which might be the result of IL12RB1 gene mutations. LTT and cytokine assay were not done for patient P16 as he died when his parents were referred to IAARI (we had access to the patient’s and his parent’s DNA samples).
Genetic Analysis in MSMD Patients
Due to inadequate amounts of gDNA in certain cases, we were able to perform whole exome sequencing (WES) for 12 of the patients. Although Sanger sequencing was done for all patients to observe any probable defects in the most involved genes ( IL12RB1 and IL12B ), no mutation was found in four cases (P1, P2, P6, and P11). As shown in Table 4 , the genetic analysis of nine patients (56%) showed a homozygous mutation in IL12RB1 gene which confirmed the impaired IFN-γ function of immune cells despite triggering by BCG + rhIL-12. We found a homozygous mutation of splice site intron 15 (c.1791+2T>G), in three patients (P3, P4, and P13) with defined mutation in IL12RB1 (33%).Three patients (P7, P8, and P10) had a missense point mutation in exon 5 (c.517C>T), p.(Arg173Trp).

We evaluated chorionic villus sampling (CVS) for P9 at 10–12 weeks of gestation, using ultrasound-guided CVS in In Vitro Fertilization Research Center (IVFRC), Tehran University of Medical Sciences. Contamination with maternal DNA was excluded from DNA extracted from the fibroblasts obtained during CVS. We found homozygous mutation of the IL12RB1 gene in the first fetus and the family was referred to Legal Medicine Organization for legal abortion. Fortunately, the second fetus of this family exhibited heterozygous mutation.
Familial segregation was performed for all families in this study. Three of 16 patients (P14, P15, and P16) (19%) showed a homozygous mutation in IL12B gene, which resulted in releasing very low amounts of IL-12p40. A small deletion was detected in exon 2 (c.35_44del), p.(Ser12Phe*12) or in exon 5 (c.527_528delCT) p.(Ser176Cysfs*12) of IL12B gene in two unrelated patients (P14 and P15), respectively (see Table 4 for all mutations). All these mutations have been reported previously.
Patient P16 had a nonsense mutation in exon 5 (c.510C>A), p.(Cys170*) of IL12B [ , , ]. This mutation has not been previously reported in the “Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD®)” and “Leiden Open Variation Database (LOVD).” Therefore, we are reporting a novel mutation in IL12B gene (Table 4 ).
Discussion
According to the Iranian national vaccination program, vaccination with live attenuated BCG sub-strain of Mycobacterium bovis (Pasteur1173p2) is required for all newborns except for those who are known to suffer from PIDs or HIV infection [ , ]. Although BCG vaccination has a vital role in public health, it may endanger the lives of infants with a family history of PID, especially MSMD children who have genetic defects in producing IL-12 and/or IFN-γ, cytokines required to attack mycobacteria by phagocytic cells (monocytes and macrophages) [ , ]. Although IL12RB1 gene defect was found in nine MSMD patients (56%), more than 80% of patients were unable to produce IFN-γ (81%). For IL-12 non-responders with no genetic diagnosis, there might be an unknown mutation(s) in related genes that are not routinely checked for these patients. Whole exome sequencing is currently processed for these patients (P1, P2, P6, and P11). Our results showed lower incidence of IL12B mutation among our MSMD patients.
These results were in accordance with the report of Jacinta Bustamante et al. who showed that by 45% of MSMD patients who have been identified and reported from 16 countries had a gene mutation in one exons of IL12RB1 , while only 12% of them were categorized in the IL12B gene defect group [ , , ]. Also, persistent infectious to Mycobacterium together with Candida infections caused by IL-12Rβ1 deficiency has been reported in multicenter studies among 30 countries [ , ]. In our study, concurrent mycobacteria and Candida infections were observed in 10 out of 16 MSMD patients.
There are various reports about specific deletion or substitution in the IL12RB1 gene. As recently reported, some point mutations in intron 15 (c.1791+2T>G) are more common [ , ]. Apparently, Iranian MSMD patients are mostly presented with IL12RB1 and IL12B gene defects. All mutations have been reported in previously published papers, as loss-of-function (LOF) mutations. IL12RB1 c.1791+2T>G mutation has been also described in different countries including Sri Lanka, China, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan (Asia), Ukraine and Spain (Europe), Mexico (America), and Tunisia (Africa) [ , , , , , , , ]. Considering the distribution in five Asian countries, it might be considered a founder effect mutation. However, a more extensive study is necessary to understand the persistency of this mutation among different generations and the common ancestor carries the mutation. In addition to Iran, IL12RB1 c.517C>T mutation has been reported in Brazil, Venezuela, and Poland where it is not considered a founder effect [].
In this study, we found a novel mutation in the IL12B gene (P16). Interestingly, this was the second time we found a novel, un-reported mutation in Iranian MSMD patients. The first one was found in the IL12RB1 gene and it has been previously published [ ].
While the WES helps the geneticists to find the point mutations quickly in the patients, it has some limitations including difficulties in analyzing and interpreting the results and the cost of performing the test. Evidence suggests that one of the main reasons for the prevalence of this IL12RB1 mutation (as an AR condition) is the high rate of consanguinity in some countries like Iran, Turkey, and Morocco [ ]. In the present study, consanguinity was seen in all patients’ parents. However, this cannot be the sole explanation, as there are AR forms of IFN-γR1 and IFN-γR2 deficiency, and even the related disorders of STAT1 and IRF8 deficiencies. At any rate, our study indicated that IL-12Rβ1 deficiency is by far the most common form of MSMD in Iran, while IL-12p40 is the second most common etiology, at least when manifested as a BCG disease. It is possible that patients without BCG disease (whether not vaccinated or who did not develop adverse reaction) and with environmental mycobacterial disease have a different genetic/etiological pattern. We confirmed the cytokine release pattern of the patients with their genetic analysis results [ , ]. Concurrent with our results, previous studies have reported the allelic heterogeneities in IL12RB1 and IL12B genes [ , ].
When symptoms of infectious diseases manifested following BCG vaccination (11 of 15 cases), we emphasized that their families avoid injecting live vaccines, especially BCG at birth for their future newborns. As shown in the results, most patients suffered from non-tuberculosis infections following BCG vaccination. Although we did not find any alteration in IFNGR1 or IFNGR2 gene, it seems that these gene mutations represent a more severe form of disease due to a spectrum of complete to partial deficiency of IFN-γ. This leads to a higher mortality rate compared to other forms of gene defects [ ]. A definitive diagnosis of MSMD could help physicians start the either appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotics for managing infections, especially tuberculosis (isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, and streptomycin) and/or IFN-γ therapy for patients with impaired IFN-γ production (as shown in the Results) [ , ]. Performing the genetic analysis of MSMD-related genes following the cytokine assessment would be a more rapid diagnostic way than WES to determine safety for BCG vaccination.
In conclusion, MSMD is a group of genetic disorder, which can lead to complicated clinical manifestations, even death, in affected patients. Therefore, early prenatal or post-natal diagnosis is crucial in susceptible patients so that the most appropriate treatment protocols could be administered. Since the genome sequencing and genetic analysis of the patients are an expensive and time-consuming process, early screening of patients can be performed using cytokine assessment after excluding other types of PIDs.
