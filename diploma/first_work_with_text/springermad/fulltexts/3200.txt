Introduction
Immediate-release capsules with a simple powder filling are the most common type of hard gelatin capsules [ ]. Depending on the behavior of the powder mixture, a compression step may be required. Typical compression forces are normally around 30 N, far below the 30 kN usually required to produce tablets [ ]. Although relatively weak, this compression step may be sufficient to lead to the formation of groups of bound particles capable of significantly altering bulk properties, for reasons of homogeneity, drug release, or even aesthetics. Following a proposal by Nichols et al. [ ], the term “agglomerate” will be used throughout the text to describe such an assemblage of particles.
Pharmaceutical solid dosage forms (SDFs) are made from a mixture of different components to ensure good product robustness. Typical functional ingredients include active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), flowability agents, tablet binders, and disintegrants. Agglomeration occurring during manufacturing may interfere with SDF dissolution, modifying API bioavailability [ ]. Generally, capsules containing agglomerates require longer dissolution times to release their API [ ]. As a matter of fact, dissolution rates sometimes serve to describe the degree of agglomeration of low-solubility drugs [ ]. In short, density should be as uniform as possible to standardize API delivery to patients.
Caused mainly by interparticle adhesive forces, dry particle agglomeration has long hindered the production of pharmaceutical capsules [ ]. A number of material properties must therefore be taken into account when filling capsules. Among these, particle size is critical to powder homogeneity and flowability. Decreasing particle size is known to increase electrostatic charges, thus eliciting to the formation of agglomerates during the filling step [ ]. Particle shape has also been found to significantly influence filling; according to List and Müller [ ], only isometric-shaped drug substances and excipients should ideally be used in hard gelatin capsules as anisometric particles (e.g., needle- or plate-shaped) hinder flow and cause agglomeration. According to Stegemann and Bornem [ ], high API concentrations often create difficulties during the filling process, increasing proportionally with API content in formulations. This problem, however, can be mitigated through proper diluents and lubricants [ ]. Nevertheless, overlubrication may also have a negative impact on content uniformity, powder density, and agglomeration [ ].
A number of methods have been employed to characterize and quantify pharmaceutical powder agglomeration. Typically performed on loose powders, they include sieving [ ], laser diffraction [ ], near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy [ ], and atomic force spectroscopy [ ], the latter quantifying agglomerate cohesion. To this, a number of imaging techniques have been used to identify powder agglomeration. They include scanning electron microscopy [ , ], NIR chemical imaging [ ], as well as simple visible imaging [ ]. Vision systems are widely deployed to monitor capsule defects, including incorrect size or color, dents, cracks, holes, foreign bodies, double caps, and missing caps. While diverse and widely used, these methods are best suited to analyze agglomerates in loose powders and translucent capsules.
X-ray imaging is typically preferred in assessing the contents of visibly opaque capsules. As X-ray radiation passes through the sample, some of it is absorbed, or attenuated, mainly through photoabsorption, Compton scattering, and Rayleigh scattering. Pharmaceutical X-ray imaging has long been served in processing and packaging lines to detect contaminants, scan for missing capsules, monitor mass control, ensure product integrity, verify fill levels, and confirm product count [ ]. Linked to local density, X-ray attenuation also has the potential to both detect and characterize powder agglomerates inside SDFs. While X-ray imaging has been able to recognize qualitative agglomerate characteristics, such as size, shape, and location [ , ], X-ray diffraction has mainly centered on agglomerate composition [ ].
X-ray imaging has long been considered in pharmaceutical applications. Work generally falls into one of two categories: (1) machine vision applications typically seeking to automatically identify gross outliers (e.g., poorly filled or cracked capsules) or (2) manual analysis of X-ray images or diffraction patterns usually trying to better understand the size and composition of powder agglomerates, respectively. No work appears to have been done on the automatic detection of powder agglomerates in otherwise acceptable pharmaceutical capsules.
Seeking to assist in automated quality control, the objective of this research is to develop a robust and reproducible method for classifying pharmaceutical capsules containing agglomerated or unagglomerated powders. Here, the term “classification” indicates a form of supervised learning in which a number of classes have been identified a priori. Present classification methods typically rely on direct human analysis and interpretation of individual images. While obviously time consuming, such a method is also prone to human subjectivity as well as user-to-user variability.
To achieve this objective, capsules were first produced under varying pressures to generate the full range of powder agglomerations encountered industrially, from completely unagglomerated loose powders to completely agglomerated hard powder pellets, thus producing heterogeneous samples. Six X-ray images, from different angles, were taken of each capsule to unequivocally identify powder agglomerates. Relying on human expert opinion, X-ray images of these capsules were then divided into agglomerated or unagglomerated, to develop a classification model. After this step, classification results from individual images had to be reconciled to categorize whole capsules.
Materials and Methods
Powders and Capsules
Capsules consisted of a two-piece telescoping gelatin shell (size #3) with cap diameter of 5.82 mm and length of 15.9 mm (closed length). They were produced with a dosator-type IMAtic200 rotary encapsulation machine. Each capsule was filled with a target powder weight of 230 mg (280 mg overall capsule weight). Beyond the active ingredient, the powder consists mainly of lactose and sucrose. Using a Sympatec QicPic image analysis system, the mean particle size of the overall blend was found to be 55 μm and the particle size distribution ranged between D10 = 18 μm and D90 = 105 μm.
The effect of processing pressure on powder packing was studied using seven different compression levels (i.e., pin settings). Encapsulator pin settings from 10 to 35 units were selected for this study, corresponding to pin compressions of 1.0 to 3.5 mm, respectively. Lower pressures applied to the powder during capsule filling typically produced unagglomerated capsules containing mainly loose powder, whereas higher pressures typically increased amounts of compacted material, even hard slugs.
X-Ray Imaging Unit
A SkyScan 1072 Desktop X-ray microtomography unit, with spatial resolution of 5 μm, corresponding to an approximate 125-μm 3 voxel size, was used in this study. A polystyrene sample holder was fashioned to hold capsules vertical during analysis. The polystyrene holder was not visible on image capture. Individual capsules were inserted into the holder with the capsule cap pointing upward. Images were captured at 60° rotation intervals to ensure that powder agglomerates could clearly be seen on one or more images (Fig. 1 ). Fig. 1 X-ray images of the same capsule taken at six angles: 0, 60, 120, 180, 240, and 300° in which agglomerates are clearly visible
Dissolution Tests
Dissolution tests were conducted with USP Apparatus 1 (baskets). They were carried out in water at 37 ± 0.5 °C at a rotation speed of 50 rpm, in accordance with Analytical Procedures for the product. Dissolution after 30 min was measured to determine whether the observed powder agglomeration was likely to have an impact on the behavior of the capsules.
Computations
All computational steps, be it for the treatment of the grayscale images, for the latent variable modeling or for the final statistical analysis was carried out using in-house computer scripts written using Matlab R2015, from Mathworks ® .
Latent Variable Models: PCA and SIMCA
The capsules were classified by soft independent modeling by class analogy (SIMCA) models based on principal component analysis (PCA). Relevant aspects of PCA and SIMCA will be reviewed in the following paragraphs to introduce the classification thresholds used in this work.
PCA
PCA was applied to a single data matrix X ( n × k ). The model structure was as follows: $$ \mathrm{X}=\mathrm{T}{\mathrm{P}}^{\mathrm{T}}+\mathrm{E} $$ (1)
T was a ( n × a ) matrix of scores and P was a ( k × a ) matrix of loadings where the dimension of any PCA model was denoted by a [ ]. Both calibration models were created by PCA, one for unagglomerated capsules and the other for agglomerated capsules, to be able to classify them further. Q i residuals were lack-of-fit statistics calculated as the sum of squares of each row (sample). $$ {Q}_i={e}_i{e}_i^T $$ (2)
where e i was the i th row of E . The Q i statistic indicates how a sample conforms to the model. It is a measure of the difference, or residual, between a sample and its projection into the a components in the model [ ]. Hotelling’s T 2 values represent a measure of the variation in each sample within the model. They indicate how far each sample is from the center of the model. Hotelling’s T 2 is the sum of normalized, squared scores and is defined as $$ {T}_i^2={\mathbf{t}}_{\mathbf{i}}{\lambda}^{-1}{\mathbf{t}}_{\mathbf{i}}^{\mathbf{T}} $$ (3)
where t i refers to the i th row of the score matrix ( T ) and λ is a diagonal matrix containing eigenvalues corresponding to the principal components. These eigenvalues represent the total variance explained by each component [ ]. Finally, Hotelling contributions describe how each variable contributes to the T 2 value for a given sample [ ]. Contributions to the i th sample, denoted as t con,i ( 1 × k ), is calculated by $$ {\mathbf{t}}_{\mathbf{con},\mathbf{i}}={\mathbf{t}}_{\mathbf{i}}{\uplambda}^{-1/2}{\mathbf{P}}^{\mathbf{T}} $$ (4)
SIMCA
PCA is widely regarded as a useful tool in representing the level to which samples differ. However, when seeking to distinguish between different classes (or groups of samples), there is no guarantee that a given PCA model will be helpful in differentiating the classes. As underlined by Wise et al. [ ], class information was not considered in model construction [ ].
In light of this, Wold [ ] proposed a SIMCA as a statistical method for supervised data classification intended to retain desired PCA properties while incorporating class information in the calibration set. The term “soft” refers to the fact that the method can identify samples as belonging to multiple classes rather than producing a classification of samples into nonoverlapping classes. In essence, SIMCA performs the PCA model specific to each of the classes included in the calibration set and then determines the distance separating a sample (i ) from each model ( j ) [ ]: $$ {d}_{ij}=\sqrt{{\left({Q}_{Rij}\right)}^2+{\left({T}_{Rij}^2\right)}^2} $$ (5)
where d ij is calculated with reduced Q and T 2 distances defined as: $$ {Q}_{Rij}=\frac{Q_{ij}}{Q_{j(0.99)}} $$ (6) $$ {T}_{Rij}^2=\frac{T_{ij}^2}{T_{j(0.99)}^2} $$ (7)
where Q j (0.99) and T j (0.99) 2 are 99 % confidence intervals in Q residual space and Hotelling’s T 2 model space for model ( j ). By relying on reduced values, d ij gives equal weighting to both Q and T 2 , thus ensuring that both metrics are considered. With this metric, a sample ( i ) can therefore be attributed to class ( j ) that minimizes its d ij value [ ].
For each PCA model ( j ) present in the SIMCA model, a joint confidence limit (CL j ) between Q Rj and T Rj 2 can be drawn. Based on the fact that, at this limit, both Q Rj and T Rj 2 have a value of 1, an elliptical limit can be drawn according to Wise et al. [ ]: $$ C{L}_j=\sqrt{{\left({Q}_{Rj}\right)}^2+{\left({T}_{Rj}^2\right)}^2}=\sqrt{2} $$ (8)
Results and Discussion
Capsule Properties
The experimental design called for seven compression levels (produced via different pin settings). It was possible to separate these seven pressures into two groups, herein referred to as low and high. According to prior knowledge, low compression levels (1.0, 1.25, and 1.5 mm) typically produce capsules filled with loose powder, whereas high compression levels (2.0, 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5 mm) typically evoke capsules containing agglomerated powder. While the former are usually considered to be of acceptable quality, the latter are not, as they typically result in failed dissolution tests.
Capsule weight and dissolution rates, plotted against compression levels, are illustrated in Fig. 2 . It can be seen that capsule weight remained statistically constant, whereas dissolution rates decreased with increased compression. Unpaired Student’s t tests between both groups ( n = 60) confirmed this through p values of p = 0.76 for weight and p < 0.001 for dissolution. Fig. 2 Capsule weight ( a ) and dissolution ( b ) versus compression
Grayscale X-Ray Images
With X-ray images, it is possible to visually distinguish between agglomerated and unagglomerated powder packing. As depicted in Fig. 3 , unagglomerated powders are characterized by a light gray color, suggesting that the capsule is devoid of powder slugs while agglomerated powders are characterized by dark gray regions. In this study, the presence of such agglomerates is enough for a capsule to be considered as unacceptable. Such capsules range from those containing uneven powder packing, exhibiting both dark and light areas indicating the presence of agglomerated and unagglomerated areas of powder to those enclosing monolithic blocks (slugs) clearly visible in X-ray images. Fig. 3 a X-ray images taken of capsules with unagglomerated powder packing ( 1 ), agglomerated uneven powder packing ( 2 ), and agglomerated slug-like powder packing ( 3 ). b Grayscale pixel intensity distributions for the three images
X-ray images are acquired by an eight-bit charged-coupled device (CCD), encoding images into 256 gray levels where 0 is associated with black and 255 with white. A grayscale distribution histogram can be produced by doing a pixel count for every 256 different colors or gray level in each image. In Fig. 3 , the unagglomerated capsule has a peak at 125 whereas the agglomerated capsules have peaks at 115 (uneven packing) and 105 (slug). Pixel count distribution will skew to the right when the capsule has a lot of pellets due to darker regions.
Model Calibration
A two-class SIMCA model was created with low-pressure and high-pressure capsules. As mentioned, low-pressure settings (compression below 1.5 mm) typically produced capsules containing loose powder whereas high pressures (compression above 2.0 mm) typically generated capsules containing agglomerated powder. This dataset was therefore divided into four subsets: low-pressure calibration and test sets as well as high-pressure calibration and test sets. The low-pressure calibration set contained 20 capsules (120 images) chosen by product experts to represent unagglomerated products. All remaining low-pressure samples, accounting for 40 capsules (240 images), made up the low-pressure test set. The same scheme created high-pressure calibration and test sets.
To produce the models, the images were first converted into grayscale intensity histograms, smoothed by 15-point, first-order, polynomial Savitzky-Golay function. The three-component PCA models were then calculated to capture most variability in the data; the low-pressure model captured 96.0 % of variability (PC 1 = 47.5 %, PC 2 = 41.0 %, PC 3 = 7.5 %) whereas the high-pressure model captured 90.1 % (PC 1 = 61.2 %, PC 2 = 19.1 %, PC 3 = 9.8 %).
Figure 4 presents Hotelling contributions (Eq. 4 ) for both high- and low-pressure models. When compared, these contributions helped show how the samples differed from one another. As expected, high-pressure samples, containing more and denser slugs, were influenced by relatively dark grayscale intensities, starting at 90, and were little affected by pixels brighter than 120. The contribution of white pixels (i.e., grayscale intensities above 250) also contributes significantly to the model. This appears to be linked to the fact that as more powder agglomerates, it will create more void space in the image. As such, agglomeration alters both dark and white portions of the histogram. For their part, low-pressure samples were affected by brighter pixels, illustrating a clear peak at 120. This was linked to the fact that low-pressure samples contained large fractions of relatively low-density unagglomerated powder. Fig. 4 Hotelling T 2 contributions for high- and low-pressure models
When projected onto the low-pressure score-space (Fig. 5a ), it can be seen that the calibration sets do not overlap, indicating that agglomerated and unagglomerated capsules can be distinguished based solely on grayscale histograms of their X-ray images. Figure 5b illustrates the 99 % confidence intervals of all four data subsets. Summary analysis of this figure disclosed that most low-pressure test capsules (green ellipsoid) overlapped with low-pressure calibration samples (blue ellipsoid), indicating that most of these capsules contained loose powder. However, the fact that the green and red ellipsoids also overlapped suggests that some of the low-pressure test samples contained agglomerated powder. Likewise, the fact that high-pressure test capsules (yellow ellipsoid) overlapped both calibration sets led us to surmise that this set contained a significant fraction of agglomerated and unagglomerated capsules. Fig. 5 a PCA score plot of the low-pressure ( blue ) and high-pressure ( red ) calibration sets along with their respective 99 % confidence intervals. b Confidence intervals of the calibration sets along with those of the low-pressure ( green ) and high-pressure ( yellow ) test sets
Q -residual versus Hotelling T 2 plots ( Q / T 2 plots) were calculated for both models along with T 2 and Q confidence limits as well as joint Q / T 2 elliptical confidence limits for capsule classification. Only three images of the calibration sets lay beyond Q and T 2 limits (Eqs. 6 and 7 ) whereas a single was found beyond the joint confidence limit (Eq. 8 ). Both test sets were then projected onto the SIMCA model (Fig. 6 ). Most low-pressure images fell within the limits of the low-pressure PCA model whereas very few fell within the limits of the high-pressure PCA model. On the other hand, Fig. 6 also illustrates the fact that a significant number of high-pressure images fell within the confidence limits of either model. These conclusions corroborate earlier observations relating to the score plot ellipsoids in Fig. 5 . Fig. 6 Low-pressure ( blue circle ) and high-pressure ( red triangle ) test images projected onto low-pressure ( a ) and high-pressure ( b ) PCA models
While these projections of individual X-ray images are relevant to the problem, they do not directly address the main objective, that of classifying pharmaceutical capsules. The next section seeks to draw conclusions about whole capsules based on one or more X-ray images.
Criteria for Capsule Classification
The objective of this work was to develop an automatic method capable of distinguishing whether pharmaceutical capsules contain agglomerated or unagglomerated powder, based on X-ray images. In the previous section, a two-class SIMCA method was applied to individual images ( i ) to determine their distance to either of the PCA models created ( d i1 and d i2 ). However, as illustrated in Fig. 1 , powder agglomerates found within these capsules may not be as visible when viewed from different angles (six angles, taken at 60° intervals, were acquired for each capsule). As such, different images of the same capsule may lead to different classification results. To classify each capsule as a whole, it is therefore necessary to propose a strategy in which results from two, or more, images of a capsule are combined to predict capsule class as a whole. This classification will then be compared to that of an expert.
Capsule classification is achieved by identifying the images to be used (both number and angular position), calculating their distance d ij to both PCA models, and averaging these distances over the number of images. As such, an average distance from both models ( \( \overline{d_1} \) and \( \overline{d_2} \) ) was calculated for each capsule. Classification was carried out according to the following: ▪ Definite classification: If capsules fell inside the joint T 2 and Q confidence limit \( \left(\overline{d_1}<C{L}_1\right) \) , they were automatically considered to contain loose powder as the PCA models did not overlap. Likewise, if \( \overline{d_2} < C{L}_2 \) , capsules were automatically deemed to contain agglomerated powder. ▪ Probable classification: If capsules fell near the joint T 2 and Q confidence limit ( \( \overline{d_1}<2C{L}_1 \) and \( \overline{d_1}<\overline{d_2} \) ), they were considered to probably contain loose powder. This outer limit was based on an expert classification to validate the model. Likewise, if \( \overline{d_2}<2C{L}_2 \) and \( \overline{d_2}<\overline{d_1} \) , the capsule was considered to probably contain agglomerated powder. This limit of 2 CL j was data-specific and was proposed after expert evaluation of capsule properties. ▪ Unclassified: If capsules fell outside joint T 2 and Q confidence limits \( \overline{d_1}>2C{L}_1 \) (and \( \overline{d_2}>2C{L}_2 \) ), they could not be classified.
To determine the need for one or more X-ray images, capsules were classified, in turn with single images, two images, or up to all six images. These results were then compared to the expert classification of the same samples. It is necessary to remind readers that the capsules were visually opaque, had a circular cross section, and powder agglomerates appeared to be randomly distributed throughout them. For this reason, no standard reproducible angle could serve as reference, implying that all angles must be considered. When analyzing two images, for example, all combinations of two angles were tested and compared to expert classification. The same reasoning was applied to combinations of three, four, or five images.
On the one hand, all calibration samples, taken from both agglomerated and unagglomerated PCA models, were properly classified independently of number of images considered (one to six images). This was attributed to the fact that the calibration samples were chosen to unambiguously represent both sample types. As such, the calibration sets did not contain any outliers falling outside the 99 % joint confidence interval. On the other hand, classification results for the test sets are presented in Table 1 . It can be seen that increasing the number of images consistently improved the average calibration success for both test sets while reducing variability of the results (standard deviations in Table 1 ). The results also showed that low-pressure samples had higher classification success rate than high-pressure samples, no matter how many images were analyzed. Again, this was attributed to the fact that unagglomerated powders appeared similar from all angles whereas agglomerates were not always clearly visible in X-ray images. Table 1 Classification success with one to six X-ray images Number of images Low-pressure test High-pressure test 1 0.93 (0.03) 0.88 (0.04) 2 0.95 (0.03) 0.91 (0.04) 3 0.96 (0.02) 0.92 (0.03) 4 0.97 (0.02) 0.93 (0.02) 5 0.98 (0.02) 0.93 (0.02) 6 1.00 (0.00) 0.95 (0.00) Values represent the proportion of capsules that were successfully classified, compared to expert classification (values in parenthesis are standard deviations)
Results show that the number of images per capsule included in the analysis has a clear and predictable effect on the quality of the classification; more images improve results. While significant, this effect is not dramatic. It therefore appears reasonable to carry out this same analysis using fewer images in cases where acquisition time and/or cost may be limited. Also, as high-pressure test results do not appear to level out at six images (Table 1 ), it appears reasonable to infer that using a greater number of images per capsules would further improve our ability to identify agglomerates. All six images from capsule will be used to classify test samples in the following section.
Capsule Classification
With all six images per capsule, the test images were classified according to the criteria presented in “ Criteria for Capsule Classification ” section and projected onto PCA calibration Q/T 2 plots (Fig. 7 ). “Unagglomerated” and “probably unagglomerated” capsules appear respectively in blue and cyan, whereas “agglomerated” and “probably agglomerated” capsules are shown, respectively, in red and yellow. There is little overlap between classes in the Q / T 2 plots. As such, acceptable samples were located near the low-pressure PCA model, agglomerated samples were located near the high-pressure PCA model, and the remaining samples were located in the intervening space. Fig. 7 Test capsules projected onto low- and high-pressure Q / T 2 PCA plots. Blue and cyan capsules are classified as unagglomerated and probably unagglomerated whereas red and yellow capsules are classified as agglomerated or probably agglomerated
From Fig. 7 , it can be seen that some low-pressure test samples were classified by the model as agglomerated. To verify this, three capsules were examined more closely (indicated as samples 1, 2, and 3 in Fig. 7 ); in order, the three points were classified as agglomerated (red), probably agglomerated (yellow), and unagglomerated (blue). As illustrated in Fig. 8 , samples 1 and 2 clearly contained distinct agglomerates whereas sample 3 did not. It is noteworthy that their respective weights of 278.5, 282.4, and 276.8 mg (a 2 % weight difference) fell well within that of the population (μ = 279.8 mg, σ = 5.3 mg). Fig. 8 a Low-pressure test samples 1, 2, and 3 in X-ray images outlined in Fig. 7 along with b their location in the score plots. Red ellipsoid , high-pressure PCA confidence interval; blue ellipsoid , low-pressure PCA confidence interval
It may, however, appear counterintuitive that sample 1 was found to simultaneously lie farther from both high- and low-pressure confidence intervals than sample 2 (Fig. 7 ). To better understand this apparent contradiction, the three-component score plot was examined, setting aside the Q -residual component as it cannot be mapped onto this space. In Fig. 8 , it can be seen that samples 1 and 2 fell just on the edge of the high-pressure PCA confidence limit, confirming that they both contained some agglomerates, but that they did not correspond to truly agglomerated samples as the one presented in Fig. . The elliptical shape of the confidence intervals illustrated in Fig. 8 clearly illustrate how sample 1 can be classed as agglomerated while falling slightly farther from the high-pressure model than sample 2 does. Sample 3, for its part, falls clearly in the center of the low-pressure confidence interval.
Capsule Classification vs Dissolution
Following this classification step, it was necessary to determine whether this system, based on X-ray image grayscale intensities, was indicative of sample behavior. Specifically, whether capsule classification could be linked to capsule dissolution. Samples were divided into calibration (high- and low-pressure) and test (agglomerated A, probably agglomerated PA, probably unagglomerated PUA, and unagglomerated UA). Results illustrated in Fig. 9 show a clear progression in dissolution from high-pressure calibration samples (21.3 ± 1.8 %) to low-pressure calibration samples (28.1 ± 2.3 %). Fig. 9 Dissolution results for calibration samples (Cal High, high-pressure; Cal Low, low-pressure) and test samples (Test A, agglomerated; Test PA, probably agglomerated; Test PUA, probably unagglomerated; Test UA, unagglomerated)
A one-way ANOVA followed by a post hoc multiple comparison of means was carried out to determine whether significant differences were present between the sample types. A Tukey-Kramer test as used to determine upper and lower confidence bounds on the difference between means. Results presented in Table 2 show that no statistical difference was found between dissolution results of the high-pressure calibration set (Cal High) and that of the agglomerated (Test A) and probably agglomerated (Test PA) test sets. The same conclusion was found for the low-pressure calibration set (Cal Low) and the unagglomerated (Test UA) and probably unagglomerated (Test PUA) sets. Overall, Table 2 shows a consistent pattern of increasing mean differences and statistical differences, as could be expected based on Fig. 9 . Table 2 ANOVA post hoc Tukey-Kramer of mean dissolution rates Difference Bounds Significant Cal High Test A −1.1 [−3.6 : +1.3] No Cal High Test PA −2.6 [−5.5 : +0.2] No Cal High Test PUA −3.0 [−7.5 : +1.6] No Cal High Test UA −5.9 [−8.2 : −3.6] Yes Cal High Cal Low −6.8 [−9.4 : −4.1] Yes Test A Test PA −1.5 [−4.2 : +1.2] No Test A Test PUA −1.8 [−6.2 : +2.6] No Test A Test UA −4.8 [−6.9 : −2.6] Yes Test A Cal Low −5.6 [−8.0 : −3.2] Yes Test PA Test PUA −0.3 [−5.0 : +4.4] No Test PA Test UA −3.2 [−5.9 : −0.6] Yes Test PA Cal Low −4.1 [−7.0 : −1.2] Yes Test PUA Test UA −2.9 [−7.3 : +1.4] No Test PUA Cal Low −3.8 [−8.3 :+0.7] No Test UA Cal Low −0.9 [−3.2 : +1.5] No Two calibration sets (Cal High, high-pressure; Cal Low, low-pressure) and four test sets (Test A, agglomerated; Test PA, probably agglomerated; Test PUA, probably unagglomerated; Test UA, unagglomerated). Bounds represent 95 % confidence intervals
Combined, results presented in Fig. 9 and Table 2 illustrate a clear progression from unagglomerated to agglomerated samples. Sample classification using this four-tier system imaging system clearly represents meaningful physical differences as illustrated by the dissolution results.
Conclusion
The presence of powder agglomerates in pharmaceutical gelatin shell capsules is known to impact dissolution performance. To ensure final product quality, X-ray image analysis of the capsules can be carried out manually. The objective of this study was to develop a quality control system capable of automatically detecting such agglomerates. Specifically, it aimed at distinguishing unagglomerated versus agglomerated capsules by X-ray image analysis. Capsules were identified a priori based on human opinion and expertise before being used to train SIMCA models. Chemometric models are based on the notion that X-ray images of agglomerated and unagglomerated capsules produce different, and characteristic, grayscale intensity histograms. These histograms can then serve to determine state of the powder.
Thus, 120 capsules, produced under various operating conditions to induce differing levels of agglomeration, were divided into four sets: unagglomerated (calibration and test capsules) and agglomerated (calibration and test capsules). Then, six X-ray images were taken of each cylindrical capsule (at 60° increments) to determine the robustness of the method to uneven powder agglomeration inside the capsules.
The results with all six images per capsule show that SIMCA models achieved classification success rates of 100 and 95 % for unagglomerated and agglomerated capsule test sets. These values decrease when fewer images per capsule were taken, falling to 93 and 88 % when a single image per capsule was used. It is therefore concluded that X-ray grayscale intensity histograms, coupled with chemometric analysis, can successfully classify capsules and have the potential to be part of an automated quality control strategy.
