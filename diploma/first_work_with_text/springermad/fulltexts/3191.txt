Introduction
The skin offers an accessible and convenient site for the administration of therapeutic agents. Drug delivery to and through the skin remains a challenging area for pharmaceutical and formulation scientists, since the outmost layer of the epidermis, the stratum corneum (SC), provides an outstanding barrier towards the absorption of chemical and biological toxins [ ].
For passive drug permeation through the skin, initially, the drug must be released from the vehicle followed by partitioning into the SC [ ]. Molecules will subsequently diffuse through the SC before a second partitioning process into the viable epidermis, and further diffusion through the viable epidermis towards the dermis [ , ]. Therefore, the flux of drugs into the skin is governed mainly by the diffusion coefficient of the drug in the SC, the dissolved effective concentration of the drug in the vehicle, the partition coefficient between the formulation and the SC, and the membrane thickness [ , ].
In order to overcome the barrier properties of the SC and enhance delivery of topical drugs, different approaches have been explored and developed [ , , ]. These approaches include prodrugs and ion pairs, eutectic systems, nanoparticles, microemulsions, vesicles, and penetration enhancers [ , ]. One of the most widely used approaches is the use of penetration enhancers which facilitate drug permeation across the skin by improving the diffusivity and solubility of drugs through the skin that would reversibly reduce its barrier resistance [ , , , , , ].
Barry’s lipid-protein partitioning (LPP) theory is based on the possible interactions between penetration enhancers and the SC [ ]. According to this theory, the modes of action of penetration enhancers are disruption of the highly ordered structure of SC lipids, interaction with intercellular proteins, and improved partitioning of the drug by the penetration of high amounts of enhancers or so-called co-solvents into the SC, resulting in improved dissolving capacity of the barrier for drugs and/or co-enhancers [ , , ]. These studies focused on understanding the mechanism of action of these penetration enhancers on the skin barrier.
Penetration enhancers influence the rheological properties of gels, which are important features as topical delivery systems [ , ]. Very few studies have focused on determining the influence of penetration enhancers on the rheological properties of the gels and correlating these properties to in vitro drug release [ , , ]. It has been shown that the rheological properties can be correlated to drug diffusion in gel networks, which plays a central role in controlling the release of drugs [ , , , , ]. Therefore, understanding the rheological properties, particularly the viscoelastic properties of semi-solid gels, is crucial in predicting the rate of drug release from these gels.
Penetration enhancers can be divided into several groups based on their chemical structure, rather than their mechanism of action [ , , , ]. Most of these enhancers have mixed modes of action so it is difficult to classify them according to this characteristic. Some of the examples of the widely used enhancers involve various classes that include water, alcohols, fatty acids, amides, azones, surfactants, terpenes, terpenoids and essential oils, pyrrolidones, urea, sulfoxides, lipids, and cyclodextrins [ , ].
The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of penetration enhancers on the viscoelastic properties of topical gel formulations employing Carbopol ® 971P as the gelling agent using the controlled stress rheometer (CSR) to better understand in vitro drug release from these gels. Three penetration enhancers, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether (Transcutol ® -P, TC), propylene glycol (PG), and 70 % ethanol, which are commonly used in topical formulations were selected in this study [ , ]. The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac sodium (DNa; molecular weight 318.13 Da and log P value 1.115) [ ] was used as a model drug in this study. DNa is commonly used in the management of musculoskeletal disorders. It undergoes first-pass metabolism and causes gastrointestinal side effects when taken orally [ ]. DNa gels were prepared using Carbopol ® 971P with different concentrations of the three penetration enhancers (TC, PG, and 70 % ethanol). Each gel formulation was characterized in terms of its viscoelastic properties (elastic or storage modulus G ′ and viscous or loss modulus G ″) and in vitro release behavior using Franz diffusion cells. The viscoelastic properties and in vitro release of DNa gels containing penetration enhancers were compared to those of DNa gel containing no penetration enhancer. The percent of DNa release from each formulation was correlated to its viscoelastic properties ( G ′ and G ″ moduli).

Methods
Preparation of DNa Gel Formulations
DNa gels (Table 1 ) were prepared by hydrating 0.75 g of Carbopol ® 971P in a sufficient quantity of ddH 2 O with constant stirring at moderate speed. In a separate beaker, 1 g of DNa was dissolved in 40 g of ddH 2 O, for gels containing no penetration enhancers, while, for gels containing penetration enhancers, 1 g of DNa was dissolved in 10, 30, or 40 g of TC, PG, or 70 % ethanol. The dissolved amount of DNa was then added slowly to the aqueous dispersion of Carbopol ® 971P with continuous stirring. The pH of gels was adjusted to 6.0 ± 0.1 using TEA.

Characterization of DNa Gels
Rheological Studies
The viscoelastic properties of the DNa gels were determined using a controlled stress rheometer (CSR, Anton Paar MCR 302; Graz, Austria) with cone and plate geometry of 25 mm diameter and 1° cone angle, maintained at 37 ± 1 °C via a temperature control system. For each experiment, 5 g of gels was loaded onto the lower plate, spread evenly over the entire surface area of the plate, and allowed to relax and equilibrate at 37 °C for 2–3 min. The upper cone was lowered until the gap between the cone and plate was 0.1 mm, and then the cone oscillated at a constant frequency of 6.28 rad/s during the strain sweep experiments and a frequency range of 0.1 to 100 rad/s during the frequency sweep experiments. The shear storage (elastic) modulus G ′ and the shear loss (viscous) modulus G ″ were determined using RheoPlus 3.62 software. The strain dependence of G ′ and G ″ over a strain range of 0.1 to 100 and at a constant frequency of 6.28 rad/s was measured to determine the linear viscoelastic region (LVR). On the basis of this test, an applied strain of 0.5, within the LVR, was chosen for subsequent frequency-dependent experiments. The shear moduli G ′ and G ″ were determined as a function of frequency over a range of 0.1 to 100 rad/s. The storage or elastic modulus G ′ reflected the solid-like behavior of the gel, and the loss or viscous modulus G ″ reflected the liquid-like behavior of the gel. The strain sweep and frequency sweep tests for DNa gels were performed for at least three independent samples with a standard deviation (SD) less than 10 %.
In Vitro Release Studies
In vitro release studies were performed with Franz diffusion cells (Copley, UK) having a permeation orifice of 15 mm (effective diffusion surface area of 1.76 cm 2 ) and receiver chamber volume of 15 mL. A Strat-M™ membrane (Merck Millipore, Germany), a synthetic membrane with diffusion characteristics that correlate more closely to human skin than do animal skin models, was used in this study [ ]. No soaking or hydration was required for the membrane prior to use. The membrane was clamped between the donor and receiver chamber of the vertical diffusion cells. The receptor chamber was filled with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) and methanol (70:30 v / v ) to solubilize DNa and to ensure sink conditions as previously reported [ ]. To further validate the selection of the receptor medium, the solubility of DNa in PBS and methanol (70:30 v / v ) was determined at 37 ± 1 °C and was found to be greater than 100 mg/mL. The receiver chambers were thermostated at 37 ± 1 °C using convection heating through the half-moon jackets. The solutions inside the receiver chambers were magnetically stirred at 500 rpm throughout the experiment. About 0.3 g of each DNa gel was placed in the donor chamber. At 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 h, 1.5 mL of the solution in the receiver chamber was removed and filtered through a 0.45-μm membrane filter. To maintain sink conditions, an equal volume of fresh medium thermostated at 37 °C was added with great care to the receiver compartment to avoid trapping air beneath the membrane. The concentration of DNa in each sample was determined using a validated HPLC method. All measurements were performed at least three times. DNa solution of 10 mg/mL in PBS and methanol (70:30 v / v ) was used as control. Cumulative corrections were made to obtain the amount of DNa released at each time interval. The cumulative amount of DNa permeated through the membrane was plotted as a function of time. The drug flux at steady state ( J ss , μg/cm 2 /h) was calculated from the slope of the linear portion of the cumulative amount permeated through the membrane per unit area versus time plot [ ].
HPLC Analysis of DNa from Receiver Solutions
Quantitative determination of DNa from receiver solutions of the in vitro diffusion studies was performed by HPLC (Shimadzu LC-2010C HT, USA) equipped with an autosampler and UV/VIS detector. The chromatographic separation was performed at room temperature using a Hypersil ® BDS-5 μm, RP-C8 column (250 mm × 4.6 mm, Thermo Scientific). Methanol and water (70: 30 v / v ) were used as the mobile phase after adjusting the pH to 3.0 ± 0.5 using phosphoric acid [ ]. The mobile phase was delivered at a flow rate of 1 mL/min, and the sample injection volume was 20 μL. The detection wavelength was 280 nm. The elution period was 12.5 min while the retention time of DNa was about 8.8 min. The concentration of DNa in the samples was determined from a standard curve of DNa in the same mobile phase ( y = 352,537 x − 2242, R 2 = 0.9999, where y is the area under the peak and x is the concentration of DNa in μg/mL).
Kinetic Analysis of In Vitro Diffusion Profiles
To understand the mechanism of DNa release from gels, the data obtained from the in vitro diffusion studies were fitted to the Korsmeyer–Peppas equation given below [ ]: $$ Q={M}_t/{M}_{\infty }=K{t}^n $$ (1)
The individual in vitro fractional release profile ( Q ) was calculated as the ratio between the cumulative amount of drug released at time t ( M t ) and drug released completely at infinite time ( M ∞ ). K represents the release rate constant, and n is the diffusion exponent which characterizes the diffusion mechanism. A value of n = 0.45 represents Fickian diffusion, 0.5 < n < 1.0 represents anomalous transport (diffusion and erosion), n = 1.0 represents the case II transport (erosion), and n > 1 represents super case II transport [ , ]. The coefficient of determination ( R 2 ) indicates the good linearity of the in vitro release profile fitting to the mathematical model.
Statistical Analysis
The effect of the different concentrations of penetration enhancers on G ′ and G ″ of the gels at four selected frequencies (0.1, 1, 10, and 100 rad/s) was analyzed using two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s HSD post hoc test. Statistical analysis was performed using Graphpad Prism 6 and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results and Discussion
Rheological Studies
Linear Viscoelastic Region (LVR) of DNa Gels
Rheological measurements should be conducted in a linear viscoelastic region (LVR) where the viscoelastic moduli G ′ and G ″ are independent of strain and are only related to its molecular structure. Within LVR, the gel response is independent of the magnitude of the deformation, and the gel structure is maintained intact [ ]. In the dynamic oscillation test, the levels of applied strain are increased at a constant frequency. The point at which the viscoelastic modulus (either G ′ or G ″) deviates by more than 10 % from a constant (plateau) value indicates departure from LVR and is known as the critical strain ( ɣ c ). The oscillation strain sweep study was used to determine the LVR of DNa gels before the oscillation frequency sweep test [ ]. The oscillation strain sweep was conducted over a range of 0.1 to 100 and at a fixed frequency of 6.28 rad/s.
Figure 1 presents the oscillation strain sweep study of DNa gels with 0 % and 10, 30, or 40 % penetration enhancers TC, PG, and 70 % ethanol. The LVR for DNa gel with 0 % penetration enhancer, where the observed G ′ and G ″ were independent of the applied strain, occurred over a strain range of 0.1–1.58 (Fig. 1 a). In addition, G ′ was dominant over G ″ in the linear regime, indicating a gel structure [ ]. Beyond a critical strain ( ɣ c ) of 1.58, G ′ and G ″ deviated from the LVR, where G ′ strongly decreased and G ″ simultaneously increased with deformation, and the gel network was disrupted [ ]. Fig. 1 Strain dependence of storage modulus G ′ and loss modulus G ″ for DNa gels containing a 0 % penetration enhancer; b 10, 30, and 40 % TC; c 10, 30, and 40 % PG; and d 10, 30, and 40 % of 70 % ethanol over a strain range of 0.1 to 100 at a fixed frequency of 6.28 rad/s. Arrows indicate the LVR of the gels. Data are represented as the mean ± SD ( n = 4)
Figure 1 b presents the oscillation strain sweep study of DNa gels containing 10, 30, and 40 % TC. The LVR for DNa gels occurred over a strain range of 0.1–2.51. The four gels exhibited similar response with G ′ dominant over G ″ in the linear regime, indicating that gels had formed a continuous network structure [ ]. Beyond a ɣ c of 2.51, a deformation occurs where G ′ and G ″ deviated from the LVR, reaching the non-LVR and the network is partially broken [ ]. The elastic modulus G ′ decreased with increasing TC concentration. However, the viscous modulus G ″ was relatively close to each other in DNa gels containing 10 and 30 % TC but dramatically decreased in DNa gels containing 40 % TC.
Figure 1 c presents the oscillation strain sweep study of DNa gels containing 10, 30, and 40 % PG. The four gels were elastic ( G ′ > G ″), recovering to their original shape when shear is removed. At a low strain range (0.1–2.51), DNa gels show LVR at which G ′ and G ″ remain constant. When the strain increases beyond ɣ c of 2.51, G ′ values start to decrease whereas G ″ values start to increase, indicating a deviation from the LVR and a partial breakdown in the gel structure. The G ′ values of DNa gels containing 10 and 30 % PG were close to each other and higher compared to those of DNa gel containing 40 % PG. The G ″ values were relatively close to each other in DNa gels containing 10, 30, and 40 % PG.
Figure 1 d presents the oscillation strain sweep study of DNa gels containing 10, 30, and 40 % of 70 % ethanol. For the four gels, G ′ dominated G ″, indicating the formation of a gel structure. The LVR for DNa gels containing 10 and 30 % of 70 % ethanol occurred over a strain range of 0.1–2.51. However, for DNa gels containing 40 % of 70 % ethanol, the LVR extended over a shorter strain range of 0.1–1.58. Beyond ɣ c of 1.58 and 2.51, G ′ and G ″ deviated from the LVR, where G ′ strongly decreased and G ′ slightly increased, resulted in gel deformation and disruption in the network. The G ′ values of DNa gels containing 10 % of 70 % ethanol were higher compared to those of 30 and 40 % of 70 % ethanol. The G ″ values were relatively close to each other in DNa gels containing 10, 30, and 40 % of 70 % ethanol. Although the SD for DNa gel containing 10 % of 70 % ethanol appeared to be larger compared to other DNa gels (Fig. 1 d), the SD is still within the limit (< 10 %).
Based on the oscillation strain studies, a value of an applied strain of 0.5, within the LVR of the DNa gels, was chosen and used in the frequency sweep analysis. The linear viscoelastic parameters (LVR and ɣ c ) of DNa gels are summarized in Table 2 .

Frequency Dependence of Viscoelastic Properties of DNa Gels
The spreadability of gel formulations and their retention and contact time on skin surface are governed by the viscoelastic properties ( G ′ and G ″) of these gels [ ]. Therefore, for gels to enhance retention at the site of application and to offer a prolonged controlled drug release platform, they should be predominantly elastic, exhibiting high G ′ values [ ]. In addition, the drug release from the pharmaceutical semi-solid gels is primarily affected by the viscoelastic properties of gels [ , ].
Figures 2 , 3 , and 4 present the frequency dependence of G ′ and G ″ of DNa gels containing 0 % penetration enhancer, and 10, 30, and 40 % TC, PG, or 70 % ethanol, respectively. For all DNa gels, G ′ was always higher than G ″ over the entire frequency range (0.1–100 rad/s), indicating that gels exhibited predominantly elastic behavior and formed a gel-like network. The elastic modulus G ′ increased with increasing frequency, indicating that G ′ was frequency dependent. In addition, gels exhibited low viscous contribution ( G ″ values) owing to the formation of strong gels with a high elastic modulus ( G ′). At low oscillation frequencies (0.1–1 rad/s), G ″ decreased slowly with frequency. This decrease reflects that at lower frequency the time scale of the measurement or deformation becomes increasingly sufficient to allow complete disentanglement (relaxation) of the temporary linkages between chains (long-range motions), which results in less energy dissipation (i.e., low G ″) [ ]. On the contrary, beyond 1 rad/s, G ″ strongly increased with increasing frequency, indicating that G ″ was frequency dependent. At high frequency, the shorter time scale of the measurement or deformation, compared to that at low frequency, becomes insufficient to allow relaxation of the temporary linkages between chains. This reflects increasing dissipation due to short-range motions within chains [ ]. DNa gel containing 0 % penetration enhancer exhibited the highest G ′ values, indicating a formation of a strong gel network. Fig. 2 Frequency dependence of a storage modulus G ′ and b loss modulus G ″ for DNa gels containing 0, 10, 30, and 40 % TC. Data are represented as the mean ± SD ( n = 4) Fig. 3 Frequency dependence of a storage modulus G ′ and b loss modulus G ″ for DNa gels containing 10, 30, and 40 % PG. The frequency dependence G ′ and G ″ of DNa gels containing 0 % penetration enhancer was added to the figure for comparison. Data are represented as the mean ± SD ( n = 4) Fig. 4 Frequency dependence of a storage modulus G ′ and b loss modulus G ″ for DNa gels containing 0, 10, 30, and 40 % of 70 % ethanol. The frequency dependence G ′ and G ″ of DNa gels containing 0 % penetration enhancer was added to the figure for comparison. Data are represented as the mean ± SD ( n = 4)
Upon the addition of the penetration enhancer TC to DNa gels, the elastic modulus G ′ significantly decreased with increasing TC concentration ( p < 0.05) (Fig. 2 a). G ″ values of DNa gel containing 10 % were slightly lower than those of DNa gels containing 0 % penetration enhancer. However, at high TC concentration (30 and 40 %), the viscous modulus G ″ was more significantly decreased with increasing TC concentration ( p < 0.0001) (Fig. 2 b). Therefore, the viscoelastic properties ( G ′ and G ′ moduli) of DNa gels were strongly dependent on TC concentration, where DNa gel containing 40 % TC exhibited the lowest G ′ and G ″ values. This is in agreement with Li et al. who reported that the viscosity of emulgel prepared using different grades of Carbopol ® decreased with the penetration enhancer TC [ ].
Figure 3 presents the frequency dependence of G ′ and G ″ of DNa gels containing 10, 30, and 40 % PG. Upon the addition of PG, G ′ significantly decreased with increasing PG concentration at all frequencies ( p < 0.05). However, no specific pattern was observed in the G ″ curves. For example, at frequencies < 1 rad/s, G ″ either did not change or was significantly decreased compared to gels containing 0 % PG, but at frequencies > 1 rad/s and at high concentrations (30 and 40 % PG), G ″ was significantly increased ( p < 0.05). This indicates that the influence of PG was more prominent on the elastic properties than on the viscous properties of the DNa gels.
For DNa gels containing 10, 30, and 40 % of 70 % ethanol, increasing the concentration of 70 % ethanol in DNa gels resulted in a significant reduction in both G ′ and G ″ ( p < 0.05), with a more prominent effect on G ′ (Fig. 4 ). Table 3 summarizes the frequency dependence of G ′ and G ″ of the DNa gels containing 10, 30, and 40 % TC, PG, and 70 % ethanol at four selected oscillatory frequencies (0.1, 1, 10, and 100 rad/s) at a constant strain of 0.5 as well as the p values obtained from statistical analysis.

With the data obtained from Table 3 , the G ′ and G ″ moduli of DNa gels at a selected frequency of 10 rad/s (i.e., closest to 6.28 rad/s, the frequency used in determining the LVR) were plotted against the concentration of each penetration enhancer using linear regression analysis (Fig. 5 ). Both moduli negatively correlated to the TC and 70 % ethanol concentration, where G ′ and G ″ decreased with increasing TC and 70 % ethanol concentration. For PG, G ′ was negatively correlated to PG concentration; however, no correlation was obtained between G ″ and PG concentration. Moreover, it is apparent that all penetration enhancers exhibited a higher effect on G ′ than on G ″.

In Vitro Release Studies
In this study, Strat-M™ membrane was used as a synthetic membrane for in vitro release studies as a substitute for human skin [ , , ]. Strat-M™ membrane is a synthetic multi-layer membrane with a morphology that is close to human skin [ ]. Previous studies have shown that Strat-M™ membrane can be used as a surrogate to human skin to study the diffusion characteristics for a wide range of compounds for topical and transdermal formulations, providing close transport correlation characteristics to human skin [ , , ]. The effect of penetration enhancers on in vitro drug release through the Strat-M™ membrane has been evaluated by Joshi et al. [ ]. They have shown that in the presence of the penetration enhancers PG and oleic acid, the diffusion of the chemical compound caffeine through the Strat-M™ membrane was enhanced with a similar enhancing effect to that observed with human skin.
The three penetration enhancers (TC, PG, and 70 % ethanol) were selected based on their common use in topical and transdermal formulations and their chemical classification, where TC is a glycol ether, PG is a glycol, and ethanol is a short-chain alcohol [ ]. The concentrations (10, 30, and 40 % w / w ) of the three penetration enhancers (TC, PG, and 70 % ethanol) used in this study were chosen based on previous studies [ , , , , , , ]. For instance, Mura et al. studied the influence of TC and PG on clonazepam permeation from Carbopol ® gels at a concentration range of 10–50 and 15–50 % w / w , respectively [ ]. In addition, the influence of PG on the in vitro release of diclofenac sodium and acyclovir from Carbopol ® gels was investigated at a concentration range of 20 up to 70 % w / w [ , ]. Moreover, the enhancing effect of ethanol on drug penetration was investigated at a concentration range of 5–75 % w / w [ , , , ].
The release of DNa from gels and control solution was evaluated using Franz diffusion cells [ , ]. The release profiles of DNa obtained from gels containing 10, 30, and 40 % of the penetration enhancers (TC, PG, or 70 % ethanol) are shown in Figs. 6 , 7 , and 8 . In addition, the release of DNa from control solution (10 mg/mL) and from a gel containing 0 % penetration enhancer was determined and the release profiles were added to Figs. 6 , 7 , and 8 for comparison. All gels were prepared using a fixed amount of Carpobol ® 971P (0.75 % w / w ) and were adjusted to constant pH (6.0 ± 0.1), as Carbopol gel viscosity is strongly dependent on polymer concentration and pH [ ]. DNa was detected by HPLC analysis in the receiver compartment of the Franz cells 30 min following application of the gel, and the concentration increased in a time-dependent manner until the end of the release experiment (6 h).

The cumulative release percent of DNa (% Q ) from gels containing 0, 10, 30, or 40 % TC is illustrated in Fig. 6 . The release of DNa from these gels showed a controlled release pattern, owing to the high complexity and viscoelastic properties of the gel network resulting in a long diffusion pathway. The percent of DNa release increased with increasing TC concentration, where a complete drug release was achieved in DNa gel containing 40 % TC after 6 h (103.2 ± 1.7 %). However, the percent of DNa release was decreased in the order of 88.6 ± 3.0, 74.3 ± 1.1, and 56.8 ± 4.6 % in gels containing 30, 10, and 0 % TC, respectively. After 6 h, the cumulative amount of DNa permeated per unit membrane surface area ( Q 6 ) for DNa gels containing 0, 10, 30, and 40 % TC was 962.2 ± 24.0, 1150.7 ± 12.1, 1449.1 ± 41.8, and 1998.5 ± 35.0 μg/cm 2 , respectively. Q 6 was significantly increased with increasing TC concentration ( p < 0.01). The associated steady-state flux values ( J ss ) also increased with increasing TC concentration in gels (11.8, 14.9, 18.7, and 25.7 μg/cm 2 /h for DNa gels containing 0, 10, 30, and 40 % TC, respectively). The increase in Q 6 and J ss is due to the presence of TC which lowers the viscoelastic properties ( G ′ and G ″) of the gels and acts as a penetration enhancer. The G ′ and G ″ values of the DNa gel containing 0 % TC were significantly higher than those of DNa gels containing 10, 30, and 40 % TC, at the four selected frequencies 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 rad/s (Table 3 ) ( p < 0.05). This indicates that DNa gel containing 0 % TC exhibited a strong gel structure, which hindered the drug release from the gel [ , ]. Contrarily, DNa gels containing TC exhibited a weaker gel structure, compared to DNa gel containing 0 % TC, which facilitates the diffusion of the drug from the gel network.
It has been reported that the viscoelastic properties of gels are inversely related to the rate of drug release [ ]. It has also been shown that TC enhances the percutaneous permeation of various active substances by maximizing their solubility in the skin [ , ]. However, few studies have focused on determining the effect of TC on the viscoelastic properties of topical formulations. For instance, Li et al. have shown that the viscosity of tetrahydropalmatine emulgel prepared with Carbopol ® 971P was reduced upon the addition of 3 % TC, and the low viscosity facilitated the drug release from the emulgel [ ], whereas Mura et al. have shown that the influence of TC content on the viscosity of Carbopol gel was negligible [ ]. It is apparent that our results were in agreement with Li et al., where TC reduces the viscoelastic properties of Carbopol® gels, enhancing the rate of drug release [ ].
DNa gels containing 10, 30, and 40 % PG showed a more controlled release pattern compared to those containing TC (Fig. 7 ), where no complete drug release was observed in the three gels after 6 h. For instance, the percent of DNa release was 68.3 ± 4.1, 55.9 ± 4.4, and 51.7 ± 4.5 % for gels containing 10, 30, and 40 % PG, respectively. The Q 6 for DNa gels containing 0, 10, 30, and 40 % PG was 962.2 ± 24.0, 942.1 ± 38.8, 944.1 ± 43.1, and 796.8 ± 15.0 μg/cm 2 , respectively. The associated J ss was 11.8, 12.3, 11.6, and 10.3 μg/cm 2 /h for DNa gels containing 0, 10, 30, and 40 % PG, respectively. It is apparent that no significant difference was observed in Q 6 for DNa gels containing 0, 10, and 30 % PG ( p > 0.05). However, a significant reduction was observed in Q 6 after the addition of a high concentration of PG (40 %) to DNa gels ( p < 0.01). Gels containing 30 and 40 % PG exhibited a lower percent of drug release compared to those containing 10 % PG. Therefore, the diffusion of DNa through Strat-M™ membrane was not enhanced upon the addition of high PG concentrations (30 and 40 %). Although G ′ of DNa gels were significantly reduced upon the addition of PG, the effect on G ″ was inconsistent (Table 3 ) and no penetration enhancement was observed.
A previous study by Díez-Sales et al. had shown that no drug penetration enhancement was observed for acyclovir through cellulose–acetate membrane from Carbopol ® gels containing 0, 10, 30, 50, and 70 % PG, where the rate of drug release decreased with increasing PG concentration [ ]. They suggested that the reduction in drug release as the concentration of PG in gels increases is attributed to the increase in the viscosity of fluid phase entrapped in the gel pores, which represent the diffusional pathway in gels. Therefore, increasing the viscosity of the liquid phase by the addition of PG decreases the diffusion of drug molecules through these pathways, leading to a reduction in drug release. In addition, no significant difference in gel viscosity was obtained at PG concentration up to 50 %. However, at 70 % PG, a significant reduction in gel viscosity was observed. Another study by Mura et al. had shown that although the viscosity of Carbopol ® gels increased with increasing PG concentration, clonazepam penetration through cellulose nitrate membrane progressively increased by increasing PG content in gel formulations [ ]. It is obvious that the effect of PG on drug penetration and Carbopol ® gel viscosity was inconsistent in these two studies [ , ]. This might be related to the variation in the type of membrane and physicochemical properties of drug molecules. In the current study, the in vitro release results were consistent with those of Díez-Sales et al., particularly at high PG concentration (30 and 40 %) , where the rate of DNa release decreased with increasing PG concentration. However, at 0 and 10 % PG, a higher release rate was observed in 10 % PG compared to that of 0 %, inconsistent with the Díez-Sales et al. study. This inconsistency might be related to the variation in the type of membrane used in this study (Strat-M™ vs. cellulose–acetate). It is worth noting that Strat-M™ membrane has recently been used as a surrogate membrane model for human skin diffusion experiments in a limited number of studies [ , , ]. Therefore, the effect of penetration enhancers on drug penetration through Strat-M™ is in its infancy. This highlights the need for more diffusion studies to better understand the mechanism of these enhancers on drug penetration through Strat-M™ membrane.
To evaluate the influence of the penetration enhancer 70 % ethanol on the in vitro release of DNa gels, %Q of DNa from gels containing 10, 30, and 40 % of 70 % ethanol was plotted against time and compared to that of DNa gel with 0 % penetration enhancer (Fig. 8 ). The percent of DNa release increased with increasing 70 % ethanol, where 56.8 ± 4.6, 73.9 ± 1.4, 84.5 ± 2.4, and 103.1 ± 5.1 % of DNa was released from DNa gels containing 0, 10, 30, and 40 % of 70 % ethanol, respectively. Q 6 significantly increased with increasing concentration of 70 % ethanol (962.2 ± 24.0, 1207.8 ± 42.2, 1333.0 ± 23.5, and 1773.4 ± 19.6 μg/cm 2 for DNa gels containing 0, 10, 30, and 40 % of 70 % ethanol, respectively) ( p < 0.01). The associated J ss was 11.8, 15.5, 16.4, and 21.2 μg/cm 2 /h for DNa gels containing 0, 10, 30, and 40 % of 70 % ethanol, respectively, thus increased with increasing concentration of 70 % ethanol. This observation is due to the presence of the 70 % ethanol which significantly lowers the viscoelastic properties ( G ′ and G ″) of the gel network and acts as a penetration enhancer.
It is apparent that all DNa gels exhibited higher % Q , Q 6 , and J ss , compared to that of the DNa control solution, where the percent of DNa released from the control solution was 23.3 %. Q 6 and J ss were the lowest among all investigated gels, 464.8 ± 24.7 μg/cm 2 and 5.3 μg/cm 2 /h, respectively. The lowest percent of DNa release from the control solution can be attributed to several factors. For instance, Karadzovska and Riviere have studied the effect of drug delivery vehicle on skin absorption using Strat-M™ membrane [ ]. They have shown that drug/vehicle combinations and their interaction with the membrane affect drug permeability, leading to a different flux. In the present study, DNa control solution was prepared using the receiving phase (PBS pH 7.4 and methanol, 70:30 v / v ). The relatively hydrophilic nature of the drug vehicle (i.e., 70 % v / v PBS pH 7.4) and the absence of the Carbopol® polymer (0.75 % w / w ) suggested poor interaction between the DNa control solution and the Strat-M™ membrane. However, due to the complexity and viscoelastic properties of the delivery vehicle of Carbopol ® gel formulations containing the three penetration enhancers (TC, PG, and 70 % ethanol), the potential interactions between the drug, gel vehicle, and Strat-M™ membrane increases. Therefore, the DNa control solution exhibited the slowest in vitro drug release among the investigated gels . In vitro studies have shown that the increase in the interaction between the drug, vehicle, and skin increases drug partitioning into and diffusion through the skin barrier, leading to effective delivery and a higher drug release rate compared to that of the control solution [ ].
In addition, DNa gel containing 0 % penetration enhancer exhibited higher % Q , Q 6 , and J ss compared to those of the DNa control solution. Owing to the viscoelastic and bioadhesive properties of the network of DNa gel containing no penetration enhancer, the retention and contact time on the Strat-M™ membrane increased, resulting in continuous and greater drug penetration through the Strat-M™ membrane compared to that of the control solution [ , ]. The % Q , Q 6 , and J ss for DNa gels are summarized in Table 4 .

Carbopol ® is a cross-linked acrylic acid polymer. The Carbopol ® three-dimensional network is formed by physical chain entanglements. In aqueous media and upon hydration, polymer chains start to uncoil and expand. Gelation occurs by neutralization of the carboxylic acid moiety upon the addition of triethanolamine. Electrostatic repulsion between the polyelectric chains occurs, leading to a stiff and rigid three-dimensional network. The rheological behavior of polymeric gels depends on the polymer–polymer and polymer–solvent interactions [ , ]. Therefore, the inclusion of penetration enhancers into a gel can alter its viscoelastic properties by interfering with these interactions.
In aqueous media, the hydroxyl groups of Carbopol ® chains tend to form hydrogen bonds between water molecules [ ]. It had been reported that the decrease in gel viscoelastic properties upon the addition of TC and 70 % ethanol was attributed to the competition for water molecules between Carbopol ® and TC or ethanol, leading to poor polymer hydration. This reduces the swelling of the polymer molecules, forming a tighter and more closely coiled structure. It has been shown that the incorporation of ethanol to Carbopol ® gels decreases the number of the elastic active cross-links, leading to the formation of a less entangled network [ , , ]. On the other hand, a direct relationship was obtained between glycerin concentration, whose chemical structure is close to that of propylene glycol with an additional hydroxyl group, and Carbopol ® gel elasticity. The high gel elasticity was attributed to the formation of hydrogen bonds between the polymer and glycerin due to the donor effect of glycerin [ , ].
Release Kinetics
In order to better characterize the drug release behavior from the gel network, the Korsmeyer–Peppas kinetic model for a thin polymer film was applied to study the release kinetics of DNa from gel formulations. The diffusion exponent ( n ) and coefficient of determination ( R 2 ) are presented in Table 5 . The diffusion exponent ( n ) which characterizes the diffusion mechanism was > 1 for all gels, indicating that drug release from these gels followed the super case II transport mechanism controlled by swelling and relaxation of the cross-linked network of the polymer Carbopol ® 971P [ , ]. The controlled release profiles of the DNa gels (Figs. 6 , 7 , and 8 ) support the case II transport mechanism, where the rate of drug release is controlled by the balance between drug diffusion driven by the concentration gradient, polymer relaxation due to water uptake by the cross-linked Carbopol ® 971P network, and the osmotic pressure occurring during the swelling process [ ]. This is consistent with a recent study by our group where it was found that the release kinetics of diclofenac diethylamine from three gels (conventional gel, emulgel, and nanoemulsion-based gel) prepared using 0.75 % Carbopol ® 971P were best fitted with the Korsmeyer–Peppas model and the kinetic release mechanism was super case II transport with the diffusion exponent n of 1.27, 1.12, and 1.27 for conventional gel, emulgel, and nanoemulsion-based gel, respectively [ ]. Table 5 Korsmeyer–Peppas release kinetic values ( n and R 2 ) obtained from the in vitro release profile for the DNa gels Penetration enhancer Concentration ( w / w%) n R 2 None 0 1.86 0.9983 TC 10 1.63 0.9979 30 1.68 0.9978 40 1.56 0.9972 PG 10 1.36 0.9969 30 1.56 0.9980 40 1.68 0.9986 70 % ethanol 10 1.66 0.9945 30 1.34 0.9995 40 1.21 0.9992
Correlation Between G′ and G″ and Steady Flux of DNa Permeated from Gels
At corresponding penetration enhancer concentrations, the steady-state flux ( J ss ) of DNa permeation through the Strat-M™ membrane was plotted against gel viscoelastic moduli G ′ and G ″ at a selected frequency of 10 rad/s (Fig. 9 ). Linear regression analysis revealed that J ss was negatively correlated to G ′ and G ″ of DNa gels containing different concentrations of TC and 70 % ethanol (Figs. 9 a, c, respectively), where J ss decreases with increasing both moduli ( G ′ and G ″) of DNa gels. This negative correlation indicates that the more rigid the gel is, the lower the steady-state flux. On the other hand, a different trend was obtained between J ss and the shear moduli ( G ′ and G ″) of DNa gel containing different concentrations of PG. A reduction in G ′ associated with a reduction in J ss upon the addition of 10, 30, and 40 % PG (Fig. 3 a and Table 4 , respectively) resulted in a positive correlation between G ′ and J ss ( R 2 = 0.8646). In addition, although J ss decreased upon the addition of 10, 30, and 40 % PG (Table 4 ), the lack of a relation between G ″ and the addition of different PG concentrations (Fig. 3 b) resulted in no correlation between G ″ and J ss ( R 2 = 0.4056) (Fig. 9 b).

Conclusions
The viscoelastic properties (G’ and G”) of DNa gels were influenced by the type and concentration of the penetration enhancers. Among the enhancers, TC and 70 % ethanol, at their highest studied concentration (40 %), showed the highest enhancing effect for DNa, owing to their ability to reduce gel viscoelastic properties. On the other hand, the penetration-enhancing effect of PG on the permeation of DNa was decreased with increasing PG concentration, due to the increase in gel viscoelastic properties. Therefore, by proper selection of the type and concentration of the penetration enhancer of the gel formulation, it would be possible to modulate the effect of promoting drug permeation rate.
