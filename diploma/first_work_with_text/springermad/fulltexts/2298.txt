Introduction
Optic neuritis (ON), an acute demyelinating disease of the optic nerve, is mediated by an autoimmune response. It may be isolated or may occur in patients diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) and usually causes some degree of vision loss (Sorensen et al. ). It is estimated that among patients with MS, 40 % present initially with optic neuritis and approximately 80 % experience optic neuritis during the course of disease; permanent visual symptoms result in 40–60 % (Kuroiwa and Shibasaki ; Leibowitz and Alter ; Quinn et al. ). Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is the principal model for MS and is induced by activating encephalitogenic T cells, resulting in demyelination and neuronal damage (Gold et al. ). In this model, demyelination and axon damage associated with inflammation in the optic nerve were observed and named, more specifically, experimental autoimmune optic neuritis (EAON) to mimic the optic neuritis clinically (Shao et al. ).
Recent data have confirmed that activation of IL-17-producing CD4+ T cell (Th17) is the potent pro-inflammatory cell, and regulatory T (Treg) cell which expresses the transcription factor FoxP3 is the principal mediator that maintains immune homeostasis and tolerance (Aranami and Yamamura ). Moreover, activation of Th17 cells and inhibition of Treg cells are responsible for the pathogenesis of EAE and EAON, and the likely inducer of axonal and neuronal damage and subsequent visual complications of MS (Xiao et al. ; Hobom et al. ). The time course of the Th17/Treg cell imbalance has not previously been demonstrated to correlate with the optic nerve histopathology.
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) demonstrates thinning of the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) in MS patients with ON (Walter et al. ). OCT has demonstrated an inverse correlation between both RNFL and ganglion cell layer thicknesses and the functional disability score in patients with MS with and without previous ON (Garcia-Martin et al. ). Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) apoptosis has been detected in the EAON mouse (Horstmann et al. ), suggesting that retina, especially the RGC, is also involved and contributes to visual dysfunction in patients with ON. Flash-visual evoked potential (F-VEP) is the most objective and sensitive tool to assess the conductivity of the optic nerve latency; its wave amplitude corresponds to axon integrity to a certain extent (Bilbool et al. ; You et al. ). Initial latency prolongation of the VEP has been reported to correspond to demyelination of the optic nerve, whereas subsequent shortening of latency has seemed to represent remyelination of the optic nerve (Halliday et al. ; Klistorner et al. ). These findings notwithstanding the correlations between RGC damage, electrophysiology, and T cell imbalance are not well established.
In the current study, we examined the temporal and degree of correlation between F-VEP, optic nerve and retina histopathology, terminal-deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick-end labeling (TUNEL) of RGC, and mRNA expression of inflammatory T cell factors in a chronic optic neuritis mouse model.
Methods
Animals
Seventy female C57BL/6(H-2b) mice weighing 18–22 g, 8–10 weeks of age, were obtained from the Animal Research Centre, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. They had no any systemic or ocular abnormality and raised in Tianjin Medical University Animal Center. All experimental procedures were conducted in compliance with the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research and approved by Tianjin Animal ethics committee. All mice were divided randomly into control (normal, n = 10) and experimental (EAON induced, n = 60) groups. Subgroups were analyzed depending on the observation time points in the experimental group (i.e., 7, 11, 14, 19, 23, 28 days post-immunization [pi]).
Induction of EAE and EAON
EAE and EAON were induced by a subcutaneous injection of a 0.1 ml solution containing 200 ug myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG35–55) peptide (Qiangyao Biological Company, Nanjing, China) emulsified in incomplete Freund’s adjuvant (Sigma; USA) containing 5 mg/ml killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis (strain H37Ra; Difco, MI). Injections were at two sites along the back near the tail. In addition, the mouse received an intraperitoneal injection of 350 ng pertussis toxin (List laboratory; USA) on days 0 and 2 pi. Control group received the same amount of PBS in CFA subcutaneously at the time of immunization as sham. Clinical EAE was scored consecutively from 2 to 28 days pi according to the conventional criterion (Matsunaga et al. ): 0, no deficit; 0.5, partial decrease in tail tone; 1, decreased tail tone; 2, hindlimb weakness or partial paralysis; 3, complete hindlimb paralysis; 4, forelimb weakness and hindlimb paralysis; 4.5, complete forelimb paralysis in either arm or hindlimb paralysis; and 5, death.
Flash-Visual Evoked Potential (F-VEP) Measurement (Yan et al. 2012)
Electrophysiological diagnostic equipment (Nicolet, WI, USA) was used to test bilateral VEP of all mice according to international clinical visual evoked potential levels. The mice received general anesthetic (10 % chloral hydrate) intraperitoneally. Silver needle electrodes (impedance <15 kΩ) were applied to record the F-VEP, with an active electrode inserted subcutaneously into the occipital tuberosity and a ground electrode into the mastoid processes. The reference electrode was inserted into the nose. Flashes of light were delivered from a light-emitting diode (LED) at a frequency of 1.6 Hz with a transmission band width of 30–1000 Hz, wave width of 0.2 ms, and applied for 500 ms. Each eye was stimulated more than 3 times continuously at 10-min intervals. While one eye was being tested, the fellow eye was covered by a piece of opaque cloth. The amplitude was determined by measuring the distance from the peak of the dominant wave in reference to baseline. Latency was defined as the time from stimulus onset to the peak of the dominant wave. Two stable waves of each eye were recorded.
Histopathology of the Optic Nerve and Retina
After F-VEP monitoring, all mice were disinfected systemically with 75 % alcohol to reduce decompensation of RNA in the optic nerve and euthanized. The eyes (in quadruplicate) were enucleated from globe to chiasm and fixed in 10 % formalin for 1 week at 4 °C for routine hematoxylin and eosin staining (H&E). The remaining optic nerve specimens were preserved in liquid nitrogen for real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). After fixation in formalin, these specimens were embedded in paraffin and 5-um serial sections were cut along the horizontal axis of the optic nerve. The slides were dehydrated through a series of graded alcohols (70/80/90/95 %) for 48 h and immersed in absolute alcohol and dimethylbenzene solution for 20 min, and hematoxylin and eosin staining for light microscopy examination. Pathological EAON was scored as follows indispensible with EAE (Matsuda et al. ): 0, no lesion; 1, moderate cell infiltration in optic nerve; 2, strong cell infiltration in optic nerve; and 3, massive cell infiltration in optic nerve.
Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
Immunohistochemistry of myelin basic protein (MBP) expression and β-amyloid precursor protein (β-APP) expression was used to assess demyelination and axon damage separately. Expression of IL-17A and forkhead box protein 3 (FoxP3) representing Th17 and Treg cells expression in the optic nerve was detected. Sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and washed 3 times by PBS, water bath heated for 15 min to recover and block with bovine albumin in PBS for 10 min. Sections were incubated with primary antibody (rabbit anti-mouse MBP, Abcam, London, Britain) and rabbit anti-mouse β-APP (Invitrogen, CA, USA, IL-17, FoxP3) for 1 h at 37 °C. Avidin–biotin–peroxidase complex was added for 40 min at 37 °C and colorized with 3,3,-diaminobenzidine (DAB). Sections were washed with double-distilled water and cover-slipped with general clarity resin for observation by light microscopy.
Terminal-deoxynucleotidyl Transferase-Mediated Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) Assay
A reagent kit (Zhongshan Goldenbridge Biotechnology, Beijing, China) was used to evaluate RGC apoptosis by a TUNEL assay. Sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and finally inserted in 3 % H 2 O 2 . After tissue digestion by protease and terminal-deoxynucleotidyl transferase, dUTP-digoxigenin was added and the sections were incubated in a humidified room at 37° for 1 h. Sections were then washed 3 times and incubated with anti-digoxigenin–peroxidase solution, colorized with DAB, and stained with hematoxylin again. Finally, the slices were covered by general mounting solution for observation by fluorescence microscopy (Olympus 71DP, Japan). Cells were considered positive if they showed brownish color or brown-yellow granules. The rate of apoptosis was then calculated by the percentage of apoptotic cells of all cells in the same sampling field. The number of cells was counted in 5 fields at 400× magnification.
Quantification of Chemokines in the Optic Nerve
Optic nerves of one mouse were mixed to extract enough total RNA by Trizol (Invitrogen, CA, USA), which was reverse-transcribed using the high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Transgene, Beijing, China). All primers were synthesized by Invitrogen as given in Table 1 . The reaction system of real-time PCR was compound in accordance with the manufacture’s specification of SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Transgene, Beijing, China) in CFX96 Real-Time PCR system (Applied Bio-Rad, USA). Each reaction was run in triplicate. Hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) was used as reference to normalize the expression of the intention factors. CT (threshold cycles) value was recorded and calculated as a ratio of sample to control.

Flow Cytometry of Splenocytes
Single-splenocyte suspensions of control and experimental groups were prepared under sterile condition. For Treg cell analysis, splenocytes were stained with cellular surface antibody (anti-CD4-FITC, anti-CD25-Percp), and then, cells were fixed and permeabilized for nuclear staining by anti-FoxP3-PE. For Th17 cell analysis, the suspension was stimulated with PMA, ionomycin and BFA (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) for 4 h, and the cell suspension was collected for cell surface marker staining with anti-CD4-FITC. Cells were fixed and permeabilized for intracellular staining by anti-IL17-PE. The cells were analyzed with fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) and the CellQuest Pro software (BD Bioscience, USA). The percentage of cytokine-positive cells relative to total CD4 T cells was presented as the result. All antibodies for flow cytometry were from BD Biosciences, USA.
Statistics Analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 17.0. Descriptive data are presented as mean ± SD except for specifics as noted. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post hoc Student–Newman–Keuls test were applied to compare the latency and amplitude of F-VEP while for RGC apoptotic rate, mRNA expression of relevant chemokines, percentage of Treg and Th17 cells in CD4 cells in the spleen at different observation time points separately. Statistical difference was defined as p < 0.05 at all data analyses.
Results
Optic Neuritis Prior to Clinical EAE
The earliest clinical symptoms of EAE after MOG induction, reduction in tail of tonicity, were observed at 10 days pi. The EAE scores peaked (3.5 score) between 20 and 22 days pi and then declined, but were still heavier until 28 days pi than the control group (Fig. 1 ). The characteristic EAON histopathologic features of slight inflammatory cells were detected at 7 days pi, peaked in degree by 19 days pi with massive inflammatory cells infiltrating in the parenchyma and sheath of optic nerve, and did not clearly recover until 28 days pi when it presented as strong inflammatory cells infiltration (Fig. 2 ). Consequently, occurrence of optic neuritis is prior to the clinical symptoms of EAE. Fig. 1 EAE score of normal and experimental groups. Mean clinical score of EAE daily observed from 1 to 28 days post-immunization shown as mean ± SEM ( n = 10) Fig. 2 Histopathology of optic nerve in HE staining (×400). a .

Latency of F-VEP Prolongation Coincided with Demyelination
Animals in both groups elicited the classic waveform designated as N1, P1, N2, P2 components. We used parameters of N1–P1–N2 as the F-VEP analysis with normal F-VEP reference recorded as dominant latency (54.10 ± 3.01 ms; Fig. 3 a). Compared to the normal group, latency prolongation was recorded with statistical significance at 11 days pi (62.23 ± 3.29 ms, p < 0.05) and the discrepancy was largest at 23 days pi (82.42 ± 3.29 ms, p < 0.05; Figs. 4 a, 3 ), which correlated with the MBP expression in the optic nerve illustrated (Fig. 5 ). The integrity of MBP, as revealed by IHC, decreased from 11 days pi until 23 days and recovered until 28 days, representing demyelination and remyelination as occurs during the course of EAON. Remyelination was reflected in the shortening of latency, although it did not recover to a normal level (Fig. 3 ). Fig. 3 F-VEP wave pattern of mouse in different time points. a Classical wave pattern stimulated in the normal mouse designated as N1, P1, N2, P2 with the parameters shown ( n = 10). b F-VEP wave pattern of EAON mouse at 14 days post-immunization, the latency of which was prolonged to 110 ms and the amplitude was decreased to 5.6 μv. c Latency of F-VEP prolonged and amplitude declined continuously in EAON mouse at 23 days post-immunization. d Both latency and amplitude of F-VEP of EAON mouse at 28 days post-immunization started to recover shown as 85 ms and 9 μv, respectively Fig. 4 Latency and amplitude of F-VEP of mouse at all observation time points ( n = 10). a Data represent as mean ± SEM. One-way ANOVA was performed for the statistic of latency of F-VEP in normal group and EAON group at all observation time points with F value = 65.932 and p value <0.001. Compared to the normal group, significant difference was observed in the EAON group at days 11, 14, 19, 23, 28 as shown in the figure “*”( p < 0.05). However, among the different time points of EAON groups, “**” means no statistic difference ( p > 0.05). Latency prolonged over time from 11 to 23 days and recovered at 28 days. b One-way ANOVA was performed for the statistic of amplitude of F-VEP in normal group and EAON group at all observation time points with F value = 28.137 and p value <0.001. Compared to the normal group, significant difference was observed in the EAON group at days 11, 14, 19, 23, 28 as shown in the figure “*”( p < 0.05). However, among the different time points of EAON groups, “**” means no statistic difference ( p > 0.05). Amplitude declined over time from 11 to 23 days and recovered at 28 days Fig. 5 Immunohistochemical study of MBP expressed in the optic nerve (×400). a Normal optic nerve with large quantity of MBP positive expression ( n = 4). b Density of MBP expressed in the optic nerve in EAON animal model on 7 days post-immunization was nearly similar to those of normal one ( n = 4). c – f On days 11, 14, 19, 23 post-immunization, integrity of MBP diminished gradually and irregularity of optic nerve was observed simultaneously, which indicated that demyelination progressed in sequence. g Integrity of MBP increased partially at 28 days post-immunization, compared to the former day, indicating remyelination occurred at 28 days post-immunization
Amplitude of F-VEP Decrease Correlated with Axonopathy and RGC Apoptosis, But Not RNFL Thickness
Animals in control and EAON groups elicited classic N1, P1, N2 waveform with normal F-VEP reference recorded as amplitude (11.30 ± 1.56 μv; Figs. 4 b, 3 ). The amplitude was defined as N2–P2. The amplitude at day 7 pi was unchanged in the experimental group compared to the control (10.83 ± 1.87 μv, p > 0.05). However, a marked decrease was observed at 11 days pi (8.82 ± 1.03 μv, p < 0.05), peaked at 23 days (4.22 ± 0.73 μv, p < 0.05), and partially recovered on 28 days (6.40 ± 1.22 μv, p < 0.05; Figs. 4 b, 3 ). The decreased amplitude reflects axon and retina damage, but the trends of axonopathy and RGC damage were a little different from that of amplitude separately.
β-APP, a sensitive marker for axon damage widely used to study Alzheimer’s disease (Kuhlmann et al. ), was not detected in the normal mouse. In the EAON group, its density increased gradually beginning at 14 days, after the demyelination and amplitude decreased. β-APP peaked on 23 days pi and persisted until 28 days (Fig. 6 ). In contrast, TUNEL-positive cells (marker for RGC apoptosis) were detected in the GCL with condensed or fragmented nuclei on light microscopy on 14 days pi and increased progressively until 28 days. Compare to the control group, the rate of RGC apoptosis increased starting at 14 days pi (0.079 ± 0.019 μv, p < 0.05), peaked on 23 days (0.604 ± 0.133 μv, p < 0.05), and persisted to 28 days (0.604 ± 0.133 μv, p < 0.05) ( F = 53.66, p < 0.001; Fig. 7 ), suggesting that RGC apoptosis might take part in the sharp exacerbation of amplitude decrease. Although the axon damage and RGC apoptosis persisted until 28 days pi, the latency and amplitude of F-VEP partially recovered after 23 days pi. In addition, there was not a marked reduction in RNFL thickness (Fig. 7 ).

Except for the RGC apoptosis, RNFL thickness in retina of EAON mouse was almost identical to that of normal one, which is shown in the figure as well. e Data represent as mean ± SEM. Compared to normal group, significant increase in RGC apoptosis was detected from 14 days, peaked at 23 days and persisted to 28 days ( F = 53.656, p < 0.001). No significant difference was found between 23 and 28 days ( p > 0.05 shown as “**”)
Treg Cell/Th17 Cell Imbalance in the Optic Nerve Did Not Precede that in the Spleen
In the optic nerve, mRNA relative expression of IL-17 up-regulated slightly on 7 days pi (2.0037 ± 0.7799, p < 0.05), peaked on 11 days pi (4.1200 ± 0.2424, p < 0.05), and recovered to normal by day 28 (1.1740 ± 0.1598, p > 0.05). However, mRNA relative expression of FoxP3 started to decrease from 7 days pi (0.7807 ± 0.3844, p < 0.05), reached a minimum at 11 days pi (0.1940 ± 0.3044, p < 0.05), and trended upward until 28 days (0.9241 ± 0.0165, p > 0.05), but these change were not statistically different compared to normal. Down-regulation of IL-10 mRNA occurred later than FoxP3 at 11 days pi (0.6230 ± 0.0421, p < 0.05) and persisted to 28 days pi (0.1204 ± 0.0136, p < 0.05). Augments of mRNA relative expression of TGF-β and IL-6 were detected on 7 days (2.2940 ± 0.2503, p < 0.05; 2.5680 ± 0.2574, p < 0.05), and the differences enlarged gradually until 14 days pi (4.8021 ± 0.3214*, p < 0.05; 4.5000 ± 0.4090*, p < 0.05). Additionally, mRNA relative expression of IL-1β secreted mainly by Th1 cell increased marked from 19 days (2.8972 ± 0.1524, p < 0.05) to 23 days pi and descended on 28 days pi (1.7930 ± 0.1876, p < 0.05). Variation trends of all inflammatory factors’ mRNA expression are shown in Fig. 8 and Table 2 . The expression of IL-17 and FoxP3 in the optic nerve as tested by IHC conformed with mRNA expression separately (Fig. 9 ). Changes of Treg and Th17 cells also occurred in spleen. In the normal mouse, percentage of CD4+CD25+FoxP3+Treg cell (activated) in CD4+ T cell was approximately 3 %, while tiny proportion of CD4+IL-17+Th17 cell taking account in CD4+ T cell. The percentage of activated Treg cell decreased to 2.38 % ± 0.0031, 1.36 % ± 0.0015, 0.51 % ± 0.0031 on 7, 11, 14 days pi ( p < 0.05), but ascended from 19 to 28 days at normal level ( p > 0.05; Fig. 10 ). The increased proportion of Th17 in CD4+ T cells mirrored the trend of Treg cell (Fig. 10 ). Fig. 8 mRNA relative expression of relevant chemokines in the optic nerve. The graph displays the mean and standard error bars of the relative expression of mRNA ( n = 6). IL-17 expression was up-regulated at 7 days onward and declined from 19 to 28 days in normal level approximately. The trend of FoxP3 expression was almost adverse to that of IL-17. Moreover, expression of IL-6 and TGF-β increased at 7 days gradually and recovered at 19 days onward in higher level than normal yet. IL-10 expression decreased at 11 days onward and persisted in a lower level until to 28 days. However, IL-1β expression kept in an identical level to normal at the begin, increased at days 19, 23, and then recovered partially Table 2 mRNA relative expression of relevant chemokine in the optic nerve (mean ± SED, n = 6) Group IL-17 FoxP3 TGF-β IL-6 Il-10 IL-1β Normal 1.0000 ± 0.0000 1.0000 ± 0.0000 1.0000 ± 0.0000 1.0000 ± 0.0000 1.0000 ± 0.0000 1.0000 ± 0.0000 7 days 2.0037 ± 0.7799** 0.7807 ± 0.3844** 2.2940 ± 0.2503** 2.5680 ± 0.2574** 0.9241 ± 0.0289 1.0508 ± 0.0291 11 days 4.1200 ± 0.2424* 0.1940 ± 0.3044* 3.8020 ± 0.2844* 3.7041 ± 0.365* 0.6230 ± 0.0421* 1.1322 ± 0.0274 14 days 2.2433 ± 0.1793** 0.3136 ± 0.0380* 4.8021 ± 0.3214* 4.5000 ± 0.4090* 0.3136 ± 0.0380* 1.1374 ± 0.0477 19 days 1.9900 ± 0.2280** 0.4710 ± 0.0519* 2.5832 ± 0.2271* 2.9398 ± 0.1800** 0.1457 ± 0.0260** 2.8972 ± 0.1524** 23 days 1.4500 ± 0.0737 0.7309 ± 0.0341** 2.2531 ± 0.1789** 2.3269 ± 0.1733** 0.1525 ± 0.0290** 3.0960 ± 0.0964** 28 days 1.1740 ± 0.1598 0.9241 ± 0.0165 1.7325 ± 0.1125** 2.0160 ± 0.1765** 0.1204 ± 0.0136** 1.7930 ± 0.1876* F value 48.655 83.674 33.365 19.818 175.178 76.676 p value <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 SED standard error deviation Compared to the normal group * p value <0.05, while ** no significant difference in statistic among the different observation time points Fig. 9 Immunohistochemical study of IL-17 and FoxP3 expressed in the optic nerve (×400) ( n = 4). a NO IL-17 expressed in the normal optic nerve. b In experimental group, IL-17 expression increased at 7 days post-immunization shown as white arrow . c Expression of IL-17 expressed in a large amount in optic nerve of EAON mouse at 11 days post-immunization. d Minimal FoxP3 expressed in the normal optic nerve. e In experimental group, FoxP3 expression decreased on 7 days post-immunization shown as white arrow . f A minority of expression of FoxP3 was detected in optic nerve of EAON mouse at 11 days post-immunization Fig. 10 Percentage of regular T cell (CD4+CD25+FoxP3+Treg cell), Th17 cell and the ratio between them in CD4+ T cell in splenic cell suspension by flow cytometry. a Percentage of CD4+CD25+FoxP3+Treg cell, i.e., activated Treg cell, existing in splenic cell of normal mouse ( n = 6). b – g Percentage of CD4+CD25+FoxP3+Treg cell in EAON mouse at days 7, 11, 14, 19, 23, 28 post-immunization, respectively.

Discussion
This study investigated the time course of morphological changes (inflammation, demyelination and axon damage occurred) in the optic nerve and RGCs, damage to visual function as evaluated by F-VEP measurement, and the main T helper cell (Treg and Th17) alterations consequent to induction of EAON in a mouse model. Down-regulation of Treg cell and up-regulation of Th17 cell in the optic nerve initiate the demyelination of optic nerve, coinciding with prolongation of F-VEP latency. Axonopathy and RGC apoptosis corresponded to decreases in amplitude of F-VEP, but after the change of amplitude. Changes in F-VEP, used as a noninvasive measurement, occurred prior to the manifestation of clinical symptoms of EAE.
Several animal models have been reported to simulate MS with concomitant optic neuritis using a number of autoimmune antigens including MOG, myelin-specific proteolipid protein (PLP), myelin basic protein (MBP), and other adoptive immune inductions using MOG-activated T cells (Furlan et al. ). Among them, MOG, the principal inducing element in the model used in the current study, is an important central nervous system antigen and is expressed copiously on the outermost surface of oligodendrocyte myelin of the optic nerve (Shao et al. ). This might explain why inflammatory cells targeting MOG appeared around the optic nerve before clinical features of EAE, and why altered Th17 and Treg cells levels occurred and appeared in the optic nerve before they did in the spleen.
Transcript factor FoxP3 expressed in the regular T cell (Treg) is critical for the realization of avoidance of autoimmune disorders along with the anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 secreted by Treg cells (Verhagen et al. ). IL-17 (IL-17A) is a member of the IL-17 family (IL-17A-F) and stimulates various types of cells to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines (McAllister et al. ). TGF-β and IL-6 are essential to the differentiation of Treg and Th17 cells in reciprocating fashion (Aranami and Yamamura 2008). In the current study, IL-17 expression in the optic nerve was up-regulated at early period under the regulation of over-expressed IL-6 and TGF-β, in accordance with the previous report that up-regulation of IL-17 transcript, as confirmed by microarray analysis, and memory T cells producing IL-17 infiltrated into MS lesions (Lock et al. ; Kebir et al. ). While expression of IL-6 and TGF-β peaked at the earliest which suppressed FoxP3 expression and inhibited activation of Treg cell as early as 7 days pi. This reciprocating relationship between the differentiation of Th17 cell and Treg cell from CD4+ T cell has been reported in vitro: high dose of TGF-β promoted induction of Treg cell, while addition of IL-6 stimulated proliferation of Th17 cell and suppression of Treg cell (Bettelli et al. ).
In addition, IL-1β secreted by Th1 cell was not detected until 19 days pi. It is concluded that the infiltration of Th17 cell might provide ground for other pro-inflammatory cells like Th1 cell infiltration as reported by Oukka ( ). Consequently, Treg/Th17 cell imbalance initiates inflammation of optic nerve and subsequent histopathology at the early phase. Treg/Th17 cell imbalance was also detected in the spleen, the critical immune organ, but occurred after its detection in the optic nerve, and before the histopathologic optic nerve changes. Two reasons might explain this: (1) more MOG expressed in the optic nerve induced more encephalitogenic T cells (Th17 cell and Treg cell) earlier and (2) in the current understanding, MOG-specific T helper cells accumulate in the secondary lymphoid tissue and traffic to the targeted organ where they are re-activated (Flugel et al. ).
The visual evoked potential (VEP) has been proposed as an effective test to assess the integrity of visual pathway in optic neuritis (Halliday et al. ). In this study, F-VEP was used to evaluate the visual function of EAON temporally and analyzed the correlation with the pathology and immune changes occurred in the optic nerve. Prolonged latency and decreased amplitude occur before the clinical EAE, which parallels the clinical finding that MS patients may manifest that significant loss of VEP amplitude without clinically detectable impairment of visual function at the early stage (Diem et al. ). Consequently, the current study supports F-VEP use as a predictor of MS progression with or without optic neuritis. Additionally, prolonged latency coincided with demyelination on 11 days pi after Treg/Th17 cell imbalance, which suggests that the imbalance plays a critical role in the induction of demyelination. Similarly, decreased amplitude beginning at 11 days pi indicates axon damage, which also occurs in this time frame, suggesting that other mechanisms may induce axon damage (but not demyelination), such as elevation of Ca2+ and activation of calcium-dependent neutral protease calpain (Shields et al. ). However, the axon damage was only detected by β-APP expression on 14 days pi, possibly due to the limitation of light microscopic detection of the axon damage in immunohistochemistry study (Matsunaga et al. ). Subsequently, RGC apoptosis occurs and exaggerates the decreased amplitude corresponding axon damage observed on 23 days pi.
According to Shindler and Horstmann (Dutt et al. ; Touil et al. ; Sättler et al. .), RGC retrograde labeling and TUNEL are preferential methods to testify changes of RGC in optic neuritis, however, the results of which were identical in MOG-transgenic mice (Guan et al. ), i.e., apoptosis plays an important role in RGC loss in EAON. Hence, in the current study, TUNEL was used to test RGC apoptosis depending on the DNA degradation, and significant RGC loss was detected through apoptosis secondary to inflammation and demyelination, which is in line with Shindler et al. ( ) reports. Additionally, RGC apoptosis was detected after electrophysiologic changes were detected, suggesting that electrophysiology integrity is an important factor indicating the survival of RGCs (Meyer-Franke et al. ) and that loss of electrical activity might render the RGC susceptible to cytotoxic T cells (Hobom et al. ). Since severe RGC apoptosis was detected in the traumatic optic nerve rat model in a previous study (Yan et al. ), it is suspected that the transaction of optic never also accounts for damage of neurons in the current study. Axons of RGC formulate RNFL with no myelin and subsequent optic nerves surrounded with myelin. Recently, a variety of OCT have been used to make RNFL measurement of patient suffered MS and optic neuritis, and positive results are obtained (Hobom et al. ; Narayanan et al. ). However, no significant difference was obtained in this study, for there might be some distinctions between the animal model and clinical patients in the duration and severity of the disease. A new method based on retinal imaging reported by Sabel and his colleague (Prilloff et al. ) will be under consideration for our further study.
In the current study, there is a big discrepancy between the RGC survival and the function evaluation tested by F-VEP amplitude, named as “structural–functional mismatch.” Some reasons may account for the specific phenomenon: (1) Brain plasticity is essential for compensation of cell loss (Sabel ), (2) the safety threshold of demyelinated optic nerve is diminished to maintain the neurological function (Trapp et al. ), and (3) F-VEP represents the function of the integrity of retina, the surviving RGCs partially compensate for the function of the dead one. A study of traumatic optic nerve injury has confirmed that only 10–20 % RGCs could maintain a viable connection with their brain targets, which partially promotes the recovery of visual function (Sabel. ). Consequently, more therapeutic strategies should be adopted to protect more RGC from damage in addition to some immune modulation methods.
In summary, this study indicates that Treg/Th17 cell imbalance initiates the occurrence of optic neuritis in sequence, which potentially provides a novel avenue for the immunosuppressive intervention of disease as early as possible to prevent ongoing neuron damage. In addition, F-VEP is confirmed to evaluate the neuron damage to a certain extent, as a sensitive monitor not only for optic neuritis but also for MS. Although the “structural–functional mismatch” is detected in this research, it is rational to develop neuroprotective treatment strategies as an important addition to immunosuppressive therapy in the future.
