Introduction
Paclitaxel is a standard therapy for various types of cancer, including ovarian, breast, lung, colon, bladder, esophagus, head and neck, multiple myeloma, and Kaposi’s sarcoma [ , ]. First discovered in the early 1960s [ ], paclitaxel was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for drug-resistant ovarian cancer in 1992 and breast cancer in 1994. This diterpenoid pseudoalkaloid has a molecular weight of 853 Da, and was the first in a new class of microtubule stabilizing drugs. Different from vinca alkaloids, which promote the disassembling of microtubules, paclitaxel stimulates the polymerization of tubulin [ , , , ]. The disruption of cytoskeletal microtubule homeostasis leads to termination of the cell cycle at interphase and metaphase and inhibition of cell division [ ].
Paclitaxel poses a significant pharmaceutical challenge due to is high lipophilicity (logP ~ 4) and poor aqueous solubility (0.77–35 µM) [ , , , ]. Taxol ® (Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ), the first approved formulation of paclitaxel is based on dissolving the drug in polyoxyethylated castor oil (Cremophor EL) and ethanol (1:1, v/v). Taxol ® is commonly administrated in cycles. For example, treatment for breast and ovarian cancer is 175 mg/m 2 intravenous infusion over 3 h every 3 weeks for 4 cycles or 135 mg/m 2 over 24 h every 3 weeks for non-small cell lung cancer in combination with cisplatin [ ]. Although highly efficacious, Taxol ® therapy is associated with serious (and often dose-limiting) adverse effects, including peripheral neurotoxicity (42–70%), nephrotoxicity (18–34%) and hypersensitivity (31–45%) (reported as percentages of patients after single-agent therapy) [ ]. Some of the adverse reactions, including the hypersensitivity, have been partly attributed to Cremophor EL [ ]; and significant effort was invested into developing alternative formulations of paclitaxel. Abraxane ® , a Cremophor EL-free albumin-bound paclitaxel formulation, became available in the US in 2005. Later, polymeric micelle (Genexol ® -PM) and liposome (Lipusu ® ) formulations were approved in Korea and China, respectively. A variety of particulate formulations has been developed mostly focusing on enhanced tumor penetration and improved efficacy [ , , ].
Highly variable pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel has been reported in clinical studies. In humans, the terminal half-life ranges from 13 to 20 h with a 3 h infusion of Taxol ® and up to 53 h after a 24 h infusion in adults [ , ]. Paclitaxel is extensively metabolized by cytochromes P450 2C8 and 3A4 in the liver, and > 90% is bound to plasma proteins [ , , ]. The fecal excretion was approximately 70% of the dose with 6α-hydroxypaclitaxel metabolite being the major component [ ], and about 14% of the drug was excreted in urine as unchanged paclitaxel and metabolites [ , ]. Paclitaxel plasma pharmacokinetic profiles follow multiphase decline, and variety of pharmacokinetic models have been proposed to capture this behavior [ , , ]; however, a model of whole-body biodisposition of paclitaxel has not been reported before. Development of physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models can provide important insights into the mechanisms of biodisposition, allow for predicting drug exposure profiles in human tissues, and facilitate establishing pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships [ ].
Establishing a PBPK model for paclitaxel can advance the understanding of its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, will be beneficial for optimization of therapy with existing paclitaxel formulations, and will inform development of novel formulation with improved efficacy and safety profiles. The primary goal of this work was to develop a PBPK model to characterize the disposition of paclitaxel in mice. The second goal was to evaluate the utility of the PBPK model for predicting paclitaxel pharmacokinetic in other species including humans.
Materials and methods
Data sources
To investigate whole-body biodisposition of paclitaxel, pharmacokinetic data were collected from the literature. Only studies that evaluated Taxol ® formulation administered by the intravenous route were included in the analysis in order to minimize formulation-dependent or absorption-dependent variability. Mean data (total paclitaxel concentration in plasma and tissues) in each publication were captured by Plot Digitizer (version 2.6.8). Twelve publications reporting paclitaxel pharmacokinetic profiles in plasma and tissues after a single intravenous (IV) bolus administration to mice were identified after initial screening. Only four of these publications were selected for the subsequent PBPK model construction, and others were excluded from the analysis based on one of the following reasons: (1) insufficient data (no plasma profiles or too few tissue samples); (2) reported concentration was a thousand times higher than in any other sources, (3) did not use a commercially available Cremophor EL/ethanol formulation. The selected studies (six dose levels) were used to construct a PBPK model of paclitaxel disposition in mice (Table 1 ) [ , , , ]. Shin and colleagues reported plasma pharmacokinetic profiles and tissue concentrations (stomach, small intestine, large intestine, liver, kidney, spleen, and lung) up to 24 h following IV injection of Taxol ® at three different dose levels of 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg to female ICR mice. For Shin et al. [ ] data sets, the concentration in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract compartment was calculated by taking the mean of concentrations reported for small intestine, large intestine, and stomach. Gong and colleagues reported plasma and tissue biodistribution (liver, kidney, spleen, lung, and heart) up to 24 h following IV injection of Taxol ® at 4 mg/kg to C57BL/6 mice. Li et al. and Yang et al. [ , ] reported plasma and tissue distribution (liver, kidney, spleen, lung, and heart) up to 12 and 6 h respectively, following IV administration of 15 and 3 mg/kg of Taxol ® to Kunming mice.

[ ] the manufacturer of Taxol ® was not specified
Rat and human data were used for evaluating interspecies prediction using the PBPK approach. Thirteen studies were identified that reported plasma pharmacokinetic data of Taxol ® following single IV administration to rats [ , , , , , , , , , , , , ], and four of them reported tissue concentrations, including liver, kidneys, spleen, lungs, heart, and muscle. The doses ranged from 2.5 to 10 mg/kg. Five studies that reported plasma profiles of Taxol ® following IV infusion administration in cancer patients were used. The drug was administered as an IV infusion of 175 mg/m 2 over 3 h [ , , ], and 125 mg/m 2 as an IV infusion over 3 h [ ], and 160 mg as an IV infusion over 3 h [ ]. No information on concentration of paclitaxel in human tissues could be identified in the literature.
Physiological parameters
Physiological parameters, including tissue weights, fractions of vascular space in tissues, and plasma flow rates to organs, were fixed to literature values [ , , ]. Plasma cardiac output (CO) for rats and mice was calculated using allometric relationships: \( \text{CO}_\text{rat} (\text{L}/\text{h}) = 14.1 \cdot \left( {1 - \text{Hematocrit}} \right) \cdot \left( {\text{body}\, \text{weight}\, \text{in}\, \text{kilograms}} \right)^{0.75} \) and \( \text{CO}_\text{mouse} \left( {\text{L}/\text{h}} \right) = 16.5 \cdot \left( {1 - \text{Hematocrit}} \right) \cdot \left( {\text{body}\, \text{weight}\, \text{in}\, \text{kilograms}} \right)^{0.75} \) [ ]. Plasma cardiac output for humans was fixed to 312·(1-Hematocrit) L/h [ ]. All tissues that were not reported in the publications were lumped into a remainder compartment [ ]. The densities of all tissues were assumed to be 1.
Drug-specific parameters
For model development, the fraction unbound of paclitaxel ( f u pl ) was fixed to 0.1 for all species since paclitaxel was reported to be 89–98% bound to plasma protein in humans [ ], 89–95% bound in mice [ , ], and approximately 90% bound in rats [ ]. Paclitaxel is extensively metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP2C8 and CYP3A4) in humans, rats, and mice [ ]. Major biliary metabolites identified includes 6α-hydroxypaclitaxel (humans and mice), 3 ′ -p-hydroxypaclitaxel (humans, rats, and mice), 2-m-hydroxypaclitaxel (rats), and 6α,3′-p-dihydroxypaclitaxel (humans) [ , , , ]. Metabolites of paclitaxel are mostly recovered in feces in mice, rats, and humans, with minimal contribution of urinary excretion [ , , , ]. A total of 90 ± 6% of radioactivity was recovered in feces by labeling 3 [H]-paclitaxel in mice, and the amount of unchanged drug recovered in urine were very limited (1%) [ ]. In a clinical study, the amount of unchanged drug collected in urine was 4.5% of the total dose (up to 12 h after dosing) [ ]. Because only a minor fraction of the dose is recovered in the urine as an unchanged drug, renal clearance was fixed to zero and only hepatic clearance was estimated in the final PBPK model.
Initial data assessment and modeling strategy
Multiple publications reported plasma concentration–time profiles of paclitaxel (and some included tissue data) in mice and rats. Initial data evaluation using visual inspection and noncompartmental analysis revealed a very high between-study variability. For the same formulation and the same dose level, the reported concentrations often differed more than 10-fold (representative plasma concentration–time profiles following Taxol ® injection to mice are shown in Fig. 1 ). In our previous works, a common PBPK model of amphotericin B disposition was developed by combining data from multiple publications [ , ]. However, in case of paclitaxel, initial attempts to fit multiple data sets using the proposed PBPK model structure (as described below) and a single set of parameters demonstrated that this approach was not feasible. While nonlinear pharmacokinetics has been reported for paclitaxel before [ , , ], visual inspection of dose-normalized profiles pooled from multiple sources did not reveal any trends. To allow for development of a useful PBPK model, it was assumed that paclitaxel disposition in mice follows the same model irrespective the specific study design. Each of the murine data sets was fitted separately using the same structural model and separate sets of parameters were estimated and compared. Available rat data sets contained only limited number of sampled tissues or time points and could not be reliably used for parameter estimation. Therefore, rat and human data were used for assessment of interspecies scaling approaches using the PBPK model as described below. Fig. 1 Variability in reported paclitaxel plasma concentration–time profiles following IV bolus administration of Taxol ® to mice. Six datasets obtained from four different laboratories were used for model development [ , , , ]. The legend identifies the first author of the study and the dose level; for illustration, the concentrations were normalized by the dose
Construction of the PBPK model using murine data
The PBPK model was developed using murine data, and only organs that were sampled in more than two studies were incorporated. The final structural model included plasma, gastrointestinal (GI) tract (gi), spleen (sp), liver (li), kidneys (kd), lungs (lu), heart (hr), and remainder (rm) (lumped all non-sampled tissues) compartments (Fig. 2 ). Initially, each tissue was represented by a single “well-stirred” compartment, where the venous plasma is considered to be in instant equilibrium with the tissue concentration; and tissue-specific partition coefficients ( \( K_{p}^{{tissue}} = f_{u}^{{pl}}/f_{u}^{{tissue}} \) ) were used to describe these compartments. However, this structural model could not satisfactory describe some of the data sets. In the final model, the structure of the remainder compartment was changed to include two sub-compartments (vascular and extravascular spaces) that were described using two parameters: permeability-surface area term ( PS rm ) and tissue-specific unbound fraction ( f u rm ). The differential equations used to describe the model were similar to our previous publication [ ], as shown in the Appendix. Because drug concentration in the GI tract in Li et al. and Yang et al. studies and concentration in the heart in Shin et al. [ ] were unavailable the corresponding parameters could not be estimated with sufficient precision. To overcome this difficulty, K p gi for Li et al. and Yang et al. [ , ] data sets and K p hr for Shin et al. [ ] were set to be equal to K p rm (which was calculated from \( f_{u}^{rm} \) as \( K_{p}^{rm} = f_{u}^{pl} /f_{u}^{rm} \) ).

Interspecies scaling and PBPK simulations for rats and humans
To evaluate predictive performance of the PBPK model, pharmacokinetic profiles of paclitaxel in rats and humans were simulated and compared to published results. Body weights of 213 g and 66 kg were assumed for rats and humans, respectively, by taking the mean of the reported body weight values from used publications. Rat and human physiological parameters, including organ volumes, blood flows, and fraction of vascular space in the tissues, were reported previously [ , , , ]. Unbound fraction of plasma ( f u pl ) was fixed to 0.1 for rats and human as previous stated, and K p tissue and f u tissue were assumed to be identical among different species. CL li and PS rm were scaled from the values estimated for mice using an allometric equation: \( P = P_{mouse} \cdot \left( {\frac{BW}{{BW_{mouse} }}} \right)^{B} \) , where P is the parameter of interest, BW is species body weight, and B is an allometric exponent. Based on the assumptions that permeability of tissues for paclitaxel among species is similar and that the surface area is proportional to the BW 2/3 , the allometric exponent B was fixed to 0.67 for PS rm [ , ]. To determine the allometric exponent for clearance, regression analysis of total clearance versus body weights across different species was performed. Plasma concentration–time profiles from 6 mouse [ , , , ], 12 rat [ , , , , , , , , , , , ], 1 rabbit [ ], and 5 human [ , , , , ] studies were used to calculate the systemic clearance using noncompartmental analysis in Phoenix WinNonlin (64-bit version 7.0, Pharsight, a Certara Company). Clearance values were plotted against species body weights on a log–log scale, and a power-based regression was generated based on simple allometry equation \( CL = a \cdot BW^{b} \) .
Plasma and tissue distribution profiles of paclitaxel following IV bolus administration of Taxol ® to rats and IV infusion of Taxol ® to humans were simulated using the final PBPK model structure and six separate parameters sets. The resulting profiles were overlaid with and compared to data obtained from the literature. Because the final PBPK model did not contain non-linear mechanisms, for simplicity the simulations were performed for a single dose level: 1 mg/kg (for rats) and 175 mg/m 2 (for humans). Sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of allometric exponent (B) for clearance term and the effect of protein binding on human predictions.
Data analysis
Modeling and simulation were conducted using MATLAB R2015b software (The MathWorks, Natick, MA). All pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated using the maximum likelihood method. The variance model was defined as \( VAR_{i} = (\sigma_{1} + \sigma_{2} \cdot Y(\theta ,t_{i} ))^{2} \) , where VAR i is the variance of the i th data point, σ 1 and σ 2 are the variance model parameters, and Y ( θ , t i ) is the i th predicted value from the pharmacokinetic model. The goodness of fit was assessed by system convergence, Akaike Information Criterion, estimator criterion value for the maximum likelihood estimation method, and visual inspection of residuals and fitted curves.
Results
Initial evaluation of paclitaxel pharmacokinetic data in published literature revealed large variability. Some reported plasma concentration profiles differed by several orders of magnitude for the same dose level. Therefore, to overcome the uncertainty and allow for a meaningful comparison of the results, each of the murine datasets was fitted separately to the same structural model. Then, each separate parameter set was used to provide the simulation for other species generating a range of predicted concentration–time profiles.
Whole-body PBPK model in mice
A whole-body PBPK model was constructed according to the schematic presented in Fig. 2 . Initial model structure, in which all tissues were represented using a single compartment, could not capture the data. The modified PBPK model (that included two sub-compartments for the remainder) provided a good description of the experimental plasma and tissues data (representative fits are shown in Fig. 3 ), and all parameters were estimated with sufficient precision (Table 2 ). For some of the parameters the estimates differed by 10-fold; however, no dose-dependence could be identified across all data sets. Additional model modification (e.g., using two sub-compartments for other organs) did not improve model fits and resulted in decreased precision in parameter estimation.

Interspecies scaling and PBPK simulations for rats and humans
To evaluate the performance of the PBPK model in predicting paclitaxel biodisposition in other species, pharmacokinetic profiles of paclitaxel in rats and humans were simulated and compared to published results. The allometric relationships between species body weights (mice, rats, rabbits, and humans) and paclitaxel clearance is shown in Fig. 4 . Data were fitted well by power-based regression and the resulting allometric equation was \( CL = 0.5514 \cdot BW^{0.8634} \) (R 2 = 0.9, and the standard errors were 0.0587 and 0.001 for the allometric exponent and allometric coefficient). Therefore, the allometric exponent of 0.86 was used for interspecies scaling of the hepatic clearance in the PBPK model for simulating pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel in rat and human studies. Fig. 4 Allometric scaling plot of paclitaxel plasma clearance calculated using the noncompartmental approach. Data were obtained in mice [ , , , ], rats [ , , , , , , , , , , , ], rabbit [ ], and humans [ , , , , ] as described in the Methods
Figure 5 shows simulated paclitaxel plasma and tissue concentration–time profiles following administration of 1 mg/kg IV bolus dose of Taxol ® to rats. A range of predictions was generated using six mice parameter sets (Table 2 ) and overlaid onto 12 observed plasma profiles and a limited number of tissue concentration–time data from rats. To facilitate the comparison, the observed data were normalized to 1 mg/kg dose level. In general, reasonable predictions of paclitaxel concentrations were obtained for plasma, spleen, liver, lung, heart, kidney, and muscle (Fig. 5 ). Concentration of paclitaxel in the muscle tissue was not evaluated in mice studies, and muscle was incorporated into the remainder compartment of the model. Muscle accounts for approximately 50% of the mass of the remainder compartment; and the model was able to reasonably predict the concentration of paclitaxel in rat muscle using the simulated curves for the remainder compartment. The simulations showed that predictive performance of each separate parameter set varied among different tissues. For example, pharmacokinetic estimates from Shin et al. [ ] at the dose level of 20 mg/kg resulted in an underestimation of paclitaxel concentrations in the spleen, liver, lung, and kidney; and overestimation in the heart. Fig. 5 Time-course of paclitaxel in plasma and tissues of rats following single IV bolus administration. Symbols represent data extracted from 12 different references [ , , , , , , , , , , , , ]. Lines represent PBPK model predicted profiles using six different parameters sets (see Methods for detail). The data were dose-normalized and simulation performed for 1 mg/kg dose level. For the muscle tissue, the lines represent predicted concentrations in the remainder compartment
At the next stage, the ability of the PBPK model to predict paclitaxel pharmacokinetics in humans was evaluated. Plasma and tissue concentration–time profiles in humans were simulated using the model structure and six parameter sets estimated in mice (Figs. 6 a, 7 ). Simulations were performed for 175 mg/m 2 dose level and the observed plasma data from human studies were normalized accordingly (paclitaxel tissue disposition in humans were not available in the literature). The allometric exponent of 0.86 was applied for hepatic clearance parameter as described above. The model predicted profiles are in a good agreement with the experimental data except for the simulation resulting from the use of parameters estimated for Shin et al. [ ] at the dose level of 20 mg/kg (Fig. 6 a). Fig. 6 Time-course of paclitaxel in human plasma following IV infusion administration of Taxol ® at the dose level of 175 mg/m 2 . Symbols represent data extracted from references [ , , , , ] (all observed data were normalized to 175 mg/m 2 ).

For the muscle tissue, the lines represent predicted concentrations in the remainder compartment
Allometric exponent of 0.75 is frequently used for interspecies scaling of clearance of compounds that are eliminated through a physical process, such as biliary or renal excretion. However, the appropriate approach for scaling of metabolic clearance among species is less defined. Sensitivity of the model predictions to the allometric exponent for the hepatic clearance term was conducted, and a range of exponents was evaluated. Figure 6 b shows representative simulation results of the human pharmacokinetic profiles obtained using allometric exponents (B) of 0.75, 0.86, and 0.95 and the parameter set estimated for murine data set from Shin et al. [ ] at the dose level of 5 mg/kg. The observed data were reasonably predicted using allometric exponents of 0.86 and 0.95. A range of paclitaxel plasma protein binding values has been reported in human (89–98%) [ ]. Therefore, sensitivity analysis was also performed using different plasma fraction unbound values, including 0.02, 0.06, and 0.1 (Fig. 6 c); the parameter set estimated for Shin et al. [ ] at the dose level of 5 mg/kg was used. The observed data were better described using the value of 0.1.
Discussion
A better understanding of PKPD relationships for paclitaxel is required for improving efficacy and minimizing the toxicity of therapy. Multiple preclinical and clinical pharmacokinetic studies with paclitaxel have been conducted mostly focusing on the time-course of plasma concentrations of the drug. Recently, a model-based population meta-analysis has evaluated the variability in plasma pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel and associated neutropenia using data from 20 clinical studies [ ]. Severe neutropenia and peripheral neuropathy might limit the dose and affect the frequency of paclitaxel administration [ ]. However, definitive quantitative relationships between the exposure to paclitaxel in vivo and the efficacy and toxicity have not been established. For example, no relationship between the steady-state concentration of paclitaxel in plasma and the response rate to treatment, time to treatment failure, survival, or development of neurotoxicity was found in non-small cell lung cancer patients (treated with 135 or 250 mg/m 2 of paclitaxel in combination with cisplatin and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) [ ]. In another clinical study, the incidence of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was not correlated with plasma C max , AUC, or dose in advanced breast or ovarian cancer patients [ ]. In an in vitro study using eight human tumor cell lines, the IC50 of paclitaxel was found to be 2.5–7.5 nM, and no additional cytotoxicity was observed with concentrations above 50 nM (42.7 ng/mL) [ ]. In thyroid cancer cells, paclitaxel concentrations below 10 nM led to cell cycle changes typical for apoptosis without cell cycle arrest; however, exposure above 50 nM arrested cell cycle in G2/M phase [ ]. Previously, it has been demonstrated that the duration of exposure to paclitaxel when the plasma concentration exceeds 50 nM may be predictive of the severity of haematologic toxicity (neutropenia) [ , ]. Our simulations of human data show that total plasma and tissue concentrations are higher than 115 nM (100 ng/mL) for at least first 24 h after IV infusion of 175 mg/m 2 over 3 h of Taxol ® (Figs. 6 , 7 ). The extent of neurotoxicity in humans has not been directly connected with a concentration but shown to increase with cumulative dose [ ]. On the other hand, in an animal model of paclitaxel-induced neuropathy, no correlation was found between paclitaxel dose (0.5–2 mg/kg) and the mechanical and thermal sensitivity [ ], which may be related to a similar exposure of the central or peripheral nervous system to the drug at tested dose levels. Therefore, a better understanding of the time-course of paclitaxel disposition to various tissues (both tumors and sites of toxicities) may be required for establishing a link between pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and optimization of paclitaxel therapy. Since comprehensive evaluation of drug disposition to tissues in humans is usually not feasible, a combination of animal whole-body disposition studies, PBPK modeling, and interspecies scaling is a valuable approach for achieving this goal.
Despite development of alternative formulations and the fact that Cremophor EL can contribute to toxicity, modulate efficacy and the pharmacokinetics [ , , ], Taxol ® remains the standard paclitaxel formulation in clinical practice. Taxol ® is also commonly used as a control arm in in vitro activity studies and preclinical disposition studies for novel paclitaxel delivery systems. Therefore, it was essential to characterize the whole-body distribution of paclitaxel after administration of Taxol ® . It should be noted that only total paclitaxel concentrations in animal plasma and tissues were available in the literature; and pharmacokinetic behavior of the formulation entrapped drug and the released drug could not be separately characterized (as we have reported before for liposomal amphotericin B) [ ]. Therefore, pharmacokinetic parameters of paclitaxel reported in this work should be viewed as formulation-dependent.
A certain degree of lab-to-lab (or between study) variability is an expected challenge in meta-analyses. For example, Caco-2 cell permeability assay results of drug candidates are always interpreted relative to the permeability of standards, as substantial differences in permeability of the same compounds has been demonstrated among various laboratories [ ]. In this study, an exceptional extent of variability in reported preclinical paclitaxel pharmacokinetic data was found, which made it unfeasible to estimate a single set of parameters for multiple data sets. The use of nonlinear mixed effect modeling approach has been considered for data analysis with a purpose of linking some of variability to know factors. However, this approach was not feasible due to a large number of parameters in the PBPK, limited data, and lack of some pertinent details on experimental design in the utilized publications. Several plausible sources for such variability can be proposed (in addition to commonly mentioned inter-animal and bioassay-related variability). Due to physicochemical properties of paclitaxel, preparation of the dosing formulation can be difficult [ ]. For clinical use, commercially available Taxol ® (6 mg/mL) is supposed to be diluted 5- to 20-fold with normal saline or 5% dextrose to achieve an infusion solution of 0.3–1.2 mg/ml, which is stable for 12 h [ ]. However, the details of the preparation (and dilution) of paclitaxel dosing solution are commonly not reported in animal studies and the drug is commonly given as an IV bolus (rather than infusion in clinical studies). In one of the analyzed studies, the working solution was used at concentrations of 2 and 4 mg/mL, which potentially supersaturated the solution [ ]. The dosing container and tubing may be incompatible with Taxol ® formulation; and it was recommended to prepare working solution in glass or polyolefin containers and polyethylene-lined tubing to avoid the complication [ , ]. Furthermore, binding of paclitaxel to plastic and glass was reported during sample storage which might have significantly affected the performance of the bioanalytical assay [ ]. It can be speculated that precipitation of paclitaxel and binding might have largely contributed to the reported variability of pharmacokinetic profiles.
As described above, an estimation of a single set of parameters for all murine data was not feasible; therefore, each murine data set was fitted separately using the same structural model. Reasonable fits of tissue-disposition profiles were obtained and parameters were estimated with good precision (Table 2 ). The estimated parameters were generally within a 10-fold range among various data sets; however, no dose dependence could be identified. It should be noted that in all evaluated studies distribution profiles to the largest organs (muscle, fat, bone, and skin) were not available.
Some previous studies in humans and mice reported nonlinear pharmacokinetic behavior of paclitaxel in plasma. Plasma concentrations of paclitaxel were described by a two-compartment model with saturable elimination and saturable tissue distribution after a 24 h infusion to pediatric patients with refractory solid tumor [ ]; and similarly, a three-compartment model with saturable distribution to one of the peripheral compartments and saturable elimination was used to capture paclitaxel kinetics after a 3 h or 24 h infusion to patients with advanced ovarian or breast cancer [ ]. Saturable tissue transport or saturable binding were also used to describe the plasma concentration–time course of paclitaxel in mice [ ]. Cremophor EL was shown to affect the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel in mice [ ]; and nonlinear pharmacokinetics was attributed to entrapment of paclitaxel in plasma by Cremophor EL in the form of micelles [ ]. It was suggested that nonlinear distribution could be explained by Cremophor EL binding and that the unbound drug displayed linear pharmacokinetics [ ]. A combination of “carrier-mediated drug disposition” and saturable protein binding was recently used in the model-based meta-analysis of paclitaxel kinetics in humans [ ]. Although saturable protein binding has been reported for paclitaxel [ , , , , ], such data (or free drug concentration) were not available in the publications used for building the model. Sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of unbound fraction in the plasma on model performance (as described in the Methods). Similarly, blood-to-plasma partition data were not available in the publications used for building the model; and therefore, this process could not be included into the PBPK model. In this study, published data from different mice xenograft models and healthy mice studies were included. While uptake of the drug to a tumor could have potentially contributed to elimination of paclitaxel, no correlation between changes in paclitaxel exposure and animal strain or presence of tumor could be identified. It can be potentially attributed to the fact that only animals with very small tumors (200 mm 3 ) were used.
During the initial data evaluation in this study, nonlinear pharmacokinetic behavior was observed in Shin et al. [ ] publication and these data could be captured by adding a Michaelis–Menten elimination mechanism (data not shown). However, no trends were identified by combining Shin et al. [ ] data sets with other references. Due to high between-study variability and limited data in each separate study, nonlinear disposition mechanisms were not included into the final PBPK model. Furthermore, no relationships could be identified between the dose levels and the pharmacokinetic parameters (that were estimated separately for each data set).
An important advantage of the PBPK modeling is the ability to predict distribution to human tissues, which can be rarely tested experimentally. However, approaches for combining PBPK with interspecies scaling approaches are not fully developed. Recently, the plasma pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin in five species was simultaneously fitted using a minimal PBPK model [ ], and the allometric exponent for the clearance term was estimated to be 0.59. For amphotericin B, renal and biliary clearances were scaled among species using an exponent of 0.75 [ , ]. Docetaxel hepatic and intestinal clearances were scaled using as an allometric exponent of 0.67 [ ]. The use of an exponent of 0.67 or 1 has been proposed for scaling of the PS terms for “permeability-limited” tissues in the PBPK models [ , , ]. Determining species differences in clearance for compounds eliminated through metabolism can be challenging [ ]. In their analysis of published data for multiple compounds, Hu and colleagues suggested using an allometric exponent of 0.67 for clearance of compounds eliminated mainly by renal excretion, and 0.75 when substances are mostly eliminated by metabolism or by metabolism and excretion combined [ ]; and they further noticed that often the exponent values of 0.67 and 0.75 cannot be differentiated statistically. In this study, the allometric exponent for the clearance term was determined using noncompartmental analysis of plasma paclitaxel concentration–time profiles from four species; and the exponent estimated using the regression analysis (Fig. 4 ) was incorporated into the PBPK model for interspecies simulations. A range of predicted paclitaxel concentration–time profiles in human plasma and in rat plasma and tissues was generated and visually compared to observed data. In general, a reasonable prediction of paclitaxel pharmacokinetics was achieved (Figs. 5 , 6 a); however, the performance of each separate set of parameters was different. The parameters estimated from Shin et al. [ ] 20 mg/kg data set demonstrated the worst prediction performance. To further evaluate the effect of the allometric exponent on interspecies predictions a sensitivity analysis using a range of values of for the clearance term was performed; exponent values of 0.86 and 0.95 provided reasonable predictions of plasma paclitaxel profiles in humans (Fig. 6 b). It is proposed that the use of multiple values for allometric relationships to generate a range of predictions can be beneficial for enhancing the interspecies predictive performance of PBPK models. To further understanding the source of variability in plasma and tissue concentrations, an additional sensitivity analysis using a range of f u pl values in human was conducted; protein binding of 90% provided a better prediction of the plasma paclitaxel profiles in humans (Fig. 6 c).
Conclusion
In conclusion, a PBPK model for paclitaxel administered as Cremophor EL and ethanol formulation (Taxol ® ) was developed using mice data and provided reasonable prediction of paclitaxel pharmacokinetics in other species. Given the variability of the observed data especially in preclinical studies the use of multiple separate data sets for creating a range of predictions of drug pharmacokinetics in humans, rather than generating a single profile, appears to be a valuable approach for translational research. Formulation (Taxol ® )-dependent PBPK parameters has been determined and can be further utilized for development of novel formulations of paclitaxel. Future studies, that measure free, released, and formulation-associated drug concentrations in multiple tissues after administration of a range of dose levels are needed to fully resolve the complexities associated with paclitaxel pharmacokinetics.
