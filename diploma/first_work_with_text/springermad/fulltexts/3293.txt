INTRODUCTION
Cancer is the second leading cause of death worldwide ( , ), and chemotherapy remains to be an integral part of its treatment. However, chemotherapeutic drugs are highly cytotoxic, and encapsulating them into controlled release drug delivery systems (DDS) has many advantages. With the advancement in materials engineering, various controlled release DDS, in the form of a depot, hydrogels, liposomes, dendrimers, and particles, have been developed with the aim of improving treatment efficacy while reducing side effects ( , , ). In addition to a reduced exposure of cytotoxic drugs to healthy tissues, controlled release DDS are also shown to improve the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of drugs ( ). For example, particulate DDS can be fabricated to encapsulate hydrophobic and/or hydrophilic drugs and designed to elicit controlled release capabilities ( , , ). Design parameters such as particle size, configuration, and surface properties can be manipulated to achieve prolonged release and tuned to achieve a variety of release profiles that best suit to the therapeutic requirement ( ). From the various polymers investigated, the FDA-approved biodegradable polyesters in poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and polycaprolactone (PCL) are the most promising ones, whereby several marketed products made from these polymers are already commercially available ( , ).
The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway is a master regulator of cell growth and metabolism ( ). In multiple tumor types, mTOR signaling is constitutively activated, and its downstream signaling network contains numerous tumor suppressor genes ( ). Rapamycin, the inhibitor of mTOR, was thus shown to be a promising anticancer agent that also functions as an immunosuppressive agent. It binds to FK binding protein 12 (FKBP12) to form the Rapa-FKBP12 complex. This complex subsequently binds to mTOR, inhibiting DNA and protein synthesis and arresting cell cycle progression ( ). As such, rapamycin appears to inhibit tumor growth by halting tumor cell proliferation and suppressing angiogenesis ( ). Its derivatives such as everolimus and temsirolimus are also widely investigated for breast, kidney, and pancreatic cancer treatment ( , , , , , ).
One setback of rapamycin, however, is its highly hydrophobic nature ( , ). Rapamycin is merely soluble in water up to 2.6 μg/ml ( ) and has a bioavailability of only 14% to 27% depending on the administration route ( ). The physicochemical property of this otherwise potent drug makes it a challenge to deliver via the conventional administration route of oral or injection ( ). Furthermore, rapamycin is known to degrade in an aqueous environment ( , ). Its degradation accompanies the opening of its macrolide structure, which could alter the binding sites therefore losing its activity ( , , ). Encapsulation may therefore not only overcome the solubility limit of rapamycin but also provide a means to control and sustain its release ( , ), thus maintaining the minimum dosage required for adequate therapy ( ). Another advantage of encapsulation is to entrap water-sensitive drugs within a hydrophobic polymer matrix to limit their exposure to the aqueous environment. A well-designed DDS for rapamycin is therefore desirable, whereby the carrier can overcome its low solubility and instability, while enhancing its efficacy ( ).
With this in mind, several attempts to deliver rapamycin using particles have thus been reported. For example, solid-lipid microparticles (MP), acetalated dextran MP, and elastin-like polypeptides fused with FK506 binding protein were recently developed for encapsulating and delivering rapamycin ( , , ). These carriers increased the solubility limit of rapamycin and demonstrated good potential for use in autoimmune diseases. Jhunjhunwala et al . reported on the sustained delivery of rapamycin via 3.4-μm PLGA MP to dendritic cells ( ). Years later, the same group delivered rapamycin using a different PLGA MP formulation together with other proteins for induction of regulatory T cells ( ). Both formulations showed successful therapeutic effect in T cells for 4 days. However, the stability of rapamycin delivered through these delivery systems was never explored nor discussed extensively. Despite the known instability of rapamycin, the literature rarely reports on the functionality of rapamycin after its release. For a highly unstable drug like rapamycin, it is therefore essential to know whether the encapsulated drug is kept intact over the delivery period, and if not, to propose strategies to maintain its bioactivity. This is especially so when in vitro experiments are translated to more complex in vivo studies, where the preservation of unstable drugs becomes critical in clinical applications ( ).
In this paper, the aims are to develop DDS formulations that allow for sustained delivery of bioactive rapamycin and to evaluate the effect of these formulations on cancer and immunological cell lines. First, the instability of rapamycin in Dulbecco’s phosphate buffer saline (DPBS) was established. Subsequently, rapamycin was encapsulated into FDA-approved biodegradable polymeric particles of different formulations (using a single or two polymers) and their release profiles were investigated. Lastly, the bioactivity of released rapamycin was evaluated against a breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) and human lymphocyte cells (Jurkat) for evaluation of its anticancer and immunosuppressive properties. Comparison of the release profile and cell response was accessed for future translational studies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
PLGA 50:50 (MW 11 kDa, MW 10 kDa, MW 7–17 kDa acid terminated), PCL (MW 10 kDa), and PVA (MW 30–70 kDa) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Singapore). PLGA 50:50 (MW 153 kDa, intrinsic viscosity (IV) 1.03) was obtained from Purac Biomaterials. Rapamycin from Streptomyces hygroscopicus was obtained from Apollo Scientific (UK). HPLC column BC-Poroshell 120 (EC-C18, 4.6 × 100 mm, 2.7 μm) was obtained from Agilent (Singapore). High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade methanol (MEOH), dichloromethane (DCM), and acetonitrile were from Tedia (USA). DPBS of pH 7.4 was obtained from Life Technology (Singapore). Purified water was obtained from Milli-Q deionized H 2 O (Biocel Ltd.). All items were used as received.
Particle Fabrication
Particle fabrication was based on oil-in-water emulsion solvent evaporation method ( , ). Four different MW of PLGA were used to fabricate PLGA monolayer particles, which were labeled as PLGA-HMW (MW 153 kDa), PLGA (MW 11 kDa), PLGA-LMW (MW 10 kDa), and PLGA-acid (7–17 kDa, acid terminated); 0.3 g of PLGA polymer stated above was dissolved with rapamycin (1.33% w / w ) in DCM (3 ml for PLGA, PLGA-LMW, PLGA-Acid; 5 ml for PLGA-HMW) homogenously, and then the polymer solution was poured into a deionized (DI) water with PVA (0.5% w / v ) and emulsified at 400 rpm (2000 rpm for PLGA-HMW) using an overhead stirrer (Calframo BDC1850-220) at ambient temperature for 3 h. After DCM has completely evaporated, the as-formed particles were collected and washed with DI water. Sampled particles were lyophilized and stored in a freezer; 0.3 g of PCL polymer was used in the preparation of particles through the same fabrication procedure with rapamycin (1.33% w / w ) as above. Mixtures of PCL and PLGA-HMW at 1:2 ( w / w ) and 1:1 ( w / w ) ratios were dissolved in DCM (3 ml) to fabricate PCL/PLGA21 and PCL/PLGA11 double-layered particles as per procedure stated above. Drug loading percentage of all samples was kept the same.
Particle Characterization
Particles were imaged under the JEOL JSM-6360A scanning electron microscope (5 kV) for surface morphology and cross section. The particles were first mounted onto a carbon tape and then rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen for 60 s. Subsequently, particles were cut with a razor blade and air dried at room temperature. The dried particles were mounted onto metal stubs and coated with gold using a sputter coater (SPI-module model) for imaging. Consistent morphology was observed across each analysis, and only the representative SEM images are shown here. The particle size (diameter) was measured from SEM images using the ImageJ software. At least two independent batches for each type of particle were imaged as per procedure above. For each batch, over 30–50 particles were randomly chosen for diameter measurement. Such measurement was replicated at least two times for each batch.
Encapsulation efficiency (EE) is the ratio percentage between the masses of drug encapsulated and the total amount of drug added. It was calculated by dividing the actual drug loading with theoretical drug loading (see formula below). Approximately 5 mg of particles was weighed and dissolved in 1 ml of DCM; 5 ml methanol was then added to precipitate out the polymer. Polymer precipitates were centrifuged and the supernatant was drawn for HPLC analysis. Drug concentration was analyzed by Agilent 1100 HPLC system with Agilent Poroshell 120 column. The mobile phase was 80% methanol and 20% water with a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min. Column temperature was 35°C, and the retention time for rapamycin was 6.8–7.2 min. Concentrations of rapamycin were measured at 278 nm. All measurements were taken in triplicates. $$ \begin{array}{l}\mathrm{Encapsulationefficiency}\left(\mathrm{EE}\%\right)=\frac{\mathrm{Actual}\;\mathrm{drug}\;\mathrm{loading}}{\mathrm{Theoretical}\;\mathrm{drug}\;\mathrm{loading}}\times 100\%\hfill \\ {}\frac{\mathrm{Amount}\;\mathrm{of}\;\mathrm{encapsulated}\;\mathrm{drug}\ }{\mathrm{Weight}\;\mathrm{of}\;\mathrm{particles}-\mathrm{Amount}\;\mathrm{of}\;\mathrm{encapsulated}\;\mathrm{drug}}\div \frac{\mathrm{Amount}\;\mathrm{of}\;\mathrm{total}\;\mathrm{drug}}{\mathrm{weight}\;\mathrm{of}\;\mathrm{total}\;\mathrm{polymer}}\times 100\%\hfill \end{array} $$
In Vitro Drug Release Study
Four milligrams of particles was weighed and dispersed in a release medium (10 ml DPBS buffer). All samples were maintained in a 37°C shaking incubator at a speed of 80 rpm (orbital shaker incubator, model: LM-570RD). Under sink condition, release medium was collected daily up to 30 days or at the end of the release, whichever was earlier. Drug in the collected release medium was extracted with 1.5 ml DCM. DCM was fully evaporated under vacuum condition, and the extracted drug was redissolved into 1 ml methanol and vialed for HPLC. Rapamycin content was analyzed by HPLC. Degraded rapamycin elutes at 3.9 and 4.6 min, and only intact rapamycin was quantified. All measurements were done in triplicate.
For drug degradation studies, rapamycin was dissolved in DPBS buffer with 5% DMSO (solubilizing agent) at seven concentrations and kept at 37°C, protected from light. Samples were drawn at 0, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h and measured directly by HPLC to determine the amount of nondegraded rapamycin. Calibration curve was performed using the same medium, and all measurements were done in triplicate.
Cell Assays
Effect of Rapamycin-Loaded Particles on MCF-7 Cell Proliferation
The human breast adenocarcinoma cell line MCF-7 was a gift from Biomedical Sciences Institutes of Agency for Science, Technology and Research. MCF-7 cells were seeded at 100–150 cells/ml in 96-well plates in Dulbecco’s minimum essential medium (DMEM) (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (PAA Laboratory), 2 mM l -glutamine (Gibco), and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco). After a 24-h incubation within a 5% CO 2 incubator at 37°C to allow cell attachment, cells were incubated together with rapamycin-loaded particles (equivalent to 100-nM dose) constituted in PBS for 96 h. Prereleasing particles were added to cells at days 0, 4, 12, 19, and 23, with at least four replicates at each time point. Subsequently, the cells were subjected to the WST-8 assay ( ), to quantify the proportion of cells that remained viable after transient exposure to rapamycin-loaded particles.
The WST-8 assay for cell viability was carried out with the cell counting kit solution (CCK-8) from Dojindo Molecular Laboratories Inc. (Kumamoto, Japan). The CCK-8 kit utilizes the water-soluble tetrazolium salt WST-8 (2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, monosodium salt) in measuring NADH production, resulting from the dehydrogenase activity of viable cells. The subsequent reduction of WST-8 by viable cells produces an orange-colored formazan product with an absorbance at 450 nm; 1 ml of CCK-8 solution and 9 ml clear DMEM (PAA Laboratory) were mixed and added to each well at 100 μl/well. No washing was carried out to avoid damage or loss of cells. After incubation for 1 h at 37°C in a 5% CO 2 incubator, absorbance readings were measured spectrophotometrically at 450 nm using an Infinite 200TM microplate reader (Tecan Inc., Maennedorf, Switzerland). Due to the limited cell proliferation space in the plate, the incubation time could not exceed 4 days. Thus, the study was adjusted to have multiple time points of particles at different phases of release.
MPs were incubated 4 days with fixed amount of cells. CCK-8 reading was taken at the beginning (D0) and end of incubation (D4), and the difference is calculated as cell proliferation result ( i.e. , D4 − D0). Cell incubated with MPs ( i.e. , D4 R − D0 R ) proliferated less than the cell in the blank medium ( i.e. , D4 NC − D0 NC ); thus, the difference was calculated as the effect of inhibition. To aid the comparison, all values were normalized with the cell in the blank medium (D4 NC − D0 NC ). When it is above 0%, the inhibitory effect of released rapamycin is proven.
The formulation effect of inhibition on MCF-7 cell proliferation is as follows: $$ \begin{array}{l}\frac{\left(\mathrm{D}{4}_{\mathrm{NC}}-\mathrm{D}{0}_{\mathrm{NC}}\right)-\left(\mathrm{D}{4}_{\mathrm{R}}-\mathrm{D}{0}_{\mathrm{R}}\right)}{\mathrm{D}{4}_{\mathrm{NC}}-\mathrm{D}{0}_{\mathrm{NC}}}\times 100\%=\hfill \\ {}100\%-\frac{\mathrm{D}{4}_{\mathrm{R}}-\mathrm{D}{0}_{\mathrm{R}}}{\mathrm{D}{4}_{\mathrm{NC}}-\mathrm{D}{0}_{\mathrm{NC}}}\%\hfill \end{array} $$
Long-Term Effect of Rapamycin-Loaded Particles on Jurkat Cell Proliferation
The Jurkat cell was a kind gift from Prof. Su I-Chin (School of Biological Science, Nanyang Technological University). It was cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1650 medium (Biowest) supplemented with 0.3 g/l l -glutamine, 5% fetal bovine serum (Gibco), and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Hyclone) at 37°C and humidified with 5% CO 2 . Jurkat cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 10 5 cells/ml and were incubated with either free rapamycin or rapamycin MP (1.5 or 3 nM) to compare the inhibition efficacy. Untreated Jurkat cells and blank MP were used as healthy controls. Two separate time-point experiments of different durations, 14 days (cell added on day 0) and 20 days (cells added on day 10), were carried out and cell viability was assessed via two methods: (1) trypan blue (Sigma-Aldrich) exclusion assay whereby viable cells are counted in a hemocytometer and (2) cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8; Dojindo) in which 100 μl of cell suspension from each condition was transferred into a 96-well plate and supplemented with 10 μl of CCK solution. After 3-h incubation in the dark at 37°C, absorbance was measured at 450 nm on a microplate reader (BiotTek, Synergy H1). Duplicate wells were done for each experiment and the experiment was repeated three times.
Statistical Analysis
Results were presented as means ± SD for three separate experiments. For comparison across groups, data were analyzed by Student’s t test using GraphPad. Differences between groups were considered to be statistically significant at P < 0.05.
RESULTS
Rapamycin Release from MP Formulations
Rapamycin was encapsulated into seven different MP formulations using an emulsion evaporation method with EEs close to 100% (Table I ). These values were higher than those reported in the literature, which is consistent with the hydrophobic nature of rapamycin that allows strong interactions with the hydrophobic polymer ( , , , , ). All formulations fabricated had similar loading values of rapamycin (1.3% w / w by HPLC) and particle diameter (100 μm on average). The SEM images (Fig. 1 ) showed that the MPs had smooth surface morphology, and cross-sectional images revealed a monolayered structure for single polymer MP and a double-layered structure for MP composed of two polymers. For the latter, PCL/PLGA21 MP (Fig. 1f ) revealed a thicker shell than PCL/PLGA11 MP (Fig. 1g ), when the weight ratio of PCL increased from 50 to 66.7%. This suggests that PCL (Fig. 1g ) formed the shell, which is consistent with what had been previously reported ( ). It is noteworthy that, unlike the other formulations, PCL MP (single polymer) presented a porous structure with numerous 1–2-nm size pores (Fig. 1e ) that were randomly distributed throughout the particle.

Pure polymer yielded a single-layer structure, while a blend of polymer resulted in a double-layer structure
The effect of polymer type on rapamycin release was investigated (Fig. 2a ). PLGA and PCL, though possessing similar MW (Table I ), displayed distinctively different release profiles. PCL MP showed a diffusion-controlled release profile ( \( y=0.7176\sqrt{t}+1.270,\ {R}^2=0.97 \) ), with a gradual increase of cumulative release until it reached a plateau. On the other hand, a delayed release was observed for PLGA MP until day 10 that reached a plateau at 25 days—a typical degradation-controlled profile ( , ). The difference in PLGA and PCL release profiles could be explained from the porous morphology of the PCL microparticle and its lower glass transition ( T g ) temperature of PCL as compared to PLGA. At the release temperature, the amorphous polymer chains of PCL are more flexible, and this promotes drug release. Fig. 2 Cumulative release of rapamycin from microparticle PLGA-HMW ( gray square ), PLGA ( blue square ), PLGA-LMW ( white square ), PLGA-Acid ( green diamond ), PCL ( black triangle ), PCL/PLGA21 ( white triangle ), and PCL/PLGA11 ( gray hexagon ). To aid the comparison, all release profiles were grouped into a degradation-controlled release, b effect of polymer MW and end-cap group, and c effect of polymer blend (means ± SD, n = 3)
The effect of PLGA polymer MW and end group on rapamycin release is shown in Fig. 2b . A negligible amount of rapamycin was released from PLGA-HMW MP, whose MW was the highest among all the PLGA used in this study. This was because for degradation-controlled releasing polymers, significant polymer degradation has to precede drug release. Degradation of PLGA-HMW occurs only at a much later stage and no release was thus observed during the 30 days ( ). The different onset of rapamycin release between PLGA-LMW (Fig. 2b ) and PLGA (Fig. 2a ) can therefore be explained from its MW difference. Rapamycin release was also significantly altered when different end groups were present in the polymer, i.e. , PLGA-Acid (Fig. 2b ). Based on polymer end groups, PLGA-LMW (ester terminated) was observed to have a slower release compared to PLGA-Acid (acid terminated), even though the former had a lower MW value (Table I ). Release rates are therefore also dependent on the end groups in PLGA polymer. The higher amount of release was due to the high water uptake for the relatively more hydrophilic acid end-capped polymers that promotes drug diffusion. In addition, polymers with acidic end groups accelerate degradation via autocatalysis.
It has been reported that double-layered particles reduce burst release and promotes sustained delivery ( ). Here, the effect of double-layered MP on rapamycin release was also investigated. PCL and PLGA polymers were blended at ratios of 1:1 (PCL/PLGA11) and 2:1 (PCL/PLGA21), and both formulations showed a release rate that falls between that of pure PCL (rapid release) and pure PLGA-HMW (negligible release). The formulation with a higher PCL content (PCL/PLGA21) displayed a relatively more rapid release rate (Fig. 2c ). Blending PCL with PLGA slightly accelerated the release as compared to pure PLGA.
MP Formulations Preserve Bioactivity of Rapamycin
The degradation rate of free rapamycin under in vitro conditions was investigated (Fig. 3a ). Rapamycin of varying concentrations (1.0–25 μg/ml) was exposed to DPBS solutions over 72 h. At low solution concentration (1 μg/ml), free rapamycin was no longer detectable after 24 h. Higher concentrations (≥4 μg/ml) showed that ∼70% of rapamycin was degraded after 24 h. At 48 h, only 10% of rapamycin remained intact and was fully degraded by 72 h. The degradation peak from HPLC chromatographs confirmed rapamycin degradation (Fig. S2A ). The corresponding degradation rate constants were calculated from the trend line (Fig. S1 ), whereby all four concentrations had an average value of 55.4 ± 1.7 μg/(μl h). Fig. 3 Degradation of rapamycin in aqueous condition and MP. a Degradation of free rapamycin at seven concentrations (25 to 1 μg/ml) over 72 h (means ± SD, n = 3). After 72 h, all free rapamycin were fully degraded. b Amount of intact rapamycin inside all formulation MP after 72 h. All formulation showed that >70% intact rapamycin remained inside each MP. c Measured amount of intact rapamycin encapsulated in PLGA-HMW over 30 days at the same condition of the release study
The amount of intact rapamycin that was released from the MP formulations at 72 h was thus monitored (Fig. 3b ). PLGA-HMW MP displayed the best results whereby 100% of the encapsulated rapamycin remained intact. PLGA-Acid MP had the second highest amount of intact rapamycin (80.40%). If the amount of released rapamycin was taken into account, this value would have increased to 91.5%. PCL MP preserved only 64.1% of rapamycin, probably due to the highly porous structure of PCL MP. Nevertheless, contrary to free un-encapsulated rapamycin (Fig. 3b ), rapamycin encapsulated in MP was well preserved in all seven formulations.
The PLGA-HMW MP formulation was subsequently selected to understand the stability of encapsulated rapamycin over a month period, without any interference of rapamycin release. The amount of intact rapamycin in PLGA-HMW MP (Fig. 3c ) remained close to 100% for up to 30 days, with the residue amount of rapamycin at approximately 95%. This suggests that encapsulating rapamycin into delivery systems, such as MP, could preserve its bioactivity. This result was further confirmed as the degraded rapamycin peak was also not observed in HPLC when analyzing for residue rapamycin (Fig. S2D ).
Inhibition Efficacy of Released Rapamycin on Cell Lines
When rapamycin degrades, it loses its binding site and therefore its ability to suppress cell proliferation. The inhibition efficacy of released rapamycin from MP on breast cancer cell MCF-7 proliferation was thus assessed (Fig. 4 ). PLGA MP showed extremely low inhibition effect (≤5%) on MCF-7 cells for the initial 15 days. This is in agreement with 0% rapamycin released till day 10 (Fig. 2a ). For a mid-term period ( i.e. , day 10 to day 16), the amount of released rapamycin from PLGA MP increased. Eventually, it reached a peak at day 23. Likewise, the inhibitory effect on MCF-7 cells increased substantially (36.71% on days 19–23), which is in good agreement with the in vitro release profile. The formulation PLGA-Acid MP (Fig. 4b ) showed the highest cell proliferation inhibition efficacy among all formulations. During the initial 15 days, the inhibition efficacy, on average, was as high as 30–40%. However, it fell in the mid-term to below 20%. Such a trend matched that of its in vitro release profile (Fig. 2b ). For PCL MP formulation, inhibition efficacy on MCF-7 cell was the highest (28.5%) at days 0–4, which subsequently decreased to about 4%, as predicted from its diffusion-controlled release profile (Fig. 2c ). All these results demonstrated a good correlation between rapamycin release and cell inhibition. The same experiment was conducted on other formulations (PLGA-LMW, PCL/PLGA11, and PCL/PLGA21), which yielded similar results (Fig. S3 ). The correlation of MP in vitro release profile and cellular response confirmed the bioactivity of released rapamycin. Fig. 4 Inhibition efficacy of rapamycin microparticle on breast cancer cell (MCF-7) proliferation over 30 days. a PLGA. b PLGA-Acid. c PCL. In vitro released amount of rapamycin at corresponding time point was plotted on the right y -axis (means ± SD, n = 4)
As PLGA-acid MP and PLGA MP showed the highest release profile among all formulations, they were selected to investigate their impact on Jurkat cell proliferation against an equivalent dosage of free rapamycin. The fold change of cell numbers based on metabolic activity was measured when incubating Jurkat cells with two MP at two dosages (1.5 and 3 nM). Cells incubated with blank MP displayed a similar proliferation as the healthy Jurkat cells (control) (Fig. 5 ), indicating no inhibitory effect at both dosages. In the first 5 days, free rapamycin reduced Jurkat cell growth at both 1.5 and 3 nM (Fig. 5a, b ). However, the fold change increased to 18.6 in the mid-term period of release and became similar to Jurkat cell’s fold change (20.9). This indicated that free rapamycin suppressed cell growth for only 5 days. At the 1.5- and 3-nM dosage, the fold change of both PLGA-Acid MP and PLGA MP was significantly lower in comparison to free rapamycin at all time points (Fig. 5 ). In addition, both formulations suppressed cell growth for 20 days, equivalent to four times the duration of free rapamycin. This clearly demonstrates that rapamycin sustained release from MP had high efficacy and longer duration in inhibiting Jurkat cell growth.

DISCUSSION
The multifunctional drug, rapamycin, has an increasing importance in the rapidly growing area of cancer research as it works synergistically with other chemotherapeutic drugs, such as doxorubicin or cyclophosphamide ( ). Rapamycin is water sensitive owing to the hydrolysis at the ester bond ( ). The degradation rate of rapamycin under DPBS conditions (Fig. 3a ), as reported for the first time here, revealed how rapidly rapamycin degrades when exposed to an aqueous medium. Encapsulating rapamycin into hydrophobic polymers as drug delivery carriers could therefore overcome the instability of rapamycin. Microparticle formulations also provide controlled and sustained release capabilities, in addition to protecting the drug. The results (Fig. 3b, c ) confirmed the ability of MP in preserving rapamycin. It was speculated that the shielding effect provided by the polymers restricts the interaction of rapamycin with the aqueous environment, thus prolonging the bioactivity of any water-unstable drugs, in this case rapamycin. At the same time, the major drawbacks of cancer treatment such as toxicity to healthy tissue and severe side effects can be potentially minimized with the help of biodegradable carriers that provide controlled and sustained release capabilities. It was demonstrated that rapamycin can be encapsulated using FDA-approved biopolymer PLGA and PCL at high loading efficiencies (Table I ), and a library of these formulations was developed with different release onset periods, rates, and profiles.
Different formulations showed different release profiles and kinetics, whereby pure PCL and PLGA formulations showed diffusion-controlled and degradation-controlled release mechanisms, respectively. By increasing the polymer MW, i.e. , PLGA-LMW and PLGA, the onset release of rapamycin can be delayed. This unique feature can be useful when a delayed release is required. For instance, APF530 is a delayed release formulation of granisetron, which showed better health-related quality of life (QOL) in terms of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting ( ). Alternatively, reducing particle size can accelerate release due to an increase in surface-to-volume ratio. However, reducing particle size may also lead to burst release; thus, this strategy should be applied carefully ( ). Polymer end groups also affect release rates, with the acid end groups displaying a more rapid release. Blending PCL with PLGA gave rise to double-layered MPs whereby a higher PCL content predictably gave faster release rates. Theoretically, it is therefore possible to customize the release onset, kinetics, and profile by varying the polymer MW, type, end groups, and MP composition.
Living cells provide immediate reaction to rapamycin that has been released from the MP. Two types of cell lines were selected to evaluate the bioactivity (as an immunosuppressant and as an anticancer drug) of released rapamycin. Blank MP showed no inhibition effect on MCF-7 cell (data not shown). In contrast, all rapamycin MP displayed various levels of inhibition efficacy that matches the rapamycin MP release profile, indicating the direct inhibition effect of rapamycin on MCF-7 cell proliferation. The incubation time of rapamycin MP with Jurkat cells was set to be long enough to determine the difference between the free drug and MP in cell growth experiments. Clearly, rapamycin MP was able to suppress cell growth for up to 20 days, equivalent to four times the duration of free drug (Fig. 5 ). Zhao et al . reported antiproliferative effects of rapamycin on Jurkat cells for up to 3 days of incubation duration ( ). Similarly, another study assessed the effect of rapamycin on T cells for up to 4 days ( ). Such durations may be too short for any clinical significance in arresting cell proliferation. On the contrary, the results shown here confirmed the long-acting effect of rapamycin through a MP formulation. MP not only protects the drug but also provides sustained cellular responses. MP therefore provides a means to tune the release of rapamycin while preserving the bioactivity of hydrolytically unstable drugs.
The application of rapamycin MP can be explored in various areas where a sustained release of rapamycin is desired. For example, the effect of free rapamycin in inhibiting breast cancer cell proliferation was evaluated at different dosages ( ). A low dosage of rapamycin significantly blocks breast cancer cell proliferation, whereas high dosages may be cytotoxic. Furthermore, the continuous fusion of rapamycin was shown to be more effective than a low bolus dosage ( ). The MP formulations developed here can be used to deliver rapamycin in a continuous manner and at lower dosages over a significantly longer duration than the free drug. Clinically, direct injection of rapamycin also has its difficulty, whereby the concoction for rapamycin injection often consists of polymer surfactant (carboxymethyl cellulose and/or polyethylene glycol), which makes the solution viscous and difficult to inject ( , , , ). Besides that, trace amounts of organic solvent cannot be avoided if the solution is prepared by diluting from a concentrated organic solution with rapamycin. With the appropriate MP formulation, rapamycin in its particulate form is much easier to inject and leaves no trace of organic solvent that could potentially harm tissues. With additional benefits of drug preservation, high encapsulation efficiency, and longer delivery duration, encapsulating rapamycin into MP is therefore a superior form of delivery.
CONCLUSION
Free drug rapamycin was shown to degrade rapidly under aqueous conditions; however, such degradation was minimized after encapsulation in MP. A library of original MP formulations was developed and shown to preserve and sustain the release of rapamycin for up to 30 days. Various approaches of modification demonstrated the ability to tune rapamycin release profile to fit different applications. Incubation of rapamycin MP with two different cell lines clearly confirmed the sustained release of rapamycin and improved efficiency compared to free drug. Thus, sustained delivery of rapamycin and its derivatives can potentially lead to improved treatment of renal cancer carcinoma, breast cancer, and progressive neuroendocrine tumors of pancreatic origin and also acts as an long-term immunosuppressive agent in autoimmune diseases and neurodegenerative diseases.
