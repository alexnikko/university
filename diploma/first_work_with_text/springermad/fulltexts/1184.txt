Introduction
Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is an autoimmune skin disease that affects elderly people the most. BP courses with subepidermal blisters that result from the production of autoantibodies directed against the hemidesmosomal proteins 230 kDa BP antigen-1 (also termed BPAG1, BP230, or dystonin) and 180 kDa BP antigen-2 (also termed BPAG2, BP180, or type collagen XVII) [ , , ].
Over the past two decades, the high prevalence of neurological disorders (NDs) in elderly patients presenting with BP disease has raised scientific concerns [ , ], especially regarding the association between BP and dementia [ , , , ]. Dementia affects the elderly the most often and encompasses Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia, mixed dementia, Lewy body disease, and front-temporal dementia [ ]. The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a role in neuronal genesis and survival and is critically important for modulation of the synaptic plasticity underlying learning and memory in the hippocampus. Low serum levels of the soluble peptide BDNF are reported in patients with ND, which highlights dementia [ , ]. The BDNF peptide has been associated with atopic dermatitis and urticaria but not with blistering diseases [ , , ].
A common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs6265, of the BDNF gene leads to substitution of valine (Val) for methionine (Met) at codon 66 (Val66Met). In turn, Val66Met SNP may be related with abnormal intracellular trafficking and irregular BDNF secretion, which may influence the human memory and the hippocampal function [ , , ].
The skin and the brain tissues share an ectoderm embryonic ancestry, which justifies the expression of isoforms in both tissues [ ]. The physiological expression of the neural isoforms of BP180 and BP230 proteins in the central nervous system (CNS) configures a possible antigenic mimicry of the BP180/BP230 isoforms expressed in the CNS and in skin tissues [ , , ].
The increased occurrence of outpatients with dementia-BP clinical association seen at our University dermatological care service has led us to hypothesize: as BP180 and BP230 peptides are also expressed in the central nervous system, tissue damage caused by a neurodegenerative disease would lead to the exposure of the BP180/BP230 brain isoforms to the immune system, which would recognize them as non-self and trigger the production of autoantibodies. Finally, these autoantibodies would recognize the cutaneous isoforms BP180/BP230, triggering the clinical manifestation of PB in predisposed individuals. For this purpose, we determined a correlation among the clinical data and analyzed the results of the anti-BP180 and of the anti-BP230 assays in patients with BP and compared these results to the results obtained for patients with dementia and for elderly controls. In addition, as the BDNF is altered in the pathogenesis of dementia been a predictor biomarked of it, we conducted the serum peptide BDNF measurements and the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism in these three groups.
Methods
Subjects and clinical assessment
The local Research Ethics Committee approved this study (CAAE: 45779715.5.0000.5440—June/2017). All the participants provided the informed consent. Fifty elderly patients with BP, 50 elderly patients with dementia, and 50 elderly controls followed up at the University Hospital of the Ribeirão Preto Medical School of the University of São Paulo composed the three clinical groups analyzed in this comparative study (Table 1 ). The BP group consisted of a well-characterized group of patients with tense bullous and histological subepidermal blistering as well as confirmatory direct/indirect immunofluorescence demonstrated by IgG and/or C3 linear deposits at the basal membrane zone (BMZ). The dementia group comprised elderly patients assessed according to the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) [ ]. The clinical forms of dementia were characterized as dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease ( n = 22) and as mixed dementia ( n = 28). The elderly control group comprised patients that were being followed up at the ophthalmology outpatient clinic. The controls did not present any neurological disorders as assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) [ ]. The patients belonging to the dementia and to the control groups did not have any autoimmune diseases and were not using corticosteroids or immunosuppressant drugs.

Sample preparation
Ten milliliters of peripheral venous blood was collected into clot activator tubes for immediate serum separation by centrifugation; the serum was frozen at − 80 °C until the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed. For the genetic analysis, 10 mL of peripheral venous blood was placed inside tubes containing EDTA. Genomic DNA was extracted by means of the Salting-out method [ ], and the extracted DNA was quantified on a spectrophotometer (NanoVue, GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK).
Detection of IgG antibodies against BP180 and BP230 in serum samples by ELISA
The serum samples obtained from 50 patients with BP, from 50 patients with dementia, and from 50 elderly controls were screened with an ELISA kit to detect specific IgG antibodies against the BP180 and the BP230 domains (MESACUP BP180 and BP230 ELISA Kits, MBL®, Nagoya, Japan). The manufacturer’s instructions were followed (cutoff = 9 U/mL).
Measurement of BDNF levels in serum samples by ELISA
The BDNF levels were measured in the serum samples obtained from 50 patients with BP, from 50 patients with dementia, and from 50 elderly controls by using the Human BDNF Quantikine ELISA kit (R&D system®, Germany), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Indirect immunofluorescence salt-split-skin method
The salt-split-skin (SSS) method was used to separate the epidermis from the dermis. The normal human skin samples were incubated with NaCl 1 M at 4 °C for 48 h [ ]. Then, the circulating autoantibodies specific for proteins of the BMZ were detected by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF); the serum samples diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (serum sample/PBS ratio = 1:10) were incubated in salt-split-skin slices at 37 °C for 1 h, which was followed by incubation with the fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated IgG secondary antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, USA) at 37 °C for 1 h. With the aid of a Zeiss fluorescence microscope (West Germany), the slides were examined and photographed immediately after the end of the experiment.
Genotyping
Twenty-five patients with BP, 50 patients with dementia, and 201 elderly controls followed up at the University Hospital of the Ribeirão Preto Medical School of the University of São Paulo were genotyped. The NCBI database dbSNP rs6265 (Val66Met) located in exon 5 of the BDNF gene and characterized by G to A transition was amplified by PCR using 5′-TGATGACCATCCTTTCCTT-3′ and 5′ CACTGGGAGTTCCAATGC-3′ pair of primers. Each reaction was conducted with 100 ng of genomic DNA, 0.5 μM of each oligonucleotide primer, 2 μL of buffer 10× PCR, dNTP 0.25 mM, MgCl 2 1.9 mM, 2.5 units of taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA), and enough Milli-Q water to achieve a total reaction volume of 20 μL. The amplification protocol consisted of a denaturation step at 95 °C for 5 min, which was followed by a denaturation cycle at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 57 °C for 1 min, extension at 72 °C for 1 min (repeated 30 times), and one final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. The genotyping was carried out by the unidirectional direct sequencing method (3500 Genetic Analyzer, Applied Biosystems, USA), which was preceded by purification of the PCR product with the enzyme ExoSAP-IT®.
Data analysis
The Kruskal-Wallis test followed by the Dunn test was used for the continuous variables with non-parametric distribution, as appropriate. Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient was used to test the ELISA values. The distributions of categorical variables between the groups were analyzed by the chi-square test. The data are presented as the median (minimum and maximum), and the level of significance was set at ∝ = 5%. The statistical analyses were accomplished with the software GraphPad Prism version 7.00 for Mac Os X.
Allelic and genotypic frequencies for the rs6265 (Val66Met) polymorphism of the BDNF gene were estimated by direct counting, and the comparison of allele frequency distributions was performed by Fisher’s exact test. In addition, were determined the genic and genotypic differentiation and the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) adherence. All these analyses were performed using Genepop on the Web software [ , ]. The level of significance was considered when p ≤ 0.05.
Two pattern recognition strategies were employed for associate the profiles of BP, dementia, and control groups: (i) heatmap hierarchical clustering, to classify biological predictors (ELISA anti-BP180, ELISA anti-BP230, and BDNF peptide quantification), and (ii) data mining decision tree analysis, to classify biological predictors such as demographic (age, gender, and skin color), serological (ELISA anti-BP180, ELISA anti-BP230, and BDNF) and molecular ( BDNF Val66Met polymorphism) data. The classifier J48 algorithm was used to produce a single decision tree to describe the clinical groups [ , ]. The leave-one-out approach was used for validation.
Results
In the BP group, 13 (26%) of the 50 patients were diagnosed with ND prior to BP. Dementia (16%) was the most frequent ND, followed by stroke (6%) and epilepsy (4%). Of eight patients with dementia-BP clinical association, five presented vascular dementia, and three had Alzheimer’s disease.
Comparing the frequency of patients with anti-BP180 or with anti-BP230 values above the cutoff, there was no statistical difference between the BP patients without ND, the BP patients with dementia, and the BP patients with another ND ( P = 0.1281 and P = 0.0808, respectively) (data not shown). Anti-BP180 values above the cutoff were seen in five (10%) of the 50 patients belonging to the dementia group. As for anti-BP230, values above the cutoff were seen in other five (10%) patients belonging to the dementia group. The BP patients’ data who presented positive anti-BP180 or anti-BP230 autoantibodies are summarized in supplemental Table S1 . Regarding the 50 controls, seven (14%) and one (2%) of them presented anti-BP180 or both anti-BP180 and anti-BP230, respectively. There was no statistical difference between the dementia and the control groups (Table 2 ) .

The IIF-SSS assays showed a BP pattern with IgG fluorescence in the epidermal side of the cleavage in the sera of two (one patient presented dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease; the other had mixed dementia) of the ten dementia patients that presented anti-BP180 or anti-BP230 values above the cutoff (Fig. 1 ). However, the IIF-SSS assays did not show the BP pattern in any of the seven control sera.

In the ELISA test, the BDNF peptide values differed among the three studied groups ( P < 0.0001). The BP group presented the lowest BDNF values (16.88 pg/mL), followed by the dementia group (25.41 pg/mL) and the elderly control group (38.21 pg/mL) ( P < 0.0001 for both) (Fig. 2 a). Comparison between the patients with mixed dementia and the patients with dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease revealed similar BDNF values (22.43 pg/mL and 26.40 pg/mL, respectively; P = 0.1041). On the basis of the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) classification, the BDNF values were lower in the CDR3 (23.37 pg/mL) than in the CDR1 dementia subgroup (30.17 pg/mL) ( P = 0.0002) (Fig. 2 b). The BDNF values were similar in the patients with BP-dementia association (9.1 pg/mL) as compared to the patients with BP but without ND (17.15 pg/mL) ( P = 0.0588) (Fig. 2 c), but lower as compared to the CDR1 ( P < 0.0001), the CDR2 ( P < 0.0001), and the CDR3 ( P < 0.05) dementia subgroups.

There was a negative correlation of the anti-BP180 and the anti-BP230 values with the BDNF values when the three groups were coupled (BP plus dementia plus control groups) ( r = − 0.4066, P < 0.0001 and r = − 0.3514, P < 0.0001, respectively) but none for the isolated BP group ( r = − 0.0547, P = 0.7057 and r = − 0.1529, P = 0.2891, respectively) (data not shown). Moreover, the BP treatment did not affect the BDNF values ( P = 0.8960) (data not shown).
Table 3 summarizes the allelic and the genotypic frequencies of the rs6265 (Val66Met) polymorphism of the BDNF gene frequencies in the three studied groups. The Val allele and Val/Val genotype were the more frequent, and the distributions of alleles and genotypes were similar in the three groups.

The three studied populations presented values within the proportions expected by the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (Table 3 ). The global genotypic differentiation test presented a chi-square ( χ 2 ) value of 0.8185 ( P = 0.6642). Fisher’s exact test did not reveal statistical differences among the three population groups when their alleles ( P = 0.6333) and genotypes ( P = 0.6641) were compared (Table 3 ).
We used the anti-BP180 and the anti-BP230 autoantibodies as well as the BDNF ELISA results to construct a heatmap hierarchical clustering to evaluate the segregation pattern of the three groups (Fig. 3 ). This analysis showed that the serological values were able to discriminate the three groups. In the left cluster (in pink color), the vast majority of the BP patients were clustered because they presented the highest serum anti-BP180 and anti-BP230 levels and the lowest BDNF values. The elderly controls were in the opposite side of the heatmap, whereas the dementia patients exhibited an intermediate pattern between the patterns of the BP patients and the elderly controls. Fig. 3 Heatmap hierarchical clustering profile between the serological results of three clinical groups: Bullous pemphigoid (BP) group, dementia group, and elderly controls. Stronger relationships between the variables are indicated by shorter distances in the dendrograms. The Color Key graduation represents the variation of the sample based on the quantitative results. Regulation: white blue color (down) and dark blue color (up)
According to the parameters that were pre-established in the data mining methodology, the algorithm J48 generated a decision tree whose ROC curve provided an AUC of 0.84, f-measure of 0.79, and general assertiveness of 79.2% (Fig. 4 ) and demonstrated that the variables gender, skin color, and ELISA anti-BP230 titles were not relevant to classify the groups. Among the other variables, ELISA BDNF quantification proved to be the most determinant for the classification of the three studied groups, defining the first plan. In a second plan, the classifier took account of the variables anti-BP180 values and BDNF values to open a new branch. In the third plan, the genotypic and the age data were considered, which produced sufficient information gain to begin the proper classification of the groups. Fig. 4 Data mining decision tree analysis was carried out to generate algorithms (root and branch attributes) to classify dementia patients (DEM) and elderly controls (CONT) as well as bullous pemphigoid patients with dementia (BP + DEM), BP patients without ND (BP-ND), and BP patients with another ND (BP + ND) into a probability of distribution over the groups
Discussion
Dementia has been the most frequent ND associated with BP disease [ , , ]. A Chinese study reported ND in 1752 (50.3%) of 3485 BP patients; dementia was the most prevalent, followed by epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, and stroke [ ]. A French study described ND in 84 (47.2%) of 178 BP patients; dementia was diagnosed in 43 (24.2%) patients [ ].
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that data mining decision tree and heatmap analysis have been employed in a dementia-BP clinical association study, which implies a lack of published studies to compare with our results. In the same way, this is the first study to perform the BP180/BP230 ELISA and IIF technique in patients with dementia.
As expected, the BP group presented the highest serum anti-BP180 and anti-BP230 values as compared to the dementia group and to the elderly control group. This result was better demonstrated in the clustering analysis, which grouped the BP patients and displayed an intertwined distribution pattern, which suggested that some dementia patients and controls were closer to the BP cluster. This is confirmed by the ELISA results which demonstrated that 10% ( n = 5) of the dementia patients presented anti-BP180 values above the cutoff, 10% ( n = 5) of the dementia patients presented anti-BP230 values above the cutoff, and 14% of the controls presented anti-BP180 or anti-BP230 values above the cutoff value.
In dementia group, the two patients who presented anti-BP180/anti-BP230 values above the cutoff point in ELISA probably had pathogenic circulating autoantibodies, since IIF-SSS exhibited a fluorescence patter compatible with BP features. Until the moment of the sera collecting of these two patients, they had no clinical signs of BP. However, dementia patients presenting serum positivity for anti-BP180/230 antibodies or BP pattern on IIF-SSS could be a population at risk for BP disease. The fact that the sera from elderly controls which presented anti-BP180/anti-BP230 positivity did not recognize any BMZ structure in IIF-SSS suggests that these autoantibodies are not pathogenic as in the dementia group.
The role of the transmembrane protein BP180 and of the intracellular protein BP230 in the CNS has already been described. BP180 is related to plasticity and stabilization synaptics in the CNS, whereas BP230 helps to maintain the neural cell, promotes the anchoring of the filaments and signals the proteins that control cytoskeletal changes [ , ].
The production of 10% ( n = 5) for both anti-BP180 autoantibodies and anti-BP230 autoantibodies in dementia patients allied to the fact that two of these serum samples presented a BP pattern upon IIF, i.e., they have recognized skin basement molecules, deserves our attention. The expression of BP180 and BP230 hemidesmosomal molecules in both the CNS and the skin [ , , ] and the association of BP following ND diagnosis, especially dementia [ , , , ], led us to study a possible antigenic cross-reactivity between the BP180 and the BP230 brain and skin isoforms. At first, the patient with dementia would expose the BP180 and the BP230 brain isoforms to the immunological system as non-self-peptides, which would recognize the BP180 and the BP230 skin isoforms thereafter, triggering the BP disease in genetically predisposed individuals and contributing to the clinical manifestation of BP. To demonstrate this hypothesis, ELISA tests with specific BP180 and BP230 brain isoforms will be necessary.
Decreased concentration of serological levels of BDNF, a neurotrophin underlying neuronal genesis and survival, has been associated with ND, especially dementia [ , ]. In the dementia group, the patients with mixed dementia and the patients with dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease did not differ in terms of the serum BDNF values, so the BDNF biomarker was not able to distinguish between the clinical forms of dementia in our study. Nevertheless, the lowest serum values in the CDR3 dementia subgroup suggested that BDNF may be associated with the pathogenesis of dementia and may be used as a biomarker for dementia clinical staging.
Considering that BP patients with dementia presented lower BDNF values as compared to BP patients without ND and to patients belonging to the CDR3 dementia subgroup, some immunological event following CNS damage associated with dementia could be suggested. Here, we demonstrated a negative correlation between anti-BP180 and anti-BP230 with the BDNF values when the three groups were joined. However, when the values for the isolated BP group were considered, there was no correlation. The relationship of the functions of the BP180 and the BP230 molecules with the functions of the BDNF peptide in the CNS needs to be clarified, in order to explain the dementia-BP association better. Due to negative correlation among anti-BP180 and anti-BP230 autoantibody levels with BDNF values joining the three groups, it would be thought in a possible relationship between BP (presence of high autoantibodies against BP180/230) and dementia (low values of BDNF). Nevertheless, new studies with larger sample sizes are desired in order to explain these results.
Regarding the rs6265 (Val66Met) polymorphism of the BDNF gene, the allelic and the genotypic profiles were not associated with dementia or with BP. This is the first study that has investigated the association of this polymorphism with the BP disease, so there are no literature data to compare with our findings. Considering the elderly controls, the distribution of the BDNF Val66Met genotypic profile—75.6% Val/Val (G/G), 21.4% Met/Val (G/A), and 3% Met/Met (A/A)—was similar to the distribution of the BDNF Val66Met genotypic profile in the Brazilian elderly population [ ], even though the Met/Met genotype was not reported in the latter population.
The BDNF Val66Met allelic frequencies depend on ethnicity [ , ]. The Met/Met genotype has been most frequently reported in the Asiatic population [ , ]. In Italians, the Met/Met genotype has been associated with 12.3% and 8.1% of Alzheimer’s patients and controls, respectively [ ]. In North Americans, the Met/Met genotype was presented in 3% of elderly adults, regardless whether they are cognitively normal or have early-stage dementia [ ].
As observed in the heatmap, analysis of the decision tree decoded the BP and the dementia groups in order to bring them closer, based on the variables age, anti-BP180 values, and BDNF peptide. The comprehensive data analysis performed in this study strongly supports that the combination of methods provides high-quality performance to establish a relationship between BP and dementia, with direct association with clinical records, serological data, and molecular results.
The present findings should be interpreted in conjunction with some limitations. The small DNA sample size of the studied groups limited the SNP studies. Because BP and dementia affect the elderly population, the patient usually died before the biological sample was collected. BDNF Val66Met SNP determination did not aggregate information on the differentiation between the clinical groups. However, when genotype entered as a variable in the data mining decision tree, it occupied the third position and was successively preceded by ELISA BDNF quantification, ELISA anti-BP180 quantification, and age.
Conclusions
We have investigated the association between BP and dementia on the basis of clinical data, IgG anti-BP180 and anti-BP230 ELISA assays, serum peptide BDNF measurements, and BDNF Val66Met genotyping in a comparative study that included a group of BP patients, a group of dementia patients, and control group that included healthy elderly individuals. The comprehensive data analysis obtained here shows that the BP and the dementia groups share biological predictors of some immunological events that might be involved in dementia-BP clinical association pathogenesis. Surprisingly, some of the dementia patients (10%) present anti-BP180 antibodies above the cutoff value and some of the dementia patients (10%) presentanti-BP230 above the cutoff value. The fact that they display a BP pattern upon IIF shows that they could be a risk population for triggering of the BP disease. In addition, the decreased serum BDNF values in the BP patients motivate further investigations into the interaction among BP180, BP230, and BDNF as predictors of dementia.
