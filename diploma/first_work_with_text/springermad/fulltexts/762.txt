Introduction
The polypeptide γ chain (γ c ) is a common subunit of interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21 receptors. Binding of IL-2 to the IL-2 receptor (IL2R) leads to activation of Janus kinase (JAK)-1 and JAK3-mediated activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 5 [ ].
X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID) is caused by inborn errors in the IL-2RG gene which encodes the common γ chain [ , ]. Fully affected individuals usually have no mature T and natural killer (NK) cells and a normal or relatively elevated number of non-functional B cells [ ]. Persistent viral and opportunistic infections are common manifestations, often associated with protracted diarrhea and failure to thrive. Without hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), the disease is fatal within the first year of life [ , ].
Previous reports demonstrated atypical cases of X-SCID which resulted from a specific c.664C>T, p.R222C mutation in IL2RG . These patients presented with a severe clinical immune deficiency, while T and NK cell numbers were only moderately reduced or even normal. The diagnosis of these patients is challenging, and therefore warrants a high index of suspicion [ , , , ].
In this study, we report five additional children of the same extended kindred with the same IL2RG mutation. We extend the current understanding of the functional impact of this mutation and discuss the diagnostic challenge of this often clinically less severe combined immunodeficiency. In these patients, a high degree of suspicion and a confirmatory genetic diagnosis was the basis for successful treatment by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
Methods
mmunological and genetic analysis was performed as the clinical phenotype, and family history of the patients was highly suggestive of a primary immune deficiency.
Patients
The study comprises five patients treated between June 2014 and October 2016 at the Department of Pediatric Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel. Peripheral blood was drawn from the patients after obtaining informed consent, which was approved by the ethical review boards of both Hadassah Medical Center and the Israeli Ministry of Health.
Immunological Workup
A basic immunological workup was performed in all patients and is detailed in the Supplementary Materials section of this manuscript [ , , , ]; it included serum immunoglobulin (Ig) levels, a complete blood count, basic lymphocyte phenotyping, and maternal engraftment studies, and quantification of signal joint T cell receptor excision circles (sjTREC) copy number. Age-matched reference intervals were used [ , , ].
Genetic Workup
Genomic DNA was extracted from 5-ml whole blood samples of five affected children, parents, and siblings. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed on DNA of patient (P1). The DNA sample of the patient was enriched with Agilent V.4 51 Mb Exome capture kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Sequencing was carried out on HiSeq2500 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) as 100-bp paired-end runs. Read alignment and variant calling were performed with DNAnexus software (Palo Alto, CA, USA) using the default parameters with the human genome assembly Hg19 as reference.
Annotation was done using ANNOVAR annotation program [ ]. Based on the common family background and the X-linked inheritance, in P2, P3, P4, and P5 and in the unaffected members of each family, the genetic findings were investigated by Sanger sequencing of IL2RG .
Results
Clinical Characteristics, Treatment, and Outcome.
Patients’ clinical characteristics are summarized in Table 1 . All patients are males of Arab ethnicity and were members of the same extended family (Fig. 1 ). Three (P3, P4, and P5) were born out of a consanguineous marriage, and P3 and P4 are brothers. All patients had a family history of first-degree male relatives from the maternal side with suspected primary immune deficiency (PID), who were not available for this study since they had died.

The mean age (range) at clinical presentation was 6.8 [ , , , , , , , , , , ] months. P1, P3, and P5 presented during early infancy with recurrent episodes of pneumonia, which were successfully treated with antibiotics. Patients P2, P3, P4, and P5 suffered from chronic diarrhea since early infancy. No specific pathogens and, in particular, no opportunistic infections were identified. P2 additionally presented with dermatitis, lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly with significantly elevated esinophil count (peak esinophil count of 4400 cells/μL; normal range: 40–400 cells/μL). The dermatitis consisted of scaly erythematous plaques at the scalp, neck, inguinal, and axillary folds, compatible with seborrheic dermatitis.
In three patients (P1, P2, P3), low immunoglobulin levels were found, and the patients were treated with monthly intravenous IgG (IVIG) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis.
Four patients underwent successful HSCT at the mean age of 1.7 years (range: 0.9–2.9). All of them were transplanted with a protocol consisting of fludarabine-treosulfan-thiotepa-antithymocyte globulin (ATG) from a matched sibling or matched family donor. Currently, all transplanted patients are alive and well without any signs of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) after the respective prophylaxis. Immunoglobulin levels and lymphocyte counts of all transplanted children were normal for age at the last investigation. Donor chimerism varied between 30 and 100% (Table 1 ).
P4 presented with EBV-driven PTLD 1 month following HSCT which responded to rituximab. P5 presented 5 months after HSCT with Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) (Table 1 ). He was treated according to modified LCH protocol with cytarabine and glucocorticoids with clinical and radiological resolution.
P1 continues to suffer from significant pulmonary morbidity with recurrent pneumonia despite monthly IVIG infusions. No matched related or unrelated donor was found and his family refused an alternative (umbilical cord or haploidentical) donor transplantation.
Genetic Analysis
In P1 (who was a child from non-consanguineous marriage), WES revealed c.664C>T: p.R222C mutation in exon 5 of IL2RG , hg19_chrx:70326253-70332481_rev. No additional mutations in other disease-causing genes were found. In all patients, genetic findings were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Segregation studies were compatible with disease status in each family.
Immunological Characterization
Lymphocyte and T Cell Subpopulations
Total lymphocyte numbers were within normal range for P2 and P3, decreased in P4 but increased in P1 and P5. Lymphocyte subpopulation analysis is presented in Table 2 . Relative and absolute CD4 T cell counts were reduced in all five patients except for absolute counts in P1. CD8 T cell counts were within the normal range in patients P1, P3, and P5 but reduced in P2 and especially in P4, while absolute B cell counts were elevated in all but P2 and NK cell numbers were normal. Compatible with combined immunodeficiency, the γδ T cell compartment was significantly expanded in the older patients P1 and P3, but not the others. Regarding TCRα/β + T cell subpopulations, we observed a relative, sometimes only mild reduction of naïve CD45RA+ CD4 T cells in all patients. The Vß repertoire of two patients (P1 and P2) demonstrated a broad repertoire with nearly normal distribution (data not shown). Measurement of SjTRECs was performed in four patients upon diagnosis and was found to be only slightly reduced in three of them (P2, P3, and P5) and normal in one (P1) when compared to the normal range of newborns. Maternal engraftment was excluded in all patients. Additional investigations revealed an increased percentage of circulating T follicular helper cells (cTFH), while regulatory T cells (Tregs) and CD8 T cell subpopulations were not consistently affected.

Cytokine Signaling
We found γ c expression in P1 to be comparable to control samples (data not shown). Analysis of cytokine signaling in P1, P3, and P5 showed that STAT5 phosphorylation after exposure to IL-2 was virtually absent in CD4 (Fig. 2 , upper row) and CD8 T cells (data not shown). Stimulation with IL-4 led to normal phosphorylation of STAT6 in most of patients’ B cells (Fig. 2 middle row), whereas IL-21-induced phosphorylation of STAT1 (Fig. 2 , lower row) and STAT5 (data not shown) was completely abrogated in patients’ B cells and also T cells (data not shown). Fig. 2 STAT phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of STAT5 in CD4 T cells after incubation with IL-2, phosphorylation of STAT6 in B cells after stimulation with IL-4, and phosphorylation of STAT1 in B cells after treatment with IL-21 is shown in patient P1, P3, and P5 and two healthy controls
T Cell Activation
While CD4 T cells of P1 proliferated normally after anti-CD3/CD28 and PHA stimulation compared to the respective control, T cells of P3 responded poorly to anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation but normally to PHA. T cell proliferation in P2 was compromised in response to both stimuli compared to control (Table 2 ). T cell activation of P3, P4, and P5 with anti-CD3 and anti-CD3/CD28 induced the upregulation of activation markers CD25, CD69, and ICOS comparable to controls (data not shown). Cytokine analysis revealed an increased percentage of IL-4 positive cells among CD45R0 CD4 T cells of P5 without extra stimulation, while PMA/ionomycin stimulation of his T cells resulted in a normal induction of IL-2, IL-17, and IFN-γ positive cells (Fig. 3 ). Fig. 3 T cell differentiation. IL-4, IFN-γ, IL-17, and IL-2 production in CD45R0 CD4 T cells of P5 untreated or after stimulation with PMA/Ionomycin
Humoral Immunity and B Cell Differentiation
IgG, IgM, and IgA levels were decreased in three (P1, P2, and P3), four (P1, P3, P4, and P5), and two (P1 and P5) patients, respectively (Table 2 ). IgM-memory B cells were reduced in three out of four patients, and IgM only-, IgA-, and IgG-switched-memory B cells were more or less absent in all investigated patients (Table 2 and Fig. 4 a). Transitional B cells were not affected. In vitro examination of PBMCs of P1, P3, and P5 revealed that proliferation was strongly compromised after stimulation with IL-21 and CD40, while it was comparable to control cells after stimulation with IgM, CD40, and IL-4 (Fig. 4 b). Accordingly, the differentiation of plasmablasts was abrogated after stimulation with IL-21 and CD40 in the patients (Fig. 4 c), whereas stimulation with CpG induced differentiation of plasmablasts in all three patients (data not shown).

NK Cell Differentiation and Function
NK cell counts and their distribution of CD56dim and bright subpopulations were within normal ranges (Table 2 ). After stimulation with IL-2, the NK cells of all three patients did not upregulate KI67 expression as an indicator of initiating proliferation (Fig. 5 a). Also, the upregulation of CD16 at low doses of IL-2 was decreased (Fig. 5 b), while the upregulation of NKG2D did not differ significantly (Fig. 5 c). Even the IL-2 induced increase of NK-cell degranulation was not completely absent at 100 U/ml IL-2, although it was reduced (Fig. 5 d). Numbers of circulating total innate like lymphocytes (ILC) and their subpopulations were within the normal range (Fig. 5 e).

Discussion
In this study, we report five patients with a c.664C>T, p.R222C mutation in the IL2RG gene presenting with atypical SCID.
Hypomorphic mutations in several SCID-associated genes have been described as causing atypical SCID, including Artemis [ ], Recombinant Activating Gene (RAG) 1 [ ], and JAK3 genes [ ]. Atypical SCID is often characterized by delayed onset and a milder clinical presentation. The hypomorphic c.664C>T, p.R222C mutation in the IL2RG gene, was first described in 1997 [ ] and recently summarized by Fuchs et al. [ ]. Although having normal or only moderately reduced T and NK cell numbers, all reported patients, not diagnosed at birth (12 out of 14), presented with opportunistic infections or an Omenn-like clinical picture (9). In contrast, none of our patients suffered from opportunistic infections and only one patient presented with an Omenn-like picture (P2). This milder presentation was not due to the relative preservation of CD4 T cells in our patients since similar CD4 counts were observed in 3/14 previously recorded patients [ , ] all of whom presented with Pneumocystis jirovecii (PCJ) pneumonia within the first year of life. Interestingly, consistent with previous reports and unlike other hypomorphic forms of SCID, the c.664C>T, p.R222C mutation in IL2RG rarely presents with clinical signs of immune dysregulation, although we cannot exclude that the diarrhea in our patients may be due to non-infectious inflammatory gastrointestinal disease since no biopsies were available.
Given near normal total CD4 counts in four out of five patients, the only consistent immunological clue suggesting combined immunodeficiency was a reduced number of circulating naïve CD4 T cells. Neither disturbed T cell proliferation, differentiation of memory CD4 T cell subpopulations nor the expansion of γδ T cells were reliable diagnostic markers. Also as previously reported by Fuchs et al. [ ], the number of the two strongly IL-2-dependent populations, i.e., regulatory T cells and NK cells were normal. Only IL-2-dependent NK cell proliferation was severely disturbed, all other functions like upregulation of CD16, NKD2G, or degranulation after IL-2 stimulation were not significantly impaired in our patients, corroborating the residual function of the receptor. Additionally, we demonstrated a normal differentiation of the investigated ILC populations in peripheral blood.
In contrast, peripheral B cell differentiation was severely disturbed. In all examined patients, we could demonstrate an absence or severe reduction of IgM-only, IgG, and IgA memory B cells. This consistent finding is possibly due to poor STAT phosphorylation after IL-2 and IL-21 stimulation leading to impaired B cell differentiation and proliferation after IL-21 stimulation as previously shown for one patient [ ]. Furthermore, the observed relative expansion of circulating cTFH cells suggests that TFH differentiation is not dependent on γc-signaling including IL-21 signaling, corroborating previous findings in patients with IL-21R deficiency [ ], and that the absence of switched memory B cells in patients with this specific IL2RG mutation is not due to impaired TFH generation and germinal center formation, but rather due to a critical role of γc-cytokine family members (especially IL-21) for B cells in germinal center maintenance and output [ ]. In contrast, the reduction of IgG and IgA serum levels is not a consistent finding (reduced IgG in 6/14 patients). This might be due to the fact that TLR signaling and induction of plasma cells is not disturbed and that the p.R222C mutation affects IL-4 signaling less severely than that of IL-2 or IL-21, possibly allowing for B cell proliferation and plasma cell differentiation under appropriate conditions.
This small patient cohort of patient with the p.R222C mutation in IL2RG underscores the importance of early genetic testing despite the absence of clear laboratory evidence when suspecting SCID based on family history and onset of disease in the first year of life. Most patients would have been missed on neonatal screening due to the presence of TRECs. Therefore, suspicion should be raised in all male children, especially with a family history compatible with an X-linked inheritance, with or without hypogammaglobulinemia, severely impaired B cell memory formation, and reduced percentage of naïve CD4 T cells. Typical diagnostic evaluation of T cell function can be normal and therefore might not be helpful in diagnosis. Only the specific investigation of absent STAT5 phosphorylation and cellular activation after low-dose IL-2 stimulation reveal the diagnosis. Thus, early genetic testing of an extended panel of immunodeficiency-related genes or the whole exome is required to make a timely diagnosis and allows for the essential referral for life-saving bone marrow transplantation, which might be otherwise unnecessarily delayed because of the lack of an accurate diagnosis.
