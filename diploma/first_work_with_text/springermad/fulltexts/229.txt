Highlights
Conventional time-to-first-event analysis only captures the occurrence of the earliest event but not subsequent events, resulting in failure to gauge the total burden of disease Among stented patients with atrial fibrillation, rivaroxaban with background antiplatelet therapy reduced the first occurrence of bleeding compared to triple therapy with warfarin Multiple-event analysis with Wei-Lin-Weissfeld method demonstrated that rivaroxaban-based regimen decreased the risk of recurrent clinically significant bleedings or bleeding events requiring medical attention Time-to-first-event analysis in conjunction with multiple-event analysis should be considered in future trials
Introduction
The PIONEER AF-PCI trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01830543) demonstrated that in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) undergoing PCI and stent placement, the administration of either low-dose rivaroxaban (15 mg once daily) plus a P2Y12 inhibitor or very-low-dose rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily) plus dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) was associated with a lower risk of the first bleeding event as compared with standard triple therapy using dose-adjusted warfarin plus DAPT [ ]. However, survival analyses using a time-to-first event approach, as traditionally performed in clinical trials, only capture the occurrence of the first event and subsequent clinical events for the same subject are not accounted for, resulting in failure to capture the true burden of disease.
The purpose of this post hoc analysis was to compare the risk of bleeding in both the 15 mg once daily rivaroxaban arm and the 2.5 mg twice daily rivaroxaban arm to the standard warfarin-based therapy using a time-to-multiple-event method that captures all bleeding events experienced by each subject. We hypothesized that total bleeding events, including those beyond the first event, would be reduced with rivaroxaban-based regimens.
Methods
Study design and population
The trial design has been previously described in detail [ ]. In brief, men and women at least 18 years of age who had paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent non-valvular atrial fibrillation and who had just undergone PCI with stent placement were enrolled. Major exclusion criteria were a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack, clinically significant gastrointestinal bleeding within 12 months before randomization, a calculated creatinine clearance of less than 30 ml per minute, anemia of an unknown cause with a hemoglobin concentration of less than 10 g per deciliter, or any other condition known to increase the risk of bleeding.
Study interventions
Subjects were randomized within 72 h of sheath removal once the international normalized ratio was ≤ 2.5 in a 1:1:1 fashion to three treatment strategies: Group 1 —rivaroxaban 15 mg (or 10 mg for subjects with moderate renal impairment [creatinine clearance 30–50 ml/min]) once daily plus background single antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel (75 mg/d) for 12 months; Group 2 —rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily plus background DAPT with low-dose aspirin (75–100 mg/d) plus clopidogrel (75 mg/d) for a prespecified duration of either 12 months or for 1 or 6 months followed by rivaroxaban 15 mg (or 10 mg for subjects with moderate renal impairment) once daily plus background single antiplatelet therapy with low-dose aspirin (75–100 mg/d); and Group 3 —traditional triple therapy with dose-adjusted warfarin once daily (target INR 2.0–3.0) plus background DAPT with low-dose aspirin (75–100 mg/d) plus clopidogrel (75 mg/d) for a prespecified duration of either 12 months or for 1 or 6 months followed by dose-adjusted VKA once daily (target INR 2.0–3.0) plus background single antiplatelet therapy with low-dose aspirin (75–100 mg/d).
Study endpoints
The primary safety endpoint was the occurrence of clinically significant bleeding (a composite of major bleeding or minor bleeding or bleeding requiring medical attention according to Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction [TIMI] criteria) during the treatment period (defined as the time from the first administration of a trial drug to 2 days after the trial drugs were discontinued, through 12 months of therapy). The secondary safety endpoints were the occurrence of each component of the composite endpoint.
Statistical analysis
This analysis was performed in the modified intention to-treat population, which included all participants who underwent randomization and received at least one dose of a study medication during the treatment period. Descriptive statistics for the number of subjects who experienced one or more bleeding events were calculated. The total number of bleeding events was compared across treatment groups. The Wei, Lin, and Weissfeld (WLW) method was used to calculate unadjusted hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals [ ]. The WLW method utilizes a semi-parametric marginal Cox distribution and takes into account correlated outcomes within the same subject. Due to the non-independent nature of these data, sandwich variance estimation was utilized. All analyses were performed using two-sided tests at a significance level of 0.05 with SAS software version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., North Carolina, United States). Analyses in this substudy were exploratory, and no adjustment was made for multiplicity.
Results
Clinically significant bleeding
In total, 109 (15.7%) subjects in Group 1 (Riva 15 mg once daily + P2Y 12 inhibitor), 117 (16.6%) subjects in Group 2 (Riva 2.5 mg twice daily + DAPT), and 167 (24.0%) subjects in Group 3 (VKA + DAPT) experienced at least one clinically significant bleeding event (Table 1 ; Fig. 1 ). Multiple bleeds (i.e., ≥ 2 bleeds) occurred among 31 (4.5%) subjects in Group 1, 26 (3.7%) subjects in Group 2, and 34 (4.9%) subjects in Group 3. The maximum number of bleeds per patient was 7 (Table 1 ). There was a total of 514 clinically significant bleeds, with a significant risk reduction observed comparing Group 1 versus Group 3 (152 [21.8%] vs. 216 [31.0%], HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.49–0.85, p < 0.001, ARR = 9.2%, NNT = 11), Group 2 versus Group 3 (146 [20.7%] vs. 216 [31.0%], HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.48–0.80, p < 0.001, ARR = 10.3%, NNT = 10), and Group 1 + Group 2 versus Group 3 (298 [21.3%] vs. 216 [31.0%], HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.50–0.79, p < 0.001, ARR = 9.7%, NNT = 11).

Discussion
This substudy demonstrates that rivaroxaban-based regimen was associated with a reduction in multiple bleeding events compared to triple therapy with VKA. Only 10–11 patients would have to be treated with rivaroxaban to prevent one additional clinically significant bleeding. Similarly, only 13–14 patients would have to be treated with rivaroxaban instead of VKA to prevent one additional bleeding that requires medical attention. Along with the time to first bleeding event analysis [ ], these data regarding the total burden of bleeding reinforce the treatment benefit of rivaroxaban with respect to bleeding reduction.
Recurrent events may not only adversely impact the quality of life, but also increase the healthcare costs by requiring more interventions or hospitalizations [ , ]. Evaluating the total number of events may provide a more comprehensive estimate of treatment benefit when the study medication has been shown to reduce the first occurrence of the endpoint. Expanded analysis of multiple events may warrant consideration in future trials.
Limitations
First, recurrent events within patients are often correlated and thus may violate the assumption of independence of events. For instance, after a first bleeding event, subjects may discontinue the study drug, which may in turn influence the risk of subsequent bleeding events. Second, multiple events analyses were not performed for TIMI major and TIMI minor bleeding separately, as there was only a total of 47 and 28 bleeds, respectively, with minimal multiple events. Only 1 subject in Group 3 had 2 TIMI major bleeds and 1 subject in Group 1 had 2 TIMI minor bleeds. Lastly, given the post hoc nature of the analysis, findings should be considered exploratory and hypothesis-generating.
Conclusions
Rivaroxaban-based regimen reduced the total bleeding events compared with VKA-based triple therapy in stented AF patients. One clinically significant bleeding event could be prevented with rivaroxaban for every 10–11 patients treated, and one bleeding requiring medical attention could be prevented with rivaroxaban for every 13–14 patients treated. These data provide further support for the benefit of rivaroxaban-based antithrombotic regimens.
