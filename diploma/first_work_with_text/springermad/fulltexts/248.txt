Introduction
Complication with cardiovascular disease determines the prognosis of patients with diabetes [ ]. Dyslipidemia is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and patients with diabetes are often complicated with hyper-triglyceridemia, hyper-LDL cholesterolemia and hypo-HDL cholesterolemia [ ]. Blood hyper-coagulability also increases the risk of cardiovascular disease [ ]. Patients with diabetes are known to be prone to have abnormalities in the blood coagulation-fibrinolysis system such as increased platelet function and increased synthesis of prothrombotic factors including fibrinogen and PAI-1 in the liver [ ].
Hyper-LDL cholesterolemia and hypo-HDL cholesterolemia cause an increase in the risk of coronary artery disease [ ]. In addition to reverse cholesterol transport from the vascular wall to the liver [ ], HDL has been shown to modulate the status of the blood coagulation and fibrinolysis system: HDL particles have various anti-thrombotic actions on platelets, endothelial cells and the blood coagulation-fibrinolysis system [ ]. Oxidative stress is deeply involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and is increased in patients with diabetes [ , ]. Oxidization of LDL is a crucial step for initiation of atherosclerosis [ ]. HDL is known to be more susceptible than LDL to oxidation [ ], and oxidized HDL (ox-HDL) has no atheroprotective properties and shows proinflammatory and prothrombotic properties [ ]. However, the significance of blood ox-HDL level remains unknown.
In our recent brief study, d-dimer, a good marker to evaluate blood coagulatbility, was shown to be independently associated with HDL cholesterol and ox-HDL levels in patients with type 2 diabetes, while d-dimer showed no significant relations with LDL cholesterol, oxidized LDL (ox-LDL) and triglycerides [ ]. D-dimer reflects both coagulation and fibrinolysis, and it remains to be clarified whether coagulation, fibrinolysis, or both of them are associated with HDL cholesterol and ox-HDL. In this study, we therefore investigated the relationships of HDL cholesterol and ox-HDL with thrombin–anti-thrombin complex (TAT), a coagulation marker, and plasmin–α2 plasmin inhibitor complex (PIC), a fibrinolysis marker, in patients with type 2 diabetes [ ]. We also investigated whether ox-LDL and other blood lipids including LDL cholesterol and triglycerides are associated with TAT and PIC.
Subjects and methods
Subjects
The subjects of this study were 108 male and 55 female outpatients who had been diagnosed as having type 2 diabetes mellitus. This study was approved by the ethics committees of Hyogo College of Medicine (number: 1766) and Kobe Tokushukai Hospital (number: TGE00313-014). Individual histories of illness, medication, cigarette smoking and alcohol drinking were surveyed by questionnaires.
Measurements
Height and body weight were measured with light clothes at a health checkup. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters.
Early morning fasting blood samples were collected and serum and plasma samples were separated and stored at − 20 °C for further analyses. Serum HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol concentrations were measured by enzymatic methods using commercial kits. Hemoglobin A1c was measured by using an automatic glycol-hemoglobin analyzer based on high-performance liquid chromatography. Since the standards of hemoglobin A1c used for measurement are different in the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) method and the Japan Diabetes Society (JDS) method, hemoglobin A1c values were calibrated by using a formula proposed by the JDS [ ]: hemoglobin A1c (NGSP) (%) = 1.02 × hemoglobin A1c (JDS) (%) + 0.25%. Subjects with diabetes were defined as those receiving drug therapy for diabetes and/or those showing high hemoglobin A1c levels (≥ 6.5%), according to the criteria for diagnosis of diabetes by the American Diabetes Association [ ]. Blood glucose was measured by using an automatic glucose analyzer based on the GOD/hydrogen peroxide electrode method.
Plasma fibrinogen concentration was measured by evaluating thrombin clotting time using a commercial kit (Thrombocheck Fib [Sysmex, Kobe, Japan]). TAT and PIC in plasma were measured with an enzyme immunoassay using a commercial kit (TAT (S) [Fujirebio, Tokyo, Japan]) and a latex photometric immunoassay using a commercial kit (LPIA-ACE PPI II [LSI Medience Corporation, Tokyo, Japan]), respectively.
ox-LDL was measured as LAB (LOX-1 [lectin-like ox-LDL receptor-1] ligand containing ApoB) by using a sandwich enzyme immunoassay as described previously [ , ].
Oxidized HDL was also measured by an enzyme immunoassay combined with a receptor-ligand assay as follows. LOX-1 is known to bind to both ox-LDL and ox-HDL [ ]. Recombinant LOX-1 was immobilized on 96-well microtiter plates, and then the plates were blocked with bovine serum albumin. After washing three times with PBST0.05 (phosphate-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween20), diluted serum samples and assay standards (Cu 2+ -oxidized human HDL) were added to the plates and the plates were incubated for 2 h with gentle agitation at room temperature. After washing five times with PBST0.05, the plates were incubated with 5000-fold diluted rabbit polyclonal anti-human apolipoprotein A-I antibody (AssayPro, St. Charles, USA) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing five times with PBST0.05, the plates were incubated with 5000-fold diluted peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After washing five times with PBST0.05, substrate solution (TMB solution; Bio-Rad, Hercules, USA) was added to the plates, which were further incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was terminated with 1 M H 2 SO 4 , and the absorbance at 450 nm of the processed plates was measured by a plate reader.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using a computer software program (SPSS version 16.0 J for Windows, Chicago IL, USA). In linear regression analysis, Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient was calculated. The values of each lipid or lipid-related variable in the subjects were arranged in ascending order, and then the subjects were divided into three tertile groups of equal sizes. Prevalences of high fibrinogen (> 400 mg/dl), high TAT (> 3.0 ng/ml) or high PIC (> 0.8 µg/ml) were compared among the tertile groups for each variable using the chi-squared test. In logistic regression analysis, crude and adjusted odds ratios for high fibrinogen, high TAT or high PIC were estimated in the 2nd and 3rd tertile groups versus the 1st tertile group for each variable. In the logistic regression analysis, age, gender, smoking, alcohol drinking, BMI, hemoglobin A1c, and histories of therapy for dyslipidemia, therapy for diabetes and anti-coagulant therapy were used as other explanatory variables. Medians of TAT or PIC were compared among tertile groups for oxHDL by using the Kruskal–Wallis test. Probability ( p ) values < 0.05 were defined as significant.

Correlations of each lipid-related variable with fibrinogen, TAT and PIC
Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients of each lipid-related variable with fibrinogen, TAT and PIC are shown in Table 2 . Fibrinogen showed significant positive correlations with LDL cholesterol, ratio of LDL cholesterol to HDL cholesterol (LDL-C/HDL-C) and ratio of ox-LDL to ox-HDL (ox-LDL/ox-HDL) and significant inverse correlations with HDL cholesterol and ox-HDL. TAT showed significant positive correlations with LDL-C/HDL-C and ox-LDL/ox-HDL and a significant inverse correlation with ox-HDL. Although PIC showed no significant correlation with any of the lipid-related variables, marginally significant correlations were found between PIC and triglycerides ( p = 0.054) and between PIC and ox-HDL ( p = 0.087).

Comparison of the prevalence of high fibrinogen, high TAT or high PIC among tertile groups for HDL cholesterol or ox-HDL
Table 3 shows the prevalence of high fibrinogen, high TAT or high PIC in the tertile groups for HDL cholesterol or ox-HDL. The prevalence of high fibrinogen was significantly lower in the 3rd tertile group for HDL cholesterol or ox-HDL and was significantly lower in the 2nd tertile group for ox-HDL when compared with the 1st tertile for HDL cholesterol or ox-HDL. The prevalence of high TAT was significantly or marginally significantly lower in the 3rd and 2nd tertile groups, respectively, for ox-HDL than in its 1st tertile and tended to be lower with an increase of the tertile. Although the prevalence of high TAT also tended to be lower with an increase of the tertile for HDL cholesterol, no significant difference was found in the prevalence of high TAT among the tertile groups for HDL cholesterol. The prevalence of high PIC was marginally significantly lower in the 2nd tertile group for HDL cholesterol and the 3rd tertile group for ox-HDL than in the 1st tertile groups for HDL cholesterol and ox-HDL, respectively.

Odds ratios for high fibrinogen, high TAT or high PIC in each tertile group versus the 1st tertile for HDL cholesterol or ox-HDL
Table 4 shows the results of multivariate logistic regression analysis for the relationships of HDL cholesterol and ox-HDL with high fibrinogen, high TAT or high PIC. Age, gender, smoking, alcohol drinking, BMI, hemoglobin A1c, therapy for dyslipidemia, therapy for diabetes and anti-coagulation therapy were used as other explanatory variables. Odds ratios for high fibrinogen versus the 1st tertile group for ox-HDL were significantly lower in the 2nd tertile group for ox-HDL and marginally significantly lower in the 3rd tertile group for ox-HDL than the reference level of 1.00. Odds ratios for high TAT and high PIC versus the 1st tertile group for ox-HDL were significantly lower in the 3rd tertile group than the reference level and tended to be lower with an increase of the tertile. Odds ratios for high fibrinogen, high TAT and high PIC in the 2nd and 3rd tertile groups for HDL cholesterol versus its 1st tertile group were not significantly different from the reference level.

Comparison of medians of TAT or PIC among tertile groups for ox-HDL
Figure 1 shows box plots for comparison of the medians of TAT (A) or PIC (B). TAT and PIC tended to be lower with an increase of tertile for ox-HDL, although there was no significant difference in TAT ( p = 0.141) or PIC ( p = 0.166) among the tertile groups.

Discussion
The results of linear and logistic regression analyses showed that ox-HDL was inversely associated with TAT and PIC, and ox-HDL levels may be related to both blood coagulation and fibrinolysis in patients with diabetes. This explains the finding in our recent study that ox-HDL was inversely associated with d-dimer, which reflects both blood coagulation and fibrinolysis. In addition, fibrinogen, a key protein of the coagulation pathway, was inversely associated with ox-HDL, although no linear relationship between them was found in multivariate logistic regression analysis (Table 4 ). In addition to being an important risk factor for vascular complications in diabetes [ ], fibrinogen is known as an acute phase protein and it remains under debate whether fibirinogen is a marker or mediator of vascular disease [ ]. Thus, there is a possibility of potent confounding for the relationship between fibrinogen and ox-HDL by acute phase reaction. The present study is the first study showing relationships of ox-HDL with blood coagulation and fibrinolysis separately.
On the other hand, HDL cholesterol did not show significant relationships with TAT and PIC in the present study, although a significant relationship was found between HDL cholesterol and d-dimer [ ]. The reason for this dissociation of the results is unknown, but a possible explanation for the dissociation is the difference in sensitivities of the examinations: d-dimer is more sensitive than TAT and PIC for detection of change in the status of blood coagulation or fibrinolysis. In fact, the correlation of ox-HDL with d-dimer was stronger than the correlations of ox-HDL with TAT and PIC (Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient: d-dimer, − 0.413; TAT, − 0.205; PIC, − 0,135). LDL cholesterol and ox-LDL showed no associations with TAP or PIC, in agreement with the results of our previous study showing that neither LDL cholesterol nor ox-LDL was associated with d-dimer [ ].
The clinical significance of circulating ox-HDL level remains unknown. There have been only a small number of studies on the relation of ox-HDL to cardiovascular disease, and the results of these studies are discrepant: Honda et al. reported that serum ox-HDL showed a significant positive relationship with cardiovascular disease events in patients receiving hemodialysis [ , ], while plasma ox-HDL was significantly lower in patients who had undergone carotid endarterectomy than in healthy controls in a study by Nakano et al. [ ]. In a cross-sectional study using a database of a general population by Kresanov et al., low ox-HDL level was associated with high insulin level in men and was associated with increased waist circumference and daily smoking in women [ ]. In the present study using data for patients with type 2 diabetes, TAT and PIC tended to be lower in patients showing high ox-HDL levels. High levels of TAT and PIC as well as d-dimer mean individual increased thrombogenicity [ ], and thus low ox-HDL is associated with high thrombogenicity. Since high thrombogenicity is involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease, high ox-HDL level in blood is thought to be related to low cardiovascular risk. Although the reason for the inverse relation of ox-HDL to thrombogenicity is unknown, one possible explanation is that oxidization of HDL results in prevention of the generation of ox-LDL, an important atherogenic molecule, since HDL is more susceptible to oxidation than is LDL [ ]. In the present study, there was no significant correlation between ox-HDL and ox-LDL levels (Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient: − 0.031 [ p = 0.690]), suggesting that the significance of HDL oxidation is different from the significance of LDL oxidation. This hypothesis of ox-HDL as a protector against oxidization of LDL needs to be elucidated in future studies. It would also be interesting to know whether individual differences exist in susceptibility of HDL to oxidation.
There are limitations of this study. The population size of the subjects was not large, and most of the subjects were elderly patients with type 2 diabetes (median age: 70 years). Thus, further studies using larger and younger populations of the patients are needed to confirm the findings of this study. Judging from the hemoglobin A1c levels of the subjects (median: 6.9%), most of them were patients with mild diabetes or patients under good glycemic control, and further studies are needed to determine whether there is an association between ox-HDL and thrombogenecity in patients with a more advanced stage of diabetes. Since all of the subjects of this study were Japanese, further studies using subjects of other races and ethnicities are also needed to confirm the present findings. Since the sensitivities of TAT and PIC were not as high as the sensitivity of d-dimer, some samples with very low concentrations of TAT and PIC could not be numerically determined (below 1.0 ng/ml for TAT [n = 10] and below 0.3 µg/ml for PIC [n = 14]). Accordingly, only logistic regression analysis estimating the odds ratio for high TAT or high PIC was performed for multivariate analysis. In the multivariate analysis, age, gender, smoking, alcohol drinking, BMI, hemoglobin A1c, and histories of therapy for dyslipidemia, therapy for diabetes and anti-coagulant therapy were used as explanatory variables. However, there are other possible confounding factors for the relationships of lipid-related variables with blood coagulation and fibrinolysis, including exercise, diet, nutrition and socioeconomic status, for which information was not available in this study. Finally, this study is cross-sectional in its design, and thus no causality can be discussed from the findings.
In conclusion, ox-HDL was associated with TAT and PIC and is thus thought to be related to both blood coagulation and fibrinolysis in patients with type 2 diabetes.
