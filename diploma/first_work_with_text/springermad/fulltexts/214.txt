Highlights
The influence of anemia on the long-term clinical outcomes has not been fully evaluated in patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE). Mild and moderate/severe baseline anemia as compared with no anemia in VTE patients were associated with significantly higher risk for long-term major bleeding events, and the risk for major bleeding increased according to the severity of anemia. Moderate/severe baseline anemia as compared with no anemia was also associated with significantly higher risk for all-cause death, but not for recurrent VTE. We should pay more attention to the optimal intensity and duration of anticoagulation in VTE patients with anemia.
Introduction
Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT), is a major health problem in the world [ ]. VTE has a long-term risk for recurrence, which can be prevented by anticoagulation therapy [ ]. The current guidelines recommend specific durations of anticoagulation therapy for the prevention of recurrent VTE depending on the risks for recurrence [ , , , ]. However, there is a concern on an increased risk for bleeding associated with anticoagulation therapy, and there is still uncertainty about the optimal duration of anticoagulation therapy, leading to widely varying durations of anticoagulation therapy in daily clinical practice. Thus, the identification of patients who might benefit from prolonged anticoagulation therapy is becoming clinically more relevant.
Anemia is commonly found in routine blood tests and is potentially treatable [ ]. Importantly, preexisting anemia might be associated with a higher risk for future bleeding events during anticoagulation therapy, because anemia could be the result from long-standing bleeding tendency. Actually, previous studies reported that anemia was an independent risk factor for bleeding events during the first 3 months of anticoagulation therapy in VTE patients [ , ]. However, the relationship between anemia and long-term outcomes in VTE patients has not been fully evaluated yet. Understanding the influence of anemia on long-term clinical outcomes is important for appropriate decision making on the duration of anticoagulation therapy. Therefore, we sought to evaluate the influence of baseline anemia on the long-term clinical outcomes in VTE patients in a large observational study in Japan.
Methods
Study population
The COMMAND VTE (COntemporary ManageMent AND outcomes in patients with Venous ThromboEmbolism) Registry is a physician-initiated, multicenter cohort study enrolling consecutive patients with acute symptomatic VTE objectively confirmed by imaging examinations or by autopsy among 29 centers in Japan between January 2010 and August 2014 in Japan [ ]. The relevant review boards or ethics committees in all 29 participating centers (Online Resource Appendix 1) approved the research protocol. We searched the hospital databases for clinical diagnosis and imaging examinations, and enrolled consecutive patients who met the definition of acute symptomatic VTE diagnosed within 31 days from symptom onset during the study period [ ].
We enrolled 3027 consecutive patients with acute symptomatic VTE after screening of the consecutive 19,634 patients with suspected VTE for eligibility through chart review by the physicians at each institution. The current study population consisted of 3012 patients with available hemoglobin (Hb) value at diagnosis after excluding 15 patients, in whom Hb value at diagnosis was not available (Online Resource Fig. 1). The study patients were categorized into three groups based on the baseline Hb values according to the standard World Health Organization classification of anemia: no anemia (Hb ≥ 13.0 g/dl for men, and ≥ 12.0 g/dl for women), mild anemia (Hb 11.0–12.9 g/dl for men, and 11.0–11.9 g/dl for women), and moderate (Hb ≤ 10.9 g/dl)/severe anemia (Hb ≤ 7.9 g/dl) [ ]. We compared the clinical characteristics, management strategies and long-term outcomes among the three groups (moderate/severe anemia, mild anemia, and no anemia) with a median follow-up period of 1219 (interquartile range [IQR]: 847–1765) days for surviving patients (95.2% follow-up rate at 1 year). The detailed definitions of patient characteristics are described in Online Resource Appendix 3.
Clinical follow-up and endpoints
The primary outcome measure in the present analysis was major bleeding, which was defined as International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) major bleeding, which consisted of a reduction in the hemoglobin level by at least 2 g/dl, transfusion of at least two units of blood or symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ [ ]. The secondary outcome measures were recurrent VTE and all-cause death. The recurrent VTE was defined as PE and/or DVT with symptoms accompanied by confirmation of new thrombus or exacerbation of the thrombus by objective imaging examinations or autopsy [ ]. The independent clinical event committee (Online Resource Appendix 2) unaware of the patient characteristics reviewed all study outcomes, and classified the causes of deaths as due to PE, due to cardiac events, due to cancers, due to bleeding events, due to other non-cardiac events, or due to unknown causes [ ]. The definitions of other clinical events are described in the Online Resource Appendix 4.
Statistical analysis
Categorical variables are presented as numbers and percentages, and continuous variables are presented as the mean and standard deviation or the median and IQR based on their distributions. Categorical variables were compared using the chi-squared test when appropriate; otherwise, Fisher’s exact test was used. Continuous variables were compared using one-way analysis of variance or Kruskal–Wallis test based on their distributions. We used the Kaplan–Meier method to estimate the cumulative incidences of the endpoint events and assessed the differences with the log-rank test. To adjust for the clinically relevant variables, we used the multivariable Cox proportional hazard model to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and their 95% confidence interval (CI) for the risk of mild and moderate/severe anemia, respectively, relative to no anemia for clinical outcomes. Based on the previous reports [ , , , ] and consideration of clinical relevance, we selected nine risk-adjusting variables for major bleeding, nine risk-adjusting variables for recurrent VTE, and 16 risk-adjusting variables for all-cause death (Table 1 ). To evaluate major bleeding beyond the acute phase (first 10 days), we conducted the landmark analysis at 10 days as described elsewhere [ ]. In the analyses beyond the acute phase, we excluded those patients who died or had major bleeding within 10 days. All statistical analyses were conducted using JMP version 10.0.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). All reported P-values were 2-tailed, and P-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results
Patient characteristics
In the entire study population, the mean age was 67 years, 61% were women, and mean body weight and body mass index were 57.9 kg and 23.2 kg/m 2 , respectively. The median baseline Hb value measured at diagnosis was 12.0 (IQR: 10.3–13.5) g/dl. There were 1012 patients (34%) with moderate/severe (moderate: 860 patients, and severe: 152 patients) anemia, 615 patients (20%) with mild anemia, and 1385 patients (46%) without anemia (Online Resource Fig. 2). The baseline patient characteristics were different in several aspects across the three groups (Table 1 ). Patients with anemia were older, and more often had lower body weight, and co-morbidities such as chronic kidney disease, active cancer at diagnosis, and history of major bleeding than those without anemia. Patients with anemia less often presented with PE with or without DVT, and less often received thrombolytic therapy than those without anemia (Table 1 ).
Anticoagulation therapy
Patients with anemia less often received anticoagulation therapy beyond the acute phase. Median time in therapeutic range (TTR) among warfarin users was lower in patients with anemia than those without anemia (Table 1 ). Among patients who received anticoagulation therapy beyond the acute phase, any discontinuation of anticoagulation therapy was most frequent in patients with moderate/severe anemia (moderate/severe anemia: 37.6%, mild anemia: 30.5%, and no anemia: 25.2% at 1-year, P < 0.001) (Fig. 1 a). The reasons for discontinuation of anticoagulation were similar across the three groups (Table 1 ). Discontinuation of anticoagulation therapy before bleeding events was also most frequent in patients with moderate/severe anemia (moderate/severe anemia: 31.3% vs. mild anemia: 25.5%, and no anemia: 21.7% at 1-year, P < 0.001) (Fig. 1 b). The prevalence of interruption of anticoagulation therapy during follow-up period was not significantly different among the three groups (Table 1 ).

The discontinuation of anticoagulation was defined as withdrawal of anticoagulation therapy lasting > 14 days for any reasons
Clinical outcomes
The cumulative 5-year incidence of major bleeding was significantly higher in patients with moderate/severe anemia (moderate/severe anemia: 17.6%, mild anemia: 12.1%, and no anemia: 8.7%, P < 0.001) (Fig. 2 a). Even after adjusting the confounders, the excess risk of mild and moderate/severe anemia, respectively, relative to no anemia for major bleeding remained significant (mild anemia: adjusted HR 1.41: [95% CI 1.00–1.98], P = 0.048, and moderate/severe anemia: adjusted HR 1.91: [95% CI 1.42–2.58], P < 0.001, respectively) (Table 2 ). Patients with moderate/severe anemia also had significant excess risk for fatal bleeding as compared with those without anemia (Table 2 ). By the landmark analysis at 10 days, the cumulative incidence of major bleeding was significantly higher in patients with moderate/severe anemia both within 10 days (moderate/severe anemia: 2.6%, mild anemia 1.3%, and no anemia: 1.0%, P = 0.008) and beyond 10 days (15.4%, 10.9%, and 7.7% at 5-year, P < 0.001) (Fig. 2 b). In the stratified analysis according to the presence or absence of active cancer, the cumulative incidence of major bleeding trended to be higher in patients with moderate/severe anemia regardless of the presence or absence of active cancer, although the absolute cumulative incidence of major bleeding was higher in patients with active cancer (Online Resource Figs. 3 and 4).

The cumulative 5-year incidence of recurrent VTE did not differ among three groups (Fig. 3 a). After adjusting confounders, the risks of mild and moderate/severe anemia, respectively, relative to no anemia, respectively, for recurrent VTE remained insignificant (Table 2 ). In patients with moderate/severe anemia, the cumulative 5-year incidence of fatal bleeding was numerically higher than that of fatal PE (Table 2 ). The cumulative 5-year incidence of all-cause death was significantly higher in patients with moderate/severe and mild anemia (moderate/severe anemia: 42.3%, mild anemia: 31.5%, and no anemia: 19.2%, P < 0.001) (Fig. 3 b). Even after adjusting confounders, the excess mortality risk of moderate/severe anemia, but not mild anemia, relative to no anemia remained significant (Table 2 ). The majority of the causes of deaths were cancer in all the groups, which was more prominent in patients with anemia (Online Resource Table 1).

Discussion
The main findings of the current study were as follows; (1) mild and moderate/severe baseline anemia as compared with no anemia in VTE patients were associated with significantly higher risk for long-term major bleeding events, and the risk for major bleeding increased according to the severity of anemia; and (2) moderate/severe baseline anemia as compared with no anemia was also associated with significantly higher risk for all-cause death, but not for recurrent VTE.
Previous studies reported that anemia was associated with an increased risk for bleeding during the first 3 months of anticoagulation therapy in acute VTE patients [ , ]. Another study reported that during the course of anticoagulation therapy for VTE, both cancer- and non-cancer patients with anemia had a higher risk for major bleeding than those without anemia [ ]. Consistent with previous reports, the current study showed that anemia was independently associated with higher risk for major bleeding after adjusting for known risk factors for bleeding. In the acute phase, patients with moderate/severe anemia were associated with higher risk for major bleeding than those without anemia despite the lower rate of thrombolytic therapy in the former than in the latter. Furthermore, anemia was associated with an increased risk for major bleeding beyond the acute phase. The current study also showed that even a mild degree of anemia was associated with significantly higher risk for major bleeding, and the risk for major bleeding increased according to the severity of anemia. Considering an increased risk for long-term major bleeding events in patients with anemia, we should pay more attention to the optimal duration of anticoagulation therapy in patients with anemia.
Several recent randomized clinical trials have shown that an extended duration of anticoagulation reduced the risk of recurrent VTE [ , , ]. However, patients with anemia were often excluded in randomized trials of anticoagulation therapy for VTE patients, suggesting that the results from randomized clinical trials might not be extrapolated to patients with anemia [ , , , , ]. However, in the current real-world registry of VTE patients, we found that more than half of patients had anemia at the time of diagnosis. The cumulative incidence of discontinuation of anticoagulation therapy was significantly higher in patients with moderate/severe anemia than in those without anemia, even after censoring the patients at time of bleeding events, suggesting the physicians’ concern about the risk for bleeding events in these patients. Despite the higher rate of discontinuation of anticoagulation therapy, the bleeding risk was much higher in patients with moderate/severe anemia than in those without anemia. Furthermore, it might be important to note that the cumulative incidence of fatal bleeding was numerically higher than that of fatal PE in patients with moderate/severe anemia. Therefore, extended duration of anticoagulation might be inappropriate in patients with anemia.
Recently, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been introduced for the treatment and secondary prevention of VTE. Reduced dose of DOACs might be a preferable approach in patients with anemia. Currently, edoxaban is the only DOAC having specific dose reduction criteria for the treatment of VTE, although anemia is not specified as the dose reduction criteria [ ]. Lower dose of rivaroxaban was reported to be neutral efficacy for extended VTE treatment compared with standard dose of rivaroxaban [ ]. Considering the high prevalence of anemia in real-world VTE patients and an increased risk for long-term major bleeding events in patients with anemia, further research is needed to define the optimal dose of DOACs in patients with anemia during prolonged anticoagulation therapy.
Anemia was also reported to be associated with an increased risk for mortality in anticoagulated patients with atrial fibrillation [ ]. However, it is uncertain whether anemia, per se, is the cause for increased mortality, or the marker for the comorbidities and a greater frailty. Consistent with the previous report, the current study also showed moderate/severe anemia in VTE patients was independently associated with an increased risk for mortality. Considering that more than half of death was due to cancer, anemia could mainly reflect poor condition of patients with active cancer. However, moderate/severe anemia was also associated with an increased risk for fatal bleeding, suggesting that the increased risk for mortality was partly due to the excess risk for bleeding.
Study limitations
The current study has several limitations. First, we did not evaluate the changes in hemoglobin level over time which could have influenced the clinical outcomes. Second, the current study was an observational study, which can be subject to various biases inherent to observational study design. Despite an extensive statistical adjustment for potential confounders that might affect the status of anemia and/or prognosis, unmeasured confounders might still have influenced the study results. Furthermore, the therapeutic decision-making was left to the discretion of the attending physicians, which could have some influence on clinical outcomes. Third, we did not evaluate the causes of anemia. Some clinical situations such as shock or chemotherapy could have potentially influenced hemoglobin levels. We did not adjust for the critical hemodynamic status at presentation, although we adjusted for PE presentation. Finally, the current study was conducted before introduction of DOACs for VTE in Japan. Thus, it should be interpreted with caution whether the present results could be extrapolated to patients treated with DOACs.
Conclusions
VTE patients with baseline mild and moderate/severe anemia had higher risk for major bleeding events without significant excess risk for recurrent VTE events, and the risk for major bleeding events increased according to the severity of anemia. We should pay more attention to the optimal intensity and duration of anticoagulation in VTE patients with anemia.
