INTRODUCTION
Spectroscopic techniques are extensively employed in pharmaceutical and biotechnology research for a wide array of applications [ , , ]. Two spectroscopic techniques, broadly classified by their light-matter interaction, are electronic and vibrational techniques. Electronic spectroscopies, like UV-Vis absorption and luminescence, are generally used for quantification of analytes during various stages of drug product development. Separately, vibrational spectroscopic techniques like infrared (IR) or near-IR (NIR) absorption are employed as a quality control tool to identify incoming drug substances [ , , , ]. These vibrational techniques have also been used for structure elucidation purposes in conjunction with other spectroscopic techniques to identify process intermediates. Apart from absorption-based methods, both elastic and inelastic light-scattering techniques have also been used in the pharmaceutical industry for multiple applications [ , , ]. Common inelastic light-scattering methods include Raman scattering which is employed as a quality control tool for identification purposes or polymorph identification and is routinely used in the pharmaceutical industry [ , , ]. While most of these spectroscopic and light-scattering techniques are used to identify or quantify the active ingredient, consequently, these approaches emphasize molecular-level discrimination, yet provide little information on the physicochemical properties of the drug at the material level. This information can be used to understand the downstream processing of the drug substance or the drug product. An exception to these techniques is Brillouin light scattering (BLS) which is a vibrational light scattering spectroscopic technique that can provide vital material-level information about intermolecular interactions, their strength and anisotropic distribution and their effect on material properties.
It is interesting to note that while both Raman scattering and Brillouin light scattering (BLS) were experimentally observed at similar times, the notoriety and overall use of Raman scattering far exceeds that of BLS. This disproportional use is restricted not only to pharmaceutical analysis but also to material research at large, and does not stem from any limited applicability of BLS, but rather the separate instrumental needs. Note that these two vibrational techniques sample distinctly separate vibrational modes. For Raman scattering, typically, intramolecular vibrations are analyzed from nominally 300–3500 cm −1 , and a standard diffraction grating provides sufficient dispersion to resolve these Raman resonances from the elastically scattered Rayleigh line. For BLS, however, the frequency of the acoustic phonons (propagating sound waves) is measured, and considering the restoring forces for the intermolecular vibrations are significantly weaker than those for intramolecular covalent bonds, the energy shifts measured in BLS typically range from 0.05–5 cm −1 . Hence, to resolve the Brillouin resonances, a Fabry-Perot interferometer is required. We note that while this interferometer type has been central to the development of BLS from its inception, a solid-phase analog (a virtually imaged phased array) has recently opened unique BLS imaging applications over the past decade [ , , , ]. For any interferometer, a key feature is the parallelism of two reflective surfaces and maintaining this parallelism is strictly mandatory for transmittance stability. External vibrations or minor changes in environmental conditions (temperature or humidity) can substantially deteriorate transmittance on the order of minutes. These external inputs can certainly influence the performance of a Raman spectrometer, but not nearly to the extent for BLS. These instrumental issues have hindered early-stage research with BLS. Alternatively, Raman scattering, which due to its grating-based spectrometer design was not limited by these instrumental considerations, had several decades of use (relative to BLS) to establish a firm experimental foundation for developmental applications.
Present day BLS spectrometers have resolved this stability issue, and BLS is now uniquely positioned for a renaissance period whereby new applications are being rapidly sought and demonstrated [ ]. Our interest in this review is to provide a brief historical context to highlight some of the key instrumental developments that supported the further development of BLS. Following this historical treatment, a physical description of the scattering mechanism is discussed to provide an understanding of the key observables in a BLS measurement. A routine application of BLS is determining the anisotropic mechanical properties of single crystals; however, this mechanical characterization has expanded to thin films, opaque materials, nanoparticles for drug delivery, individual cells for mechanical phenotyping, and powdered materials [ , , , , ]. Most relevant to the pharmaceutical industry is molecular solids; thus, this review emphasizes the utility of BLS for determining the mechanical properties of these materials.
The intermolecular interactions that support the sound waves measured in BLS are the primary forces that resist deformation of the solid when stressed. Thus, a primary output from a BLS study is mechanical data that includes Young’s modulus (E) or shear modulus (G), and their relative anisotropy for a given material. Comprehensive mechanical data is central to understanding the processability of pharmaceutical materials; however, limited mechanical data is available for pharmaceutical materials. Moreover, since the sound velocities measured in BLS are an extension of the fundamental intermolecular interactions in solids, BLS is extending research into crystal engineering, pharmaceutical co-crystallization, and structure-function relationships that potentially reach beyond mechanics alone. Overall, we conclude this review with an outlook on future applications of BLS for the pharmaceutical materials community.
HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
Instrumentation Development and Early Applications
A timeline of notable developments in BLS instrumentation and application is provided in Fig. 1 . Our historical perspective begins with the theoretical prediction of BLS published by the French physicist, Léon Brillouin, in 1922, “Diffusion de la lumiere et des rayons X par un corps transparent homogene: Influence de l’agitation thermique.” [ ] Highlighted in this work is the consideration of a volume element with a collection of atoms in thermodynamic equilibrium. The thermal motion (“thermal agitation”) of these atoms introduces a position and time-dependent fluctuation in local number density. These local density fluctuations may be decomposed into a Fourier series of periodic waves, i.e. , elastic heat (sound) waves or acoustic phonons. These sound waves generate a commensurate periodic fluctuation in the local dielectric that may scatter light. In many respects, this scattering mechanism is consistent with Bragg’s law; however, since the grating is moving (at the speed of sound for a given material) the particle motion may introduce a Doppler shift in the scattered light. However, unlike X-ray diffraction, the material itself is not required to demonstrate periodicity. This shift in frequency is referred to as the Brillouin shift, and in our review of BLS theory, we will arrive at the Brillouin shift equation that directly relates this frequency shift with the sound velocity. A few years later in 1926, an independent prediction of BLS was published by the Soviet physicist, Leonid Mandelstam. However, reports suggest that Mandelstam had developed his treatment well before Brillouin in 1918 and because of this, BLS is sometimes referred to as Brillouin-Mandelstam scattering [ ]. Fig. 1 A timeline of noteworthy reports in the instrumental development and application of Brillouin light scattering
Nearly a decade after Brillouin’s original report, the first experimental demonstration of BLS was provided by Gross in 1930 [ , ]. This demonstration followed shortly after the first experimental evidence of the Raman effect. In the first BLS experimental study by Gross, a series of simple liquids—aniline, toluene, benzene, water, ethyl alcohol, and ethyl ether—demonstrated unique frequency shifts. Thus, the fundamental intermolecular interactions that discriminate materials are characteristically reflected in the Brillouin shift. However, note that no information from BLS is provided for the chemical composition or molecular structure, but rather it is the interaction between chemical entities that BLS is especially informative of. This is particularly evident for solids whereby the strength of intermolecular interactions may be distinguished by their relative BLS shifts. Consequently, early research in BLS focused on understanding molecular motion and relaxation in fluids, anisotropic bonding in simple inorganic and organic solids, and phase transitions. Overall, BLS may be combined with chemical-specific spectroscopies (Raman scattering) to provide a comprehensive description of material form and function [ , , ].
Early BLS studies were still limited by the availability of a suitable light source. As with any spontaneous, weak-scattering method, sufficient photon flux through the scattering volume is required. Previous studies were constrained to using an Hg or Zn vapor lamp, but with the introduction of the maser, and shortly thereafter the laser, in the early 1960s, novel spectroscopic applications were soon to follow [ , , , ]. The BLS spectrometer developed by Chiao—laser, Fabry-Pérot interferometer, photomultiplier tube detection—is consistent with the present day BLS spectrometers; however, with improvements in each spectrometer element (particularly for the interferometry), our capacity to precisely measure hypersonic sound frequencies has improved dramatically [ ].
As introduced earlier, the small frequency shifts in BLS are resolved using interferometry. Although the Fabry-Pérot interferometer was well established by this time, one of the first demonstrations of this dispersive element for high-resolution frequency analysis in BLS was reported by the Indian scientist Venkateswaran in 1942 [ ]. With earlier versions of the Fabry-Pérot interferometer, the frequency sweep was adjusted by containing the set of mirrors within a pressure cavity and increasing/decreasing the pressure. Changing the pressure of the gaseous medium between the mirrors would change the refractive index, and consequently adjust the transmission frequency. This scanning mode was eventually replaced by piezoelectric scanning, whereby the physical mirror spacing was adjusted by applying a periodic, sawtooth, voltage ramp to a stack of piezoelectric materials that would cycle the mirror spacing. Each cycle generates one BLS spectrum within a given free spectral range, and depending upon the scattering intensity, multiple cycles would be summed together to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and generate the final BLS spectrum. For early spectrometers, this acquisition period would take hours, while present-day scanning BLS spectrometers have reduced this acquisition time to about 15–20 min.
An original BLS spectrometer to incorporate this scanning feature was reported by Sandercock for his Brillouin scattering study of the ferroelectric antimony iodosulfide (SbSI), and since then has become the standard operation for scanning interferometry in BLS [ ]. The experimental setup reported by Sandercock is reproduced in Fig. 2 a. There are two noteworthy features of this spectrometer: (1) the introduction of active stabilization and (2) multi-passing the interferometer to increase spectral contrast. An important feature introduced in this spectrometer was active stabilization, whereby the transmittance of the interferometer was continuously monitored and small correction voltages were applied to maintain mirror parallelism. After the introduction of the microprocessor, these stabilization signals were monitored by a computer for the precise control and manipulation without user intervention [ ]. Maintaining a stable interferometer transmittance over a time period necessary to acquire a complete BLS spectrum greatly supported the development of this technique. Fig. 2 a An original design of an actively stabilized, double-passed Fabry-Perot interferometer. Reproduced with permission from Opt. Commun . 2, 73 (1970). b An original design of a tandem, multi-passed interferometer contained on the same platform. Reproduced with permission from Polym. Bull. 5, 615 (1981)
The benefit of multi-passing, that is, recycling the transmitted light via multiple passes through the interferometer, is that the contrast increases exponentially with the number of passes [ ]. Ultra-high contrast permits the discrimination of very weak signals (the BLS resonances) even in the presence of a very strong signal (the Rayleigh line). A few years later, new design for tandem, multi-pass Fabry-Pérot interferometer for Brillouin scattering was reported by Dil [ ]. The strategy reported by Dil was an improvement in interferometry; however, synchronizing two independent interferometers requires exact timing control and potential for instrumental instability. As an alternative, Sandercock introduced an elegant solution (see Fig. 2 b) in the same year that combined a tandem interferometer onto the same platform [ ]. It is this spectrometer design that remains today as one of the leading scanning interferometers for BLS.
With the technology in place to accurately record BLS spectra for a suitable period of time, the applications of BLS began to expand—polymeric and amorphous material relaxation dynamics [ , , ], biomechanics of DNA [ ] and extracellular matrix proteins, the elasticity of spider silk [ ], Langmuir-Blodgett films [ ], NIR-based BLS for opaque materials [ ], and UV based for hydration dynamics [ ]—starting in the early 1980s and proceeding to the present day.
Brillouin Imaging
Notably, during the last decade, the development of BLS imaging spectrometers has proceeded at a rapid pace and has ushered in mechanical imaging as a unique visualization strategy. While BLS imaging is not currently employed in pharmaceutical material analysis, it is an important development in BLS and thus relevant to this review. An original application of BLS imaging was reported by Koski et al ., whereby an angle-dispersive Fabry-Pérot interferometer was used to image different polymeric materials in solution [ ]. The image contrast was generated from the intrinsic differences in the longitudinal Brillouin shift between the polymeric material and the solvent. Thus, mechanical imaging offers a non-label, non-destructive, means of imaging heterogeneous samples. A 3D, confocal, Brillouin imaging microscope with sub-micron spatial resolution was later developed based on the virtually imaged phased array (VIPA) [ ]. This approach boasts even faster spectral acquisition and improved sensitivity, and for transparent samples, the confocal sampling permits imaging 3D mechanics throughout the sample volume. Moreover, analogous to multi-passing a scanning interferometer, several VIPA etalons may be daisy chained together to significantly improve contrast, however, at the expense of reduced transmittance [ ].
Coupled with these advances in spectrometer design, the applications for BLS imaging have rapidly expanded into biomedical and biological materials research [ , , , , ]. These applications bear significant importance to (1) the pathological changes in tissue mechanics with disease progression, (2) regenerative medicine for confirming the mechanical integrity of newly grown tissue, and (3) single-cell stiffness measurements as a novel, biophysical, marker of metastatic potential in cancer cells. Aberrant changes in the tissue environment are often associated with disease progression: fibroses, liver cirrhosis, cancer, and atherosclerosis, all being common examples [ , , , ]. However, until recently, these changes in tissue stiffness have gone largely uncharacterized or qualitatively described. For example, an atherosclerotic vasculature loses its elasticity and responsiveness, and the magnitude and heterogeneity of this process have been quantified by Meng et al . using Brillouin imaging of the mechanical properties of aortic walls excised from rabbit’s on a high-fat diet [ ]. In a separate study, Antonacci et al . quantified the stiffness of plaques deposited in the left carotid artery of ApoE −/− mice [ ]. These mechanical images demonstrated that plaque deposition leads to a reduction in the mean Brillouin frequency shift (a reduction in local stiffness) and suggests a vulnerability to rupture under stress [ ]. Overall, the opportunity of using a sample’s intrinsic heterogeneity in mechanical properties as a non-label, imaging mode has significant promise as emerging clinical tool in biomedical imaging.
The biomechanical properties of tissue are important to its function and regeneration [ , , ]. For regenerating bone tissue, the mechanical properties of the newly formed tissue are centrally relevant, particularly for load-bearing bone, in the osseointegration process. An early application of micro-BLS to studying the elasticity of bone tissue was reported by Sakamoto et al . [ ]. For thin sections of bovine trabecular bone and collagen, the softer collagen component was distinguished from the stiffer trabeculae and cortical bone. Several years later, Mathieu et al . demonstrated that BLS could quantitatively distinguish between mature bone tissue and newly formed bone tissue surrounding an implant [ ]. Newly formed bone displayed an average acoustic velocity of 4966 m/s, while for mature bond, the sound speed was significantly higher at 5305 m/s. Lastly, a recent study by Akilbekova et al . demonstrated the combined efficacy of BLS and radiography in determining the ideal conditions for regenerative bone [ ]. In critical-size bone defects in the ulna of rabbits, a heparin-conjugated fibrin hydrogel was the host matrix for mesenchymal stem cell differentiation into osteoblasts using a combination of bone morphogenetic proteins, BMP-2 and BMP-7. At certain time periods, following the graft, the samples were subject to compressive loads and the BLS spectra were simultaneously collected. For grafted bone samples, the Brillouin peak frequency either decreased or was unchanged to compressive load, while for native bone, the acoustic frequency increased with increasing load. These results are consistent with the radiography results that indicate an incomplete mineralization of the grafted tissue, and further confirm the grafted bone tissue is mechanically distinct from native bone. This mechanical data is not available through traditional X-ray CT imagery alone, and the complementary approach promises unique insight into bone biomechanics and regeneration.
An aberrant disruption in the mechanical properties of tissue, or the extracellular matrix (ECM), translates to changes in cellular stiffness through cell-ECM adhesion interactions [ , , ]. Alternative cell-ECM adhesion interactions subsequently adjust the recruitment and composition of the developing focal adhesion which can adjust the cellular cytoskeleton through specific actin-binding proteins [ ]. These changes in the cytoskeletal architecture consequently result in changes to cell stiffness which can furthermore re-direct cell biology with potentially pathological consequences. Cell stiffness has thus emerged as a novel biomarker of cell status, and a typical example is the oncogenic transformation of healthy cells to a cancerous phenotype, which is generally associated with a cell softening [ , , ]. While multiple techniques are available for characterizing the mechanical properties of cells, AFM nanoindentation has been the gold standard in the measurement of cell stiffness for decades [ , , ]. A challenge with AFM nanoindentation, however, is the requirement for cell-probe contact during the measurement process. This necessarily restricts the cell-stiffness measurements to cells cultured in a 2D monolayer; however, growing evidence suggests that ECM dimensionality (2D to 3D) is an important biophysical regulator of cell function. Since BLS is a non-contact method for mechanical characterization, this technique offers direct access to cell stiffness measurements in their native, 3D microenvironment. An original demonstration of this measurement was provided by Scarcelli et al . for NIH 3T3 fibroblasts seeded into a 3D collagen matrix, and this is shown in Fig. 3 [ ]. The cytoskeletal, cellular response to changes in substrate stiffness, osmotic pressure, or cytochalasin D pretreatment (an actin destabilizer), all manifested as changes in cell stiffness determined using BLS. Since Scarcelli’s demonstration of measuring cell stiffness by BLS, multiple additional studies are furthermore demonstrated that BLS is uniquely suited to determining the mechanical properties of cells and sub-cellular structures [ , , ]. Overall, as cell stiffness develops into a novel biomarker of cell status and disease, the need for advanced cell stiffness measurements will continue to grow [ , ].

Nanomechanics and Drug Delivery
We conclude our historical summary with the recent application of BLS to characterize the mechanical properties of nanoparticles. Nanoparticles have revolutionized drug delivery applications; recently, the mechanical properties of these nanosized delivery systems have demonstrated significant influence over their in vivo performance: enabling endocytosis, increasing circulation half-life, and targeting [ , , ]. One of the earliest applications of BLS to nanomechanics was reported in 2003 by Kuok et al . for the characterization of silica nanospheres with diameters ranging from 200 to 340 nm [ ]. Since this seminal demonstration of BLS for characterizing the nanomechanics of particles, a variety of different polymeric and inorganic systems have been studied [ , , , ]. In each of these BLS studies, rather than observing specific, q -dependent, acoustic modes for a propagating wave, the acoustic waves are confined and give rise to a q -independent BLS. A representative BLS spectrum is provided in Fig. 4 . Each resonance corresponds to a specific mode of particle of deformation. Indeed, multiple resonances were observed and the intensity and frequency of these resonances were strongly dependent upon particle size. The theoretical formalism for this particle spectroscopy using BLS was developed by Love in the early nineteenth century for an elastically vibrating sphere [ ]. A primary determination of Love’s prediction is that the frequency of nanoparticle vibration is linearly proportional to the inverse of the particle’s diameter, and the slope of this linear relationship related to the longitudinal and transverse sound velocities. Once the sound velocities are known, it is a straightforward calculation to determine the mechanical properties of the particle. Fig. 4 a Brillouin scattering spectra for air-dried, silica spheres ( D = 340 nm) revealing multiple Brillouin doublets ( S = stokes, A = anti-Stokes) assigned to specific modes of a vibrating sphere. b The linear dependency of inverse particle diameter vs. vibrational frequency for multiple different modes ( n , l) for a vibrating sphere.

This linear relationship has been consistently demonstrated in previous BLS studies, and a representative example is shown in Fig. 4 from Kuok’s work on silica nanoparticles. Recently Mohapatra et al . detailed a comparative AFM and BLS analysis of the mechanical properties of a series of poly(styrene-N-isopropylacrylamide) microgels with particle diameters from 200 to 300 nm [ ]. It was demonstrated that two techniques sample the mechanical properties through distinct means, and while changes in surface cross-links would be sensitively reflected in AFM, it was the cross-linking in the particle core that influenced the final result determined from BLS. This sensitivity to either the core (or whole particle) or the surface is an important factor when determining whether particle mechanics demonstrate a significant size dependence.
Overall, for the pharmaceutical sciences, it is clear that BLS is positioned to address multiple research questions ranging from routine material characterization to fundamental mechanobiology and drug delivery. While the utility of BLS has been now established in a broad assortment of research communities, its application in pharmaceutical research remains sparse. This is a clear opportunity for BLS to provide needed mechanical data to better understand pharmaceutical materials and processability.
BLS THEORY AND KEY OBSERVABLES
A basic principle of spectroscopy is the interaction between electromagnetic (EM) radiation and matter. Depending upon the frequency (or energy) of the EM, a variety of resonances may occur leading to a change in the transmitted, reflected, or scattered light. Measurement of these changes subsequently provides a characteristic spectrum and permits rich access to molecular and/or material-level information. For BLS, the specific information is provided at the material level.
The classical mechanism of this inelastic scattering method is described by the Bragg diffraction from a propagating, periodic fluctuation in the local dielectric [ , , ]. For spontaneous BLS, these fluctuations are not induced, but rather arise from thermal motion. To begin this discussion, consider a collection of atoms in thermodynamic equilibrium with an average number density ( N ), and the number density N ( r , t ) fluctuates as a result of thermal motion. The complete number density may be written as Eq. ( 1 ),
$$ N\left(\boldsymbol{r},t\right)=N+\Delta N\left(\boldsymbol{r},t\right) $$ (1)
Light with wavevector ( k o ) and angular frequency (ω o ) incident upon this collection of atoms (dipoles) scatters through a direction k s and angular frequency (ω s ). The specific direction and frequency of this scattered light depends upon the motion (fluctuation) of the atoms with wavevector ( q ) and frequency (Ω). Taking the Fourier transform of ΔN( r , t ) gives us,
$$ \Delta N\left(\boldsymbol{r},t\right)={\iint}_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{d^3q}{{\left(2\pi \right)}^3}\frac{d\Omega}{2\pi}\Delta N\left(\boldsymbol{q},\Omega \right){e}^{-i2\pi \left(\boldsymbol{q}\bullet \boldsymbol{r}-\Omega t\right)} $$ (2)
Thus, the thermally induced fluctuation in the number density may be expressed as a superposition of phase gratings.
In a BLS experiment, the directions k o and k s are pre-defined by the user in a specific scattering geometry. Representative BLS spectra for a solid and liquid sample are shown in Fig. 5 . For a given scattering geometry, the direction of propagation can support three displacements: two transverse and one longitudinal. Thus, a BLS spectrum may contain at maximum three doublets corresponding to the anti-Stokes and Stokes-shifted transverse and longitudinal modes. For liquids, with no capacity to support shear, only a longitudinal mode is observed. Typically, k s is fixed and defined by the set of collection optics that collects the scattered light for entry into the interferometer. The incident light wavevector may be positioned at any arbitrary angle relative to k s , and combined together k o and k s are related to acoustic wave. A vector diagram of this scattering mechanism is provided in Fig. 6 for a traditional 90° scattering geometry. There are a variety of scattering geometries available distinguished by whether the scattered light is collected in reflection or transmission. Each has specific advantages and depending upon sample type (liquid vs. anisotropic solid) can help guide their selection. All scattering geometries used in BLS were previously reviewed by Krüger et al . [ ]. Regardless of the specific scattering geometry, all scattering events obey conservation of momentum (Eq. 3 ) and energy (Eq. 4 ), Fig. 5 Model BLS spectra for a a crystal sample indicating the three possible BLS modes ( L = longitudinal, T F = transverse fast, and T S = transverse slow) for a single-scattering geometry and b a liquid sample displaying the one longitudinal mode with a FWHM linewidth of Γ b Fig. 6 a A traditional 90° scattering geometry showing the relationship between the incident light wavevector ( k i ), the scattered light wavevector ( k s ) and the wavevector for the acoustic wave ( q b ). b The vector diagram displaying the conservation of momentum for a general BLS scattering event. The equations for momentum (top) and energy (bottom) conservation are shown to the right
$$ {\boldsymbol{k}}_{\boldsymbol{s}}={\boldsymbol{k}}_{\boldsymbol{o}}\pm {\boldsymbol{q}}_{\boldsymbol{b}} $$ (3)
$$ h{\nu}_s=h{\nu}_o\pm h{v}_b $$ (4)
These acoustic waves are sampled with incident light (typically visible wavelengths) on the order of 10 5 cm −1 . For scattering experiments, this incident light only interacts with modes that have a comparable wavelength. Considering a typical unit cell dimension of 10 Å, or equivalently 10 7 cm −1 , it becomes clear that the acoustic phonons sampled in BLS lie very close to the Brillouin-zone center, i.e. , in the long wavelength limits that q → 0. Without a loss of generality, we may apply the law of cosines to the momentum vector diagram displayed in Fig. 6 to arrive at,
$$ {q}_b^2={k}_i^2+{k}_s^2-2{k}_i{k}_s\mathrm{cos}\uptheta $$ (5)
For an isotropic material with refractive index ( n ), Eq. ( 5 ) reduces to,
$$ {q}_b=\frac{2n}{\lambda_o}\sin \left(\frac{\theta }{2}\right) $$ (6)
Using a typical refractive index of 1.4 and an incident wavelength of 532 nm, we find the maximum q b equals 0.005 nm −1 . By adjusting the scattering angle from 180 to 20° provides some experimental access to the dispersion in q with a lower q b bound of approximately 0.0008 nm −1 . Thus, depending upon the specific scattering geometry, the wavelength of the acoustic phonon sampled in BLS is typically between 200 and 1000 nm. Near the Brillouin zone center, a linear dispersion relationship exists between acoustic frequency and acoustic velocity such that we may write,
$$ {\nu}_b={q}_b{V}_b=\frac{2n{V}_b}{\lambda_o}\sin \left(\frac{\theta }{2}\right) $$ (7)
Equation ( 7 ) is the Brillouin shift equation that connects the BLS frequency shift (a raw measurement in BLS) with the acoustic sound velocity. Using a typical sound velocity of 3000 m/s for molecular solids, we find (for n = 1.4, λ o = 532 nm) that ν b is near 15 GHz, or just less than 0.5 cm −1 . Overall, this provides a general scope of the acoustic wavelength and frequency accessed by BLS. Later, in our discussion of single-crystal elasticity, we use these acoustic velocities to calculate the stiffness tensor. For optically anisotropic materials, the refractive indices for the incident directions are not required to be the same; thus, using Eq. ( 5 ), we arrive at,
$$ {\nu}_b=\frac{V_b}{\lambda_o}\sqrt{n_i^2+{n}_s^2-2{n}_i{n}_s\mathrm{cos}\uptheta} $$
We note further that the linewidth of the BLS resonance relates to acoustic damping and a loss modulus. As detailed by Xu et al ., for liquid samples, the full width at half-maximum intensity of the BLS resonance provides a measure of bulk (η B ) and shear (η S ) viscosity [ ].
$$ \frac{4{\pi}^2}{\rho}\left({\eta}_B+\frac{4}{3}{\eta}_S\right)=\frac{\Gamma_b}{q_b^2} $$ (8)
BLS INSTRUMENTATION
For any optical scattering method, there are at minimum three critical spectrometer elements: a light source, a dispersive element to resolve the energy-shifted light and a detector that converts the detected light into a measurable signal. For BLS, there is no commercially available spectrometer; however, by keeping these three central elements in mind, the construction of a BLS spectrometer, using components sourced from different vendors, is relatively straightforward. We restrict our discussion of instrumentation to spontaneous Brillouin scattering; however, impulsive stimulated Brillouin scattering has recently been described by Ballmann et al . [ ]. The primary distinction being that in stimulated Brillouin scattering, the acoustic wave is launched through interfering two focused beams from a pump laser. A follow-on probe laser is used to scatter from the launched acoustic wave. Since this stimulated approach does rely upon probabilistic, spontaneous scattering events, several advantages are afforded relative to traditional, Brillouin scattering: higher sensitivity, lower background (less contribution from Rayleigh scattering), and shorter acquisition times.
Regardless of the specific spectroscopy, the advantage of an in-lab constructed spectrometer is that the input optics may be tailored to your specific application, e.g. , anisotropic elasticity of single crystals (variable θ spectrometer), small samples (micro-Brillouin scattering), or 3D-imaging (confocal Brillouin scattering). To maximize the flexibility of use, multiple input optics may be coupled in a modular design and all interfaced to a single interferometer. Moreover, since the input optics for a Brillouin scattering spectrometer are similar to that used in Raman scattering, both BLS and Raman can be simultaneously recorded. The only difference is that after the light-sample interaction, a fraction of the scattered light is sent to a monochromator for separation of the Raman resonances, and the remaining scattered light is directed to an interferometer.
With regard to selecting an incident light source, the typical BLS application utilizes a light source in the visible wavelength regime nominally from 400 to 650 nm. In this color range, multiple laser choices are available; however, the laser choice should operate in a single TEM 00 mode (a single longitudinal mode) with a low MHz bandwidth. Available power is not a significant concern, as most BLS spectra are acquired at approximately 50 mW and below. One additional consideration for the laser is the reflectivity of the interferometer mirrors, which is a function wavelength. Your selected laser wavelength should be located within a wavelength region of stable reflectivity for the interferometer. As noted earlier, BLS may be performed at UV wavelengths; however, the specific interferometer design and optics need to be considered in conjunction with selecting these specialized BLS light sources. Representative examples of these specialized spectrometers may be found in the following references [ , ].
The previously highlighted technological advancements of Fabry-Pérot interferometer were necessary for the continued development of BLS. With selection of the interferometer, one must consider whether a scanning or non-scanning option is desired. Both provide sufficient resolution to observe the BLS resonances; however, each interferometer type has specific advantages and disadvantages with respect to the specific application. For scanning interferometry, the six-pass tandem interferometer developed by Sandercock has become the mainstay for BLS spectrometers. One primary advantage of the scanning interferometer is the flexibility in defining the free spectral range (FSR) by simple adjustment of the mirror spacing. For certain materials, the transverse acoustic modes may be very low in frequency and thus a larger mirror spacing (smaller FSR) helps to resolve these peaks from the Rayleigh line. Alternatively, the longitudinal acoustic mode may be at a higher frequency that extends past a given FSR resulting in an overlap between adjacent orders of transmission. Having the flexibility to adjust the FSR to clearly identify all the BLS modes is an advantage, particularly for single-crystal elasticity whereby several independent acoustic velocities need to be accurately determined. One final consideration is the detector, which necessarily is matched to the light source. Multiple options are available for detectors with high quantum efficiency and low dark count necessary for the detection of weak signals. The improved sensitivity of detectors has further contributed to reduce acquisition times. The basic construction of two BLS spectrometers, each employing either a scanning interferometer or VIPA etalon, is reproduced in Fig. 7 . Fig. 7 a A representative BLS spectrometer using a scanning Fabry-Perot interferometer for resolving the BLS resonances. Reproduced with permission from J. Chem. Phys. 118, 5224 (2003). b A representative BLS spectrometer using a VIPA for resolving the BLS resonances. Reproduced with permission from Nat. Photonics 2, 39 (2007)
Overall, for current BLS spectrometers, the typical error (assuming no bias and an accurate calibration) associated with frequency measurement is approximately 1–2%, while lineshape analysis for FWHM measures of hypersonic loss is more prone to error with typical errors being 5–10%. Depending upon the finesse of the interferometer, the frequency resolution is typically on the order of 10–100 MHz. The multi-passed scanning interferometer maintains higher contrast than the original VIPA-based spectrometer; however, notable improvements have been made to improve the contrast of BLS imaging spectrometers without sacrificing acquisition time or insertion loss [ , , ]. The time required to acquire a BLS spectrum is the primary distinction between these two BLS spectrometer classes. Since the VIPA-based spectrometer utilizes an angular dispersion (no moving parts like a scanning interferometer requires), its acquisition time is significantly reduced to on the order of 1 s. While for the scanning interferometer, a typical BLS spectrum is the sum of 500–2000 individual scans that collectively takes on the order of several minutes to acquire.
CURRENT APPLICATIONS OF BLS
Single-Crystal Elasticity for Low-Symmetry Materials
In the elastic regime, materials deform irreversibly and upon removal of the stress, the material regains its original shape. For isotropic materials, this elastic deformation may be completely described by two independent constants, a Young’s modulus (E) and a shear modulus (G), that bear no directional sensitivity given the material, are isotropic. The linear relationship for low-symmetry materials remains the same; however, the number of independent elastic constants increases with decreasing symmetry to fully capture and describe the deformation [ , ]. The elasticity relationship between stress and strain for a body of arbitrary symmetry is described by Hooke’s law,
$$ {\sigma}_{ij}={C}_{ij kl}{\varepsilon}_{kl} $$ (9) Whereby the second-order strain tensor ( ε kl ) is related to the second-order stress tensor ( σ ij ) through the fourth-order stiffness tensor ( C ijkl ). Typically, the elements of the stiffness tensor are expressed in Voigt notation ( C ij ) with the specific reduction scheme that takes C ijkl → C ij discussed by Nye [ ]. The stiffness elements are symmetric with respect to index, for example, C ij = C ji . Moreover, since the stiffness tensor (and the compliance tensor, S ij , which is the inverse of C ij ) is a matter tensor, it conforms to the symmetry of the crystalline lattice. Higher lattice symmetry acts to reduce the number of independent C ij . For determining a complete C ij using BLS, the number of independent C ij establishes the minimum number of independent sound velocities required to be measured. Approximately 95% of all organic molecules crystallize into either an orthorhombic, monoclinic, or triclinic lattice. For example, a triclinic system with 21 unknown elastic constants would require a minimum of 21 sound velocities. Since at maximum, there are 3 available sound velocities to a given scattering geometry, then to generate 21 sound velocities would require a minimum of 7 symmetrically independent scattering geometries. The addition of a twofold symmetry axis for monoclinic materials reduces the C ij further to 13 independent elements and finally the three twofold axes for an orthorhombic lattice has 9 independent C ij elements [ ]. In practice, however, the C ij is over-determined and measuring a maximum possible number of independent sound velocities help ensure a robust C ij determination.
The procedure for determining single crystal C ij begins with a crystallographic characterization of the sample. Being an optical technique, BLS has an advantage that the anisotropic mechanical properties for small samples may be determined. This is a relevant consideration because single-crystal growth, particularly at the many millimeter scale, can be unpredictable and a significant time investment with no guarantee of success. Once suitable crystals are harvested, the individual crystal facets are assigned Miller indices, assuming the unit cell for your crystal sample is already known. This assignment allows orientation of the lab coordinate frame relative to the crystallographic frame.
Using this information, a set of unique scattering geometries may be constructed to access a maximal number of unique sound velocities. For each scattering geometry, a combination of polarization (vertical and horizontal for both incident and scattered light) VV, VH, HV, and HH can assist in correctly assigning the BLS resonances as longitudinal or transverse. Furthermore, backscattering from each, non-symmetrically related crystal facet will provide a unique longitudinal mode per facet. As previously mentioned, collecting a maximal number of distinct sound velocities will assist in the determining a complete stiffness tensor.
The wavelength of the acoustic phonon sampled in BLS is several hundred nanometers, or alternatively several hundreds of unit cells; thus, the material is being probed at a mesoscopic level. Under this long-wavelength approximation, the material is modeled as a continuum, and the equation of motion for a propagating acoustic wave may be written as,
$$ \rho \frac{\partial^2{u}_i}{\partial {t}^2}={C}_{ijkl}\frac{\partial^2{u}_l}{\partial {r}_j\partial {r}_k} $$ (10)
Which relates the density ( ρ ) and the i th component of the molecular displacement about its equilibrium position ( u i ) to its spatial derivatives through the stiffness tensor C ijkl . Substituting a plane wave solution into Eq. ( 10 _ and using the long-wavelength approximation yields the set of equations,
$$ \left[{C}_{ijkl}{q}_k{q}_l-\rho {V}^2{\delta}_{im}\right]{u}_m^o=0 $$ (11)
In which, the q i is the appropriate direction cosines for the specific acoustic phonon q referenced to the lab-frame Cartesian system and with polarization u m . Nontrivial solutions arise from the Christoffel determinant,
$$ \left|\begin{array}{ccc}{\lambda}_{11}-\rho {V}^2& {\lambda}_{12}& {\lambda}_{13}\\ {}{\lambda}_{12}& {\lambda}_{22}-\rho {V}^2& {\lambda}_{23}\\ {}{\lambda}_{13}& {\lambda}_{23}& {\lambda}_{33}-\rho {V}^2\end{array}\right|=0 $$ (12) where the individual λ ij elements are provided by Cummins [ ]. As an example, λ 11 for a material with general symmetry is,
$$ {\lambda}_{11}={q}_x^2{C}_{11}+{q}_y^2{C}_{66}+{q}_z^2{C}_{55}+2{q}_y{q}_z{C}_{56}+2{q}_x{q}_z{C}_{15}+2{q}_x{q}_y{C}_{16} $$ (13)
The remaining λ ij elements are also combination of direction cosines and C ij elements. Three eigenvalues of the Christoffel determinant are provided for a given q . This is consistent with the expectation that a given propagation direction can support three distinct displacement polarizations. If the C ij for a given material are already known, then calculating the sound velocities (transverse and longitudinal) for a given direction is straightforward.
When determining the C ij for a material, the two primary inputs are the directions and measured velocities for all scattering geometries used. This data is input into a least-square minimization routine that back solves the Christoffel determinant for determining a set of C ij that most accurately reproduces the input data. If certain pure phonon directions ([001, 010, 100]) are available, this facilitates the data minimization, but importantly, the data set should include a thorough sampling of xy , yz , and xz planes. If the input data were restricted to the xy plane, any C ij element associated with the z -direction would bear significant error.
Accurately, determining a complete stiffness tensor for low-symmetry materials is a challenging task; consequently, elasticity data for molecular solids is limited. It is important to establish this data, particularly with respect to the anisotropic mechanical properties, for understanding the complex deformation of pharmaceutical materials under the stresses encountered during processing. Formation of suitably robust tablets, milling to reduce particle size, and stress-induced phase transformations are all examples of processes sensitive to the mechanical properties of the material. An example of this connection is provided by Karki et al ., whereby the tableting performance of a series of acetaminophen co-crystals were interpreted using calculated stiffness tensors [ ]. Those materials with weakly bonded shear planes demonstrated high values of compliance and improved tabletability. A similar observation was reported by Beyer et al . when comparing the calculated C ij for acetaminophen polymorphs Form I and Form II. Consistent with the layered crystal structure of acetaminophen Form II, specific elements of the stiffness tensor indicated directions of facile shear [ ]. Building upon these studies, a complete set of C ij permits calculation of all mechanical moduli and their directional sensitivity [ , ]. Combined with crystallographic data, this provides direct insight into the structure-mechanics relationship. To date, however, the stiffness tensor for carbamazepine represents the only pharmaceutical with an experimentally determined C ij using BLS [ ].
Comparison with Alternative Methods
There are a variety of methods available for characterizing the C ij of molecular solids, including, pulse-echo ultrasound, resonant ultrasound spectroscopy, AFM nanoindentation, and Brillouin scattering [ , , ]. As will be discussed, each of these have their own advantages and disadvantages. Both ultrasonic methods require larger single crystals (on the several millimeter scales) and the manufacturing of specific crystal facets. Large, single-crystal growth is generally a trial-and-error process that requires a supersaturated solution with minimal sites for nucleation. Indeed, for RUS, the harvested single crystal is then manufactured into defined geometry, for example, a parallelepiped or a cylinder. Since this technique uses normal modes of an elastic body to determine the elastic properties, errors in the prepared sample’s dimensions translate directly to errors in the final C ij determination.
For AFM nanoindentation, the primary advantage is its high spatial resolution and its capacity for accommodating small crystalline samples. The experimental design is, however, restricted to a vertical geometry with the sample placed under the probe. With the elastic properties of the AFM tip known, the force-displacement curve may be used to determine a reduced Young’s modulus for the material. Multiple sites on a given crystal facet may be sampled; however, generally, multiple crystal facets are not accessible to an AFM experiment. Since organic molecular solids can display significant elastic anisotropy, determining Young’s modulus in the direction normal to one crystal facet may not be consistent with Young’s modulus for an alternative direction.
For BLS, the primary distinction from these competing technologies is that this is an optical method for determining the mechanical properties. Immediately, all the benefits of an optical technique translate to BLS: non-contact, non-destructive, and applicability to small crystalline samples. Moreover, through the selection of multiple scattering geometries and a sufficient sampling in q may be achieved to robustly determine the C ij for low-symmetry materials. All crystal facets are available to a backscattering geometry; however, in this geometry, only the longitudinal modes are accessible. Even if the requisite minimum of sound velocities could be obtained for a given crystal symmetry, the resultant C ij would still remain biased because a longitudinal only data set would not adequately sample the Christoffel determinant. Using combinations of crystal facets for k i and k s , allows more sound velocity directions to be sampled and furthermore permits the observation of transverse modes. This is necessary for determining a complete C ij . This is particularly relevant for organic molecular solids because to fully describe the elastic deformation a complete C ij is necessary. We note that apart from the mechanical properties of single crystals, the optical nature of BLS is exploited for other applications: tissue imaging, nanoparticles elasticity, and single-cell stiffness that most other techniques are challenged to provide.
Polycrystalline Materials
To address the challenge of lacking mechanical data for molecular solids, a powder-based BLS approach was developed. The general scheme of powder BLS (p-BLS) is contrasted with traditional BLS in Fig. 8 . Single-crystal data remains paramount for understanding the contribution of specific intermolecular forces to the mechanical properties of molecular solids; however, powdered materials are more industrially relevant, and thus the averaged mechanical properties are germane to tabletability. While various models—Voigt, Reuss, Voigt-Reuss-Hill—are available for averaging single-crystal elasticity data into a polycrystalline modulus, the results of these approaches can diverge significantly depending upon the mechanical anisotropy. Extending BLS to powdered materials has recently become available with improved multi-pass interferometry and efficient rejection of the elastically scattered light. Hernandez et al . reported the BLS spectra of powdered salt, salol, and polystyrene [ ]. Rather than discrete modes observed in single-crystal studies, a distribution of acoustic modes is observed; however, in none of the reported powder, BLS spectra were the transverse frequencies clearly observed. These modes arise from multiple scattering events that consequently generate the full range of acoustic modes to contribute to the p-BLS spectrum. As an illustration of this distribution Fig. 9 contrasts the BLS spectra for solid and powdered polystyrene. For such material, a resonant peak with frequency ( ν peak ) is observed at a scattering angle (θ = 180°) for a solid block. For bulk polystyrene, however, due to multiple scattering, a distribution of scattering angles becomes accessible and their contribution is observed as the frequency tailing toward the Rayleigh line [ ].

Singaraju et al . observed the presence of two frequency distributions: shear and longitudinal, wherein the longitudinal distribution is characterized by a high-frequency cutoff. This high-frequency cutoff represents the fastest sound frequency in the material or alternatively the direction of strongest intermolecular interactions. Combining single crystal and powder BLS provides an ability to distinguish which specific direction and combination of intermolecular interactions that underscores this fastest sound speed. Moreover, for low-symmetry materials, the breadth of the acoustic distribution provides a measure of elastic anisotropy and the relative strength of intermolecular interactions. As shown in Fig. 10 , previous studies using materials with known single-crystal C ij allowed prediction of the acoustic frequency distributions for aspirin and anthracene [ ]. Overlaying these predictions with the experimentally obtained p-BLS spectra supported the physical interpretation of the two distributions. Furthermore, Singaraju et al . identified three characteristic frequencies ( ν L, max , ν sep , and ν T, min ) from the p-BLS spectra that can be reproducibly assigned using specific and readily identifiable characteristics of the p-BLS spectrum [ ]. While the frequency ν L, max corresponds to the high-frequency cutoff for the longitudinal distribution, the frequency ν sep corresponds to the frequency of separation between the longitudinal and the shear distributions. For some materials, the lowest transverse frequency cannot be accessed due to limitations in resolution from the Rayleigh line, thus the frequency corresponding to the highest intensity in the transverse frequency distribution is referred to as ν T,min .

Aggregate Mechanical Moduli
Mechanical properties of organic solids are of major interest to the compaction performance of pharmaceutic materials. The crystal structure of pharmaceutical materials has a governing effect on the compaction performance and it is expected that the mechanical properties might provide valuable information to make a priori predictions of tabletability. However, determining the structure-mechanics relationship for molecular solids remains challenging. As an initial validation of the mechanical data provided from p-BLS, Singaraju et al . calculated the engineering moduli (Young’s modulus, shear modulus, longitudinal modulus, and bulk modulus) for powdered aspirin using p-BLS analyses. These moduli obtained from p-BLS were in good agreement with those obtained from other techniques like beam bending and resonant ultrasound spectroscopy. With further validation, p-BLS could provide a much-needed source of mechanical data for understanding tabletability. Overall, this technique offers many advantages for determining the mechanical properties of powders. First, no sample preparation, apart from sieving to reduce the particle size, is needed. This technique is also material sparing with 50-mg samples being typical. Lastly, the spectra have short acquisition times, and thus the mechanical data provided by p-BLS does not introduce a significant time investment.
This p-BLS approach was further extended to a series of p-aminobenzoic acid and paraben esters [ ]. The compressibility of these materials followed the same rank order as that of Young’s modulus. Moreover, a good correlation between the shear modulus, yield pressures from Heckel plot, and attachment energies from computational studies was observed. Particularly, low-velocity shear modes in the p-BLS spectra were observed for materials that exhibited a layered crystal structure with strong intra-layer and weak interlayer interactions. This observation was consistent with the low shear modulus observed for these materials indicating a specific direction with lower resistance to plastic deformation. Materials with an isotropic distribution of intermolecular forces in three dimensions exhibited greater resistance to deformation as evident from high Young’s and shear modulus. This is further consistent with the elasticity studies reported by Karki et al . and Beyer et al . [ , ]. Computational studies corroborated these findings with greater attachment energies relative to the materials with layered structures. In this regard, characteristic frequencies were further applied to determine porosity-independent, aggregate elasticity moduli of powdered materials for interpreting molecular/structural origin of slip-mediated plasticity and compaction performance.
FUTURE PHARMACETUICAL APPLICATIONS
A continuing interest in pharmaceutical solids is understanding the relationship between the interaction topology (strength and distribution of intermolecular interactions) and the bulk properties expressed. An improved understanding of this structure-function relationship provides support to crystal engineering efforts that gainfully employ basic design principles to guide molecular assembly for ultimately a targeted function. A specific interest to the pharmaceuticals, crystal engineering may be employed to improve solubility, stability, and processability of the drug substance [ , , ]. Strong intermolecular interactions or synthons (acid-acid or acid-amide) have been the point of discussion in understanding the function of materials for a while. As the crystal engineering field matures, the focus has shifted to the weak hydrogen bonds, halogen bonds, and the dispersive forces [ ]. Strong intermolecular forces are informative to local molecular docking; however, it is the weak intermolecular forces that generally prescribe the extended assembly; thus, these weaker molecular forces are particularly important for understanding material function. Singaraju et al . observed that for a series of nitrobenzoic acid derivatives, where the strong carboxylic acid dimer was conserved across the series, the structure and mechanical properties of the materials were dramatically affected by the reorganization of the weak C–H … O interactions [ ].
The effect of the extended organization was further evident in the p-BLS spectra. Materials that possessed an extended organization of intermolecular interactions displayed tailing in the longitudinal distribution. For materials with a quasi-isotropic distribution of intermolecular forces, the longitudinal distributions were narrower, similar to the p-BLS spectrum of aspirin. Further, Young’s moduli ranged from 9.8 to 13.5 GPa indicating that subtle changes in molecular structure and packing can lead to very different mechanical properties. These examples demonstrate the ability of p-BLS to capture minor changes in the organization of intermolecular interactions and elastic anisotropy that have significant effect on material function.
Anisotropy of intermolecular interactions plays a pivotal role in understanding the deformation behavior, and ultimately the mechanical properties of organic solids. In this regard, quantifying the strength of interactions is very important. Information from p-BLS spectrum can be used for this purpose. For example, a novel parameter M max , the maximum longitudinal modulus was introduced by Singaraju et al . to explain the compactibility of a series of nitrobenzoic acid derivatives [ ]. This value corresponded to the direction in which the strongest intermolecular interactions were present. This was further confirmed by using urea as an example. By virtue of the extended network of N–H … O interactions in urea, the p-BLS spectrum displayed broad, high-frequency tailing in the longitudinal distribution with a high cutoff frequency. The longitudinal modulus in this direction of strong hydrogen bonding was over 50 GPa, which is remarkably stiff for a molecular solid [ ].
Layered structures have been an element of discussion especially when it comes to powder compaction of organic solids. It is expected that the strong intra-layer and weak interlayer nature of intermolecular forces would lead to an anisotropic solid with superior compression properties due facile shear and improved plasticity. The p-BLS spectrum for these materials are further characterized by both low transverse frequencies (low resistance to shear) and high longitudinal cutoff frequencies. This is consistent with the anisotropic distribution of intermolecular forces for a 2D-layered crystal structure. For example, the superior compressibility of the layered cocrystals of theophylline with either 4-fluoro-3-nitrobenzoic acid or acetaminophen was explained by the presence of the abovementioned characteristics that could have resulted in greater degree of anisotropy for the cocrystals [ ]. Similar characteristics were observed for the paraben esters [ ]. These studies showed that apart from the crystal structure, it is the interaction topology of molecular solids that contributes to its material properties and compaction performance. Thus, elasticity data, used as a reflection of this interaction topology, may serve as a novel discriminant to readily identify materials with superior tableting performance. A combination of single crystal and powder BLS would be especially supportive to establishing this connection.
Phase identification and selection is an early, upstream step in the development of a pharmaceutical product. Polymorph and cocrystal screening generally is accomplished using conventional solid-state techniques such as differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (ss-NMR). However, a similar screening may be anticipated using p-BLS. The acoustic distributions obtained from p-BLS serve as a quantifiable and objective measure of the interaction topology. Thus, hydrate formation, polymorphic transformations, and cocrystallization, all result in a redistribution of the intermolecular interactions that would consequently be reflected in the p-BLS spectra. In the event of unsuccessful cocrystal formation, it would be reasonable to observe the p-BLS spectrum for the API or the coformer. Like DSC, this technique, apart from confirming the cocrystal formation, provides crucial information about the cocrystal. As DSC provides information about melting and eutectic events that are crucial for processing, p-BLS provides information about the material mechanics and interaction topology of the cocrystal.
Combining p-BLS with into a VIPA-based platform would enable rapid, in-line monitoring of phase stability analogous to current Raman, and NIR-based process analytical technologies (PATs). With mounting interest in continuous manufacturing, rapid, stable, and discriminative PAT methods will continue to refine and evolve to suit a growing demand. During the processing, phase stability may be further monitored using p-BLS to ensure consistent quality of the manufactured drug product.
CONCLUSIONS
Nearly, a century has passed since the initial theoretical prediction of Brillouin light scattering, yet despite similarities to Raman scattering, a well known and broadly implemented scattering technique in pharmaceutical materials characterization, the adoption of BLS has considerably lagged behind. The primary distinguishing element that separates a Raman spectrometer from a BLS spectrometer is the dispersive element. Provided the small frequency associated with BLS (< 5 cm −1 ) an interferometer is required to resolve the BLS resonances from the elastically scattered Rayleigh line. Technological advancements in interferometer design and stabilization now provide the capacity to record accurate BLS spectra from a variety of sample types. This has expanded the application of BLS in multiple research areas; however, the opportunity for application to pharmaceutical materials is open and promising. Mechanical data is limited for pharmaceuticals, but critical to understanding tablet formation. Single-crystal BLS provides detailed mechanical data ( C ij ) with a complete description of elastic anisotropy. Previous theoretical studies suggest that specific directions of facile shear aid tabletability through facilitating slip-mediated plasticity. Combining this mechanical data with structural data will support improved models of structure mechanics for crystal engineering new materials with cocrystallization to deliberately improve tabletability.
The recent development of powder BLS provides the entire acoustic frequency distribution and aggregate mechanical moduli in 20 min and only small samples (50 mg) required. Moreover, the acoustic frequency distributions are expected to inherently reflect the elastic anisotropy of the material. This anisotropy may further be important to screening/identifying phases at an early developmental stage for optimum processability. While the application of BLS to pharmaceutical materials characterization has been limited, the significant development of BLS over the past 10 years supports the prospect of new applications for BLS is pharmaceutical materials characterization remains bright.
