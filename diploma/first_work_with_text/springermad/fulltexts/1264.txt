Introduction
Lung cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide and majority of which are NSCLC’s [ , , ]. Although the targeted molecular therapies on NSCLC have demonstrated great potential, the incidence of NSCLC is growing and the long term survival rate is still not satisfied [ ]. In US, 2.2 million new cases of lung cancer emerged in 2015 and in the same year 1.58 million died from the disease, accounting for around 27% of all cancer deaths occurred due to that year. Lung cancer is the most common cancer amongst men in India with approximately 33,000 new cases ever year. Lung cancer constitutes 6.8% deaths in India [ ]. Asper the study done by Arshad et al. Lung cancer is the second most common cancer type in men and third among all (14.6%) in Kashmir valley [ ]. NSCLC arise by a stepwise acquisition of genetic and epigenetic alterations concomitantly with morphological changes as well that gives rise to the transformation of benign bronchial epithelium into neoplastic tissue. Recently, Hippo signal pathway was discovered in Drosophila melanogaster which controls organ size by regulating the expression of genes that promote cell survival, stemness and cell proliferation [ , ]. The core effector molecules of this pathway are highly conserved in mammals that include Mst1/2 ; WW45; LATS1/2; Mob1; YAP; TAZ; NF; FRMD6 ; and Fat4 . Two mammalian homologs of fly LATS genes; LATS1 and LATS2 were shown functionally as tumor suppressors because of their regulation of cellular homeostasis and cellular apoptosis [ ]. Loss of function of either LATS1 or LATS2 leads to a variety of tumor types including soft tissue sarcomas, leukemia, as well as breast, prostate, lung and esophageal cancers. Mechanistic studies concerning LATS1 revealed that it is a tumor suppressor gene and might control tumorigenesis by negatively regulating the cell cycle [ , ]. Reduced expression of LATS1 is connected with deregulation of SWH, thus activating the YAP or TAZ oncogene [ , ]. LATS2 has a role in the maintenance of mitotic fidelity and genomic stability, since LATS−/− mutant embryonic cells exhibit an increased frequency of cytokinetic defects, accumulation of micronuclei, supernumerary centrosomes and aneuploidy [ , ]. LATS2 also functions as an inducer of apoptosis through down-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-family [ ]. Both LATS1 and LATS2 are hypermethylated in astrocytoma [ ] as well as acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ ], NSCLC [ ], breast cancer [ ] and associated with poor prognosis.
A number of studies have shown the diagnostic and prognostic potential of the central kinases LATS1 and LATS2 and their role in patient survival in relation to lung cancer patients and all the research findings strongly suggest hypermethylation as most common cause for under expression of LATS1 and LATS2 genes [ ]. To our knowledge no such study focusing on alteration of LATS1 and LATS2 genes has been carried out in Kashmir valley (Northern part of India) on lung cancer. So, we pursued this study for the first time from this part of the world to elucidate the methylation of promoter regions and expression status of the of LATS1 and LATS2 genes inNSCLC patientsand to derive a more precise association between the epigenetic alterations/expression of LATS1 and LATS2 genes with overall lung cancer development, progression and patient survival.
Material and Methods
Tissue Samples
A total of sixty nine ( n = 69) freshly diagnosed NSCLC patients who underwent complete resection between January 2013 to August 2015 at Sher-I-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences (SKIMS), Soura, Srinagar were included in the study. The tumor tissue and their adjacent normal tissues were taken and properly stored for further processing. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of SKIMS, Soura, India. Informed consent was obtained from all patients for specimen collection.
DNA Extraction
Total genomic (g) DNA was extracted from tissue specimens using quick gDNA Miniprep kit (Zymo Research, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. DNA concentrations were calculated using a Nano Drop 2000c Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Asheville, NC, USA).
Methylation-Specific PCR (MSP)
Sodium bisulphite modification of gDNA was performed using EZ DNA Methylation-Gold Kit (Zymo Research, USA). Methylation status in the CpG islands of LATS1 and LATS2 promoter regions was determined by methylation-specific PCR [ ]. Bisulfite-modified DNA was amplified with primers specific for methylated or unmethylated sequences. The methylated DNA of LATS1 was amplified using methylated (M) set of primers, 5′-GGAGTTTCGTTTTGTC-3 (sense), 5-CGACGTAATAACGAACGC CTA-3 (antisense), and the unmethylated DNA of LATS1 was amplified using unmethylated (U) set of primers, 5-TAGGTTGGAGTGTGGTGGT-3 (sense), 5-CCCAACATAATAACAAACACCT-3 (anti-sense); the methylated DNA of LATS2 was amplified using M set primers, 5-ATTTCGGTTTATTGTAATTTTC-3 (sense), 5-AACCAACATAATAAAACCCCG-3 (antisense), and the unmethylated DNA of LATS2 was amplified using U set primers, 5-TTTGTTTTTTGGGTTTAAGT-3 (sense), 5-CCAACATAATAAAACCCC A-3 (antisense). The Universal Human methylated and non-methylated DNA (Zymo Research, USA) were used as positive and negative control respectively. Two microliters of bisulfite-modified DNA was amplified in a total volume of 25 μL containing 10× PCR buffer 2.5 μL (Fermentas, USA), 10 mmol/L dNTP 0.5 mL, 10 mmol/L of each primer 0.5 mL, and 5 U/mL Taq DNA polymerase0.1 μL (Fermentas, USA). Methylation-specific PCR reaction conditions of LATS1 and LATS2 were as follows: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min, 40 cycles of amplification at 95 °C for30 s, 58 °C (methylated) or 50 °C (unmethylated) for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, followed by a final extension of 72 °C for 10 min.
RNA Extraction and Reverse Transcription
Total RNA was extracted from snap-frozen tissues using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA treated with DNase ( NEBS , USA) was purified by using RNAeasy mini kit (Quiagen, Hilden, Germany). Subsequently, RNA was eluted in 30 μl of the RNA storage solution (Ambion, USA) and stored at −80 °C. The total RNA was quantified by a NanoDrop 2000c Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Asheville, NC, USA).cDNA synthesis was carried out using the Revert-Aid H minus cDNA synthesis kit (Fermentas, USA).
Real-Time RT-PCR
For real time PCR analysis, the following primer sequences were used: 5′-GACTGACTTTGGCCTCTGCA-3′(sense), 5′-CCACATCGACAGCTTGAGGG-3′ (antisense) for LATS1 ; 5′-TAGAGCAGAGGGCGCGGAAG-3′ (antisense), 5′-CCAACACTCCACCAGTCACAGA-3′ (antisense) for LATS2 ; 5′-AGAAGGCTGGGGCTCATTTTG-3′ (sense), 5′-AGGGGCCATCCACAGTCTTC-3′ (antisense) for endogenous control, beta actin. Two (02) μL of the dilution of the reverse transcriptase reaction was amplified in the 20 μL reaction including the 2× SYBR Green ROX Mixes 10 μL (Fermentas, USA), 20 μM of each primer 0.25 mL and H 2 O 7.5 μL. The reaction was run in the ABI 7500 Real time PCR Systems (Applied Biosystems, USA). Reaction conditions included a hot start (15 min, 95 °C), followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C, 15 s and 60 °C, 60 s). Melt curve analysis was performed to ensure a single product species. Parallel reactions were performed using primers to Beta Actin as an internal control.
Statistical Analysis
Correlation between promoter hypermethylation, expression and clinicopathological parameters was analyzed by χ 2 test. Multivariate survival analysis was performed on all parameters using the Cox regression model. Survival curves were assessed by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by the log-rank test. Two-sided P ≤ 0.05 age and sex adjusted were considered statistically significant. All analysis were performed with the SPSS 16.0 software package.

Methylation Status of LATS1 and LATS2 Genes and their Correlation with Clinicopathological Parameters
Methylation status of LATS1 and LATS2 genes were analyzed in sixty nine ( n = 69) NSCLC tissues by methylation-specific PCR. Of all NSCLC samples, 46(66.66%), and 49(71%) of LATS1 and LATS2 promoter regions were found hypermethylated as compared to normal tissue where hypermethylation was not found in any tissue sample. Among various Clinicopathological characteristic, LATS1 promoter hypermethylation was statistically significant only with smoking [Adj. OR = 4.24 (1.35–13.27), P = 0.013]. However, LATS2 promoter hypermethylation was statistically significant with large tumor size [Adj. OR = 4.08 (1.234–16.50), P = 0.038], smoking [Adj. OR = 5.88 (1.71–20.23), P = 0.011] and positive lymph node metastasis [Adj. OR = 6.73, (1.54–29.35), P = 0.011] (Table 2 ).

mRNA Expression Status of LATS1 and LATS2 Genes and their Correlation with Clinicopathological Parameters
Furthermore, real time expression analysis revealed decreased expression of LATS1 in 55% of the cases and the LATS1 mRNA expression was significantly lower in cases with lymph node metastasis [Adj. OR = 10.20 (2.53–41.11), P = 0.001], smoking history [Adj. OR = 4.09 (1.33–12.54), P = 0.014] and large tumor size [Adj. OR = 4.02, (1.31–12.38), P = 0.015]. Also, LATS2 mRNA expression was decreased in 66.66% of the lung cancer cases. A statistical significance was observed in cases with lymph node metastasis [Adj. OR = 8.34 (2.00–34.64), P = 0.003] and tumor size [Adj. OR = 3.89 (1.12–13.52), P = 0.032] for the decreased expression of LATS2 mRNA in tumor tissues as compared to the normal (Table 3 ).

Relationship of Methylation of LATS1 and LATS2 with their mRNA Expression
LATS1 and LATS2 mRNA expression was compared between tumors with and without hypermethylation. Both LATS1 and LATS2 mRNA expression was significantly lower in NSCLC tissues with hypermethylation than those without hypermethylation ( P = 0.005 for LATS1 and P = 0.001 for LATS2 ) (Table 4 ).

LATS1 and LATS2 mRNA Expression and Survival
To find clinically useful prognostic factors, we performed univariate analysis for the effect of LATS1 and LATS2 hypermethylation and their mRNA expression and various clinicopathological characteristics on survival. Decreased LATS1 mRNA, clinical stage, lymph node metastasis, age, sex and smoking were the prognostic factors affecting the survival significantly (Table 5 ). The crude hazard ratio (HR) of low LATS1 mRNA expression compared with high mRNA expression was 2.82 (95% CI = 1.57–5.07), which indicates that the low mRNA expression may increase the hazard of lung cancer-related deaths by almost three times that of high LATS1 expression. In case of LATS2 mRNA expression, there was a direction effect towards poor overall survival with low LATS2 mRNA but it was not statistically significant. We then performed the multivariate analysis for those factors whose presence significantly affected prognosis and for demographic factors like age and sex (Table 5 ). The results showed that low LATS1 mRNA expression were significantly related to prognosis and were independent of age, sex and lymph node metastasis [Adj. HR = 4.29 (1.96–9.35), P = 0.001].

Kaplan-Meier Estimate of Survival for Surgically Resected NSCLC Patients
We performed the Kaplan-Meier estimate of survival of resected NSCLC patients with or without LATS1/LATS2 hypermethylation and normal or low LATS1/LATS2 mRNA expression. Only LATS1 under-expression had a profound effect of decreasing the patient survival significantly ( P < 0.001). The mean overall survival was 50 months for patients with normal LATS1 mRNA expression and for patients with low mRNA LATS1 it was 39 months, respectively (Fig. 1 ). Fig. 1 Overall survival curve with LATS1 Expression
Discussion
In this study, the promoter region of LATS1 was hyper-methylated as high as 66.66% (46/69). This was quite comparable to the frequencies reported in astrocytoma (63.66%) and NSCLC (79.8%) [ , ]. However, in colorectal cancer, breast cancers [ ] and in head and neck cancers the methylation frequencies were reported to be 57%, 56.70% and 24% respectively [ ] which is less than the frequency found in NSCLC. In addition, among the various Clinico-pathological characteristics only the patients with smoking history showed statistical significance with LATS1 promoter hypermethylation in NSCLC’s and results are in concordance with the study carried out by Sasakiet al. who reported the promoter hypermethylation to be statistically significant with SCC [ ]. The LATS2 promoter was hyper-methylated in 71% of the cases and the promoter hypermethylation frequencies were quite comparable to those reported in astrocytoma (71.50%) [ ] and NSCLC (78.80%) [ ]. Also, in breast cancers [ ], head and neck cancers [ ] and ALL [ ] the LATS2 methylation frequencies were reported to be 50%, 24% and 8%, respectively which is less than the frequency reported in our study. LATS2 promoter hypermethylation showed a strong significant association with smoking, lymph node metastasis and large tumor size ( P < 0.05) which is not in agreement with those reported earlier [ ] and the reason for this discrepancy might be a different ethnic background of our population. However, we observed that LATS2 hypermethylation was independent of age and sex and the results are in line with the earlier studies [ , , , , ]. The reason for higher frequency of promoter hypermethylation of LATS1 and LATS2 might be the different kind of tissue, nature of disease and the different level of assault by smoking and various air pollutants as the lungs are the only organs which have a direct contact with the environmental air pollutants. Further, the hypermethylation of LATS1 and LATS2 was not observed in any of the normal lung tissues, showing that LATS1 and LATS2 hyper-methylation might be involvedin the pathogenesis of NSCLC and hence, may be used as a tool in diagnosis of NSCLC. As we had a proper follow-up of the patients, we tried to find some association of LATS1 and LATS2 hypermethylation with the survival. Despite the fact that the LATS1 and LATS2 hypermethylation increased the adjusted hazard ratio by a factor of 1.4 and 1.69 but they were not statistically significant, this is in agreement with the earlier reports [ ].
Since promoter hypermethylation has direct effect on mRNA expression, we compared the mRNA expression in tumour and their adjacent normal tissues. We observed a strong decrease of 55.06% (38 of 69) and 66.66% (46 of 69) in LATS1 and LATS2 mRNA expression respectively in NSCLC tissues as compared to normal. These results are quite comparable to those observed in NSCLC [ ], Soft tissue sarcomas [ ], breast cancers [ ], astrocytomas [ ], gliomas [ ] colorectal cancers [ ], gastric cancers [ ] and ALL [ ]. Since, LATS1 is reportedly involved in the control of proliferation, invasion, apoptosis and/or differentiation of various types of cells [ , ] we also compared the LATS1 mRNA expression with various clinicopathological characteristics. Our study showed that LATS1 mRNA expression significantly correlated with positive lymph node status ( P = 0.001) which is in agreement with the earlier reported studies [ , , ]. In addition, tumor size was significantly associated with LATS1 expression ( P = 0.015) and results are in concordance with those reported in breast cancer [ ] but in contradiction with those reported in NSCLC [ ]. However, this discrepancy might be due to low sample size. Furthermore, LATS1 mRNAexpression showed a significant four times decrease in smokers [Adj. OR 4.09(1.33–12.54), P = 0.014] but has not been reported elsewhere. We also compared the LATS2 mRNA expression with various clinicopathological characteristics and found a significant correlation with positive lymph node status ( P = 0.003). Our results are in line with the previously reported studies for breast cancer and colon cancer [ , ] but in contradiction with a single study pertaining to lung cancer [ ]. This discrepancy might be due to the inclusion of only one subtype of NSCLC patients (ADC) by Luo et al. in his study, whereas our study included all type of NSCLC subtypes. In addition, tumor size significantly correlated with LATS2 mRNA expression ( P = 0.032) and results are in concordance with those reported for breast cancer [ ] but in contradiction with reported for lung cancer [ ]. However, no correlation was found for low LATS2 mRNA expression with smoking, pathological grade, clinical stage, dwelling, histological type, age and sex. The results are in line with those observed by Luo et al . [ ].
Some studies showed that the decreased mRNA expression of LATS1 & LATS2 might be related to LATS1 gene mutation [ ], LATS2 gene polymorphic change [ ] or hypermethylation of gene promoters [ , , ] which could induce down-regulated mRNA expression . However, in our study, a significant decrease in LATS1 and LATS2 mRNA expression was observed in NSCLC tissues with LATS1 and LATS2 hypermethylation respectively, than those without hypermethylation ( P < 0.001) suggesting that hypermethylation of the promoter region down-regulates its expressionand is in consistence with the reports on ALL [ ], breast cancers [ ] , astrocytomas [ ], soft tissue sarcomas [ ], colorectal cancers [ ], and gastric cancers [ ], which showed that hypermethylation of LATS1 and LATS2 genes was associated with a decreased mRNA expression.
Our study also shows that the LATS1 under expression increase the hazard ratio by a factor of 2.82 which was statistically significant ( P = 0.001). Also, the LATS2 underexpression did not correlate with patient survival irrespective of the fact that its under-expression increased the adjusted hazard ratio by a factor of 1.59 ( P = 0.1265). Multivariate analysis further confirmed the role of decreased LATS1 mRNA expression as an independent prognostic factor for survival in resected NSCLC tissues and the results are in agreement with those reported earlier [ , , ]. It is important to mention that the loss of LATS1 expression was associated with overall shorter survival in NSCLC patients (log rank test: P < 0.001). These results are in agreement with the previous reports that patients with lower LATS1 mRNA expression had a significantly shorter overall survival time than patients with higher LATS1 mRNA expression [ , , ]. Since the role of LATS1 in lung cancer has been implicated in cell migration and invasion , loss of LATS1 expression may reveal its significance with lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis [ ]. These results indicate that loss of LATS1 expression clubbed with the implication of LATS1 as a tumor suppressor could be a useful tool for predicting the poor prognosis of NSCLC patients.
Since, promoter hypermethylation plays an important role in the down regulation of LATS1 & LATS2 expression, the reversal of epigenetic silencing that could reactivate the normal transcriptional mechanism and allow production of normal proteins that might induce the regression of the malignant phenotype offers novel targets for therapy. The availability of de-methylating agents gives our results additional importance because decreased LATS1 expression might represent a direct therapeutic target in patients with NSCLC as its underexpresssion decreases the patient survival significantly. Further studies investigating LATS1 activation in patients with NSCLC are waned to be carried out to gain more insight into the potential clinical usefulness of this therapeutic approach.
