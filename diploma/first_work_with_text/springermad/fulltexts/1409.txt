Introduction
Giardia lamblia is a flagellated parasite inhabiting the small intestine, causing giardiasis. It contributes to abdominal cramps, and occasionally nausea, vomiting, acute, and persistent diarrhea, and sometimes accompanied by malabsorption of sugars and fats, and by weight loss due to nutritional deficiencies. Globally, it is responsible for the largest number of waterborne outbreaks of diarrhea affecting both adults and children. The estimated giardiasis cases in 2010 were 183 million besides 171,000 disability adjusted life years (Torgerson et al. ).
Treatment of giardiasis includes several drugs: 5-nitroimidazoles, 5-nitrofurans, benzimidazoles, and pyrantel pamoate. Despite the efficacy of these drugs, their use was associated with relapses and treatment failures, and their carcinogenicity was proved in expermintal animals but has not been proved in humans (Cohen et al. ). Therefore, research should continue for new, safe, easily administered, effective drug (Machado et al. ).
For centuries and worldwide, folk medicine has depended on medicinal plants. Since they were used extensively for preparation of valuable chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of several illnesses including parasitic infections, the interest in medicinal herbs increased markedly because of their efficacy, safety, and easy accessibility at low cost, especially in the developing countries (Santin et al. ).
Cymbopogon citrates (DC) Stapf, Family Poaceae, is popularly known as citronella grass or lemongrass. Freshly cut and partially dried leaves are used medicinally and are the source of the essential oil (Santin et al. ; Shah et al. ). Studies indicated that C. citratus possesses various pharmacological activities such as anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-mycobacterial, anti-diarrheal, anti-inflammatory, and anti-pyretic properties (Santin et al. ; Shah et al. ; Kpoviessi et al. ). Various other effects like anti-mutagenicity, anti-oxidants, and hypoglycemic and neurobehavioral effects have also been studied (Shah et al. ). The anti-protozoal properties as anti-amoebic, anti-filarial, and anti-malarial effects have been investigated (Santoro et al. ; Shah et al. ). It showed efficacy against Leishmania amazonensis , Leishmania chagasi , Trypanosoma cruzi (Luize et al. ; Santoro et al. ; Santin et al. ; Oliveira et al. ).
C. citrates aqueous extract is the most commonly used anti-diarrheal preparation by natives of Egypt. This whole extract may be valuable than prepared isolated fraction(s) due to the potential synergy of its various components (Roby et al. ).
This study aimed to assess the in vitro and in vivo giardicidal effectiveness of Cymbagogon citratus (CcAE). Chemical analysis was performed to determine the total extract phenolic, flavonoid components and their concentration using HPLC, and DPPH free radical scavenging activities.
Materials and methods
After obtaining approval from the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Fayoum University, the anti- Giardia techniques were performed from February to November 2016, in the Parasitology Department laboratory. The extract was chemically analyzed in the Environmental and Food Pollutants Laboratory, Faculty of Agriculture, Fayoum University.
Plant material and preparation of C. citratus aqueous extracts
Leaves of C. citratus were purchased from an herbalist shop in the local market and identified by the Department of Horticulture, Faculty of Agriculture, Fayoum University. A labeled and numbered voucher specimen was deposited in the Department herbarium. The leaves were thoroughly washed with tap water, dried under the shade at room temperature, powdered using an electric blender, sieved through a kitchen strainer. About 500 g of the plant powder was boiled in distilled water (1000 ml) for 120 min. The suspension was kept shaking overnight at room temperature and then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 5 min, and the centrifuges were dried under vacuums by rotary evaporator (Hahn shin Hs-3001, China). Preparation of stock solution (10 mg/ml) was done by dissolving the dry residues in distilled water. The extract was sterilized by filtration using Acrodisc® syringe filters, Gelman, 0.22 μm size (Sigma-Aldrich, Dorset, UK) and then preserved in the deep freezer (− 20 °C) until it was used (Njume et al. ).
Determination of total phenolic and flavonoid contents
The JASCO Model V-530, UV-VIS spectrophotometer (JASCO, Japan) was used, and each content was determined in triplicates. Folin-Ciocalteu method was used to detect the total phenolic content (TPC) at a wavelength of 760 nm using a calibration curve of gallic acid. TPC was expressed as milligram gallic acid equivalents/gram dry extract (mgGAE/g) (Singleton et al. ). The total flavonoid content (TFC) was determined at a wavelength of 510 nm in comparison with a calibration curve of quercetin (Quettier-Deleu et al. ). TFC was expressed as quercetin equivalent (mg of quercetin/g of dry extract).
High-performance liquid chromatography identification of phenolic and flavonoid compounds of plant extract
Agilent 1260 Infinity series HPLC system (Agilent Technologies, Berks, UK) was used. Solvents and chemicals used were of analytical grade and were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Dorset, UK). The detection wavelength was set at 280 nm. The identification of phenolic and flavonoid compounds was accomplished by comparing the retention times and HPLC spectra of each compound of the peaks in the sample to those of the standard compounds.
Determination of free radical scavenging activity
The ability of CcAE to scavenge DPPH stable radical was assessed in triplicate (Mimica-Dukić et al. ). Serial dilutions of CcAE (from 0.5 to 25.0 mg/ml) were mixed with 1 ml of 90 μM DPPH solution and made up with 95% methanol, to a final volume of 4 ml. Ascorbic acid was used as a control. The absorbance was recorded at 515 nm. Radical scavenging (%) = 100 × ( A blank − A sample / A blank ), where A blank is the absorbance of the control (containing all reagents except the test extract) and A sample is the absorbance of the tested extract. IC 50 value, the CcAE concentration that induced 50% free radical scavenging efficiency, was calculated from the linear regression logarithm. These values were recalculated to the reciprocal of IC 50 (1/IC 50 ) which is defined as antiradical power (ARP).
In vitro efficacy against G. lamblia trophozoites
The standard drug control
Metronidazole was supplied as 500 mg tablets (Amriya Pharm. Ind. Alexandria, Egypt). Tablets were crushed, dissolved in distilled water, and diluted to yield 10 and 25 μg/ml for use in vitro, and 15 mg/kg/day/mouse for seven consecutive days post-infection for in vivo experiment (Brandelli et al. ).
Parasite culture
G. lamblia cysts were isolated from positive diarrhea samples collected from multiple cases and delivered to the Parasitology Department, Fayoum University, for examination. The cysts were isolated by the modified sucrose density gradient, forming a pooled sample that was used in the further experiments without definition at the genotype level (Bingham et al. ).
Excystation of G. lamblia cysts and cultivation method
One volume of purified cyst suspension was added to 9 volumes of aqueous HCL (pH 2) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After centrifugation at 600 rpm for 10 min at room temperature, the supernatant was removed and the pellet was inoculated into excystation medium consisted of filter-sterilized TYI-S-33 culture medium, 1 mg/ml bovine bile (Keister ; Brandelli et al. ), and 20% heat inactivated fetal calf serum. Finally, the culture tubes contained 9 ml of the medium, supplemented with penicillin (500 IU/ml) and streptomycin (500 μg/ml), screw capped, and were incubated at 37 °C in a slant under anaerobic conditions (AnaeroPack system; Remel). Subculture was done every 48 h by transferring of 1 ml of the growing culture fluid to new tubes, and 9 ml of the culture fluid was added (Bingham et al. ).
Growth inhibition assays
The study was performed according to Campanati and Monteiro-Leal ( ). CcAE at six concentrations (25, 50, 100, 200, 400, and 500 μg/ml) was evaluated for its giardicidal effectiveness in comparison with MTZ control (10 and 25 μg/ml), and with the negative control containing the parasite in culture media only. The efficacy was evaluated after 3, 24, and 48 h of drug exposure. Two sterile test tubes were applied for each drug concentration. Each test tube contained 2 ml of culture fluid with trophozoites at log phase (5 × 10 4 cells/ml) plus 2 ml of CcAE or MTZ.
By the end of the exposure periods, the parasites were harvested by chilling the test tubes on ice for 15–30 min to detach the monolayer and then centrifuged at 900 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was carefully removed so as not to interrupt the parasites. Two milliliters of 0.1% eosin stain (1 g of eosin powder in 1000 ml distilled water) was added to the remaining settled parasites and mixed gently (Brandelli et al. ). The supernatant was discarded after 15 min of incubation. The solution was observed under a microscope in a hemocytometer. Unstained cells were reported alive.
Two counts per test tube were done, the mean was calculated for each drug concentration and then compared against the controls, and the percentage of parasite reduction was calculated. The 100 and 50% inhibitory concentrations (MIC and IC 50 ) at which reduction of the viable G. lamblia trophozoites in comparison to control were determined.
In vivo studies
Animal groups
BALB/c mice, 7–8 weeks old, 23–28 g, free from any infections were brought and kept under restricted hygienic measures in the Parasitology Department, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Cairo University, at standard controlled conditions (22 ± 1 °C, 65 ± 5% relative humidity), light and dark cycle. They were provided with a standard pellet diet (24% protein), water ad libitum in accordance with the international ethical guidelines. All mice were numbered and then chosen at a random to be entered into a given group. Simple randomization was applied for allocation of mice into different groups using a lottery method. The sample size was calculated according to Epi Info 2000. For the efficacy study, a sample size of 30 was selected using a special formula based on the efficacy of treatment ranged between (87–95%) according to a previous study (Arome et al. ), at a confidence interval of 95% and power of (80%).
Acute oral toxicity study
Randomized groups of mice (three per group) were given ascending oral doses of 10, 100, 1000, 2000, 4000, and 6000 mg/kg of CcAE for 7 days. Then, the mice were observed for 24 h for possible signs of toxicity as ataxia, dullness, excitement, or death. The median lethal dose (LD 50 ) was estimated as the square root of the product of the lowest lethal dose and the highest non-lethal dose (Lorke ).
In vivo therapeutic potential
Mice were randomized into five groups, six animals/each group (Table 3 ). To induce infection, each mouse received 10,000 G. lamblia cysts in a sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) by orogastric gavage. To confirm successful infection, daily examination of stool was performed for detection of cysts/or trophozoites. Treatment regimens were started on the third day of parasitic detection and were continued for the following 7 days with daily follow-up stool examination. Mice were killed 3 days after the end of treatment (Abdalla et al. ).
For determination of treatment efficacy, the collected total daily stool/animal was pooled, concentrated, and microscopically examined for detection of Giardia stages. Stages were enumerated using a hemocytometer. The viability was determined by eosin as above.
The excised proximal 10 cm of the small intestine was placed in ice chilled saline for 15–20 min, longitudinally opened and washed. The trophozoites were counted in the pooled concentrated intestinal wash using a hemocytometer (Humen et al. ).
Statistical analysis
Data were collected and entered into Microsoft Office Excel 2007 software to prepare dose-response curves for determination of the IC 50 values. Data analysis was performed using SPSS software version 18 in windows 7 using simple descriptive analysis in the form of arithmetic means as central tendency measurement, standard deviations as a measure of dispersion for quantitative data. One-way ANOVA test was used to compare between different drug concentrations, and then Benferroni post hoc was used to test the significance between each two concentrations. Paired t test was used to compare each two dependant readings to trace the changes between base line and every day in vivo follow-up for 7 days, also between 3, 24, and 48 h in vitro follow-up. The P value ≤ 0.05 was considered the cutoff value for statistical significance, so P value less than or equal to 0.05 will consider significant.
Results
Chemical constituents of CcAE
CcAE contained high concentrations of TPC and TFC. The TPC was 10.7 ± 0.2 mg GAE/g and the TFC was 23.9 ± 0.3 mg quercetin/g. The scavenging activity of extracts against DPPH free radical was concentration-dependent (Fig. 1 ). The IC 50 value for scavenging DPPH free radical by CcAE was 16.4 ± 0.1 mg/ml in comparison with ascorbic acid control 0.02 mg/ml. The ARP for CcAE was 0.06, and for ascorbic acid was 50 (Table 1 ).

HPLC determined the CcAE phenolic and flavonoid components (Table 1 , Fig. 2 ). Identification of the different components was undertaken by comparisons to the retention times and UV spectra of authentic standards. The quantitative determinations were carried out by calculations from the prepared calibration curves. The major components of CcAE were carnosic acid, p -coumaric acid, cinnamiac acid, quercetin, rutin, and chlorogenic acid. Carnosic acid was the dominant phenolic compound (8.17%) of the total extracted compounds. Fig. 2 HPLC chromatogram of CcAE
In vitro effect of CcAE on G. lamblia trophozoites
CcAE induced statistically significant reduction of Giardia trophozoites growth in comparison with MTZ that was time and concentration dependent, P < 0.001 (Table 2 , Fig. 3 ). The trophozoite reduction rates of MTZ at 25 and 10 μg/ml reached up to 42 and 32% after 3 h of incubation, increased to 100 and 81.2% after 24 h, and then reached up to 100 and 93% after 48 h. CcAE concentrations at 500 and 400 μg/ml induced 100% inhibition of trophozoite growth in the range with MTZ at 25 μg/ml. CcAE concentrations at 200 μg/ml showed percent trophozoite reduction in the range with MTZ at 10 μg/ml at the end of the three incubation times. The parasite reduction rate increased with increasing of culture incubation time with CcAE ( P < 0.001). The MIC/24 h and IC 50 /24 h were 500 and 93.8 μg/ml, respectively. The MIC/48 h and IC 50 /48 h were 400 and 60.4 μg/ml, respectively.

Results of acute oral toxicity study
In the acute toxicity study, all mice remained alive without any signs of toxicity up the doses of 4000 mg/kg. The mice survived the dose 6000 mg/kg but showed some toxicity signs, including weakness, sedation, and gaiting. The estimated LD 50 of CcAE was more than 6000 mg/kg.
In vivo effect of CcAE on G. lamblia in experimentally infected mice
Examination of mice stool after the end of treatment and intestinal wash fluids revealed a statistically significant efficacy of CcAE in comparison with MTZ, P < 0.001 (Table 3 and Fig. 4 ). Administration of 500 mg/kg/day of CcAE showed 100% clearance of Giardia stages in the stool, and the efficacy was similar to administration of 15 mg/kg/day MTZ. However, examination of the intestinal wash of mice showed presistence of some Giaradia stages with a reduction rate of 94.7% in comparison with the placebo-treated control. Administration of 250 mg/kg/day of CcAE showed 65.7% and 55.1% parasite reduction rates based on examination of the stool and intestinal wash fluid, respectively. Administration of 125 mg/kg/day of CcAE showed 36.6% reduction rate in stool and 21.5% in the intestinal wash fluid. The detailed stool follow-up results were presented (Fig. 4 ). Results showed that 500 mg CcAE followed the same course of MTZ, and both induced early, marked decrease of viable parasite counts from the third day of drug administration. No mice died due to infection, and no abnormalities were detected in the mice treated with CcAE in comparison with the group treated with MTZ.

Discussion
Nature provides us with several plant products that help in the treatment of several diseases. These products have the benefits of being biodegradable, eco-friendly, and can help to overcome the growing problem of drug resistance.
The present study is considered to be the first report investigating the in vitro and in vivo giardicidal effectiveness of CcAE compared to the standard drug MTZ. The significantly high in vitro activity of CcAE and the estimated IC 50 were in range with previous in vitro studies using different extract preparations from C. citratus . These studies revealed the successful results against different parasites, including flagellates (Luize et al. ; Santoro et al. ; Santin et al. ; Cardoso and Soares ; Kpoviessi et al. ). The results of the previous studies were presented in a table form together with the results of this study for comparison (Table 4 ).

By electron microscopy, previous studies proved that exposure to C. citratus extracts induced morphological damages in the flagellated parasites as mitochondrial swelling, flagellae, and flagellar pockets changes. There was also cytoplasmatic extraction with multiple vacuoles, development of plasma membrane blebs that seeming to detach from the parasite surface (Santoro et al. ; Santin et al. ; Cardoso and Soares ).
The present acute toxicity study in mice proved safety of CcAE 4000 mg/kg/day for 7 days, and some side effects appeared by the dose 6000 mg/kg in accordance with Arome et al. ( ) who reported that LD 50 was > 5000 mg/kg for CcAE. The safety of a herbal tea prepared from leaves of C. citratus on healthy volunteers was previously proved, without reporting changes in the blood glucose, lipids, and bilirubin, liver and kidney function profiles, urine analysis, and other tests (Leite et al. ).
Administration of CcAE per mouth in experimentally infected mice in the present study reflected 100 and 65.7% parasite reduction rate in the stool for the groups administered 500 and 250 mg/kg in comparison with MTZ. In a previous study, the efficacy of CcEO against Plasmodium berghei ranged from 62.1 to 86.6% reported in mice treated with concentration ranged from 200 to 500 mg/kg/mouse/day in comparison to drug control (Tchoumbougnang et al. ). Also, mice groups infected by P. berghei and then treated by CcAE 200, 400, and 800 mg/kg for 4 days showed significant decrease of parasitemia up to 20.83, 55.56, and 80.56% in comparison to chloroquine (Arome et al. ). As regards the pharmacokinetics, Costa et al. ( ) demonstrated that C. citratus infusion when given to rats (68.24 mg/kg) at a single oral dose was rapidly absorbed within 30 min. The polyphenolic components were rapidly metabolized. The authors suggested that this may be responsible for the rapid anti-inflammatory activity of C. citratus .
In this study, chemical analysis revealed that CcAE had considerable TPC and TFC. The TPC was (10.65 ± 0.24 mg GAE/g dw), and TFC was (23.87 ± 0.3). IC 50 value of DPPH free radical scavenging activity was 16.4 ± 0.1 mg/ml in comparison with ascorbic acid. HPLC revealed that the major phenolic components of CcAE were carnosic acid (the dominant phenolic compound since 8.17%), p-coumaric acid, cinnamiac acid, quercetin, rutin, and chlorogenic acid.
Zielinski et al. ( ) analyzed CcAE from leaves. The results revealed TPC of 147.12 ± 30.74 mg GAE/L, TFC of 46.35 ± 9.40 mg of catechin equivalents (CTE) per liter of tea, and % reduction of DPPH free radical 17.10 ± 12.68. HPLC analysis of phenolic content revealed the presence of chlorogenic acid 37.97 ± 26.17 and coumaric acid 0.06 ± 0.14, while catechin, quercetin, and gallic acid were not detected. Kouassi et al. ( ) determined the TPC level of C. citratus methanolic (CcMet) and ethanolic (CcEt) extracts prepared from the plant leaves to be 118.14 ± 1.05 and 35.43 ± 0.24 mg GAE/g. The reduction rate of DPPH free radical was 34 ± 0.74 and 33 ± 0.26 for both extracts, respectively. HPLC phenolic compound analysis revealed that protocatechuic acid, caffeic acid, rutin, p -coumaric acid, ferulic acid, quercetin, and kaempherol were common to both extracts, but they were more concentrated in CcMet. Sinapic acid was specific to CcEt, while gentisic acid and chlorogenic acid were specific to extract CcMet.
C. citratus crude extracts are powerful antioxidants, especially against DPPH free radical. TPC act as free radical terminators or powerful chain breaking antioxidants due to its hydroxyl group, and found in large quantities in C. citratus . Phenolics and flavonoids have many antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory functions that correlate with the radical scavenging activities and determine the medicinal effects of the plants (Negri et al. ). Phenols and flavonoids can cause membrane disruption, while alkaloids can inhibit the growth of microorganisms by affecting their genetic materials (Cowan ). Consequently, determination of their level in the herbal extract is important. Several reports have conclusively shown a correlation between the antioxidant activity and amount of total phenolics or total flavonoids (Roby et al. ).
C. citratus extracts chemical composition markedly varies in relation with the plant geographical origin, the used part, the stage of maturity, genetic variations, the extraction procedure, and the season of harvest. However, some compounds are always present as saponins, tannins, alkaloid, phenols, flavonoids, and anthraquinones. Citral, geranial, geraniol, myrcene, limonene, citronellol, burneol, neral, nerol, α-terpineol, elemicin, kaempferol, apigenin, caffeic acid, quercetin, luteolin, geranyl acetate, and chlorogenic acid are also found in addition to other unknown compounds (Shah et al. ).
Study limitations
The study focused on the trophozoites of G. lamblia found in diarrheic stools and did not evaluate CcAE effectiveness against cysts in carriers who represent an important source of infection.
In addition, the plant extract was not evaluated against specific Giardia trophozoites genotypes. Future studies are recommended to cover these limitations.
Conclusion
CcAE is effective against G. lamblia in vitro and in vivo, and has considerable phenolic and antioxidant properties.
