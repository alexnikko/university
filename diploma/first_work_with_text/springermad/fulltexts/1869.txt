1 Introduction
Printers’ health complaints include higher levels of eye and airway problems, general symptoms such as headaches and neurological symptoms, including concentration problems, than in matched controls, and symptoms tend to persist after work [ ]. In general, headache disorders are amongst the ten most disabling conditions according to the World Health Organisation [ ]. A recent meta-analysis identified stress and poor sleep quality as the most important antecedents of headaches [ ]. Stress levels are high in the printing business: work is done under time pressure and there are high concentration requirements and frequent interruptions [ ].
Between one working day and the subsequent day, printers need to recover their mental resources, and complete recovery depends on getting a good night’s sleep [ ]. There is a consensus that work stress impairs sleep quality [ ]. Sleep is necessary for recovery in humans [ ] and is therefore considered to be the link between occupational stressors, cognitive functioning and health [ ]. Impaired sleep may have a detrimental effect on psychosomatic well-being (e.g. pain [ ]) that is independent of the effects of work demands. Reduced sleep quality is a predictor of impaired performance, especially cognitive performance [ ]. Sleep impairments extend reaction times, impair concentration and attention and reduce working memory capacity [ ]. Hence, we hypothesised that the previous night’s sleep quality and current day’s time pressure, as well as work interruptions and concentration requirements, would predict current-day, cognition-related health complaints, including headaches and concentration problems.
2 Methods
2.1 Study Population
The data collection took place in a single printing company with 28 employees. The entirety of the company’s staff was invited to participate in the study. Twenty-seven employees agreed to participate (participation rate of 96%). All participants provided informed consent and completed the study.
The sample consisted of 14 women and 13 men, ranging in age between 18 and 53 years ( M = 32.41, SD = 10.58). The median is 30 years of age. Most participants ( n = 23) worked full-time (42 h/week), three participants worked 80% of full-time and one participant worked 60% of full-time, making the mean percentage of full-time work 96% (SD= 9.67). Most participants were directly involved in the printing process, which included print preparation (41%), printing (19%) and further work with print media (15%). The remaining 26% of participants did administrative or marketing tasks.
2.2 Study Design
The study was conducted over 5 weeks in January and February of 2016. In order to participate in the study, the individuals had to be in good general health. All questionnaire data were collected electronically (Qualtrics Survey, 2015). First, participants filled out a questionnaire on demographic information and other background information. Second, they received a SenseWear Armband and instructions for using it. The following week, they completed daily questionnaires immediately after they finished work (“after-work diary”) and immediately before they went to sleep (“bedtime diary”). Participants received emails with links to the appropriate online questionnaire at between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. for the after-work diary and between 9 p.m. and 10 p.m. for the bedtime diary. They wore the sensewear actigraphy armband on the left forearm for the weekend before data collection (Saturday and Sunday) so that they would get used to it before the study started on Monday. As we wanted to collect data for the whole working week, the armband was worn from Monday morning until Saturday morning and was only removed for showering and bathing.
2.3 Sleep Quality: Actigraphy Measures
Sleep quality is a multifaceted construct that encompasses, for example, sleep duration and sleep interruptions, and the importance of each facet may vary among individuals. We therefore used both self-reported and actigraphy-based indicators of sleep quality. During the last two decades, actigraphy has become an accepted tool in sleep research and sleep medicine [ ]. The term ‘actigraphy’ refers to use of miniature computers for movement monitoring. Sleep parameters are estimated through integrated algorithms that process movement data. Like polysomnography, which is the direct monitoring of sleep via electroencephalography (EEG) [ ], actigraphy is an effective way of estimating sleep behaviour, but it does not provide information on sleep stages [ ]. Germain and colleagues [ ] found that the actigraphy algorithm correctly identified 83% of all wakefulness episodes and 93% of all sleep episodes when EEG measurements in a sleep laboratory were used as the reference.
In this study, we used the BodyMedia SenseWear Armband, which includes a multi-accelerometer device. Body movements were assessed every minute via two-axis oscillometric sensors. Participants wore the armband on their non-dominant arm throughout the night—that is, from lights off until they got up in the morning. Data were analysed with BodyMedia software. This software estimated sleep phases, wakeful phases, sleep onset latency, sleep fragmentation, sleep duration and sleep efficiency using computer algorithm-defined thresholds of activity [ ]. The time participants needed to fall asleep after going to bed was coded as sleep onset latency. Sleep duration was minutes of sleep before final morning waking. Sleep efficiency was defined as the percentage of sleep duration spent in bed. Sleep fragmentation was coded as the number of awakenings that lasted 5 min or longer and were preceded and followed by at least 15 min of uninterrupted sleep [ ]. Inaccurate measurements (e.g. malfunction of the actigraphs) were identified by visual inspection of raw data and were coded as missing data. Naps during the day were not included in the analyses.
2.4 Diary Measures
After work diary: Daily time pressure, interruptions and concentration requirements at work: Time pressure (e.g. “How often does it happen today that you cannot take your break, or that you cannot take your break on time, because of too much work?”); work interruptions (e.g. “Do you often have to interrupt your current work activity because something important comes up?”); and concentration requirement (e.g. “How often does your work require the utmost concentration for short periods of time?”) were each assessed with five items from a shortened version of the Instrument for Stress-Oriented Task Analysis (ISTA, Version 5.1 [ ]), to which responses were given using a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 ( very rarely/never ) to 5 ( very often/constantly ). Cronbach’s alpha was .88 for time pressure, .67 for work interruptions and .71 for concentration requirement.
After work diary: Self - report of quality of previous night’s sleep: The quality of the previous night’s sleep was evaluated with a single item (“How satisfied are you with the quality of your sleep last night?”), for which there were five response options ranging from 1 ( very unsatisfied ) to 5 ( very satisfied ). This single-item sleep quality indicator has previously been shown to have acceptable reliability and validity [ ].
Bedtime diary: Headache and concentration problems were assessed with two items asking about the frequency of each symptom that day (“Today, I experienced… headache”), responses were given using a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 ( very rarely/never ) to 5 ( very often/constantly ). These items were part of a scale developed by Mohr to measure psychosomatic complaints [ ].
2.5 Control Variables
Sex and age: Both of these level-2 variables were controlled in multilevel regression analyses because sex and age are known to be related to sleep fragmentation [ ] and homeostatic sleep regulation [ ]. The prevalence of sleep problems increases with age and is higher in women than men [ ].
Sleep duration during the weekend: The sum of sleep duration during the weekend (Saturday night and Sunday night) was included as a baseline actigraphy-based sleep measure.
Autocorrelation: We controlled for the effects of the current day’s value of each outcome variable (autocorrelation; previous day’s concentration problems and headaches).
2.6 Statistical Analysis
The data comprised repeated measurements (Monday morning to Saturday morning), and thus they had a multilevel structure with participant demographics on level 2 and day- or night-related outcome variables on level 1. Person-level predictors were centred using a grand mean, and sleep as well as daily work stressors were centred by person mean. The sample sizes were adequate [ ] for multilevel regression analysis on the person level (level 2, n = 27 individuals) and the day level (level 1, n = 125 days/nights). The level-2 sample size was lower than the recommended minimum of 50, but given that none of the hypotheses involved cross-level interactions, the estimates of the regression coefficients, the variance components and the standard errors were likely to be accurate [ ]. Data were analysed using the MLwiN multilevel statistics program. Note that unstandardised coefficients are reported. Because of the directional hypothesis, the alpha level was set to p < .05, one-tailed [ ].
3 Results
3.1 Descriptive Results
Means and standard deviations are shown in Table 1 . Mean daily levels of headaches and concentration problems were low. Average sleep duration was 6 h, and average sleep onset latency was 13 min. On average, each employee experienced slightly more than two awakenings per night. Mean sleep efficiency was above 80%. Pearson correlations between study variables are shown in Table 2 . Daily time pressure was related to daily work interruptions ( r = .58) and daily concentration demands ( r = .67). Daily work interruptions and daily concentration demands were also correlated ( r = .55). Daily concentration problems were positively correlated with daily job stressors, but headaches were not.

3.2 Regression of Current-Day Headaches and Concentration Problems on Current-Day Work Stressors and Previous-Day Sleep Quality
The results of multilevel regression analyses are shown in Table 3 . Frequent work interruptions predicted more frequent headaches ( B = 0.46, p = .005). Neither time pressure ( B = − 0.25, p = .960) nor concentration requirement ( B = − 0.12, p = .720) predicted headache frequency. Headache frequency was predicted by the quality of sleep the previous night. Self-reported sleep quality ( B = − 0.23, p = .018), sleep onset latency ( B = 0.02, p = .029), sleep fragmentation ( B = 0.32, p = .002) and sleep efficacy ( B = 0.05, p = .008) all predicted headache frequency the following day.

Concentration problems were predicted by the current day’s concentration requirement ( B = 0.32, p = .047). Neither time pressure ( B = − 0.18, p = .907) nor work interruptions ( B = 0.14, p = .198) predicted concentration problems. Of the sleep quality indicators, only sleep onset latency ( B = 0.02, p = .009) predicted concentration problems the following day (Table 3 ).
4 Discussion
Cognitive impairments—especially headaches—are widespread health complaints. Work conditions are among the perpetuating factors for headaches [ ]. Moreover, lack of sleep and low quality sleep are known to lower pain thresholds [ , ], and there is increasing evidence that sleep quality is related to impairments such as headaches [ ]. This ambulatory field study examined nocturnal sleep quality, daily cognitive functioning and daily work conditions across one working week.
Previous ambulatory assessment studies also found that higher levels of job stressors were related to lower sleep quality [ ]. We extended this research by investigating the impact of nightly recovery on daily cognitive functioning. In line with results from diary and actigraphy studies of patients with tension headaches [ ] and episodic migraines [ ], this study showed that daily headache intensity was predicted by quality of sleep the previous night. We also found that concentration problems were related to sleep onset latency, although the associations between headaches and both self-reported and measured sleep quality variables were clearer. Inter-individual differences in sleep duration at the weekend were not found to be significant predictors of the examined cognitive health indicators.
These daily sleep quality effects were independent of and additional to the effects of current-day, task-related work stressors, underlining the importance of good sleep quality. In addition, we found that daily, after-work self-reports of work interruptions predicted headaches, and concentration requirement predicted before-bedtime concentration problems. The short-term dynamics of the relationships between work stressors and headaches in printers correspond with findings from patients with tension headaches: feelings of stress were shown to predict increases in headache intensity at the individual level over the following 3 h [ ]. Kikuchi and colleagues reported that individual fluctuations and the temporal dynamics of daily stress were better predictors of headache than average level of stress [ ].
This study found a similar pattern of results, namely, short-term, within-person covariation between work stressors, sleep and headache in healthy working individuals, which is compatible with a self-regulatory perspective on recovery [ ]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ambulatory assessment diary study to show that actigraphic indicators of sleep quality the previous night and daily work stressors are associated with headaches and concentration problems. It is possible that as well as short-term fluctuation in work stressors, sleep quality and pain, there are also cumulative effects and changes that take longer to emerge [ ]. For instance, longitudinal research in the French GAZEL cohort showed a steep decrease in headache prevalence during the year following retirement, especially in those reporting high levels of work stress [ ]. The reversibility of work-related headaches after retirement points suggests that change is generally possible, and hence, interventions are warranted.
Occupational health intervention should address work stressors, sleep and headaches. The impact of sleep on performance and safety, including the financial implications, is widely recognised. Improving sleep quality would represent an important intervention. Reduced working time with retained salary was recently shown to have sustained beneficial effects on sleep, sleepiness and perceived stress, both on workdays and days off [ ]. The person-oriented approach to sleep in workers and employees so far includes sleep extension on weekends, especially for those who sleep for fewer than 6 h after workdays [ ]. Online, after-work sleep training interventions (including mindfulness training) were shown to increase sleep quality [ ]. Moreover, cognitive-behavioural stress management was shown to improve sleep quality. Recently, a rather short, education-based occupational sleep intervention was shown to improve actigraphy-based sleep indicators [ ]. In addition, brief bouts of exercise at the workplace could reduce existing headaches [ ], and it has been reported that online resilience training reduces headaches in workers [ ].
4.1 Strengths and Limitations
The very high participation rate effectively rules out the possibility of selection bias and is a strength of the study. However, the inclusion of data on social stressors at work and away from work in future research would be an advantage and headache diaries should cover pain, sleep, diet, stress, activity and potential triggers [ ]. The printing industry has changed a great deal in recent decades, and exposure to noise and chemicals has decreased. Nevertheless, it is still important to note that this study did not control for daily noise and exposure to chemicals that could trigger headaches [ ]. The daily effects of sleep quality on cognitive health may also vary depending on the female cycle. We did not check if any of the subjects were undergoing menstruation. The small sample size is also a limitation, but as cross-level interactions were not the focus, the analysis can be considered sufficiently powerful [ ]. We centred daily level predictors at the participant’s mean (“person mean centering”). This procedure removes the information about differences between persons [ ]. Thus, significant coefficients for those variables reflect the effect of participants being high or low relative to their own average for that variable across the workdays [ ].
4.2 Concluding Remarks
Sleep quality, work stressors and headaches are related across working days. On days when the person’s sleep onset latency is longer, more sleep fragmentation is experienced and sleep efficiency is lower, there is a higher risk of headache the following day. Headaches were also predicted when a person experiences more work interruptions in a day than he or she usually does. Concentration problems were predicted when the person’s previous-night sleep latency is longer and he or she experiences more concentration requirement in a day than usual. Work redesign and person-oriented training should be used to address work stress, sleep and headaches in printers.
