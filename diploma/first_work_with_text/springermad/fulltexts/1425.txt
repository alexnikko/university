Background
Human esophageal cancer is one of the deadliest cancers, ranking as the sixth leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide [ ]. One of the main subtypes is esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), a malignancy that arises from esophageal epithelial cells [ ]. Conventional therapeutic strategies of chemotherapy following surgery showed limited effect for advanced ESCC patients [ ]. There is an urgent need for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying ESCC resistance and the development of personalized therapeutic strategies to improve ESCC prognosis.
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a transmembrane growth factor receptor with tyrosine kinase (TK) activity [ ]. The presence of deregulated EGFR-tyrosine kinase (TK) has been confirmed in many types of solid tumors, such as head and neck cancers, colorectal cancers, non-small cell lung cancers, and breast cancers [ , , ]. Approximately 40–70% of ESCC specimens expressed high levels of EGFR, as assessed by EGF binding assay or immunohistochemistry [ , ]. Recently, an improved understanding of the role of EGFR in cancer has led to the development of several well-known tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as gefitinib. Gefitinib is an orally active, selective, and reversible TKI, which blocks ATP from binding to the EGFR-TK activation site and thus prevents the transduction of downstream signaling from the oncogenic receptors [ ]. Treatment of ESCC with gefitinib has been investigated in many clinical studies, and the results are complex [ , ]. Moreover, gefitinib might be effective initially, but as resistance to gefitinib increases substantially over the period of exposure, patients may have cancer progression after 6–15 months of therapy [ ]. Therefore, it is urgently necessary to investigate the mechanism of gefitinib resistance to discover reliable biological therapeutic targets.
With the development of advanced whole genome and transcriptome sequencing technologies, and the ENCODE project, it is increasingly clear that most genomic DNA is represented in processed transcripts lacking protein-coding capacity [ ]. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a recently discovered major class of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) more than 200 nucleotides in length [ ]. In recent years, emerging evidence indicates that they play important roles in regulating cellular and biological functions. LncRNAs regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level via sponging microRNAs [ ] and modulate transcriptional gene silencing via chromatin regulation [ , ].
More recently, increasing evidence suggests that cells may also communicate with each other via other mechanisms in addition to known methods, including the exchange of cellular fragments, membranes or specialized organelles like micro vesicles, which have been regarded as cellular debris until recently [ ]. Exosomes, which are membrane-derived vesicles that originate from endosomal multivesicular bodies, have a size range of 20–150 nm when released into the interstitial fluid. These vesicles contain protein, lipids, coding or noncoding RNAs derived from their donor cell cytoplasm [ ] and can be taken up by other cells. Recently, some studies have suggested that exosomes from stromal cells could potentially affect therapeutic response though the transfer of proteins and lncRNAs [ ]. However, whether exosomes derived from resistant cancer cells can confer drug resistance to sensitive cells still needs to be elucidated.
In this study, we investigated the contributions of exosome-transmitted lncRNAs to gefitinib resistance and explored the therapeutic implications for ESCC gefitinib-resistant patients. We also identified the involvement of the specific lncRNAs in the modulation of gefitinib responses via the tumor cell extracellular exosomes.
Methods
Clinical samples
In total, 79 serum samples were collected from advanced ESCC patients who received gefitinib treatment at the Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University between January 2013 and June 2017. In brief, 5 mL of venous blood was collected by vena puncture from each participant before chemotherapy was started. Serum was segregated via centrifugation at 1600× g for 10 min at room temperature within 2 h of collection, followed by a second centrifugation at 12000× g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove the residual cell debris. Each serum supernatant was transferred into RNase free tubes and stored at − 80 °C until use. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant prior to blood collection. The study protocol was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University.
Cell culture
The human ESCC cell lines TE1, TE6, TE8, TTn, and KYSE-450 were purchased from the Chinese Type Culture Collection, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). All cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (BioWhittaker, Lonza, USA) supplemented with 10 mM Hepes, 1 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin (BioWhittaker, Lonza) and heat inactivated 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco) at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO 2 . Gefitinib (Iressa, AstraZeneca, Macclesfield, UK) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) at a concentration of 10 mM and stored at − 20 °C for in vitro experiments. Gefitinib-resistant TE1/GR and KYSE-450/GR cells were established by continuous culture with 1 μM gefitinib in DMEM plus 10% FBS. During the next 6 weeks, the surviving cells were grown through three passages and reached a confluence of 70%. Subsequently, 2 μM concentration of gefitinib was used to treat the surviving cells for 8 weeks and 5 μM for another 8 weeks to obtain the resistant population. Eventually, the gefitinib resistant ESCC cell lines were successfully established by culturing the cells in 10 μM gefitinib. During the experiments, both gefitinib resistant cell lines were cultured for no higher than 10 passages.
Exosomes isolation
Exosomes were extracted from ESCC cell culture medium or serum samples using an ExoQuick precipitation kit (SBI, System Biosciences, Mountain view, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, the culture medium and serum were thawed on ice and centrifuged at 3000× g for 15 min to remove cells and cell debris. Next, 250 μL of the supernatant was mixed with 63 μL of the ExoQuick precipitation kit and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min, followed by centrifugation at 1500× g for 30 min. Then, the supernatant was removed by careful aspiration, followed by another 5 min of centrifugation to remove the residual liquid. The exosome-containing pellet was subsequently re-suspended in 250 μL phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The final pellets, containing exosomes, were collected for characterization and RNA isolation.
RNA extraction
Extraction of RNA from the exosome pellets was performed using the commercial miRNeasy Serum/Plasma kit (QIAGEN, Waltham, MA), and RNA extraction from the cell fraction was performed using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. All RNA elution steps were carried out at 12000× g for 15 s and the RNA was finally eluted in 15 μL RNase-free ultra-pure water.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
The exosome pellets were resuspended in 50 μL PBS and a drop of the suspension was placed on a sheet of parafilm. A carbon-coated copper grid was floated on the drop for 5 min at room temperature. Then, the grid was removed and excess liquid was drained by touching the grid edge against a piece of clean filter paper. The grid was then placed onto a drop of 2% phosphotungstic acid with pH 7.0 for approximately 5 s, and excess liquid was drained off. The grid was allowed to dry for several minutes and then examined using a JEM-1200 EX microscope (JEOL, Akishima, Japan) at 80 keV.
Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR)
RNA was reverse transcribed using the SuperScript III® (Invitrogen) and then amplified by RT-qPCR based on the TaqMan method using a BioRad CFX96 Sequence Detection System (BioRad company, Berkeley, CA). The gene expression levels were normalized by GAPDH expression. RT-qPCR results were analyzed and expressed relative to CT (threshold cycle) values, and then converted to fold changes. All the premier sequences were synthesized by RiboBio (Guangzhou, China), and their sequences are shown in Additional file 1 : Table S1.
RNA oligoribonucleotides and cell transfection
The small interfering RNA against lncRNA PART1, STAT1, and miR-129 mimics were synthesized by GenePharma (Shanghai, China). The lentivirus vectors containing PART1 overexpression plasmid (Lv-PART1) or negative control vector (Lv-NC) were amplified and cloned by GeneChem (Shanghai, China). Bcl-2 inhibitor venetoclax was bought from Roche (Basel, Switzerland). The coding sequence of STAT1 was amplified and cloned into pcDNA3.1 vector. Cells were plated at 5 × 10 4 cells/well in 24-well plates approximately 24 h before transfection or treatment. After the cells reached 30–50% confluence, cells were treated with venetoclax or exosomes. Transfection was carried out using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Transfection efficiency was evaluated in every experiment by RT-qPCR 24 h later to ensure that cells were actually transfected. Functional experiments were then performed after sufficient transfection for 48 h. The sequences of small interfering RNAs are shown in Additional file 1 : Table S1.
Expression profile analysis of lncRNAs
RNA expression profiling was performed using Agilent human lncRNA microarray V.2.0 platform. Quantile normalization and subsequent data processing were performed using Agilent Gene Spring Software 11.5. Heat maps representing differentially regulated genes were generated using Cluster 3.0 software. After the establishment of a cDNA library by extracting total RNAs from exosomes, hybridization and washing, four ESCC cell types were analyzed. Exogenous RNAs developed by ERCC (External RNA Controls Consortium) were used as controls. The exosomal lncRNA microarray process was performed by KangChen Bio company (Shanghai, China).
Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis (FISH)
Nuclear and cytosolic fraction separation was performed using a PARIS kit (Life Technologies), and RNA FISH probes were designed and synthesized by Bogu according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 15 min and then washed with PBS. The fixed cells were treated with pepsin and dehydrated through ethanol. The air-dried cells were incubated further with 40 nM of the FISH probe in hybridization buffer. After hybridization, the slide was washed, dehydrated, and mounted with Prolong Gold Antifade Reagent with DAPI for detection of nucleic acids. The slides were visualized for immunofluorescence with a fluorescence microscope (DMI4000B, Leica).
TUNEL assay
TUNEL staining was performed to evaluate cell apoptosis. In brief, different group of cells were treated with extracted exosomes or combined with venetoclax for 24 h and fixed by using 4% formaldehyde. Cells were fixed and stained with a TUNEL kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Vazyme, TUNEL Bright-Red Apoptosis Detection Kit, A113). TUNEL-positive cells were counted under fluorescence microscopy (DMI4000B, Leica).
Signal transduction reporter array
Cignal Signal Transduction Reporter Array (Qiagen) was used to simultaneously investigate alternations in the activities of 50 canonical signaling pathways in response to treatment with exosomal PART1. Cells were treated with PART1-overexpression exosomes for 24 h and were subsequently transfected with a mixture of a transcription factor-responsive firefly luciferase reporter and a constitutively expressing Renilla construct. The relative activity of each pathway was decided by luciferase/Renilla and normalized by untreated controls.
RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP)
Magna RIP™ RNA-Binding Protein Immunoprecipitation Kit (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) were used for RIP. ESCC cells were lysed in complete RNA lysis buffer, then cell lysates were incubated with RIP buffer containing magnetic beads conjugated with human anti-Argonaute2 (AGO2) antibody (Millipore) or negative control mouse IgG (Millipore).
In vivo tumorigenesis assay
Male BALB/C nude mice (6 weeks of age) were purchased from Shanghai SIPPR-BK Laboratory Animal Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China) and maintained in microisolator cages. For injection, 1 × 10 7 TE1 cells transfected with Lv-PART1 or Lv-NC were suspended in 110 μL of serum-free RPMI or DMEM, and injected subcutaneously in the flank. Gefitinib was dissolved in 1% Tween80. When tumors were palpable, the mice were randomized into the gefitinib treatment groups or control groups. Treatment lasted for four weeks until the xenograft tumor was stripped and the size was calculated.
Western blots and antibodies
Cell lysates were prepared with RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitors (Sigma). Protein concentrations were measured with the BCA Protein Assay according to the manufacturer’s manual (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology). Equal amounts of protein were separated by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a 1:1000 solution of antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology). A secondary antibody was then used for immunostaining for one hour at room temperature. The primary antibody used here are anti-EGFR antibody (Abcam, ab52894, 1:1000, Cambridge, MA), anti-STAT1 antibody (Abcam, ab30645, 1:1000) and anti-Bcl-2 antibody (Abcam, ab32124, 1:1000).
Statistical analysis
A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to determine the normality of the distribution of data in each group. Count dates were described as frequency and examined using Fisher’s exact test. The Student’s T test or one-way ANOVA was used to evaluate the difference between clinical cohort groups or cell groups. All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS 17.0 software (SPSS Incorporation, Chicago, IL). Error bars in figures represent SD (Standard Deviation). The results were considered statistically significant at P < 0.05.
Results
LncRNA PART1 is upregulated in gefitinib-resistant ESCC cells
We first determined the EGFR expression level of ESCC cells by Western blot assay. EGFR was positively expressed in five ESCC cell lines (Fig. 1a ). Then we treated cells with a gradient concentration of gefitinib (0.01–10 μM) for 48 h. Gefitinib induced differential cell growth inhibitory effects in a dose-dependent manner on five esophageal cancer cells (Fig. 1b ). TE1 and KYSE-450 cells were most sensitive to gefitinib treatment, in contrast to the other three cell lines. Therefore, TE1 and KYSE-450 cells were used for the construction of gefitinib-resistant cells through continuous exposure to gradually increasing concentrations of gefitinib, named TE1/GR and KYSE-450/GR, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1c , the gefitinib-resistance induced specific morphological changes, including loss of cell polarity causing spindle-like cell morphology, increased intercellular separation signifying loss of intercellular adhesion, and increased formation of pseudopodia. Compared with parental cells, the established resistant cells showed less response to gefitinib treatment, as evidenced by increased IC 50 values and elevated cell viability (Fig. 1d, e ). Fig. 1 LncRNA PART1 is upregulated in gefitinib-resistant ESCC cells. a Western blot analysis of EGFR expression levels in five ESCC cell lines. b CCK8 assay was performed to evaluate the cell viability of five cell lines after treatment with indicated concentration of gefitinib for 48 h. c Presentation of the established gefitinib-resistant cell lines with specific morphologic changes. d , The IC 50 value of gefitinib was detected for both sensitive and resistant cells by cell viability assay. * P < 0.05 compared to ESCC parental cell group. e , The cell viability of both gefitinib-resistant and sensitive cells were also detected. * P < 0.05 compared to ESCC parental cell group. f , LncRNA microarray data of two-paired gefitinib-resistant and parental cells are presented in a heatmap. g , Determination of IC 50 values of gefitinib for both resistant cell lines after transfection with various siRNAs. *** P < 0.001 compared to Ctrl siRNA group
By using the parental and gefitinib-resistant cell lines, we performed an lncRNA microarray assay to identify the dysregulated lncRNAs between them. The heatmap showed significant differentially expressed lncRNAs between ESCC parental and resistant cell lines (Fig. 1f ), which were then subjected to validation by RT-qPCR using gefitinib-sensitive and resistant ESCC cells. From the six upregulated lncRNAs validated in the first-round RT-qPCR experiments (Additional file 2 : Table S2), we found that interference with the expression of lncRNA PART1 (Prostate Androgen-Regulated Transcript 1, ENST00000152931) reversed gefitinib resistance in both gefitinib-resistant cell lines, while other five lncRNAs showed little effect (Fig. 1g ). Hence, we focused on the functional role of lncRNA PART1.
LncRNA PART1 is induced by STAT1 in gefitinib-resistant ESCC cells
Increasing evidence has revealed that several key transcription factors contribute to lncRNA dysregulation in the human cancer cells, to this end, we searched for transcription factors that might be linked to lncRNA deregulation. Using the online transcription factor prediction software JASPAR ( http://jaspar.genereg.net /), we found that there are several STAT1 binding sites in the lncRNA PART1 promoter regions with high scores (Fig. 2a ). Experimental validation using RT-qPCR showed that STAT1 expression was upregulated in gefitinib-resistant cells when compared to parental cells at both transcript and protein levels (Fig. 2b ). Moreover, transfection of STAT1-overexpression vector dramatically increased PART1 expression levels, whereas knockdown of STAT1 induced decreased expression of PART1 in both gefitinib-resistant cell lines (Fig. 2c, d and Additional file 3 : Figure S1). Consistently, immunofluorescence assays showed that STAT1 was more enriched in the nucleus of TE1/GR cells compared to the parental cells (Fig. 2e ). We also performed a ChIP assay to further verify the enrichment of STAT1 at the promoter region of PART1. As expected, STAT1 was enriched and the enrichment was significantly increased in gefitinib-resistant ESCC cells in contrast to parental cells (Fig. 2f ). In addition, the lncRNA PART1 promoter region including three potential binding sites of STAT1 was inserted into a PGL4 luciferase reporter vector (Fig. 2g ), and dual-luciferase reporter analysis showed that STAT1 promoted the luciferase activity (Fig. 2h ). These results indicated that the upregulation of PART1 in gefitinib-resistant ESCC cells might be induced by STAT1.

LncRNA PART1 is required for gefitinib resistance in ESCC cells
To investigate whether lncRNA PART1 is essential for gefitinib resistance in ESCC cells, we performed a loss-of-function analysis. Small interfering RNAs against lncRNA PART1 were synthesized and incorporated into gefitinib-resistant cells. As shown in Fig. 3a , lncRNA PART1 was dramatically silenced by si-PART1 #1 in both cell lines. Compared with the response of the control group, silencing lncRNA PART1 promoted the cytotoxicity induced by gefitinib treatment (1 μM) (Fig. 3b ). Moreover, knockdown of PART1 resulted in a significant decreased IC 50 and repressed anchorage-independent growth upon gefitinib treatment (Fig. 3c, d ). In addition, flow cytometry analysis indicated that PART1 silencing significantly promoted the proportion of apoptotic cells following treatment with gefitinib in both the resistant cell lines (Fig. 3e ). Collectively, these results suggest that PART1 is essential for gefitinib resistance. Fig. 3 lncRNA PART1 is essential for gefitinib resistance of ESCC cells. a The silencing efficacy was evaluated by RT-qPCR after transfection of three siRNAs of PART1. ** P < 0.01, *** P < 0.001 compared to si-NC group. b Knockdown of PART1 promoted apoptosis induced by gefitinib treatment in both gefitinib-resistant cell lines. * P < 0.05 compared to si-NC group. c The IC 50 value of trastuzumab was detected for both sensitive and resistant cells by CCK8 assay. * P < 0.05 compared to si-NC group. d Colony formation assay analysis of anchorage-independent growth. * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01 compared to si-NC group. e Flow cytometry analysis of cell apoptosis caused by knockdown of lncRNA PART1. * P < 0.05 compared to si-NC group
Extracellular PART1 is transferred through incorporation in exosomes
Exosomes can be actively secreted from a variety of cell types, and exosome-contained lncRNAs can be secreted into culture medium. To investigate whether PART1 is secreted through packaging into exosomes, we detected changes in PART1 expression level after treatment with RNase. As shown in Fig. 4a , the expression level of PART1 in culture medium was little influenced upon RNase treatment but was significantly decreased when treated with RNase and Triton X-100 simultaneously, suggesting that in the culture medium this lncRNA was protected by membrane instead of being directly secreted. To validate the results, we purified and extracted exosomes from culture medium. The representative micrograph taken by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) showed vesicles with round or oval membranes, and a diameter of 20–200 nm under TEM (Fig. 4b ). Exosomes with the size ranging from 30 to 100 nm in diameter accounted for 75%, with a median value of 57.89 nm (Fig. 4c ). A western blot assay for enriched exosome proteins, such as CD63 and CD81 further confirmed their identity (Fig. 4d ). Then, we determined whether PART1 is incorporated into exosomes. Exosomes were isolated from culture medium with the ExoQuick purification kit followed by RT-qPCR. As expected, PART1 was detectable in exosomes, and the expression level was significantly higher in culture medium collected from gefitinib-resistant cells than in culture medium from parental cells (Fig. 4e ). Further characterization of the exosomes by flow cytometry for exosome markers CD63 and CD81 [ ] did not reveal any significant differences between the ESCC parental and resistant-cell derived exosomes (Additional file 3 : Figure S2), indicating that the exosome population is the same between ESCC parental and resistant cells. Fig. 4 Extracellular lncRNA PART1 is packaged into exosomes in ESCC cells a RT-qPCR was performed to detect the expression level of lncRNA PART1 after treatment with 1 μg/mL RNase alone or combined with 0.1% Triton X100 for 30 min. * P < 0.05 compared to RNase A group. b TEM scanning showed the exosomes images released by ESCC cells. c Size distribution of exosomes were analyzed by Zetasizer. d Exosomal protein markers (CD63 and CD81) detection by Western blot from purified exosomes and exosome-depleted cell extracts. e RT-qPCR analysis of lncRNA PART1 expression in exosomal. *** P < 0.001 compared to parental cell group
Exosome-mediated transfer of PART1 disseminates gefitinib resistance
To identify whether PART1 regulates gefitinib resistance via delivery using exosomes, we investigated whether the PART1-contained in exosomes can be taken up by recipient cells using a two-pronged approach. First, we examined whether secreted exosomes can be taken up by recipient cells by labeling isolated exosomes with PKH26 dye from TE1/GR cells. The labeled exosomes were added to the medium and incubated with TE1 and KYSE-450 parental cells. As shown in Fig. 5a , most of the recipient cells showed red signal under confocal microscope. Second, we examined whether these exosomes could deliver PART1 to recipient cells similar to the intercellular transfer of other non-coding RNA as previously reported [ ]. RT-qPCR showed an increased expression of PART1 in both recipient cell lines incubated with exosomes from TE1/GR cells for 48 h (Fig. 5b ). These results suggest that the PART1-contained in exosomes can be taken up by recipient cells. Fig. 5 Exosome mediated transfer of lncRNA PART1 induces gefitinib resistance. a Intercellular trafficking of exosomes among different cell lines by isolated exosomes labeled with PKH26 dye. b RT-qPCR analysis of exosomal lncRNA PART1 expression level in cells treated with extracted exosomes or blank control for 48 h. ** P < 0.01 compared to PBS control c CCK8 assay was used for the detection of cell viability in the two cell lines after treatment with extracted exosomes or blank control for 48 h. * P < 0.05 compared to PBS control d Knockdown of lncRNA PART1 abrogated the effect induced by exosome treatment as evidenced by CCK8 assay. * P < 0.05 compared to si-NC + Exosome group
Subsequently, we determined whether TE1 and KYSE-450 cells with elevated exosomal PART1 expression levels displayed an increased resistance to gefitinib treatment compared to control cells. As expected, both recipient cell lines showed decreased cell death as compared with control cells when treated with gefitinib (1 μM, 48 h) (Fig. 5c ). However, a direct inhibition of PART1 in parental cells abrogated this effect (Fig. 5d ), indicating that the increased gefitinib-resistant potency was induced by treatment with exosomal PART1.
Bcl-2 signaling pathway is responsible for PART1-mediated gefitinib resistance
To determine how exosomal lncRNA PART1 contributes to gefitinib resistance, we used Cignal Signal Transduction Reporter Array to simultaneously investigate the activity changes of 50 canonical signaling pathways in TE1 parental cells upon treatment of exosomes derived from TE1/GR cells. Notably, we identified Bcl-2 signaling as one of the most significantly activated pathways after treatment with exosomes containing PART1 (Fig. 6a ). Western blot experiments showed that exosome treatment promoted Bcl-2 expression and inhibited Bax expression in TE1 cells. However, knockdown of PART1 dramatically reversed this effect (Fig. 6b ). To investigate whether exosomal PART1 expression promotes gefitinib resistance through regulating Bcl-2-mediated cell apoptosis, we performed a TUNEL assay upon inhibition of Bcl-2. As shown in Fig. 6c , exosome treatment inhibited cell apoptosis levels, and this effect was abrogated by co-treatment with Bcl-2 inhibitor venetoclax. A cell viability experiment also suggested that venetoclax partially reversed the gefitinib resistance induced by the treatment with PART1-contained in exosomes (Fig. 6d ). Therefore, exosomal PART1 may induce gefitinib resistance through inhibiting apoptotic proteins and cell apoptosis via Bcl-2/Bax pathway. Fig. 6 Exosomal lncRNA PART1 promotes gefitinib resistance by activating Bcl-2 signaling pathway. a Histogram shows the fold changes for the activities of different signaling pathways, as indicated by reporter activity. b Western blot analysis showed that knockdown of SNHG14 reversed the effect of exosomal treatment. c TUNEL assay showed that exosome treatment inhibited cell apoptosis levels, but this effect was abrogated by simultaneous treatment of Bcl-2 inhibitor venetoclax. ** P < 0.01 compared to Exosome group. d Treatment with venetoclax abrogated the PART1-induced gefitinib resistance. *** P < 0.01 compared to negative control group
LncRNA PART1 mediates Bcl-2 expression through functioning as a ceRNA for miR-129
It is widely accepted that lncRNAs may function as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) to regulate the target mRNA of miRNAs. To test this hypothesis, we first determined the localization of PART1 expression in ESCC cells. By using the online lncRNA location prediction software lncLocator ( http://www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/bioinf/lncLocator/ ), we identified that PART1 expression was predicted to be located in the cytoplasm (Fig. 7a ). In addition, RT-qPCR analysis of nuclear and cytoplasmic lncRNA showed that lncRNA PART1 was enriched in the cytoplasm section of both TE1 and KYSE-450 gefitinib-resistant cells (Fig. 7b ). Fluorescent in situ hybridization of PART1 with a specific probe further confirmed that PART1 was mainly expressed in the cytoplasm section (Fig. 7c ). To confirm PART1 exerted this effect through associating with Bcl-2-targeted miRNAs, we performed an RIP assay on Ago2, the core component of the RNA-induced mediating complex. It is evident that both PART1 and Bcl-2 expression was enriched with Ago2 (Fig. 7d ). In addition, overexpression with PART1 resulted in an increased interaction between Ago2 and PART1, but elicited a decrease in the interaction between Ago2 and Bcl-2 transcript (Fig. 7e ), indicating that PART1 could compete with Bcl-2 transcripts for the Ago2-based miRNA-mediated silencing complex. Fig. 7 LncRNA PART1 mediates Bcl-2 expression through functioning as a ceRNA for miR-129. a Presentation of score of lncRNA PART1 at different subcellular locations by lncLocator ( http://www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/bioinf/lncLocator/ ). b The expression level of PART1 in nuclear and cytoplasm of ESCC cells.

Subsequently, we determined the miRNAs that participated in the sponging of the PART1 and Bcl-2 pathway. Interestingly, miR-129 was predicted to target both Bcl-2 and PART1 as shown in Fig. 7f . Additionally, miR-129 is downregulated in both gefitinib-resistant cell lines in contrast with their respective parental cell lines (Fig. 7g ). Meanwhile, a significant downregulation of Bcl-2 was identified upon transfection of cells with miR-129 mimics (Fig. 7h ). By cloning wild or mutant 3′-UTR of Bcl-2 and PART1 downstream into PGL4 luciferase reporters (Fig. 7f ), we performed a luciferase reporter assay to detect the interaction of miR-129 with both reporters. As expected, luciferase activity was significantly suppressed by overexpression of miR-129 with both PART1 and Bcl-2 wild type reporters, but little effect was observed with mutant Bcl-2 reporters (Fig. 7i - k ). A RIP experiment also revealed that the overexpression of PART1 inhibited the interaction between miR-129 and Bcl-2, and silencing PART1 increased this effect (Fig. 7l, m ). Taken together, our results suggest that lncRNA PART1 serves as a molecular sponge for miR-129 to regulate the expression of Bcl-2.
LncRNA PART1 facilitates gefitinib resistance in vivo
To determine the effect of lncRNA PART1 on gefitinib resistance in vivo, we established a model of nude mice bearing TE1 xenografts. TE1 parental cells stably transfected with lentivirus vector containing PART1 plasmid (Lv-PART1) or negative control (Lv-NC) were injected into the flanks of nude mice. After the tumors were established, mice injected with both kinds of TE1 cells were treated orally with a daily dose of 150 mg/kg gefitinib or 1% Tween80 as control for four weeks. Four xenograft treatment groups were established: Group I (Lv-PART1-transfected cells + gefitinib treatment), Group II (Lv-PART1-transfected cells + 1% Tween80), Group III (Lv-NC-transfected cells + gefitinib treatment), Group IV (Lv-NC-transfected cells + 1% Tween80). More than three mice in each group remained after excluding mice that were dead or developed complications, such as skin necrosis due to infection. Tumors were stripped and tumor mass was quantified (Fig. 8a ). The results showed that gefitinib treatment significantly inhibited the growth of tumor cells when compared with control groups (Group I vs. Group II, and Group III vs. Group IV, respectively, Fig. 8b ). More importantly, with gefitinib treatment, tumor cells infected with Lv-PART1 grew faster than controls (Group I vs. Group III), suggesting that PART1 repressed the cell cytotoxicity induced by treatment with gefitinib in vivo. To verify whether miR-129 could rescue the effects of PART1, we performed gain- and loss-function experiments in vivo. We found that co-transfection with Lv-miR-129 could reverse the Lv-PART1-induced gefitinib resistance (Additional file 3 : Figure S3), which further confirmed that miR-129 can enhance anti-cancer drug response in gefitinib resistant ESCC.

In addition, immunohistochemistry (IHC) was conducted to determine whether PART1 affects the expression of Bcl-2, Bax, caspase-3 and PARP in xenograft tumor tissues. As shown in Fig. 8c , PART1 promoted the expression of Bcl-2, downregulated the expression of Bax, cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP in the Group I xenograft mice when compared to Group III mice.
Serum exosomal PART1 level is upregulated in gefitinib-resistant patients
Following this, we sought to determine PART1 expression in exosomes, and the expression module in ESCC patients. We extracted exosomes from 79 serum samples from advanced ESCC cancer patients who received gefitinib treatment. Patients were divided into responding (CR + PR, 42 patients) and non-responding (SD + PD, 37 patients) groups according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST, version 1.1) [ ]. Our results showed that PART1 expression is detectable in extracted serum exosomes, and is more highly expressed in patients who did not respond to gefitinib treatment than in those who responded to gefitinib (Fig. 9A ). Since higher stability is a critical prerequisite for tumor markers, we next tested the stability of PART1 in serum exosomes by exposing exosomes to different conditions including incubation at room temperature (0, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h), RNase A digestion, and low (pH = 1) or high (pH = 13) pH solution for 3 h at room temperature. Our results suggested that the exosomal PART1 expression level was not significantly influenced by any of the experimental conditions (Fig. 9b - d ), indicating that exosomal PART1 expression was stable in serum exosomes. In addition, we used the ROC curve to evaluate the diagnostic value of exosomal PART1 in serum. The ROC analysis demonstrated an area under curve (AUC) of 0.839, with a diagnostic sensitivity and specificity reaching 78.6 and 86.5%, respectively (95% CI = 0.739–0.912) (Fig. 9e ). Based on the cut-offs established by ROC (0.1103), the proportion of patients not responding to gefitinib therapy was significantly higher in the high exosomal PART1 expressing group than in the low expressing group (Fig. 9f ). Altogether, these results indicate that exosomal PART1 in serum is stable and can serve as a promising diagnostic biomarker for ESCC patients.

In gefitinib-resistant ESCC cells, lncRNA PART1 promotes gefitinib resistance by targeting Bcl-2 signaling, inducing the suppression of apoptotic proteins expression and inhibition of cell apoptosis. Moreover, lncRNA PART1 can be packaged into exosomes and secreted from gefitinib-resistant ESCC cells, transferring resistance to recipient-sensitive cells
Discussion
Extensive efforts in the past have contributed to the understanding of both molecular and cellular mechanisms of action for chemoresistance, one of the major causes for the failure of treatment of advanced cancer types. However, little progress has been made ever since [ ]. However, novel molecular signatures seem to hold great promise for tumor characterization and could be used as potential prognostic markers and as treatment targets. To identify potential molecular therapeutic markers for gefitinib treatment, we focused on lncRNAs in exosome, and investigated the functional correlation between gefitinib resistance and specific lncRNAs in ESCC. Our own data showed that exosomal lncRNA PART1 was upregulated in gefitinib-resistant ESCC cells and was functionally required for gefitinib resistance. LncRNA PART1 was found to promote gefitinib resistance through sponging miR-129 and activating the Bcl-2 signaling pathway. In addition, PART1 was released from resistant cells via packaging into exosomes, and treatment with exosomes extracted from gefitinib-resistant cells potently induced a resistant phenotype in parental cells (Fig. 10 ). Thus, lncRNA PART1 was identified as a critical regulator gene in the formation of gefitinib resistance. Fig. 10 A schematic diagram of exosomal lncRNA PART1 in ESCC gefitinib resistance
EGFR is critical to proliferation and survival pathways, and activating mutations are often seen in ESCC. EGFR mutations occur more frequently in Asian patients compared with Caucasian patients [ ]. Gefitinib (Iressa, AstraZeneca) is an orally administered, small-molecule EGFR-TK inhibitor that blocks signal transduction pathways implicated in proliferation and survival of cancer cells. A phase II clinical study showed that radiotherapy concurrent with gefitinib treatment is effective in and tolerable to elderly Chinese ESCC patients [ ]. However, acquired resistance to targeted therapies, defined as progression after initial benefit, inevitably occurs [ ]. Therefore, breakthroughs are needed in the understanding and treatment of acquired gefitinib resistance, especially for patients with EGFR mutations and ALK rearrangement-positive sites.
To elucidate the functional mechanism and resistance of gefitinib in ESCC, we focused on lncRNAs, which have been identified as playing critical roles in cancer progression. Therefore, we performed microarray analysis to find the potential dysregulated lncRNAs in gefitinib-resistant cells in contrast to parental ESCC cell lines. By using two-step approaches, we identified lncRNA PART1 as a potential lncRNA that plays an important role in enhancing gefitinib resistance. LncRNA PART1 (ENST00000152931), which is located on chromosome 5: 59783540-59,843,484, has been rarely reported. It was firstly described by Lin et al. as a regulator involved in androgen receptor-regulated gene network of the human prostate that may play a role in the etiology of prostate carcinogenesis [ ]. Recent reports indicated that PART1 expression is upregulated and functions as an oncogene in colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, and oral squamous cell carcinoma [ , , ]. However, its role in ESCC and chemoresistance is still unknown. Herein, we reported, a novel function of PART1 in gefitinib resistance. PART1 is activated by the transcription factor STAT1 and inhibition of PART1 could resensitize resistant cells to gefitinib treatment, indicating that PART1 is essential for the maintenance of a gefitinib-resistant status in ESCC cells.
In recent years, it has been accepted that lncRNAs could be protected from degradation in the circulation by exosomes and could be useful for monitoring cancer at the early stage [ , ]. Exosomes are nano-sized vesicles secreted upon the fusion of vesicular-like properties with plasma membranes in large amount of cell types [ ]. Emerging evidence has uncovered the unique properties of exosomes, including their ability to enclose specific miRNAs, circRNAs or lncRNAs, their stability and easy detection in circulatory system [ ]. They have been identified as intercellular messengers, acting through the transfer of constituents, such as lncRNAs [ ]. In this study, we found that PART1 could be packaged into exosomes when released into extracellular culture medium. Knockdown of PART1 in gefitinib-resistant cells promoted cell apoptosis, and treatment with exosomes extracted from culture medium of resistant cells potently reduced gefitinib-induced cell death. In addition, our integrated approaches revealed that exosomal PART1 induced gefitinib resistance through targeting the Bcl-2-related apoptosis signaling pathway, suggesting exosomal PART1 promotes gefitinib resistance of ESCC cells mainly through regulating apoptosis-related proteins.
To get a deeper understanding of the role of PART1 in ESCC, we localized its expression in ESCC cells and found that PART1 expression was enriched in the cytoplasm. It is well known that lncRNAs located in the cytoplasm may function as miRNA sponges, thus indirectly regulating the expression level of targeted mRNA. Comprehensive bioinformatics analysis combined with luciferase reporter assay and immunoprecipitation experiments verified that miR-129 is a direct target of both PART1 and Bcl-2 gene, and is responsible for the PART1-mediated gefitinib resistance. Previously, Karaayvaz et al. demonstrated that miR-129 promotes apoptosis and enhances chemoresponse to 5-fluorouracil in colorectal cancer cells [ ], and our date is consistent with this conclusion on the role of miR-129 in cell apoptosis and chemoresistance.
Based on the functional observations, we determined the exosomal PART1 level in clinical serum samples. Several attempts have been made to use lncRNAs in serum or plasma as useful predictors [ , ]. Nevertheless, these potential tumor biomarkers are often in relatively low abundance and degradation easily occurs. LncRNAs are enriched and more stable in the circulatory exosome system and protected from RNase degradation. Therefore, the identification of exosomal lncRNAs in bodily fluids suggested their predictive application in clinical diagnosis or prognosis for different types of cancer [ ]. Emerging evidence has uncovered the unique properties of exosomes, including their ability to enclose specific lncRNAs, their stability and easy detection in circulatory system [ ]. It is interesting that exosomal PART1 was slightly increased in RNase A digestion group. We speculate that the density of exosome is very low in peripheral blood, thus the detection of exosomal PART1 is not very sensitive. However, the underlying mechanism needs further investigation.
Conclusions
In summary, our findings suggest that exosome-mediated transfer of lncRNA PART1 induces gefitinib resistance in ESCC cells, and exosomal PART1 levels in human serum may be considered a potential diagnostic biomarker for ESCC patients, enhancing the clinical benefits of gefitinib therapy.
