Introduction
Oral cancer is a significant health problem, being the sixth most common cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide [ ]. More than 500,000 patients are estimated to have oral cancer globally with approximately 389,000 new cases per annum [ ]. Notably, the incidence and mortality rates as a result of oral cancer are higher in developing countries as compared to the developed world [ , ].
The etiology of oral cancer is multi-factorial, but the most important risk factors are tobacco use, excess alcohol consumption, betel quid chewing, and combinations of these habits [ ]. Human papilloma virus (HPV) infection is implicated mainly in oropharyngeal cancer, and ultraviolet light is the main factor in lip cancer [ ]. Other factors possibly implicated in mouth and oropharyngeal cancers include immunosuppression [ ] and familial and genetic factors [ ].
The cancer has a strong association with smoking and alcohol [ , ]. The relative risk of oral cancer increases between 10- and 15-fold in smokers [ ]. Unfortunately, smoking is a very common habit among young males in Saudi Arabia; according to previous research, the prevalence of smoking is 21 % among the general adult population and 25 % among university students, which is considered one of the highest figures in the world [ ]. Additionally, Saudi Arabia has a large expatriate community particularly people of Southeast Asian origin, in which social habits such as areca nut chewing are common. Subsequently, these factors will contribute to an increased incidence of oral cancer in Saudi Arabia in future years [ , ].
Oral cancer has been reported to have one of the lowest 5-year survival rates of all cancers, probably because most lesions are not diagnosed in the early stages [ , ]. Generally, survival rates decline with the advancement of the stage of the disease in which TNM stages I and II have comparatively higher survival rates than stages III and IV [ ].
Many patients who have undergone successful treatment for oral cancer may have to face some functional and cosmetic impairment that include difficulties in eating, swallowing, speaking, and disfigurement. This may have significant adverse impact on their quality of life [ ]. The detection of oral cancer at an early stage of the disease is the most effective means of improving survival as well as the morbidity and disfigurement [ ].
Published literature has indicated that lack of public awareness about signs and risk factors of oral cancer can contribute to the late diagnosis and poor prognosis [ , ]. Any increase in the understanding about signs, symptoms, and early detection of oral cancer among the general population can thus help in prevention, early detection, and better prognosis of the disease. In Saudi Arabia, data regarding public knowledge of oral cancer are scarce [ , ]. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to assess the levels of public awareness, knowledge about the signs, and risk factors of oral cancer among hospital attending dental patients in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
Methods
This cross-sectional study was conducted between January and March 2015. Around 1750 questionnaires were sent to dental patients attending dental departments of five public hospitals in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia (350 questionnaires for each hospital). Initially, around eight public hospitals were considered for inclusion in the current survey of which only five agreed to participate. These hospitals were chosen because they were located in different parts of Riyadh and because they had a high patient load. All patients aged 15 years and over were randomly selected for the study. The sample size was calculated based on the proportion of awareness among adults in Yemen of 75 at 95 % confidence level with an absolute precision of 5 %, giving a minimum sample size of 228 [ ]. The study was approved by the Al-Farabi College Institutional Ethical Review Board, and informed consents were obtained from the participants.
We used a self-administered questionnaire adapted from a pretested questionnaire that has been applied in similar studies [ , ]. A pilot study was conducted on a random sample of Saudi patients attending Al-Farabi teaching hospital ( n = 30) to ensure clarity and practicability of the questions. No major amendments were required following feedback from the pilot. Participation in the study was completely voluntary, and participants were informed that they could withdraw at any time and that their responses would be anonymous and treated confidentially.
The self-administered questionnaire consisted of close-ended questions divided into four groups with relevant questions to ascertain sociodemographic factors (age, gender, and education background), habits, awareness of oral cancer (one item), general knowledge on oral cancer (three items), and knowledge of signs/symptoms (four items) and risk factors for oral cancer (five items). Responses to knowledge questions were assessed as correct or incorrect, and knowledge scores were calculated for each participant to obtain the mean total knowledge on oral cancer. Oral cancer awareness was ascertained by asking the following question: “Have you ever heard of mouth cancer?”. The education level of the participants was grouped as illiterate (no school education), elementary (maximum up to grade 9), high school (grades 10–12), and college/university.
The participants were asked to complete the questionnaires in the waiting rooms of the dental offices while waiting for their appointments. Illiterate participants were interviewed face to face by one of the investigators.
SPSS (IBM ® Statistical Package for Social Studies) version 20.0 was used for data entry and analyses. A knowledge score was calculated for each participant based on the answers to the 12 knowledge items. A total knowledge score out of 12 was computed for each participant with possible scores ranging from 0 to 12. The quantitative data were presented as means and standard deviations. The chi-squared test, Student t test, and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to compare groups. P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Out of the 1750 distributed questionnaires, 1500 were returned for a response rate of 86 %. Of these, 1410 had been properly completed and were analyzed. The sample comprised 56.6 % females and 43.4 % males. The mean age of the participants was 33.82 years ± 13.15 (range 15–90) with 73.1 % in the 15–39-year-old age group. More than one third of the participants had college/university education, and 27.3 % were smokers (Table 1 ).

Table 2 shows awareness of oral cancer with different demographic characters. Only 62.4 % of the participants had heard of oral cancer, with no significant differences between genders ( P > 0.05). It was noted that the general awareness was significantly higher among participants with the highest level of education and those with greater frequency of dental visits ( P = 0.000). Young participants showed higher rates of oral cancer awareness as compared to the old age groups, although the difference was not statistically significant. Among patients who were aware of oral cancer, around 37.6 % gained the information from the public media (TV, radio, and the Internet), 20.0 % from their dentist, and 10 % from the physicians (Fig. 1 ).

Around two thirds of the participants (69 %) believed that oral cancer is preventable, and 57.2 % believed that it is treatable. There was, however, certain misconception about oral cancer, as a considerable portion of the participants (21.3 %) believed that oral cancer is a contagious disease. When asked about the risk factors of oral cancer, the most recognized risk factors were smoking (68.2 %), smokeless tobacco (56.9 %), and alcohol (56.5 %). Only 34.4 % identified older age as a risk factor, and only 22.1 % could identify sun exposure as a risk factor in case of lip cancer (Table 3 ). Table 3 Responses to questions regarding knowledge about OC Variable Yes (%) No (%) Do not know (%) General knowledge OC is preventable 69.0 7.7 23.3 OC can be treated 57.2 10.1 32.7 OC is contagious 21.3 37.9 40.8 Risk factors for OC Old age 34.4 20.6 45.0 Smoking 68.2 9.9 21.8 Smokeless tobacco use 56.9 11.6 31.4 Alcohol drinking 56.5 13.8 29.8 Sun exposure 22.1 30.6 47.3 Signs of OC Non-healing ulcer 31.9 15.6 52.5 Red patch 26.1 18.1 55.8 White patch 25.9 17.8 56.3 Lump 44.2 9.1 46.7 OC oral cancer
The participants showed poor knowledge regarding the early signs and symptoms of oral cancer. Overall, the proportion of the recognized clinical signs ranged from 25.9 to 44.2 %, with only one quarter of the participants could identify white (25.9 %) and red (26.1 %) patches as clinical signs of oral cancer (Table 3 ).
The total mean score of knowledge was 5.23 ± 3.03 (range = 0–12). A significant correlation was noted between the level of knowledge and level of education and regular dental visits ( P = 0.000). However, no significant association was noted between level of knowledge and age ( P = 0.259), gender ( P = 0.368), and smoking habits ( P = 0.709; Table 4 ).

Discussion
More than 50 % of oral cancer cases are diagnosed at advanced stages. Knowledge regarding risk factors and early signs of oral cancer among the public can help in prevention and early detection of the disease. We conducted a large multicenter survey to examine awareness and knowledge regarding signs and risk factors of oral cancer among patients attending dental departments of public hospitals in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
The present study highlights a very alarming lack of knowledge on oral cancer, with only 62.4 % of subjects were aware of oral cancer. Although this rate of awareness is slightly higher than that reported among comparable hospital-based populations in Australia (52.3) [ ], Jordan (45.6) [ ], and the UK (56 %) [ ], this figure is much lower than that reported in India (91.2) [ ], Sri Lanka (95) [ ], Yemen (71.5) [ ], and the USA (84 %) [ ]. Notably, higher levels of oral awareness have been reported from countries with a known high prevalence of oral cancer such as India and Sri Lanka. The high prevalence of oral cancer in these countries and the displayed educational materials about this disease such as posters and pamphlets in public hospitals to which the public has free access are contributory to this high level of awareness [ ].
The results of this study reflect a previous study in the UK by Warankulsurya et al. [ ], which found that the public awareness of oral cancer in the UK was very poor with only 56 % of the participants being aware, in comparison to lung cancer of which the awareness was very high (97 %). This emphasizes the importance of initiating intensive public education programs targeting the public to increase levels of oral cancer knowledge.
Public media such as radio, TV, and the Internet plays a pivotal role in educating people about oral cancer [ , , ]. The present study confirmed this finding by being the most reported common source of information about oral cancer. A recent Malaysian study has assessed the impact of promoting oral cancer awareness of the public using a mass media campaign; the results showed a significant increase in the public awareness regarding general knowledge and etiology factors of the disease [ ]. Disappointingly, only one fifth of subjects in this study knew about oral cancer from their dentists. This finding is in agreement with several awareness surveys that reported that the role played by dentists in educating their patients is secondary [ , , , , ]. Limited patient attendance or accessibility to dental care personnel and deficiencies in knowledge among dental professional may explain why dentists are playing a lesser influential role than mass media in conveying oral cancer awareness among the public. In a survey among general dental practitioners, Horowitz et al. [ ] found that only 25 % of dentists strongly agreed that they were adequately trained in providing oral cancer examinations. This highlights the fact that improvement of the knowledge of dentists on oral cancer would increase the likelihood that a dentist will be a leading source of passing knowledge to their patients.
Public knowledge of the risk factors is one of the most important parameters for successful prevention of oral cancer in the community. In the present study, the knowledge regarding risk factors was rather poor; although around two thirds of the subjects identified tobacco use as a risk factor, only 56 % knew that alcohol consumption is also a potential risk factor. These findings are in line with most studies, which found greater public awareness of tobacco as a risk factor compared with alcohol consumption [ , , , , , ]. The greater awareness of tobacco as a risk factor could be attributed to anti-tobacco media campaigns explaining the adverse effects of smoking. In the present study, around one third of Saudi subjects were tobacco smokers, and, surprisingly, although the majority of smokers (62.3 %) knew that smoking was a risk factor for oral cancer, they continued to smoke. Similarly, majority of smoking adults from Italy [ ] and more than half of smoking adults from Kuwait [ ] were aware of the correlation between heavy smoking and oral cancer but, nevertheless, continued to smoke. Patients knew that smoking and heavy alcohol consumption were risk factors for oral cancer but did not change behavior. Further investigations have to be carried out to find out the reasons behind the continued practice of high-risk habits, despite knowledge. Health education should be carried out to bridge the gap between the knowledge and awareness of oral cancer and their risk habits and the practice of these habits. It has been reported that health education could result in a significant proportion of subjects giving up their tobacco habits [ ]. Also, dental health professionals need to focus on changing their patients’ behavior, in addition to educating patients about oral cancer risk factors.
Identification of oral cancer early signs and symptoms is of paramount importance for early detection of the disease and thus early treatment and good prognosis. In the present study, unfortunately, the knowledge pertaining clinical presentation of oral cancer was remarkably unsatisfactory, with only less than quarter of the participants were aware of different presentation of cancer in the mouth. These findings are consistent with most of the published studies, which reported lack of public knowledge regarding early signs of oral cancer [ , , , , , ]. Hence, raising awareness and educating the public on the early signs of cancers is mandatory for early diagnosis and treatment of the disease.
Several socioeconomic factors may affect the public oral cancer knowledge and awareness. In the present study, we found a significant association between the level of knowledge and education and frequency of dental visits. Participants educated at university level or higher displayed a greater level of knowledge about oral cancer. This finding is supported by previous studies, which have documented that knowledge is proportional to the education level of respondents [ , , , , ]. Also, participants who visited their dentists regularly have shown significantly better level of knowledge. This again emphasizes the important role that dentists can play in passing knowledge about oral cancer to their patients. Younger age group showed relatively greater level of knowledge, which can be attributed to their higher education level (as noted above) and to their wider exposures to mass media such as Internet, TV, and social networks.
Strength and Limitations
The sample size and high response rate of this study can be considered among its strong points compared with previous studies. However, the study had several limitations, and the results need to be interpreted with caution. One limitation is the fact that this study was primarily a hospital-based survey; as such, our results may not be generalizable to the whole population in Saudi Arabia. Well-designed population-based studies are therefore needed to assess, in greater detail, public knowledge about oral cancer. Another limitation is that in attempting to assess the participants’ knowledge by the use of the close-ended questions, such questions could have been considered “leading questions”; in that, the most of questions were typically asked so that “yes” was the correct answer. Since the appropriate answer was embedded in the question, some respondents probably tended to agree with statements rather than disagree, which would artificially overestimate level of knowledge. Nevertheless, despite these limitations, this study provides valuable baseline information on the level of oral cancer awareness and knowledge among Saudi dental patients.
In summary, we investigated on the awareness and knowledge on oral cancer among dental patients in Riyadh. The study revealed an alarming lack of knowledge regarding risk factors and early signs of oral cancer which requires to be readily addressed. Public health promotion, education initiatives, and awareness campaigns utilizing mass media should be implemented to improve levels of knowledge about oral cancer nationwide.
