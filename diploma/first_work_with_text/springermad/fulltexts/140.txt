Introduction
Recently two direct-conversion cadmium-zinc-telluride (CZT) detector cameras have become available: the D-SPECT (Spectrum Dynamics, Caesarea Israel) and Discovery 530c (D530c, GE Healthcare, Haifa Israel).
These systems enhance the sensitivity of count detection enabling the reduction of scan times and/or tracer activity using very different technologies: 9 mobile columns of CZT detectors with wide parallel-hole collimators for D-SPECT and 19 fixed CZT detectors with multi-pinhole collimators for the D530c.
Several studies have been published since CZT cameras were implemented in the clinical practice. The major aim of these studies was to evaluate the physical characteristics, , the performances in comparison to conventional Anger cameras, , their potential to reduce scan times and/or tracer activity, , and/or their effectiveness in clinical use. ,
The superior performances reported for these two CZT systems in comparison to conventional Anger cameras, although based on identical detector material, are strictly dependent on the intrinsically different technology and acquisition techniques which are, in clinical conditions, potentially capable of producing significantly different results.
The only published study comparing different CZT cameras showed different performances depending on the figure of merit considered. However, it was restricted to only a single point of the count statistic (500 kilocounts over the left ventricle) and used a simplified phantom, which is not expected to accurately mimic the conditions encountered during clinical acquisitions.
The aim of this study was to characterize the relative performances of the above-mentioned CZT cameras over a wide range of acquisition count statistics, using an anthropomorphic phantom and selected physical figures of merit for the image evaluation. The application of attenuation correction was also studied with the D530c.
Materials and Methods
Gamma cameras
Two nuclear medicine departments (referred later as ‘centers’) participated to the study allowing the use of the following gamma cameras: D-SPECT (Center N.1) and D530c (Center N.2). The scanners characteristics and the acquisition and reconstruction protocols are detailed in Table 1 . Table 1 Details of gamma cameras, acquisition, and reconstruction protocols used for the phantom studies D-SPECT Discovery 530c # Acquisition Collimator Wide-angle parallel hole Multi-pinhole Energy window 140 keV ± 10% 140 keV ± 10% Number of projections 120 (×9 blocks) 19 Detector angle between consecutive projections 0.4°-7°* Fixed detector Reconstruction Method Iterative 3D Iterative 3D Number of iterations × subsets (4 + 3) × 32 60 × 1 Iteration filter Kernel (0.125 mm) Post reconstruction filter Normalization filter § Butterworth (order 7, cutoff 0.37 cm −1 ) # Offline CT was employed to acquire the attenuation map used to correct the emission data. * Angles are approximately 0.4° for projections passing through cardiac region (as defined by ROI positioning on the left ventricle on prescan images) and up to 7° for other projections. § Proprietary infomations.
Both D-SPECT and D530c use identical square CZT modules. Each module consists of a 16x16 pixelated CZT crystal backed by a proprietary application-specific integrated circuit.
The D-SPECT system uses 9 rotating detector column blocks of pixelated CZT detectors (pixel size, 2.5 × 2.5 mm) associated with a wide-angle square-hole tungsten collimator. A total of 120 projections are recorded by each block. D-SPECT requires a brief prescan, thereafter the technologist draws a region of interest (ROI) to define the left ventricle (LV) for cardiocentric detector column movements. Utilizing count rate information from the prescan, D-SPECT adjusts scan time in 1 second increments to attain a predetermined number of counts. A specific algorithm of iterative reconstruction is used to compensate for the collimator-related loss in spatial resolution.
D530c employs an L-shaped array of 19 stationary pinhole units, which are placed over an arc of 180°, orientated to focus on the heart area and arranged in three rows. Each unit consists of a tungsten-tipped lead-bodied pinhole collimator with an effective aperture of 5.1 mm, projecting onto 4 CZT modules of 32x32 CZT pixels (pixel size, 2.5 × 2.5 mm) arranged in a 2 × 2 square. Nineteen projections are thus recorded, and an iterative reconstruction allows modeling for collimator geometry. Attenuation correction for the D530c studies was performed by means of a computed tomography scan of the phantom.
After phantom acquisitions and image reconstruction, image quality evaluation and statistical analysis were performed at a core laboratory.
Anthropomorphic Phantom Preparation
An anthropomorphic phantom of the chest, with inserts simulating lungs, liver, spine, LV wall, LV chamber, and a transmural defect (TD), was used (Torso Phantom™ and Cardiac Insert™, Data Spectrum Corporation, Hillsborough, NC,USA) (Figure 1 ). The ratio of radioactivity concentrations for the different inserts in the phantom study was derived from a previous publication. The TD insert (45° × 2 cm) was filled with non-radioactive water and located in mid-septal position in the LV wall. The lung inserts, filled with Styrofoam™ beads and non-radioactive water, were used to simulate lung tissue attenuation density. The other phantom chambers were filled with 99m Tc solutions of different radioactivity concentrations: 158 ± 5 kBq·mL −1 for LV wall, 95 ± 3 kBq·mL −1 for liver, and 8.1 ± 0.6 kBq·mL −1 for chest and LV chamber. Actual activity concentrations in the phantom’s chambers were planned using activity meters with an accuracy within 5%, as measured during routine quality controls. All compartment contents were well mixed to avoid artifacts caused by inhomogeneous activity. The same phantom was used in all centers. The accurate positioning of the phantom was secured by a flat portion of the phantom which allowed a reproducible positioning on the imaging bed and by marking the position of the first acquisition. Figure 1 The anthropomorphic torso phantom used for the study
Phantom Acquisitions and Reconstruction
In each center, two sets (with and without TD) of scans were acquired starting from the in vivo standard count statistics of 1 × 10 6 counts in the LV. Then, the other two acquisitions corresponding to 150% and 50% of the reference count statistics were acquired, changing in each step only the acquisition time. Images were reconstructed using all the reconstruction parameters currently recommended for clinical routine (Table 2 ). Images were reconstructed with and without the attenuation correction (AC) for the D530c. No AC is currently available on the D-SPECT.

Image Quality Evaluation
After reconstruction, all image sets were sent to a core laboratory for processing using the following five physical figures of merit, associated with image quality in cardiac SPECT: (a) LV wall thickness; (b) Sharpness index; (c) Contrast between LV wall and inner chamber; (d) Contrast-to-noise ratio; (e) TD contrast with LV wall;
*** The first four indexes were evaluated using the image sets without TD insert in the LV wall. For each figure of merit, each measurement was repeated at least fourfold in order to provide an estimate of the measurement errors. The figures of merit were evaluated using ImageJ software.
LV wall thickness
The LV wall thickness was evaluated as “full width at half maximum” (FWHM) of the myocardial signal in the mid-ventricular section of the LV short axis. The FWHM was calculated convolving the central count profile, obtained using ImageJ software, with a theoretical Gaussian one. The true wall thickness of the LV phantom insert is 10 mm.
Sharpness index
A sharpness index was determined on the horizontal profile of the mid-ventricular short-axis slice. This index was computed as the maximal slope of the decrease in myocardial counts (cm −1 ) on the epicardial border of the lateral wall and after exclusion of the low-count part of the profile (activities < 25% of the maximal value).
Contrast between LV wall and inner chamber
Two ROIs were drawn on the mid-ventricular short-axis images in order to estimate \( \overline{{\eta_{\text{LV}} }} \) and \( \overline{{\eta_{\text{IC}} }} \) as the mean concentration activity per voxel for LV wall and inner cavity, respectively. The percent contrast between LV wall and inner cavity ( C IC ) was defined as the ratio between measured contrast ( C M ) and the true one ( C T ) as: $$ C_{\text{IC}} (\% ) = \frac{{C_{\text{M}} }}{{C_{\text{T}} }} \times 100, $$ where C M and C T were calculated using: $$ C_{\text{M}} = \frac{{\overline{{\eta_{\text{LV}} }} - \overline{{\eta_{\text{IC}} }} }}{{\overline{{\eta_{\text{LV}} }} + \overline{{\eta_{\text{IC}} }} }} $$ $$ C_{\text{T}} = \frac{{\overline{{C_{\text{LV}} }} - \overline{{C_{\text{IC}} }} }}{{\overline{{C_{\text{LV}} }} + \overline{{C_{\text{IC}} }} }} $$ and \( \overline{{C_{\text{LV}} }} \) and \( \overline{{C_{\text{IC}} }} \) are the true activity concentrations in the inserts simulating the LV and the inner chamber, respectively. The ideal value for C IC is 100% for all center acquisitions. Figure 2 A provides a schematic representation of the ROI dimensioning and placement for the calculation of C IC (%). Figure 2 Example of the ROI dimension and position used for the evaluation of the image quality indexes: A C IC ; B CNR; C C TD
Contrast-to-noise ratio
This ratio was determined on the mid-ventricular short-axis slice of each SPECT recording. Mean myocardial counts and corresponding SD were determined on a ring-shaped ROI encompassing the endocardial and epicardial borders. Mean background counts and corresponding SD were determined on a half-moon-shaped ROI, at 15 mm from the lateral wall (Figure 2 B). Contrast-to-noise ratio was estimated using the following formula: $$ {\text{CNR}} = (M_{\text{My}} - M_{\text{BG}} )/\sqrt {{\text{SD}}_{\text{My}}^{2} + {\text{SD}}_{\text{BG}}^{2} } , $$ where M My is mean myocardial counts, M BG is mean background counts, SD My is mean myocardial SD, and SD BG is mean background SD.
TD contrast in LV wall
TD contrast in LV wall was evaluated both in LV short-axis and in horizontal long-axis images (Figure 2 C). ROIs were drawn on the central short-axis and horizontal long-axis images of the phantom acquisitions with TD defect in order to estimate \( \overline{{\eta_{\text{LV}} }} \) and \( \overline{{\eta_{\text{IC}} }} \) as the mean counts per voxel for the LV wall and TD, respectively. The TD contrast in LV wall ( C TD ) was defined as the percent difference between \( \overline{{\eta_{\text{LV}} }} \) and \( \overline{{\eta_{\text{IC}} }} \) as: $$ C_{\text{TD}} (\% ) = \frac{{\overline{{\eta_{\text{LV}} }} - \overline{{\eta_{\text{TD}} }} }}{{\overline{{\eta_{\text{LV}} }} }} \times 100 $$ The ideal C TD (%) is 100% for all central acquisitions.
Statistical Analysis
The impact of the scanner/software combinations and of the different levels of count statistics on each of the image quality indexes, was assessed by a two-way factorial ANOVA. Scanner/software combinations and the relative level of count statistics were considered as independent variables (factors) and image quality indexes as dependent variables.
A post hoc test (Scheffe F test) was performed to identify the main sources of variability. If a significant F value was found for one independent variable, then this was referred as a main effect. When a main effect was found, then a post hoc test (Scheffé test) was performed to compare the dependent variable with the levels of the factor, thus identifying the main sources of variability. Analysis was performed with Statistica version 6.0 (StatSoft Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA) using a two-sided type I error rate of P = .05. Values are reported as observed means ± standard deviations and shown as least square averages ± standard errors of the means.
Results
Phantom and Image Quality Evaluation
An example of the reconstructed image sets (best short-axis slices for TD phantom) for the two cameras and a relative level of count statistics of 100% and of 50%, is reported in Figure 3 . The detailed comparison between the statistical results for the five physical indexes used in this study to evaluate image quality in relation to scanner/software combination and relative level of count statistics are reported in Table 2 , and summarized below. Figure 3 The transaxial slices of the TD phantom acquired with the D_SPECT ( left column ), the D530c ( central column ), and D530C_AC ( right column ) for count statistics of 1.5, ( upper row ), 1 ( central row ), and 0.5 Mcounts ( lower row ), are shown. The display image zoom has been adjusted to take in account for the different pixel size
LV wall thickness
The scanner/software combination ( F = 376; P < .0001) was a main effect with a statistically significant impact on the thickness degradation of the LV wall. Post hoc test of the different scanner/software combinations showed a significant increase in FWHM values from D-SPECT to D530c (13.6 ± 0.7 vs 19.6 ± 1.3 mm; P < .0001). No significant differences were observed between D530c and D530c_AC (19.2 ± 1.1 mm; P = .99). The relative level of count statistics was not a main effect ( F = 0.4; P = .67) (Figure 4 ).

Sharpness index
The scanner/software combination ( F = 64; P < .0001) was a main effect with a statistically significant impact on the sharpness index. Post hoc test of the different scanner/software combinations showed a significant increase in sharpness values from D-SPECT to D530c (0.56 ± 0.02 vs 0.66 ± 0.04 cm −1 ; P < .0001). No significant differences were observed between D530c and D530c_AC (0.69 ± 0.01 cm −1 ; P = .13). The relative level of count statistics was not a main effect ( F = 0.5; P = .621) (Figure 5 ).

Contrast between LV wall and inner chamber
Neither the scanner/software combination ( F = 1.5; P = .25) nor the count statistics ( F = 0.55; P = 0.59) were main effects with a statistically significant impact on the LV wall/inner chamber contrast (Figure 6 ).

Contrast-to-noise ratio
The scanner/software combination was not a main effect ( F = 0.92; P = .41). The count statistics ( F = 4.4; P = .018) was a main effect with a statistically significant impact on the CNR. Post hoc count tests showed a significant increase in the CNR values from 0.5 to 1.5 Mcounts (4.2 ± 0.9 vs 5.0 ± 0.7; P = .020). No significant differences were observed in CNR between 0.5 and 1 Mcounts (4.2 ± 0.9 vs 4.5 ± 0.7; P = .19) or between 1 and 1.5 Mcounts (4.5 ± 0.7 vs 5.0 ± 0.7; P = .57) (Figure 7 ).

Discussion
In the present study, head-to head comparisons were conducted between the D-SPECT and D530c cameras, including D530c acquisitions in conjunction with an offline AC, by analyzing a number of physical figures of merit related to the quality of myocardial SPECT images, namely LV wall thickness, sharpness of the myocardial contour, contrast between the LV wall and the inner chamber, contrast-to-noise ratio and transmural defect contrast in the LV wall. This is the first study, to the best of our knowledge, investigating the behavior of these performance parameters over a wide interval of count statistics, related to clinical studies.
Different from previous studies, that used a simplified cardiac insert, in the present study the parameters were determined on an anthropomorphic torso phantom with a cardiac insert, in order to mimic the conditions of attenuation, scatter, and partial volume effects that can be encountered in clinical practice.
Wall Thickness
According to our results, the wall thickness measured on the D530c was of the same order of magnitude (20 mm) of that measured on conventional gamma cameras using OSEM reconstruction or equipped with confocal collimators with dedicated reconstruction software. Moreover, the same conventional gamma cameras equipped with software for resolution recovery and/or noise suppression demonstrated values of wall thickness (16-19 mm) even lower. Liu et al also reported thicker myocardial walls using the D530c and an anthropomorphic phantom (21-26 mm) in comparison to a conventional Anger camera (16-18 mm). The use of AC on D530c studies did not result in significant differences in wall thickness; this was an anticipated result, since AC is not expected to impact on spatial resolution. At odds with the previous data, lower values of wall thickness (13.6 mm) were documented with D-SPECT, in comparison to both D530c and conventional cameras. This is clearly visible from Figure 3 . Other authors have previously demonstrated that the central spatial resolution is slightly better with the D530c (6.7 mm) than with D-SPECT (8.6 mm). Thus, the lower LV wall thickness exhibited by D-SPECT can be explained only by the reconstruction protocol. The default algorithm D-SPECT uses is entirely based on OSEM reconstruction. An initial standard OSEM image (generally 3 iterations) is first reconstructed on which the myocardial contours are then estimated to generate a uniform model of the myocardium. This model is then used as initial guess (prior) for additional iterations (generally 4 iterations). Thus, the D-SPECT image is the optimal result reached by the OSEM iterative reconstruction using the myocardial contours as initial guess. Other manufacturers use a FBP image as initial guess for the iterative reconstructions. It is worth saying that D-SPECT is neither projecting counts, nor placing the reconstructed pixels of the myocardium into the best position. In a similar way, the “motion-frozen” approach proposed by Slomka et al, based on three-dimensional LV contours identified on the images of the individual time phases, has demonstrated to improve LV wall thickness.
Sharpness Index
The sharpness profile is a parameter influenced by spatial resolution. Imbert et al demonstrated values for the sharpness index of myocardial contours on human images using the D530c (1.02 cm −1 ) higher than those obtained with the D-SPECT (0.92 cm −1 ). Our results support this trend, showing significantly superior values for the sharpness index measured on phantom images for the D530c (0.66 cm −1 ) with respect to D-SPECT (0.56 cm −1 ) and are in quantitative agreement, as for the D530c, with the results reported by Liu et al using the same phantom. This can be accounted mainly because of the difference in voxel size used in image reconstruction, since we can expect higher degradation of the sharpness index with higher voxel size. As a matter of fact, the voxel size was 4.92 mm in D-SPECT studies and 4.0 mm in D530c studies.
Image Contrast
No statistically significant differences were found in the contrast between the myocardial wall and the LV inner cavity among the D-SPECT (81%), the D530c (84%), and the D530c_AC (85%). Noteworthy, the values of C IC (%) using CZT cameras were higher than those observed using conventional gamma cameras (46%-48%) even when the latter were equipped with software for resolution recovery (64%) and scatter corrections were also applied (73%).
A slight trend toward better values for C TD (%) for D-SPECT (59.3%) than for D530c (55.8%) can be observed, as reported in Figure 8 , although statistically not significant. Comparable values of C TD (%) (58%-60%) were previously reported using a conventional gamma camera with confocal collimators and without AC in Caobelli et al.
Contrast-to-Noise Ratio
The CNR values obtained were 4.4, 4.5, and 4.8 for the D-SPECT, D530c, and D530_AC, respectively; these values are in substantial agreement with those reported by Imbert et al for the D-SPECT (4.1) and for the D530c (4.6). However, CNR values in our study are higher than those reported by Liu et al for the D530c (~3.8).
Effect of Count Statistics
For none of the above performance parameters, the level of the count statistics resulted in a significant factor (Figures 4 , 5 , 6 , and 8 ). Hence, in the range of 50%-150% of the reference count statistic of 1 Million counts over the LV, the values of wall thickness, sharpness, C IC (%), and C TD (%) were not affected by the level of counts acquired. On one side, this suggests that increasing the count statistics above the level recommended by the manufactures and currently used in the two participating in the present study does not bring any additional benefits in terms of resolution and/or contrast. On the other side, there is still a possibility for the optimization of acquisition protocols in order to further reduce the emission scan duration and/or the injected activity of radiopharmaceutical.
The only performance parameter which seems somewhat influenced by the level of count statistics is the CNR (Figure 7 ). However, the only comparison that reached a statistical significance was that between 0.5 Mc and 1.5 Mc, while no statistical significant differences were observed moving from the reference level of count statistics down to 50% or up to 150% of the counts acquired on the LV.
New Knowledge Gained
Some differences between the D-SPECT and D530c camera performances are documented, mainly in the LV wall thickness; however, perfusion defect detection was similar using both cameras. The most important finding is that similar performances of both cameras were obtained with lower and higher acquired counts. Thus, increased tracer doses are not needed for improved image quality. Additional decrease of tracer dose or additional decrease of imaging time may be possible using CZT cameras.
Conclusions
The two analyzed SPECT systems, although based on the same detectors (semiconductor CZT detectors), are inherently different in both the geometry of data acquisition as well as in the image reconstruction algorithms.
In clinical conditions and using the reconstruction parameters currently recommended for the clinical routine, our results show that these different characteristics lead to significantly different results, mainly in the LV wall thickness. No significant differences were found in the contrast between the myocardial wall and the inner cavity or the contrast on the transmural defect.
The application of the AC to the D530c system, did not improve any of the figures of merit considered. However, these results were obtained with a phantom whose dimensions reproduce a patient with normal weight, and do not necessarily apply to overweight or obese patients.
The lack of significant differences in the considered parameters along the range of count statistics explored, combined with the increased sensitivity of these systems (fourfold for the D530c to sevenfold for the D-SPECT) in comparison to a conventional Anger camera, , seems to indicate that there is still a possibility for a further reduction in the injected activity and/or the acquisition time, in order to improve patients’ comfort and contain both patients’ and operators’ radiation exposure.
