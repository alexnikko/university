Background
Cancer is assuming a leading role in health literacy due to the increasing rates of incidence and mortality [ , , , ] and the extended social impact of this disease. Improvement of cancer literacy is a major focus of new public health policies based upon prevention education strategies that aim to reduce the burden of cancer for future generations [ ].
Regarding cancer context, prevention is a determinant topic since it is known that half of the deaths attributed to cancer can be avoided [ ] so it is vital to make people aware of risk factors and effective prevention routines. Increasing knowledge about cancer is a decisive point but does not guarantee the adoption of preventive behaviors. Action, in the way that skills are mobilized to translate knowledge, is also needed in order to raise cancer literacy [ , , ]. Comprehensive information adapted to individual educational levels is required to improve cancer knowledge [ ]. This can only be achieved with a closest collaboration between researchers and healthcare professionals refining communication tools to enhance cancer literacy [ , ].
There are several available instruments to measure cancer literacy in different aspects of the cancer spectrum; among them, some of the most commonly used are the following: the Communication and Attitudinal Self-Efficacy scale ( CASE-Cancer ), the Cancer Literacy Score ( CLS ), Cancer Message Literacy Test ( CMLT ), Cancer Awareness Measure ( CAM ), and Cancer Health Literacy Test ( CHLT ).
The CASE-Cancer—the Communication and Attitudinal Self-Efficacy scale—measures patients’ self-efficacy in the context of productive communication and positive attitude towards cancer. This tool emphasizes the communication network established between patients and healthcare providers since both patients’ attitudes and healthcare providers’ expectations influence this interaction [ ]. The CLS—the Cancer Literacy Score—was developed by European researchers and integrates an important attempt to define cancer literacy in the European context [ ]. The CMLT—Cancer Message Literacy Test—is a pair of tools that contains the CMLT-listening (CMLT-L) and the CMLT-reading (CMLT-R). These tests use messages that simulate real situations of adults’ everyday life and allow the establishment of a link between spoken/oral and written/print literacy and the influence of this link in healthcare decision-making and health behavior [ , ]. Another tool is the Cancer Awareness Measure (CAM) which evaluates the awareness of early warning signs and risk factors and barriers to seeking medical advice in which concerns to cancer [ ]. The last one is the Cancer Health Literacy Test (CHLT) with two versions conceived to measure patients’ cancer health literacy along a continuum (CHLT-30) and to identify patients with limited cancer health literacy (CHLT-6) [ ].
These tools cover a wide range of dimensions of cancer literacy, but none of them evaluates topics related to cancer prevention, especially concerning adolescents. According to Koay et al. [ ], new tools are needed and new studies are required to improve the existing tools, particularly in what concerns to cancer prevention.
In this study, we developed and validated a new instrument to assess effective knowledge and perceptions about cancer topics (including risk factors and cancer prevention), in a population of adolescents.
We focused our research on this specific population, because adolescence is a stage of transition between childhood and adulthood. This stage is an elective target since it enfolds the development of new cognitive skills, for the construction of an identity and the acquisition of psychological sense of control over live, actions, and attitudes [ , ]. As a phase of transformation and active learning, it will be easier to induce a change in attitudes and behavior towards a healthier lifestyle that should be adopted to promote the prevention of diseases such as cancer. Additionally, young people have the capacity of mutual influence, when adopting particular lifestyles and social trends.
The aim of this study was to develop and validate a tool to assess adolescents’ knowledge and perceptions about cancer that can be used in the educational context. This particular group has a great potential to develop skills and improve cancer literacy together with a dissemination potential (social networking) that might be critical to amplify the impact of future targeted educational campaigns.
Materials and Methods
The study was approved by the Portuguese Ministry of Education and Science. Enrollment in the study was voluntary, with the students having the option to decline participation. All the participants signed an informed consent to participate in the study before the application of the questionnaire. For students with ages between 12 and 17 years old, the consent was sought from their parents or tutors. Students 18 years old and older signed their own consent form.
In order to measure the students’ knowledge and perceptions about cancer, we created the “Students Knowledge and Perceptions about Cancer” (SKPaC) questionnaire (see Additional File 1 —Questionnaire “Students Knowledge and Perceptions about Cancer”), designed in Portuguese language and adapted to the Portuguese context by a multidisciplinary team, including high school teachers, cancer research specialists, a statistician, and a sociologist. The research team, using the expertise on the topic, ensured the content validity.
This instrument is structured upon cancer topics (cervical, breast, skin, and colorectal cancer, risk factors, and prevention), each one composed by a set of items.
We applied a preliminary version of the questionnaire on a group of ten students, to refine the instrument.
The final version of the questionnaire used for the pilot study, includes 35 items organized in three sections: (1) perceptions about cancer (14 items); (2) knowledge about cancer (18 items); and (3) students’ socio-biographic characterization (3 items).
Questionnaires were applied in a classroom environment using a web-based format. Data from surveys were analyzed using IBM® SPSS® Statistics, version 25. Descriptive statistics were performed to characterize the sample. Parametric (e.g., Pearson’s correlation) and non-parametric statistics (e.g., Kendall’s tau, Spearman’s rho) were used to analyze reliability and validity.
The sample used for the questionnaire validation is well balanced by gender, with 56.6% (98) girls and 43.4% (75) boys. The age ranged between 12 and 21 years old; 47.4% (82) were attending middle school (8th and 9th grade), while 52.6% (91) were attending high school (10th, 11th, and 12th grade). Detailed information is available as supplementary data (see Additional File 2 —Students’ sample characterization).
Results
Test-Retest and Internal Reliability
Internal reliability was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha. In the first application of the questionnaire ( test ), the Cronbach’s Alpha was 0.780 and in the second application ( retest ), it was 0.819, regarding 173 students that completed both applications. Regarding the different sections of the questionnaire, students’ self-perceptions had a Cronbach alpha of 0.905 for the test and 0.947 for the retest . In what concerns section 2, students’ effective knowledge about cancer, the Cronbach alpha was 0.610 in the first application ( test ) and 0.757 in the second application ( retest ). Globally, the Cronbach alpha values presented an acceptable or good internal reliability of the scale.
Construct Validity
Regarding the questionnaire items that evaluate the students’ perceived knowledge about cancer, the results showed that the Pearson correlation was significant for all the items. The items with stronger correlation between the two applications were colonoscopy, breast cancer, and mammography and the items with weaker correlation, but still significant, were colorectal cancer, cancer prevention, and UV radiation.
Students’ global perceived knowledge about cancer (arithmetic mean of the 13 items presented in Table 1 ) had a mean value of 4.60 with a standard deviation of 1.90 in the first application ( test ) and a mean value of 5.07 with a standard deviation of 2.11 in the second application ( retest ). The Pearson correlation for global perceived knowledge was 0.846 ( p < 0.01), indicating a strong positive correlation between test and retest .

In Table 2 , we present the results for the open-ended question about the meaning/definition of the word cancer. The students’ answers were grouped in different categories: (a) biomedical definition that groups the answers related to the biological aspects (technical and/or scientific) of cancer development, (b) psychosocial definition that groups the answers related to the emotional burden of cancer, (c) mixed definition that groups the answers with a merge of the two previous dimensions, (d) other definition that groups answers with other types of definitions, (e) no definite answer that groups the answers that do not express a clear definition, and (f) do not know or no answer category that groups “don’t know” answers or the absence of an answer. Table 2 What does the word cancer mean to you… ( n = 173) Cancer meaning/definition N (%) Category Test Retest Biomedical definition 58 (33.5) 60 (34.7) Psychosocial definition 69 (39.9) 58(33.5) Mixed definition 10 (5.8) 16 (9.2) Other definition 31 (17.9) 35 (20.2) No definite answer 3 (1.7) 0 (0) Do not know or no answer 2 (1.2) 4 (2.3)
Overall, the results were similar when comparing the answers from the test with the retest . Chi-square tests for the two main categories of answers (biomedical and psychosocial definitions) showed a strong dependency between the test and retest ( p < 0.001). Phi coefficient was 0.589 for the biomedical definition and 0.472 for the psychosocial definition, both statistical significant ( p < 0.001).
In Table 3 , we present phi coefficient of association for each item of students’ effective knowledge about cancer, between test and retest .

In what concerns students’ effective knowledge about cancer, chi-square tests showed strong dependency between test and retest for all the items presented in Table 3 , with p < 0.001 for the majority of the items, p = 0.0017 for item 7, and p = 0.007 for item 13.
Students’ global knowledge about cancer (arithmetic mean of the 18 items presented in Table 3 ) had a mean value of 0.49 with a standard deviation of 0.1 in the first application ( test ) and a mean value of 0.51 with a standard deviation of 0.18 in the second application ( retest ). The Pearson correlation for global knowledge is 0.722 ( p < 0.01), indicating a strong positive correlation between the test and the retest .
Face Validity
When we asked the participants about the goal of the questionnaire, the majority considered that it intended to evaluate the knowledge about cancer. The results are presented in Table 4 , according to the categories of the answers. Table 4 Goal of the questionnaire ( n = 181) Goal N (%) Category Test Retest The goal is to evaluate the knowledge about cancer 107 (59.1) 127 (70.2) The goal is to learn more or look for more information on the subject 31 (17.1) 15 (8.3) The goal is to alert, sensitize, prevent 30 (16.6) 30 (16.6) Do not know or no answer 6 (3.3) 6 (3.3) Other type of answer 7 (3.9) 3 (1.7)
Chi-square tests for the three main categories of answers (“evaluate the knowledge about cancer”, “learn more or look more information on the subject” and “alert, sensitize, prevent”) show a strong dependency between the test and the retest ( p < 0.001). Phi coefficients are 0.578, 0.552, and 0.516, respectively, all statistically significant ( p < 0.001).
We also asked the participants about “what they think that was being evaluated in this survey?” The majority wrote that the questionnaire intends to assess cancer knowledge of an individual, group, or population. In Table 5 , we present the main categories of answers. Table 5 What do you think that is being evaluated in this survey? What do you think that is being evaluated? Category N (%) Test Retest Assess cancer knowledge of an individual, population or group 108 (61.0) 106 (61.6) Assess knowledge (without specifying the theme) 35 (19.8) 29 (16.9) Assess other issues, whether or not they are cancer related 20 (11.3) 20 (11.3) Do not know or answer 14 (7.9) 17 (7.9) Total 177 (100.0) 172 (100.0)
Chi-square tests for the two main categories of answers (“assess cancer knowledge of an individual, population or group” and “assess knowledge (without specifying the theme)”) show a strong dependency between the test and the retest ( p < 0.001). Phi coefficients are 0.461 and 0.352, respectively, both statistical significant ( p < 0.001).
The clarity of the questionnaire, asked in a five-point Likert scale (from 0 = Unclear ( I had doubts in all the questions ) to 4 = Totally clear ( I had no doubt )) had a mean value of 2.46 with a standard deviation of 0.88 in the first application ( test ) and a mean value of 2.57 with a standard deviation of 0.86 in the second application ( retest ). Spearman’s rho coefficient of 0.629 indicates a strong positive correlation of questionnaire clarity between the test and the retest ( p < 0.001).
The questionnaire suitability to proper evaluate cancer knowledge, asked in a scale from 0 “Don’t allow” to 10 “Completely allow,” had a mean value of 7.31 with a standard deviation of 2.18 in the first application ( test ) and a mean value of 6.93 with a standard deviation of 2.22 in the second application ( retest ). Pearson’s correlation coefficient of 0.538 indicates a moderately strong positive correlation between the test and the retest ( p < 0.001), on questionnaire suitability to proper evaluate cancer knowledge.
Discussion
Different evaluation tools are currently available to assess distinct dimensions of the cancer literacy continuum. Still, some topics remain disregarded due to the absence of validated instruments. Cancer prevention in adolescents is clearly a subject that requires new tools to be properly studied. To address this topic, we developed a new instrument and assessed it for internal reliability, construct, and face validity.
Globally, Cronbach’s alpha values present an acceptable or good internal reliability of the scale with a total Cronbach’s alpha of 0.78 in the test and 0.819 on the retest . Test-retest reliability was also good, when analyzing perceptions (0.905 vs. 0.947) and effective knowledge (0.610 vs. 0.757) in separate.
Construct validity was measured regarding the items for self-perceptions and effective knowledge. Globally, a strong positive correlation was found between the test and retest , with all self-perception items showing a significant Pearson correlation, which is a strong indicator of reliability of the items that were used for the questionnaire.
Regarding the question about what cancer means, the results revealed a strong dependency between the test and retest answers, especially in which concerns the biomedical and psychosocial definitions.
In what concerns students’ effective knowledge about cancer, the Pearson correlation for global knowledge (0.722; p < 0.01) indicates a strong positive correlation between the test and the retest . Moreover, the phi coefficient of association and the chi-square tests showed a strong dependency between test and retest for all the items, which indicates the validity of construct.
Face validity was also measured regarding the different aspects of the questionnaire, with the majority of the respondents recognizing the objective of the instrument and considering it suitable to proper evaluate cancer knowledge. A strong dependency between the test and the retest answers with chi-square tests and the phi coefficient being statistical significant ( p < 0.001) further reinforces the validation of the questionnaire purpose.
Conclusion
The Students Knowledge and Perceptions About Cancer (SKPaC) instrument was developed to provide a validated measure of cancer knowledge, namely prevention and risk factors for different types of cancer (cervical cancer, skin cancer, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer) among the adolescent population. The field test indicated that this instrument is a valid and reliable instrument to measure adolescents’ perceptions and effective knowledge about cancer in a larger scale.
Further developments of the instrument might include other cancer types and adaptations to other cultural contexts or populations.
