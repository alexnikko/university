Introduction
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) is a leading cause of infection-related mortality in patients receiving solid organ transplantation (SOT) [ ]. The overall incidence of PCP has been reported from 0.6% to higher than 40% in SOT recipients, with higher prevalence in lung and simultaneous lung and heart transplant recipients [ , , ]. However, this rate of infection has been dramatically decreased after introduction of chemoprophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [ , ].
A range of predisposing factors for PCP has been identified. Immunosuppressive therapies and associated defective cellular immunity are among the main contributing risk factors in this era [ , , ]. Induction therapies, including anti-lymphocyte antibodies, have been considered as a potential risk factor of precipitating PCP during the first 6 months after transplantation [ , , , ], although some studies have found no correlation between induction regimens and occurrence of PCP in SOT recipients [ , , ]. Despite proposed role of corticosteroids in developing post-transplant PCP infection [ , , ], uncertainty remains over the associations between maintenance corticosteroid administration and risk of PCP infection [ , , , ].
The correlation between post-transplant PCP and other components of maintenance immunosuppressive therapy remains controversial. Some evidences have indicated increased risk of PCP in patients receiving mycophenolic acid [ , ] or calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) [ , , ] after transplantation.
There are some doubts concerning mammalian target of rapamycin (m-TOR) inhibitors as a potential cause of post-transplant PCP infection. Dominguez et al. revealed high prevalence of PCP after introduction of m-TOR inhibitors in kidney transplant recipients [ ]; however, some other investigations showed no relationship between administration of m-TOR inhibitors and risk of PCP infection in SOT recipients [ , , ].
Given that growing evidences suggest improved allograft outcomes and lower toxicity with m-TOR inhibitor administration [ ] and increased prescribing of these agents as maintenance immunosuppressive therapy after SOT, clarifying the risk of emerging PCP following introduction of m-TOR inhibitors would be of major importance.
To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis that examined the potential association between m-TOR inhibitors and the risk of developing PCP in SOT recipients.
Methods
This study was conducted according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines recommendations [ ].
Search strategy
The databases of Scopus-Embase and PubMed-Medline were systematically searched until February 2019 for relevant English articles. Keywords including MeSh and text words were used within concepts of “m-TOR inhibitor” or “pneumocystis” or “transplantation” (Supplementary Table 1 ). To cover probably missing articles, the references of the relevant review articles and the cited articles were reviewed.
Selection criteria
Two independent researchers reviewed all articles by title and abstract. Eligible studies were included if they met the following criteria: (1) studies with cohort (prospective or retrospective), case-control, or randomized clinical trial (RCT) design with any follow-up duration; (2) studies evaluating the incidence of PCP in patients who have been treated with m-TOR inhibitors after SOT in any age group; (3) those in which odds ratio (ORs) along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of PCP incidence for m-TOR inhibitor across other immunosuppressive therapies were reported or possible to be calculated.
Exclusion criteria
Articles were excluded if (1) were animal or in vitro studies, case reports, case series, ecological studies, letters, comments, short communication, or reviews; (2) reported insufficient data. In this case, the information was requested through at least three E-mails within 2 months to the corresponding author; (3) reported duplicate data. In this case, the study with higher quality and more completed information was included.
Data extraction
Full texts of eligible studies were reviewed and data were extracted by two researchers, independently. Disagreements resolved by third independent investigator. Information was extracted with following approaches: (1) general information including the name of the first author, publication’s year, country, study design, number of participants; (2) predefined criteria: gender and age of patients, type of organ transplantation, type and dose of prescribed m-TOR inhibitors, time to diagnosis of PCP, maintenance and induction immunosuppressive therapies, administration status of PCP prophylaxis; (3) key outcome: OR and 95% CIs of PCP incidence following organ transplantation in relation to m-TOR inhibitor prescriptions. If OR and 95% CIs were not reported in the article, we calculated them [ , ].
Quality of study assessment
Qualities of the included studies were evaluated independently by two authors and any contradiction was resolved through discussion. To assess the quality, the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) [ ] and Jadad scale [ ] were used for observational and RCT studies, respectively. The quality was considered as poor, fair, or high according to scales in these articles [ , ].
Data synthesis and statistical analysis
In current meta-analysis, random effect model was used to calculate the overall effect size. Cochran’s Q test and I 2 were also used to assess heterogeneity between studies. Q test was considered as significant in the case of < 0.10 [ ]. Furthermore, the subgroup analysis was conducted based on the predefined criteria. Moreover, we applied sensitivity analysis to modify dependency of overall effect size to a single study. For this purpose, data was re-analyzed by excluding the effective study. Egger test was used to assess potential publication bias and funnel plots were drawn to show visual inspection [ ]. P values were considered significant at the level of < 0.05. Statistical analyses were done using Stata, version 11.2 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX).
Results
Study selection
We found a total of 231 articles through a comprehensive search on Scopus and PubMed. After removing 22 duplicated articles from initial search, 209 ones were retrieved for title and abstract review. After excluding 178 articles, 31 ones were retrieved for full text. In this step, 22 articles were excluded due to inappropriate study design or insufficient data and intended outcome. Furthermore, six eligible articles were found by checking the references of included articles [ ] and other relevant articles [ , , , , , ]. Finally, 15 relevant articles were remained to use in this meta-analysis. Figure 1 shows the summary of our literature search. Fig. 1 Flow diagram of study selection according to PRISMA guideline

The publication year of the articles was between 1999 and 2018. Among 15 articles, 8 were conducted in Europe [ , , , , , , , ], 5 in North America [ , , , , ], 1 in South America [ ], and 1 in Asia [ ] continents. The total sample size of included articles was 37,597 individuals with the range of 31 [ ] to 32,757 [ ] patients. Both genders of male and female were participated in all studies and the range of age was wide from 13 to 68 years old. The median time from transplantation to diagnosis of PCP was from 4.73 months [ ] to 10 years [ ]. The mean duration of PCP chemoprophylaxis was between 3 [ ] and 12 [ , ] months. The qualities of nine articles were estimated as fair [ , , , , , , , , ]. Three studies were classified as having high quality [ , , ] and two others had poor quality [ , ]. In all observational studies, data had been reported based on hospital or medical records (Supplementary Table 2 ).
Among 15 studies, there were five studies with mixed kinds of organ transplantations, which data was not reported separately for each type of transplanted organ [ , , , , ]. Also, only one study investigated heart transplantation [ ]. Nine remaining studies investigated patients with kidney transplantation. In seven studies, sirolimus had been prescribed as mTOR inhibitor [ , , , , , , ] while in two studies, everolimus was used [ , ]. Three others investigated both kind of everolimus and sirolimus in their studies [ , , ]. Type of m-TOR inhibitor was not mentioned in three studies [ , , ].
Data analysis
In the current meta-analysis, only one of the included studies had presented OR and 95% CIs for the association of m-TOR inhibitor prescription with PCP incidence [ ]. We calculated crude ORs and 95% CIs for all studies based on the prevalence of PCP in groups of patients that used or not used m-TOR inhibitor (Supplementary Table 3 ).
Nine out of 15 studies reported positive association between m-TOR inhibitor exposure and the risk of PCP [ , , , , , , , , ]. However, only two reported associations were significant [ , ] and three were marginally significant [ , , ]. Combination of 15 effect sizes from 10 case-control, 2 cohort, and 3 RCT studies showed a significant positive association between m-TOR inhibitor administration and risk of PCP after organ transplantation (OR: 1.899, 95% CI: 1.440, 2.747, P < 0.001) (Fig. 2 ). Fig. 2 Forest plot for the association between risk of PCP and m-TOR inhibitor prescription using random-effects analysis
Although there was no heterogeneity between studies ( I 2 = 3.5%, Q-test = 0.413), we conducted subgroup analysis to find the effect of each following predefined criteria on pooled effect size: study design (cohort, case-control, RCT), quality of studies)poor, fair, high), type of organ transplantation (kidney, heart, and multiple), kind of m-TOR inhibitor (everolimus, sirolimus), median time to diagnosis of PCP) less or more than 12 months), kind of maintenance therapy (antimetabolite (azathioprine or mycophenolic acid) + steroid, CNI+ steroid, antimetabolite, or steroid), and prophylaxis duration (less or more than 6 months) (Table 2 ). The results showed that m-TOR inhibitor administration has a significant effect on PCP incidence in cohort studies ( P < 0.001). The results also turned up to marginally significant for case-control studies ( P = 0.061) (Fig. 2 ). PCP occurrence was associated with administration of sirolimus as m-TOR inhibitor ( P < 0.001). Renal and heart transplantation showed positive correlation with the risk of PCP occurrence ( P < 0.001 and P = 0.017). Moreover, administration of m-TOR inhibitor increased the occurrence of PCP after the first year of transplantation ( P < 0.001) (Table 2 ). It also seems that prophylaxis administration for less than 6 months is close to increased PCP incidence (marginally significant with P = 0.060). However, it seems that there is no significant correlation between m-TOR inhibitor administration and post-transplant PCP in the case of other predefined criteria of quality of study and maintenance therapy ( P > 0.05) (Table 2 ).

Due to high weight of one cohort study [ ] (weight 52.06%), we performed sensitivity analysis by excluding that study and repeating analyses. After this exclusion, the association between m-TOR inhibitor administration and risk of PCP remained significant (OR: 1.683, 95% CI: 1.054, 2.688, P = 0.029) (Fig. 3 ).

Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis that investigated the risk of PCP infection associated with administration of m-TOR inhibitors in SOT recipients.
A total of 12 observational and 3 interventional studies were included in the analysis. According to our findings, m-TOR inhibitor-based immunosuppressive therapy can be considered as one of the underlying causes of post-organ transplant PCP infection; however, significant correlation between m-TOR inhibitor exposure and the risk of post-transplant PCP infection was only detected in the case-control study of Hu et al. [ ] and the cohort study by Neff et al. [ ]. The possible underlying cause of this finding in Hu’s study [ ] might be attributed to the high target serum trough level of everolimus (8–14 mg/mL) and its related leukopenia and lymphopenia that augmented the level of immunosuppression in the patients. Moreover, over-immunosuppression owing to the history of malignancy, as one of the indications for m-TOR inhibitor therapy in this study, would be another contributory factor in high occurrence of PCP.
Regarding the study of Neff et al. [ ], the indications of m-TOR inhibitor administration were not determined although in the term of the time period of renal transplantation (2000–2004) in this study, one might expect that trough concentration of sirolimus was mostly maintained at higher level in the past in comparison with current practice [ , , ]. Indeed, sirolimus-related over-immunosuppression would be proposed as one possible justification for higher incidence of PCP in Neff et al. study. On the other hand, the prophylaxis status was not clearly defined in this study. Therefore, the lack of adequate PCP prophylaxis might be another explanation for prevalence of post-transplant PCP in that study.
According to our results, the type of m-TOR inhibitor may affect the risk of post-transplant PCP. In current meta-analysis, about 46.7% of studies were on sirolimus and showed significant association with increasing in the risk of post-transplant PCP, whereas everolimus did not reveal any significant correlation. Supporting this finding, two other studies reported that sirolimus was associated with more episodes of post-transplant infections including PCP than everolimus [ , ]. Longer half-life and higher volume of tissue distribution of sirolimus [ , ] could be a possible cause. However, this result should be interpreted with caution in our review, because six included studies evaluated both kinds of everolimus and sirolimus or did not specify the type of m-TOR inhibitor [ , , , , , ], and m-TOR inhibitors’ trough concentrations also were not reported in most of the studies that prevented evaluating the impact of immunosuppression level on this finding.
In this meta-analysis, the range of median time between transplantation and PCP diagnosis was 3.3 to 124.12 months. Administration of m-TOR inhibitor was significantly associated with increased late outbreaks of post-transplant PCP which occurred mostly after the first year of transplantation. This increased risk might occur following discontinuation of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis in most included studies. It is worth mentioning that except for the study of Hu et al., causes of m-TOR inhibitor administration were not established in the included studies. So, considering the role of m-TOR inhibitor therapy in post-transplant malignancy as one of the late complication after transplantation, higher level of immunosuppression in such cases would possibly propose the late outbreak of PCP infection in our study.
Although first 6 months after transplantation possesses the highest risk of PCP development [ , , , ], some cases of PCP outbreaks have been reported after 1 year of transplantation [ , ].
As far as the question of late-onset PCP is concerned, a recent case-control study reported the potential risk factors through multivariate analysis. These risk factors include induction therapy with thymoglobulin, high dose of CNIs (tacrolimus or cyclosporine with doses higher than 0.05 mg/kg/day or 2.1 mg/kg/day, respectively), higher doses of maintenance corticosteroid therapy (median 10 [interquartile range 5–10] vs. 7.5 [interquartile range 6–10] mg/day) or concurrent cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection [ ]. Lymphopenia, decreased glomerular filtration rate, and allograft rejection therapy are among the other considered risk factors for late-onset PCP infection [ , , ].
In agreement with recommended duration of 6 to 12 months for post-transplant PCP prophylaxis [ ], this meta-analysis indicated that prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for less than 6 months after transplantation is associated with increased post-transplant PCP incidence. Longer duration of PCP prophylaxis has been considered in some situations such as lung, heart or small bowel transplant recipients, concurrent CMV infection, prolonged duration of corticosteroid therapy (higher than 20 mg equivalent daily dose of prednisone for at least 2 weeks) or in patients with history of prior PCP infection [ , , ].
According to the present analysis, in two out of three included studies, which received more than 6 months of PCP prophylaxis (12 months), PCP has occurred after the first year of transplantation [ , ]. Even though other contributory factors might have role in this delayed cases of PCP, this finding probably indicated that prophylaxis during the first year after transplant does not prevent m-TOR inhibitor associated late-onset PCP. Also, previous investigations reported PCP cases after the first year of transplantation despite primary prophylaxis [ , ]. Therefore, targeted PCP prophylaxis based on recipients’ risk factors could be a rational approach rather than universal strategy.
In current meta-analysis, results were reported from one study on heart and nine studies on kidney transplant recipients. Moreover, five studies investigated mixed types of organ transplantation (kidney, heart, liver, pancreas, and simultaneous kidney-pancreas transplant recipients) without the possibility of separating the incidence of PCP for each type of transplanted organ. Of these, significant increase in the risk of PCP was detected in the heart or kidney transplantations. This finding could be explained by difference in the net state of immunosuppression in each type of organ transplant.
Determining the maintenance immunosuppressive regimen with the highest risk of post-transplant PCP will have clinical value. Nevertheless, the results from this review revealed no association between different types of maintenance immunosuppressive regimens and the occurrence of post-transplant PCP.
Strengths and limitations
Some limitations may have influenced the findings of this meta-analysis. Data around several confounding factors which can affect the post-transplant PCP occurrence including, precise co-immunosuppression status of included recipients (induction or maintenance immunosuppression), possible anti-rejection therapies, the reason for m-TOR inhibitor administration, status of CMV viremia or kidney function were not provided in some articles. Therefore, this discrepancy in available data prevented further analysis to evaluate other possible contributing factors. Moreover, the low quality of majority of included studies diminishes our deduction. Further cohort study with higher quality on correlation between m-TOR inhibitor administration and post-transplant PCP is needed for more comprehensive and precise conclusion.
The current meta-analysis has some strength. We conducted broad search strategy trying to examine association between m-TOR inhibitors and post-transplant PCP. In addition, we applied extensive subgroup analysis for exploring different aspects of the observed association and considering the most important variables that could affect this finding. There was no evidence of methodological heterogeneity or publication bias.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we found that administration of m-TOR inhibitor can be considered as a risk factor for post-transplant PCP infection and may be associated with increased risk of late-onset PCP after transplantation. Due to detected risk of late-onset PCP in the presence of m-TOR inhibitor, targeted PCP prophylaxis based on the other recipients’ risk factors strongly recommended. Further cohort studies with comprehensive examinations of suspected predisposing factors and long duration of follow-up are needed to increase our knowledge in adjusting considered risk factors and optimizing prophylaxis of post-transplant PCP to attenuate associated morbidity and mortality.
