Highlights
Studies evaluating oral anticoagulant management in interventional radiology are lacking We evaluated safety and efficacy of periprocedural management of oral anticoagulants Periprocedural risks of bleeding and thromboembolism appear low in this patient population Interruption strategies based on half-life and bleeding risk appear safe and efficacious The optimal management of anticoagulant therapy around specific IR procedures should be confirmed in larger clinical trials
Introduction
The oral factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors, apixaban and rivaroxaban, and vitamin K antagonists (VKA), such as warfarin, are widely used for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in atrial fibrillation (AF) and for the treatment and secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) [ , , , , ]. While abundant literature exists to guide selection and use of the anticoagulants in these patient populations, little is known about the optimal strategy for management in the periprocedural setting [ ]. Previous studies have evaluated the periprocedural management of oral anticoagulants in surgical procedures [ , , ]. Due to the lack of data in the interventional radiology (IR) setting, periprocedural management varies among institutions and current guidelines from the Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) do not incorporate recommendations for FXa inhibitors [ , ].
In order to determine if antithrombotic therapy interruption (TI) is required prior to a procedure, clinicians must assess the risk of procedural major and minor bleeding [ ]. Apart from procedural bleed risk, clinicians must consider patient factors that may increase bleeding, such as prior bleeding events within 3 months, bleeding history with a similar procedure, potential drug interactions including antiplatelet therapy, or a supratherapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) [ ]. Comorbidities that may also increase a patient’s bleed risk include decreased renal function, liver impairment, and coagulopathies. When assessing the thromboembolic risk, clinicians must consider the risk for recurrent thromboembolic events based on recent VTE, stroke, or thrombophilia [ ].
After considering the procedural bleeding and thromboembolic risks, management of anticoagulation depends upon the agent being used. For warfarin, advanced planning is required in the periprocedural setting due to its extended pharmacokinetic half-life of 36 to 42 h and pharmcodynamic effect that may exceed 100 h [ ]. Patients without risk factors for bleeding who are undergoing a low-bleeding risk procedure may consider continuation of warfarin without TI [ ]. However, interruption of warfarin is recommended in patients undergoing procedures with moderate to high bleeding risk. Management of warfarin in the periprocedural setting also requires assessment of the patient’s thromboembolic risk. Douketis et al. found that in patients with AF with intermediate risk of thromboembolism, who needed an elective procedure, discontinuation of warfarin without the use of bridging anticoagulation was noninferior to the use of bridging for the prevention of arterial thromboembolism [ ]. In patients with high thrombotic risk deemed necessary for bridging, using low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UFH) is recommended pre- and post-operatively [ ]. The timing of discontinuation pre-operatively depends upon the patient’s INR, time to the scheduled procedure and the goal INR for the procedure [ ].
Apixaban and rivaroxaban are oral FXa inhibitors with comparable efficacy and significantly lower major bleeding risk compared to warfarin in patients with AF and VTE [ , , , , ]. In contrast to warfarin, the quick onset and short half-life of the FXa inhibitors eliminate the need for bridging [ ]. However, careful consideration regarding TI is still required due to inter-patient variability in pharmacokinetic properties [ ]. The timing of discontinuation prior to procedures for apixaban and rivaroxaban is based upon the medication half-life and procedural risk of bleeding [ , ]. Given the shorter half-life, lack of need for bridging, and favorable major bleed rates with the oral FXa inhibitors compared to warfarin, we aimed to compare management strategies in these groups [ , , , , ].
While recent analyses have evaluated TI of anticoagulation in patients undergoing surgical procedures (endoscopic, orthopedic, cardiovascular), the optimal management strategy for IR procedures remains unclear [ , , ]. Data to support periprocedural management of the FXa inhibitors and warfarin in IR procedures is still lacking. Therefore, the purpose of this retrospective analysis was to assess the rates of bleeding complications and thromboembolic events surrounding periprocedural management of the FXa inhibitors or warfarin in patients that underwent IR procedures.
Methods
Study population
Adult patients on any dose of apixaban, rivaroxaban, or warfarin who underwent any IR procedure, both in the outpatient and inpatient setting, at New York University Langone Health (NYULH) between January 2015 and July 2017 were included. Low and moderate/high risk procedures were defined as per the SIR consensus guidelines [ , ]. Exclusion criteria included patients with mechanical heart valves, other anticoagulants, or pregnancy. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at NYULH.
Periprocedural anticoagulation
Periprocedural management of the FXa inhibitor or warfarin was at the discretion of the treating interventional radiologist. The antithrombotic therapy subcommittee, along with the department of IR at NYULH, developed recommendations for TI for anticoagulants in patients undergoing low or moderate/high risk IR procedures based on medication half-life, surgical literature, and SIR guidelines [ , , , , ]. In the setting of low risk procedures, no TI, defined as < 24 h from last dose of anticoagulant to procedure, is required for apixaban and rivaroxaban, and an INR < 3 is recommended for patients on warfarin. For moderate/high risk procedures, TI for 48 h, or 72 h with reduced renal function (CrCl < 30 ml/min), is recommended for apixaban and rivaroxaban, and an INR < 1.5 is recommended for patients on warfarin.
Data collection
Data collection was obtained through a retrospective medical record review of baseline demographics and past medical history, including indication for anticoagulation, VTE, AF, myocardial infarction (MI), hypertension (HTN), coronary or peripheral artery disease (CAD/PAD), heart failure, ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), anemia, diabetes mellitus (DM), coagulopathy, bleeding history, cirrhosis, renal disease, active cancer, type of procedure, and concomitant medications. Concomitant medications included antiplatelets, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antiarrhythmics, cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors and inducers, permeability glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors and inducers, and other interacting medications. A CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score was calculated for patients with a history of AF [ ]. Serum creatinine was collected and creatinine clearance (CrCl) was calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault Equation. Periprocedural characteristics, including bridging strategy, timing of anticoagulation, relevant laboratory parameters, and the use of reversal agents were also collected. Bleeding and thromboembolic events were collected from the time of last dose of anticoagulant prior to the procedure until 30 days after the procedure. The time of therapy resumption was based on IR documentation of planned time for resumption of anticoagulation. Data was managed utilizing research electronic data capture (REDCap), a secure informatics system designed to support data collection across various research disciplines [ ].
Outcomes
The primary outcome was bleeding within 30 days of the IR procedure, including major bleeding, clinically relevant non-major bleeding, and minor bleeding. Major bleeding was defined according to the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) definition for surgical and non-surgical studies [ ]. Clinically relevant non-major bleeding (CRNMB) was defined as any bleeding not meeting major bleeding criteria and requiring medical intervention by a healthcare professional, leading to hospitalization or increased level of care, or prompting a face to face evaluation [ ]. Minor bleeding included all bleeding that did not meet criteria for major bleeding or CRNMB. The secondary endpoint was the incidence of thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and ischemic stroke, within 30 days of the procedure.
Statistical analysis
Categorical variables were described as frequencies and proportions and compared using Chi square test or Fisher’s exact test. Continuous variables were described as medians with interquartile ranges (IQR) and analyzed using Mann–Whitney U test. Statistical analysis was performed by comparing FXa inhibitors versus warfarin for low risk procedures and FXa inhibitors versus warfarin for moderate/high risk procedures. A two-sided alpha of < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. A univariate analysis was performed on the primary endpoint to determine independent predictors of bleeding events. All analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 23 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).
Results
Study population
A total of 263 patients with 350 IR procedures were included in the analysis. The screening methods are illustrated in Fig. 1 . There were 174 (50%) low bleeding risk procedures and 176 (50%) moderate/high bleeding risk procedures. Out of the low risk procedures, 110 (63%) were performed on patients receiving a FXa inhibitor and 64 (37%) were performed on patients receiving warfarin. Out of the moderate/high risk procedures, 118 (67%) were performed on patients receiving a FXa inhibitor and 58 (33%) were performed on patients receiving warfarin. The median age in the cohort was 72 years (IQR 60, 82) and 55% of patients were male. The most common indication for anticoagulation was VTE, with 108 (41%) patients with a history of DVT and 58 (22%) patients with a history of PE. One-hundred sixteen (44%) patients were receiving anticoagulation for AF. More patients on warfarin were receiving anticoagulation for other indications, such as thrombophilia, left-ventricular assist device (LVAD), Watchman device, portal vein thrombosis, and pulmonary hypertension than patients on FXa inhibitors (16% vs. 3%). The most common comorbidity in the cohort was hypertension (176, 67%), followed by active cancer (109, 41%). In the low risk procedures group, there were more patients on warfarin with heart failure (28% vs. 9%, p = 0.007), lupus anticoagulant (7% vs. 0%, p = 0.044) and antiphospholipid antibody (7% vs. 0%, p = 0.044) compared to the FXa inhibitors. In the moderate/high risk procedures group, there were more patients on FXa inhibitors with active cancer (53% vs. 29%, p = 0.011) compared to warfarin. Thirty-nine percent of the population had moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCl < 60 ml/min). Twenty-six percent of patients were on concomitant antiplatelet therapy at baseline, including aspirin or clopidogrel, with 4 patients (1.5%) on dual antiplatelet therapy. Further characteristics can be found in Table 1 .

Procedures
Overall, 218 (62%) procedures were performed in the outpatient setting, 128 (37%) were non-emergent inpatient procedures and 4 (1%) were emergent inpatient procedures. Out of the low risk procedures, 139 (80%) were outpatient and 35 (20%) were non-emergent inpatient. Of the moderate/high risk procedures, 79 (45%) were outpatient, 93 (53%) were non-emergent inpatient, and 4 (2%) were emergent inpatient. Details of the procedure types can be found in the supplemental material (Online resource 1).
Therapy interruption
For low risk procedures, the median time from the last dose of anticoagulant to the procedure was 17.5 h (IQR 12, 28) for all FXa inhibitors, 12.3 h (IQR 4, 29) for apixaban and 18.5 h (IQR 16, 22) for rivaroxaban (Table 2 ). For patients on warfarin undergoing a low risk procedure, the median INR prior to the procedure was 1.75 (IQR 1.3, 2.2), with only one patient having an INR greater than 3. Two (2%) patients in the FXa inhibitors group and 5 (8%) patients in the warfarin group were bridged with either LMWH or UFH infusion prior to the low risk procedure (p = 0.102).

Fifteen patients had INR drawn greater than 14 days prior to the procedure
For moderate/high risk procedures in patients with CrCl ≥ 30 ml/min, the median time from the last dose of anticoagulant to the procedure was 42 h (IQR 30, 68) for all FXa inhibitors, 39 h (IQR 23, 72) for apixaban and 48 h (IQR 40, 69) for rivaroxaban. For moderate/high risk procedures in patients with CrCl < 30 ml/min, the median time from the last dose of anticoagulant to the procedure was 41 h (IQR 32, 143) for all FXa inhibitors, 41 h (IQR 32, 126) for apixaban and 127 h (IQR 119, 135) for rivaroxaban. For patients on warfarin undergoing a moderate/high risk procedure, the median INR prior to the procedure was 1.3 (IQR 1.1, 1.5), with 14 patients having an INR over 1.5. Twenty-five (21%) patients in the FXa inhibitors group and 18 (31%) patients in the warfarin group were bridged with either LMWH, UFH infusion or UFH subcutaneous prophylaxis prior to the moderate/high risk procedure (p = 0.153).
After a low risk procedure, 147 (89%) patients resumed anticoagulation within 24 h, 14 (8%) between 24 and 48 h, and 4 (2%) over 72 h post-procedure. No patients in the FXa inhibitor group and 9 (14%) patients in the warfarin group were bridged with LMWH or UFH infusion after the low risk procedure (p < 0.001). After a moderate/high risk procedure, 93 (60%) patients resumed anticoagulation within 24 h, 41 (26%) between 24 and 48 h, 10 (6%) between 48 and 72 h, and 12 (8%) over 72 h post-procedure. Sixteen (14%) patients in the FXa inhibitors group and 25 (43%) patients in the warfarin group were bridged with either LMWH, UFH infusion or UFH subcutaneous prophylaxis after the moderate/high risk procedure (p < 0.001).
Bleeding
There were a total of 3 (0.9%) major, 12 (3%) clinically relevant non-major, and 5 (1%) minor bleeding events (Table 3 ). All major bleeding events were non-procedural. The median time to any bleeding event was 7.8 days (IQR 1, 24) after the procedure. The first major bleed was a lower GI bleed occurring in a 90-year-old male 22 days after a percutaneous kyphoplasty, for which warfarin was held until the INR was < 2 and restarted within 24 h after the procedure. At the time of the bleed, the patient’s INR was 2.1 with acute blood loss anemia. The second major bleed was a fatal subdural and intraventricular hemorrhage in a 79-year-old male that occurred 3 days after an inpatient lumbar puncture, for which apixaban was held for 4 days and the patient was bridged with an UFH infusion prior to and post-procedure for AF with a CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score of 5. At the time of the bleed, 2.5 days after the procedure, the patient was receiving therapeutic anticoagulation with an UFH infusion. The final major bleed was a spontaneous subdural hemorrhage in a 66-year-old male that occurred 12 days after an inpatient lumbar puncture, for which rivaroxaban was held for 10 days and not restarted post-procedure secondary to thrombocytopenia. A univariate analysis highlighted risk factors associated with any bleeding event (Online resource 1).

Thromboembolic events
There were a total of 4 (1%) thromboembolic events in the cohort, with three in the FXa inhibitor group, and one in the warfarin group. All events occurred in patients undergoing moderate/high risk procedures. The median time to a thromboembolic event was 3.2 (IQR 0.1, 6.5) days after the procedure. The thromboembolic event in the warfarin group was a TIA that occurred 7 days after a procedure in a patient with a CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score of 5, at which time the patient was on warfarin with a therapeutic INR of 2.1. Two of the three thromboembolic events in the FXa inhibitor group were in patients with a TI from apixaban, without bridging. The first was an incidental finding of DVT in a patient admitted for an unrelated condition. The second was in a patient who had a TI of 7 days from apixaban and presented with a symptomatic DVT upon presentation to a scheduled IR procedure. The final thromboembolic event was a subsequent stroke despite no TI of apixaban in a patient admitted for a neuro IR procedure for a prior stroke.
Discussion
We observed a low bleeding and thromboembolic rate with our IR guideline-based anticoagulant periprocedural management strategy. Although the procedures performed by interventional radiologists utilize image guidance and minimally invasive techniques, direct organ or vascular injury resulting in bleeding can still occur. Guidance on anticoagulant management in the IR periprocedural setting remains limited. With the increasing use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), including the oral FXa inhibitors, brief TI may be necessary to minimize the risk of bleeding. Current expert consensus on periprocedural management of anticoagulation in AF recommends interruption of the oral anticoagulant based upon the procedural bleed risk and the patient’s renal function [ ]. While periprocedural management of anticoagulants has been evaluated for surgical procedures, there are no studies published to date in the IR setting [ , , ].
Another approach that may be considered for the management of the DOACs includes assessment of pre-procedural drug concentrations. Godier, et al. evaluated TI of the DOACs in patients with AF in the periprocedural period by assessing the days necessary to achieve a pre-procedural DOAC concentration ≤ 30 ng/mL [ ]. This cohort included patients on rivaroxaban (55%), dabigatran (31%), and apixaban (14%), and included 14% with a CrCl < 50 ml/min. The study found that discontinuation of a DOAC 49 to 72 h prior to a procedure resulted in 95% patients having a DOAC concentration ≤ 30 ng/ml, the level at which has been used as the safety threshold for high-bleeding risk procedures [ ]. Antiarrhythmic treatment, pre-procedural bridging, and a CrCl < 50 ml/min were negatively associated with DOAC concentrations ≤ 30 ng/ml [ ]. This analysis suggests that patients with moderate renal impairment or on an antiarrhythmic should be considered for a longer duration of TI in the periprocedural period. In contrast, we found that moderate or severe renal impairment did not necessitate a longer duration of TI compared to patients with CrCl > 30 ml/min (41 vs. 42 h), respectively. However, there was a longer TI observed in 2 patients in the rivaroxaban group with a CrCl < 30 ml/min. Renal impairment and use of antiarrhythmic agents were not associated with an increased risk of bleeding upon univariate analysis.
In fact, our study population included patients with moderate (67, 25%) and severe (36, 14%) renal impairment and evaluated periprocedural management in patients with varying levels of thromboembolic risk. Prior studies have evaluated periprocedural management of DOACs in subgroups of larger trials or retrospective reviews [ , , ]. Garcia, et al. described TI and resumption of apixaban as compared with warfarin in a subgroup of patients with AF from the ARISTOTLE trial undergoing surgical procedures [ , ]. Interruption patterns ranged from no TI to discontinuation of apixaban or warfarin up to 7 days prior to the procedure. Wide variations in the duration of TI, an AF-only population, and the majority of patients with a CrCl > 50 ml/min, limits the generalizability of these conclusions. A recently published retrospective analysis described the thrombotic and bleeding outcomes of periprocedural management of the DOACs in patients with VTE that were undergoing planned, non-urgent surgical procedures [ ]. However, the most frequent DOAC used in the study was rivaroxaban (90%), with the majority of patients having a CrCl > 60 ml/min, limiting generalizability to other DOACs and varying levels of renal function.
Ensuring safety of temporary TI in the periprocedural setting is vital as approximately 10% of all patients treated with antithrombotic medications and 25% of patients treated with DOACs may require surgical or other invasive procedures each year [ , ]. However, the decision to hold anticoagulation therapy involves balancing the risk of post-procedural bleeding with the patient’s thrombotic risk. Current SIR consensus guidelines recommend holding warfarin until the INR is ≤ 2 for low bleeding risk procedures and until the INR is ≤ 1.5 for moderate/high bleeding risk procedures [ , ]. In our study, the median INR prior to a low risk procedure was 1.75 and prior to a moderate/high risk procedure was 1.3, in line with current SIR recommendations. While the current SIR consensus guidelines do not incorporate recommendations for periprocedural management of the FXa inhibitors, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) recommends TI for at least 24 h prior to a low bleeding risk procedure and for at least 48 h prior to a moderate/high bleeding risk procedure [ , , ]. The duration of TI is recommended to be extended in patients with CrCl < 30 ml/min [ ]. In our analysis, the median time between last dose of anticoagulant and the procedure, for the FXa inhibitors was 18 and 42 h prior to a low risk and moderate/high risk procedure, respectively. For patients with a CrCl < 30 ml/min, the median time between last dose of anticoagulant and the procedure was 41 h for apixaban (n = 11) and 127 h for rivaroxaban (n = 2). These results, along with our low incidence of bleeding and thromboembolic events, suggest that minimal TI, defined as < 24 h from the last dose for FXa inhibitors may suffice for patients undergoing IR procedures with a low risk of bleeding [ ]. For patients undergoing moderate/high bleeding risk procedures, a TI of 48 h seems reasonable given our findings and the low incidence of adverse events.
We found an overall major bleeding rate of 0.9% and a CRNMB rate of 3% within 30 days after the IR procedure. Only one major bleeding event was considered to be related to periprocedural management and occurred in a patient with bridging post-procedure. Similarly, Garcia et al. found low rates of major bleeding, with 1.62% in the apixaban arm and 1.93% in the warfarin arm. Shaw et al. also found low rates of major bleeding and CRNMB with rivaroxaban of 0.53% and 3.16%, respectively [ ]. In our study, risk factors associated with overall bleeding included male gender, history of vascular or arterial disease, history of MI, DM, concomitant baseline antiplatelet use, undergoing a non-emergent inpatient procedure, and undergoing a moderate/high risk procedure. In addition, the use of phytonadione and four-factor prothrombin complex concentrates (4F-PCC) prior to the procedure was identified as a risk factor for bleeding on univariate analysis. However, these measures were likely taken in higher acuity patients at a perceived higher risk for bleeding. Although antiplatelet agents may be held for IR procedures, we did not collect the time of TI for these agents, so we cannot say with certainty that the bleeding resulted from concomitant antiplatelet therapy. Outpatient procedures, low risk procedures, those with TI of less than 24 h, and restarting anticoagulation within 24 h after the procedure were associated with less bleeding.
Notably, the occurrence of thromboembolic events was low in our study, with an overall event rate of 1%. These results are consistent with previous studies of DOAC management in the periprocedural setting, which found overall thromboembolic event rates of 0.35–1.05% [ , ]. The risk of VTE is 4–7 times greater in patients with active cancer as compared to the general population [ ]. As more literature is available for the use of DOACs as alternatives to warfarin or LMWH in patients with cancer, evaluation of the safety of TI in this population is critical [ ]. In comparison to Shaw et al., whose population included only 14 (7.4%) patients with active cancer, 109 (41%) patients in our cohort had active cancer. Significantly more patients on FXa inhibitors (57, 53%) had active cancer compared to warfarin (15, 29%) in the moderate/high risk procedures group [ ]. This, combined with our low incidence of thromboembolic events, suggests that brief TI of oral FXa inhibitors in patients with cancer needing IR procedures may be safe.
Our study included more patients on FXa inhibitors (172, 65%) than warfarin (91, 35%), suggesting the paradigm shift in oral anticoagulant preferences. For low risk IR procedures, both the FXa inhibitor and warfarin groups had minimal TI, similar rates of bridging pre-procedure, low rates of bleeding, and no thromboembolic events. For moderate/high risk IR procedures, although warfarin was held for a longer period of time, there were similar rates of bridging pre-procedure, bleeding within 30 days and thromboembolic events within 30 days of the procedure compared to the FXa inhibitor group. We did observe more post-procedure bridging in patients on warfarin in both the low risk and moderate/high risk groups. The lack of post-procedure bridging in the FXa inhibitor group suggests that periprocedural management may be easier for these agents than warfarin.
Our study is limited by its retrospective nature and modest sample size with a heterogeneous population. Furthermore, although oral anticoagulant management prior to the procedure was predefined, the decision to deviate and/or use bridge therapy was up to the interventional radiologist. Additionally, although the NYULH recommendation for TI of warfarin in low risk procedures is to proceed as long as the INR is < 3, the median INR was subtherapeutic at 1.75. This calls into question the management of warfarin in this population, and the applicability of our results to a population with a therapeutic INR. Our data is further limited by the overall low utilization of dabigatran identified during screening. Finally, although our population included a significant portion of patients on FXa inhibitors with severe renal impairment, the majority of these patients were on apixaban, limiting generalizability to other FXa inhibitors.
Our analysis supports previously published surgical literature that some patients on anticoagulation with FXa inhibitors can undergo low-risk procedures without TI, specifically in the IR setting [ , ]. The low incidence of bleeding and thromboembolic events suggests that TI in moderate/high bleeding risk IR procedures is preliminarily safe and effective when based on medication half-life and the patient’s renal function. Our data supports the current SIR consensus guidelines for holding warfarin until the INR is ≤ 2 for low bleeding risk procedures and until the INR is ≤ 1.5 for moderate/high bleeding risk procedures. While the current SIR consensus guidelines do not incorporate recommendations for periprocedural management of the FXa inhibitors, our analysis represents one of the largest to date in this particular area. Larger prospective studies are needed to confirm the optimal duration of TI in the IR setting.
