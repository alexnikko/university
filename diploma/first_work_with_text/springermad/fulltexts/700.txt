Introduction
In the current clinical practice, only few medications, such as statins and aspirin, can effectively reduce the major cardiovascular events (MACE) consequent to atherosclerosis. However, only 30–40 % of the patients consistently gain benefits from those treatments [ , ]. In this setting, the search for new non-invasive strategies that can protect subjects with high cardiovascular risk is mandatory.
The importance of the inflammatory process that coincides with the lipid deposition in the vessels has been increasingly perceived for more than 30 years [ ]. Intensive research has been unraveling the various aspects of the participation of immune cell types, such as macrophages, T and B lymphocytes, dendritic cells and neutrophils, and the discovery of immune cell subtypes with pro or anti-atherosclerosis actions [ , ] and produced a much detailed and insightful view of inflammation in atherosclerosis. Nonetheless, to date, medications with specific anti-inflammatory action have not yet been introduced in the cardiovascular therapy. Some are currently investigated in clinical trials, such as leukotriene inhibitors, and canakinumab, a monoclonal antibody that neutralizes the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1beta [ , , ] or low-dose metothrexate [ ]. A phospholipase A2 inhibitor (Darapladib) was shown to have no effect on the risk cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction or stroke when administered to patients with stable coronary artery disease [ ]. A key feature of atherosclerosis development that has not been specifically targeted is the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells that migrate from the arterial media layer into the intima.
The powerful anti-proliferative weaponry of anti-cancer chemotherapy can offer opportunities to acquire novel anti-atherosclerotic treatments. Aarnoudse et al. [ ] have shown that the chemotherapeutic agent etoposide, known to induce monocytopenia, could inhibit plaque formation in rabbits. To investigate the role of monocytes in the atheroma formation, de la Llera-Moya et al. [ ] also treated cholesterol-fed rabbits with high-dose etoposide. The treatment resulted in a decrease of plaque size, with less intimal accumulation of fibrous tissue and of foam cells [ ]. Those effects were obtained with high toxicity to the animals, as expected, and these undesirable effects preclude testing those anti-cancer agents in patients with cardiovascular disease.
The toxicity of anti-cancer drugs can however be reduced and the pharmacological action be improved by their association to an efficient drug-targeting system [ ]. To the best of our knowledge, our laboratory was the first to demonstrate that solid, non-liposomal, artificially made nanoparticles can target neoplastic cells and tissues [ , ]. The nanoparticles were termed LDE and are made to resemble the lipid structure of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and do not contain protein. Injected into the bloodstream, they acquire several apolipoproteins (apo) and through apo E the nanoparticles bind to the LDL receptors and are internalized together with drugs associated to the particle structure into the cytoplasm by the LDL receptor-mediated endocytic pathway [ ]. Because, LDL receptors are up-regulated in neoplastic cells [ ] and other tissues with diseases with high cell proliferation rates, such as chronic inflammatory processes, it is possible to concentrate lipophilic drugs attached to the nanoparticles in those sites. Indeed, the association to LDE pronouncedly reduced the strong toxicities of the anti-cancer drugs, as shown in experimental animals [ , , ] and in patients with advanced solid and hematologic cancers [ , , , ].
Because LDE was shown to concentrate not only in neoplastic tissues but also in atherosclerotic lesions and has the ability of reducing the toxicity of the chemotherapeutic agents, our laboratory has also been testing preparations of LDE-drugs in rabbits with atherosclerosis induced by cholesterol feeding. In fact, in those rabbits, reductions of atherosclerotic lesions above 60 % were attained with LDE formulations of paclitaxel, etoposide and methotrexate administered intravenously [ , , ]. Those promising results indicate that anti-blastic drugs should be more extensively explored with the aim to achieve more efficient treatments for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The disease is multifactorial and may distinctly respond to the compounds pertaining to different classes of anti-proliferative chemotherapeutic agents in current clinical use.
Previously, we have developed a stable formulation of carmustine associated to LDE [ , ]. Carmustine, a nitrosourea also called BCNU for bischloroethyl-nitrosourea, is a highly lipophilic compound [ ], thus prone to association to LDE without modification of its chemical structure. The toxicity of carmustine is high but was drastically diminished by the association with LDE, as shown in experimental animals and in clinical trials enrolling cancer patients [ , ].
In this study, the anti-atherosclerotic action of LDE-carmustine was tested in the model of cholesterol-fed rabbits. We hypothesized that, in case of relevant anti-atherosclerotic effects, the good tolerability and safety offered by the LDE drug targeting system could allow the use of the new preparation in clinical studies.
Material and Methods
Animals and Experimental Protocol
Male New Zealand White rabbits weighing 3.4 ± 0.3 Kg (mean ± SD) were housed in individual cages in a temperature controlled room (20–22 °C) and on a 12 h light/dark cycle during the experimental period. Twenty-seven animals were fed a diet consisting of regular feed with added 1 % cholesterol ( w /w) for 60 days. The amount of feed was restricted to 150 g. On day 30, animals were separated into three groups. Nine animals were treated with four weekly intravenous injections of LDE-carmustine (4 mg/kg and 30 mg of total lipids), nine received four weekly intravenous saline solution in equivalent volume (saline control), and nine were treated weekly with intravenous LDE alone (LDE-alone control) in equivalent volume, without incorporation the drug, with the aim to evaluate whether the nanoemulsion itself could produce any effects on the measured parameters. The chow consumption was assessed daily, and body weight was assessed weekly. One week after the last dose of the treatment, euthanasia was performed by a lethal intravenous dose of 80 mg/kg of sodium pentobarbital. The study was performed in accordance with Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (U.S. National Institutes of Health) and was approved by the Ethics Committee of University of São Paulo. All efforts were made to maximize animal welfare and minimize suffering.
Serum Biochemistry Profile and Blood Cell Counting
Blood samples were taken from the marginal ear vein after 12-h overnight fasting for determination of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, gamma glutamyltranspeptidase, total bilirubin, and urea levels by equipment Cobas c111 (Roche Diagnostics, commercial kits for Cobas c111) and for blood cell count.
Preparation of LDE and Association of Carmustine to LDE
LDE was prepared according to the method described by Maranhão et al. [ ]. A lipid mixture of 40 mg egg phosphatidylcholine (Lipoid GmbH, Ludwigshafen, Germany), 20 mg cholesteryl oleate (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mg Miglyol® 812 N (Sasol Ltd., Johannesburg, South Africa), and 0.5 mg cholesterol (Sigma-Aldrich) was emulsified in aqueous medium by prolonged ultrasonic irradiation for 3 h. A two-step ultracentrifugation (195,000×g for 30 min followed by 195,000×g for 120 min in a TH 641 [Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA] rotor at 4 °C) of the crude emulsion with density adjustment by addition of solid KBr was done to obtain the nanoemulsion. LDE was dialyzed overnight against 2 L of 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 8.0 for KBr extraction, and sterilized by passing through a 0.22 μm filter.
Carmustine was associated with nanoparticles in the ratio 3:1 by weight lipid:drug. The association of carmustine to LDE was performed using vortex. The resultant mixture was centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 15 min to precipitate carmustine that eventually did not associate to LDE. The preparations LDE-carmustine were made in the same day of the experiment and sterilized by passing through a 0.22 μm filter and kept at 4 °C. The amount of drug associated to the nanoparticle was always measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (model LC-10 AD; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) before injection. The yield of association was 90 % and the particle diameter, measured by laser light scattering using a Zetasizer Nano ZS90 (Malvern, Worcestershire, UK), was about 60 nm. Prepared as described, the resulting nanoparticles consisted of 47 % phosphatidylcholine, 27.8 % cholesteryl oleate, 0.7 % cholesterol, 1.5 % Miglyol®, and 23 % carmustine.
Analysis of Lesion Areas
The aorta was excised from the aortic arch to the abdominal artery, opened longitudinally, washed with saline, and placed in 10 % buffered formalin. After fixation, the aorta was stained in Scarlet R, and pictures were taken to measure the lesions. The aortic arch was sectioned in 5 mm segments and embedded in paraffin. Sections taken for each segment were stained in hematoxylin-eosin for total area measurement and picrosirius for collagen analyses. Additional sections were stained with anti-rabbit macrophage clone RAM11 (Dako, Carpinteria, CA), for macrophages; anti-human muscle α actin (Dako), for vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC); anti-human forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) antibody (ABCam, Cambridge, MA), for regulatory T lymphocytes; anti-human cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3) antibody (ABCam), for CD3+ T lymphocytes; anti-rabbit matrix metallopeptidase 9 (ABCam), for MMP9; anti-interleukin 1β (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), for IL-1β; anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (R&D Systems), for TNF-α; anti-low density lipoprotein receptor (Lifespan, Seattle, WA), for LDL-receptor; anti-low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany), for LRP-1; anti-scavenger receptor class B member 1 (Millipore, Billerica, MA), for SR-B1; and anti-proliferating cell nuclear antigen (Dako), for PCNA.
Photomicrographs were captured using a Nikon 80i microscope (Tokyo, Japan) coupled with a digital camera and analysed with NIS-Elements 3.2 AR image analysis software (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). The mean percentage of the stained area on all measured fields for each group was calculated. For quantitative image analysis of immunostaining for macrophages, VSMC, FOXP3, CD3, MMP9, IL-1β, TNF-α, LDL-receptor, LRP-1, and SR-B1, the color detection threshold was chosen for the DAB chromogen in tissue sections. The settings for chromogen staining were optimized so that all cells that were identified as labeled above background by visual inspection were also scored by the image analysis software. The PCNA immunostaining was expressed by the positive nucleus/mm 2 .
Statistical Analysis
Values were expressed as mean ± SD. Comparison between groups of lipid, biochemistry, hematological profiles, macroscopic and microscopic morphometry, chow consumption and body weight was assessed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey's post hoc test. Student’s t-test was used to test differences in immunohistochemical analysis. Two-tailed P -values below 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Results
Toxicity Data
The introduction of the high cholesterol diet did not change evolution of body weight or the chow consumption of the rabbits (Fig. 1 ). Blood count of both red and white series, and the parameters related with renal and hepatic function were also not affected by cholesterol feeding (Table 1 ). The treatment with LDE-carmustine did not result in significant toxicities, as shown by the data on chow consumption and weight evolution (Fig. 1 ), blood cell counts (Fig. 2 ), alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, gamaglutamyl transpeptidase, total bilirubin and urea values, that were equal in LDE-carmustine and saline-treated groups (Table 1 ).

Serum Lipids
As expected, Table 1 shows that cholesterol feeding pronouncedly increased the values of total and non-HDL cholesterol and triglycerides in the three groups from baseline to the 4th week, but henceforth to the 8th week no further increase took place. In contrast, HDL-cholesterol was not changed by cholesterol feeding. We found that the LDE-carmustine treatment did not alter the serum lipids.
Atherosclerotic Lesions
Figure 3 shows images of aortas from rabbits treated with LDE-carmustine, LDE-alone control, and from saline control. It is apparent that LDE-carmustine pronouncedly diminished the red stains that correspond to the ateromas. Indeed, the macroscopic morphometry data (Table 2 ) show that the aortas of the LDE-carmustine rabbits had 90 % less lesion areas as compared to the saline control ( p < 0.001) and 89 % compared to the LDE-alone control ( p < 0.001).

Figure 4 shows photomicrographs of slices of the aortic arch tissue stained with hematoxylin-eosin and intima/media area ratios measured in the three groups of animals. The saline and the LDE-alone control groups had similar areas of total artery, intima and media layer, as well as the intima/media ratio. The microscopic morphometry of the aortic arch slices (Table 3 ) showed that LDE-carmustine elicited a pronounced reduction of the intima area ( p < 0.001); the intima-media ratio was reduced eighteen-fold in the LDE-carmustine treated animals compared with the saline control ( p < 0.001) and seventeen-fold compared to the LDE-alone control ( p < 0.001). LDE-carmustine treatment did not change the area of the media layer. Fig. 5 shows that the collagen positive area was not different in LDE-carmustine treated and control animals (52 ± 8 vs 51 ± 9, p = 0.81).

Figures 6 - 8 show the photomicrographs of slices of aortic arch tissue stained for different proteins, and the percentages of stained areas of each one of the antibody labels calculated by a computer assisted morphometry technique. Figure 6 shows the percentages of stained areas to macrophages, VSMC, FOXP3, CD3 and PCNA. LDE-carmustine treatment reduced the macrophage presence by 77 % (61 ± 9 % of stained area in control and 14 ± 9 % in LDE-carmustine treated rabbits, p < 0.001). In contrast, CD3+ T lymphocytes presence was equal in LDE-carmustine (8 ± 9 %) and control animals (11 ± 6 %). The percentage of stained area of FOXP3 was reduced by 75 % (38 ± 22 % in the control group and 10 ± 12 % in the LDE-carmustine group, p < 0.01). VSMC was reduced by 64 % (20 ± 10 % in the control group and 7 ± 7 % in the LDE-carmustine group, p < 0.01). PCNA positive nuclei were equal in LDE-carmustine treated and control animals (0.044 ± 0.025 vs 0.033 ± 0.014, p = 0.38, Fig. 6 ).

In Fig. 8 , LDE-carmustine treatment also reduced the LDL-receptor staining by 88 % (44 ± 12 % in the control group and 5 ± 8 % in the LDE-carmustine group, p < 0.001) and of the LRP-1 receptor by 52 % (45 ± 21 % in the control group and 22 ± 19 % in the LDE-carmustine group, p < 0.05). In respect to the scavenger receptor stained area, LDE-carmustine reduced SR-B1 by 72 % (43 ± 22 % in the control group and 12 ± 12 % in the LDE-carmustine group, p < 0.01, Fig. 8 ). Fig. 8 Representative photomicrographs and semi quantitative scoring of immunohistochemical stainings for LDL-receptor (low-density lipoprotein receptor), LRP-1 (low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1) and SR-B1 (scavenger receptor class B member 1) in artery tissues from rabbits treated with Saline control or LDE-carmustine, n = 9 each group.

In all measured parameters, either the toxicity-related ones, such as the blood counts, function parameters, or those related to the anti-atherosclerotic effects, such as the macro and microscopic morphometry, there were no differences between saline-treated and LDE-alone-treated groups of animals.
Discussion
In previous studies [ , , ], we have shown that compounds belonging to classes of chemotherapeutic agents with different mechanisms of action, such as paclitaxel, a microtubule inhibitor, methotrexate, a folate antagonist and etoposide, a topoisomerase II inhibitor, all associated with LDE, had the ability to strongly reduce the atherosclerotic lesions induced in rabbits [ , , ]. In this study, it was shown that treatment with carmustine, that belongs to the group of covalent DNA-binding drugs also exhibits pronounced anti-atherosclerotic action.
The primary cytotoxic effects of carmustine result from alkylation at the O6 position of guanine in DNA, and the subsequent conversion of these monoadducts into DNA interstrand cross-links between the N1-position of guanine in one strand and the N3 position of cytosine in the opposite strand of DNA [ ]. Differently from etoposide, paclitaxel or methotrexate, that had to be derivatized by addition of an oleyl radical to improve the yield of the association to LDE and the stability of the formulation, carmustine can be satisfactorily and stably associated to LDE as the intact, non-derivatized compound [ , ]. In regards to etoposide, paclitaxel or methotrexate the pro-drug form is reverted to the pharmacologically active form by cytoplasmatic esterases, after the uptake by the cell of the LDE-drug nanoparticles.
It is remarkable that the treatment with LDE-carmustine reduced the area of the lesions by 90 % and by 89 %, as compared with the saline control and LDE-alone control, respectively. The effect of this preparation in reducing the lesions was similar to that obtained with LDE-etoposide [ ], estimated as 85 %, and perhaps superior to those of LDE-paclitaxel (60 %) [ ] and of LDE-methotrexate (65 %) [ ]. However, although the experimental conditions and protocols were similar for the studies with the three previous LDE-drug preparations and the current LDE-carmustine, it is worthwhile to point out that the studies were performed at different times and some experimental variations might have occurred from one to the other, so that comparative data should be carefully interpreted.
The strong reduction of the atheromata, of the intima/media ratio and of the overall lesion area of the aortas by LDE-carmustine can be ascribed to the marked inhibition of the macrophage invasion of the intima and to the reduction of the intimal proliferation of VSMC by the novel anti-atherosclerotic treatment approach. In this regard, these effects on macrophages and VSMC do not substantially differ from those observed after the treatment of atherosclerotic rabbits with the other three studied LDE-drug preparations [ , , ]. Post-treatment reduction of macrophages could have occurred by either reduction of recruitment and adhesion of these cells or by apoptosis [ , ].
Interestingly, the LDE-carmustine treatment did not decrease the presence of pro-inflammatory T cells in the intima, as indicated by CD3, the membrane-bound antigen that specifically labels mature T cells [ , ]. Regulatory T cells, that generally have anti-inflammatory functions [ ], were unexpectedly decreased, as indicated by the decrease of the presence of transcription factor FOXP3. Interestingly, PCNA staining did not confirm that the LDE-carmustine treatment inhibited cell proliferation in the plaques.
The LDE-carmustine treatment consistently reduced the pro-inflammatory factors IL-1β and TNF-α, products of inflammatory cells that are hallmarks of inflammation in atherosclerosis [ ]. Thus, the decrease in those factors, that can be attributed to either inhibition of secretion by inflammatory cells or to the reduction in the intima of the inflammatory cells that secrete those factors, are certainly important determinants of the anti-atherosclerotic effects of the treatment.
The decrease of MMP9 may have important consequences in terms of complications of the atheromatous plaques, since this enzyme is involved in the digestion of the plaque cap, which results in cap rupture and the local hemorrhage that originates thromboembolic episodes, such as acute myocardial infarction, that often lead to death [ ]. By picrosirius staining, the LDE-carmustine did not change the collagen content of the lesions; the significance of this outcome for the understanding of the lesion status is unclear.
Another interesting aspect was the down-regulation of the protein expression in the intima of the lipoprotein receptors, LDL-receptor, LRP-1 and SR-B1. The reduction of the receptors is conceivably related with the reduction of the cell types invading the intima, specially macrophages and VSMC. SR-B1 are typically macrophage receptors that take-up oxidized LDL, which is the best known mechanism involved in the cholesterol deposition in the arterial intima [ ]. The reduction of the presence of LDL receptors in the lesions after the LDE-carmustine treatment period is thus consequent to the success of the treatment to promote lesion regression. The subsequent internalization of LDE-carmustine into cells per vessel segment is conceivably diminished but this would not be deleterious to treatment since at this point the vessel lesion is mostly resolved.
The lack of the toxicities intrinsic to the treatment with the carmustine preparations was clearly documented here by the evolution of food consumption and weight of the animals during the treatment period, as well as the lack of hematological, hepatic and renal toxicities indicated by the blood counts and serum biochemistry parameters. However, this outcome was only confirmatory for the rabbit model used in this study: the remarkable toxicity reduction of carmustine by the association has been documented not only in experimental animals but also in patients with advanced, drug-resistant cancers [ , ].
Taken together with our previous studies on the treatment of rabbit atherosclerosis, the current study confirms the notion that anti-cancer drugs with different anti-proliferative pharmacological actions have the ability to strongly diminish the lesions.
Previously, we have shown in in vitro experiments that radioactively labeled carmustine associated to LDE was taken up by cultured neoplastic cell lines such as muco epidermoid lung carcinoma cells NCI-H-292 and that carmustine cytotoxicity was not attenuated by the association to LDE [ ]. The uptake of the preparation by the Walker 256 tumor implanted in rats was also several-fold higher than normal peripheral tissues such as the muscle [ ]. Since the uptake of LDE by atherosclerotic aortas is roughly 2.5 fold greater than that normal aortas [ ], it is presumed that carmustine associated to LDE exerts the anti-atherosclerotic activity directly in the cells involved in atherogenesis. In this regard, LDE uptake by HUVEC and fibroblasts has been documented [ ]. However, immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive effects of the drug in bone-marrow cells cannot be discarded.
Leucocytosis is associated with atherosclerosis in experimental animals and also in subjects [ ]. Monocyte production by the bone marrow and spleen with their subsequent adhesion to the lesioned arteries and differentiation into macrophage and macrophage proliferation are crucial aspects of atherogenesis [ , , ]. It is of note that, in our study, after atherosclerosis induction by cholesterol feeding, the leukocyte count tended to rise in the control group but remained unchanged under the LDE-carmustine treatment. This could be a mechanism whereby the treatment had the ability to reduce the lesions.
Compared to the effects of statins on the atherosclerotic lesions of cholesterol-fed rabbits, the effects of LDE-carmustine were much better, since statin treatment reduces the rabbit lesions by 20 % at most [ ], or were reportedly ineffective [ ]. Human atherosclerosis development, however, is a chronic, long-standing process that takes decades for the appearance of symptoms. In this setting, low-cost, oral use drugs such as statins are first-line medications for prevention of the disease. Intravenous treatments such as LDE-carmustine could otherwise be prescribed when the severity or the aggravation of the disease requires drastic, short-term acting interventions to rapidly promote atheroma regression and plaque stabilization.
Recent advances have shown several nanomedicine-based treatment strategies for atherosclerosis, such as imaging, diagnostic functionality and drug delivery. [ ]. Drug-delivery systems have scarcely been explored in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases [ ]. Potential advantages of LDE-carmustine should be the lack of immunogenicity and toxicities related with nanotechnology products, which has become a major issue in this field. The fact that the LDE constituent materials are only lipids, which are present in the organism and are provided by the chemical industry, the low cost and the facility to be produced at large scale are also chief advantages of the LDE system.
The safety of LDE-carmustine treatment has been previously indicated in clinical studies. In a Phase 1 study of this formulation enrolling 42 patients with solid malignant cancers, we showed that very high dose carmustine associated to LDE, from 150 to 350 mg/m 2 body surface every 4 weeks, had minimal clinical and laboratorial toxicity to the patients [ ]. No significant hematological, hepatic, or renal toxicity was observed.
In conclusion, marked effects of LDE-carmustine in reducing the lesion area and intimal width of the rabbit aortas were found in this study. This may pave the way for future clinical trials patients with cardiovascular disease, specially because the safety of this formulation has been demonstrated in previous studies in cancer patients.
