Introduction
Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is the most commonly reported cause of toxic deaths [ ]. CO has 200- to 250-fold binding capacity to iron atoms in hemoglobin compared with oxygen. Thus, it reduces the oxygen transportation capacity of blood. It also binds to intracellular proteins including myoglobin and cytochrome-C oxidase, leading to impaired oxidative phosphorylation. This process results in tissue toxicities that may result in cell death [ ].
Myocardial damage due to CO poisoning may be observed as a result of myocardial hypoperfusion with toxic effects on the myocardial mitochondria. This damage may be manifested clinically in several ways, from nonfatal arrhythmias in ECG findings to myocardial infarction or cardiomyopathy [ ]. Myocardial dysfunction has been reported by echocardiography in several studies on myocardial injury-related CO poisoning. However, all of these studies were performed using conventional echocardiographic techniques such as left ventricular (LV) volume, LV ejection fraction (LVEF), and wall motion score index [ , , ].
Speckle tracking echocardiography is an objective and reproducible method that quantitates global and regional myocardial deformation independently of the angle of insonation and cardiac translational movements [ , , ]. The strain and strain rates might be measured directly from two-dimensional (2D) grayscale images. Speckle tracking echocardiography examination provides a better tool for evaluating cardiac wall motion. During a literature review, we found no study regarding the relationship between strain measurements and CO poisoning.
This study aimed to evaluate patients with CO poisoning by using speckle tracking echocardiography, a potentially more sensitive technique, to identify left systolic ventricular dysfunction.
Materials and Methods
Study Population
We investigated a total of 102 consecutive patients with CO exposure who were accepted to the emergency service of our hospital between November 2016 and February 2017. Patients who were referred for urgent hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) from other centers were also included in this study. Among these patients, those with known prior coronary artery disease ( n = 7), moderate-to-severe aortic and mitral stenosis and regurgitation ( n = 2), atrial fibrillation ( n = 2), nonischemic cardiomyopathy ( n = 1), pregnancy ( n = 4), and poor echocardiographic image quality ( n = 5) were excluded from the study. Among patients who were referred by other healthcare facilities, those with carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) levels < 10% at the time of presentation were also excluded from the study ( n = 3). Finally, 78 patients were included in the study. Furthermore, 35 age-matched healthy subjects (20 males, mean age: 43 ± 16 years) with normal strain levels were included in the study as a control group.
All patients and their first-degree relatives were informed about the study procedure, and informed consent was obtained from all of them. The study was also approved by the institutional ethical board.
CO poisoning was diagnosed according to patients’ medical history, physical examination, and blood COHb levels. Patients with COHb levels ≥ 10% were considered to have CO poisoning [ ]. All patients were transferred to the echocardiography laboratory immediately after baseline blood samples, and blood gas measurements were collected. All patients were referred for HBOT after consultation with the hyperbaric medicine team. Follow-up echocardiographic examinations were also performed on days 10–15 (mean 12 days) after patients’ discharge. All patients were referred to a treadmill stress test (Bruce protocol) at the follow-up control. Patients who could not perform the treadmill stress test were referred to a pharmacological stress test (basically, myocardial perfusion scintigraphy).
Laboratory Analyses
Arterial and venous blood samples were obtained to determine the baseline levels of serum creatinine, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, hemoglobin, troponin-I, creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) fraction, arterial blood gas (PCO 2 , PO 2 , pH, and COHb), and blood glucose. Troponin-I levels of 0.0–0.06 ng/mL (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) and CK-MB levels of 0.00–5.00 ng/mL (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) were considered normal.
Carboxyhemoglobin levels were measured using an ABL 700 blood gas analyzer (Radiometer, Copenhagen, Denmark). Blood gas measurements including COHb levels, troponin-I, and CK-MB were collected daily until the patients were discharged.
Echocardiography
Echocardiographic examinations were performed by the same expert physician echocardiographer using a commercially available ultrasound system (EPIQ; Philips Medical Systems, Bothell, WA, USA) equipped with an X5-1 xMATRIX array transducer. The echocardiograms were reviewed offline using QLAB version 7.0 (Philips Medical Systems). Standard 2D images were acquired according to the recommendations of the American Society of Echocardiography and guidelines of the European Association of Echocardiography [ , ]. M-mode echocardiography was used to measure LV end-diastolic and end-systolic diameters. Two-dimensional LV volumes were determined using the modified Simpson’s method with images obtained from apical four- and two-chamber views. Pulsed-wave Doppler ultrasound was performed in the apical four-chamber view. The peak early ( E ) and late ( A ) diastolic filling velocities, E / A ratio, and E -wave deceleration times were obtained from transmitral recordings. Similarly, by using tissue Doppler of mitral annulus, maximum myocardium velocities were measured at early ( E ′) and late ( A ′) diastole and the ratio E ′/ E was calculated.
2D LV Strain Analyses
2D speckle tracking software (Automated Cardiac Motion Quantification aCMQ) was used to calculate the LV longitudinal strain (LS) and circumferential strain (CS). All 2D clips analyzed were acquired at a high frame rate (> 60 frames/s). Global and segmental LV LS and CS were calculated [ ]. The LV CS was analyzed in basal, medial, and apical short-axis views, and the LV LS was analyzed in four-, two-, and three-chamber views. The endocardial border was manually traced at the end-diastole. Tracking was then performed, and the strain–time curves were obtained automatically. The strain–time curves were analyzed manually, and if tracking was suboptimal, the endocardial border was retraced. If satisfactory tracking was not accomplished within three attempts, nontracking segments were excluded from the analysis. Peak LS measurements were obtained from 17 regional segments and peak CS measurements, from 12 regional segments. The regional strain values were averaged to determine the global longitudinal strain (GLS) and global circumferential strain (GCS).
Statistical Analysis
The continuous variables (numeric variables: age, GLS, LVEF, etc.) that were expressed as mean ± standard deviation and the categorical variables (a finite number of categories or distinct groups: diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoking, coronary artery disease, COPD, and gender), as number and percentage (%). The continuous variables were compared across the groups using Student’s t -test or the Mann–Whitney U test. The categorical variables were compared using the Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test. A comparison of the echocardiographic variables at admission and follow-up was performed using paired Student’s t -test or the Wilcoxon test. To determine the independent predictors of CO cardiotoxicity, multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted by including peak troponin-I, body mass index (BMI), and GLS. Receiver operating characteristics (ROCs) curve analysis was performed to predict the cutoff value of GLS, GCS, and peak troponin-I. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were conducted using the statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS 20.0) for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA).
Results
Five patients failed to maintain their follow-up. Three patients with elevated troponin levels and chest pain underwent coronary angiography. Two patients had normal coronary angiography results, whereas one had 90% stenoses in the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery. This patient was excluded because the patient’s strain levels could be affected by coronary ischemia. Noninvasive ischemia analyses (treadmill test and pharmacological myocardial perfusion scintigraphy) were normal in other patients. Finally, statistical analyses were performed on 72 patients (mean age 44.2 ± 19.4 years, 61.1% ( n = 44) males).
Patients were divided into two groups based on their LVEF values. Twenty-four patients (mean age 51 ± 20 years, 50% ( n = 12) males) were included in the LV systolic dysfunction group (LVEF < 55%, Group 1), and the remaining 48 patients (mean age 40 ± 18 years, 67% ( n = 32) males) were included in the preserved LV systolic function group (LVEF ≥ 55%, Group 2). Table 1 shows the clinical baseline characteristics and laboratory values of CO-poisoned patients according to the groups.

Table 2 shows the echocardiographic findings of the study groups. In conventional TTE, baseline left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic diameter volumes of Group 1 patients were significantly higher than those of Group 2 patients ( p = <0.001). While diastolic dysfunction was observed in both groups, diastolic function was more severely impaired in Group 1. In Group 1, compared with Group 2, E ′ velocity was low ( E ′ = 5.9 ± 1.7 cm/s vs. 8.0 ± 2.1 cm/s, p = 0.046) and E / E ′ ratio was high ( E / E ′ = 9.7 ± 3.9 vs. 8.5 ± 1.8, p = 0.044).

The strain levels at the time of admission were significantly low compared with the follow-up values in both groups ( p < 0.001). However, the strain levels at admission in Group 1 were lower than those in Group 2 ( p < 0.001). The reduction in strain levels in Group 1 was observed in correlation with the reduction in LVEF ( p < 0.001). In Group 2, although there were no significant changes in LVEF, strain levels were significantly low ( p = 0.091; p < 0.001) (Table 3 and Fig. 1 ).

The mean age for healthy volunteers was 43 + 16 years. Of these, 57.1% ( n = 20) were male. Mean BMI was 25.6 ± 3.1. The mean strain values of GLS and GCS for the control group were − 21.9 ± 1.7 and 22.2 ± 1.1, respectively. GLS and GLC values of CO-poisoned patients at admission were significantly low in both Groups 1 and 2 compared with the control group. By contrast, no significant difference was observed when compared with the follow-up GLS value (Table 3 ).
In univariate logistic regression analysis, GLS, GCS, and peak troponin values at admission were predictive of CO cardiotoxicity ( p < 0.001; p < 0.001, and p < 0.022, respectively) (Table 4 ).

To find the predictors of cardiotoxicity, multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted by including peak troponin-I, BMI, and GLS. GLS ( p ≤ 0.001; OR 1.731; 95% CI 1.313–2.281) and BMI ( p ≤ 0.008; OR 1.750; 95% CI 0.606–0.929) were found as independent predictors of cardiotoxicity.
Discussion
It is well established that CO poisoning impairs echocardiographic parameters. However, conventional echocardiography may be insufficient for demonstrating mildly impaired LV systolic function. Our study demonstrated that impaired LV function that cannot be demonstrated using conventional echocardiography may be demonstrated using speckle tracking echocardiography. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use speckle tracking echocardiography for this purpose. Both GLS and GCS were seen to be significantly impaired during the acute phase of CO poisoning compared with the mean follow-up measurements.
Numerous mechanisms may play a role in cardiac dysfunction in CO poisoning. CO has approximately 30–60 times higher affinity to myoglobin and cytochrome-C oxidase compared with oxygen. When CO binds to these intracellular proteins, the heart’s capacity to use oxygen is impaired. When insufficient oxygen supply is added, cardiac dysfunction, also called stunned myocardium - like syndrome , develops [ ]. Energy production and mitochondrial function recover after COHb levels decrease.
Echocardiography plays a crucial role in identifying LV dysfunction in daily clinical practice. LVEF is calculated by using biplane LV end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes; however, the calculated LVEF may not truly represent LV systolic function in specific cardiac diseases or when subtle LV dysfunction is present. 2D speckle tracking echocardiography enables the assessment of myocardial strain, thereby providing detailed information on global and regional LV deformation. This is of particular interest when subtle LV systolic dysfunction is present despite preserved LVEF [ ]. In this study, we applied speckle tracking echocardiography to assess LV function and to understand the process of impairment of LV function in patients with CO poisoning.
In our study, LV systolic function was evaluated using the biplane Simpson’s method, and two groups were obtained: patients with reduced ejection fraction and those with preserved ejection fraction. The proportion of patients with impaired LV systolic function was 33.3%. However, our study demonstrated that when these patients were evaluated using speckle tracking echocardiography, almost all individuals actually had LV systolic dysfunction. In patients with both reduced global strain levels and reduced ejection fraction, LV dysfunction occurred in different magnitudes from mild to severe. Although echocardiography studies of CO poisoning revealed two different echocardiographic patterns (regional wall motion abnormality like apical ballooning and global hypokinesia) in patients with impaired LV systolic dysfunction, only global hypokinesia was observed in our patient group [ ].
In a meta-analysis in which 24 studies were evaluated, normal LV GLS varied from − 15.9 to − 22.1% (mean − 19.7%) and normal LV GCS, from − 20.9 to − 27.8% (mean − 23.3%) [ ]. Obviously, there are differences in normal values in various studies. In our study, 35 healthy individuals were evaluated using speckle tracking echocardiography to calculate mean strain levels and obtained normal strain levels. Normal GLS and GCS values were calculated as − 21.9 ± 1.7 and − 22.2 ± 1.1, respectively. The strain levels in the LV dysfunction group were found to be far lower than normal. In preserved LVEF patients with CO poisoning, strain levels were lower than those calculated for the control group. Although our baseline normal values for GLS and GCS were slightly higher than those obtained in other studies, our primary purpose was to evaluate the difference in these values between admission and follow-up measurements. The significant difference between these values could potentially be indicative of subtle LV systolic dysfunction. Based on these findings, we believe that speckle tracking echocardiography is a more specific technique than Simpson’s method to reveal subtle LV systolic dysfunction in CO poisoning cases.
On the other hand, among patients with preserved LVEF, impaired GLS and GCS levels were found even if CO poisoning was mild in severity. Many reasons explain the increased sensitivity of LS compared with LVEF in the detection of CO cardiotoxicity. Subclinical LV impairment may be identified by reduced longitudinal function probably because subendocardial fibers are most susceptible to injury [ ]. In cardiotoxicity studies with chemotherapeutics, subendocardial myofibrils dominating the LV longitudinal mechanics were seen to be more susceptible to toxicity, and GLS was impaired in the absence of LVEF impairment [ ]. One opinion on this topic is that the heart was relatively unaffected mid-myocardial and epicardial mechanical function, thereby maintaining normal overall LV function, at least in the early stage [ ].
According to the latest international guidelines, HBOT should be used in all patients with severe CO poisoning. The severity is assessed on indicators of organ damage rather than simply on COHb levels [ ]. Troponin, CK-MB, ECG, and conventional echocardiography are used for evaluating the cardiac effects of CO poisoning; however, there is still no consensus on how to determine the treatment strategy and how to predict myocardial effects [ ]. The biplane Simpson’s method that relies on LV end-diastolic and end-systolic volume measurements, myocardial performance index, or Doppler-based echocardiography measurements may not be sufficient for early prediction of subclinical dysfunction [ ]. The fact that previous echocardiography studies with these methods yielded different cardiac dysfunction ratios may be supportive of our standpoint [ , , , ]. Our study demonstrated that decreases in LS and CS values were well predictive and increases in troponin-I levels were moderately predictive of CO cardiotoxicity. When we compared troponin-I and strain levels, speckle tracking echocardiography was a better predictor. Based on these results, it can be concluded that any individual who is exposed to CO poisoning and who has clinical manifestations has affected cardiac functions. In such situations, if HBOT is available, we believe that it would be useful to refer the patient for early HBOT.
Limitations
The fact that patients were not able to definitely describe the duration of CO exposure may be a confounder in time-based evaluations of cardiac effects. In addition, lack of exact information on previous LV systolic function or status of coronary arteries of patients exposed to CO poisoning may alter the strain values.
Conclusions
Our study demonstrates the potential of using systolic strain values obtained using 2D speckle tracking echocardiography in determining cardiotoxicity due to CO poisoning. It also showed that almost all patients exposed to CO poisoning had LV dysfunction ranging from mild to severe. As this is considered organ damage, if possible, all patients exposing to CO poisoning should be treated with HBOT. Speckle tracking echocardiography has the potential of demonstrating subtle LV systolic dysfunction even in patients with preserved EF. In clinical practice, this finding suggests that all CO poisoning patients could benefit from early HBOT.
