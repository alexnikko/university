Introduction
Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome (AWS) is one of the most common presentations of Alcohol Dependence Syndrome (Dixit et al. ). The most severe manifestations of withdrawal include delirium tremens , hallucinations, and seizures. The use of an anticonvulsant drug decreases the probability of a patient experiencing withdrawal seizures, thereby reducing the complications of AWS (Eyer et al. ; Jesse et al. ). Benzodiazepines are the drugs of choice in most treatment approaches to AWS; however, other anticonvulsant drugs may represent suitable alternatives, mainly when the patient exhibits partial or complete resistance due to a breakdown of GABA inhibition (Schmidt et al. ). Anticonvulsant drugs have been effectively used to treat mood disorders, which share some symptoms with AWS, including depression, irritability, and anxiety (Hammond et al. ; Sachdeva et al. ). Therefore, new drugs with neuroprotective effects against the seizure-induced neuronal injury and degeneration are desirable, pointing to the need to investigate alternative drugs to treat alcoholism (Huynh et al. ; Löscher ).
Lobeline (Lob) is an alkaloid originally found in Lobelia inflate (Felpin and Lebreton ). It reduces depression-like behavior (Roni and Rahman ) and enhances the efficacy of monoaminergic antidepressants reboxetine, fluoxetine, or bupropion in mice, inhibiting reuptake of norepinephrine, serotonin or dopamine (Roni and Rahman ). Lobeline induced anxiolytic-like effects in C57BL/6 J mice in the elevated plus-maze (EPM) and the marble-burying test (Roni and Rahman ). Receptor binding studies suggest that Lob is a brain nonselective nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) antagonist with high affinity for α4β2 and α3β2- subtypes (Damaj et al. ; Dwoskin and Crooks ; Parker et al. ). The binding of Lob to nAChRs has been associated with antidepressant-like and anxiolytic-like effects in mice (Roni and Rahman ). Furthermore, research indicates that brain nAChR subtypes are important mediators of the rewarding effects of alcohol (ethanol) and drugs of abuse (Liu et al. ; Rahman et al. ). Lobeline was found to decrease alcohol self-administration in rodents. Besides its affinity for the α4β2 and α3β2 nAChR subtypes, the fact that it decreases preference for ethanol has suggested that Lob is a strong candidate in the treatment of alcoholism (Bell et al. ; Farook et al. ; Sajja and Rahman , ). However, no study on anticonvulsant aspects of Lob has been published, except for a paper in which this alkaloid was isolated from Lobelia nicotianaefolia and tested in pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)- and strychnine-induced seizure models in male mice to evaluate its anticonvulsant activity (Tamboli et al. ).
Considering that the drugs used to treat alcohol abuse should control possible withdrawal seizures, the aim of this study was to evaluate the anticonvulsant activity of Lob in pilocarpine (Pil)-induced seizure model in mice and its modulatory effects on DNA damage and oxidative stress in target tissues. Pilocarpine is a non-selective AChR agonist that increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) associated to induction of seizures (Freitas ; Qiu et al. ; Tsai et al. ). As ROS are also involved in the toxicity due to alcohol abuse (Brooks ; Yu et al. ; Leach et al. ), this model appears to be suitable to evaluate anticonvulsant and neuroprotective activities of Lob.
Material and methods
Drugs
(−)-Lobeline hydrochloride monohydrate (Lob) (PubChem CID: 45,358,761) and Pil were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Diazepam (Dzp) (Compaz ®) was purchased from Cristália Prod. Quim. Farm (São Paulo, SP, Brazil). The drugs were dissolved in saline solution NaCl 0.9% (Sal). All solutions were prepared immediately prior to administration.
Animals
A total of 69 adult male CF-1 mice (two months old) from our breeding colony were used. Mice were housed in plastic cages (five per cage) with ad libitum access to water and food under a 12-h light/dark cycle (lights on at 8:00 AM) and at a constant temperature of 22.0 ± 1 °C. All experimental procedures were carried out in accordance with the National Institute of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH Publications No. 80–23) (revised, 1996). This work was approved by the Committee on the Ethical Use of Animals of ULBRA (N. 2014-9P).
Experimental groups
The animals were divided in seven groups and received two 10-mL/kg-intraperitoneal injections (body weight) at a 30-min interval, as follows: Sal + Sal ( N = 12); Lob 10 + Sal ( N = 5); Lob 20 + Sal (N = 5); Sal + Pil ( N = 13); Lob 10 + Pil ( N = 11); Lob 20 + Pil (N = 12); Dzp + Pil (N = 11). The doses were 300 mg/kg for Pil, 2 mg/kg for Dzp, and 10 and 20 mg/kg for Lob, chosen based on previous studies (Coelho et al. ; Reddy and Kuruba ; Tamboli et al. ).
Pilocarpine-induced seizure test
To evaluate the anticonvulsant effect of Lob on Pil-induced seizures in male mice, the protocol used was based on Costa et al. ( ), with minor changes (Coelho et al. ). Diazepam (2 mg/kg) was used as a positive control. First, animals received an injection of Sal, Dzp, and Lob 10 or 20 mg/kg (i.p.). Thirty minutes after treatment, mice received a single dose of Pil (300 mg/kg) and were placed individually in acrylic observation chambers. The severity of seizures was observed using the adapted Racine scale: 0, no convulsive behavior; 1, playing piano; 2, clonic forelimb convulsions lasting less than 3 s; 3, clonic forelimb convulsions lasting more than 3 s; 4, generalized convulsions with tonic extension episodes and full status epilepticus; 5, death. To compare the groups we used the latency to first seizure (LFS) and the percentage of occurrence of clonic forelimb seizures longer than 3 s (stage 3 in the Racine scale). Groups treated only with Lob (10 or 20 mg/kg) and Sal were used as controls. All experiments were carried out between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. in a quiet room at 22 ± 1 °C. The animals were euthanized by decapitation after the 90-min experimental period, and samples of cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and blood were collected to perform the comet assay and evaluate free radical levels, superoxide dismutase, and catalase activities.
Comet assay
The comet assay was carried out as described by Tice et al. ( ) with minor modifications (Moraes e Luz et al. ). Immediately after the behavior test, the animals were euthanized and blood, cerebral cortex, and hippocampus samples were collected. The cortex and hippocampus were placed in 500 μL cold phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS) and minced into small pieces in order to obtain a cell suspension. Blood samples (100 μL) were collected in heparin solution (Liquemine® 25.000 UI, 10 μL). Cell suspensions (5 μL) were embedded in 95 μL 0.75% low melting point agarose (GibcoBRL) and spread onto agarose-precoated microscope slides. In addition, the slides from animals treated only with Lob or Sal were transferred to either PBS (without H 2 O 2 ) or 0.25 mM freshly prepared H 2 O 2 solution (ex vivo treatment with H 2 O 2 ) for 5 min, at 4 °C, and then washed three times with PBS. All slides were placed in lysis buffer (2.5 M NaCl, 100 mM EDTA, and 10 mM Tris, freshly added 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) and 10% DMSO, pH 10.0) for 48 h at 4 °C. The slides were subsequently incubated in freshly prepared alkaline buffer (300 mM NaOH and 1 mM EDTA, pH > 13) for 20 min at 4 °C. An electric current of 300 mA and 25 V (0.90 V/cm) was applied for 15 min to induce DNA electrophoresis. The slides were then neutralized (0.4 M Tris, pH 7.5), stained with silver, and analyzed under an optical microscope.
Images of 100 randomly selected nucleoids from each tissue (50 nucleoids from each from two replicate slide) were analyzed. To calculate damage index (DI), nucleoids were visually allocated into five classes according to tail size (0 = no tails and 4 = maximum-length tails), which resulted in a single DNA damage score for each tissue and for each group studied. Therefore, the DI of the group could range from 0 (completely undamaged = 100 nucleoids × 0) to 400 (maximum damage = 100 nucleoids × 4). The percent damage frequency (DF) was calculated for each sample based on the number of nucleoids with tail versus those without (Sousa et al. ).
Tissue homogenization
Frozen cerebral cortex and hippocampus were vigorously vortexed in lysis buffer (Tris-HCl 50 mM, Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride 1%), left to rest for 30 min, submitted to six 30-s ice/vortex cycles, and centrifuged at 16,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was collected and protein concentration was measured according to the method described by Lowry et al. ( ) using serum bovine albumin as standard.
Free radical levels
Homogenates (20 μL) were mixed in 96-well dark-plate with 175 μL phosphate-buffered saline (pH. 7.4) and 5 μL of 2,7 Dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF) 1 mM, and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation period, fluorescence of the homogenates were measured on a SpectraMax M2e Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, MDS Analytical Technologies, Sunnyvale, California). The excitation/emission wavelengths for DCF were 480/520 nm. Values of relative fluorescence (RFU) were expressed as RFU mg −1 protein (Mattiello et al. ).
Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity
SOD activity was evaluated by quantifying the inhibition of superoxide-dependent autoxidation of epinephrine. The absorbance of the samples was read at 480 nm (Misra and Fridovich ). Briefly, 170 μL of 50 mM glycine buffer pH 10.2 and 10 μL of 10 mM catalase were added to 10 μL of homogenate. After that, 10 μL of epinephrine was added and absorbance was immediately recorded every 36 s for 15 min at 480 nm in a SpectraMax M2e Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, MDS Analytical Technologies, Sunnyvale, California). The inhibition of epinephrine autoxidation occurs in the presence of SOD, whose activity may then be indirectly assayed spectrophotometrically. One SOD unit is defined as the amount of SOD necessary to inhibit 50% of epinephrine autoxidation and the specific activity is reported as SOD Units/mg protein.
Catalase (CAT) activity
CAT activity was assayed according to the method described by Chance and Machley ( ), based on the disappearance of H 2 O 2 at 240 nm. Briefly, 30 μL of homogenate was added to 1600 μL of potassium phosphate buffer (KH 2 PO 4 50 mM, Na 2 HPO 4 50 mM, pH 7.0). Subsequently, 10 μL of H 2 O 2 (25 mM) was added and absorbance was immediately recorded every 30 s for 5 min using SpectraMax M2e Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, MDS Analytical Technologies, Sunnyvale, California). One CAT unit was defined as one μmol of hydrogen peroxide consumed per minute, and the specific activity was calculated as CAT Units/mg protein.
DPPH-scavenging assay
The DPPH assay was conducted according to Sharma and Kumar ( ), with minor modifications. In a 96-well microplate, samples (20 μL) at concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 50 mM were mixed with 80 μL of buffer Tri-HCl (100 mM, pH 7.4) and 100 μL of DPPH solution (250 μM in methanol) and incubated for 30 min in the dark. Absorbance was measured at 517 nm. Each sample was repeated three times in triplicate. Trolox and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) were used as positive controls. The negative control was prepared as above, but containing methanol in place of the sample. The antioxidant activity was estimated using the following equation: (control absorbance - sample absorbance) / control absorbance) ×100.
Statistical analysis
The data of latency to first seizure (LFS) were expressed as mean ± standard error (SEM) and examined using Kruskal–Wallis one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunn’s test. The seizure percentage (%) were calculated and analyzed using Fisher’s exact test. Data from the comet assay were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and statistical analyses was carried out using ANOVA complemented by Tukey’s test or Dunnett’s test. All experiments with homogenized were expressed as mean ± SEM and evaluated using Student’s t- test. The statistical evaluation of DPPH data was carried out using ANOVA complemented by Tukey’s test. In all comparisons, p ≤ 0.05 was considered as indicating statistical significance.
Results
Figure 1 shows the effect of Lob on Pil-induced seizures. The groups treated with Dzp and Lob 20 mg/kg showed higher LFS ( p < 0.001 ) than the Sal + Pil group (Fig. 1 a). All animals of the Sal + Pil group presented clonic forelimb seizures longer than 3 s (Fig. 1 b). Diazepam protected against seizures in 100% of animals. The group treated with Lob 20 mg/kg showed a significant reduction in the percentage of seizures ( p < 0.01 ) compared with the Sal + Pil group. Lobeline 10 mg/kg did not induce any significant effect.

Table 1 shows the results of the comet assay in samples of blood, hippocampus, and cerebral cortex collected immediately after the behavioral test. In peripheral blood, there was no statistical difference in the DI and DF values among the groups. The Lob 10 + Sal and Lob 20 + Sal treatments did not increase DI and DF in hippocampus and cerebral cortex in comparison with the Sal + Sal treatment, indicating that Lob was not able to induce DNA damage in brain tissues. However, the Sal + Pil group increased DI and DF values in hippocampus and cerebral cortex in comparison with the Sal + Sal group, indicating DNA damage induced by Pil in the seizure model in both tissues. Pre-treatment with Lob10 mg/kg decreased DNA damage in cerebral cortex ( p < 0.001 ), while at 20 mg/kg both brain tissues were protected against Pil-induced damage. Diazepam also decreased DNA damage, mainly in cerebral cortex.

In the challenge with hydrogen peroxide ex vivo, the cells from the group treated with Lob 20 mg/kg were more resistant to oxidative DNA damage induced by H 2 O 2 , since the DI values were lower than in the Sal + Sal group + H 2 O 2 , in all tissues studied. At 10 mg/kg, a significant decrease in DI was detected only in peripheral blood (Table 2 ).

Discussion
The genotoxic and pharmacologic effects of Lob have been evaluated in male mice in our previous studies (da Costa e Silva et al. ; Verde Rodrigues et al. ). In this study, anticonvulsant and neuroprotective effects of Lob were assessed using a Pil- induced seizure model and the measurement of DNA damage and oxidative stress in different mice tissues. For the all evaluations performed here, a single gender can provide the findings intended, that is why we chose male mice. The Lob doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg were chosen based on previous studies that showed that, in this range of doses, Lob attenuates the preference for ethanol intake in rodents (Bell et al. ; Farook et al. ; Sajja and Rahman , ) and reduced the frequency of seizures induced by PTZ and strychnine in mice (Tamboli et al. ).
Pilocarpine is a non-selective muscarinic AChR agonist inducing cholinergic hyperactivation, which can initiate status epilepticus (Reddy and Kuruba ; Smolders et al. ). In this study, Lob 20 mg/kg was able to increase the latency to the first seizure and decrease the percentage of seizures (Fig. 1 ). This effects could be due to competition for binding AChR, increasing the latency to the first seizure. However, it is not known if Lob binds to muscarinic AChRs, but in turn Lob binds to nicotinic α4β2 and α3β2 AChR subtypes with high affinity as a competitive antagonist (Arias et al. ; Dwoskin and Crooks ; Flammia et al. ; Kaniaková et al. ). Preclinical studies using models of seizures in rodents have revealed that nAChR antagonists may have anticonvulsant effects. Conventional anticonvulsants like lamotrigine, for example, may inhibit α4β2 nAChR function with beneficial effects in the treatment of some specific forms of epileptic disorders such as autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE) and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) (Ghasemi and Hadipour-Niktarash ; Zheng et al. ). Hence, the anticonvulsant effect of Lob may be associated with its binding to nAChR.
The anticonvulsant activities of Lob may result from the involvement in other neurotransmission systems, like glutamate and GABA, which are also modulated by Pil (Reddy and Kuruba ). The seizure-inducing activity of Pil is maintained through a glutamatergic mechanism; drugs inhibiting glutamatergic NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity may decrease the Pil-induced seizures and neuronal injuries (Pereira et al. ). Furthermore, it is known that α4β2 nAChRs in the prefrontal cortex, to which Lob may bind, appears to be involved in glutamate release (Lambe et al. ; Parikh et al. ). Aracri et al. ( ) have shown that nicotine, which is a cholinergic agonist, increased the frequency of spontaneous glutamatergic excitatory post-synaptic currents. Thus, the binding of antagonists to nAChRs may inhibit the release of glutamate, which in turn may explain how Lob inhibits seizures.
However, the effect of most of anticonvulsant agents, such as diazepam, is to enhance the response to GABA A by facilitating the opening of GABA-activated chloride channels (Gravielle ). Diazepam avoided Pil-induced seizures (Fig. 1 ), suggesting the involvement of the GABA neurotransmission system in this model. In a previous study, Lob had anticonvulsant effects in PTZ- and strychnine-induced seizure models, which are associated more specifically with modulation of GABA neurotransmission, decreasing seizures by reducing the imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission in those models (Tamboli et al. ). This is the first study showing the anticonvulsant properties of Lob in Pil-induced seizures.
There was no increase in DI or DF values of Lob-treated groups in comparison to the saline group (Table 1 ), indicating that Lob did not induce genotoxic activities in the evaluated tissues. In previous preclinical studies to evaluate safety, Lob alone or combined with ethanol was not able to induce genotoxic or mutagenic effects, as observed in this study (da Costa e Silva et al. ; Verde Rodrigues et al. ). The comet assay can detect recent damage, such as single and double strand breaks and alkali-labile damages. Yet, at least two sampling times, 2–6 h and 23–26 h, are recommended to evaluate the occurrence of DNA repair and damage (OECD ). Here, the samples were collected 90 min after administration, corresponding to the time to conclude the behavioral test. No signal of toxicity was observed in that period.
The cortex and hippocampus are the most sensitive regions to epilepsy-related damage following convulsions produced by Pil. Pilocarpine induced changes in electroencephalogram activity, starting in the hippocampus, followed by the cortex (Reddy and Kuruba ; Turski et al. ;). Here, Pil increased DNA damage in hippocampus and cortex, but not in blood, indicating injury effects on brain target-tissues, probably due to induction of seizures (Table 1 ). Diazepam and Lob were able to protect DNA of cortex against injuries induced by Pil, since the groups Dzp + Pil, Lob 10 + Pil, and Lob 20 + Pil showed lower DI and DF, compared to Sal + Pil ( p < 0.001 ), suggesting neuroprotective effects. In hippocampus, the highest dose of Lob, as well as Dzp (2 mg/kg), decreased DI in comparison to Sal + Pil ( p < 0.05 ), showing DNA protective effects. Similar results were also reported in a study using rosmarinic acid (RA) and caffeic acid (CA), in which RA decreased DNA damage in cortex while CA had the same effect in the hippocampus, both at 4 mg/kg (Coelho et al. ).
The formation of free radicals can occur during the processes of Pil-induced seizures (Freitas ; Qiu et al. ; Tsai et al. ). In order to investigate whether decreased DNA damage was mediated by antioxidant-like effects of Lob, the levels of intracellular ROS and SOD and CAT antioxidant enzyme activities were measured (Figs. 2 and 3 ). Intracellular ROS was assessed by monitoring the changes in fluorescence intensity of the probe, DCF. There was an increase in DCF in cortex from the Sal + Pil group, suggesting ROS formation. Similar results were obtained using PTZ-kindling in cerebral cortex (Coelho et al. ). CAT and SOD activities tended to increase in the Sal + Pil group, and CAT activity in hippocampus rose significantly in comparison to the Sal + Sal group, indicating that cells tried to counteract ROS overproduction by increasing the antioxidant enzyme activities. Tejada et al. ( ) have shown that Pil was able to induce the antioxidant enzyme activities in rats 120 min after exposure. Here, the brain tissues were collected 60 min after injection of Pil, a period that was not long enough to increase SOD significantly.
Although Lob did not decrease DCF levels, the treatment with Lob significantly reduced CAT activity in hippocampus, and tended to decrease it in cortex, in comparison to the Sal + Pil group, leading to values similar as those obtained for the Sal + Sal group. This suggests that the treatment with Lob prevented Pil-induced CAT overactivity. These findings may be associated with like-antioxidant effect of Lob related to detoxifying of hydrogen peroxide, which is decomposed by CAT. In the DPPH assay (Fig. 4 ), Lob showed an IC 50 = 37.43 mM, much higher than the values observed for controls Trolox IC 50 = 0.63 mM and NAC IC 50 = 2.21 mM, suggesting that Lob has weak in vitro scavenging effect on DPPH. In an acute lung injury model, Lob showed beneficial effects attributed to its modulation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) pathways as well as antioxidative enzymes activities, indicating that Lob may detoxify ROS (Li et al. ).
These protective effects were highlighted when Lob decreased oxidative DNA damage; cells from groups treated with Lob were challenged ex vivo with hydrogen peroxide and compared with cells from the saline group (Table 2 ). Lobeline 20 mg/kg decreased DI in all tissues studied, while at 10 mg/kg this decrease was observed only in blood, corroborating a previous study (da Costa e Silva et al. ) and suggesting that Lob can increase genomic stability as a result of its antioxidant-like effects. Thus, in the Pil model, Lob appears to protect the DNA of hippocampus and cortex in part due to its ability to decrease oxidative stress.
Conclusions
Lobeline decreased seizures and presented neuprotective effects, likely mediated by antagonizing cholinergic neurotransmission. The compound may also act inhibiting glutamatergic excitotoxicity, leading to a decrease in ROS production as well as in DNA oxidative damage. These findings indicate that this alkaloid has anticonvulsant potential, which is an important property in drugs used in the treatment of AWS. Therefore, Lob should be more comprehensively investigated in further studies focused on the treatment of alcoholism.
