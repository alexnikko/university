Introduction
Tuberculosis (TB) is still a burdensome disease causing a huge death toll every year all over the world. The disease is aggravated by its perilous liaison with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and also due to drug resistance manifested by the bacterium. As per the 2016 WHO estimates, 10.4 million people fell ill with TB and 0.4 million deaths were due to TB disease in persons living with HIV [ ]. This indicates the gravity of the situation calling for prompt measures in TB disease management. Although the current armamentarium of drugs is efficient in curing the disease, however, we still lack efficient prognostic markers or tools that can determine treatment success in TB patients. Even the clinicians find it difficult to arrive at a decision whether to stop the treatment or not, as the available prognostic tools mostly rely on detection of acid-fast bacilli by classical microscopy or time-consuming culture. Sputum microscopy, at the end of second and sixth months of TB therapy, is the most commonly used tool in underdeveloped and developing countries, but it suffers from inherent demerits [ ] and inability to differentiate between live and dead bacilli [ ]. Although sputum culture, the gold standard, overcomes the demerits of sputum microscopy, a long turnaround time of 6–8 weeks for solid media and 2 weeks for liquid culture makes that also not a good option for prognosis. This demerit of sputum smear microscopy and mycobacterial culture during TB treatment has been highlighted by a meta-analysis study which showed that these tests exhibited low sensitivity and modest specificity for predicting failure and relapse [ ]. Moreover, in the case of nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), the reporting time is lesser but like sputum microscopy, it also cannot differentiate between dead and live bacilli [ ] and is not easily affordable due to high cost. These disadvantages necessitate the search for more efficient host-based biomarkers that can predict the response to tuberculosis treatment and the risk of tuberculosis relapse. Blood, the accessible bio-fluid (especially in cases where sputum is not available), in all disease groups (pulmonary TB or extra-pulmonary TB and TB diseased pediatric or geriatric individuals) may be explored for host molecules which can be of use in predicting treatment success. Therefore, we made an attempt to evaluate the host immune cell markers in cells of the peripheral blood of pulmonary TB patients (PTB) for predicting TB treatment success/failure in this regard.
Several cellular markers have been studied during TB treatment by many research groups for predicting treatment efficacy [ , ]. The usefulness of the promising T regulatory cell (Treg)-associated markers (viz., CD25, CD39, and FoxP3) in predicting TB treatment success or failure in PTB was evaluated in this study. The expression of these markers and cellular subsets was observed in new smear-positive treatment-naive PTB (TN-PTB) and compared with those PTB who had successfully completed 6 months of anti-tuberculous treatment (ATT) (the treatment-completed (TC) groups were as follows: (i) one who were followed-up (TC-fu) during treatment and (ii) those who were not followed-up (TC-nfu) during treatment). Such a biomarker predicting treatment success or failure may also be useful in indicating the relapse. In clinical trials, such a biomarker may be of great help in defining endpoint for the evaluation of newer drugs/regimens or immunotherapeutic agents for treating the TB patients. Usefulness of these markers in predicting treatment success would not only be beneficial for PTB with sufficient sputum expectoration but also may be for those TB patients who are unable to produce sputum like geriatric and pediatric TB patients; and in those for whom where no standard patient-friendly diagnostic tests are available (extra-pulmonary TB) or where Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is not showing up in the sputum specimen (smear-negative pulmonary TB).
Materials and methods
Study participants
Ethical approval was obtained from Institutional Human Ethics Committee (IHEC) before initiating the study, and written informed consent from all the study subjects were received before collecting the samples. All the study participants were recruited from National JALMA institute for leprosy and other mycobacterial diseases (NJIL&OMD), Agra. Recruitment of study participants and methodology followed is illustrated in Fig. 1 . Fig. 1 Flowchart depicting recruitment of study groups and the experimental methodology. Groups 1, 2, and 4 comprising of NHS, treatment-naive PTB, and treatment-completed not followed-up (TC-nfu), respectively, were enrolled in the study. The group 2 TN PTB were followed up (TC-fu) till treatment completion (6 months of ATT) and were classified as group 3. Radiological parameters were recorded by taking chest X-rays for all the groups. Sputum and blood samples were collected from all the groups. To avoid observer bias, the laboratory staff was blinded to the clinical data and treating physician was blinded to the laboratory procedures.

Group 1—normal healthy subjects (NHS)
Fifteen, age (mean age 32; range 18–58) and gender matched, healthy volunteers from general population with negative sputum smear microscopy and culture, normal chest X-ray, positive or negative ELISA-based Quantiferon TB Gold In-Tube assay (QFT-IT; Qiagen, Germany), negative for HIV by ELISA (a comb based assay (Microlisa - HIV, J. Mitra & Co Pvt. Ltd., New Delhi, India)), normal random blood glucose levels (80–120 mg/dl); and no history of respiratory or constitutional symptoms were enlisted as NHS (Table 1 ). All NHS recruited were BCG vaccinated. Peripheral venous blood was drawn to determine the baseline levels of the markers and cellular subsets from NHS.

Group 2—treatment-naive PTB (TN-PTB)
Thirteen category I PTB [mean age 30 years (range 19–50) with 8 males and 5 females], who attended the NJIL&OMD, Agra, India, for TB diagnosis and treatment were recruited for the study (Table 1 ). All the patients recruited in this category were naive for standard TB treatment. Demographic details and symptomatology of the patients were collected by using a questionnaire after interrogating the patients. The presence of active PTB infection was diagnosed by clinical examination, chest radiography, and acid-fast bacilli (AFB) sputum smear positivity. The random blood glucose levels of the TN were measured. Patients having positive sputum smear, chest X-ray lesions suggestive of TB, and normal random blood glucose levels were recruited for the study. Peripheral venous blood was collected from the patients before starting the treatment.
Patients with previous history of TB, pregnant or lactating patients, with significant liver and renal function abnormalities, with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection, having any other immune suppressive condition (like undergoing: immunosuppressive therapy or cancer treatment or had recent organ transplant), and patients having AFB smear negativity were excluded.
Treatment-completed (TC) PTB
PTB who had completed the scheduled doses of standard category I TB treatment course of 6 months (treatment regimen as per the WHO treatment guidelines) [ ]. This category of TC PTB was grouped as follows:
Group 3—Followed-up treatment-completed patients (TC-fu)
This group comprised of TN PTB (group 2) who were followed throughout 6 months of ATT till their recovery. Monthly clinical evaluation and sputum smear/culture were done. Of the 13 enrolled TN PTB, only 11 (mean age 30; range 19–50) [one patient was a defaulter while the other turned out to be treatment failure (Tfp)] recovered completely from TB on administration of standard therapeutic regimen (2HRZE) 3 /4(HR) 3 , and they formed group 3-TC-fu (Table 1 ). Except the treating physician, the study team was totally unaware of the clinical details of these patients at recruitment and also during their treatment. Immediately, after last dose of scheduled ATT or during treatment failure, overnight sputum sample for AFB smear and culture were taken to assess bacteriological clearance. The random blood glucose levels were also measured. The following day, peripheral venous blood for assessing the marker and subset levels was collected from all the patients, before confirming clinical improvement, sputum smear negativity, and radiological resolution. After the blood draw, symptom recording as well as clinical examination was carried out by the treating physician for assessing improvement; chest X-ray was taken to assess radiological improvement. Later, it was found out that the sputa of all 11 patients who recovered were not having growth in LJ culture.
Group 4—Not followed-up treatment-completed patients (TC-nfu, n = 10)
This group consists of randomly selected PTB [mean age 33 years (range 19–52) with 5 males and 5 females] (Table 1 ) who have just finished 6 months of scheduled category I ATT in the RNTCP centre of NJIL&OMD. At the time of their recruitment, our study team was totally unaware of the clinical details of these patients during their treatment (i.e., not followed up). Immediately after last dose of scheduled ATT taken by the patient, overnight sputum sample for AFB smear and culture were taken to assess bacteriological clearance. The random blood glucose levels were also measured. The following day, peripheral venous blood for assessing the marker and subset levels was collected from all the patients, before confirming clinical improvement, sputum smear negativity, and radiological resolution. After the blood draw, symptom recording as well as clinical examination was carried out by the treating physician for assessing improvement; chest X-ray was taken to assess radiological improvement. Later, it was found that the sputum cultures were negative for AFB growth.
Clinical and radiological evaluation of PTB
Clinical evaluation of all the groups were made by the treating physician based on symptoms of TB-like productive cough (for > 2 weeks), fever, night sweats, loss of appetite, weight loss, hemoptysis, fatigue, and radiological parameters like opacity, cavity, and fibrosis were evaluated for the study groups using chest X-rays.
Sputum preparation for AFB staining and culture
As per the RNTCP guidelines, two sputum (spot and early morning) samples were collected from all the study participants except for NHS (only one sputum sample was obtained). Modified Petroff’s method was employed to decontaminate the sputum samples [ ]. All the samples were processed in a biosafety level-3 (BSL-3) laboratory. Further diagnosis was made based on sputum microscopy by Zeihl-Neelsen (ZN) staining, and culture of MTB was done on Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) media.
Cell culture and flow cytometry
Whole blood was collected from all the study participants by venipuncture in heparinized tubes. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by layering blood over Ficoll-Hypaque (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA). After centrifugation, the collected PBMCs were washed with Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) and suspended in complete Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI-1640) medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) (supplemented with 10% human AB serum (MP Biomedicals, CA, USA) and antibiotic antimycotic solution (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA)). Further, the PBMCs were incubated overnight in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere. Brefeldin A (1 μg/ml) (BD Biosciences, CA, USA) was added 16 h before the termination of culture. For surface marker staining, cells were tagged with surface labels viz., CD4 PerCP, CD25 FITC, CD39 PE (BD Biosciences, CA, USA), and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Further fixation and permeabilization was carried out by washing and treating the cells with FoxP3 buffer (BD Biosciences, CA, USA), after which internal label, FoxP3 Alexa fluor@647 (BD Biosciences, CA, USA), was added and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Finally, the cells were fixed using 2% paraformaldehyde and acquired by a flow cytometer (FACSAria, BD Biosciences, USA). FlowJo v10 software (FlowJo LLC, OR, USA) was employed for analysis of the acquired flow cytometry data.
Gating strategy
Gating strategy for flow cytometry analysis of peripheral blood Treg cells stained with monoclonal antibodies to CD4, CD25, CD39, and FoxP3, respectively, is illustrated in Fig. 2 . Lymphocytes were gated on a forward scatter (FSC)/side scatter (SSC) dot plot. Lymphocytes were then further gated to determine CD4 + , CD25 + , CD39 + , and FoxP3 population. Double positives like CD4 + CD25 + , CD4 + CD39 + , and CD4 + FoxP3 were also gated on lymphocytes. The frequencies of CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 and CD4 + CD25 + CD39 + Treg were determined within the CD4 + gate (Fig. 2 ). Fig. 2 Gating strategy for defining T regulatory cell (Treg) subsets . Representative flow cytometry plots of patients. a. Gated lymphocytes on a forward scatter (FSC)/side scatter (SSC) dot plot. b. Lymphocytes were then gated to determine CD4 + population. c. CD4 + CD25 + double-positive T cells were identified from lymphocyte population. d. Further from CD4 + gate, triple-positive population CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 subset was identified
Statistical analysis
Peripheral venous blood was drawn from individuals of all the groups, and marker or subset levels were assessed by laboratory staff who were blinded to the clinical details, radiographic findings, sputum smear, and culture findings. The clinical and radiological assessment was done independently by the treating physician who was blinded to the lab procedures. A clinician scientist, different from the treating physician and laboratory staff, was assigned to compare the marker/subset levels with the clinical/radiological/bacteriological findings of various groups of PTB. This methodology is followed to avoid observer bias. Statistically significant differences were evaluated in individual marker expression and cellular subsets (Treg subsets) by making paired comparisons between different study groups using Mann-Whitney U test. Comparisons were made between group 1 (NHS) and group 2 (TN-PTB), group 2 (TN-PTB) and group 3 (TC-fu), group 2 (TN-PTB) and group 4 (TC-nfu), and group 3 (TC-fu) and group 4 (TC-nfu). Similarly, Mann-Whitney U test was also employed for predicting association between marker expression (before and after treatment) and sputum smear grades by comparing treatment naive with both the treatment-completed groups and within the treatment-completed groups (comparisons were made between group TN-PTB and TC-fu; group TN-PTB and TC-nfu; group TC-fu and TC-nfu). P values < 0.05 were considered significant. The data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software Inc., version 5, CA, USA).
Results
Levels of markers in different groups
The expression of different Treg-associated markers (CD25, CD39, and FoxP3) were studied before treatment (0 months) in TN-PTB ( n = 13) and after treatment (6 months) in both TC-fu ( n = 11) and TC-nfu ( n = 10) PTB. The baseline levels of these markers were evaluated in NHS.
Out of the four markers studied, CD25 ( p < 0.0001) and CD39 ( p < 0.047) (in terms of percentage) showed a significant increase in TN-PTB when compared to the expression level in NHS. A significant decline was found in the expression of CD25 ( p < 0.0002) and CD39 ( p < 0.037) markers on treatment completion in TC-fu when compared to TN-PTB (Fig. 3 a, b). When the levels of the above markers in TC-fu were compared with that of the levels in TC-nfu, there was no statistical difference ( p values for CD25 and CD39 markers were 0.291 and 0.454 respectively). It was also observed that the marker levels in TC-fu and TC-nfu were close to the marker levels in NHS. Fig. 3 Expression of T regulatory markers/subsets in different study groups.

Frequency of cellular subsets and Treg in different groups
The role of various Treg subsets (CD4 + CD25 + , CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3, CD4 + CD25 + CD39 + ) in defining treatment success was evaluated. Differential expression of CD4 + CD25 + T-cells as observed in different study groups is illustrated by representative plots in Fig. 4 .

The cellular subsets CD4 + CD25 + ( p < 0.0001), CD4 + CD25 + CD39 + ( p < 0.0003), and CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 ( p < 0.0001) showed a marked increase in frequency in the TN PTB when compared to NHS. Similar to CD25 marker expression, the frequencies of CD4 + CD25 + T-cells (Fig. 3 c), CD4 + CD25 + CD39 + (Fig. 3 d), and CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 (Fig. 5 a) declined significantly on successful treatment completion in TC-fu ( p < 0.0001) when compared to TN PTB. When the levels of the above markers in TC-fu were compared with that of the levels in TC-nfu, there was no statistical difference ( p values for CD4 + CD25 + , CD4 + CD25 + CD39 + , and CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 subsets were 0.526, 0.821, and 0.459, respectively). Moreover, the level of the above subsets in NHS was found to be closer to the subset levels in TC-fu and TC-nfu.

Characteristics of the treatment failure patient (Tfp)
One of the TN-PTB who failed during treatment follow-up was initially (at 0 month i.e. at the time of recruitment) having lower bacillary load (1+) and opacities with cavities (based on chest X-ray findings). Symptomatology of Tfp is illustrated in Table 2 . Also, the frequency of CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 was observed to be higher at the time of recruitment compared to NHS, i.e., 0 month of treatment initiation. During the end of the 2nd month (at the end of intensive phase) of treatment follow-up, majority of the symptoms subsided along with sputum smear conversion. However, during the 4th month of treatment follow-up, the patient developed recurrence of all the baseline symptoms along with hemoptysis. In parallel, sputum smear turned out to be positive (later culture was also positive) and chest X-ray showed increase in opacities and cavitary lesions with a concomitant increase in the frequency of CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 Treg (Fig. 5 b).

A drastic increase (~ 2-fold when compared to 0 month) was observed in CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 frequency at the 4th month, concordant to the increase in MTB load (3+ at the time of failure) when compared to 0 month (1+).
Markers and cellular subset levels in different groups of sputum smear grade converters
An association was deduced between marker expression/cellular subset frequency and sputum smear grade status during 0 month and sixth month in both TC groups (TC-fu and TC-nfu). Here, we have classified both TN-PTB and TC-nfu as either high positives (those with sputum grade 3+ and 2+) or low positives (those with sputum grade 1+ and scanty) based on their sputum smear grade status at 0 month, i.e., before starting the treatment (Table 3 ). The pretreatment sputum smear status of 0 month for patients in TC-nfu was obtained retrospectively from the records managed at directly observed treatment, short-course (DOTS) center where they were registered (sputum for AFB culture is not done in the RNTCP). Of the 13 TN-PTB, only 11 were followed up till the end of treatment; thus, 6 patients were grouped as high positives and rest five were in low positives category based on their sputum smear status before treatment. Of the 10 TC-nfu, 5 were categorized into high positives and other five as low positives. Since the patients in TC-nfu were randomly recruited, at the time of completion of 6-month treatment, the data for expression profile of different markers and subsets is not available for the 0 month.

In the case of high positives, the frequencies of CD25 ( p < 0.0006) marker, CD4 + CD25 + ( p < 0.0012), CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 ( p < 0.003), and CD4 + CD25 + CD39 + ( p < 0.0012) Treg decline significantly with reference to TN PTB, along with the conversion of sputum smear grade (negativity) at the end of treatment in TC-fu. When comparing between TC-fu and TC-nfu, a significant difference was observed for the markers CD25, CD4+CD25+ but not for CD4+CD25+CD39+ and CD4+CD25+FoxP3 (the p values for CD25, CD4+CD25+, CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 and CD4 + CD25 + CD39 + subset were 0.004, 0.005, 0.428, and 0.429, respectively) (Fig. 6 a, b). Fig. 6 Expression of markers/cellular subsets in high positive sputum smear grade convertors at the end of treatment. a. Expression of (i) CD25 marker and (ii) CD4 + CD25 + T cells. b.

In the case of low positives sputum smear grade converters, the frequencies of CD25 ( p < 0.016) CD4 + CD25 + ( p < 0.015) T-cells, CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 ( p < 0.031), and CD4 + CD25 + CD39 + ( p < 0.015) Treg significantly decline when compared to TN-PTB, along with the conversion of sputum smear grade (negativity) at the end of treatment in TC-fu. When the levels of the above markers/subsets in TC-fu was compared with that of the levels of sputum smear converted TC-nfu, there was no statistical significant difference observed (the p values for CD25 marker and CD4 + CD25 + , CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3, and CD4 + CD25 + CD39 + subsets were 0.286, 0.623, 0.171, and 1.00, respectively) (Fig. 7 a, b). Thus, these markers/cellular subsets behave similarly in high and low positive patient groups. However, when the treatment completed groups were compared among themselves, both CD25+ and CD4+CD25+ showed significant differences in the high smear positive category. Other markers/subsets did not show significant differences in high and low positive sputum smear categories.

Discussion
Changes in T regulatory cells in TB patients were described for the first time before 12 years [ ]. Even though their peculiar expansion has been intensively studied during different pathological conditions (like cavitary TB [ , ], drug-resistant TB [ , , ], and extra-pulmonary TB [ , ]), there is no study revealing their role in determining TB treatment success or failure. Recently, in our own study, among the cocktail of various markers/cell subsets, we have demonstrated that certain CD4 + -derived subsets (CD25, CD4 + CD25 + , CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3, CD4 + CD25 + CD39 + ) were elevated in treatment-naive PTB which declined along with ATT (at different time points 0, 2, 4, and 6 months), suggesting that these marker/subsets holds a potential for predicting treatment efficacy [ ]. Taking a lead from that study, here, we have (a) once again validated the response of these potential markers/subsets in a separate group of new smear-positive pulmonary TB patients (TN-PTB— group 2) who were followed up till their treatment completion (TC-fu —group 3), (b) made blinded, real-time comparison between the levels of these markers or cell subsets in TC-fu (group 3) and TC-nfu (group 4) based on the significant differences observed between group 2 and group 3, and (c) investigated the response of these cellular subsets during treatment failure. Such studies of cellular markers for predicting TB treatment success or failure may be useful in aiding the clinical decision-making, as whether to continue/discontinue treatment in smear positive cases (as the positivity may not necessarily reflect the presence of live or dead bacilli).
When we followed a group of new smear-positive TB patients, we observed a significant decline in frequencies of CD25, CD4 + CD25 + , CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3, and CD4 + CD25 + CD39 + . These findings are in agreement with other existing reports on decrease in frequency of these subsets on completion of 6 months of ATT [ , , , , , ]. The change in frequency of these subsets on treatment completion highlights their relationship with MTB infection and its clearance. Once we confirmed the validation of the response of these subsets during treatment, we sought to compare the levels of these subsets between TC-fu and TC-nfu (randomly recruited from RNTCP). After statistical analysis, we found the levels to be same in both the groups indicating their possible role in predicting treatment success at the field level.
In one particular TN-PTB case which deteriorated clinically, bacteriologically, and radiologically (with increased number of opacity and cavitary lesions) during the fourth month of ATT, there was a concomitant increase in the frequency of CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 subset above the pretreatment level. This is in agreement with an earlier study which showed an association between cavitary TB and CD4+CD25+FoxP3 subset [ ]. A nearly 2-fold increase in CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 Treg frequency was observed in parallel with increase in MTB load to 3+. This exorbitant increase in frequency of Treg subset in treatment failure case in relation to rising bacillary load is indicative of Treg expansion on persistence of increased bacterial antigenic load [ ]. These findings suggest that CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 Treg subset may perform well in determining unresponsiveness to ATT.
Furthermore, in this study, we have showed an association between frequencies of Treg (CD25, CD4 + CD25 + , CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3, and CD4 + CD25 + CD39 + ) markers and bacterial load. At the time of recruitment, higher bacterial load in TN-PTB was associated with a higher frequency of Treg markers and vice versa. Irrespective of the bacterial load (whether low or high sputum pretreatment smear grades), there is a uniform decrease in levels of these markers/subsets during treatment as seen in group 3 (TC-fu). While considering high positives, significant difference was observed between TC-fu and TC-nfu groups for the markers CD25, CD4+CD25+ but not for CD4+CD25+CD39+ and CD4+CD25+FoxP3. This again validates the importance and stability of CD4+CD25+CD39+ and CD4+CD25+FoxP3 subsets in monitoring treatment success in high positive PTB individuals. When the levels of the above markers/subsets in TC-nfu group were analyzed, it showed levels similar to TC-fu, even though TC-nfu group had varying pretreatment smear grades. This again substantiates the usefulness of these markers in monitoring treatment success at the field level.
Till date, many host- and pathogen-based markers were evaluated for predicting treatment success but are not found to be promising. Our present study on screening of cellular markers adds to the current knowledge of markers for determining TB treatment success. The strength of the study is that stringent measures were taken to avoid observer bias. Hence, the markers studied here seem to be reliable in initiating further evaluation with a larger cohort in the field level. Our findings show that these markers might also be useful for predicting success as well as failure.
However, the role of these markers in predicting failure needs to be validated in a larger cohort which is currently being pursued by our study team in our centre along with the inclusion of other promising markers. In that study, the role of the promising markers in diagnosis will be analyzed using ROC curves to arrive at a conclusive decision on their true diagnostic utility, after correcting for regional TB prevalence. Such a promising marker, if used in a clinical scenario, will play a pivotal role in aiding the clinicians to decide about continuing the same regimen in case of clinical responders or choose a better regimen based on NAAT or drug susceptibility testing (DST) results in case of clinical non-responders. A promising marker will thus improve the overall efficiency of the TB control programme.
The outcome of the ongoing study might also shed light on the applicability of potential markers in being used as end points that could reduce the size and duration of newer anti-TB drug-based clinical trials. It will also be useful in determining treatment success in smear/culture-positive cases as well as in smear/culture-negative cases, extrapulmonary TB, and drug-resistant TB cases.
