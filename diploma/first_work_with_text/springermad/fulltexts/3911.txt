Introduction
Migraine is a common neurological condition with a 1-year prevalence of 10% in the general population. Moreover, 2% of the population has repeated bouts of migraine attack [ , ]. Headache is often accompanied by associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, or phonophobia [ ]. Current therapies of migraine center on treating acute episodes, but some aim to prevent future attacks. Triptans remain the mainstay of the current treatment options [ ]. However, newer treatment options are slowly becoming available [ ].
In the clinical development of migraine drugs, it is essential to have a reliable framework with which to evaluate drug effect. Migraine attacks are known to be highly variable, leading to a large number of patients being recruited in the late phase of clinical study. The design of clinical trials would be more efficient if we could simulate both the placebo and drug responses based on a well-defined model.
To address such demands, there have been efforts to develop a mathematical model of the time course of migraine attacks. Some of these efforts have culminated in plausible mechanistic models that integrate various aspects of the disease—beginning from the predisposition to neuronal excitability and a wave of depolarizing activity [ ]. However, highly mechanistic models of such nature often are too complex to be applied to clinical trials.
When the objective of the model is mainly in an accurate prediction of the time trend, it often suffices to use an empirical modeling approach. A conventional approach to modeling categorical variables is the proportional odds model [ ], initially used for analyzing survival data [ ] and extended to other types of analysis including multivariate analysis [ ] and interval-censored failure time analysis [ ]. In migraine, the autoregressive ordered probit (AOP) model accounting for the dependency of migraine severity at the present time on that at the previous time has been reported [ ].
The biggest problem in applying the traditional modeling methods would be in the multidimensional nature of the migraine symptoms, typically consisting of headache, nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia as mentioned above. However, treating each symptom dimension as if it were independent of other dimensions ignores the possibility of a common underlying disease process. Therefore, to appropriately capture the time course of migraine symptoms, correlations among different symptom dimensions must be accounted for.
A full-blown physiological model that incorporates mechanistic links between different symptoms, however, would require information of physiological parameters that are often difficult to acquire. Moreover, the pathophysiology of migraine is not fully understood as yet. A compromise is needed between an empirical curve-fitting model and a mechanistic model that takes into account the exact biological mechanisms.
Recently, there is increasing interest in applying item response theory (IRT), originally developed and utilized in psychometric research, in clinical assessment [ ]. IRT is an efficient modeling framework when dealing with the analysis and scoring of tests consisting of multiple items [ ], which share a common underlying trait [ ], and can be a choice in this case where the analysis variable consists of multiple endpoints. Assuming different difficulty levels for each item, IRT theory represents any informative measurement on a discrete scale such as symptoms scored as present/absent as the term item [ ]. It has been successfully applied in modeling alcohol [ ] and opioid [ ] dependencies, depression [ ], dementia/Alzheimer’s disease [ , , , ], Parkinson’s disease [ , ], amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [ ], and multiple sclerosis [ ]. As for migraine, IRT was reported as being useful for analyzing the Migraine Specific Questionnaire (MSQ) [ ].
As an extension to the above line of research, this study aims to develop an integrated model of the severity score of migraine headache and the incidence of nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia given a placebo treatment under the IRT framework and compare with the conventional approach. The model will then be used to perform clinical trial simulations to explore the effects of different sample sizes, drug effect sizes, and the choice of primary efficacy endpoints.
Materials and methods
Data
The data was acquired from two clinical studies (160-103 and 160-318) performed by Pfizer during the development of eletriptan [ ], which was approved by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on December 26, 2002, for the acute treatment of migraine.
Study 160-103 was a randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo controlled comparison of two doses of oral eletriptan (40 and 80 mg) and placebo. Male and female migraineurs with at least 1 migraine attack (with or without aura) approximately every 6 weeks participated in the study. The study medication was taken within 6 h of the onset of headache. Study 160-318 is a similar study with a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design aimed to compare oral eletriptan (40 and 80 mg) and oral sumatriptan (50 and 100 mg). Study 160-103 recorded up to two migraine attacks and Study 160-318 up to three attacks after the study began. The primary efficacy endpoint used in both trials was the response rates of placebo and treatment arms assessed at 2 h post-dose.
The data used for pharmacodynamic (PD) modeling in our analysis were only taken from the placebo arm of the two studies, consisting of 288 subjects (99 in 160-103 and 189 in 160-318). The clinical endpoints to be modeled were the severity of headache pain and the presence of nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia. These endpoints were self-reported by the patients at pre-specified time points after each attack, which were 0 (at dosing), 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 24 h after dose. Some of the actual reported time points, however, deviated slightly from these planned time points. Table 1 shows demographics and clinical characteristics of the study subjects. Table 1 Demographics and clinical characteristics of the study subjects Characteristic Distribution Age [years] (median, range) 40 (18–65) Female sex (n, %) 261 (90.6%) Body weight [kg] (mean ± SD) 68.0 ± 13.7 Race (n, %) White 277 (96.2%) Black 4 (1.4%) Asian 2 (0.7%) Others 5 (1.7%) Menstruation onset (n, %) Not coincided with attack 172 (59.7%) Coincided with attack 59 (20.5%) Not applicable (males) 48 (16.7%) Missing 9 (3.1%) Aura (n, %) Migraine without aura 178 (61.8%) Migraine with aura 34 (11.8%) Migraine with and without aura 76 (26.4%) Previously used sumatriptan (n, %) No 218 (75.7%) Yes, but not responsive 10 (3.5%) Yes, responsive but recurs 25 (8.7%) Yes, responsive and no recur 35 (12.1%) Serum creatinine [umol/L] (mean ± SD) 0.85 ± 0.15 Total bilirubin [mmol/L] (mean ± SD) 0.50 ± 0.22 AST (SGOT) [IU/L] (mean ± SD) 20.45 ± 7.35 ALT (SGPT) [IU/L] (mean ± SD) 20.45 ± 12.77 Alkaline phosphatase [IU/L] (mean ± SD) 86.95 ± 43.16
The severity of headache was categorized into 4 headache pain scores (0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe) with the headache onset time defined as the time when the patient first experienced headache with pain score ≥ 2. Some patients (N = 3) reported pain scores < 2 at the headache onset time, so these patients were excluded from the analysis. While the individual time course of pain score transitions was highly random, there was an overall tendency of decreasing proportion of moderate to severe pain over time as seen in Fig. 1 (dots in the upper left panel). Similar time trend was seen for multiple binary endpoints of nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia (see dots in the upper right and lower panels in Fig. 1 ) Fig. 1 Evaluation of the IRT-based model using a visual predictive check (n = 1000) where dots denote observations and shaded area represent 95% prediction intervals
In study 160-103, the study period was the time required for the treatment of 2 attacks or 3 months from randomization, whichever occurred first, and in study 160-318 it was the time required for the treatment of 3 attacks or 3 months from randomization, whichever occurred first. Each episode of migraine attack was defined as a single occasion. Therefore, for study 160-103, there were maximum of two occasions per individual while for study 160-318, there were maximum of three occasions per individual.
Model building
Item response theory based modeling approach
According to IRT, in the case of 2-parameter logit (PL) item characteristic function (ICF), the probability of headache score greater or equal to k was represented as $${\text{P}}\left( { Y_{H} \ge k} \right) = \frac{1}{{1 + \exp ( - a_{H} \cdot (D - b_{H,k} ))}}, \;\;\;\;k = 1, 2, 3$$ (1) and the incidence probability of nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia as: $${\text{P}}\left( { Y_{N} } \right) = \frac{1}{{1 + \exp ( - a_{N} \cdot \left( {D - b_{N} } \right))}}$$ (2) $${\text{P}}\left( { Y_{PT} } \right) = \frac{1}{{1 + \exp ( - a_{PT} \cdot \left( {D - b_{PT} } \right))}}$$ (3) $$P\left( { Y_{PN} } \right) = \frac{1}{{1 + \exp ( - a_{PN} \cdot \left( {D - b_{PN} } \right))}}$$ (4)
In Eq. ( 1 ), P is the probability, Y H the headache pain score, k the category, a H the slope or scale parameter denoting the discrimination power, quantifying the capability to discern patients’ ability ( a H > 0), and b H , k the location or threshold parameter denoting the item difficulty \(\left( {b_{H,k} \ge b_{H,k - 1} } \right)\) . \({\text{P}}\left( { Y_{H} = k} \right)\) is then calculated by the difference of two cumulative probabilities as follows: $${\text{P}}\left( { Y_{H} = 0} \right) = 1 - {\text{P}}\left( { Y_{H} \ge 1} \right)$$ $${\text{P}}\left( { Y_{H} = 1} \right) = {\text{P}}\left( { Y_{H} \ge 1} \right) - {\text{P}}\left( { Y_{H} \ge 2} \right)$$ $${\text{P}}\left( { Y_{H} = 2} \right) = {\text{P}}\left( { Y_{H} \ge 2} \right) - {\text{P}}\left( { Y_{H} \ge 3} \right)$$ $${\text{P}}\left( { Y_{H} = 3} \right) = {\text{P}}\left( { Y_{H} \ge 3} \right)$$
Similarly, in Eqs. ( 2 )–( 4 ), P is the probability, Y N , Y PT , and Y PN , the incidence of nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia, respectively, a N , a PT , and a PN the discrimination parameter of nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia, respectively ( a N , a PT , a PN > 0), and b N , b PT , and b PN the difficulty parameter ( b N , b PT , b PN > 0). In Eqs. ( 1 )–( 4 ), D is the longitudinal change of latent disease severity common to all items (i.e., headache severity and nausea, photophobia and phonophobia incidences), which is described as below: $$D = D_{0} - \lambda \cdot t$$ (5) where D 0 is the initial value of \(D\) at t = 0. Since migraine symptoms are self-limited, it is assumed that disease severity decreases over time with slope of λ (> 0) in Eq. ( 5 ), which denotes the symptom relief rate common to all symptoms.The actual symptom relief rates were obtained from the following equations, which were derived by substituting Eq. ( 5 ) into Eqs. ( 1 )–( 4 ): $${\text{P}}\left( { Y_{H} \ge k} \right) = \frac{1}{{1 + \exp \left( { - \left( {a_{H} \cdot \left( {D_{0} - b_{H,k} } \right) - a_{H} \cdot \lambda \cdot t} \right)} \right)}},\;\;\;\;k = 1, 2, 3$$ (6) $${\text{P}}\left( { Y_{N} } \right) = \frac{1}{{1 + \exp \left( { - \left( {a_{N} \cdot \left( {D_{0} - b_{N} } \right) - a_{N} \cdot \lambda \cdot t} \right)} \right)}}$$ (7) $${\text{P}}\left( { Y_{PT} } \right) = \frac{1}{{1 + \exp \left( { - \left( {a_{PT} \cdot \left( {D_{0} - b_{PT} } \right) - a_{PT} \cdot \lambda \cdot t} \right)} \right)}}$$ (8) $${\text{P}}\left( { Y_{PN} } \right) = \frac{1}{{1 + \exp \left( { - \left( {a_{PN} \cdot \left( {D_{0} - b_{PN} } \right) - a_{PN} \cdot \lambda \cdot t} \right)} \right)}}$$ (9) Equation ( 6 )–( 9 ) shows that \(a_{H} \cdot \lambda\) , \(a_{N} \cdot \lambda\) , \(a_{PT} \cdot \lambda\) , and \(a_{PN} \cdot \lambda\) correspond to the apparent symptom relief rates.
Inter-individual and inter-occasion random effects were incorporated into IRT model parameters as follows: $$D_{0,i} = D_{0} + \eta_{{D_{0,i} }}$$ (10) $$b_{H,i} = b_{H} + \eta_{H,i} + \eta_{H,i1} + \eta_{H,i2} + \eta_{H,i3}$$ (11) $$b_{N,i} = b_{N} + \eta_{N,i} + \eta_{N,i1} + \eta_{N,i2} + \eta_{N,i3}$$ (12) $$b_{PT,i} = b_{PT} + \eta_{PT,i} + \eta_{PT,i1} + \eta_{PT,i2} + \eta_{PT,i3}$$ (13) $$b_{PN,i} = b_{PN} + \eta_{PN,i} + \eta_{PN,i1} + \eta_{PN,i2} + \eta_{PN,i3}$$ (14) $$\lambda_{i} = \lambda + \eta_{\lambda ,i} + \eta_{\lambda ,i1} + \eta_{\lambda ,i2} + \eta_{\lambda ,i3}$$ (15) where subscript i denotes the i -th individual value of parameter, \(\eta_{{D_{0,i} }}\) , η H , i , η N , i , η PT , i , η PN , i , and η λ , i are inter-individual random effects, and η H , ij , η N , ij , η PT , ij , η PN , ij , and η λ , ij are j -th inter-occasion random effects for j = 1, 2, 3. In Eq. ( 10 ), D 0 and var \(\left( {\eta_{{D_{0} ,i}} } \right)\) were fixed at 0 and 1, respectively, and in Eqs. ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) each of inter-individual (IIV) and inter-occasion variability (IOV) was assumed to common to b PT , i and b PN , i (i.e., the variance of η PT , i was assumed to be the same as that of η PN , i , and the variances of η PT , ij and η PN , ij were assumed to be the same).
While the majority of IIV is believed to stem from differences in the underlying disease severity ( D 0, i ), individuals can differ in their discrimination and difficulty levels as well. We have thus incorporated both IIV and IOV into all the model parameters (i.e., disease severity, discrimination, and difficulty).
Conventional modeling approach
To evaluate the performance and usefulness of the IRT-based modeling approach, we compared it with the conventional method of modeling each end point separately based on the proportional odds model for headache severity and the logistic regression model for nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia incidences with time.
The proportional odds model is similar to the above-mentioned IRT based approach in that logit is a function of the severity-specific constant (which is similar to the difficulty level) and time-varying terms. What sets it apart from the IRT-based model is that there is no latent variable linking all the symptoms.
For the headache pain score, similarly to IRT-based model, the following model structure was used. $${\text{P}}\left( { Y_{H} \ge k} \right) = \frac{1}{{1 + \exp \left( { - \left( {\beta_{H,k} - \gamma_{H} \cdot t} \right)} \right)}},\;\;\;\;k = 1, 2, 3$$ (16) where \(\beta_{H,k} - \gamma_{H} \cdot t\) is the logit, with \(\beta_{H,k}\) being the baseline logit with β H , k ≤ β H , k −1 and \(- \gamma_{H} \cdot t\) denoting a self-limiting nature of pain progression. Then, the incidence of multiple binary endpoints was modeled as follows. $${\text{P}}\left( { Y_{N} } \right) = \frac{1}{{1 + \exp \left( { - \left( {\beta_{N} - \gamma_{N} \cdot t} \right)} \right)}}$$ (17) $${\text{P}}\left( {Y_{PT} } \right) = \frac{1}{{1 + \exp \left( { - \left( {\beta_{PT} - \gamma_{PT} \cdot t} \right)} \right)}}$$ (18) $${\text{P}}\left( {Y_{PN} } \right) = \frac{1}{{1 + \exp \left( { - \left( {\beta_{PN} - \gamma_{PN} \cdot t} \right)} \right)}}$$ (19) where γ PT and γ PN were assumed to be the same. With inter-individual and inter-occasion random effects being incorporated in logit ( β H , β N , β PT , and β PN ) and the symptom relief rates ( γ H , γ N , γ PT , and γ PN ), IIV and IOV of symptom relief rates were set identical among the symptoms so that the variability structure is the same as that of the IRT-based model and the reliable model comparison can be made. Note from \(a_{H} \cdot \lambda\) , \(a_{N} \cdot \lambda\) , \(a_{PT} \cdot \lambda\) , and \(a_{PN} \cdot \lambda\) in Eqs. ( 6 )–( 9 ) and λ i in Eq. ( 15 ) that in the IRT-based model there exists a common factor λ and therefore IIV and IOV of the apparent symptom relief rate are shared among the 4 endpoints.
Covariate selection
For the IRT-based model, age, gender, and weight were tested for their potential influences on the rate of symptom relief ( λ ), initial level of latent disease severity ( D 0 ), discrimination ( a ), and difficulty ( b ). Based on the likelihood ratio test, covariate selection was done with the criteria of p < 0.05 for forward addition and p < 0.01 for backward deletion.
Model evaluation
Visual predictive check (VPC) with 1000 simulated datasets was performed. For each of the 4 endpoints (the severity of headache and the incidence of nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia), a random number between 0 and 1 was generated from a uniform distribution and compared with the predicted cumulative probability (for the severity) or the predicted probability (for the incidence), including it in counts of occurrence if the probability was bigger than the random number. It was then graphically assessed whether majority of the observations fell within 95% prediction intervals.
Simulations
Using the model developed, clinical trial simulations were undertaken 100 times for each of the total 16 (= 4 × 4) scenarios: (i) sample sizes of 50, 100, 200, and 300 per treatment arm and (ii) hypothetical drug effect of 0% (placebo), 10, 20, and 40% linearly related to the rate of symptom relief as in the following equation $$\lambda = \lambda_{0} \cdot \left( {1 + {\text{Eff}}} \right)$$ (20) where λ 0 is the rate of pain relief when no drug is present (Eff = 0) and Eff (= 0.1, 0.2, 0.4) is the drug effect.
Pain score less than or equal to 2 was defined as a ‘response’, based on the definition given in the eletriptan development protocol. The proportion of patients who responded was calculated for each simulation, leading to a distribution of response probabilities. Then, for response probabilities at 0 (pre-dose), 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 24 h post-dose between placebo and treatment arms, the statistical power of the model at each time point was obtained at the significance level of 5% as the proportion of simulated datasets with the treatment-arm response probability greater than the 95 th percentile of the distribution of placebo-arm response probabilities at the corresponding time point.
Software used
All model parameters were estimated using NONMEM software version 7.3. R (RStudio) and MATLAB R2013a were used for data exploration, manipulation, and simulation.
Results
IRT based modeling approach
Out of the widely used 1-, 2-, and 3-PL ICFs, 1-PL ICF was not a candidate because this ICF assumed a unit(= 1) value for all the discrimination parameters. 3-PL ICF was also not a choice because it assumed the inclusion of a control group (i.e., subjects with no migraine symptoms) whereas all subjects in our data were migraine patients. Accordingly, the IRT model was built using a 2-PL ICF. The estimation result of the model is shown in Table 2 . Table 2 Estimated parameters (relative standard errors %) of the final IRT-based model Parameter Symbol Estimate (RSE %) Structural parameter Baseline disease severity \(\varvec{D}_{0}\) 0 FIX Headache discrimination \(\varvec{a}_{\varvec{H}}\) 1.33 (11.88%) Headache difficulty (pain score = 1) \(\varvec{b}_{{\varvec{H},1}}\) − 5.29 (10.24%) Headache additional difficulty (pain score = 2) \(\varvec{b}_{{\varvec{H},2}} - \varvec{b}_{{\varvec{H},1}}\) 2.59 (13.06%) Headache additional difficulty (pain score = 3) \(\varvec{b}_{{\varvec{H},3}} - \varvec{b}_{{\varvec{H},2}}\) 2.96 (9.72%) Symptom relief rate [h −1 ] \(\varvec{\lambda}\) 0.59 (13.17%) Nausea discrimination \(\varvec{a}_{\varvec{N}}\) 1.84 (15.04%) Nausea difficulty \(\varvec{b}_{\varvec{N}}\) − 0.60 (26.99%) Photophobia discrimination \(\varvec{a}_{{\varvec{PT}}}\) 3.37 (18.48%) Photophobia difficulty \(\varvec{b}_{{\varvec{PT}}}\) − 1.81 (15.52%) Phonophobia discrimination \(\varvec{a}_{{\varvec{PN}}}\) 5.54 (21.17%) Phonophobia difficulty \(\varvec{b}_{{\varvec{PN}}}\) − 1.58 (15.23%) Variance parameter \({\mathbf{IIV}}\; \, {\mathbf{in}}\;\varvec{D}_{0}\) 1 FIX \({\mathbf{IIV}}\; \, {\mathbf{in}}\;\varvec{\lambda}\) 0.45 (27.24%) \({\mathbf{IOV}}\; \, {\mathbf{in}}\;\varvec{\lambda}\) 0.52 (23.22%) \({\mathbf{IIV}}\;{\mathbf{in}}\;\varvec{b}_{\varvec{H}}\) 0.40 (65.26%) \({\mathbf{IOV}}\;{\mathbf{in}}\,\varvec{b}_{\varvec{H}}\) 0.92 (14.73%) \({\mathbf{IIV}}\;{\mathbf{in}}\;\varvec{b}_{\varvec{N}}\) 1.07 (27.74%) \({\mathbf{IOV}}\;{\mathbf{in}}\;\varvec{b}_{\varvec{N}}\) 1.23 (19.22%) \({\mathbf{IIV}}\;{\mathbf{in}}\;\varvec{b}_{{\varvec{PT}/\varvec{PN}}}\) 1.56 (22.46%) \({\mathbf{IOV}}\;{\mathbf{in}}\;\varvec{b}_{{\varvec{PT}/\varvec{PN}}}\) 0.80 (23.08%) RSE relative standard error
The estimate of the common symptom relief rate ( λ ) was 0.59 h −1 and the estimated discrimination parameters for headache, nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia score were a H = 1.33, a N = 1.84, a PT = 3.37, and a PN = 5.54 on the logit scale. The actual symptom relief rates [h −1 ] were \(a_{H} \cdot \lambda = 0.79\) , \(a_{N} \cdot \lambda = 1.09\) , \(a_{PT} \cdot \lambda = 1.99\) , and \(a_{PN} \cdot \lambda = 3.27\) (see Eqs. ( 6 )–( 9 )), indicating the symptom relief rate is the fastest in phonophobia and the slowest in headache.
The threshold level of pain score Y H ≥ 1 was − 5.29 on the logit scale, with successive increments of 2.59 and 2.96 leading to the threshold levels of − 2.7 and 0.26 for pain score 2 and 3. The threshold levels were − 0.60 for nausea, − 1.81 for photophobia, and − 1.58 for phonophobia. Noting that in Eqs. ( 6 )–( 9 ) \(a_{H} \cdot (D_{0} - b_{H,k} )\) , \(a_{N} \cdot (D_{0} - b_{N} )\) , \(a_{PT} \cdot (D_{0} - b_{PT} )\) , and \(a_{PN} \cdot (D_{0} - b_{PN} )\) correspond to the apparent baseline logit of headache, nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia, respectively, substituting the estimates of discrimination and threshold parameters, the apparent baseline logits of headache were obtained as 7.04, 3.59, − 0.35 for k = 1, 2, 3 and 1.10 for nausea, 6.10 for photophobia, and 8.75 for phonophobia.
IIV of the threshold levels were 0.40 for headache, 1.07 for nausea, and 1.56 for photophobia/phonophobia in standard deviation (SD) units. IOV for the same parameters were 0.92, 1.23, and 0.80 in SD units. This suggests that there is as much inter-occasional variability as there is between different individuals. IIV of the common symptom relief rate was 0.45, while IOV was 0.52 h −1 in SD units.
Covariate selection
The covariate selection results suggested that there is a slight difference of symptom relief rates between males and females. However, this difference was not entirely consistent in that rate of nausea relief was faster in females while rates of headache and photophobia/phonophobia relief were slower. Age, menstrual status, and presence of aura do not seem to affect the time course of a migraine attack to any significant degree. Somewhat puzzling was the finding of concomitant menstruation being associated with a higher difficulty level of nausea. Due to the discrepancy with the firmly established fact that menstruation tends to exacerbate the symptoms, our decision was to not include this covariate in the final model. Accordingly, no covariate was selected at p < 0.01.
Model evaluation
The VPC of the developed model reported in Fig. 1 shows that most observed proportions were within 95% prediction intervals, indicating a good agreement between the prediction and the observation, where the predictions at times other than the pre-specified time points of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 24 h were plotted by linearly interpolating the predictions at these time points. The figure also shows that observed proportion decrease with time is the fastest in phonophobia and the slowest in headache, consistent with the estimated trend of the symptom relief rate reported above.
Conventional modeling approach
Parameter estimates of the conventional model developed are summarized in Table 3 . The estimated rates of symptom relief [h −1 ] were 1.10 for headache, 1.14 for nausea, and 1.15 for photophobia/phonophobia, and baseline logits were estimated as 8.99 for β H ,1 , 4.25 (= 8.99–4.74) for β H ,2 , and − 0.28 (= 4.25–4.53) for β H ,3 and 1.18 for β N , 4.24 for β PT , and 3.84 for β PN .

IIV of baseline logits were 1.49 for headache, 2.72 for nausea, and 4.37 for photophobia/phonophobia, and IOV were 1.52 for headache, 2.14 for nausea, and 1.90 for photophobia/phonophobia, all in SD units. IIV associated with symptom relief rate was 0.95, while IOV was 1.03 h −1 in SD units.
Similar to the IRT-based model, no covariate was selected, and the VPC of the model is displayed in Fig. 2 , visually showing the similar model performance as compared with the IRT-based model.

The AIC of the IRT-based model compared to the conventional model was much lower (6722.85 vs. 6904.82), suggesting the superiority of the IRT-based model.
As compared with the apparent symptom relief rates and the apparent baseline logits obtained with IRT based modeling, the symptom relief rates were similar among different symptoms, which is different from IRT based modeling, and the baseline logits were somewhat larger in β H ,2 and β H ,3 and smaller in β PT and β PN .
Clinical trial simulations
Figure 3 shows simulated mean response probabilities versus time for different effect sizes, where the mean response probability was obtained as the typical value of \({\text{P}}\left( { Y_{H} \le 2} \right)\;\;\left( { = 1 - {\text{P}}\left( {Y_{H} \ge 3} \right)} \right)\) from Eq. ( 6 ) with ETA = 0. It can be seen that the difference in response probabilities is maximal at 4 h post-dose. This suggests that using the response probability at 4 h post-dose as a primary end-point would lead to the highest statistical power of proving the drug effect given that our assumption of a linear drug effect on the rate of symptom relief in Eq. ( 20 ) is plausible. Table 4 shows the results of the statistical power of the IRT-based model for different sample and effect sizes. Indeed, when assessed at 4 h post-dose assuming 40% drug effect, a sample size of 100 per treatment arm leads to a power of 100% compared to 57% when assessed at 2 h post-dose. To stably achieve greater than 80% power at the 5% type I error rate, at least 20% drug effect with greater than 200 subjects seem to be needed.

Discussion
IRT framework is used for analyzing test scores consisting of multiple items. It allows an inference of the test-taker’s general ability, which is unobservable from scores of multiple test items. A classic example would be an inference of an individual’s intelligence quotient (IQ) based on test scores of multiple subjects (e.g. English, mathematics, and etc.). Similarly, in a typical migraine attack, it is possible that an unobserved disease process gives rise to the observed scores of various symptoms such as headache, nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia. A conventional modeling approach that treats these different symptom dimensions as independent does not take into account the correlations among them.
In this paper, we have successfully built an integrated model of different migraine symptoms under an IRT framework. The results were then compared with those based on the conventional approach. Other than much improvement in model fit as judged by the AIC decrease, the key difference between the 2 modeling approaches was that while in IRT-based modeling the symptom relief rate was estimated to be the fastest in phonophobia and the slowest in headache, there was almost no difference among the symptoms in conventional modeling.
Such differences in model performance and resulting parameter estimates are associated with the nature of the IRT-based model which identified an additional structure governing the relationships among different symptom dimensions. Comparing Eqs. ( 6 ) and ( 16 ), ( 7 ) and ( 17 ), ( 8 ) and ( 18 ), and ( 9 ) and ( 19 ), the IRT-based model parameters were related with the conventional model parameters as follows: $$a_{H} \cdot (D_{0} - b_{H,k} ) \to \beta_{H,k} \; {\text{and}}\;a_{H} \cdot \lambda \to \gamma_{H}$$ $$a_{N} \cdot (D_{0} - b_{N} ) \to \beta_{N} \;{\text{and}}\;a_{N} \cdot \lambda \to \gamma_{N}$$ $$a_{PT} \cdot (D_{0} - b_{PT} ) \to \beta_{PT} \;{\text{and}} \; a_{PT} \cdot \lambda \to \gamma_{PT}$$ $$a_{PN} \cdot (D_{0} - b_{PN} ) \to \beta_{PN} \;{\text{and}}\;a_{PN} \cdot \lambda \to \gamma_{PN}$$
The above relationships show that λ is modulated by the scale parameter ( a H , a N , a PT , a PN ) whereas D 0 is modulated not only by the scale parameter but also by the location parameter ( b H , k , b N , b PT , b PN ). Thus, the important feature of the IRT-based model is that while in conventional modeling the structural parameters associated with disease progression of each migraine symptom (i.e., γ H , γ N , γ PT , and γ PN ) are modeled independently of the other symptoms, in IRT-based modeling disease progression is assumed to be common to all symptoms via D 0 and λ , with the baseline ( D 0 ) and the rate of the progression ( λ ) being modulated by scale ( a H , a N , a PT , a PN ) and location parameters ( b H , k , b N , b PT , b PN ) of the IRT model for that symptom, thereby being influenced by common underlying features among the symptoms while allowing for inter-symptom differences in disease progression.
However, as the IRT model adds a structural parameter λ that represents a common extent of disease progression among all the symptoms, it can render the structural model over-parameterized. In our case, because of the interplay between the structural and covariance components of the model, the more richly parameterized IRT model was identifiable and, per the AIC, provided the better fit.
Regarding the individual time course of pain score transitions mentioned in the Methods section, we also tested a continuous-time Markov model. However, it gave rise to a much larger OFV compared with the conventional modeling approach as well as the IRT-based modeling approach. Accordingly, we did not specify it as an approach to be compared.
Based on the IRT-based modeling results, photophobia and phonophobia were found to be more sensitive to changes in the latent variable, as shown by their high estimates of the discrimination parameters. The predicted order of appearance of symptoms with increasing values of the baseline disease severity enables direct comparison of different symptoms based on a common scale. For example, since nausea with the apparent baseline logit of 1.10 immediately precedes headache score of 3 with that of − 0.35, the presence of nausea can be interpreted as a result of high underlying disease intensity.
The variance estimates indicate that the magnitude of inter-occasion variability is similar in its scale to that of inter-individual variability. This suggests that migraine is inherently a highly stochastic process, showing much variability between episodes within a patient. For item-specific parameters, we first considered using only fixed effect parameters. However, adding IIV + IOV to item parameters improved the model fit considerably. We regarded this as reflecting that, in addition to differences in the underlying disease severity, individuals can differ in their discrimination and difficulty levels as well, which was used as a basis for formulating item parameters in the Method section. Similar to our approach, allowing for individual differences in item-specific parameters through covariates incorporated are found in [ , ].
A linear time function was applied to disease progression in both the IRT-based model and the conventional proportional odds model. For exploratory purposes, we have tried a number of nonlinear functions such as asymptotic exponential and logistic functions to describe the time-varying nature of disease progression. However, none of them yielded a significantly better fit to our data. Hence, we chose to finalize with the linear model.
The simulations based on our model show that, due to both large inter-individual and inter-occasion variability, a sample size of 200 per treatment arm and 40% effect size would be needed to achieve statistical power greater than 80% if the response is to be judged at 2 h after dosing. On the other hand, if drug effect is assessed at 4 h after dose, a sample size of 100 and an effect size of 40% or a sample size of 200 and an effect size of 20% seems adequate to achieve statistical power greater than 80%. This shows how clinical trial simulation can provide information regarding the choice of primary efficacy endpoint and the required sample size at each effect size level. While these simulation results should be taken with caution as it is based on an extra assumption of a linear drug effect on the symptom relief rate, it does show that costs can be reduced by a clever use of mathematical modeling and simulations. If our simulation results are close to reality, the costs associated with patient recruitment and management could be reduced twofold (N = 100 vs. 200) by defining the response rate at 4 h post-dose as a primary efficacy endpoint as opposed to 2 h post-dose as was defined in the eletriptan development protocol. Obviously, clinical endpoints cannot be selected based on statistical power alone. Yet, in cases where limited flexibility can be exercised, sponsors could make better decisions by performing clinical trial simulations of a similar nature.
Conclusions
This work successfully modeled the time course of placebo response in a typical migraine attack using both the conventional proportional odds modeling approach and the IRT-based approach, with the latter providing several additional benefits. By linking a common underlying mechanism to different clinical endpoints—headache, nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia, direct comparison of different symptom dimensions and an inference of the underlying disease intensity were possible. Our model is expected to provide an impetus to extending the IRT framework to modeling migraine trials and simulating them with the purpose of acquiring adequate sample size and optimal statistical power. It can be similarly applied to quantitative assessment of other types of multiple endpoints with a common underlying disease mechanism.
