Introduction
Many studies have indicated the importance of psychosocial factors among cancer patients, which is caused by its high prevalence, its effect on women of all ages, and great significance of its part to women and their patients [ ]. The range and severity of distress experienced following a diagnosis of cancer vary from patient to patient. Shock, disbelief, sadness, fear, anxiety, guilt, shame, and anger in significant levels of those are found in more than 35 % of patients [ ]. A recent meta-analysis of studies considering the prevalence of mood disorders among cancer patients in oncological and hematological settings reported 12.9–29.8 % of patients experienced depression, and 5.1–17 % experienced anxiety [ ]. Even in the months and years following diagnosis and treatment, patients can still experience significant distress [ ]. This distress can impact negatively on a patient’s perceived quality of life, including their emotional and functional well-being [ ].
Meta-analytic studies on the effects of psychological treatment for adults diagnosed with cancer provide strong evidence for the beneficial effects of intervention in reducing distress and improving well-being [ ]. For example, cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) has been tried and found helpful for depression, anxiety, and quality of life in cancer patients, with large effect sizes obtained [ ]. Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is only an intervention that focuses on changing the content of the thoughts [ ]. Patients learn to have difficult thoughts and feelings without being characterized by them. They also learn to choose actions that are consistent with what they care about. ACT focuses on reducing symptoms. It aims to establish, develop psychological flexibility to enable a person to act effectively with their distressing symptoms through the use of acceptance strategies, mindfulness techniques, and a wide range of behavioral approaches. ACT receives the support from a growing body of literature indicating that attempts to suppress negative thoughts and feelings [ , ] as well as avoidant coping styles [ , , , ] which leads actually make psychological problems worse over time. Furthermore, it has been argued that psychological flexibility may be a critical aspect to improve psychological health [ ].
Many international hospitals prefer the ACT for a variety of chronic health conditions including chronic pain [ , ] psychosis [ , ], polysubstance addiction [ ], and nicotine addiction [ ] . In addition, it has been found to be an effective treatment for depression [ , ] and anxiety [ , ] both of which are highly prevalent among cancer patients. ACT has also demonstrated positive outcomes for cancer patients. In a randomized controlled trial, results showed a higher positive impact on mood and quality of life among six breast cancer patients following an ACT-based intervention compared with a cognitive-based control intervention, when long-term changes were considered at a 12-month follow-up [ ]. Branstetter et al. [ ] suggested that ACT is more helpful than CBT in dealing with the end stage of cancer issues. These positive findings and a dearth of further research into effective for cancer patients highlight a need for examining ACT as an intervention for cancer patients experiencing distress.
The objectives of this study are to identify the perception of the impact of the ACT through decreasing stress on patient referral and to determine whether there was any association between demographic factors and participants of psychological intervention.
Measure
Perceived Stress
The Perceived Stress Scale, a self- report thermometer and commonly employed as a screening tool for distress among cancer patients. In this scale, patients were asked to rate the degree of distress they have experienced in the previous week. There is a 10-item measuring psychological stress level rating made on a five-point scale of never = 0 to very often = 4. [ ].
Quality of Life
The Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS) questionnaire is a well-being thermometer among cancer patients. There are nine different types of questions were pointed from none of the time = 1 to all of the time = 5. Their type of questions is regarding what a patient thinks regarding their quality of life [ ].
Meaning of Life
Meaning of Life Questionnaire consists of ten items which are rated on a seven-point scale from absolute untrue = 1, mostly untrue = 2, somewhat true = 3, cannot say true or false = 4, somewhat true = 4, mostly true = 6, absolutely true = 7. The range of scores obtained for the presence =1, 4, 5, 6, and 9—reverse coded on the other side search = 2,3,7,8, and 10 [ ].
Acceptance
The Acceptance and Action Questionnaire II (AAQ-II) is a 10-item instrument measuring psychological flexibility, obtained through ratings of acceptance or avoidance of unpleasant thoughts and feelings. Items are rated on a seven-point scale from 0 = never true to 7 = always true. The AAQ-II had satisfactory reliability (pre = .82, mid = .78, post = .87, follow-up = .78 [ ]).
Intervention
It was observed that most of the patients during the period of treatment suffered as a result from excessive stress and hopelessness. Day to day deterioration of health and economic problem is also a reason of stress. On the other side, when a patient listens that he or she is a cancer patient, two things play in his or her mind, firstly, everything is out of hand and the other concern is that death is coming to the door. It is expected to be very tough for them to accept the disease and fight against it. To overcome this situation and give them a mental support, two types of therapies were applied, one is ACT and the other is stress management. Acceptance, patients would be supported by acknowledging and experiencing all aspects of their current situation, whether physical or emotional, and regardless of social pressures and desirability. It also encourages an open experience of the environment and psychological phenomena, whether perceived as good or bad [ ]. This therapy was emphasized on focusing on positive thinking, getting spirit approaches, patients should be permitted to experience and articulate all aspects, including the negative and distressing. While stress management is essential during treatment sessions because patients have to face many challenging situations which may lead to stress and may also affect them physically. So, by the above-said management plan, they may have some relief. Researchers introduced psychotherapy as a training session individually. The total procedure was about nine sessions, and each has taken 40–45 min with a 15-day interval. Rapport establishes and introduces the importance of psychological intervention—1 session Assessment of psychological baseline 1 session Stress Management 2 sessions ACT 4 sessions Reassessment of psychological baseline—1 session
The time period of total intervention was about 4 months, 2 months for stress management and 2 months for ACT. Psychological baseline had taken before giving ACT and reassessed on a 2-month follow-up after giving ACT. After 4 months, overall experience of patients regarding intervention had been taken.
Stress management was first applied over 107 patients individually to make a patient relax. This therapy consists of two sessions for 2 months in a 30 -day interval, and each session have continued for 40 min. This therapy includes six different types of technique such as relaxation, breathing exercise, visualization, active music making therapy, progressive muscle relaxation technique, and mood diary.

Statistical Analysis
Descriptive analysis was done of the variables included in the study. The Student’s t test was used to establish the possible association between distinct parameters for analyzing the effect of ACT. One-way ANOVA was used to depict whether descriptive variables significantly associated with participation in psychological intervention or not. The significance level for p < 0.05 was used for the statistical analyses. Data was analyzed with IBM SPSS package (Statistical Program for the Social Sciences, Chicago, IL), version 20 for Windows.
Method
Patient Selection
One hundred seven individuals who were diagnosed with cancer and were receiving treatment at the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Caner Research Institute, Kolkata, were identified and invited to take part in this study. Participants were chosen for screening according to the liberal inclusion and exclusion criteria adopted for the study.
Inclusion Criteria
Patient must be diagnosed with the stage of the disease. Age limit will be 20–60 years. Patient willing to participate in the present study. There were included participants who are physically stable and psychologically concern for regular follow-up. The patient must passed at least Vth. standard.
Exclusion Criteria
Terminally ill cancer patients Patient having psychiatric illness
Procedure
The study was presented as a training session, and interested patients were enrolled. After primary evaluation, 107 patients were selected. Stress management was applied on 107 patients following four types of scales (AAQ-II, MLQ, PSS, and WEMWBS). Among them, 46 patients were able to undergo all types of techniques to manage stress. The rest of them fail to comply with all the techniques due to their disease status. While providing acceptance and commitment therapy among these 107 patients, withdrawal was seen for different reasons like dead, reluctant to join, poor health condition, and discontinuation. ACT was satisfactorily applied in 55 patients, and they were reassessed after 4 months (Fig. 2 ). The study was subject to approval by the ethical committee of our institute following the guidelines given by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).

Results
The present study for the purpose of examining the effect of ACT on stress, quality of life, meaning of life, and acceptance level in diverse cancer patients was performed. In Fig. 3 , there had shown the percentage of participants with reference of their age group, gender, education and occupation, family structure, psychological problem, and different types of cancer. We discovered that the majority of the patients were female, married, and coming from urban areas. The number of addicted participants was 67 out of 107. Smokers were 19 (28.36 %), guraku (a substance mixture of tobacco and jiggery and red kharia, a form of mitti, widely consumed in Orissa, Jharkhand states, and is bad for health known for oral cancer) users were 35 patients (both male and female), and drinkers were 13. Fig. 3 Percentage of participants with reference to their age group, gender, education and occupation, family structure, psychological problem, and different types of cancer
In the course of psychological intervention, among all participated patients in this study, acceptance and commitment therapy was applied over 55 (51.40 %). Among those patients, number of male was 19 (34.56 %) and female 36 (65.46 %). Twenty-eight (50.91 %) patients were coming from rural areas and the rest is from urban areas. Nineteen (34.56 %) patients belonged to the joint family and 18 (23.73 %) from nuclear. Twenty-one (38.19 %) patients were employed, 16 (29.1 %) were unskilled, and 18 (32.73 %) were housewives out of 55 participated patients in this psychological treatment. Stress management was applied to over 46 (43 %) patients, and among them, female were 22 (47.83 %) and male 24 (52.17 %). Thirty-three (26.09 %) of the patients are coming from rural areas and 12 (73.91 %) from urban areas. In occupational case, 17 (36.96 %) patients were employed, nine unemployed (19.57 %), and housewife 20 (43.48 %) among the participated patients on this therapy. The detail parts of stress management have been depicted in Table 1 .

Table 2 data represented a severity level of different psychological assessment scales before giving ACT. The Perceived Stress Scale indicated that 64.49 % had been suffering from severe level of stress while the Meaning of Life Questionnaire revealed 57.94 % severity level among participants. The Warwick-Edinburgh Well-being Scale (WEMWBS) had shown 27.1 % severity level. Acceptance and Action Questionnaire was assessed how much a patient accepts the present disease, and it showed 55.14 % cannot accept the present disease. Further details are represented in the table.

Association of psychological interventions between before and after effect of therapy was presented in Table 3 . From that table, it has been depicted in MLQ and AAQ a significant association between before and after application of psychological intervention. On the opposite side, an insignificant association between CPSS and WEMWBS has been found before and after psychological intervention.

The correlation between psychological intervention and different parameters was shown in Table 4 . It has been found that acceptance and commitment therapy significantly associated with age ( p = 0.0001), marital status ( p = 0.022), and occupation ( p = 0.0001). On the additional side, other factors such as sex ( p = 0.054), democracy ( p = 0.89), and family structure ( p = 0.654) did not associate with this treatment. Stress management emphasizes that a patient’s age ( p = 0.001), marital status (p = 0.022), and occupation ( p = 0.0001) were significantly associated with this therapy. Relaxation technique is significantly associated with age ( p = 0.008), marital status ( p = 0.004), and occupation ( p = 0.0001). In case of breathing exercise and visualization, both the treatments are strongly associated with occupation ( p = 0.0001 and p = 0.004, respectively) and democracy ( p = 0.006 and p = 0.018, respectively). Progressive muscle relaxation technique, significantly associated with marital status ( p = 0.045) and occupation ( p = 0.005).Active music making therapy is significantly associated with occupation ( p = 0.025). Mood diary is significantly associated with occupation (0.006).

Discussion
In previous research, 55 different types of cancer patients were taken to elicit the effectiveness of ACT at enhancing the quality of life by reducing stress among cancer patients. The data showed significant improvements on outcome measures, from pre to post. Regression analyses showed that changes in psychological flexibility predicted changes in quality of life, distress, and mood [ ]. On the other side, [ ] had worked over 20 people and divided into two groups, experimental as well as control. The experimental group received eight sessions with ACT and stress management group therapy. The follow-up stage was performed in 1 month. The findings elicited that ACT may be considered to be an effective intervention approach for the treatment of depression. In the present study, the effectiveness of ACT with a combination of stress management mainly had been established and observed how well a cancer patient can manage stress and live meaningfully.
Before the psychological intervention, four different types of scales were used such as CPSS, MLQ, WEMWBS, and AAQ among cancer patients. Cohen Perceived Stress Scale and Acceptance and Action Questionnaire’s (AAQ) rate of severity were much higher than that of Meaning of Life Questionnaire and Well-being Scale (Table 2 ). From the outcome of assessment, it was noticed that during treatment, excessive stress, hopelessness plays an important part among the patients. Day to day deterioration of health and economic problem is also a cause of stress. On the other side, when a patient now comes to know that he or she is a cancer patient, two things always play in his or her mind. First, everything comes out of hand and the other concern is that death is knocking at the door. It is hard for them to accept the disease and fight against it.
After giving two types of psychological therapy, acceptance ( p = .000) and meaning of life ( p = 0.022) have improved in patients. This significant improvement had been achieved in just 2 months follow-up (Table 3 ). Patients have learned to live a meaningful life owing the acceptance with taking willingly. The consequences of these findings are consistent with the research of [ ]. As observed in the study, this therapy leads to increasing psychological flexibility. Patients had mandated to give pleasure to other people who in turn will increase their happiness. One of a patient’s response in this regard was—“One day I came to a playschool because I love children, I gave some chocolates to them. After seeing chocolates, they become happy. Seeing the smiling faces of the children, I get the courage to fight against cancer.” Our findings, that after ACT participants were leading meaningful lives has been supported by [ ]. In the present study, patients reported the improvement on stress ( p = 0.054) and quality of life ( p = 0.064), though these are not significant (Table 3 ). During psychotherapy, patients have understood that past and future are not in our hands. But their health deterioration as well as the financial problem is becoming the obstacles to continue the treatment. As a result, the quality of life of patients is being affected. One of the patient said that “I want to fight against my disease, but my health does not support my desire. When I see my parents giving away all the savings of their life and almost leading to a situation of bankruptcy, then how can I be strong???”
If we see it sociodemographically, we find that, it was not difficult to convince females to make them adopt psychological treatment rather than males, though the difference was not significant. [ ], demonstrated that men and women differ considerably on a wide variety of variables in these cases. Their study provides a brief account of the current research literature on gender effects of psychotherapy and reports the findings about gender differences in outcome for the two different treatment modalities. From the present study, it has been stated that the female always tries to discuss their problems with others rather than the male. Occupational variation made a difference in psychotherapy participation. In eastern countries, employees who were educated (minimum graduate), they believe that psychotherapy is for mentally unbalanced people. Unemployed person and housewife, in both cases, it was seen that, psychotherapy for them was a treatment for cancer patients rather than to know what it (psychotherapy) is. Actually, these two were economically dependent on a professional level. That is why they didn’t want to let anyone know about their health. They are more attentive to live a better life on their own. Students, it is seen that they are more concerned about their future rather than the present. One of the patient’s responses was “Will I be able to continue my studies?." For this reason, it was difficult to give psychotherapy to them. Retired persons used to say “We are old enough, what will happen doing these therapies at this age?." Due to age variation, difference in result occurs in acceptance and commitment therapy and stress management (Table 4 ). Those people who were in the age of 30–50 years think that they have been diagnosed with cancer as they had done any sin in their previous birth. But when a psychologist lets them understand it in the right manner, they accepted it in a positive way, “after following your instruction I started dreaming of a new and positive way”. Patients, who were 20–30 years age group, had a strong desire to live a life. That is why, they were followed up consistently. In the first interview they said, "I want to live a healthy life, tell me what to do to make it possible." Between 51 and 60 years aged, people had the impression in the first interview that, they will get money/allowance or not, as their sons are tired of them. In case of relationship status, we saw those female patients who were married, have the mental support of a large number of family members. For that, their first response was, "I have to live for my baby and for my family" whereas widow and unmarried people did not get that support comparatively. That is why, they didn’t have the courage to survive. They only have one thought, "what will I do, being alive?" (Tables 1 and 4 ).
Conclusion
Acceptance and commitment therapy can be an effective intervention approach for cancer patients that increases acceptance of thought and feeling related to cancer. Depending on the findings of this study, ACT can be chosen as a method of psychotherapy and complementary medical treatment, to be utilized to improve meaning of life among patients with cancer. A cancer patient could not manage their stress in a better way of enhancing the quality of life due to poor physical condition. We just hope that the results of this study will encourage related experts to give more importance to the psychological aspect of this disease. Further research in this field utilizing a larger sample in a randomized trial with more behavioral-orientated outcome measure will prove helpful for patients.
