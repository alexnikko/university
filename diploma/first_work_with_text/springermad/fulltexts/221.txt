Highlights
A clinical score was recently proposed to rule out concomitant deep vein thrombosis in patients with superficial vein thrombosis. We performed a post-hoc analysis to assess the diagnostic value of the ICARO score in the community-based population of the STEPH study, a prospective study in primary care. We found that the ICARO score had a sensitivity of 36.0%, a specificity of 40.2%, a positive predictive value of 13.4% and a negative predictive value of 70.9%. Our study does not confirm the interest of the ICARO clinical score to rule out concomitant deep vein thrombosis in cases of superficial vein thrombosis.
Introduction
The potential severity of superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) has been highlighted for a decade. At the initial diagnosis of SVT, concomitant deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is found in 25% of patients and symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE) in 4% of cases [ , ].
The main predictors of concomitant DVT in SVT patients are hospitalization (OR 2.3–5.4), age ≥ 75 years (OR 2.3–2.9), active cancer (OR 2.6), SVT occurring on a non-varicose vein (OR 1.8–3.3) and personal history of DVT or PE (OR 1.8) [ ]. Until now, clinical presentation has not been considered a reliable tool to detect immediate complications, emphasizing the need of an ultrasonography in every case when SVT is suspected [ , , , ].
In 2015, the ICARO study proposed a clinical score in order to rule out concomitant DVT in patients with a confirmed SVT [ ]. This score resulted in three levels of risk for DVT, making it possible to argue for the urgent need of an ultrasonography: a low probability group with a prevalence of concomitant DVT under 3%, an intermediate probability group with a prevalence of concomitant DVT between 10% and 20%, and a high probability group with a prevalence of concomitant DVT of more than 20% [ ]. This score, for which the sensitivity and specificity was 99.7% and 23.0% respectively, was elaborated in hospital-based Thrombosis Units or Anticoagulation Clinics, and never validated externally.
The STEPH study was a multicenter, community-based study conducted during a 1-year period in a French urban area representing a population of 265 687 adult residents. All general practitioners and vascular medicine physicians practicing in this area were invited to participate in the study. All patients with clinically suspected lower limb acute SVT were referred to a vascular medicine physician for systematic compression ultrasonography. Symptoms and signs of PE were systematically sought by the vascular medicine physician. A concomitant deep vein thrombosis was found in 24.6% of cases and a concomitant symptomatic pulmonary embolism in 4.7% of cases, which is in accordance with the available evidence. The primary care setting of this study, its prospective design aiming at completeness, and the validation of all events by an independent central adjudication committee made STEPH data an ideal cohort in which to assess the ICARO score accuracy in primary care. The aim of this study was to assess the external validity of the ICARO score in the community-based population of the STEPH study.
Materials and methods
Setting
We performed a post-hoc analysis of data from the STEPH cross-sectional study [ ].
Study population
All ambulatory or hospitalized adult patients living in the Greater Saint-Etienne urban area (France) and presenting a clinical suspicion of SVT were eligible for the STEPH study. As in the ICARO study, patients without an SVT at compression ultrasonography, patients with a diagnosis of concomitant PE and inpatients were excluded from this post-hoc analysis.
Data collection, follow-up and definitions of the variables
All of the 248 general practitioners working in the predefined area were asked to refer any patient with a clinically suspected SVT to a vascular medicine physician, in order to undergo a compression ultrasonography. The 28 vascular medicine physicians in the predefined area, including those practicing in a hospital, all participated in the study.
For each eligible patient, collected data was made up of: place of residence, demographic characteristics (age, sex, BMI), presence of varicose veins, personal and family history of VTE, immobilization (recent travel, bed rest, trauma, recent surgery), infectious disease, active cancer, autoimmune disease, endocrine factors (oral contraception, hormone replacement therapy, pregnancy or postpartum). Symptoms and signs of PE were systematically investigated. Clinical symptoms including edema, pain, rope-like sign, erythema and warmth were also reported. All thromboembolic events (SVT, DVT, PE) were reviewed by an independent central adjudication committee.
Statistical analysis
Qualitative data was reported in numbers and percentages. Quantitative data was reported using median and interquartile ranges. The odds ratio for concomitant DVT and its corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated for each item of the ICARO score. We then computed the score for each patient, and performed a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, computing the area under the ROC curve and its corresponding 95% CI. SPSS Windows® version 24 (IBM, NYC, USA) was used to analyze and process all data.
Results
Between 24 November 2011 and 13 November 2012, 150 outpatients were diagnosed with SVT without PE, and 28 had a concomitant DVT (18.7%).
The median age of patients was 66 years (interquartile range, 55–78 years), 99 patients (66.0%) were women, 33 (26.2%) were obese, 117 (84.8%) had varicose veins, and 41 (28.3%) had a personal history of venous thromboembolism (Table 1 ).

In our univariate analysis, none of the ICARO items were significantly different given the presence of a concomitant DVT. The odds ratio was 0.47 [95% CI, 0.19–1.13] for edema of the limb, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.14–3.11] for rope-like sign, 1.13 [95% CI, 0.39–3.27] for age ≥ 50 years, and 0.94 [95% CI, 0.29–3.07] for idiopathic SVT. The odds ratio of cancer was not calculable because of the absence of patients with malignancy and DVT.
Given computed scores, 55 patients (45.1%) had a low risk, 17 (13.9%) had an intermediate risk and 50 (41.0%) had a high risk of concomitant DVT (Table 2 ).

When risk levels were dichotomized as low vs intermediate-high risk, the ICARO score had a sensitivity of 36.0% [95% CI, 17.2–54.8], a specificity of 40.2% [95% CI, 30.4–50.0], a positive predictive value of 13.4% [95% CI, 5.2–21.6] and a negative predictive value of 70.9% [95% CI, 58.9–82.9].
Discussion
Our study is the first to examine the external validity of the ICARO score. The sensitivity and negative predictive values of the ICARO score were measured at 36.0% and 70.9% respectively, whereas they were 99.7% and 98.7% in the ICARO study. None of ICARO items differed between patients with and patients without concomitant DVT. Odds ratios ranged from 0.47 to 1.13 and all their 95% CI included 1.
The assessment of a concomitant DVT is crucial as part of the therapeutic strategy of a patient with SVT [ ]. While fondaparinux at a dosage of 2.5 mg is the only licensed drug for isolated SVT [ , , ], the presence of a proximal concomitant DVT will modify the choice of anticoagulant therapy. Hence systematic compression ultrasonography (CUS) is recommended for all patients with SVT, while only 1 in 4 to 5 will have DVT, which in turn will be proximal in only 50% of cases. Then, having a simple clinical score which helps to identify SVT patients at risk of concomitant DVTs, or SVT patients with a very low risk of DVT may significantly help clinicians to decide if CUS is urgent or even necessary. While the ICARO score seemed promising, its return was poor in the patients of the STEPH study.
Those differences may be due to differences in study design and the lower statistical power of the STEPH study. Our study was prospective, all events were adjudicated by an independent committee, and inclusion of both in and out-patients living in a well-defined geographic area was exhaustive. The 95% CI of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values show that the small sample size does not compromise the conclusions of this study.
The varicose veins rate in our study was far higher than in the ICARO study: 84.8% compared to 32.3%. Varicose veins are known to be a risk factor of concomitant DVT (OR 1.8–3.3) [ , ]. The STEPH study varicose veins rate seems to be very consistent with data from large epidemiological studies, such as the POST study (81.8%) and the OPTIMEV study (64.6%) [ , ].
Other patient characteristics were similar in the two (STEPH and ICARO) studies: age (median = 66 vs. 58.3), sex (women = 66.0 vs. 63.7), BMI > 30 (26.2 vs. 19.0), personal history of SVT (32.9 vs. 36.5), hormonal replacement therapy (0 vs. 1.5). The bigger difference was for oral contraceptives (5.2 vs. 8.3) and grand saphenous veins (50.0 vs. 72.5).
The “edema of the limb” item is of particular note because it was the only one for which the odds ratio in our study was significantly different from in the ICARO study (95% CI, 0.19–1.13 in our study vs. 1.99–5.93 in the ICARO study). Moreover, it tended to go against the presence of concomitant DVT in our study (OR 0.47), whereas it was a strongly linked to concomitant DVT in the ICARO study (OR 3.44).
Our results are in line with risk factors for concomitant DVT known in literature: hospitalization (OR 2.3–5.4), age ≥ 75 years (OR 2.3–2.9), active cancer (OR 2.6), SVT occurring on a non-varicose vein (OR 1.8–3.3) and personal history of VTE (OR 1.8) [ , ]. The literature does not mention edema, or rope-like sign, mentioned in the ICARO score.
In conclusion, our study does not confirm the utility of the ICARO clinical score in/for ruling out concomitant DVT in cases of SVT. While such a score is warmly welcomed in order to avoid unnecessary compression ultrasonography, on the basis of our dataset, its contribution does not seem sufficiently good for it to be used in a primary care setting. While some differences may be due to differences in study design and lack of statistical power, the integration of factors such as edema and the resulting score weighting needs to be confirmed for a larger population.
