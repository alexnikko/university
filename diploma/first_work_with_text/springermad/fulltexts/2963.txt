Introduction
Accurate interpretation of radiographic images requires knowledge of normal variants because these variants can be mistaken for abnormalities [ ]. Interpretation of ossification centers in children can be particularly challenging because of ongoing growth and development. CT scans offer exquisite detail of ossification, and this has added to our knowledge. The purpose of this paper is to describe the appearance of pelvic ossification centers on CT throughout childhood.
At birth, each hemipelvis consists of three primary ossification centers: the ilium, the ischium and the pubis, with intervening and overlying hyaline cartilage. During maturation, secondary ossification centers appear in the cartilage between the bones (synchondroses), and this cartilage ultimately ossifies completely and fuses to form the normal adult pelvis. These synchondroses include the ischiopubic synchondrosis and the triradiate cartilage. Additional secondary ossification centers appear at the ischial apophysis, the sacrum at the sacroiliac joint, the iliac crest apophysis and the symphysis pubis [ , ]. Secondary ossification centers are irregular or fragmented when they appear and can be confused for pathology on CT if the normal appearance is not recognized.
Materials and methods
Our facility’s institutional review board approved this study, which was performed in accordance with the ethical standards as laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.
We identified CT scans of the pelvis obtained between 2010 and 2014 using the institution’s picture archiving and communication system (PACS). We then screened these studies for indication and intrinsic bone disease, pelvic trauma, known delayed or advanced sexual maturation, and other medical conditions or treatment thereof that could affect bone development (e.g., cancer, neuromuscular disease, intrinsic bone disease, inflammatory disease or endocrinopathy) and excluded these cases. We then evaluated the remaining cases to ensure that they were of normal stature by plotting the height of each case at the time of the CT study using the appropriate growth chart for age and gender [ ]. We excluded children who were outside the 5th–95th percentile range for stature for their age.
After these exclusions, we identified 333 CT scans of healthy children and young adults ages 2.9 years to 18.7 years (median age 11.8 years; 163 girls). We further excluded the eight children younger than age 5 years because all ossification centers were open in seven of these eight children. In one child (a 4.3-year-old boy), there was partial ossification of the ischiopubic synchondrosis. We therefore report ossification information on 325 children and young adults ages 5 years through 18 years (median age 12.2±4.0 years).
We sorted scan data by age and gender to evaluate representation and distribution. We ensured that there were at least 10 patients for each gender in each year of age from 5 years through 18 years. The average age, standard deviation and age range by gender were determined for each grade by ossification center. Each scan was reviewed by two of three pediatric radiologists, all radiology board- and pediatric Certificate of Added Qualifications (CAQ)-certified, with practice experience ranging 13–32 years (L.E.G., M.P.H., G.W.G.). We reviewed six principle ossification centers: ischiopubic synchondrosis, triradiate cartilage, ischial apophysis, sacrum, iliac crest apophysis and symphysis pubis. We graded each by consensus according to presence and size of ossification fragments in the cartilage, fusion of the synchondroses or apophyses, and additional incidental osseous variations. For grading, we incorporated appearance on axial images as well as on coronal and sagittal reformatted images. In the sacrum, we reviewed coronal oblique reformats in several cases and determined that based on the complexity of the joint, a coronal oblique plane did not contribute additional information beyond what was seen on the routine axial and coronal views.
We graded the ossification centers (except the iliac crest apophysis) on a numeric scale depending on the absence, progressive ossification and fusion of fragments. For the iliac crest apophysis, we graded absence and degree of fusion using the Risser classification [ ]. Table 1 outlines the grading system. Table 1 Grading system for each ossification center Ossification centers Grade description 0 1 2 3 4 5 Ischiopubic synchondrosis Open Narrow, irregular, fusing Fused --- --- --- Triradiate cartilage No fragments Small fragments Coalescing fragments Fused --- --- Ischial apophysis No fragments Fragments Fused --- --- --- Sacrum No fragments Fragments Fused --- --- --- Iliac crest apophysis (Risser score) No fragments 1/4 ossified 1/2 ossified 3/4 ossified Fully ossified, not fused Fused Symphysis pubis No fragments Fragments Fused --- --- --- --- not applicable

Ossification centers
Ischiopubic synchondrosis
The cartilage of the ischiopubic synchondrosis does not ossify in fragments and is best seen on axial images. The grading was as follows: 0=unossified synchondrosis, 1=narrow synchondrosis and 2=fused synchondrosis (Fig. 1 ). When asymmetrical, the higher grade was assigned for purposes of analysis. Fig. 1 Ischiopubic synchondrosis grading. a, b Axial ( a ) and sagittal ( b ) CT images of the unossified ischiopubic synchondrosis, Grade 0 ( arrow ) in a 5.1-year-old girl. There is a wide gap between the ischium and pubis. c, d Axial ( c ) and sagittal ( d ) CT images of the narrowed ischiopubic synchondrosis, grade 1 ( arrows ; note asymmetry), in an 11.3-year-old boy. e, f Axial ( e ) and sagittal ( f ) CT images of the fused ischiopubic synchondrosis, grade 2, in a 9.1-year-old girl
Ischiopubic synchondroses were seen in 304 of our patients (145 girls) and were below the area scanned on 21 children. In girls, the earliest fusion was at 5.4 years and all synchondroses were fused by age 12.5 years. In boys, the earliest fusion was at 5.3 years and fusion was completed by age 12.2 years. The ischiopubic synchondroses were asymmetrical in 6% of children (Fig. 2 ).

Bars indicate ± 1 standard deviation
Triradiate cartilage
The triradiate cartilage is a Y-shape synchondrosis among the three primary ossification centers of the hip joint: the ilium, the ischium and the pubis. During maturation, small secondary ossification fragments are first seen in the center of the triradiate cartilage. Later, the fragments increase in size and are scattered throughout the triradiate cartilage, followed by coalescence, and finally complete fusion. The triradiate cartilage is best evaluated on sagittal reformatted images, although the inferior (vertical) and anterior/posterior (horizontal) limbs also can be seen on axial and coronal reformatted images, respectively (grading scale: 0=unossified synchondrosis, 1=small fragments, 2=coalescing fragments and 3=fused; Fig. 3 ). Fig. 3 Triradiate cartilage grading. a, b Axial ( a ) and sagittal ( b ) CT images of the triradiate cartilage, grade 0, in a 5.4-year-old girl. c, d Axial ( c ) and sagittal ( d ) CT images of the triradiate cartilage, grade 1, show a small amount of ossification in a 7.1-year-old girl. e, f Axial ( e ) and sagittal ( f ) CT images of the triradiate cartilage, grade 2, show increased ossification within the triradiate cartilage in an 11.7-year-old girl. g, h Axial ( g ) and sagittal ( h ) CT images of the triradiate cartilage, grade 3, show complete fusion in a 16.7-year-old girl
We evaluated the triradiate cartilage in 325 children (160 girls). In girls the ossification centers in the triradiate cartilage first appeared at 5.8 years of age, and large fragments were common between 9 years and 11 years. Fusion was seen starting at 11.5 years and was completed by 12.8 years. In boys ossification centers first appeared at 7.9 years of age, and large fragments were common between 11 years and 13 years. Earliest fusion occurred at 12.2 years and was completed by 14.6 years (Fig. 2 ). Ossification is typically symmetrical. Prior to and during maturation, the margins of the primary ossification centers at the triradiate cartilage are spiculated, which gives the appearance of fragmentation in the axial plane (Fig. 4 ). Fig. 4 Acetabular roof fragmentation. a, b Apparent acetabular roof fragmentation on axial ( a ) and sagittal ( b ) CT images in an 11.8-year-old boy. Note spiculation of the acetabular roof without fragmentation ( solid arrows ). Fragment between the ilium and ischium posteriorly on the sagittal image ( open arrow ) indicates beginning ossification of the triradiate cartilage (grade 1)
Ossification is also seen in three secondary centers within the peripheral acetabular cartilage. These appear transiently at the same time that the large triradiate fragments are seen. These are ossification centers arising from the pubis anteriorly (os acetabuli anterius), the ilium superiorly (acetabular epiphysis) and the ischium posteriorly (os acetabuli posterius) [ ]. When they fuse to the primary ossification center, they add depth to the acetabular cup (Fig. 5 ) [ ]. Fig. 5 Acetabular rim cartilage ossification in an 11.7-year-old girl. a, b Axial ( a ) and sagittal ( b ) CT images show the acetabular rim ossification anteriorly and posteriorly
Ischial apophysis
The ischium forms the posterior inferior aspect of the innominate bone. When ossification begins, a small fragment is first seen in the cephalad aspect of the cartilaginous apophysis. Fragments enlarge and eventually fuse with the ischium [ ]. The ischial apophyses were best seen on axial and reformatted sagittal images and were graded on a scale of 0–2 (grading scale: 0=unossified apophysis, 1=fragmented apophysis and 2=fused apophysis; Fig. 6 ). Fig. 6 Ischial apophysis grades 0–2. a, b In grade 0, axial ( a ) and sagittal ( b ) CT images show cortical irregularity along the posterior ischium, more pronounced on the left, in a 13.7-year-old boy. No fragments are visible. c, d In grade 1, axial ( c ) and sagittal ( d ) CT images show large symmetrical fragments extending along the entire length of the ischial apophysis in an 11.2-year-old girl. e, f In grade 2, axial ( e ) and sagittal ( f ) CT images show smooth posterior borders of the ischium bilaterally in an 18.7-year-old man. Both ischial apophyses are completely ossified and fused to the ischium
The region of the ischial apophyses was included in 317 scans (154 girls); the apophyses were not included in eight scans. In girls the margins of the posterior inferior ischium were slightly irregular without apophyseal ossification until 10 years of age. Small fragments appeared in the apophyses as they began to ossify at age 10.9 years. They were largely fused by age 16.9 years when the posterior inferior margin had a smooth bony contour. In boys ossification was first seen in the apophyses at 11.7 years, and most were fused and smooth by age 17.8 years. The ischial apophyses fused after the triradiate cartilage in both girls and boys (Fig. 2 ).
Sacrum
The secondary ossification centers (epiphyses) of the sacrum develop along the lateral aspect. They appear linear and fragmented, later coalescing and fusing to the body of the sacrum. Grading was as follows: 0=no ossified epiphyses, 1=ossified epiphyses without or with partial fusion and 2=fused epiphyses (Fig. 7 ). There were no ossified epiphyseal fragments in either stage 0 or stage 2. To differentiate grade 0 and grade 2, we measured the transverse distance at the anterior sacroiliac joint (using the narrower side), 1 cm below the superior margin of S1. It is wider than 2.7 mm in grade 0 (Fig. 8 ). We observed that grade 0 shows a thin sharp linear cortex along the lateral surface of the sacrum, whereas grade 2 shows a thickened, lobulated cortical margin. Fig. 7 Sacrum grades 0–2. In grade 0, axial ( a ) and coronal ( b ) CT images show no fragments of ossification center in a 13-year-old boy. In grade 1, axial ( c ) and coronal ( d ) CT images show fragments that commonly present as a thin ribbon configuration on both CT views in a 16-year-old boy. In grade 2, axial ( e ) and coronal ( f ) CT images show fused ossification centers in a 17-year-old boy Fig. 8 Sacrum grading. a, b To distinguish between grades 0 and 2 on CT, we used the measurement of anterior sacroiliac joint width on the axial image ( a ) at the level 1 cm below the superior margin of S1 ( solid lines on coronal image, b ). The results show narrower joint space in grade 2
The sacrum was evaluated in 325 children and young adults (160 girls). In females the ossification centers first appeared at 10.9 years of age, gradually ossifying and fusing, and were incompletely fused in some of our oldest patients. Earliest complete fusion occurred at 12.2 years. All females older than 13 years showed grade 1 or grade 2. In 24 females between 17.0 and 18.7 years of age, 46% (11/24) showed complete fusion (grade 2). In males ossification centers first appeared at 13.1 years of age, gradually ossifying and fusing, and were incompletely fused in some of our oldest patients. Earliest complete fusion occurred at 14.2 years. All males older than 15.8 years showed grade 1 or grade 2. In 21 males between 17.0 and 18.8 years of age, 48% (10/21) showed complete fusion (grade 2; Fig. 2 ). The sequence of fusion appears in an anterior-posterior and caudal-cranial gradient and is typically asymmetrical.
Iliac crest apophysis
The ilium is a primary ossification center with a cartilaginous superior apophysis. The Risser staging system is used to grade skeletal maturity based on development and fusion of the secondary ossification centers of the iliac crest apophysis, divided into six stages (Risser stages 0–5) [ ]. Stage 0 describes a radiograph on which no ossification center is seen in the apophysis, whereas stage 5 represents complete ossification and fusion of the iliac crest apophysis. It typically progresses along the iliac crest anterolaterally to posteromedially (grading scale: 0=unossified apophysis, 1=one-quarter ossified, 2=one-half ossified, 3=three-quarters ossified, 4=completely ossified but not fused to the body of the ilium and 5=ossified and fused to the ilium; Fig. 9 ). We evaluated the iliac crest apophyses in 325 patients (160 females). In our study group, ossified fragments first appeared on CT at 11.2 years of age in girls. All females older than 13.4 years of age had ossification, and all older than 15.1 years of age showed stage 4 or stage 5. First complete fusion (stage 5) appeared at 15.6 years of age. Three of eleven females (27%) showed incomplete fusion at 18 years of age. In males, ossification fragments first appeared on CT at 12.2 years. All males older than 13.9 years had ossified fragments, and all older than 15.9 years showed stage 4 or stage 5. Earliest complete fusion occurred at 16.4 years of age. Two of 10 males (20%) showed incomplete fusion at 18 years of age (Fig. 2 ). Fig. 9 Iliac crest apophyses. Anterior three-dimensional CT reconstruction in a 13.1-year-old girl demonstrates the Risser grading system. It is divided into six stages (Risser 0–5). Stage 0 shows no ossification center in the apophyses, whereas stage 5 shows complete fusion. Ossification typically progresses along the iliac crest anterolaterally to posteromedially ( arrow )
Symphysis pubis
The symphysis pubis is a cartilaginous joint consisting of a fibrocartilaginous disc between the medial aspect of the adjacent pubic bones. Small secondary ossification centers emerge anterosuperiorly. These grow larger and are incorporated into the pubic bones [ ]. The components of the symphysis pubis are best seen on axial and reformatted coronal images and we graded these on a scale of 0–2 (grading scale: 0=absence of ossification, 1=fragmented ossification and 2=fusion; Fig. 10 ). Fig. 10 Symphysis pubis grades 0–2. a, b In grade 0, axial ( a ) and coronal ( b ) CT images show irregular serrated margins of the symphysis pubis in a 15-year-old girl. The symphysis pubis is wider anteriorly on axial view and wider inferiorly on coronal view. The triangular shape is apparent in ( b ). c, d In grade 1, axial CT image ( c ) shows the margins of the symphysis pubis are becoming parallel in an 18.1-year-old woman. Fragments are now seen in the anterior aspect of the ossifying symphysis pubis and in the anterior superior aspect of the symphysis pubis on coronal image ( d ). e, f In grade 2, both axial ( e ) and coronal ( f ) projections show that the margins of the symphysis pubis are smooth and relatively parallel compared with the unfused symphysis pubis in a 31-year-old man. Note that the grade 2 case was included for demonstration purposes; none of our subjects was grade 2
The symphysis pubis was included in all but one of the 325 cases (159 females). Secondary ossification centers were seen in 28 females and 24 males. They were first seen in girls at age 13.9 years and in almost all girls by 17 years. Secondary ossification centers were first visible in boys at 15.9 years of age and were seen in almost all males by 18 years (Fig. 2 ). Accessory ossification centers were still present in 45% of females and 50% of males in the 17- to 18-year age range, consistent with a report in the literature indicating that the symphysis pubis fuses in early adulthood [ ]. Seventy-seven percent of the secondary ossification centers were symmetrical. We were unable to definitively confirm fusion in our patient group.
Incidental findings
Other findings included 20 patients (6%) with transitional vertebrae at the lumbosacral junction; 20 (6%) with vacuum phenomena in the sacroiliac joints; 20 (6%) with Schmorl nodes; 13 (4%) with spondylolysis/listhesis; 8 (2%) with subchondral cysts, mostly at the sacroiliac joints; and 3 (1%) with congenital vertebral anomalies.
Discussion
Secondary ossification centers are well seen on CT, and the appearance and maturation has not been systematically described in the literature. We expected ossification to vary by age and gender, starting and ending earlier in girls than boys, and two of the studied areas (triradiate cartilage and ischial apophysis) followed this pattern. The symphysis pubis, sacrum and iliac crest apophysis ossification started earlier in girls than boys, and fusion occurred earlier in girls than boys, but fusion of these centers was not complete in many of our oldest patients. One area did not follow this pattern: the ischiopubic synchondrosis fusion started and was complete at approximately the same age in males and females.
Ossification of secondary ossification centers of the pelvis begins in a specific order in both girls and boys — first the ischiopubic synchondrosis followed by the triradiate cartilage. After these two, the earliest signs of ossification in the ischial apophysis, sacrum and iliac crest apophysis overlap. Ossification in the symphysis pubis begins last. Although the ischiopubic synchondrosis begins ossification earlier than the triradiate cartilage, complete fusion of the centers overlaps in the 11- to 12-year age group. Ischial apophysis fusion occurs after fusion of the ischiopubic synchondrosis and triradiate cartilage. The sacrum, iliac crest apophysis and symphysis pubis ossification centers were not fused in all patients at age 18 years. The ossification centers are sometimes asymmetrical, especially at the symphysis pubis and less often at the ischiopubic synchondrosis.
Ischiopubic synchondrosis
The ischiopubic synchondroses are the first synchondroses to fuse. There is typically a wide gap between the ischium and the pubis in young children, with progressive narrowing over time as the two bones ossify. In the literature, closure is reported to occur as early as 3 years of age [ , ]. Because our study did not include children younger than 5 years, we cannot comment on earliest closure. In our group, 4 of the 20 children in the 5-year age group (two girls) had fused synchondroses. The age of fusion for the whole group was the same for girls and boys, unlike most other centers, which fused earlier in girls than boys.
The ischiopubic synchondroses are reported to frequently close asymmetrically [ ]. Asymmetrical fusion is reportedly related to foot dominance, caused by asymmetrical mechanical force on the non-dominant limb [ ]; we did not test this, although we did see asymmetry in 6%.
There is irregularity and sometimes hypertrophy of the bony margins during maturation, followed by closure. The variability in appearance of the synchondroses makes diagnosis of pathology such as osteomyelitis more difficult in symptomatic patients [ ].
Triradiate cartilage
The acetabulum comprises three primary ossification centers with the triradiate cartilage synchondrosis between them. Multiple secondary ossification centers within the synchondrosis promote expansion of the acetabulum [ ]. Maturation follows a typical pattern and is usually symmetrical. Three ossification centers are also present in the cartilaginous rim of the acetabulum and these add depth. The acetabular rim ossification centers are transient, appearing and fusing typically at the time of triradiate fusion. Lack of fusion of these centers with the primary ossification centers, whether developmental or traumatic, can produce marginal fragmentation. In some cases this is the source of the “normal variant” called the os acetabulum. The cleft between the normal ossification center and the ilium should be horizontal and cartilaginous, whereas the cleft between the bone and a traumatic fragment should be vertical and filled with connective tissue [ , ].
Ischial apophysis
At birth, most of the ischium is not yet ossified. The cartilaginous ischial anlage ossifies during early childhood, with the posterior inferior aspect, the ischial apophysis, ossifying last. Maturation of the ischial apophysis follows a similar pattern in girls and boys, with fragments first appearing in the cephalad aspect of the apophyses. The apophyses fuse over the course of approximately 6 years in both genders. Boys’ apophyses begin to fuse approximately 10 months after that of girls and are completely fused approximately 11 months after girls’. We found evidence of earlier onset of fusion as well as earlier completion of fusion than previously reported by Eich et al. [ ]. Eich et al. reported an age range of 13–15 years for appearance of ossification and an age range 20–25 years for fusion. The data reported in that paper were derived from radiographs from the 1960s. The differences in age that we report might be a result of differing imaging modalities or other factors.
Sacrum
The sacrum is a developmentally complex bone and ossifies from primary and secondary ossification centers. Each vertebra has five primary ossification centers including the centrum, two posterior neural arches, and two costal processes lateral to the centrum. As the sacrum matures, multiple sacral secondary ossification centers, deemed epiphyses, are responsible for the final fusion and modeling of the surface contours of the sacrum. These centers are small and difficult to see on plain radiographs of pelvis. CT allows for exquisite visualization of these epiphyses.
Gotz et al. [ ] reported that the secondary ossification centers of the sacrum develop along the sacroiliac joint surfaces and are observed between the ages of 12 years and 25 years. The lateral surface epiphyses represent a coalescence of the anterior costal epiphyses and posterior costal epiphyses between the S1 and S3 levels, and the two lowest anterior costal epiphyses and fourth and fifth transverse process epiphyses at the S4 and S5 levels.
Broome et al. [ ] reported that the secondary ossification centers of the lateral surfaces (anterior and posterior costal epiphyses) developed along the sacroiliac joint surfaces after puberty, generally fusing to the sacrum between 16 years and 25 years of age.
Cardoso et al. [ ] reported the earliest age of fusion for males at greater than 16 years and females at greater than 18 years. In Cardoso et al.’s study, skeletons of subjects who died between 1903 and 1975 were physically examined. It is important to note that this study population consisted of people of low socio-economic status and who were likely undernourished [ ].
Most recently, Zejden and Jurik [ ] reported that the epiphyses first appeared at age 11 years in girls and 13 years in boys. In our study, the earliest ossification was seen at 10.9 years of age in girls and 13.1 years of age in boys, similar to their results. In our study all females older than 13 years and all males older than 15.8 years showed ossification centers. The earliest complete fusion in our study was seen at 12.2 years in girls and 14.2 years in boys, which is earlier than previously reported by Cardoso et al. [ ]. In our study, complete fusion occurred in 46% of females and 48% of males in a total of 45 cases by ages 17 years to 18.8 years.
There is difficulty differentiating between grade 0 and grade 2 in some cases because both grades show no fragmented epiphyses. The grades can be distinguished by the appearance of the lateral cortex of the sacrum and the width of the sacroiliac joint as described in the results section.
In grade 1 cases, asymmetrical fragmented or partially fused epiphyses could be confused with a fracture line. Grade 1 cases can be distinguished from a fracture line by characteristic location and sclerotic margins. In our study no secondary ossification center appeared along the iliac bone in the sacroiliac joints.
Iliac crest apophysis
The Risser staging system, a measurement of maturation of the iliac crest apophysis in radiography, has been widely used as a reliable and useful tool for evaluating skeletal maturation, especially in treating idiopathic scoliosis. The appearance of the ossification centers and earliest fusion occurs earlier in girls than boys, as expected. Contrary to the literature, we found that the ossified fragments could be seen by CT as early as 11–12 years, earlier than the reported age of 12–13 years [ ]. Similarly, we saw complete fusion as early as 15–16 years, earlier than the reported age of 16–17 years [ ]. Our study is limited by a small sample size of only 10 cases at each age in both females and males, respectively.
Symphysis pubis
The symphysis pubis consists of a fibrocartilaginous disc lying between plates of hyaline cartilage that cover the medial aspect of the adjacent pubic bones. Differences in the appearance of the pubic bones at birth were described by Caffey and Madell [ ]. In children prior to fusion, the symphysis pubis is shaped like an asymmetrical flat-top pyramid, wider anteriorly and inferiorly. The anteromedial margins of the bony symphysis pubis are slightly irregular. In the peripubertal period, the anterior margin of the bony symphysis pubis becomes spiculated. Fragments of secondary ossification centers then appear and coalesce. As the symphysis pubis begins to fuse, the margins of the cephalad aspect acquire a parallel configuration. The caudal aspect of the symphysis pubis loses its broad anterior triangular appearance and the mature narrow parallel configuration extends from cephalad to caudad. When fused, the symphysis pubis appears as a near-parallel joint with a narrow central fibrocartilaginous disc. In the absence of secondary ossification centers, differentiating nonossification (grade 0) from fused (grade 2) might appear to be problematic. However fusion can be differentiated from nonossification by the configuration of the symphysis. In the skeletally immature child, the symphysis pubis has a broad asymmetrical configuration. As the skeleton matures and the secondary ossification centers appear and eventually fuse, the symphysis pubis becomes narrow with smooth, near-parallel cortical margins.
In the symphysis pubis, secondary ossification centers appear up to 2 years earlier in girls than boys. The secondary ossification centers of the symphysis pubis appear later than all other secondary ossification centers in the pelvis. Closure of the symphysis pubis occurs late in the maturation process, usually in early adulthood, and we were unable to definitively confirm fusion in our patient group.
Recently Bayer et al. [ ] examined the width of the symphysis pubis relative to age, gender and maturity in order to identify injury to the symphysis pubis. Our study focused on the ossification patterns found during maturation as an aid to avoiding inaccuracies during pelvic CT evaluation.
Limitations
There are several limitations of this study. This study is a cross-sectional observational study and therefore data are limited to single observations. The results we report give general information about the appearance of the various ossification centers throughout early to late childhood. Without longitudinal data for each patient, we were unable to examine the development and progression of the ossification centers within individuals. Although we did eliminate patients whose longitudinal growth was outside the normal range, we were unable to evaluate weight and assess the possible effect that weight might have on the development of the ossification centers. The oldest patient in this study was 18.7 years of age and several of the ossification centers — the symphysis pubis, the sacrum and the iliac crest apophysis — remained unfused; therefore we were unable to determine the age of complete fusion for all patients.
Despite these limitations, the information presented in this study is useful to radiologists who are examining CT images of the pelvis in children. Understanding how the ossification centers in the pelvis develop and progress through the fusion process, and their appearances on CT, and knowing the age ranges when these stages occur at each center are expected to be useful for interpretation.
Conclusion
As expected, the maturation of secondary ossification centers of the pelvis as seen on CT scans follows a pattern of ossification that progresses to fusion. Rate and progression of ossification and age of complete fusion vary with gender at the different ossification centers in the growing pelvis. Knowledge of the normal CT appearance of ossification centers throughout childhood is important to differentiate the normal appearance from pathology. Because we excluded patients with known delayed or advanced sexual maturation, the findings in this study also serve as a useful reference from which to compare children with delayed or advanced maturation.
