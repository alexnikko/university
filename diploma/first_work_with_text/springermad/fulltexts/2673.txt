Introduction
Gastric cancer (GC) is the most common malignant tumor in digestive organs, and surgical resection is the main curative treatment. In spite of recent advances in adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapies, the prognosis of GC patients who have undergone surgery remains poor because of recurrence and metastasis, which leads to high cancer-related death rates worldwide [ , ]. The identification of new surrogate factors involved in the tumor microenvironment in GC for predicting patient outcomes, besides the profiles of tumor cells, is needed.
Evidence from successful cancer immunotherapy suggests that host tumor immunity is involved in tumor progression [ , ]. Long-term survivors, even among advanced cancer patients, treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) reveal that immunosuppressive factors in tumor immunity impact the prognosis of cancer patients. There are several subpopulations of immunosuppressive cells including CD14 + monocytes, CD15 + neutrophils in myeloid cells, and Foxp3 + CD4 + regulatory T cells (Tregs) in lymphoid cells [ ].
CD15 + cells are associated with inflammation that induces tumor progression and metastasis in cancer patients [ ]. In combination with lymphocytes, CD15 + neutrophil count, particularly the neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio (NLR), is a biomarker of prognosis and therapy outcomes in patients with various types of cancers [ ]. Furthermore, granulocyte-like myeloid-derived suppressor cells (G-MDSCs) among neutrophils suppress T cells by producing IDO, arginase, reactive oxygen species (ROS), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and C–C motif chemokine ligand 17 (CCL17), which induce Tregs, and by expressing PD-L1, which results in tumor progression [ , , ].
CD14 + cells are antigen-presenting cells, such as DCs and macrophages, that enhance anti-tumor immunity, and a subpopulation of these cells function as immune suppressors such as monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSCs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) [ , ]. CD14 + CD15 − HLA-DR − CD11b + CD33 + M-MDSCs and CD14 − CD15 + HLA-DR − CD11b + G-MDSCs proliferate as immature myeloid cells in peripheral blood during cancer progression and chronic infection and markedly suppress T cells and DCs [ , , ]. Therefore, M-MDSCs are also a useful marker of poor prognosis in cancer patients [ , , ]. ICI therapy is clinically beneficial for melanoma patients with only a few M-MDSCs in peripheral blood [ , , ]. After migration into the tumor microenvironment, some M-MDSCs differentiate into TAMs [ , , ].
In GC, Tregs in tumor tissues and neutrophils, G-MDSCs, NLR, and the lymphocyte–monocyte ratio (LMR) in peripheral blood are strongly associated with immune suppression and prognosis of patients, and TAMs in tumor tissues may contribute to the epithelial–mesenchymal transition of cancer cells [ , , , , , , , , ].
In cancer patients with post-operative inflammation and stress, myeloid cells are recruited from the bone marrow and peak in number within a few days; these monocytes and neutrophils increase rapidly after an operation and are immature cells. Here, we examined the profile and function of circulating immature monocytes after standard curative gastrectomy both retrospectively and prospectively and analyzed these factors in anti-tumor immunity and GC patient prognosis.
Materials and methods
Patients and blood samples
For prognostic analyses of overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS), the clinical and pathological data of 278 GC patients who underwent curative gastrectomy and were diagnosed with pathological stages II and III between January 2007 and December 2014 at Osaka University Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. For the prospective analyses, peripheral blood and clinical and pathological data were obtained from 75 GC patients who underwent curative gastrectomy with clinical stages I, II, and III between April 2016 and December 2017 at Osaka University Hospital. Peripheral blood was obtained on post-operative days (POD) 0, 1, 3, and 7. As a control, peripheral blood was collected from 11 healthy donors.
Antibodies
The fluorescently labeled antibodies used for flow cytometry were as follows: CD3-Alexa Fluor 700 (clone UCTH1; BioLegend), CD4-Brilliant Violet 711 (clone RPA-T4; BioLegend), CD8-Brilliant Violet 510 (clone RPA-T8; BioLegend), CD45RA-FITC (clone H100; BioLegend), CD11b-Brilliant Violet 605 (clone M1/70; BioLegend), CD14-Alexa Fluor 700 (clone HCD14; BioLegend), CD15-Brilliant Violet 510 (clone W6D3; BioLegend), HLA-DR-V450 (clone G46-6; BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), CD33-Brilliant Violet 711 (clone WM53; BioLegend), CD25-PE/Cy7 (clone BC96; BioLegend), Foxp3-APC (clone PCH101; ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), IDO-FITC (clone 700838; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), and arginase 1-APC (clone 658922; R&D Systems).
Flow cytometry
Fresh peripheral blood was treated with BD Pharm Lyse buffer (BD Biosciences) to eliminate red blood cells. The remaining peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) were stained with fluorophore-conjugated antibodies at 4 °C for 30 min after FcR block (Human TruStain FcX Fc Receptor blocking solution; BioLegend). The BD Pharmingen™ Transcription Factor Buffer Set (BD Biosciences) was used for intracellular staining according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Stained cells were analyzed by LSR Fortessa (BD Biosciences), and the frequencies of cell populations were obtained in an analysis using DiVA software (BD Biosciences). To determine positive staining, an isotype control of the primary antibody conjugated with each fluorophore was used.
Measurement and calculation of cell counts
Pre-operative and post-operative monocyte, neutrophil, and white blood cell counts were obtained from general blood tests in medical reports. Increases in the post-operative cell count on post-operative day one (POD1) or day three (POD3) compared to the pre-operative cell count were calculated for monocytes, neutrophils, and CD14 + HLA-DR − cells as follows: (peak post-operative cell count on POD1 or POD3) − (pre-operative cell count).
Cell numbers were calculated using the frequency in the PBL obtained by flow cytometry (Supplementary Fig. 1) and the absolute white blood cell count.
Suppression assay
A total of 1 × 10 4 /well CD8 T cells co-cultured with autologous suppressor cells were incubated in 20 IU/mL IL-2 (Takeda Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan) in 96-well culture plates at 37 °C for 48 h and then stimulated by anti-CD3/anti-CD28 mAb-coated (CD3/CD28) beads (Dynabeads Human T-Activator CD3/CD28; ThermoFisher Scientific) for 4 h. To detect IFN-γ, T cells were harvested, washed, and labeled with IFN-γ Catch Reagent (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) on ice for 5 min and then incubated at 37 °C for 45 min. Cells were washed and stained with IFN-γ Detection Antibody (Miltenyi Biotec) and anti-CD8 antibody [ ]. CD8, CD14, and CD15 cells were purified with antibody-coated magnetic beads (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). CD14 + HLA-DR − and CD14 + HLA-DR + cells were sorted and purified by FACS Aria II (BD Biosciences) for use in the suppression assay (Supplementary Fig. 1).
Statistical analysis
The significance of differences in each experimental dataset between two groups was assessed using the Student’s two-tailed paired t test. The Kruskal–Wallis test, Mann–Whitney U test, and Chi squared test were used for univariate analysis. Survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method and compared by the log-rank test. A multivariate Cox proportional-hazard regression model was used to identify independent prognostic markers; variables for which the p value in the univariate analysis was < 0.1 were used in the multivariate model. Hazard ratios (HR) were reported with 95% confidence intervals (CI). p values < 0.05 were considered significant. Bonferroniʼs correction was applied for multiple comparisons of pre-, post- and increased monocyte, and the p values indicated were rough- p values. All statistical analyses were performed using JMP Pro 14 statistical Discovery TM (SAS Institute Inc., Cary NC, USA).
Results
Impact of the peri-operative monocyte count on the prognosis of GC patients
We retrospectively analyzed the time course of monocyte counts of 278 GC patients in the peri-operative period from data obtained from routine blood tests in medical reports. Rapid increases in the post-operative monocyte count were observed in most patients and peaked on POD1 or POD3 (Supplementary Fig. 2a). We then investigated the impact of the pre-operative monocyte count (mean ± SD; 422 ± 144/µL, median; 401/µL) and peak post-operative monocyte count (645 ± 281, 590) on POD1 or POD3 for the prognosis of each patient. Patients were divided into high and low monocyte count groups based on median count. The OS and RFS in patients with a high pre-operative monocyte count were longer than in those with a low pre-operative monocyte count, but the OS and RFS in patients with a high post-operative monocyte count were shorter than in those with a low post-operative monocyte count (Fig. 1 a, b). We then evaluated the increase in the post-operative monocyte count compared to the pre-operative monocyte count, which we termed the increased monocyte count, in each patient (223 ± 256, 176) and analyzed its relationship with prognosis. When patients were divided based on the median increased monocyte count, RFS, and OS were shorter in patients with a high increased monocyte count than in those with a low increased monocyte count (rough- p = 0.035 and p = 0.070, respectively, Fig. 1 c; Table 1 ; Supplementary Table 1), but no statistically significant difference was found with Bonferroniʼs correction. On the other hand, pre- and post-operative neutrophil counts and the increase in the post-operative neutrophil count compared to the pre-operative neutrophil count, which we termed the increased neutrophil count, were not associated with the prognosis of GC patients (Supplementary Fig. 2b). Fig. 1 Recurrence-free survival and overall survival curves of 278 GC patients. Patients were divided into high (solid line) and low (dotted line) groups by the median values of the pre-operative monocyte count ( a ), peak post-operative monocyte count on POD1 or POD3 ( b ), and the increase in post-operative monocyte count compared to the pre-operative monocyte count, which was called the increased monocyte count ( c ), and recurrence-free survival and overall survival curves were compared by the Kaplan–Meier method and log-rank test, respectively. p values indicated are rough- p .

Therefore, we investigated the increased monocyte count in GC patients in more detail.
CD14+ HLA-DR− CD33+ cells increased rapidly after gastrectomy
A prospective analysis by flow cytometry was performed on fresh peripheral blood obtained from 75 GC patients in the peri-operative period, and cell numbers were calculated. CD14 + cell numbers rapidly increased after surgery and peaked on POD1 or POD3 (Supplementary Fig. 3), and the time course of this change was consistent with that of monocytes analyzed retrospectively. CD14 + cell subpopulations were analyzed using HLA-DR as a marker of maturation and the monocytic marker CD33 (Supplementary Fig. 1). CD14 + HLA-DR − CD33 + cells that were CD11b + (data not shown) were considered immature monocytic immunosuppressive cells and detected even in healthy donors, but at low numbers, and were abundant and increased as cancer stage worsened in pre-operative GC patients (Supplementary Fig. 4a). After gastrectomy, a marked increase in CD14 + HLA-DR − cells was observed in GC patients and peaked on POD1 or POD3, but CD14 + HLA-DR + cell numbers remained constant (Fig. 2 ). The number of CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + Tregs did not markedly increase after gastrectomy (Supplementary Fig. 3). Fig. 2 Number of CD14 + HLA-DR − cells and CD14 + HLA-DR + cells in 75 GC patients in the peri-operative period. The numbers of CD14 + HLA-DR − cells ( a ) and CD14 + HLA-DR + cells ( b ) on POD 0, 1, 3, and 7 were calculated using frequencies obtained by flow cytometry and absolute white blood cell counts from routine blood tests in medical reports. Each dot indicates an individual patient. Bars indicate the mean ± SD. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 to POD0
Increases in post-operative monocyte counts were similar to those in CD14+ HLA-DR− cells
Since the peri-operative time course of monocytes was consistent with that of CD14 + cells and CD14 + HLA-DR − cells, whereas that of CD14 + HLA-DR + cells remained constant, we compared the increased monocyte count to the increase in CD14 + HLA-DR − cells after gastrectomy compared to pre-operative CD14 + HLA-DR − cells, which we termed the increased CD14 + HLA-DR − cell count. The increased monocyte count correlated with the increased CD14 + HLA-DR − cell count ( r 2 = 0.57, p < 0.001, Y = 12.7 + 1.1 X ), which suggests that the increased monocyte count was similar to the increased CD14 + HLA-DR − cell count in most of the individuals examined (Fig. 3 ). GC patients with a high increased monocyte count had a short RFS in the retrospective analysis, which suggested that CD14 + HLA-DR − cells affect tumor immunity and the prognosis of GC patients. Fig. 3 Increased monocyte count and CD14 + HLA-DR − cells. An increased monocyte count and increases in CD14 + HLA-DR − cells after surgery were plotted individually, and an approximately straight line was depicted ( n = 32, p < 0.0001, r 2 = 0.57, Y = 12.7 + 1.1 X ). The relationship was analyzed by Pearson’s correlation coefficient ( r )
Immunosuppressive function of CD14+ HLA-DR− cells
To analyze the immunosuppressive function of myeloid cells, we used whole CD14 + cells in peripheral blood obtained from GC patients on POD1. The production of IFNγ from purified CD8 T cells was markedly suppressed when cells were co-cultured with purified CD14 + cells and stimulated, but not when they were co-cultured with CD15 + cells (Fig. 4 a) nor pre-operative CD14 + cells (Supplementary Fig. 4b). The suppressive function of CD14 + HLA-DR − cells purified from peripheral blood obtained on POD1 was then investigated. When purified CD8 T cells were co-cultured with CD14 + HLA-DR − cells stimulated by CD3/CD28 beads, IFNγ-producing T cells decreased significantly by 50%. This decrease was smaller when T cells were co-cultured with CD14 + HLA-DR + cells (Fig. 4 b). The production of IDO and arginase, which suppress T cell function and induce other suppressive cells, was analyzed. Stronger cytosolic expression of IDO and arginase was observed in CD14 + HLA-DR − cells compared to that in CD14 + HLA-DR + cells purified from peripheral blood obtained on POD1 (Fig. 4 c). Fig. 4 Immunosuppressive function of myeloid cells. A suppression assay was performed with CD14 + , CD15 + cells ( a ) and CD14 + HLA-DR − , CD14 + HLA-DR + cells ( b ) obtained on POD1 and purified. A total of 1 × 10 4 cells/well of purified CD8 T cells were co-cultured with purified autologous suppressor cells at the ratio indicated below each bar and then stimulated. The relative rate of IFNγ-producing CD8 T cells is shown. Assays were performed on three patients using triplicate wells, and representative data are shown. Bars indicate the mean ± SD. ** p < 0.01 to the control. The production of IDO and arginase by CD14 + HLA-DR − and CD14 + HLA-DR + cells obtained on POD1 was detected by intracellular staining and flow cytometry ( c ). The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of IDO and frequency of arginase + cells were compared individually in 10 and 6 patients, respectively. ** p < 0.01
Increased monocyte count was an independent marker for the prognosis of GC patients
We retrospectively investigated whether the increased monocyte count was an independent immune-related factor for the prognosis of patients among several immunosuppressive and clinicopathological variants in the peri-operative period. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed on RFS and OS of the 278 GC patients retrospectively. Univariate analysis revealed that high albumin level, distal gastrectomy, a laparoscopic approach, low TN stages, post-operative complications, a high pre-operative monocyte count and a low increased monocyte count were roughly associated with RFS ( p < 0.1, Table 1 ). Multivariate analysis between these factors showed that a high pre-operative monocyte count and a low increased monocyte count were independent variants for RFS (Table 1 ). In these analyses, relationships were not observed among high pre-operative monocytes, low increased monocyte counts, and OS (Supplementary Tables 2, 3). In addition, RFS analysis using the increased monocyte count combined with the pre-operative monocyte count indicated poor prognosis among stage 2 and 3 GC patients ( p = 0.0093 and 0.063, respectively, Supplementary Fig. 5).
Discussion
After curative surgical resection, relapse may result from residual cancer locally or in other organs. In general, smaller cancers are more markedly eliminated by the immune system in both mice and humans [ ], which is supported by recent studies of tumor burden on biomarkers for immune therapies with ICIs [ , ]. The body of patients after surgery is in an inflammatory state, which fosters tumor cells and may weaken tumor immunity against residual cancer. Although pre- and post-operative C-reactive protein (CRP) was not associated with the prognosis of GC patients, monocyte count in peripheral blood was a prognostic factor of relapse in GC patients. Strong immunosuppressive functions were observed in CD14 + monocytes in peripheral blood obtained on POD1, and CD14 + HLA-DR − cells suppressed T cell activation more effectively than CD14 + HLA-DR + cells. Since the increased monocyte count was similar to the increased CD14 + HLA-DR − CD11b + CD33 + cell count with immunosuppressive functions, we characterized the increased monocytes as M-MDSCs. MDSCs in peripheral blood are associated with various cancers at a higher stage and poorer prognosis [ , , , , , ]. In GC, a few reports have examined MDSCs that were G-MDSCs, but not M-MDSCs, in peripheral blood [ , , ]. In a mouse model, surgical stress induces MDSCs, which is followed by the cancellation of anti-tumor immunity of antigen-specific T cells elicited by a cancer vaccine [ ]. The transfer of inflammatory blood monocytes accelerates tumor development in tumor-bearing mice [ ]. However, in humans, there is evidence of a close relationship between M-MDSCs and anti-tumor immunity. In melanoma patients, circulating M-MDSCs have a negative impact on prognosis and are negatively associated with the induction of NY-ESO-1 and Melan-A-specific T cells [ ]. Furthermore, biomarker studies of ICIs support the relationship between the prognosis of patients and M-MDSCs, which suggests that M-MDSCs are an immunosuppressive factor in tumor immunity [ , , ]. We found that M-MDSCs were associated with GC progression and patient prognosis.
MDSCs contribute to the formation of a pre-metastatic niche to recruit tumor cells [ ]. In a tumor-bearing mouse model, MDSCs are detected in the liver before metastasis, and many types of chemokines and chemokine receptors recruit MDSCs before tumor metastasis [ ]. TAMs are recruited from peripheral immature monocytes and also have a role in niche formation [ ]. We observed a close relationship between M-MDSCs and CD206 + TAMs in tumor tissue and HLA-DR − CD14 + cells in peripheral blood (data not shown). The contribution of post-operative M-MDSCs to the formation of a pre-metastatic niche may result in shorter RFS in GC patients.
In contrast to the post-operative increased monocyte count, the high pre-operative monocyte count in peripheral blood was an independent prognostic factor for GC patients with limited tumor stages of II and III. Krieg et al. reported that patients with a high frequency of CD14 + CD16 − classical monocytes in baseline peripheral blood have a longer OS in response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, and that these monocytes strongly express activation markers such as HLA-DR and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) [ ]. CD14 + cells before surgery had no effect on cytokine production by T cells, possibly because helper functions for anti-tumor immunity by classical monocytes, such as macrophages and DCs, may have overcome the immunosuppressive functions of the small number of M-MDSCs in the patients analyzed. A high neutrophil count was also not associated with an advanced tumor stage or poor prognosis in GC patients. Since neutrophils not only increase as a result of inflammation but also suppress tumor immunity, CD15 + cells, which account for most neutrophils, were collected from GC patients before and after surgery. However, an immunosuppressive effect of CD15 + cells on T cells was not observed. In addition, tumor cell factors, post-operative complications, and the indicators of physical condition may also serve as candidate biomarkers [ ].
In conclusion, we demonstrated that the monocyte count in the peri-operative period may be a biomarker for the prognosis of GC patients. Increased monocytes, which were similar to immunosuppressive M-MDSCs, negatively impacted tumor immunity and correlated with a poor prognosis. Therefore, an increased monocyte count has potential as a novel marker to select GC patients who might relapse after standard surgery.
