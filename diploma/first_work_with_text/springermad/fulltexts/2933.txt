Introduction
Perinatal hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is characterized by inadequate blood flow (ischemia) and oxygen (hypoxia) supply to the brain and other organs and affects 1–3 per 1,000 live births [ ]. The only approved treatment for moderate-to-severe HIE is therapeutic hypothermia, which reduces death and disability by 26% [ ]. Neuronal injury occurs in two phases: primary energy failure followed by the more injurious secondary energy failure. Primary energy failure is characterized by acute depletion in oxygen and energy substrates, leading to cessation of aerobic cellular metabolism and deficiency of adenosine triphosphate [ ]. To some extent, these deficits can be counteracted by successful neonatal resuscitation as normal cerebral perfusion is re-established. This short recovery period is followed by the secondary energy failure, which begins 6–12 h after the initial insult and can last up to 72 h [ , ]. Neuronal injury during the secondary energy failure is caused by myriad events including cytotoxic edema, release of excitatory neurotransmitters, oxidative stress and inflammation. The severity of neurocognitive deficits seen in infants with HIE correlates with the severity of the secondary energy failure [ , ]. Therapeutic hypothermia ameliorates or lessens further brain injury during the secondary energy failure if applied within 6 h of birth and continued for 72 h.
Despite implementation of therapeutic hypothermia as standard-of-care treatment for moderate-to-severe HIE, nearly half of all cooled neonates still die or sustain severe neurologic impairment [ , , ]. Trials are exploring the possibility of adding neuroprotective agents in conjunction with therapeutic hypothermia to further improve outcomes, specifically targeting derangements that might be present in these infants during hypothermia therapy. A better understanding of cerebral metabolism during the secondary energy failure would greatly help the development and guide application of these therapies. The typical clinical practice is to obtain MRI at 5–14 days of age, after completion of therapeutic hypothermia, to determine the extent of neuronal injury and provide prognostic counseling to families. However, this is beyond the time window to augment therapeutic hypothermia with adjuvant neuroprotective agents because many metabolic derangements have normalized and long-term studies have shown suboptimal prognostic correlation. Furthermore, even some neonates with a normal conventional MRI have significant neurocognitive deficits at 2 years of age [ ]. A quantitative earlier method of measuring brain tissue viability and severity of injury is needed to better understand the mechanisms of injury during the secondary energy failure, develop and guide application of additional neuroprotective therapies and more accurately counsel families regarding prognosis.
Magnetic resonance H 1 -spectroscopy has been used to investigate neonatal brain injury for more than 3 decades [ , , , ]. MR spectroscopy measures concentrations of cerebral metabolites to elucidate derangements in cellular metabolism. Early studies of neonatal HIE, prior to therapeutic hypothermia, report increased lactate, decreased N-acetylaspartate (NAA), decreased choline and decreased phosphocreatine to be predictive of poor neurodevelopmental outcome [ ]. Additionally, metabolite concentrations showing biphasic elevations immediately after birth and then again hours later were pivotal in the discovery of the secondary energy failure. However, there is limited understanding of how MR spectroscopy metabolite patterns are affected by therapeutic hypothermia when applied during the early secondary energy failure. Thus the aim of this study was to assess brain metabolism using MR spectroscopy in a cohort of neonates with moderate-to-severe HIE at two critical time points: during the secondary energy failure within 18–24 h of initiating active therapeutic hypothermia and post-therapeutic hypothermia at 5–6 days of age. We also compared metabolite concentrations between neonates with moderate and severe HIE 18–24 h after beginning therapeutic hypothermia.
Materials and methods
The Baylor College of Medicine institutional review board approved this study and we obtained written consent from parents prior to study enrollment.
Patient selection and therapeutic hypothermia
From December 2015 through April 2018, 14 neonates delivered at ≥36 weeks’ gestation with moderate-to-severe HIE were prospectively enrolled from the Texas Children’s Hospital neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). All children who met institutional criteria for therapeutic hypothermia received active whole-body cooling for 72 h at 33.5±0.5°C using the CritiCool System and Cure Wrap blanket (Mennen Medical Ltd., Feasterville-Trevose, PA). Therapeutic hypothermia was initiated within 6 h of birth and continuously servo-controlled to the neonate’s esophageal temperature.
Institutional criteria per the Baylor College of Medicine Section of Neonatology guidelines (2017–2018) for therapeutic hypothermia [ ], modified from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Research Network whole-body hypothermia trial [ ], were as follows: ≥36 weeks’ gestation at birth and biochemical evidence of a hypoxic–ischemic event (pH≤7 or base deficit ≥16 mmol/L on an umbilical cord gas or a blood gas within the first hour after birth; or, if no blood gas was available or pH was 7.01–7.15, or base deficit was 10–15.9 mmol/L, and there was presence of an acute perinatal event and an Apgar score <5 at 10 min of age; or need for resuscitation for ≥10 min); and evidence of moderate-to-severe encephalopathy (seizures or abnormalities in three of six modified Sarnat criteria [ ] on physical exam).
Infants were excluded if major congenital anomalies were present or if they were too unstable to be transported from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) to the MRI suite (actively requiring fluid resuscitation for hypotension, >80% inspired oxygen, or blood product transfusion for active bleeding at the time of MRI).
Classification of hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy severity
At the completion of therapeutic hypothermia, a neonatologist and pediatric neurologist who were blinded to the results of the first MRI (during therapeutic hypothermia) conducted a comprehensive neurologic exam and reviewed the clinical course and continuous electroencephalography (EEG) to assign a final comprehensive HIE severity grade of mild, moderate or severe. All neonates in this cohort had moderate or severe encephalopathy and our analysis was conducted according to this final severity classification.
Neonates classified as having moderate HIE had mild to moderately abnormal neurologic examinations (hypotonia, weak suck reflex) at the completion of therapeutic hypothermia and EEG patterns of depressed background activity and lack of differentiation without evidence of seizures. Those classified as severe HIE had significant multi-organ injury (renal failure, prolonged need for mechanical ventilation and inotropic support), persistently abnormal neurologic examinations (lack of any spontaneous movement, nonreactive pupils, absent neonatal reflexes, need for gastrostomy tube) and occurrence of multiple seizures requiring antiepileptic therapy.
Magnetic resonance imaging transport
A multidisciplinary transport team consisting of one neonatology fellow, two neonatal nurses, one respiratory therapist and one patient care technician transported neonates from the NICU to the MRI suite. Neonates were wrapped in the MRI-compatible Cure Wrap blanket, clamped with retained cool water at the time of NICU departure and reconnected upon arrival at the MRI suite. Total time to travel the 480-m distance was approximately 7 min. Active therapeutic hypothermia was maintained within 33.5±0.5°C throughout the entire MRI and was manually adjusted to the neonate’s continuous rectal temperature monitoring. Blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and arterial oxygen saturation were also continuously monitored. Eight neonates were intubated during the therapeutic hypothermia MRI and two during the post-therapeutic hypothermia MRI. All neonates received continuous morphine infusions (10–20 mcg/kg/h) for the duration of therapeutic hypothermia per unit protocol. After the early MRI, continuous temperature monitoring was converted back to esophageal mode, neonates were transported back to the NICU to complete 72 total hours of therapeutic hypothermia, and then they were rewarmed at 0.5°C per hour to reach normothermia (>36.5°C) over 4–6 h. The entire study protocol was repeated post-therapeutic hypothermia at 5–6 days of age.
Magnetic resonance imaging acquisition
Studies were performed on an Achieva 3.0-tesla (T) MRI (Philips Medical Systems, Best, The Netherlands) with a 32-channel phased-array SENSE (sensitivity encoding) head coil as a receiver and main quadrature body coil as a transmitter. MR spectroscopy was performed with single-voxel spatially localized point-resolved spectroscopy (SVS-PRESS). Two regions, basal ganglia and periventricular white matter, were selected based on T1-weighted axial images (Figs. 1 and 2 ). Short echo times of 35–38 ms were obtained in the basal ganglia and white matter. Remaining parameters were as follows: voxel size, 15x15x15 mm 3 ; repetition time (TR), 2,000 ms; scan averages, 128; water suppression, CHESS (chemical shift selective pulses); shim, pencil-beam; spectral bandwidth, 2,000 Hz; scan time, 4 min 52 s. Automatic reference scans without water suppression were also obtained at the same location for water signal measurement. The acquisition protocol included other sequences not used in this study, for a total scanning time of 45 min. Fig. 1 T1-weighted magnetic resonance images during therapeutic hypothermia of a 1-day-old male neonate with severe hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy are shown. Sagittal ( a ), axial ( b ) and coronal ( c ) images demonstrate voxel placement in the right basal ganglia.

Magnetic resonance spectroscopy post-processing
MR spectroscopy data were transferred to a workstation for post-processing. The data were processed by fitting to a linear combination model (LCModel: v. 6.2–1G; Stephen Provencher Inc., Oakville, ON, Canada). LCModel uses a linear combination of an empirically derived basis set of metabolites and lipid resonances expected in the brain to determine the concentration of each metabolite seen in a spectrum. The quality of spectra was dependent on subject head movement. Quality control was carried out for each spectrum before further analysis based on criteria: signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) >5, estimated full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) <0.05 ppm, and coefficient of variation for the estimated metabolite concentrations (Cramer-Rao lower bounds) <30%. To ensure that the quality control criteria implemented were reasonable, spectra were also checked visually by one of the authors (M.S.C., 8 years of experience).
The LCModel generated a metabolite spectrum using prior information incorporated in a basis set consisting of a separate spectrum for each metabolite that was quantified. Eight total metabolites were quantified as ratios over creatine (Cr) + phosphocreatine (PCr): glutamate (Glu), glutamate+glutamine (Glu+Gln), glycerophosphorylcholine+phosphatidylcholine (GPC+PCh), glutathione (GSH), inositol (Ins), N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and N-acetylaspartate + N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAA+NAAG).
Statistics
We used paired t -tests to compare metabolite concentration ratios obtained from MRIs during therapeutic hypothermia vs. post-therapeutic hypothermia. We used Student’s t test to compare children with moderate vs. severe HIE in terms of metabolite concentration ratios and continuous demographic variables, while we used the Fisher exact test to compare these groups in terms of categorical variables. Apgar scores were compared using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. We used SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) for data analysis. Statistical significance was set at P ≤0.05.
Results
Study population
Of the 14 neonates prospectively enrolled, 2 required 100% inspired oxygen because of pulmonary hypertension and were clinically deemed too unstable to be transported to the MRI suite during therapeutic hypothermia and were therefore excluded from the study. The first neonate enrolled was scanned on a 1.5-T magnet instead of 3-T during the post-therapeutic hypothermia study and was also excluded. Data presented next represent a total of 11 neonates (7 boys and 4 girls). The initial HIE classification upon admission to the NICU was moderate for all 11 children. At the completion of therapeutic hypothermia, 3 were reclassified as having severe HIE and 8 remained with moderate HIE. Two of the three neonates with severe HIE died prior to 5 days of age as a result of multi-organ failure refractory to maximal intensive care, and thus did not have a post-therapeutic hypothermia MRI.
Maternal and neonatal demographics, pregnancy and delivery characteristics, neonatal anthropometrics and umbilical cord gas values are provided in Table 1 . There were no significant differences in demographic characteristics between neonates with moderate and those with severe HIE.

Comparison of metabolite ratios in moderate vs. severe HIE during therapeutic hypothermia
In the basal ganglia, neonates with severe HIE had significantly lower concentrations of GPC+PCh (0.28±0.05 mmol/L vs. 0.38±0.06 mmol/L, P =0.02), NAA (0.62±0.08 mmol/L vs. 0.72±0.05 mmol/L, P =0.02) and NAA+NAAG (0.66±0.11 mmol/L vs. 0.77±0.06 mmol/L, P =0.05) compared to neonates with moderate HIE. Similarly, in the white matter, neonates with severe HIE had lower GPC+PCh (0.35±0.13 mmol/L vs. 0.48±0.04 mmol/L, P =0.02; Table 2 ).

Comparison of metabolite ratios between therapeutic hypothermia and post-therapeutic hypothermia imaging
All subjects
Changes in basal ganglia and white matter metabolite ratios of all 11 children during therapeutic hypothermia vs. post-therapeutic hypothermia are shown in Table 3 . In the basal ganglia, NAA decreased between scans (0.69±0.07 mmol/L to 0.63±0.07 mmol/L, P =0.01) while white matter GPC+PCh increased (0.42±0.08 mmol/L to 0.50±0.04 mmol/L, P <0.01). Also, there was a notable decreasing trend of GSH and inositol detected in both basal ganglia and white matter ( P =0.09 and P= 0.11 for GSH in the basal ganglia and white matter, respectively, and P =0.11 and P= 0.09 for inositol, respectively).

Moderate HIE
Changes in metabolite concentrations during therapeutic hypothermia vs. post-therapeutic hypothermia in neonates with moderate HIE alone showed similar findings to the composite group of all subjects (Table 4 ). Basal ganglia NAA significantly decreased (0.72±0.04 mmol/L to 0.63±0.07 mmol/L, P =0.01), and trends were noted of decreasing GSH ( P =0.07) and increasing glutamate ( P =0.09) as well. In the white matter GPC+PCh significantly increased (0.44±0.07 mmol/L to 0.49±0.04 mmol/L, P =0.02) between MRIs.

Severe HIE
Of the three neonates with severe HIE, only one survived to postnatal day 5 to complete the post-therapeutic hypothermia MRI. Therefore, analysis of metabolite changes between MRIs in neonates with severe HIE alone or compared to neonates with moderate HIE was not possible.
Discussion
In this study we assessed cerebral metabolic derangements in a cohort of neonates diagnosed with moderate and severe HIE during active therapeutic hypothermia and post-therapeutic hypothermia at 5–6 days of age. We report basal ganglia and white matter MR spectroscopy measurements as early as 18–24 h after beginning therapeutic hypothermia, during the secondary energy failure. We observed a strong association between decreased NAA, GPC and GPC+PCh concentrations, and greater severity of HIE.
NAA decreases post-therapeutic hypothermia and is decreased in severe HIE
NAA is synthesized by neuronal mitochondria and has long been considered a marker of neuronal viability and health [ , ]. Although its precise function remains unclear, it is believed to be involved in the lipogenesis of myelin, ion balance, neuromodulation and fatty acid metabolism in the brain [ ]. Decreases in cerebral NAA measured by MR spectroscopy have been associated with poor neurologic outcome [ , , , , ]. Gideon et al. [ ] reported decreased NAA within 6–24 h after acute stroke in adults. NAA remained low at 1 week and 4 weeks post stroke, with the greatest decline at the center of the insult and a lack of NAA recovery over time [ ]. In animal models of HIE, decreases in NAA 24 h post insult were strongly associated with severe pathological findings [ ]. Other authors concur that neonates with HIE have decreased basal ganglia and white matter NAA, which correlates with poor neurodevelopmental outcomes [ , , , , ].
In agreement with prior studies from the pre-cooling era, we report a decline in basal ganglia NAA concentrations over the first 5–6 days of age in all 11 neonates and in the subset of neonates with moderate HIE. We also report the association of lower NAA detected as early as 18–24 h after initiating therapeutic hypothermia with severity of HIE. We interpret these findings to represent a greater degree of hypoxic–ischemic injury and disruption in neuronal aerobic metabolism with resultant mitochondrial failure in this subgroup. Interestingly, in the limited number of studies reporting MR spectroscopy during therapeutic hypothermia there are conflicting results [ , , ]. Wisnowski et al. [ ] obtained MR spectroscopy in 31 neonates with varying degrees of HIE during therapeutic hypothermia at 46–69 h of age and post-therapeutic hypothermia at 5–8 days of age and reported increasing NAA between the two scans. Barta et al. [ ] obtained MR spectroscopy within the first 96 h in 51 neonates with HIE treated with therapeutic hypothermia and found early decreased NAA to correlate with poor neurodevelopmental outcome at 18–26 months of age. Similarly, Shibasaki et al. [ ] obtained MR spectroscopy at 18–96 h of age in 25 neonates receiving therapeutic hypothermia and reported decreased NAA to predict death and neurodevelopmental impairment at 18–22 months.
GPC+PCh is decreased in severe HIE and increases post-therapeutic hypothermia
GPC and PCh are choline-containing phospholipids present in cell membranes, and decreased levels are considered markers of decreased cellularity or apoptosis [ ]. It is well known that decreased choline concentrations correlate with poor neurodevelopmental outcome in neonates with HIE [ , , , ]. In our experience, the lowest GPC+PCh concentrations in both studied regions were seen in severe HIE and this difference was readily apparent within 18–24 h of initiating therapeutic hypothermia. We also report an increase in white matter GPC+PCh from therapeutic hypothermia to post-therapeutic hypothermia. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms of this increase and how it synchronizes with the transition from apoptosis and cell lysis during the acute injury to the beginning of the recovery phase of improving aerobic metabolism and reconstruction of cell membranes.
Notable trends in GSH, inositol and glutamate
GSH, a free radical scavenger and endogenous antioxidant, decreased from therapeutic hypothermia to post-therapeutic hypothermia in both studied regions. Wisnowski et al. [ ] reported decreasing GSH concentrations in the thalamus and white matter between therapeutic hypothermia and post-therapeutic hypothermia MRIs, proposing how this could be a target for adjuvant neuroprotective therapies. We detected the same trends in basal ganglia and white matter and agree that the increasing GSH response is an area that warrants further investigation because it likely represents an innate attempt to mitigate the free radical mechanisms of injury known to occur in HIE.
Brain osmolality is known to increase after ischemia because of open sodium channels and resultant sodium influx [ ]. Inositol’s primary role is thought to be a modulator of cell volume in periods of persistent osmotic stress [ ]. While others have reported a correlation between increased inositol and poor neurodevelopmental outcome [ , , ], little is known about the evolution of inositol after neonatal HIE. Here we report a decreasing trend in inositol in both studied regions from therapeutic hypothermia to post-therapeutic hypothermia. This correlates with the increasing incidence and severity of cerebral edema and osmotic stress over the first 5–6 days after hypoxic–ischemic insult.
We speculate that the trend of increasing glutamate concentration from therapeutic hypothermia to post-therapeutic hypothermia in neonates with moderate HIE might represent an early benefit of hypothermia. Given that glutamate has numerous roles as a neuropeptide, excitatory neurotransmitter and energy compound within the tricarboxylic acid cycle of oxidative metabolism, the exact mechanism of hypothermia’s effect is likely multifactorial. Our findings are in agreement with those of Wisnowski et al. [ ], who noted a truly significant increase in glutamate from therapeutic hypothermia to post. Larger prospective studies are needed to validate these findings and determine the true magnitude of effect.
The clinical relevance of these findings is two-fold. An early understanding and detection of metabolic changes during the secondary energy failure could guide the individualized application of adjuvant neuroprotective therapies targeting specific metabolic deficiencies. Additionally, the ability to predict the severity of brain injury and neurodevelopmental outcome within the first 24 h would significantly improve the prognostic counseling for families of these critically ill neonates. With larger studies it might even become possible to use patterns of metabolic derangements to estimate the timing of perinatal insult in children presenting without a known sentinel event.
An important strength of this study is the precise, uniform timing of MRI acquisition at 18–24 h after initiating therapeutic hypothermia and at 5–6 days of age post therapeutic hypothermia. Prior studies have large variations in the timing of MRI (1–10 days), making interpretations of metabolite changes difficult given the rapid evolution in cerebral metabolism after ischemic injury and heterogeneous stages of recovery [ , , ]. Additionally, the MRI transport team ensured a high integrity of continuous therapeutic hypothermia throughout the MRI study with maintenance of full neonatal intensive care.
There are some limitations of this study as well. These results were obtained from a small cohort of subjects. Nevertheless, given the novelty of our findings, our sample size is similar to initial publications using MR spectroscopy in neonatal HIE [ , , , , ]. We were also limited by the availability of the MRI scanner given our strict time frame to obtain the first MRI at 18–24 h after beginning therapeutic hypothermia. Because many neonates with HIE are born emergently during the night and weekend, often the timing of the first MRI during therapeutic hypothermia would have been performed during night shifts or over the weekend. Unfortunately, MRI technicians and nursing staff were not available outside of typical business hours to perform research MRIs, limiting our ability to enroll more neonates. Also, given the nature of HIE, some of our neonates did not survive long enough to obtain a post-therapeutic hypothermia MRI. Finally, enrolled infants were not old enough at the time of this report to obtain neurodevelopmental follow-up testing; when they are, correlation to conventional MRI injury scoring will also be completed.
Conclusion
We report the application of MR spectroscopy to assess the metabolic changes in a cohort of neonates with moderate and severe HIE early during the secondary energy failure (18–24 h after therapeutic hypothermia) and post therapeutic hypothermia at 5–6 days of age. There are limited data available on the utility of MR spectroscopy obtained early during therapeutic hypothermia for discerning between moderate and severe HIE. We report an association of decreased NAA and GPC+PCh with severity of HIE and short-term neurologic outcome. These results could be of great value in applying individualized adjuvant therapies targeting specific metabolic deficiencies in neonates with HIE in combination with therapeutic hypothermia to possibly improve survival and neurodevelopmental outcome. Our results need to be validated in larger cohort studies, and metabolic changes detected at these time points need to be understood in the context of neurodevelopmental outcomes.
