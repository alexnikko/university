Introduction
One of the most important unwanted effects of chemotherapy drugs is cardiotoxicity that needs to be avoided, carefully weighted against expected benefits and managed. Drug-induced cardiotoxicity includes a broad range of adverse effects on heart function and structure, including conduction impairment, QT interval prolongation, impaired cardiac contractility, chamber dilatation, myocardial fibrosis and hypertrophy. The resultant clinical manifestations include arrhythmia, valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathy, heart failure and even sudden death [ ].
The causal effect of specific chemotherapy drugs, like anthracyclines [ ] and trastuzumab [ ] and of radiotherapy [ ] are well known. However, the cardiotoxicity of other drugs, like tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), is less well established.
Tyrosine kinase (TK) is an enzyme that acts as crucial mediator of cellular signal transduction regulating diverse cellular processes such as cell-cycle progression, metabolism, transcription and apoptosis. Therapies targeted to inhibit the activity of certain TKs have helped to remarkably advance cancer therapy in recent years [ ]. TKIs fall into two general classes: (1) humanized monoclonal antibodies directed against TK receptors or their ligands and (2) small-molecule TK antagonists [ ].
Besides dermatologic, hematopoietic and other common side effects like nausea, diarrhea, among others, more recent studies shown that some TKIs have cardiotoxic effects, ranging from asymptomatic to clinical heart failure [ ]. However, the preclinical safety evaluation of TKIs did not predict cardiovascular risk and subsequent clinical trials with TKIs did not include predefined cardiac endpoint. Even in the recent position paper of European Society of Cardiology regarding cardiac toxicity of cancer treatments, despite the awareness of possible cardiovascular effects of TKIs, no standard evaluation was preconized [ ].
Moreover, the TKI-induced cardiotoxicity seems to be not a class adverse effect, but occur with specific drugs. While some TKIs such as pazopanib [ ], sunitinib [ ] and sorafenib [ ] were associated with a relatively high rate of adverse cardiac events in the clinic, the cardiotoxicity of others like imatinib or nilotinib remains unclear [ , ].
The TKIs such as imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib are the standard treatment for Philadelphia-positive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) [ , , ], which is a rare disease with an annual incidence of 1–16/100,000 habitants [ ]. The TKIs have shown impressive results in the disease remission, with high survival rates and in some cases, possibly leading to the disease cure.
We aim to evaluate the cardiotoxicity effect of the two TKIs most used in our center—nilotinib and imatinib—assessed by clinical, analytical and echocardiographic parameters.
Methods
Single-center prospective study of consecutive patients diagnosed with CML who started a TKI was conducted during 2015. The patients were assessed before treatment and at a 1-year follow-up.
Inclusion Criteria All patients with age ≥ 18 years, diagnosed with CML and with indication to initiate TKI therapy. After informed consent, all patients who planned to be treated by TKIs for the first time in hematology department between January 2015 and December 2015 were evaluated. Patients were included in the study after informed consent.
Exclusion Criteria Patients with know heart failure, more than mild hypertension, history of coronary artery disease, more than mild valvular heart disease, other structural heart disease, prior history of chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity or previous radiotherapy were excluded.
Basal Evaluation: Prior to TKI Therapy
(1) Clinical Evaluation Patients underwent clinical evaluation and were assessed by the Minnesota quality of life questionnaire (QOL-M); (2) Laboratorial Evaluation Measurement of NT-proBNP and cystatin-C; (3) Transthoracic Echocardiogram Evaluation All patients underwent conventional echocardiography and tissue Doppler imaging (TDI). Standard 2D echocardiogram was complemented by myocardial deformation study by speckle tracking. All echocardiograms were performed using Vivid-7 (General Electric, Milwaukee, USA); two operators performed the measurements off-line in a Echopac system (General Electric, Milwaukee, USA) according to the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging (EACVI) and American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) recommendations [ , ]. The following parameters were assessed: left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left ventricular telediastolic volume (LVTDV) and end-systolic volumes; left atrium (LA) volume; tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE); evaluation of mitral inflow pattern with measurement of peak early filling ( E -wave) and late diastolic filling ( A -wave) velocities, the E / A ratio, deceleration time (DT) of early filling velocity; early diastolic mitral annular septal and lateral velocities ( e ′), E / e ′ ratio; and global longitudinal strain (GLS), global circumferential strain (GCS) and global radial strain (GRS).
The diagnosis of cardiac toxicity was defined accordingly to the ESC position paper on cancer treatments and cardiovascular toxicity [ ]: decrease in the LVEF of > 10%, to a value below the lower limit of normal, or a decrease in the GLS > 15% from baseline.
Follow-up
After 1 year of treatment, the patients were submitted to the evaluation of the same parameters (clinical, laboratorial and echocardiographic).
Statistical Analysis
All the data analysis was performed with SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 20.0. Continuous values are reported as mean ± standard deviation (SD) or median [interquartile range (IQR)], and categorical data are reported as number and percentage. The paired-sample t tests were used for the analyses of basal data and for changes after the treatment. The results with a p value < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
This study was approved by the Ethical Committee of Human Experimentation in our country and is in accordance with the current version of the Helsinki Declaration.
Results
Eleven consecutive patients with CML who started treatment with TKIs in 2015 were screened. No patient was excluded. The median age was 60.0 (55–66) years (only one patient was younger than 40 years old) and 63.6% were males. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients are presented in Table 1 . Seven patients were treated with imatinib and four with nilotinib (as first line treatment), with no significant differences between the two groups.

Clinical Evaluation and Biomarkers
At the baseline, all patients were in functional NYHA class I, with a median score in QOL-M of 21 (8–31). Median NT-proBNP and cystatin C were within normal range, respectively 46 (27–74) pg/mL and 0.9 (0.7–0.9) mg/dL.
After a median follow-up of 436 days (331–443), all patients maintained treatment with TKI and remained without clinical manifestations of heart failure and the mean QOL-M score did not change.
Moreover, biomarkers levels were not significantly different from baseline (Table 2 ).

During the follow-up, there were no differences regarding the LVEF, LA volume, E / A ratio, DT, septal e′ , lateral e′ , E / e′ ratio and TAPSE, as presented in Table 3 .
Regarding myocardial deformation, all patients presented with normal GLS, GCS and GRS [ ]. Moreover, there were no significant changes at follow-up.
Discussion
In comparison with other TKIs, imatinib and nilotinib have not been consistently associated with cardiotoxicity. To our knowledge, this is the first study to prospectively assess the myocardial function using conventional and myocardial deformation indices in patients treated with these TKIs, which are the standard treatment of CML. We found no significant changes in left ventricular function indices, and no cardiotoxicity was found using the established criteria currently proposed [ ].
In animals, imatinib administration was associated with induced ventricular myocyte death by necrosis, autophagy and apoptosis only above clinically used concentrations [ , ]. These effects seemed to be more severe in spontaneously hypertensive rats than in non-hypertensive rats [ ]. In 2012, a study including 30 patients with different hematologic conditions assesses left ventricular systolic and diastolic function of different TKIs (including imatinib). In this study, medication with TKIs proved to be safe to patients without predisposing factors for cardiotoxicity in short treatment intervals [ ]. Similarly, the seven patients submitted to imatinib treatment in our study did not experience any signs of clinical, laboratorial or echocardiographic signs of cardiac impairment and no subclinical myocardial dysfunction was detected by myocardial deformation analysis.
Regarding nilotinib, this was a drug developed to surmount resistance or intolerance to imatinib in patients with CML [ ]. Recent studies have shown that nilotinib induces sensitization to anticancer agents by blocking the functions of ABCB1/P-glycoprotein in multidrug resistance [ ], and co-administration of nilotinib with doxorubicin dramatic increases systemic and intracellular concentration of doxorubicin with a concomitantly increased risk of cardiotoxicity. However, nilotinib per se was not associated with cardiotoxicity [ ]. In our study, with only four patients treated with this drug, there were no clinical, laboratorial or echocardiographic signs of cardiac impairment and no subclinical myocardial dysfunction was detected by myocardial deformations analysis.
Limitations
This study was limited by the size of the population as well as being single-center study. As a pilot study, our results indicate that a larger multicenter study should be performed, in order to confirm these promising findings.
Additionally, studies with longer follow-up may be necessary to determine potentially late cardiotoxic effects or the cardiac impact of prolonged treatments.
It is also important that these two TKIs were not associated with cardiotoxicity in patients without cardiovascular disease. So, in patients with other comorbidities, the cardiac secondary effects can be more pronounced.
Finally, pharmacovigilance programs, with report of adverse events, and local and national registries of patients taking TKIs play a critical role ensuring ongoing safety of these drugs.
Conclusion
In patients without previous cardiovascular disease, 1-year treatment with imatinib and nilotinib seems to be safe to the heart, without clinical, laboratorial or echocardiographic evidence of cardiotoxicity. Even in strain analysis, no subclinical myocardial dysfunction was observed. Because of the low global incidence of CML, these promising findings need to be confirmed in with a larger multicenter study.
