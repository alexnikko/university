Introduction
Acute myocardial infarction is an important ischemic heart disease and a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide [ ]. It is the acute condition of myocardial necrosis that occurs as a result of imbalance between coronary blood supply and myocardial demand. Clinical markers of myocardial necrosis and dysfunction include blood pressure, heart rate and electrocardiographic (ECG) changes and left ventricular (LV) dysfunction accompanied with increased serum levels of cardiac-specific proteins. Cardiac troponins are frequently associated with myocardial infarction and inflammation-related proteins at elevated levels with heart attack [ ]. The animal model of isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction presents an important endorsed technique for studying the effects of several potential cardioprotective bioactive compounds [ ].
Isoproterenol [1-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-2-isopropylaminoethanol hydrochloride] is a synthetic catecholamine and β-adrenergic agonist used in inframaximal doses to regulate heart function. However, the administration of isoproterenol in surpramaximal doses could induce severe stress in the myocardium through the depletion of the cardiomyocytes energy reserve which is resulting in irreversible cellular injury and ultimately infract like necrosis [ , ]. Many synthetic drugs are used for the management of heart attack but they are not free from side effects. Hence, several studies have focused on identifying new therapeutic approaches to prevent myocardial infarction.
Recently, greater attention has been focused on the phenols as effective bioactive compounds that protect cells or molecules from myocardial damage. In this regard, hydroxytyrosol (HT), a natural phenol present in large amounts in all parts of olive trees ( Olea europaea ), has been found to be a potent antioxidant and hypocholesterolemic agent in various animal models of disease including dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis and diabetes [ , , ].
Polyphenols are excellent cardioprotectors. Hence, we suggested that HT may have a cardioprotective effect. The purpose of the current study was designed to investigate the protective effect of the oral pretreatment of HT on experimentally induced myocardial infarction in Wistar rats.
Materials and Methods
Chemicals
Lipase kit was purchased from Biolabo reagents France, HT [2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)ethanol] was obtained from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI, USA); the purity was ≥98 %. Isoproterenol hydrochloride powder was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) kit was purchased from Trinity, UK. The remaining chemicals used were of analytical grade.
Animals
The essays of this study were conducted on adult male Wistar rats, weighting 260 ± 10 g, which were obtained from the local Central Pharmacy, Tunisia. All rats were kept in an environmentally controlled breeding room (temperature: 20 ± 2 °C; humidity: 60 ± 5 %; 12-h dark/light cycle) where they had standard diets and free access to tap water. The experimental protocols were conducted in accordance with the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals issued by the University of Sfax, Tunisia, and approved by the Committee of Animal Ethics.
Induction of Experimental Myocardial Infarction
Isoproterenol was dissolved in normal saline and injected to rats (100 mg/kg body weight) and injected subcutaneously at an interval of 24 h for 2 days to induce experimental myocardial infarction [ ]. Animals were killed 48 h after the first dose of isoproterenol.
Experimental Protocols
After acclimatization, the animals were randomly divided into the following groups consisting of eight rats each: Group I: (Control) rats received standard laboratory diet and drinking saline water ad libitum and served as a control; Group II: (Isop) rats received saline water for 7 days and at the 6th day subcutaneously injected with isoproterenol (100 mg/kg, subcutaneously injected, once at an interval of 24 h for two consecutive days); Group III: (Isop + HT1) rats pretreated with hydroxytyrosol (2 mg/kg bw; gastric gavages, respectively) for 7 days and at the 6th day subcutaneously injected with isoproterenol (100 mg/kg bw) for two consecutive days; Group IV: (Isop + HT2) rats received HT (5 mg/kg bw) for 7 days and were injected subcutaneously with isoproterenol (100 mg/kg bw) on day 6th and 7th. All rats are fasted overnight but had free access to water at the last administration of the drug.
After the 7-days induction, the animals were weighted and killed by decapitation in order to minimize the handling stress, and the trunk blood collected. The serum was prepared by centrifugation (1500× g , 15 min, 4 °C), frozen and stored at −20 °C until analysis. Immediately after killing, the heart was excised out, washed with saline and fixed in fixed in a Bouin solution for 24 h and then embedded in paraffin. Sections of 5 µm thickness were stained with hematoxylin–eosin. The slides were photographed with an Olympus U-TU1X-2 camera connected to an Olympus CX41 microscope (Tokyo, Japan).
Measurement of Blood Pressure by Noninvasive Method
Twenty-four hours after the second injection of isoproterenol, blood pressures were measured using noninvasive blood pressure Monitor (CODA™ Surgical Monitor, USA) which consists of placing a cuff on the animal’s tail to occlude the blood flow. The pressure was raised and then slowly released. The cuff pressure when the pulse signal reappears is intended as the systolic pressure. The cuff pressure when the pulse signal level recovers its initial level is intended as diastolic pressure.
Electrocardiography
Twenty-four hours after the second dose of isoproterenol, rats of all the groups were anesthetized with ketamine hydrochloride (100 mg/kg bw) intraperitoneally. Needle electrodes were inserted under the skin of the animals in lead II position. ECG recordings were made using veterinary electrocardiograph (ECG VET 110, Biocare, China).
Biochemical Analysis
After killing, the heart was dissected out, immediately washed in ice-cold saline and a homogenate was prepared in 0.1 M Tris–HCl buffer (pH 7.4). Homogenate was centrifuged, and supernatant was used for the assay of marker enzymes. The collected serum was used for the determination of serum activity of lipase and ACE, the cardiac marker enzymes as creatinine kinase-MB (CK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alanine transaminase (ALT) and troponin-I rates were measured in frozen aliquots of serum by standardized enzymatic procedures using commercial kits from (Biolabo, France) on an automatic biochemistry analyzer (Vitalab Flexor E, USA) using commercially available standard enzymatic kits (Biolabo, France). Serum lipids level of triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (T-Ch), high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-c) and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-c) were measured using the corresponding commercial kits (Biolabo, France) on an automatic biochemistry analyzer (Kenza, France) at the clinic pathological laboratory of Sidi Bouzid Hospital. Serum LDL-cholesterol concentration was determined according to formula: LDL_cholesterol = Total cholesterol_(Triglycerides/5) − (HDL_cholesterol) performed by Friedewal et al. [ ].
Statistical Analysis
Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Determinations were performed from eight animals per group, and differences were examined by a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Fisher test (Stat View). * P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Effect of Hydroxytyrosol (HT) on Heart Weight to Body Weight Ration of Experimental Rats
As shown in Table 1 , there was no significant difference in the body weight between the groups observed. Isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarcted rats exhibited significant increases in heart weight and the heart weight to body weight ration as compared to control rats ( P < 0.05). However, in response to HT1 and HT2, the infarcted rats showed significant ( P < 0.05) decrease in the heart weight by 17 and 37 %, respectively, as compared to untreated myocardial infarcted rats.

Electrocardiogram Patterns of Normal and Experimental Animals
Control animals showed normal ECG pattern with normal heart rate (375 ± 13.92 bpm). While infarcted rats evidenced a significant ( P < 0.05) increase in heart rate (430 ± 11.65 bpm) which became irregular, remarkable elevation of ST-segment (wave of Paradee) and QT interval along with no identifiable P wave as compared to the normal animals (Figs. 1 , 2 ). However, oral pre- and co-treatment of isoproterenol-induced rats with 2 mg/kg of HT showed acceleration in heart rate (430 ± 12.34 bpm), remaining regular sinus with the appearance of a discrete ST-elevation. Else, an aspect of electrical alternating was observed (alternating between QRS ample and QRS less ample). Though, the HT2 group exhibited sinus rhythm not accelerated relative to healthy control (375 ± 10.31 bpm), with no ST-segment elevation, no alternating electric sinus and rare atrial premature as compared to groups II and III.

Effect of Hydroxytyrosol on Hemodynamic Function
As shown in Table 2 , significant decreases in systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure were observed in isoproterenol-induced rats as compared to control group ( P < 0.05). The pre- and co-treatment of infarcted rats with HT at 2 and 5 mg/kg significantly restored arterial pressure in a dose-dependent pattern.

Effect of Hydroxytyrosol on Serum Cardiac Markers
Table 3 indicated the variation of CK-MB and LDH both in serum and heart tissues and ALT, troponin-T in serum of control and experimental rats. The rats induced with isoproterenol evidenced a significant ( P < 0.05) increase in the serum levels CK-MB, ALT, LDH and troponin-T by 66, 112, 70 and 317 %, respectively, as compared to control rats associated with significant decrease in myocardium LDH and CK-MB, whereas pre- and co-treatment with HT (5 mg/kg bw) daily for 7 days significantly ( P < 0.05) decreased the levels of serum cardiac markers better than the administrated dose of 2 mg/kg of HT in isoproterenol-induced rats compared to untreated infarcted rats.

Histopathological Examination of Cardiac Tissues
The histopathological examination of heart tissues showed that control group of rats evidenced a normal myofibrillar structure without any infarction edema and inflammatory cells (Fig. 3 a). However, tissues from isoproterenol-treated rats revealed widespread myocardial structure disorder and subendocardial necrosis with loss of transverse striation and obvious leukocyte infiltration (Fig. 3 b) as compared to control group, whereas pretreatment with HT (2 and 5 mg/kg, respectively) exhibited marked improvement in isoproterenol-induced myocardial degeneration and inflammatory cells infiltration (Fig. 3 c, d).

Effect of Hydroxytyrosol on Serum Lipase Activity and Lipids Profile
As shown in Fig. 4 , the isoproterenol-induced group underwent a significant ( P < 0.05) increase in serum pancreatic lipase activity by 89 % which led to remarkable rise in serum levels of T-Ch, TG and LDL-c by 30, 67 and 79 %, respectively, with notable decrease in serum HDL-c by 26 % when compared to normal control animals (Table 4 ), whereas the administration of HT at 2 and 5 mg/kg to infarcted rats induced a significant decrease in pancreatic lipase activity by 35 and 42 %, respectively, accompanied with remarkable decrease in T-Ch, TG, LDL-c by (13, 23 and 24 %) and (21, 35 and 39 %), respectively, with considerable increase in HDL-c by 19 and 29 %, respectively, as compared to isoproterenol-induced rats alone ( P < 0.05).

Figure 5 showed that the ACE activity in serum of untreated infarcted rats underwent a significant increase by 67 % as compared to normal control animals ( P < 0.05). However, treatment with HT at doses of 2 and 5 mg/kg induced a remarkable decrease of ACE activity by 28 and 36 %, respectively, in serum of isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction in rats.

Discussion
HT (3,4-dihydroxyphenylethanol) is an amphipathic molecule that is derived from the hydrolysis of oleuropein. Oleuropein hydrolysis takes places during olive maturation, as well as during olive oil storage [ , ]. This phenolic bioactive compound has been proved to be endowed with several pharmaceutical properties such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, antidiabetic and hypolipidemic effects [ , , , ]. In the current study, we explored, for the first time, the therapeutic efficacy of HT in rats with myocardial infarction. A subcutaneous injection of a supramaximal dose of isoproterenol was a consequence of electrocardiographic (ECG), biochemical and structural changes in the heart as mimetic to that occurs in patients with myocardial infarction. Changes in ECG pattern are commonly used for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction. Rats treated with isoproterenol showed a marked elevation of ST-segment with remarkable decrease in P wave indicative of myocardial ischemia and infarction in accordance with previous study [ ]. The alteration of ECG pattern could be related to the consecutive loss of integrity of cell membrane in injured myocardium [ ]. The supramaximal dose of isoproterenol also injected increased heart rate (tachycardia) due to involvement of baroreceptor reflex-mediated changes in autonomic nerve activity [ ], whereas pre- and co-treatment with HT (5 mg/kg) significantly reduced the abnormalities observed in the ECG of isoproterenol-induced rats. Accordingly, it has been demonstrated that HT improved the cardiac disturbances enhanced by doxorubicin by significantly reducing the percentage of altered mitochondria also enhancing the mitochondrial electron transport chain and antioxidant defense system [ ]. Several previous studies have demonstrated that the myocardium injury induced by isoproterenol in experimental rats is strongly associated with deterioration of hemodynamic and LV contractile function [ , , , ]. While, HT pre- and co-treatment showed significant improvement in systolic and diastolic arterial pressure (SAP and DAP, respectively) and subsequent increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP), a marker of after load.
Serum cardiac troponins and cytosolic enzyme activities such as CK-MB, LDH and AST are very sensitive and specific diagnostic markers of acute myocardial infarction [ , ]. Our results confirmed previous studies reporting that isoproterenol induced significant increases in serum troponin-T level and CK-MB, LDH and AST activities which reflected the severe damage in myocardium tissues [ , ]. HT pre- and co-treatment reduced the activity of the marker enzymes in serum of isoproterenol-induced rats. It confirmed that HT could maintain membrane integrity, so restricting the leakage of these enzymes.
Previous study clearly evidenced that administration of HT to normal rats showed no toxicity effect in tolerant dose, and there was no significant difference between normal rats treated with HT and untreated normal group in all tested parameters such as heart weight, ratio, cardiac enzymes markers, oxidative stress statute and myocardium histology [ ].
Our histopathological findings of the isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction showed large infarcted zone with edema, necrosis and obvious separation of cardiac myofibrillar and inflammatory cells which explained the ST-segment elevation observed in the ECG findings. The encroachment of the injured myocardium by neutrophils during ischemia could be considered as the major source of free radicals [ ]. However, HT pre- and co-treatment (2 and 5 mg/kg, respectively) showed clear protective effects in isoproterenol-treated groups. Furthermore, lipids have a major role in cardiovascular diseases through the development of hyperlipidemia, hence increasing atherosclerosis risks. Else, it could lead to modify the composition, structure and stability of the cellular membranes.
In the present study, a significant increase in serum pancreatic lipase activity was observed which led to considerable rise in serum T-Ch, TG and LDL-c and remarkable decreased in HDL-c in isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarcted rats. These changes in lipids profile could be attributed to cardiac cyclic adenosine monophosphate that enhanced lipid biosynthesis during the hypoxic condition in isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarcted rats [ ]. In fact, lipase is secreted from the pancreas, transported to small intestine and hydrolyzes triglycerides nonabsorbable into absorbable monoglycerides and free fatty acids absorbable by small intestine. Hence, inhibition of lipase activity by HT explains the significant reduced uptake of triglycerides from the circulation of infarcted rats which is confirmed in our previous study [ ]. Queenthy and John [ ] revealed the positive correlation between the risk of developing ischemic heart disease and serum LDL-c level. In this regard, previous investigations have demonstrated that HT can correct dyslipidemia, improve triglyceride metabolism, enhance endothelial function, increase antioxidant potential and decrease low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-c), which is an important cardiovascular diseases risk factor due to its role in atherosclerosis [ , ].
Accumulating evidence suggests that the cardiac rennin–angiotensin system (RAS) is activated during the LV remodeling process after acute myocardial infarction [ , ]. Our data evidenced that serum ACE activity of isoproterenol-induced rats underwent a significant increase accompanied with elevated heart weight ratio (hypertrophy) indicative of ventricular remodeling process. It includes infarct expansion as well as compensatory reactive hypertrophy and dilation of the noninfarcted LV [ ]. Pre- and co-treatment of isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction in rat at moderate dose of HT caused a significant decrease of serum ACE activity with marked reduce in heart weight ratio indicative of cardioprotective effect preventing the increased risk of infarct expansion and LV remodeling that follows myocardial infarction. Actually, there is evidence from several experimental studies that the cardiac tissue-type rennin–angiotensin system is activated after myocardial infarction and failure [ , ]. However, ACE inhibition has been revealed to prevent cardiac remodeling and to prolong survival in experimental myocardial infarction. This process has been related to the reduced levels of circulating and tissue angiotensin II which is involved in the development of vascular and ventricular remodeling. Hence, ACE inhibitor increases tissue bradykinin accumulation, and the bradykinin has antigrowth effects and reduces vasomotor [ ].
In conclusion, the present study provides experimental evidence that oral pre- and co-treatment with HT (2 and 5 mg/kg) evidence cardioprotective effect in isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction in rats by improving heart weight, lipids profile and cardiac dysfunctional markers as well as demonstrating the beneficial role of HT as ACE inhibitor to prevent cardiac remodeling and failure.
