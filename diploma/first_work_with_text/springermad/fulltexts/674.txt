Introduction
Hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) constitute a well-established treatment for primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The reduction in risk of occlusive vascular events is directly proportional to the absolute LDL reduction, irrespective of baseline cholesterol concentration, with further benefit from more intensive statin therapy [ ]. Statins reduce arteriosclerosis, reactive oxygen species, inflammation, and hypertrophy and improve endothelial function and increasing progenitor cells [ ].
Heart failure (HF) commonly coexists with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, but there is currently no firm evidence to suggest that statins are beneficial specifically in patients with HF. Although earlier observational studies reported that statins were associated with improved outcomes in patients with HF [ ], two definitive clinical trials, the Controlled Rosuvastatin Multinational Trial in Heart Failure (CORONA) and Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenzanell’Insufficienza cardiac Heart Failure (GISSI-HF), found that rosuvastatin did not reduce all-cause nor cardiovascular (CV) mortality in patients with chronic HF [ , ]. However, a reduction in hospitalisations for CV causes was noted in CORONA, as well as non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) events [ ], and a subanalysis of pooled data from CORONA and GISSI-HF suggested that rosuvastatin decreased the risk of MI among patients with HF of ischemic aetiology [ ].
Appendix 1 summarises contemporary studies examining the effects of statins in patients with heart failure.
A related unanswered question is whether or not statin therapy provides benefit in patients with HF undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). This question has not been addressed using data from CORONA and GISSI-HF, mindful that the proportions of patients that had previous PCI were only 26 and 8%, respectively, and these studies were therefore underpowered to reliably address effects in this subgroup. To date, only a small randomised controlled trial of patients with ischemic HF undergoing PCI for acute MI have shown that 40 mg simvastatin improved left ventricular systolic function and decreased mortality, restenosis, and repeat PCI [ ].
We sought to determine if statins confer benefits to patients with HF undergoing PCI, using data from patients enrolled in the large Melbourne Interventional Group (MIG) registry.
Methods
Study Design and Patient Population
Data were drawn from the MIG registry, which has previously been described in detail [ ]. In brief, MIG collects data pertaining to PCI and outcomes at six major public hospitals in Victoria, Australia. The registry, which currently has 25,170 patients enrolled, documents demographic, clinical, and procedural characteristics of all (consecutive) patients undergoing PCI and captures outcomes at 30 days and 12 months. These include rehospitalisation and its causes, death and its causes, MI and target vessel revascularisation. A case report form with standardised definitions for all data fields is used. All adverse events are confirmed by reviewing the patients’ medical records at the participating hospitals. Cause of death outside hospital is determined by the primary physician (but not independently adjudicated). The MIG registry also collects data pertaining to medications at 30 days and 12 months. Data accuracy in the MIG registry has been reported to be 97%, comparable with other large registries [ ].
The presence of HF in MIG is clinician-determined and classified as either existing (present more than 2 weeks prior to the index PCI) or newly diagnosed (within 2 weeks of the index PCI). Clinicians determine the presence of HF on the basis of objective diagnostic criteria and/or clinical features.
For the present study, we included all patients in the MIG registry with HF (as described above), and who underwent a PCI between April 2004 and December 2014, survived until 30 days post-procedure, had information regarding statin use at 30 days, and had subsequent follow-up data at 12 months. Patients were stratified according to statin use at 30 days post-procedure. The study population comprised only 30-day survivors, and the follow-up period was from 30 days to 12 months, to allow for the likely avoidance of statins among patients deemed to have a poor short-term prognosis at the time of PCI.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause mortality and hospitalisation for CV causes between 30 days to 12 months post-index PCI. Secondary outcomes included major adverse cardiac events (MACEs), a composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and target vessel revascularisation, and hospitalisation for CV causes (defined as hospitalisation for congestive HF, acute MI, recurrent angina, arrhythmias, planned PCI, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and stroke) between 30 days and 12 months post-index PCI.
Statistical Analysis
Multiple Imputation
Based on the assumption that missing data on risk factors were missing at random, multiple imputation by chained equation (MICE) was performed to account for missing data aiming to reduce bias and improve precision [ ]. We undertook 40 imputations as suggested by the observed fraction of missing information [ , ]. Convergence of the MICE algorithm was examined visually with trace plots.
Propensity Score Analyses
To minimise the effect of confounding by differences in key characteristics between the statin and non-statin groups, propensity score analyses were undertaken [ ]. Inverse probability weighting (IPW) using propensity score creates a synthetic sample in which the distribution of measured baseline covariates is independent of treatment assignment, allowing an unbiased estimate of the relationship between exposure and outcomes and are commonly employed in studies with unequal sample distribution [ , ]. Average treatment effects were estimated using inverse probability weights (IPW) derived from 35 clinically relevant risk factors in each of the multiply imputed datasets using teffects ipw command in Stata 14 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). Average treatment effect estimates from 40 imputed datasets were averaged using Rubin’s rules to obtain an absolute risk difference and 95% confidence interval (CI) [ ]. Additional analyses using propensity score matching were undertaken to explore possible sensitivity of conclusions to the analytical approach. The analysis of propensity score-matched sample allows one to estimate the treatment effect by directly comparing outcomes between treated and untreated patients in the matched sample, approximate that of a randomised trial [ ]. Each patient taking a statin was matched to the most similar patient not taking a statin based on mean propensity scores, within calliper width of 0.01. Since a large majority of the patients were on statin therapy, untreated patients were allowed to be included in more than one matched set (matching with replacement). The ability of this process to balance the 35 risk factors between the statin and untreated patients was assessed by box plots. Average treatment effects estimates from 40 imputed datasets were combined and averaged to obtain an absolute risk difference and 95% CI. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Survival Analysis
To estimate time-to-event, outcomes were initially assessed with Kaplan-Meier plots and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models using complete-case analysis, that is, restricted to patients with non-missing data on all relevant variables. The Cox models were adjusted with the same set of risk factors described in the “ Propensity score analyses ” section. Additionally, analyses were performed in each of the 40 imputed datasets and the estimates were combined. We repeated the analyses using risk factors with p < 0.1.
Finally, we constructed inverse probability-weighted Cox models as well as stratified analyses within the propensity score-matched sample to examine the possible sensitivity of conclusions. To account for the weighting in IPW models and matched nature of the propensity score-matched sample, a robust variance estimator was used when estimating the relative change in hazard. To determine whether or not the intensity of statin therapy had any effect on the treatment outcomes, we repeated the analyses by comparing high-intensity statin-treated patients against untreated patients, with statin intensity defined by the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines [ ].
Results
The characteristics of 991 patients at 30 days post-PCI, stratified by statin use, are summarised in Table 1 . The 896 (90.4%) patients taking statins had lower serum creatinine, higher mean left ventricular ejection fraction, and were more likely to be diabetic, dyslipidemic and prescribed with a beta-blocker and aspirin. Half of the statin-treated patients were taking high-intensity statins. More than 70% of the patients were treated with the combination of ACE inhibitors/ARB, beta-blocker, aspirin and clopidogrel. The prescribing rates of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists were approximately 22% in both groups. The propensity score distribution for IPW and propensity score matching models are shown in Appendices 2 and 3 .

Effect Size
In analyses with propensity score adjustment by IPW, all 991 patients were included. Cumulative incidence at 1 year in statin patients vs. untreated patients for the primary outcome was 26.9 vs. 22.8%, absolute risk difference 4.1% (95% CI − 9.6 to 17.8%; p = 0.56). Cumulative incidence at 1 year in statin patients vs. untreated patients for MACE was 12.7 vs. 12.7%, absolute risk difference 0.0% (95% CI − 9.3 to 9.3%; p = 0.99). Cumulative incidence at 1 year in statin patients vs. untreated patients for hospitalisation for CV causes was 26.3 vs. 22.5%, absolute risk difference 3.8% (95% CI − 9.8 to 17.6%; p = 0.58).
A total of 915 patients were included in the propensity score matching analysis. In the matched statin and non-statin users, we did not find evidence relating statin use to risk of the primary outcome (cumulative incidence at 1 year in statin patients vs. untreated patients, 27.2 vs. 27.9%; absolute risk difference − 0.7%; 95% CI − 15.3 to 13.8%; p = 0.54), MACE (cumulative incidence at 1 year in statin patients vs. untreated patients, 11.8 vs. 10.6%; absolute risk difference 1.2%; 95% CI − 8.1 to 10.5%; p = 0.40) nor hospitalisation for CV causes (cumulative incidence at 1 year in statin patients vs. untreated patients, 26.7 vs. 27.6%; absolute risk difference − 0.8%; 95% CI − 15.1 to 13.4%; p = 0.55). Sensitivity analyses with various matching strategies by propensity score matching found similar conclusions.
Survival Analysis
The primary and secondary outcomes are summarised in Fig. 1 and Table 2 . In the 991 patients (model 2, Table 2 ), the primary composite outcome occurred in 244 statin patients (27.2%) and 24 untreated patients (25.3%) (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.94; 95% CI 0.61 to 1.47; p = 0.80). Likewise, MACE occurred in 116 statin patients (13.0%) and 12 untreated patients (12.6%) (aHR 0.71; 95% CI 0.37 to 1.36; p = 0.30). Hospitalisation for CV causes occurred in 240 statin patients (26.8%) and 23 untreated patients (24.2%) (aHR 1.06; 95% CI 0.68 to 1.66; p = 0.80).

In the inverse probability-weighted Cox model, the adjusted hazard ratios for primary outcome, MACE, and hospitalisation for CV causes were 1.03 (95% CI 0.68 to 1.56; p = 0.89); 0.99 (95% CI 0.54 to 1.84; p = 0.99) and 1.13 (95% CI 0.74 to 1.72; p = 0.57), respectively (model 4, Table 2 ). Similar results were obtained from the propensity score-matched statin and non-statin sample. In the propensity score-matched Cox model, the adjusted hazard ratios for primary outcome, MACE and hospitalisation for CV causes were 1.05 (95% CI 0.69 to 1.59; p = 0.82); 1.13 (95% CI 0.59 to 2.16; p = 0.72) and 1.15 (95% CI 0.76 to 1.74; p = 0.50), respectively (model 6, Table 2 ). Statins treatment effect estimates obtained across different Cox models are summarised in Table 2 .

Discussion
In this analysis, we found that the use of statins was not associated with change in risk of major clinical outcomes among patients with HF undergoing PCI, regardless of the intensity of statin therapy. These observations occurred on a background of optimal pharmacological treatment for both HF and coronary heart disease. To date, our work represents the largest registry-based study examining statins efficacy in this high-risk population. We employed multiple imputation and propensity score methods to improve precision of our estimates, account for unbalanced group distribution and reduce the effects of confounding. Of note, we obtained consistent estimates and narrow confidence intervals for our estimates across all models.
While the reasons for our findings are not certain, our observations are consistent with those of CORONA and GISSI-HF. It is possible that a small benefit derived from statin therapy is diluted by other factors driving the natural history of the disease, leading to a neutral outcome. Mechanistically, the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by statins lowers the synthesis of LDL cholesterol and coenzyme Q10, which potentially leads to increased oxidative stress and activation of proinflammatory cytokines and subsequent poorer cardiac contractility and increased inflammation [ ]. In the rosUvastatiN Impact on VEentricular Remodeling cytokineS and neurohormonEs (UNIVERSE) study, after 26 weeks of treatment, patients with chronic HF who received rosuvastatin had significantly increased levels of serum types I and III N-terminal procollagen peptide, markers of fibrotic changes within the failing heart, compared with those not taking the drug (PINP: p = 0.03, PIIINP: p = 0.001) [ ]. Nevertheless, we do not have evidence from our data to support such interactions.
A paradoxical relationship between serum lipid levels and clinical outcomes in patients with chronic HF has been described [ ]. A post hoc analysis from the Efficacy of Vasopressin Antagonism in Heart Failure Outcome Study With Tolvaptan (EVEREST) suggested that baseline total cholesterol and triglyceride levels were predictive of mortality and HF rehospitalisation beyond traditional risk factors [ ]. Both the 2016 European Society of Cardiology and European Atherosclerosis Society (ESC/EAS) and 2013 American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemia do not specifically recommend initiation of statins in patients with HF, but neither withdrawal of statins in patients who are already taking them [ , ].
To date, there are limited data on the efficacy of statins in patients with HF complicated by acute MI. A post hoc subanalysis from the EPHESUS study among patients with HF and concomitant acute MI showed that statins were associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality (HR 0.80; 95% CI 0.69 to 0.92; p = 0.001) and CV death (HR 0.76; 95% CI 0.65 to 0.88; p = 0.0002), but a higher risk of hospitalisation for non-CV causes (HR 1.16; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.33; p = 0.02) [ ].
The Korea Acute Myocardial Infarction Registry (KAMIR) study showed that statin therapy decreased the incidence of MACE in patients with acute MI, left ventricular systolic dysfunction and high levels of high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (statin vs. no statin 11.3 vs. 20.8%; p < 0.001), but not those with low levels of hs-CRP (statin vs. no statin 10.1 vs. 12.0%; p = 0.249) [ ]. A propensity-matched analysis from the same study suggested that statins exerted a neutral effect on MACE at 1 year among patients with severe acute systolic HF (statin vs. no statin 18.0 vs. 12.5%; p = 0.11) and all-cause mortality (statin vs. no statin 5.1 vs. 3.5%; p = 0.51) [ ].
Our findings are relevant and reassuring for clinicians seeing patients with HF undergoing PCI but unable to tolerate statins. Nevertheless, these data indicate that it is unlikely that these patients would have poorer prognosis if they are not being treated with statins. Although this study adds to the body of literature regarding statin efficacy in this subgroup, our findings should be viewed as hypothesis-generating as it was drawn from a select and non-randomised sample.
Limitations
Several limitations in our study warrant mention. First, despite our adopting propensity score analysis, the results may still have been affected by residual confounding in the comparison of the statin and non-statin populations. Secondly, data misclassification may have been present, as in any clinical registry dependent on data capture from clinical sites. In particular, there was no independent assessment of HF status among the study patients nor of the outcomes of interest. However, to our knowledge, there was no differential data misclassification between the statin and non-statin groups, and hence, any data misclassification would have led to a conservative estimate of any treatment effect rather than information bias. Thirdly, the sample of study patients was small, and hence, our analyses may have lacked power. However, point estimates were generally close to null values, and the width of the uncertainty intervals were narrow, which support that our finding of a null effect of statins in this population is a reflection of the truth rather than of a lack of power. Lastly, we were not able to examine the potential differential effects of the different statins and different doses of these drugs.
Conclusion
Among patients with HF undergoing PCI, statin therapy may not provide beneficial effects. Given the potential for bias and confounding in observational studies, randomised controlled trials are needed to provide more definitive answers.
