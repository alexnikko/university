Introduction
Canine mammary gland tumors (CMTs) are the most common neoplasms in intact female dogs and represent about half of all tumors in this species [ ]. Fifty to 70% of dogs diagnosed with CMTs have multiple mammary tumors [ ] and in these cases, different tumor subtypes are found [ ]. Dogs develop benign and malignant mammary tumors, with 50% percent being malignant [ ]. As in women, mammary gland carcinomas comprise the vast majority of malignant mammary tumors in dogs [ , ]. Surgery remains the gold standard treatment for CMTs, and about 50% of dogs with malignant mammary carcinomas will be cured by surgery alone; the other half already having tumor cell emboli or (micro)metastases at the time of diagnosis. In the latter cases, even with surgical resection of the primary tumor, the prognosis for these patients remains poor [ , ]. Patients with advanced disease or aggressive and invasive tumors would benefit from effective adjuvant therapies, even though there are no established guidelines for treatment beyond surgery [ ]. Conventional chemotherapeutic agents used in veterinary oncology include cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouacil, doxorubicin, docetaxel, gemcitabine and tamoxifen. These agents have been evaluated for the treatment of CMTs in small-scale studies, but with mitigated results, severe side effects and no obvious benefit for patient survival [ , , ]. As with other cancer types, the development of effective chemotherapy treatments for CMTs depends on achieving a deeper understanding of the molecular and genetic processes that drive their development. Although progress over the course of the last fifteen years has begun to define the molecular mechanisms of CMTs [ , ], this field remains in its infancy, and the identification of clinically exploitable pharmacological targets has so far remained elusive.
Hippo is an evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway that is involved in the regulation of processes as diverse as tissue growth, cell fate determination, differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis in a variety of cell types [ , ]. Dysregulation of the pathway leads to tissue overgrowth and tumorigenesis [ ]. Hippo does not have a specific extracellular ligand, rather signaling activity is controlled by stimuli such as cell-cell adhesion, contact inhibition, planar cell polarity, mechanotransduction [ , , , , ], as well as various diffusible signals and cognate receptors [ , ]. These regulate a core kinase cascade consisting of MST1 and MST2, which act in a functionally redundant manner to phosphorylate the kinases LATS1 and LATS2. The latter phosphorylate the transcriptional co-activators YAP and TAZ (also known as WWTR1). Upon phosphorylation, YAP/TAZ are either ubiquitinated and degraded by the cellular proteosomal machinery or sequestered in the cytoplasm. Interruption of Hippo kinase cascade activity allows YAP and TAZ proteins to escape phosphorylation/degradation and accumulate within the cell. Following translocation to the nucleus, YAP/TAZ can bind to several transcription factors, notably those of the TEAD family, resulting in the modulation of the transcriptional activity of a variety of target genes in a cell type- and context-specific manner [ , , ]. Although able to perform the same functions, the biological roles of YAP and TAZ are not entirely redundant, as evidenced by the divergent phenotypes of Yap and Taz knockout mice [ , , ].
Dysregulation of Hippo signaling is a key feature of several forms of cancer, and is thought to be an important driver of tumor initiation and progression [ , ]. Recent studies have shown that YAP and TAZ play crucial roles in the development of breast cancer [ , , , , , ] and, as importantly, they are also involved in the progression towards metastatic disease and the development of chemoresistance [ , , , , ]. YAP and TAZ have been shown to be more highly expressed in CMTs than in normal canine mammary tissue, with nuclear expression being higher in high grade vs low grade carcinomas [ ]. This suggests that misregulated Hippo signaling may play roles in the etiology and biology of CMTs similar to those that it plays in breast cancer, and that pharmacologic targeting of Hippo may be of therapeutic benefit in both species. Several small molecules that target specific effectors of the Hippo pathway have been identified, many of which are currently under investigation as anti-cancer agents [ ]. Among these is verteporfin, a benzoporphyrin derivative that is FDA-approved for use in photodynamic therapy for macular degeneration [ , ]. Verteporfin has been shown to antagonize YAP-mediated transcriptional co-activation by interfering with its ability to associate with TEADs, as well as by promoting its sequestration in the cytoplasm [ , , ]. Recent studies have shown that verteporfin exerts cytotoxic effects in several cancer cell types, including pancreatic adenocarcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, chronic myeloid leukemia and non-small-cell lung carcinoma in both cell culture and xenograft models [ , , , , , ]. In this report, we sought to study the role of YAP/TAZ in CMT cell biology, and to determine if pharmacological targeting of the Hippo pathway could represent a viable therapeutic strategy for the treatment of CMTs.
Materials and Methods
Cell Culture and Viability Assays
The CF-35 cell line (ATCC Cat# CRL-6229, RRID:CVCL_5261, passage 22) was provided by Dr. Monique Doré (Université de Montréal), and the CMT-9 (RRID:CVCL_U522, passage 25), CMT-12 (RRID:CVCL_L329, passage 28), CMT-25 (RRID:CVCL_L330, passage 25), CMT-28 (RRID:CVCL_1R42, passage 80) and CMT-47 (passage 33) [ ] cell lines were provided by R. Curtis Bird (Auburn University). All lines were established from canine mammary gland carcinomas [ , , ]. Additional information regarding the CF-35, CMT-9, −12,- 25, and −28 cell lines is available at Cellosaurus ( http://web.expasy.org/cellosaurus/ ). Cells were plated and cultured in MEM alpha 1X with 2 g/L glucose, phenol red and L-glutamine (Wisent, Inc., St-Bruno, Canada) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Wisent Inc., St-Bruno, Canada) and antibiotic-antimycotic solution (Wisent Inc., St-Bruno, Canada). All cells were incubated at 37 °C in 95% air and 5% CO 2 . All assays were performed with cells at 30 to 40% confluence except for the scratch and invasion assays, which required 100% confluence at the beginning of the experiment.
For the viability assay, cells were treated with vehicle (DMSO) or with graded concentrations (0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3 μM) of verteporfin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 48 h. Numbers of viable cells per well were counted using the trypan blue exclusion assay and a hemocytometer. The number of viable cells in the verteporfin treated groups was then normalized to the number of viable cells in the control group. Each condition was repeated in triplicate. ED50 values were calculated using Compusyn software (Combosyn Inc., Paramus, NJ).
Immunoblotting
Proteins were extracted using M-PER® mammalian protein extraction reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and quantified using the Bradford method (BIO-RAD Protein Assay, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Mississauga, ON, Canada). Samples (15 μg) were resolved on 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Hybond-P PVDF membrane (GE Amersham, Mississauga, ON, Canada). Blots were then probed at 4 °C overnight with antibodies against YAP (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA cat# 4912), TAZ (Cell Signaling Technology, cat# 4883) or ACTB (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Dallas, TX, cat# sc-47,778). ACTB was used as the loading control. Following incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-rabbit antibody, the protein bands were visualized by chemiluminescence using Immobilon western hrp substrate (EMD Millipore, Etobicoke, ON, Canada). Signals were visualized on a Bio-Rad ChemiDoc MP imaging system (Bio-Rad Laboratories).
Apoptosis and Cell Cycle Analyses
For the apoptosis assay, cells were cultured in 0.8 cm 2 wells (Thermo Scientific™ Nunc™ Lab-Tek™ Chamber Slide System, Thermo Fisher scientific, MA). Apoptosis was detected using the In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, TMR red (Roche, Laval, QC, Canada), following manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were treated with vehicle (DMSO) or 3 μM verteporfin for 1, 3 or 6 h. Apoptotic cells were imaged using an Axio Imager M.1 microscope (Zeiss, Toronto, ON, Canada) and AxioVision 4.6.3 software. For each sample, 6 photomicrographs of random fields were taken at 200× magnification, and cells were scored as viable or apoptotic and counted.
Cell cycle analysis was done using propidium iodide and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Cells were treated with vehicle (DMSO) or 3 μM verteporfin for 6 or 24 h. CF-35 cells were washed twice with PBS, counted and resuspended at a concentration of 10 6 cells/ml in Krishan buffer: 0.1% Sodium Citrate, 0.02 mg/ml RNAse (DNAse free), 0.3% NP-40 and 0.05 mg/ml propidium iodide. Cells were incubated at least 30 min on ice in the dark before being analyzed on an Accuri C6 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), using BD Accuri C6 software version 1.0.264.21. Cells were gated according to a 2-parameter dot-plot: FL2-A (area) vs Width to monitor doublets. Cell cycle analysis was performed using a single-parameter histogram (FL2-A) with linear x-axis to represent DNA content. CMT-9, −28 and −47 cells were analyzed in a similar manner, except using Modfit LT software (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME). Each condition was repeated in triplicate.
Real-Time PCR
Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Cell lines CF-35, CMT-9, −28 and −47 were treated with vehicle (DMSO), 1 μM or 10 μM verteporfin for 1 or 4 h. Each condition was repeated in triplicate. The RNA samples (200 ng) were analyzed by RT-quantitative PCR as previously described [ ] using the primers listed in Table 1 . Relative mRNA expression levels were calculated using the 2 −ΔΔCt method [ ] and normalized relative to ribosomal protein L19 ( RPL19 ).

Cell Migration Assay
Confluent monolayers were scratched with a pipette tip in a cross pattern. All cell lines were then treated with graded doses of verteporfin (0.01, 0.03, 0.1 or 0.3 μM) or vehicle (DMSO). Each condition was repeated in triplicate. Photomicrographs were taken after scratching and at 3 h intervals following each treatment using an Observer Z1 microscope (Zeiss) with Zen pro 2012 (blue edition) software at 25× magnification. Migration was assessed by calculating an open image area ratio (open image area at given time point / open image area at 0 h) using TScratch software Version 1.0 ( http://www.cse-lab.ethz.ch ).
Cell Invasion Assay
Cell invasiveness was analyzed using the Oris Pro 96-well invasion assay (Playtypus technologies, Madison, WI) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were stained with the Vybrant CFDA SE cell tracer kit 24 h prior to their plating, following the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen, Burlington, ON, Canada). Numbers of cells plated per well were 15,000, 25,000 and 30,000 for the CF-35, CMT-28 and CMT-47 cell lines, respectively. Cells were treated with 0.01 or 0.03 μM verteporfin or with vehicle (DMSO) for 40 h. Photomicrography and data analyses were then performed as detailed for the migration assay, above.
Anchorage-Independent Growth Assay
Soft agar colony formation assays were performed in six-well plates. CMT-9 ( n = 25,000) or CMT-47 ( n = 5000) cells were suspended in culture medium containing 0.3% soft agar and plated on a 0.5% agar underlay. Cells were treated with either vehicle (DMSO) or graded concentrations of verteporfin. Vehicle or verteporfin treatments were added to both agar layers. An additional layer of culture medium (200 μl) containing verteporfin or vehicle was added twice weekly over the upper layer of agar to prevent desiccation. Plates were incubated at 37 °C and the colonies counted after 3 weeks. All colonies greater than 100 μm in diameter were then counted using an Observer Z1 microscope (Zeiss) with the Zen pro 2012 (blue edition) software at 25× magnification. Each condition was repeated in triplicate.
Statistical Analyses
Cell migration, invasion and anchorage-independent growth assays were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and Dunnett’s multiple comparison test following logarithmic transformation to normalize data distribution. TUNEL and RT-qPCR data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparison test. TUNEL data underwent angular transformation prior to statistical testing. Cell cycle data was analyzed by unpaired parametric two-sided t test with Welch’s correction (after angular transformation of data). For all tests, differences were considered significant when P < 0.05.
Results
Verteporfin Sensitivity Correlates with YAP Expression in CMT Cell Lines
In order to evaluate Hippo as a therapeutic target for the treatment of CMTs, we started by characterizing YAP and TAZ expression in six CMT cell lines. Whereas YAP was readily detected in four of the cell lines (CMT-9, −12, −28, −47) by immunoblotting, it was essentially undetectable in CF-35 and in CMT-25 cells (Fig. 1 ). Conversely, TAZ was strongly expressed in all cell lines except CMT-25, in which expression levels were lower. Fig. 1 Expression of YAP and TAZ in mammary gland tumor cell lines . Immunoblotting analysis of YAP and TAZ expression in canine mammary gland cancer cell lines (CF-35, CMT-9, −12, −28, −47, and −25). β-Actin (ACTB) was used as a loading control. Approximate apparent molecular weights are indicated to the right of the blots
To determine the effect of verteporfin on the viability of CMT cells, all lines were treated with graded doses of verteporfin and the numbers of remaining viable cells counted after 48 h. Results showed that verteporfin killed CMT-9, −12, −28, −47 cells with ED50 values from 14 to 79 nM, and that 3 μM verteporfin killed all cells in these lines (Fig. 2 ). Verteporfin also killed CF-35 and CMT-25 cells, but ED50 values were in the hundreds of nM, and >25% of cells survived the 3 μM treatment. These results indicate that verteporfin exerts cytotoxic effects on CMT cells, and suggest that this toxicity is partially dependent on YAP expression. Fig. 2 Viability experiment. The indicated cell lines were treated with vehicle (DMSO) or graded concentrations (0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3 μM) of verteporfin for 48 h and viability assessed by trypan blue exclusion. Calculated median effective doses (ED50) are shown for each cell line. For all cell lines, n = 3 samples/dose, data are expressed as means (points) ± SEM (error bars)
Verteporfin Induces Apoptosis in CMT Cell Lines
As YAP/TAZ serve as co-activators of the transcription of several genes associated with cell survival and proliferation [ , , , , ], we sought to determine the effects of verteporfin on apoptosis and cell cycle progression in CMT cells. Using one verteporfin-resistant (CF-35) and three verteporfin-sensitive (CMT-9, −28, −47) lines, we assessed the proportion of TUNEL-positive cells on a time course following treatment with 3 μM verteporfin. In all lines, verteporfin induced apoptosis by 6 h following treatment (Fig. 3 ). The same lines were treated with verteporfin for 6 or 24 h, and cell cycle analyses were done by flow cytometry. As shown in Table 2 , verteporfin caused statistically significant changes in the proportion of cells in each phase of the cycle in CMT-9 and -28 cells, but not in CF-35 or CMT-47 cells. However, these changes were very minor, and did not show a pattern suggestive of cell cycle arrest. Together, these data suggest that verteporfin exerts its cytotoxic effect mainly via the induction of apoptosis, and has a negligible effect on cell proliferation in CMT cells. Fig. 3 TUNEL assays. The indicated cell lines were treated with vehicle (DMSO) or 3 μM verteporfin for 1, 3 or 6 h and cells were counted and scored as TUNEL-positive or -negative. For all lines, n = 6/treatment.

Verteporfin Affects the Expression of Hippo Target Genes
To determine if verteporfin affects gene expression in CMT cells, we measured mRNA levels for four cancer-relevant YAP/TAZ target genes ( AMOTL2 , CTGF , ANKRD1 and CYR61 ) following 1 h or 4 h treatment with 1 μM or 10 μM verteporfin. Although verteporfin modestly decreased AMOTL2 and ANKRD1 expression in some cell lines, CTGF and CYR61 decreased rapidly and dramatically in all lines tested (Fig. 4 ). CTGF and CYR61 therefore appear to be major YAP transcriptional target genes in CMT cells. Fig. 4 Effects of verteporfin on Hippo pathway target gene expression in CMT cell lines. The indicated cell lines were treated with vehicle (DMSO), 1 μM or 10 μM verteporfin for 1 or 4 h (black and grey columns, respectively) and the expression of the indicated genes determined by RT-qPCR. All data were normalized to the housekeeping gene RPL19 , n = 3/treatment and time. Data are expressed as means (columns) ± SEM (error bars), asterisks indicate statistically significant difference from control, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001
Cancer Cell Migration, Invasion and Anchorage-Independent Growth are Inhibited by Verteporfin
Scratch assays were done in order to determine if verteporfin could affect CMT cell migration. Confluent monolayers of CMT-9, −28, −47 and CF-35 cells were scratched, and cell migration into the newly created gap was monitored for 12 h in presence or absence of 0.3 μM verteporfin. Whereas control CF-35, CMT-28 and CMT-47 cells migrated so as to nearly fill the scratch within 12 h, verteporfin treatment almost completely inhibited cell migration (Fig. 5 ). CMT-9 cells failed to migrate, even in absence of verteporfin. Fig. 5 CMT cell migration assays. The indicated cell lines were grown to confluence, the monolayers scratched, and the extent of cell migration from the margins (in presence or absence of 0.3 μM verteporfin (VP)) evaluated after 12 h. a Representative photomicrographs, dashed black lines indicate the original margins of the scratch. Cells are highlighted in light gray for contrast and for quantification. b Quantitative analysis of cell migration. Data represent the ratio of the cell-free area present at 12 h to the original area of the scratch. Data are expressed as means (columns) ± SEM (error bars), asterisks indicate statistically significant difference from control (DMSO), * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01
The Oris™ Pro cell migration assay was used in order to determine if verteporfin could compromise the ability of CMT cells to invade an artificial matrix. Verteporfin concentrations as low as 0.03 μM significantly inhibited CMT-28 and CMT-47 cell invasiveness, but did not impede CF-35 cells (Fig. 6 ). CMT-9 cells did not invade the matrix under any conditions. Fig. 6 CMT invasion assays. The Oris™ Pro cell migration assay was used in order to determine the effect of verteporfin on CMT cell invasiveness. a Representative photomicrographs of results obtained with the CMT-47 line, dashed red circles indicate the margins of the artificial matrix. b Quantitative analyses of cell invasion. Data represent the ratio of the cell-free area present at 40 h to the original area of the matrix. Data are expressed as means (columns) ± SEM (error bars), asterisks indicate statistically significant difference from control, *** p < 0.001
Finally, we determined the effects of verteporfin on anchorage-independent growth. CMT cell lines were plated in soft agar with graded concentrations of verteporfin (present in both the agar and in the culture media overlay), and colony formation was monitored for three weeks. CF-35 and CMT-28 cells failed to form colonies even in absence of treatment, but CMT-9 and -47 formed colonies readily. In the latter lines, 1 μM verteporfin completely prevented the formation of colonies larger than 100 μm in diameter (Fig. 7 ). Fig. 7 Anchorage-independent growth assays. The indicated CMT cell lines were plated in soft agar and treated with vehicle (DMSO) or graded concentrations of verteporfin. Colonies of cells with diameters exceeding 100 μm were counted after three weeks of culture. Data are expressed as means (columns) ± SEM (error bars), asterisks indicate statistically significant difference from control, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001
Discussion
Canine mammary tumors are among the most frequent cancers in dogs, and the treatment of metastatic CMTs is an intractable problem in veterinary oncology. The development of effective chemotherapeutic options for advanced CMTs depends on attaining a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying CMT progression. In this report, we found high levels of expression of the Hippo signaling effectors YAP and TAZ in the majority of the CMT cell lines that we studied, which is consistent with a recent report describing increased YAP/TAZ expression in CMTs relative to normal canine mammary tissue [ ]. We were then able to demonstrate the cytotoxicity of verteporfin, a pharmacologic inhibitor of YAP-mediated transcriptional co-activation, to CMT cells. Our studies showed that verteporfin inhibited cell survival as well as key behaviors of malignant cells including migration, invasion and anchorage-independent growth, and did so (at least in part) by decreasing the mRNA levels of YAP/TAZ target genes. These findings provide important proof of principle that Hippo pathway represents a valid therapeutic target for the treatment of this disease. Beyond the field of veterinary medicine, we expect that these findings will have important translational value. Indeed, overwhelming evidence supports a role for dysregulated Hippo signaling in the etiology of breast cancer, notably in the development of key malignant traits such as invasiveness, resistance to chemotherapy and metastatic dissemination [ , , , , , ]. Our study therefore further highlights the similarities between CMTs and breast cancer and the value of CMTs as a spontaneous model for the study of the human disease.
Our identification of CYR61 and CTGF as transcriptional targets of YAP in CMT cells may provide important insight into the mechanism of action of Hippo signaling in CMTs. Both CYR61 and CTGF belong to the CCN gene family, and encode cysteine-rich extracellular matrix proteins that function as integrin ligands [ ]. High CYR61 expression in breast cancer patients has been associated with metastatic dissemination and poor prognosis [ , , ]. In cell culture and xenograft models, CYR61 has been shown to increase VEGF secretion and promote tumor vascularization, as well as to promote estrogen-independent tumor cell growth, invasiveness and metastasis [ , , , , ]. As for CYR61 , high CTGF expression in primary breast cancers was associated with features of advanced disease, and correlated with stage, tumor size and lymph node involvement [ , ]. Overexpression of CTGF in breast cancer cells was shown to promote migration, angiogenesis and chemoresistance [ , , ]. Conversely, concomitant knockdown of CYR61 and CTGF in breast cancer cells reversed Taxol resistance caused by TAZ [ , ]. Together, these studies have identified CYR61 and CTGF as major Hippo-regulated promoters of breast cancer development and progression. Whether these genes play similar roles in CMTs will be grounds for further study.
Our finding that the four CMT cell lines that expressed YAP were highly sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of verteporfin, whereas the two YAP-negative lines were resistant, strongly suggests that the effects of verteporfin were the result of the interference with YAP. However, higher concentrations of verteporfin were nonetheless capable of killing YAP-negative cells, and verteporfin was as capable of reducing CYR61 and CTGF expression in (YAP-negative) CF-35 cells as it was in YAP-positive cells. One possible explanation for this is the functional redundancy of YAP and TAZ. For instance, should verteporfin be capable of suppressing TAZ-mediated transcriptional co-activation at a higher concentration than that required to suppress YAP, this would 1) explain how YAP-negative/TAZ-positive cell lines exhibit cytotoxic effects at a higher ED50 and 2) provide a mechanism whereby verteporfin can suppress the expression of Hippo target genes in YAP-negative cells. Whether verteporfin can target TAZ has not been reported, but would seem likely given the structural and functional similarities between YAP and TAZ, including their ability to bind TEAD transcription factors.
Our in vitro studies indicate that verteporfin is capable of killing CMT cells at concentrations that are easily attained in vivo [ ]. Indeed, verteporfin has been shown to have anti-cancer activity in xenograft models of several types of cancer [ , , ], suggesting that it could find therapeutic uses beyond its FDA-approved use as a photosensitizing agent [ , , , , , ]. However, its photosensitizing properties may ultimately limit its suitability for cancer chemotherapy, and it is also known to affect cellular processes such as autophagy at high doses through mechanisms that have not yet been defined [ ]. The discovery of the involvement of the Hippo pathway in a variety of malignancies has fueled a search for small-molecule modulators of Hippo signaling, in the hopes of identifying new chemotherapeutic agents [ ]. These efforts have yielded several advances, including the intriguing recent discovery that the statins act via the mevalonate pathway to inhibit YAP/TAZ nuclear localization and transcriptional responses in several cancer cell types, including breast cancer [ , , , ]. Statins are broadly used in human medicine for their lipid-lowering effects, and have wide therapeutic indices. Interestingly, long-term statin use has been shown to lower the risk of breast cancer, although the basis for this protection has not been determined [ ]. Together, these advances suggest that Hippo-targeted chemotherapies will become available for clinical use in the near future, and could provide an important advance in the treatment of cancers arising from dysregulated Hippo signaling, including CMTs.
