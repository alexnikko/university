Introduction
Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, occurring when the myocardial blood supply is briefly suspended and subsequent recanalization, induces loss of cardiomyocytes, cardiac dysfunction, and ultimately heart failure [ ]. The pathophysiological mechanisms behind myocardial I/R injury are apparently multifactorial, including oxidative stress, intracellular calcium overload, inflammatory response, cardiomyocyte dysfunction, and programmed cell death [ , ].
Apoptosis, a main type of cell death that occurs when DNA damage is irreversible, is characterized by distinct morphological and biochemical changes [ ]. Caspases are key molecules involved in signaling cascades of programmed cell death, in which caspase-3 has been recognized as an important initiator and promoter of apoptosis [ ]. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)–serine/threonine kinase (Akt) pathway is one of the most important intracellular pathways involved in a broad range of biological processes including myocardial I/R injury [ ], and activated Akt plays a key role in pro-survival and anti-apoptotic by stimulating multiple downstream targets, such as mPTP, TNF-α, eNOS, NF-κB, and members of Bcl-2 family and Caspase family [ , , ].
Autophagy, a type II programmed cell death, also plays a pivotal role in myocardial I/R injury [ ]. Research showed that basal autophagy is responsible for the removal or recycling of long-lived proteins and organelles and maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Nevertheless, excessive autophagy may be used for self-destruction and ultimately lead to autophagic cell death, which is accompanied by increased levels of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) and Beclin1 [ ]. Hence, autophagy can have both beneficial and detrimental roles in the myocardium, depending on the level of autophagy. The kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a key regulator of autophagy, the activity of which is enhanced by factors that activate the PI3K–Akt pathway [ ].
Millettia pulchra (Benth.) Kurz var. Laxior (Dunn) Z. Wei (Papilionaceae) (MKL) is a traditional Chinese medicinal herb extensively distributing in the Guangxi Province of China. Our previous studies have demonstrated that extracts of MKL roots have anti-hypertensive, anti-oxidative, and anti-inflammatory effects. MHBFC is a monomer of flavonoids that was originally isolated from a 60 % ethanol extract from MKL roots [ ]. Previous studies have demonstrated that MHBFC could block NF-κB activation and the inflammatory response [ ], scavenge hydroxyl radicals and oxyradicals [ ], inhibit apoptosis, enhance the cardiocyte survival rate in hypoxia/reoxygenation injury [ ], and protect the heart against myocardial ischemia in vitro and in vivo [ ]. However, it is unclear whether activation of the PI3K–Akt signal pathway is involved in the mechanisms of MHBFC cardioprotective effects.
Accordingly, we used a rat model of I/R to hypothesize that MHBFC exerts its cardioprotective effects via activating the PI3K–Akt pathway to suppress apoptosis and excessive autophagy. Elucidation of the involvement of the PI3K–Akt pathway in MHBFC-induced cardioprotection may have important clinical implications for the development of cardioprotective strategies.

Animals and Experimental Conditions
The experimental procedures and protocols used in this investigation were approved by the Ethics Committee for the Experimental Use of Animals at Guangxi Medical University (Guangxi, China) on May 15, 2014 (No. 20140515-06) and carried out in accordance with their guidelines. Forty male Sprague–Dawley rats with a body weight of 250–280 g were obtained from the Guangxi Medical University Laboratory Animal Center. The rats were housed under standard conditions (20–25 °C, 50–60 % humidity, with a 12-h light–dark cycle) and were given standard rodent chow and free access to water.
Drugs and Reagents
MHBFC (Tables 1S–2S, Figs. 1S–3S, Supporting information; purity >95 %) was isolated from MKL by the Department of Pharmacology, Guangxi Medical University (Guangxi, China) and diluted with 0.5 % DMSO to the appropriate concentration [ ]. LY294002 (LY, a PI3K ihibitor) was obtained from the Sigma-Aldrich Inc. (St. Louis, MO, USA). NO detection kit was obtained from the Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute. CK-MB and TNF-α ELISA kits were purchased from Beijing Chenglin Biological Technology Co., Ltd. mPTP fluorescence detection kit was obtained from Genmed Scientifics Inc. (Shanghai, China). Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) apoptosis detection kit was purchased from Roche Diagnostics (Mannheim, Germany). All antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology Inc. (Danvers, MA, USA).
Experimental Design
The rats were randomly divided into five groups ( n = 8):
(1) Sham group, in which rats underwent a similar procedure without ligation of the coronary artery; (2) I/R group, in which the I/R model was established by ligating the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery for 30 min then reperfusion for 2 h; (3) I/R + MHBFC group, in which I/R rats were administered MHBFC (10 mg/kg); (4) I/R + MHBFC + LY group, in which I/R rats were administered MHBFC (10 mg/kg) plus LY (0.3 mg/kg); (5) I/R + LY group, in which I/R rats were administered LY (0.3 mg/kg). The drugs were given 5 min before the onset of reperfusion via sublingual intravenous injection, and the sham control and I/R model rats received equal volumes of saline.
General Surgical Procedure
Rats were anesthetized with 10 % chloral hydrate (3 ml/kg body weight). The chest was opened via a left thoracotomy, followed by a pericardiotomy. A 6–0 silk suture (4/0 nonabsorbable, Catania, Italy) was passed around the LAD artery, and the ends were pulled through a small vinyl tube to form a snare and then tightened. Oxygen was supplied through the trachea using an animal respiration machine (respiration rate 70/min, respiration-to-expiration ratio 1: 2, tidal volume 50 ml/kg). After 30 min of ischemia, the myocardium reperfusion for 2 h was done. The electrocardiogram was monitored continuously throughout the myocardial I/R procedure with a MS4000 biological signal record and analysis system. The model was considered successfully established when the ST-segment elevated during the myocardial ischemia and dropped at least 50 % during the reperfusion period [ ].
Measurement of NO Content in Serum
After reperfusion, blood samples were collected and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min. Serum NO level was measured by a colorimetric method using commercial kits (Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China), according to the manufacturer’s protocols.
Determination of CK-MB and TNF-α Levels
Blood samples from the abdominal aorta were collected after reperfusion. Serum levels of CK-MB and TNF-α were determined according to the methods described in the manual for the ELISA kits (Chenglin Biological Technology Co., Ltd. Beijing, China).
Assessment of Apoptosis
To measure the level of apoptosis, the hearts were first excised and washed in saline solution. Myocardial tissues from risk area were transected (approximately 2 mm thick) and fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde, processed through an ethanol gradient, embedded in paraffin wax, and sectioned into 3-μm-thick slices. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay was performed using an In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. In this method, the apoptotic nuclei were stained dark brown. Normal nuclei were stained blue with hematoxylin. The results were scored semiquantitatively by averaging the number of apoptotic cells/field at 400× magnification. Five fields were evaluated per tissue sample, and the cardiomyocyte apoptosis represented the apoptosis index (AI) and was calculated as follows: AI = the number of TUNEL-positive cells/the total number of cells counted × 100 %.
Isolation of Mitochondria
Mitochondria were extracted from heart tissue using a Tissue Mitochondria Isolation Kit (Solarbio Science & Technology Co., Ltd. Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Determination of Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore (mPTP) Opening
A mPTP fluorescence detection kit (Genmed Scientifics Inc., Shanghai, China) was used to assess mPTP opening. Calcein was applied to stain the mitochondria. This dye selectively aggregates inside the mitochondria, leading to green fluorescence. The dye is released from the mitochondria when the mPTP open. The change in mitochondrial fluorescence thus reflects the degree of mPTP opening. The fluorescence intensity of the mitochondria was determined using a microplate reader (Tecan Infinite f200 Pro, Switzerland) at the excitation wavelength of 488 nm and emission wavelength of 505 nm.
Western Blot Analysis
After homogenization and protein concentration quantitation, equivalent amounts (100 μg) of protein samples were loaded and separated by 6–12 % sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked in 5 % nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1 % Tween 20 (TBST) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies: PI3K (1:500), Akt (1:2000), phospho-Akt (Ser473, 1:1000), phospho-eNOS (Ser1177, 1:2000), Beclin1 (1:1000), LC3 (1:1000), caspase-3 (1:1000), phospho-mTOR (Ser2448, 1:1000) and mTOR (1:1000) (all from Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA). After three washes for 5 min with TBST, membranes were further incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for 2 h, followed by three TBST washes. Relative densitometry was assessed by a computerized software package (NIH Image 1.63 software).
Statistical Analysis
The results were presented as the mean ± SD, and all statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 21.0 software (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). Differences between groups were tested for statistical significance using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) performed with Student–Newman–Keuls posttest. Differences were considered statistically significant at P values that were <0.05.
Results
MHBFC Reduced the CK-MB and TNF-α Levels
As shown in Fig. 1 , I/R caused dramatic increases in CK-MB and TNF-α in the serum when compared with the sham group ( P < 0.05). Interestingly, postconditioning of MHBFC significantly inhibited the elevation of CK-MB and TNF-α, in comparison with the I/R group ( P < 0.05). However, in the presence of LY, a specific PI3K inhibitor, the effect of MHBFC was almost completely abolished ( P < 0.05), whereas LY alone had no significant effect on I/R-induced CK-MB and TNF-α release ( P > 0.05). Fig. 1 Effects of MHBFC on the levels of CK-MB and TNF-α in the serum. The data are expressed as mean ± SD ( n = 8). # P < 0.05 compared with sham group; * P < 0.05 compared with I/R group; & P < 0.05 compared with I/R + MHBFC group
MHBFC Decreased the NO Content
After reperfusion, the serum content of NO was significantly lower in the I/R group than that in the sham group ( P < 0.05). MHBFC postconditioning conspicuously elevated the NO production compared to the I/R group ( P < 0.05). However, the effect of MHBFC was reversed by the addition of LY. Additionally, the level of NO was not significantly different among the I/R + LY, I/R + MHBFC + LY, and I/R groups ( P > 0.05) (Fig. 2 ). Fig. 2 Effect of MHBFC on the levels of NO in the serum. The data are expressed as mean ± SD ( n = 8). # P < 0.05 compared with sham group; * P < 0.05 compared with I/R group; & P < 0.05 compared with I/R + MHBFC group
MHBFC Reduced Cardiomyocyte Apoptosis Induced by I/R
TUNEL staining showed the absence of apoptosis in the sham group. The rats of I/R group exhibited severe tissue damage appeared to have dramatically increased number of TUNEL-positive cells ( P < 0.01 vs. sham). In contrast, I/R + MHBFC group of rats demonstrated a marked reduction in TUNEL-positive cells compared with I/R group ( P < 0.05), but this effect was eliminated after co-administering LY ( P < 0.05). Similarly, no significant difference was observed in the TUNEL-positive cell number among the I/R + LY, I/R + MHBFC + LY, and I/R groups ( P > 0.05) (Fig. 3 ).

MHBFC Suppressed the mPTP Opening
The opening of the mPTP was examined using calcein-AM staining combined with CoCl 2 . The results showed that the calcein fluorescence intensity in the I/R group was significantly lower ( P < 0.01) than that of the sham group, suggesting that I/R led to increased mPTP opening. MHBFC effectively inhibited I/R-induced mPTP opening ( P < 0.05), which was evidenced by the increased calcein fluorescence. However, the effect of MHBFC against I/R-induced mPTP opening was abolished by LY ( P < 0.05 vs. I/R + MHBFC). There was no apparent difference in the degree of mPTP opening among the I/R + LY, I/R + MHBFC + LY, and I/R groups ( P > 0.05) (Fig. 4 ).

The data are expressed as mean ± SD ( n = 8). # P < 0.01 compared with sham group; * P < 0.05 compared with I/R group; & P < 0.05 compared with I/R + MHBFC group
Effect of MHBFC on the Expression of Caspase-3, Beclin1, and LC3 Proteins
As shown in Fig. 5 , the protein levels of cleaved caspase-3 and Beclin1 and the ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I in the I/R group were remarkably higher than that in the sham group ( P < 0.01). However, the increased expressions of cleaved caspase-3, Beclin1, and LC3-II/LC3-I ratio were effectively suppressed by MHBFC ( P < 0.05 vs. I/R). Furthermore, co-administration of LY abrogated the effects of MHBFC ( P < 0.01 vs. I/R + MHBFC). Also, there was no statistically significant difference among the I/R + LY, I/R + MHBFC + LY, and I/R groups with respect to these results ( P > 0.05).

The data are expressed as mean ± SD ( n = 8). ## P < 0.01 compared with sham group; * P < 0.05 compared with I/R group; & P < 0.05 compared with I/R + MHBFC group
Effect of MHBFC on the Expression of PI3K, Akt, eNOS, and mTOR Proteins
In order to elucidate the role of the PI3K–Akt signaling pathway in the protective effect of MHBFC on myocardial I/R injury, the expression of PI3K, phospho-Akt (Ser473), phospho-eNOS (Ser1177), and phospho-mTOR (Ser2448) was further investigated. Compared to the sham group, a significant decrease in the levels of PI3K, p-Akt, p-eNOS, and p-mTOR was noted in the I/R model group ( P < 0.01), but a remarkable increase in these proteins occurred in the I/R + MHBFC group ( P < 0.01). The up-regulating effect of MHBFC was blocked by the co-administration of LY ( P < 0.01). Consistently, no significant difference among I/R + LY, I/R + MHBFC + LY, and I/R groups with regard to these proteins ( P > 0.05 vs. I/R) (Fig. 6 ).

Discussion
Acute coronary occlusion is effectively treated by primary percutaneous coronary intervention. However, myocardial I/R injury is at the moment an unavoidable consequence of the procedure and causes a high proportion of heart failure. In this study, we found that MHBFC mitigated I/R-induced cardiomyocytes apoptosis and excessive autophagy by modulation of the PI3K–Akt pathway. These findings are in accordance with those in previous studies, which showed a cardioprotective effect of MHBFC against I/R injury in the heart in vitro and in vivo [ , ].
Apoptosis is one of the main pathogenic mechanisms following myocardial I/R injury [ ]. In mammalian cells, apoptosis can be executed though a death receptor-dependent (extrinsic) pathway and a mitochondria-dependent (intrinsic) pathway [ ]. A key target in the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway, the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), is a nonselective channel spanning the inner and outer mitochondrial membrane. Opening of mPTP can cause mitochondrial swelling, rupture of the outer membrane release of pro-apoptotic protein, and caspase activation, leading to cell apoptosis [ ]. Research has shown that myocardial I/R triggers mPTP opening, especially during the reperfusion period, mainly by increasing intracellular concentration of Ca 2+ and reactive oxygen species [ ]. Our previous study has demonstrated that MHBFC could inhibit Ca 2+ overload, depress oxidative stress, and resist apoptosis in myocardial ischemia model [ ]. In this study, we found that the opening of mPTP induced by I/R could be significantly alleviated by treatment with MHBFC. It illustrated that inhibition of mPTP opening might be involved in the anti-apoptosis mechanisms of MHBFC in response to myocardial I/R injury.
TNF-α may bind with TNF receptors and induce apoptosis via the activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway [ ]. It is widely believed that TNF-α is a multi-effect, proinflammatory factor and contributes to cardiomyocyte apoptosis with a constantly high concentration during myocardial I/R injury [ ]. Consistently, our finding showed a remarkably higher concentration of TNF-α in the I/R group than that in the sham group, while postconditioning of MHBFC prevented this enhancement.
On the other hand, NO can affect cellular decisions of life and death by either turning on or shutting off apoptotic pathways, it functions differently depending on the source of NO [ ]. Three isoforms of NO synthases (NOS) are responsible for the synthesis of NO, eNOS, inducible NOS (iNOS), and neuronal NOS, in which eNOS and iNOS are proved to participate in I/R injury. There is evidence that NO derived from eNOS exerts cardioprotective and anti-apoptotic effects against I/R injury, whereas iNOS-derived NO plays an opposite role [ ]. In addition, phosphorylate Akt can activate eNOS and/or its production NO to prevent mPTP opening and inhibit apoptosis [ ]. Our data revealed that increasing eNOS activity and NO production occurred concomitantly with the up-regulation of Akt phosphorylation. So, we deduce that MHBFC might improve the function of NO and protect the heart via activation of Akt-eNOS, resulting in augmented NO content and reduced apoptosis.
Caspase family is the final pathway for inducing apoptosis, in which caspase-3 is the pivotal protease in apoptosis that can directly lead to the disintegration of apoptotic cells, the dissolution of cell protein and enzymes and DNA degradation [ ]. Hence, caspase-3 is a widely used biochemical marker for detecting apoptosis. In the present study, I/R injury caused an up-regulated level of cleaved (activated) caspase-3 but could be reversed by MHBFC, which was in agreement with findings from our previous study [ ]. Moreover, MHBFC treatment significantly reduced the apoptosis rate of cardiomyocytes as revealed by TUNEL staining, and this effect was abolished in the presence of PI3K inhibitor LY294002. Thus, it is speculated that the PI3K–Akt signaling may play a key role in the anti-apoptotic action of MHBFC in myocardial I/R injury.
The PI3K–Akt signaling pathway is a classical pro-survival and anti-apoptosis pathway [ ]. As a key component of reperfusion injury salvage kinase (RISK) pathway, PI3K–Akt is involved in cardiac protection against myocardial I/R injury: Activation of the PI3K–Akt signaling pathway leads to Akt phosphorylation at the Ser 473 locus, producing p-Akt, and stimulates downstream targets, such as mPTP, TNF-α, NF-κB, eNOS, the Bcl-2 family proteins, and the caspase family proteins; this then regulates apoptosis, adjusts transcription factor, affects metabolism, enhances cardiomyocyte survival, and thereby attenuates I/R injury [ , , , ]. In our study, to assess whether activation of the PI3K–Akt pathway could be a mechanism of MHBFC-induced cardioprotection, we used LY294002, a specific PI3K inhibitor, prior to reperfusion and MHBFC treatment. It was found that all effects of MHBFC showed above were antagonized to a significant degree by LY294002. Meanwhile, MHBFC postconditioning significantly increased the expression of PI3K and phosphorylation of Akt. Collectively, we demonstrate that MHBFC exerts a protective effect on myocardial I/R injury in a PI3K–Akt-dependent manner.
During myocardial I/R, a variety of intracellular enzymes release from damaged cardiomyocytes and enter the circulation, in which CK-MB has been recognized as an important myocardium injury biomarker [ ]. To evaluate and validate the protective function of MHBFC during I/R injury, we measured the level of CK-MB in the serum after reperfusion. Our data showed that CK-MB level was increased in the I/R group compared with the sham group. MHBFC postconditioning significantly decreased the CK-MB level in the serum, suggesting its membrane-stabilizing ability.
Except apoptosis, autophagy is another major factor leading to cell death in myocardial I/R injury [ ]. It has been demonstrated that autophagy that occurs during the ischemia phase is beneficial; however, excessive autophagy during reperfusion can induce a progressive consumption of cellular constituents and ultimately lead to autophagic cell death [ ]. Autophagy is regulated by autophagy-related genes (Atgs), among which Beclin1/Atg6 is essential for the vesicle nucleation step of autophagy [ ]. Research indicated that the autophagy-promoting activity of Beclin1 is suppressed by anti-apoptotic members of Bcl-2 family through direct binding, indicating that a cross talk exists between autophagy and apoptosis [ ]. Hence, Beclin1-mediated autophagy can be negatively regulated by Bcl-2. We have previously showed that MHBFC reduced apoptosis by up-regulating Bcl-2 expression [ ], and in the present study, a highly decreased Beclin1 expression level was observed in the I/R + MHBFC group as compared to the I/R group, indicating that MHBFC might concurrently suppress apoptosis and autophagy via the regulation of Beclin1/Bcl-2 expression. However, further studies are required to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon.
In addition, the recognized marker of autophagy, microtubule-associated protein light chain 3, LC3, is converted from the unconjugated form LC3-I to the conjugated form LC3-II, when autophagy is activated [ ]. Therefore, the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio has been used for analyzing autophagy in numerous researches. In the present study, we confirmed that autophagy was initiated with a significant increase in LC3-II protein level and the ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I in this rat I/R model, MHBFC could counteract the autophagy process as evidence by decreasing LC3-II expression and the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio. The mammalian target of rapamycin, mTOR, is an important downstream target of the PI3K–Akt pathway, which is positively regulated by PI3K–Akt and results in the inhibition of autophagy [ ]. As shown in Fig. 6 , both phosphorylation levels of Akt and mTOR in the MHBFC treated groups were considerably enhanced compared with the I/R group, and further co-administration of LY blocked the elevations of p-Akt and p-mTOR, suggesting that MHBFC might inhibit the detrimental autophagic reaction, at least partially, via the PI3K–Akt–mTOR pathway.
In conclusion, the current study has demonstrated that the cardioprotective effect of MHBFC on myocardial I/R injury is associated with inhibition of apoptosis and excessive autophagy, and these protective process require the activation of the PI3K–Akt pathway. These discoveries provide a mechanistic basis for new therapeutic agents aiming to modulate PI3K–Akt pathway in order to attenuate myocardial I/R injury. And MHBFC can serve as a potential agent for preventing myocardial I/R injury.
