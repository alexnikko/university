Introduction
The majority of pharmacokinetic data are obtained after oral administration. However, in contrast to drug disposition data (IV injection) which can often be fitted with sum of exponentials (or by using equivalent mammillary compartment models), the situation is more complicated for oral data due to the complex character of the input process (dissolution, permeation, gastrointestinal transit etc.). Attempts to deal with this problem are: 1. Calculation of curve moments by numerical integration (no curve model except the terminal exponential phase); 2. Fit by simple empirical functions like the Bateman function and 3. Use of specific models of the absorption or input process when also IV data are available as the reference treatment (e.g. bioavailability study). In the latter case, several different empirical input functions (models of the dissolution/absorption process) have been previously used: the inverse Gaussian density function (IG) either as single IG [ , , , ] or as sum of IGs [ , ], the gamma density [ ] and the Weibull density function [ ]. The following questions arise. First, which of these functions should one use for a given situation? Second, what is the improvement in using a sum of IGs over a single IG? To this end, a method of model selection is presented which is based on the concepts of log-concavity of the concentration–time curve and time course of fractional elimination rate. Further, it is shown that a sum of IGs generally provides a better fit than a single IG.
Finally, as an alternative when no IV reference data are available, there is a need for flexible functions that can be used to fit the oral data directly to replace the simple Bateman function which fits only log-concave curves. It is demonstrated that a sum of IGs is very useful for this purpose as it fits also multimodal curves.
Thus, the aim of this study was to show that first, the selection of a suitable input function is an important step when IV reference data are available, and second that a weighted sum of IGs is a useful empirical curve model for fitting oral data directly. The results are especially interesting for population pharmacokinetics where a fit by analytical functions is essential. Note that the single IG [ ] and a sum of IGs [ , ] has been previously used as input functions in population analysis of oral data. This is the first report demonstrating that a weighted sum of IGs can also be used for fitting oral data directly when IV data are not available.
Methods
Parameters to be estimated
Empirical functions are fitted to oral concentration–time data, C ( t ), to extract parameters with a physical meaning, such as the mean and variance of residence time in the body ( MBRT and VBRT ) or the squared relative dispersion of residence times \(RD_{B}^{2}\) . These parameters are calculated via the moments $$m_{i} = \int\limits_{0}^{\infty } {t^{i} } \frac{C(t)}{AUC}d\tau$$ (1) as $$MBRT \, = \, m_{1} , \, VBRT \, = \, m_{1} - \, m_{1}^{2} \,and \quad RD_{B}^{2} = \, VBRT/MBRT^{2}$$ (Note that C ( t )/ AUC can be regarded as a probability density function.) The area under the curve, AUC , is determined by the dose D , bioavailability F and clearance CL : AUC = FD/CL . Equation 1 is used to calculate these model-independent parameters from the parameters of the empirical function fitted to the data. It should be recollected that the parameter MBRT can be interpreted as sum of the mean input time MIT , defined by the dissolution and absorption process, and the mean disposition residence time MDRT : $$MBRT \, = \, MIT \, + \, MDRT$$ (2)
In Eq. 2 , MIT = MDT + MAT , where MDT and MAT denote the mean dissolution time and mean absorption time, respectively. For slow release formulations ( MDT » MAT ), MBRT is mainly determined by MDT and MDRT . Note that the latter is obtained from the reference IV curve using Eq. 1 (see for review [ ]).
Classification of oral concentration–time curves
A crucial step in selecting an appropriate curve model to describe the data is the classification of oral concentration–time curves, C ( t ), as log-concave, non-log-concave functions, or equivalently, in terms of fractional elimination rate, k B ( t ), which is defined as $$k_{B} (t) = \frac{{dA_{B} /dt}}{{A_{e} (\infty ) - A_{e} (t)}} = \frac{C(t)}{{AUC - \int_{0}^{t} {C(\tau )d\tau } }}$$ (3) where A B ( t ) and A e ( t ) are the amount of drug in the body and the eliminated amount, respectively, \(dA_{B} /dt = - CL\,C(t)\) , \(A{}_{e}(t) = \int_{0}^{t} {(dA_{B} /d\tau } )d\tau\) and AUC = A e (∞) /CL . A log-concave C ( t )-curve is characterized by an increasing fractional elimination rate, k B ( t ), (IFR class), whereas for a non-log-concave curve k B ( t ) has a non-monotonic shape (NMFR class) [ ]. This is illustrated in Fig. 1 . Furthermore, the log-concave (IFR) property implies that the relative dispersion of body residence times \(RD_{B}^{2} \le 1\) (a necessary but not sufficient condition for log-concavity). Note also that the exponential tail of C ( t ) is characterized by the decay coefficient \(\lambda = \mathop {\lim }\limits_{t \to \infty } {\kern 1pt} {\kern 1pt} k_{B} (t)\) . It will be shown that a plot of k B ( t ) is a more sensitive indicator of log-concavity than a semilogarithmic plot of C ( t )-data. It appears, however, that that the majority of oral data are not log-concave (i.e., belong to NMFR class). Examples of log-concave curve models are the well known Bateman function $$C(t) = A(e^{{ - \lambda_{1} t}} - e^{{ - \lambda_{2} t}} )$$ (4) ( MBRT = 1/λ 1 + 1/λ 2 ) and unimodal gamma curves [ ] $$C(t) = At^{a - 1} e^{ - bt} a > 1$$ (5) (MBRT = a/ b ). Necessary conditions of log-concavity in terms of dissolution and disposition properties were derived in [ ]. As it will be shown below, this classification is also useful for finding the optimal input function when IV data are available.

Modeling of the rate of drug input to the disposition system (oral and iv data)
When the reference IV data are available, a mechanistic approach based on an input function to the disposition system (also called absorption model) can be applied [ , , , , , , , ]. In this case, first a compartmental model is fitted to the IV data and the parameters of this model are then fixed when fitting the oral data in order to estimate the parameters of the input function, I ( t ) (rate of drug input into the central compartment). For the latter, the weighted sum of IGs model is given by $$I_{IG} (t) = DF\sum\limits_{i = 1}^{n} {p_{i} f_{i} (t)\,0 < p_{i} < 1}$$ (6) where $$f_{i} (t) = \sqrt {\frac{{MT_{i} }}{{2\pi {\kern 1pt} RD_{i}^{2} {\kern 1pt} {\kern 1pt} t^{3} }}} \exp \left[ { - \frac{{(t - MT_{i} )^{2} }}{{2{\kern 1pt} RD_{i}^{2} {\kern 1pt} {\kern 1pt} MT_{i} t}}} \right]$$ (7) is the inverse Gaussian density function [ , , ], D denotes dose, F bioavailability and \(\sum\nolimits_{i = 1}^{n} {p_{i} = 1} .\) MT i and \(RD_{i}^{2}\) are the scale and shape parameter, respectively, of the i th IG function. Note that, \(\sum\nolimits_{i = 1}^{n} {p_{i} f_{i} (t)}\) is the probability density function of absorption time. The mean input time (Eq. 2 ) is obtained as \(MIT = \sum\nolimits_{i = 1}^{n} {p_{i} MT_{i} }\) . Equation 6 represents a generalization and extension of that described in [ , ] where a single IG function was used. For comparison, the usefulness of the unimodal gamma density as input (or absorption) model [ ] is also examined: $$I_{gamma} (t) = DF\frac{{b^{a} }}{\varGamma (a)}t^{a - 1} e^{ - bt}$$ (8) where Γ is the gamma function and a > 1. (cf. Eq. 5 ). Note that I gamma ( t ) is log-concave, in contrast to a sum of IGs (Eq. 6 ). This holds also for the Weibull absorption model [ ] $$I_{weibull} (t) = DFab^{a} t^{a - 1} e^{{ - (bt)^{a} }}$$ (9) where for a > 0, the fractional input rate k I ( t ) = ab a t a −1 is monotonically increasing (IFR).
Thus, analogous to C ( t )-curves (Eq. 3 ; Fig. 1 ) the shape of the input function is characterized by the fractional input rate $$k_{I} (t) = \frac{I(t)}{{DF - \int_{0}^{t} {I(\tau )d\tau } }}$$ (10) Note that an IG density function has an exponential tail with a decay coefficient (linear slope in log scale) of [ ] $$k_{i} (\infty ) = {1 \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {1 {(2MT_{i} RD_{i}^{2} }}} \right. \kern-0pt} {(2MT_{i} RD_{i}^{2} }})$$ (11) This means that in a dimensionless plot (τ = t / MT ) the tail slope is determined by \(RD_{{}}^{2}\) . Note that k ( t ) of a sum of IGs asymptotically approaches to the smallest of the k i (∞) \(k(\infty ) = \hbox{min} [k_{i} (\infty )]\) [ ].
Fitting oral data by a sum of inverse Gaussian functions (only oral data)
In analogy to fitting drug disposition data by sums of exponentials, a sum (mixture) of n inverse Gaussian density functions, f i ( t ), (Eq. 7 ) is used: $$C_{IG} (t) = AUC\sum\limits_{i = 1}^{n} {p_{i} f_{i} (t)\quad 0 < p_{i} < 1}$$ (12)
Since \(\int_{0}^{\infty } {f_{i} } (t) = 1\) , we have \(\sum\nolimits_{i = 1}^{n} {p_{i} = 1}\) . The goal is to estimate the model parameters by fitting Eq. 12 to oral data in order to calculate AUC and the mean body residence time (Eq. 2 ) $$MBRT = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{n} {p_{i} } MT_{i}$$ (13) Note that the hazard rate k ( t ) belonging to the density f ( t ) is defined as $$k(t) = \frac{f(t)}{{1 - \int_{0}^{t} {f(\tau )d\tau } }}$$ (14) (In this terminology k B ( t ) (Eq. 3 ) is the hazard rate corresponding to C ( t )/ AUC ). Note that the k ( t ) of the IG can be expressed as analytical function [ ]. In the following the application of this model (Eq. 12 ) is illustrated by examples.
Data analysis
A population approach (nonlinear mixed-effects modeling) with maximum likelihood estimation via the EM algorithm implemented in the software ADAPT 5 [ ] was used for data analysis. The MLEM program provides estimates of the population mean and inter-subject variability as well as of the individual subject parameters (conditional means). We assumed that the estimated parameters followed a multivariate log-normal distribution, and that the residual error is normally distributed with a standard deviation that is a linear function of the measured quantity C i : $$VAR_{i} = \, [\sigma_{0} + \sigma_{ 1} C\left( {t_{\text{i}} } \right)]^{ 2}$$ (15) ‘Goodness of fit’ was assessed using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and by plotting the predicted versus the measured responses.
The data sets were fitted by a mixture of IGs (Eq. 12 ) and in cases where also IV reference data are available, the procedure was as follows. After fitting the IV data using a two- or three compartment model, the individual parameter estimates (conditional means) were fixed in fitting the oral data using an absorption model (input to the central compartment), leaving the parameters of the input model (Eqs. 6 , 8 or 9 ) as adjustable parameters [ ]. The gamma function (Eq. 8 ) was a built-in function in ADAPT 5 as part of the model library.
Results
Example 1
The data stem from a bioavailability study of an undisclosed sustained-release formulation [ ]. Data from 10 subjects (24 plasma samples collected over 32 h) were analyzed simultaneously. The results obtained with the different approaches are summarized in Table 1 . A sum of two IGs ( C 2IG , Eq. 12 ) fitted the C ( t ) data well (Fig. 2 ). Only a slightly better fit of the data was obtained when based on a fit of the IV data, a sum of two IGs was used as input function I 2IG (Eq. 6 ). A single IG ( I 1IG ) and a gamma density ( I gamm a ) as input functions, however, provided significantly worse fits as indicated by higher AIC values and, most importantly, much higher residual errors, σ 0 due to a failure of fitting the tail (Table 1 ). This is illustrated for one subject in Fig. 3 a. In contrast to C 2IG (Eq. 12 ) and I 2IG (Eq. 6 ), the fit with a single IG as input function ( I 1IG ) leads to a log-concave C ( t )-curve is also shown by the simulated time-course of the fractional elimination rate, k B ( t ) (Fig. 3 b). The worst fit was obtained with I gamma ( t ) (Eq. 8 ); the reason is that this function belongs to the IFR class, i.e., k I ( t ) is increasing (Fig. 4 ), implying that I gamma ( t ) is log-concave. Since, therefore, the log-concave Weibull density (Eq. 9 ) is also per se not able to fit these data, we made no attempt to use this function. Figure 4 also shows that the time course of the fractional input rate, k I ( t ), most clearly characterizes the differences between I 1IG ( t ) and I 2IG ( t ). Note that a growing failure of fitting the tail (increase in σ 0 ) leads to a growing under-estimation of MBRT, AUC and F (Table 1 ). The fact that C ( t ) is not log-concave (Fig. 3 ) explains why the Bateman function (Eq. 4 ) and the unimodal gamma curve (Eq. 5 ) did not fit the data (not shown).

Example 2
In the second example, data originate from a study where 30 mg immediate release tablets of trospium chloride were administered to 23 subjects (18 samples per subject) [ ]. In this case where the increasing part of the C ( t ) curves showed slight bumps, a sum of three IGs ( C 3IG , Eq. 12 ) was necessary to obtain a good fit. Individual fits are shown in Fig. 5 where subjects showing different curve shapes were selected. The goodness-of-fit plot (Fig. 6 ) depicts the individual predicted concentrations versus those observed for all 23 subjects. The residual error was low (σ 0 = 0.05 and σ 1 = 0.07). The estimated values of MBRT and AUC were, 47.1 ± 39 h and 53.4 ± 21.1 ng/ml*h, respectively.

Fig. 5 )
Example 3
In a previous study, the absorption kinetics of propiverine extended-release was modeled as a IG in vivo dissolution rate and an absorbed fraction that increases with intestinal transit time [ ]. Here the same data were fitted assuming a 2IG input rate ( I 2IG ( t ), Eq. 6 ). The fit was nearly as good as the one obtained previously (AIC = −1412 vs. −1447). The present approach yields the interesting result that the absorption rate is bimodal with a small initial peak followed by a maximum after about six hours (Fig. 7 a). The overall picture is that of a delayed increase in absorption. The estimate of bioavailability was nearly identical to the previous one (0.60 ± 0.15 vs. 0.59 ± 0.15) and the mean input time ( MIT ) amounted to 12.3 ± 2.9 h.

Discussion
This paper examines the modeling of oral concentration–time data with the aim of estimating pharmacokinetic parameters. The two main results are (1) that oral data can be well fitted by a sum of inverse Gaussian functions (Eq. 12 ) when IV reference data are not available; (2) that the concept of log-concavity (Fig. 1 ) is useful in model selection; and (3) that a sum of IGs (Eq. 6 ) is a generally valid input function, while the use of the gamma and Weibull absorption models (Eqs. 8 and 9 ) is limited to cases where I ( t ) is log-concave.
In the examples presented, a sum of two or three IGs was sufficient to fit the data directly (Examples 1 and 2) and a sum of two IGs was optimal as an input function when IV data were used (Examples 1 and 3). The latter is the method of choice when reference IV data are available. When both models are compared in Example 1, the fits are equally good only for a 2IG input function, while a 1IG input function failed to fit the tail (Table 1 ; Fig. 3 a). This is also obvious from the monotonically increasing fractional elimination rate (IFR class) of the curve resulting from the 1IG fit; the implied log-concave C ( t ) curve is in contrast to the observed shape (Figs. 2 , 3 a) and the NMFR character of k B ( t ) (Fig. 3 b). The difference between the 1IG and 2IG input function becomes more clear in Fig. 4 , where the fractional input rate is plotted. The 2IG function has a flatter terminal decay slope, \({\kern 1pt} {\kern 1pt} \lambda = k_{I} (\infty )\) . The graph also explains that the failure of the gamma input function to fit the data is due to the IFR character of this function (accompanied by a high decay constant λ). That I gamma ( t ) produces the worst fit is indicated by the highest values of AIC and σ 0 (the steep terminal slope leads to gross underestimation of pharmacokinetic parameters) (Table 1 ). While the gamma density [ , ], or the analogous assumption of a chain of transit compartments [ ], as well as the Weibull density [ , , ] have been successfully used as absorption models in pharmacokinetics, they are not appropriate in this case because of their log-concavity (IFR property); the IG (or 2IG) input function is more flexible in this respect. The present data are an example where unimodal C ( t ) curves are best fitted by a 2IG absorption model; however, as recently shown by Wendling et al. [ ], an extension to a 3IG model may be necessary in some cases. That this has not been recognized in our earlier work lies in the fact that previously the data were individually fitted to the 1IG input model, where the tail was fitted at the cost of initial parts of the curve [ ]. Note that the same effect can be achieved in the MLEM fit when σ 0 is fixed to a small value (not shown).
Example 3 shows that a bimodal 2IG input function (Fig. 7 a) is a useful empirical alternative model to the assumption of an absorbed fraction that increases with intestinal transit time [ ]. That it represents an explanation of the apparent heterogeneity in intestinal drug uptake in terms of the shape of the input function is illustrated by comparison to Fig. 7 b. The input rate may be thought of as the result of a unimodal in vivo dissolution rate (single IG) and a systemically available fraction that increases sharply at time t = 3.7 h from low to nearly complete absorption. In effect, this would lead to a delayed absorption (Fig. 7 a). The apparent transverse heterogeneity in absorption leads to a mean input time of 12.3 h that exceeds the mean in vivo dissolution time of 8.63 h [ ]. The advantage of the present approach is its independence on such assumptions concerning the intestinal absorption process.
That in cases where reference IV data are not available, a sum of two or three IGs well fits oral C ( t ) data is shown in Example 1 (Fig. 2 , Table 1 ) and Example 2 (Fig. 5 ), respectively. Figure 5 illustrates how well a sum of three IGs, C 3IG (Eq. 12 ), fits oral concentration–time curves with different shapes. An important advantage for its application in pharmacokinetics is the tail property of the sum of IGs. As noted above, for the exponential terminal phase of a sum of IGs, the decay coefficient is given by the asymptotic fractional elimination rate, k B (∞), which can be calculated as function of the asymptotic hazard rates of its IG components (Eq. 11 ). Thus, in contrast to other classes of functions like splines, a sum of IGs fits the asymptotic behavior very well as exemplified in Figs. 2 and 5 . This property is important for a correct estimation of parameters (as AUC ) (see Table 1 ).
It is obvious that these models require rich data sets and that sufficient information on the tail part is essential. If the latter is missing (e.g., the last two points in Fig. 3 a), the model may be misspecified (resulting in biased parameters) as shown by the fits with the 1IG and gamma input model in Example 1. One could suspect that in many cases where a reasonable fit is obtained with simple log-concave functions (Eqs. 4 and 5 ), this is due to missing data in the terminal phase. Example 1 shows that the classification of input functions can be useful in model selection. Note that log-concave curves may be generated when the mean input time ( MIT ) is larger than about MDRT /2, i.e., for formulations with a relatively long in vivo dissolution time, especially if the dissolution time is IFR distributed [ ]. Furthermore, C ( t ) is log-concave only if k B ( t ) (Eq. 3 ) is monotonically increasing. It is obvious from the examples (and Fig. 1 ) that on the basis of raw data alone it is difficult to clearly distinguish between log-concave and non-log-concave curves. Even though in this and other studies [ , , , , , ] non-log-concave or multimodal curves were observed, the usefulness of log-concave C ( t ) or I ( t ) models has been well demonstrated in other situations [ , , , , , ]. An apparent advantage of the sum of IGs model is that it fits all classes of curves. A good example of its use in population analysis (NONMEM) can be found in [ ].
Finally, it must be recalled that a one-compartment model is not sufficient to describe the disposition kinetics of a drug. Any modeling analysis that ignores this fact (e.g., [ ]) will lead to biased absorption rate profiles (or parameters). A separate fit of the reference IV data is essential in this case. Note also that this article only deals with the fitting of oral data by empirical functions and not with physiologically based models of drug absorption (e.g., [ ]).
Conclusion
The results indicate that oral concentration–time data can be well fitted by a weighted sum of inverse Gaussian densities. After fitting the IV data separately, when available, a sum of inverse Gaussian densities also appears to be the most useful input function (absorption model) since it is not limited to the assumption of a monotonically increasing fractional input rate. A failure to fit the tail of the curve (or a lack of data in this region) may lead to biased parameter estimates. It is hoped that the usefulness of the proposed approaches will be tested by future applications.
