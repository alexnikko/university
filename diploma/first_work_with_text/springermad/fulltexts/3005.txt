Introduction
Lung cancer is a great public health burden in China with the most common incidence and the leading cause of cancer death [ ]. Though significant progress in diagnosis has been achieved, most lung cancer patients are in advanced stages and metastatic when diagnosed [ ]. Platinum-based chemotherapy regimens remain to be the standard care for lung cancer cases, especially for those in late stages. The 5-year overall survival rate for lung cancer is still approximately 18%. The major obstacles in lung cancer treatment are the late diagnosis, fast onset of chemoresistance, and unpredictable severe side effects.
Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3, a member of cytoplasmic transcription factors, mediates various biological responses induced by cytokines and growth factors [ ]. STAT3 is recognized as an oncogene that promotes tumor cell proliferation, survival, tumor invasion, angiogenesis, and immunosuppression [ ]. Constitutive activation of STAT3 has been routinely reported in a plethora of cancers, including lung cancer, gastric cancer, ovarian cancer, and breast cancer [ ]. STAT3 prevents cell-cycle arrest and cell death through upregulation of survival proteins and downregulation of tumor suppressors, which may counteract the effect of chemotherapeutic agents [ ]. It is reported that STAT3-expressing tumors are likely to be resistant to chemotherapy [ ]. Inhibition of activated STAT3 could reverse resistance to chemotherapy agents in human gastric cancer cells [ ]. However, tumor STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation status was a marker of favorable outcome in breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy [ ]. Cervical carcinoma patients with tumor positive for phospho-STAT3 had a longer disease-free survival [ ]. The role of STAT3 in clinical outcomes in lung cancer patients with platinum-based chemotherapy still needs to be elucidated.
Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), the most common type of genetic variation, can affect gene expression and function [ ]. Rs4796793 is located in the 5′ region of STAT3. It is reported that rs4796793 was associated with the expression of STAT3 expression [ ]. However, few studies focused on the association of STAT3 rs4796793 with lung cancer risk, and prognosis in lung cancer patients with platinum-based chemotherapy.
In the present study, we performed the genotype analysis for STAT3 rs4796793 in a hospital-based case–control study and investigated the association of rs4796793 with lung cancer susceptibility, and clinical outcomes in lung cancer patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy.
Patients and methods
Patients and clinical information
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Xiangya School of Medicine, Central South University (registration number: CTXY-110008-2) [ ]. All subjects signed informed consent prior to inclusion in the study. 498 lung cancer patients and 213 healthy controls were consecutively recruited from November 2011 to May 2013 at the Xiangya Hospital and the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Central South University. All healthy individuals who were enrolled from an annual health check-up at physical examination center of Xiangya Hospital during the same period were used as controls. The healthy controls did not have any disease at physical examination.
All the cases were cytologically or histologically diagnosed with primary lung cancer. Among them, 467 patients received at least 2 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy. Those 467 patients were not given radiotherapy and/or biological therapy before and during chemotherapy and underwent full follow-up. Platinum-based chemotherapy regimens included pemetrexed + platinum (PP), gemcitabine + platinum (GP), paclitaxel + platinum (TP), docetaxel + platinum (DP), etoposide + platinum (EP), and other platinum-based chemotherapy (irinotecan + platinum, navelbine + platinum). The responses to chemotherapy were assessed based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines [ ], which were classified as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), and progressive disease (PD). Those CR and PR were considered as responders, while SD and PD were regarded as non-responders. Platinum-based chemotherapy toxicity mainly included gastrointestinal toxicity and hematological toxicity, including nausea, vomiting, hypochromia, leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. The severity of toxicity was evaluated with the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 3.0 [ ]. Grade 3 or 4 toxicity was considered as severe toxicity. Patients who experienced any type of severe toxicities described above were considered as suffering severe overall toxicity. The demographic and clinical information was collected according to medical records and follow-up data.
DNA extraction and genotyping analysis
Genomic DNA was isolated from 5 ml venous blood using the Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The DNA was stored at − 20 °C before usage. STAT3 polymorphism rs4796793 was genotyped using the Sequenom MassARRAY System (Sequenom, San Diego, CA, USA).
Publication search and inclusion criteria
We searched for original studies investigating the associations between STAT3 rs4796793 and cancer susceptibility using Pubmed ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/ ), Embase ( https://www.embase.com/ ) and Cochrane ( http://www.cochranelibrary.com/ ) up to July 26th, 2018. The following terms were used in combination to retrieve the relevant literature: “signal transducer and activator or transcription 3 or STAT3” AND “genetic polymorphism or polymorphisms or variant or rs4796793” AND “cancer or carcinoma or tumor”. The study was planned and conducted in accordance with the standards of quality for reporting meta-analysis.
The inclusion study must be an original case–control study and had detailed genotype frequency of cases and controls or data to calculate them. Studies that did not provide the raw data of the STAT3 rs4796793 genotype or deviated from the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in controls were excluded. Two investigators reviewed all studies independently to identify and determine the inclusion studies.
Data extraction
Data extracted from the eligible studies included first author’s last name, year of publication, nation, the number of cases and controls, genotypes or allele frequency, genotyping method, source of controls, and HWE in controls.
Statistical analysis
In our genotyping study, the chi-square and Student’s t test were used to assess differences in proportions between groups for the categorical variables. The goodness-of-fit chi-squared test was used to determine the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). Unconditional logistic regression was conducted to estimate the association of STAT3 rs4796793 with lung cancer susceptibility, chemotherapy response and toxicity by calculating the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) with adjustments. All tests were 2 sided, and P < 0.05 was statistically significant. These statistical analyses were performed by PLINK 1.9 and PASW statistics v18.0 (IBM Co., Armonk, NY, USA).
In the meta-analysis, the risk of cancer associated with STAT3 rs4796793 was estimated by calculating pooled OR and 95% CI. The Cochrane’s Q test and I 2 test were used to assess the heterogeneity of effect size among studies. If P < 0.05 or I 2 > 50%, the random effect model was selected. Otherwise, the fixed effect model was used. Sensitivity analysis was used to assess the stability of the results. The inverted funnel plots were performed to estimate publication bias. These statistical analyses were performed by STATA 12.0 (STAT Corp, College Station, TX, USA), and tests were 2 sided with the criterion of statistical significance at P < 0.05.

Unconditional logistic regression analysis with adjustments of age and sex revealed that rs4796793 was significantly associated with lung cancer risk in both additive (adjusted OR = 1.376, 95% CI = 1.058–1.789, P = 0.017) and recessive (adjusted OR = 1.734, 95% CI = 1.007–2.985, P = 0.047) models (Table 2 ). Stratified analysis showed that those age < 50 with rs4796793 CC genotype had lower incidence of lung cancer (adjusted OR = 2.581, 95% CI = 1.006–6.624, P = 0.049) compared with those with GG and GC genotypes. Rs4796793 was significantly associated with lung cancer susceptibility in female (additive model: adjusted OR = 1.677, 95% CI = 1.140–2.468, P = 0.009; dominant model: adjusted OR = 2.014, 95% CI = 1.173–3.457, P = 0.011), NSCLC (additive model: adjusted OR = 1.460, 95% CI = 1.117–1.908, P = 0.006; dominant model: adjusted OR = 1.542, 95% CI = 1.061–2.239, P = 0.023; recessive model: adjusted OR = 1.910, 95% CI = 1.105–3.302, P = 0.021), ADC (additive model: adjusted OR = 1.436, 95% CI = 1.067–1.931, P = 0.017; dominant model: adjusted OR = 1.579, 95% CI = 1.048–2.380, P = 0.029), SCC (additive model: adjusted OR = 1.418, 95% CI = 1.007–1.996, P = 0.045; recessive model: adjusted OR = 2.291, 95% CI = 1.145–4.580, P = 0.019) (Fig. 1 ).

A meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the association between STAT3 rs4796793 and cancer risk. The search strategy retrieved 45 potentially relevant studies. According to the inclusion criteria, a total of 7 studies with 4667 cases and 4282 controls were included finally (Supplementary Table 1) [ , , , , , ]. All patients are from Asian populations. Because of high heterogeneity across the studies, a random-effects model was used. There was no significant association between STAT3 rs4796793 and cancer risk in dominant, recessive, and allele models (Fig. 2 ). Sensitivity analysis was conducted to test the robustness of the results of meta-analysis by omitting one study each time. No single study was found to significantly affect the summary results (Supplementary Fig. 1). Publication bias was examined by visual inspection of funnel plots. Results indicated that there was no significant publication bias (Supplementary Fig. 2).

Association of STAT3 rs4796793 with platinum-based chemotherapy response in lung cancer patients
467 lung cancer patients received at least 2 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy treatment. 184 of them showed a good response while 283 had a poor response to the chemotherapy treatment. After adjustments for age, sex, stage, histological type, smoking status, and chemotherapy regimens, STAT3 rs4796793 failed to be significantly associated with short-term platinum-based chemotherapy response in lung cancer patients (Table 2 ). By subgroup analysis, we still did not found any significant association (Fig. 3 ).

Association of STAT3 rs4796793 with platinum-based chemotherapy toxicity in lung cancer patients
Of 467 lung cancer patients with at least two cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy, 101 and 114 patients suffered severe gastrointestinal and hematological toxicities, respectively. 181 patients experienced at least one type of severe toxicity. Unconditional logistic regression analysis was used to explore the association between STAT3 rs4796367 and overall toxicity with the adjustments of age, sex, stage, histological type, smoking status, and chemotherapy regimens. STAT3 rs4796793 was significantly associated with an increased incidence of severe overall toxicity in both additive (adjusted OR = 1.410, 95% CI = 1.076–1.850, P = 0.013) and dominant (adjusted OR = 1.638, 95% CI = 1.091–2.459, P = 0.017) models (Table 2 ). Subsequently, stratification analysis showed that STAT3 rs4796793 was associated with an increased risk of overall toxicity in those male (additive model: adjusted OR = 1.385, 95% CI = 1.023–1.876, P = 0.035), age < 57 (additive model: adjusted OR = 1.532, 95% CI = 1.031–2.278, P = 0.035; dominant model: adjusted OR = 1.846, 95% CI = 1.035–3.293, P = 0.038), NSCLC (additive model: adjusted OR = 1.399, 95% CI = 1.036–1.891, P = 0.029; dominant model: adjusted OR = 1.630, 95% CI = 1.022–2.601, P = 0.040) patients (Fig. 4 ).

We further evaluated the association of STAT3 rs4796793 with severe hematological toxicity. STAT3 rs4796793 was significantly associated with an increased risk of severe hematological toxicity in an additive model (adjusted OR = 1.352, 95% CI = 1.001–1.826, P = 0.049) (Table 2 ). By subgroup analysis, STAT3 rs4796793 was associated with severe hematological analysis in those age < 57 (additive model: adjusted OR = 1.803, 95% CI = 1.143–2.844, P = 0.011; dominant model: adjusted OR = 2.301, 95% CI = 1.120–4.278, P = 0.023), and SCC (recessive model: adjusted OR = 2.458, 95% CI = 1.104–5.472, P = 0.028) patients (Fig. 6 ).

Discussion
STAT3 is a point of convergence for numerous oncogenic signaling pathways. STAT3 is constitutively activated in various cancers including lung cancer, and associated with progression, metastasis, and poor prognosis. However, few studies focused on the association of STAT3 rs4796793 with lung cancer susceptibility and platinum-based chemotherapy clinical outcomes. In the study, we analyzed STAT3 polymorphism rs4796793 in 498 lung cancer patients and 213 healthy controls. We found STAT3 rs4796793 was significantly associated with the prevalence of lung cancer, the incidence of overall toxicity and hematological toxicity. But it was not associated with platinum-based chemotherapy response. Our findings suggest that STAT3 rs4796793 may be a potential pharmacogenomic factor to assess susceptibility and prognosis in lung cancer patients with platinum-based chemotherapy.
STAT3 was a latent cytosolic transcription factor, and routinely activated or overexpressed in a number of cancers including lung cancer. SNP rs4769793 or a combination of SNPs in LD with rs4769793 might affect STAT3 expression. It was reported that G allele carriers had a tendency for higher STAT3 expression [ ]. Our study found STAT3 rs4769793 G allele carriers had an increased susceptibility of lung cancer, especially NSCLC. Similar to our findings, Zhao et al. [ ] reported that the GG genotype of STAT3 rs4769793 had a significantly increased risk of breast cancer. Xie et al. [ ] found that STAT3 rs4769793 polymorphism significantly increased hepatocellular carcinoma risk after adjusting for covariates including hepatitis B virus mutations in the preS region. Wang et al. [ ] revealed that STAT3 rs4769793 was associated with an increased risk of cervical cancer and poor tumor differentiation. However, Jiang et al. [ ] found STAT3 rs4769793 polymorphism decreased the risk of NSCLC, which was contrasted with our results. We performed a meta-analysis to assess the association between STAT3 rs4769793 and cancer risk. However, we did not find any significant association. We compared the allele frequency among the controls among the studies. We did not found significant difference between our study and other studies. However, compare with the allele frequency between Chinese populations in 1000 Genomes Project ( http://grch37.ensembl.org/index.html ) with the studies, there were significant differences in several studies [ , , , ] (Supplementary Table 2). Those may partly explain the inconsistence of cancer risk.
Because of its dual function as a signal transduction factor and transcription activity, STAT3 was involved in the regulation of cellular differentiation, survival, and proliferation [ ]. STAT3 was considered as a potential therapeutic target and predictor factor of cancer treatment [ ]. The role of STAT3 in cancer treatment was controversial. Berre et al. [ ] proposed that STAT3 was involved in intrinsic drug resistance and STAT3-expressing tumors were resistant to chemotherapeutic agents. Huang et al. [ ] reported that interruption of STAT3 signaling could reverse resistance to chemotherapy agents in human gastric cancer cells. However, Sonnenblick et al. [ ] found tumor STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation status was a predictor of favorable outcome in breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. Walch-Ruckheim et al. [ ] revealed that STAT3 activation rendered cervical cancer cells significantly more susceptible to chemotherapeutic drugs, such as cisplatin or etoposide. So far, few studies paid attention to the effect of STAT3 on clinical outcomes in lung cancer patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. We explored the association of STAT3 rs4769793 polymorphism in lung cancer patients with platinum-based chemotherapy. We did not find the association between STAT3 rs4796793 and chemotherapy response. Yamamoto et al. [ ] reported STAT3 polymorphism rs4796793 might be a predictor of tumor response to multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitors in metastatic renal cell carcinoma in Japanese population. Zhao et al. found that STAT3 rs4796793 was associated with increased progression-free survival in breast cancer patients treated with anthracycline-based chemotherapy.
We also explored the association of STAT3 polymorphism rs4796793 with platinum-based chemotherapy toxicity in lung cancer patients. We found STAT3 rs4796793 was associated with severe overall toxicity, especially hematological toxicity. We did not find a significant association between STAT3 rs4796793 and severe gastrointestinal toxicity. STAT3 played a vital role in hematopoietic homeostasis [ ]. It was commonly activated by thrombopoietic cytokines including thrombopoietin, and vital for the early stage of megakaryopoiesis. The platelet recovery from myelosuppression after 5-fluorouracil treatment was delayed when STAT3 was overexpressed [ ]. So the G allele carriers might have an increased risk of severe hematological toxicity.
It must be admitted that the present study had some limitations. First, we conducted the case–control study in a single ethnicity and relatively small population retrospectively. The results need to be verified in a large-scale prospective study. Second, the combination of chemotherapy drugs may be a confounding factor for chemotherapy response and severe toxicity evaluation. Additionally, carcinogenesis, chemotherapy resistance, and toxicity may result from multiple genetic factors. More studies on different levels are needed.
In conclusion, we investigated the association between STAT3 polymorphism rs4796793 and susceptibility, and chemotherapeutic outcomes in a case–control study of 498 lung cancer patients and 213 healthy controls. STAT3 rs4796793 G allele was associated with an increased susceptibility of lung cancer, especially NSCLC. In addition, we found that STAT3 rs4796793 G allele lung cancer patients with platinum-based chemotherapy had more chance to suffer severe hematological toxicity. Our findings suggest that STAT3 rs4796793 may be considered as a candidate biomarker for the prediction of susceptibility and prognosis in Chinese lung cancer patients. However, more randomized and large-scale clinical trials are needed to confirm the association in the future.
