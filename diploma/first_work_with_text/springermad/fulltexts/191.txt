Highlights
This is the first report of the referral from municipal stroke centers in China. The transfer group had a longer OTD, but a shorter DNT. DNTs of municipal hospitals were far longer than the current international standard. China is currently working to systematically assess stroke centers in various regions and to establish coordinated regional networks. The results of this study have some implications and provide a reference for the construction of green channels in municipal stroke centers in the future.
Introduction
Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) accounts for approximately 80% of the stroke incidence and causes serious social and economic burdens [ ]. Intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA, alteplase) is the primary treatment for AIS. Rt-PA administration within 4.5 h of stroke onset is a treatment modality with a well-established clinical benefit [ , , ]. Several prospective randomized trials comparing rt-PA with standard treatment and pooled analyses have shown a correlation between a shorter time from symptom onset to treatment and better outcomes [ , ]. Therefore, reducing the time to intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) is important for patients with AIS.
Some patients with AIS are admitted to hospitals that are unable to provide IVT and may be referred to a capable stroke center for treatment. A study from South Korea confirmed that a transfer patient’s stroke (OTD) is 40 min longer than that for a direct visit [ ]. Studies have shown that interhospital transfer is associated with significant treatment delays and worse clinical outcomes for AIS patients [ , ]. A single-center study at Xuanwu Hospital in China found that referrals increase the OTD [ ] and considered that the referral system in Beijing was the primary reason for prehospital delays in IVT administration. In addition, Xuanwu Hospital serves the whole country, and its referral mode is different from those of most municipal hospitals. Considering the differences in referral patterns between different levels of hospitals, the impact of referrals on the treatment of patients with AIS in Chinese municipal stroke centers must be investigated.
In the present study, we included AIS patients who received rt-PA at three stroke centers via either interhospital transfer or direct presentation and compared the clinical outcomes and time metrics to analyze the impact of interhospital transfer on IVT, hoping to provide a reference for the construction of green channels in municipal stroke centers in the future.
Materials and methods
Study participants
A retrospective study of three municipal stroke centers was conducted. The data were collected from patients with AIS in Jingjiang People’s Hospital, Zhoukou Central Hospital and Shaoxing Second Hospital. The stroke centers of these three hospitals are responsible for stroke treatment in the area and have a 24-h green channel for AIS patients who are directly treated or transported by district- and town-level hospitals. Notably, most of the district- and town-level hospitals in China do not have a stroke unit and do not provide IVT. Patients in these hospitals are usually immediately recommended to be transferred to a municipal-level hospital.
We retrospectively enrolled patients with AIS admitted to the three stroke centers from the emergency department from October 1, 2016, to June 1, 2018. The inclusion criteria were patients who were (1) admitted to the three stroke centers from the emergency department within 6 h; (2) met the criteria for AIS, with confirmation by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); and (3) were treated with rt-PA.
Emergency medical service routing
The three stroke centers had the same emergency medical service routing. The process was as follows: stroke patients presenting to the centers via private visit or EMS who were identified at the emergency department were able to undergo initial treatment and CT scans. Meanwhile, the emergency doctor contacted a neurologist for consultation in the CT room, even for patients who underwent CT scans in an external hospital. After completing a head CT scan, the patient was handed over to the neurologist. The neurologist recommended IVT after excluding bleeding and assessing the indications for IVT. The dose of IVT was rt-PA 0.9 mg/kg, and the maximum dose was 90 mg; 10% of the total dose was intravenously injected, and 90% of the dose was infused via micropump within 1 h. The stroke unit and emergency room were equipped with rt-PA such that patients could receive treatment immediately after they provided informed consent. We followed the recommendations of the Chinese guidelines for the endovascular treatment of acute ischemic stroke [ ] for patient selection, peri-/postoperative monitoring for the prevention and treatment of complications. The patient would be evaluated for mechanical thrombectomy (MT) indications while undergoing IVT. If the NIHSS score was ≥ 7 on admission and the patient was found to have large vessel occlusion (LVO), MT would be performed after excluding MT contraindications and obtaining informed consent from the family. The evaluation and implementation of MT did not delay IVT. When a patient with MT indications was admitted, doctors notified the digital subtraction angiography (DSA) room to stand by to ensure that the patient could be treated immediately after providing informed consent for MT. After treatment, the patient continued to receive treatment in the stroke unit. We followed the Chinese guidelines for diagnosis and management of AIS 2014 [ ]; the standards of care included monitoring vital signs, controlling blood glucose, and nutritional support, antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy based on the patient’s condition, using neuroprotection and improving cerebral blood circulation with drugs, actively dealing with complications, early rehabilitation and early secondary prevention.
Criteria for IVT
Our study included patients who underwent IVT in three stroke centers; alteplase was used as the thrombolytic agent and was administered strictly in accordance with recommendations [ ].
The main inclusion criteria for IVT were as follows: (1) AIS patients with symptoms of neurological deficits, (2) stroke onset less than 4.5 h, (3) age over 18, and (4) written informed consent obtained from patients or their families. Patients were excluded for IVT if they: (1) had a major head trauma or stroke in the past 3 months; (2) had suspicious subarachnoid hemorrhage; (3) had arterial puncture in the hemostatic site that was not easy to compress in the past week; (4) had a history of intracranial hemorrhage; (5) had intracranial tumor, arteriovenous malformation, or aneurysm; (6) had recent intracranial or intraspinal surgery; (7) had a systolic blood pressure ≥ 180 mmHg a or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 100 mmHg; (8) had active internal bleeding or acute bleeding tendency; (9) had heparin treatment within 48 h (APTT was above the normal range); (10) had oral anticoagulant, international standardization ratio (INR) > 1.7 or prothrombin time (PT) > 15 s; (11) were using thrombin inhibitors; (12) had blood sugar < 2.7 mmol/L; or (13) had an acute infarction larger than 1/3 of the cerebral hemisphere on CT.
Procedure
We collected the patients’ general information and time points. General information included age, sex, smoking status, drinking status, history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, recent stroke, coronary disease, hyperlipidemia, or hypertension, pretreatment National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score and modified Rankin scale (mRS) at 90 days. The time points included OTD (according to the registration time), door-to-needle time (DNT), and onset-to-needle time.
Based on the mode of admission, patients treated with rt-PA were classified into the transfer group (those who were transferred from the field to the nearest hospital and were subsequently referred to the stroke centers) and the direct group (those who were referred directly from the field to thrombolysis-capable stroke centers via private visit or EMS).
Ethics approval and consent to participate
This retrospective study was conducted on already available data or biological material; therefore, we did not apply for formal ethical approval from the ethics committee.
Statistical analysis
Standard descriptive statistics were used, including the mean and standard deviation (SD). Statistical differences between the two rt-PA groups were tested using Student’s t test for normally distributed variables or Fisher’s exact test for dichotomous variables. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify the independent risk factors associated with a poor outcome at 90 days. Two-tailed P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were conducted with SPSS version 20.0 software (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
A total of 1019 AIS patients were enrolled from October 1, 2016 to June 1, 2018, but 548 consented outside of 6 h, leaving 123 indirect and 348 direct patients. Among them, 44 consented outside the treatment window, 73 had contraindications for or declined rt-PA, and 28 had missing data, leaving 326 patients available for analysis. Eighty-four IVT patients were included in the transfer group, and 242 patients were included in the direct group (Fig. 1 ). Fig. 1 Emergency medical service routing for AIS patients.

Baseline characteristics, time metrics and outcomes in the two groups
The baseline characteristics, including age, sex, smoking status, drinking status, history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, recent stroke, coronary disease, hyperlipidemia and hypertension, were mostly similar between the 2 groups. Comparisons between the transfer and direct groups were as follows: the OTD was 124.5 ± 50.6 min versus 83.2 ± 47.2 min ( P < 0.01), the DNT was 53.0 ± 26.3 min versus 81.5 ± 31.1 min ( P < 0.01), and the stroke onset-to-needle time was 177.4 ± 51.0 min versus 164.7 ± 53.3 min ( P = 0.057). No significant differences were observed in the baseline NIHSS score, MT or symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) between the two groups. Among the 326 participants, a total of 192 patients (58.9%) had a favorable outcome (mRS 0-2) at 3 months after stroke onset. Compared with the direct group, the indirect group achieved similar mRS 0–2 outcomes (59.5% versus 58.7%, respectively, P = 0.768) (Table 1 ).

Factors associated with a good outcome at 90 days
Younger age, male sex, the absence of hypertension, and a lower NIHSS score at baseline were associated with a good clinical outcome at 90 days on univariate analysis. In the multivariate analysis, age (OR, 1.034; 95% CI 1.012–1.057; P = 0.002), the absence of hypertension (OR, 1.603; 95% CI 1.000–2.569, P = 0.050), and a lower initial NIHSS score (OR, 1.062; 95% CI 1.024–1.101, P = 0.001) were independent risk factors associated with a poor outcome at 90 days (Table 2 ).

Discussion
The 20-month data from the three stroke centers found that in China’s municipal stroke centers, patients with AIS in the transfer group had a longer OTD but a shorter DNT. Accordingly, the transfer group did not show a longer onset-to-needle time. The mRS results at 3 months supported that a referral did not increase the likelihood of a poor outcome of IVT in patients with AIS.
A single-center study by Huang et al. on Chinese referral delays concluded that the referral system in Beijing was the primary reason for OTD delays in IVT administration [ ], which was similar to our findings. Another study by Huang on DNT delays in IVT administration found that the number of referrals in the lower DNT group was significantly higher than that in the high DNT group [ ], which also confirms our results that the referral group had a reduced DNT time. Based on a Korean hospital study, Dae-Hyun Kim observed a mean DNT of 39.4 min in the referral group, which was significantly lower than 44.9 min in the direct admission group [ ]. Our data showed that the DNT in the referral group was 53 min, which was 28.5 min less than that the direct group (81.5 min), which may be the reason for the lack of significant differences in the onset-to-needle time between the two groups. DNTs in the referral and direct groups were far longer than the current international standard, but this finding might reflect the current status of China’s municipal stroke centers. The DNT before the improvement of this third-grade class-A hospital was similar to that of our municipal hospitals [ ].
The DNT included the transit time in the hospital after admission, the time required for evaluation by an emergency physician, biochemical examination, CT examination, evaluation by a neurologist, and communication regarding the thrombolysis recommendation. The two groups of patients were managed according to the unified green channel procedure. Therefore, in theory, no differences existed in the times required for CT and biochemical examinations between the two groups. Outpatient treatment may reduce the evaluation time of emergency physicians, but this time would not reach 28.5 min. Specialist assessments were performed after CT scans, resulting in no time differences. Therefore, we speculate that the referral group may have an advantage in terms of the communication time regarding the thrombolysis recommendation.
Mendelson [ ] found that obtaining informed consent from patients resulted in rt-PA treatment delays. Huang [ ] revealed that the time-sensitive decision-making process for thrombolytic therapy may be a factor in increased in-hospital delays, and in this study, the median final-test-to-needle time (FTN), representing the decision time, was 30 min. Currently, doctor–patient relationships represent a professional pressure imposed on doctors [ ], which is particularly serious at municipal hospitals in China. Therefore, doctors may overstate the risk of thrombolysis to reduce the occurrence of doctor–patient disputes [ ]. Unlike large influential hospitals, municipal hospitals need more time to obtain informed consent from patients. Therefore, future studies should consider establishing a method of routing stroke patients from primary hospitals.
The clinical outcomes of AIS patients are related to revascularization time [ ], and delays in treatment not only preclude patients from being treated with the available therapies but also influence neurological outcomes [ ]. Most studies have shown that interhospital transfer might be associated with additional treatment delays and consequences [ , , , ]. Our data from three Chinese municipal stroke centers found that referrals did not result in a poor prognosis and did not constitute a risk factor for a poor outcome. Potential reasons for this outcome include the possibility that referral reduced the time required for thrombolysis communication after admission so that referral patients had shorter DNT, insufficient sample size and assessment of outcomes. Although our study did not find that referrals affected prognosis, it does not mean that we support referral. First, the referral group did not have a better prognosis than the direct group. Second, there must be some patients who lost the opportunity for IVT or MT because of transfer delays. However, regional management of stroke can optimize the transport of stroke patients [ ]. China is currently working to systematically assess stroke centers in various regions and to establish coordinated regional networks. In the process of optimizing the role of town/district hospitals in regionalized networks, it should be noted that the DNTs in the referral group are lower, a phenomenon that has not received much attention before.
This study has several limitations. First, although we observed a lower DNT in the referral group and we speculated that this advantage might be due to a reduction in communication time, there were no time metrics to support it. Second, the DNTs in the referral and direct groups were far longer than the current international standard, which is what we need to improve next, and we could not examine whether further time reduction would change the outcome. Third, this is a retrospective study and did not include all patients with AIS in the regions where each hospital is situated. Therefore, we could not examine the exact proportion of patients transferred from non-thrombolysis-capable hospitals in each region. Fourth, patients’ or their relatives’ understanding of stroke and their education level would influence the decision time. Finally, we could not investigate how many patients used EMS initially after stroke among patients with AIS who were transferred from non-thrombolysis-capable hospitals.
Conclusions
Our research found that in three Chinese municipal stroke centers, patients with an AIS referral had a longer OTD but a shorter DNT. The DNTs of municipal hospitals were far longer than the current international standard, and their improvement is an important task.
