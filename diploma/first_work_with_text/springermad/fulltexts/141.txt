Introduction
Myocardial perfusion stress testing is widely used for diagnosis and risk stratification in people suspected of coronary heart disease and ischemia, and over 8 million nuclear myocardial perfusion stress tests are performed in the US every year. Reversible perfusion defects indicate ischemia, while fixed perfusion defects generally indicate scar. Clopidogrel is an antiplatelet agent which is often used to treat patients with coronary artery disease and peripheral arterial disease and has become a cornerstone of therapy in the treatment of acute ischemic coronary syndromes. , Clopidogrel is now also widely used for the prevention of stent thrombosis after coronary stenting and also after peripheral stenting. Patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) who received drug-eluting stents may need to remain on clopidogrel for at least 12 months because of the risk of late stent thrombosis, and because of these reasons, the number of patients taking clopidogrel is increasing although newer agents have become available. Clopidogrel acts via an adenosine diphosphate receptor which is present on the platelet membrane but also on receptors on the membrane of vascular wall cells , and has recently been shown to modulate vasorelaxation - and to improve microvascular endothelial function in patients with stable coronary disease independently of its platelet-inhibitory effects. Because other medications, especially antianginal medications such as beta blockers and nitrates, have been shown to decrease the ability of pharmacologic stress testing to diagnose ischemia, - we examined whether clopidogrel use can negatively impact on the diagnosis of the presence and size of reversible perfusion defects in patients undergoing pharmacologic stress myocardial perfusion testing with adenosine and patients undergoing exercise stress myocardial perfusion testing.
Methods
Data from the Yale University Nuclear Cardiology Laboratory database of 6349 patients who underwent clinically indicated stress testing at Yale New Haven Hospital between 2003 and 2005 were analyzed. The database contains clinical variables of the patients as well as variables of the stress test and of the corresponding nuclear images. Patients who were taking clopidogrel were compared with patients not taking clopidogrel for the presence of and size of reversible perfusion defects on myocardial single-photon emission computed tomography perfusion images. The nuclear perfusion images were quantified with a commercially available software (WLCQ, Medx, Arlington Heights, IL). The sizes of the [reversible] perfusion defects were quantified using the sum difference score on 17 segment heart models. , The quantitation analyses were done automatically by comparing each study with a database of normal studies of subjects undergoing pharmacologic and exercise stress testing, respectively. The attending cardiologist reading the study could call a study normal even if the sum stress score was not zero, but the sum difference scores used in this analysis were the ones reported by the quantitation software. Analyses were stratified for the stress technique (adenosine and exercise).
In order to avoid potential biases associated with the therapy with clopidogrel, we performed a propensity analysis after determining a propensity score for the therapy with clopidogrel. The propensity score was used as an independent variable in the multivariate analysis and, in a separate analysis, was used to pair patients taking clopidogrel with patients not taking clopidogrel in order to perform a matched-pair analysis. All tests are two-sided. A P value of <.05 was considered statistically significant. The statistical software used was STATA version 9.2 and SAS. The study was approved by the Yale Human Investigation Committee for waiver of consent of the study subjects.
Results
Of the 6349 tests, the stress technique was adenosine in 2713 patients and exercise in 3636. At the time of the stress test, 277 (4.3%) of the patients were taking clopidogrel. The patients taking clopidogrel were older, and among them, a higher proportion were men. The patients taking clopidogrel also had more risk factors for coronary atherosclerosis and a lower proportion of scans with normal perfusion (Table 1 ).

After stratifying the patients by stress method (Table 2 ), among the patients who underwent pharmacologic stress testing with adenosine, the patients who were taking clopidogrel had a significantly higher frequency of a history of CAD compared to patients not taking clopidogrel (64.9% vs 28.9%, respectively; P < .001) and a significantly higher frequency of ischemia on the perfusion images (29.3% vs 20.7%, respectively; P = .004). Among patients who underwent exercise stress testing, the patients taking clopidogrel also had a higher frequency of a history of CAD (63.9% vs 9.4%, respectively; P < .001) and a higher frequency of ischemia on their perfusion images compared to patients not taking clopidogrel (23.6% vs 6.3%, respectively; P < .001).

The use of clopidogrel was associated with a history of CAD (odds ratio [OR] 1.96; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23-3.13), a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) including stroke (OR 2.4; CI 1.37-4.24), and the use of aspirin (OR 2.05; CI 1.25-3.36), lipid-lowering drugs (OR 1.68; CI 1.07-2.62), beta blockers (OR 1.7; CI 1.04-2.74), and nitroglycerin (OR 1.8; CI 1.1-3). A propensity score incorporating age, gender, and the above variables was calculated. The area under the curve for the propensity score was 0.83, suggesting a good discriminatory capacity of the model.
The OR for patients taking clopidogrel to have a reversible perfusion defect was 2.75 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.09-3.62; P < .01). After adjusting for the propensity to take clopidogrel, the OR was 1.06 (CI 0.76-1.49; P = .73) for patients undergoing adenosine stress test and 1.60 (CI 0.85-3.00; P = .14) for patients undergoing exercise stress tests.
Multivariate logistic regression analysis after adjusting not only for the propensity to take clopidogrel but also for other variables associated with the presence of perfusion defects on the myocardial perfusion scan, such as obesity, use of medicines (especially beta blockers and calcium channel blockers), blood pressure (BP) response, and heart rate increase during stress (Table 3 ), did not change the association between the use of clopidogrel and reversible perfusion defects in patients undergoing either adenosine stress tests (OR 1.06; CI 0.76-1.49; P = .73) or exercise stress tests (OR 1.58; CI 0.85-2.93; P = .15).

A matched-pair analysis using the propensity score as a pairing variable yielded similar results after adjustment for other variables: OR 0.90 (CI 0.58-1.38; P = .62) for adenosine and OR 1.23 (CI 0.0-3.05; P = .65) for exercise stress tests. The relative frequency of reversible defects in the matched-pair analysis was 33.2% vs 29.3% in patients not taking clopidogrel versus patients taking clopidogrel ( P = .39) undergoing stress testing with adenosine and 17% vs 17%, respectively ( P = 1), in patients undergoing exercise stress testing.
The sum difference scores were similar for patients taking clopidogrel compared to patients not taking clopidogrel (Figure 1 ), irrespective of whether the stress method was adenosine or exercise (1.16 ± 2.34 vs 1.24 ± 2.42; P = .7 and 1.15 ± 2.57 vs 1.24 ± 2.28; P = .8, respectively). Figure 1 The sum difference score of myocardial perfusion scans of patients taking clopidogrel and patients not taking clopidogrel undergoing adenosine and exercise (treadmill) myocardial perfusion stress testing was not significantly different ( P = .7 and P = .8, respectively [ error bars represent the standard deviation])
Discussion
We found no evidence that the use of clopidogrel decreases the likelihood of ischemia on adenosine stress myocardial perfusion scans. Clopidogrel is an antagonist of the platelet receptor P2Y12 and has recently been showed to have vasorelaxing properties , , , that are not correlated to its platelet-inhibitory effects. This may impair the ability of adenosine to induce flow heterogeneity in patients being treated with clopidogrel. Previous reports about various medications and their ability to decrease the accuracy of exercise and pharmacologic , myocardial perfusion stress testing raised the possibility that clopidogrel may have similar effects. However, our data did not confirm the hypothesis.
We used a propensity analysis to adjust for possible biases associated with the use of clopidogrel and used the propensity score for both multivariate analyses and to generate pairs with similar propensity scores (with similar likelihoods of being treated with clopidogrel). The matching enabled a matched-pair analysis which yielded similar results as the multivariate analysis. This makes the results of our study more robust, especially in view of the fact that the study was negative.
Our study used a retrospective database analysis design to answer essentially a physiology question. Because of this, our results can only be hypothesis-generating, and the final result can only come from an experimental study. Ultimately, of course, a head-to-head study would be the best way to investigate the type of relationship studied here. However, we are confident that our results are valid and they could be useful when evaluating the size of the effect, if a prospective study will be done. Moreover our results are in agreement with a small study using exercise stress testing without imaging that also did not show that the use of clopidogrel decreases the extent of ischemia. We believe that the fact that the patient population was tested a decade ago does not affect the validity of our findings, but we recognize that prescription patterns may have changed and that newer antiplatelet agents are now available which were not available in 2005, which may constitute a limitation of the paper.
Interestingly, the use of clopidogrel was significantly associated with the use of other medications for atherosclerosis, suggesting that the treating physicians’ thresholds for treating risk factors for coronary disease may play a role in the decision to start clopidogrel. This has been reported by other authors who looked at factors influencing the decision of clinicians to prescribe treatment for coronary artery disease. However, in our cohort, the patients taking clopidogrel also had significantly more risk factors and had a higher percentage of history of CAD and peripheral vascular disease (PVD) compared to patients who were not on clopidogrel, likely reflecting the perceived benefit of clopidogrel therapy.
The percentage of patients with abnormal left ventricle (LV) perfusion is different from the percentage of patients with ischemia present because the former category includes patients with fixed (nonreversible) defects on their scans. Because we were only interested in the potential ability of clopidogrel to impair the detection of ischemia, the patients who had fixed defects (without reversibility) were not included in the analysis.
The fact that an increasing number of patients with coronary and peripheral vascular disease are taking clopidogrel and the data suggesting that clopidogrel has vasorelaxing properties made the evaluation of the role of this medication on the results of myocardial perfusion testing important. Our results are reassuring in that they strongly suggest that stopping clopidogrel before pharmacologic stress testing is not necessary and that a modification of the pretest protocol is not warranted. This is all the more important for contemporary medical practice, since patients with drug-eluting stents who stop clopidogrel therapy (for instance before surgical procedures) are at increased risk for stent thrombosis and since recent data suggest that prolonged therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel or other thienopyridines beyond 12 months may be beneficial in patients with coronary stents.
New Knowledge Gained
Although clopidogrel can influence coronary vascular tone, it does not decrease the ability of myocardial perfusion SPECT to detect reversible defects. Our data confirm that there is no need to stop the clopidogrel before testing.
