Introduction
Upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) refers to the malignancy that occurs in renal pelvis or ureter. This pyelocaliceal and ureteral tumor is rather rare and only accounts for approximately 5–10% of all urothelial malignancies [ ]. For non-metastatic UTUC patients, radical nephroureterectomy is the standard treatment [ ]. Nevertheless, routine lymph node dissection (LND) for non-metastatic UTUC at the time of surgery has not been strongly recommended in the guidelines and not been widely performed [ ]. According to the previous study, only approximately 15% of UTUC patients received LND at the time of surgery [ ].
The role of LND in the management of UTUC remains controversial [ ]. Although patients with higher T stage (≥ T2) were suggested as the beneficiary of LND [ ], in clinical practice, whether a patient needs LND depends on the surgeon’s evaluation of the patient and tumor features. In patients who have any suspected regional lymph node metastasis during the preoperative assessment, LND might be performed for therapeutic purposes. However, for patients with clinically node-negative stage (no suspicious lymph node involvement), whether LND needs to be given becomes a hard question. Previous study pointed out that the risks of LND-induced complications were the same between cN0 and cN + patients [ ]. Therefore, evaluating the impacts of LND on clinically node-negative UTUC patients’ prognosis might become the determinant to answer the above-mentioned question.
In the present study, based on a large cohort of node-negative patients, we aimed to evaluate the prognostic difference between N0 patients with or without receiving LND to reveal the necessity of LND in the management of cN0 patients. To our knowledge, this study represented the largest research on this unsolved issue.
Patients and methods
Study population
UTUC patients from 2004 to 2014 were identified from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Our inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) diagnosed with upper tract urothelial carcinoma (tumor site: renal pelvis or ureter) by pathological confirmation (ICD-O-3 code 8120, 8121, 8122, 8130 and 8131); (2) non-metastatic (M0) patients; (3) recorded as N0 stage; (4) underwent nephroureterectomy (surgery of primary site code 40); (5) UTUC as the first primary malignancy; (6) known pathologically T stage, laterality of tumor and number of lymph nodes dissected; (7) experienced active follow-up during the study period until the cutoff follow-up date or occurrence of endpoint event. Patients were excluded if (1) they received neoadjuvant chemotherapy or neoadjuvant radiation; (2) positive lymph node was found after LND (pN + stage); (3) they received LND but no definite pathological record of the dissected LNs was found. For the included N0 patients, they were naturally divided into cN0-pNx group (if the patient was diagnosed as N0 without LND performed) and cNx-pN0 group (if the patients were pathologically diagnosed as node-negative no matter what clinical node status they have). So far there are no recommended or standardized template or extent of LND [ ] and the template or extent was largely determined by different surgeon or institution. Therefore, in our study the LND for UTUC patients includes all surgical removal of one or more regional lymph nodes, regardless of the template of LND, which is in line with many previous studies [ , ], including SEER-based studies [ , ]. Our study was granted an exemption from Ethics Review Board in our institution because the SEER Program collects data from population-based cancer registries with anonymous information. It is a publicly available database with no human participants involved. Hence, no ethical approval is needed. The work has been reported in line with the STROCSS criteria.
Covariates and follow-up information
Baseline factors included demographics (age at diagnosis, race, and gender), tumor characteristics (tumor site, laterality, T stage, pathological grade, and tumor size), and treatments (adjuvant radiation and adjuvant chemotherapy). Patients with pathologically well-differentiated, moderately differentiated or poorly/undifferentiated were abbreviated as G1, G2, and G3, respectively. The follow-up information including survival months, survival status, and cancer-specific survival status was collected in our study. The major endpoints of interest in our study were overall mortality and upper tract urothelial cancer-specific mortality. Duration of overall survival (OS) or cancer-specific survival (CSS) was defined as the time from pathologic diagnosis of UTUC to the date of all-cause death or cancer-specific death, respectively.
Statistical analysis
Patients characteristics between groups were compared using Chi square test. Survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method. The log-rank test was used to assess significant differences for OS and CSS. Multivariate Cox proportional-hazards regression analysis was employed to evaluate the prognostic factors, and hazard ratios (HRs) along with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated. To minimize the effects of potential confounding factors in the comparison of survival outcomes between the groups, 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM) was used to identify well-balanced groups. Two-sided p values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS version 23.0 software package (IBM SPSS Statistics, Chicago, IL, USA). Propensity score matching and forest plots summarizing results of subgroup multivariate Cox analyses were completed by Stata version 14.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). Kaplan–Meier survival curves were plotted by GraphPad Prism version 7.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).
Results
Patients’ characteristics
A total of 2731 non-metastatic node-negative UTUC patients who received nephroureterectomy were identified and were included into this analysis. The median follow-up time was 31 months. The N0 stage of patients could be divided into two categories. Among them, 2240 patients were diagnosed as cN0-pNx patients without receiving LND. And 491 patients were given lymphadenectomy at the time of surgery and were found with no lymph node involvement (cNx-pN0). For patients who received LND, the median number of nodes removed was 2 (interquartile range:1–5). The median age of all patients was 72 years old (range 23–96) and the majority were male ( n = 1557, 57.0%), ethnically white ( n = 2371, 86.8%) and with renal pelvic tumor ( n = 1522,67.9%). Among the patients, 345 (12.6%) and 90 (3.3%) patients received postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy, respectively (Table 1 ).

Prognosis of patients in the overall cohort and the matched groups
Survival analyses were conducted according to the cN0-pNx /cNx-pN0 categories. The 5-year OS rates for patients in cN0-pNx and cNx-pN0 groups were 47% and 54%, respectively. Kaplan–Meier estimates and log-rank tests showed that cNx-pN0 patients had significantly better OS than cN0-pNx patients ( p = 0.022) (Fig. 1 a). Multivariate Cox regression analyses further proved that in the overall cohort, node-negative patients receiving lymphadenectomy was an independent favorable prognostic factor for both OS (HR = 0.779, 95% CI 0.661–0.918, p = 0.003, no LND as reference) and CSS (HR = 0.788, 95% CI 0.644–0.965, p = 0.021, no LND as reference) (Table 2 ).

To further limit the effect of confounders, propensity score matching (PSM) was performed for the cN0-pNx and cNx-pN0 patients. Patients in cN0-pNx were 1:1 matched with patients in cNx-pN0 group using STATA software based on the variables: age, gender, race, tumor size, laterality, tumor site, T stage, grade, radiation, and chemotherapy. If a patient has more than one best match, only one of them was used. After PSM, 325 pairs of patients were matched and the patient characteristics of the matched cohorts are provided in Table 1 . The groups were comparable after matching. We found that the cNx-pN0 patients still had significantly better OS ( p = 0.029) and CSS ( p = 0.046) compared with cN0-pNx groups (Fig. 1 C, D). Moreover, multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that even after propensity score matching, receiving regional lymphadenectomy (cNx-pN0) still independently predict favorable OS (HR: 0.665, 95% CI 0.516–0.859, p = 0.002, cN0-pNx as rederence) and CSS (HR: 0.615, 95% CI 0.448–0.845, p = 0.003, cN0-pNx as reference) (Table 2 ).
The above-mentioned results showed that although the patients were all defined as “node negative”, there were still significant survival differences between clinically N0 and pathologically N0 patients, which further indicated that lymph-node dissection could bring survival benefits for clinically node-negative patients.
Prognostic comparison between cN0-pNx and cNx-pN0 patients in subgroup analyses
Subgroup analyses showed that within the node-negative patients with T1 stage (non-muscle-invasive disease, NMID), no difference was observed between cN0-pNx and cNx-pN0 patients (OS: p = 0.604; CSS: p = 0.334). While in T2–T4 patients (muscle-invasive disease, MID), cNx-pN0 patients had a significantly better OS than cN0-pNx patients ( p = 0.003) (Fig. 2 c). Similar results were also observed in subgroup multivariate Cox analyses. The HRs and 95% CIs of subgroup multivariate Cox analyses for cN0-pNx versus cNx-pN0 were summarized in forest plots (Fig. 3 ). It showed that for N0 MID patients, receiving LND could independently predict better OS (HR = 0.744, 95% CI 0.626–0.909, p = 0.003) and CSS (HR = 0.802, 95% CI 0.645–0.997, p = 0.047).

The EAU guideline 2017 of UTUC did not offer sufficient evidence that supported the application of adjuvant chemotherapy or adjuvant radiation [ ]. So we then compared prognosis of cN0-pNx (no LND) and cNx-pN0 (with LND) patients according to whether adjuvant treatment (either radiation or chemotherapy, or both methods) was administered. In the subgroup of N0 patients receiving at least one method of adjuvant treatment, cN0-pNx patients (no LND) had significantly poor OS ( p = 0.006) (Fig. 2 g) and CSS ( p = 0.035) (Fig. 2 H) compared with cNx-pN0 (receiving LND), which was in line with the results of multivariate Cox analyses (OS: HR = 0.565, 95% CI 0.360–0.888, p = 0.013; CSS: HR = 0.607, 95% CI 0.372–0.991, p = 0.046; cN0-pNx as reference). Among patients without receiving adjuvant treatment, compared to cNx-pN0 patients, absence of LND in cN0-pNx patients also showed negative prognostic impact, especially on OS (HR = 0.823, 95% CI 0.690–0.983, p = 0.031) (Fig. 3 a).
Besides, the cNx-pN0 patients receiving LND also showed potential advantages of OS in both G1 and G2–3 subgroups and in both male and female subgroups (Fig. 3 A). As for tumor size, LND seemed to improve OS for both “≤ 5cm” group ( p = 0.034) and “>5cm” group according to Kaplan–Meier analyses (Supplementary Fig. 1C and 1D). But to our surprise, the multivariate analyses revealed that only N0 patients with tumor size ≤ 5 cm could benefit from lymphadenectomy, with a significantly better OS (HR = 0.774, 95% CI 0.628–0.955, p = 0.017) and a very nearly significantly better CSS (HR = 0.775, 95% CI 0.594–1.009, p = 0.058) (Fig. 3 ). Additionally, the Kaplan–Meier analyses also revealed that for N0 ureteral carcinoma, patients receiving lymphadenectomy could enjoy better OS ( p = 0.041) (Supplementary Fig. 2).
Discussion
The necessity of routine lymph-node dissection for non-metastatic UTUC patients at the time of nephroureterectomy has always been in eager debate. Previous studies suggested that LND might improve CSS in patients with high-stage (muscle-invasive) UTUC, regardless of patients’ node status [ , ]. Moreover, in many studies that focused on the therapeutic role of LND, the LND-associated survival benefit was evaluated by comparing survival between patients with pN0 and pNx stage. Several researches revealed a therapeutic role of LND based on results that indicated a better prognosis in patients with pN0 than pNx stage [ , , ], while some other studies failed to find significant difference in prognosis between patients with pN0 and pNx stage disease [ , , , ]. In the present study, using a large patient cohort from the real-world database, we innovatively compared the survival differences between cN0-pNx patients and cNx-pN0 patients and revealed that LND could bring survival improvement even in clinically node-negative patients.
Indeed, before a surgery, it is not hard to declare that LND is needed if this UTUC patient was with suspicious lymph node metastasis. However, in patients with clinically N0 stage (without suspicious LN involvement before surgery), surgeons might find they are in a dilemma to judge whether LND should be performed, because LND might be associated with increased operating time and increased risk of perioperative complications [ ]. Although some studies compared the survival difference between pN0 and pNx patients, just as we mentioned above, the results of those studies could not be the answer of this question. As we know, pNx is a very blurry concept. The patients who did not receive LND could all be called as “pNx patients”, regardless of their preoperative evaluation. According to such categorization, patients that were preoperatively found with enlargement of regional lymph nodes by CT scan (perhaps cN1 or even cN2 stage, which is more likely to be actually node-positive than cN0 patients), for example, should still be included into the “pNx group”, just because they did not receive LND. Therefore, the pNx group in fact becomes a mixture of “pN0” and “pN+” patients and the proportion of pN + was unneglectable. The present study tried to avoid such kind of bias by narrowing “pNx” group down to “cN0-pNx” group, which was more accurate and clinically practical.
We noticed that one previous study by Yoo et al. declared that LND was not associated with improved oncological outcomes in patients with UTUC without suspicious LN metastasis on preoperative imaging studies (clinically node-negative) [ ], which directly gave an answer to the question that if we should give LND to clinically node-negative UTUC patients. But such “conclusion” seemed to be doubtful. First, that study was based on a small and single-center patients’ cohort, which reduced the reliability of the results. Second, in Yoo’s study, LND was even not included into multivariate analyses. What if the results were actually interfered by other confounding factors? Third, no subgroup analysis was carried out, which limited the clinical significance of the study. To our knowledge, our study is the first large-scale research to explore this question using real-world and population-based data and the first study to use PSM cohorts. And the present results exhibited poor prognosis of cN0-pNx patients (without receiving LND) compared with cNx-pN0 patients even after PSM, which from another angle shows the necessity of LND for node-negative UTUC patients.
Compared to cNx-pN0 patients, the worse prognosis of cN0-pNx patients indicated that at least a considerable proportion of them had undetected or unapparent lymph node metastases. Previous studies pointed out that in UTUC patients, the probability of lymph node involvement could be up to 30% [ , ]. This proportion could be reduced approximately 20% if we only took patients without preoperatively suspicious node involvement into consideration. Even so, previous study still reported a proportion of 12% cN0 patients that were finally found to be actually pathologically node-positive [ ]. The survival difference between cN0-pNx and cNx-pN0 groups in our study also reflected the existence of such unneglectable proportion of “concealed” node-positive patients in clinically node-negative group, which was in line with the previous study. Hence, we do think that LND could not only improve prognosis for N0 patients, but could give a more reliable diagnosis of “N0” as well. Although we could not give an exact proportion of “N+” patients that was hidden in our “cN0-pNx” patients, we think this proportion was large enough to drag down the survival rate of cN0 group. Hence, LND could expose these hidden N + patients and wipe out such node metastases.
In the subgroup analyses, some important results were noteworthy. First, muscle-invasive cN0-pNx patients (T2–4) were more suitable for LND compared to NMID patients. This conclusion seemed to be applicable for all UTUC patients according to a recently published meta-analysis [ ]. The EAU guideline 2017 suggested that lymph-node dissection appeared to be unnecessary in T1 patients [ ]. Similarly, we found that it seemed to be unnecessary to perform LND in N0 NMID patients. Moreover, we noticed that in patients with adjuvant treatment administration, application of LND still caused a 43% and 40% decreased risk of all-cause and disease-specific mortality, respectively. These results strongly suggested that adjuvant treatment after nephroureterectomy is incapable of replacing the therapeutic role of LND in cN0 patients. Leow et al. reported that adjuvant chemotherapy might improve patients’ overall survival and disease-free survival [ ], but the routine use of adjuvant chemotherapy in potentially resectable UTUC is not currently deemed to be appropriate [ ]. And no sufficient data supported the usage of adjuvant radiation as well [ ]. Even so, some oncologists still give some UTUC patients adjuvant chemo/radiotherapy even if they were diagnosed with N0 stage. But the findings in the present study might let them down to some degree, because we showed that it was unreliable to count on postoperative adjuvant treatment if you (for some reason) did not perform LND at the time of surgery. As for tumor location, Kondo et al. demonstrated that patients with renal pelvic UTUC who underwent LND had longer CSS than patients who did not undergo LND, whereas no significant difference was observed in patients with ureteral UTUC [ ]. But that study had considerable selection bias because the study was nonrandomized, and the no-LND group comprised patients who were considered unfit for LND, such as those of older age or with severe comorbidities. Our multivariate analyses proved that patients with both renal pelvic and ureteral N0 UTCC could benefit from LND. Last but not the least, patients with small tumor size (less than 5 cm) seemed to benefit from LND more obviously. Through the subgroup analyses, although patients were all N0 patients, we still found the role of LND seemed to be different in some different subgroups. Hence we recommended that demographics of patients and clinicopathological features of the tumor should be fully considered before the LND was given in clinically node-negative patients.
The complication of LND at the time of nephroureterectomy is the main factor that could stop the surgeon from performing the procedure. So far, few studies reported the complications related to LND in UTUC patients and the results were ambiguous. A previous study pointed out that LND might increase operating time and increase the risk of perioperative operations [ ]. But generally speaking, the complications related to the procedure is acceptable [ ]. Intraoperative bowel-related injuries might happen during the procedure. As for postoperative complications, the most common one is hemorrhagic complications which leads to blood transfusion in the postoperative period [ ]. Large prospective clinical trials are urgently needed to adequately assess the complications related with LND at the time of nephroureterectomy.
Although to our knowledge, we included the largest N0 UTUC patient cohort in our study, some inevitable limitations should be acknowledged. First, the SEER registry did not offer information of recurrence status, therefore disease-free survival could not be calculated. Second, the recently updated SEER dataset used “No/Unknow” as one inseparable group in terms of chemotherapy and radiation, which referred to patients with no evidence of chemotherapy or radiation in the medical records. To show our acknowledgement and understanding of the limitations of the SEER radiation and chemotherapy data, we used group named “no evidence” rather than “no” as the counterpart of “yes”. Third, we cannot determine how many “pN+” patients were diagnosed as cN0 in the preoperative evaluation. Fourth, for each individual case, we only know the number of removed lymph nodes but do not know the exact pattern of LND or the sites of removed nodes. In fact, over a decade, different patterns of LND has been applied to UTUC patients [ , , ], but so far no uniform pattern or extent was recommended by the guideline. So the pattern and extent of LND largely depended on the surgeon’s preference, which might lead to an increased heterogeneity in our study. Fifth, no data about the renal function before or after the operation were offered. Moreover, there might be some bias difficult to avoid due to the nature of retrospective studies, thus prospective studies are needed for further verification of our conclusions.
Conclusion
In conclusion, LND at the time of nephroureterectomy could improve survival outcomes in patients with clinically N0 UTUC, especially for those with muscle-invasive diseases (T2–4 stages) or smaller tumor size (≤ 5 cm). Despite the potential increased likelihood of complications, LND needs to be performed in cN0 patients to get a more reliable nodal staging and a better OS and CSS.
More importantly, the surgeon should not consider LND meaningless even if the patients will be given adjuvant treatment after surgery.
