Introduction
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was an immune complex-mediated disease and characterized by intense inflammation and multiple organ involvement [ ], and the underlying causes for SLE susceptibility remains unclear [ ]. Recent study has focused on the genetic interactions involved in SLE, but they did not conclude any specific factor [ ].
Vitamin D (VD) was an immune modulator, produced in the skin [ ] and involved in interleukin-2 (IL-2) inhibition, antibody production and in lymphocyte proliferation [ ]. In addition, SLE susceptibility was related with lower concentration of 25-OH VD [ ], which was reported to have a preventive effect on murine lupus [ ]. VD receptor (VDR), which modulates the transcription of target genes in response to 1, 25(OH) 2 D 3 , also play a role in the immune system. Recent years, more and more studies focused on the impact of VDR gene polymorphisms on SLE risk in different populations, including Chinese population [ , , , , ]. However, studies conducted in Japanese and Chinese patients concluded a diverse result on association between VDR gene polymorphism and SLE [ , , ]. In addition, SLE susceptibility was influenced by many genes and their synergistic reaction, so it was meaningful to investigate the influence of gene–gene interaction on SLE risk. Taken together, the above studies suggest that VDR gene could represent a potential candidate gene for risk factor in SLE. However, results on association between VDR gene and SLE were inconsistent. So in current study, we aimed to investigate the impact of VDR gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), gene–gene interaction and haplotype combination on SLE risk based on Chinese Han population.
Materials and methods
Subjects
A total of 636 subjects were consecutively recruited between March 2007 and July 2014 from the Guizhou Provincial People’s Hospital, including 185 males and 451 females, 210 SLE patients and 426 normal subjects, the mean age of all participants was 43.3 ± 9.4 years (Fig. 1 ). Consecutive, unrelated SLE patients diagnosed according to classification criteria by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) [ , ] were included from the in- and out-patient clinics of a tertiary referral rheumatology center with special interest in SLE. Prevalent in- or out patients aged more than 18 years were eligible for inclusion. The control group had neither family history nor symptoms related to SLE and were randomly selected from the same regions and 1:2 matched to cases on the basis of age (±3 years) and sex. Blood samples were collected for genotyping of polymorphisms from each participant. Written informed consent was obtained from each individual prior to participation in the study. Data on demographic information, life style, clinical information and family history of SLE for all participants were obtained using a questionnaire administered by trained staffs. Cigarette smokers were those who self-reported smoking cigarettes at least once a day for 1 year or more. Body weight and height were measured. Blood samples were collected in the morning after at least 8 h of fasting. This study was approved by the ethics committee of Guizhou Provincial People’s Hospital.

Genomic DNA extraction and genotyping
We selected SNPs within VDR gene according to the following methods, including (1) which have been reported associations with SLE or other immunological disease; (2) minor allele frequency (MAF) greater than 5%. Taking into account the limitations of human, material and financial resources, a total of four SNPs within VDR gene were selected for genotyping in this study: rs1544410, rs2228570, rs7975232, and rs731236. Genomic DNA from participants was extracted from EDTA-treated whole blood, using the DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and stored at −20 °C until use. The genotypes of VDR SNPs were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction–restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR–RFLP) method. The primers for the four SNPs were shown in Table 1 . The reaction volume was 25 mL, containing a Mastermix containing Taq DNA polymerase, dNTPs mix and reaction buffer (Shanghai, China). A total of 0.5 μM of each primer, 2 μl of template cDNA, 9 μl 2.5* Mastermix, and 8.5 μl distilled water, (ddH 2 O) were used in all reactions (in triplicate). Amplification and detection were carried out as follows. The protocol (denaturation 95 °C, 15 s; annealing 60 °C, 60 s; elongation 72 °C, 45 s) consisted of 40 cycles to ensure a linear range of the PCR reaction. Genotyping results were confirmed by randomly assaying 10% of the original specimens for replication to exclude genotyping errors. There were no discrepancies between genotypes determined in duplicate. Table 1 Description and primers used for genotyping for four SNPs ID Chromosome Annealing temp.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed with the SPSS 22.0 software package (SPSS Inc., Chicago) for Windows 7. The mean and standard deviation (SD) were calculated for normally distributed continuous variables and compared using Student’s t test, and percentages were calculated for categorical variable and compared using χ 2 test. The χ 2 test was also used to assess the deviation from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) for genotype frequencies and to examine genotype and allele frequencies between cases and controls. Pairwise LD analysis was conducted using SNPstats ( http://bioinfo.iconcologia.net/SNPstats ). Logistic regression was performed to investigate association between four SNPs within VDR gene and SLE risk. Generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) was used to analysis the interaction among four SNPs, cross-validation consistency, the testing balanced accuracy, and the sign test, to assess each selected interaction were calculated. Permutation testing is also conducted to gain empirical P values of prediction accuracy as a benchmark based on 10,000 shuffles. All reported P values were two-tailed, and those less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Results
A total of 636 subjects were included in this study, including 185 males and 451 females, 210 SLE patients and 426 normal subjects. The mean age of all participants was 43.3 ± 9.4 years. Participant characteristics stratified by SLE cases and controls are shown in Table 2 . The distribution of gender, smoking and marriage, the means of age and BMI values were not significantly different between cases and controls.

In Table 3 , the frequencies for the T allele of rs2228570 and G allele of rs1544410 within VDR gene were significantly higher in SLE cases than that in controls. Logistic regression analysis showed that SLE risk was significantly higher in carriers of the T allele of rs2228570 polymorphism than those with CC (CT + TT versus CC), adjusted OR (95%CI) = 1.61 (1.25–2.11), and was also higher in carriers of G allele of the rs1544410 polymorphism than those with AA (AG+ GG versus AA), adjusted OR (95%CI) = 1.78 (1.34–2.23). However, we did not find any significant association of the o rs7975232 and rs731236 with SLE risk after covariates adjustment.

The impact of the interaction among four SNPs within VDR gene on SLE risk was investigated by using GMDR analysis. Table 4 summarizes the results obtained from GMDR analysis for gene–gene interaction from two- to four-locus models, we found a significant two-locus model ( P = 0.0010) involving rs1544410 and rs2228570, and in this model, the cross-validation consistency was 10/10, and the testing accuracy was 62.70%, after covariates adjustment for gender, age, smoking, and BMI (Table 4 ).

Pairwise LD analysis between SNPs was performed and the D′ values were shown in Table 5 , which shown that the D′ value between rs1544410 and rs7975232 was more than 0.8 (0.862). So we also conducted haplotype analysis between rs1544410 and rs7975232. The results indicated that the most common haplotype was rs1544410-A and rs7975232-G haplotype, the frequencies of which were 0.4701 and 0.5467 in case and control group. Haplotype containing the rs1544410-G and rs7975232-T alleles were associated with a statistically increased SLE risk, OR (95%CI) = 2.08 (1.47–2.72), P < 0.001) (Table 6 ).

Discussion
In this study, we found that both T allele of rs2228570 and G allele of rs1544410 within VDR gene were associated with increased SLE risk in Chinese population. But we did not find any relation of rs7975232 and rs731236 with SLE risk in additive and dominant model in the genotype and allele frequencies analysis. Our study is not the first case–control study to investigate the association between these four SNPs within VDR gene and SLE risk, and previously many studies were conducted to investigate this relationship, however, considering the inconsistent results from previous studies, perhaps substantially different results [ , , ] obtained from several meta-analysis studies on this topic, we think the results obtained from this study are necessary and are meaningful for understanding the mechanism of SLE, particularly for SLE susceptibility lead by VDR gene polymorphisms. In terms of rs2228570 and rs1544410, some studies suggested a significant association between the two SNPs and SLE risk in different populations, including positive and negative correlation [ , , , , , , , , , ]. An early study [ ] suggested an increased distribution of VDR BB genotype and B allelic frequencies in the Chinese SLE patients in Taiwan. However, there were no associations between the frequency of VDR allelic variations and clinical manifestations, laboratory profiles, or lupus nephritis, and they also suggested that the VDR Fok I start codon polymorphism is not related to patients with SLE in Taiwan in their another study [ ]. And subsequently, several studies also concluded negative results. However the sample size in the two studies was relatively small, so the results were not stable. Monticielo et al. [ ] clearly indicated that the rs2228570 and rs1544410 of VDR gene are not risk factors for SLE, supporting the idea that VDR polymorphisms influence SLE development according to the genetic background of the studied population, this study was performed for Brazilian, and the sample size of this study was also smaller than that in our study. Abbasi et al. also did not find any association between VDR gene rs1544410 polymorphisms and SLE, the different study population (Iran population) and small sample size (105 participants including 60 SLE patients) may be the main reason for different conclusion. Mostowska et al. [ ] suggested that there was no association of the studied VDR rs1544410, rs7975232, and rs731236 polymorphisms with clinical manifestations and laboratory profiles in patients with SLE, but indicates that the studied VDR rs2228570 variant might increase the risk of some clinical presentations in patients with SLE, this study just were performed for women, sex difference may lead to different results with current study. Kaleta [ ] and Silva et al. [ ] also concluded the similar results with fore-mentioned studies, and they indicated that no association was reported between VDR polymorphisms and SLE susceptibility. A Chinese study [ ] found that the frequency of B allele was higher in SLE than in controls, there were no differences in the genotypes of the BsmI polymorphism between SLE and healthy controls, which suggested that the BsmI gene might not be a risk factor for SLE. In contrast these studies, some literatures also concluded opposite results. Carvalho et al. [ ] confirms a possible role of VDR gene polymorphisms in SLE. A positive association was found between VDR polymorphisms and SLE severity (chronic damage). The presence of CT genotype of rs2228570 seems to confer a worse prognosis and may constitute a risk factor for higher long-term cumulative damage in SLE patients. Some meta-analysis also confirmed the association between VDR gene and SLE risk. Mao et al. [ ] suggested that rs1544410 B allele may be a risk factor for SLE onset among overall populations and Asians, and rs2228570 FF genotype is a risk factor for SLE susceptibility in Asians. Study by Xiong et al. [ ] also suggested that the rs2228570 and rs1544410 polymorphism are associated with increased risk of SLE, especially in the Asian population. Lee et al. [ ] reported that associations were found between the VDR rs1544410 polymorphism and susceptibilities to SLE in Asians. In the article by Hu et al. [ ] indicated that no positive findings were reported in Caucasian population and in the overall analysis, however in Asian population, rs1544410 Bb + BB genotype and B allele can significantly increase the SLE risk. Another meta-analysis [ ] also concluded the same results with study by Hu et al.
The multiple phenotypes, such as SLE, were a result of many gene polymorphism and gene–gene interactions; hence, it was necessary to investigate the impact of gene–gene interactions on SLE risk. In this study, we found a significant gene–gene interaction between VDR rs1544410 and rs2228570 polymorphisms. To date, less study focused on the impact of VDR gene–gene interaction on SLE risk in Chinese population. The results of this study suggest that the risk of SLE may be modified by the two genetic variants and they influenced with each other in susceptibility to SLE risk. Loci that are located nearby on the same chromosome may be in LD. But we did not found a strong chain reaction between rs1544410 and rs2228570 polymorphisms, so this interaction effect was not lead by LD between the two SNPs; however, we found that the D′ value between rs1544410 and rs7975232 was more than 0.8 (0.862), it shown a strong chain reaction. So we also conducted haplotype analysis between rs1544410 and rs7975232. The results indicated that the haplotype containing the rs1544410- G and rs7975232-T alleles were associated with a statistically increased SLE risk.
Our study has several limitations. Firstly, the sample size in our study was relatively small, and future study with larger sample size should be conducted for confirming the association. Secondly, more SNPs within VDR gene should been included in the analysis. Thirdly, gene–environment interaction should be investigated in the future studies, and more validation studies were needed to prove the conclusions obtained in this study.
In conclusion, we found that rs2228570 and rs1544410 within VDR gene, their interaction and haplotype containing the rs1544410-G and rs7975232-T alleles were all associated with increased SLE risk.
