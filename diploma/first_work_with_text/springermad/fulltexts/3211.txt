Introduction
Transmission Raman Spectroscopy (TRS) has become an increasingly accessible technology for the analysis of pharmaceutical materials [ , , ]. Particular attention has focused on the quantitative assessment of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) content in tablets, where the high spectral resolution, specificity, and complementary relationship to near infrared (NIR) have afforded scientists a new look into tablet analyses [ ]. Traditionally, NIR has dominated the landscape for non-destructive spectroscopic assays of tablets with many examples documented in the literature [ , ]. However, as a result of its enhanced specificity, Raman is very capable of simplifying the method development process, where the perception of complex black-box chemometric methods often used in NIR may be avoided. The complementary nature of Raman and IR has the potential to enable methods that simply are not feasible with IR (or NIR) due to specific molecular properties to be realized with Raman.
Transmission NIR analysis of pharmaceutical tablets is limited to tablets of modest weight or thickness. Tablets of ~3 or 4 mm thick typically represent the upper bounds for quantitative analysis of tablets by NIR due to the noisy spectra derived in transmission mode. Even for typical tablets of ~2–3 mm thickness, NIR may require 30 s or so signal averaging to afford spectra of sufficient signal to noise, while it may take a few seconds with Raman [ ]. With available commercial technology, quite thick tablets can be analyzed using TRS. These large tablets would often only be encountered for higher drug loaded products, while high potency (low drug load) tablets are usually small tablets in the 100 to 300 mg mass range. Consequently, the larger tablets have typically been explored via reflectance methods without significant problems.
An obvious area of opportunity that TRS can differentiate itself and provide a possible solution is that of bilayer, or generically, multilayer tablets, where two or more therapeutic ingredients are compressed into a single tablet. In such tablets, a layer of a first product or material is deposited into a die cavity and gently compressed, with a subsequent second product being laid down on top and finally compressed into a two-layer stratified tablet. These types of tablets are an essential element to rapidly advancing fixed dose combination (FDC) therapies for a variety of therapeutic products. FDC therapies are also encountered for nutraceuticals and over-the-counter medicinal products. Nondestructive transmission NIR testing of bilayer tablets was explored by Ito et al. [ ], where both actives in the product were quantified directly by assuming a constant composition for each layer, with varying thickness. Under these assumptions, it is possible to predict the total mass of each layer. In contrast, Rodrigues [ ] used an alternate sample preparation approach by grinding the bilayer tablet, remixing it, and compressing a monolithic tablet. Since these tablets are of constant mass, it is possible to extract out the concentration of the multiple actives from the homogenized tablet, but it is not possible to separate out the mass versus concentration question again for the starting bilayered tablet which is important in assessing process issues and identifying appropriate corrective actions. During routine manufacturing operations, these approaches may prove somewhat useful, but in developing the methods and showing acceptable validation, it is essential to separate the response into the individual contributions from blend concentration and layer weight for each layer. This knowledge is also beneficial to pharmaceutical process scientists to detangle risks pertaining to formulation segregation potential as compared to issues related to accurate and precise layer weight control. Obviously, reflectance NIR or Raman can prove beneficial in assessing the active concentration within each layer, but that only answers part of the question and cannot determine the tablet layer weight.
TRS can probe much larger tablets than NIR which is of particular interest for bilayer tablets, but it suffers identical challenges in calibration set design as NIR methods. Currently, the standard approach for transmission NIR quantitative analysis is to prepare tablets of varying composition across an ~70–130 % concentration range and then compress them into tablets of varying thickness. Using appropriate normalization algorithms, like multiplicative scatter correction (MSC) or standard normal variate (SNV), the tablet thickness or mass contributions are removed so that the pathlength is corrected to be a constant factor. The resulting preprocessed spectra are then regressed against the HPLC (or other suitable reference)-determined concentrations, with the final result obtained by multiplying the output of the model by the tablet weight.
Similar mathematical models have been developed for use in TRS applications to predict the API content in single layer homogeneous tablets by Johanssen et al. [ ] and by Fransson et al. [ ]. To show the viability of uniform sampling of bilayer tablets, Matousek and Parker [ ] also highlighted that the orientation of layers sample resulted in similar transmission Raman spectra showing that both layers were at least partially sampled in transmission geometry. Matousek et al. [ ] have applied numerical analysis via Monte Carlo simulations along with experimental evidence to demonstrate that the sampling in layered systems will be non-uniform. Their results indicate that the axial sampling efficiency increases towards central portion of the matrix and will correspondingly be oversampled relative to the top and bottom surfaces of the tablets. This will potentially impact the quantitative capabilities for bilayer tablets in a deleterious manner.
Monte Carlo simulations rely on a fundamental understanding of photon transport through scattering media, and estimates for the probability of a Raman event happening within a particular voxel are based on the samples scattering and absorption coefficients. Classical photon radiation principles such as the Kubelka-Munk (KM) two-flux model and Chandrasekhar Radiation Transport model (CRT) have been widely used in paper coating, printed paper, paint, and other opaque samples [ , ]. However, the need to implement these analyses to develop an analytical procedure to quantify bilayer tablets represents an unusual level of complexity for routine method development and would be burdensome for the industry to easily adopt. In addition, any quantitative methods that are developed would require validation as per ICH Q2 (R1) expectations, to show the accuracy, precision, robustness, etc. of the final methods. An alternate approach was given by Schrader and Bergmann [ , ] who modified the Kubelka-Munk theory to apply to the Raman phenomenon (herein referred to SKM) and successfully described the quantitative behavior in transmission and back reflection geometries. Oelkrug et al. [ ] have recently provided a detailed quantitative assessment of the Raman response for a variety of different turbid samples that even included a transflectance analysis option.
In this paper, we have attempted to experimentally breakdown the various contributions to Raman signal growth and loss to enable simplified procedures to facilitate the development of TRS methods for bilayer tablets. We will discuss TRS results from well-structured single layer, bilayer, and multi-layered tablets in order to understand how to separate out the various contributions from API concentration and layer thickness information.
Experimental
Materials were selected using APIs that showed minimal spectral overlap allowing for straightforward spectral analysis to be applied. Two APIs, BMS-A and BMS-B, were used in formulation A and formulation B, respectively.
All single layer and bilayer tablets were prepared manually on a Carver press with 3/8 inch diameter flat face tooling with a main compression load of 2 tons for 20 s and the solid fraction of the tablets was nominally the same. For bilayer tablets, a first layer was weighed and manually dispensed into the die cavity, spread uniformly across the cavity, and gently pre-pressed. The second formulation/excipient portion was subsequently added on the top of the compressed first layer and pressed together. Three different unique layer materials were utilized within this study: formulation A, formulation B, or lactose monohydrate (supplied from Sheffield Biosciences, WI).
Transmission Raman spectra were collected using a Cobalt TRS 100 spectrometer (Cobalt Light systems Ltd, UK). The laser wavelength was 830 nm and was set to 0.5 W for all of the experiments. The single scan acquisition time was 0.5 s per measurement and 45 co-additions were employed to improve signal to noise ratio for thicker tablets, resulting in a total scan time of ~23 s for all samples. With such signal collection, the signal to noise ratio for all samples, even the 7-mm-thick tablets, was sufficiently high to perform all analyses. Spectra were collected from approximately 40 to 2,400 cm −1 at a resolution of 0.2 nm (alternately the resolution varies from 2.9 to 1.9 cm −1 in going from 40 to 2,400 cm −1 ). A constant laser illumination diameter of 3.0 mm and Raman collection diameter of 6.0 mm was employed. Consequently, results and conclusions derived from this study should not be generalized to all illumination and collection optics designs. All tablets/plates were placed onto an opening in a multi-well autosampler for analysis. The experimental presentation of the samples to the instrument is given in Fig. 1 . The laser source always comes from the bottom. Spectra were recorded as Grams spc files and imported into either The Unscrambler (Camo, Sweden) or TQ Analyst/OMNIC (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Madison, WI) software packages for data inspection and quantitative analysis. All quantitative analysis in this study used a simple two-point baseline corrected univariate peak intensity for BMS-B and BMS-A that have unique peaks at 737 and 1,226 cm −1 , respectively.

Theory
During a TRS measurement, the laser photons elastically scatter as they migrate through a tablet, with a very small fraction of photons inelastically scattering and converting to Raman photons which again undergo migration, scattering, or absorption. Only those Raman photons that traverse the tablet and reach the collection optics will be measured. Consider a bilayered tablet that contains a layer with an active API and a second layer with an inert material. In the API layer, API Raman photons are generated, scattered, and migrated out; in the non-API layer, the API Raman photons decay due to multiple scattering and migration. Therefore, the API Raman intensity measured at the detector is considered as a function of three variables: the API concentration and the thickness of each layer $$ {I}_{\mathrm{API}}=A\times g\left(x,\ {t}_{\mathrm{api}}\right)\times f\left({t}_{\mathrm{non}\hbox{-} \mathrm{A}\mathrm{P}\mathrm{I}}\right) $$ (1)
where g ( x , t api ) describes the Raman photon generation and migration in the API layer and f ( t non-API ) is the function of the API Raman photon decay in the non-API layer, A is a scalar related to the initial laser intensity, x is the concentration of the analyte of interest, and t is the individual layer thickness.
Schrader and Bergmann [ ] applied the SKM model to Raman scattering in single component crystalline powders and proposed a general solution to predict the transmitted Raman signal intensity as shown in Eq. 2 . $$ {I}_{\mathrm{R}}={I}_0\frac{s\cdot k}{a}\cdot \frac{\left({k}^2d-r\right) \sinh kd+\left(r+a\right)kd \cosh kd}{{\left[\left(a+r\right) \sinh kd+k \cosh kd\right]}^2} $$ (2)
where
I R is the transmitted Raman photon intensity, a is the Naperian absorption coefficient, r is the Naperian scattering coefficient, s is the Naperian Raman scattering coefficient in units of reciprocal centimeters (cm −1 ), d is the thickness of the sample, I o is the incident laser beam intensity, and k 2 = 2 ar + r 2 as per Kubelka-Munk theory. The SKM model with serve as a starting point for understanding the layers response within the layered tablets.
In trying to understand the propagation of photons though the bilayer samples in the real-world sample of interest, a series of studies were designed to simplify the contribution for various elements that will pertain to separating the signal response contributions from each layer in a bilayer product that has both a varying thickness (or mass) at a constant porosity and with varying concentration of actives present in each layer. The sample arrangements are shown in Fig. 1 .
Results/Discussion
In the following sections, the individual contribution of x , t API , and t non-API to API Raman signal, as well as the expression of functions of g ( x , t api ) and f ( t non-API ) have been explored by using tablet configurations c, d, and e in Fig. 1 for formulation A, formulation B, and lactose monohydrate. In cases where there are two APIs, one in each layer, the API layer will pertain to the API of interest and the non-API layer will be the other layer, unless otherwise stated.
To illustrate the responses from the two formulations used throughout the study, representative TRS spectra are shown in Fig. 2 for (a) BMS-A tablet, (b) a BMS-B tablet, and (c) a 1:1 BMS-A/BMS-B bilayer tablet. BMS-B and BMS-A have unique peaks at 737 and 1,226 cm −1 , respectively, which were selected for the drug content estimation. Fig. 2 Raman spectra of reference tablets.

Experiment 1: Single Block Tablets Versus Stacked Plates: Effects of Internal Interfaces (Configuration A)
In general for a quantitative determination of the content of an analyte, it is necessary to identify the factors that dictate the absolute magnitude of the API Raman signal intensity. Assuming constant instrument settings, for bilayer tablets, it is basically the API concentration of the layer of interest and the thickness of each layer. Therefore, calibration samples should cover these variables in an appropriate manner to ensure robustness of a derived model for future prediction across the expected range over which these properties are likely to vary, resulting in a large number of samples required for effective calibration, which makes sample preparation a significant task. To simplify the sample preparation, it is proposed that, rather than producing real bilayer tablets, we can model bilayer tablets by stacking a series of thin plates as surrogates for feasibility studies. The presence of additional polished surfaces and air gaps at the interface of the plates potentially causes a loss of photons [ , ]. To demonstrate the viability of using stacks, several 40 mg lactose monohydrate thin plates of similar thickness were prepared and placed on top of a 40-mg BMS-B tablet with increasing numbers, and the Raman response was compared to a series of single lactose tablets with increasing weight and thickness that were placed on-top of the same BMS-B tablet (Fig. 1a ). These tablets were prepared to match the cumulative size and total porosity of the stacked lactose layers/plates. It is assumed that the 40-mg BMS-B plate generates the same BMS-B Raman photon response and that any differences will arise from the presence or absence of the additional layer interfaces and differential losses from the dispersion of the Raman photons away from the collection optics. Therefore, by comparing the decay of I BMS-B for the above two sets (stacked lactose plates versus matched monolithic lactose tablets), we can establish the effect of the air-sample interface. Figure 3 highlights that the two data sets are super imposable with identical decay profiles, indicating that the physical interfaces between lactose thin plates did not present any noticeable impact on the photon migration. Consequently, the stacked thin plate model will be applied for the remainder of the studies unless otherwise stated. Fig. 3 Intensity of BMS-B of regular tablets and stacked plates
Experiment 2: Effect of Tablet Orientation (Configuration B)
The effect of tablet orientation on the TRS signal was studied to establish the importance of the order of placement on the Raman stage since the available literature has been somewhat contradictory. The BMS-A signal at 1,226 cm −1 and BMS-B signal at 737 cm −1 were compared using a series of bilayer tablets with increasing weight of BMS-A from 96 to 192 mg and consistent weight of BMS-B (120 mg) at two orientations, with either BMS-A layer facing the laser source or facing the detector. Figure 4a shows that BMS-A has higher Raman intensity when the BMS-A layer faces towards the collection side than towards illumination side and the ratio of the values for the two orientations of different tablets is in a range of 1.1 ± 0.02. However, the orientation did not significantly affect the BMS-B data set with the ratio of the two measurements being approximately 1 for all the tablets. Townshend et al. [ ] also performed TRS measurements while flipping the tablets; however, rather than directly comparing the Raman intensity, they studied the photon attenuation coefficient as a function of tablet thickness and determined that attenuation coefficient was not impacted by tablet orientation. In our study, since the ratio of the signals was significantly different for the two materials (BMS-A vs BMS-B), then the tablet orientation should be controlled during analysis. This is not surprising since the Raleigh scattering and absorption coefficients for the different layers may be different. Fig. 4 Comparison of Raman response for two tablet orientations: a Raman intensity of BMS-A at 1,226 cm −1 and b Raman intensity of BMS-B at 737 cm −1
Experiment 3: Effect of API Concentration (x) (Configuration C)
The KM model relates sample concentration to the intensity of spectra in a manner analogous to the way Beer-Lambert’s law relates band intensities to concentration for transmission measurement for dilute, non-scattering samples. Basically, with constant scattering coefficient and infinite dilution, the reflectance spectral response is linearly related to the sample concentration. The effect of API concentration on the Raman intensity has been widely studied in blends, capsules, and also single layer tablets with constant tablet thicknesses [ , , ]. These studies suggest a linear relationship between TRS signal and API concentration for samples of constant pathlength as expected.
The TRS intensity was determined at different API concentrations of the API layer in a bilayer tablet. The thickness of each layer was kept constant (1.9 mm and 160 mg) with the only variable being the BMS-A API concentration which varied between 80 and 120 % of the target concentration. BMS-B was locked to a single composition and thickness. The BMS-A TRS intensity was plotted as a function of BMS-A API content in the bilayer tablets as shown in Fig. 5 . As expected, a linear relationship was obtained, confirming the capability of measuring API concentrations within bilayered tablets if the thickness of individual layers is fixed. However, as shown in Experiment 1, the second layer attenuates the signal and consequently the impact of the presence of a second layers needs to be quantitatively assessed. Fig. 5 Dependence of Raman signal on BMS-A concentration at consistent thickness of individual layers
Experiment 4: Effect of Thickness of Non-API Layer (t non-API) (Configuration C)
Sample configuration D was established to study the effect of thickness of the non-API containing layer on the API Raman signal from the API layer. Two individual plate stacks of BMS-A and BMS-B were arranged as a model bilayer tablet. The API layer (BMS-A) was kept constant at two thickness levels of either 1.3 mm (110 mg) or 1.9 mm (160 mg) while the thickness of non-API layer (BMS-B) was increased from 0.5 to 6.7 mm (40 to 600 mg) at each BMS-A weight level. The TRS intensity of BMS-A as a function of the weight of BMS-B layer is shown in Fig. 6 . Masking the Raman generating layer with an increasingly thick stack of pellets resulted in a simple exponential decay of the observed Raman intensity. The decay coefficients for the 110- and 160-mg BMS-A tablets were 0.957 and 0.959, respectively, which are practically equivalent, as expected since the decay behavior is dictated by the optical properties of the sample which are the same for the two sample sets. An exponential decay is expected when one considers a diffusion process whereby the Raman photons have an increasingly high chance of travelling away from the central axis of the tablets via scattering or through their elimination by absorption the longer that it stays within the tablet matrix and consequently has a lower detection probability. The exponential relationship of signal and depth profile has been predicted by the Kubelka-Munk model and widely observed in previous studies of both backscattering Raman and TRS [ , , ].

Experiment 5: Effect of API Layer Thickness (Configuration E)
The impact of tablet thickness on the TRS signal has been discussed for single layer tablets by Eremeeva and Vorsina [ ] during the early days of Raman development. In their study, it was demonstrated that transmission Raman spectra from powdered samples yielded maximum Raman intensity for 2 mm thick cells, irrespective of the sample type. Additionally, they presented results showing that removing the internal scattering of the sample matrix by either forming transparent alkali halide pellets or by suspending the sample in an immersion liquid of matching refractive index highly enhanced the Raman signal through eliminating the scattering losses. These profiles were similar in nature to those described by Schrader and explained using the SKM model [ ]. More recently, Johanssen et al. [ ] showed the same experimental observation for mannitol tablets, showing a maxima at ~1.6 mm and also provided a qualitative discussion regarding the trade-off of increasing the sample thickness that increases the absolute number of Raman photons generated while simultaneously increasing the probability of scattering losses from the longer photon pathlength.
Single layer BMS-A and BMS-B tablets were prepared across a thickness range of ~0.5 to 8 mm (40–700 mg). For BMS-B, the Raman spectra display a maximum intensity at ~2.1 mm (180 mg), followed by a significant decrease in intensity. BMS-A shows a similar pattern with the maxima at about 1.6 mm (144 mg).
The SKM model [ , ] was applied and the experimental data for single layer BMS-A and BMS-B tablets were fit using simple linear regression to Eq. 2 . Figure 7a, b shows the best fit for the measured Raman intensities and Table 1 summarizes the estimates for coefficients a , r , and s as per Eq. 2 . The coefficients describing the optical properties of the layers are actually attempts to simplify the analysis since these samples are multi-component, particulate systems where each component has its own optical properties. Hence, a true analysis would require a complex matrix of coefficients, for each individual component. This is overly complex and may not be practically relevant. In addition, the magnitudes of the Raman scattering, the Raleigh scattering, and the absorption coefficients are somewhat arbitrary since instrumental factors preclude true measurements of these parameters; however, within the constraints of the experiments conducted in the study, they do give the ability to model the data effectively. The BMS-A sample set shows a weaker Raman response and the attenuation for thicker samples is more pronounced due to the increased a and r terms, in spite of the larger Raman scattering coefficient. Fig. 7 Fitting SKM model to a monolithic BMS-A tablets; b overlay of monolithic BMS-B tablets, bilayer tablets with 110 mg BMS-A, and bilayer tablets with 160 mg BMS-A and increasing thickness/weight of BMS-B Table 1 Summary of regression coefficients in KM model s a r Regular BMS-A 2.193 0.000591 1,163.47 Regular BMS-B 4.205 0.00037 1,066.26 Double layer 110 mg BMS-A 1.548 0.00032 1,496 Double layer 160 mg BMS-A 0.973 0.000392 1,355.26 I 0 was constrained to be the same for all fits
The effect of thickness of the API layer was also assessed on bilayer tablets. Two sets of tablets were used, which have increasing thickness (weight) of BMS-A layer and fixed thickness of BMS-B layer at either 1.2 mm (110 mg) or 1.9 mm (160 mg), respectively. Figure 7b compares the Raman signal for these bilayer stacks, highlighting the similarity of the single tablet behavior and the bilayer stacks. Effectively, an attenuation of the Raman response from the first layer was observed as a result of the BMS-B tablet acting as a diffuser. The intensity of the response for the API Raman signal was modeled using Eq. 2 as a function of t API . The two sets of tablets showed very comparable a , r , and s values. The different I 0 value is a result of the different thickness of non-API layer of two tablet sets, which results in a differential loss of laser intensity.
Experiment 6: Effect of t API and t non-API for a Constant Total Tablet Thickness
Based on various observations, we can clearly think of each layer as two seperate and approximatly independent photon transport problems, where the SKM model (Eq. 2 ) is used to model the active layer response and a simple diffusional decay models the non-API layers contribution. The total transmitted Raman response is therefore calculated by: $$ {I}_{\mathrm{API}}={I}_0\frac{s\cdot k}{a}\cdot \frac{\left({k}^2{t}_{\mathrm{API}}-r\right) \sinh k{t}_{\mathrm{API}}+\left(r+a\right)k{t}_{\mathrm{API}} \cosh k{t}_{\mathrm{API}}}{{\left[\left(a+r\right) \sinh k{t}_{\mathrm{API}}+k \cosh k{t}_{\mathrm{API}}\right]}^2}\times A\times \exp \left(-K{t}_{\mathrm{non}\hbox{-} \mathrm{A}\mathrm{P}\mathrm{I}}\right) $$ (3) where t API is the thickness of the API layer, t non − API is the thickness of the non-API layer, and K is a pseudo-diffusion or decay coefficient for the Raman photon response through the non-API layer.
To challenge this equation, two series of tablet sets were prepared, in which the t API and t non-API change at the same time, while the total tablet thickness was constrained at either 3.6 or 2.6 mm. The modeled response surface is shown in Fig. 8 . This configuration is practically important since the total thickness can be directly measured and also represents the same constraints that the true manufacturing operation would produce. The TRS signal of BMS-A was plotted as a function of its thickness in Fig. 8 for each of these two tablet sets. The factors in the regression equation, s , a , k , r , and K , were employed using the coefficients obtained from studies in Experiments 4 and 5 and the specific values shown in Table 2 . The data demonstrates that the Raman intensity was well described and that the regression coefficients were 0.9881 for 2.6 mm and 0.9976 for 3.5 mm tablet sets, respectively. Figure 9 also suggests that over a narrow range of thickness, the response would be approximately linear. In typical manufacturing conditions, the variation of the first layer needs to be within an approximately 5 % window relative to the desired value to ensure acceptable potency for that layer. Therefore, by constraining our analysis to such a narrow range, the response would be much simpler to model.

General Method Development for a Bilayer Model
Based on the earlier observations, it is reasonable to propose a model to predict the bilayer tablet API assay that combines the various contributions in a manner that assumes that each layer responds independently of the other as given in Eq. 4 . $$ {I}_{\mathrm{API}}={I}_0\frac{s\cdot k}{a}\cdot \frac{\left({k}^2{t}_{\mathrm{API}}-r\right) \sinh k{t}_{\mathrm{API}}+\left(r+a\right)kd \cosh k{t}_{\mathrm{API}}}{{\left[\left(a+r\right) \sinh k{t}_{\mathrm{API}}+k \cosh k{t}_{\mathrm{API}}\right]}^2}\times (Lx)\times \exp \left(-K{t}_{\mathrm{non}\hbox{-} \mathrm{A}\mathrm{P}\mathrm{I}}\right) $$ (4) where x is the API concentration and L is a scaling factor. The above model will allow the general estimation of API content from a TRS measurement. However, it indicates that to create a TRS model to predict the API content, at least the thickness of one individual layer should be fixed. Otherwise, a set of calibration models have to be developed for different thickness levels.
Considerations for Tablets with One Thin Layer
In the authors’ experience, bilayer tablets can exhibit significant differences between the thickness in each of the two layers, potentially up to an order of magnitude. This represents a specifically complex situation because the backscattered Raman response of the thin layer is very sensitive to the thickness of the layers, but also the transmission response is very weak for the thin layer. A method of Raman signal enhancement has been developed by Matousek [ ] where a unidirectional dielectric mirror is placed directly in front of the sample. This dielectric element, referred herein as the beam enhancer (BE), allows the initial laser source to impinge on the sample; however, a significant fraction of the reflected photons are redirected back into the sample resulting in a significant increase in Raman photon generation, of up to an order of magnitude [ ].
To understand the impact of the BE optic for layered samples, a layer of formulation A was stepped through a stack of formulation B disks. This work has been presented before by Matousek et al. [ ] for a standard TRS measurement. Figure 10 shows the enhancement factor: the ratio of the BE response to the non-BE data for the same sample. A maximum enhancement of ~20 was observed when the layer was on the bottom of the sample, and as it moved deeper into the sample, the enhancement was reduced to a constant enhancement of approximately 8. This simple observation highlights that even though all geometries exhibited an enhancement there is a strong bias towards the front surface, suggesting that the BE optical configuration could allow the analysis of thin layers imparted on the surface of larger tablets due to the selective enhancement of the front surface. Additional samples were prepared whereby the thickness of the bottom layer was increased and as the layers got thicker the enhancement was reduced highlighting that the increased averaging over larger spatial distances negated the benefits of the surface enhancement, making it more of a simple bulk enhancement losing the selectivity advantage. Fig. 10 Enhancement factor as a function of layer position
Conclusion
This work demonstrated the complex nature of the transmission Raman response derived through a bilayered pharmaceutical tablet and highlighted that there are significant differences when contrasting the experiment to transmission near-infrared spectroscopy. The concurrent complex growth and decay of the Raman response makes it generally non-trivial to estimate the content of the active within a matrix. The simple application of the SKM model was successfully applied to describe the Raman photon scattering as a function of the thickness of API layer. Within certain constrained regions of each layer thickness, it is possible to simplify the modeling to an approximately linear response which may be of tremendous value to scientists looking to perform quantitative analysis on bilayered pharmaceutical products.
Through the application of a beam enhancer optic, a significant increase in the Raman signal from a superficially thin layer demonstrates the oversampling of the bottom surface in the presence of the BE. This will hold a significant advantage for the analysis of coatings and thin layers samples.
Although not demonstrated in the current work, it is clear that standard multivariate chemometric modeling and spectral pretreatment approaches will yield the same advantages for the analysis of bilayered tablets using transmission Raman spectroscopy as they do in other areas of spectroscopy. Specific advantage may be seen for cases where unique bands are not available for univariate analysis, requiring multiple wavelengths to tease out the spectral contributions from the various components. However, one should demonstrate significant care when applying pathlength correction algorithms or when performing spectral normalization across responses that originate from different layers in the test sample. The ability to leverage an internal standard or directly measuring the impinging laser intensity would provide an absolute means of assessing the quantitative response. For example, providing a thin polymer substrate within the beampath that the sample sits on could facilitate effective normalization approaches to fix pathlength problems.
