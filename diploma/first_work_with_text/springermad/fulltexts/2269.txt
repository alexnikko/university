Introduction
Traumatic brain injury (TBI), with its high morbidity and disability, has aroused wide concern (Roozenbeek et al. ). The devastating consequences have brought patients severe physical, psychological, and emotional hurt, along with the whole society bearing the enormous economic burden (Russo and McGavern ; Cui et al. ). It is urgent to take some measures to improve the recovery of neural function in patients with TBI.
The recovery of neural function depends on two factors: the severity of the primary insult (primary brain injury) and the secondary brain injury factors (Mioni et al. ). Since the primary brain injury is usually irreversible, previous reports are focused on preventable secondary brain injuries. Recent studies about the inflammation and its impact on the pathophysiology of trauma have increased the interest in whether inflammation, as a possible source of secondary brain injury, influences the outcome of TBI (Raposo et al. ). As the significant marker for inflammation, cytokines often represent the degree of the inflammatory response (Becher et al. ). IL-17 is an important pro-inflammatory factor that can regulate the expressions of some cytokines, chemokines, and apoptosis-related proteins, thereby inducing inflammation and apoptosis (Wu et al. ; van den Berg and McInnes ). The IL-17 family consists of six members named IL-17A–F, with IL-17A being the prototype (Miossec and Kolls ). IL-23 is a member of the IL-12 family and is comprised of an IL-12p40 subunit and the unique IL-23p19 subunit, which can be secreted by the activated dendrite cell (DC) and macrophage (McDermott et al. ; Cua et al. ; Song et al. ). Previous studies have shown that IL-23 could expand and maintain its lineage of Th17 cells, promoting the production of IL-17, which is also called the IL-23/Th17 axis or IL-23/IL-17 axis (Isailovic et al. ; Leppkes et al. ). SAHA is a kind of small molecular weight (<300) linear hydroxamic acid. As a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, SAHA was recently found to exhibit an immunosuppressive effect, and many studies have also reported that SAHA can inhibit the expression of IL-23 mRNA in vitro and in vivo (Du et al. ; Dobreva et al. ).
Many studies have indicated that the IL-17 is involved in the pathogenesis of certain autoimmune diseases, especially in autoimmune diseases of the CNS (Nilsson et al. ; Pacifici ; Lei et al. ); however, there were few studies focused on the effects of IL-17 on traumatic brain injury up to now (Leppkes et al. ). In the present study, we propose the idea that IL-17 probably participates in the secondary brain injury of TBI, and this study to investigate its potential roles in TBI may provide valuable insight for brain injury-related disease treatment.
Materials and Methods
Animals and Drug Treatment
One hundred sixty-three adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (235–285 g) were housed in temperature- (25 ± 3 °C) and light-controlled (12 h light/dark) rooms, with water and diet ad libitum. All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Xuzhou University, and the methods were carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines (Assurance NO. 2015-46, 2015-47). For the time-course study, 35 rats were randomly assigned to seven groups: Sham, TBI 6 h, TBI 1 day, TBI 2 days, TBI 3 days, TBI 7 days, and TBI 14 days group ( n = 5). The rest of the rats were randomly assigned to the following groups for the treatment study: Sham (6 h, 1, 3, and 7 days), TBI (6 h, 1, 3, and 7 days), TBI + SAHA (6 h, 1, 3, and 7 days) and TBI + Vehicle group (6 h, 1, 3, and 7 days) ( n = 8). SAHA was dissolved in vehicle (containing 2% DMSO, 30% PEG300 and ddH 2 O; 5 mg/ml) (Xing et al. ; Nilsson et al. ). The rats in the TBI + SAHA group received SAHA injections (12.5 mg/kg, intravenously) once daily after TBI, and the rats in TBI + Vehicle group received the same dosage of vehicle without SAHA. Dosages were adjusted daily according to the changes in weight, and the dose selection was based on the instructions for SAHA.
TBI Model
TBI was induced according to the Feeney method (Joseph et al. ; Ghosh et al. ). Briefly, rats were anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate (3 ml/kg). The rats were attached to a stereotaxic apparatus, and then the hairs of the calvaria were shaved off, and iodophor was used to disinfect the scalp before the craniotomy was conducted (6 × 8 mm, centered 5 mm behind bregma and 4 mm lateral to the mid line). A 30 g weight was dropped from a height of 20 cm onto a 3.5-mm-diameter piston, allowing one single 3.0-mm compression of the brain parenchyma. The Sham group rats received the same treatment without the cortical compression. After the surgery, the animals stayed in a heated cage (30 °C) for recovery.
Modified Neurological Severity Score (mNSS)
To evaluate neural function recovery, the mNSS tests were performed at 6 h, 1, 3, and 7 days after the injury. The scale ranges from 0 to 18 (13–18, severe injury; 7–12, moderate injury; 1–6, mild injury); the higher the score, the more serious the injury. The mNSS test included four parts: motor tests, sensory tests, beam balance tests, and reflex reaction tests. The rats had abnormal behaviors or a lack of the expected reactions, which was the basis of scores being awarded (Kuwabara et al. ). If the performance in the mNSS was not obvious, the changes in mNSS (ΔmNSS) were used for the analysis.
HE Staining
The rats were anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate, then by a perfusion, with rapid infusion of the left ventricle with 0.9% saline (37 °C, 200 ml). After fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde, the brain was removed and placed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 12 h (4 °C). The brains were kept in 30% sucrose (4 °C) for at least 2 days. Then, the sections (8 μm thick) were cut through on a freezing microtome (Leica, Germany), and all of the brain sections were stored at −20 °C. The sections were stained by HE Kit (G1120, Solarbio, China), and the images obtained with a light microscope (Olympus, Japan).
Neuronal Apoptosis Detection
The brain sections were rinsed in PBS for 5 min. Using the Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit (16121220, Wanleibio), cell apoptosis was determined in the tissue sections, according to the procedures. Then, DAPI (Cell Signaling Technology, USA, and 0.1 μg/ml) was used to examine cellular DNA by fluorescence microscope (Leica, Germany). The percentage of apoptotic cells was analyzed by ImageJ software.
Elisa
At the corresponding time points, we collected the CSF and serum samples. All the blood samples were centrifuged for 15 min (3000 r/min, 4 °C); the serum samples were collected and then stored at −80 °C until enough samples had been collected to complete a batch assay. The CSF samples were stored at −80 °C immediately without centrifuging. The CSF and serum were used to detect the level of IL-17 via the ELISA method, according to the procedures provided by the manufacturer (eBioscience, BMS635). The serum was diluted with the sample dilution to 1:10 in advance. A standard curve was constructed by plotting absorbance values versus the IL-17 concentrations of the calibrators. The lowest limit of quantization of the assay was 0.1 pg/ml in CSF and serum.
Western Blot Analysis
The Western blot analysis was used to detect the protein levels of IL-17, IL-23, CD4, Bcl-2, Bax, and cleaved caspase-3 in the cerebral cortex around the injury area. Adequate sample solutions were removed to measure the total protein concentrations using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method. We used 80 μg protein/lane in 15% gradient SDS-PAGE gels. Molecular size-separated proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, blocked with 5% skim milk (BD, USA), and incubated overnight with the following primary antibodies: anti-IL-23 (Rabbit, 1:500; Wanleibio), anti-IL-17 (Rabbit, 1:500; Santa Cruz), anti-CD4 (Rabbit, 1:500; Novus Biologicals), anti-Bcl-2 (Rabbit, 1:1000; Abcam), anti-Bax (Rabbit, 1:1000; Abcam), and anti-cleaved caspase-3 (Rabbit, 1:1000; CST). Anti-β-actin (Mouse, 1:1000; GenScript) was used to normalize the quantification. Goat anti-rabbit IgG (Goat, 1:10,000, Bioworld Technology) was used as the secondary antibody for 2 h at room temperature. The membranes were rinsed three times with TBS-tween for 15 min at room temperature. Lastly, the ECL chemiluminescence system (WLA003, Wanleibio) and X-ray film (Carestream, Germany) were used to detect the protein signals. The protein bands’ gray values were detected by ImageJ software.
Immunofluorescence and Microscopy
The cryostat-sectioned brain tissue (15-μm-thickness coronal section) was washed with PBS for 15 min at room temperature. The sections were then blocked with 10% fetal bovine serum (BBI, A600332) at 25 °C for 2 h, in the presence of 0.1% Triton X-100 for all antibodies, followed by overnight incubation with primary antibodies at 4 °C. The brain tissue sections were incubated with primary antibody to rabbit anti-CD4 (Novus Biologicals, NBP1-19371) and mouse anti-IL-17 (Santa Cruz, sc-374218), both of which were used at a dilution of 1:300. After washing with PBS, the sections were incubated away from light with a biotinylated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (ZSGB-BIO, China, 1:200) and biotinylated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (ZSGB-BIO, China, 1:200) at room temperature for 2 h. After rinsing with PBS with Triton X-100, the brain tissue sections were mounted using the nuclear marker DAPI (Cell Signaling Technology, USA, 0.1 μg/ml). The photographs were captured using a fluorescence microscope with a confocal scan unit FV500 (Olympus, Japan).
Statistical Analysis
All of the data were presented as the mean ± SE. Statistical analyses were conducted using the SPSS 16.0 software package or Graphpad Prism 5.0. A repeated-measures analysis of variance (RM ANOVA) was employed for mNSS. The Elisa data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA. One-way ANOVA and Student’s t test were used to analyze the differences between groups depending on the circumstances. Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05.
Results
Neurological Severity Score of Rats After TBI
The mNSS was used to assess neurological function at 6 h, 1, 3, and 7 days after TBI (Table 1 ). The higher the score of the mNSS, the more serious the functional injury. In the Sham group, there was no significant difference between any of the time points ( P > 0.05). The mean mNSS scores of rats in the TBI groups were significantly higher than in the Sham groups at all of the time points after TBI ( P < 0.05). In the TBI groups, the mean mNSS scores of the rats decreased from 6 h to 7 days. Compared with the rats at 6 h, the mean mNSS scores of rats at other time points were lower ( P < 0.05), and the mean mNSS scores of rats at 7 days were lower than that 3 days ( P < 0.05).

Changes in Morphology After TBI
The Hematoxylin–Eosin (HE) staining was used to observe the morphological changes in the brain tissues after TBI (Fig. 1 ). In the Sham group, the structural integrity of the brain tissues and all neurons were normal. In the TBI group, however, the HE staining revealed the structural integrity of the brain tissues was damaged, the weight hit locations showed a strong compression phenomenon, and the organization structure was destroyed. Additionally, HE staining also revealed a progressive increase in inflammatory cell expression, edema, hemorrhage, and neuronal damage at sites of injury from 6 h to 7 days, with a marked increase at 3 days after TBI. Fig. 1 HE staining revealed the injury areas and SSZ of TBI rats ( A 3 , B 3 , 6 h–7 days: original magnification × 200). A 1 – A 3 The brain tissues were normal in the Sham group. B 1 A schematic diagram of the TBI model. B 2 – B 3 Light microscopy showed the disorganized brain tissues, edema, hemorrhage, and inflammatory cell infiltration around the brain injury regions. The severity of edema and interstitial inflammatory cell infiltration were markedly increased at 3 days. Scale bar: 50 μm
Neuronal Apoptosis of Brain Tissues After TBI
To investigate the changes of neuronal apoptosis after TBI, the Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit and quantitative image analysis were used. The apoptosis of neurons mainly concentrated on the SSZ (Shear stress zone, Fig. 2 a) and was hardly detected in the Sham group. The percentage of apoptosis cells in the TBI groups increased from 6 h and peaked at 7 days (Fig. 2 b, c, P < 0.05). Fig. 2 Detection of neuronal apoptosis in brain tissues after TBI by immunofluorescence staining. a Lower magnification of rat brain cortical tissue sections showed that the immunofluorescence staining was concentrated on the brain injury regions and SSZ. Scale bar: 500 μm. b The immunofluorescence staining increased from 6 h to 7 days and peaked at 7 days in the TBI group. Scale bar: 40 μm. c The percentage of apoptotic cells in brain tissues was analyzed by ImageJ software ( n = 5/group, the data are presented as the mean ± SE; # p < 0.05 vs. Sham, ∆ p < 0.05 vs. 6 h, ● p < 0.05 vs. 1 day, ℰ p < 0.05 vs. 3 days)
Increased IL-17 Concentrations in the CSF and Serum After TBI
ELISA was used to measure the concentrations of IL-17 in serum and CSF, which assessed whether the production of IL-17 was consistent with the progression of inflammation (Fig. 3 ). In the serum, the level of IL-17 in the TBI group clearly increased from 6 h, peaking at 3 days, and gradually decreasing there after ( P < 0.05). In the CSF, however, the IL-17 level increased from 6 h and peaked at 1–3 days ( P < 0.05). In both serum and CSF, statistical significance was seen from 6 h to 7 days compared with the Sham group ( P < 0.05). Fig. 3 IL-17 levels were quantified in the serum and CSF by ELISA after TBI. a In the serum, the IL-17 level increased starting at 1 day and peaked at 3 days in the TBI group after TBI ( n = 8 per time point, the data are presented as the mean ± SE; # P < 0.01 vs. Sham, ∆ P < 0.05 vs. 6 h, ● P < 0.05 vs. 1 day, and * P < 0.05 vs. 3 days). b In the CSF, the IL-17 level increased markedly starting at 6 h and peaked at 1 and 3 days ( n = 8 per time point, the data are presented as the mean ± SE; # P < 0.01 vs. Sham, ∆ P < 0.05 vs. 6 h, ● P < 0.05 vs. 1 day, and * P < 0.05 vs. 3 days)
Increased Protein Levels of IL-17 and IL-23 in Brain Tissues After TBI
To prove whether the changes in the IL-17 level in brain tissues were consistent with the trends of IL-17 in the serum and CSF, Western blot analysis was used to assess IL-17 and IL-23 (Fig. 4 a). Compared with the Sham group, the protein level of IL-17 increased from 6 h and peaked at 3 days ( P < 0.05), then gradually decreased thereafter (Fig. 4 b). The level of IL-23 increased significantly beginning at 6 h and remained at a high level until it peaked at 3 days ( P < 0.05), then decreased to a relatively low level until 14 days (Fig. 4 c, P < 0.05). Their dynamic trends, however, were similar; IL-23 increased significantly as early as 6 h after TBI, and IL-17 increased steadily. Statistical significance was reached from 6 h to 14 days after TBI compared to the Sham group ( P < 0.05). Fig. 4 Expression of IL-17 and IL-23 protein in the brain tissues after TBI. The protein levels of IL-17 and IL-23 at the different time points, as measured by Western blot analysis ( n = 5/group, the data are presented as the mean ± SE; # p < 0.05 vs. Sham, ● p < 0.05 vs. 6 h, ∆ p < 0.05 vs. 1 day, & p < 0.05 vs. 2 days, * p < 0.05 vs. 3 days and $ p < 0.05 vs. 7 days)
Main Source of IL-17 in Brain Tissues After TBI
To investigate the source of IL-17 after TBI, we labeled the IL-17 and CD4. In the Sham group, CD4 and IL-17 demonstrated nearly no expression. In the TBI group, however, the expression of CD4 and IL-17 increased significantly in the SSZ. Additionally, the confocal microscopy imaging confirmed the presence of CD4 + IL-17 + T cells (Th17 cells, yellow) in the SSZ. We also found that IL-17 did not exactly coincide with CD4, and the number of Th17 cells was obviously less than the number of CD4 + cells in the TBI group (Fig. 5 ). Fig. 5 Colocalization of CD4 and IL-17 in injured brain tissues by immunofluorescence staining after TBI. Through immunofluorescence staining for the nuclear marker DAPI (blue), IL-17 (green), and CD4 + T cells (red), confocal microscopy imaging confirmed the presence of CD4 + IL-17 + T cells (Th17 cells, yellow) in the TBI group, but not in Sham group. Scale bar: 50 μm (Color figure online)
SAHA Reduces the IL-17 Level in CSF and Serum After TBI
The concentration of IL-17 in CSF and serum was measured by ELISA (Fig. 6 ). In the CSF, compared with the Sham group, the IL-17 levels in the TBI, TBI + SAHA and TBI + Vehicle groups increased markedly from 6 h to 7 days and remained at a high level at 1–3 days (Fig. 6 a, P < 0.05). The IL-17 level of the TBI + SAHA group reduced from 3 to 7 days compared to the TBI and TBI + Vehicle groups ( P < 0.05). In the serum, compared with the Sham group, the IL-17 levels of the TBI, TBI + SAHA and TBI + Vehicle groups increased from 1 to 7 days and peaked at 3 days (Fig. 6 b, P < 0.05). The IL-17 level of the TBI + SAHA group was lower compared to the TBI and TBI + Vehicle groups, except for at 6 h ( P < 0.05). In both the CSF and serum, the IL-17 was hardly detected in the Sham group. Fig. 6 Detection of the IL-17 levels by ELISA in the serum and CSF after TBI. a In the serum, the IL-17 levels increased from 1 day and peaked at 3 days, except in the Sham group. The level in the TBI + SAHA group was lower than the TBI and TBI + Vehicle groups at 1, 3, and 7 days ( n = 8 per time point, the data are presented as the mean ± SE; ∆ P < 0.05 vs. 6 h, ● P < 0.05 vs. 1 day, * P < 0.05 vs. 3 days, & P < 0.05 vs. TBI, and ℰ P < 0.05 vs. TBI + Vehicle). b In the CSF, the IL-17 level increased starting at 6 h and peaked at 1–3 days in all groups. The TBI + SAHA group was no different from the TBI or TBI + Vehicle groups at 6 h and 1 day; however, starting from 3 days, the IL-17 level of the TBI + SAHA group was lower than that of the TBI or TBI + Vehicle groups ( n = 8 per time point, the data are presented as the mean ± SE; ∆ P < 0.05 vs. 6 h, ● P < 0.05 vs. 1 day, and * P < 0.05 vs. 3 days, & P < 0.05 vs. TBI, and ℰ P < 0.05 vs. TBI + Vehicle)
SAHA Reduces the Expressions of IL-23, CD4 and IL-17 at 3 Days After TBI
Immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis were used to detect the expressions of IL-23, CD4 and IL-17 under the SAHA treatment at 3 days after TBI (Fig. 7 ). In the TBI + SAHA group, the expressions of CD4 and IL-17 were less than in the TBI or TBI + Vehicle group. When compared to the TBI group and the TBI + Vehicle group, the expressions of IL-17 and CD4 were similar (Fig. 7 a). Compared with the TBI and TBI + Vehicle groups, the levels of IL-23, CD4, and IL-17 were decreased in the TBI + SAHA group ( P < 0.05), but still higher than in the Sham group ( P < 0.05). The levels of IL-23, CD4 and IL-17, however, were not statistically significant when compared to the TBI group and the TBI + Vehicle group (Fig. 7 b, c, P > 0.05). Fig. 7 Expressions of IL-17, Th17, and IL-23 under SAHA treatment in the brain tissues at 3 days following TBI. a Through immunofluorescence staining for the nuclear marker DAPI (blue), IL-17 (green), the CD4 + T cells (red), confocal microscopy imaging confirmed the presence of CD4 + IL-17 + T cells (Th17 cells, yellow). Scale bar: 50 μm. b The protein levels of IL-23, CD4, and IL-17 in the different groups, as measured by Western blot analysis ( n = 5/group, the data are presented as the mean ± SE; # p < 0.05 vs. Sham, ∆ p < 0.05 vs. TBI, ● p < 0.05 vs. TBI + Vehicle) (Color figure online)
Blocking the IL-23/IL-17 Axis Influences the Apoptosis-Associated Proteins and Reduces Neuronal Apoptosis at 3 Days After TBI
To detect whether blocking the IL-23/IL-17 axis could reduce the apoptosis-associated proteins and neuronal apoptosis, the Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit and Western blot analysis were performed (Fig. 8 ). The Bcl-2 gene family plays a crucial role in the regulation of neuronal apoptosis, and the Bcl-2/Bax ratio is seen as the “molecular switch” to start cell apoptosis (Pan et al. ). A higher ratio means that the anti-apoptotic effects are dominant, whereas the apoptosis-inducing effects are dominant (Yan et al. ). The protein ratio of Bcl-2/Bax in the TBI + SAHA group was higher than the TBI and TBI + Vehicle groups, and the cleaved caspase-3 of the TBI + SAHA group was lower than for those two groups (Fig. 8 a). The immunofluorescence staining of Annexin v-FITC in the three brain injury groups increased compared to the Sham group (Fig. 8 b, P < 0.05). We also found that the percentage of Annexin V-FITC positive cells in the TBI + SAHA group was lower than in the TBI and TBI + Vehicle groups ( P < 0.05). There was no difference between the TBI and TBI + Vehicle groups ( P > 0.05). Fig. 8 Blocking the IL-23/IL-17 axis reduced the apoptosis-associated proteins and neuronal apoptosis in injured brain tissues at 3 days after TBI. a Compared to the TBI and TBI + Vehicle groups, the protein ratio of Bcl-2/Bax in the TBI + SAHA group was higher, and the cleaved caspase-3 was lower than the two groups ( n = 5/group, the data are presented as the mean ± SE; # P < 0.05 vs. Sham, ∆ P < 0.05 vs. TBI, ● P < 0.05 vs. TBI + Vehicle). b Immunofluorescence staining of the TBI + SAHA group was lower than in the TBI or TBI + Vehicle group. Scale bar: 40 μm. The percentage of apoptotic cells in brain tissues was analyzed by Image software. ( n = 5/group, the data are presented as the mean ± SE; # P < 0.01 vs. Sham, ∆ P < 0.05 vs. TBI, & P < 0.05 vs. TBI + Vehicle)
Blocking the IL-23/IL-17 Axis Improves Neural Functional Recovery After TBI
To investigate whether blocking the IL-23/IL-17 axis could improve neural functional recovery after TBI (Fig. 9 ), the changes in mNSS were examined. Compared with Sham group, the scores of the TBI, TBI + SAHA, and TBI + Vehicle groups were higher at all of the time points (Fig. 9 a, P < 0.01). The TBI + SAHA group score was lower than that of the TBI and TBI + Vehicle groups at 3 and 7 days (Fig. 9 a, P < 0.05). No significant difference was found at 6 h and 1 day; thus, ΔmNSS was used in subsequent analyses to assess the variations over time (Xing et al. ). Compared with the TBI and TBI + Vehicle groups, the ΔmNSS of the TBI + SAHA group was higher at the interval of 6 h–1 day (Fig. 9 b, P < 0.05). It also indicated that SAHA could improve the neural function recovery from 6 h to 1 day. Moreover, at the interval of 6 h–3 days and 6 h–7 days, the neural functional recovery of the TBI + SAHA group was better than that of the TBI and TBI + Vehicle groups ( P < 0.05). Fig. 9 Blocking the IL-23/IL-17 axis improved neurological function in rats after TBI. a The scores of the TBI, TBI + SAHA and TBI + Vehicle groups were higher than the Sham group at all of the time points. The TBI + SAHA group was lower than the TBI and TBI + Vehicle groups at 3 and 7 days ( n = 8/group, data are analyzed by two-way ANOVA and presented as the means; * P < 0.01 vs. Sham, # P < 0.05 vs. TBI, ∆ P < 0.05 vs. TBI + Vehicle). b Considering that the performances in mNSS were not significantly different at 6 h and 1 day, the changes in mNSS (ΔmNSS) were assessed at different time intervals between 6 h and the other time points thereafter. The ΔmNSS of the TBI + SAHA group was higher than the Sham, TBI and TBI + Vehicle groups at all intervals ( n = 8/group, data are analyzed with RM ANOVA and presented as the mean ± SE; * P < 0.01 vs. Sham, # P < 0.05 vs. TBI, ∆ P < 0.05 vs. TBI + Vehicle)
Discussion
Secondary brain injury results from a series of complex events after the primary brain injury, including inflammation, edema, excitotoxicity, hypoxemia, and ischemia. Alleviating the secondary brain injury has been established as the key to improving the prognosis of brain injury. Indeed, inflammation, as the important source of secondary brain injury, has aroused more and more attention (Lin et al. ; Behairi et al. ); however, the contribution of inflammation to secondary brain injury is currently not well known. Previous studies have identified IL-17 as a predominant pro-inflammatory cytokine that can induce the expressions of other inflammatory factors, such as IL-6, IL-8, granulocyte macrophage stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), eventually leading to inflammation (Lin et al. ; Behairi et al. ). Many studies have reported that IL-17 plays an important role in many nervous system diseases, such as the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), Alzheimer’s disease and acute stroke (Kebir et al. ). In addition, human IL-17 can promote BBB disruption, and CNS inflammation in multiple sclerosis (MS) has further peaked curiosity into whether IL-17 is involved in secondary brain injury after TBI (Zhang et al. ).
In the present study, the HE staining could demonstrate the edema and interstitial inflammatory cell infiltration in the SSZ from 6 h to 7 days that markedly increased at 3 days following TBI. The neuronal apoptosis increased from 6 h and gradually rose thereafter. Eventually, the neuronal apoptosis peaked at 7 days following the peak time of edema and inflammatory cell infiltration. Many previous reports have noted that the inflammation and tissue injury were the most serious at 1–3 days after TBI, and the neuronal apoptosis is the most serious after the peak time of inflammation and edema (Steinman ). This study also confirmed that the neuronal apoptosis was consistent with the inflammation and brain tissue edema in the time trends. Other studies have shown that TNF-α and IL-1β, as the key pro-inflammatory cytokines, reached the higher levels at 1–3 days after TBI, which could promote the secondary brain injury by inducing and aggravating the inflammation (Olsson et al. ; Brough and Denes ). IL-17, as a pro-inflammatory cytokine, is similar to TNF-α and IL-1β, and the expressions of IL-17 and its upstream inflammatory signaling factor IL-23 change in secondary brain injury after TBI. The study found that the protein level of IL-17, as well as the concentration of IL-17 in serum and CSF, progressively increased starting at 6 h and peaked at 3 days following TBI. Similarly, the protein level of IL-23 increased significantly and peaked at 3 days after TBI. These patterns were consistent with the trends of edema and inflammatory cell infiltration after TBI. Thus, these findings also confirmed that IL-17 was involved in secondary brain injury after TBI in the TBI rat model, and it probably aggravated this process by promoting inflammation.
IL-17 production relates to many factors, among which are IL-23 and CD4 + T cells, as the upstream inflammatory signaling factors all play important roles (McDermott et al. ). As a new subset of CD4 + T cells, Th17 cells have been shown to be the foremost source of IL-17 reported in many studies (van den Berg and McInnes ). The study found a large number of CD4 + IL-17 + T cells (Th17 cells) infiltrating the SSZ following TBI; however, Th17 cells were hardly detected in the Sham group, which suggests that Th17 cells do not exist in normal brain tissues, and they probably come from the peripheral immune system following TBI. Since the normal blood brain barrier can reduce or even prevent the injurious factors and immune cells in the circulating blood from entering the CNS, the brain tissue microenvironment is able to maintain its stability (Clausen et al. ). The trauma, however, could destroy the integrity of BBB providing an opportunity in which the peripheral immune cells flow through the compromised BBB into the CNS under the induction of some chemokines from the CNS (Iwamoto et al. ; Huppert et al. ). In the present study, the over-expression of IL-17 in the serum also demonstrates this view. Recently, studies have also demonstrated that Th17 cells could disrupt the BBB by the action of IL-17 in MS (Olsson et al. ). Taken together, this evidence suggests that Th17 cells are the main source of IL-17 and that they are probably also involved in secondary brain injury.
In addition, the present study found that IL-17 increased starting at 1 day and peaked at 3 days in serum. In the CSF, however, the IL-17 level increased significantly starting at 6 h and reached a higher level at 1 day. Interestingly, the IL-17 level of the TBI + SAHA group did not reduce accordingly at 6 h and 1 day after TBI. The study confirmed that SAHA could reduce the serum IL-17 level at 1 day, and previous studies also reported that SAHA could get through the BBB and reach a maximum plasma concentration 4–6 h after oral administration (Alam et al. ). It also suggested that IL-17 might have other sources in the early stage of secondary brain injury. Many reports have noted that IL-17 could be produced by other cellular sources, including microglia, γδT cells, natural killer (NK) cells, mast cells, macrophages, and neutrophils (Muramatsu et al. ; Lv et al. ). Microglia have been considered as the resident brain macrophage, which is the most important immune cell in the CNS, and previous studies also found that activated microglia could produce IL-17 in the rat focal cerebral ischemia reperfusion (I/R) model (Lehnardt ). Therefore, we conjectured that IL-17 might be produced by activated microglia in the acute stage of brain injury (Zong et al. ; Kroenke and Segal ). Additionally, we found that the concentration of IL-17 in serum was much higher than in the CSF. In a word, Th17 cells were confirmed as the main source of IL-17, and microglia might be the supplementary source.
As a kind of pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-23 could increase the production of IL-17 by stimulating the proliferation of Th17 cells, as has been confirmed in the MS and spinal cord injury (SCI) models (Wines et al. ; Krizova et al. ). IL-23 cannot induce the naive CD4 + T cells to differentiate into Th17 cell subsets because the naive CD4 + T cell hardly expresses the IL-23 receptor (IL-23R) (Jafarzadeh et al. ); however, IL-23 can promote the proliferation of Th17 and IL-17 production by combining with the IL-23R of Th17 cells (Russo and McGavern ). Th17 cells were almost not detected in the IL-23 −/− EAE mice model, which suggests that IL-23 was irreplaceable in the proliferation or survival of Th17 cells (Zhong et al. ). Therefore, IL-17 is also produced through the IL-23/Th17 axis or IL-23/IL-17 axis. Other studies also reported that macrophages and DCs infiltrated into the brain injury area beginning 1 h after brain injury (Roger et al. ; Dobreva et al. ). In the present study, the protein level of IL-23 increased significantly beginning at 6 h following TBI. We speculated that IL-23 might be secreted by macrophages and DCs in the early stage of TBI, increasing the secretion of IL-17 by activating the IL-23/IL-17 axis; however, we did not verify it further after TBI. Therefore, we hypothesized IL-17 might be involved in secondary brain injury via the IL-23/IL-17 axis.
In the present study, the expressions of IL-17, IL-23, and Th17 cells in the TBI + SAHA group were lower than in the TBI and TBI + Vehicle groups, which proved that SAHA could block the IL-23/IL-17 axis. Previous studies have also reported that SAHA could reduce IL-23 levels by inhibiting the expression of IL-23 mRNA in DCs and macrophages (Pan et al. ; Roger et al. ; Song et al. ), which was consistent with our findings. It has been reported, however, that SAHA increased IL-23A expression in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Baird et al. ). We considered that macrophages may be the major source of IL-23 in NSCLC, while DCs probably dominated the production of IL-23 in the TBI model. The sources of IL-23 may be different in the different models, which needs further study. Next, we further found that blocking the IL-23/IL-17 axis could influence the protein expressions of Bcl-2, Bax, and cleaved caspase-3. The apoptosis of the mitochondria-dependent pathway is regulated by the Bcl-2 family of proteins, such as Bcl-2, which prevents apoptosis, and Bax, which promotes apoptosis (Muramatsu et al. ). Previous studies have shown that enhancing Bcl-2 or reducing Bax expression could provide protection in neonatal hypoxic-ischemic injury (Huang et al. ). As the protein downstream of mitochondrial and death receptors in the apoptotic signaling pathway, caspase-3 has been proved as a key mediator of apoptosis in many brain injury models (Li et al. ). The present study found that blocking the IL-23/IL-17 axis could increase the protein ratio of Bcl-2/Bax and reduce the protein level of cleaved caspase-3, which suggests that IL-17 mediated cell apoptosis, likely through the mitochondrial Bcl-2/Bax/caspase-3 signaling pathway. It also proved our speculation that IL-17 probably promotes secondary brain injury through the IL-23/IL-17 axis was rational. Many studies of SCI models have found the IL-17, and its related cytokines could promote the development of spinal cord neuroinflammation (Chen et al. ; Jiang et al. ). In the EAE models, the IL-17/IL-23 axis has been found to play an important role in the pathophysiology, as blocking the axis reduced the autoimmune inflammation (Chen et al. ; Bode et al. ). This also suggests that IL-17 could have a role in the inflammatory response of the CNS. Therefore, we believe that IL-17 probably promotes secondary brain injury through the IL-23/IL-17 axis, and the IL-23 inhibitor can block the IL-23/IL-17 axis to reduce the damage to some extent.
Conclusions
This study observed that IL-17 is an important pro-inflammatory cytokine that can be produced through the IL-23/IL-17 axis and promotes secondary brain injury, which might be an important molecular mechanism of secondary brain injury after TBI. An IL-23 inhibitor could block the IL-23/IL-17 axis, thereby reduced neuronal apoptosis and improving the neural function recovery. Thus, the IL-23/IL-17 axis may be a potential therapeutic target for TBI.
