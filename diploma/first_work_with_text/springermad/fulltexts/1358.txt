Introduction
The genus Terranova was established in 1914 by the British explorers Leiper and Atkinson. They named a female nematode specimen collected from the stomach of a gummy shark, Mustelus antarcticus , from off New Zealand waters (Bay of Islands), after “Terra Nova”, the ship they were sailing on (Leiper and Atkinson ), as Terranova antarctica . Features of this nematode were large simple labia, presence of an intestinal caecum (slightly longer than the cylindrical ventriculus (Gibson, unpublished observation (Sprent )) and absence of inter-labia. Subsequently, more species with similar characteristics have been described, mainly from elasmobranchs, but also from aquatic reptiles (Baylis ; Baylis and Daubney ; Diaz-Ungria ; Fang and Luo ; Linton ; Sprent ; Thwaite ).
According to the World Register of Marine Species, the eight current valid species of the genus are T. amoyensis Fang & Luo, 2006, T. antarctica Leiper & Atkinson, 1914, T. brevicapitata (Linton, 1901) Skrjabin, Schikhobalova & Mozgovoi, 1951, T. edcaballeroi Díaz-Ungría, 1970, T. galeocerdonis (Thwaite, 1927) Mozgovoi, 1953, T. ginglymostomae Olsen, , T. pristis (Baylis & Daubney, 1922) Johnston & Mawson, 1945, and T. scoliodontis (Baylis, 1931) Johnston & Mawson, 1945. However, T. ginglymostomae was considered to be a junior synonym of T. galeocerdonis by (Tanzola and Sardella ) based on morphological features, and, due to the absence of a male specimen, the full description of T. antarctica remains unknown. Table 1 provides geographical localities reported for the Terranova spp. The distinction of these species is mainly based on the morphological characters, and there are very limited sequence data for specific identification of these taxa as adult in GenBank.

Of the species listed above, four have been previously reported from Australian waters (Bruce et al. ; Bruce and Cannon ): T. galeocerdonis (including as T. ginglymostomae ), T. pristis and T. scoliodontis . There are also several reports of Terranova larval types (I and II) in various fish species in Australian waters (Jabbar et al. ; Shamsi et al. ; Shamsi and Suthar ) with no current specific identification since larval anisakids cannot be identified to species level due to the lack of taxonomically important features and comparable sequence data from a well-identified adult. In this study, a new species of Terranova , collected from hammerhead shark in Australian waters, is described and genetically characterized.
Materials and methods
Hosts
Thirteen sharks were collected from localities off the New South Wales (NSW) coast of eastern Australia. Sharks were collected as part of various other projects and made available for parasite examination. Sphyrna mokarran collected from northern New South Wales were caught in five bather-protection gill-nets deployed off Ballina and Evans Head during the austral summer of 2016/2017 (Dec 2016–Jan 2017). Dead sharks were removed from the gill-nets and frozen whole. Sharks were defrosted and the stomach and spiral valve were removed, placed in bags and refrozen.
Parasites
The digestive system was separated at the junction of the stomach and the spiral valve. The stomach was opened longitudinally on a tray and examined for dietary components and parasites. In stomachs with a large quantity of food or liquid, the stomach and its contents were placed into a jar and washed. The spiral valve was opened longitudinally, washed and examined for parasites. The washings for each section were searched using a dissecting microscope.
All nematodes were collected, washed in physiological saline and then preserved in 70% ethanol. For a selection of nematodes collected, a small piece of the mid-body of each nematode was excised for molecular study, and the rest of the nematode was cleared in lactophenol for morphological examination.
Morphological examination
Anterior and posterior parts of each nematode were examined under light microscope. Illustrations were made using a microscope equipped with camera lucida. All measurements are given in millimetres, unless stated otherwise. Mean measurements are given, followed by the range in parentheses. Specimens have been deposited in the South Australian Museum, Adelaide (SAM) under AHC48627 to AHC48637, including Holotype (AHC48627) and Allotype (AHC48628).
Two representatives, one male and one female, were subjected to scanning electron microscopy (SEM). They were washed and dehydrated overnight in a series of graded ethanol solutions (70, 80, 90, 95 and 100%). After three additional overnight washes in absolute ethanol, the specimens were critical point dried using a tousimis Autosamdri-931 (USA). Samples were then mounted on a 12 mm carbon tab (ProSci Tech, Austalia) and sputter coated with gold using a K550X Sputter Coater (Quorum Technologies, UK). The specimens were examined under a JEOL (Peabody, Massachusetts, USA) NeoScope SEM with accelerating voltage set at 10 kv.
Genetic characterization
Twenty samples were selected for the sequencing of the ITS region. Genomic DNA (gDNA) was isolated from all individual larvae using Qiagen kit and eluted into 45 μl of water. The ITS region (including ITS1, 5.8 and ITS2) was amplified using the primer sets SS1: 5’-GTTTCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCG-3′ (forward) and NC2: 5’-TTAGTTTCTTTTCCTCCGCT-3′ (reverse), and cycling conditions in accordance with (Shamsi and Suthar ). An aliquot (4 μl) of each amplicon was examined on a 1.5% w / v agarose gel, stained with GelRed™ and photographed using a gel documentation system. PCR amplicons were sent to Australian Genome Research Facility (Queensland) for sequencing. The sequencing data resulted from this study were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers MK542878 to MK542897.
Apart from the 20 samples sequenced in this study, additional sequences were selected from GenBank and included in the phylogenetic analysis (Table 2 ). A majority of GenBank Sequences of closely related species have ITS1 and ITS2 separated. We have concatenated the ITS1 and ITS2 sequences that are generated from the same samples from previous studies (Shamsi et al. , , ; Shamsi and Suthar , ). Sequences from this study and the concatenated sequence were aligned using ClustalW (Thompson et al. ) in BioEdit (Hall ), followed by manual adjustment. The phylogenetic relationships among species were inferred using Bayesian and maximum likelihood method using the software MrBayes v 3.2 (Ronquist and Huelsenbeck ) and MEGA-X (Kumar et al. ), respectively. Indels were excluded for analysis. Pseudoterranova decipiens was used as outgroup. The HKY model was applied as suggested by Jmodeltest2 (Darriba et al. ). For the Bayesian analysis, sample frequency was set at 1000, and the number of generation was set at 4,000,000. All other parameters were set as default. After the mcmc run, the first 25% samples were discarded, and the sumt command was used to summarize the phylogenetic tree. For the maximum likelihood analysis, tree topology and branch lengths were tested by 10,000 bootstrap replications. Figtree v 1.4.3 was used to visualize the phylogenetic trees (Rambaut ).

Results
A total of 13 sharks were examined for nematodes of which nine (69.2%) were infected with specimens of T. pectinolabiata n. sp. (Table 3 ). Microscopy revealed that most specimens were immature or a larval stage of the parasite (Table 4 ). Additionally, most adult specimens were not in good morphological condition; therefore, the morphological description below is based on three females and five males which were suitable for light microscopy, of which one male and one female were subjected to scanning electron microscopy.

Etymology: pectinolabiata refers to the comb-like structure on the cranial surface of the labia.
Remarks: The closest related species to T . pectinolabiata is T . galeocerdonis . The latter has been redescribed by Tanzola and Sardella ( ) based on materials from Carcharias taurus off Bahia Blanca and Punta Tejada, in Argentina. Our specimens are clearly distinct based on morphology of caudal plates. There is relatively more gap between plates in T. galeocerdonis , and they look orderly whereas plates in T. pectinolabiata are situated closer to each other and due to the variance in their size they look to be arranged out of orders. In addition, there is a significantly smaller plate in both species that is located centrally as the third plate in the former but as the last plate in the latter. The position of the comb-like structure on the labia is also different between T . galeocerdonis and T. pectinolabiata , being situated at the most cranial part of the labia from apical view and being more projected in the former (Fig. 6 in Tanzola and Sardella ( )) but lower in the new species (see Fig. 2b ). Labia are more triangular in the new species than it is in T. galeocerdonis .
Genetic characterization: Twenty specimens were selected from males, females, larval and immature specimens and were subjected to sequence analyses of the ITS region. ITS sequences were identical among all specimens. The alignment among species was 935 bp in length. Small genetic differences were found between the samples collected in this study and the sequences of Terranova sp. type II from GenBank, with a maximum pairwise genetic distance at 0.468% between T. pectinolabiata n. sp. and Terranova sp. type II. By contrast, Terranova sp. type I appeared to be a distinct group with a minimum among species pairwise genetic distance at 6.58%. The Bayesian inference phylogenetic tree also clustered 20 T. pectinolabiata n. sp. samples with Terranova sp. type II with all the Terranova sp. type I as a separate clade (Fig. 4 ) with 100% posterior probability. Similar relationships were also found using maximum likelihood method (Fig. S1 ).

Discussion
This is the first record of a species of Terranova infecting the great hammerhead, S. mokarran .
The following identification key can be used to morphologically distinguish between the new species in the present study and previous valid species: 1) No cuticular plate (Deardorff ) ……………………................................................. T. brevicapitata Cuticular plates present…………………………....... 2 2) Labia prominently bilobed, with wide row of fine teeth; cervical alae fine, inconspicuous; male plectanes laterally truncate (Bruce and Cannon ), four simple ventricular plates (Deardorff ) .……. T. scoliodontis Morphology of labia and caudal plates different……………………………………………….... 3 3) Gubernaculum absent ……………………………... 4 Gubernaculum present (Bruce and Cannon )………………………........................................... 5 4) Mid-ventral plectanes bear 5 pairs of sharp marginal spines, median of which is smallest (Tanzola and Sardella ); comb-like structures on the labia at the tip of the labia…..…………………..................... T. galeocerdonis Mid-ventral plectanes with sharp marginal spines but irregular in size and arrangement, the most posterior plate being the smallest; comb-like structures on the side of the labia ............................................. T. pectinolabiata n. sp. 5) Ventriculus long, pre-cloacal papillae 54 pairs, spicules 2% of body length…………………………………………………………….................................... T. pristis Ventriculus spherical, pre-cloacal papillae 12–13 pairs, spicules 4.3 & 3.9% of body length……………………………………………………………… T. amoyensis
Although the number of specimens that were morphologically examined in the present study were limited, a number of morphological variations have been observed. The start and the endpoints of alae were variable among our specimens. While in some specimens, the alae started symmetrically (Fig. 3b ), in others the start point was asymmetrical, with one side more towards the anterior than the other (Fig. 3a ). Similarly, the distance of deirids from the anterior end was variable, and they were also located symmetrically in some specimens and asymmetrically in others. Another variable feature was morphology of pre-cloacal papillae in males: narrower with a longer stem in immature specimens (Fig. 3k ), originating deeper in the cuticle, compared to shorter and thicker in mature/thicker specimens (Figs. 3l, m ), originating more superficially in the cuticle. Indeed, pre-cloacal papillae in the specimens with the widest body width looked like a leaf (Fig. 3n ) located on the ventral surface. We also noted that oesophageal and ventriculus lengths, and relative length to body size, were shorter in males than in females. This was also recorded for other species but not pointed out by authors, for example in T. pristis (Bruce and Cannon ), T. amoyenmsis (Fang and Luo ) and T. galeocerdonis (Bruce and Cannon ). Assuming larger oesophagus and ventriculus are more efficient in absorption of nutrients from host, the larger size observed in these studies could be due to the females’ role in egg production and their need for higher nutrients, and therefore this is possibly a true intraspecific morphological difference between male and female Terranova spp. Given that alae start location and length, deirid location and morphology of the intestinal system and preanal papillae are important taxonomic features, it is fortunate that the sequence data obtained for specimens in the present study established that the abovementioned observations are just morphological variation among individuals of the same taxon. However, this also highlights the need for future studies to include sequence data to ensure species identifications.
Previously, a range of Terranova larval type II were found in several fish species caught from Victoria to the Northern Territory, in Australia, as well as in New Caledonian waters (Jabbar et al. ; Shamsi et al. , , ; Shamsi and Suthar ). As evident in the phylogenetic tree and based on the identical ITS-1 and ITS-2 sequence data with the new species found in the present study, it is now known that those Terranova larval types reported previously in Australian waters are larval stage of the Terranova pectinolabiata n. sp. found in the present study.
