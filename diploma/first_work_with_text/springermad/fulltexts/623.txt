Introduction
Hypertension is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Resistant hypertension (RH), a clinical condition in which healthy lifestyle changes and the use of at least three drugs, including a diuretic, in optimized dosages fail to control arterial pressure (AP), has an even poorer prognosis [ ]. Higher AP is the result of dysfunction in complex mechanisms related not only to the maintenance of high AP [ ], but also moment-to-moment variations in AP [ ]. In RH, practically all these mechanisms are damaged, which makes it difficult to establish which mechanism plays a principal role in the maintenance of high AP [ ].
Given its pivotal role in maintaining AP, some evidence has shown that baroreflex control plays an important role in cardiovascular adjustments. Whereas the role of arterial baroreceptors involves controlling AP beat-by-beat, detecting arterial distension in response to rises in systolic AP, triggering reflexively afferent nerve impulses to the central nervous system and then returning increasing vagal efferent modulations to the sinoatrial node, which decreases the efferent sympathetic discharges to the heart, the peripheral vasculature, and the kidneys [ ]. In addition, several studies have demonstrated the clinical relevance of baroreflex function since it is associated with the increasing risk of cardiac death in some cardiovascular disorders [ ]. However, several studies have reinforced that the dysfunction in this reflex is directly related to the pathophysiology of hypertension [ , ].
Up to the present moment, only one study has shown that marked adrenergic overdrive and impaired baroreflex of muscle sympathetic nerve activity occur in RH [ ]. In some studies, the patients with AP that is uncontrolled by medicines presented reductions of systolic arterial pressure (SAP) up to 30 mmHg with the use of a device capable of activating the baroreflex [ ]. That implies that arterial baroreflex dysfunction may be one of the most relevant contributors to sustaining sympathetic activity and to the elevation of AP. However, this study evaluated baroreflex function in open-loop conditions through the use of vasoactive drugs without considering the response of adrenergic synapses on the vascular bed or the low-pass filter properties of vessels. Thus, the role of the vasomotor sympathetic system in the modulation of the effector organ in RH patients remains unknown.
Therefore, the primary aim of the present study was to measure the gain and latency of arterial baroreflex control of heart rate in RH patients. Another aim was to characterize vasomotor sympathetic modulation in RH patients by spectral analysis. Given that the possible loss of these mechanisms is responsible for sustained elevation in AP, patients with essential hypertension and normotensive subjects were also evaluated. To our knowledge, this has never been studied before.
Methods
Study population
After providing written informed consent, 52 volunteers (22 males and 30 females) were included in this study. Eighteen patients [52 (50–64) years old] had RH, which was previously diagnosed in the ambulatory unit of the HIPERDIA Center, and were treated with daily administration of three or more antihypertensive drugs (mean of four medications), while 17 patients [54 (51–66) years] had essential hypertension that was treated by the administration of up to three antihypertensive drugs (mean of two medications). In the patients who were treated daily with three antihypertensive drugs, ambulatory AP monitoring was obtained over 24 h to confirm the diagnosis of RH, which was when the global average of AP over 24 h was >130/85 mmHg [ ]. Additionally, 17 subjects [56 (37–60) years old] were evaluated as untreated normotensive subjects. Subjects were eligible for participation in the study if they were sedentary, were nonsmokers, had no history of excessive alcohol consumption, and had no evidence and/or history of major comorbid conditions, including neuropathy, vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, congestive heart failure, any clinical evidence of major cardiac arrhythmias determined by electrocardiogram (ECG), and inadequate adherence to antihypertensive drug treatment. The study was approved by the Scientific Committee of the University Hospital of UFJF (no 766.317).
Arterial pressure and heart and respiratory rates
Initially, the clinic AP was measured at rest by auscultation. Afterwards, beat-to-beat AP was continuously and noninvasively measured by a finger photoplethysmography device (FinometerPRO ® ). Heart rate was monitored continuously by lead II of an ECG, and respiratory rate was monitored with a piezoelectric thoracic belt placed around the upper abdomen (Biopac ® ) [ ]. These signals were collected and processed by a data acquisition system and A/D converter with a resolution of 16 bits and sampling frequency of 1 kHz; data analysis was performed offline. A detailed description of these measurements and experimental protocol is available in the online Data Supplement.
Cardiac and peripheral autonomic control
After correction of delay among signals and visual inspection of the ECG, AP, and respiration signals, time series of heart rate (considering the RR interval [RRi]), SAP, and respiration, respectively, were generated automatically. Spontaneous fluctuations of the RRi, SAP, and respiration time series were evaluated in the frequency domain [ , ]. A detailed description of the spectral analysis method is available in the online Data Supplement.
Arterial baroreflex function
The arterial baroreflex function on heart rate was determined in the frequency domain by the transfer function analysis using the bivariate autoregressive identification procedure. This procedure permits the quantification of gain, coherence ( K 2 ) and phase shift ( φ ) between the time series of RRi (output signal) and SAP (input signal). The transfer function magnitude (gain) quantifies the intensity of response of the output signal (RRi) per unit of spontaneous change of the input signal (SAP) and is expressed in ms/mmHg. Their values represent the estimated spontaneous gain of arterial baroreflex control on the heart rate. The coherence function measures the degree of linear correlation between the oscillations at the same frequency in both variability signals and was accepted when K 2 > 0.5. The phase shift measures the time lag between the signals and was considered when negative ( φ < 0 radians, SAP changes precede RRi changes). All of these indexes can be calculated for the LF or HF ranges. We calculated the indexes of baroreflex function corresponding to the maximum coherence for both oscillatory components, which were based on the interval between the specific central frequencies of the spectral densities of RRi and SAP variabilities of each participant. Considering that phase shift is the product between latency ( t d ) and angular velocity ( ω ), the latency of arterial baroreflex of RRi in the LF range was quantified according to the following equation: td LF = φ LF / ω LF , in which ω LF is equal to the product between the central frequency of the LF band and 2 π . Latency was expressed in seconds [ , ].
Experimental protocol
The study was performed at approximately the same time of day (2–6 pm) with the subjects in a supine position and spontaneously breathing in a quiet room. All participants rested for 10 min. Baseline recordings of AP, heart rate, and respiratory rate were taken for 15 min.
Statistical analysis
The data are presented as the median (25th and 75th percentiles). The normality of distribution of each variable studied was tested. Probability values of P ≤ 0.05 were considered statistically significant. A detailed description of the statistical analysis is available in the online Data Supplement.
Results
As shown in Table 1 , age, heart rate, and respiratory rate were similar among the three groups. Regarding sex proportions, the groups were different. The RH patients showed a significantly higher proportion of women than the nonresistant hypertensive and normotensive groups. All women were free from hormonal replacement therapy. Body mass index was similar in RH patients and nonresistant hypertensive patients, but significantly lower in the normotensive subjects. Clinic SAP values were progressively higher in the normotensive subjects compared to the nonresistant hypertensive and RH patients. Clinic DAP was significantly increased only in RH patients vs. normotensive controls. Compared to the nonresistant hypertensive patients, RH patients exhibited higher numbers of antihypertensive drugs.

The heart rate variability (Variance RRi ) was lower in RH patients compared to nonresistant hypertensive patients and normotensive subjects. However, LF RRi (ms 2 ) was lower in the two groups of hypertensive patients than the normotensive subjects. The other indexes (VLF RRi e HF RRi -ms 2 ; LF RRi e HF RRi -nu; and LF/HF) were similar among the three groups (Table 2 ). Figure 1 shows examples of arterial pressure, electrocardiogram and cross-spectral analysis between RRi and SAP variability in a patient with RH, a patient with H, and an N subject.

The Variance SAP and VLF SAP were similar among groups. However, LF SAP was significantly increased only in the RH patients, while HF SAP was higher in RH and nonresistant hypertensive patients compared to the normotensive subjects (Table 2 ).
Arterial baroreflex function on heart rate, reflected by LF SAP–RRi , showed that the central frequency was similar between groups (Table 3 ). The gain was similarly lower in the RH and nonresistant hypertensive patients in relation to the normotensive subjects (Fig. 2 ). However, the latency of arterial baroreflex function on heart rate was significantly higher only in RH patients (Fig. 3 ). Coherence was similar in all groups (Fig. 3 ); however, the phase shift was significantly lower in the RH patients compared to normotensive subjects (Table 3 ). Figure S2 shows averaged curves of the phase shifts vs. frequency, coherence vs. frequency for all three groups. In indexes of HF SAP–RRi , only gain was significantly different between groups; it was lower in the RH patients compared with the normotensive subjects (Fig. 2 ). The other indexes were similar among the three groups (Table 3 ). As expected, respiration had a higher spectral component HF in all groups (Table 2 ). In addition, the transfer function R esp –RRi, central frequency and coherence were similar in all groups for both LF Resp–RRi and HF Resp–RRi (Table 3 ).

RH patients exhibited 43% lower arterial baroreflex gain and 54% higher latency than normotensive subjects. Furthermore, the RH group exhibited a clinical increase of 36% in LF SAP (Table 4 ).

Discussion
The major new findings of this study are that resistant hypertensive patients have the following features: (1) impaired gain of spontaneous arterial baroreflex function on heart rate; (2) higher arterial baroreflex latency; and (3) increased efferent sympathetic vasomotor modulation. These autonomic abnormalities may contribute to the sustained elevation of AP that is characteristic of resistant hypertensive patients.
We found that RH patients have lower spontaneous arterial baroreflex gains of heart rate. This baroreflex gain reduction might contribute to the inefficient control of AP in the short term, since the baroreceptors are activated by small variations in AP that occur during daily life [ ]. Thus, such impairment in detecting the arterial distension in response to changes in AP has clinical relevance due to its potential association with higher cardiovascular risk [ ]. In hypertension, deaths and major cardiovascular events are associated with a spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity reduction. Using a sequence method, baroreflex sensitivity below 4.5 ms/mmHg for AP increment was associated with 2.5 higher risk of major adverse cardiovascular event [ ]. In addition, the depressed baroreflex gain (≤3.1 ms/mmHg) of patients with mild-to-moderate clinically stable heart failure, assessed by transfer function, was associated with a higher risk of cardiac death [ ]. In our study, RH exhibited a mean baroreflex gain of 4.7 ms/mmHg, which suggests an important risk in this population.
We also observed a higher latency of arterial baroreflex response in RH patients. Other researchers have shown that not only the gain, but also the latency of the baroreflex function can determine the efficiency of this reflex [ ]. In our results, latency is preserved in nonresistant patients, but is significantly impaired in RH patients. Thus, it seems that baroreflex latency is impaired in more seriously hypertensive patients, reflecting the higher degree of dysfunction. In this context, we emphasize that the phenotype of RH is characterized by the presence of multiple cardiometabolic conditions that could be observed in our sample [ ].
Since the arterial baroreflex is an important determinant of neural regulation of the cardiovascular system, the dysfunction in such reflex results in baroreflex-mediated sympathoexcitation [ , , , ]. In fact, one study has reported that in RH, marked adrenergic overdrive and impaired baroreflex of muscle sympathetic nerve activity occur [ ]. Although these investigators have directly measured the peripheral sympathetic nerve activity, this technique cannot establish the magnitude of influence that autonomic modulation has on either the vascular or cardiac system. On the other hand, we showed that LF SAP was significantly increased only in RH patients. In addition, we found a reduction in the variance of RRi, which signals for higher sympathetic cardiac modulation. These indexes were calculated by spontaneous and non-invasive methods. Unfortunately, our study did not observe increased LF RRi , reduced HF RRi , or LF/HF RRi in RH patients. This may have occurred because of the effect of drugs such as beta blockers in 67% of the RH group. Since cardiac sympathetic modulation was partially blocked in RH patients, we observed an almost-significant difference in these variables (LF RRi and HF RRi , P = 0.07 e LF/HF RRi , P = 0.06).
The efficiency of the autonomic response is influenced by the cardiovascular oscillatory pattern. K 2 measures the degree of linear correlation between the oscillations in both signals, and its reduction could reflect a sustained elevation of sympathetic modulation [ , ]. In fact, we observed a tendency of reduced coupling between SAP and RRi in RH patients ( K SAP–RRi 2 , P = 0.07). In addition, there is unequivocal evidence that baroreflex-mediated sympathoexcitation is responsible for elevated AP [ ]. In the present study, the clinic SAP values were progressively and significantly higher in the normotensive controls compared to the nonresistant hypertensive and RH patients, despite the greater use of antihypertensive drugs by the RH group. Our results suggest that the medication used in RH patients can maintain a similar heart rate between groups; however, the pattern of oscillation beat-to-beat is impaired, and therefore, it results in a sustained increased of SAP.
Resistance to treatment is one of the reasons for uncontrolled AP, and understanding the mechanisms responsible for treatment resistance is fundamental for more effective therapeutic strategies. Studies have shown that the phenotype of RH could be a result of older age, obesity, aldosterone excess and obstructive sleep apnea [ , ]. All these mechanisms are associated with increased sympathetic modulation. These factors are considered isolated and may not have influenced the results, but when the combined group effects were investigated, these factors were proven to be responsible for our findings.
Obesity is associated with more severe hypertension [ , ]. The mechanisms involved in obesity-induced hypertension include impaired sodium excretion, fluid retention and activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system. This proposed noradrenergic mechanism may act mainly by binding to leptin receptors in the hypothalamus [ ] and to angiotensin II receptors in the bulbar region [ ]. Thus, the evidence supports a bidirectional relationship between the renin–angiotensin system and sympathetic modulation. Moreover, obstructive sleep apnea affects up to 83% of RH patients [ ]. Although apnea is more prevalent and more severe in men than in women, this factor may also contribute to the higher AP observed in our study population. Individuals with obstructive sleep apnea have higher sympathetic traffic to peripheral blood vessels [ ] and have faster heart rates during resting wakefulness [ ]. Thus, elevated sympathetic modulation in patients with obstructive sleep apnea might be explained partially by the tonic activation of chemoreflex [ ]. Additionally, even with the exclusion of primary aldosteronism in our study, aldosterone might contribute extensively to the development and severity of hypertension. Aldosterone promotes RH by mediating maladaptive changes in the renal, cardiovascular and central nervous systems. Therapy with an aldosterone receptor blocker acts in central mechanisms and promotes a significant reduction in sympathetic activity, which is achieved without changes in the target organ adrenergic response [ , ]. Because of this, studies have suggested adding aldosterone receptor blockers to the antihypertensive drug regimen prescribed to RH patients. In our study, 33% of patients with RH have taken this drug in the past. Therefore, the efferent sympathetic outflow in RH is influenced by peripheral reflex activity via chemoreceptors and baroreceptors as well as by central sympathetic activity.
Because of the failure of antihypertensive drugs to lower AP to <140/90, patients with RH have been treated with renal denervation [ ] or baroreflex activation therapy [ ]. Baroreflex activation therapy is a technique characterized by the use of a device capable of suppressing sympathetic activity by electrical activation of the carotid baroreflex. In some studies, patients with AP uncontrolled by medicines presented SAP reductions up to 30 mmHg with this device, proving that arterial baroreflex dysfunction can be a major contributor to sustained sympathetic activity and to the elevation of AP [ ]. The arterial baroreceptors in RH patients may not be capable of controlling AP through the detection of arterial distension due to the reduction of central complacency and the chronic central adaptations that may have changed the set point of the reflex. Once in open-loop conditions, RH patients display adrenergic overdrive, which reinforces the former hypothesis. However, baroreflex activation therapy is invasive and presents some risks and complications. In addition, since it involves a sustained electrical activation, aspects related to the threshold of activation and receptor accommodation should be considered and should be better investigated.
In our results, the observed changes in arterial baroreflex function may identify new markers of cardiovascular risk in RH. Since medication fails to control AP and the devices that correct the baroreflex promote the reduction of AP but are too invasive, new approaches such as physical training should be investigated. It is known that regular exercise results in better baroreflex function in hypertension [ ].
Limitations
Although the influence of sex on baroreflex has not been completely elucidated [ ], there is evidence that women who do not use hormonal replacement therapy exhibit lower cardiovagal baroreflex during phase IV of the Valsalva maneuver [ ]. In this context, it could be questioned whether our findings are related to RH by itself or to the sex differences observed among the groups. Thus, a generalized linear model was adjusted in order to estimate the effect of RH regardless of sex. This analysis showed that RH patients exhibited a 43% lower baroreflex gain and a 54% higher latency compared with normotensive controls. In other words, the baroreflex sensitivity in RH patients is lower and the heart rate response is delayed compared to normotensive subjects. These findings expand our knowledge and indicates that RH has a major clinical impact on arterial baroreflex control of heart rate.
A limitation of our study is that our hypertensive patients had to continue taking their medications during the experimental period. However, it should be taken into account that the medications taken by the resistant hypertensive patients mainly consisted of renin–angiotensin blockers and beta-blockers, which have a sympathomodulatory effect [ , ]. Even with the use of these medications, the resistant hypertensive patients presented poorer autonomic modulation and lower baroreflex function compared to normotensive subjects.
We have shown only spontaneous autonomic data, and our data may not be translatable to conditions where the cardiovascular system is under mental or physical stress. Sometimes, autonomic dysfunction is not evident at rest, and physiological maneuvers or autonomic disturbances are required to produce observable autonomic dysfunction (e.g., mental stress, physical exercise, and Valsalva maneuver). However, our results demonstrate autonomic dysfunction in patients with resistant hypertension, even under resting conditions [ ]. In our study, we performed spectral analysis of the indirect spontaneous measurements of AP, and our indexes suggest vasomotor sympathetic modulation. However, future studies should directly measure the sympathetic vascular activity. Recently, Prodel et al. [ ] have verified that hypertensive patients have exacerbated sympathetic activity in response to face cooling. Therefore, such an evaluation may be performed in the future in resistant hypertensive patients.
Conclusion
Resistant hypertensive patients have reduced gain and increased latency of the arterial baroreflex function on heart rate. In addition, these patients have increased vasomotor sympathetic modulation even during treatment with several medications. These findings are clinically relevant for patients with resistant hypertension because they were evaluated using spontaneous and non-invasive methods.
