Introduction
Peritoneal carcinomatosis is a typical feature of cancer spread in patients with primary or recurrent epithelial ovarian cancers. Combined treatment involving cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is a promising locoregional treatment which has garnered a lot of interest recently with studies showing survival benefit for advanced epithelial ovarian cancer [ ].
CRS comprises of peritonectomy procedures and multivisceral resections in order to achieve optimal cytoreduction. The landmark study by Griffiths [ ] demonstrated a survival benefit by maximal tumor debulking. Optimal cytoreduction was defined as residual disease (RD) of < 1–2 cm in the largest diameter. Hoskins et al. [ ] demonstrated a stepwise inverse correlation between residual disease diameter obtained after primary CRS and survival outcome. The current consensus is to remove all macroscopic disease leaving no residual disease [ ]. There is, however, no consensus on the extent of radical surgical resection to be done in order to achieve complete cytoreduction.
One of the unanswered questions regarding the radical CRS is the extent of peritonectomy that needs to be performed. At present, patients diagnosed with advanced epithelial carcinoma ovary undergo either selective parietal peritonectomy (SPP) or complete parietal peritonectomy (CPP) with CRS–HIPEC based on surgeons’ preference. In contrast to the current evidence which shows maximal surgical effort corresponds to survival benefit, most gynecologic oncologists are skeptical regarding the benefits of radical surgery [ , , ]. They claim that ultra-radical surgical maneuvers like CPP could never offset the biological aggressiveness of the tumor. Most of these surgeons resect only the grossly visible disease and tend to miss areas of disease not visible to human eye, especially following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) or in recurrent disease. Thus, there may be a benefit in performing CPP which is a potential site of disease recurrence.
The concept of CPP has been studied in mesothelioma which showed survival benefit [ ]. At present, there is no consensus regarding the type of peritonectomy in treating epithelial ovarian cancer. The aim of this prospective study was to assess the impact of the extent of parietal peritonectomy on operative and survival outcomes, i.e., progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).
Methods
Patients who presented with stage IIIc/IVa epithelial ovarian cancers, either primary or recurrent, were included in the study. Patients with high disease burden and massive ascites were referred for NACT. Pertinent baseline demographics and perioperative details like peritoneal cancer index (PCI), the average blood loss, operative time, hospital stay and ICU stay were recorded prospectively in all patients [ ]. The postoperative complications were assessed by physical examination results and laboratory assessments, and adverse events were recorded.
All patients where optimal cytoreduction, defined as CC 0/1 scores, was achieved underwent CRS followed by HIPEC. Systematic visual evaluation of tumor spread was performed at the start of surgery. Patients who underwent CPP had stripping of total parietal peritoneum + pelvic peritoneum + bilateral diaphragmatic peritoneum and supracolic greater omentectomy with lesser omentectomy (Fig. 1 ). SPP included resection of involved visible disease. All specimens were labeled and submitted for pathological evaluation (Fig. 2 ). Histological tumor response was assessed by an oncopathologist. Following CRS, all patients underwent HIPEC by semiopen technique with a dedicated HIPEC machine (RanD Biotech ® ) using cisplatin 75–100 mg/m 2 [ ]. All patients received systemic combination of chemotherapy with platinum compound and taxane. All data were documented according to our institutional rules, including electronic archiving and video recording of the procedures. Adverse events were graded according to CTCAE [ ]. Clavien–Dindo classification was used to grade surgical complications [ ]. In-hospital mortality was recorded. The patients were followed up with regular CA 125 and radiological monitoring for any recurrence. Fig. 1 Progression-free survival Fig. 2 Overall survival
Inclusion Criteria

Statistical Analysis
A descriptive statistical analysis was carried out with the intention to treat and the quantitative and qualitative data was described according to means (± SD), medians (range) and percentages. Continuous variables are presented as mean with standard error of the mean or median with range or interquartile range as appropriate. The variables are compared with Chi-square test. Statistical correlations are tested by use of Spearman’s rank correlation. All p-values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Adverse events were recorded and graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. All mortality events during treatment were noted. Survival was calculated in a Kaplan–Meier survival curve. SPSS 22 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical analyses. Time to diagnosis of PM and survival were both calculated from the date of surgery.
All patients were counseled, and their informed consent was obtained. Ethics committee approval and institutional review board approval was obtained.
Results
From February 2013 to December 2017, 110 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer were treated at Manipal Comprehensive Cancer Centre. The median age was years 52 years (23–71). The median PCI of the entire study group was 12.4 (range 6–28). Optimal cytoreduction was achieved in all; CC0 and CC1 scores were achieved in 87 (79.1%) and 23 (20.9%), respectively. Multivisceral resections (> 4 organs resected) were performed in 14 (12.7%) to achieve complete cytoreduction; grade 3–4 morbidity was observed in 46 (41.8%). The in-hospital 30-day mortality was 6 (5.5%). Table 1 shows patient demographics, disease characteristics, surgery details and perioperative outcomes.

Median follow-up of the study was 45 months. Median PFS of the entire group was 27 months.
Out of the total cohort of 70 patients in the study, CPP was performed in 40 (36.4%) patients and SPP in 70 (63.6%). The surgeons involved in the study were specially trained in performing advanced CRS and HIPEC and have experience in performing over 150 cases of CRS.
The disease burden recorded as median PCI of the CPP group was 14.1 ± 7.9 (range 9–28) and SPP group was 10 ± 5.78 (range 6–22), respectively. The proportion of patients having CC0 resection in CPP was 35 (87.5%) and SPP was 52 (74.3%). Multivisceral resections (> 4 organs resected) were more common in CPP 10 (25%) versus SPP 4 (5.7%) group. The blood loss, operative time, hospital stay and ICU stay was comparable in both groups.
Major complications included respiratory, systemic sepsis, urological, anastomotic leaks and intraabdominal collections. In comparison, grade 3–4 morbidity was observed in 46 (41.8%) patients. The morbidity was more common in SPP group 26 (37%) than CPP group 20 (50%), and it was not statistically significant ( p = 0.133). Comparison between the two groups regarding the morbidity is shown in Table 2 .

Pathological assessment of the complete peritonectomy patients revealed the presence of microscopic disease of peritoneum in 12 of 40 patients (30%), when no visually evident tumor was detected by the surgeon.
In comparison, PFS was significantly higher in CPP group (33 months vs. 25 months, p < 0.05). The 3-year PFS was 42% versus 38%. The median overall survival was 48 months in SPP group (yet to be achieved in CPP group). The 3-year OS was 80% for CPP and 75% for SPP (Figs. 1 , 2 ).
Discussion
Studies have shown maximal surgical effort should be pursued to overcome the prognostic limits imposed by the tumor. It is the surgical component of CRS that contributes most to the final outcome of the patient. The benefit of a complete peritonectomy is often underexploited due to a skeptical attitude against the principle of maximal surgical effort.
It would be ideal to identify which areas have carcinomatosis deposits and thus need resection. This would prevent the morbidity associated with removal of non-affected areas. 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography has been studied to detect metabolically active lesions in epithelial ovarian cancer. But the routine use is not favored [ ].
Intraoperative detection of peritoneal metastases of ovarian cancer with 5-aminolevulinic acid has been shown to be safe and feasible. But the cost and limited availability make it an unviable option [ ].
The need for CPP has never been addressed thus far by a prospective trial. We attempted to provide an answer to this issue by means of performing a prospective study to evaluate the effectiveness and morbidity associated with extensive complete peritonectomy in the management of advanced-stage epithelial ovarian cancer.
Our results show a similar morbidity and mortality among patients undergoing CPP or SPP in ovarian cancer patients. The PFS was significantly higher in CPP group (33 months vs. 25 months, p < 0.05). This indicates aggressive surgical resection has a benefit.
The microscopic carcinomatous areas have a benign visual appearance, especially following NACT. Perioperative visual inspection is largely subjective and is inaccurate for evaluating the presence or absence of disease. NACT can cause fibrosis and adhesions in the peritoneal cavity and interferes with the perioperative evaluation of tumor spread. In recurrent cases, previous surgery causes scarring and entrapment of cancer cells. Most gynecological oncologists who prefer to perform involved field peritonectomy based on the visual inspection regularly underestimate the disease. Performing CPP reduces the chance of missing the microscopic disease, especially the chemoresistant clones, and therefore minimizes recurrence.
The documented results of the visual assessment were compared with the histopathological analysis. In the CPP group, our study showed the presence of disease in 30% of patients in normal looking areas of peritoneum. Complete peritonectomy in these patients benefitted from achieving complete removal of cancer.
A study showed that microscopically carcinomatous areas have a benign visual appearance more often after NACT than at primary surgery. The difference in sensitivity and accuracy in primary and interval operations for perioperative visual estimation of tumor spread was statistically significant ( p < 0.001) [ ].
Conclusion
In advanced epithelial ovarian cancer, microscopic carcinomatous areas have a benign visual appearance, especially after NACT. NACT may interfere with the perioperative visual evaluation of tumor spread and thus lead to incomplete resection of tumor in potentially resectable areas.
The potential benefits of CPP have been underutilized due to unrealistic and exaggerated concern regarding the prognostic limit and fear of associated morbidity. By means of CPP, the microscopic tumour deposits that would have been left behind and later grow resulting in recurrence is removed. Prospective trials on the extent of radical surgery and its benefit are ongoing.
