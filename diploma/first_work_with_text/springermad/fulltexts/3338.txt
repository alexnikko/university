Introduction
Myocardial injury occurs due to sudden obstruction of blood supply to a part of the heart which leads to ischemia, necrosis and death of the affected cardiac tissue [ ]. These cardiovascular diseases are the most important cause of death throughout the world [ ]. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 31% global deaths were reported due to the cardiovascular diseases in 2012. Isoprenaline (ISP) is considered as a nonselective β-adrenergic receptor agonist which is responsible for infarct like lesions and necrosis of myocardium at high dose [ ]. It is a well established fact that ISP-induced myocardial injury occurs due to auto-oxidation of catecholamine which generates free radicals, increased Ca ++ load, cardiac hypoxemia due to enhanced cardiac work, coronary vasoconstriction, interference of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation by free fatty acid, altered permeability of myocardium membrane through the elevation of nonesterified fatty acids and depletion of energy reserve of the cardiac muscle cells [ ]. Catecholamine oxidation leads to formation of quinoid compounds which are responsible for the stimulation of the production of superoxide anions and subsequently hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ). H 2 O 2 becomes a highly reactive hydroxyl radical in the presence of iron that leads to the oxidative damage to lipids, proteins and DNA, thereby influencing the myocardium of the heart [ ].
Various reports suggest that flavonoids-rich diet in plant-derived foods showed protection on human health since last many years [ , , ]. In recent years, it has been reported that natural product-based drugs are considered as the novel therapeutic strategy for prevention and treatment of inflammatory and various other diseases [ , ]. Kaempferol is a well-known flavonoid found in many edible plants such as broccoli, tea, cabbage, kale, beans, grapefruit, tomato, endive, leek, grapes and strawberries and in many other botanical/plant products commonly used in traditional medicine [ , , , , ]. Ingestion of foods containing flavonoids has a positive relationship in reduction in cardiovascular diseases as suggested by various epidemiological studies [ ]. Kaempferol exhibits various pharmacological activities such as cardioprotective [ , ], antihyperglycemic [ , , , ], anti-inflammatory [ , , , ], antiapoptotic [ ] and antioxidant [ , , , , , ]. One report showed kaempferol protected against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in vivo and in vitro [ ]. A study showed protective effects of kaempferol against cardiac sinus node dysfunction via calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) deoxidization [ ]. Previously, various studies showed the beneficial effect of kaempferol in ischemia/reperfusion-induced cardiac damage [ , , ]. Further, protective effect of kaempferol on LPS plus ATP-induced inflammatory response in cardiac fibroblasts was recently reported [ ]. A recent study suggested that kaempferol attenuated myocardial ischemic injury via inhibition of MAPK signaling pathway in myocardial ischemia–reperfusion injury [ ]. Further, another recent report suggests that kaempferol treatment for long duration showed improvement in cardiac injury model with respect to oxidative and apoptotic injury [ ]. However, short-term impact of preventive therapy of kaempferol with different dose schedules with respect to infarction, lipid content, pro-inflammatory cytokines gene expression profiling and gelatinase activity has not been investigated. Therefore, the present study was designed with the objective to evaluate the short-term preventive effects of kaempferol against isoprenaline-induced myocardial injury in rats. Further, second objective was to explore the mechanism of action of preventive effect of kaempferol, if any.
Materials and Methods
Drugs and Chemicals
Isoprenaline was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, USA. Kaempferol was purchased from the Cayman Chemicals, USA, and dissolved in ethanol and further diluted in PBS. All other general chemicals were of analytical grade and were purchased from SRL, India.
Animals and Experimental Design
Adult male Wistar rats were obtained from Laboratory Animal Resource Section, ICAR-Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar, and kept in divisional animal shed for acclimatization for a week. Rats were kept in proper managemental condition and provided with ad libitum feed and water throughout the experiments. The rats were divided into six groups containing six animals each. Group I: Rats served as control; group II: Isoprenaline (ISP) was administered subcutaneously to induce myocardial injury at a dose rate of 85 mg/kg body weight twice at an interval of 24 h. Kaempferol was administered intraperitoneally (ip) to the rats of groups IV, V and VI for a period of 7 days at different doses 1, 3 and 10 mg/kg body weight, respectively, followed by isoprenaline administration on sixth and seventh day at dose rate of 85 mg/kg subcutaneously at an interval of 24 h. Group III was administered kaempferol alone with a dose rate of 10 mg/kg body weight for 7 days. On eighth day of the experiment, rats from different groups were killed under urethane (1.2 g/kg BW i.p) anesthesia. Heart and blood were collected for the estimation of different biochemical parameters. During the experiments, in isoprenaline alone (group II), group IV (KEM 1 mg/kg + ISP) and group V (KEM 3 mg/kg + ISP), heavy to moderate mortality was recorded in the rats. Rats were died before completion 48 h of first dose of isoprenaline. However, in group VI (KEM 10 mg/kg + ISP), mild mortality was reported during the experiments. In each group, the new rats were added to maintain the statistical number. All the experiments were done under the guidance laid down by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee (IAEC).
Determination of Body Weight
Body weights of rats were measured by weighing balance before and after different treatments to observe the difference in body weight. Body weight of rats was presented in gram.
Myocardial Infarction
Approximately 2- to 3-mm-thick tissue slices of heart were prepared and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in 1% TTC (triphenyl tetrazolium chloride) stain before keeping it in 10% neutral buffered formalin for overnight. Myocardial infarcted areas were analyzed using image J software, NIH, Maryland, USA [ ].
Blood Pressure Measurement and Heart Rate
Rats were acclimatized for 2–3 days in rat holder, and noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP) was measured using tail cuff method (NIBP system, CODA, Kent Scientific Corporation, Torrington, CT, USA). Blood pressure was recorded according to the instrument’s instructions. Rat blood pressure and heart rate were recorded before administration of the isoprenaline and at the time of killing of the animal on 8th day.
Biochemical Estimation
Rats were killed on 8th day under urethane (1.2 g/kg BW i.p) anesthesia, and blood samples were collected for estimation of different parameters. The activity of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; catalog no. LDH010), creatine kinase–myocardial band (CK-MB; catalog no. CKB010), total cholesterol (cholesterol kit; catalog no. 71LS200-60), high-density lipoprotein (direct HDL cholesterol kit; catalog no. 71LS300-56), low-density lipoprotein (direct LDL cholesterol kit; catalog no. 71LS400-56), triglycerides (triglycerides kit; catalog no. 72LS100-60), SGOT (catalog no. 1102200025) and creatinine (catalog no. 11010600035) were measured by using commercial kits from Coral Clinical Systems and Auto Span liquid Gold (SPAN), Diagnostics, India. Troponin-I was estimated by using commercially available ELISA kit (catalog no. E01T0524, BLUEGENE, China).
Lipid Peroxidation and Antioxidants
Different oxidative stress and antioxidant parameters were done in the heart tissue, and heart tissues were homogenized in ice-cold PBS (pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min. Tissues were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen before making the homogenate for further investigation. The extent of lipid peroxidation in the homogenates was estimated by using thiobarbituric acid method in terms of MDA production [ ]. Various endogenous antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase were determined by the method described by [ ] and [ ], respectively. Nonenzymatic antioxidant reduced glutathione (GSH) was done by method described by [ ].
Assessment of Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMP)-9 Level and Pro-MMP-2 Activity Expressions
MMP-9 level was estimated in heart homogenate by ELISA kit (catalog no. CSB-E08008r; CUSABIO, China) as per manufacturer’s instruction. Gelatinase activities (pro-MMP-2 activity) were measured by the gelatin zymography method described previously [ ]. Proteins were separated from homogenate sample following electrophoresis on SDS-PAGE gel, copolymerized with 0.1% w/v gelatin. Gels were washed with 2.5% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature (with three changes of solution) to remove SDS. Gels were then incubated for 16–24 h at 37 °C in incubation buffer (50 mM Tris HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl 2 and 0.05% Na 3 N). After incubation, the gels were stained with 0.05% coomassie brilliant blue in a mixture of methanol–acetic acid–water (2.5:1:6.5 vol/vol) and destained in aqueous 4% methanol–8% acetic acid (v/v). Gelatinolytic activities were detected as transparent bands against the dark blue background.
Quantitative mRNA Expression Study
Real-time PCR technique was used to examine relative expression of cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in the heart tissues from all the groups.
Isolation of mRNA
Heart from different experimental groups of rats was collected in 0.1% diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated autoclaved PBS and was stored in RNA later at − 80 °C for further processing. Total RNA was isolated with Trizol method (Ambion, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. The samples were treated with RNase-free DNase, and the DNase was subsequently inactivated by heating at 56 °C for 10 min and immediately chilled to 4 °C. The purity of the RNA was quantified by NanoDrop ® spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, USA). RNA samples with an A260/A280 ratio of 1.8/2.0 were used for reverse transcription. cDNA synthesis was carried out using High Capacity RNA-to-cDNA Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Applied Biosystems, USA) as per the manufacturer’s instruction.
Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction
Real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed using SYBR Green Master Mix (Fast SYBR Green Master Mix; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Applied Biosystems, USA). Each sample was run in duplicate in a 20 μL reaction. The 20 μL reaction mixture consisted of 12.5 μL SYBR Green Master Mix, 0.5 μL from 10 pmol/μL stock solution of each of the gene-specific forward and reverse primers, and 1.5 μL of cDNA and volume was made up to 20 μL with RNAse-free water. The real-time PCR was started with initial incubation at 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of amplification with denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing (temperature varied according to primer pairs) for 30 s and extension at 72 °C for 30 s each. The optimum annealing temperatures determined by PCR for the respective gene using the specific primers were as follows: for TNF-α gene F 5′-GGTCCCAACAAGGAGGAGAA-3′, R 5′-GCTTGGTGGTTTGCTACGAC-3′ (134 bp; NM_012675.3) at 59 °C and for β-actin gene: F 5′-CCTCTATGCCAACACAGTGC-3′, R5′-CACAGAGTACTTGCGCTCAG-3′ (142 bp, NM_031144.3) at 60 °C. A dissociation curve was generated at temperatures of 55 °C through 95 °C to assess the specificity of the amplified product. The results obtained from the experiments were expressed as threshold cycle values (C T ) which is the cycle number when the fluorescence of the reporter dye is appreciably higher than the background fluorescence. The threshold was used for the generation of C T values which was automatically adjusted by the instrument.
Histopathology
Rats were killed from each group, and the organs, viz. heart and liver, were collected. The tissue samples were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and processed by routine paraffin-embedding technique. Briefly, 4- to 5-µm-thick sections were cut, deparaffinized and stained by routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining method for detailed microscopic studies [ ].
Statistical Analysis
Results are expressed as mean ± SEM. The mean values from different groups were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test using GraphPad Prism version 4.0 software. Comparison between two groups of change in body weight before and after isoprenaline administration was done by using paired Student’s t test. The \(2^{{ - \Delta \Delta C_{T} }}\) method was used to study the relative change in gene expression as described previously [ ]. Formula used to calculate the fold change in gene expression was “fold change = \(2^{{ - \Delta \Delta C_{T} }}\) ,” where ∆∆ C T = ( C T ,target gene − C T ,β-actin ) treatment—( C T ,target gene − C T ,β-actin ) control. Gene-specific amplification was corrected for the difference in input of RNA by taking housekeeping gene β-actin to account. For ISP and kaempferol-treated groups, evaluation of \(2^{{ - \Delta \Delta C_{T} }}\) indicates the fold change in gene expression relative to control (i.e., fold change in control = 1). The results were analyzed in comparison with the C T (minimum threshold of amplification) value of the target gene and the reference gene (β-actin). A value of p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.

Myocardial Infarcted Area and Change in Body Weight
As shown in Fig. 1 a, b, isoprenaline significantly ( p < 0.001) induced infarction in heart tissue in comparison with control rats. Rats pretreated with kaempferol (10 mg/kg) for 7 days followed by ISP administration showed significant ( p < 0.001) decrease in infarcted area in comparison with ISP-alone-administered rats. However, kaempferol (1 and 3 mg/kg) pretreatment did not reduce the myocardial infarcted area in the myocardial injured rats.

Histopathological Examination of Heart Tissue
As shown in Fig. 9 , heart of control rats (A) showed normal histoarchitecture of cardiac myocytes with orderly arranged muscle fibers with apparently no evidence of microscopic changes in the heart. Isoprenaline administration (B) showed severe multifocal areas of mononuclear cell infiltration predominantly macrophages and lymphocytes amidst cardiac myocytes. Further, cardiac myocytes showed severe degenerative changes including loss of striation and disappearance of nucleus in myocardial injured group. Pretreatment of kaempferol (1 and 3 mg/kg) did not any show improvement in the histopathological changes in comparison with ISP-alone-administered group (C & D). However, pretreatment with kaempferol (10 mg/kg) in myocardial injured rats showed mild mononuclear cell infiltration and degenerative changes in heart tissue section in comparison with ISP-administered group (E). Heart section of kaempferol-alone group (F) revealed apparently normal histoarchitecture of cardiac myocytes with centrally placed nucleus.

Serum SGOT Level
Further, serum SGOT level was higher in isoprenaline-administered rats (1.08 ± 0.04-fold; n = 3) in comparison with control rats (1.00 ± 0.01; n = 3). However, kaempferol pretreatment (1, 3 and 10 mg/kg) followed by ISP administration did not show any significant reduction in SGOT level. Further, kaempferol pretreatment (1, 3 and 10 mg/kg) followed by ISP administration showed higher level (1.43 ± 0.13; 1.28 ± 0.21; 1.23 ± 0.14-fold; n = 3) of SGOT level in comparison with ISP-alone-administered rats (1.08 ± 0.04-fold; n = 3).

Serum Creatinine Level
Isoprenaline administration in rats showed higher level of serum creatinine level (1.06 ± 0.22 mg/dl; n = 3) in comparison with control rats (0.97 ± 0.22 mg/dl; n = 3). However, kaempferol pretreatment (1, 3 and 10 mg/kg) followed by ISP administration did not show any significant change in serum creatinine level in comparison with ISP-alone-administered rats. However, kaempferol (10 mg/kg) pretreatment in control rats did not show any significant change in the serum creatinine level (Fig. 10 b).
Histopathological Examination of Liver Tissue
As shown in Fig. 11 , liver section of control rats showed normal histoarchitecture of hepatocytes arranged as ray of cords surrounding the central vein and each cord was separated by distinct sinusoids (A). Distorted histoarchitecture of hepatocytes characterized by diffuse swelling of hepatocytes with severe degenerative changes (vacuolar degeneration) and loss of sinusoids were observed in isoprenaline-administered rats (B). Pretreatment with kaempferol (1 mg/kg) followed by isoprenaline administration showed severe swelling of hepatocytes with vacuolar degeneration of hepatocytes and few heptocytes showed coagulative necrosis. Rupture of hepatocytes was also evident (C). Kaempferol (3 mg/kg)-pretreated rats followed by myocardial injury showed moderate swelling of hepatocytes around the central vein and showing vacuolar degeneration surrounding the central vein (D). Rats pretreated with kaempferol (10 mg/kg) followed by ISP administration showed normal cordlike arrangement of hepatocytes with moderate swelling of hepatocytes (vacuolar degeneration) around the central vein (E). Further, it was noted that kaempferol-pretreated control rats showed apparently normal hepatocytes surrounding the central vein and mild to moderate swelling of hepatocytes in the paracentral areas (F).

Discussion
In the current study, myocardial infarcted area was significantly more in ISP-treated rats in comparison with control rats. However, kaempferol significantly decreased the myocardial infarcted area in myocardial injured rats. Our findings are in agreement with a previous report which suggested that kaempferol improved the myocardial infarction in ischemia–reperfusion injury in rats [ ]. The present study suggests that kaempferol may be improving oxygen demand in the infarcted heart tissue. The significant attenuation of myocardial infarction on kaempferol pretreatment was evident by decrease in the infarcted area of the heart tissue sections. The decreased effect may be due to the fact that kaempferol has anti-inflammatory activity in different conditions. However, kaempferol pretreatment at all the doses did not improve the body weight of the myocardial injured rats.
Isoprenaline significantly decreased mean arterial pressure compared to control rats. However, kaempferol pretreatment for 7 days did not improve the systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure. Contrary to our results, a recent study suggested that kaempferol improved the different hemodynamic parameters such as left ventricular diastolic pressure (LVDF), + LV d p /d t in ischemia reperfusion injury in rats [ ]. Kaempferol significantly decreased the heart rate in myocardial injured rats. This finding is in agreement with earlier report in which kaempferol improved the cardiac function [ ]. Further, recently protective effects of kaempferol against cardiac sinus node dysfunction [ ] and myocardial injury in ischemia–reperfusion model [ ] have been reported. Recently, it has been reported that kaempferol pretreatment showed improvement in blood pressure and left ventricular dysfunctions at highest dose of kaempferol but lower doses were not effective up to that much of extent [ ].
Administration of isoprenaline enhanced serum LDH, CK-MB and troponin-I levels in comparison with control rats. However, kaempferol showed decrease in serum LDH, CK-MB and troponin-I levels in myocardial injured rats at different doses. ISP produces myocardial cell damage and releases the LDH, CK-MB and troponin-I from the cells to the blood, thereby increasing levels of LDH, CK-MB and troponin-I in serum. The current study is supported by previous reports that enhanced activities of LDH, CK-MB and troponin-I enzymes in the serum are indication of cell damage, change in the functional integrity and permeability of cell membrane [ , , ]. A recent previous report also in agreement with our study which suggests that kaempferol treatment showed improvement in LDH and CK-MB activities in ischemia–reperfusion injury in rats [ ]. One more previous study observed that kaempferol co-treatment improved LDH activity in doxorubicin-induced cardiac injury in rats [ ]. Previously, kaempferol pretreatment for long term showed a dose-dependent decrease in serum LDH and CK-MB level in isoprenaline-induced cardiac injury; however, significant effect was observed at highest dose (20 mg/kg) of kaempferol [ ]. Further, kaempferol (20 mg/kg) co-administration for long term showed reduction in the serum LDH and CK-MB in ischemia–reperfusion-induced myocardial injury in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats [ ]. On the basis of the present and past observations, this study suggests that kaempferol at different doses reduced myocardial injury in rats which may be due to prevention of leakage of the cardiac marker enzymes.
It is a very well established fact that isoprenaline changes the lipid profile in the rats [ , , , ]. Further, reports suggest mechanisms for the changes in the lipid content such as isoprenaline alters the activity of liver 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl-coenzyme-A-reductase in the rats [ ]. Further, it has been suggested that catecholamines may alter the heart membrane composition and affect the PUFA composition of heart membranes which is mainly through an increase in arachidonic acid content [ ]. According to another mechanism, it is believed that lipolytic hormones including isoprenaline on fat cells are opinioned that it may be mediated by the cAMP signaling pathway, in which these hormones activate adenylate cyclase (AC) and thereby increase in the cAMP formation. Further, cAMP enhances lipolytic activity by activating cAMP-dependent protein kinase and which leads to phosphorylation of the hormone-sensitive lipase and ultimately results in hydrolysis of stored triacylglycerol which is contributing to hyperlipidemia [ ]. The present study showed reduction in cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and triglyceride level in kaempferol-pretreated rats. Further, kaempferol pretreatment also enhanced the level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in myocardial injured rats. These results are in agreement with earlier reports that plants containing kaempferol as active constituent have shown antihyperlipidemic activity in different conditions [ , ]. Recently, some another studies showed that alcoholic extract of Dalbergia sissoo (containing isoflavones like kaempferol) showed significant improvement in lipid profile in alloxan-induced diabetes in rats [ ] and isoprenaline-induced myocardial injury in rats [ ]. On the basis of these observations, it is suggested that antihyperlipidemic effect of kaempferol may be due to changes in the lipid metabolism in the body of myocardial injured rats. Altered membrane structure and enzyme inactivation in myocardial infarction are the most important event which is induced due to production of MDA in isoprenaline-induced myocardial injury, and this increased production of free radicals might be responsible for the damage of cell membrane [ , ]. Reduction in MDA level may be one of the mechanisms by which kaempferol might decrease the formation of free radicals and protect the cell from further damage. It has been identified that antioxidant enzymes (SOD and catalase) and nonenzymatic antioxidant (GSH) have important role in protection of damaging tissue [ ]. The present study is in agreement with previous study which suggests that kaempferol co-treatment showed improvement in SOD and catalase activities in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in rats [ ]. Further, another study observed that treatment of kaempferol improved SOD, MDA and GSH activities in heart tissue of ischemia–reperfusion injury in rats [ , ]. Further, kaempferol pretreatment modulates systemic inflammation and oxidative stress following hemorrhagic shock in mice [ ]. However, contrary to our study, flavonoids including kaempferol showed pro-oxidant activities in various reports [ , ]. Apart from this, one more study is contradictory to our study also which showed that kaempferol induced nuclear DNA degradation along with lipid peroxidation in isolated rat-liver nuclei [ ]. GSH activity was decreased in heart homogenate in isoprenaline-induced myocardial injury. However, kaempferol pretreatment did not improve the reduced glutathione activity in this tissue in the current study. Further, it is suggested that kaempferol may act by inhibition of free radicals and inactivate the peroxidase enzymes and ultimately leading to protection of cell damage from oxidative stress. SOD is the enzyme mostly present in cytoplasm and mitochondria and acts as the defense system against the oxidative damage in the cell [ ]. In the current study, reduction in myocardial injury of kaempferol may be by reversing the activity of SOD in ISP-induced cardiac injury. Result of the present study is in agreement with previous study in which kaempferol showed significant improvement in cardiac injury through antioxidant potential in doxorubicin-induced/ischemia–reperfusion injury in rats [ , ]. Previously, kaempferol pretreatment and co-treatment for long term showed a dose-dependent increase in antioxidant enzymes in isoprenaline-induced cardiac injury as well as ischemia–reperfusion-induced myocardial injury in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats; however, significant effect was observed at highest dose (20 mg/kg) of kaempferol [ , ]. Further, another study observed that kaempferol treatment for long term showed attenuation of cardiac hypertrophy induced by aorta banding by regulating oxidative stress [ ]. However, improved oxidative damage with kaempferol may be better explained with limitation of pro-oxidant activity of the compound.
Isoprenaline increased MMP-2 activity and MMP-9 levels in myocardial injury as demonstrated previously also [ , ]. The present study reports that kaempferol pretreatment showed decrease in pro-MMP-2 activity and MMP-9 levels at higher dose. MMPs are the important enzymes for the degradation of the extracellular matrixproteins and tissue remodeling which include heart tissue [ ]. Cardiac fibroblasts are considered to be the main source of the synthesis and secretion of MMPs in the heart. Further, it has been reported that MMP-2 and MMP-9 play a major role in extracellular membrane remodeling because of their ability to initiate and continue the degradation of fibrillar collagen [ ].
Various pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α and IL-1β increase the cardiac injury [ , ]. In the present study, the mRNA expression of TNF-α did not increase after acute administration of ISP. Findings of our study in accordance with a recent study showed that mRNA expressions of cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β were decreased and IL-6 expression was increased in ISP-treated rats [ ]. Apart from this, various other studies have reported that ISP increases the expression of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 [ , ]. Further, a study reported that TNF-α production was decreased and further no change was observed in IL-6 production in ISP-administered volunteers [ ]. From these observations, it may be interpretated that different pro-inflammatory cytokines could have different reactions after activation of β-receptors and which may be related to a complicated inflammatory process [ ]. Further, it may be explained in terms of different times, schedules and doses of ISP administration in different models which may be responsible for an influence on the pro-inflammatory cytokines production [ ]. In the present study, we have observed that TNF-α was not changed with the kaempferol pretreatment in the rats. However, contrary to our report, previous report suggested that kaempferol improved the serum level of TNF-α and IL-6 in rat model of cardiac injury [ ].
Previously, it has been observed that isoprenaline increased the serum SGOT and creatinine level in the rats [ , ]. Further, we have observed higher level of these serum markers in ISP-administered rats in comparison with control. Serum SGOT and creatinine level were not decreased with kaempferol pretreatment in cardiac injured rats. In the present study, it has been noted that serum SGOT levels were higher in kaempferol-pretreated rats in comparison with ISP-alone-administered group. In contrary to our results, phytochemical, digoxigenin-3-O-rutin showed reduction in these parameters [ ].
Further, histopathological findings suggest that there were multifocal areas of mononuclear cell infiltration amidst cardiac myocytes, degenerative changes, discontinuity in muscle fibers and abnormal architecture in isoprenaline-administered group. Pretreatment with kaempferol (10 mg/kg) showed mild mononuclear cell infiltration, degenerative changes, intact myocytes with less myofibril defragmentation. Kaempferol has this reduction in injury due to anti-inflammatory activity. This study is consistent with earlier report which showed that kaempferol had anti-inflammatory activity in mice model of shock [ ]. In the present study, kaempferol (10 mg/kg) pretreatment in myocardial injured rats showed normal cordlike arrangement of hepatocytes with moderate swelling of hepatocytes (vacuolar degeneration) around the central vein. Nevertheless, it was noted that kaempferol-pretreated control rats showed apparently normal hepatocytes surrounding the central vein and mild to moderate swelling of hepatocytes in the paracentral areas. Previously, it has been suggested that kaempferol treatment showed improvement in histopathological changes of kidney tissue in mercuric chloride-induced toxicity in rats [ ].
In conclusion, kaempferol attenuates isoprenaline-induced myocardial injury through improvement in antioxidant, antihyperlipidemic, anti-inflammatory potential as well as decreased in pro-MMP-2 activity and MMP-9 level. On the basis of above observations, the present study may be summarized that various diets containing kaempferol would be helpful in those persons who are at the risk of cardiovascular disorders.
