Introduction
The causation of thrombus formation in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is various and complicated, especially in the hypercoagulability of stroke [ , ]. Recent studies have reported that thrombin and fibrin D-dimer were elevated in AIS [ , ]. However, the definitive relationship between stroke and this hypercoagulable state remains unclear. Although various thrombophilia factors seem to explain the enhanced procoagulant activity (PCA), such as increased protein C resistance and reduction of protein C, protein S, and antithrombin [ , ], there is conflicting data in correlation of AIS with these factors [ ]. Thus, it is conceivable that there are additional mechanisms involved in the hypercoagulability in AIS.
Phosphatidylserine (PS) is a cardinal cofactor in hemostasis and thrombosis leading to thrombin formation via providing binding sites for FXa and prothrombinase complexes. PS is typically sequestered to the inner plane of the bilayer membrane and only externalized on the outer membrane during activating processes such as clotting and inflammation [ ]. Some studies have shown increased P-selection expression on platelets, reduced E-selection expression on leukocytes, and an increase in hemoglobin bound to erythrocyte membranes, indicating activation of blood cells in stroke [ , ]. However, relatively little is known about the PS exposure on blood cells in response to stroke.
The activation of blood cells is associated with plasma membrane remodeling, resulting in the shedding of membrane-derived microparticles (MPs) that are rich in accessible PS and specific cell-surface antigens [ ]. Changing levels of circulating MPs were associated with severity, lesion volume, and outcome of ischemic stroke [ , , , ]. Recent studies have shown that the levels of MPs decreased after long-term antiplatelet therapy [ ]. Nevertheless, early changes in MP levels and the associated effects on PCA in the acute stage of ischemic stroke have not been evaluated.
In this study, we assessed the levels of PS exposure on blood cells and cell-derived MPs during 7 days post-AIS by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Additionally, the effects of blood cells and MPs on PCA were determined by clotting time and purified coagulation complex assays. In this study, lactadherin was used to detect PS exposure and also act as an efficient anticoagulant by antagonizing the coagulation protein assembly on PS [ ].

Patients
Patients from the First and Fourth Hospital of Harbin Medical University with ongoing stroke symptoms and neurologic deficits of less than 12-h duration were recruited. Patients with any of the following characteristics were excluded: history of stroke; history of surgical procedure and coronary artery disease within 3 months of presentation; acute or chronic inflammatory diseases; renal, hepatic, or hematological disorders; autoimmune or malignant diseases; recent trauma; and inability to understand the consent form. Emergency magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) was performed to exclude intracerebral hemorrhage. A total of 128 patients were studied. Data were included from 79 patients with AIS and excluded from 49 patients with the following characteristics in the study: (1) stroke symptoms and neurologic deficit disappeared within 24 h ( n = 6), (2) wrong/unclear diagnosis ( n = 3), (3) treated with thrombectomy ( n = 7) and anticoagulant treatment before blood draw ( n = 26), (4) hemorrhagic transformation ( n = 2), and (5) incomplete blood samples ( n = 5). Peripheral venous blood samples were collected at 12 h (initial time) and 24 h, 3 days, and 7 days after the onset of clinical symptoms. National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score at admission assessed stroke severity. Lesion volumes on MRI or CT were evaluated on two occasions by an experienced observer blinded to the patients’ clinical presentations. Ischemic stroke was classified into the following subtypes according to the Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) system: large-artery atherosclerosis, small-vessel occlusion, cardioembolism, and stroke of undetermined etiology [ ].
Blood samples of 32 healthy volunteers and 35 risk factor-matched (RF) patients were included for comparative assessment in the study. The RF group included patients with no history of stroke, no treatment of anticoagulant, and one or more of the following risk factors: hypertension, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, dyslipidemia, carotid artery stenosis, or a smoking history. Eight (22.9 %) RF and 18 (22.8 %) stroke patients received routine antiplatelet treatment at the same time before blood draw. After admission, all patients received antiplatelet treatment after the initial blood draw. Seventy (88.6 %) and nine (11.4 %) patients received single and dual antiplatelet treatments, respectively. Informed consent was obtained from each participant, and the study was performed according to the protocol approved by the ethics committee of Harbin Medical University according to the Helsinki Declaration.
PS Exposure and Function Assays
Using flow cytometry, PS exposure on blood cells was quantified based on the binding of lactadherin as described previously [ ]. To measure the number of PS + MPs, a known count of larger beads (Trucount beads, Becton Dickinson) was used as an internal standard enabling us to calculate the absolute number of MPs per volume of specimen. MPs were initially gated as those particles that were less than 1 μm in size in a plot of side scatter and forward scatter and lactadherin positive. MPs from different cells were distinguished using the following markers: RBC MPs (RMPs) were CD235a + , endothelial cell MPs (EMPs) were CD31 + CD41a − , platelet MPs (PMPs) were CD41a + , leukocyte MPs (LMPs) were CD45 + , neutrophil MPs (NMPs) were CD66b + , monocyte MPs (MMPs) were CD14 + , and lymphocyte MPs were CD3 + [ ].
The effect of various cell types and MPs on PCA was evaluated using a one-stage recalcification time assay. FXa and prothrombinase formation were measured at 405 nm in kinetic mode on a Universal Microplate Spectrophotometer (PowerWave XS; Bio-Tek). Inhibition assays of coagulation time and purified coagulation complexes were performed using lactadherin and annexin V [ , ].
Statistical Analysis
Numerical variables were tested for normal distribution with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation, and statistical analysis was performed using t test or ANOVA as appropriate. Correlations between two continuous variables were performed using Pearson correlation coefficients, and Spearman rank correlations were used to detect discrete variables. Categorical variables were compared using the χ 2 test. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Participant Characteristics
As shown in Table 1 , patients differed significantly for levels of C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) when compared with controls. However, there was no significant difference between stroke patients and the RF group for the other clinical parameters. There was no significant association of any PS exposure phenotype with any demographic or with any treatment of medication before stroke, such as antiplatelet, statins, antihypertensive, or hypoglycemic in these series. There was also no significant correlation of any PS exposure phenotype with the use of t-PA treatment ( n = 17) or with treatment of dual antiplatelet ( n = 9) in the patients with acute stroke. As shown in Table 2 , the levels of APTT were significantly lowered at 24 h and 3 days compared with the initial values. In contrast, D-dimer increased markedly at 7 days. There was no significant change in the PT and fibrinogen levels.

PS Exposure on Blood Cells and MPs
Flow cytometry analysis showed that the mean percentage of lactadherin + RBCs in AIS patients was significantly higher than that in two control groups (AIS 2.6 ± 0.8 %, RF group 1.4 ± 0.6 %, and healthy controls 0.7 ± 0.5 % ( P < 0.001 for each)). Platelets from AIS patients showed increased PS exposure (8.3 ± 2.6 %) as compared with RF group (4.7 ± 1.5 %; P < 0.001) and healthy controls (1.3 ± 0.8 %, P < 0.001). High levels of PS exposure on leukocytes were observed in the AIS group (11.6 ± 4.7 %) compared to RF group (8.0 ± 3.1 %, P = 0.001) and healthy controls (4.4 ± 2.0 %, P < 0.001) (Fig. 1 b). As shown in Table 3 , AIS patients had higher absolute counts of PS + blood cell types than the RF patients and healthy controls.

As shown in Fig. 1 c, confocal laser-scanning microscope images showed that control platelets did not stain lactadherin (green fluorescence, Alexa 488). In contrast, a light green fluorescence was observed on platelets from AIS patients. Similarly, strong green fluorescence labeling was observed on erythrocytes and leukocytes from AIS patients (Fig. 1 c).
As shown in Table 3 , the RF group had higher levels of PS + MPs than healthy controls ( P < 0.01 for all MP types). In addition, greater numbers of total PS + MPs were observed in stroke patients (1949 ± 483/μl) than that in RF group (1674 ± 387/μl, P = 0.019). All the MPs, but lymphocyte MPs, were increased in AIS patients compared with the RF group ( P < 0.05 for all).
Blood samples of AIS patient were drawn at various time points to determine the changes in PS + blood cells in 1 week following stroke. We found that PS + RBCs rose continuously over the 7 days. In contrast, PS + WBCs and platelets peaked at 24 h and returned to their initial (12 h) levels at 3 and 7 days, respectively (Fig. 1 d). Total PS + MPs were higher than initial levels from 24 h to 3 days ( P < 0.05; Fig. 2 a). As shown in Fig. 2 b, the changes in the MPs subsets were generally consistent with the trends of their source cells. PS + EMPs peaked at 24 h ( P < 0.001 vs. 12 h) and remained high for the later time points (Fig. 2 b). Fig. 2 The changes in the number of PS + MPs measured within 7 days of stroke. a Microparticles ( MPs ) were defined as events <0.1 μm in size and were assessed as lactadherin positive using flow cytometry. b MPs were subdivided by testing for cell-surface markers from their origin cells.

PCA and Inhibition Assays in Stroke
As shown in Fig. 3 a, with equal numbers of RBCs, platelets, or WBCs, the coagulation time was significantly reduced in the RF group compared with healthy controls ( P < 0.001). Similar results were obtained using equal volumes of MPs ( P < 0.001). Furthermore, the coagulation time of AIS patients was shorter than that of the RF group ( P < 0.01 for all). The dynamics of coagulation time were largely consistent with the observed changes in PS exposure. Blocking PS using lactadherin or annexin V significantly extended the coagulation time of blood cells and MPs ( P < 0.001 for lactadherin, <0.01 for annexin V). In contrast, neutralizing TF using anti-TF antibody only prolonged the coagulation time of WBCs ( P = 0.003). Fig. 3 PCA and inhibition assays of blood cells and MPs. a Coagulation time of platelets, RBCs, WBCs, and MPs decreased in AIS compared with RF and HC groups. Lactadherin and annexin V inhibited the coagulation time of blood cells and MPs. Anti-TF antibody only affected the coagulation time of WBCs. b Compared to controls, intrinsic, extrinsic Xase complex, and thrombin generation promoted by RBCs, platelets, WBCs, and MPs in AIS increased markedly. Addition of lactadherin or annexin V reduced the production of three procoagulant enzyme complexes in AIS samples. c Correlation of thrombin formation with initial PS exposure on blood cells and MPs. Initial PS + platelets were significantly correlated with thrombin formation of separate platelet. Correlations were found between thrombin generation and the number of PS + platelets, RBCs, WBC, total MPs, and PMPs. In contrast, there was no correlation with initial levels of RMPs, LMPs, or EMPs. ** P < 0.01, *** P < 0.001. r -values were determined using Pearson correlation coefficients. P < 0.05 was considered significant. PCA procoagulant activity
A significant increase in the production of intrinsic and extrinsic FXa and prothrombinase by blood cells and MPs was observed in the stroke group (12 h) relative to the HC group ( P < 0.001). Addition of lactadherin or annexin V inhibited all three procoagulant enzyme complexes to similar levels as the HC group (Fig. 3 b).
There were significant correlations between PS + blood cells/total MPs and thrombin formation. Interestingly, the MP thrombin formation was correlated with PMPs ( r = 0.356; P = 0.002), but not with RMPs, LMPs, EMPs (Fig. 3 c), NMPs, or lymphocyte MPs (data not shown).
The Correlation of Disease Features with PS Exposure
The level of PS + platelets at 12 h in stroke patients was positively correlated with stroke severity as assessed by NIHSS score ( r = 0.376; P < 0.001; Fig. 4 a). Similarly, there was a significant correlation between the level of initial circulating PMPs and NIHSS score ( r = 0.320; P = 0.005; Fig. 4 b). However, we did not observe any correlation of stroke severity with other PS + blood cells and MPs ( P > 0.05). We obtained the effective data of lesion volume from 64 stroke patients (7.3 ± 2.8 cm 3 ). The lesion volume was positively correlated with the level of initial PS + PMP ( r = 0.277; P = 0.013), but not with other parameters. Fig. 4 The correlation between initial PS exposure and NIHSS score on admission. a Initial amount of PS + platelets and b PMPs were strongly correlation with stroke severity as assessed by NIHSS score on admission. r values were determined using Spearman rank correlation. P < 0.05 was considered significant. NIHSS National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale
Thrombin Generation by Blood Cells and MPs in Different Stroke Subtypes
As shown in Table 4 , the thrombin generation of platelets (at 12 and 24 h) and MPs (at 12 h) was significantly higher in cardioembolism (CE) than non-CE ( P < 0.05). Thrombin generation on RBC, WBC, or platelets and MPs at later time points was not significantly different between TOAST categories.

Discussion
Though many studies have investigated the increased PCA in AIS [ , , , , , ], relatively little is known about the contribution of activated blood cells. Our results demonstrate for the first time that PS exposure on blood cells and MPs in AIS was significantly higher than that in healthy and RF controls. The data also show the time-dependent dynamics of PS exposure and accompanying PCA in 1 week following stroke. The enhanced PCA in patient samples could be restored to control levels by the addition of PS inhibitors.
Apart from increase in PS + platelets, our results also demonstrate that half of the procoagulant MPs in the patient samples are derived from platelets. Increased exposure of PS on platelets and MPs shortened the coagulation time and supported the formation of intrinsic/extrinsic factor Xase and prothrombinase, which are known to promote the coagulation cascade reaction and subsequently lead to increased thrombin generation [ , ]. Moreover, we found that the levels of procoagulant platelets and MPs peaked at 24 h and then decreased at 7 days, which points to massive platelet activation in the early course of ischemic stroke. Additionally, we found that the early elevation of PS + platelets and PMPs is associated significantly with severity of stroke as assessed by NIHSS. This implies that activated platelets may directly be related to the extent of brain injury.
The levels of PS + RBCs and RMPs, an aspect largely overlooked in AIS, continuously increased within 7 days after ischemic stroke. Wohner et al. showed that activated and aggregated RBCs in post-thrombus are gradually released into the circulation after the strengthening of fibrinolytic system [ ]. Others and our studies found that circulating levels of D-dimer increased markedly at 7 days supporting this hypothesis [ ].
EMPs could inhibit endothelial nitric oxide synthase leading to impaired vasodilation, resultant platelet aggregation, and increased arterial stiffness, which can lead to worsening of the stenosis of cerebral vasculature [ ]. Our results found that EMPs maintained a high level for at least a week, reflecting the persistent injury of endothelial cells in AIS. Although there is no other study of LMPs in stroke, it is well known that leukocyte recruitment and aggregation exacerbate the impairment of endothelial cells and ischemic brain tissue [ ]. Early levels of LMPs may be enhanced by leukocyte activation and inflammatory reaction. A recent study provided compelling evidence that the levels of LMPs can independently predict high-grade carotid plaque instability [ ], supporting our findings.
Recent studies have shown that thrombin markedly elevated in stroke [ ] and induced ischemic long-term potentiation [ ]. However, the mechanism of such increase in thrombin formation remains unclear. Our results have shown that increased thrombin in AIS was restored to control levels by blocking PS exposure. Furthermore, the amount of thrombin formation by blood cells and MPs is closely correlated with the levels of PS + cells and total MPs released, consistent with our hypothesis that thrombin generation in AIS was directly related to the increased level of PS exposure.
Some studies have found that hemostatic biomarkers were significantly elevated in patients with CE [ , ]. However, others have not observed significant differences between TOAST categories. Our results showed that thrombin generation by platelet and MPs is significantly higher in CE versus other patients only at the initial time point. It is likely that early PCA of activated blood cells is related to the etiology of ischemic stroke, but subsequent changes are mainly from inflammatory response and tissue damage due to acute infarction. Early enhanced PS-PCA in CE may be in part due to the effect of complication, such as atrial fibrillation. Abnormal concentrations of prothrombotic indices (e.g., prothrombin fragments 1 and 2, thrombin-antithrombin complexes, and D-dimer) are more prominent in stroke patients with atrial fibrillation than those with sinus rhythm [ ].
Although stroke patients received timely antiplatelet, the PCA was still intensively enhanced. Thus, only antiplatelet treatment is not sufficient to entirely prevent thrombophilia. Our data indicate that PS exposure on blood cells and MPs contributed to the hypercoagulability in the acute stage of ischemic stroke. It seems that blocking PS is crucial to attenuate the hypercoagulable state. PS provides binding sites for FXa and prothrombinase complexes and promotes thrombin formation. Thus, inhibition of FXa and thrombin could play a role in preventing blood coagulation in AIS. Additionally, the results from this study suggest that future research should focus on the application of PS inhibitors as a therapeutic strategy against ischemic cerebral infarction in vivo.
