Introduction
Clinical heterogeneity is one of the distinctive features of CLL, some patients doing well for decades without intervention, others survive only a couple of years due to progressive disease. In the last decade, major efforts were made to explore the biological background of this diversity. Out of the numerous prognostic factors introduced in CLL, immunoglobulin gene mutation status has been established as one of the most reliable and informative prognostic factors. Representing an imprint of the cellular origin of the disease, the relative lack of somatic hypermutation in the IgVH genes is associated with progressiveness, poor-risk cytogenetics, CD38 positivity and short survival. Being stable over time, it is also used as reference when investigating new markers [ , , ]. IgVH mutation status, genetic abnormalities and serum markers, optimally applied together provide complementary prognostic information [ , ].
Microarray studies identified distinct sets of genes expressed differentially in mutated vs unmutated CLL [ , ] and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) was one of several genes being overexpressed in unmutated cases. Based on these preliminary observations, together with ZAP-70 and other molecular markers, the role of LPL in CLL prognosis assessment was investigated by different groups. These studies indicated that LPL correlates closely with clinical course and survival [ , , , , , , , , ]. Physiologically, LPL is expressed in muscle, adipose tissue, macrophages, but not in normal T and B lymphocytes [ ]. Bound to capillary endothelium and released upon heparin, LPL catalyzes the hydrolysis of triacylglycerol of circulating chylomicrons and very-low-density lipoproteins. Remarkably, a growing body of recent data indicate that lipid utilization and LPL function play an important role in the survival and metabolism of different tumors, including CLL [ , , , , ].
In this work we evaluated the prognostic role of LPL in CLL as determined by RT PCR from unselected peripheral blood. Our results show that LPL accurately predicts outcome and is related closely to other prognostic markers in this disease.
Patients and Methods
CLL Patients
The study cohort included 84 patients attending the haematology clinic with available clinical history and LPL test results; no further pre-selection was applied. Clinical features, prognostic profiles and the incidence of various cytogenetic subgroups are presented in Tables 1 and 2 , respectively. Diagnosis of CLL was established by standard morphological and immunophenotypic criteria. The median follow-up period was 102 (40–496) months. During this interval, 43 patients were treated for disease progression and 22 patients died. Blood samples were taken either at diagnosis after informed consent or later. The study has been approved by the Central Ethics Committe.

RT PCR Analysis of Lipoprotein Lipase mRNA
Peripheral blood samples of CLL patients and two healthy controls were used for total RNA isolation by Trizol extraction method followed by reverse transcription. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) was performed by LightCycler 480 real-time PCR System with Sybr-Green detection format. ABL1 (v-abl Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1) was used as housekeeping gene to normalize LPL expression. Primer sequences were adapted from van’t Veer with modifications (LPL-F: 5′-CCG CCG ACC AAA GAA GAG AT-3′; LPL-R: CAA TGA CAT TGG AGT CTG GTT CTC TC-3′; and ABL-4F: 5′-GGG CTC ATC ACC ACG CTC CA-3′, ABL-6F: 5′-CTG CCG GTT GCA CTC CCT CA-3′ [ ]. As LPL and ABL1 amplifications showed similar efficiency determined as the slope of linear calibration curves, the relative LPL to ABL1 expression level was calculated by the ΔCp method (ΔCp = CpLPL-CpABL1). LPL/ABL1 expression in patients were normalized to the expression found in healthy control samples.
IgVH Gene Mutation Status
IgVH mutation status was analysed by a multiplex PCR method and BIOMED-2 standardized primers [ , ]. VH segment usage and the degree of sequence divergence from the nearest germline counterpart were identified using the National Institute of Health Ig Blast database. 95 % was used as a threshold to define IgVH mutation status positivity.
Interphase Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization
Dual-color interphase FISH analysis was performed on interphase nuclei of blood lymphocytes. The panel applied detected abnormalities at 11q22, 12 centromere, 13q14.3 and 17p13 using the following probes: Vysis LSI D13S319 (13q14.3) SpectrumOrange (SO) (30–190,045), Vysis LSI 13q34 SpectrumGreen (SG) (30–192,030); Vysis LSI ATM (11q22.3) SO (30–190,017), Vysis CEP12 SG (32–112,012); Vysis LSI TP53 SO (30–190,008), Vysis CEP17 SG (32–112,017) (Abbott Laboratories, Illinois, US). A minimum of 200 interphase nuclei were assessed from each hybridization using a Nikon E600 epifluorescence microscope. Images were captured and enhanced with the MacProbe 4.3 FISH software (Applied Imaging). Results were regarded clonal when the ratio of cells with any given abnormality exceeded the normal cutoff. Chromosome deletions or trisomy 12 were considered to be present when >8 % or >3 % of interphase cells showed one signal or three signals, respectively.
CD38 Measurement
For the diagnosis of CLL, three-colour immunostaining was used on peripheral blood samples using the following antibodies: anti-CD5 FITC (clone: L17F12), anti-CD19 PerCP-Cy5.5 (clone: SJ25C1), anti-CD23 PE (clone: EBVCS-5). CD38 was measured by dual staining for anti-CD19 FITC (clone 4G7)/anti-CD38 PE (clone HB-7), all monoclonal antibodies from Becton Dickinson. Measurements were performed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer and data analysed by the CellQuest software (BD). CD38 expression was evaluated within the CD19 positive B-cell population and expressed as percentage of CD38/19 dual positive cells. CLL clones with CD19/CD38 dual positive cells equal or greater than 7 % were considered CD38-positive.
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics were performed by the GraphPad Prism 5 software. ROC analyses [ ] and Fisher’s exact test were carried out with the Medcalc 10.2. program. For Kaplan-Meier and Cox multivariate survival analyses, the SPSS 15.0 software was employed. Statistical significance was accepted at p < 0.05.
Results
Distribution of LPL Values
LPL values normalized to healthy controls showed assymetrical distribution with a median of 0.66 (range 0–48) (Fig. 1 ). The optimal cutoff separating LPL positive and negative cases could be identified as 1.77 by ROC analysis. Applying this threshold, 34 patients were classified as LPL positive, 50 as LPL negative.

Correlation of LPL with Clinical Features and Other Prognostic Markers
Comparison of the LPL positive vs negative patient cohort showed association of LPL positivity with higher stages, CD38 positivity, unmutated IgVH genes and more treatment requirement. No differences were found between different genders or age groups (Table 1 ). A close linear relationship was found between LPL and CD38 ( p < 0.0001). Analysis of LPL expression in various cytogenetic subgroups revealed overrepresentation of LPL positive cases in adverse prognostic subgroups (11q-, 17p- or complex aberrations), whereas 80 % of those with 13q deletion were LPL negative (Table 2 ).
Survival Analysis
Overall Survival
Kaplan-Meier curves revealed markedly reduced survival in LPL positive vs negative patients (median survival 136 vs 258 months, p < 0.0001) (Fig. 2 a). In univariate analysis, IgVH mutation status, ( p < 0.007), CD38 positivity ( p < 0.001), clinical stage ( p < 0.009) and cytogenetic aberrations (p < 0.001) were found to have impact (Table 3 ). In the multivariate model, only cytogenetic aberrations (HR 3.64, p < 0.03) and LPL positivity (HR 4.21, p < 0.02) remained significant (Table 4 ).

Treatment-Free Survival
Time to first treatment (TTFT) was significantly shorter in LPL positive vs negative cases (36 vs 144 months respectively, p < 0.002) (Fig. 2 b.). Univariate analysis identified the same variables being significant in overall survival with the addition of age (Table 3 ). In the multivariate test, cytogenetic aberrations, IgVH mutation status and stage remained significant (Table 4 ).
LPL Expression in Good Prognosis Cytogenetic Subgroups
To explore whether LPL expression could dissect further prognostic subcohorts in this cytogenetic subgroup, cases with 13q deletion as the sole abnormality or with normal FISH results were assessed depending on concurrent LPL expression. Out of 40 patients with 13q deletion, 8 were LPL positive and 32 LPL negative (Table 2 ). During a median follow-up of 104 (40–496) months, 4 patients (50 %) died in the LPL positive group in contrast to 2 patients (6 %) in the LPL negative cohort. LPL positive patients had markedly reduced survival (median survival 108 months vs not reached, p < 0.001) (Fig. 3 a). Similar results were obtained when cases with 13q- and normal FISH results were evaluated together (Fig. 3 b).

Concurrent Use of LPL and CD38
To test whether applying LPL and CD38 together could provide further prognostic information. LPL/CD38 dual positive patients were found to have reduced survival (129 months) in contrast to dual negatives (median survival not reached). Discrepant cases had intermediate outcome (Fig. 4 ).

Discussion
Our results are consistent with previous reports that LPL expression is related closely to CLL progression and outcome. Patients with LPL values above the cutoff had markedly reduced overall and treatment-free survival. The association of LPL positivity with higher clinical stages, poor risk cytogenetics, unmutated IgVH genes, more treatment requirement and CD38 positivity are in agreement with earlier observations [ , , , ] reflecting the connection between LPL and aggressive course. Its close correlation with CD38, a marker of cell proliferation and activation in this disease [ , ] is especially remarkable. The fact that both CD38 and LPL can localize to lipid rafts [ ] can add further functional link between these two molecules. Moreover, our results show that the combined use of LPL and CD38 can improve prognostic accuracy, confirming the findings of Kaderi et al. [ ].
Most clinical studies on LPL recognize an association with cytogenetic abnormalities [ , , , ]. In our material, correlations with 13q, 11q-, 17p- and complex aberrations were found. Particularly interesting is the relationship with 13q deletion, regarded to confer the best outcome in CLL [ ]. Within this FISH subcategory, LPL expression could dissect a patient subcohort with extremely shortened survival. The fact that half (4 of 8) of LPL positive patients died during the follow-up in contrast to 2 of 32 LPL negatives indicates that LPL expression implies an aggressive, proliferative form of the disease able to offset the indolent course of CLL with 13q deletion. On the other hand, LPL negative cases with 13q deletion had extremely favourable outcome. These findings reinforce earlier observations [ , , , ] and support the simultaneous testing of LPL and cytogenetics routinely since 13q deletion itself does not seem to be robust enough to identify progressive cases correctly. The results also fit into reports showing remarkable heterogeneity of CLL with 13q deletion, progressiveness associated with larger fragment deletions [ ], mono- vs biallelic deletions [ ] or percentage of cells harbouring the abnormality [ ]. It remains to be seen whether earlier treatment could improve the otherwise dismal outcome of these patients.
Clinical studies of LPL are heterogeneous regarding the method how the optimal cutoff separating positive and negative values is defined. Some investigators apply a threshold fitted to IgVH mutation status [ ], employ Youden index [ ] or ROC analysis of survival results [ , ] as in this work. That our cutoff stands closest to Nuckel et al’s [ ] might relate to the fact that both include a normalizing step to healthy controls. To improve inter-study comparisons, these aspects of data analysis require further standardization.
The mechanism by which LPL mRNA can predict outcome as well as the significance of LPL enzyme function in CLL are still under investigation. The importance of lipid utilization in cancer cell viability has been shown in other cancer cell types [ ] and lymphomas including diffuse large cell lymphoma and Burkitt’s lymphoma [ , ]. Malignant cells are capable of both de novo lipid biosynthesis and fatty acid metabolism, both of which represent potential therapeutic targets [ ]. Although previous reports indicated that LPL in not active functionally in CLL [ , ], recent work from Rozovski et al. showed that unlike normal B-cells, CLL cells are capable to store lipids like adipocytes or monocytes and metabolize free fatty acids in an LPL-dependent manner with the transciption factor STAT3 initiating LPL transcription [ ]. Interestingly, the same study also found that LPL activation renders survival advantage for CLL cells. Moreover, BCR stimulation of CLL, but not normal CD5+ B-cells were shown to induce LPL expression, a process inhibited by the lipase inhibitor orlistat [ ]. Altogether, these data support the idea that lipid metabolism is required for the function and survival of actively signalling CLL cells, a process in which LPL plays a crucial role [ ]. They might also explain why high LPL expression is associated with progressive clinical course and short survival.
In summary, our results confirm that LPL expression is a strong predictor of outcome in CLL, indicating a progressive course with poor survival. Its presence can identify aggressive cases in good risk cytogenetic subgroups, thereby improving prognostic accuracy. These advantages and its relatively straightforward applicability make it an attractive candidate for regular clinical use.
