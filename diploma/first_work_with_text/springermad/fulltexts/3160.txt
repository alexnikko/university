Introduction
Development of oral delivery system for anticancer drugs represents the simplest and the most suitable way; however, it was hindered by poor water solubility, low permeability, toxic side effects in normal organs, and multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer [ ]. Methotrexate (2,4-diamino-N10-methyl propyl glutamic acid, MTX) (Fig. 1 c) is a Biopharmaceutical Classification System (BCS) class IV anticancer agent used for the treatment of different solid tumors such as osteosarcoma, lung, and breast cancer [ ]. Further, it was also used in the therapy of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease, and psoriasis [ ]. Unfortunately, oral bioavailability of MTX is very low (30–40%) due to its poor water solubility (0.01 mg/mL) and low permeability [ ]. Moreover, it also shows MDR in cancer and toxic effects to normal cells and produce adverse reactions like ulcerative colitis, hepatotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity that restrict its clinical applications [ ]. Drug delivery systems such as emulsome [ ], microspheres [ ], lipid drug conjugate [ ], solid lipid nanoparticles [ ], and liposomes [ ] have been attempted to improve oral bioavailability of MTX, but all with limited fruition. Fig. 1 a Chemical structure of Poloxamer 407, b GL44, and c MTX
Polymeric micelles (PMs) have a core-shell structure of which inner core is the hydrophobic part of the polymer, which can incorporate poorly soluble drugs, while the outer shell is hydrophilic part of the polymer protects the drug from inactivation in gastrointestinal tract [ ]. Due to their small particle size (< 200 nm), PMs could be absorbed in their intact form via endocytosis which transported macromolecules through enterocyte cell membrane [ ]. However, PMs have a limitation of insufficient drug loading [ ]. Mixed polymeric micelles (MPMs) are emerging alternatives as they are a collection of properties of different copolymers boiling down in a single polymeric micellar system [ , ]. Highest drug loading and enhanced stability are the most striking features of mixed micelles. The release and function of micelles can be tailored to be desirable by forming MPMs [ , ]. Therefore, MPMs would be an ideal formulation for the administration of MTX and could improve solubility, oral bioavailability, and therapeutic efficacy while reduce systemic toxicity.
Poloxamer 407 is a triblock polymer consists of ethylene oxide (EO) and propylene oxide (PO) blocks that are arranged in a basic triblock (EO 101 –P 56 –EO 101 ) structure (Fig. 1 a) that forms micelles in aqueous system. The hydrophobic PO core serves as a “pool” for the insoluble drug while hydrophilic EO corona maintains the dispersion stability of micelles [ ]. Additionally, it was shown to inhibit P-glycoprotein (P-gp) receptor and sensitizes multidrug resistant (MDR) tumors to anticancer drugs like paclitaxel and doxorubicin in vitro and in vivo [ , ]. Thus, Poloxamer micelles represent a promising drug carrier that can increase solubility and oral bioavailability of drugs that are P-gp-mediated substrates in vivo. However, Poloxamer 407 micelles are unable to encapsulate large amounts of hydrophobic drug, and their critical micellar concentration (CMC) is relatively high that leads to poor stability. MPMs are widely used to tackle these problems [ ].
Gelucire ® 44/14 (GL44) is lauroyl polyoxylglycerides, consisting of mixtures of monoesters, diesters, and trimesters of glycerol along with monoesters and diesters of polyethylene glycol (PEG) (Fig. 1 b). It is a biocompatible surface active lipid used as part of mixed micellar system to improve solubility, stability, and drug loading [ ]. Furthermore, P-gp inhibition activity of GL44 has been well reported [ ]. Additionally, it was reported that incorporation of drug in the lipidic carrier alters its oral pharmacokinetic profile [ ].
In the present study, we hypothesized that the MTX-loaded Poloxamer 407 and GL44 mixed micelles (MTX-PGMM) can reduce toxicity and increase the solubility, stability, and oral bioavailability of MTX. The mixed micelles were prepared by dialysis method and characterized in terms of morphology, critical micelle concentration, in vitro stability in media simulating physiological conditions of gastrointestinal tract, in vitro drug release, and in vitro anticancer activity. Furthermore, the oral bioavailability and toxicity of MTX-PGMM and pure MTX were investigated and compared.

Animals
Rat has been reported as a suitable model for assessing the oral absorption of drug in humans [ ]. Accordingly, healthy male Wistar albino rats weighing between 200 and 240 g were obtained from National Toxicology Centre (NTC, Pune, India) and used for pharmacokinetic study. Animals were maintained in an environmentally controlled room (25 °C ± 3 °C, 12 h dark–light cycle) with free access to food and water before experiments. Animals were fasted but provided free access to water, overnight before the commencement of the experiment. All studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee of Poona College of Pharmacy (Pune, India, registration number: 1703/PO/c/13/CPCSEA) with protocol approval number CPCSEA/PCT/15/2015 and were conducted under the provisions of the CPCSEA guidelines.
Determination of Critical Micellar Concentration
The critical micellar concentration (CMC) of Poloxamer 407, GL44 and Poloxamer 407/GL44 binary mixtures (20:80, 40:60, 50:50, 60:40, 80:20% w / w ) were analyzed in the deionized (DI) water by using the iodine UV spectroscopy method [ ]. The KI/I 2 standard solution was prepared by dissolving 0.5 g of iodine (I 2 ) and 1 g of potassium iodide (KI) in 50 mL of DI water. A set of polymer solutions with concentrations ranging from 0.00001% w / v to 0.1% w / v were prepared. To each of polymer solutions, 25 μL of KI/I 2 standard solution was added. The mixtures were incubated for 12 h in a dark room. The UV absorbance value of varying polymer concentrations at 366 nm was measured using UV–visible spectrophotometer (Double beam JASCO V-530, Japan). The absorption intensity of iodine was plotted against the logarithm of polymer mass concentration, and CMC was determined from graph. The sharp increase in iodine intensity indicates formation of micelles.
Preparation of MTX-Loaded Mixed Micelles
MTX-loaded Poloxamer 407 and GL44 mixed micelles (MTX-PGMM) were prepared using dialysis method [ ]. MTX (10 mg), Poloxamer 407, and GL44 binary mixture (50:50% w / w ) 300 mg were dissolved in 3 mL of DMF, introduced into dialysis bag (MW cutoff 8000 Da), and then dialyzed against 1.0-L distilled water which was replaced every 3 h in the course of 24 h. The solution was filtered through 0.45-μm filter to remove unloaded MTX. The blank mixed micelles (without MTX, BMM) were prepared by the similar method. Aqueous dispersion of MTX (MTX-AD) was prepared by dispersing 10 mg of MTX in 3 mL of distilled water containing 0.5% of carboxylmethyl cellulose using ultrasound probe sonicator (Vibra-Cell TM, VCX 500, Sonics & Materials, Inc., USA).
Characterization of MTX-PGMM
Micelles Size and Zeta Potential
Particle sizes of MTX-PGMM were determined by using laser diffraction technique (Malvern 2000SM, Instruments, UK) which allows sample measurement in the range of 0.05–20,000 μm. The micelle size measurement was carried out at 90° scattering angle. Sample was added to dispersion unit containing distilled water, and the average micelle size was determined. The analysis was performed in triplicate and reported as mean ± SD. The zeta potential was measured with the laser Doppler electrophoretic mobility measurements using Zetasizer 300 HSA (Malvern Instruments, UK) at a temperature of 25 °C.
Entrapment Efficiency
The amount of MTX in MTX-PGMM was determined by measuring its absorbance at 303 nm on a UV–visible spectrophotometer (Double beam JASCO V-530, Japan). The micellar solution (1 mL) was suitably diluted with DMF prior to determination. Entrapment efficiency (EE) was calculated according to the following equation $$ \%\mathrm{EE}=\mathrm{weight}\ \mathrm{of}\ \mathrm{MTX}\ \mathrm{in}\ \mathrm{mixed}\ \mathrm{micelles}/\mathrm{weight}\ \mathrm{of}\ \mathrm{MTX}\ \mathrm{fed}\times 100 $$ (1)
Morphology
Morphology of the MTX-PGMM was observed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-1200EX, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan), working on accelerating voltage of 100 kV. To prepare the samples for TEM, a drop of micellar solution was placed on a copper grid and stained with phosphotungstic acid solution (2% w / v ). Subsequently, the sample was allowed to dry in air and then examined under TEM.
Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of MTX, Poloxamer 407, GL44, and lyophilized MTX-PGMM were recorded on a FTIR spectrophotometer (JASCO FTIR-8400, Japan) after mixing in a dry KBr. Each sample was scanned in the range of 4000–400 cm −1 wave numbers at a resolution of 2 cm −1 .
Differential Scanning Calorimetry
Thermal properties of MTX, Poloxamer 407, GL44, physical mixture, and lyophilized MTX-PGMM were recorded using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC, 821e, Mettler-Toledo, Greifensee, Switzerland). Samples (5 mg) were heated in hermetically sealed aluminum pan with a heating rate of 10 °C min −1 over a range of 0 to 300 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere (flow rate of 50 mL min −1 ).
Stability of Micelles in Media Modeling Physiological Conditions of Gastrointestinal Tract
The stability of the MTX-PGMM formulation was evaluated after dilution with each of simulated gastric fluid without pepsin (SGF, pH 1.6) and simulated intestinal fluid without trypsin (SIF, pH 6.5) [ ]. SGF was prepared by mixing 0.2% sodium chloride (NaCl), 0.25% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and 0.7% hydrochloric acid (HCl) in water, and pH was adjusted to 1.6 by adding concentrated HCl. SIF was prepared by mixing 0.3% dipotassium hydrogen phosphate (K 2 HPO 4 ), 0.77% potassium chloride, 3 mM sodium taurocholate, and 0.75 mM lecithin in water, and pH was adjusted to 6.5 using NaOH. MTX-PGMM formulation was diluted with ten times with the media (SGF or SIF) and was incubated at 37 °C. After specific time intervals (2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 h), samples were analyzed for particle size and % EE. The experiments were done in triplicate and the mean ± SD values are reported ( n = 3) [ ].
In Vitro Release Study
In vitro release of MTX from MTX-PGMM was studied using dialysis bag method [ ]. Sample (5 mL) of micellar solution (MTX-PGMM) was placed into a dialysis bag (MW cutoff 12,000 Da) and tied at both ends. The dialysis bag was immersed into a beaker containing 50 mL of SGF (pH 1.6) at 37 ± 0.5 °C for first 2 h, and further it was transferred to 50 mL of SIF (pH 6.5) with continuous magnetic stirring at 100 rpm/min. Sink conditions were achieved by the addition of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in SGF and lecithin/sodium taurocholate in SIF. At predetermined time intervals (0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, and 48 h), sample was withdrawn and replaced with equal volume of fresh dissolution medium. The samples were analyzed by UV–visible spectrophotometer (Double beam JASCO V-530, Japan) at 303 nm. A similar procedure was used to determine the release of MTX from MTX-AD. Analysis of data was performed using PCP Disso software (V 3 i ; Poona College of Pharmacy, Pune, India).
Pharmacokinetic Study
Experimental Design and Sample Collection
Rats were divided into two groups, and each group contained six rats ( n = 6). Groups I and II received single oral dose (equivalent to 10 mg/kg of MTX) of MTX-AD and MTX-PGMM, respectively. After mild ether anesthetization, serial blood samples (0.5–2 mL each) were collected using retro-orbital puncture technique at predetermined time intervals (0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 12 h) in EDTA-coated tubes (BD Vacutainer ® K2 EDTA). The blood samples were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 45 min at 4 °C (Cryocentrifuge 2810R, Eppendorf, USA). The supernatant plasma was collected in polypropylene tubes and stored at − 20 °C before further HPLC analysis [ , ].
HPLC Method
The plasma MTX concentrations were determined using HPLC (reverse phase) analysis according to the method reported by Devi et al., with slight modifications [ ]. The plasma sample (150 μL) was mixed with 150 μL of internal standard solution (caffeine 10 μg/mL) and homogenized by vortex mixing for 2 min. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. MTX was then extracted by liquid–liquid extraction (LLE) using 150 μL of acetonitrile followed by vortexing for 2 min. After vortexing, the samples were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C (Cryocentrifuge 2810R, Eppendorf, USA). Then, the supernatants were transferred to new tubes and dried under nitrogen gas stream at 40 °C. The obtained residue was reconstituted in the 50-μL mobile phase via vortex mixing and was transferred to auto sampler vials from which 20 μL was injected into HPLC for analysis.
The HPLC system consisted of an auto sampler injector (AS-1555; JASCO, Japan) and chromatographic pump PU-1580 (JASCO, Japan) fitted with UV/visible detector (UV-1575; JASCO). For HPLC separation, a reversed-phase Hypersil ODS C 18 column (150 × 4.6 mm, micelle size 5 μm) (Thermo Electron Corporation, USA) with a Javelin Guard column (10 × 4.6 mm, micelle size 5 μm) filled with the same material was used. The mobile phase was composed of aqueous 0.01 M phosphate buffer (pH 3.9):acetonitrile (89:11% v / v ), and the pH was adjusted to 3.9 with glacial acetic acid (HPLC grade) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The run time for analysis was 15 min and the detection wavelength was set at 303 nm. Under these conditions, MTX and caffeine were eluted at 7.2 and 10.1 min, respectively. Limit of detection and quantification for MTX was 0.01 and 0.1 μg/mL, respectively. The ratio of peak area of MTX/IS was used for quantification of plasma samples [ ].
Pharmacokinetic and Statistically Analysis
The pharmacokinetic parameters were analyzed by a non-compartmentalized model with the aid of the program WINNON-LIN 4 (Pharsight Corp., Mountain View, CA, USA). Peak plasma concentration ( C max ) and times to reach peak concentration ( T max ) were determined from the individual plasma concentration-time curves. The terminal elimination half-life ( T 1/2 ) was calculated as 0.693/K e . The area under the plasma concentration-time curve ( AUC 0-∞ ) was calculated using log-linear trapezoidal rule. Mean residence time ( MRT 0-∞ ) was calculated as AUMC/AUC ; clearance ( Cl ) was calculated as dose/ AUC ; and the relative bioavailability ( Fr ) was calculated by using the following equation: $$ {F}_{\mathrm{r}}=\frac{{\mathrm{AUC}}_{\mathrm{micelles}}\times {\mathrm{dose}}_{\mathrm{free}}}{{\mathrm{AUC}}_{\mathrm{free}}\times {\mathrm{dose}}_{\mathrm{micelles}}} $$ (2)
The differences in pharmacokinetic parameters of the study groups were statistically evaluated by the post hoc Dunnett’s test. All values were expressed as their mean ± S.D. Differences were considered to be significant at a level of p < 0.05.
In Vitro Cytotoxicity Testing
In vitro anticancer activities of pure MTX, MTX-PGMM, MTX-BMM (MTX + blank mixed micelles), and BMM were evaluated against human breast cancer MCF-7 cells using in vitro SRB assay [ ]. The cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% v / v fetal bovine serum and 2 mM l -glutamine. Cells were seeded at the density of 5 × 10 3 cells per well in 96-well plates using in situ fixing agent trichloroacetic acid. After 24 h of incubation at 37 °C and 100% relative humidity, the growth medium was replaced with 100 μL of fresh medium containing various concentrations (0.1 to 50 μg/mL) of pure MTX in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, final concentration of DMSO kept below 0.2%), MTX-PGMM, MTX-BMM, and BMM. After 48 h incubation, the assay was terminated by adding 50 μL of cold trichloroacetic acid, and the cells were incubated for further 60 min at 4 °C. The media was removed and cells were washed with sterile phosphate-buffered saline and air-dried. A total of 50 μL of SRB solution (0.4% w / v in 1% acetic acid) was added to each well and further incubated for 20 min, at room temperature. After staining, unbound dye was removed by washing with 1% acetic acid and plates were air-dried. Bound stain was eluted with 10 mM trizma base, and the absorbance was read on an ELISA plate reader at a wavelength of 540 nm with 690 nm reference wavelength. Percent growth was calculated on a plate-by-plate basis for test wells relative to control wells using Eq. ( 3 ): $$ \mathrm{Control}\ \mathrm{cell}\ \mathrm{growth}\left(\%\right)=\frac{\mathrm{Average}\ \mathrm{absorbance}\ \mathrm{of}\ \mathrm{the}\ \mathrm{test}\ \mathrm{well}\times 100}{\mathrm{Average}\ \mathrm{absorbance}\ \mathrm{of}\ \mathrm{the}\ \mathrm{control}\ \mathrm{well}\mathrm{s}} $$ (3)
Using the six absorbance measurements at time zero [Tz], control growth [C], and test growth in the presence of drug at various concentration levels [Ti], the percentage growth was calculated in each of the drug concentration levels. Percentage growth inhibition was calculated as ([Ti − Tz]/[C − Tz]) × 100 for concentrations where Ti ≥ Tz or Ti − Tz is positive or zero and ([Ti − Tz]/Tz]) × 100 for concentrations where Ti ≤ Tz or Ti − Tz is negative. A growth inhibition of 50% (GI 50 ) was calculated from ([Ti − Tz]/[C − Tz]) × 100 = 50, as the drug concentration resulted in a 50% reduction in the net protein increase (as measured by SRB staining) in the control cells during the drug incubation. The drug concentration resulting in total growth inhibition (TGI) was calculated from Ti = Tz. The concentration of drug resulting in a 50% reduction (LC 50 ) in the measured protein at the end of the drug treatment compared with that at the beginning (indicating a net loss of 50% cells following treatment) was calculated from ([Ti − Tz]/Tz) × 100 = − 50.
In Vivo Toxicity Assessment in Mice
Mice were randomly divided into three groups (four in each). Group I (vehicle-treated group) received distilled water by oral route. Groups II and III received single oral dose (equivalent to 10 mg/kg of MTX) of MTX-AD and MTX-PGMM, respectively. All groups are treated for 15 consecutive days. Twenty-four hours after the last dose, animals were anesthetized by ether inhalation, and necropsy was performed on two randomly selected animals of each group to analyze the macroscopic external features of vital organs such as brain, heart, lungs, liver, kidney, and stomach. These organs were carefully removed and fixed in 10% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Histology sections (5 μm thick) were stained with hematoxylin and examined under a light microscope (Olympus CH02).
Stability Study
The MTX-PGMM was kept at room temperature for 48 h. The stability of MTX-PGMM was determined in terms of particle size, entrapment efficiency, and zeta potential for 0, 12, 24, and 48 h.
Results and Discussion
Determination of Critical Micellar Concentration
In vitro and in vivo stability of drug-loaded micelles depends on the CMC of polymers used. Generally, a low CMC value of a polymer represents high stability and ability to maintain integrity even upon dilution in the GIT and blood circulation. Therefore, we determined the CMC of both the polymers alone and in combination [ ]. In iodine UV spectroscopy method, the formation of micelles was monitored by using iodine (I 2 ) as a hydrophobic probe. Solubilized I 2 prefers to participate in the hydrophobic microenvironment of amphiphilic polymers, causing the conversion of I 3 to I 2 from the excess KI in the solution, in order to maintain the saturated aqueous concentration of I 2 [ ]. For determination of CMC, I 2 absorbance intensity was plotted as a function of polymer concentration, and a sharp increase in I 2 intensity against polymer concentration confirms the formation of micelles. CMC values of Poloxamer 407 and GL44 were found to be 0.00456 ± 0.0015% w / v and 0.00023 ± 0.00% w / v , respectively (Fig. 2 a, b) which were comparable with previous reported CMC values [ ]. In the preliminary study, different ratios of Poloxamer 407 and GL44 were used to determine the CMC of binary mixture. The results revealed that the 20:80, 40:60, 60:40, and 80:20 ratios of Poloxamer 407/GL44 binary mixture demonstrated CMC values higher than those of individual polymer. Preparing mixed micelles by using above mentioned ratios would have produced unstable micelles that easily dissociated on dilution by the much larger volume of blood in the body. However, Poloxamer 407 and GL44 binary mixture 50:50% w / w showed CMC at 0.0020 ± 0.004% w / v (Fig. 2 c) which was much lower than that of Poloxamer 407 alone. The reduction in CMC was attributed to the presence of GL44, which probably increased the hydrophobic interactions between the polymeric chains in the micellar core and stabilized the structure [ ]. In addition, the high number of poly (propylene oxide) moieties of Poloxamer 407 with the hydrophobic part of GL44 also contributes to the reduction in CMC which could improve the stability of the mixed micelles and great resistance to dissociation even on dilution by the much larger volume of blood in the body [ ]. Fig. 2 Representative plots of UV absorbance of I 2 versus log concentration of a Poloxamer 407, b GL44, and c Poloxamer 407-GL44 (50:50% w / w )
MTX-Loaded Mixed Micelles
The micelles formed by Poloxamer 407 and GL44 are viewed as a hydrophobic polypropylene (alkyl tail) core surrounded by a larger shell made from the hydrophilic polyethylene chains with their water of hydration (Fig. 3 a). The drug is immersed in the hydrophobic core of the micelles by hydrophobic interactions. Fig. 3 a Schematic representation of MTX-PGMM (MTX-loaded Poloxamer 407 and GL44 mixed micelles), b transmission electron microscopy image of MTX-PGMM, and c particle size distribution of MTX-PGMM
Characterization of MTX-PGMM
Micelle Size
The particle size might play a key role in determining the fate of micelles after oral administration. The mean size of MTX-PGMM was found to be 171.00 ± 2.00 nm (Fig. 3 c). Smaller micelle size (< 200 nm) of MTX-PGMM was due to a combination of Poloxamer 407 and GL44 binary mixture (50:50% w / w ) that increased the hydrophobic interactions between PPO chains of Poloxamer 407 and hydrophobic part of GL44 in micellar core and/or reduction in interfacial tension by surface active GL44 as to create compact micelles [ ]. MTX-PGMM micelles were above 100 nm and below 200 nm, a size suitable for efficient drug delivery as they can escape phagocytosis by macrophages, have prolonged circulation half-lives, and are more favorable for passive targeting to solid tumors via EPR effect [ ].
Zeta Potential
The zeta potential was measured to assess the surface charge, an indication of the stability of colloidal suspensions. MTX-PGMM displayed negative zeta potential value of − 17.99 ± 0.65 mV which can be attributed to the presence of EO of Poloxamer 407 and PEG group of GL44 on the surface of the micelles. Numerous studies have shown that high magnitude of zeta potential may have detrimental effects on blood circulation time. In the present study, it seems to be in suitable range considering the colloidal stability and blood clearance.
Entrapment Efficiency
Entrapment efficiency is the percentage of actual mass of drug entrapped in mixed micelles proportional to the initial amount of loaded drug. EE of MTX-PGMM was found to be 73.58 ± 2.38%. Higher values for EE were attributed to enhance partitioning of MTX in hydrophobic core of micelles and stable reaction among the aromatic ring in GL44, PO groups in Poloxamer 407, and MTX [ ].
Morphology
TEM revealed that the micelles have smooth surfaces and are spherical in shape (Fig. 3 b). The micelles shown in the TEM are slightly bigger in size than that tested from laser diffraction technique due to a certain extent of aggregation and expansion of micelles in the vacuum environment of TEM analysis.
Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy studies were carried to find out any interaction between MTX, GL44, and Poloxamer 407 (Fig. 4 ). FTIR spectrum of Poloxamer 407 showed characteristic bands at 3508 cm −1 (–OH stretching), 2865 cm −1 (C–H), and 1122 cm −1 (C–O). GL44 shows a characteristic band at 1637 cm −1 which is indicative of C=O stretching of ester group. MTX shows characteristic bands at 3332 cm −1 (O–H stretching), 1643 cm −1 (C=O stretching), 1596 cm −1 (N–H bending), 1406 cm −1 (C–O stretching), and 812 cm −1 (aromatic ring system). The spectrum of MTX-PGMM showed a broad band at 1604 cm −1 (N–H bending) and 1395 cm −1 (C–O stretching) and peaks in the fingerprint region at 843 cm −1 (aromatic ring system) indicating the presence of MTX. Moreover, it showed characteristic bands at 3286 and 1632 cm −1 indicating the presence of phenolic O–H of Poloxamer 407 and C=O of GL44, respectively. These results suggested that MTX was encapsulated by hydrophobic–hydrophobic interaction between MTX and polymer [ ]. Fig. 4 FTIR spectra of a MTX, b GL44, c Poloxamer 407, and d MTX-PGMM (MTX-loaded Poloxamer 407 and GL44 mixed micelles)
Differential Scanning Calorimetry
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) studies was carried out to examine the physical state of MTX inside the mixed micelles. The DSC thermograms of Poloxamer 407 and GL44 showed sharp endothermic peaks at 56.34 and 42.12 °C, respectively, indicating crystalline nature (Fig. 5 ). The MTX showed a shallow, broad exothermic peak at 126.08 °C indicating amorphous nature. The physical mixture showed distinct endothermic peaks at 42.23, 58.23, and 129.54 °C indicating the melting points of GL44, Poloxamer 407, and MTX, respectively. The MTX-PGMM formulation showed peaks at 44.42 °C and around 170 °C following a small endothermic peak (148.34 °C) caused by recrystallization of the encapsulated MTX, followed by the melting of crystalline MTX. The melting peak of melting of crystalline MTX appeared at higher temperature than that of amorphous free MTX. This confirmed molecular dispersion of MTX in the Poloxamer 407-GL44 mixed micelles [ ]. Fig. 5 DSC thermograms of a Poloxamer 407, b MTX, and c GL44 and d physical mixture of MTX, Poloxamer 407, and GL44 and e MTX-PGMM (MTX-loaded Poloxamer 407 and GL44 mixed micelles)
Stability of Micelles in Media Modeling Physiological Conditions of Gastrointestinal Tract
In order to ensure the release of the encapsulated drug at its site of absorption, the mixed micelles must resist the rapid dissociation caused upon dilution and exposure to the harsh conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. Thus, the stability of the MTX-PGMM micelles was investigated by studying changes in the size and % EE of the micelles on exposure to SGF (pH 1.6) and SIF (pH 6.5) for 12 h (Fig. 6 a, b) at 37 °C. In SGF, the size of micelles showed insignificant change over 2 h, and in SIF, the size of micelles slightly increased from 174.21 to 178.65 nm over 6 h. Insignificant change was observed in entrapment efficiency of MTX-PGMM in both the media. Considering the usual residence time of dosage forms in stomach is not more than 4 h and in intestine not more than 6 h, the results concluded that MTX-PGMM was not affected by gastrointestinal fluid during the course of its absorption in the gastrointestinal tract [ ]. Fig. 6 Stability study in terms of a size of the MTX-PGMM (MTX-loaded Poloxamer 407 and GL44 mixed micelles) in SGF (pH 1.6) and SIF (pH 6.5) and b entrapment efficiency (%) of the MTX-PGMM (MTX-loaded Poloxamer 407 and GL44 mixed micelles) in SGF (pH 1.6) and SIF (pH 6.5)
In Vitro Drug Release
The in vitro release of MTX from MTX-AD and MTX-PGMM under sink conditions was studied using dialysis bag. As micelles are administered by the oral route, to mimic the conditions of stomach and intestine, the release was conducted in SGF (pH 1.6) for first 2 h and in SIF (pH 6.8) for 48 h (Fig. 7 a). MTX-PGMM showed about 25% of MTX release within the first 2 h, whereas MTX-AD showed 10% of MTX release. Almost 71% of MTX release was observed after 48 h from MTX-PGMM, whereas MTX-AD showed 34% of MTX release after 48 h. The low release of MTX from MTX-AD was due to its poor solubility. MTX release from mixed micelles showed a biphasic pattern with an initial burst release followed by sustained release. Initial burst release may be due to hydration of the drug that is associated at the interface of the micelle core and hydrophilic corona or even due to the drug situated within the micelle corona that undergoes passive diffusion. There are three basic mechanisms for the release of the loaded drug from polymeric particles viz. swelling/erosion, diffusion, and degradation [ ]. One or all of these mechanisms may occur in a given release system. The hydrophilicity of the polymer determines the speed of uptake of water during the course of drug release. In the present system, the uptake of water into micelles occurred due to hydrophilic nature of PEG and PEO chains of GL44 and Poloxamer 407, respectively, leading to erosion of the micelle particles and allowing the drug within to diffuse through the pores. However, the hydrophobic core of micelles formed from the chains of Poloxamer 407 and hydrophobic part of GL44 retarded the diffusion of water into the core and slowed down the disintegration of the micelles on dilution with release medium. As a result, the overall diffusion of MTX from the micelles was gradual and gave a sustained release profile. Fig. 7 a Cumulative released amount of MTX from MTX-AD (MTX aqueous dispersion) and MTX-PGMM (MTX-loaded Poloxamer 407 and GL44 mixed micelles) in SGF (0–2 h) and in SIF (2–48 h) and b the plasma MTX concentration versus time profile from MTX-PGMM and MTX-AD after oral administration in rats.

SGF/SIF could successfully produce a sink condition and cannot interfere with the micelle structure, which could be concluded from stability and in vitro release experiments. However, the physiological condition cannot be perfectly mimicked by any simulated fluid. Moreover, it is unidentified whether the orally administered micelles can be affected by constituents of gastrointestinal tract. Thus, the oral bioavailability of MTX-PGMM was further examined by in vivo experiments.
Pharmacokinetic Study
Pharmacokinetic parameters of MTX-AD and MTX-PGMM were compared to assess the effect of micelle formulation on the oral bioavailability of MTX. The regression equation of HPLC calibration curve of MTX in plasma (0.1 to 20 μg/mL) was y = 0.0372 x − 0.0065 with a regression coefficient close to 1 ( R 2 = 0.992). It indicated linearity between MTX concentration and ratio of MTX peak area to peak area of caffeine. The retention times for MTX and caffeine (IS) were found to be about 7.2 and 10.1 min, respectively. The plasma concentration of MTX versus time profile of MTX-AD and MTX-PGMM is illustrated in Fig. 7 b, and the mean pharmacokinetic parameters of MTX from the MTX-AD and MTX-PGMM are summarized in Table 1 . Table 1 Pharmacokinetic parameters of MTX from the MTX-AD and MTX-PGMM after oral administration Parameters MTX-AD MTX-PGMM C max (μg/mL) 2.40 ± 0.72 10.056 ± 0.95*** T max (h) 1.50 ± 0.04 4.00 ± 0.09** T 1/2 (h) 1.33 ± 0.19 2.74 ± 0.21** AUC 0-∞ (μg/mL h) 6.12 ± 2.00 40.37 ± 3.00*** MRT 0-∞ (h) 3.25 ± 0.25 4.28 ± 0.21** Cl (mL/h/g) 4502.17 ± 58.14 787.71 ± 36.32*** F r – 6.59 Values were presented as mean ± SD ( n = 3). Data was analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by post hoc Dunnett’s test, with p < 0.05 versus control group considered as significant. All values are expressed as the mean ± S.D.

The MTX-PGMM showed about 4.1-fold increase in C max ( p < 0.001), 6.5-fold increase in AUC ( p < 0.001), 2.1-fold increase in T 1/2 ( p < 0.01), 1.3-fold increase in MRT ( p < 0.01), 5.7-fold decrease in Cl ( p < 0.001), and 2.6-fold increase in T max ( p < 0.01) as compared to MTX-AD.
MTX-AD showed C max at 1.5 h; moreover, the plasma concentration decreased rapidly, indicating rapid metabolism of the drug whereas MTX-PGMM showed reasonably slow rise in plasma drug concentrations with significantly delayed C max at 4 h, suggesting an obvious sustained release of the drug from the formulation. The considerable increase in T 1/2 and reduction in the Cl of drug from MTX-PGMM was attributed to long residence time. The significant increase in the AUC (40.37 ± 3.00) and F r (6.59) of the MTX from MTX-PGMM than MTX-AD distinctly indicates the improved bioavailability of MTX. This might be due to high absorption, sustained release of drug, and drug protection against enzymatic barriers [ ]. The P-gp inhibition effect of Poloxamer 407 and GL44 probably protected the drug from chemical as well as enzymatic degradation of MTX leading to an increase in intracellular transport, opening of tight junctions to facilitate the paracellular transport, thereby enhancing the AUC and MRT of MTX [ ].
In Vitro Cytotoxicity Testing
The in vitro anticancer activity of MTX, MTX-PGMM, MTX-BMM, and BMM was investigated against human breast cancer MCF-7 cells by SRB assay. The results illustrated in Fig. 8 a–d indicated that MTX-PGMM displayed superior anticancer activity than free MTX and BMM. The in vitro therapeutic effects of an anticancer drug could be quantitatively evaluated by its GI 50 which is defined as the drug concentration required for 50% cell death in a designated time. The GI 50 value of MTX-PGMM, MTX-BMM, BMM, and pure MTX against MCF-7 cells was 1.44 ± 0.33, 11.13 ± 0.14, 39.61 ± 0.85, and 13.71 ± 0.99 μg/mL, respectively. The LC 50 value of MTX-PGMM, MTX-BMM, BMM, and pure MTX for MCF-7 cells was 29.10 ± 0.93, 43.21 ± 2.13, 126.2 ± 0.58, and 45.44 ± 0.20 μg/mL, respectively. The TGI value of MTX-PGMM, MTX-BMM, BMM, and pure MTX for MCF-7 cells was 2.04 ± 0.20, 26.85 ± 1.68, 79.65 ± 1.30, and 34.7 ± 0.91 μg/mL, respectively. The enhanced cytotoxicity was attributed to greater cellular uptake of MTX-PGMM via phagocytosis or the solubilization of the fatty molecules on fusion of GL44 and Poloxamer 407 micelles to the bilayer membrane. The resultant enhanced permeability of the cell membrane to MTX allowed sufficient drug concentration inside the cancer cells. Moreover, BMM showed cytotoxicity due to chemosensitization of Poloxamer 407 on cancer cells which was reflected in MTX-BMM. This indicated that Poloxamer 407 exhibited synergistic cytotoxic effect with MTX [ ]. However, the GI 50 value of MTX-PGMM is even much lower than that of MTX-BMM, which suggests that the major cause of the enhanced cytotoxicity is the increased stability of MTX inside the micelle.

In Vivo Toxicity Assessment in Mice
The MTX-AD and MTX-PGMM were tested for normal toxicity by performing histopathological studies on brain, heart, lungs, liver, kidney, and stomach tissue in comparison to a vehicle-treated group (Fig. 9 ). The quantitative analysis of toxicity is shown in Table 2 . During the histopathological inspection, MTX-AD showed irregular arrangement of tissue and presence of edema, intracellular space, and edematous changes in brain tissue. Presence of myocardial necrosis, infiltration of inflammatory cells and myocardial degeneration in the heart while infiltration of inflammatory cells, mononuclear cells of pulmonary parenchyma in the lung were observed. Furthermore, necrosis was observed in the liver while tubular and intratubular degeneration or congestion was noted in the kidney. A variation in glands or superficial epithelium with presence of inflammatory cells in the antral mucosa was observed in the stomach tissue. MTX-PGMM treatment did not cause any significant tissue toxicity on vital organs studied. The reason behind the reduced toxicity by MTX-PGMM formulation could be attributed to the slow release of the MTX from the micelles over a prolonged period of time in comparison to the MTX-AD. Moreover, lower apparent volume of distribution could also have been responsible for reduced tissue toxicity. This study evidently confirmed the safety of MTX-PGMM and supports further clinical exploration.

Stability Study
The stability study for MTX-PGMM was performed in terms of changes in particle size, EE (%), and zeta potential on storage for 0, 12, 24, and 48 h. Insignificant differences were observed for all parameters (Table 3 .).

Conclusion
The mixed micelles developed for MTX (MTX-PGMM) displayed nanosize, good encapsulation efficiency, sufficient stability in media modeling physiological conditions of gastrointestinal tract, biocompatibility, and no tissue toxicity. MTX-PGMM demonstrated 6.59-fold increase in oral bioavailability as compared with MTX-AD, attributed to protection of the drug from chemical as well as enzymatic degradation. It also caused passive targeting effect to human breast cancer MCF-7 cells. Therefore, the current strategy of mixed micellar formulation composed of Poloxamer 407 and GL44 is promising for the oral delivery of MTX and other BCS class IV anticancer drugs having poor oral bioavailability and MDR in cancer.
