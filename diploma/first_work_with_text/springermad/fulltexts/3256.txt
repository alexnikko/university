INTRODUCTION
One of the most significant trends in contemporary medicine is its inclination towards personalised treatment. Advances in the fields of pharmacogenomics, diagnostics, and clinical trials enable to optimise each treatment according to the needs of a specific patient, taking into account individual physical and genetic characteristics and previous medication ( ) to prescribe an optimum drug administration regime ( , ). While a personalised drug absorption profile can be calculated with relatively good accuracy, in reality it can be achieved only partially by prescribing the drug in one of the available dosage strengths. The patient is often forced to take multiple tablets with different drugs throughout the day, which may lead to reduced compliance or even accidental under- or overdose.
To address these problems, new drug formulation technologies are being developed. In particular, the application of additive manufacturing methods could enable the design and production of patient-specific dosage forms with the desired combination of dose strength and drug release rate. For example, syringe-based 3D printing of a drug-containing paste was employed to produce polypills, containing up to five different drugs with both immediate and extended release profiles ( , ). Stereolithographic 3D printing was used to create drug-loaded hydrogel tablets where the release profile could be modified by water content in the formulation ( ). Ink-jet 3D printing coupled with a hot-melt extruded chamber was successfully used to produce tablets with varying internal geometries in order to modify the release rate ( ).
Perhaps, the most widespread 3D printing technology is Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM), which uses solid polymeric filaments as the feed material. It has been demonstrated that drug release kinetics from FDM dosage forms can be controlled in multiple ways. Tablets of different shapes (cylinder, cube, torus) were printed, while a chosen key characteristic remained constant (tablet weight, surface area or surface/volume ratio), successfully altering the dissolution kinetics ( ). Tablets containing acetaminophen were printed with varying inner core fill density and outside shell thickness, and their geometry was correlated with the dissolution and drug release rates ( ). In another study, caplets containing hydrochlorothiazide as a model drug were produced containing perforated channels of varying geometry and the effect on drug release rate and tablet disintegration mechanism was observed ( ). It was also demonstrated that FDM can yield tablets for immediate release by using drugs with a good solubility, adding dissolution enhancing excipients, or non-melting fillers to the filaments and keeping the printing temperature under the melting point of the drugs ( , ). In order to assess the potential of additive manufacturing in terms of patient acceptability, a randomised pilot study was conducted on 50 participants, observing their subjective response to printed dosage forms of different colours, sizes and shapes ( ).
However, the apparently endless possibilities offered by FDM to customise the tablet geometry, composition and inner structure, also raise an important question: how to choose, in a systematic way, the final set of tablet design parameters?
The drug release rate from FDM-printed dosage forms can be affected by the composition of the filament (drug content, specific ratio of polymers and fillers) and by controlling the inner structure of the dosage form (spatial distribution of porosity or combination of regions printed from different filaments). Since these characteristics depend solely on the supplied 3D drawing of the object to be printed, they can be rapidly adjusted before the final production step of the dosage form. The design of a personalised dosage form can therefore be considered an inverse problem, since the result (the required drug release profile, optimised for a specific patient) is prescribed and the task at hand is to find the structural parameters of the dosage form that are necessary to achieve this result. The engineering concept of finding the solution of an inverse problem using known correlations between the initial parameters and the end results is a prevalent algorithm in many fields of product development ( ). For example, in aeronautics, wings are designed using a database of airfoils, where the airflow and the resulting aerodynamic force are pre-calculated ( , , ). In chemical engineering, problems such as the optimization of heat transfer in large-scale systems ( ) can be solved in a similar fashion, as well as the design of “classical” (non-3D printed) dosage forms such as granules and tablets ( , ).
In the present work, we apply the concept of inverse problem solution by parametric design to pharmaceutical tablets produced by 3D printing. As a model substance, we chose a hypertension drug from the classification group BCS II (Biopharmaceutical Classification System). In order to solve the inverse problem, a series of tablets with varying porosity has been printed, and their drug release profiles were obtained experimentally and computationally. After the formation of a database of drug release profiles for 3D-printed tablets with systematically varying porosities, a computational approach, based on the numerical solution of the drug diffusion in the dissolution medium coupled with the erosion of the tablet structure, was employed. Tablets with the required drug release profiles were then designed and tested in silico by the superposition of structural elements with known release kinetics, before physically 3D printing the final tablet and confirming its dissolution profile by a USP (United States Pharmacopoeia) method.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
The Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API), polymeric excipients (Polymer 1, Polymer 2), and a plasticiser were kindly donated by Zentiva, k.s. The desiccant (also serving as an additional plasticiser) and a lubricant were purchased from Merck. The API was supplied in the form of a powder with a mean particle size of around 100 μm. Polymer 1 was a graft copolymer based on polyethylene glycol while Polymer 2 was a cellulose-based excipient. The Plasticiser was a polyether with a uniform chain length. The Desiccant was an organic acid with the ability to bind water during the extrusion process. The lubricant was an insoluble organic salt. All the substances were chosen so as to be commercially available approved pharmaceutical-grade excipients, frequently used in solid-state formulation development.
Production of Filaments for 3D Printing
The composition of filaments was optimised to achieve mechanical and rheological properties that ensure reproducible printability. The API load was fixed at 10% ( w / w ) and the proportion of the matrix polymers (Polymer 1, Polymer 2), the plasticiser, desiccant and lubricant was systematically varied until acceptable mechanical properties were achieved. The matrix polymers Polymer 1 and Polymer 2 at the right concentrations enable uniform dispersion of the API and provide sufficient mechanical durability of the filaments during FDM 3D printing, the Plasticiser increases the filament elasticity and the Lubricant facilitates continuous powder flow during hot-melt extrusion while also preventing powder aggregation, acting as an anticaking agent. The investigated composition ranges are specified in Table I . To produce the filaments, approximately 8 g of the mixture was added gradually to a co-rotating twin-screw hot melt extruder, Three-Tec ZE 12 HMI (Seon, Switzerland) with an automatic volumetric feeder. The filament extrusion rate was kept at 0.4 g/min, the temperatures of the heated segments were set to 70, 135, 140 and 118 °C and the torque was between 0.4–1.2 Nm at 120 rpm. The lower temperature of the last segment allowed the homogenised filament to emerge from the extruder in an almost solid state. Furthermore, an external fan, focused on the nozzle of the extruder, facilitated rapid cooling of the filament, leading to its solidification and ensuring homogeneity of its diameter. Before 3D printing, the filaments were stored in sealed plastic bags at room temperature.

Characterisation of Filaments
The mechanical properties of the filaments were characterised by using CT3 Texture Analyser (Brookfield Engineering). The bending modulus was measured by a three-point bending test. A 5-cm sample of the filament was placed on a holder (denoted TPB, Brookfield Engineering) with two stationary supports placed 15 mm apart, and the force-displacement curve was recorded using a dull knife probe (denoted TA7, Brookfield Engineering). The indentation hardness was measured by a needle probe (denoted TA9, Brookfield Engineering) pushed into a filament positioned horizontally on a flat support base table. In both cases, the force-distance curve was acquired in at least three repeat measurements. the Modulus of (bending) elasticity and the indentation hardness were obtained by linear regression of the force-distance curves.
Rheological properties of the filaments were characterised by a rotational rheometer with a cylindrical plate probe Ares G2 (TA instruments). To obtain representative values of viscosity, the values of dynamic viscosity at the temperature of 145 °C (the same temperature used for printing) were measured at shear rates from 0.1 s −1 to 10 s −1 , and averaged from four independently measured samples of the filaments. Newton’s power law was used to model the experimentally obtained dependence of viscosity on shear rate. The reference (normalised) viscosity for the filaments was obtained from the formula η = k γ a-1 , where η is the dynamic viscosity, γ is the shear rate, k is the normalised viscosity and a is the rate index.
To evaluate content uniformity, five samples (around 3 μg) were taken from separate portions of each filament, dissolved in 2 ml of phosphate buffer (pH = 6.8) and analysed by a UV/VIS spectrometer Specord 205 (Analytik Jena) by comparing the absorption of the samples to a calibration curve of the pure drug.
Tablet Design and FDM 3D Printing
The tablet template with a variable infill level was based on a cylinder with a diameter of 10 mm and a height of 5 mm. The tablet structures were designed using 3DS MAX DESIGN (Autodesk, Inc., USA) and imported to the 3D printer’s interface software, Cura 2.6.21. Tablets were produced using a commercial FDM 3D printer LulzBot TAZ6 (Aleph Objects Inc., Colorado), with a 0.5-mm nozzle, using modified settings for ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) filaments. The infill pattern was set to “lines” in order to print one set of straight parallel lines in each layer, shifting their orientation by 90° for each new layer. This setting lead to the formation of a grid made of orthogonal lines. The layer height (vertical resolution) was set to 200 μm. The horizontal thickness of the printed lines was partially limited by the diameter of the printer nozzle (500 μm), the tablet shell thickness was therefore set to 490 μm. The base and the top solid layer thickness was set to 0 μm in order to produce tablets with open pores and allow the API to diffuse into the dissolution medium. The print speed was set to 20 mm/s, resulting in a shear-rate at the nozzle exit approximately 40 s −1 . The optimum printing nozzle temperature was found to be 145 °C and, to ensure proper adhesion of the first printed layer, the build plate was heated to 60 °C.
Tablet Characterisation
Digital images of the tablets were obtained using a Pylon 4 UBS camera with an additional 2.5″ lens. For the acquisition of close-up images of whole tablets, Dino-Lite Pro AM3113T Mounted WD Digital Camera and the software DinoCapture 2.0 were used. Microscopic imaging of tablet surface was done using a digital camera Canon EOS 1100D with a close-up lens. Pore size of the printed tablets was evaluated by analysing the images using the public domain software ImageJ. To obtain the mean pore size, images from two tablets of each design were converted to a binary format, the area of four to six randomly selected pores was evaluated and the mean square root of those values was taken as the representative pore size.
In vitro Dissolution of Tablets
In vitro dissolution tests were performed using a USP 2 apparatus (Sotax AT7). The tablets were placed into a USP compliant Japanese Pharmacopoeia sinker basket 13 (purchased from Agilent) to decrease the variability of the results caused by potential floating of the tablets. All dissolution tests were performed under sink conditions. The dissolution medium was 500 mL of 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 6.8 at 37 ± 0.5 °C and 75 rpm. Samples (1.5 mL) were taken every 30 min, filtered through a 2.5-μm filter and analysed by liquid chromatography. All samples were analysed using the Waters Acquity UPLC system equipped with Xselect HSS C18 SB column (50 × 4.6 mm; 3.5 μm) and a PDA detector. The following gradient of 30 mM NH 4 H 2 PO 4 /acetonitrile at flow rate 0.8 mL/min was used: linear change from 60/40 to 30/70 (0–1 min) followed by steady state (1–2 min) and a linear change to starting conditions (2–2.25 min) followed by steady state for 1.25 to re-equilibrate. Data were processed using the Empower software. The concentration at each data point was calculated as the mean value from three separate measurements. The final dissolution curves (and their standard deviations) were the result of averaging individual dissolution curves of 4–5 independently printed and dissolved tablets for each of the specific tablet geometry/design.
Mathematical Model of Tablet Dissolution and Disintegration
Taking the CAD (computer-aided design) model of the tablet as an input, the simulation domain was discretised by the finite volume method into 108 × 108 × 60 cubical volume elements (voxels) with a spatial discretisation step h , and the tablet structure was encoded by the solid phase volume function f i ∈ 〈0;1〉, where 0’s represent fluid-phase voxels and 1’s represent solid-phase voxels. The spatial discretisation step was chosen such that the numerical solution no longer changed with further grid refinement. The diffusion transport of the dissolved API is considered between each pair of neighbouring fluid-phase voxels within a boundary layer, up to a specified distance L from the nearest solid/fluid interface, with sink conditions applied outside this boundary layer and equilibrium API solubility at the solid/fluid interface.
The model was solved in a dimensionless form by defining the dimensionless molar quantity \( \widehat{n}=n/\left({h}^3{c}^{\ast}\right) \) , the dimensionless concentration \( \widehat{c}=c/{c}^{\ast } \) , the dimensionless time \( \widehat{t}=t/{\tau}_0 \) and the dimensionless distance \( \widehat{x}=x/h \) , where n is the molar quantity of API, c is the API molar concentration, \( {c}^{\ast } \) is the equilibrium solubility of the API and τ 0 is characteristic time defined by τ 0 = h 2 /D where D is the diffusion coefficient of API in the dissolution medium. The dimensional analysis shows that, in addition to the system geometry, the model contains only three parameters: the characteristic time τ 0 , the dimensionless boundary layer thickness δ = L / h and the relative API solid-state concentration α = ρ / ( M w \( {c}^{\ast } \) ), where ρ and M w is the API density and molar weight, respectively.
The governing equations, initial conditions (i.c.) and boundary conditions (b.c.) can be summarised as follows: $$ \mathrm{API}\ \mathrm{mass}\ \mathrm{balance}\ \mathrm{in}\ \mathrm{fluid}\ \mathrm{voxels}\kern0.5em \frac{d{\widehat{c}}_i}{d\widehat{t}}=-{\sum}_j\left({\widehat{c}}_i-{\widehat{c}}_j\right) $$ (1a) $$ \mathrm{API}\ \mathrm{mass}\ \mathrm{balance}\ \mathrm{in}\ \mathrm{solid}\ \mathrm{voxels}\kern0.5em \frac{d{\widehat{n}}_i}{d\widehat{t}}=-{\sum}_j\left({\widehat{c}}_i-{\widehat{c}}_j\right) $$ (1b) $$ \mathrm{i}.\mathrm{c}.\mathrm{in}\kern0.34em \mathrm{fluid}\kern0.34em \mathrm{voxels}\kern0.2em {\hat{c}}_i\left(\hat{t}=0\right)=0\forall i:{f}_i=0 $$ (2a) $$ \mathrm{i}.\mathrm{c}.\mathrm{in}\kern0.34em \mathrm{solid}\kern0.34em \mathrm{voxels}\kern0.5em {\hat{n}}_i\left(\hat{t}=0\right)=\alpha \kern0.5em \forall i:{f}_i>0 $$ (2b) $$ \mathrm{b}.\mathrm{c}.\mathrm{at}\kern0.2em \mathrm{tablet}/\mathrm{fluid}\kern0.34em \mathrm{interface}\kern0.5em {\hat{c}}_i\left(\hat{t}\right)=1\forall i:{f}_i>0 $$ (3a) $$ \mathrm{b}.\mathrm{c}.\mathrm{at}\kern0.28em \mathrm{diffusion}\kern0.34em \mathrm{layer}\kern1em {\hat{c}}_i\left(\hat{t}\right)=0\forall i:\parallel {\hat{\mathrm{x}}}_i-{\hat{\mathrm{x}}}_{\mathrm{solid}}\parallel >\delta $$ (3b)
The rate of tablet dissolution is controlled primarily by the diffusion of dissolved API from the tablet surface through a stagnant layer of the dissolution medium (the boundary layer). Its width L depends on the hydrodynamic conditions around the tablet and could be calculated rigorously by solving the Navier-Stokes equations in the fluid phase surrounding the tablet. In the present work, a simplified approach was taken by assuming a constant width of the diffusion boundary layer and setting its value such that the numerical solution and experimentally measured dissolution profiles for reference cases were in quantitative agreement. Since all dissolution experiments were done under identical hydrodynamic conditions, the parameter δ is a “global” parameter that must have the same value for the regression of all dissolution experiments. Likewise, since all tablets were printed from the same material containing the same API (hence, the same density, molar weight, solubility and diffusion coefficient), the parameters α and τ 0 must also be identical for all tablets. The only differentiating factor between individual tablets was the infill level and its spatial distribution. As stated in the previous section, the dissolution experiments were done using a sample of 4–5 tablets for each infill level. A sample mean dissolution curve was calculated from these measurements for each infill level and then a single set of parameter values was found iteratively so as to minimise the global error between simulation and experiment.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Filament and Tablet Characteristics
Solid filaments containing 10% ( w / w ) of the API were produced by hot-melt extrusion as specified in section “ Production of Filaments for 3D Printing ”. The degree of filament “printability” depends on its mechanical properties—elasticity, hardness and cohesivity—in the solid state, and on the rheology (shear-rate dependent dynamic viscosity) of the melt at the printing temperature. Furthermore, sufficient uniformity of filament diameter and composition had to be achieved in order to enable defined mass flow during 3D printing. All these factors were shown to be dependent on the proportion of components in the formulation (the API, matrix polymers, plasticizers, lubricant) and settings of the extrusion conditions (temperature of the heated segments, screw rotation speed, powder feed rate, filament cooling and conveying rate). While the content of the API could be up to 30% ( w / w ) without losing printability, at high API loadings the reproducibility of the printing process was slightly reduced due to higher viscosity of the filament, which led to occasional clogging of the printer nozzle. Therefore, 10% ( w / w ) API content was chosen for the purpose of further tablet design experiments. It should also be noted, that the values of the elasticity modulus are also strongly dependent on the thickness of the filaments, as observed in past research ( ); therefore, the value is only relevant for a given filament diameter, but can still be used as a comparative characteristic. The final filament properties are summarised in Table II . The rate index a for the modified Newton’s power law (from which the normalised viscosity k was obtained) was 0.434 ± 0.037.

Following the successful extrusion of filaments, tablets were printed as specified in section “ Tablet Design and FDM 3D Printing ”. The CAD drawings of 3D tablet templates with variable infill density, and a detail of the FDM print-head, are shown in Fig. 1 . The infill level was systematically varied from 25 to 100% ( i.e. , completely filled tablet with no voids) while the shell thickness was kept constant. Furthermore, tablets with two different infill levels (70% and 30%) were printed by combining two sections as separate models and aligning them into the printer interface either in a stack or a pie arrangement (see “ Solution of the Inverse Problem ” and “ Experimental Verification of Inverse Problem Solution ” below). The actual printed tablet porosity ε was calculated from the formula ε = 1 − m x / m 100 where m x is the mass of a tablet with the infill level of x and m 100 is the mass of tablet with a 100% infill level. The properties of the printed tablets are summarised in Table III . Fig. 1 CAD drawings of cylindrical tablets with a single infill density that serve as input templates for 3D printing (left).

While reproducible tablet structures were achieved, the actual horizontal distance between the infill lines was smaller than the value set in the CAD models (Table II ). This was due to a slight overlap of the printed layers as shown in Fig. 2 . In reality, the single layers deposited during FDM do not have the form of rectangular stripes but rather flattened cylinders ( , , ). Therefore, the pore size evaluated from the microscopic images of the tablet upper surface only yields information about the minimum distance of the infill lines, not taking into account the vertical curvature of the deposited layers. Microscopic images of the tablets (Fig. 2 ) showed that in the case of 70% infill, the pores were partially blocked (regardless of the tablet orientation under the microscope or the illumination used). Fig. 2 Photographs of 3D-printed tablets and micro-scale details of their pore structure for tablets with a varying infill density of 25, 40, and 70% as indicated
The results of USP dissolution experiments of tablets with a systematically varying infill are shown in Fig. 3 . Tablets with a 70% infill showed no significant increase of dissolution rate compared to non-porous tablets with a 100% of infill, presumably due to pore blocking. In the case of 50% infill, an increase of the API release rate was observable due to the fact that all pores were already accessible and the surface area in contact with the dissolution medium was therefore higher. By reducing the infill level to 40%, 35% and 30% ( i.e. , by increasing tablet porosity and pore size), the API release rate was further accelerated, most probably due to increased contribution of convective transport through the pores, as opposed to diffusion-limited transport that occurs in smaller pores whose diameter is comparable with the thickness of the diffusion boundary layer. By reaching an infill level of 25%, no further increase of API release rate was observed because further increase of the pore size no longer enhanced the convective contribution to mass transfer. These findings are consistent with previous work where channels of varying size and position were implemented into 3D-printed tablets and it was found that in order for the pores to actively contribute to the dissolution rate enhancement, their size has to exceed a certain threshold (approx. 0.6 mm in that specific case) ( ). However, it should be kept in mind that the exact value or even the existence of any limiting tablet infill level depends on the tablet composition and the specific arrangement of the dissolution experiment ( e.g. , the tablet orientation with respect to the flow field, which affects the relative contribution of convective and diffusive mass transfer in the pores) ( ). Fig. 3 Experimentally measured dissolution curves of 3D-printed tablets with a single value of infill density, ranging from 25 to 100% as indicated. The data points represent the mean values and the error bars standard deviations ( n = 4)
Computational Dissolution Studies
Having experimentally established the limiting cases for the fastest and the slowest API release, the dissolution of tablets was simulated computationally using the procedure described in “ Mathematical Model of Tablet Dissolution and Disintegration ”. The parameter α was set based on the known physico-chemical properties of the API, while the diffusion layer thickness δ and the characteristic time τ 0 were adjusted iteratively such that a quantitative agreement between the measured and the computed API release curves was achieved for two reference cases, chosen to be 30% and 70% infill level. The eroding tablet structures obtained from the numerical simulation for these two infill levels are shown in Fig. 4 . Note that in the case of the 70% infill tablet, the pores contain a saturated solution of the API because the pores are smaller than the diffusion boundary layer thickness, and the tablet only erodes from the external surfaces. On the other hand, pores in the 30% infill tablet are accessible to the dissolution medium and the internal surfaces effectively contribute to the drug release. Consequently, the tablet eventually loses its integrity and breaks up into smaller fragments during the final stages of dissolution. Fig. 4 Evolution of tablet structure and concentration profiles of the API in the diffusion boundary layer during the three-dimensional simulated dissolution of tablets with the infill density of 30 and 70% (top and side view). The numbers below the figures indicate the fraction of the dissolved API at the corresponding times
Once the model parameters ( τ 0 , α and δ) were fixed, simulations for the intermediate infill levels were carried out and compared with the experimentally measured API release curves. This comparison is shown in Fig. 5 . While the agreement between simulations and experiment is very good in many cases, there are some systematic deviations in the case of 35% and 40% infills, particularly in the later stages of the dissolution experiment. This can be caused by a physical re-structuring of the tablets that is not captured by the model, as in this region of infill levels, the sensitivity to pore size is very high. A small degree of tablet swelling may lead to partial blocking of some pores in the later stages of dissolution, which results in a lower than predicted API release. In the early stages of dissolution when the tablet geometry and structure is still well defined, the agreement between the model and the experiment is good.

Solution of the Inverse Problem
Let us now consider the inverse problem, i.e. , the design of a composite tablet composed of regions with a different structure and therefore different local release rate of the API. Conceptually, this problem can be approached by using pre-calculated release profiles from single-infill tablets located at opposite ends of the design space—in this case we select the fast (30% infill) and the slow (70% infill) release cases as the basis—and then finding such combination of these basic structures that results in a prescribed overall release curve. To test this concept, let us consider composite tablets with a “pie” structure as shown in Fig. 6 , consisting of regions with a 30% and a 70% infill at varying proportions (1:3, 1:1, and 3:1). The API release curves obtained by computer simulation from these composite structures are shown in Fig. 7 as lines, while the points in Fig. 7 denote the interpolation of single infill tablet simulations, calculated according to the formula $$ {y}_{\mathrm{pie}}=\lambda\ {y}_{30}+\left(1-\lambda \right)\ {y}_{70} $$ (4) Fig. 6 Evolution of tablet structure during the in silico dissolution for composite pie-type tablets with combined infill of 30 and 70% combined at ratios 1:3, 1:1, and 3:1. The values in the bottom-right corners of each image represent the fraction of API released at the corresponding time Fig. 7 Comparison of interpolated dissolution curves calculated according to Eq. ( 4 ), shown as discrete data points, with dissolution curves obtained by full 3D in silico dissolution simulations of composite pie-type tablets, shown as lines. The dissolution curves of single infill tablets (30 and 70%) are reproduced from Fig. 5 for reference
The interpolation parameter λ has been calculated from the relation $$ \lambda =\left({\varphi}_{70}-{\upvarphi}_{\mathrm{pie}}\right)/\left({\varphi}_{70}-{\varphi}_{30}\right) $$ (5) where φ denotes the solid phase volume fraction in the tablet (Table III ). The value of λ for the 3:1, 1:1 and 1:3 pies is 0.452, 0.265 and 0.107, respectively. As can be seen in Fig. 7 , although the interpolation approach does not provide a perfect match with the full simulation of the composite structure dissolution, a reasonable agreement is obtained. The main advantage of interpolation from pre-calculated release profiles is its simplicity and speed, since no additional simulations are required and the calculation can be done using a simple spreadsheet or even by hand.
Experimental Verification of Inverse Problem Solution
As the final step of the design methodology, the composite structures were 3D printed (Fig. 8 a), the API release curves were measured by the USP method (Fig. 8 b) and compared with the release profiles obtained computationally (Fig. 9 ). The direct comparison of computationally predicted and experimentally measured API release profiles shows a very good agreement (the root mean square error between simulations and experiments was only 0.024, 0.013, and 0.026 for the 3:1, 1:1, and 1:3 composites, respectively), which confirms the viability of the in silico design methodology.

The data points represent the mean values and the error bars standard deviations ( n = 4) Fig. 9 Direct comparison of experimentally (represented by points, reproduced from Fig. 8 ) and computationally (represented by curves of corresponding colour) obtained dissolution profiles of 3D-printed pie-type tablets with two different values of infill density (30 and 70%) combined at ratios 1:3, 1:1, and 3:1. The dissolution curves of single infill tablets (30 and 70%) are reproduced from Fig. 5 for reference
It should be noted that due to the structure of the model, the methodology could also be applied for the prediction of dissolution profiles of tablets containing multiple APIs (multi-drug formulations). Once the diffusion coefficients of each component and the thicknesses of the diffusion layer are provided by a small set of experimental data using single-API tablets, and as long as there is no irregularity such as excessive swelling of one of the APIs that could alter the tablet pore morphology, the prediction of the release of each API separately from a combined tablet should be possible.
One practical aspect to consider is that combining regions with different infill levels in a pie structure is not the only possibility; another option is to form a stack, simply layering regions with different infill levels on top of each other while preserving the overall tablet height. Such structure was 3D printed in the case of 1:1 ratio of the 30% and 70% infill regions, and indeed its dissolution curve is nearly identical to that of a pie arrangement with identical composition (Fig. 8 b). While this approach might work well for binary composites ( i.e. , tablets containing only two regions with different infill level or two different APIs), when the number of sub-regions is three or more, a stack geometry would no longer allow independent release from all regions since the top and the bottom layer would control the access of dissolution medium and diffusion of the API from the intermediate sandwiched layers. The pie geometry (or the combination of a 2-layer stack with a pie on each side) would therefore be required to enable independent release when three or more regions are required in the composite tablet.
CONCLUSIONS
A methodology for in silico design of tablet structure for 3D printing by FDM was proposed and demonstrated. The method is based on the solution of the inverse problem by the combination of pre-calculated structure-dissolution relationships obtained for simple structural motifs (in this case tablets containing a single infill level) into more complex structures that satisfy the condition of additive behaviour (in this case a pie or a 2-layer stack structure). Through methods of parametric programming, a three-dimensional mathematical model of tablet dissolution was formulated and validated for tablets with a single value of infill density. While the tablet geometry and initial drug content were given as inputs, the diffusion coefficient and the thickness of the diffusion boundary layer were adjusted for the simulation to quantitatively agree with experimental data. Although changing infill density (porosity) of the tablets by modifying their printing settings and the supplied 3D template has been shown to affect their dissolution rate, this trend is not linear. As observed also in other recent work ( ), the enhancement of dissolution by increasing the surface area through the introduction of porosity into the tablet is only possible if the pore size exceeds a certain threshold. The exact value of the threshold depends on the thickness of the diffusion boundary layer and in the case of swellable formulations, also on the degree of swelling of the tablet.
Amongst the most frequently mentioned potential advantages of 3D-printed drug forms is the possibility to incorporate multiple drugs with varying release profiles ( , , , ). In order to test the applicability of the method of adjusted dissolution for future tablets containing multiple drugs with varying release profiles, composite tablets with two different values of infill density were printed. The model was able to predict the dissolution kinetics of the composite pie-type tablets and the simulated release profiles agreed well with those measured experimentally by the physical dissolution of real 3D-printed composite tablets.
