Introduction
Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a serious chronic condition characterized by increased pulmonary artery pressures and eventually resulting in right heart failure and death. When the National Institute of Health (NIH) pulmonary hypertension registry was initiated in 1981, the average age at diagnosis was 36 years old with a median survival of 2.8 years. The average age at diagnosis of patients enrolled in the contemporary Registry to Evaluate Early and Long-term Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Disease Management (REVEAL) which began in 2006 was 53 years old and the median survival was 7 years. Also, REVEAL showed a higher female preponderance (78%; female:male ratio 3.6:1) than the one reported in the NIH registry (64%; female:male ratio 1.8:1). The historic perception that PH is a disease affecting predominantly young women at low risk of CAD is no longer always true. Indeed, as many as one in three patients with PH have concomitant coronary artery disease (CAD) and many others have risk factors for CAD.
The diagnosis of CAD in patients with PH is challenging due to overlapping symptoms of exertional dyspnea, chest pain, and fatigue. Furthermore, because of poor exertional capacity and deconditioning, patients are often severely limited in their ability to adequately perform exercise stress testing to evaluate for CAD. Because of this, pharmacological stress with non-invasive imaging for the diagnosis of CAD is often necessary. Regadenoson, a selective agonist of the adenosine A 2A receptor, has greatly simplified the stress testing process while also substantially reducing the rate of significant complications. However, because of the potential risk of bronchospasm and right ventricular decompensation with vasodilator stressors, especially adenosine and dipyridamole, and arrhythmias with dobutamine, many patients are referred directly to invasive coronary angiography despite a low to intermediate pre-test probability. In fact, the current 2015 ESC/ERS guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of PH make no recommendation for non-invasive stress testing, rather suggest coronary angiography in the presence of angina or multiple coronary risk factors for the diagnosis of CAD.
We sought to review the use of regadenoson in stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) at our institution in order to evaluate the tolerability and safety of this approach. We hypothesized that because regadenoson is a selective A 2A receptor agonist with little if any effect on the A 2B and A 3 receptors that it would be well tolerated without significant hemodynamic changes, severe symptoms, or adverse short-term outcomes.
Methods
We cross-referenced patients who underwent MPI at the University of Michigan Hospital between July 2008 and February 2016 with an institutional PH registry to retrospectively identify patients with pulmonary hypertension who underwent regadenoson stress with either single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET). In order to be included in the study, patients were required to be diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension by a right heart catheterization, defined as mean pulmonary artery pressure >25 mmHg. The diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension was confirmed by a PH expert. Consecutive patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (WHO group 1), pulmonary hypertension due to lung diseases/hypoxia (WHO group 3), chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (WHO group 4), and pulmonary hypertension of unclear etiologies (WHO group 5) were included. Patients who were considered to have a multifactorial etiology of their pulmonary hypertension were also included in the analysis. Exclusion criteria included patients with PH due to left heart disease (World Health Organization [WHO] group 2), defined as mean pulmonary artery pressure >25 mmHg and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure >15 mmHg, without evidence of other etiologies for PH.
Patient’s stress test information, demographic, hemodynamic, and clinical variables were collected from the stress testing records, nuclear lab databases, and the electronic medical record. Hemodynamic data from closest right heart catheterization to the date of the MPI were obtained from the electronic medical records. Echocardiographic data were obtained if a surface echocardiogram was performed within 6 months of the date the MPI was performed. A list of PH-specific medications was obtained from medical records if the patient was last seen by a PH specialist within 6 months of the date the MPI was performed. Patient’s immediate adverse events and hospital admission or emergency department visits within 1 month of the test being performed were collected. Electrocardiographic response was reviewed and recorded.
Requirement for informed consent was waived for this retrospective study by the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board.
Stress Testing Protocol
Patients were instructed to fast overnight and to abstain from caffeine and methylxanthines for 24 hours. After focused cardiovascular history and physical examination, a resting EKG and hemodynamics were obtained. Patients referred for SPECT MPI who were able to participate in low-level treadmill exercise were asked to walk on the treadmill at stage 0, 0.5, or 1 of the modified Bruce protocol (1.7 miles per hour at 0%, 5% or 10% grade, respectively) for a total of six minutes. After three minutes of low-level exercise, the patients were injected with 0.4 mg of regadenoson intravenously followed by a minimum of 10 ml of saline. Approximately 30 seconds afterwards, a weight-adjusted dose of Tc99m-sestamibi was injected intravenously. After a total of six minutes of treadmill exercise, all patients without contraindication were administered 75 mg of intravenous aminophylline. Patients referred for SPECT MPI who were unable to perform low-level treadmill exercise as well as all patients referred for PET MPI were injected with 0.4 mg of regadenoson while lying supine. After a minimum of 10 ml of saline flush, radiotracer (Tc99-sestamibi for SPECT and Rb-82 for PET) was injected intravenously. After a total of four minutes for SPECT MPI and 8 minutes for PET MPI, all patients without contraindications were routinely administered 75 mg of aminophylline intravenously to reverse the effects of regadenoson. The use of aminophylline during a regadenoson MPI is a routine practice at our institution. This medication was not administered in the presence of contraindications, such as a history of seizures or prior allergic reactions.
Statistical Analysis
Continuous variables were summarized as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Categorical variables were summarized as numbers and percentages. Continuous variables were analyzed with Student t test and Wilcoxon rank test when appropriate. Categorical variables were analyzed with Fisher exact test. A 2-sided p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed with Stata 14.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).
Results
Patient Population
We identified 67 consecutive patients with PH who underwent MPI with regadenoson stress. The mean age was 63.2 ± 10.9 years. Most patients had pulmonary arterial hypertension (n = 36, 53.7%), followed by multifactorial PH (n = 23, 34.3%) and PH due to lung disease/hypoxia (n = 7, 10.4%) (Table 1 ). PH due to unclear etiologies was uncommon (n = 1, 1.5%). There were no patients with chronic thromboembolic PH. The majority were females (n = 45, 67.2%) and obese (BMI 30.9 ± 10.9 kg/m 2 ). Most patients underwent a SPECT (n = 56, 83.6%) and of these, a minority had a combined exercise and pharmacological stress (n = 10, 14.9%). PET MPI with pharmacological stress was performed in 16.4% of patients (n = 11).

Patients were significantly symptomatic at baseline, with the vast majority (71.7%) suffering WHO functional class III/IV limitations. The mean 6-minute walk test was 286.9 ± 112 m. There was a high prevalence of comorbidities including hypertension (64.7%), obesity (56.7%), diabetes (30.9%), smoking (32.3%), family history of coronary artery disease (41.2%), and hyperlipidemia (47.1%). The most common PH medication used were phosphodiesterase inhibitors (48.2%), followed by endothelin receptor antagonists (23.2%) and prostacyclins (14.3%). PH combination therapy was used by 21.4% of the patients.
Invasive hemodynamic assessment demonstrated a substantial abnormality with mean pulmonary vascular resistance of 6.2 ± 4.0 Woods units and mean cardiac index of 2.7 ± 0.7 L/min/m 2 . Mean pulmonary artery pressure was 43.5 ± 12.4 mmHg, with 70.1% having mean pulmonary artery pressure >35 mmHg. The average time from RHC to MPI test was 364.5 ± 622.8 days. Transthoracic echocardiogram data performed within 6 months of the stress test were available in 51 patients and it revealed right ventricular enlargement and dysfunction in 64.7% (n = 33) and 49% (n = 25) of subjects, respectively. The mean estimated right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) was 64.3 ± 21.2 mmHg. Eleven echocardiograms (21.5%) did not have a reliable RVSP and were not reported.
Of the studies performed, the majority showed normal myocardial perfusion (73.1%, n = 49) and only a minority had evidence of ischemia (22.4%, n = 15) and/or scar (11.9%, n = 8). The average resting ejection fraction (EF) was 57.9 ± 11.7% and the stress EF was 65.2 ± 12.8%. The mean sum stress score was 4 ± 5.5. One study was discarded due to poor image quality.
Responses to Stress
The hemodynamic response to the administration of regadenoson (Table 2 ) was appropriate and is shown in Figure 1 A, B, and C. Overall, heart rate rose from 74.6 ± 14 bpm at baseline to 96.3 ± 18.3 bpm ( P < .001), the systolic blood pressure increased from 129.8 ± 20.9 mmHg at baseline to 131.8 ± 31 mmHg ( P = .67) and diastolic blood pressure decreased from 77.1 ± 11.4 mmHg at baseline to 72.9 ± 15.3 mmHg ( P = .02) after the administration of regadenoson. Both, patients who underwent a combined exercise and pharmacological protocol and those who did not, had a similar resting heart rate (78.6 ± 15.7 and 73.9 ± 13.7 bpm, respectively, P = .33), but those who exercised had a significantly higher post-infusion heart rate (114.6 ± 19.7 and 93.1 ± 16.2 bpm, respectively, P < .001). There was no difference in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure response between groups ( p NS for all). Aminophylline was routinely administered to 80.6% (n = 54) of patients. No patients required additional post-infusion medications such as beta blockers, nitrates, or inhalers.

Side effects related to regadenoson were common (Table 3 ). Dyspnea was the most common side effect and occurred in 70.6% of patients, followed by nausea (8.8%), chest pain (7.3%), headache (4.4%), dizziness (4.4%), flushing (4.4%), and fatigue (2.9%). No syncope or symptomatic hypotension requiring medical intervention occurred. Patients who exercised were more likely to experience fatigue compared to the patients who did not exercise ( P = .02) Table 3 Symptoms Symptoms Overall (N = 67) N (%) With exercise (N = 10) N (%) Without exercise (N = 57) N (%) P Chest pain 5 (7.3) 0 (0) 5 (8.8) .43 Dyspnea 48 (70.6) 7 (70) 41 (71.9) .58 Nausea 6 (8.8) 0 (0) 6 (10.5) .36 Headache 3 (4.4) 0 (0) 3 (5.3) .61 Dizziness 3 (4.4) 0 (0) 3 (5.3) .61 Fatigue 2 (2.9) 2 (20) 0 (0) .02 Flushing 3 (4.4) 0 (0) 3 (5.3) .61 Syncope 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 1
The stress electrocardiograms showed no potentially life-threatening arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or high degree atrioventricular block [2nd or 3rd degree]) (Table 4 ). Less serious arrhythmias were common: premature ventricular contractions occurred in 39.7% of patients, followed by premature atrial contractions in 10.3% and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) in 2.9%. There were no prolonged or sustained arrhythmias. No patients developed ST elevations of any degree or ST depressions greater than 2 mm. Most patients had a normal ST response (77.9%), followed by non-diagnostic electrocardiogram due to baseline abnormalities (10.3%), borderline ST depressions 0.5-0.9 mm (5.9%), and mild ST depressions 1-1.9 mm (4.4%). Patients who exercised were more likely to develop mild ( P = .05) ST depressions than those who did not exercise. There were no significant differences in the rates of arrhythmias or atrioventricular block between the two groups ( p NS for all).

We recognized that 7 patients (10.4%) had a decrease in systolic blood pressure <100 mmHg with a change >10 mmHg from baseline after the administration of regadenoson. These patients had a similar RA pressure (12.6 vs 11.6 mmHg, P = .66), mean PA pressure (42.3 vs 43.7 mmHg, P = .47), PCWP (14.6 vs 13.7 mmHg, P = .62), PVR (4.6 vs 6.4 WU, P = .28), and Fick cardiac index (2.5 vs 2.7 L/min/m 2 , P = .35) than those who did not have such a blood pressure response. Also, there was no significant difference between groups with respect to development of chest pain ( P = .43), dyspnea ( P = .65), nausea ( P = .5), dizziness ( P = .71), fatigue ( P = .2), or flushing ( P = .71). The use of phosphodiesterase inhibitors was not associated with a low blood pressure response ( P = .41). None of these patients required any medical intervention.
No immediate serious events occurred following the administration of regadenoson. Of the 67 patients that received regadenoson, 47 (70.1%) were performed on an outpatient basis and 20 (29.9%) while inpatient. Out of the 47 outpatient procedures, two (4.2%) were admitted to the hospital or visited the emergency department within 30 days of their procedure, both for reasons unrelated to their stress tests. One patient was hospitalized for a urinary tract infection and another patient due to persistent shortness of breath that was being evaluated as an outpatient at the time regadenoson stress testing.
Discussion
PH is a serious medical condition with symptoms similar to those found in CAD, and PH is increasingly diagnosed in middle-aged and older patients with traditional CAD risk factors. Recently, it has been suggested that PAH be divided into typical and atypical PAH based on the presence or absence of three or more traditional CAD risk factors. Out of concern for safety, both vasodilator and dobutamine stress testing have traditionally been avoided. While there is increasing recognition of CAD in patients with PH, the pre-test risk of CAD remains relatively low in many PH patients and invasive coronary angiography may not have a favorable risk-reward ratio. Further risk stratification becomes necessary in this patient population that comprised many patients who are unable to perform adequately an exercise stress test.
In our study, we did not observe any serious immediate or short-term adverse events related to the administration of regadenoson. Patients experienced a typical hemodynamic response which was consistent with previous studies. Common side effects related to the use of regadenoson were appreciated. Importantly, no patients developed prolonged arrhythmias and no syncope occurred. No patients required the administration of intravenous medications or bronchodilators during the MPI stress test. To our knowledge, this is the first study assessing the safety of regadenoson stress testing in patients with PH. It is important to remark that we routinely administrated aminophylline. Thus, the safety of regadenoson during MPI testing in patients with pulmonary hypertension without administration of this medication remains unclear.
There is little known about the safety and accuracy of pharmacologic stress testing in patients with PH. Dobutamine at lower doses than typically used for stress echocardiography has been used previously in the evaluation and diagnosis of patients with either proven or suspected pulmonary hypertension, though not specifically aimed at diagnosing coronary artery disease. , Nicol et al, showed that a comprehensive assessment of coronary arteries, LV and RV function, and pulmonary circulation by computed tomography (CT) is feasible in patients with diagnosed PAH. Unfortunately, this study included a low-risk population and the prevalence of CAD was low. Nonetheless, the high negative predictive value of CT coronary angiography may be of particular value in PH patients with low pre-test risk of CAD. There are several potential challenges to this technique in the PH population. First, difficulty with breath holding may pose a challenge, particularly when using older CT scanning equipment. Second, ventricular ectopy and elevated heart rates can lead to serious artifacts that may adversely affect image interpretation and diagnostic ability. Finally, the specificity of the hemodynamic significance of calcific or moderate coronary artery plaques may be challenging to assess, particularly in patients with intermediate pre-test risk of CAD.
Our study does have several limitations. The study is a single-center, retrospective review that may not represent the general PH population. However, PH remains a disease that is largely treated at tertiary academic centers by physicians with specialized training in the field. Additionally, there was a relatively low rate of confirmatory diagnostic coronary angiography in this population and as such our study was not capable of reliably estimating the accuracy of this modality.
Currently, there is no established recommendation for how to proceed with CAD assessment in patients with PH. Although the presence of PH is not a contraindication for exercise testing, many physicians feel uncomfortable with this approach and feel it is unlikely that these patients will reach target heart rate given their physical limitations. Recent PH guidelines suggest that in this patient population a coronary angiogram should be performed in the presence of angina or multiple coronary risk factors, although this recommendation is derived from expert opinion rather than clinical evidence. We have demonstrated that regadenoson stress MPI is feasible and well tolerated in these patients, and for properly selected individuals, may offer an alternative to invasive coronary angiography.
New Knowledge Gained
Little is known about the appropriate testing for assessment of coronary artery disease in patients with pulmonary hypertension. Based on our results, an MPI testing using regadenoson with routine administration of aminophylline is a safe alternative to coronary angiography in this patient population.
Conclusions
Regadenoson stress in patients with PH is safe and represents an alternative to invasive coronary angiography for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease in this population.
