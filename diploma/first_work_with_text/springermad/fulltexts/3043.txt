Introduction
Head and neck cancer (HNC) is the seventh most common cancer worldwide, with more than 600,000 patients diagnosed with HNC annually [ ]. HNC is associated with a high likelihood of second primary malignancies. The most common site for this type of cancer is an aerodigestive site, including the lungs and esophagus [ , ]. Epidemiological studies have suggested an increased risk for the development of HNC is associated with smoking and alcohol drinking habits; these risk factors overlap those related to such aerodigestive malignancies [ , ].
Patients with HNC have shown a high prevalence of esophageal squamous cell neoplasia (ESCN). Specifically, from 5% to 15% of patients with HNC ultimately develop synchronous or metachronous ESCN [ , , ]. A screening esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGDS) to conduct a tumor survey is routinely recommended for patients with HNC [ , , ].
Moreover, ESCN was found to have a significantly negative impact on the survival of HNC patients. Studies have shown the 3-year overall survival rate to be between 0% and 15% in HNC patients [ , , ]. However, recent advances in endoscopy have enabled the early detection of esophageal neoplasia [ ]. Therefore, in HNC patients today, the incidence of advanced ESCN may be lower and the present overall survival rate may have improved from those of past reports.
The objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence of ESCN and the impact on the overall survival rate of HNC patients in recent years. We retrospectively examined such questions using the medical data of the HNC patients who had undergone EGDS at our institute.
Patients and methods
Patients
We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of HCN patients who had undergone EGDS at our institute between October 2005 and September 2012. Patients were selected for this study according to the following criteria: i. At the time of an HCN diagnosis, patients underwent staging workups, including oral cavity inspection, endoscopic examination of the pharynx and larynx, computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging of the head and neck, and whole-body fluorodeoxyglucose–positron emission tomography. ii. For those patients with HCN who underwent EGDS, EGDS were performed with an upper gastrointestinal high-resolution magnifying endoscope (GIF-Q240Z, GIF-H260Z; Olympus Medical Systems, Tokyo, Japan). iii. After treatment for HCN, CT and EGDS were performed annually to check for the recurrence of disease and to survey for ESCN.
Study design
We analyzed the prevalence of ESCN in HNC patients, its association with patient baseline characteristics (sex, age, toxic habits such as smoking and alcohol drinking, location of HNC, staging of HNC, location of second primary malignancies, initial treatment for HNC), the difference in therapeutic outcomes of HNC patients with and without ESCN, and the prognostic value of the presence of ESCN in HNC patients.
The data of HNC patients with ESCN were divided into two groups, depending on whether patients had synchronous or metachronous ESCN. Synchronous ESCN was defined as developing at the same time, or within 6 months before and after a diagnosis of HNC. For development before and after 6 months, the ESCN was considered metachronous. In cases of HNC with multiple ESCNs, the ESCN stage was defined according to the most advanced lesion. Alcohol consumption was estimated as the average number of grams of pure ethanol ingested per drinking day. Smoking was calculated according to the Brinkman index (the number of cigarettes smoked per day multiplied by the number of total smoking years). The primary tumor was grouped by location (oral cavity, epipharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx, larynx). Tumor stage was classified according to TNM classification of the Union for International Cancer Control, 6th edition [ ].
Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were described by medians and ranges; categorical variables were described by counts and percentages. All patient data were compared based on whether patients had ESCN. Continuous variables were compared using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Categorical variables were compared with the chi-square test when appropriate; otherwise, a Fisher’s exact test was used. Cumulative incidences of overall survival of HNC patients, with or without ESCN, were calculated by the Kaplan–Meier method, with the date of the first EGDS at our institute as the starting point, and differences were assessed with the log-rank test. The prognostic factors that were shown to be significant in a univariate Cox regression analysis were also tested with a multivariate Cox regression analysis. We used the analysis to examine hazard ratio (HR) of the HNC patients, with the 95% confidence interval (CI). We conducted all statistical analyses using SPSS version 20 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). All statistical tests were two tailed, and significance was defined as p < 0.05. This study was approved by the institutional review board of Mie University Hospital.
Results
Baseline characteristics of patients with HNC
During the study period, a total of 226 patients fulfilled the eligibility criteria for this study (Table 1 ). Of the 226 patients, 194 (85.8%) were male; the median age was 68 years (range, 33–89 years). The median amount of daily alcohol intake was 22 g (range, 0–220 g) and the median Brinkman index was 606 (range, 0–2560). Considering the location of the HNC, 40 lesions (17.7%) were found in the oral cavity, 12 lesions (5.3%) in the epipharynx, 42 lesions (18.6%) in the oropharynx, 74 lesions (32.7%) in the hypopharynx, and 58 lesions (25.7%) in the larynx. Sixty-seven patients (29.6%) had localized disease (stage I, II), and 159 patients (70.4%) had locally advanced or metastatic disease (stage III, IV). Twenty-three patients (10.2%) had second primary malignancies other than ESCN (gastric cancer, lung cancer, colon cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and prostate cancer).

For HNC treatment, radiotherapy fields included the lesion; the daily fractional radiation dose was 2 gray (Gy), administered 5 days per week, for all patients. The standard total radiation dose for HNC was 70 Gy. Chemotherapy for HNC consisted of cisplatin only, 5-fluorouracil plus cisplatin, or S-1 only. One hundred and four patients (46.0%) had undergone chemoradiation therapy as initial treatment for HNC.
Comparison with characteristics of HNC patients with or without ESCN
There were 192 patients with HNC without ESCN (85.0%) and 34 patients with HNC and with ESCN (15.0%) (Table 1 ). Comparing the characteristics of HNC patients, the amount of alcohol intake (44 vs. 20 g, p = 0.007) and location of cancer in the hypopharynx (55.9% vs. 28.6%, p = 0.003) were significantly greater in patients with ESCN compared to those without ESCN. On the other hand, use of surgical treatment for HNC was significantly lower in patients with ESCN (14.7% vs. 35.0%, p = 0.030).
Characteristics of ESCN lesions
The characteristics of ESCN lesions are shown in Table 2 . Thirty-eight ESCNs were detected in 34 patients: 30 patients had 1 lesion, and 4 patients had 2 lesions each. Thirty-three synchronous and 5 metachronous ESCNs were diagnosed in this study. Of the 38 ESCN lesions, 31 (81.6%) were early ESCN (stage 0, I). These results demonstrated that ESCNs were likely to be an earlier-stage neoplasia than HNC.

Treatment characteristics for patients with ESCN
Treatments for HNC patients with ESCN are shown in Table 3 . Of 34 patients with ESCN, 10 patients (29.4%) underwent endoscopic resection for ESCN and 10 patients (29.4%) underwent simultaneous chemoradiation therapy. Radiotherapy fields for ESCN included the lesion. The daily fractional radiation dose was 2 Gy, administered 5 days per week to all patients. The standard total radiation dose for ESCN was 60 Gy. Chemotherapy for ESCN consisted of 5-fluorouracil plus cisplatin.

Impact of ESCN on survival outcome
To evaluate the actual magnitude of the impact of ESCN on survival, the overall survival of HNC patients with or without a prognostic factor [age: <68 years vs. ≥68 years; sex: female vs. male; Brinkman index: <1000 vs. ≥1000; amount of daily alcohol intake: <33 vs. ≥33 g; clinical stage: I, II vs. III, VI; hypopharyngeal cancer: absence vs. presence; ESCN: absence vs. presence; primary second malignancies except ESCN: absence vs. presence; initial treatment of HNC: local therapy (surgery, radiotherapy, other) vs. systemic therapy (chemotherapy and chemoradiation therapy); and chemoradiation therapy: absence vs. presence] was compared.
The median follow-up period was 29.8 months (range, 0–98.0 months). During the follow-up period, 17 (50.0%) of HNC patients with ESCN and 57 (29.7%) of HNC patients without ESCN died. Figure 1 shows the overall survival curves of HNC patients without or with ESCN. The median survival period for HNC patients without ESCN was not reached; that for those with ESCN was 45 months. The 3-year survival rates for HNC patients with or without ESCN were 53% and 70%, respectively. Kaplan–Meier curve analysis using a log-rank test showed that the presence of ESCN ( p = 0.029) was associated with a greater probability of a shorter overall survival period.

We conducted univariate and multivariate analyses using a Cox regression analysis with a time-dependent covariate (Table 4 ). This analysis also identified a more advanced clinical stage (HR = 2.15; 95% CI = 1.18–3.93; p = 0.012) and the presence of ESCN (HR = 1.73; 95% CI = 1.00–2.97; p = 0.049) as significant and independent determinants of the overall survival period.

Discussion
The high incidence of ESCN in HCN patients is illustrated by the concept of the “field cancerization” rule. Carcinogens such as tobacco and alcohol elevate the risk of epithelial cancer developing in the upper aerodigestive tract. In our study, however, the incidence of ESCN in HCN patients was at a higher rate than those of previous reports [ , ]. Reasons include the undertaking of routine EGDS in HNC patients as well as endoscopic advances that are increasing the detection rates. In particular, endoscopic advances, such as high-resolution endoscopy with magnification and narrow-band imaging system, may contribute to the earlier detection of lesions [ , ].
In our study, the 3-year survival rate of HNC patients with ESCN was more than 50%, which was an improvement compared to that in past reports [ , , ]. The contributing reasons include not only advances in anticancer therapies, such as new surgical and radiotherapy techniques as well as new anticancer drugs, but also the improved ability to detect earlier ESCN lesions. In fact, the early detection of ESCN in HCN patients is critical to improving the prognosis [ ]; most ESCNs in our study were detected at an early clinical stage.
The development of ESCN, however, remained one of the poor prognostic factors found for the overall survival rate among the HNC patients in our study. The reasons for this remain undetermined, but our data suggest several possibilities. First, the rate of hypopharyngeal cancer patients with ESCN was significantly higher than that of hypopharyngeal cancer patients without ESCN. In our study, hypopharyngeal cancer was not a significantly poorer prognostic factor associated with overall survival of HNC patients. The prognosis for patients with hypopharyngeal cancer, however, has been relatively poor among patients with head and neck cancers [ ]. Therefore, it may affect the overall survival of all patients with ESCN. Second, another possible explanation for the shorter survival period in ESCN patients is the adverse effect of simultaneous chemoradiation therapy (CRT). The efficacy and feasibility of simultaneous CRT for patients with HNC and ESCN have been reported [ , , , ]. Shinoto et al. showed that median survival was 19 months and that the 2-year survival rate was 44% in patients with synchronous HNC and esophageal tumors who received simultaneous CRT; therapy was found to be feasible and effective [ ]. Simultaneous CRT, however, increased the radiation field of the lung and the adverse effects, resulting in a reduced survival rate [ , ]. In our series, the majority of HNC patients with synchronous ESCN underwent simultaneous chemoradiation therapy. Of the HNC patients with synchronous ESCN, a definite CRT-related death was observed in a patient with radiation pneumonitis; moreover, the late complications of CRT were hidden as HNC-related deaths. In fact, ESCN patients who received simultaneous CRT tended to show a shorter overall survival period after analysis using a log-rank test in our study ( p = 0.10; data not shown).
The present study had several limitations. First, patients were enrolled in a single center. The findings reported here should be confirmed in a multicenter study. A second limitation was that the study design was retrospective: we relied on medical records for patient data. Furthermore, the choice of treatment regimen depended on the managing physicians. The foregoing factors would have contributed to biases in the present study.
In conclusion, ESCN is associated with a high incidence of HNC patients so that screening for EGDS is crucial for such patients. The presence of ESCN is one of the poor prognostic factors in HNC patients, possibly because of the presence of comorbid hypopharyngeal cancer and undergoing simultaneous CRT.
