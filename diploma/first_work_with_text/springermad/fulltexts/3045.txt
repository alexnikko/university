Introduction
Epithelial ovarian cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women in developed countries [ ], with 238,700 estimated new cases and 151,900 deaths in 2012 worldwide [ ]. Due to its asymptomatic nature in the early stages and the lack of effective screening tests, the majority of patients are frequently diagnosed at advanced stages of the disease [ ]. Despite recent advances in surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy, the majority of advanced-stage ovarian cancer patients died of disease progression with a 5-year overall survival rate of 39 and 17% at stages III and IV, respectively [ ]. The following prognostic factors in ovarian cancer patients have been identified as independent predictors for survival—histological subtypes, histological grade, clinical stage, size of residual tumor after initial surgery, completeness of surgical resection, and platinum-free interval. However, to date, there are limited predictors that can be used to estimate patient survival prior to the initiation of treatment.
Systemic leukocyte alterations have recently gained attention from physicians investigating cancer treatments [ ]. Leukocytosis, neutrophilia, monocytosis, and increased neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) have been reported to be associated with poor prognosis in patients with various solid cancers [ , , , , , , ].
Neutrophils, which exhibit antimicrobial functions, are the most abundant circulating leukocytes (approximately 60%) and are the first-line of defense at infection or inflammation sites. Recent findings suggest that a subgroup of neutrophils function as immunosuppressive cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and contribute to multiple cancer processes including tumor initiation, angiogenesis, invasion, and dissemination [ ]. In a recent investigation of the immunological TME based on gene expression and clinical outcome data from ~18,000 human tumors across 39 malignancies, Gentles et al. demonstrated that tumor-infiltrating neutrophils were the most significant predictor of shorter survival in patients with solid cancer [ ].
Regarding ovarian cancer, previous studies have investigated the prognostic significance of neutrophilia [ , ] and NLR [ , , , , , , , , , , , ], as shown in Table 1 . With regard to neutrophilia, two previous reports suggest that neutrophilia is not a prognostic indicator. With regard to NLR, conflicting results have been reported. Therefore, the significance of systemic leukocyte alterations remains to be elucidated.

In this study, we first investigated the prognostic significance of elevated neutrophil count and NLR in patients with FIGO stage I–IV ovarian cancer. We then compared the clinical utility between neutrophil count and NLR in predicting patient survival. Finally, we established a prognostic model using neutrophil count and NLR for predicting patient survival.
Materials and methods
Patients
Permission to proceed with data acquisition and analysis was obtained from the institutional review board of Osaka University Hospital. A list of patients who were diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer and treated at Osaka University Hospital between April 2007 and March 2016 was generated from our institutional registry, and the clinical data were analyzed.
Treatment and post-treatment follow-up
Patients were clinically staged according to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging criteria. The standard procedures for primary cytoreductive surgery consisted of total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, and pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy sampling. In cases with gross unresectable tumors in the peritoneal cavity, retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy was not performed. Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy consisted of paclitaxel (175 mg/m 2 ), and carboplatin (AUC 5) was initiated within 6 weeks of primary cytoreductive surgery when required. Patients with advanced-stage diseases who received platinum-based neo-adjuvant chemotherapy instead of primary cytoreductive surgery were also included in this study. Interval debulking surgery was performed whenever possible. The definition of optimal debulking surgery was ≤1 cm being the largest tumor burden remaining at the completion of cytoreduction. After the initial treatment, follow-up examinations were conducted by gynecological oncologists at regular intervals in an outpatient clinic.
Definition of neutrophilia and elevated NLR
During the period between the initial diagnosis and the initial treatment, all patients underwent at least two blood tests that included blood counts. The lowest neutrophil count obtained during these tests was used in this analysis. Pretreatment neutrophilia was defined as persistent neutrophil count ≥ 8,000/μl on at least two separate occasions based on previous studies [ ]. The NLR was defined as the absolute neutrophil count divided by the absolute lymphocyte count. An elevated NRL was defined as an NLR ≥4.0 based on previous studies [ ]. Patients with coexisting hematologic malignancies, severe hemorrhage, administration of corticosteroids or recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), or acute or chronic infection were excluded. No HIV-infected patient was included in the current study.
Statistical analysis
Continuous data were compared between the groups using Student’s t test, Wilcoxon rank-sum test or median test. Frequency counts and proportions were compared between groups using the chi-squared test or a two-tailed Fisher’s exact test. We performed univariate analysis by comparing the Kaplan–Meier curves for each subgroup with the log-rank test. Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from the date of the initial surgical procedure or chemotherapy to the date of the first physical or radiographic evidence of disease progression or death. Disease-specific survival (DSS) was defined as the time from the date of treatment to the date of cancer-related death. p values of <0.05 were considered to be significant. All analyses were performed using JMP ® software, version 11.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).
Results
Prognostic significance of neutrophil counts
The clinicopathological characteristics of the patients based on neutrophil count are shown in Table 2 . Of a total of 344 patients, 24 (7.0%) had neutrophil count ≥ 8,000/μl prior to the start of initial treatment. The patients with neutrophilia had significantly elevated CA125 compared with those without neutrophilia ( p = 0.0012). The patients with neutrophilia tended to be younger ( p = 0.059) and associated with a lower optimal surgery rate ( p = 0.064) than those without; however, the differences were statistically marginal. In univariate analysis, neutrophilia was found to be associated with significantly shorter PFS and DSS (Fig. 1 a (i) (ii); Tables 3 , 4 ). In multivariate analysis (Tables 3 , 4 ), in addition to advanced clinical stage and elevated CA125, neutrophilia was found to be an independent prognostic factor for PFS (HR 2.53; 95% CI 1.24–4.71; p = 0.0124) and DSS (HR 3.87; 95% CI 1.62–8.26; p = 0.0037).

When examined according to clinical stage, pretreatment neutrophilia was observed in 5.3 and 9.0% for stage I–II and stage III–IV ovarian cancer patients, respectively. In patients with stage I−II diseases, those with neutrophilia had significantly shorter PFS (Fig. 1 b (i), p = 0.0198) and DSS (Fig. 1 b (ii), p = 0.0072) than those without. Similarly, in patients with stage III−IV disease, patients with neutrophilia had significantly shorter PFS (Fig. 1 c (i), p < 0.0001) and DSS (Fig. 1 c (ii), p = 0.0016) than those without.
Prognostic significance of NLR
As shown in Table 2 , of a total of 344 patients, 142 (41.3%) had an NLR ≥4.0 prior to the start of initial treatment. The patients with an elevated NLR were significantly younger ( p = 0.0060) and presented at a more advanced clinical stage ( p < 0.0001). Furthermore, they had a higher incidence of lymph node metastasis ( p = 0.0131), higher frequency of positive peritoneal washing ( p < 0.0001), lower optimal surgery rate ( p = 0.0011) and higher elevated CA125 ( p < 0.0001) than those with non-elevated NLR. In univariate analysis, elevated NLR was found to be associated with significantly shorter PFS and DSS (Fig. 2 a (i) (ii); Tables 3 , 4 ). Moreover, the greater absolute value of NLR was associated with shorter survival (Supplemental Fig. 1). In multivariate analysis (Tables 3 , 4 ), in addition to advanced clinical stage and lower optimal surgery rate, an elevated NLR was found to be an independent prognostic factor for PFS (HR 1.58; 95% CI 1.06–2.37; p = 0.0241) and DSS (HR 2.01; 95% CI 1.22–3.37; p = 0.0061). Fig. 2 a Kaplan–Meier estimates of PFS and DSS based on pretreatment NLR. (i) PFS: patients with elevated NLR (≥4.0) had significantly shorter PFS than those with non-elevated NLR (<4.0) (log-rank, p < 0.0001). (ii) DSS: patients with elevated NLR (≥4.0) had significantly shorter DSS than those with non-elevated NLR (<4.0) (log-rank, p < 0.0001). b Kaplan–Meier estimates of PFS according to pretreatment NLR in stage I–II patients. (i) PFS: patients with elevated NLR (≥4.0) in stage I–II had similar PFS to those with non-elevated NLR (<4.0) (log-rank, p = 0.6953). (ii) DSS: patients with elevated NLR (≥4.0) in stage I–II had similar DSS to those with non-elevated NLR (<4.0) (log-rank, p = 0.7043). c Kaplan–Meier estimates of PFS based on pretreatment NLR in stage III–IV patients. (i) PFS: patients with elevated NLR (≥4.0) in stage III–IV had significantly shorter PFS than those with non-elevated NLR (<4.0) (log-rank, p = 0.0001). (ii) DSS: patients with elevated NLR (≥4.0) in stage III–IV had significantly shorter DSS than those with non-elevated NLR (<4.0) (log-rank, p = 0.0003). d Lymphocyte count based on NLR in ovarian cancer patients. Lymphocyte count was significantly lower in patients with elevated NLR than those without ( p < 0.0001)
When examined according to clinical stage, elevated NLR was observed in 29.6 and 55.5% for stage I–II and III–IV ovarian cancer patients, respectively. In patients with stage I−II disease, the PFS and DSS in patients with elevated NLR were similar to those observed in patients with non-elevated NLR (Fig. 2 b (i), p = 0.6953, Fig. 2 b (ii), p = 0.7043). In contrast, in patients with stage III–IV disease, those with elevated NLR had significantly shorter PFS (Fig. 2 c (i), p = 0.0001) and DSS (Fig. 2 c (ii), p = 0.0003) than those with non-elevated NLR.
To investigate the mechanism of elevated NLR, we examined the neutrophil count in ovarian cancer patients. As shown in Table 5 , among the patients with elevated NLR, neutrophilia was observed in 24 patients (16.9%), and the remaining 118 patients (83.1%) had neutrophil count < 8,000/μl. Next, we investigated lymphocyte counts based on the NLR (Fig. 2 d). Lymphocyte count in patients with elevated NLR was significantly lower than those observed in patients with non-elevated NLR (NLR <4 average 1548.06, NLR ≥4 average 992.62, p < 0.0001). These findings indicate that an increased NLR results from an increased neutrophil count and/or decreased lymphocyte count. Table 5 Association between neutrophil count and NLR in ovarian cancer patients NLR ≥4 NLR <4 Neutrophil count ≥8,000/μl n = 24 n = 0 Neutrophil count <8,000/μl n = 118 n = 202
Comparison of prognostic utility between neutrophil count and NLR
To compare clinical utility between neutrophil count and NLR in predicting patient survival, ROC curves were generated and compared [Fig. 3 a (i) (ii)]. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) values for predicting recurrence using neutrophil count and NLR were 0.6516 (95% CI 0.58–0.71) and 0.7011 (95% CI 0.63–0.76), respectively. The AUC values for predicting DSS using neutrophil count and NLR were 0.6379 (95% CI 0.55–0.72) and 0.7249 (95% CI 0.65–0.79), respectively. The NLR tended to have greater AUC values than the neutrophil count in predicting recurrence ( p = 0.0546) and had significantly greater AUC values in predicting DSS ( p = 0.0182). Fig. 3 a ROC curves for recurrence and DSS. (i) ROC curves for recurrence in two years comparing neutrophil count and NLR (NLR: AUC 0.7011 cut-off 3.47236; neutrophil: AUC 0.6516 cut-off 4004.00, p = 0.0546). (ii) ROC curves for DSS in two years comparing neutrophil count and NLR (NLR: AUC 0.7249 cut-off 3.63317; neutrophil: AUC 0.6379 cut-off 6501.70, p = 0.0182). b Kaplan–Meier estimates of PFS and DSS based on pretreatment neutrophil counts and NLR in high-risk, intermediate-risk, and low-risk groups. (i) PFS: patients in the high-risk group had significantly lower PFS rates than those in the intermediate-risk group (log-rank, p = 0.0279). Moreover, patients in the intermediate-risk group had significantly lower PFS rates than those in the low-risk group (log-rank, p < 0.0001). (ii) DSS: patients in the intermediate-risk group had significantly lower DSS rates than those in the low-risk group (log-rank, p < 0.0001). Patients in the high-risk group had lower DSS rates than those in the intermediate-risk group. However, this difference was not significant (log-rank, p = 0.1660)
Survival estimation using neutrophil count and NLR
To establish a prognostic model for the prediction of survival in ovarian cancer patients, PFS and DSS were first assessed according to the neutrophil count and NLR. Based on the results from Table 5 and the associated survival analyses, we divided the patients into 3 groups—high-risk group (patients with neutrophilia and elevated NLR), intermediate-risk group (patients with elevated NLR without neutrophilia), and low-risk group (patients with non-elevated NLR). The PFS and DSS rates of the patients in the intermediate-risk group were significantly lower than those in the low-risk group (Fig. 3 b (i), p < 0.0001, (ii), p < 0.0001). Although the patients in the high-risk group had significantly lower PFS rates than those in the intermediate-risk group (Fig. 3 b (i), p = 0.0279), the differences in DSS were not significant (Fig. 3 b (ii), p = 0.1660).
Discussion
In this study, we showed, for the first time, that an elevated neutrophil count (≥8,000/μl) was an independent prognostic factor for shorter PFS and DSS in ovarian cancer patients. Among our study population, 7.0% of the patients had elevated neutrophil count (≥8,000/μl). As shown in Table 1 , neutrophilia has not been identified as an independent prognostic factor in previous studies [ , ], but it may have been due to the relatively small number of patients compared with this study. However, our findings need to be further verified in a prospective setting. In addition, we showed that an elevated NLR (≥4.0) was observed in 41.3% of patients and was independently associated with shorter PFS and DSS in ovarian cancer patients. An association between NLR and malignancy was first described in 2005 [ ]. Since then, to our knowledge, 12 studies have investigated the prognostic implications of elevated NLR in ovarian cancer patients [ , , , , , , , , , , , , Table 1 ]. Of these, 4 denied and 8 supported the prognostic significance of elevated NLR. Studies involving >300 patients (including ours) suggest that an elevated NLR is independently associated with patient survival. Furthermore, when examined according to clinical stages, the presence of neutrophilia or elevated NLR is more significant in advanced-stage than in early-stage ovarian cancer patients. Therefore, we believe that an elevated NLR is an important prognostic indicator in ovarian cancer patients, especially those with advanced-stage diseases.
To our knowledge, the significance of neutrophil count and NLR as prognostic indicators has not been compared. In this study, ROC analysis showed that the NLR is significantly superior to neutrophil count in predicting patient survival. This finding may be clinically important since it indicates that the NLR should be preferentially examined in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer.
The findings obtained in this study could have other valuable clinical implications. By performing low-cost peripheral blood examinations, physicians may be able to identify high-risk patients. As shown in Table 5 , we found that patients can be divided into the following 3 prognostic groups based on neutrophil counts and NLR—high-risk group (elevated NLR with neutrophilia), intermediate-risk group (elevated NLR without neutrophilia), and low-risk group (non-elevated NLR). This simple prognostic model offers individualized survival estimates and may enable physicians to provide more frequent follow-up for patients in the intermediate- or high-risk groups.
Considering the poor prognosis of ovarian cancer patients who have neutrophilia or elevated NLR, a detailed understanding of the mechanisms of neutrophilia and elevated NLR in ovarian cancer as well as the development of novel treatments are necessary. In this study, we showed that only 16.9% of patients with elevated NLR had neutrophilia (Table 5 ). Moreover, we found that lymphocyte count was significantly lower in patients with elevated NLR (Fig. 2 d, p < 0.0001). These results indicate that decreased lymphocyte count as well as increased neutrophil count is responsible for elevated NLR. Peripheral lymphocyte count can also be a predictor of survival in ovarian cancer patients [ ]. Furthermore, the presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes is a positive predictor for overall survival [ , ]. Although the mechanism for decreased lymphocyte count in patients with elevated NLR remains unclear, low lymphocyte count may be a possible explanation for the aggressiveness of ovarian cancers with neutrophilia or elevated NLR. Currently, the underlying mechanisms responsible for increased neutrophil production in ovarian cancer and the subsequent increase in the aggressiveness of the disease also remain poorly understood. However, in a previous study of uterine cervical cancer, we demonstrated that tumor-derived G-CSF is responsible for the development of neutrophilia [ ]. Treatments targeting granulopoiesis-stimulating cytokines or growth factors, their receptors, or their downstream effectors may have therapeutic efficacy in ovarian cancer patients with neutrophilia or elevated NLR. To develop novel treatments, further mechanistic investigations are necessary.
The limitations of our study need to be addressed. First, this study was conducted at a single institution. Second, this is a retrospective study. We intend to verify our clinical findings in collaborative multi-institutional studies in a prospective setting.
In conclusion, we showed that the presence of neutrophilia and elevated NLR at the time of initial diagnosis is a predictor for shorter survival in ovarian cancer patients. Our results show that the NLR was superior to neutrophil count in predicting the survival of ovarian cancer patients. Furthermore, our prognostic model, which is based on neutrophil count and NLR, may provide individualized survival estimates.
