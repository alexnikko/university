CTCF as a master weaver of the genome
CTCF protein was discovered by Victor Lobanenkov in the mid-1980 s when the sequences for chicken and human c-MYC promoters became available. The promoters had no apparent homology, yet were regulated in a similar manner. At that time, authors suggested that there should be a protein capable of recognizing different sequences but resulting in similar functional outcomes following binding to the promoters of genes that are regulated in a similar fashion. Later, this theory lead to the cloning of both chicken and human CTCF—an 11 zinc finger (ZF) transcription factor [ , ]. CTCF is reported to exist in genomes from worms and insects to higher mammals including humans [ ]. Moreover, this factor is highly conserved. Drosophila CTCF is capable of recognizing some human sequences and vice versa [ ], and the degree of conservation between chicken and human CTCF reaches 95% identity at the amino acid level despite the fact that the proteins are over 700 amino acids long with over three hundred million years of evolution separating those species. The high degree of conservation essentially means that any conserved amino acid change is deadly for either the animal or its progeny, and indicates the functional importance of the factor in evolution. There are many published functions of CTCF including transcriptional activation and repression, a component of enhancers and silencers, reader of imprinting marks, regulator of X chromosome inactivation in females, and others (for review see [ , , , , , , , , , , ]). Most CTCF functions can be linked to its ability to form sequence-specific loops of DNA [ ].
There are several properties of CTCF published long ago that have not been fully appreciated. First, overexpression of CTCF in any dividing cell line results in freezing of this cell line at all stages of cell cycle at once [ ]. Cells pause for 3–4 days without a single cell division (as shown by CFSE) yet the cell cycle distribution by FACS corresponds to that of logarithmic cell culture growth. This study directly implicates CTCF in the regulation of cell proliferation. Second, down-regulation of CTCF induces apoptosis in the many models studied. This is not really common knowledge despite many more recent publications detailing CTCF knockouts in specific mouse tissues leading to disappearance of the tissue following disappearance of the protein [ , ]. Of note, many papers stating that down-regulation of CTCF results in specific effects on one locus but not others should be treated with caution as most likely these studies reflect manifestations of early or later stages of apoptosis.
CTCF and cancer
When one looks at functions of CTCF and aberrant events frequently identified in cancer one finds almost perfect overlap. Some observations common between CTCF function and cancer include: transcriptional activation of genes that are not expected to be activated in the tissue (telomerase, c-MYC, PLK, PIM and many others including cancer–testis genes); transcriptional repression of p53, p14ARF, p16INK4a and others [ , , ]; change of enhancers and/or silencers [ ]; loss of imprinting (LOI) meaning that imprinted genes become expressed independently of parental alleles [ , ]; and deregulation of X chromosome inactivation in females [ ]. DNA loops and structural organization of the genome also undergo dramatic change upon malignant transformation, suggesting heavy interference with normal CTCF function(s) [ , ]. CTCF in humans is located on the smallest region of overlap on chromosome 16q22 that is frequently deleted (creating loss of heterozygosity—LOH) in many human cancers of various origin, including breast, lung, colon, prostate, ovarian and others [ ]. Interestingly, four missense mutations have been identified in breast, prostate and Wilms’ tumors in the DNA-binding domain of CTCF that alters the spectrum of binding specificities of CTCF of the remaining allele, resulting in loss of binding to some cancer-specific targets but preserving binding to boundary elements or other loci not involved in proliferation [ ].
However, the overall frequency of mutations in the residual allele after LOH appears to be low (4 out of 64 primary tumors analyzed). Recent accumulations of sequences of cancer exomes data (COSMOS dataset) showed many more mutations in CTCF exons including both missense and nonsense. Nonsense mutations are likely a reflection of LOH without chromosomal aberrations and are rather frequent making LOH of CTCF a significant trait in many cancers, while missense mutations required detailed analysis of their contribution to malignant phenotype. Therefore, I believe that the frequency and amount of mutations in CTCF are insufficient to explain gross aberrations of CTCF function(s) in cancer. It looks like there is an interference of a dominant-negative mutant of CTCF activated in cancer cells. And this appears, indeed, to be the case as shown below.
CTCFL/BORIS as a testis-specific evolutionary duplication of CTCF
In 2002, we reported on the isolation and cloning of a paralogue of CTCF, BORIS (acronym for Brother of the Regulator of Imprinted Sites) [ ] frequently known as CTCFL/BORIS. This gene appeared in evolution much later than CTCF, probably in fish as a gene duplication. In reptiles, CTCFL/BORIS existed as pseudogene that likely does not produce a protein. CTCFL/BORIS was lost in birds, but became a germ cell-specific gene in mammals [ ]. The paralogous gene largely maintained the DNA-binding domain of CTCF, including all splice sites, while acquiring completely different coding regions for the N and C termini. Normal function of CTCFL/BORIS was studied using knockout mice. Female CTCFL/BORIS−/− mice have no obvious phenotypes. Male CTCFL/BORIS−/− mice showed some subfertility, but otherwise appeared normal. Detailed analysis of the testis of CTCFL/BORIS-deficient animals revealed specific spermatogenesis defects including a decrease in the amount of haploid cells and increased apoptosis of germ cells that resulted in a 25% reduction in testis weight [ , ]. Moreover, there are additional abnormalities in the testis of CTCFL/BORIS−/− males. They include (1) frequently detected large multinuclear cells suggesting deregulated meiosis, and (2) frequently occurring abnormal XY synapsis—about 20%, visualized through aggregation of synaptonemal complex protein SCP3 that does not coincide with gamma-H2AX [ ]. This phenotype, in addition to direct deregulation of several genes where CTCFL/BORIS is involved as a transcriptional factor, demonstrated that CTCFL/BORIS participates in the regulation of complex processes such as meiosis. Our current hypothesis of normal CTCFL/BORIS function is epigenetic surveillance of normal spermatogenesis. Fertility of CTCFL/BORIS−/− males is likely achieved through the existence of meiotic checkpoints that eliminate germ cells with epigenetic defects during spermatogenesis.
CTCFL/BORIS is frequently activated in a variety of histologically unrelated human cancers
Expression of CTCFL/BORIS in normal human and mouse tissues is strictly restricted to male and female germ cells. Although some publications suggest otherwise [ , ], no confirmation of those claims can be found in deep Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) of a variety of tissues and cells from multiple individuals. Previously, when microarrays were the main tool for global expression analysis, the Affymetrix array had two probes in the CTCFL/BORIS gene, one of which was located in the part of human CTCFL/BORIS gene containing HMGL1 exon. Due to a very high homology of CTCFL/BORIS to HMG1, many normal tissues or cells expressing high levels of HMG1 registered as positive with that probe and were thus erroneously considered positive for CTCFL/BORIS. With NGS, that possibility was eliminated, and indeed, normal CTCFL/BORIS expression was confirmed to be restricted to the germ line. Figure 1 shows CTCFL/BORIS expression data from NCBI, the Human Protein Atlas, the genotype tissue expression dataset and the Fantome 5 dataset as well as antibody staining data from the Human Protein Atlas. These different sources uniformly detect CTCFL/BORIS only in testis. The data in each panel are based on a substantial sample sizes ranging from 87 tissue samples for the Fantome 5 dataset to 5798 samples for the GTEx dataset with the other datasets in between. Moreover, independent knockout studies from two different laboratories found no defects associated with CTCFL/BORIS deficiency other than those found in testis [ , ]. Inducible overexpression experiments in different tissues showed massive cell death, most likely due to the competition with CTCF [ ]. These extensive datasets confirm our initial finding that expression of normal CTCFL/BORIS is not found outside of a subset of germ cells [ , ].

Note that a and c show data in reads per kilobase of transcripts per million of mapped reads (RPKM) while b data are shown in transcripts per million (TPM). d RNA CAGEs, essentially transcription start sites showing only capped RNA. e Antibody staining data
We, and others, published several papers on aberrant CTCFL/BORIS expression in multiple cancers [ , , ] (reviewed in [ ]). The majority of those papers utilized RT-PCR or quantitative RT-PCR (Q-PCR). Due to the lack of a unified PCR tool for CTCFL/BORIS detection in cancers, it was difficult to compare data between labs because different labs used different sets of primers for CTCFL/BORIS mRNA. Interestingly, the human CTCFL/BORIS gene is located at chromosome 20q21, known in cancer cytogenetics as a region frequently amplified in cancers. This is circumstantial evidence that CTCFL/BORIS coincides with a locus frequently amplified in many cancers, in contrast to the CTCF locus on 16q22, which is a hot spot for frequent LOH. A conclusion to be drawn from the cytogenetic evidence is that CTCFL/BORIS copy numbers in cancers tend to be higher than CTCF copy number, which potentially creates some benefits in cell proliferation. The collection of “BIG DATA” on primary cancers can reconcile the problem of CTCFL/BORIS detection using different sets of primers. Next Generation RNA-seq analysis from different primary tumors allowed us to standardize CTCFL/BORIS expression in RPKM units—reads per kilobase of transcripts per million of mapped reads. This analysis revealed a very high frequency of CTCFL/BORIS expression in multiple cancers of various histological origins. In Table 1 , the frequency of CTCFL/BORIS expression in 19 unrelated types of cancers is compared to the frequency of expression of PRAME and MAGE-A6. Interestingly, PRAME is under direct control of CTCFL/BORIS, yet the frequency of PRAME expression is much lower than for CTCFL/BORIS, suggesting other layer(s) of regulation.

The overall conclusion to be drawn from this table is that in almost all cancer types, CTCFL/BORIS expression is found in close to or exceeding 90% of the samples (with exception of GBM). That is the threshold of biological error, meaning that it appears as a likely candidate for interference with CTCF function in cancers. These statistics are sufficient to conclude that CTCFL/BORIS is expressed more or less uniformly in cancers of various histological origins. Moreover, I think that aberrant CTCFL/BORIS expression could be a primary cause of cancer. To support this statement, a CTCFL/BORIS knockout mouse colony maintained over 12 years did not yield a single case of cancer while the control wild-type colony showed a roughly 10% cancer incidence (unpublished observations). Finally, I should mention that in our lab we tested most, if not all, commercially available anti-CTCFL/BORIS monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies for detection of this protein in both primary cancer cells as well as cancer cell lines and did not find one reliable candidate for immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence assays. We generated nine monoclonal antibodies suitable for chromatin immunoprecipitation but only one of nine gave reasonable immunostaining in testis. However, some discordance in staining with this antibody and RT-PCR and/or Q-PCR was observed, making it difficult to accept this as a diagnostic tool.
CTCFL/BORIS gene is expressed as multiple isoforms
In addition to the problems described above, Mother Nature created the CTCFL/BORIS gene in multiple isoforms. We identified 23 alternatively spliced mRNAs resulting in 17 different protein products [ ]. This list is not comprehensive as cloning was discontinued, hoping to focus studies on the normal functions of isoforms as well as their functions in cancer development. Unfortunately, to date we do not have any strong scientific data about the function of any isoform other than the original one published in 2002 [ ]. A major roadblock has been the lack of tools to study specific isoform binding to chromatin. We grouped isoforms into six subfamilies based on their alternatively spliced C termini [ ]. All subfamilies are expressed during normal gametogenesis and are also expressed in multiple cancers. We analyzed RNA from the NCI-60 set of cell lines, which represent a wide spectrum of human cancers and found that all subfamilies are expressed at significantly higher levels in these cancer cell lines when measured by quantitative PCR compared to RNAs from the corresponding normal control cells [ ]. There is huge variability in isoform expression among the NCI-60 cell lines. There are few cell lines expressing very high levels of what we have termed subfamily one [ ]. Usually, those cell lines contain very little of any other subfamily. Conversely, in cell lines where only traces of subfamily one are detected, the other subfamilies are relatively abundant.
In sum, CTCFL/BORIS is a gene expressed in multiple isoforms that are divided into six subfamilies based on their C termini; the function(s) of each isoform or subfamily is not known, but they are expressed both in normal gametogenesis and aberrantly in various cancers.
CTCFL/BORIS occupancy in the genome during normal spermatogenesis and in cancer
CTCFL/BORIS binding in the genome has been studied in great detail in several cancer cell lines that express this molecule abundantly. CTCFL/BORIS occupancy was determined using Chromatin Immuno-Precipitation (ChIP) followed by deep sequencing of precipitated DNA (ChIP-seq approach). 35–45 thousand binding sites per haploid genome (excluding repeats) were mapped depending on the cell line. CTCFL/BORIS mainly binds to promoters and enhancers of many genes, although intra- and inter-genic binding can be detected [ ]. Ingenuity pathway and other analytic platforms used to evaluate pathway involvement invariably show “Cancer” as a first hit for genes containing CTCFL/BORIS peaks in their promoters, strongly suggesting CTCFL/BORIS involvement in carcinogenesis.
Indeed, we confirmed that CTCFL/BORIS occupied the promoters of c-MYC, hTERT, p53, INK/ARF, MDM2, PLK, PIM and many, many other cancer-related genes, implicating its involvement in the deregulation of those genes during malignant transformation (Fig. 2 a, b) [ ]. CTCFL/BORIS is also involved in the activation of multiple cancer–testis genes, including PRAME, MAGEA1, MAGEA3, NY-ESO and others. In the human myeloid leukemia cell line, K562, about 50% of known cancer–testis gene promoters are occupied by CTCFL/BORIS [ ].
Fig. 2 a In normal cells, CTCF, depicted as a red circle, is an activator of p53, p14 ARF, p16Ink and other tumor suppressor genes which respond to signals from neighboring cells to stop growth. However, in cancer, CTCF is substituted by CTCFL/BORIS, depicted as a blue circle, shutting down the transcription of these tumor suppressor genes through activation of anti-sense transcripts. The direction of active transcription is shown with a red arrow, and the direction of inactive transcription is shown with a black arrow. Without activation of tumor suppressor genes, cells can grow out of control and become cancerous. b Same color code as in a . In normal cells, CTCF is a suppressor of c-MYC, hTERT, PIM1 and other oncogenes. However, in cancer cells, CTCFL/BORIS may replace CTCF and activate these genes. In these conditions, cells can grow out of control and become cancerous
Interestingly, CTCFL/BORIS sits not only on promoters of genes involved in malignant transformation, but also on promoters of genes involved in interactions of cancer cells with the immune system. For instance, a strong CTCFL/BORIS peak is present on the promoter of CD47, referred to as the “don’t eat me” locus, as well as on the PDL-1, but not the PDL-2 gene, located next to CD47 on the p-shoulder of chromosome nine. This may suggest a mechanism the tumor may employ to escape immune surveillance. Finally, we have recently shown that CTCFL/BORIS binds selected types of repeats including the “SINE, VNTR, ALU” (SVA) family of complex repeats [ ] that are capable of transposition in the genome. It remains to be determined if binding of CTCFL/BORIS facilitates transposition, which requires DNA double strands, breaks and thus may contribute to genomic instability, another hallmark of cancer.
Our attempts to knock out CTCFL/BORIS from K562 and several other cancer cell lines resulted, to our surprise, in an inability to obtain any stable clone without a wild-type CTCFL/BORIS allele. We have used a custom designed Zn-finger nuclease to mutate the first coding exon of CTCFL/BORIS [ ]. Downstream analyses showed a high efficiency in RNA transfection and in modifying the CTCFL/BORIS genomic sequence; however, analyses of clones always revealed a remaining wild-type allele [ ]. Moreover, when we selected a clone with severely down-regulated CTCFL/BORIS with a single non-mutant CTCFL/BORIS allele and tried to mutate that remaining allele, we were still unable to recover any clones with both alleles affected [ ]. Those experiments suggested that similar to the so-called “oncogene addiction”, CTCFL/BORIS-expressing cells likely cannot survive a complete loss of CTCFL/BORIS. This observation puts CTCFL/BORIS in a special place among cancer–testis genes as a target for immunotherapy because the tumor will not be able to completely shut down CTCFL/BORIS expression to evade attack from the immune system.
Knowledge of CTCFL/BORIS expression during normal human spermatogenesis has been limited due to the difficulties in obtaining fresh human testis (tissues must be less than 2 h from surgery or post mortem). Mouse tissues are available but no reliable anti-mouse CTCFL/BORIS antibodies are commercially available. However, even the results we were able to obtain using both mouse and human testis suggest that in cancer, CTCFL/BORIS tends to recapitulate the occupancies identified during normal spermatogenesis [ ].
In summary, CTCFL/BORIS, when aberrantly expressed in somatic cells, functions in much the same way it does during spermatogenesis: bind the promoters and enhancers needed for early embryogenesis and simultaneously enter asymmetric cell division producing spermatogonia A, thereby maintaining the stem cell phenotype, and spermatogonia B, affording entry into the actual spermatogenesis process to undergo meiosis resulting in haploid spermatids further converting to sperm. However, the environment of the somatic cell does not resemble that of spermatogonia A. The somatic cell has a specialized transcription program that conflicts with the germ cell development program. This conflict usually ends in apoptosis of the somatic cell expressing CTCFL/BORIS. In rare instances, however, a CTCFL/BORIS-expressing somatic cell will survive, leading to hierarchical differentiation of its specialized somatic cell program with interference from the germ cell development program. In different cancers, scientists frequently observed not only expression of germ cell-specific genes, but also genes involved in embryonic development, where BORIS participates in marking their promoters for CTCF occupancy for future embryonic development [ ]. This also provides an explanation for the lack of mammalian-like cancers in birds as they do not have the CTCFL/BORIS gene to aberrantly activate, and why we have not observed cancers in our CTCFL/BORIS knockout colony (unpublished observation). If CTCFL/BORIS is indeed an essential part of cancer development and its expression is restricted to only a subset of germ cells, it stands out as a very attractive target for immunotherapy.
CTCFL/BORIS is expressed in cancer stem cells
In many instances, CTCFL/BORIS expression in cancer cell lines and primary cancers is not readily detectable by RT-PCR or Q-PCR. A primary mean of tumor evasion from immune surveillance is target gene shutdown, correlating with low level expression of the target antigen. That is not the case for CTCFL/BORIS is shown in Table 1 . The very high frequency of CTCFL/BORIS expression in a variety of human primary tumors contradicts the notion that CTCFL/BORIS is irrelevant for cancer therapy. In contrast, CTCFL/BORIS is likely essential for tumor growth and it is difficult, or even impossible, to knock out CTCFL/BORIS in tumor cells. We attempted to do this by gene editing but failed in more than one cell line—at least one wild-type CTCFL/BORIS allele was always present in growing clones ([ ] and data not published). Moreover, low and even very low but persistent expression may indicate that expression is linked to cancer stem cells. As researchers began to appreciate the heterogeneity of cancers, a cancer stem cell concept was formulated and has become generally accepted among the scientific community [ , , ]. It is not the goal of this review to discuss the “pros” and “cons” of the cancer stem cell theory, but rather to provide facts and references that help us understand the role of CTCFL/BORIS in this regard.
In 2014, it was reported that CTCFL/BORIS is expressed only in a sub-population of the embryonic cancer cell lines, NCCIT and OVCAR3 [ ]. Experimental results showed that CTCFL/BORIS-positive cells, identified by fluorescent beacons, correlated with higher expression of hTERT and the embryonic stem cell markers, OCT4, SOX2 , and NANOG , as well as cancer stem cell markers CD44 and ALDH1 [ ]. That correlation strongly supports the hypothesis that CTCFL/BORIS can indeed be a marker of cancer stem cells. A year later, the same authors demonstrated that CTCFL/BORIS-positive cells are enriched in sub-populations of cell lines from breast, colon and cervical cancer. The authors studied Hoechst dye-excluding “side populations” and cells capable of sphere formation of several epithelial cancer cell lines and found CTCFL/BORIS-positive cells present in those cancer stem cell-enriched fractions. Importantly, down-regulation of CTCFL/BORIS in the “cancer stem cell” sub-populations changed the “stem cell”-like phenotype toward that of “non-stem cell”-like. Upon CTCFL/BORIS down-regulation in the cancer stem cell sub-population, down-regulation of hTERT as well as down-regulation in stem cell marker genes OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, ABCG2, CD44, ALDH1 and BMI1 was observed. Of note, CTCFL/BORIS up-regulation led to up-regulation of those genes. Moreover, down-regulation of CTCFL/BORIS diminished the ability of breast and colon cell lines to form spheres [ ]. Interestingly, CTCFL/BORIS down-regulation in non-invasive breast carcinoma MCF7 showed a different phenotype. Those cells went through an epithelial–mesenchymal transition following CTCFL/BORIS silencing, suggesting the importance of tumor origin on the outcome of changes in the level of CTCFL/BORIS expression [ ]. The above data suggest that CTCFL/BORIS is likely to be not only a marker but also a driving force of a “cancer stemness” phenotype. Other groups have independently confirmed the expression of CTCFL/BORIS in a small population of cancer stem cells. Asano et al. [ ] studied CTCFL/BORIS isoforms in isolated cervical CSC (aka cancer initiating cells) and remaining cells from the same culture and found that CTCFL/BORIS isoforms distributed unevenly in those fractions. Using RT-PCR, subfamily six was found exclusively in CSC while subfamilies 1 and 4 were found either in CSC or non-CSC, and subfamilies 2, 3, 4, and 5 were detected only in non-CSC. Additionally, the authors used a peptide from the C terminus of subfamily six isoforms that is restricted to HLA-2A to induce CTL clones and checked these CTL for their activity against CSC. CTLs were able to kill this sub-fraction and inhibit sphere formation [ ], suggesting that these cytotoxic cells were specific to CTCFL/BORIS. These data support our previous results in which we showed that CTL against appropriate peptides recognizing H1b and H2d mouse MHC class II is capable of killing suitable tumor target cells [ ]. Thus, a personalized vaccine which can induce CTL against any appropriate CTCFL/BORIS peptide might have a great therapeutic potential against cervical and other cancers. The same group published similar results for lung cancer [ ], suggesting that this approach is not cancer type-specific. Another independent paper reported that down-regulation of CTCFL/BORIS induced mesenchymal to epithelial transition in a neuroblastoma cell line with amplified N-MYC, confirming the role of CTCFL/BORIS in maintenance of stemness in those cells [ ].
The lack of detectable CTCFL/BORIS in the rat breast carcinoma model, 13762, from cultured cells and from tumor tissue was confirmed. Only heavy enrichment of Hoechst-negative 13762 cells allowed detection of rat CTCFL/BORIS expression, while no expression was observed in the non-CSC population (see below and manuscript in preparation).
Taken together, this expanding accumulation of evidence that CTCFL/BORIS is not only a marker of CSC but also a functionally integral part of maintaining the CSC phenotype strongly supports the value of CTCFL/BORIS as a target for immunotherapy of cancer.
CTCFL/BORIS proved to be an attractive target for cancer immunotherapy in two rodent models
Two rodent models, mouse 4T1 breast carcinoma and rat 13762 breast carcinoma were used to prove that CTCFL/BORIS is a good target for the immunotherapy of breast cancer.
With respect to vaccine formulation, the N and C termini of CTCFL/BORIS fused through a flexible linker was selected. The rationale behind this formulation was that both N and C termini fold independently when the Zn-finger domain is present, so a flexible linker should allow independent folding of the two domains. Moreover, this vaccine formulation should alleviate the safety concern that CTCFL/BORIS can transform NIH3T3 fibroblasts [ ]: a vaccine formulation without the DNA-binding domain should be safe with respect to the inability of the vaccine to transform cells responsible for the presentation of CTCFL/BORIS to the immune system. The immunogenicity of CTCFL/BORIS has been shown using preventive vaccination with subsequent challenge with the mouse breast carcinoma, 4T1. This tumor can be propagated in BALB/c mice, which makes it a demanding model for TH1/CTL induction, as this mouse strain is TH2 prone. Nonetheless, it is considered the best mouse model for human breast cancer. Tumor cells are easily transplanted into the mammary gland, 4T1 cells are tumorigenic and invasive (unlike most tumor animal models) and can spontaneously metastasize from the primary tumor to multiple distant sites, including lymph nodes, lung, liver, brain, and bone. A significant benefit of the 4T1 model is resistance of the tumor cells to 6-thioguanine, which allows detection and quantification of metastatic cells in various organs. Metastatic disease can be studied when a primary tumor is in place or after it has been surgically removed. Our data with preventive vaccination against CTCFL/BORIS antigen employing DNA immunization with a subsequent adenoviral boost, showed that immunization with CTCFL/BORIS significantly delayed tumor growth, prolonged survival time, in addition to showing that adjuvant use improved the immunogenicity of CTCFL/BORIS and anti-tumor protection [ ]. Anti-tumor protection can be improved by adding adjuvants tilting the immune system toward a TH1/CTL response using IL12/IL18 and CD80, CD86 [ , ]. Next, it was demonstrated that DNA, but not protein immunization, induced anti-tumor protection [ ]. Finally, it was shown that use of loaded dendritic cells as a delivery system for therapeutic vaccination against CTCFL/BORIS generated significant protection against 4T1 tumors [ ]. About 20% of animals were both tumor and metastasis free, while 50% were metastasis free. Very few tumor cells could be detected in the entire lungs of mice immunized with CTCFL/BORIS while the lungs of control animals had extensive 4T1 metastasis [ ].
Therapeutic CTCFL/BORIS vaccination was also evaluated in a second rodent breast cancer model using the rat carcinoma cell line, 13762. This work was done in collaboration with the laboratories of Dr. E. Nelson and Dr. M. Agadjanyan at UCI. This work is currently in preparation for publication, but briefly the results are: while control rats all developed large tumors and were dead by day 22, 60% of rats immunized with CTCFL/BORIS survived that time point and beyond. Moreover, 50% of rats in the group immunized with CTCFL/BORIS were completely cured from 13762 breast carcinoma and remained tumor- and metastasis-free for the next 3 months.
Thus, in both rodent breast cancer models, encouraging results were obtained using solely anti-CTCFL/BORIS immunotherapy.
Future directions
Due to the success of anti-CTCFL/BORIS immunotherapy in rodents, phase 1 clinical trials in humans were initiated in an effort to translate CTCFL/BORIS targeting in breast cancer into clinical research. As only breast cancer models in animals had been performed, the breast cancer patients will undergo translational research first, keeping in mind that CTCFL/BORIS can be a target for many other human malignancies.
As a first step, an arrangement with a private clinic in Europe, which has secured all permissions and has proper facilities for growing cells in vitro and returning them to patients, has been set up. The plan is to enroll stage 4 triple negative breast cancer patients who have not improved with chemotherapy and do not have options for further treatment with existing protocols. Clinicians will collect monocytes from patients by leukopheresis, differentiate monocytes into dendritic cells in vitro in the presence of GM-CSF and IL4, and infect these DCs with recombinant adenovirus containing modified human CTCFL/BORIS. 2 days post infection, cells will be frozen into aliquots. DCs will be injected into patients bi-weekly, three or four times at different doses. Patients will be monitored in a local oncology facility. This will be a dose escalation study from 10 6 to 10 8 DCs/injection. A total of 18 patients are planned for this initial study, assuming no adverse effects are observed.
Conclusions
CTCFL/BORIS is testis-specific paralogue of CTCF that evolved through duplication of the CTCF gene, likely in fish. It became testis-specific in mammals. CTCFL/BORIS has similar DNA sequence-binding specificity as CTCF and is capable of displacing CTCF in vivo from a variety of sites mainly in gene promoters and enhancers when normally expressed in testis and abnormally in cancer. Substitution of CTCF to CTCFL/BORIS alters the function of corresponding sites, likely leading to cancer. In the majority of cancer cell lines and primary cancers, CTCFL/BORIS is expressed in a CSC population. Where the expression of CTCFL/BORIS is found in a majority of cells within a cell line, this cell line is usually capable of differentiation associated with reductions in CTCFL/BORIS expression. Immunotherapy against CTCFL/BORIS as a target led to either complete cure of breast cancer in mouse and rat models or to a great reduction of tumor growth and metastasis. Phase 1 clinical studies have been initiated with a private clinic in Europe using CTCFL/BORIS as a target for immunotherapy of breast cancer.
