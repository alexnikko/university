INTRODUCTION
Current available medications for pain relief are challenging, especially as they cause numerous adverse effects. Moreover, a large group of patients fails to achieve sufficient pain relief, even with the use of various analgesics ( ). Hence, research on new formulation is necessary to decipher pain mechanisms and open new opportunities for specific and more effective treatments.
There has been a growing interest in the use of botanical extracts as therapeutic agents for alleviation of pain or inflammation ( , , ). Specifically, ASU is a biologically active class of lipids known as unsaponifiable lipids and is prepared from oil extracts of avocado and soybean in a ratio 1:2. Avocado soy unsaponifiables, under the trade name Arthrocen, are available in the USA for several years ( ). Phytosterols are the major components of ASU with beta-sitosterol, campesterol, and stigmasterol predominating. More recently, studies have demonstrated anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and analgesic properties of phytosterols ( , , ).
According to basic and clinical studies of the oral form of Arthrocen, it has been shown to improve osteoarthritis symptoms through prevention of cartilage destruction, pain alleviation, and as a result, decreased use of conventional analgesics ( , , ). Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo studies have revealed that ASU reduces the expression of inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 ( , , ), and increases the secretion of TGF β1 and TGF β2 ( , , ).
Despite the known potential effects of oral Arthrocen on inflammation and nociception ( , ), the topical use of this drug for pain relief has not been studied locally yet. If the topical formulation of ASU is effective, its application will be easier for the patient and cost less in the long term. Moreover, due to the very low dissolution of Arthrocen in water, the use of dermal carriers would be necessary for its effective skin delivery ( ). Delivery through the skin can be achieved by means of a nanocarrier with the ability to change the barriers for deep penetration into the skin layers without the harmful effects of invasion, pain and inflammation ( , ).
Among different carriers, liposomes have been developed as stable and efficient dermal delivery systems ( ), and some of their products are available on the market ( ). In several studies, different formulations of liposomes containing surfactants such as propylene glycol could enhance the efficacy and tissue accumulation of the drug in higher levels via the dermal or mucosal administration ( , , ).
Therefore, this study was conducted to formulate ASU nanoliposome and then evaluate its anti-inflammatory and anti-analgesic effects compared with ibuprofen gel 5% in vivo . At first, the dose response of ASU in its free form was assessed on paw inflammation of the mice via intraperitoneal administration. Then, NANOCEN was prepared, and its anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects were assessed topically in an animal model. We also characterized physicochemical parameters of NANOCEN formulation including the shape, size, charge, encapsulation efficiency, the in vitro release profile of the drug as well as 1-month room temperature stability.
MATERIAL AND METHOD
Soy lecithin was obtained from Daejung (South Korea). Formaldehyde, ethanol, and methanol were purchased from Merck (Germany). Carboxymethyl cellulose, dialysis membrane, carrageenan, cholesterol, and propylene glycol were purchased from Sigma (USA). ASU powder was obtained from Arthrocen capsules made by Pharmin USA, LLC (USA).
NANOCEN PREPARATION AND CHARACTERIZATION
In this experiment, we developed a procedure for nanoliposomal formulation preparation that previously used in our lab ( ). Briefly, a lipid mixture of lecithin (10%), cholesterol (1%), propylene glycol (Pg, 15% v / v ), and ASU (2%) was mixed thoroughly at 35°C. Then, phosphate buffer saline (PBS) (10 mM, pH 7) was injected to the mixture by a fine stream under stirring at 700 rpm for 30 min. Finally, the suspension was sonicated for 2 min by a 20-kHz low-frequency ultrasonic probe sonicator to obtain the nanovesicles (NANOCEN). The above procedure was done to prepare empty nanoliposomes without the use of ASU. The free form of ASU (2%) was prepared by dissolving it in ethanol 30%. For proper topical application, carboxymethyl cellulose (1%) was dissolved in each suspension for gel formation under stirring (700 rpm).
The mean diameter of the nanoliposomal formulation and its surface charge were determined based on the dynamic light scattering (DLS) by a Zetasizer system manufactured by Malvern Instruments Ltd. (UK). The morphology of nanovesicles was also confirmed by TEM and SEM microscopy.
The percentage of encapsulation efficiency (EE%) was determined based on a procedure described previously ( ). Briefly, NANOCEN suspension was centrifuged at × 8000 g for 30 min at 4°C. The sediment was washed three times with PBS. Then, the recovered drug was heated to dry at 80°C for 10 min and was dissolved completely in anhydrous methanol for analysis by a UV spectrophotometer (Cecil, UK) at 210 nm. The percent encapsulation efficiency (EE) of Arthrocen in liposomes was calculated using the following equation: $$ \mathrm{EE}\%=\frac{\left(\mathrm{total}\ \mathrm{amount}\ \mathrm{of}\ \mathrm{added}\ \mathrm{arthrocen}-\mathrm{amount}\ \mathrm{of}\ \mathrm{arthrocen}\ \mathrm{precipitate}\right)}{\mathrm{total}\ \mathrm{amount}\ \mathrm{of}\ \mathrm{added}\ \mathrm{arthrocen}} \times 100 $$
STABILITY EXPERIMENT
The prepared nanoliposomes of Arthrocen were subjected to stability studies for a 1-month period. The liposomes were sealed in a 10-mL sterile glass vial and stored at room temperature (25°C).
DRUG RELEASE ASSESSMENT
The in vitro release profile of Arthrocen-loaded liposomes was determined by the Franz diffusion cell method. NANOCEN hydrogel (2 mL) was placed between two chambers that were separated by a 12,000 Da cut-off dialysis membrane. The released drug was removed from the receptor phase, which was prepared as 70 mL phosphate buffer (pH: 7.4) containing 30% ethanol under a constant temperature of 37°C and rotation speed of 100 rpm. At each determined time interval, 0.5 mL of the sample was withdrawn from the receptor phase and the receptor solution was subsequently replaced again with an equivalent volume of the sample. Then, the ASU concentration was measured at 210 nm using a UV spectrophotometer. To ensure that the sustained release profile was not due to the membrane, ASU dispersion at an equal concentration of the drug in the formulation was evaluated under the same condition.
ANIMALS
The male NMRI mice weighing 20–25 g were used throughout the experiment with housing facilities (environment temperature at 21–23°C, 12-h regular light/dark cycles). The animals had unlimited access to food and water throughout the experiment. The experimental procedures were approved (No. 96-04-158-37121) by the Ethics Committee of Tehran University of Medical Sciences in agreement with the standards for the care and use of laboratory animals. The animals were randomly divided into five main groups with n = 6 for each experimentation including control (ethanol 30%), free ASU 2%, nanoliposome alone, NANOCEN, and ibuprofen gel 5% groups.
ANIMAL EXPERIMENTATION
Dose Response
The effective dose of free ASU was determined on the inflamed paw of mice prior to the main study. In brief, three doses of 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, and 20 mg/kg of ASU were administrated intraperitoneally to mice subjected to inflammation that were randomly divided into three groups, each including three mice. Among the corresponding doses, ASU 20 mg/kg was more effective, which was considered at a concentration of 2% ASU applied in topical formulation of NANOCEN.
Inflammation Test
The anti-inflammatory activity of the formulation was evaluated using the carrageenan method in mice ( ) with a slight modification. Fifty microliters of each sample were applied topically by rubbing gently at a frequency of 50× per minute on the subjected paw 30 min before induction of the inflammation. Then, edema was induced by injecting 0.04 mL of 1% w / v carrageenan suspended in saline into the sub-plantar tissue of the right hind paw of each mouse. The paw thickness was measured immediately prior to carrageenan administration as a zero point and then at 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th hours after injection of carrageenan using a digital caliper. The inflammation was calculated by measuring the difference in the paw thickness at zero point and paw thickness (edema) at corresponding times. Finally, the mice were euthanized and sacrificed for further study of the aspects of inflammation by histopathology of the inflamed footpad.
Histological Examination
Histopathology study of footpad samples of the mice was done by hematoxylin-eosin staining. The specimen was removed, fixed in 10% formalin, and then embedded in paraffin. All tissues were sectioned and stained for microscopic examination. Then, different aspects of inflammation were interpreted semi-quantitatively under blind conditions by an expert pathologist as follows: infiltration of lymphocytes or plasmocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, giant cells, and abscess. The intensity of the histological outcome was scored as (0) = no frequency, (1) = low frequency, (2) = moderate frequency, and (3) = high frequency, and total scores of inflammation were analyzed as non-parametric and expressed as median among different groups.
Formalin Test
Analgesic activity was assessed by the paw formalin test adopted from the Guindon method ( ). In brief, mice were randomly separated into five groups (six mice per group). Animals in the untreated group received formalin as the negative control group. The other four groups were treated topically as follows: NANOCEN, free ASU 2%, liposome alone, and ibuprofen 5%.
In all the four treated groups, 50 μl of the relative sample was topically applied to the sub-plantar surface of the left hind paw by rubbing gently at 50 frequencies per minute. Then, 30 min later, 50 μL of 2.5% formalin was subcutaneously injected into the dorsal surface of the left footpad using a 27-gauge syringe needle. The mice were kept in a flat plexiglass chamber (Aratebfan Co. ir, Tehran, Iran) with a surface area of 30 × 30 × 30 cm along with a mirror at 45° angle under the chamber to observe the response of animals following formalin injection. The nociceptive behavior of the animals was recorded in 15-s periods every 1 min for up to 60 min according to the numerical scale in Table I . Each animal was studied individually during 60 min in two phases. The first phase that was tested 0–10 min after injection was named the “acute pain” phase, in which the main reason for the pain was formalin injecting. Nociceptive behavior was scored in this phase according to a modified version of the Coderre’s method ( ) and described as the following equation: Table I The Categories of Pain-Related Behaviors After Formalin Injection in Mice for Estimation of Nociceptive. Pain behavior indicator Nociceptive score Being the injected paw on the glass plate 0 Short tapping on the plate or limp and or raise the injected paw 1 Lifting foot upward completely 2 Licking or biting and or shaking the injected paw 3
$$ \mathrm{Score}\ \mathrm{of}\ \mathrm{nociception}\ \left(\mathrm{acute}\right)={\mathrm{St}}_{n1}+{\mathrm{St}}_{n2} $$ where St n is score of time intervals: \( \frac{\ \mathrm{Sum}\left(\Sigma \right)\mathrm{of}\ \mathrm{behaiviore}\ \mathrm{scores}\ \mathrm{in}\ \mathrm{each}\ 5\ \min }{300\ \left(\mathrm{s}\right)} \)
The second phase, 15–60 min after the injection, was named the “chronic pain” phase in which the inflammatory effect of formalin was the reason for pain. The intensity of pain was quantified using the total score of time intervals in this phase, which was described as follows:
$$ \mathrm{Score}\ \mathrm{of}\ \mathrm{nociception}\ \left(\mathrm{chronic}\right)={\mathrm{St}}_{n1}+{\mathrm{St}}_{n2}+{\mathrm{St}}_{n3}+\dots +{\mathrm{St}}_{n8} $$
Statistical Analysis
Parametric data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey post-hoc test and t test was also applied to analyze the drug release of the formulation (the results are expressed as mean ± SD). The histological scores were analyzed with the non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis test for overall significant differences (the data reported as median). The P values less than 0.05 were considered significant.
RESULTS
Characterization and Stability of NANOCEN
In this study, a NANOCEN formulation was prepared in an average size of 146.1 ± 1.1 nm with a good polydispersity index (PDI) and surface charge of − 43.60 ± 1 mV using DLS analysis (Table II and Fig. 1 ). The calculated encapsulation efficiency (96 ± 2.25%) of the NANOCEN formulation is offered in Table II . As shown in Fig. 2 , TEM and SEM imaging of the ASU formulation displayed a spherical shape of nanovesicles and no aggregation or fusion was observed in microscopic fields.

Stability experiment as shown in Table II , NANOCEN had little change in particle size (164.3 ± 8.3 nm) with a low PDI (< 0.3) and surface charge (− 40.33 ± 2 mV) after 1-month storage at room temperature. Moreover, the encapsulation efficiency of a 1-month storage NANOCEN (93.4%) was almost stable maintained compared to a fresh one.
In vitro Release Assessment
Data of NANOCEN release profile determined a significant ( p < 0.0001) sustained release of the ASU in vitro during a 24-h investigation. As shown in Fig. 3 , more than 90% of the free form of ASU was released from the donor cell after 24 h. While, after 5 h and 24 h, only about 13% and 38.2% of loaded ASU was released through the membrane into the receptor media, respectively.

Anti-inflammatory Activity of NANOCEN
The anti-inflammatory effects of NANOCEN and ibuprofen 5% as a control anti-nociception drug were assessed topically by carrageenan-induced paw edema in mice. According to Fig. 4 , the anti-inflammatory effect was significant in the mice treated with the NANOCEN compared with control group within the first hour (with p < 0.0001) and fifth hour (with p < 0.01) of the investigation.

Although ibuprofen gel also exhibited anti-inflammatory effects at all-time intervals in this experiment, its effect was never significant in comparison to the control group ( p > 0.05), as given in Fig. 4 .
Histological Outcomes
In this research, the results of tissue slides (Table III ) indicated that the inflammation score of NANOCEN was markedly lower than the control group ( p < 0.001), while ibuprofen gel 5% could not significantly reduce the inflammation score compared to the control group ( p > 0.05). According to Fig. 5 , inflammatory cells including lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages, and neutrophils infiltrated the carrageenan-inflamed tissues 5 h after induction. The infiltration of lymphatic cells reduced in NANOCEN and ibuprofen gel groups as demonstrated in Fig. 5a and b , respectively, while control groups showed moderate to severe infiltration of the inflammatory cells in the injured area, as described in Fig. 5c and d , respectively.

Analgesic Effect of NANOCEN
Analgesic effects of the corresponding drugs were assessed by paw formalin test in mice model. Data given in Figs. 6 and 7 show that NANOCEN reduced significantly pain symptoms at both acute and chronic phase, p < 0.0001 and p < 0.01, respectively. While ibuprofen as positive control did not have significantly ( p > 0.05) anti-nociceptive effect compared with other groups. Analgesic effect of ASU alone also was significant ( p < 0.05) compared with control in the acute stage, while it never induced analgesia significantly ( p > 0.05) in the chronic phase of pain. The results also showed that liposomes without the drug did not have significant ( p > 0.05) analgesic effects compared to the control group ( p > 0.05).

DISCUSSION
NANOCEN Formulation Performance and Sustained Release
Here, for the first time, we formulated topical NANOCEN at a size of about 146 nm with a surface charge of − 43 mV. The negatively charged vesicles may be due to Pg excipients in the liposomal formulation ( , ). It has been confirmed that propylene glycol excipient enhances drug solubility, promotes long-term stability, and improves penetration of the carrier-cargo into deep tissue layers ( , , ). It has also been proposed that the vesicles at sizes around 150 nm could improve drug delivery through penetration and deposition of the drug into skin layers ( , ).
Stability experiment in this study showed a minute change in particle size, charge, and PDI as well as EE% of the ASU liposomes after a 1-month storage at room temperature. Since this formulation was stored in sterile vials, the oxidation and contamination of the phospholipids could be hindered during its storage. Furthermore, the data of TEM and SEM imaging suggest that incorporation of Pg into the formulation may stabilize NANOCEN against aggregation and fusion of the vesicles ( ).
According to the evidence from topical mixed micelles, ASU formulation could act sufficiently as a dermal delivery system because of its appropriate size range, high flexibility, and sustained release capacity. In a study by Azizi et al . in 2017, the particle size of ibuprofen nanoemulsions exhibited an important role in the efficacy of the formulations in inhibiting pain and inflammation in an animal model ( ). Azizi et al . study also showed that nanoemulsions containing 2.5% ibuprofen had significantly better analgesic effects compared to commercial ibuprofen and microemulsions (over 1000 nm in diameter size) containing 5% ibuprofen ( ).
In our study, the efficacy failure of the analgesic ibuprofen gel (as a standard drug) may be because of the inappropriate vehicle or excipients used in the ibuprofen gel formulation, resulting in the insufficient bioavailability of the drug ( ). Furthermore, the ASU release profile with p < 0.0001 and the trend of the curve showed that Arthrocen may be released continuously from NANOCEN more than 1 day. Therefore, it can be concluded that continued release of ASU in the environment might produce long-lasting and efficient analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects by its topical administration ( ).
Anti-inflammatory and Analgesic Activity of NANOCEN
Previous studies have shown that expression of potent pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a, IL-1b, COX-2, and iNOS of articular monocytes and macrophages could be suppressed with avocado soybean unsaponifiables ( ).
In this study, the results of paw edema and histopathology evaluation showed that topical NANOCEN could potentially inhibit inflammation ( p < 0.0001) in a continuous manner in mice subjected to carrageenan. Histopathology of the inflamed tissues revealed that ASU formulation could potentially inhibit infiltration of lymphatic cells and abscess formation as well as paw edema in the mice.
Therefore, NANOCEN may affect the reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines production associated with osteoarthritis. This reflects the probable pain-reducing and anti-inflammatory effects of topical ASU formulation in patients suffering from acute or chronic pain such as osteoarthritis. Replacement of NSAIDs with ASU or its usage as a complementary medication can reduce the adverse effects of these classes of analgesic drugs ( ).
Several basic and clinical reports have indicated the potential anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties of ASU as a dietary supplement as well as its ability to improve damaged cartilage ( , , ). However, in the recent study by Goudarzi et al . ( ) on an animal model of osteoarthritis, consumption of Arthrocen (35 mg/day PO) for 30 days could significantly improve hind limb symptoms. However, the analgesic activity of ASU by von Frey hair assessment, a mechanosensitivity stimulus, did not show any significant results in animal experimentation ( ). These controversial data from different reports may be due to an inadequate dosage of Arthrocen, drug targeting failure, or other interferences involved in the bioavailability of the drug. ASU contains highly lipophilic molecules with a tendency to bind to lipid cells and plasma proteins resulting in insufficient bioavailability and inefficient drug delivery upon systemic administration ( , ).
On the other hand, lipidic molecules of Arthrocen are not water-soluble and pharmaceutical criteria recommend that it should be formulated for efficient transcutaneous delivery ( , ). Therefore, in our study, due to the nanoliposmal formulation of Arthrocen, ASU might be accumulated efficiently in the deep skin layers and released slowly ( , ), causing an effective ( p < 0.0001) and long-lasting analgesic effect.
CONCLUSION
This study proposed formulation of NANOCEN without any harmful chemicals for topical administration. NANOCEN caused effective inflammation inhibition and pain relief even better than ibuprofen 5%, as a standard drug, investigated in the animal model. The fast- and long-acting properties of topical ASU formulation can be promising reasons for its translation to medical research.
