INTRODUCTION
Dexamethasone is a synthetic corticosteroid used as an anti-inflammatory agent, which is known to be unstable in aqueous media and to form multiple oxidative degradation products ( , , ). Dexamethasone containing poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) sustained release implants are used to treat inflammatory conditions associated with various diseases of the back of the eye, including retinal vein occlusion, posterior segment uveitis, and diabetic macular edema ( , , ). These implants are administered to the eye via injection into the vitreous humor, an aqueous compartment. The implants are exposed to the aqueous medium at body temperature for prolonged periods within the eye. Although the released drug may be largely cleared within a few hours in vivo and not exposed to the vitreous humor for prolonged periods ( ), the in vitro drug release in aqueous medium over a prolonged period is a critical performance metric for such implants. It is probable that dexamethasone will degrade in the release medium during such release studies. The objective of this study was to quantify dexamethasone degradation rate constants and its degradation products in aqueous solution at different temperatures, with and without light exposure, and to apply this information to correct release from polymeric implants for drug degradation using mathematical models.
Although HPLC and LC-MS/MS-based analytical methods for determining dexamethasone stability have previously been reported ( , , ), we developed an improved LC-MS/MS-based analytical method capable of detecting and quantifying dexamethasone and 13 major dexamethasone degradation products in one run. The carbon–fluorine bond at C9 position of dexamethasone is chemically very stable, yet labile under collision induced dissociation (CID), giving a characteristic loss of 20 Da (M + H − F − H) ( , ). We used this characteristic loss of fluorine to develop an LC-MS/MS method to separate and quantitatively analyze dexamethasone and its degradation products based on retention time, precursor mass, and product ion information in a single analytical run. We expect that this assay would be useful in drug product development as well as in ensuring adequate drug release performance for dexamethasone-PLGA implants.
With the analytical method developed, we measured the degradation of dexamethasone incubated in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) over time at 25, 37, or 45°C, with or without light exposure, and the resultant formation of the major dexamethasone degradation products. Using dexamethasone-PLGA polymeric implant as a model, we performed in vitro release at physiological temperature and pH over 71 days, characterized the drug degradation pattern, and corrected the release data for degradation, to estimate actual drug release from the implant.

In Vitro Stability Analysis of Dexamethasone
Dexamethasone (0.2 mg) was dissolved in 100 mL of PBS (pH 7.4) and incubated at 25°C, 37°C, or 45°C. The 45°C samples also contained 0.05 g/L SDS. Samples were prepared in clear glass bottles (ambient light exposed) or in amber bottles wrapped in aluminum foil (protected from light). All samples were incubated in a MaxQ 4000 orbital shaker (Thermo Scientific) operating at 150 rpm. At predetermined time points, 1 mL of each solution was collected and replaced with fresh buffer. Collected samples were stored at − 20°C until analysis. An aliquot from each sample was spiked with dexamethasone-d 4 as an internal standard and analyzed by LC-MS/MS.
HPLC-ESI+-MS/MS Detection and Quantitation of Dexamethasone Degradation Products
A Prominence HPLC (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) coupled to a QTrap 4500 mass spectrometer (AB Sciex, Farmingham, MA) was used to develop an analytical method for dexamethasone and its degradation products. The mass spectrometer was operated in the ESI + mode and all settings were optimized by manually tuning to an infused solution of dexamethasone. Optimized parameters are as follows: curtain gas, 50 psi; collision gas, high; ion spray voltage, 5500 V; source temperature, 600°C; ion source gas 1 and 2, 30 psi; declustering potential, 40 V; and collision energy, 14 V.
Quantitation was performed in multiple reaction mode (MRM) (see Table I for mass assignments) with dexamethasone-d 4 used as an internal standard for dexamethasone and all degradation products. Analytical separation was achieved with a Phenomenex phenyl-hexyl column (3 × 100 mm, 3.5 μm). The column was held at 40°C and eluted at 0.5 mL/min with a gradient of 10% acetonitrile in 20 mM ammonium formate, pH 3.8 (A), and 10% isopropanol in acetonitrile (B). Chromatographic separation was achieved with a linear gradient (time, % of solvent B) 0–9 min, 10.5–13.7% B; 9–17 min, 13.7–21% B; 17–22 min, 21–35% B; 22–23 min, 35–10.5% B; and then isocratic for 10 min at 10.5% B to re-equilibrate the column.

The concentration of dexamethasone in each sample was calculated from the ratio of the HPLC-ESI + -MS/MS peak area for dexamethasone to the peak area for dexamethasone-d 4 . This ratio was multiplied by the known concentration of the internal standard, then adjusted for instrument response with a calibration curve constructed with known ratios of dexamethasone and dexamethasone-d 4 . Structural similarities allowed the use of the same calibration curve for quantitation of the dexamethasone degradation products. The lower limit of quantitation for dexamethasone was 10 fmols of dexamethasone on column with an interday accuracy of 103.6% ± 5.7% with a %RSD of 5.5%. The lower limit of detection was defined as a peak with a signal to noise ratio ≥ 5.
Dexamethasone Degradation Rate Constants and Concentration Corrections in PBS
Dexamethasone degradation rate constants were calculated from the degradation of dexamethasone standards incubated in PBS buffer at 25, 37, or 45°C either exposed to ambient light (light) or protected from light (dark). The degradation rate constants were calculated by plotting dexamethasone concentrations against sampling time on a semi-log scale. As previously described, when dexamethasone incubations were sampled, the solvent removed was replaced with fresh solvent (1% of total volume). Therefore, the concentration of dexamethasone in solution was reduced by 1% of the remaining dexamethasone at each time point. Additionally, any dexamethasone removed from solution would have continued to degrade had it been left in solution. We used Eq. 1 to correct for dexamethasone lost to sampling and to simulate the degradation of the removed dexamethasone. We started with the uncorrected degradation rate constant, and then iteratively applied Eq. 1 to refine the degradation rate constant. $$ {\mathrm{Dex}}_{\left(n;\mathrm{corrected}\right)}={\mathrm{Dex}}_{\left(n;\mathrm{observed}\right)}+\left\{\left[\left({\mathrm{Dex}}_{\left(n-1;\mathrm{observed}\right)}\times 0.01\right)+\left({\mathrm{Dex}}_{\left(n-1;\mathrm{corrected}\right)}-{\mathrm{Dex}}_{\left(n-1;\mathrm{observed}\right)}\right)\right]\cdot {e}^{-{k}_d\cdot \Delta t}\right\} $$ (1) where “Dex” is the concentration of dexamethasone, subscript “ n ” is the current sample, subscript “ n − 1” is the previous sample, and “Δ t ” is the time between sampling ( t ( n ) − t ( n −1) ).
Implant Preparation and In Vitro Release from Dexamethasone-PLGA Implants
For proof-of-concept studies to show that dexamethasone degradation during in vitro release can be corrected using a mathematical model developed in this study, release samples for a dexamethasone-PLGA implant were analyzed for dexamethasone and its degradation products. A HAAKE MiniCTW Hot-melt Extruder (HME) (Thermo Electron, ThermoFisher Scientific, Karlsruhe, Germany) was used to prepare PLGA implants. The polymer mixture consisted of 80% acid terminated PLGA and 20% ester terminated PLGA. Micronized dexamethasone was mixed into the polymer mix at 20% w/w and extruded using the HME device. The implant manufacturing was performed at 100°C, a temperature much less than the melting temperature of dexamethasone (~ 262°C); therefore, no drug melting or degradation is anticipated. Implants of approximately 0.4 × 6 mm (~ 1 mg) were cut from the extruded fibers. Dexamethasone-PLGA implants were incubated at 37°C placed in 100 mL (sink conditions) of PBS (pH 7.4) in clear glass bottles exposed to ambient light in a MaxQ 4000 orbital shaker (Thermo Scientific) operating at 150 rpm. At predetermined time points, 1 mL aliquot from each sample was collected and replaced with fresh buffer. Collected samples were stored at − 20°C until analysis. An aliquot was removed from each collected sample, spiked with dexamethasone-d 4 as an internal standard, and analyzed by LC-MS/MS.
Correction of Dexamethasone Release from Implants for Drug Degradation in PBS
Excel spreadsheet (Microsoft, Seattle, WA)-based calculations were implemented to account for drug degradation in the release medium ( ). Specifically, the amount of dexamethasone released at each time point was determined by correcting the observed dexamethasone concentration in the medium for the sample removed previously (99% remains after sampling) and drug degradation in both the sample and the bulk medium using Eq. 2 . The total dexamethasone released from the implant was calculated using Eq. 3 . $$ {\mathrm{Dex}}_{\left(n;\mathrm{released}\right)}={\mathrm{Dex}}_{\left(\mathrm{n};\mathrm{observed}\right)}-\left[\left({\mathrm{Dex}}_{\left(n-1;\mathrm{observed}\right)}\times 0.99\right)\cdot {e}^{-{k}_d\cdot \Delta t}\right] $$ (2) $$ {\mathrm{Dex}}_{\left(n;\mathrm{total}\right)}={\sum}_{i=1}^n{\mathrm{Dex}}_{\left(i;\mathrm{released}\right)} $$ (3) where “Dex” is the concentration of dexamethasone, subscript “ n ” is the current sample, subscript “ n − 1” is the previous sample, and “Δ t ” is the time between sampling ( t ( n ) − t ( n −1) ).
Additionally, a pharmacokinetic model with first-order drug release and first-order drug degradation was developed to estimate drug release corrected for degradation in the release medium using the Boomer PK software ( ). This model included, and corrected for, the loss of dexamethasone resulting from sample removal and buffer replacement. Each data point was weighted equally. A zero-order process was considered for drug degradation but did not provide any improvement to the fit. Equation 4 describes the release of dexamethasone from the implant, Eq. 5 models the increase of dexamethasone in solution if there was no degradation, and Eq. 6 models dexamethasone concentrations in solution with degradation. All three equations were used to describe the final pharmacokinetic model developed using the Boomer PK software, where X 1 is the amount of dexamethasone in the implant, X 2 is the amount of dexamethasone in solution, with the initial values of X 1 = Dose − Burst and X 2 = Burst. $$ \frac{d{X}_1}{dt}=-{k}_{\mathrm{release}}\cdotp {X}_1 $$ (4) $$ \frac{d{X}_2}{dt}={k}_{\mathrm{release}}\cdotp {X}_1 $$ (5) $$ \frac{d{X}_2}{dt}={k}_{\mathrm{release}}\cdot {X}_1-{k}_{\mathrm{degradation}}\cdot {X}_2 $$ (6)
RESULTS
Dexamethasone and 13 dexamethasone degradation products were quantified using stable isotope dilution LC-MS/MS with dexamethasone-d 4 as an internal standard. An example chromatogram with the relevant m / z assignments for each molecule is shown in Fig. 1 . Fig. 1 Representative LC-MS/MS chromatogram of dexamethasone and dexamethasone degradation products following incubation of dexamethasone in PBS buffer for 71 days at 37°C
The identities of products 8 (17β-carboxy-17α-formyloxy dexamethasone) and 12 (17-oxo-dexamethasone) were confirmed by co-injection of authentic standards. Products 4, 6, 9, 10, and 13 all share the same transition in the mass spectrometer ( m / z 363 → 343) and are most likely structural isomers of one another; one of which is expected to be 17β-carboxy-17-desoxy dexamethasone ( ). To the best of our knowledge, product 11 ( m / z 361) is novel and has not been previously reported in the literature. The putative identities of the remaining degradation products were assigned based on mass, retention time relative to dexamethasone, and structures reported in the literature (Table I , Scheme 1 ) ( , , , , ). Scheme 1 Proposed putative pathway of dexamethasone degradation when incubated in PBS. Degradations products 4, 6, 9, and 10 may form through one or both pathways indicated by dashed arrows
Dexamethasone Stability in PBS
Dexamethasone concentrations decreased in PBS buffer (pH 7.4) as a function of time and temperature (Fig. 2 ). Temperature strongly affected dexamethasone stability. Dexamethasone incubated in PBS at 25°C had a degradation rate constant of 0.006 day −1 (dark) or 0.005 day −1 (light), incubation at 37°C had a degradation rate constant of 0.037 day −1 (dark and light), and dexamethasone at 45°C had a degradation rate constant of 0.083 day −1 (dark) or 0.089 day −1 (light). Dexamethasone incubated in the presence of light at 37°C initially degraded faster compared to dexamethasone that was protected from light. After 5 days of incubation, light-exposed samples incubated at 37°C had significantly ( p = 0.0046) less dexamethasone (73.2% of initial dexamethasone) in solution compared to dexamethasone incubated in the dark (80.3% of initial dexamethasone). The effect of light decreased with increasing incubation time; after 17 days of incubation 48.0% of initial dexamethasone remained in light-exposed samples and 50.3% remained in samples that were protected from light (not statistically different; p = 0.51). Dexamethasone incubated at 45°C showed no significant difference in the extent of degradation when exposed to light ( p > 0.27). No quantifiable degradation was observed in samples stored in the cooled autosampler (15°C) over the course of the LC-MS/MS analysis.

Mass Balance and Time Course of Degradation Products of Dexamethasone in PBS
As dexamethasone degraded, the formation of the monitored degradation products (Table I ) made up for the decrease in dexamethasone, maintaining the mass balance (Fig. 3 ). After 71 days of incubation, samples incubated at 25°C contained at least 92% of the total mass, and samples incubated at 37°C contained at least 95% of the total mass. Samples incubated at 45°C for 15 days retained a mass balance of at least 89%. Deviation of mass balance from 100% could result from minor quantitation errors, formation of additional degradation products that were not tracked, degradation products that are present but fall below the limit of quantitation, or a combination of these factors. Although the overall mass balance was similar between light and dark samples, differences in the distribution of degradation products between the two samples sets was observed in the 37°C incubations (Fig. 3 ). Fig. 3 Contribution of dexamethasone and each dexamethasone degradation product to total mass balance as a function of temperature, light exposure, and time. Dexamethasone was incubated in PBS buffer for 71 days at 25°C and 37°C or for 15 days at 45°C. Samples were incubated either exposed to (light) or protected from light (dark). The amount of dexamethasone and dexamethasone degradation products detected in solution were added together and used to track the mass balance. See Fig. 4 for reproducibility of the degradation peaks at selected time points
Degradation products formed in a time-, temperature-, and light exposure-dependent manner, with some degradation products increasing continuously with time, while others first increased and then declined (Fig. 3 ). At 25°C, product 7 ( m / z 409) was the most abundant degradation product. At later time points, the amount of product 7 stopped increasing in dark samples as other products formed. Product 7 continued to increase through day 71 in light samples, and the amounts of other products formed were lower. At an incubation temperature of 37°C, light samples had a higher abundance of products 7 and 8 at early time points, while dark samples initially had a high abundance of products 3 and 7. For both samples sets, products 1, 2, and 6 were the most abundant by day 71. Figure 4 shows differences in the degradation product quantities after 5, 24, and 71 days at 37°C between light and dark sample sets. At 25°C and 45°C, the differences in product distribution between the light and dark sample sets were less pronounced. These results indicate that products 3, 7, and 8 are likely intermediates in the formation of other degradation products. Further, additional studies indicated that inclusion of sodium azide in the aqueous medium does not inhibit degradation of dexamethasone or affect the degradation product pattern (data not shown). Fig. 4 Effect of light exposure on the distribution of dexamethasone and each dexamethasone degradation product as a function of incubation time. Dexamethasone was incubated in PBS buffer for 71 days at 37°C. Samples were incubated either exposed to (light) or protected from light (dark). Mean ± SD for four samples were reported
Correction of Drug Levels in Implant Release Medium for Drug Degradation—Estimation of Drug Release Using a Pharmacokinetic Model
Intact dexamethasone contribution in the release medium on day 71 was higher in implant samples, relative to those with plain drug incubated in PBS (Fig. 5 ), suggesting that dexamethasone only starts to degrade upon release from the PLGA implant. Dexamethasone release from dexamethasone-PLGA implants incubated in PBS buffer for 71 days at 37°C is shown in Fig. 6 . As dexamethasone was released from the dexamethasone-PLGA implant, the dexamethasone concentration in release medium increased at early time points and then leveled off at later time points. At early time points, more dexamethasone was released from the dexamethasone-PLGA implant than was degraded in solution. However, once the concentration of dexamethasone in solution reached ~ 32% of the initial implant loading, a steady state was reached. Under these conditions, dexamethasone is degraded at approximately the same rate as the implant is releasing dexamethasone into solution resulting in a plateau at later time points. Fig. 5 Effect of incubation conditions light exposure on dexamethasone stability and the distribution of dexamethasone degradation products after 71 days at 37°C in PBS buffer (pH 7.4). Comparison of two different dexamethasone-PLGA implants and dexamethasone exposed to light during incubation (percent relative to initial dexamethasone). The data suggests that dexamethasone-PLGA implants had a protective effect, resulting in more dexamethasone remaining in solution on day 71. Additionally, the distribution of degradation products was different between the two groups. For dexamethasone in PBS, the chart is based on mean values for four samples Fig. 6 a Pharmacokinetic model implemented using Boomer to simulate dexamethasone release from implants following correction for dexamethasone degradation in the release medium. The model also accounts for dexamethasone lost during sampling. The rate constants k release and k degradation are first-order constants. b , c Dexamethasone in solution as a percentage of total dexamethasone available from an intermediate release dexamethasone-PLGA implant after incubation at 37°C for 71 days under ambient light, with aliquots removed on days 0.25, 1, 5, 10, 17, 24, and 71. Dexamethasone corrected for sampling (solid line) shows the amount of dexamethasone in solution at each time point. Dexamethasone was corrected for both sampling and degradation using Excel to calculate the total amount released (long dashed line connecting circles). A Boomer simulation of the data was also performed, simulating release of dexamethasone from the implant (continuous, finely dashed line). Data points in panels b and c represent drug levels or Excel-estimated drug levels for an implant, whose drug release into the medium was assessed
Release was simulated using Boomer ( ), by fitting the data with the model shown in Fig. 6a . The model in Fig. 6a produced the best fit for the data based on AIC value and observation of the standardized residual plots ( ). The best-fit parameter values from Boomer were k release = 0.0253 (day −1 ), k degradation = 0.0203 (day −1 ), and a burst release of 2.60%. The same model, with k degradation set to 0, was used to simulate expected release kinetics, without degradation, as shown in Fig. 6 . In addition to the Boomer method, the calculated degradation rate constant was used to correct release from the implant (Fig. 6 ) using mathematical modeling in an Excel sheet following the method described by Kim et al. ( ).
DISCUSSION
Limitations of UV Analysis of Dexamethasone
The 1,4-diene-3-one located on the A-ring of dexamethasone has maximum UV absorbance at 246 nm ( ε 16,200) ( ). The only other UV-active moiety in dexamethasone is the α-hydroxyl ketone, which gives a weak signal at 190 nm. Therefore, the 1,4-diene-3-one is responsible for the UV signal typically measured for dexamethasone ( ). The conservation of the chromophore in degradation products would permit the measurement of the combined amounts of dexamethasone and dexamethasone degradation products in solution quickly on a UV spectrophotometer, but not the amount of intact dexamethasone nor the distribution of the degradation products. Additionally, the structural similarities between dexamethasone and its degradation products cause similar HPLC selectivity and retention factors. Peak purity calculations with UV signal can fail when similar chromophores sufficiently overlap ( ). Short ultra-fast high-throughput HPLC-UV methods are more likely to cause some of the degradation peaks to co-elute with the dexamethasone peak, resulting in the over-estimation of the amount of dexamethasone remaining in solution. Furthermore, HPLC-UV methods will also contain peaks from UV-active excipients, anti-oxidants, and other products added to the drug formulation. These products are not observed in LC-MS/MS due to the selectivity inherent in MRM mass spectrometer settings. Unlike the above methods, our mass spectrometer based approach allows for the identification and more accurate quantitation of dexamethasone and its degradation products.
Identification of Degradation Products
Initially, solutions of dexamethasone incubated in PBS at 37°C and light exposure were analyzed in the neutral loss mode of the mass spectrometer, with the quadrupoles offset by 20 m / z to select any ion that had the characteristic loss of fluorine (M – HF + H + ). Hits from the neutral loss experiment were further analyzed in the MRM mode of the mass spectrometer. Dexamethasone, 16 major dexamethasone degradation products, and trace amounts of additional degradation products were initially detected in this manner. To rule out artifacts, multiple HPLC conditions were tested. Peaks that consistently co-eluted were evaluated and, in all cases, they were determined to result from in-source fragmentation of a significantly more intense co-eluting peak. After artifacts and products of in-source fragmentation were excluded, dexamethasone and 13 degradation product peaks were selected for quantitation. Gradient elution was used for the final method to ensure that there was adequate separation between all peaks of interest (Fig. 1 ). This optimized method was used for subsequent sample analysis.
Conserved Structural Elements in Degradation Products
Based on our mass spectrometry analysis, we have determined that the four carbon rings that form the steroid backbone, the fluorine moiety, and the 1,4-diene-3-one on the A-ring are conserved in all 13 dexamethasone degradation products. Additionally, all analytes share the loss of HF as a primary fragmentation pathway. Dexamethasone and its degradation products are all expected to ionize on the A-ring in positive mode ( ) and have very similar propensities for ionization due to the conserved structure of the A-ring. Our LC-MS/MS assay utilizes dexamethasone-d 4 as an internal standard for dexamethasone and all of the degradation products. Dexamethasone-d 4 contains the 1,4-diene-3-one on the A-ring and the fluorine moiety and therefore will ionize and fragment like dexamethasone and the dexamethasone degradation products, yet has no background or interference from dexamethasone derived degradation products due to its + 4 Da mass. These features make dexamethasone-d 4 an appropriate internal standard for dexamethasone and all of the degradation the compounds. The near complete mass balance results from the degradation of dexamethasone in PBS buffer is consistent with the accuracy of the method and the accountability of the observed degradation products for most of the dexamethasone loss in PBS (Fig. 3 ).
Formation and Identification of Degradation Products
Based on the relative retention times, masses, and rates of formation of each degradation product, a putative scheme for the formation of the degradation products was developed (Scheme 1 ). Structural assignments were based on commercially available degradation products, products reported in the literature, and reported oxidation reactions of corticosteroids ( , , , , ). We observe five products ( , , , , ) at m / z 363, of which only two degradation products with this m / z have been previously reported in the literature, and degradation product 11 ( m / z 361) has not been previously reported. We have positively confirmed products 8 ( m / z 407) and 12 ( m / z 333) by co-injection with authentic standards. As can be seen in Fig. 3 , at 37°C, while protected from light, products 3 ( m / z 407) and 7 ( m / z 409) rapidly form and then begin to decrease as other degradation products form. The concentration of product 3 is lower at higher temperature and in samples exposed to light. This indicates that products 3 and 7 oxidize further to form other degradation products. We speculate that four of the products at m / z of 363 ( , , , ,and) are stereoisomers that form either product 5 when stereochemistry is lost when the alcohol is removed from carbon 17, or from the breaking of the double bond on the D-ring of product 11. When stereoisomers are formed in this manner, one isomer tends to be more energetically or sterically favorable and is found in greater abundance. The increased abundance of product 6 compared to products 4, 9, and 10 fits this expected pattern. Based on the relative retention times, these products are most likely 4, 6, 9, and 10. Compound 13 ( m / z 363) has a significantly later elution time, indicating greater hydrophobicity, and, therefore, is expected to differ structurally from the other four m / z 363 compounds.
Time, Temperature, and Ambient Light Dependence of Degradation
Dexamethasone, when incubated in PBS (pH 7.4), produced degradation products in a time-, temperature-, and light exposure-dependent manner (Fig. 3 ). The decrease in the dexamethasone levels in the incubation mixture were used to calculate the extent of degradation and the rates of degradation. The total amount of degradation products measured in the incubation mixture was nearly equal to the amount of dexamethasone lost to degradation (Fig. 3 ). The highest mass balance (≥ 95%) was observed in samples incubated 37°C. The lower mass balance (≥ 92%) for samples incubated at 25°C is due, at least in part, to degradation products that are detectable but below the limit of quantitation. At 45°C, the lower mass balance (≥ 89%) is likely due to the formation of further degraded products that no longer contain the fluorine on the steroid backbone.
Dexamethasone incubated at 25°C and 37°C degrades to a greater extent upon light exposure at early time points; this difference becomes less pronounced upon long-term incubation (Figs. 3 and 4 ). Light had no significant effect on the extent of dexamethasone degradation when dexamethasone was incubated at 45°C (Fig. 2 ). Because the degradation rate constants and the mass balances for light and dark samples were very similar, we can conclude that exposure to standard laboratory lighting did not result in any specific photooxidation products. At lower temperatures (25 and 37°C), light exposure may affect the stability of some intermediates and transitions states, influencing which degradation products form.
In Vitro Drug Release from Dexamethasone-PLGA Implants After Correction for Degradation
Chang-Lin et al. found that Ozurdex implants (0.46 mm × 6 mm; containing 0.7 mg of dexamethasone) ( ) had released > 80% of dexamethasone after 60 days in vivo and > 99% of dexamethasone after 90 days in vivo (values were estimated from Fig. 2 in their manuscript) ( ). We used a slightly smaller dexamethasone implant manufactured in-house (0.4 mm × 6 mm; containing 0.2 mg of dexamethasone) and found that ~ 80% of dexamethasone was released after 71 days of in vitro incubation at 37°C. This data was useful in building a nearly complete release profile.
When incubated in aqueous media, the PLGA-dexamethasone implants became fragile as they degraded. The fragile nature of the implant did not permit complete removal and replacement of the incubation media at each time point. Instead, 1 mL (1%) of the total incubation media was collected, and the volume was restored with 1 mL of PBS buffer. Dexamethasone that was already released into solution was also lost to degradation. These factors were accounted for when calculating the release of dexamethasone using the equations described in the methods section.
Rate constants assessed for dexamethasone in this study are of value in correcting drug release from implants for dexamethasone degradation. This principle was demonstrated using drug release data at 37°C from sample polymeric implants of dexamethasone in this study. In the implant release medium, degradation products were evident throughout the study. Dexamethasone released from dexamethasone-PLGA implants had a different distribution of degradation products than dexamethasone dissolved directly in PBS buffer (no implant) even when incubated under the same conditions. Additionally, the extent of degradation was lower in the implant group, with greater proportion of dexamethasone remaining in solution (Fig. 5 ). This result is consistent with protection of drug in the implant relative to aqueous medium. Cumulative drug release from implants increased upon correction for degradation (Fig. 6 ).
There is literature describing how PLGA implants physically degrade and release dexamethasone from dexamethasone-PLGA implants in vivo , but these papers do not discuss or account for the degradation of dexamethasone ( , ). Release and degradation of dexamethasone from PLGA-dexamethasone microspheres has been studied and reported ( , , , , , ). Although the differences in geometry between PLGA microspheres and cylindrical implants will influence release rates, the underlying chemistry should be the same.
The dexamethasone-PLGA microsphere methods used HPLC-UV for dexamethasone analysis and focused on fast elution methods. Under these conditions, either no dexamethasone degradation was reported ( ), only a single degradation peak was reported ( ), or in most cases no degradation peak was discussed but the results were still corrected for degradation implying that at least one degradation peak was observed ( , , , , ). Our LC-MS/MS method allowed us to determine degradation rates for dexamethasone under each of our incubation conditions without any interference from degradation products (Fig. 2 ). This should result in a more accurate value for the rate of dexamethasone degradation compared to rates determined with HPLC-UV analysis. In addition to the Boomer PK model, we used these rate constants to correct the release of dexamethasone from our dexamethasone-PLGA implants (Fig. 6b ) following the method initially described by Kim et al. ( ).
CONCLUSIONS
An LC-MS/MS method was developed to quantify 13 degradation products of dexamethasone in PBS. Because of the high degree of selectivity with our LC-MS/MS method, we could observe products that would otherwise be missed in a HPLC method or could appear to be dexamethasone in a fast, high-throughput HPLC method where dexamethasone and its degradation products overlap. We expect that analysis of dexamethasone ophthalmic solutions with our method would be an excellent way of determining long-term stability. Our method could easily be adapted and extended to other corticosteroids. We proposed a putative pathway for the formation of various degradation products, including compound 11, which was not previously reported in literature to our knowledge. We developed a Boomer pharmacokinetic model to correct drug levels in release medium for degradation, in order to extract actual dexamethasone release profile for a biodegradable implant. Similar measures were also made using an Excel-based approach. Such release profile determination will serve as a critical component in developing generic drug product equivalents for marketed implant drug products.
