Introduction
Toxoplasma gondii is one of the most well-studied parasites because of its medical and veterinary importance. T. gondii is a coccidian parasite with felines as the definitive host and warm-blooded animals as intermediate hosts. It is an unusual parasite because of its extremely broad host range, from birds to mammals and with only one species in the genus (Dubey ). It presents three infectious stages: the oocysts, the bradyzoites, and the tachyzoites that are linked in a complex life cycle. Toxoplasmosis is a widespread food-borne zoonosis with an important impact on public health. T. gondii ranked fourth in a global ranking of food-borne parasites and second in Europe based on a multicriteria ranking tool for scoring parasites (FAO/WHO ; Bouwknegt et al. ).
The buffalo ( Bubalus bubalis ) industry represents an important economic, mainly food-borne resource, based on their milk and meat production (Borghese ). In Europe, there are around 460,000 heads (0.25% of the global population) mainly in Italy and the Balkan countries (Romania, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Greece, Albania, Serbia) and a very low population (< 2500 breeding females/country) in other countries (UK, Germany, Hungary, Ukraine, The Netherlands, Switzerland) (Borghese ).
Romania, in spite of a constant decrease of buffalo’s population in the last 40 years, has the 2nd largest population in Europe, after Italy (Borghese ). They are still a common finding on the pastures, especially in Transylvania (North-West), where there have been historically recorded for the first time in the seventeenth century (Kos ). Buffaloes are raised mainly on small private farms in backyard system (1–5 animals) for milk and meat production, as subsistence farms. Intensive farming is limited to a national center for breeding research of buffaloes established in 1981 and 2–3 farms of around 100 animals. Calves are fattened and home slaughtered for familial consumption. The animals are kept indoor during the winter due to the unfavorable weather conditions and fed mainly with hay, and grazing on pasture in the warm season.
The epidemiological data concerning T. gondii infection in buffaloes are important from a public health point of view due to the human consumption of buffalo’s milk, dairy products ( mozzarella , etc.), and meat. Human T. gondii transmission by ruminant’s milk is unlikely since only few reports have found T. gondii in milk. Generally, milk is pasteurized or boiled (Dubey ; Dubey et al. ). In Romania, even most of the quantity of buffalo milk is used for familial consumption, it is boiled prior to consumption, or pasteurized in the dairy industry.
On contrary, the consumption of raw/undercooked meat is considered an important risk factor for human infection with T. gondii in Europe and worldwide (Belluco et al. ). Buffalo meat in comparison with beef has a lower energy yield (131 kcal vs 289 kcal every 100 g of cooked meat) and a higher concentration of protein (26.8 g vs 24.1 g). Also, it presents a lower concentration of lipid (1.8 g vs 20.7 g), especially saturated fatty acids (0.6 g vs 8.1 g), and similar iron content (2.1 mg vs 2.4 mg) (Naveena and Kiran ). Therefore, it is considered that buffalo meat has a strong potential for increased per capita consumption worldwide (Kondaiah and Anjaneyulu ). Moreover, consumption of buffalo meat seems associated with several beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk profile, including lower carotid atherosclerotic burden and susceptibility to oxidative stress (Giordano et al. ).
Buffaloes ( Bubalus bubalis ) like cattle ( Bos taurus ) belong to the same family and subfamily of Bovidae and Bovinae respectively. T. gondii antibodies are less prevalent in cattle and buffaloes comparing with other members of the Bovidae family (e.g., sheep, goat) and isolation of viable parasite from naturally infected animals was not yet reported, suggesting that they are more resistant species to T. gondii (Dubey and Thulliez ; Dubey ).
The purpose of our study was to evaluate the prevalence of T. gondii infection in buffaloes by direct (PCR and mouse bioassay) and indirect (serology) techniques in order to answer to the following questions: how is the prevalence of T. gondii in buffaloes? Do buffalo meat consumption represent a risk of toxoplasmosis for humans? Also, the correlation between direct and indirect methods of T. gondii detection was analyzed.
Material and methods
Buffaloes
In Romania, the buffalo population (Mediterranean Carpathian breed) was estimated at around 300,000 animals in 1985 and decreased gradually since, to around 20,000 animals in 2016 (Borghese ; National Institute of Statistics ).
Our study focused in the northwestern Romania, collecting samples in 5 counties: Sălaj, Cluj, Bihor, Maramureș, and Bistrița-Năsăud (Fig. 1 , Table 1 ). The estimated sample size for a population of 20,000 animals with 5% margin of error, 95% confidence level, and a 10% response distribution was 139 (Sergeant ). The animals were sampled in small private farms (1–5 buffaloes) in backyard system or in the slaughterhouse. In backyard system, blood was collected, and in the slaughterhouse, blood and tissue samples. There were sampled buffaloes in 10 villages, 1–2 animals/household, and in one farm. Households were selected based on the availability of buffaloes and to sample all three age categories. There was selected one slaughterhouse (AGRO-ARDEAL, Orheiu Bistriței) as it is one of the few authorized slaughterhouses in the region for large ruminants, and most of the buffaloes to be slaughtered are directed here. In slaughterhouse, mainly adult animals are slaughtered during winter period in low number. In order to have a representative sample size for direct detection of the T. gondii and because there a limited number of buffaloes slaughtered, we decided to sample all buffaloes that arrived in the slaughterhouse. The slaughterhouse was visited 12 times and between 4 and 8 animals were sampled each time. After, we checked the passports of the animals and we found that there were not double sampled farms.

Each animal was identified with a unique ID (number), and the information concerning the age (months), sex (male/female), origin (county), and rearing system (backyard/intensive farming) was collected. According to age, the buffaloes were divided into three age categories: buffalo calves (0–6 months), juveniles (6–30 months), and adults (> 30 months).
Sample collection
Blood samples were collected either by puncture of jugular vein or at bleeding in the slaughterhouse. Sera (1 ml/sample) were obtained after clotting and were stored at − 20 °C until processing. Tissue samples (200 g of diaphragm, 50 g of heart and liver, 5 g of mesenteric and mediastinal lymph nodes) were collected in separate bags, at slaughterhouse, for each animal. Each sample was identified based on an alphanumeric system. Diaphragm samples were stored at + 4 °C and processed within 24–48 h after sampling, while heart, liver, and lymph nodes were stored at − 20 °C until processing.
Serological assays
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
Detection of Toxoplasma gondii IgGs in buffaloes sera was performed by a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test (Chekit Toxotest Antibody ELISA, Idexx-Bommeli, Switzerland). This test detects the antibodies against T. gondii in serum and plasma samples of ruminants. The test was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, serum samples were diluted 1:400 and the results were measured as optical density percentages (OD% = (OD sample − OD negative control)/(OD positive control − OD negative control) × 100). According to manufacturer’s instructions, sera presenting an OD% higher than 30% were considered as positive, an OD% between 20 and 30% as ambiguous, and an OD% < 20% as negative.
Modified agglutination test
Buffaloes’ sera were analyzed by the modified agglutination test (MAT) (Dubey and Desmonts ) for the detection of T. gondii -specific immunoglobulin (IgG) using an antigen prepared from formalin-fixed whole RH tachyzoites, provided by the National Reference Center for Toxoplasmosis in Reims (Villena et al. ). The starting dilution was 1:6, in accordance with a previous study in cattle (Opsteegh et al. ). Eight further twofold dilutions were made, up to 1:768. To score animals positive or negative, we set up 2 cutoff values: ≥ 1:6 (Opsteegh et al. ; Burrells et al. ) and ≥ 1:96 (Dubey et al. ).
Mouse bioassay
All diaphragms collected in the slaughter were bioassayed into 6–8-week-old female CD1 mice. Briefly, each diaphragm sample (200 g) was grounded, mixed, and incubated at 37 °C for 1.5 h with trypsin (final concentration 0.25%). The suspension was then filtered, pelleted by centrifugation, washed in saline, and resuspended in a saline solution containing penicillin G/, streptomycin/amoxicillin, and ciprofloxacin/cefotaxime/vancomycin. One millilter of this homogenate was stored at − 20 °C for further use and another 1 ml was inoculated intraperitoneally into two mice (1 ml/mice). Mice were bled 6 weeks post inoculation and their serum was tested for T. gondii antibodies with the MAT technique. Furthermore, mice were killed 42 days post inoculation and their brains (olfactory lobes and media regions) were examined (2 slides with 2 spots each) for tissue cysts by light microscopy. The remaining part of the brain was mixed up to 1 ml with physiological salt and stored at − 20 °C for further use. Detailed protocol of the mouse bioassay can be found in the Appendix A of the EFSA report “Experimental studies of T. gondii in the main livestock species” (Opsteegh et al. ).
PCR assays
All tissue samples collected from buffaloes (heart, liver, mesenteric lymph nodes, mediastinal lymph nodes, diaphragm digest) and mouse brains from bioassay (homogenate with physiological salt) were submitted to a standard PCR (sPCR), nested PCR (nPCR), and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) amplification. An animal was considered positive if any of the collected samples were positive by any of the PCR techniques.
Genomic DNA extraction
Genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted from 25 mg of tissue (heart, liver, mesenteric lymph nodes, and mediastinal lymph nodes), 200 μl of diaphragm digest, and 200 μl of mouse brain homogenate, using a commercial kit (Isolate II Genomic DNA Kit, Bioline, UK), according to the manufacturer’s standard protocol for cultured cells and human or animal tissue. Genomic DNA from a known number of T . gondii (RH strain) tachyzoites (10 6 parasites) was extracted according to the same protocol and used as positive control for PCR amplification.
Standard PCR and nested PCR
All tissue samples were screened with standard PCR targeting the 529 bp DNA fragment (Homan et al. ), then by nested PCR. Three protocols of nested PCR were used: (a) targeting the ITS1 region (Vitale et al. ) (ITS1 nPCR); (b) targeting the B1 gene (Jones et al. ) (B1 nPCR); and (c) targeting the 529 bp DNA fragment (Fallahi et al. ) (529 bp nPCR). Standard PCR and nested PCRs were carried out in a 25 μl reaction mixture consisting of MyTaq Red HS Mix 2x master mix (Bioline, UK), 25 pM of primers (Table 2 ), and 4 μl of template DNA or 4 μl of first-round product in nested amplification. All amplifications were performed in Bio-Rad C1000™ Thermal Cycler. Cycling conditions for each PCR assay are presented in Table 3 .

Real-time quantitative PCR
All tissue samples were tested by the real-time qPCR targeting the RE gene (Opsteegh et al. ) by using the CFX96 Touch Real-time detection system (Bio-Rad). The 20 μl reaction mixture consisted of 0.7 μM of Tox-9F (AGGAGAGATA TCAGGACTGTAG) and Tox-11R (GCGTCGTCTCGTCTAGATCG) primers, respectively, 0.1 μM of Tox-TP1 (CCGGCTTGGCTGCTTTTCCT) probe, 10 μl of SsoAdvanced Universal Probes Supermix (Bio-Rad), and 4 μl of template DNA. The reaction was performed according to the protocol described by Opsteegh et al. ( ). The standard curve and the estimation of PCR efficiency (> 1.85) and error (< 0.05) were calculated with inclusion of T. gondii DNA standard dilutions in reaction (from 30 pg to 30 fg). Samples that show a smooth exponential-amplification curve and presented a positive Cp value (< 35) were scored positive.
Gel electrophoresis
PCR products from sPCR and nPCR (8 μl) were electrophoresed in 1.5% agarose gel in TAE buffer and stained with SYBR® Safe DNA gel stain (Invitrogen). Electrophoresis conditions were 100 V and 400 mA for 30 min in TAE buffer. DNA fragments were visualized under UV light on an image analyzer (Bio-Rad BioDoc-It™ Imaging System) and compared to a 100 bp molecular weight marker (GeneRuler 100 bp DNA Ladder, Fermentas).
Statistical analysis
Frequency, apparent prevalence, and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for each method of detection. The chi-square test was used for comparison of the frequencies by age category, gender (male and female), and rearing system (backyard and intensive farming). Logistic regression analysis was performed to quantify the association between the presence of T. gondii antibodies and risk factors (age, gender, and rearing system). The risk factors remained in the logistic regression analysis if the goodness of fit of the model was significant ( p ≤ 0.05).
A p value of ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis was performed with EpiInfo 2000 software (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: http://wwwn.cdc.gov/epiinfo/ ).
The degree of agreement between serological methods (ELISA and MAT) and between indirect (ELISA, MAT) and direct (bioassay, PCRs) methods was measured by Cohen’s kappa ( k ) statistic in EpiTools (Watson and Petrie ; Sergeant ). Also, proportions of positive and negative agreement were calculated. The level of confidence was set at 0.95 and population status as unknown/mixed. The strength of agreement was defined based on the k value: < 0.00 poor agreement; 0.00–0.20 slight agreement; 0.21–0.40 fair agreement; 0.41–0.60 moderate agreement; 0.61–0.80 substantial agreement; and 0.81–1.00 almost perfect agreement (Landis and Koch ).
Results
Collected samples
In total, 197 animals were sampled in backyard system ( n = 123) or in the slaughterhouse ( n = 74). The sampled population represented 0.98% from total population of buffaloes in 2016 in Romania (National Institute of Statistics ).
Animals originated from 5 counties of Transylvania: Sălaj, Cluj, Bihor, Maramureș, and Bistrița-Năsăud (Fig. 1 , Table 1 ). Most of the samples ( n = 136) were collected in Sălaj county. The number of sampled animals per county reflects the population size of buffaloes in these counties. The ages of the animals varied from 2 weeks up to 300 months (25 years), with an average of 84.4 ± 77.6 months (7 ± 6.5 years). According to the age, the samples were collected from 25 buffalo calves (0–6 months; average 5.0 ± 1.6 months), 52 juveniles (6–30 months; average 17.6 ± 8.3 months), and 120 adults (˃ 30 months; average 129.9 ± 67.2 months). Most of the sampled animals were raised in backyard conditions (166/197; 84.3%) and were females (172/197; 87.3%) (Table 1 ).
Serology
One hundred ninety-seven sera were tested for specific IgG detection by ELISA and MAT techniques. IgG antibodies against T. gondii were detected by MAT in 16 (8.1%) buffaloes when the cutoff was 1:6 and only in 3 buffaloes (1.5%) at a cutoff of 1:96 (Tables 4 and 5 ). The highest titer (1:768) was obtained in a juvenile female (30-month-old) buffalo (Table 5 ). By ELISA, 13 (6.6%) animals had T. gondii antibodies (Table 4 ). Table 4 Frequency and prevalence of T. gondii antibodies, in sera collected from buffaloes, as detected by ELISA, MAT, and overall serology, stratified by age category, gender, and rearing system MAT ≥ 1:6 MAT ≥ 1:96 ELISA Frequency Prevalence (95% CI) p Frequency Prevalence (95% CI) p Frequency Prevalence (95% CI) p Age category Calves ( n = 25) 0 0 (0.0–13.3) 0.02 0 0 (0.0–13.3) 0.80 1 4.0 (0.7–2.0) 0.78 Juveniles ( n = 52) 1 1.9 (0.3–10.1) 1 1.9 (0.3–10.1) 3 5.8 (2.0–15.6) Adults ( n = 120) 15 12.5 (7.7–19.6) 2 1.7 (0.2–5.9) 9 7.5 (4.0–13.6) Gender Males ( n = 25) 0 0 (0.0–13.3) 0.23 0 0 (0.0–13.3) 0.83 1 4.0 (0.1–20.4) 0.89 Females ( n = 172) 16 9.3 (5.4–14.7) 3 1.7 (0.4–5.0) 12 7.0 (3.7–11.9) Rearing system Backyard ( n = 166) 12 7.2 (3.8–12.3) 0.48 3 1.8 (0.4–5.2) 0.96 13 7.8 (4.2–13.0) 0.22 Intensive farming ( n = 31) 4 12.9 (3.6–29.8) 0 0 (0.0–11.2) 0 0 (0.0–11.0) Total ( n = 197) 16 8.1 (4.7–12.9) 3 1.5 (0.3–4.4) 13 6.6 (3.6–11.0) Table 5 Sera dilution at MAT in positive buffaloes by age category and total Titers Calves Juveniles Adults Total 1:24 0/25 0/52 8/120 8/197 1:48 0/25 0/52 5/120 5/197 1:96 0/25 0/52 2/120 2/197 1:768 0/25 1/52 0/120 1/197 Total 0/25 1/52 15/120 16/197
The agreement between MAT and ELISA was fair (cutoff ≥ 1:6 k = 0.219; cutoff ≥ 1:96 k = 0.36), regardless of the MAT cutoff value. The proportion of positive agreement was fair (0.28 and 0.38 respectively), while the proportion of negative agreement was almost perfect (0.94 and 0.97 respectively).
The apparent seroprevalence was significantly ( p = 0.02) higher in adults (12.5%) compared to calves (0.0%) and juveniles (1.9%) by MAT ≥ 1:6. The apparent seroprevalence was not significantly different by gender and rearing system. It was found that adults are 2.73 (OR 95% CI 0.74–10.0) more likely to present antibodies against T. gondii , comparing with juveniles ( p = 0.05).
Bioassay
Seventy-four bioassays were performed, corresponding to the animals collected in the slaughterhouse. No T. gondii -specific IgGs were detected by MAT technique in mice sera ( n = 148). No T. gondii tissue cysts were identified by the light microscopy examination of the olfactory lobes and media regions of the mouse’s brain ( n = 148). The PCR amplifications (sPCR, nPCR, and qPCR) of the mice’ brain homogenate displayed negative results. There was no agreement between indirect methods and bioassay detection of T. gondii in buffaloes.
PCRs
All tissue samples collected from buffaloes (heart, liver, mesenteric lymph nodes, mediastinal lymph nodes, and diaphragm digest) were submitted to a standard PCR (sPCR), nested PCR (nPCR), and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) amplification. T. gondii DNA was detected in 2 out of 74 animals (2.7%; 95% CI 0.33–9.42): a 252-month (21 years)-old female buffalo in mesenteric lymph node by RE nPCR and in a 30-month (2.5 years)-old male buffalo in diaphragm digest by real-time qPCR. All other PCR assays or samples gave negative results. There was no agreement between indirect methods and PCR detection since positive animals in nPCR and qPCR were seronegative in both methods (MAT regardless of the cutoff value and ELISA).
Discussion
Surveys of T. gondii in buffaloes were reported worldwide, in countries where buffaloes represent an important component of the national livestock (Supplementary files 1 and 2 ). Worldwide, T. gondii seroprevalence in buffaloes is generally low (< 25.0%), whatever method was used (DAT, IFAT, IHAT, LAT, MAT, ELISA). Higher seroprevalence was reported in local studies from Turkey, Egypt, Mexico, and Brazil (Supplementary file 1 ). In these studies, a faulty technique might have been employed or there is indeed an intense circulation of the parasite in those areas (due to specific environmental conditions like felid densities and climatic specificities). Similarly, the apparent overall seroprevalence of T. gondii in buffaloes from northwestern Romania is low regardless of the test used. However, the agreement between MAT and ELISA was fair (0.28), similarly to the poor agreement obtained in cattle for the same techniques (Opsteegh et al. ). The apparent seroprevalence was significantly higher in adults than in calves and young buffaloes. The uptake of T. gondii oocysts from grasslands for a longer period of time is the most logical explanation. Age has already been significantly correlated with the seropositivity to T. gondii either in water buffaloes (Persad et al. ; Santos et al. ; Ahmad and Qayyum ) or in other species (Dubey ; Opsteegh et al. ). However, the highest dilution in MAT (1:768), correlated with high titers of IgG antibodies, was obtained in a juvenile (30 months old), most of the adults (13/15) presenting low titers. Most of the authors report low titers of antibodies in buffaloes (Supplementary file 1 ). In an experimental study in buffaloes, early serological response was noticed but not marked, followed by an early decline, even below a significant level after 56 days post infection (Gautam et al. ). The seroprevalence was not significantly different by gender and rearing system in our study, while divergent results were obtained elsewhere: male prevalence higher than females (Hamidinejat et al. ), semi-intensive and extensive farming identified as risk factors for increased seroprevalence in Pakistan and Brazil (Ahmad and Qayyum ; Brasil et al. ). The most probable hypothesis to explain these differences among studies would be the management practices: (i) the females/males are more out on the pastures (possible sources of T. gondii infection) and (ii) there is no real management difference between the two rearing systems. In our case, the female buffaloes are more frequently on pasture and the intensive farming is mostly limited to 40–50 animals (Borghese ).
Most of the studies concerning T. gondii in buffaloes were focusing on specific IgG antibody detection, while few of them ( n = 3) were interested in direct detection of parasite by PCR techniques and none, as far as we know, by (cat or mouse) bioassay (Supplementary files 1 and 2 ). In this study, along with ELISA and MAT, several PCR techniques (standard PCR, nPCR, and qPCR) and mouse bioassay on various tissues (diaphragm, heart, liver, mesenteric and mediastinal lymph nodes) were employed in order to identify T. gondii DNA or tissue cysts. We used a variety of direct detection techniques in order to overcome the lack of sensitivity of these methods, which has been observed in cattle (Opsteegh et al. , ). For the same reason, we used a sensu large positive case definition: an animal was considered positive if any of the collected samples were positive by any of the PCR techniques. Nonetheless, this resulted in only 2 PCR-positive buffaloes.
T. gondii DNA was detected in two different animals (a 30-month-old male and a 252-month-old female), in only one distinct tissue (diaphragm digest and mesenteric lymph node), by different PCR techniques (qPCR and 529 bp nPCR). Gautam et al. ( ) found in experimental infection that mesenteric lymph nodes are the most consistently parasitized tissue (3/8) and they did not isolate the parasite from diaphragm. Anyway, the authors isolated the parasite from mesenteric lymph nodes after 11–32 days post infection and not later (Gautam et al. ). All other PCR assays or samples from these 2 buffaloes gave negative results. The results of these PCR assays do not overlap at all, except for the negative ones. The observed discordance might be explained by a non-homogenous distribution of T. gondii within an animal carcass in terms of tissue distribution or parasitic load. Similarly, in an experimental study performed in calves, T. gondii was detected by either MC-qPCR or mouse bioassay in pools of tissues, but failed to detect the parasite DNA in all individual tissues (Burrells et al. ). Also, earlier studies indicated that T. gondii persists for short term in the tissues of the experimentally infected buffaloes (Gautam et al. ).
Moreover, the two buffaloes were serologically negative in both indirect detection methods (ELISA and MAT). Similar results were found in bovines, where seronegative animals were giving a positive amplification by PCR, demonstrating that seroprevalence cannot be used as an indicator of the number of cattle and buffaloes carrying infectious parasites (Opsteegh et al. ; Opsteegh et al. ). This may indicate that only recent T. gondii infections are detectable by PCR in cattle and buffaloes. Apparently, contradictory results were found by Hassanain et al. ( ) in buffaloes, pointing out that 2/11 (18.2%) of the ELISA-positive buffaloes were found positive by PCR on blood; however, no PCR was run on serological negative samples.
Up to now, direct detection of T. gondii in buffaloes was performed in three studies (Supplementary file 2 ) and it was limited to PCR from milk (3.7% positive results) or blood (18.2–22.0% positive results) (Chaudhary et al. ; Dehkordi et al. ; Hassanain et al. ). The prevalence of T. gondii DNA detection in present study (2.7%) is much lower than previous studies but close to what is generally reported in bovines (1.6%, Opsteegh et al. ; 1.79%, Hosein et al. ). One explanation for this lower prevalence might be the geographical area of studies: in Europe, the T. gondii prevalence in bovines is much lower than in Asia or South America (Belluco et al. ), so the situation may be similar for buffaloes.
Also, negative results were obtained in mouse bioassay (MAT, PCR, and microscopic examination of brains), regardless of the corresponding buffaloes’ serology or PCR result. Even the two mice that were inoculated with a T. gondii DNA-positive diaphragm digest did not seroconvert 6 weeks p.i. This might indicate the presence of T. gondii parasite in diaphragm tissue, in a non-infectious form. One should keep in mind however that due to economic reasons, the bioassay was performed only on diaphragm and on two mice. Since predilection sites in buffaloes are not known, a comparison of various tissues tested by bioassay would be more informative.
Detection of specific antibodies in sera may indicate the presence of infectious parasites within the host and therefore a potential risk of infection in humans by undercooked meat consumption. However, this is true only if there is a good correlation between antibody detection and the presence of T. gondii tissue cysts in various tissues. In our study, the seropositive samples were negative in direct detection tests, and the other way around, so overall, there was no agreement between detection methods of T. gondii in buffaloes. Therefore, both MAT and the Chekit Toxotest ELISA appear unsuitable to obtain an estimate of the prevalence of T. gondii in buffaloes. Moreover, in the 74 buffaloes tested by mouse bioassay, no viable T. gondii was detected; therefore, it is questionable whether there is a risk for consumers.
In conclusion, since no viable T. gondii was detected in buffaloes, the risk of human infection from buffalo meat is minimal. The same conclusion was pointed out by Gautam and co-workers in 1982 after an experimental infection with T. gondii in buffaloes. Buffaloes’ biological response to a T. gondii infection appears to be very similar to another Bovinae subfamily member, the cattle, which raise questions about the evolution of parasite carriage over the course of the lifetime of animals.
