Introduction
Inotropic and chronotropic agents are used clinically to manage cardiovascular diseases such as congestive heart failure, arrhythmia and angina pectoris. They regulate cardiac contractile function and heart rate to restore cardiac output, which is severely compromised in heart failure and cardiac arrhythmia. Examples of inotropic and chronotropic agents are calcium channel modulator, beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists and phosphodiesterase inhibitors [ , ]. In the recent years, there is a plethora of studies reporting cardiovascular benefits of phytonutrition, in particular the polyphenols in both prophylaxis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. For instance, wine-derived polyphenol, resveratrol, reverses remodeling and improves inotropic function in rodent model of heart failure [ ]. Supplementation with 162 mg/day quercetin from onion skin extract lowers 24-h systolic BP by −3.6 mmHg in patients with hypertension, suggesting cardioprotective effect of polyphenol [ ]. A new cardiovascular agent with fewer side effects and comparable efficacy, derived from natural sources, might thus benefit the health-care professionals in managing patients with conditions of hypertension, angina pectoris and cardiac arrhythmias.
Roselle ( Hibiscus sabdariffa L.) calyces are traditionally used in folk medicine for diuresis and hypertension [ ]. It is now commonly consumed in Malaysia as a daily beverage. Several studies have documented antihypertensive effects of roselle in vivo [ ] and in clinical trials [ , ]. Roselle also demonstrated vasodilatory action in high K + and phenylephrine-precontracted aortic rings in vitro [ ]. Furthermore, oral consumption of roselle enhanced cardiac Na + –K + -ATPase and Ca 2+ –Mg 2+ -ATPase activities in a rat model of hypertension [ ]. These preliminary findings suggested that roselle is capable of reducing blood pressure and thus may also affect cardiac mechanics.
Roselle calyx is enriched with polyphenolic compounds with excellent bioavailability and antioxidant activity such as chlorogenic acid, quercetin and hydroxycitric acid [ ]. H. sabdariffa polyphenol-enriched (74 %) extract was able to reduce plasma cholesterol dose dependently and more efficaciously than crude aqueous extract [ ]. Moreover, in vitro evidence has shown that polyphenols isolated from H. sabdariffa exert antiarteriosclerotic activity by inhibiting vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration [ ]. Another study showed that intervention with H. sabdariffa polyphenols in patients suffering from metabolic syndromes improved their serum level of inflammatory markers and leptin, indicating the benefits of H. sabdariffa polyphenols in overweight-induced metabolic alterations [ ].
In light of these findings, we designed the present ex vivo study to investigate the effect of RP on cardiac inotropic and chronotropic function and to explore the possible pharmacological mechanisms.
Materials and Methods
Chemicals and Reagents
Urethane, (±)-Bay K8644 (Bay K8644, L-type calcium channel agonist), 4-chloro- m -cresol (4-CmC, ryanodine receptor agonist), thapsigargin (TH, sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ ATPase blocker), isoproterenol (ISO, β-adrenergic agonist) and sodium nitrite (NaNO 2 ) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA.
Extraction of Roselle Polyphenols
Hibiscus sabdariffa calyces (specimen voucher: UKMB 40308) were collected from a local plantation in Terengganu, Malaysia. The calyces were washed to remove any contaminants, dried in oven at 50 °C and then crushed in a mortar and pestle. Roselle polyphenols were then extracted as described by [ ]. In brief, five grams of dried H. sabdariffa calyx powder was extracted with 50 mL of HPLC-grade methanol and stirred in 60 °C water bath for 30 min. The extract was then filtered through Whatman no. 4 filter papers. The filtered residue was extracted twice with the same procedure, after which the extracts were pooled together and evaporated to dryness. The extract residue was solubilized in 10 mL of deionized water (adjusted to pH 2.3 with 0.1 N HCl) and partitioned successively with n -hexane (3 × 10 mL) and ethyl acetate (3 × 10 mL). The ethyl acetate soluble fraction was evaporated to dryness using a rotary evaporator (Buchi, Switzerland). RP was stored at −20 °C until further experiments.
Chemical Analysis of RP
HPLC–MS-ToF analysis was conducted to identify the polyphenols presents in RP. Chromatography was performed on a Ultimate ® 3000 HPLC system (Dionex Corporation, Sunnyvale, California, USA), equipped with a vacuum degasser, a temperature controlled autosampler, a binary loading pump, a dual binary gradient pump and a diode array detector (DAD). The column used for the chromatographic separation was a Phenomenex Luna C18(2) analytical column (5 μm particle size, 250 mm × 2 mm) (USA). The conditions consisted of a gradient elution using 0.1 % formic acid as mobile phase A and acetonitrile as phase B at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. The following gradient was applied: 0–25 min, 10 % B; 25–50 min, 20 % B; 50–60 min, 80 % B; 60–65 min, 95 % B and then returned to 10 % B in 5 min, with 10 μL of sample injected. The phenolics eluted and separated were further identified with micrOTOF-Q (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) equipped with an ESI interface operating in both positive and negative ion mode. The operating parameters in negative ionization mode were as follows: capillary voltage of 3.5 kV; tube lens offset, −500 V; dry gas temperature, 190 °C; dry gas flow, 8.0 L/min; nebulizer pressure, 4.0 bar; spectra rate 1 Hz. In the positive ionization analyses, capillary voltage of 4 kV; tube lens offset, −500 V; dry gas temperature, 190 °C; dry gas flow, 8.0 l/min; nebulizer pressure, 4.0 bar; spectra rate 1 Hz were used. The flow delivered into the MS detector. Mass spectra were acquired with a scan range of 20–1000 m/z, with 5 microscans and a maximum ion injection time of 200 ms. All data were processed with Data Analysis 3.4 software (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany).
Animals
Male Sprague – Dawley rats (12–14 weeks old) were purchased from Synertec Scientific, Malaysia. All animals were fed with standard rodent diet and tap water ad libitum. They were housed under same laboratory conditions with ambient room temperature and lighting (12-h light–dark cycle) and were allowed to adapt for 7 days prior to the experiment. All protocols were approved by the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Animal Ethics Committee.
Langendorff-Perfused Rat Hearts
Rats were injected with heparin (500 IU, i.p.) as anticoagulant prior to urethane (1 g/kg, i.p.) anesthesia. Upon loss of pedal reflex activity, thoracic surgery was performed to rapidly excise the heart. Isolated heart was then placed in ice-cold perfusion buffer and immediately cannulated via aorta to Langendorff apparatus. The hearts were perfused with Krebs–Henseleit buffer (in mM: NaCl 118.0; KCl 3.2; MgSO 4 1.2; NaHCO 3 25.0; NaH 2 PO 4 1.18; CaCl 2 2.5; glucose 11.1) at constant flow (10 mL/min) and 37 °C (Langendorff isolated heart system, ADInstruments, Australia). A water-filled latex balloon connected to a pressure transducer was inserted through the mitral valve into the left ventricle to record intraventricular pressure changes and heart rate. Left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP), left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP), maximal rates of pressure development and fall (d P /d t max and d P /d t min ) were derived from left ventricle pressure. The hearts were excluded from experiments when LVDP <80 mmHg or heart rate <220 beats/min at baseline. Cardiac parameters were assessed using a PowerLab data acquisition system and analyzed using chart software (LabChart 7.0, ADInstruments, Australia). Cumulative concentration response of RR (125–2000 μg/mL) toward cardiac beating response was evaluated and expressed as percentage of prior RP addition.
Cardiac Injury Markers in Coronary Effluent
To determine safe concentration range for RP, coronary effluents were collected before and after addition of RP in the perfusate for 5 min. LDH activity was assayed in effluent spectrophotometrically as described by [ ]. In addition, troponin-T level was also measured using a commercially available kit (Rat cTn-T ELISA Kit, Cusabio).
Effects of RP on Langendorff-Perfused Rat Hearts
After 20 min of stabilization, cardiac inotropic response was first validated by perfusion with a positive inotropic drug (isoprenaline, 1 nM) and a negative inotropic drug (sodium nitrite, 100 μM). After washout, RP was then cumulatively (from 125 to 2000 μg/mL) added to the perfusate at 10-min intervals. Changes in cardiac contractile function and heart rate were compared against time-matched controls. RP concentrations were chosen in reference to bioavailability studies by [ ]. EC 50 value for RP was then calculated and used for further studies.
To investigate involvement of calcium channel inhibitory mechanisms in RP-induced functional changes, the rat hearts were perfused with either (±)-Bay K8644 (Bay K8644, 17.3 nM), a L-type calcium channel (LTCC) agonist, 4-chloro- m -cresol (4-CmC, 1 μM), a ryanodine receptor (RyR) agonist or thapsigargin (TH, 1 μM), a sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ ATPase (SERCA) blocker for 10 min prior to addition of RP. Similarly, the hearts were perfused with isoproterenol (ISO, 1 nM), a beta 1–2-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) agonist prior to addition of RP to characterize involvement of beta-adrenergic inhibition. All responses were compared against vehicle-perfused hearts.
Statistical Analysis
All data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software 6.0, San Diego) and expressed as mean ± SEM. Significance level of the data was determined at p < 0.05 using independent t test, multiple t test and one-way ANOVA, whereever needed.

Functional Effects of RP on Langendorff-Perfused Rat Hearts
Baseline values for Langendorff rat hearts are shown in Table 2 . RP was able to induce negative inotropic and chronotropic responses, as shown by a significant decrease in LVDP (Fig. 3 a; p < 0.05) and HR (Fig. 3 b; p < 0.05), in parallel with a significant decrease in d P /d t max (Fig. 3 c; p < 0.05). In addition, RP elicited positive lusitropic by significantly increasing d P /d t min (Fig. 3 d; p < 0.05) and LVEDP (Fig. 3 e; p < 0.05). Figure 3 f shows that RP caused a sustained increase in CP ( p < 0.05), suggestive of vasodilation in coronary arteries. Values for E max and EC 50 for functional effects of RP are shown in Table 3 . Further studies were carried out using 500 µg/mL RP due to the maximal effects observed.

Effects of RP on extracellular Ca2+ entry, SR Ca2+ Release and Reuptake in Langendorff-Perfused Rat Hearts
To define the roles of extracellular Ca 2+ entry and SR Ca 2+ release in the RP-induced decrease in LVDP, agonists of LTCC (Bay K8644) and RyR (4-CmC) were used. We also used SERCA blocker TH to determine the pharmacological involvement of RP in sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca 2+ reuptake. All these drugs significantly increased, when assessed alone, cardiac inotropism which was abolished by RP (Fig. 4 a–c; p < 0.05). These findings indicate that LTCC, RyR and SERCA are involved in the RP-induced negative inotropic effect. Fig. 4 Effect of a (±)-Bay K 8644, b 4-chloro- m -cresol, c thapsigargin and d isoproterenol on the RP-induced decrease in left ventricle developed pressure.

Effects of RP on Beta-Adrenergic Receptor Activation
Isoproterenol was used to determine the roles of the β-adrenergic receptors in RP-induced negative inotropic effects. Perfusion with RP significantly antagonized positive inotropic effect of ISO (Fig. 4 d; p < 0.05). This finding suggests that RP-mediated negative inotropic effects involve beta-adrenergic receptor.
Discussion
In this study, we have shown that roselle polyphenols affect cardiac performance by modulating contractility and heart beat in isolated Langendorff-perfused rat heart. In fact, RP elicited a concomitant, concentration-dependent negative inotropic and chronotropic response as shown by decreased LVDP, dP/dt max and HR. Furthermore, we have shown that the RP-induced positive lusitropism as indicated by changes in LVEDP and d P /d t min .
Studies in isolated heart have several advantages, but they should be interpreted in light of several methodological limitations. In general, isolated preparations are lacking of the compensatory mechanisms associated with adequate blood flow and circulating catecholamine. However, it is considered as the best tool for pharmacological preliminary studies. Besides, the isolated heart is a constantly deteriorating preparation over time. Therefore, we have used a time-match control against RP perfusion to rectify the biological effects. There are limited past studies investigating the mechanism of action of RP in functioning heart preparations. A recent study has reported the effect of both negative inotropic and chronotropic action of H. sabdariffa aqueous extract in isolated atria [ ]. Extract characterization suggests these cardiac effects could be attributed to hibiscus acid, the main phenolic acid present in H. sabdariffa calyx. Another study reported on cardiac effect of H. sabdariffa seed extract in isolated rabbit heart, in which interaction between the extract and adrenaline suggests the negative inotropy achieved through antagonistic action on the beta-adrenergic receptor [ ].
There are several cardiac receptor/channel systems involved in the regulation of myocardial inotropic function such as sodium, calcium and potassium channels. It is possible that the negative inotropic action of RP in the whole heart could relate to an action on intracellular Ca 2+ handling within ventricular cardiomyocytes. A maximal inhibition of 66 % in depolarization-induced opening of voltage-dependent Ca 2+ channels (VDCC) and suppressed voltage-dependent Ca 2+ entry was reported with ferulic acid (a hydroxycinnamic acid found in roselle) [ ]. Vasorelaxation in isolated rat coronary artery showed calcium inhibitory action by flavonoids such as quercetin and hesperetin via inhibited extracellular Ca 2+ influx-induced contraction, reduced intracellular free Ca 2+ concentration and inhibited inward Ca 2+ currents through VDCC [ , ].
RP-mediated inotropism could be via indirect inactivation of calcium channels by nitric oxide (NO). Evidence from the literature suggests that H. sabdariffa activate phosphoinositol-3-kinase (PI3 K) pathway in endothelium [ ], which is capable of upregulating NO synthesis via phosphorylation of eNOS [ ]. Previous study has reported the impact of NO signaling on calcium influx. Nitric oxide when produced in large amounts inhibits agonist-induced Ca 2+ responses independently of cyclic GMP [ ]. In addition, nitric oxide derived from S-nitroso- N -acetyl-penicillamine (SNAP, NO donor) inhibits stimulated L-type calcium current in patient with atrial fibrillation [ ]. Nitric oxide (in a cGMP-independent mechanism) suppressed spontaneous Ca 2+ -release events in isolated cardiac myocytes, which was clearly due to an NO-induced decrease in RyR activity [ ].
Lusitropism pertains to the rate and degree of myocyte relaxation. The rate and extent of lusitropy depend mainly on the ability of the cardiomyocyte to lower intracellular Ca 2+ concentration from [ ]. In cardiomyocytes, SERCA is responsible for 75–92 % reuptake of intracellular Ca 2+ into SR storage immediately after contraction, hence a major determinant in lusitropy [ ]. Data from our present study depicted that RP perfusion attenuated the inhibitory action of SERCA blocker thapsigargin and modulate d P /d t min , which showed the potential of RP in modulating diastolic function. Notably, similar result was previously reported by [ ] in which wine polyphenol resveratrol treatment enhanced the levels of SERCA2 and the ratio of SERCA2 to phospholamban (SERCA regulatory protein), prevented the decreased SERCA activity caused by aortic banding-induced pressure overload. In addition, accelerated relaxation and Ca 2+ transient decay by dietary phenolic acid ellagic acid were completely inhibited by cyclopiazonic acid, which indicates that ellagic acid was indeed acting on SERCA [ ].
Ca 2+ signaling refers to the release and reuptake of intracellular Ca 2+ that determine cardiac muscle contractile function. The abnormalities of cell function due to Ca 2+ overload impact both electrical and mechanical function of the heart. Recent evidence by [ ] reported defective Ca 2+ leak from SR storage via type 2 ryanodine receptors (RyR2) plays a fundamental role in the pathophysiology of mitochondrial Ca 2+ overload, resulting in diastolic dysfunction and fatal cardiac arrhythmias in a murine model of postmyocardial infarction heart failure. Calcium overload also manifested in myocardial ischemia–reperfusion injury model. Increased Ca 2+ accumulation could be augmented by ischemia-induced depolarization of the membrane potential, which allows opening of the LTCC and excessive Ca 2+ entry into the cell. The ischemia-induced calcium overload hypothesis was further proved by benidipine, a LTCC blocker, improved cardiac functional recovery after reperfusion and decreased myocardial apoptosis [ ]. Manipulation of intracellular calcium level by modulating calcium channels can therefore prevent cardiac mechanical dysfunction and reduce cardiovascular-related death.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we demonstrated that RP directly elicited negative inotropic, negative chronotropic and positive lusitropic effects. We also demonstrated that RP-mediated negative inotropism is probably mediated via inhibition of extracellular Ca 2+ entry through LTCC, attenuation SR Ca 2+ release via RyR, activation of SERCA to facilitate Ca 2+ reuptake into SR storage and blockade of beta-adrenergic activation (Fig. 5 ). In spite of the coronary artery vasodilation, polyphenols from roselle could be an efficacious alternative for dihydropyridine class of calcium channel blockers and beta blockers in managing conditions involving defective calcium overload such as ischemia-induced angina pectoris and arrhythmia.

Calcium regulatory channels and receptor were activated by agonist ( arrow ) or inhibited by antagonist ( light vertical and left ). Roselle polyphenols probably elicit pharmacological intervention on intracellular Ca 2+ regulatory channels and receptors, through inhibition of ( minus enclosed with circle ) β-ADR, LTCC and RyR and stimulation of ( plus enclosed with circle ) SERCA, resulting in depleted intracellular Ca 2+ level which contributes toward RP-induced negative inotropic action.
