Introduction
Immune checkpoint inhibitors, including cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors, are now considered first-line treatment for advanced melanoma patients. PD-1 inhibitors, in particular, are also successful in treating a myriad of other tumor types, including non-small cell lung cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, and Hodgkin lymphoma [ , , , ].
CTLA-4 acts by blocking co-stimulatory signals required for T-cell activation, thereby preventing self-reactive T-cell responses and ultimately promoting peripheral tolerance of tumor antigens. CTLA-4 inhibitors, like ipilimumab, result in non-specific T-cell activation and anti-tumor immune responses [ ]. PD-1 is a major regulator of chronically activated T-cells, as it is induced on both CD4 + and CD8 + T-cells. PD-L1 and PD-L2, the ligands of the PD-1 receptor, are expressed on many types of cancers, including 31–44% of melanomas [ , ]. Binding of PD-1 to its physiologic ligands, PD-L1 or PD-L2, suppresses the activation and function of T-cells through recruitment of downstream signaling molecules that ultimately facilitate immune evasion of tumor cells [ ]. The PD-1 inhibitors nivolumab and pembrolizumab predominantly act to reverse the suppression of anti-tumor T-cells, thus potentiating anti-tumor immune responses [ ].
Thorough descriptions of the adverse effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors are of paramount importance given their widespread utility in cancer therapy. Immune-related adverse events (iRAEs) are common and reported to affect nearly every organ in the body, ranging from non-specific thyroiditis, pneumonitis, and dermatitis, to other autoimmune conditions [ , ]. Sarcoidosis-like granulomas (SLGs) are non-caseating epithelioid granulomas found in the absence of systemic sarcoidosis, and are one type of iRAE reported in patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Formation of SLGs is clinically significant as they can simulate disease recurrence, leading to cessation of potentially life-saving immunotherapy. To highlight this important iRAE and to explore its potential etiology, we report results from a Prisma-guided systematic review of cases of SLGs induced by CTLA-4 and PD-1 inhibitors including a case from our institution.
Methods
In accordance with PRISMA guidelines, PubMed was searched through February 4, 2019 without time and language restrictions. Keyword search terms are presented in Tables 1 , 2 , and 3 . All study types were included in the data search. Additional studies were obtained from reviewing the references of relevant studies. From the search, 88 records were identified and 54 original studies were reviewed for study eligibility after duplicate records were removed (Fig. 1 ). Only sarcoidosis-like adverse effects occurring in cancer patients treated with a CTLA-4 inhibitor, a PD-1 inhibitor, or a combination of both were included. Data extracted from eligible studies included patient demographics, including age and sex, type of cancer, type of checkpoint inhibitor used and dosage, time to SLG onset, affected organs, management, clinical outcomes, and time to resolution, if applicable.

Results
We identified a total of 55 SLG cases, including one case from our institution. Tables 1 , 2 , and 3 summarize the demographics and clinical characteristics of patients with SLGs [ , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ]. The mean age of patients was 58 years (range 26–81 years). Of the cases reporting sex, 53% occurred in men. Of the 55 cases, only one patient was reported to have a known history of sarcoidosis prior to treatment and development of SLGs. The underlying cancers included: melanoma (78%), lung cancer (11%), Hodgkin lymphoma (4%), uterine leiomyosarcoma (2%), gallbladder cancer (2%), renal cell carcinoma (2%), and prostate cancer (2%). Of the SLG cases, 45% occurred in patients receiving PD-1 inhibitors, 27% occurred in patients receiving sequential or combination PD-1/CTLA-4 inhibitors, and 27% occurred in patients receiving CTLA-4 inhibitors. In the 29 cases reporting time from initiating immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment to SLG development, the mean was 8.7 months (range 0.75–22.5 months).
SLGs most commonly involved the lymph nodes, lungs, and skin; less commonly, the central nervous system, pituitary gland, spleen, and bone were affected. Lymph node SLGs were observed in 71% of cases. Lung involvement was observed in 60% of cases and included bilateral parenchymal patchy ground glass opacities with septal thickening, as exemplified in our patient (Fig. 2 a–c). Cutaneous findings were noted in 54.5% of cases and included subcutaneous nodules, most commonly, as well as skin-colored papules and plaques on the face, neck, and arms [ , ]. Ocular findings occurred in four patients and included dry-eye syndrome, acute iritis, retinochoroiditis, and panuveitis with multifocal choroiditis [ , , , ]. Brain involvement included neurologic symptoms that prompted MRI imaging revealing leptomeningeal enhancement with adjacent areas of parenchymal enhancement in three patients [ , , ]. Spleen and bone SLG involvement were rare, noted in one patient each. Fig. 2 Sarcoidosis-like granuloma in our melanoma patient on pembrolizumab. a Scanning magnification.

In 22% of SLG cases, there was initial concern for tumor progression upon patient presentation; the SLGs were ultimately confirmed by biopsies. To treat the SLGs, most patients required discontinuation of therapy completely or for a short period of time as well as immunosuppressant treatment. In cases where outcomes were reported (89%), resolution occurred within a mean of 4 months (range 0.5–24 months), and the SLGs resolved in all but nine patients. Of the patients with SLGs that resolved, 41% resolved with a brief holiday or full discontinuation of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy alone; 41% resolved with a brief holiday or full discontinuation of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy and steroids (or additional immunosuppressant therapy); 5% resolved with steroids alone; and 13% resolved with no treatment. Topical and intralesional steroids were required for resolution of cutaneous SLGs in four cases. Ocular findings in two patients required treatment with oral corticosteroids and topical corticosteroid eye drops. In two cases of CNS SLGs, increased steroid dosage and duration as well as additional immunosuppressants including infliximab and methotrexate were required to achieve resolution of neurological symptoms and MRI changes.
Discussion
Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease characterized by a hyperactive T helper-1 (Th-1) immune response that results in the formation of non-caseating granulomas in addition to bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. The etiology of sarcoidosis remains unclear, though the Th-1 predominant immune response is thought to be initiated by the phagocytic response of CD4 + Th-1 cells encountering foreign antigens [ ]. The subsequent adaptive immune response that ensues prompts the release of Th-1-specific pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interferon-γ (IFN-γ), interleukin (IL)-2, IL-12, IL-18, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF- α) [ ]. Ultimately, the Th-1-predominant cytokine profile is the stimulus for subsequent macrophage aggregation and activation, the hallmarks of granulomatous inflammation. The activated macrophages within the pro-inflammatory cytokine milieu additionally serve to recruit IL-17-producing T helper-17 (Th-17) cells. Increased IL-17 is reported in sarcoidal granulomas, where it is thought to play a role in the formation and maturation of granulomas [ ].
Increased Th-17 cells may also be associated with the SLGs induced by immune checkpoint inhibitors. Studies have demonstrated that CTLA-4 blockade results in increased Th-17 CD4 + cells in peripheral blood in melanoma patients, thus leading to an extended production of pro-inflammatory molecules, including IL-6 and TNF-α, believed to lead to SLG development [ ]. PD-1 inhibition, via checkpoint inhibitors nivolumab or pembrolizumab, also drives the pro-inflammatory Th-1 and Th-17 immune responses and resultant T-cell proliferation in various tissues, including the lungs, spleen, and lymph nodes, as demonstrated through in vitro and in vivo murine studies [ ]. Th-1- and Th-17-driven autoimmune conditions—psoriasis and thyroiditis—are common immune-related side effects of PD-1 inhibitors [ ]. Taken together, these findings support the role of Th-1 and Th-17 cells in the development of iRAEs, especially SLGs in PD-1 inhibitor treated patients where the heightened Th-1/Th-17 immune response is the same cytokine milieu that favors sarcoidosis initiation.
In our search, patients with melanoma were those most frequently reported to have SLGs. While this is likely related to the earlier approval and increased use of checkpoint inhibitors for melanoma than for other cancer types, it is also possible that the substantial mutational burden of melanoma tumors potentiates iRAE development. The immunogenic nature of melanoma tumor neoantigens may result in an increased likelihood for melanoma patients to develop iRAEs when treated with checkpoint inhibitors [ , , ]. Specifically, checkpoint inhibitors potentiate the anti-tumor response resulting in melanoma cell death, and in doing so, may further reveal tumor neoantigens. Once presented on host antigen-presenting cells, tumor neoantigens may fuel a Th-1 innate immune response, resulting in the pro-inflammatory cytokine environment that favors development of SLGs [ ]. Additionally, studies have reported a higher incidence of sarcoidosis in melanoma patients as compared to the general population, establishing a risk of sarcoidosis in these patients independent of checkpoint inhibitor therapy [ ]. One study found increased levels of circulating Th-17 cells in melanoma patients prior to receiving PD-1 inhibitor therapy and at the onset of immunotherapy-related SLGs [ ]. It is possible that the elevated circulating Th-17 cells in melanoma patients combined with the high mutational tumor burden set the stage for the formation of SLGs in the setting of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Only one patient with SLGs had a reported history of asymptomatic pulmonary sarcoidosis prior to pembrolizumab treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma; that patient developed SLGs affecting the lungs, LN, bone, skin, and eyes [ ].
In about one-fourth of SLG cases reported here, routine follow-up imaging revealed findings that were concerning for disease recurrence. Specifically, FDG PET/CT imaging done after ICI therapy can show enlarging hypermetabolic LNs. These radiological findings in conjunction with corresponding clinical signs and symptoms can pose a significant concern to the oncologist for disease progression. While other clinical data and findings may deem melanoma progression unlikely, such as presence of bilateral positive LNs, prompt biopsy is ultimately required to differentiate between SLG development and malignancy progression.
Use of CTLA-4 inhibition sequentially or concurrently with PD-1 inhibitors may increase the risk of SLGs. Of the total 55 cases reported here, 17 had sequential or concurrent ipilimumab and PD-1 inhibitor therapy. A recent single-center database study reported more iRAEs in patients treated with combination immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy compared to those receiving single-agent therapy [ ]. Given that both PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors independently promote Th-1/Th-17 hyperactive immune responses that can potentiate SLGs, combination or sequential therapy with these checkpoint inhibitors may synergistically increase the risk for sarcoid-like iRAEs.
Conclusion
In summary, sarcoidosis-like granulomatous inflammation is associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, specifically CTLA-4 and PD-1 inhibitors, and is likely induced by a shift toward Th-1 and Th-17 immune pathway activation. Prompt investigation of potential SLGs in patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors is necessary to distinguish these from malignancy progression. As checkpoint inhibitors continue to show promising survival benefits in patients with various malignancies, early recognition and appropriate management of these side effects is crucial.
