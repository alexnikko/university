Introduction
Stroke is a frequent neurological disease, with major impact on the individual patient, relatives, caregivers, the health system, and the society [ ]. An important clinical feature is that the clinical presentation and the course of recovery are rather heterogeneous. Stroke symptoms can encompass multiple domains, ranging from motor (70–80%), sensory (40–50%), visual (30–50%), cognitive (70%), speech (25%) to coordination deficits (60–90%), among others [ , , , ]. Especially, motor deficits impose a large burden to patients’ life and are the main predictors for reentry to normal life. Fine motor deficits can make common tasks of everyday life, like handwriting or tying shoelaces, very difficult. To date, motor recovery in a large part of patients remains incomplete [ ]. This makes the invention of novel effective motor rehabilitation strategies a major, mandatory challenge for translational neuroscience.
To address this challenge, various strategies, like cortical stimulation, diminution of sensory input from the intact hand, peripheral somatosensory stimulation of the paretic hand, transient anesthesia of the paretic upper arm, or pharmacological interventions, have been suggested [ ]. We will focus in the current review on non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS). In this regard, first proof-of-principal studies provided promising results. A single session of excitatory anodal transcranial current stimulation (tDCS) applied to the ipsilesional motor cortex (iM1) improved hand motor skills of the paretic hand [ ]. A body of evidence was able to replicate and extend these findings; for review see, e.g., [ , ]. But not all patients seem to benefit from a unified approach of primary motor cortex (M1) stimulation. In a recent meta-analysis, assessing the effect of multiple sessions of tDCS combined with rehabilitation for the upper extremity in randomized controlled trails, real tDCS had a small, but non-significant effect on upper extremity impairments (effect size 0.11) and activities of daily living (effect size 0.24) [ ]. Furthermore, anodal tDCS applied to iM1 without concomitant training of the affected upper limb did not improve motor function in a single-center, double-blind, sham-controlled study including 50 acute stroke patients [ ].
In addition to motor functions, cognitive impairments are common after a stroke and of crucial importance for reintegration into everyday life [ , ]. The effectiveness of current cognitive rehabilitation strategies is limited [ ]. Supplementary to rehabilitation of motor abilities, NIBS has been proposed as a concomitant treatment for cognitive rehabilitation [ ]. Currently, the evidence for using NIBS to augment cognitive abilities in stroke is very preliminary and novel stimulation protocols should be investigated [ ].
One potential reason for the mixed results is the heterogeneous property of stroke. Several factors, like lesion site, lesion size, structural integrity of white matter tracts, time since stroke, level of impairment, ipsilesional M1 gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) level, stimulation site, stimulation mode, or stimulation duration, that influence the response to NIBS in stroke have been identified; please see Table 1 . For instance, O’Shea and colleagues could show that time since stroke and level of clinical recovery are positive predictors for response to cathodal tDCS applied to cM1 in chronic stroke, assessing a simple reaction time task [ ]. Table 1 Potential factors that influence response to NIBS after stroke Factor Reference Technique Main finding Lesion site Ameli et al. 2009 [ ] rTMS 10-Hz rTMS applied to iM1 improved movement kinematics in subcortical, but not in patients with additional cortical stroke. Carey et al. 2014 [ ] rTMS The level of preservation of the ipsilesional posterior limb of the internal capsule had a positive influence on the effect of 6-Hz primed low-frequency rTMS to cM1 on hand function in chronic stroke. Lesion size Wagner et al. 2007 [ ] tDCS Model strokes with different volumes (I 2.6 cm 3 , II 18.5 cm 3 , III 350 cm 3 ) perturbed the current density distributions in an MRI-derived finite element head model differently. Structural integrity of white matter tracts Lindenberg et al. 2012 [ ] tDCS Patients with better integrity of the corticospinal tract improved more in motor function after 5 sessions of bihemispheric tDCS combined with physical/occupational therapy. Demirtas-Tatlidede et al. 2015 [ ] rTMS Patients with better integrity of transcallosal fibers showed larger improvements in motor function after 10 sessions of 1-Hz rTMS to cM1. Time since stroke O’Shea et al. 2014 [ ] tDCS Chronic stroke patients with greater chronicity and better paretic hand function showed greater behavioral gains in response to cathodal tDCS applied to cM1. Level of impairment O’Shea et al. 2014 [ ] tDCS Bradnam et al. 2012 [ ] tDCS Cathodal tDCS applied to cM1 improved selective proximal upper limb control in mildly impaired patients and worsened it in moderately to severely impaired patients. Ipsilesional M1 GABA level O’Shea et al. 2014 [ ] tDCS The higher the ipsilesional M1 GABA levels, the larger the behavioral gain from anodal tDCS. Stimulation site Wang et al. 2014 [ ] rTMS The effect of 1-Hz rTMS to cPMd on hand motor function was inferior to stimulation of cM1 in subacute to chronic stroke. Stimulation mode Fregni et al. 2005 [ ] tDCS The effect of stimulation on hand motor function in chronic stroke tended to be larger, 1.78 vs. 1.17, for cathodal tDCS applied to cM1 than anodal tDCS applied to iM1. But there was no significant difference in between groups. Kwon et al. 2014 [ ] rTMS Pre-conditioning training with 10-Hz rTMS to iM1 was superior to an interleaved design, when chronic stroke patients performed a sequential motor learning task. Cho et al. 2017 [ ] rTMS + tDCS Dual-mode NIBS (10-Hz rTMS to iM1 and simultaneous cathodal tDCS to cM1) had a superior effect on motor function in subacute stroke, when compared to single-mode 10-Hz rTMS to iM1. Stimulation duration Boggio et al. 2007 [ ] tDCS The effect of consecutive daily sessions of cathodal tDCS to cM1 on hand motor function might be superior to weekly sessions.

We argue that patient stratification would be a promising strategy to achieve stable treatment effects with largest magnitude. An important factor to consider is stimulation site. We propose the cerebellum as a potential additional stimulation target. Its rich inherited plasticity mechanisms [ , ], dense connections to cortical areas [ , ], and evidence of successful non-invasive modulation of cerebellar function in humans [ , ] emphasize the cerebellum as a promising target. Cerebellar stimulation could be used to (a) target symptoms attributed to vascular lesions of the cerebellum or (b) be utilized to modulate connected neocortical areas, the respective functional network, and associated symptoms affected by a supratentorial stroke via the non-impaired cerebellar entry. In the current review, we will focus on both strategies. In addition, we will discuss mechanisms of plasticity in the cortico-cerebellar system after stroke, present common non-invasive cerebellar stimulation techniques, and discuss possible clinical applications and strategies for multi-focal stimulation.
Plasticity in the Cortico-Cerebellar System in Response to Cerebral Stroke
In response to a stroke, there are significant neuroplastic changes in the cortico-cerebellar system. Among others, a stroke can result in (1) crossed cerebellar diaschisis, (2) dysbalanced cerebellar brain inhibition, and (3) affect learning processes; please see Fig. 1 . Fig. 1 Plasticity in the cortico-cerebellar system after stroke and possible targets for NIBS. Targets for neuromodulation after stroke: (1) crossed cerebellar diaschisis; (2) dysbalanced cerebellar cortical interactions (e.g., cerebellar brain inhibition, CBI); (3) modulation of learning processes. For details please see text. Schematic is projected on MNI standard brain. Cb: cerebellar cortex; DN: dentate nucleus; VLT: ventrolateral thalamus; M1: primary motor cortex; PN: pontine nuclei; CBI: cerebello-brain inhibition; RMT: resting-motor-threshold; ICI: intracortical-inhibition. Cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathway: blue; cerebro-ponto-cerebellar pathway: red
The phenomenon of crossed cerebellar diaschisis (CCD) was first described by Baron in 1981 [ ]. It describes a reduction of cerebral blood flow and metabolism in the contralateral cerebellar hemisphere after supratentorial ischemic stroke. CCD is most likely caused by an affection of the cerebro-ponto-cerebellar pathway [ ]. The reduction in cerebellar blood flow is coupled with a decrease of spontaneous activity of Purkinje cells [ ]. CCD can be already detected in the hyper-acute phase [ ]. It evolves over time and is persistent in a subgroup of patients even in the chronic phase [ ]. The degree of CCD is linked to clinical impairment. In the early subacute phase, it correlates with impairment, e.g., measured with the Scandinavian Stroke Scale at day 60 after the stroke incidence [ ]. Moreover, it correlates also with impairment in the chronic phase [ ]. Rebalancing the degree of CCD could be one promising interventional strategy to facilitate motor function after stroke. This is especially since the discussed underlying mechanisms of CCD, decreased blood flow and neuronal spiking activity, can be modulated with direct-current brain stimulation as demonstrated previously [ , ].
Vascular lesions of the cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathway can result in dysbalanced cerebellar brain inhibition (CBI). Furthermore, the structural integrity of this pathway has been associated with residual general motor output in chronic stroke [ ]. CBI can be measured non-invasively in humans with bifocal double-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) [ ]. In this paradigm, a condition pulse is applied to the contralateral cerebellum around 5 ms before a test pulse to the primary motor cortex (M1) is applied. This results in inhibition of the motor evoked potential (MEP) and provides a measure of functional connectivity between the stimulated areas [ ]. In case studies, CBI was diminished in patients with vascular lesions to the cerebellar cortex, thalamus, and posterior limb of the internal capsule, but not after small infarctions to the pre- and post-central gyri [ , ]. Recently, it could be shown that non-invasive brain stimulation can modulate CBI in healthy subjects [ ]. Based on this, one could consider the modulation of CBI as a second interventional strategy to enhance residual motor functions and recovery after stroke.
The third proposed interventional strategy is based on the matter that motor skill learning is fundamental for successful motor recovery after stroke [ ]. Animal models provided evidence that rehabilitative training after focally induced infarctions to the motor cortex can shape subsequent cortical reorganization and can prevent secondary loss of spared hand area [ ]. From human studies, it is known that motor recovery after stroke shares similar neural correlates as during motor learning in healthy. Askim and colleagues evaluated this in a longitudinal design, while the patients received task-oriented physical therapy. They performed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and clinical testing in the first week after stroke and after 3 months. The authors found increased activation of the bilateral striatum and contralesional cerebellum in the acute phase. This was followed by increased activation in the ipsilesional primary sensorimotor cortex in the chronic phase [ ]. This pattern of brain activations resembles the evolvement of brain activation during motor skill learning in healthy subjects [ ]. The major role of the cerebellum in the motor learning network [ ] emphasizes it as a promising target for neuromodulation during the course of motor stroke recovery. Especially, after supratentorial stroke, the cerebellum could provide an undisturbed, non-lesioned access to the motor learning network. In this regard, a third strategy is the facilitation of motor learning mechanisms with non-invasive cerebellar brain stimulation in the process of stroke recovery. Recently, first proof-of-principle evidence suggests that differential motor learning subcomponents can be enhanced with excitatory anodal cerebellar tDCS in healthy subjects [ , ]. If this holds true for stroke patients, this would constitute a very promising interventional strategy for motor rehabilitation. This concept should be investigated in future studies.
In addition to the discussed changes in the cortico-cerebellar system after stroke, vascular lesions of the cerebellum have an influence on linked neocortical areas. For instance, they influence motor cortex excitability and can result in an elevated resting motor threshold (RMT) in the contralateral motor cortex [ ]. Lesions in the territory of the superior cerebellar artery have an impact on inhibitory and excitatory circuits in the motor cortex. This results in enhanced short intracortical inhibition (SICI) and a loss of facilitation (ICF), when assessed with double-pulse TMS [ ]. Also more complex network effects are present. Recently, Fallani and colleagues could show, using high-density electroencephalography (EEG) and source imaging, that cerebellar lesions result in functional reorganization of cortical network properties [ ].
Analogous processes in the cortico-cerebellar system are involved in cognitive processing and are mediating cognitive plasticity [ ].
Firstly, it has been hypothesized that CCD may be associated with cognitive capacity after supratentorial ischemia [ ]. First data emphasizes an association of improved cognitive function after carotid endarterectomy and a resolution of dysbalanced CCD [ ]. To validate this concept, further investigations are necessary.
Secondly, modulation of the cerebellar outflow with NIBS has shown to modulate functional connectivity with frontal and parietal cognitive areas [ ]. On the behavioral level, interference with hemispheric cerebellar function impairs cognitive processing, e.g., in a verbal working memory task [ ].
Furthermore, cortico-cerebellar plasticity is involved in the learning of novel cognitive operations. This was studied by Balsters and colleagues using a conditional learning task [ ]. Their participants had to learn associations between different-shaped picture stimuli and finger responses. A more automatic execution of this learned first-order rules was associated with a decreased BOLD activity in Crus I of the cerebellar cortical lobule HVIIA.
To conclude, the cortico-cerebellar system mediates cognitive plasticity and constitutes a promising target for neuromodulation with the aim to alleviate cognitive impairments.
Methods for Non-invasive Cerebellar Stimulation
Several methods for non-invasive stimulation of the cerebellum have been established [ ]. The most common are transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS); for overview please see Table 2 . Table 2 Techniques for non-invasive cerebellar stimulation Method tDCS tACS rTMS TBS Mechanism NMDA-dependent, LTP-/LTD-like [ ] Interference with cortical rhythms [ ] Modulation of cortical presynaptic metabolic activity [ ] NMDA-dependent, LTP-/LTD-like synaptic plasticity [ ] Proposed site of action Purkinje cells [ ] Purkinje cells [ ] Purkinje cells [ ] Purkinje cells or local interneurons [ ] Modulation of the CTCP C:↓CBI [ ] A: ↑CBI (double-cone coil, CS 5% below brainstem AMT) [ ]; ↓CBI (flat figure-of-eight coil, CS 100% of RMT of FDI) [ ] 50 Hz: ↓CBI 300 Hz: ↑CBI [ ] 1 Hz: ↓CBI [ ] cTBS; ↓CBI iTBS: ↔CBI [ ] MEP amplitude C/A: ↔MEP [ ] 50 Hz: ↑MEP 300 Hz: ↔MEP [ ] 1 Hz: ↑MEP [ ] cTMS: ↓MEP iTBS: ↑MEP [ ] Modulation of intracortical circuits in motor cortex C/A: ↔SICI/ICF [ ] 10/50/300 Hz: ↔LICI [ ] 1 Hz: ↔SICI; ↑ICF (15 ms) [ ] 1 Hz: ↔SICI; ↓ICF (10 ms) [ ] 1 Hz: ↑SICI (2–5 ms) [ ] 10 Hz: ↔SICI (2–5 ms); ↔ICF (7–20 ms) [ ] cTBS: ↓SICI (3 ms); ↔ICF; ↑LICI (100 ms) iTBS: ↔SICI; ↓ICF (15 ms); ↓LICI (100 ms) [ ] Modulation of motor function and learning A: Enhanced acquisition of a novel visuomotor transformation in an adaptation task [ ]; enhanced online learning in a SVIPT [ ]; enhanced off-line learning in MSCT [ ] 50 Hz: Improved motor performance and grip strength measured with the WMFT [ ] 1 Hz: Increased variability in paced finger tapping [ ] 1 Hz: Interference with procedural learning (SRTT) [ ] cTBS: Impaired the acquisition and timing of conditioned responses in eyeblink classical conditioning, but did not affect retention [ ] cTBS: Impaired retention of index finger abductions, reaching-to-grasp and reaching-to-point movements [ ] Studies in stroke A: Enhanced spelling recovery in a stroke patient (case study) [ ] – 1 Hz: Improved performance in 10MWT and BBS in patients with acute posterior circulation stroke [ ] iTBS: Improved posture and gait in patients with chronic posterior circulation stroke [ ] Pros • Portable • Easy to apply • Portable • Easy to apply • Possibility of modulation of brain oscillations • Targeting of different cortical components depending on their intrinsic oscillatory activity [ ] • Simplicity of regular rTMS protocols • Focality • Short duration of protocol • Lower stimulus intensity need as in typical rTMS • Focality Cons • Less focal • Less focal • Currently only sparse data on the method • Cost of equipment • Cost of equipment • More complex application procedures 10MWT 10-m walk test, A anodal stimulation, AMT active motor threshold, BBS Berg balance scale, C cathodal stimulation, CBI cerebello-brain inhibition, cTBS continuous theta burst stimulation, CTCP cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathway, ICF intracortical facilitation, iTBS intermittent theta burst stimulation, LICI long intracortical inhibition, LTD long-term depression, LTP long-term potentiation, MEP motor evoked potential, MSCT motor synchronization continuation task, NMDA N-methyl- d -aspartate, rTMS repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, SICI short intracortical inhibition, SRTT serial reaction time task, SVIPT sequential visual isometric pinch task, tACS transcranial alternation current stimulation, tDCS transcranial direct current stimulation, WMFT Wolf motor function test
Cerebellar tDCS
Cerebellar tDCS (CbtDCS) is a modality of transcranial electric stimulation (tES). Scalp electrodes are used to impose a static, subthreshold electric field on the brain. tDCS can modulate cortical excitability via polarization of neuronal tissue [ , ]. Primary work in humans was conducted on the primary motor cortex. Anodal stimulation enhanced and cathodal stimulation diminished excitability, measured via motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitude [ ]. Galea and colleagues performed basic electrophysiological investigations for cerebellar stimulation. They provided evidence that tDCS can modulate cerebello-brain connectivity (CBI) [ ]. As it did not change measures of M1 and cortico-spinal excitability, the modulatory effect was cerebellar. CbtDCS proved to modulate different modalities and aspects of motor learning [ , , , ], as well as the performance in other domains, like cognitive functions [ ]. A recent quantitative review estimated an effect size (Hedges’ d, unsigned cumulative) for modulating performance in motor tasks of 0.71 and cognitive tasks 0.32 [ ]. To date, there is limited data on the effect of cbtDCS on motor function in stroke. Interestingly, in a recent single-case study anodal cbtDCS augmented language treatment in a patient with chronic bilateral middle cerebral artery infarctions [ ]. For review on cbtDCS see, e.g., [ , , , , ].
Cerebellar tACS
In a tACS subthreshold, oscillating electrical currents are applied to the brain. The most basic form uses sinusoidal currents [ ]. When tACS is applied over M1, it can modulate cortico-spinal excitability in a frequency-dependent manner [ , ]. tACS has the potential to entrain endogenous brain oscillations [ , ]. Ten-hertz tACS applied to M1 enhanced online implicit motor learning in healthy subjects [ ]. In-phase 6-Hz tACS stimulation of the prefrontal and parietal cortex enhanced cognitive performance in a delayed letter discrimination task [ ]. Recently, Naro and colleagues conducted a series of experiments to investigate the effect of tACS applied to the cerebellum. CbtACS modulated MEP amplitude and CBI depending on the stimulation frequency. Fifty-hertz stimulation increased MEP amplitude; in contrast, 300-Hz stimulation had no effect. Fifty-hertz tACS inhibited CBI and 300-Hz stimulation facilitated it [ ]. On the behavioral level, 50-Hz cbtACS improved motor performance and grip strength [ ]. To date, there is insufficient data to conclude on the effect on cbtACS in stroke. For review on tACS see, e.g., [ , ].
Cerebellar rTMS
TMS uses the principle of electromagnetic induction. Repetitive application of magnetic pulses can induce plastic changes in the brain. Slow rates (0.2–1 Hz) decrease excitability; on the contrary, fast rates (> 5 Hz) increase it [ ]. In addition to conventional regular rTMS, rTMS can be applied in patterned protocols [ ]. One mode of patterned rTMS is theta burst stimulation (TBS). In TBS, a three-pulse burst in most applications at 50 Hz is repeated at a 5-Hz frequency. If this pattern is applied in a continuous mode, this leads to inhibition. An intermittent application (2 s trains repeated every 10 s) results in excitation [ ]. When compared to conventional rTMS, an advantage of TBS is that it is the mostly applied subthreshold and has a short protocol application duration.
Conventional 1-Hz rTMS applied to the cerebellum diminished CBI [ ] and facilitated cortico-spinal excitability, measured with MEP amplitudes [ ]. One-hertz TMS applied to the medial cerebellum interfered with paced finger tapping [ ]. When applied to the paramedian cerebellum, it interfered with performance in the 10-hole pegboard task [ ]. One-hertz rTMS applied to the lateral cerebellum perturbed procedural learning in the serial reaction time task [ ]. On the contrary, Kim and colleagues could show that 1-Hz cbrTMS could have a beneficial effect on lower limb function in patients with posterior circulation stroke [ ].
Complementarily, cerebellar TBS has proven to modulate CBI [ ] and MEP amplitude [ ]. Focusing on basic motor learning, Hoffland and colleagues could show that cTBS applied to the cerebellum impaired the acquisition of conditioned responses in eyeblink classical conditioning [ ]. In posterior circulation stroke, intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) resulted in an improvement in the posture and gait subscale of the modified international cooperative ataxia rating scale (MICARS) [ ].
For review on cerebellar rTMS/TBS, see, e.g., [ , ].
Target Symptoms for Cerebellar Stimulation
From clinical knowledge, we know that cerebellar functions are essential for performance of skilled hand movements, limb coordination, gait, and cognitive function. Based on this, fine motor deficits, gait disturbance, and cognitive impairments are possible target symptoms for cerebellar stimulation after stroke.
Fine Motor Deficits
Impairments in motor behavior are very common in stroke, affecting to different degrees around 80–85% of stroke patients [ , ]. Restrictions in fine motor function influence many activities of daily life significantly. Some examples are using cutlery, handwriting, or tying shoe laces. Cerebellar lesions can affect performance in fine motor tasks directly [ , ]. Additionally, when network effects are considered in supratentorial stroke, the cerebellum represents a crucial node for reshaping motor function.
Machado and colleagues investigated the effect of chronic, electrical stimulation of the ascending cerebellar output in an animal model of supratentorial stroke. The stimulation was conducted via implanted electrodes in the contralateral lateral cerebellar nucleus. They combined pulsed 30-Hz stimulation to the contralesional lateral cerebellar nucleus with motor training of the forelimb in rodents. The treatment phase consisted of 5 weeks with 12-h/day stimulation and 10-min/day, 5-day/week training. Animals assigned to the active stimulation group showed a significant improvement in motor function, when compared to post-ischemia baseline or to the control group [ ].
It is an important task for translational neuroscience to transfer these findings to patients. NIBS provides the opportunity to test novel stimulation strategies with minimal risk, non-invasively in behaving humans. Recently, a set of experiments could show that cbtDCS can modulate different aspects of motor skill learning in healthy subjects. Anodal tDCS enhanced online learning of a sequence of pinch forces [ ] and off-line learning of rhythmic finger tapping [ ] in young healthy participants. Both behavioral components are important for skilled hand function. Future studies recruiting stroke patients should test if this concept also holds true for stroke, which skill and temporal learning components are modulated, and which covariates influence the response to training and stimulation.
Gait Disturbance
Gait disturbance is a common symptom in stroke. In the large cohort investigated in the COST study, 51% of patients could not walk initially, and 12% could only walk with assistance. After rehabilitation, still 22% of patients were not able to walk, 14% were dependent on assistance [ ]. Often, stroke patients present a disturbed gait pattern, showing reduced walking speed, temporal and spatial inter-limb asymmetries, and impaired standing balance control [ ]. Several gait rehabilitation strategies, like neurofacilitation approaches, ankle-foot orthoses, functional electric stimulation, treadmill training, and robot-assisted gait training, among others, have been proposed [ ]. But their success is not yet satisfactory.
NIBS has been proposed as a strategy to facilitate recovery of gait disorders post stroke. So far, mainly M1 stimulation has been investigated [ ]. However, also the cerebellum is a crucial node of the gait network, being involved in controlling support, balance, and locomotion, and being crucially involved in locomotor adaptation and learning processes [ ]. Recently, first evidence was provided that cbtDCS can modulate subcomponents of gait in healthy subjects. Jayaram and colleagues applied cbtDCS during the adaptation phase of a split-belt treadmill-walking task. After a tied baseline block, the belt of one leg moved at 1.5 m/s and the belt of the other at 0.5 m/s. Anodal cbtDCS enhanced the locomotor adaptation of the fast leg, and cathodal stimulation tended to decrease it [ ]. Cathodal cbtDCS disrupted adaptation to a spatio-temporal gait template [ ]. In addition, cbtACS was able to modulate M1-leg excitability and CBI measured from the tibialis anterior in healthy subjects [ ]. So far, there is limited data on the effect of cbtDCS on post-stroke gait rehabilitation. Considering TMS, first proof-of principle studies have been performed recruiting stroke patients. Cerebellar, excitatory iTBS improved posture and gait in posterior circulation stroke [ ]. Controversially, inhibitory 1-Hz rTMS improved performance in the 10-min walk test and Berg Balance Scale in posterior circulation stroke [ ]. Possible reasons for differential results of the two mentioned studies, applying excitatory versus inhibitory stimulation, could be the timing (chronic versus acute) or intensity and mode of stimulation (subthreshold TBS versus suprathreshold rTMS).
Overall, NIBS is a promising tool to enhance gait rehabilitation in stroke. Future research should investigate the feasibility in stroke, the role in supratentorial stroke, the potential of tES, and the underlining mechanisms.
Cognitive Impairments
Post-stroke cognitive impairments are common. The prevalence of cognitive impairment after stroke is in the range of 50–70% [ , ]. The entity vascular cognitive impairment encompasses all forms of cognitive disorders verified by neuropsychological testing and associated with cerebrovascular disease independent of the underlying mechanism [ ]. Current treatment options, such as vascular risk factor management, pharmacological cognitive enhancement, or multi-component interventions, are still limited [ , ].
A compelling interventional strategy is the combination of cognitive training with NIBS. In addition to sensorimotor functions, the cerebellum is involved in cognitive and limbic processing. Lesions to the posterior lobe can result in impaired executive function, visual-spatial processing, linguistic deficits, and affective dysregulation [ , ]. This emphasizes the strategy to use non-invasive stimulation of the cerebellar function to enhance cognitive functions after stroke.
First evidence in healthy subjects indicates that cbtDCS can enhance sensory processing in response to negative facial expressions [ ]. Anodal cbtDCS enhanced phonemic fluency measured with the oral word association task, in which subjects had to verbally generate as many words as they could think of that started with a given letter in a time period of 1 min [ ]. Cathodal cbtDCS facilitated arithmetic processing and verb generation [ ]. But the facilitatory effect of cbtDCS seems to be dependent on the utilized task and assessed cognitive domain. It is important to consider that cerebellar tDCS has also shown to impair performance in distinct cognitive subdomains, such as working and short-term memory [ , , ].
In summary, considering the high frequency of cognitive impairments in stroke and the limited treatment options, NIBS combined with cognitive training is a promising strategy for enhancement of cognition after a stroke. Future studies should clarify the issue of task and domain dependency, determine the most effective stimulation protocols, and assess if cognitive functions can be consistently enhanced in the stroke population.
Multi-Focal Stimulation
A promising strategy to enhance the effects of brain stimulation might be to not only stimulate one single brain area, but also orchestrate multi-focal stimulation of crucial nodes of the respective network [ ]. Due to its structure encompassing multiple, functionally segregated reentry loops connecting different cerebellar and neocortical areas, the cortico-cerebellar system is well suited for this approach; for overview see Fig. 2 . For instance, tDCS could be used to target different behavioral subcomponents or behavioral domains in one training session. This strategy can encompass within or between domain (e.g., motor and cognitive) stimulation paradigms. Fig. 2 Targets for multi-focal stimulation within the cortico-cerebellar system. Depicted are cortico-cerebellar loops for sensorimotor, cognitive, or limbic processing. Multi-focal stimulation can be applied within one behavioral domain, e.g., (S1) motor or (S2) cognitive, or between domains (S3). Between-domain stimulation might prove beneficial, additive, or supra-additive effects, since differential behavioral domains influence each other during recovery after a stroke [ ]; for details see text. Note, that references for cerebellar-cortical connectivity are exemplary; for review please see, e.g., [ , ]. References: (1) [ ]; (2) [ ]; (3) [ ]; (4) [ ]; (5) [ ]; (6) [ ]; (7) [ ]; (8) [ ]; (9) [ ]; (10) [ ]; (11) [ ]; (12) [ ]; (13) [ ]. Abbreviations: AIP: anterior intraparietal area; MIP: medial intraparietal area; LIPv: ventral lateral intraparietal area
A first approach could aim at modulation of different subcomponents of motor learning (e.g., online versus off-line learning), which are represented in different brain structures; see Fig. 2 paradigm S1. In this regard, M1 stimulation has shown to enhance online motor learning [ ], and cerebellar stimulation has shown to facilitate off-line motor learning in elderly subjects [ ]. Stimulation of both targets during the learning process could result in additive or even supra-additive effect via summation of induced online and off-line effects. It is important to notice that the effect of stimulation target (motor cortex versus cerebellum) on temporal subcomponents of learning (online versus off-line) is currently not fully understood and most likely is also task-dependent. In this regard, anodal cerebellar tDCS enhances online learning in visuomotor adaptation [ ], off-line learning of a temporal motor sequence [ ], and both temporal components in implicit motor learning in young healthy subjects [ ].
Another promising way for multi-focal stimulation within the cortico-cerebellar system is to enhance cognitive training; see Fig. 2 paradigm S2. For instance, a combined paradigm could consist of cerebellar stimulation to enhance spelling training [ ] and stimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to enhance working memory [ ]. Such an approach is of special interest for stroke recovery, since recent data pointed out that language and verbal memory interact strongly and determine the degree of residual functions and recovery [ ].
Furthermore, multi-focal stimulation to neuromodulate different behavioral domains is a novel and innovative concept taking into account recent evidence suggesting that regularly a stroke affects not only one domain, but several by the one lesion; see Fig. 2 paradigm S3. Ramsey and colleagues provided evidence that, e.g., language and verbal memory, motor function, and attention interact during the time course of stroke recovery and determine together the degree of recovery [ ]. Based on this, an interesting approach could be to combine the stimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) to boost executive attention [ ] with stimulation of the cerebellum to enhance motor learning mechanisms [ , ]. Overall, multi-focal brain stimulation is a novel, innovative and promising approach based on the understanding of the underlying systems, neuroscience mechanisms, and network property changes after a stroke and during the process of recovery. These approaches have to be now scientifically evaluated in prospective, well-designed studies.
Summary and Outlook
To conclude, the semiology of stroke, the plasticity in the cortico-cerebellar system after stroke, and recent evidence of non-invasive modulation of cerebellar processing in healthy subjects emphasize the therapeutic potential of cerebellar NIBS for enhancement of stroke recovery. Cerebellar stimulation might support the recovery not only from impaired motor, but also from cognitive functions. The next innovative step will be to integrate cerebellar stimulation into mechanism-based, multi-focal stimulation concepts tailored to individual patients’ characteristics, and it needs to maximize functional recovery. It is also of note that recently a set of studies in healthy subjects and patients with cerebellar degeneration did not show positive results of cerebellar tDCS to enhance motor or cognitive functions [ , , , ], pointing towards the fact that “one suits all strategies” might not lead to the best effects. Consequently, upcoming research should optimize recent stimulation paradigms, assess potential factors that influence the response to NIBS after stroke, define system neuroscience “biomarkers” allowing to predict NIBS treatment response, and evaluate the influence and feasibility of patient stratification towards precision medicine.
This work with non-invasive brain stimulation methods could provide a framework for the implementation of invasive cerebellar stimulation protocols, as epidural stimulation [ , ] or deep brain stimulation, targeting the deep cerebellar nuclei [ ], which might be superior in achieving reliable and stable effects targeted for long-term use.
