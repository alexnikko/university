Introduction
The tropical fowl mite, Ornithonyssus bursa Berlese, 1888 (Acari: Macronyssidae), is a common avian parasite found on diverse bird species worldwide (Walter and Proctor ). These mites live within the nesting material and feed predominantly on chick’s blood throughout their life (Sikes and Chamberlain ; Burtt et al. ). The life cycle of O. bursa encompasses five stages: egg, larva, protonymph, deutonymph, and adult (Sikes and Chamberlain ). Adults engorge rapidly and, after a blood meal is completed, the mature female lays her eggs. These eggs can hatch as soon as 1 day after being laid, depending on the surrounding conditions (Sikes and Chamberlain ). Among the immature stages, only the protonymph feeds on its host, the deutonymph is a relatively brief, poorly developed, non-feeding stage. This distinctive characteristic of macronyssid mites confers on them a higher reproductive rate compared to closely related families (Radovsky ). The full cycle may be completed in only a few days (2 to 10) in the laboratory (Sikes and Chamberlain ; El-Kammah et al. ), although it is considered to be longer (up to a fortnight) in natural conditions (Powlesland ). It is suggested that there is vertical transmission of O. bursa in nests: parents carrying a low level of parasite intensity infect the nest, and then, due to the short life cycle, mite abundance builds up rapidly parasitising the nestlings (Powlesland ; Petersen ; Møller ).
In the Neotropical region, O. bursa can infect poultry, causing significant economic losses (Fletchmann ; Horn et al. ). It also has the potential of biting humans, causing intense itching and painful dermatitis (Baker et al. ; Semenas and Angaut Rocha ; Jofré et al. ). Moreover, as with other mesostigmatid mites (Valiente Moro et al. ; Chaisiri et al. ), it is considered a potential vector of pathogenic viruses and bacteria (Santillán et al. ; Lareschi et al. ). Detrimental effects on its natural hosts have been demonstrated, such as impairment in chick growth and development (Berggren ) or nest abandonment (Moss and Carmin ; Møller ).
Increasing our knowledge on the ecology and epidemiology of this parasite is of interest to the poultry industry, public health, and bird conservation. The existing literature on the subject is extremely limited and outdated. Powlesland ( ) found that the prevalence and abundance of O. bursa showed a positive correlation with the progress of the breeding season in starlings ( Sturnus vulgaris Linnaeus, 1758) from New Zealand. Berggren ( ) found that both nestling age and humidity of the microhabitat around the nest were positively correlated with O. bursa prevalence on chicks of New Zealand’s robin ( Petroica australis longipes Lesson & Garnot, 1827). Also, field studies showed that climate variability affects natural populations of the tropical fowl mite parasitising barn swallows ( Hirundo rustica Linnaeus, 1758) in northern Europe (Møller ). A few other studies have focused on other macronyssid species, reporting that mite occurrence varied depending on factors related to the environment and the host. Darolová et al. ( ) found that parasite loads of mites of the species Ornithonyssus sylviarum Canastrini and Fanzago, 1877, and Dermanyssus hirundinis Hermann, 1804 (Acari: Dermanyssidae), were negatively associated with male bird quality in penduline tits ( Auriparus flaviceps Sundevall, 1850) from central Europe. Garvin et al. ( ) found that the temporal distribution of O. sylviarum was correlated with the breeding season of its main host, the grey catbird ( Dumetella carolinensis Linnaeus, 1766), in the USA. Mazgajski ( ) found that the presence of old nest material in nestboxes used by the European starling had an impact on O. sylviarum abundance. In addition, laboratory studies showed that O. sylviarum is very sensitive to fluctuations in temperature and humidity (Chen and Mullens ; Halbritter and Mullens ). All these studies independently show that the dynamics of macronyssid mites is strongly influenced by the environment and by the host. However, there is a paucity of studies that assess such influence in an integrative manner and at multiple scales, especially in natural environments.
Here, we conducted a thorough longitudinal study in two breeding passerine assemblages, aiming to identify the major factors driving the abundance and distribution of O. bursa in its natural hosts. We focused on the brood and microhabitat levels, accounting for variables of higher levels that may act as potential confounders.
Materials and methods
Data collection
Data originated from systematic fieldwork carried out along six reproductive seasons of the avian hosts (spring and summer months): 2008/2009, 2009/2010, 2012/2013, 2013/2014, 2014/2015, and 2015/2016. In the first two sampling seasons, data was gathered in two sites, and only in one of them afterwards. The study sites were a natural reserve belonging to Universidad Nacional del Litoral (all sampling years; “Reserva M. Vet. Martín de la Peña”; 60° 55´ W, 31° 23´ S) and a private natural area of similar characteristics (reproductive seasons 2008/2009 and 2009/2010; “Mihura”; 60° 47´ W, 31° 30´ S). The area sampled in both sites was fixed at 40 ha. Both sites are located alongside “El Salado” river, in the centre of Santa Fe province (Argentina). They are considered relics of “El Espinal” biogeographic province and contain similar biological communities.
For this study, we focused on five bird species, which are common at the study area, and are known to be hosts of O. bursa (Arrabal et al. ): Furnarius rufus Gmelin, 1788, Sicalis flaveola Linnaeus, 1766, Phacellodomus ruber Vieillot, 1817, Phacellodomus sibilatrix Sclater, 1879, and Pitangus sulphuratus Linnaeus, 1766. All five species are altricial and breed in enclosed nests with a breeding chamber covered with grass (de la Peña ). In the case of S. flaveola , the species utilises the mud, oven-like nests built by F. rufus , either earlier in the same reproductive season or in previous ones. On the other hand, the nest of the Phacellodomus species are built by each species and are similar in structure and material (de la Peña ), although for P. ruber the wood sticks with which it is built are usually slightly thicker and less woven than in the nests of P. sibilatrix . Pitangus sulphuratus nests are mainly made of woven grass and its chamber is less isolated from the environment than the rest of the species involved in the analysis (de la Peña ). Three times a week, the study areas were thoroughly surveyed to look for nests of potential hosts, starting from the 21st of September (the start of spring, which was considered as week 1 of the study) until the end of the summer or beginning of autumn.
Nestlings were examined from hatching until they were absent from the nests. Mite abundance on each nestling was registered following a scoring method: 0 = no mites; 1 = 1–15 mites; 2 = 15–30 mites; 3 = 30 or more mites. Nests were sampled at least once a week. At times when they were sampled more than one time a week, one of the repeated samples obtained in a given week was randomly selected to make the sampling effort even.
Parasite diagnosis
A sample of the mites observed on nestlings was collected with forceps or cotton swabs and stored in 96% alcohol for later identification. In the laboratory, they were cleared in lactophenol and then mounted on microscope slides in Hoyer’s medium (Krantz ). Mite identification was assessed with the aid of an optic microscope, following Baker et al. ( ), Micherdzinski ( ), and Radovsky ( ) (representative sampled mite in Fig. 1 ). This coincided with the identification previously carried out in the same community (Arrabal et al. ).

Statistical analysis
Although records were taken from individual nestlings, the study unit was the whole brood at a given time (brood i -week ti ), as O. bursa is not a permanent parasite and spends a large proportion of its life dwelling among the nest material. Therefore, the measurements obtained for the nestlings of a brood at a given week were averaged.
The statistical analysis was divided into two parts: first, the prevalence of O. bursa on sampled broods each week of study (presence/absence of O. bursa ) and, second, the intensity of the parasitism by O. bursa on infected broods each week, as estimated by the average of the scores given to individual nestlings (notice that negative brood-weeks were not considered in this second analysis).
The independent variables of interest were selected based upon the literature. An a priori exploratory analysis of the data was also utilised as a first approach to eliminate co-lineal variables (see details in Table 1 ). The variables of interest were related to the microhabitat level of the nest, but also included variables of higher hierarchical levels, as they may act as confounders. At the microhabitat level, the variables selected were: parental brood species (host species), species that built the nest (nest builder), external material of the nest (nest material), brood size, presence of parasitic nestlings (i.e. Molothrus bonariensis Gmelin, 1789 and Tapera naevia Linnaeus, 1766), nestlings development (as approximated by status of the feather development of a randomly selected nestling of the brood), number of times the nest was previously used and nest support (tree species). A quadratic term was added for continuous variables to check for non-linearity. Table 1 Variables of interest included in the analysis.

The selected confounding variables were the reproductive season (year in which it starts), the season week (since the 21st September), and mean minimum temperature 2 weeks previously (Table 1 ), the latter being selected from various climatic factors assessed a priori. In addition, the abundance of active nests of all potential hosts (all passerines in the sampling area) 1 month previously was also included in the analysis. The lag of 2 weeks for the climatic factor was established in relation to the approximate duration of a female O. bursa ’s life cycle, so that the climatic variable would have exerted effects on at least one generation. A lag of 1 month was established for the abundance of hosts, as breeding a brood lasts from 2 to 3 weeks. Relevant two-way interactions were also included in the analysis.
Statistical analyses were conducted using the software R (The R Project for Statistical Computing; http://www.r-project.org ), fitting Generalised Linear Mixed Models (GLMM), with brood ID as a random effect. In the case of the prevalence study, the ‘glmmadmb’ function of the glmmADMB package was used with a binomial distribution, with the presence/absence of O. bursa as the response variable; while for the mite intensity analysis, the ‘glmer’ function of the lme4 package was used, with a Poisson distribution. In the case of the latter, a transformation of the response variable was needed, i.e. the score was multiplied by 10 and then rounded, to meet the conditions of the link family distribution.
Model selection was done following an information theory approach, as described by Burnham and Anderson ( ), where a stepwise manner was utilised for model comparison through Akaike information criteria (AIC) in the case of the prevalence analysis, and AICc (second order information criteria corrected for small samples; Burnham and Anderson ) in the case of the intensity analysis, due to a reduction in the sample size. Highly correlated variables were not included in the same model (e.g. nest builder, nest material and host species). The subgroup of best performing models was selected, consisting of those with a maximum of ΔAIC or ΔAICc of 5 units from the best fitting model, and their weights were calculated. These models were ordered according to their weights, and the top models were selected as the ones that reached 0.9 cumulative weight. A multimodel inference was performed using the weighted mean of the coefficients and its standard error, reaching an average model from the top models (Burnham and Anderson ). The confidence interval (α = 0.05) of each term of the average model was obtained, and terms were considered significant if they did not include the 0.
Additionally, a set of simpler models were obtained dividing the dataset by nest material, as follows: nests made of wood sticks (with Ph. ruber and Ph. sibilatrix as the host species) and nests made of mud (with F. rufus and S. flaveola as host species) ( P. sulphuratus was excluded from these analyses as the composition of its nests are unique compared with the rest of the main hosts). This was done to compare the effect of the host species on the prevalence in cases where the nest material was not different. Following the same criteria described above, the best fitting model within each subset was selected using AIC.
Results
Descriptive statistics
In the six breeding seasons that encompassed this study, a total of 517 broods of five species were weekly monitored. Overall, 29.7% of the broods were parasitised by O. bursa at a given time, being the mean abundance score 1.05. The highest prevalences and intensities were observed in the species that use oven-like mud nests: F. rufus and S. flaveola . The number of broods sampled by year, prevalences, and intensities for each host species is shown in Table 2 .

Notice that because broods were repeatedly sampled on a weekly basis, some weeks a given brood could be positive, and others negative, while the denominator used was brood-week
Prevalence models
This analysis was conducted with a total of 1033 observations, which represented 517 broods. The best models showing the variables associated with prevalence of parasitism by O. bursa on broods at a given week are shown in Supplementary material S1 . The average model (Table 3 ) shows that, at a young age, the prevalence is highest in F. rufus , followed by S. flaveola , with the rest of the host species less likely to be parasitised by O. bursa . The interaction between the nestlings’ age and their species was consistently significant (Fig. 2 ). The prevalence of O. bursa increased as nestlings developed, but this phenomenon was accentuated in the case of Pi. sulphuratus and both Phacellodomus spp. The quadratic term of age category was negatively associated with the prevalence of O. bursa , which indicates that, in the case of F. rufus and S. flaveola , the prevalence reached a maximum and then descended as the chicks advanced their development.

For this prediction, the variables not depicted were set at its median or mean, parasitic bird set as absent, year as 8 and area as ‘Mihura’
Even though models containing nest material instead of host species appeared among the selected models and the term was significant, where oven-like mud nests (built by F. rufus and also occupied by S. flaveola ) had much higher prevalence than the rest, only one of the 19 selected models had nest material, compared to 18 that had host species.
The rest of the variables of the microhabitat levels were either not significant (number of times the nest was used, brood size, presence of a parasitic nestling), or not even included in the selected models (support, nest builder).
In the additional models where data are grouped and analysed separately according to the material of the nest, running independent models for wood sticks (Table 4 ) and mud (Table 5 ), the host species is shown to be very relevant when nest material remains the same (Fig. 3 ). In the case of nests made of wood sticks, P. ruber showed a higher prevalence than P. sibilatrix (odds ratio = 4.85), while for nests made of mud, F. rufus showed a higher prevalence than S. flaveola (odds ratio = 9.05).

Infection intensity models
In the case of the intensity models, a total of 306 observations from 205 broods were used. The best models showing the variables associated with infection intensity by O. bursa on infected broods each week (estimated by the average of the scores given to individual nestlings) can be found in Supplementary material S2 . The average model (Table 6 ) shows that host species had an impact on the intensity of O. bursa. At a young age, P. ruber had the highest mite burdens followed by Pi. sulphuratus , F. rufus , S. flaveola , and, lastly, P. sibilatrix .

The interaction between the species and age of the nestlings was significant. In the case of Pi. sulphuratus and S. flaveola , it showed a more accelerated increase in the intensity of O. bursa as the nestlings developed than the rest of the species involved in the analysis (Fig. 4 ). In the case of S. flaveola , it even surpassed the burdens found on F. rufus at an older age. On the other hand, brood size was inversely correlated to the mean intensity of parasitism of the brood and this phenomenon was of equal proportions for all species studied (Fig. 5 ). Fig. 4 Relationship between age category and mite intensity for each species as predicted by the average model for intensity. Dashed line corresponds to predictions for Pi. sulphuratus beyond possible values taken by the response variable (> 30). For this prediction, variables not depicted were set at its median or mean, parasitic bird set as absent, year as 8 and area as ‘Mihura’ Fig. 5 Relationship between brood size and mite intensity as predicted by the average model for intensity.

Other variables were present among the top models, but they were not significant (age category quadratic term, presence of a parasitic nestling, number of times a nest was used, support). Type of nest and nest material were not selected.
Discussion
A few reports have documented O. bursa in Argentina (Aramburú et al. ; Arrabal et al. ; Santillán et al. ). Nevertheless, to our knowledge, this is the first study in the Neotropical region that focuses on finding associations between putative drivers of parasitism and the intensity and prevalence of O. bursa .
Although O. bursa is a nest dweller and lays its eggs within the nest material (Sikes and Chamberlain ; Powlesland ), our results show that the host species might be of more importance on the prevalence and intensity of O. bursa than the nest’s traits. This was found even in species of the same genus that build similar nests, as with species of Phacellodomus , but also in unrelated species ( F. rufus and S. flaveola ) that occupy the same nest. This consistent result contradicts the findings of Fend’a and Schniererová ( ), where mite fauna (including O. sylviarum ) was found to be more dependent of the nest material structure than the host species. On the other hand, these results are in concordance with those of Moreno et al. ( ), in which differences in nest material of the same and different host species was not associated with the prevalence of another hematophagous mite, Dermanyssus gallinoides Moss, 1966 (Acari: Dermanyssidae). Characteristics associated with host species other than host nest composition were also found to be more important for D. gallinoides abundance in Cantarero et al. ( ).
Brood size was found to have a negative effect on mites count in the intensity models. This might be explained by a dilution effect of the parasite load per nestling as the number of nestlings in a brood increases (Richner and Heeb ). Although Richner and Heeb ( ) noted that this pattern is more suited for long-cycled ectoparasites (duration of cycle similar to the time it takes for its host to fledge), our finding for O. bursa might be explained by the fact that in natural conditions, O. bursa ’s life cycle may be longer than it is in laboratory conditions, closer to the period of time nestlings stay in the nest (Powlesland ). This result is consistent with other studies that investigated the intensity of mesostigmatid mites, arriving at the same predictions stated by Richner and Heeb ( ) for long-cycled ectoparasites (e.g. Darolová et al. ; Berggren ; Mazgajski ). Further studies focusing on O. bursa ’s life cycle in different contexts might help unravel this conundrum.
Population of mites in the nest increased from hatching and beyond the first half of the brood development, which is consistent with results found in previous studies for mesostigmatid mites, where mite prevalence and intensity increased as a brood progressed (Mašán ; Berggren ). Nevertheless, the reduction in mite prevalence and intensity at more advanced age categories for some of the species might be associated with an increase of host resistance, be it immunocompetence (Apanius ; Roulin et al. ) or behavioural resistance (i.e. preening; Powlesland ), which might appear at different developmental stages for each species, as suggested by the significant interactions found in our analyses. Although the possibility of a detection bias due to the difficulty of noticing the presence of mites among developed feathers cannot be ruled out (Moyer et al. ), the chance of it being the reason for observing this interaction seems attenuated by the fact that the mite intensity begins to decay on most species before the stage at which the plumage begins to be dense enough to reduce the chances of mite detection (sixth age category).
It is interesting that the species that had the highest prevalences of O. bursa infection ( F. rufus and S. flaveola ) were not the ones that presented the highest intensities of parasitism ( P. ruber and Pi. sulphuratus ). Prevalence of a given generalist parasite in a multi-host context depends, first, on an encounter filter (parasite exposure) and, second, on the performance of host defences (resistance and tolerance) (Manzoli et al. ). Differences in exposure, resistance, and tolerance among different hosts shape the distribution of a given parasite, determining its prevalence and intensity in each host (Bauchau ; Manzoli et al. ). Although further studies are necessary to arrive at accurate conclusions regarding resistance and tolerance, the results presented here suggest that nestlings of the species that presented a high prevalence of O. bursa in this study might have a high encounter rate, but also high resistance. On the other hand, species with less prevalence indicate less exposure to the parasite, while higher intensities in them might reflect either less resistance or more tolerance. In studies comparing defence strategies against O. bursa , the impact on fitness and parasite exposures between different hosts may contribute to an explanation of these findings, and would also establish the differential outcomes resulting from parasitising different hosts, both for the host (virulence) and the parasite (transmission).
