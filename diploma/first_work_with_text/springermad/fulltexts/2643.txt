Introduction
Worldwide, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is considered as one of the most common infectious diseases addressed by clinicians. It is an important reason of mortality and morbidity (Mandell et al. ).
Numerous pathogens can cause CAP. Traditionally, pneumonia has been categorized as typical, usually caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae , or as atypical, caused by Chlamydia pneumoniae , Legionella s pecies, Mycoplasma pneumoniae , and respiratory viruses (Watkins ). Also, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is a common cause of CAP (Liam et al. ) .
It is often hard to discriminate typical from atypical pneumonia only on clinical bases (Watkins ). Furthermore, it is not always easy to distinguish pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) from bacterial pneumonia in a clinical setting particularly in the initial stage (Miller et al. ). This is ascribed primarily to the changeable radiographic and clinical presentation of TB and CAP according to patient age and comorbidity (Lieberman et al. ). The low sensitivity of acid-fast bacillus microscopy together with the unavailability of special laboratory tests necessary to identify atypical pathogens causing pneumonia might be the cause of this difficult discrimination (Kang et al. ; Ramirez and Anzueto ).
For guiding treatment for CAP, awareness of the possible causative pathogen is very important because typical pneumonia frequently responds well to β-lactam antibiotics whereas atypical pathogens do not respond to them but respond better to tetracyclines, macrolides, and some quinolones. The empirical use of antibiotics, particularly newer fluoroquinolones for treating CAP, may delay the diagnosis of PTB and is associated with the appearance of extensively drug-resistant TB (Chang et al. ; Wang et al. ). Furthermore, isolation of TB patients as early as possible will diminish transmission of PTB to other hospitalized patients and healthcare personnel (Yoon et al. ). Therefore, there is a great need for an adjunct rapid diagnostic method that can determine whether CAP is caused by MTB or other bacterial pathogens to early administer the appropriate anti-TB drugs or antibiotic treatment to reduce morbidity and mortality caused by pneumonia.
Neutrophilia and lymphocytopenia are well-established markers of severe bacterial infection (Zahorec ). The neutrophil–lymphocyte count ratio (NLR) has been “rediscovered” as a simple marker to distinguish between viral and severe bacterial infections (de Jager et al. ). Routinely, the absolute lymphocyte count is often not reported despite determining a differential white cell count. Therefore, the derived neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio (dNLR), composed of neutrophil count divided by (leukocyte count − neutrophil count), is under search to overcome this lack of data (Proctor et al. ). We aimed to assess the potential use of NLR and dNLR as relatively cheap and easily measurable laboratory parameters to discriminate between different types of CAP and compare its diagnostic utility to that of C-reactive protein (CRP).
Subjects and methods
This study was carried out on 187 adult patients admitted to Mansoura University Hospitals and/or Mansoura Chest Hospital between December 2014 and April 2016 with a suspicion of having CAP. Suspicion of CAP was based clinically on the presence of symptoms and signs suggestive of lower respiratory tract infection (new dry or productive cough, dyspnea, hyperthermia or hypothermia, altered breath sounds upon physical examination) with the presence of new infiltrate on plain x-ray chest radiography within the first day of patient’s hospitalization.
Patients received antibiotics for more than 24 h, those with conditions known to affect white blood cell count such as hematological disorders, on chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and with chronic inflammatory conditions and patients transferred from another hospital were excluded from this study.
From all patients, we collected three consecutive early morning sputum samples, 2 ml of blood sample on a plain tube to obtain sera for CRP and antibody detection, and 1 ml of blood on an EDTA tube for complete blood count. All patients’ samples were subjected to the following: 1. Microbiological examination to identify the causative organism of pneumonia by the following: (a) Direct sputum smears stained with Gram and Ziehl–Neelsen (ZN) stains. (b) Sputum culture on blood, chocolate, and Mac Conkey agar for bacterial isolation, on LJ media after decontamination for isolation of M. tuberculosis bacilli and on special media using Mycoplasma agar base (Oxoid CM401) supplemented with Mycoplasma selective supplement P (Oxoid SR060C) and Legionella charcoal yeast extract (Oxoid CM 655) supplemented with Legionella buffered charcoal yeast extract (Oxoid SRII0A) for isolation of M. pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila , respectively. Identification of the bacterial isolates was carried out manually by colony morphology, hemolysis on blood agar, Gram-stained smears, catalase test, coagulase test, and oxidase test (Murray, ) followed by the VITEK® 2 compact system (BIOMÉRIEUX, Marcy l’Etoile, France) using VITEK® 2 ID cards following the manufacturer’s instructions. (c) ELISA assay: sera of patients were tested for the presence of specific IgM antibodies against C. pneumoniae using the Vircell kit (Ref G1007, M1007) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. (d) Conventional PCR: done on sputum samples for detection of nucleic acid of L. pneumophila , M. pneumoniae , and C. pneumoniae. Nasopharyngeal swab PCR results for detection of influenza A and influenza B viruses were obtained from patient’s records. For DNA extraction, sputum samples were processed by adding equal volumes of sputum and Sputolysin/NaoH (0.5% N -acetyl cysteine in 2% NaoH and 1.45% sodium citrate); after vortex, the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min and then adjusted to pH 8 followed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 30 min, and the pellet was washed with sterile water and used for DNA extraction that was carried out using the QIAamp DNA mini kit from QIAgen (code no. 51304). The resultant DNA extract was used for amplification of specific sequences conserved to M. pneumonia e (primers: 5′ CAA GCC AAA CAC GAG CTC CGG CC 3′ and 5′ CCA GTG TCA GCT GTT TGT CCT TCC CC 3′), C. pneumonia (primers: 5′ AGT TGA GCA TAT TCG TGA GG 3′ and 5′ TTT ATT TCC GTG TCG TCC AG 3′), and L. pneumophila (primers: 5′ AGG GTT GAT AGG TTA AGA GC 3′ and 5′ CCA ACA GCT AGT TGA CAT CG 3′). Uniplex PCR reactions were carried out using 1 unit Taq polymerase, 10 μmol/l of primers, 0.2 mmol/l deoxynucleotide triphosphate, and 2.4 mmol/l MgCl 2 in a total volume of 30 μl. PCR reactions were carried out with a PerkinElmer Applied Biosystems 9600 thermal cycler with resulting fragments of 543, 128, and 386 bp, respectively. The annealing of M. pneumoniae , C. pneumoniae , and L. pneumophila primers was at 58 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 57 °C for 45 s, respectively. For atypical organisms, they were considered as a causative organism if they were detected in sputum culture and/or PCR or detection of specific IgM against C. pneumoniae in patient’s serum. 2. Blood samples were processed on a Sysmex blood analyzer for the determination of the complete blood cell counts and differential counts of leukocytes. Then, the differential count was confirmed by Leishman stained blood film. We recorded the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and the absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) and calculated the NLR by dividing the ANC by the ALC. dNLR was calculated as ANC divided by the total WBC count minus the ANC (Forget et al. ). 3. C-reactive protein (CRP) was quantified using the latex enhanced turbidimetric assay. CRP antigen binds with anti-human CRP polyclonal antibody combined with the surface of latex particle. The turbidity of this complex is measured at 630 nm using the HEALES analyzer (Shenzhen Huisong Technology Department Co., Ltd. China). The light scattering intensity is proportional to the content of antigen antibody complex. A value of CRP <10 mg/l was considered as normal.
Statistical analysis
All the collected data were analyzed using SPSS 18 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Descriptive statistics were reported as median (range) for continuous variables and frequency (%) for discrete variables. The Mann–Whitney test was used to compare the numerical data between the two groups, and the Kruskal–Wallis test was used to compare the difference between various groups. The chi-square test and Fisher’s exact test were used for comparing the categorical variables. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used in order to determine the cutoff points for the cell count. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative preventive values, and accuracy were calculated. The correlation between NLR and CRP was analyzed using the Spearman’s rank correlation test.
Results
This study included a total of 187 patients with CAP. They were 118 males and 69 females with ages ranging from 18 to 76 years. According to the microbiological results (Table 1 ), the patients were classified into three groups: 1. Bacterial pneumonia group included 90 patients whose sputum cultures were negative for tubercle bacilli but were positive for streptococci, staphylococci, or Gram-negative bacilli. 2. Tuberculosis pneumonia group included 68 patients whose direct ZN sputum smear was positive for acid fast bacilli, and/or their LJ sputum cultures were positive for M. tuberculosis . 3. Atypical pneumonia group included 29 patients with negative sputa for tubercle bacilli and insignificant pathogenic bacterial growth. The diagnosis of M. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila was based on the results of culture and/or PCR done on sputa. C. pneumoniae was diagnosed according to the results of PCR done on sputa and/or detection of specific IgM in patients’ sera. Diagnosis of H1N5 infection depended on the results obtained from patients’ records for nasopharyngeal swab real-time PCR. These patients were subcategorized into patients with M. pneumoniae (ten cases), C. pneumophila (six cases), L. pneumophil a (six cases), and viral pneumonia (seven cases).

The clinical characteristics of the studied patients are shown in Table 2 . Cough was the main presenting symptom in all patients (100%). Fever and chest pain were the most frequent in patients with atypical pneumonia (86.2, 62.1%, respectively), followed by bacterial pneumonia patients (64.4, 61.1%, respectively) and least in TB pneumonia patients (55.9, 17.6%, respectively). On the other hand, dyspnea and hemoptysis were prominent more in bacterial pneumonia patients (62.2, 36.7%, respectively), followed by TB pneumonia patients (47.1, 22.1%, respectively) and least evident in patients within atypical pneumonia group (34.5, 20.7%, respectively).

Post hoc test revealed that difference in age between studied groups was due to significant difference between patients with TB pneumonia and those with bacterial pneumonia ( p = 0.000). Patients with TB were mostly males in comparison to patients with bacterial CAP ( p = 0.002) and those with atypical pneumonia ( p = 0.02). Fever was the presenting symptom in higher percentage of patients with atypical pneumonia than those with bacterial CAP ( p = 0.02) and those with TB ( p = 0.004). Chest pain was the presenting symptom in fewer percentage of patients with TB than those with bacterial ( p = 0.000) and those with atypical pneumonia ( p = 0.000). Difference in dyspnea as a presenting symptom was due to significant difference between patients with bacterial pneumonia and those with atypical pneumonia ( p = 0.009). Difference in hemoptysis was due to significant difference between patients with TB pneumonia and those with bacterial pneumonia ( p = 0.048).
As shown in Table 3 , there was a significant increase in median value of total WBCs and ANC in patients with bacterial pneumonia as compared to both patients with TB pneumonia (18.7 versus 8.1 and 14.3 versus 5.5, respectively) and patients with atypical pneumonia (18.7 versus 10.4 and 14.3 versus 7.7, respectively). Also, the median values of both NLR and CRP levels were statistically significantly higher among patients with bacterial pneumonia than patients with TB pneumonia (11.6 versus 2.7 for NLR and 195.9 versus 54.7 mg/l for CRP) and patients with atypical pneumonia (11.6 versus 3.6 for NLR and 195.9 versus 145.3 mg/l for CRP). Although patients with bacterial pneumonia showed statistically significantly lower median values of ALC as compared to patients with atypical pneumonia (1.2 versus 1.8), ALC could not differentiate between bacterial and TB ( p = 0.469) or between TB and atypical ( p = 0.139). Comparison between patients with TB pneumonia and those with atypical pneumonia revealed that total WBC, ANC, NLR, and CRP are significantly higher in atypical pneumonia than in TB pneumonia. dNLR differentiated significantly between bacterial and TB pneumonia (3 versus 1.7, p = 0.000) and between TB and atypical pneumonia (1.7 versus 3.0, p = 0.000), but it could not differentiate between bacterial and atypical pneumonia ( p = 0.44).

To differentiate between TB and bacterial pneumonia, ROC curve revealed a higher AUC for NLR (AUC = 0.98, 95% CI; 0.97–0.99) than for CRP (AUC = 0.93, 95% CI; 0.89–0.97). The greatest sum of sensitivity (91.1%) and specificity (100%) of NLR to differentiate bacterial pneumonia from TB pneumonia was identified at a cutoff value of 7.8. The optimal cutoff value of CRP for distinguishing bacterial pneumonia from TB pneumonia was found to be 172.9 mg/l, with 80.0% sensitivity, 97.1% specificity, 97.3% positive predictive value, 78.6% negative predictive value, and 87.3% accuracy (Fig. 1a and Table 4 ). dNLR (AUC = 0.77) was inferior to both NLR (AUC = 0.98) and CRP (AUC = 0.93) in discriminating TB from bacterial pneumonia.

For differentiating pulmonary TB from atypical pneumonia, CRP (AUC = 0.91, 95% CI; 0.85–0.97) was superior to both of NLR (AUC = 0.69, 95% CI; 0.56–0.82) and dNLR (AUC = 0.79, 95% CI; 0.71–0.89) at cutoff values of 2.96, 2.81, and 107.9 for NLR, dNLR, and CRP, respectively (Fig. 1b and Table 4 ).
ROC curves for NLR, dNLR, and CRP for discriminating bacterial pneumonia from atypical pneumonia (Fig. 2 ) revealed that the AUC for NLR (AUC = 0.92, 95% CI; 0.85–1.0) is significantly higher than AUC for CRP (AUC = 0.74, 95% CI; 0.65–0.83). To differentiate between bacterial and atypical pneumonia, the optimal cutoff point was 6.6 for NLR and was 179.1 mg/l for CRP. The discriminative ability of dNLR between bacterial and atypical pneumonia was weak (AUC = 0.55, 95% CI; 0.43–0.67). Fig. 2 ROC curves to differentiate bacterial from atypical pneumonia.

There was no statistically significant difference between subcategories of atypical pneumonia for total WBCs ( p = 0.2), ANC ( p = 0.8), ALC ( p = 0.2), NLR ( p = 0.2), and dNLR ( p = 0.2) (Table 5 ). However, CRP showed a statistically significant difference among these subgroups ( p = 0.000). This difference was attributed to higher median value of CRP in cases with Mycoplasma than either viral, chlamydial ( p = 0.000), or Legionella pneumonia ( p = 0.006) and also due to a higher level of CRP among cases infected with Legionella than those infected with either virus or Chlamydia ( p = 0.000). The only insignificant difference was between viral and chlamydial ( p = 0.618).

As shown in Fig. 3 , There was a moderate significant positive correlation between NLR and CRP in all pneumonic patients ( r = 0.71, p = 0.000). This correlation was also positive and significant among patients with bacterial pneumonia ( r = 0.66, p = 0.000) and among patients with atypical pneumonia ( r = 0.44, p = 0.02), but it was negative and nonsignificant among patients with tuberculosis ( r = −0.19, p = 0.1).

Discussion
The present study evaluated the discriminative power of NLR and dNLR between different causes of CAP in comparison to CRP. Our study revealed a significant increase in total WBCs and ANC in patients with bacterial pneumonia as compared to both patients with TB pneumonia and patients with atypical pneumonia. Moreover, patients with bacterial pneumonia showed statistically significantly lower values of ALC as compared to patients with atypical pneumonia. Previously, it is suggested that the increase in total WBCs and neutrophils is an inflammatory reaction, especially against bacterial infection (Zahorec ). The decrease in ALC has also been observed in many forms of CAP, especially in the acute phase (Fantin et al. ). In the early phase of infection, immune responses of circulating leukocytes are characterized by neutrophilia caused by demargination of neutrophils, suppression of its apoptosis, and stimulation of neutrophil production by stem cells in response to growth factors (Jimenez et al. ). Along with this, margination, redistribution, and increase in lymphocyte apoptosis in spleen and thymus are responsible for the observed depression of ALCs in the peripheral blood (Wesche et al. ; Unsinger et al. ). Also, production of arginase, nitric oxide, and reactive oxygen species by neutrophil could suppress T cell activation (Muller et al. ). Additionally, in CAP patients, the decrease of absolute T cell counts in the peripheral blood is suggested to be caused by a shift of these cells towards the lung to be sequestered in defensive mechanisms (Laurence ).
In the present study, CRP level was statistically significantly higher among patients with bacterial pneumonia than patients with TB pneumonia. It is obvious that the CRP response as an acute-phase reactant is not agent specific. Its level is high for acute bacterial infections and low for viral infections (Ayata et al. ; Papp et al. ). It achieves high levels after 12 h of tissue damage. Especially in acute invasive infections, its serum level is significantly elevated in parallel with the severity of inflammation. CRP was the most useful marker for diagnosis of infection in comparison to other acute-phase reactants such as the procalcitonin, sCD14, and lipopolysaccharide binding protein (Ayata et al. ). So, we evaluated NLR and dNLR as inflammatory markers in CAP by comparing their values to that of CRP.
The main findings in the present study were that neutrophil–lymphocyte count ratio (NLR) was statistically significantly higher among patients with bacterial pneumonia than patients with TB pneumonia. This could be attributed to the fact that CD4 + T lymphocytes and macrophages are considered fundamental during the pathogenesis of TB, but neutrophilia is the principal cellular phenomenon through the progression of bacterial CAP. The greatest sum of sensitivity and specificity of NLR to differentiate bacterial pneumonia from TB was identified at a cutoff value of 7.8 with 91.1% sensitivity, 100% specificity, 100% positive predictive value, 89.5% negative predictive value. and 95% accuracy. These results are comparable to that obtained in a previous study that demonstrated a value of less than 7 as an optimal cutoff value for NLR to discriminate patients with pulmonary TB from patients with bacterial CAP with a sensitivity of 91.1% and a NPV of 88.5% but with lower specificity (81.9%) and positive predictive value 85.7% (Yoon et al. ). NLR reflects the interrelation between the neutrophil number, representing ongoing inflammation, and the lymphocyte number reflecting the immune regulatory pathway (Biyik et al. ). Therefore, the NLR is thought to better predict bacteremia compared to discrimination based on neutrophilia or lymphocytopenia alone (Yoon et al. ).
We demonstrated a statically significantly higher median value of NLR among patients with bacterial pneumonia than patients with atypical pneumonia (11.6 vs 3.6). This is similar to the findings of de Jager and his colleagues, who found that the highest frequency of increased NLR values (>10.0) was among patients with S. pneumoniae infection, but patients with other pathogens such as Coxiella burnetii , M. pneumonia , and influenza A (H1N1) virus often had a NLR value <10.0 (de Jager et al. ). Our results extend previous findings in studies using NLR in diagnosing appendicitis, in predicting bacteremia in infectious emergency admissions, and as an adjunctive diagnostic tool in patients with TB pleurisy using pleural fluid (Goodman et al. ; de Jager et al. ; Burgess et al. ) .
Recently, dNLR has been investigated as an easy, promising marker in a number of clinical conditions. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that further explored the diagnostic validity of dNLR as an infection marker in patients with CAP. In the present study, comparing the discriminative ability of NLR, dNLR, and CRP for TB versus bacterial CAP revealed AUCs of 0.98 for NLR and of 0.77 for dNLR in comparison to 0.93 for CRP. These results extend that of the previous reports (de Jager et al., ; Yoon et al. ).
In our study, in spite of dNLR distinguished between patients with pulmonary TB from patients with bacterial CAP or patients with atypical pneumonia, it could not discriminate atypical from bacterial pneumonia. In addition, it seems that NLR is more accurate than dNLR in differentiating different causative microorganisms of CAP. The base of this observation is not obvious. However, it seems that in the dNLR, the use of total leukocyte count minus neutrophil in the denominator is broadly mixing two types of cells: monocytes and lymphocytes. Normally, the relative proportion of lymphocytes to monocytes is approximately 6:1. In patients with CAP infected with different organisms, there may be a variability in the monocyte count that could be responsible of this difference in diagnostic validity that is observed between NLR and dNLR.
As compared with the previous cohort, the present study revealed moderate significant positive correlation between NLR and CRP in pneumonic patients. NLR seems to be due to relationship between two markers that represent inflammation and host immune response (Oh et al. ).
The present study revealed no statistically significant difference in the discriminative power of total WBCs, ANC, ALC, NLR, and dNLR between subcategories of atypical pneumonia. However, CRP showed a statistically significant difference among these subgroups ( p = 0.000). This difference was attributed to higher mean CRP level in cases with Mycoplasma and Legionella versus viral and chlamydial causes.
Macrolides such as clarithromycin and azithromycin and fluoroquinolones have good activity against M. pneumoniae , C. pneumoniae , and Legionella species (Kuo et al. ; Vergis et al. ; File ). Because the spectrum of drugs used for treating atypical bacterial pneumonia covers the majority of atypical microorganisms, the subcategorical discrimination of atypical bacterial pneumonia is not very important and that is sufficient to distinguish between bacteria, viral, tuberculous, and atypical causes of pneumonia.
Conclusion
NLR is a simple, fast, and easy test that can be used routinely at the early phase of diagnosis as an alternative laboratory infection marker to differentiate patients with bacterial CAP from patients either with TB pneumonia or with atypical CAP. dNLR can be used to distinguish only between patients with pulmonary TB from either patients with bacterial CAP or with atypical pneumonia but cannot be used to discriminate atypical from bacterial pneumonia. Both NLR and dNLR cannot differentiate between different causative microorganisms of atypical pneumonia. NLR is superior to CRP for differentiating bacterial from both of TB and atypical pneumonia, but NLR is inferior to CRP in differentiating pulmonary TB from atypical pneumonia.
