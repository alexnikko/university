Introduction
Bioprospecting introduced enormous promise of additional sources of beneficial products that now confirm the ancient practices associated with Ayurveda (India), TCM (China), and Kampo (Japan) [ ]. Ayurveda is one of the oldest extant health systems in the world with fundamental principles and theory-based practices. Literal meaning of Ayu is life and Veda is knowledge or science [ ]. This traditional Indian system of medicines has long-term history of usage, efficacy, wider public acceptance, and low cost [ ]. Herbs are extensively used for preparation of ayurvedic medicines. Ayurvedic products are of various types, so as to meet the diverse requirements in the treatment of human illness. These includes fermented dosage forms, namely, arishtas (feremented decoctions) and asavas (fermented infusions) [ ]. Aristas and asavas are basically alcoholic preparations. The process is such that alcohol is self-generated to a particular level with maximum alcoholic content being 15 % [ ]. In ayurvedic formulations, the inoculum of yeast required for fermentation comes from herbal source usually Woodfordia fruiticosa. During autumn and summer seasons, fermentation takes place in 6 days. In winter, it takes 10 days. During rainy season and spring, fermentation takes place in 8 days. In the usual practice, 7–10 days are enough in the hot tropical climate and long period of 30 days required at cool climatic conditions. Fermentation vessel is left undisturbed for a month and then opened [ ]. This indicates the change in fermentation rate with variation in temperature. The temperature along with pH has influence on metabolic activity of yeast. Production of alcohol during the fermentation process also gets affected by number of fermenting microorganisms. Like almost all other ethnopharmacology, herbal medicine also faces severe challenges and suffers from insufficient modern research owing to lack of scientific and technologic approaches [ ].
The current study aimed to explore the influence of various process parameters on herbal fermented formulation arjunarishta. Seasonal changes affect the traditional fermentation process; hence, herewith an attempt is made to identify the exact levels of incubation temperature, pH, and inoculums required for preparation of arjunarishta by response surface methodology (RSM). The main objective of work is to bring consistency and reproducibility in manufacturing of arishta. According to our knowledge, this is a unique and first trial made for optimization of ayurvedic formulation using Box–Behnken design of RSM. The alcohol generated during fermentation process facilitates extraction of drugs from herbs, thus considered as the primary response for optimization. Traditional process of arishta preparation is slightly modified for consistency without affecting original composition of formulation.
The bark of Terminalia arjuna (Family—Combretace) has been used for centuries in ayurvedic medicine as cardiotonics for treatment of cardiac disorders [ ]. Arjunarishta is one of the oral liquid formulations available over the counter as a cardiotonic product consist this bark. Investigational studies have revealed bark of T. arjuna exerting significant inotropic and hypotensive effect, increasing coronary artery flow and protecting myocardium against ischemic damage. It has also been detected to have mild diuretic, antithrombotic, prostaglandin E2 enhancing, and hypolipidemic activity. This bark consist triterpenoids—arjunin, arjunic acid, arjunolic acid, and arjungenin; glycosides—arjunetin, arjunoside, and tannin-pyrocatechol; flavanoids—arjunolone and arjunone; gallic acid, ethyl gallate; and β-sitosterol as major bioactive compounds. There is ample clinical evidence of its beneficial effect in coronary artery disease alone and along with statin [ ].
RSM is a statistical method popular in optimization of process parameters as well as constituent levels in drug delivery systems [ , ], fermentation technology [ , , ], extraction [ , ], analytical techniques [ ], etc. It applies quantitative data from an appropriate experimental design to determine or simultaneously solve multivariate equations [ ]. Various experimental designs like central composite design [ , ], Box–Behnken design [ , , ], D-optimal design [ , ], etc. are used for optimization by RSM. Box–Behnken statistical design that is an independent, rotatable or nearly rotatable, quadratic design having the treatment combinations at the midpoints of the edges of the process space and at the center [ ]. Box–Behnken designs have fewer design points. Also, each factor requires only three levels instead of the five required for central composite designs (unless alpha is equal to 1), which may be experimentally more convenient and less expensive to run than central composite designs with the same number of factors [ ].
Material and Methods
Materials
Plant material bark of T. arjuna and flowers of Madhuca indica and W. fruiticosa were collected from forests of Sahydri Ghats of Maharashtra, India, authenticated from the Department of Botany, BST College, Sangamner, Maharashtra, India; fruits of Vitis vinifera (Vinifera) and jaggery were procured from the local market.
Microbiological medium constituents were procured from Himedia, Mumbai, India, and the rest of the reagents were purchased from Loba Chemie, Mumbai, India.
Experimental Design
The three-level, three-factor Box–Behnken design of RSM was selected for study. Incubation temperature, medium pH, and inoculum volume were identified as key process parameters influencing fermentation behavior. These are considered as three independent variables and tested at three different levels (Table 1 ) for the production of alcohol. This design of experiments has total 17 runs including five center points (Table 2 ). An advantage of the Box–Behnken design is that it does not contain combinations for which all factors are simultaneously at their highest or lowest levels. So, these designs are useful in avoiding experiments performed under extreme conditions, for which unsatisfactory results are often obtained [ ]. Conclusions made with respect to the following second-order polynomial equation with owing constraint of the magnitude of coefficients and mathematical signs.

where Y was predicted response (s); β 0 was an intercept, β 1 , β 2 , and β 3 were linear coefficients; β 11 , β 22 , and β 33 were squared coefficients and quadratic term; β 12 , β 13 , and β 23 were interaction coefficients; and A , B , and C were independent variables [ ]. Positive sign before a factor in polynomial equations represents that the response increases with the factor. On the other hand, a negative sign means the response and factors have reciprocal relation [ ].
Formulation Preparation
Isolation and Selection of Microorganism
Dried flowers of W. fruiticosa (L.) Kurz (Lythraceae) were considered as potential sources of microorganisms for fermentative action in traditional arishta [ ]. These flowers were suspended in sterile water, and isolation of yeast cells was carried out on YM agar [ ] (yeast extract-malt extract agar, glucose 1 %, malt extract 0.3 %, yeast extract 0.3 %, peptone 0.5 %, agar 2 %) plates consisting antibiotics by streak plate technique. The yeast strain having maximum alcohol production capacity was screened from isolates on the basis of fermentative capacity as well as ethanol tolerance and preserved for study.
Preparation of Decoction
Raw material as per Ayurvedic Pharmacopoieal specifications (macroscopic characteristics, total ash, acid insoluble ash, and alcohol soluble extractive) were used for formulation preparation. Clean and dry bark of T. arjuna was powdered and passed through sieve number 44. Required quantity of powdered bark was soaked overnight in specified volume of water along with V. vinifera dried fruits and M. indica flowers (Table 3 ). Later, it was heated, reduced to one fourth, and filtered through muslin cloth [ ]. Table 3 Arjunarishta formulation composition Ingredient Quantity Terminalia arjuna bark 4.80 kg Vitis vinifera fruits 2.40 kg Madhuca indica flower 0.96 kg Woodfordia fruiticosa flower 0.96 kg Jaggery 4.80 kg Water 49.152 L
Fermentation
The carbon source jaggery was dissolved in resultant decoction and again filtered. Required quantity of Woodfordia fruticosa dried flowers were added in 200 ml aliquots of filtrate and filled in Erlenmeyer flask. The pH of each flask adjusted with 1 M HCl solution as per experimental design (Table 2 ), sealed, and sterilized in autoclave at 121 °C for 20 min. Then, specified volume of isolated yeast (4 × 10 7 cells/ml) aseptically inoculated in each flask again tightly sealed and incubated at different temperatures as per Table 2 for 30 days.
Determination of Alcohol
Solvent Extraction
Tri- n -butyl phosphate (TBP) has been selected as a solvent for extraction of ethanol from arishta . It has density of 0.9727 g/ml, distribution coefficient for ethanol in water is 0.576, and it has able to show intense color development for alcohol during dichromate oxidation [ ]. The 2.5 ml of arishta sample is diluted with equal fraction of distilled water and mixed with 5 ml TBP by vigorous vortexing for 15 min. Then, these tubes were kept aside for phase separation and upper layer used for dichromate oxidation. Standard solutions of ethanol were prepared by diluting specific amount of absolute alcohol using distilled water and processed similarly.
Dichromate Oxidation and Spectrophotometric Analysis
Three milliliters of TBP layer transferred to new tube and mixed with 3 ml of 8 % ( w / v ) acidified dichromate reagent by shaking at 150 rpm for 10 min. Afterward, the lower layer was separated and subjected to measurement of absorbance at 595 nm using spectrophotometer (Shimadzu-1800).
Optimal Process Parameters
Best process parameters suitable for fermentation of current herbal formulation selected on the basis of quadratic equation were obtained during statistical analysis. The temperature, pH, and inoculum volume produce maximum ethanol in arishta with desirability value one considered as optimal levels. Arjunarishta was prepared in triplicate using obtained optimal levels of selected process parameters and validated for alcohol and gallic acid concentration.
HPTLC Analysis
Estimation of gallic acid concentration in arjunarishta formulated at optimal process parameters is carried out by high-performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) (Camag). The arjunarishta formulation is concentrated in vacuum, 10 mg of it added in 5 ml methanol, filtered through 0.2-μm filter and applied as an 8-mm band on precoated silica gel 60F 254 (Merck Millipore) plates along with suitably diluted standard gallic acid. Toluene, ethyl acetate, and formic acid (5:5:1) were used as mobile phase for the development plates, and detection was carried out at 254 nm.
Results and Discussion
Fermentation Process
Fermented ayurvedic herbal liquid arishtas and asavas are considered as formulations with higher shelf life. Self generated alcohol might contribute for the stability and palatability. Isolation of yeast from Woodfordia fruticosa flowers improves efficiency of fermentation process as number of yeast cells used in process can be easily identified and controlled. It may bring consistency and reproducibility in arishta . This is not possible in traditional method due to impact of storage period and drying on viability of yeasts found in Woodfordia fruticosa flower. Then, these flowers were also added in current arjunarishta formulation to maintain synergistic prospective of herbal medicine. Woodfordia fruticosa have also been reported for immunomodulatory activity [ ]. The V. vinifera and M. indica are fermentation initiator and possible source of nitrogen required in fermentation process. Jaggery supplies carbohydrate in the form of sucrose and other sugars.
Statistical Analysis
The Box–Behnken statistical design of RSM appeared as an effective tool for optimization of ayurvedic formulation. Obtained response in terms of alcohol concentration for all 17 runs was subjected to statistical analysis using Design Expert software. Quadratic model with coefficient of variation (CV) 4.57 % and adjusted R 2 0.99 was suggested for present design. CV describes the extent to which the data were dispersed. Since CV is a measure of expressing standard deviation as a percentage of the mean, the small value of CV give better reproducibility [ ]. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) helps to determine which model, if any, is significant to choose. ANOVA evaluated the significance of each coefficient by p value (less than 0.05) through Fisher’s test [ ]. The F value 250.60 implies that the model is significant. Values of “Prob > F” less than 0.05 indicate that model terms are significant (Table 4 ). The following polynomial equation was proposed in terms of coded factor for alcohol concentration in this model.

This equation can be used to make predictions about the response for given levels of each factor.
Influence of Variables
Among the studied variables, temperature and inoculum volume are effective at higher levels, whereas pH is effective at lower level for maximum production of alcohol. Incubation temperature has remarkable impact on formulation. At constant inoculum volume alcohol content increases with simultaneous increase in pH up to a certain extent but further increase in pH results and decrease in alcohol production (Fig. 1a ). At constant pH, alcohol concentration increases with increase in yeast cell number (Fig. 1b ); however, it seems that further increase of inoculum volume also results, decrease in alcohol production. Indeed, at lower temperature, there is not much more impact of pH as well as inoculum volume on alcohol yield but higher temperature was also not significantly contributing in production. This indicates importance of incubation temperature on arishta preparation process. Controlling of temperature during production may overturn climatic crisis encountering during seasonal variation. At constant level of temperature, production of alcohol increases with slight raise in pH but further elevation of medium pH toward neutralization is not suitable (Fig. 1c ). Higher alcohol production with increased inoculum volume might be due to rapid growth in yeast cell number. However, escalation in cell number does not continuously elevate alcohol level. In these circumstances, concentration of nutritional parameters present in fluid comes in existence. Beginning of nutrient depletion is the rate-limiting step for alcohol production at higher cell number.

Validation of Optimized Formula
As per the prediction tool of Design Expert, the process parameter temperature 33.33 °C, pH 4.73, and inoculum volume 3.25 ml (4 × 10 7 cells/ml) have been identified as the best for maximal production of alcohol in arjunarishta formulation. Estimated alcohol production is 7.56 % ( v / v ) with desirability 1 and standard error of mean 0.0862. Preparation of arjunarishta in triplicate with above process parameters shows production of 7.68 % ( v / v ) alcohol. The gallic acid is the most ubiquitous plant phenolic compound known for its antioxidant activity, and its concentration is used to correlate the total phenolic content of herbs. Antioxidant potentials are important for strengthening cells. Gallic acid content of prepared arishta , also analyzed by HPTLC, had concentration 0.296 % ( w / v ) with retention factor 0.3 at 254 nm (Fig. 2 ).

Conclusion
Ayurvedic formulations are extensively used in Indian subcontinent, and their acceptance also increases in western countries. Implementation of appropriate formulation strategies may enhance regulatory acceptance of complementary medicines. Box–Behnken design of RSM was found efficient in optimization of ayurvedic fermented formulation arjunarishta . This will make preparation of arishta possible in any season and at any place. Applications of such advanced technology in traditional dosage forms may bring improvement in their consistency and safety.
