Highlights
A new assessment tool to evaluate coagulation function of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. The correlation between hypercoagulability and consequent thrombotic complications in PDAC patients. Perioperative anti-thrombotic prophylaxis should be more cautious.
Introduction
Since French physician Armand Trousseau first suggested that thrombophlebitis as a presenting sign of visceral malignancy in 1985, more and more research confirmed that the incidence risks of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in malignancy are 2- to 7-fold than normal [ ]. Unfortunately, Trousseau noticed this eponyms syndrome in his own upper left extremity before the diagnosis of gastric cancer which finally took his life [ ]. Cancers is one of the most important acquired risk factors for the development of VTE, which can express procoagulant proteins and induce the production of inflammatory cytokines that indirectly contribute to the hypercoagulability [ ]. A cancer diagnosis and subsequent systemic therapy can increase the incidence of VTE up to 6.5-fold [ ].
Pancreatic cancer (PC) is currently the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in the USA and the estimated new cases and deaths are 53,670 and 43,090 respectively in 2017 [ ].Tumor origins are a significant risk factor for VTE, the highest incidence of VTE was found in PC, with a RR of 4.34 [ ]. VTE affects up to 40% of PC patients during their course of disease, and development of VTE is associated with a poor prognosis [ , , ].
Several risk assessment models (RAMs) have been suggested to assess the risk of VTE. The Caprini RAM was proposed for both surgical and medical patients and there have been robust evidence to state its validity [ , ]. Plus, the Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis 9th edition guidelines (ACCP-9th ed) for prevention of VTE in nonorthopedic surgical patients recommended it to evaluate the VTE risk in patients undergoing general and abdominal-pelvic surgery for the subsequent prophylaxis [ ]. However, several available validation studies of the Caprini RAM in medical inpatients have controversial conclusions [ , , ]. Thus, searching sensitive tools to identify risk stratification for PC patients remains demand, both for selecting appropriate patients for prophylaxis and reduce the risk for hemorrhage complications.
Thromboelastography (TEG) is a complete analysis of the clotting mechanisms from thrombin activation to fibrinolysis and generates a real-time image of in vitro clot formation include all of the interacting cellular and plasmatic components of a blood sample and their effects on colt formation, strength and eventual lysis [ ]. TEG has been used to identify hypercoagulability in surgical patients and various malignancies [ , , , ], and it was superior to conventional coagulation test for assessing coagulation function [ ]. However, there is currently little literature describing the value of TEG in evaluating coagulation state and predicting VTE in pancreatic cancers. Herein, we want to identify that whether r-TEG can evaluate hypercoagulability of PDAC patients and this abnormal status is associated with subsequent thrombotic complications.
Methods
Seventy-eight patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (definite pathologic diagnosis) and seventy-nine age-matched control patients were retrospectively reviewed for this study. Blood samples were taken before getting written informed consent from patients. Results of age-matched control group were available for analysis. Exclusion criteria for each group include preexisting coagulation or hematological disorders, preoperative anticoagulation, history of recent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug or aspirin use.
Blood samples were taken from patients prior to initiation of treatment. Three milliliters of blood were collected into tubes containing 0.109 mol/L sodium citrate for measuring conventional coagulation. The indices include prothrombin time (PT). International normalized ratio (INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and thrombin time (TT) was measured in a routine setting. For r-TEG assays, five milliliters citrate venous blood samples were performed using the Thromboelastography Analyzer 5000. The major parameters of TEG include TEG-ACT, R, K, angleα and MA. TEG-ACT value (activated clotting time) presents the initiation of thrombin activation and reflects the activity of coagulation factors, and a shorter ACT time indicates high activity of coagulation factors and hypercoagulability. R value (reaction time, normal range: 10–14 min) shows the time for generation of initial fibrin threads formation. K value (coagulation time) measures the speed of fibrin formation. Angleα performs the rate of fibrin formation. Both shorter K and border angleα could reflect strong fibrinogen function and predicts hypercoagulability. MA (maximum amplitude) represents the maximum strength of the clot and the prolonged MA reflects enhancement of platelet function and hypercoagulability.
Comparative data analyses were performed using IBM SPSS version 25.0 and TEG values and conventional coagulation of all patients were compared using independent student t test. A P value less than 0.05 was considered to demonstrate a statistically significant difference. The parameters are presented as a mean ± SD.
Each patient was assessed by Caprini risk assessment model (Caprini RAM) based on the information collected at patient’s admission and available to use. In the Caprini RAM, the risk profile of VTE based on the 39 individual risk factors and according to the modified version by ACCP 9th edition, patients are classified into 4 levels: score 0 as very low risk, score 1–2 as low risk, sore 3–4 as moderate risk and score ≥ 5 as high risk.
Results
Patients characteristics
Seventy-eight patients (31 men and 47 women; median age 55.8 ± 13.7 years) with pancreatic cancers were eligible for this study. All patients were pathologically diagnosed after getting appropriate surgery. Thirty-six tumors were located in the head (include 6 cases in the uncinate) and received pancreaticoduodenectomy. Forty-two cases were in the body and tail and performed distal pancreatectomy (Table 1 ). For Caprini risk assessment model, the median cumulative risk score in pancreatic cancer patients and control group were 5.58 ± 0.84 versus 1.37 ± 0.81 respectively, which can be classified into high risk and low risk respectively.

Thromboelastography and conventional coagulation tests
Compare to the control group. All preoperative TEG parameters had significantly variation while conventional coagulation test didn’t show differences (Table 2 ). For r-TEG assays, PDAC patients had a shorter K value (72. + 24 ± 22.90 vs. 85.63 ± 32.81, P = 0.0014), increased angleα value (76.20 ± 3.68 vs. 74.415 ± 4.73, P = 0.009) and MA value (63.33 ± 7.19 vs. 60.89 ± 5.52, P = 0.18).But for TEG-ACT and R value, both groups showed no significant difference (TEG-ACT: 101.72 ± 7.57 vs. 103.78 ± 7.33, P = 0.086; R value: 32.95 ± 4.72 vs. 34.34 ± 4.61, P = 0.085). Based on the above parameters, PDAC patients had slightly hypercoagulability compare to control patients. Whereas the laboratory values for conventional coagulation test were within normal ranges: PT (11.65 ± 0.95 vs. 11.38 ± 0.79, P = 0.049), INR (1.01 ± 0.09 vs. 0.98 ± 0.08, P = 0.101), aPTT (28.75 ± 3.45 vs. 28.00 ± 2.98, P = 0.149) and TT (19.44 ± 1.12 vs. 19.69 ± 1.35, P = 0.212). Incidence rates of VTE were 3.8% (3 of 78 patients) and 1.3% (1 of 79 patients) respectively (Fisher’s exact test: P = 0.367) (Table 2 ).

Follow-up and outcome
Follow-up was achieved in all patients, ranging from 10.2 to 16.8 months, with a median of 14.3 months. For PDAC patients, all patients received curative surgery with R0 resections and showed no evident recurrence. During the follow-up period, three PDAC patients had thrombogenesis, include two patients with unilateral calf muscular venous thrombosis and one patient with deep veins thrombus of the lower limb. In contrast, only one patient in the control group was found great saphenous vein thrombosis. Incidence rates of VTE in both groups were 3.8% (3 of 78 patients) and 1.3% (1 of 19 patients) respectively and showed no significant difference (Fisher’s exact test: P = 0.367).
Discussion
In the present study, the thromboelastography monitoring showed the relationship between pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and hypercoagulability. We observed that hypercoagulable status is generally among PDAC patients, but this status is hard to be detected by conventional coagulation tests. Conventional coagulation tests only evaluate partial of the coagulation function rather than the whole procedure of coagulation, from the cascade activation of thrombin to fibrinolysis. From this observation we proved that thromboelastography is more evident in assessing coagulation function by quantifying several indexes correlated to the overall process of thrombosis.
More and more research has proposed explaining the hypercoagulable state of pancreatic cancer patients. Multiple biological factors have connection to this status, include genetic factors, procoagulant factors, mucin production and inflammation. The activation of oncogenes (such as KRAS and c-MET) and inactivation of tumor suppressor genes (such as p53) can be regulators of cancer coagulopathy. It is believed that the activation and production of fibrin can provide a scaffold for anchorage and invasion of cancer cells. More than that, coagulation proteins also promote mitogenic and oncogenic signals of importance for tumor invasion and progression [ ]. Transmembrane receptor tissue factors (TF), as an initiator of coagulation, has a determinant effect of tumor progression. Khorana et al. reported that TF expression occurs early in pancreatic neoplastic transformation and is associated with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression, increased microvessel density and possibly clinical VTE in pancreatic cancer [ ]. Poruk et al. reported that high platelet factor 4 (PF4) serum levels have an increased risk for the development of VET and poor survival [ ]. Pancreatic cancers usually have a closely connection with aberrant expression and glycosylation of mucins. In vivo analysis, injection of carcinoma mucins into mice can develop platelet-rich microthrombi through P-selectin and L-selectin [ , ]. Tumor cells often secrete plenty of proinflammatory cytokines thus contribute to the hypercoagulable state of malignancy, and inflammation can impact fibrinolytic system and promote thrombosis and cancer. A prospective cohort study of 240 patients undergoing surgery indicated that patients with MA > 68 mm have increased incidence of postoperative thromboembolic complications compared with patients whose MA ≤ 68 mm from the TEG data performed within 2 h after surgery [ ].
Besides the hypercoagulable state derived from the tumor itself, different treatment strategies also contribute to the abnormal of coagulation function. Treatment includes surgical resection, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, immune and biological treatment. Local tissue damage caused by these strategies, tumor cell necrosis, vascular endothelial cell injury initiate procoagulant mechanism, inflammatory factors and procoagulant release, hemodynamic changes can cause a hypercoagulable state. Until now, surgical resection is still the only approach to get completely healing for pancreatic cancer [ ]. Thus both the ACCP-9th ed guidelines for prevention of VTE for nonorthopedic surgical patients and the European enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) guidelines for perioperative care for pancreaticoduodenectomy suggest perioperative anti-thrombotic prophylaxis. In the ACCP-9ed guidelines, pharmacologic prophylaxis with low molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) was recommended for general and abdominal-pelvic surgery patients at high risk of VTE (Caprini score ≥ 5) who are not at high risk for major bleeding complications [ ]. In the European ERAS guidelines, it is recommended that LMWH reduces the risk of thromboembolic complications and administration should be continued for 4 weeks after hospital discharge [ ].
Combine the previous literature and present study, most pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients are accompanied with a hypercoagulable state, and TEG can quantify and indicate this abnormity. However, the present data showed statistical significance between PDAC patients and control group, but this detectable hypercoagulability does not increase the incidence rate of thrombotic events. Although several TEG indexes (K, angleα and MA) showed statistical difference compared to control group, these indexes only reflect the post-startup process of thrombosis. The index TEG-ACT and R, which reflect the initial of thrombosis, had no difference between PDAC patients and controls. That means, this hypercoagulability only exists the subsequent process and accelerates the thrombi formation and does not increase the triggers for thrombosis. Based on this hypothesis, the decision of perioperative anti-thrombotic prophylaxis especially the use of antithrombotic drugs should be more cautious in consideration of postoperative hemorrhage risk and medical costs.
In conclusion, r-TEG may be a valuable tool to monitor and quantify the overall process and dynamic variation of coagulation and indicate disorders. The hypercoagulability of PDAC patients mainly reflects the acceleration in thrombi formation rather than the initial stage and has less connection with subsequent thrombotic complications. Longer period of follow-up may have different conclusion but the high risk of recurrence for pancreatic adenocarcinoma may affect the results. Mechanical prophylaxis such as elastic stockings and intermittent pneumatic compression is necessary, but the effects and hemorrhage risk of antithrombotic drugs need further study to confirm. Regular surveillance for PDAC patients should not only focus on the recurrence of primary tumors but also the thrombotic events, and TEG could be a valuable tool to monitor the coagulation status.
