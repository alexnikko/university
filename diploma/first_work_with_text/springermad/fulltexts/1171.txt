Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common primary malignancy of the liver in men and the seventh most common cancer in women. Chronic HBV or HCV infection is one of the leading risk factors for HCC globally beside, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and exposure to alcohol and/or aflatoxin [ , , , , ]. The distribution of the risk factors of HCC is highly variable according to geographic region and race or ethnic group [ ]. HCC is usually associated with asymptomatic progression to advanced stages and a high rate of recurrence even after curative treatments of the primary tumors [ ].
Toll-like receptors (TLRs) include a family of receptors that distinguish diverse ligands, including pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) [ , ]. The human TLR is made up of 11 members, possessing a leucine-rich repeat domain in their extracellular domain and a Toll/interleukin (IL)-1 receptor domain in their intracellular domain [ , ] which is responsible for recognizing different bacterial, viral, and fungal structures [ , , ].
Each TLR has specific ligands, which allow the host to sense a wide diversity of pathogens [ ]. Ligand binding by TLR initiates the recruitment of adapter proteins that activate specific signaling pathways such as TANK-binding kinase 1and IL-1 receptor-associated kinase family. The recruitment of these adapters initiate pathways leading to the activation of their respective transcription factors, for the induction of inflammatory cytokine genes with subsequent release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor which are excellent targets for inflammatory diseases [ ].
The crucial role of TLR depends on initiating two arms of the immune response, namely, the innate and the adaptive immune responses that work together to fight infections [ ]. Monocytes express all TLRs, of which TLRs 1, 2, and 4 are present at high levels [ ]. Additionally, T cells express all TLRs at low levels except TLR5, which is present abundantly [ , ].
Emerging evidences points to the important role of TLR in immune and inflammatory diseases. TLR-activated tumor cells may provide sufficient signals that act as a molecular link between inflammation and cancer [ ]. Previously, it was found that mice deficient in TLRs develop less inducible tumors in experimental models [ , ].
Hepatocellular carcinoma is a good example for the link between chronic inflammation and cancer [ , ]. The continued exposure of the liver to gut-derived bacterial products, viral infection, alcohol, or other products via portal vein may result in chronic liver damage [ , , , , , ], so increasing the risk for HCC. Subsequently, TLRs play a major role in liver physiology and pathophysiology, due to their role in the innate immune system and their significant contribution to several biological processes such as regulation of inflammation, wound healing, induction of adaptive immune responses, promotion of epithelial regeneration, and carcinogenesis [ ]. Activation of TLRs was reported to be involved in the progression of the inflammation-fibrosis-HCC axis [ , , ].
So far, little is known about the expression of TLRs in HCC patient. Therefore, we aimed in this study to assess the prognostic value of TLR2 and TLR4 expression on circulating monocytes in HCC patients and correlate their levels with clinical and laboratory data.
Materials and methods
This study was a case-control study. The study population was 40 patients diagnosed with HCC. The patients were recruited to Assiut University Hospitals and South Egypt Cancer Institute. In addition, 38 healthy individuals of comparable age and sex were enrolled as controls.
The study was approved by the institutional review board and all patients provided written informed consent before enrollment.
All cases were diagnosed on clinical basis, with imaging and pathological confirmation of the tumor (if needed).
All patients and controls were subjected to complete blood count (CBC) that was done by fully automated blood counters (Celltac E automated hematology analyzer, Tokyo, Japan). Also, serum albumin and liver function tests were evaluated using Cobas Integra 400 Chemistry Analyzer (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). In addition, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was done for all patients by Access 2 (Beckman Coulter, USA).
Flow cytometric detection of monocyte subsets and their TLR2 and TLR4
One hundred microliters of blood sample was stained with 10 μl of each of fluoroisothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated CD282 (TLR2), phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated CD284 (TLR4), and peridinium-chlorophyll-protein (Per-CP)-conjugated-CD14 (all from Becton Dickinson (BD) Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA, except CD284 from eBiosciences, San Diego, CA, USA). After incubation for 20 min at 4 °C in the dark, red blood cells lysis was done. The cells were suspended in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and analyzed by FACSCalibur flow cytometer with Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences, USA). About 20,000 events were acquired. Anti-human IgG isotype-matched negative control was used with each sample. Scatter was used to define the monocytes population. Then, monocytes were gated using the expression of CD14. The expression of TLR2 and TLR4 were assessed on monocytes as a geometric mean of fluorescence intensity (MFI) (Fig. 1 ).

Diagnosis and treatment plans for HCC patients in the study
The diagnosis of HCC depends mainly on triphasic multi-phasic CT or MRI of the abdomen with contrast for nodules ≥ 10 mm using Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System ( LI-RADS) criteria that include arterial phase enhancement, venous or delayed porto-venous phase washout appearance, enhancing capsular appearance, and threshold growth. Hepatic nodules that did not fulfill these criteria underwent biopsy.
All patients were evaluated by abdominal U/S, triphasic multislice CT pelviabdominal and chest, and in some patients MRI diffusion abdomen, PET/CT scan (because of limited sensitivity of PET/CT, it was not used for diagnosis but for metastatic workup), and bone scan for proper metastatic work up and proper volumetric study for remnant liver tissue were done.
All HCC patients enrolled in the study were clinically and radiologically evaluated for the possibility of surgical resection based on adequate liver function; Child-Pugh class A without portal hypertension, solitary lesion without major vascular invasion, and adequate future liver remnant (FLR) with at least 20% without liver cirrhosis or at least 30–40% with Child-Pugh class A, in addition to adequate vascular and biliary inflow/outflow.
Three patients underwent non-anatomical wide local resection, Two patients underwent anatomical segmental resection, 2 patients were submitted to left hepatectomy, and 18 patients were inoperable due to medical comorbidity, multiplicity of lesions, or metastasis which made patients unfit for surgery.
Inoperable patients were treated either with curative intent through TACE (15 patients), and RFA (5 patients) given to those with solitary mass not more 5 cm or 2–3 lesions each not more than 3 cm, or palliative intent through systemic therapy by sorafinib (5 patients) given to those with Child-Pugh A or B ECOG PS ≤ 2. Although HCC is minimally responsive to systemic chemotherapy, capecitabine and GEMOX regimens were given to some patients (five patients). Supportive treatment was only offered to this difficult population in an effort to provide care for those with Child class C cirrhosis and contraindications for transplantation (three patients); various hormonal and biologic agents have been tried with minimal success, including tamoxifen, antiandrogens (e.g., cyproterone and ketoconazole), and octreotide, and our treatments focused mainly on pain control, ascites, edema, and portosystemic encephalopathy management (Fig. 2 ). Fig. 2 Different types of treatment for HCC patients
Follow up
Traditionally, therapeutic response has been assessed by serial imaging of tumor burden according to either RECIST, WHO, or EASL criteria that based mainly on repeated tumor size measurement. However, in the setting of liver-directed therapies, and targeted therapies simple anatomical size changes are less informative, so reduction of tumor vascularity and tumor necrosis may not be associated with size shrinkage; these factors were assessed by contrasted dynamic CT or MRI that were done 1 month after surgical resection and ablative therapies, then every 2–3 months. Also, assessment of response to TKI (sorafenib) was done every 2 months but assessment of toxicity was done monthly that necessitated repeated CBC and blood chemistries; assessment continued to determine the overall survival of these patients. The range of follow-up period was 2–33 months with a mean of 10.487 months.
Patients were categorized according to the response to treatment as follows: complete response (CR); all target lesions gone, partial response (PR); ≥ 30% decrease from baseline, progressive disease (PD); ≥ 20% increase from smallest sum of longest diameter recorded since treatment started (best response), stable disease (SD); neither PD nor PR.
Statistics
The study was designed mainly to test the null hypothesis that toll-like receptors had no impact on treatment response and overall survival. Also, they were not correlated with different clinical and laboratory characteristics in HCC patients.
Descriptive data in the form of mean, median, range, standard deviation, and percentages were used; Mann-Whitney U test and independent t test were used to find a relation between two groups of quantitative variables, chi square test between ≥ 2 groups of categorical variables, and one-way ANOVA test for the relation between categorical and quantitative variables, and all of these relations were considered significant at P value < 0.05. Pearson correlation was used to determine the relations and magnitude of these relations between TLRs and different treatment outcomes. Kaplan-Meier was used for determination of the median overall survival and Log-rank test for determination of the impact of different prognostic factors on survival. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the interval from diagnosis to the date of death from any cause or last follow up. And all our results were calculated using SPSS ver. 21.

Laboratory characteristics of patient groups according to hepatic focal lesions (Table 3)
According to hepatic focal lesions, our patients were divided into five groups. Group 1 included 9 patients with single focal lesion less than 5 cm Group 2 included 12 patients with single focal lesion more than 5 cm Group 3 included 5 patients with two focal lesions less than 5 cm Group 4 included 6 patients with two focal lesions more than 5 cm Group 5 included 8 patients with multiple focal lesions Table 3 Laboratory characteristics of patients groups according to hepatic focal lesions Variable Group 1 (9) Group 2 (12) Group 3 (5) Group 4 (6) Group 5 (8) p value Hemoglobin (gm/dl) 8.92 ± 0.82 9.58 ± 0.58 10.10 ± 1.22 9.074 ± 1.72 9.28 ± 0.60 0.9 Platelet count(10 9 /L) 74.69 ± 8.899 95.49 ± 10.96 88.20 ± 11.56 74.77 ± 13.64 87.27 ± 8.50 0.6 Total bilirubin (mg/dL) 2.61 ± 1.22 1.84 ± 0.74 2.20 ± 0.61 2.99 ± 0.94 1.51 ± 0.31 0.9 Direct bilirubin (mg/dL) 2.30 ± 1.075 1.63 ± 0.65 1.93 ± 0.54 2.63 ± 0.83 1.33 ± 0.28 0.9 Albumin (gm/L) 3.55 ± 0.28 3.59 ± 0.28 3.25 ± 0.24 2.67 ± 0.28 3.18 ± 0.32 0.5 ALT (U/L) 105.20 ± 29.53 71.17 ± 9.61 166.94 ± 39.13 256.84 ± 10.60 157.70 ± 33.69 <0.001 AST (U/L) 99.87 ± 20.81 73.47 ± 10.81 134.86 ± 17.59 168.93 ± 9.83 130.57 ± 22.29 0.02 AFP (ng/ml) 39.14 ± 20.05 267.71 ± 26.56 1717.7 ± 578.00 7038.9 ± 1961.28 12,735.0 ± 800.64 <0.001 Monocytes (%) 13.13 ± 1.12 11.07 ± 0.85 12.24 ± 2.42 12.73 ± 2.20 8.73 ± 2.0974 0.3 TLR 2 (%) 74.98 ± 16.86 65.61 ± 9.72 106.25 ± 29.06 140.47 ± 4.51 118.75 ± 15.76 0.02 TLR 4 (%) 87.97 ± 17.99 82.51 ± 9.72 69.03 ± 7.20 129.74 ± 21.03 170.98 ± 8.02 <0.001 Group 1: 9 patients with single focal lesion less than 5 cm.

Group 5: 8 patients with multiple focal lesions. Data represented as means ± SEM. One-way ANOVA, p < 0.05 is significant ALT alanine transaminase, AST aspartate transaminase, AFP alpha-fetoprotein, TLR toll-like receptor
We found that some laboratory data were significantly increased in patients with the increase in the number of hepatic focal lesions.
Patients in groups 3, 4, and 5 showed significantly higher levels of ALT, AST, and AFP than did patients in groups 1 and 2, with p value < 0.001 for ALT and AFP and p value = 0.02 for AST.
Also, the expression of TLR 2 on monocytes was significantly increased in patients of groups 3, 4, and 5 than those in groups 1 and 2, with p value = 0.02. The expression of TLR 4 on monocytes was significantly increased in patients of groups 4 and 5 than in patients in groups 1, 2, and 3, with p value < 0.001 implicating that TLR 4 was associated with higher HCC stages.
There were no significant differences in hemoglobin concentration, and WBC and platelets counts between the 5 groups. Also, there were no significant differences in levels of bilirubin, albumin, and blood monocytes between the groups.
Correlation between monocyte subsets and their TLR2 and TLR4 in hepatocellular carcinoma patients and some investigated parameters (Table 4)
There were strong positive correlations between levels of TLR 2 and TLR 4 on monocytes and ALT, AST, and AFP. While, there was negative correlation between albumin level and expression of TLR 4 on monocytes. Table 4 Correlations between monocytes and their TLR2 and TLR4 in hepatocellular carcinoma patients with some of the investigated parameters Parameters Monocytes TLR 4 TLR 2 ALT (U/L) r p value − 0.2 0.3 0.7 < 0.001 0.7 0.002 AST (U/L) r p- value − 0.2 0.3 0.7 < 0.001 0.7 0.002 AFP (ng/ml) r p value − 0.3 0.2 0.7 < 0.001 0.8 < 0.001 OS r p value + 0.142 0.383 − 0.7 < 0.001 − 0.4 0.002 Albumin (gm/L) r p value 0.1 0.7 − 0.4 0.05 − 0.3 0.2 Pearson correlation; r Pearson’s correlation coefficient, significant p value <0.05 ALT alanine transaminase, AST aspartate transaminase, AFP alpha-fetoprotein, TLR toll-like receptor, OS overall survival
However, there were no significant correlations between the levels of monocytes, TLR2 and TLR4 with hemoglobin concentration, WBC count, platelet count, and bilirubin level in HCC patients (data not shown).
Relation between the mean percentages of TLRs 2 and 4 and treatment response (Table 5)
The mean percentages of TLR 2 and 4 were higher among HCC patients with poor response to treatment (170.5 ± 8 and 118.5 ± 18 in patients with PD and 114.1 ± 10 and 90 ± 10 in patients with SD, respectively) than among HCC patients with good response to treatment (43.1 ± 3and 71 ± 19 in patients with CR and 87 ± 11and 79 ± 19 in patients with PR, respectively). The difference was significant for TLR 2 ( p < 0.0001) but not for TLR 4 ( p = 0.2).

Analysis of the overall survival among HCC patients
The mean overall survival (OS) of our HCC patients was 12.7 ± 1.5 months and the median was 10 months (95% CI 7.4–12.6) (Fig. 3 ). Fig. 3 The median OS of all HCC patients was 10 months (95% CI 7.4–12.6)
TLR2 and TLR4 have shown moderate to strong negative correlations with the mean OS ( r = − 0.7, p < 0.001 and r = − 0.4, p = 0.002, respectively) (Table 4 and Fig. 4 ). Furthermore, linear regression analysis of factors affecting OS has shown that TLR4 was the most influential factor on OS followed by TLR2 (Table 6 ).

Discussion
Liver functions, indicating patient overall status, are useful prognostic factors of poor outcome in advanced cancer patients. Consistent with previous studies [ , , , , , ], the liver functions of our patients were significantly affected. The total and direct bilirubin, ALT, and AST were significantly increased in HCC patients than in the controls. Groups of patients with more advanced hepatic focal lesions (group 3, 4, and 5) showed significant increase in the levels of ALT and AST than did the other groups. Moreover, serum albumin levels of our HCC patients were significantly decreased compared to the controls.
The overexpression of AFP in human HCC may be useful not only in the diagnosis but also in the prognosis and follow-up, beside screening and monitoring of the treatment responses in HCC [ , , ]. However, serum AFP values are influenced by non-neoplastic factors, such as the presence of viral hepatitis or cirrhosis [ ]. Our patients showed high levels of AFP with significant increase in groups with more advanced hepatic focal lesions (group 3, 4, and 5) than the in other groups.
The breakdown of the gut barrier and translocation of intestinal bacteria and bacterial pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) may trigger chronic inflammation which is the major contributor to hepatocellular carcinomas [ , , , , ]. TLR4 promote liver’s inflammatory response which may result in hepatocarcinogenesis [ ] and hepatic fibrosis [ , ] through binding to microbial lipopolysaccharide (LPS-TLR4) [ , , ]. Intestinal microbiota and TLR4 were not required only for HCC initiation, but also for HCC progression, mediating increased proliferation, production of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-a, IL-6), expression of the hepatomitogen epiregulin, and prevention of apoptosis. Gut sterilization, or TLR4 inactivation, significantly reduced the development of HCC [ ]. Mice deficient in TLR4 and myeloid differentiation factor (MyD88), but not TLR2, have marked decreases in the incidence, size, and number of chemical-induced liver cancer, indicating a strong contribution of TLR signaling to hepatocarcinogenesis [ , ]. Therefore, it seems clear that TLRs play a role in the inflammation-associated liver cancer development. This is consistent with our results; the expression of TLR 4 on monocytes was significantly higher in patients than in controls, in patients with more progressive HCC than in those with lower progression and also in patients with poor response to treatment than in those with good response.
Besides its known role in chronic inflammation, TLR2 signaling also mediates immune evasion of tumor cells and tumor advancement [ ]. Still, its role in HCC progression remains obscure. In line with previous reports [ , ], our HCC patients have shown significantly increased expression of TLR 2 on monocytes compared with controls. Its expression was also higher in patients in groups 3, 4, and 5 than in patients in groups 1 and 2, in addition to patients with poor response to treatment than to patients with better treatment response.
Moreover, we detected significant direct correlations between levels of TLR 2 and TLR 4 on peripheral monocytes and ALT, AST, and AFP, in addition to significant inverse correlations between levels of TLR 2 and TLR 4 on monocytes and the overall survival of HCC patients. These results were consistent with those of Zhe et al. [ ] who studied the expression levels of TLR2 and TLR4 on HCC cells. Bo Hao et al.’s [ ] meta-analysis proved that high expression of TLR4 was significantly associated with poor OS (pooled HR = 2.05; 95% CI (1.49–2.49, P < 0.001), and our results came in agreement with the previous one implicating that TLR4 is a novel prognostic biomarker that could potentially help to improve treatment decision-making of many solid tumors including HCC.
Study limitations
The expression of TLR2 and TLR4 was investigated in the peripheral blood only. The expression level should have been investigated in the liver tissue to give a real image for what is happening on the tumor microenvironment.
Conclusion
The results of the current study suggest that increased expression ofTLR2 and TLR4 on peripheral monocytes might reflect the development and progression of HCC and can be used to indicate poor prognosis. In addition, high expression of TLR2 correlated significantly with poor response to treatment, while high expression of both TLR2 and TLR4 were associated with poor survival. Our findings will help to design more studies on the role of TLRs in HCC pathogenesis and prognosis which may provide new therapeutic targets for HCC.
