Introduction
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a disease with many different symptoms and transient to lifelong cognitive and sensorimotor disabilities. The complex and intertwined mechanisms responsible for these disabilities can be roughly separated in primary and secondary injuries. The primary injury is the initial biomechanical trauma (Stemper and Pintar ), a process that causes neuronal, axonal and vascular damage induced by the kinetic energy. However, this primary trauma triggers a cascade of secondary processes that result in excitotoxicity, necrosis, apoptosis, autophagy and free radical formation (Blennow et al. ). Due to this cascade of events, TBI is considered to be a chronic disease (Masel and DeWitt ). Furthermore, this implicates that the pathophysiological and inflammatory processes in the brain occur at different times after the injury, where some are beneficial to recovery and others are triggered by the injury and aggravate the initial damage.
One of the key features of TBI is the robust inflammatory response, characterized by release of cytokines and chemokines (Woodcock and Morganti-Kossmann ), activation of glia cells in the brain and invasion of peripheral immune cells, e.g. leucocytes and macrophages due to leakiness of the blood–brain barrier (Lozano et al. ). The inflammatory response in TBI represents both beneficial/restorative and detrimental/degenerative mechanisms in the restorative process (Schwarzmaier and Plesnila ). Pro-inflammatory stimuli trigger morphological and functional changes in microglia, the principal immune cells of the brain, termed “microglia activation”. An important result of microglia activation is the change in the translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO), located at the contact sites between the outer and inner mitochondrial membrane (Jaremko et al. ). This protein is expressed at low levels in the healthy brain, but markedly upregulated in response to injury (Papadopoulos and Lecanu ) and neuroinflammation (Chen and Guilarte ). This upregulation is primarily attributed to activation of microglia, however not restricted to these cells alone. TSPO upregulation was also reported on astrocytes (Kuhlmann and Guilarte ; Maeda et al. ) and found to be co-localized with TSPO selective radioligand binding (Yu et al. ). Irrespective of the triggering event and underlying cellular source of the TSPO changes, its upregulation is regarded as an important biomarker of neuroinflammation (Liu et al. ) and brain injury (Papadopoulos and Lecanu ). Notably, imaging changes in TSPO binding with selective radiotracers in patients offers a unique opportunity to study inflammatory processes in vivo. For this purpose, a number of radiolabelled small molecules with superior affinity and selectivity, compared to the prototypical TSPO ligand PK11195, have been developed (Trapani et al. ). Specifically, 6-chloro-2-(4′-(123)I-iodophenyl)-3-(N,N-diethyl)-imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-3-acetamide (CLINDE) is such a second-generation ligand, characterized by high affinity, brain uptake and signal-to-noise ratio (Arlicot et al. ; Mattner et al. ). In preclinical settings, [ 125 I]CLINDE was found to be selective for TSPO, characterized by lack of specific binding in TSPO knockout mice (Banati et al. ) and robust upregulation of TSPO binding was previously demonstrated with the radioligand in animal models of e.g. excitotoxicity, focal ischaemia and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (Mattner et al. ; ; Arlicot et al. , , ). Furthermore, our research group recently applied [ 123 I]CLINDE to image regulation of TSPO in patients with cerebral stroke or glioblastoma, where it was found to predict infarct size and tumour progression, respectively (Feng et al. ; Jensen et al. ). In addition, [ 123 I]CLINDE was applied to demonstrate the effect of immunotherapy in a patient suffering from anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis (Jensen et al. ). However, like most of the second-generation TSPO ligands (Owen et al. ), [ 123 I]CLINDE binding in humans is affected by the rs6971 single-nucleotide polymorphism, resulting in high, mixed and low-affinity binders (Feng et al. ).
In animal models of TBI, [ 123 I]CLINDE might serve as a biomarker to monitor and quantify therapeutic effects. In order to study the time- and region-dependent changes of TSPO after TBI, we assessed changes of the protein with in vitro autoradiography employing [ 123 I]CLINDE.
Materials and Methods
The experimental protocols were approved by the local ethic committee. All animal experiments were authorized by the local governmental authorities (licence number TVV 22/09).
Controlled Cortical Impact Model of Traumatic Brain Injury
For the experiments, a total of 64 male, adult (55–70 days, weight: 291 ± 31 g) Sprague–Dawley rats (Janvier, France) were used with post surgery survival time points of 6, 24, 72 h and 28 days. Each time point consisted of 16 rats that were randomly assigned to receive either TBI ( n = 5), craniotomy ( n = 3) or sham operation ( n = 5). Additional three rats per group received no anaesthesia or surgery and served as naive controls.
Prior to the experiments, animals were kept in cages (4–6 in each) under controlled conditions of temperature and humidity and were subjected to a 12/12 h dark/light cycle. After surgery, animals were housed in individual cages with nutrition and water ad libitum.
Surgical procedures and the injury model were previously described in detail (Donat et al. , ). Rats were intramuscularly anaesthesized with fentanyl (0.005 mg/kg, Janssen, Germany), midazolam (2 mg/kg, Ratiopharm, Germany) and medetomidine (0.15 mg/kg, Pfizer, Germany). The animals received perioperative analgesia with metamizole (100 mg/kg, Ratiopharm, Germany).
Body temperature was maintained at 37 °C during surgery through a thermistor rectal probe feedback-controlled heating pad (FHC Inc., USA). Subsequently, the animals were placed in a stereotactic frame, the hair was removed and the scalp disinfected with povidone iodine. A midline incision exposed the skull (Sham, Craniotomy and TBI group).
Animals (craniotomy and TBI group) were subjected to a unilateral 6 mm circular craniotomy with an electrical dental drill over the M1 motor cortex (3.5 mm posterior, +4.0 mm lateral to bregma) of the left hemisphere, with intact dura. The bone flap was stored in sterile saline until reimplantation.
For TBI, a unilateral focal injury (TBI group, controlled cortical impact, CCI) to the left hemisphere was inducedwith a 5 mm-diameter rounded metal impactor, electromagnetically driven by a CCI device (Custom Design and Fabrication, Virginia Commonwealth University, USA). The exposed dura was hit by the impactor for 100 ms at a velocity of 4 m/s and a depth of 2 mm, resulting in a moderate injury (Yu et al. ). For craniotomy, the brain was exposed to serve as a control for the surgery procedure. Immediately after this procedure, the bone flap was replaced and fixed with a non-toxic light-curing embedding resin (TechnoVit ® 7200, Heraeus Kulzer, Germany). The incision was sutured (in case of the 6-h group, animals were stapled) and anaesthesia antagonized with a subcutaneous injection of a mixture of naloxone (0.12 mg/kg, Ratiopharm, Germany), flumazenil (0.2 mg/kg, Roche, Germany) and atipamezole (0.75 mg/kg, Pfizer, Germany). The rats were returned to individual cages and received post-operative analgesia with metamizole, once injected post-operatively (100 mg/kg metamizole i.m) and later added to the drinking water. At designated times after surgery, rats were lightly anaesthetized with the same mixture as described above and the animals subsequently decapitated. After decapitation, the brain was quickly removed and immediately frozen in −40 °C 2-methylbutane for at least 30 s and stored at −80 °C until further processing.
Tissue Preparation
Coronal whole-brain sections (12 µm) were cut with a cryostat microtome (MICROM HM 560, Walldorf, Germany), mounted onto untreated glass slides [25 × 45 mm (three sections); Carl Roth, Germany] and briefly dried at room temperature and stored at −28 °C until further processing.
In Vitro Autoradiography of [123I]CLINDE
[ 123 I]CLINDE was supplied by MAP Medical Technologies Oy (Tikkakoski, Finland), prepared according to GMP standards for clinical use with a maximum specific activity of 8800 TBq/mmol.
Autoradiography was performed similar to previously published methods with [ 125 I]CLINDE (Mattner et al. ). To achieve a concentration of 3 nMol/L, the specific activity was lowered by adding unlabelled CLINDE (kindly supplied by Dr. N. Arlicot) to the assay buffer.
All sections were thawed for 15 min at room temperature (RT) and 20 min preincubated in assay buffer (50 mM TRIS–HCl, pH 7.4/RT). Afterwards, the sections were incubated under gentle agitation for 60 min at RT with assay buffer containing the radioligand. Non-specific binding was determined on adjacent sections of the same animal with the radioligand and 10 µM PK11195 (Biotrend, Switzerland). Subsequently, slides were washed for 2 × 2 min in washing buffer (50 mM TRIS–HCl, pH 7.4/4 °C) and 30 s in ice-cold ultra-pure water. All slides were then airstream dried for 20 min and exposed to BAS-SR2040 imaging plates (Fuji Film, Japan) together with 14 C-standards (0146 N, American Radiolabelled Chemicals, USA) for 20 min.
Autoradiography Data Analysis
For analysis of [ 123 I]CLINDE binding, imaging plates were scanned using a Bioimager (BAS 2500, Fuji, Japan), converted to TIF files using the manufacturer’s software and analysed in QuantityOne (BioRad, Waltham, USA). Regions of interest (ROIs; Figs. 1 c, 2 c) were drawn over the primary motor cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, parietal association and barrel field of the primary somatosensory cortex, confirmed by Nissl and Gallays staining (Figs. 1 b, 2 b) on adjacent sections of naïve animals. All ROIs were determined in each single animal (within-subject design) in triplicate (three sections per animal). Mean values of optical density per mm 2 were converted to radioactive concentration using a linear regression derived from the 14 C-radioactive standards. A global background was subtracted, and the values were normalized to the mean values of the corresponding brain regions of the naïve group. Final values are expressed as percentage of mean binding of the naïve group.

Immunohistochemistry
Coronal sections were fixed for 20 min in 4 % paraformaldehyde solution (in phosphate buffered saline, PBS) at 4 °C. Slides were washed afterwards 3 × 10 min in PBS and were dried at RT.
Sections were quenched with hydrogen peroxide (0.6 %) and MeOH (10 %) in PBS. Slides were washed again (3 × 5 min) in 1× PBS and afterwards incubated in blocking solution (5 % normal goat serum, 2 % BSA, 0.2 % Triton X-100 in PBS) to block endogenous peroxidase and non-specific binding, respectively. Sections were then incubated overnight at 4 °C in a humidified chamber with the primary mouse monoclonal antibody OX-42 (1:500; AbD Serotec, Puchheim, Germany), recognizing the complement type three receptor present on cells of microglial lineage, as well as granulocytes and dendritic cells (Robinson et al. ). Afterwards, the sections were rinsed 3 × 10 min in PBS and incubated 90 min in secondary polyclonal anti-mouse biotinylated antibody (1:1000 with 2 % BSA and 0.2 % TX in PBS, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, USA). Slides were washed again 3 × 10 min in PBS before incubation for 1 h with 0.4 % avidin–biotin–peroxidase complex solution (Vectastain ABC kit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, USA) in PBS with 0.1 % TX. After rinsing (3 × 10 min in PBS), the immunoreaction was developed with diaminobenzidine as chromagen (0.1 % DAB and 0.03 % H 2 O 2 in Tris–HCl, pH 7.6). Slides were dehydrated in an ascending series of ethanol, followed by xylene and mounted in Pertex. Images were digitized with a CCD scanner (HP ScanJet 3800).
Real-Time Quantitative PCR
For determination of mRNA levels of TSPO with qPCR, additional five animals were subjected to TBI or sham operation and sacrificed after 72 hours.
Total RNA was extracted from sampled frozen tissue blocks (~1 mm 3 , taken from the injured M1 motor cortex), with an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, and dissolved in RNase-free water. The content of RNA was determined with a NanoDrop ND-2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA). Extracted RNA was reverse transcribed into single-stranded cDNA with the ImPromII™ Reverse Transcription System (Promega, Madison, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol using oligo(dT) 15 primers, 6 mM MgCl 2 , and 20 units of RNase inhibitor. Real-time RT-qPCR reactions were performed in a total volume of 20 µl, containing 5 µl sample cDNA, 10 µl 2 × Brilliant II SYBR ® Green qPCR Master Mix (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA), 15 pmol each of the forward and reverse primer (DNA Technology, Aarhus, Denmark), and combined with distilled water to the final volume. Non-template and non-enzyme controls were also included.
The primers used in these experiments were confirmed by gel electrophoresis with the sequence as following: GAPDH (NM_017008.4) forward: CATCAAGAAGGTGGTGAAGCA, reverse: CTGTTGAAGTCACAGGAGACA and TSPO (NM_012515) forward: GCTGCCCGCTTGCTGTATCCT and reverse CCCTCGCCGACCAGAGTTATCA (Lavisse et al. ).
PCR was performed on a Light Cycler 480 (Roche, Indianapolis, USA) with a 130 s preincubation at 95 °C followed by 45 cycles of 5 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 60 °C and 1 cycle of 1 s at 50 °C and 5 min at 40 °C. Each primer pair was validated by using serially diluted cDNA from a randomly selected RNA sample to establish a standard curve. Quantification of mRNA expression was performed according to the comparative CT method (Schmittgen and Livak ). For each sample, the amount of target mRNA was normalized to that of the reference gene GAPDH.
Statistical Processing
Differences between groups (autoradiography and RT-qPCR) were tested with an unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test, with significance levels of α = 0.05.
Results
In Vitro Autoradiography of [123I]CLINDE
In vitro autoradiography employing the TSPO selective radioligand [ 123 I]CLINDE showed that binding in brains of sham-operated and drug/surgery naive animals was very low and nearly uniform at all investigated time points. Higher binding in these control groups was observed in the rhinal fissure and rhinal incisura at the motor cortex level (Fig. 1 a). Sham and naïve animals showed slightly higher binding in subcortical structures, especially in thalamic and hypothalamic structures, the hippocampal fissure, the ventricular ependymal in the dorsal part and the posterior portion of the third ventricle and in the lateral ventricles (Fig. 2 a).
Non-specific binding, assessed with 10 µM PK11195, was uniform across all investigated groups, indicating high selectivity and signal-to-noise ratio of the radioligand.
Time-Dependent Increase in [123I]CLINDE Binding After Focal TBI
Binding at the Injury Site (Interaural 12.20 mm, Bregma 3.20 mm)
In TBI-injured animals, a distinct temporal and brain regional upregulation of TSPO binding was observed in the proximity of the injury as demonstrated in representative autoradiographs in Figs. 1 a and 3 a. Fig. 3 Focal Traumatic brain injury (TBI) increases binding of the translocator protein 18 kDa selective radioligand [ 123 I]CLINDE in vitro. a % radioligand binding (relative to corresponding binding of naïve animals) after sham operation ( n = 5), controlled cortical impact-induced traumatic brain injury ( n = 5) and craniotomy ( n = 3) at 6 , 24 , 72 h and 28 days post injury. A strong increase in radioligand binding is observed in the ipsilateral M1 motor cortex in TBI/Craniotomy animals compared to sham at 24 , 72 h and 28 days post-injury. [ 123 I]CLINDE binding is additionally increased in the contralateral cortex after TBI at 24 and 72 h post-injury. Data are mean ± SD. Significance tested with the Student’s t test. * P < 0.05; ** P < 0.01; *** P < 0.001. b % radioligand binding (relative to corresponding binding of naïve animals) after sham operation ( n = 5), Controlled Cortical Impact-induced traumatic brain injury ( n = 5) and craniotomy ( n = 3) at 6 , 24 , 72 h and 28 days post injury. A strong increase in radioligand binding is observed in the cortical areas [parietal association (PA) and primary somatosensory cortex (S1B), barrel field] in TBI/craniotomy animals compared to sham at 24 , 72 h and 28 days post injury. Hippocampus binding is elevated at 72 h post injury and thalamic structures show a delayed increase in binding at 28 days post injury. No differences are found in the contralateral hemisphere (data not shown). Data are mean ± SD. Significance tested with the Student’s t test. * P < 0.05; ** P < 0.01; *** P < 0.001
At 6 h post injury, no significant changes in [ 123 I]CLINDE binding in the cortex were observed. However, after 24 h, TBI-injured animals exhibited a twofold increase in radioligand binding compared to craniotomy and sham ( P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively). Craniotomy alone also caused a significantly higher binding as compared to sham ( P < 0.05; Fig. 3 a).
[ 123 I]CLINDE binding was maximally elevated at 72 h post surgery, in TBI animals as well as in craniotomized animals (as compared to the sham-operated group, P < 0.01). However, there was no significant difference in [ 123 I]CLINDE binding between TBI and craniotomy at this time point.
At 28 days post surgery, [ 123 I]CLINDE binding remained approximately twofold elevated in the TBI-injured and craniotomized animals, as compared to shams ( P < 0.001), but no differences were found between these two groups.
Crainotomized animals showed no changes in [ 123 I]CLINDE binding in the contralateral motor cortex. In contrast, all animals subjected to TBI exhibited a moderately increased [ 123 I]CLINDE binding in the contralateral motor cortex both at 24 and 72 h post surgery (Figs. 1 a, 3 a, P < 0.05).
Binding in Other Regions (Interaural 5.20 mm, Bregma −3.80 mm)
As illustrated in Figs. 2 a and 3 b, both TBI and craniotomized animals exhibited a distinct and time-dependent pattern of [ 123 I]CLINDE binding in brain regions that were not directly affected by the mechanical injury.
At 6 h post surgery, only minor changes in hippocampus, thalamus, parietal association cortex and barrel field of the primary somatosensory cortex were observed.
The parietal and somatosensory cortices showed a moderate but significant increase in [ 123 I]CLINDE binding at 24 h post surgery in the TBI-injured ( P < 0.01) and the craniotomy ( P < 0.01) group compared to sham, but not between each other.
The most pronounced increases in [ 123 I]CLINDE binding were found at 72 h post surgery. In the parietal cortex, TBI caused a nearly threefold increase in radioligand binding ( P < 0.001), similar to the twofold increase in craniotomized animals ( P < 0.001) compared to the sham group. This pattern was also observed in the somatosensory cortex in TBI-injured (+239 %, P < 0.001) and craniotomized animals (+155 %, P < 0.01). Additionally, the whole hippocampus of rats subjected to TBI showed a small but significantly elevated binding (+36 %, P < 0.01).
In contrast, no significant hippocampal alterations were found in the subacute phase at 28 days post surgery. Both parietal (+77 %, P < 0.001) and somatosensory (+87 %, P < 0.001) cortices showed elevated [ 123 I]CLINDE binding in animal subjected to TBI and craniotomy (+77 %, P < 0.05; +80 %, P < 0.01) after 28 days.
In the thalamus (primarily the ventral posteromedial thalamic nucleus), changes were only detected at 28 days post surgery and not at any other time point. The increase in radioligand binding was significantly different from sham-operated ( P < 0.01) and craniotomized rats ( P < 0.05). Across all time points, no significant differences were observed in the corresponding structures of the contralateral hemisphere (data not shown).
TSPO mRNA Levels Correspond to Increases of [123I]CLINDE Binding in the Motor Cortex at 72 h Post Injury
In extracts from the M1 motor cortex of animals subjected to TBI, an eightfold increase in TSPO mRNA was found at 72 h post injury when compared to sham ( P < 0.0001; Fig. 4 ). Fig. 4 Focal traumatic brain injury increases mRNA levels of the translocator protein 18 kDa in the contusion. Increased TSPO mRNA levels in M1 motor cortex extracts of animals subjected to controlled cortical impact-induced traumatic brain injury compared to sham-operated animals as detected by RT-qPCR. *** P < 0.0001.

OX-42 Immunopositive Cells are Concentrated in the Contusion of the Injured M1 Motor Cortex and Match the Distribution of [123I]CLINDE Binding at 72 h Post Injury
Immunostaining using the OX-42 (CD11b) antibody revealed a high number of OX-42 immunopositive cells in the contusion (Fig. 5 left image) at 72 h post surgery. The distribution of OX-42 immunoreactivity overlapped with the strongest increase in radioligand binding (Fig. 5 middle and right image). Fig. 5 Focal traumatic brain injury (TBI) increases OX-42/CD11b immunopositive cells in the vicinity of the contusion.

Discussion
This study investigated changes in TSPO expression after TBI, employing the selective radioligand [ 123 I]CLINDE. CLINDE is a second-generation TSPO ligand, with a high signal-to-noise ratio, low nanomolar affinity (Mattner et al. ) and absence of specific binding in TSPO knockout mice (Banati et al. ). The observed brain regional TSPO binding pattern was similar to that reported for other TSPO radioligands (Banati et al. ).
[ 123 I]CLINDE is of clinical relevance, as it has been used recently to image changes in TSPO in patients with cerebral stroke and glioblastoma, respectively (Feng et al. ; Jensen et al. , ). The low expression of TSPO in the healthy brain of man, rodents and non-human primates (Collste et al. ; Lavisse et al. ; Toth et al. ) and the robust upregulation in response to brain injury (Liu et al. ) allows a qualitative and quantitative assessment of neuroinflammation-associated changes. This study further supports the use of [ 123 I]CLINDE for detecting changes in TSPO binding after brain injury.
Glia cells are activated after TBI, leading to reactive astrocytic gliosis (Burda and Sofroniew ) and microglia activation (Norden et al. ) and both processes are implicated in the long-term neuropathology of the disease (reviewed in Faden et al. ). Modulation of the neuroinflammatory response after TBI is therefore regarded as an important treatment strategy. Because microglia exert both neuroprotective and neurotoxic functions, depending on their activation pattern and phenotype (Benarroch ), it must be emphasized that changes in TSPO binding represent a composite measure of both effects.
In the present study, a strong increase in [ 123 I]CLINDE binding was found 24 h post TBI at the site of the injury, peaking at 72 h and still significantly elevated in the subacute phase after 28 days. This temporal profile is similar to that reported in other TBI models (Raghavendra Rao et al. ; Yu et al. ; Cao et al. ). In addition, there is a remarkable match of in vitro binding and in vivo uptake of [ 18 F]DPA-714 after transient focal ischaemia, especially 1 month post injury (Martin et al. ), which lends support to the translatability of in vitro [ 123 I]CLINDE binding assay to in vivo imaging.
qPCR analysis revealed an increase in TSPO mRNA in a comparable magnitude, which further demonstrates target selectivity of [ 123 I]CLINDE and, importantly, also indicates that [ 123 I]CLINDE binding directly reflects corresponding changes in TSPO expression. qPCR allows a sensitive evaluation in very small quantity samples. Selective analysis of activated immune cells, e.g. by CD11b separation, could furthermore be used to determine microglia phenotype dynamics (Kumar et al. ). Depending on their phenotype, microglia can act as mediators of progressive tissue regeneration or chronic degeneration, and modulation of these processes provides potential treatment options. In contrast to qPCR, molecular imaging investigates changes in the targeted protein and offers translatability to the clinics e.g. through non-invasive PET/SPECT imaging of human subjects.
Craniotomy induced a less pronounced increase in [ 123 I]CLINDE binding in most of the ipsilateral brain structures, likely caused by perturbations to the dura mater and the surface of the cerebral cortex and therefore subsequently induces inflammatory changes. In agreement with our observation, others have reported that craniotomy induces brain injury, behavioural impairments and a profound inflammatory response (Cole et al. ; Lagraoui et al. ). It may thus be argued that craniotomy is not an appropriate control in open-skull models of TBI, as it may potentially mask specific effects of TBI per se and lead to an underestimation of therapeutic effects. Our findings clearly indicate that TBI promotes a more marked brain damage and consequently larger increase in [ 123 I]CLINDE binding. Furthermore, in contrast to TBI, craniotomy had no effect on [ 123 I]CLINDE binding in the ipsilateral thalamus 28 days post injury, hippocampus and in the contralateral cortex.
The delayed thalamic TSPO increase at 28 days post TBI points to a specific vulnerability (reviewed in Grossman and Inglese ), suggesting the thalamus as a target of secondary inflammation. This is frequently observed after TBI in animal models (Raghavendra Rao et al. ; Grossman et al. ; Kelso et al. ; Yu et al. ; Folkersma et al. ; Cao et al. ) and patients (Folkersma et al. ; Ramlackhansingh et al. ), where it correlates with persistent white matter damage (Scott et al. ). Similar changes are reported after stroke in rats (Myers et al. ) and humans (Pappata et al. ). This increase in regions distal from the cortical primary injury occurs long after the initial damage and in areas known to project directly to the site of damage, i.e. the ventrolateral thalamic nuclei and in contralateral brain areas, indicating that microglial activation could spread along damaged white matter tracts.
Similarly, contralateral cortical increases in TSPO radiotracer uptake were reported before (Yu et al. ). The underlying mechanisms for the TSPO increase in these regions are not clear, but it is tempting to speculate that activated microglia are also involved in compensatory restoration of neuronal function, which may occur at the contralateral hemisphere. In rodent models of stroke, microglia suppression leads to long-term decreases in neuronal plasticity markers, e.g. brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Madinier et al. ) and contralesional pyramidal tract plasticity was found to promote recovery (Liu et al. ; Herz et al. ). The detection of small, however, relevant changes in TSPO binding levels in areas presumed to be associated with neuroregeneration and synaptic plasticity requires highly sensitive TSPO tracer ligands, and our study therefore suggests that [ 123 I]CLINDE may be useful not only to detect detrimental consequences of CNS injury, but also to reveal possible regeneration potential long after the insult has taken place.
Our findings are in line with previous TBI studies where CCI injury in rats caused increased TSPO radioligand binding and mRNA levels at the contusion site (Raghavendra Rao et al. ; Venneti et al. ; Guseva et al. ; Kelso et al. ). After fluid percussion, [ 3 H]PK11195 binding was increased at day seven post injury in the somatosensory cortex and thalamus, while after 28 days only the thalamus retained the significant increase (Cao et al. ). Similar increases in TSPO are reported in other models of TBI (Miyazawa et al. ; Grossman et al. ; Soustiel et al. ).
In vivo [ 11 C]PK11195 and [ 18 F]DPA-714 uptake was increased after CCI in rats (Folkersma et al. ), peaking at day 6 and slowly decreasing until 28 days post injury (Wang et al. ). Lateral fluid percussion injury increased uptake of [ 18 F]FE-DAA1106 in the ipsi- and contralateral cortex, striatum and thalamus (Yu et al. ), followed by a delayed increase in tracer accumulation in the white matter at 9 weeks post injury, indicating axonal injury. Disruption of the blood–brain barrier with an immediate opening in the first hours and a delayed perturbation around 3 days (Baldwin et al. ; Baskaya et al. ) should be considered for in vivo studies. This could affect the radioligand uptake, as observed after ischaemia with increased tracer delivery ratios from day four on, indicating a higher uptake in the injured hemisphere (Martin et al. ).
The most interesting perspective is to what extend these tracers are useful in human patients of TBI and other pathological conditions triggering neuroinflammation. Increased [ 11 C]PK11195 binding potential was found in the thalamus of patients in different studies (Folkersma et al. ; Ramlackhansingh et al. ; Scott et al. ). PET imaging with [ 11 C]DPA-713 revealed overall higher distribution volumes in the thalamus and brainstem of retired football players, years after multiple concussions (Coughlin et al. ), demonstrating the applicability of TSPO tracers to investigate long-term inflammatory changes.
Dissecting the cellular origin of the TSPO upregulation proves difficult. Initially, resident microglia are activated in response to damage-associated molecular patterns, accompanied by de novo synthesis of TSPO and therefore accounting for the majority of TSPO upregulation. However, other cells also express TSPO, e.g. ED-1/CD68 positive macrophages (Lemstra et al. ), as previously found in our model (Härtig et al. ), reactive astrocytes (Raghavendra Rao et al. ; Venneti et al. ; Yu et al. ) and invading peripheral macrophages. In the present study, OX-42 staining was concentrated at the contusion site, showing phagocytic microglia/macrophages in the necrotic core, overlapping with the most pronounced radioligand binding, similar to previous reports (Yu et al. ). Because BBB opening after CCI is most pronounced in the first hours after injury, we believe that microglia and macrophages provide the largest fraction of TSPO upregulation, as shown by [ 123 I]CLINDE binding during day one and three post injury.
In conclusion, our data show that TSPO binding is markedly increased in response to TBI in the contusion and brain regions not directly affected by mechanical injury. An upregulation is found in the contralesional cortex and at 28 days in the ipsilateral thalamus. By employing two different control groups at all investigated time points, we demonstrate that craniotomy also increases [ 123 I]CLINDE binding in ipsilateral brain regions, which should be taken into account when employing open-head models of TBI. [ 123 I]CLINDE might therefore be a promising radioligand to visualize and quantify the neuroprotective and/or anti-inflammatory effects of treatments in preclinical models of TBI.
