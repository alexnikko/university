The aim of this study was to assess the influence of different water quality of Kausalyaganga pond of Bhubaneswar and Kalupada ghat, the northern sector of Chilika lagoon of Khordha district, Odisha on the haematological and morphometry of erythrocytes of Heteropneustes fossilis, Clarias batrachus, Channa punctatus, Channa striatus and Anabas testudineus. In both sampling sites, water physical-chemical-parameters of the water were measured. Our results showed statistical difference in pH, alkalinity, salinity and dissolved oxygen between the two sites. Haematological parameters like haemoglobin (Hb), red blood cell count (RBC), packed cell volume (PCV) and white blood cell count show a statistical significance in studied fishes of two different habitat except erythrocyte indices. The variations in haematological parameters are a good indicator to detect intra- and inter-specific variations in relation to different aquatic habitats. These results represent important haematological indices useful for monitoring the effect of environmental changes and physiological adaptive capacities of fishes.
