Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling, a mathematical modeling approach which uses a pharmacokinetic model to mimick human physiology to predict drug concentrationâ€“time profiles, has been used for the discover and development of drugs in various fields, including oncology, since 2000. There have been a few general review articles on the utilization of PBPK in the development of oncology drugs, but these do not include an evaluation of model prediction accuracy. We therefore conducted a systematic review to define the accuracy of PBPK model prediction and its utility throughout all the developmental phases of oncology drugs.
