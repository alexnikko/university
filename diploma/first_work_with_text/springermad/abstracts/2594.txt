Rodents cause large financial losses all over the world; in addition, these animals can also act as a reservoir and intermediate host or vector of diseases. Rodents have an important role in the distribution of diseases in an area. Sometimes, the distribution of a particular disease in an area depends on the distribution of rodents in that area. This study focuses on the distribution of rodent-related diseases in Iran. Rodent-borne and rodent-related diseases and diseases with suspected relationship with rodents have been reviewed in this study. Iran, due to the circumstances in which different species of rodents are able to live, has a high prevalence of certain diseases associated with rodents in urban and rural areas. Awareness about the distribution of rodent-related diseases can be a great help to rodentâ€™s control and prevention against the spread of the diseases.
