Although positron emission tomography PET–MR imaging is emerging into clinical practice, many aspects of this imaging technique such as attenuation correction have yet to be validated for myocardial imaging. Thus, it is uncertain whether PET–MR FDG images provide clinical information which is comparable to PET–CT FDG images. The study goal was to systematically compare relative myocardial FDG concentrations obtained from cardiac PET–MR images to those derived from same day PET–CT images.
