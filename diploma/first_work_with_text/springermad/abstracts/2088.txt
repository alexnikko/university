Aspirin and clopidogrel are both acceptable antiplatelet options for the secondary prevention of noncardioembolic ischemic stroke. Associations between Essen Stroke Risk Score (ESRS) and antiplatelet treatment in Chinese patients with noncardioembolic ischemic stroke were assessed. This retrospective study was taken in a tertiary care hospital located in eastern China. Patients with noncardioembolic ischemic stroke hospitalized during January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2011, were classified according to ESRS during index stroke hospitalization. Antiplatelet strategy at the time of discharge was categorized as aspirin (100 mg/day) vs. clopidogrel (75 mg/day). Patients received follow-up from July 1, 2014, to December 31, 2015, and the efficacy of clopidogrel and aspirin in different ESRS subgroups was assessed with respect to reducing the risk of a combined vascular event of recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction, or primary intracranial hemorrhage. Totally, 1175 non-cardiac stroke patients were included, among which 878 patients completed follow-up surveys. Of the patients who completed the follow-up, 458 (52.2%) had an ESRS > 3, and 621 (70.7%) received aspirin. Patients who received clopidogrel tended to be older, and more patients had hypertension, diabetes, and an ESRS > 3 than patients who received aspirin. Over a mean follow-up of 5.2 years, the rate of combined vascular events was 19.3% in the aspirin group and 16.7% in the clopidogrel group. Compared with clopidogrel-treated patients, a significant (P = 0.044) reduction in combined vascular events in aspirin-treated patients was observed in patients with an ESRS ≤ 3 (OR, odds ratio 0.5; 95% CI 0.3 to 0.9). However, a significant (P = 0.002) increase in combined vascular events was observed in patients with an ESRS > 3 (OR 2.2; 95% CI 1.3 to 3.8). More clopidogrel-treated patients with ESRS < 3 and ESRS = 3 discontinued treatment than their counterparts who took aspirin (P < 0.05). Adverse drug events, such as digestive discomfort and bleeding, were similar. In conclusion, clopidogrel is suggested for patients with an ESRS > 3 and aspirin for patients with an ESRS ≤ 3 for the secondary prevention of noncardioembolic ischemic stroke in Chinese patients.
