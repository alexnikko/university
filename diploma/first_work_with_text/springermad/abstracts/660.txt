Previous studies suggest that the pathophysiology of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is characterized not only by high ventricular stiffness, but also by vascular stiffness. Azilsartan has higher vascular affinity compared with other angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), which were proven to have no beneficial effects on clinical outcomes in patients with HFpEF in earlier clinical trials. We aimed to test the hypothesis that azilsartan may improve left ventricular diastolic function in HFpEF patients with hypertension in this trial.
