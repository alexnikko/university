It has been >25 years since the first report of the takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TC). Although left ventriculography was originally used to depict its typical and impressive wall motion abnormality mimicking “takotsubo”, or octopus pot, echocardiography plays a pivotal role in detecting not only its left ventricular (LV) wall motion abnormality, apical ballooning, but also various other findings. First of all, apical ballooning is not an essential finding for TC anymore. Mid-ventricular LV asynergy with or without apical involvement is a basic pattern of the LV wall motion abnormality. Distribution and time course of the asynergy may be best detected by echocardiography and echo provides useful information to differentiate between TC and acute coronary syndrome or acute myocarditis. In addition to the wall motion assessment, echo detects complications of TC such as systolic anterior motion of the mitral leaflet with or without LV outflow obstruction, mitral regurgitation, LV thrombus, right ventricular (RV) involvement. In particular, RV involvement is not an uncommon finding and is associated with worse short-term as well as long-term prognosis. Finally, coronary flow measurements and speckle tracking by echo may offer additional and useful information about pathophysiology and prognosis of TC. In conclusion, echocardiography is a standard imaging modality for detecting various dynamic findings beyond apical ballooning in patients with TC.
