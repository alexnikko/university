Although lymphadenectomy is currently accepted as most accurate and reliable staging procedure for lymph node metastases, its therapeutic benefit in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) still remains controversial. Although the new, targeted therapy paradigms have changed the treatment of patients with advanced RCC and offer prolonged survival, cure is extremely uncommon in the absence of surgical resections. In this paper, the current role of metastasectomy is reviewed. Review the available literature concerning the role of retroperitoneal lymph node dissection and metastasectomy in outcome of oligometastatic RCC. A PubMed search was conducted to identify original articles, review articles, and editorials addressing the role of retroperitoneal lymph node dissection and metastasectomy in outcome of oligometastatic RCC. Keywords included renal tumors, renal cell cancer, kidney cancer, lymphadenectomy, metastasectomy, and oligometastases. While there is no randomized study available, recent large observational studies have better defined the prognosis of patients with metastatic RCC with or without metastasectomy and RPLND. To date, the available evidence suggests that RPLND and metastasectomy may be beneficial when technically feasible in patients with locally advanced (unfavorable clinical and pathologic characteristics) and oligometastatic disease. A proportion of patients will achieve long-term survival with aggressive surgical resection.
