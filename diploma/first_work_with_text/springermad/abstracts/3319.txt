This study investigated vildagliptin-induced vasodilation and its related mechanisms using phenylephrine induced precontracted rabbit aortic rings. Vildagliptin induced vasodilation in a concentration-dependent manner. Pretreatment with the large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel blocker paxilline, ATP-sensitive K+ channel blocker glibenclamide, and inwardly rectifying K+ channel blocker Ba2+ did not affect the vasodilatory effects of vildagliptin. However, application of the voltage-dependent K+ (Kv) channel inhibitor 4-aminopyridine significantly reduced the vasodilatory effects of vildagliptin. In addition, application of either of two sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) inhibitors, thapsigargin or cyclopiazonic acid, effectively inhibited the vasodilatory effects of vildagliptin. These vasodilatory effects were not affected by pretreatment with adenylyl cyclase, protein kinase A (PKA), guanylyl cyclase, or protein kinase G (PKG) inhibitors, or by removal of the endothelium. From these results, we concluded that vildagliptin induced vasodilation via activation of Kv channels and the SERCA pump. However, other K+ channels, PKA/PKG-related signaling cascades associated with vascular dilation, and the endothelium were not involved in vildagliptin-induced vasodilation.
