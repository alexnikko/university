The currently held mechanistic understanding of microsomal cytochrome P450s (CYPs) seeks that diverse drug molecules bind within the deep-seated distal heme pocket and subsequently react at the heme centre. To explain a bevy of experimental observations and meta-analyses, we indulge a hypothesis that involves a “diffusible radical mediated” mechanism. This new hypothesis posits that many substrates could also bind at alternate loci on/within the enzyme and be reacted without the pertinent moiety accessing a bonding proximity to the purported catalytic Fe-O enzyme intermediate.
