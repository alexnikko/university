A literature review on 1,104,269 cancer patients concluded that the prevalence of multiple primary malignancies is between 0.73 and 11.7%. The lifetime risk of developing another de novo primary after being detected with cancer is high. We report synchronous and metachronous double malignancy cases presenting in Radiotherapy Department in the Gynecology Oncology subspeciality in our hospital.
