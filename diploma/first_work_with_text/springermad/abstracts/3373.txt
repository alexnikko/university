Apigenin (AP) is a flavone in dietary flavonoids reported as strong antioxidant and elite modulator of PPARγ. The current study evaluated the consequence of AP in isoproterenol (ISO)-induced oxidative stress and myocardial infarction during β-adrenergic receptor stimulus in rats by persistent hemodynamic, biochemical and histopathological changes. Rats received AP (25, 50 and 75 mg/kg/day) or vehicle i.p. for 14 days and ISO (100 mg/kg, s.c.) on 13th and 14th days for initiation of cardiotoxicity. ISO-treated rats showed evidence of significant dwindle in systolic and diastolic arterial pressures, maximal positive rate of developed left ventricular pressure. In totting up, a noteworthy diminution in activities of creatine kinase-MB isoenzyme, reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase, catalase and level along with rise in malondialdehyde content were observed. The shielding function of AP on isoproterenol-induced myocardial damage was observed by attenuating all the endogenous parameters and the membrane-bound enzymes. It was confirmed by histopathological examinations. The effect of AP at the doses of 50 and 75 mg/kg showed added apparent than at the dose of 25 mg/kg. Current study thus provides confirmation for protective effects of AP on myocardium in experimentally induced myocardial infarction.
