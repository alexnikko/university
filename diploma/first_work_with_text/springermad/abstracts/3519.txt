Blood or marrow transplant (BMT) is a potentially curative treatment for numerous cancers and non-malignant disorders. BMT is a resource-intense treatment process, requiring patients to comprehend difficult health information and navigate a complex healthcare system. Linguistic and cultural barriers create additional challenges for patients with limited English proficiency (LEP) who may need translated information and interpretive services to make an informed decision about treatment. To identify information needs and gaps in language services for BMT patients with LEP, the National Marrow Donor Program® (NMDP)/Be The Match® administered a cross-sectional, web-based survey to 139 transplant centers (TCs) across the United States (U.S.). The survey yielded a 59% response rate. Findings show a significant need for translated patient education materials, especially in Spanish, Chinese, and Arabic, and practice gaps in the use of appropriate interpreters. Nearly one third of respondents indicated using family and friends to interpret for patients. The inability to locate educational resources in a specific language, lack of available bilingual staff, lack of a formal, centralized tracking system, and outdated tracking systems also pose significant barriers to meeting the language needs of BMT patients with LEP.
