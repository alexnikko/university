This review summarizes key imaging studies that were presented in the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions 2017 related to the fields of nuclear cardiology, cardiac computed tomography, cardiac magnetic resonance, and echocardiography. The aim of this birdâ€™s eye view is to inform readers about multiple studies reported at the meeting from these different imaging modalities. While such a review is most useful for those that did not attend the conference, we find that a general overview may also be useful to those that did since it is often difficult to get exposure to many abstracts at large meetings. The review, therefore, aims to help readers stay updated on the newest imaging studies presented at the meeting and will hopefully stimulate new ideas for future research in imaging.
