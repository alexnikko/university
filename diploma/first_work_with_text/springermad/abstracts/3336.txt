Ellagic acid (EA) is a phenolic constituent in certain fruits and nuts with wide range of biological activities, including potent antioxidant, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, anticancer and antimutagen properties. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of EA on sodium arsenic (SA)-induced cardio- and hematotoxicity in rats. Animals were divided into five groups. The first group was used as control. Group 2 was orally treated with sodium arsenite (SA, 10 mg/kg) for 21 days. Group 3 was orally treated with EA (30 mg/kg) for 14 days. Groups 4 and 5 were orally treated with SA for 7 days prior to EA (10 and 30 mg/kg, respectively) treatment and continued up to 21 days simultaneous with SA administration. Various biochemical, histological and molecular biomarkers were assessed in blood and heart. The results indicate that SA-intoxicated rats display significantly higher levels of plasma cardiac markers (AST, CK-MB, LDH and cTnI) than normal control animals. Moreover, an increase in MDA and NO with depletion of GSH and activities of CAT, SOD and GPx occurred in the heart of rats treated with SA. Furthermore, SA-treated rats showed significantly lower WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT and PLT and significantly higher MCV and MCH. Administration of EA (30 mg/kg) resulted in a significant reversal of hematological and cardiac markers in arsenic-intoxicated rats. These biochemical disturbances were supported by histopathological observations of the heart. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that EA treatment exerts a significant protective effect on SA-induced cardio- and hematotoxicity.
