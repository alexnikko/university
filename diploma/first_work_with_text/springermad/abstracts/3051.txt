Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) is conventionally regarded as an inflammatory cytokine that has a pivotal role in anti-infection and tumor immune surveillance. It has been used clinically to treat a variety of malignancies. However, increased evidence has suggested IFN-γ can act to induce tumor progression. The role of IFN-γ in regulating antitumor immunity appears to be complex and paradoxical. The mechanism underlying the dual aspects of IFN-γ function in antitumor immunity is not clear.
