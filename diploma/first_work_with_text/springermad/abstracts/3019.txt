In Japan, the National Cancer Center and university hospitals have initiated next-generation sequencing-based in vitro diagnostic testing for cancer patients as a method of clinical sequencing. Based on the molecular alterations detected, physicians can provide approved targeted therapy and access to investigational drugs for cancer patients. However, interpretation of the clinical significance of genomic alterations remains the most severe bottleneck of precision medicine in cancer. Although many research institutes in the United States are developing knowledge bases for interpretation of the tumor alterations and clinical decisions, these knowledge bases are unsuited as sources of reference in Japan due to differences in the information on approved drugs and implementation of clinical trials. In this review, we introduce knowledge bases for clinical decision-making based on genomic events in cancer, and discuss the resources of additional information necessary for implementing precision medicine in Japan.
