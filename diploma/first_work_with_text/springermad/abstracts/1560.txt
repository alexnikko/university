Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting up to one third of individuals reaching the age of 80. Different integrated responses exist in the brain to detect oxidative stress which is controlled by several genes termed Vitagenes. Vitagenes encode for cytoprotective heat shock proteins (Hsp), as well as thioredoxin, sirtuins and uncouple proteins (UCPs). In the present study we evaluate stress response mechanisms in plasma and lymphocytes of AD patients, as compared to controls, in order to provide evidence of an imbalance of oxidant/antioxidant mechanisms and oxidative damage in AD patients and the possible protective role of vitagenes.
