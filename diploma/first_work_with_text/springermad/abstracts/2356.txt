Energy storing and return (ESAR) feet are generally preferred over solid ankle cushioned heel (SACH) feet by people with a lower limb amputation. While ESAR feet have been shown to have only limited effect on gait economy, other functional benefits should account for this preference. A simple biomechanical model suggests that enhanced gait stability and gait symmetry could prove to explain part of the difference in the subjective preference between both feet.
