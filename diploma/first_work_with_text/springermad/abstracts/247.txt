The exposure to air pollutants may increase both incidence and mortality of stroke. We aimed to investigate the association of short- and medium-term exposure to particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) with the outcome of intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) for stroke. We conducted a retrospective analysis based on data prospectively collected from 944 consecutive IVT-treated stroke patients. The main outcome measure was 3-month mortality. The secondary outcome measures were causes of neurological deterioration (≥ 1 NIHSS point from baseline or death < 7 days), including intracerebral hemorrhage, cerebral edema (CED), and persistence or new appearance of hyperdense cerebral artery sign. In the adjusted model, higher PM2.5 and PM10 values in the last 3 days and 4 weeks before stroke were independently associated with higher mortality rate [hazard ratio (HR) 1.014, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.005–1.024, p = 0.003; HR 1.079, 95% CI 1.055–1.103, p = 0.001; HR 1.019, 95% CI 1.005–1.032, p = 0.008; and HR 1.015, 95% CI 1.004–1.027, p = 0.007; respectively]. Higher PM2.5 and PM10 values in the last 4 weeks were associated with higher CED rate [odd ratio (OR) 1.023, 95% CI 1.007–1.040, p = 0.006; and OR 1.017, 95% CI 1.003–1.032, p = 0.021; respectively]. No significant association between PM or NO2 and other causes of neurological deterioration was observed. Higher exposure to PM in the last 3 days and 4 weeks before stroke may be independently associated with 3-month mortality after IVT. Higher exposure to PM in the last 4 weeks before stroke may also be independently associated with CED after IVT.
