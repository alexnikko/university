The aim of this study was to evaluate the comparative changes of selected acute-phase proteins (APPs), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities in buffalos and cows with subclinical mastitis. For this purpose, a total of 139 buffalos (Bubalus bubalis) and 146 cows (Holstein or Friesian) from Dakahlia governorate in Egypt were studied. Seventy-six cows and 49 buffalos exhibited subclinical mastitis with positive California mastitis test (CMT) and no clinical signs of mastitis. Results revealed that the most dominant isolated bacteria were Staphylococcus spp. in both buffalo and cow fellowed by Streptococcus spp. and E.coli. Statistical significant differences were observed in SCC, HP level, and LDH activity between buffalos with different bacterial isolates. Milk HP level showed significant differences (P < 0.05) between clinically health buffalos and cows and those infected with different isolated pathogen. In conclusion, similar to cows, Hp is a sensitive marker of subclinical mastitis in buffalo, and they may be advantageous to clarify the host response to the inflammation of mammary gland in clinical research. However, additional studies on a wider range of APPs and specific pathogens in buffalos are required to explore the response pattern to mastitis in such species.
