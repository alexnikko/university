Hypertension and dyslipidemia are major risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). In 2012, over 270 million patients (25.2%) in China were hypertensive and 40.4% was dyslipidemic. The majority of these patients rely on statins for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. However, certain types of statins (e.g., atorvastatin), compared to others (e.g., pitavastatin), may be associated with unfavorable effects on glucose metabolism. This leads to concerns when prescribing statins to patients who also have a predisposition to glucose metabolic disorders (i.e., prediabetes). Thus, this study aims to investigate the effect of pitavastatin, compared to atorvastatin, on glucose metabolism, as measured by hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), in Chinese prediabetics with hypertension and dyslipidemias.
