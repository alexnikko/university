The selection of anesthetics for patients with myocardial infarction is critically challenging. Sevoflurane is a volatile anesthetic gradually used in recent years. The intraoperative hemodynamic stability of sevoflurane was supported by several studies with some suggestions for its use for patients with cardiac events. The present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of sevoflurane on mice with myocardial infarction to evaluate the safety issue of this agent for possible application in patients with myocardial infarction. Mice of 7–12 weeks old were subjected to left anterior descending artery ligation to introduce acute myocardial infarction. The effect of sevoflurane on the hemodynamics was examined in comparison with that of currently available agent etomidate at low and moderate doses. The results showed that sevoflurane caused unstable hemodynamic changes in mice with myocardial infarction at both low and moderate inhaled concentrations relative to low and moderate doses of etomidate. In addition, the relative safety margin estimated from therapeutic index was decreased by 50 % when sevoflurane was used for mice with myocardial infarction relative to control mice, but only decreased by 20 % for etomidate. These analyses indicate that in comparison with currently available agent etomidate, sevoflurane should not be applied to patients with myocardial infarction or other cardiac events.
