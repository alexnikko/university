Diabetic retinopathy is a metabolic disease and oxidative stress-associated diabetic disorder. The antioxidant plants are important in the treatment of diabetic mellitus. The main purpose of this study was to determine the effect of Amygdalus scoparia on anti-diabetic and antioxidant activity in the photoreceptor layer of diabetic retina. Thirty rats were housed and divided into three groups of 10 rats each. Group I: control group; group II: Diabetic group (induced by IP injection of 50 mg/kg of stereptozotocin); group III: diabetic receiving 200 mg/kg A. scoparia extract 1 month before and 2 months after diabetic-induced. At the end of experiment, the eyes were removed and fixed in glutaraldehyde. Then, the routine preparation of tissue in transmission electron microscope was done. The semi-thin and ultrathin sections were stained with toluidine blue, uranyl acetate, and lead citrate, respectively. Then, all sections were evaluated by light and transmission electron microscopes. Result showed that the major signs of pathology such as outer segment loss, large vacuoles, and disorganization in inner segment, pyknotic, karyolysis, and karyorrhexis were seen in diabetic group. But, the minor signs of pathology such as small vacuole and pyknotic nuclei were obvious in amygdulus scoparia treatment group. Our findings revealed reduction of the damage in A. scoparia group which might have antioxidant activity and caused blood glucose to be reduced in diabetic group.
