Poikiloderma with neutropenia (PN) is a genodermatosis currently described in 77 patients, all presenting with early-onset poikiloderma, neutropenia, and several additional signs. Biallelic loss-of-function mutations in USB1 gene are detected in all molecularly tested patients but genotype-phenotype correlation remains elusive. Cancer predisposition is recognized among PN features and pathogenic variants found in patients who developed early in life myelodysplasia (n = 12), acute myeloid leukemia (n = 2), and squamous cell carcinoma (n = 2) should be kept into account in management and follow-up of novel patients. This will hopefully allow achieving data clustered on specific mutations relevant to oncological surveillance of the carrier patients.
