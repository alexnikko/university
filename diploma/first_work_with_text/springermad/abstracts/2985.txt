Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 and programmed cell death-1 receptors have transformed the treatment of melanoma and other cancers. These therapies are associated with a number of side effects, including immune-related adverse events. Sarcoidosis-like granulomas (SLGs) are important immune checkpoint inhibitor-related reactions to recognize as SLGs can mimic disease progression and accordingly impact treatment decisions. We systematically review reports of immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced SLGs in cancer patients and discuss potential underlying pathophysiological mechanisms.
