Despite increasing rates of cancer, biospecimen donations for cancer research remains low among Pacific Islanders (PIs). To address this disparity, researchers partnered with PI community organizations to develop and test a theory-based culturally tailored educational intervention designed to raise awareness about the issues surrounding biospecimen research. A total of 219 self-identified PI adults in Southern California were recruited to participate in a one-group pre-post design study. Participants completed questionnaires that assessed their knowledge and attitude regarding biospecimen research before and after viewing an educational video and receiving print materials. Results showed that participants’ overall knowledge and attitude increased significantly from pre-test to post-test (p < .0001). Over 98% of participants also reported that they would be willing to donate at least one type of biospecimen sample. Efforts such as these that utilize culturally tailored education interventions may be instrumental in improving biospecimen donation rates in the PI community as well as other minority populations.
