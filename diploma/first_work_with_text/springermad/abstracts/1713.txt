Non-invasive stimulation of the cerebellum is growingly applied both in the clinic and in research settings to modulate the activities of cerebello-cerebral loops. The anatomical location of the cerebellum, the high responsiveness of the cerebellar cortex to magnetic/electrical stimuli, and the implication of the cerebellum in numerous cerebello-cerebral networks make the cerebellum an ideal target for investigations and therapeutic purposes. In this mini-review, we discuss the potentials of cerebellar neuromodulation in major brain disorders in order to encourage large-scale sham-controlled research and explore this therapeutic aid further.
