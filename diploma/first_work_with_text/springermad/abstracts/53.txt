Obesity is a worldwide public health epidemic that leads to increased morbidity, mortality, and cost burden to health care. Although bariatric surgery has been recognized as a standard invasive treatment for obesity, it is accompanied by relatively high morbidity and cost burden, as well as limited treatment outcome. Therefore, alternative treatments with lower morbidity and cost for surgery that target patients who are obese, but not morbidly obese, are needed. A minimally invasive trans-catheter procedure, named bariatric arterial embolization or bariatric embolization (BAE), has been identified as a potential solution, based on its safety and preliminary efficacy profiles. The purpose of this review is to introduce up-to-date clinical data and discuss future directions for BAE for the treatment of obesity.
