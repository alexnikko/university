Astroglial cells are important actors in the defense of brain against oxidative stress injuries. Glial cells synthesize and release the octadecaneuropeptide ODN, a diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI)-related peptide, which acts through its metabotropic receptor to protect neurons and astrocytes from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. The purpose of the present study is to examine the contribution of the endogenous ODN in the protection of astrocytes and neurons from moderate oxidative stress. The administration of H2O2 (50 μM, 6 h) induced a moderate oxidative stress in cultured astrocytes, i.e., an increase in reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde, and carbonyl group levels, but it had no effect on astrocyte death. Mass spectrometry and QPCR analysis revealed that 50 μM H2O2 increased ODN release and DBI mRNA levels. The inhibition of ODN release or pharmacological blockage of the effects of ODN revealed that in these conditions, 50 μM H2O2 induced the death of astrocytes. The transfection of astrocytes with DBI siRNA increased the vulnerability of cells to moderate stress. Finally, the addition of 1 nM ODN to culture media reversed cell death observed in DBI-deficient astrocytes. The treatment of neurons with media from 50 μM H2O2-stressed astrocytes significantly reduced the neuronal death induced by H2O2; this effect is greatly attenuated by the administration of an ODN metabotropic receptor antagonist. Overall, these results indicate that astrocytes produce authentic ODN, notably in a moderate oxidative stress situation, and this glio- and neuro-protective agent may form part of the brain defense mechanisms against oxidative stress injury.
