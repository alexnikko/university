Fanhdi/Alphanate is a plasma derived factor VIII concentrate used for treating hemophilia A, for which there has not been any dedicated model describing its pharmacokinetics (PK). A population PK model was developed using data extracted from the Web-Accessible Population Pharmacokinetic Service-Hemophilia (WAPPS-Hemo) project. WAPPS-Hemo provided individual PK profiles for hemophilia patients using sparse observations as provided in routine clinical care by hemophilia centers. Plasma factor activity measurements and covariate data from hemophilia A patients on Fanhdi/Alphanate were extracted from the WAPPS-Hemo database. A population PK model was developed using NONMEM and evaluated for suitability for Bayesian forecasting using prediction-corrected visual predictive check (pcVPC), cross validation, limited sampling analysis and external evaluation against a population PK model developed on rich sampling data. Plasma factor activity measurements from 92 patients from 12 centers were used to derive the model. The PK was best described by a 2-compartment model including between subject variability on clearance and central volume, fat free mass as a covariate on clearance, central and peripheral volumes, and age as covariate on clearance. Evaluations showed that the developed population PK model could predict the PK parameters of new individuals based on limited sampling analysis and cross and external evaluations with acceptable precision and bias. This study shows the feasibility of using real-world data for the development of a population PK model. Evaluation and comparison of the model for Bayesian forecasting resulted in similar results as a model developed using rich sampling data.
