Impaired cardiomyocyte contractility and calcium handling are hallmarks of left ventricular contractile dysfunction. Exercise training has been used as a remarkable strategy in the treatment of heart disease. The microRNA-1, which targets sodium/calcium exchanger 1 (NCX), and microRNA-214, which targets sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase-2a (Serca2a), are involved in cardiac function regulation. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of exercise training on cardiac microRNA-1 and âˆ’214 expression after myocardial infarction.
