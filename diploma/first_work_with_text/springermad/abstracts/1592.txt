Activation-induced induction of transcription factor NFκB in T lymphocytes is regulated by its inhibitor IκBα. NFκB activation has been demonstrated to occur either by phosphorylation on serine residues 32 and 36 of the inhibitor, IκBα, followed by ubiquitination and degradation of the inhibitor by the 26S proteasome, or by a proteasome-independent mechanism involving tyrosine phosphorylation, but not degradation. However, the mechanism underlying constitutive regulation of the levels of the inhibitor, IκB, in primary human T lymphocytes, remains to be fully delineated.
