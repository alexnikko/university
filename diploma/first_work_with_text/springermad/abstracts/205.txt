Internal jugular vein (IJV) stenosis and cerebral venous sinus (CVS) stenosis belong to cerebral venous outflow insufficiency. This study aimed to analyze the similarities and differences between IJV stenosis and CVS stenosis. Patients with either IJV stenosis or CVS stenosis confirmed by contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance venography between October 2017 and July 2018 were enrolled in this retrospective study. The similarities and differences between IJV stenosis and CVS stenosis on the aspects of clinical and imaging features were compared. A total of 82 eligible patients entered into the final analysis. The similarities of the two subsets of cerebral venous outflow insufficiency mainly included headache, head noises or tinnitus, visual disorders, and sleeping disorders, as well as cloud-like white matter hyperintensity in T2WI and FLAIR sequences of MRI. However, there were differences in between, the ratio of patients with higher intracranial pressure (ICP) was common in CVS stenosis (p < 0.001). Namely, higher ratios of papilledema (p = 0.001) and visual damage (p = 0.029), as well as poor Frisen papilledema grade scores were more commonly observed in CVS stenosis (p = 0.004), while abnormal collateral-vessels appeared more frequently in IJV stenosis (100.00%) than CVS stenosis (28.57%). Continuous head noises, tinnitus and cloud-like white matter hyperintensity in MRI are the features of both IJV stenosis and CVS stenosis. Whereas, severe headache, visual damage, papilledema, and intracranial hypertension (IH) were more common in CVS stenosis, and the appearance of collateral-vessels is a key feature of IJV stenosis.
