The infiltrating margins of carcinomas are associated with the presence of inflammatory cell infiltrate which are an integral part of the tumor microenvironment. Among the inflammatory cells, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play a key role in the tumorigenesis. This study elucidates the density of TAMs in invasive mammary carcinomas and attempts to establish an association with the following pathological variables: tumor size, histological grade, nodal status, hormonal expression status and Her2Neu overexpression.
