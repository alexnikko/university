The intact nephron hypothesis (INH) states that impaired renal function results from a reduction in the number of complete (intact) nephrons. Under this model, renal drug clearance is assumed to be a linear function of glomerular filtration while tubular handling is ignored. The aims of this study were to systematically review published studies designed to test the INH and to assess the strength of the study designs used.
