5-Chloro-3-[phenylsulfonyl] indole-2-carboxamide (CSIC) is a highly potent non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) of HIV-1 which has been shown to have a more desirable resistance profile than other NNRTIs in the development as HIV prevention strategies. This work involves generation of preformulation data for CSIC and systematic development of a cosolvent system to effectively solubilize this hydrophobic drug candidate. This system was then applied to produce a polymeric thin film solid dosage form for vaginal administration of CSIC for use in prevention of sexual acquisition of HIV.
