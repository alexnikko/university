Resveratrol (RESV) and Environmental Enrichment (EE) have been separately reported to protect organisms against various diseases. This study investigated the potential benefit of the combination of RESV and EE on biomarkers of oxidative stress in young healthy mice. Fifty mice of both sexes were randomly divided into five groups of 10 animals each: group I served as control, group II were maintained on alternate day feeding, group III received RESV 50 mg/kg, suspended in caboxymethylcellulose orally per kg/day. Group IV received CMC and kept in an Enriched Environment, group V received RESV + EE. The treatment lasted for 28 days. The animals were sacrificed 24 h after the last treatment and brain samples were collected for biochemical evaluation. The results obtained showed a significant decrease (P < 0.05) in malondialdehyde concentration in EE group and RESV treated group kept EE when compared to the control. A significant decrease was also observed in glutathione peroxidase activity in all the treatment groups when compared to the control. A significant decrease in GPx activities in RESV, EE and RESV + EE treated groups in male and female mice when compared to the control groups respectively. However, a significant increase in GPx activities was observed in EE group in male mice and EODF, RESV groups in female mice when compared to RESV + EE groups respectively. In conclusion, the result of our study indicates that EE possesses antioxidant properties by decreasing MDA concentration and attenuating lipid peroxidation in the brain of young Swiss albino mice.
