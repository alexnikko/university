Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension is a prominent and disabling manifestation of autonomic dysfunction in patients with hereditary transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis affecting an estimated 40â€“60% of patients, and reducing their quality of life. We reviewed the epidemiology and pathophysiology of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension in patients with hereditary TTR amyloidosis, summarize non-pharmacologic and pharmacological treatment strategies and discuss the impact of novel disease-modifying treatments such as transthyretin stabilizers (diflunisal, tafamidis) and RNA interference agents (patisiran, inotersen).
