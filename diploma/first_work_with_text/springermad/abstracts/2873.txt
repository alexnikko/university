The National Mastitis Council was founded in 1961 based on the desire of a forward-thinking group of individuals to bring together “all forces of organized agriculture in the United States to combat, through every practical device, the mastitis threat to the Nation’s health and food safety”. What started as a small organization focused on mastitis of dairy cattle in the United States has grown into a global organization for mastitis and milk quality. Over the last 50-plus years the concerted efforts of the membership have led to the synthesis and dissemination of a considerable body of knowledge regarding udder health, milk quality, and food safety which has improved dairy cattle health and well-being and farm productivity.
