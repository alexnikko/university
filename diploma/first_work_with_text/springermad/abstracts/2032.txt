Ischemic stroke is a devastating neurological disease that can cause permanent brain damage, but to date, few biomarkers are available to reliably assess the severity of injury during acute onset. In this study, quantitative proteomic analysis of ischemic mouse brain detected the increase in expression levels of clusterin (CLU) and cystatin C (CST3). Since CLU is a secretary protein, serum samples (n = 70) were obtained from acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients within 24 h of stroke onset and together with 70 matched health controls. Analysis of CLU levels indicated significantly higher levels in AIS patients than healthy controls (14.91 ± 4.03 vs. 12.79 ± 2.22 ng/L; P = 0.0004). Analysis of serum CST3 also showed significant increase in AIS patients as compared with healthy controls (0.90 ± 0.19 vs. 0.84 ± 0.12 ng/L; P = 0.0064). The serum values of CLU were also positively correlated with the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores, the time interval after stroke onset, as well as major stroke risk factors associated with lipid profile. These data demonstrate that elevated levels of serum CLU and CST3 are independently associated with AIS and may serve as peripheral biomarkers to aid clinical assessment of AIS and its severity. This pilot study thus contributes to progress toward preclinical proteomic screening by using animal models and allows translation of results from bench to bedside.
