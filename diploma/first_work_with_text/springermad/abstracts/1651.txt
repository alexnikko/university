Accumulating data have revealed that abnormal activity of the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway plays an important role in epileptogenesis triggered by various factors. We previously reported that pretreatment with perifosine, an inhibitor of Akt (also called protein kinase B), abolishes the rapamycin-induced paradoxical increase of S6 phosphorylation in a rat model induced by kainic acid (KA). Since Akt is an upstream target in the mTOR signaling pathway, we set out to determine whether perifosine has a preventive effect on epileptogenesis. Here, we explored the effect of perifosine on the model of temporal epilepsy induced by KA in rats and found that pretreatment with perifosine had no effect on the severity or duration of the KA-induced status epilepticus. However, perifosine almost completely inhibited the activation of p-Akt and p-S6 both acutely and chronically following the KA-induced status epilepticus. Perifosine pretreatment suppressed the KA-induced neuronal death and mossy fiber sprouting. The frequency of spontaneous seizures was markedly decreased in rats pretreated with perifosine. Accordingly, rats pretreated with perifosine showed mild impairment in cognitive functions. Collectively, this study provides novel evidence in a KA seizure model that perifosine may be a potential drug for use in anti-epileptogenic therapy.
