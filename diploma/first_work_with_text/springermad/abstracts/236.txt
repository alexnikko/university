While patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and low platelet counts are at risk for bleeding, they are not protected against arterial and venous thrombotic events. Frequently, hematologists are asked to consult on a patient with ITP requiring an antiplatelet (AP) agent or anticoagulant (AC). No direct evidence exists to guide hematologists in weighing the risk of thrombosis against the risk of bleeding in patients with ITP. Therefore, we performed a survey to determine the preferred management of AP/AC therapy in ITP patients. The survey described hypothetical patient scenarios and asked respondents to recommend a minimum platelet count for initiation of AP/AC therapy. We surveyed both hematologists with an international reputation in treatment of ITP (n = 48) and also general hematologist–oncologists in Oklahoma (n = 97). Response rates were 38/48 (79%) for the ITP specialists and 46/97 (47%) for general hematologist–oncologists. Overall, recommended platelet thresholds for antithrombotic therapy were similar between ITP specialists and general hematologist–oncologists. Although both groups recommended a minimum platelet count of 50 × 109/L for AP and AC therapy in most scenarios, there was great variability in individual practice patterns among respondents. This study highlights the need for studies of patients with ITP who require AP/AC therapy to provide high-quality evidence for establishing optimal management strategies.
