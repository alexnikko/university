Untreated, traumatic, or wound myiases can cause severe consequences to animal health and welfare as well as economic losses to livestock productions. For healing myiasis-caused wounds, disinfectant such as creolin is wrongly but currently used in association with insecticides. Though effective, creolin is highly toxic to the patients, is inadequate with respect to the repellent effect, and may delay the healing of treated wounds. In this uncontrolled study, the efficacy of the patented plant-derived formulation 1 Primary Wound Dressing© (1-PWD), composed of neem oil (Azadirachta indica A. Juss.) and the oily extract of Hypericum perforatum (L.) flowers, has been investigated. Forty-four domestic animals of different species suffering from wound myiasis lasting for up to 25 days, at different parts of the body, were enrolled in the study. No systemic or local antibiotic or disinfectants’ treatment was administered. Larvae recovered on open wounds and adults reared from mature larvae were identified as Wohlfahrtia magnifica. All the treated wounds healed in a range of 10 to 32 days without further infestation. None of the recruited animals presented bacterial complications. Data herein presented indicate that the tested natural plant-derived formulation is able to manage the infestation caused by W. magnifica larvae and the healing process of traumatic infested wounds in several domestic animal species, without any side effect on the living tissue and without the need to use local or systemic chemical or other products.
