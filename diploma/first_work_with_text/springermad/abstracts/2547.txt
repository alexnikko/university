Menkes disease (MD) is a fatal X-linked multisystem disease caused by mutations in ATP7A. In this study, clinical and genetic analysis was performed in 24 male MD patients. Development delay, seizures, kinky coarse hair, and dystonia were found in 24, 22, 24, and 24 patients, respectively. Serum ceruloplasmin/copper tested in 19 patients was low. Abnormal classic features of MD presented in the MRI/MRA of 19 patients. Seventeen mutations of ATP7A were identified in 22 patients. Twelve were novel mutations including three small deletion/insertion, one missense mutation, two nonsense mutations, three splicing-site mutations, and three gross deletions. Twenty-two patients were genetically diagnosed; neither point mutation nor deletion/duplication was found in two of them. c.2179G > A found in five patients might be a hot-spot mutation. Prenatal molecular diagnosis was performed for five unrelated fetuses (1 female and 4 male), which found four fetuses to be wild type and one male carried the same mutation as the proband. This study of the largest sample of Chinese MD patients examined to date discovered the unique phenotype and genotype spectrum in Chinese patients with 12 novel mutations of ATP7A, and that c.2179G > A might be a hot-spot mutation in MD patients. Five successful prenatal diagnosis contributed important information for MD families.
