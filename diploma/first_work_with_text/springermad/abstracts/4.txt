Although image-guided biopsies of bone and soft tissue lesions have a low complication rate, there is limited data evaluating use of preprocedural laboratory tests. To address this issue, patients were not required to stop non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and aspirin or to obtain preprocedural laboratory tests [complete blood count (CBC) and international normalized ratio (INR)], except in special circumstances. The bleeding complication rate, rate of same day biopsies, and the time from when the biopsy was ordered to when it was performed were obtained.
