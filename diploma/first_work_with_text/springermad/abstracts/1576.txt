Our interest was to find out whether pineal gland and their by melatonin act as modulator of immunosenescence. Parachlorophenylalanine (PCPA) – a β adrenergic blocker, is known to perform chemical pinealectomy (Px) by suppressing indirectly the substrate 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) for melatonin synthesis and thereby melatonin itself. The role of PCPA, alone and in combination with melatonin was recorded in immunomodulation and free radical load in spleen of young adult and aged seasonal breeder Indian palm squirrel Funambulus pennanti.
