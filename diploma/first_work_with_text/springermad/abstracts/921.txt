MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding, single-stranded small RNAs, usually 18â€“25 nucleotides long, have ability to regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. miRNAs are highly homologous, conserved and are found in various living organisms including plants and animals. Present studies show that these small RNAs anticipate and are directly involved in many important physiological and pathological processes including growth, proliferation, maturation, metabolism, and inflammation among others. Evidences are accumulating that miRNAs play active role in directing immune responses and, therefore, might be involved in pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. Recent studies have found that miRNAs are critical in proliferation, maturation and differentiation of T cells, B cells and, therefore, may affect the outcome of an immune response. In light of such understanding, this review briefly introduces miRNAs and discusses its role in the pathogenesis of various autoimmune diseases, as well as its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in the management of autoimmune diseases.
