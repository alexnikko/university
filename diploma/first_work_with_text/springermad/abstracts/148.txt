The advent of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has dramatically transformed the clinical approach to severe aortic stenosis. Over the last decade, several trials have shown the equivalence or even superiority of transcatheter valve replacement over the conventional surgical approach. As a result, TAVR as a treatment for severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis has rapidly extended from inoperable or prohibited-risk patients to intermediate-risk patients. The success of TAVR has led to the wide adaptation of this technique and, subsequently, a significant increase in the number of these procedures performed annually. As the number of these procedures is expected to further increase, especially if its indication will include those with low surgical risk, there is a great demand to improve patient recovery and early discharge without compromising outcomes. In this review, we will discuss the role of echocardiography in the perioperative planning and assessment of transcatheter aortic valve replacement. In addition, we will review the current evidence behind the use of intraprocedureal transthoracic echocardiography and the recommended steps for successful transition from transesophageal to transthoracic echocardiography.
