Autologous adoptive T cell immunotherapy has been recognized as an effective treatment for cancer patients. The initial qualified lymphocytes is the core element determining the immunotherapeutic outcomes clinically. Cell separator based apheresis procedure is an optimal procedure to collect adequate mono-nucleated lymphocytes to generate efficient ex vivo T cell expansions; however, potential catheter-associated femoral vein thrombosis at post-apheresis might rise an additional deteriorated morbidity for cancer patients. The emerging prophylactic medications are required at such circumstances. Therefore this study was designed to compare the prophylactic effects of rivaroxaban versus low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in patients who had exposed during the femoral vein catheterization for apheresis. 74 Patients were randomized 1:1:1 into three groups: subcutaneous injection of LMWH, Fraxiparine (n = 23) (0.4 ml, 3800 IU/day) for 2 days, oral rivaroxaban 10 mg/d (n = 26), and oral rivaroxaban 20 mg/d (n = 25) for consecutive 2 days. The primary endpoint was to compare the venous thromboembolism (VTE) occurrence cases in one month post catheterization. There were 4 cases confirmed VTE occurrence in LMWH group with contrast to 1 case in rivaroxaban 10 mg administration group. None was seen in rivaroxaban 20 mg group (P = 0.02 as the comparison with LMWH). Meantime there was no bleeding events occurrence afterwards. Oral rivaroxaban 20 mg/day was recommendable to be considered which superior to LMWH. Although these limited data and patient volume reached the statistical difference which was able to provide the evidence proofed to compare the potency of those two anticoagulants, it could be regarded as the preliminary data provide the clinical results for cancer patients who were placed in the condition of apheresis and subsequently undergone adoptive T cell immunotherapy.
