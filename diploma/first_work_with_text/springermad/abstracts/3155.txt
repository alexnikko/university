Site-specific drug delivery for the local treatment of the diseases in the oral cavity is far superior to the systemic administration, for both safety and efficacy reasons. This study presents the design and development of an innovative bio-adhesive delivery system (BDS) based on a bio-erodible semi-interpenetrating polymeric network (semi-IPN) for intraoral extended release of flurbiprofen (FBP).
