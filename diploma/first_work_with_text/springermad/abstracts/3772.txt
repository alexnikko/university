Inter- and intraindividual pharmacokinetics variability in humans affects the way in which drugs act on the body. Gastrointestinal surgery has an impact on this variability and significantly alters the kinetics of drugs in post-surgical patients. The way in which pharmacokinetic profiles are modified depends on the type of operative procedure performed. The extent to which the absorption of different groups of drugs is affected varies according to the site and length of intestinal resections.
