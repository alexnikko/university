The conscious entry into non-REM, delta wave sleep practiced by yogis under the title yoga-nidrā provides an opportunity for a fruitful collaboration that utilizes the sensitive subjective awareness of yogis to focus and fine-tune the increasingly powerful observational technologies at work in investigative neuroscience. This collaboration would best be conducted with a combination of qualitative and quantitative methodologies and can utilize the descriptions of states of consciousness in traditional textual materials to generate measurable hypotheses to be tested. These possibilities are discussed in the context of a review of research literature on yoga-nidrā. The literature has so far demonstrated a pronounced lack of clarity and rigor as a result of not using traditional sources which offer a clear definition and measurable hypotheses to guide research design as well as the contemporary practice of yoga-nidrā. Although there are quite a few studies of practices called ‘yoga-nidrā,’ very, very few of them bother to use electroencephalography to measure whether a state of yoga-nidrā is actually attained.
