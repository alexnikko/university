The prolactin-inducible protein (PIP) is considered a valuable biomarker that is associated with both benign and malignant pathological conditions of the mammary gland. The function of PIP in breast tumorigenesis remains unknown; however, evidence from our laboratory and others suggest that it regulates host immunity. Studies with PIP-deficient (PIP−/−) mice demonstrated significantly lower numbers of CD4+ T cells in their secondary lymphoid organs, impaired Th1 response, and impaired nitric oxide (NO) production. To further delineate the immunoregulatory role of PIP, we compared the expression of IFN-γR and TLR4, pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and intracellular signaling events by IFN-γ and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages from wild-type (WT) and PIP−/− mice. We showed that although the expressions of IFN-γR and TLR4 were comparable, productions of pro-inflammatory cytokines were decreased in PIP−/− macrophages. This was associated with decreased phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and signal transducer of activation of transcription (STAT) proteins in macrophages from PIP−/− mice. Interestingly, the expression of suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) 1 and 3 proteins, known to suppress IFN-γ and LPS signaling, was higher in PIP−/− macrophages compared to those from WT mice. Collectively, our studies show that deficiency of PIP significantly affects intracellular signaling events leading to decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and further confirms a role for PIP as an important immunoregulatory protein. This direct link between PIP and cell-mediated immunity, a key component of the immune system that is critical for cancer control, may have significant therapeutic implications.
