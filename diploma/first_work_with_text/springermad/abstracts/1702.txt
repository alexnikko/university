Today, neurorehabilitation has become in a widely used therapeutic approach in spinocerebellar ataxias; however, there are scarce powerful clinical studies supporting this notion, and these studies require extension to other specific SCA subtypes in order to be able to form conclusions concerning its beneficial effects. Therefore, in this study, we perform for the first time a case-control pilot randomized, single-blinded, cross-sectional, and observational study to evaluate the effects of physical neurorehabilitation on the clinical and biochemical features of patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) in 18 patients diagnosed with SCA7. In agreement with the exercise regimen, the participants were assigned to groups as follows: (a) the intensive training group, (b) the moderate training group, and (c) the non-training group (control group).
