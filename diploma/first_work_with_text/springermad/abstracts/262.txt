The impact of thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) on blood coagulation in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients is not completely understood. We studied the effect of thrombolysis on the thrombin generation (TG) profile as well as coagulant activity of activated factors IX (FIXa), XI (FXIa) and tissue factor (TF) in AIS patients. In a case-control study, TG parameters as well as FIXa, FXIa and TF levels were assessed in 95 AIS patients, including individuals receiving rtPA treatment within 4.5 h since AIS onset (n = 71, 74.7%) and those ineligible for thrombolysis (n = 24, 25.3%). Blood samples were collected at baseline and after 24 h since admission. The two groups were similar with regard to demographics and clinical factors. In thrombolysed patients, all TG parameters measured after 24 h were markedly decreased, with strongest impact on lag time (LT), when compared with the baseline values (81.3% longer LT, p < 0.0001), as well as when compared to the non-thrombolysed group (86% longer LT, p = 0.002). In non-thrombolysed AIS patients the TG remained unaltered. Logistic regression adjusted for potential confounders showed that high baseline ETP value (the top quartile) was solely predicted by the presence of circulating FIXa, whereas after 24 h FXIa predicted high ETP in the subgroup of thrombolysed and in all AIS patients. Thrombolysis in AIS patients markedly attenuates the TG. Elevated FXIa contributes to thrombin formation capacity after 24 h, highlighting a role of this factor in the regulation of blood coagulation in AIS.
