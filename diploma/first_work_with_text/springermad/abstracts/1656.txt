In the past decade, numerous genes associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) have been identified. These genes encode key regulators of synaptogenesis, synaptic function, and synaptic plasticity. Drosophila is a prominent model system for ASD studies to define novel genes linked to ASDs and decipher their molecular roles in synaptogenesis, synaptic function, synaptic plasticity, and neural circuit assembly and consolidation. Here, we review Drosophila studies on ASD genes that regulate synaptogenesis, synaptic function, and synaptic plasticity through modulating chromatin remodeling, transcription, protein synthesis and degradation, cytoskeleton dynamics, and synaptic scaffolding.
