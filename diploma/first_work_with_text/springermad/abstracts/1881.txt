Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common medical condition in obese and elderly population. Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is a major issue in patients with OSA. The increased rates of abnormalities in these patients have been ascribed to the structural and functional impairment caused by OSA. In an attempt to estimate the association between sleep apnea and arrhythmias, we made a qualitative retrospective study of ascertaining the prevalence of electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities in patients diagnosed with sleep apnea (n = 273) by a sleep centre over 1 year. About 10% (29) cases had ECG abnormalities, and premature ventricular contraction (PVC) was the most frequent abnormality, seen in about 75% of these cases. Further studies are required to elucidate the prognostic significance and optimal modes of intervention for these ECG abnormalities in patients with OSA.
