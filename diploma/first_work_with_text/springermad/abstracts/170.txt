Echocardiographic
 evaluation of prosthetic valves is similar in many respects to evaluation of native valve disease. However, there are some important differences. First, there are several types of prosthetic valves with different fluid dynamics for each basic design and differing flow velocities for each valve size. Second, the mechanisms of valve dysfunction are somewhat different from those for native valve disease. Third, the technical aspects of imaging artificial devices, specifically the problem of acoustic shadowing, significantly affect the diagnostic approach when prosthetic valve dysfunction is suspected. Fourth, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has rapidly expanded in recent years. Echocardiography plays an essential role in identifying patients suitable for TAVI and providing intra-procedural monitoring, and is the modality for post-procedure follow-up. Both an understanding of the basic approach to echocardiographic evaluation and detailed knowledge of the specific flow dynamics for the size and type of prosthesis in an individual patient are needed for appropriate patient management.
