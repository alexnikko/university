The obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a type of sleep-related breathing disorder and a highly prevalent disease. Because of frequent arousals during the night, OSAS leads to a fragmentation of sleep and the loss of its restorative function. Being in the supine position during sleep makes the individual more susceptible to obstructive apneic events. This influence of sleeping position on OSAS is thought to be generally greater in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep than in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep stages. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of a supine alarm device that combines an auditory and vibrational signal to discourage patients with OSAS from lying in the supine position during sleep.
