The deleterious effects of alcohol use disorders (AUDs) on human health have been documented worldwide. The enormous socioeconomic burden coupled with lack of efficacious pharmacotherapies underlies the need for improved treatment strategies. At present, there is a growing body of preclinical evidence that demonstrates the potential of avermectins [ivermectin (IVM), selamectin (SEL), abamectin (ABM), and moxidectin (MOX)] in treatment of AUDs. Avermectins are derived by fermentation of soil micro-organism, Streptomyces avermitilis, and have been extensively used for treatment of parasitic infections. From the mechanistic standpoint, avermectins are positive modulators of purinergic P2X4 receptors (P2X4Rs). P2X4Rs belong to P2X superfamily of cation-permeable ion channels gated by adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP). Building evidence has implicated a role for P2X4Rs in regulation of ethanol intake and that ethanol can inhibit ATP-gated currents in P2X4Rs. Investigations using recombinant cell models and animal models of alcohol drinking have reported that IVM, ABM, and MOX, but not SEL, were able to antagonize the inhibitory effects of ethanol on P2X4Rs in vitro and reduce ethanol intake in vivo. Furthermore, IVM was shown to reduce ethanol consumption via P2X4R potentiation in vivo, supporting the involvement of P2X4Rs in IVM’s anti-alcohol effects and that P2X4Rs can be used as a platform for developing novel anti-alcohol compounds. Taken together, these findings support the utility of avermectins as a novel class of drug candidates for treatment of AUDs.
