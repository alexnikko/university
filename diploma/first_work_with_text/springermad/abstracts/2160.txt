Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are emerging as a novel, yet powerful player in many human diseases. They are involved in several cellular processes and are becoming a noteworthy type of biomarkers. Among other functions, circRNAs can serve as RNA sponges or as scaffolds for RNA-binding proteins. Here, we investigated a microarray expression profile of circRNAs in leukocyte samples from ALS patients and age- and sex-matched healthy controls to identify differentially expressed circRNAs. We selected 10 of them for a qPCR validation of expression on a larger set of samples, identification of their associations with clinical parameters, and evaluation of their diagnostic potential. In total, expression of 7/10 circRNAs was significant in a larger cohort of ALS patients, compared with age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Three of them (hsa_circ_0023919, hsa_circ_0063411, and hsa_circ_0088036) showed the same regulation as in microarray results. These three circRNAs also had AUC > 0.95, and sensitivity and specificity for the optimal threshold point > 90%, showing their potential for using them as diagnostic biomarkers.
