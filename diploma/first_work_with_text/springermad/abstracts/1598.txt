During sprouting angiogenesis, stalk cells, localized behind tip cells, generate endothelial cells (ECs) for the elongation of new vessels. We hypothesized that stalk cells may have endothelial progenitor cell properties because of their highly proliferative ability. We conducted Hoechst dye DNA staining in ECs of preexisting blood vessels from hind limb muscle and found that endothelial-side population (E-SP) cells, which efflux Hoechst rapidly with abundant ABC transporters, show highly producing ability of ECs. We previously showed the existence of E-SP cells in hind limb muscle, retina, and liver, but not in other tissues such as adipose tissue, skin, and placenta.
