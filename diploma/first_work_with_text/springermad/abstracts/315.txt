Myocardial infarction is the combined result of environmental factors and personal predispositions. Prothrombotic factors might play an important role in this phenomenon. Annexin V (ANV) is a calcium-dependent glycoprotein widely present in various tissues exerting a potent anticoagulant effect in vitro by reducing plaque adhesion and aggregation. Anti-annexin V antibodies (aANVAs) are detected in various diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome. The study of ANV in Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) might shed light on hypercoagulability mechanisms in the pathogenesis of acute coronary syndromes. This study was conducted to investigate the association of plasma ANV, aANVAs and anti-cardiolipin antibodies (aCLAs) with AMI.
