Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is a popular surgical procedure for obesity treatment. Prediction of post-operative complication occurrence can result in better outcomes. It is reported that anthropometric measures such as waist circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC), arm circumference (AC), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and conicity index are more sensitive to predict the risk of obesity-related diseases than body mass index (BMI) and body weight (BW) are. No study has investigated the relationship between these anthropometric measures and complications after LSG in people with obesity. This cross-sectional study assessed 54 people with obesity with a BMI between 35 and 55, who were being evaluated for LSG. BW, height, BMI, AC, WC, and HC were measured and WHtR, WHR, and conicity index were calculated before and after LSG. Short- and long-term surgery complications were collected by using medical records and contact with the patients. Paired sample t test, independent sample test, and chi-square were used to analyze data. Short- and long-term complications were 13 and 37%, respectively. Pre- and post-operative HC showed significant differences between patients with and without short-term complications (P < 0.05). Pre-operative AC, HC, WC, WHtR, and conicity index and post-operative HC, WC, and WHtR showed significant differences between patients with and without long-term complications (P < 0.05). The correlation between pre-operative AC and long-term complications, post-operative HC and short-term complications, and post-operative WHR and short-term complications was significant (P < 0.05). Post-operative complications were associated with AC, HC, and WHR in people with obesity undergone LSG.
