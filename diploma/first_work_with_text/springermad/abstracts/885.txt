Anti-ZnT8 antibodies (ZnT8A) were recently proposed as a new independent serological marker in Type 1 diabetes (T1D), leading to a significant improvement of the positive predictive value of autoantibody measurement in this setting. The aim of this retrospective multicentre study was to investigate ZnT8A as a complement to the current T1D autoantibody assays in a large cohort of paediatric Italian patients.
