An increased incidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) has been described in multiple myeloma (MM). A recently described mechanism of hypercoagulability in cancer patients including MM patients is acquired activated protein C resistance (APC-R). The purpose of the present study was to examine the association between the combination of thalidomide plus chemotherapy and DVT development in a cohort of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. We also evaluated the association between acquired activated protein C resistance and DVT.
