Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) has been recently introduced as a novel MRI post-processing technique of gradient recalled echo (GRE) data. QSM is useful in depicting both brain anatomy and for detecting abnormalities. Its utility in the context of ischemic stroke has, however, not been extensively characterized so far. In this study, we explored the potential of QSM to characterize vascular and tissue changes in the transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) mouse model of cerebral ischemia. We acquired GRE data of mice brains at different time points after tMCAO, from which we computed QSM and MR frequency maps, and compared these maps with diffusion imaging and multi-slice multi-echo imaging data acquired in the same animals. Prominent vessels with increased magnetic susceptibility were visible surrounding the lesion on both frequency and magnetic susceptibility maps at all time points (mostly visible at > 12 h after reperfusion). Immunohistochemistry revealed the presence of compressed capillaries and dilated larger vessels, suggesting that the appearance of prominent vessels after reestablishment of reperfusion may serve compensatory purposes. In addition, on both contrast maps, tissue regions of decreased magnetic susceptibility were observed at 24 and 48 h after reperfusion that were distinctly different from the lesions seen on maps of the apparent diffusion coefficient and T 2 relaxation time constant. Since QSM can be extracted as an add-on from GRE data and thus requires no additional acquisition time in the course of acute stroke MRI examination, it may provide unique and complementary information during the course of acute stroke MRI examinations.
