The objective of the present study was to develop and optimize generic topical gel formulation of diclofenac sodium through quality by design approaches. The quality target product profile was set for the critical quality attributes of the gel. The key material variables like hydrophilic gelling agent carbopol and penetration enhancer kolliphor were optimized using design of experiments. A central composite design was used considering viscosity and cumulative percent diffusion of the drug after 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 6Â h as responses. The p values for all models generated for different responses were statistically significant (<0.5). Design space was established and verified at the laboratory scale. The predicted and observed values were in close agreement. The robustness of the formula was tested at a higher scale (10X and 200X). The capability index was calculated followed by Monte Carlo simulation and the Cpk values for all the responses were more than 1.33.
