Reticulated platelets (RPs) are immature platelets with high dense granules content and a residual amount of megakaryocyte-derived of mRNA. Increased level of RPs has been found to be an independent predictor of cardiovascular ischemic events, and has been associated with impaired response to various anti-platelet drugs. The study aimed to characterize and compare the surface antigenic properties of reticulated versus mature platelets. Platelets from healthy individuals and diabetic patients were tested at rest and after activation with adenosine diphosphate (ADP). For each patient, we calculated the proportion of RPs and mature platelets using flow cytometry analysis with thiazole orange staining (for RPs) and CD42b platelet-specific antibody. We also tested the surface expression of P-selectin and Annexin V, by double staining flow cytometry in RPs versus mature platelets. A total of 20 subjects were recruited (10 healthy individuals, 10 diabetics). Activation with ADP did not cause a significant change in the proportion of RPs. Following activation, RPs demonstrated a significant increase in the expression of both P-selectin and Annexin V, while mature platelets exhibited a non-significant increase in both markers. These findings were consistent in both healthy subjects and patients with diabetes. In conclusion, RPs have a significantly higher capacity to increase the expression of platelet activation markers compared with mature platelets.
