An important type of arterial thrombosis, ischemic stroke is associated with increased mortality risk, severe disability and life quality impairment. In this study, we analyzed mean platelet volume, platelet count values and genetic thrombophilia markers of patients who have ischemic stroke history and searched the relationship with genetic predisposition of ischemic strokes and platelet parameters. A retrospective, clinical trial was performed by reviewing the ischemic stroke history (except cryptogenic events) of 599 patients and 100 controls. The results of the genetic thrombophilia panel were used to classify the study group and control group into low and high risk for thrombophilia groups. The high-risk group included patients homozygous/heterozygous for Factor II g.20210G>A or Factor V Leiden mutations with/without any other polymorphism. The low-risk group included patients heterozygous or homozygous for MTHFR (C677T, A1298C), PAI-1, Î²-fibrinogen, Factor XIIIA (V34L) and glycoprotein IIIa (L33P) polymorphisms or negative in terms of both mutations and polymorphisms. The results of study showed us that high-risk group mutations are important risk factors for ischemic stroke but low-risk group polymorphisms are not significant. According to platelet parameters, although there was a significant difference between MPV and PLT values of ischemic stroke and control group, thrombophilia mutations and polymorphisms have not a significant effect on MPV and PLT values in ischemic stroke patients.
