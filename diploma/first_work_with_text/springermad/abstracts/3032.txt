In patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery and having positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs), the ACOSOG Z0011 trial showed equivalent loco-regional outcomes for patients receiving SLN dissection (SLND) alone and those receiving axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). We conducted a prospective single-arm study to confirm the applicability of the Z0011 criteria to Japanese patients with breast cancer.
