In utero exposure of the fetal non-human primate (NHP) brain to alcohol on a single occasion during early or late third-trimester gestation triggers widespread acute apoptotic death of cells in both gray and white matter (WM) regions of the fetal brain. In a prior publication, we documented that the dying gray matter cells are neurons, and described the regional distribution and magnitude of this cell death response. Here, we present new findings regarding the magnitude, identity and maturational status of the dying WM cells in these alcohol-exposed fetal NHP brains.
