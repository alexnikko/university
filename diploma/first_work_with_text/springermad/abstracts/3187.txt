Sensitive and selective analytical method is required for the estimation of ramipril in human plasma as ramipril has been reported to have high intra-subject variability and phase II inactive metabolite (ramipril acyl glucuronide) back-converted to ramipril in an in vitro system. If this back conversion is not restricted, it could lead to pseudo estimation of ramipril in human plasma.
