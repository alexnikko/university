The literature suggests that optimal levels of gait symmetry might exist for lower-limb amputees. Not only these optimal values are unknown, but we also donâ€™t know typical symmetry ratios or which measures of symmetry are essential. Focusing on the symmetries of stance, step, first peak and impulse of the ground reaction force, the aim of this work was to answer to three methodological and three clinical questions. The methodological questions wanted to establish a minimum set of symmetry indexes to study and if there are limitations in their calculations. The clinical questions wanted to establish if typical levels of temporal and loading symmetry exist, and change with the level of amputation and prosthetic components.
