Lewy body forms of primary chronic autonomic failure (CAF) such as incidental Lewy body disease (ILBD), Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD), and pure autonomic failure evolving into dementia with Lewy bodies (PAF+DLB) feature cardiac sympathetic denervation, whereas multiple system atrophy (MSA) in most cases does not. What links Lewy bodies with cardiac sympathetic denervation in CAF? In familial PD, abnormalities of the alpha-synuclein (AS) gene cause CAF and cardiac sympathetic denervation; and in sporadic PD, brainstem Lewy bodies contain AS co-localized with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a marker of catecholaminergic neurons. Cytotoxicity from AS deposition within sympathetic neurons might explain noradrenergic denervation in Lewy body forms of CAF. We used immunofluorescence microscopy (IM) to explore this possibility in sympathetic ganglia obtained at autopsy from CAF patients.
