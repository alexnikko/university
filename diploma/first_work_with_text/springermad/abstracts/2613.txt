Alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) localization was investigated in the utero-vagina of the one-humped camel during the follicular and luteal phases. A total of 86 dromedary she-camels brought to the Maiduguri municipal abattoir for slaughter were used for this study. Blood was collected prior to slaughter, and the corresponding genitalia was also collected immediately after slaughter. The ovarian structures and serum progesterone levels were evaluated and used to categorize the animals into the follicular (FP) and luteal phases (LP). The utero-vaginal tissues were also subjected to immunohistochemistry for the localization of alpha smooth muscle actin. The serum P4 levels ranged from 0.6 to 2.5 ng/ml with means of 0.89 ± 0.16 and 1.61 ± 0.81 ng/ml for camels in the follicular and luteal phases, respectively. Immunohistochemistry result demonstrated the localization of α-SMA in the smooth muscle cells of the uterus and vagina during both reproductive phases. Alpha-SMA reactions were intense in the tunica muscularis and the smooth muscles of the blood vessels, with mild evidence of α-SMA localization within the epithelial linings of the vagina and uterine glands. There were no differences (p > 0.05) in the distribution of high positive, low positive, and negative percentages in both uterine and vaginal sections. However, there were differences (p < 0.05) in the positive scores between uterine follicular phase (UFP) and vaginal luteal phase (VLP); uterine luteal phase (ULP) and vaginal luteal phase (VLP); and vaginal follicular (VFP) and vaginal luteal phase (VLP). It was concluded that the patterns of α-SMA localization in the utero-vagina during both the follicular and luteal phases were similar in camels.
