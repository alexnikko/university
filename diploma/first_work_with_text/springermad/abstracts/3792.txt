Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a pervasive psychiatric disorder characterized by emotion dysregulation, impulsivity, impaired self-perceptions, and interpersonal relationships and currently affects 1–3% of the US population as reported by Torgersen et al. (Arch Gen Psychiatry 58:590–596, Torgersen et al. 2001), Lenzenweger et al. (Biol Psychiatry 62:553–564, Lenzenweger et al. 2007), and Tomko et al. (J Personal Disord 28:734–750, Tomko et al. 2014). One major obstacle to our understanding of the neural underpinnings of BPD is a lack of valid animal models that translate the key known features of the disorder to a system that is amenable to study.
