Antazoline is a first-generation antihistaminic agent with additional anticholinergic properties and antiarrhythmic potential. Recent data shows its high effectiveness in sinus rhythm restoration among patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. The effect of antazoline on electrophysiological parameters of the heart in vivo has not yet been examined. The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in electrophysiological parameters of the heart muscle and conduction system as a response to increasing doses of antazoline.
