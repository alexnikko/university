In this study, an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) was impregnated onto a mesoporous carrier (excipient) in a fluidized bed. Impregnating APIs in porous carriers has the potential to simplify the drug substance development process and leads to the elimination of the blending and granulation unit operations. Impregnation and drying occur simultaneously in fluidized-bed impregnation, and this method precludes several challenges encountered in other impregnation methods. Furthermore, the process ensures a uniform distribution of APIs within the porous carriers. This method also allows for a variety of solvents to be used in the impregnation.
