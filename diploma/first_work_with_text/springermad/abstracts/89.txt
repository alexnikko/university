There remains a clinical question of which patients benefit from revascularization of non-culprit coronary artery stenosis in the setting of acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infraction (STEMI). This is a large population of patients with prior studies showing 40 to 70% of patients with STEMI having non-culprit stenosis. This article reviews the current state of the literature evaluating outcomes of those previously randomized to revascularization of non-culprit stenosis around the time of the STEMI. We propose a new study design to utilize gated-SPECT in the decision process by using an ischemic burden of > 5% as a cut-off for revascularization vs. complete revascularization without ischemia assessment.
