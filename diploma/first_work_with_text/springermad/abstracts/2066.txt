A matricellular protein galectin-3 is involved in tissue injury and inflammation, but the role of galectin-3 remains unclear in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The purpose of this study was to assess whether acute-stage galectin-3 levels were associated with the subsequent development of neurovascular events and outcome after SAH. This study included 83 consecutive patients diagnosed with aneurysmal SAH of resuscitated World Federation of Neurological Surgeons (WFNS) grades 1–3. Plasma galectin-3 levels were once measured on days 1–3 (the day after clipping or coiling). Fifteen patients had poor outcomes, which were associated with increasing age, female, pre-onset morbidity, worse WFNS grade, modified Fisher computed tomography scale, acute hydrocephalus, and higher galectin-3 levels compared with good outcomes. Multivariate analyses revealed that plasma galectin-3 was an independent determinant for poor outcome (odds ratio, 3.08; 95% confidence interval, 1.58–6.00; p = 0.001). Among post-SAH neurovascular events occurring on day 4 and thereafter, delayed cerebral ischemia and infarction, but not angiographic vasospasm and shunt-dependent hydrocephalus, showed significantly higher plasma galectin-3 levels on days 1–3. The receiver operating characteristic curve indicated that plasma galectin-3 with a cutoff value of 3.30 or 3.48 ng/ml predicted delayed cerebral infarction development or poor outcome (specificity, 62.5%, 70.6%; sensitivity, 90.9%, 73.3%, respectively). The findings suggest that plasma galectin-3 levels on days 1–3 would be a useful biomarker for predicting subsequent development of delayed cerebral infarction and eventual poor outcome and provide a new candidate, which may mediate between post-SAH early brain injury or inflammation and delayed cerebral infarction without vasospasm.
