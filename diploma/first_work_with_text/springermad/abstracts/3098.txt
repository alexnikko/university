Uterine carcinosarcoma is considered as metaplastic carcinoma comprising of both carcinomatous and sarcomatous components which are believed to arise from a single metaplastic clone. Carcinosarcomas have resembled in epidemiology, risk factors and clinical behavior with endometrial adenocarcinoma as opposed to uterine sarcomas and are therefore considered a high-risk variant of endometrial carcinoma. The aim of this study is to evaluate clinical presentation, histopathologic pattern, management, recurrence pattern and outcome of uterine carcinosarcomas presenting to a tertiary care cancer center over an 8-year period.
