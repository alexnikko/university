Currently, resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as gefitinib, has become a major obstacle in improving the clinical outcome of patients with metastatic and advanced-stage esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). While cell behavior can be modulated by long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), the roles of lncRNAs within extracellular vesicles (exosomes) are largely unknown. Therefore, we investigated the involvement and regulatory functions of potential lncRNAs enclosed in exosomes during formation of chemoresistance in human ESCC.
