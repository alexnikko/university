A phase I study using two peptide vaccines derived from M phase phosphoprotein 1 (MPHOSPH1) and DEP domain containing 1 (DEPDC1) demonstrated promising results for the treatment of advanced bladder cancer. Therefore, we further tested the ability of these peptides to prevent recurrence after transurethral resection of the bladder tumor in patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC).
