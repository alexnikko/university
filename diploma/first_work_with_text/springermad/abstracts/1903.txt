Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) results in impaired neurologic function that for many individuals is permanent and significantly impacts health, function, quality of life, and life expectancy. Many efforts have been taken to develop effective treatments for SCI; nevertheless, proven therapies targeting neurologic regeneration and functional recovery have been limited. Existing therapeutic approaches, including early surgery, strict blood pressure control, and consideration of treatment with steroids, remain debated and largely focus on mitigating secondary injury after the primary trauma has occurred. Today, there is more research being performed in SCI than ever before. Current clinical trials are exploring pharmacologic, cell-based, physiologic, and rehabilitation approaches to reduce secondary injury and also overcome barriers to neurorecovery. In the future, it is likely that tailored treatments combining many of these strategies will offer significant benefits for persons with SCI. This article aims to review key past, current and emerging neurologic and rehabilitation therapeutic approaches for adults with traumatic SCI.
