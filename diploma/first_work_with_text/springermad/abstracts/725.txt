The ubiquitous calcium–independent phospholipase A2 enzyme (iPLA2) is inhibited by calmodulin binding and known to be responsible for phospholipid remodeling housekeeping functions including granule exocytosis–associated membrane fusion in normal human neutrophils. We evaluate in human neutrophils the iPLA2 secretagogue effects using normal neutrophils, where reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation has been blocked by diphenyleneiodonium, as well as in neutrophils from chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) patients.
