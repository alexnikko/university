This study investigated the possible neuroprotective properties of two commonly consumed tropical vegetables. The modulatory effects of Vernonia amygdalina (VA) and Struchium sparganophora (SS) on the activities of Na+/K+ ATPase, ecto-5′-nucleotidase, monoamine oxidase (MAO), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), and FeSO4-induced oxidative stress in rat brain homogenate were assessed. The result revealed that both vegetables inhibited AChE, BChE, MAO, and ecto-5’nucleotidase activities, but stimulated Na+/K+ ATPase activity in a concentration-dependent manner. The SS had a significantly higher (P ˂ 0.05) inhibitory effect on AChE (IC50 = 4.83 μg/mL), BChE (IC50 = 5.61 μg/mL), MAO (IC50 = 26.11 μg/mL), ecto-5′ nucleotidase (IC50 = 23.04 μg/mL) than VA [AChE (IC50 = 7.53 μg/mL), BChE (IC50 = 7.32 μg/mL), MAO (IC50 = 26.11 μg/mL), and ecto-5′ nucleotidase (IC50 = 42.35 μg/mL)]. Furthermore, SS (IC50 = 28.30 μg/mL) had a significantly higher (P < 0.05) stimulatory effect on Na+/K+ ATPase activity than VA (IC50 = 34.87 μg/mL). Both extracts exhibited a strong antioxidant properties as typified by their radicals (OH and DPPH) scavenging and Fe2+ chelating abilities, as well as inhibition of Fe2+-induced lipid peroxidation in rat brain homogenate. The HPLC fingerprint of VA and SS extracts revealed the presence of catechin, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, rutin, orientin, quercitrin quercetin, and luteolin. The stimulation of Na+/K+ ATPase activity, inhibition of 5′-nucleotidase, AChE, BChE, and MAO activities as well as Fe2+-induced oxidative stress could be a possible mechanism through which VA and SS exerts neuroprotective properties.
