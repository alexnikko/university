Â Transmission Raman Spectroscopy (TRS) has become an increasingly applied technology in the analysis of pharmaceutical tablets for quality control purposes and developing formulation and process understanding. One area that has received only cursory attention to date is that of bilayered tablets that represents an unusually challenging situation. This study aims to provide an understanding of the relationship of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) content and the transmission Raman spectral response in bilayered pharmaceutical tablets to facilitate development of quantitative models for the prediction of API content in multilayer tablets.
