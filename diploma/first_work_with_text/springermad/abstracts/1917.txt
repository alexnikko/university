Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system, and the most common cause of nontraumatic disability in young adults. Most patients have a relapsingâ€“remitting course, and roughly half of them will eventually enter a degenerative progressive phase, marked by gradual accrual of disability over time in the absence of relapses. Early initiation of treatment has delayed the onset of disability progression. Thus, there is increased interest in treating to target in MS, particularly targeting no evidence of disease activity. This review will describe the most common treatment goals in MS: the Rio scores, disease-free survival, and no evidence of disease activity. We will also cover how well current disease-modifying therapies achieve no evidence of disease activity, and discuss future options for improving MS treatment targets.
