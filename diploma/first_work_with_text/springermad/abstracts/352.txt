Circulating miRNAs can function as biomarkers for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases. However, it is unclear whether miRNAs can be used as biomarkers for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). To this end, we applied gene chip technology to analyze miRNA expression in patients with stable angina (SA), non-ST elevation ACS (NSTE-ACS), and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).
