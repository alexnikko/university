Angiogenesis and metastasis are two critical steps for cancer cells survival and migration. The microenvironment of tumor sphere induces new blood vessels formation for enhancing tumor mass. Preexisting capillaries and postcapillary venules in tumors bring about new blood vessels. ROBO1-ROBO4 are transmembrane receptors family which act as guidance molecules of the nervous system. The SLITs family is secreted glycoproteins that bind to these receptors. SLIT-ROBO signaling pathway plays an important role in neurogenesis and immune response. Linkage between ROBOs and their ligands (SLITs) induce chemorepllent signal for regulation of axon guidance and leukocyte cell migration, recent finding shows that it is also involved in endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis in various type of cancers. In this article we review recent finding of SLIT-ROBO pathway in angiogenesis and metastasis.
