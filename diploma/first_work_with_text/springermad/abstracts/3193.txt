The current push towards sustainability has pressurized pharmaceutical companies to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in their manufacturing supply chains (SCs). However, the heavily regulated nature of the pharmaceutical industry has necessitated decisions such as sourcing of raw materials including names and addresses of suppliers and siting of plants to be locked early during the registration of a new drug. This could result in SC inefficiencies during the drug commercial life leading to higher than necessary GHG emissions. This paper presents a systematic framework for design of a more sustainable pharmaceutical SC network at the commercial stage that can be performed during the early stages of drug development.
