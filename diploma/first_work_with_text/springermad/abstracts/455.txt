Renin is the first and rate-limiting step of the renin-angiotensin system. The exclusive source of renin in the circulation are the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney, which line the afferent arterioles at the entrance of the glomeruli. Normally, renin production by these cells suffices to maintain homeostasis. However, under chronic stimulation of renin release, for instance during a low-salt diet or antihypertensive therapy, cells that previously expressed renin during congenital life re-convert to a renin-producing cell phenotype, a phenomenon which is known as “recruitment”. How exactly such differentiation occurs remains to be clarified. This review critically discusses the phenotypic plasticity of renin cells, connecting them not only to the classical concept of blood pressure regulation, but also to more complex contexts such as development and growth processes, cell repair mechanisms and tissue regeneration.
