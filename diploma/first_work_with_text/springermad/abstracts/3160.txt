Methotrexate (MTX), a potent anticancer drug, shows low oral bioavailability due to its low aqueous solubility and permeability. Moreover, its multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer and toxic effects restricts its clinical applications. The aim of the study was to prepare novel MTX-loaded Poloxamer 407 and GelucireÂ®44/14 (GL44) mixed micelles (MTX-PGMM) to improve its oral bioavailability and cytotoxicity and to reduce its systemic toxicity.
