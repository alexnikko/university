Catheter designs incorporating metallic braiding have high torque control and kink resistance compared with unbraided alternatives. However, metallic segments longer than a quarter wavelength (~ 12 cm for 1.5 T scanner) are prone to radiofrequency (RF) induced heating during cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) catheterization. We designed a braid-reinforced catheter with interrupted metallic segments to mitigate RF-induced heating yet retain expected mechanical properties for CMR catheterization.
