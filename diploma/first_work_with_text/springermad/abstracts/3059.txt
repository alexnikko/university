Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) are clinically malignant, having metastatic potential. Histological tumor grade is an accepted indicator of malignant potential, but noninvasive prognostic markers have not yet been identified. This study assessed whether the preoperative neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) could predict clinical outcomes of PNET patients.
