Currently available techniques for the evaluation of small fiber neuropathy and related sudomotor function remain suboptimal. Electrochemical skin conductance (ESC) has recently been introduced as a simple noninvasive and fast method for the detection of sudomotor dysfunction. The purpose of this review is to synthesize and appraise research using ESC measurements for sudomotor evaluation in adults.
