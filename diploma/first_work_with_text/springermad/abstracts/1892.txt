Peripheral nerve injury downregulates the expression of the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) and voltage-gated potassium channel subunit Kv1.2 by increasing their DNA methylation in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG). Ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase 1 (TET1) causes DNA demethylation. Given that DRG MOR and Kv1.2 downregulation contribute to neuropathic pain genesis, this study investigated the effect of DRG TET1 overexpression on neuropathic pain. Overexpression of TET1 in the DRG through microinjection of herpes simplex virus expressing full-length TET1 mRNA into the injured rat DRG significantly alleviated the fifth lumbar spinal nerve ligation (SNL)–induced pain hypersensitivities during the development and maintenance periods, without altering acute pain or locomotor function. This microinjection also restored morphine analgesia and attenuated morphine analgesic tolerance development after SNL. Mechanistically, TET1 microinjection rescued the expression of MOR and Kv1.2 by reducing the level of 5-methylcytosine and increasing the level of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in the promoter and 5′ untranslated regions of the Oprml1 gene (encoding MOR) and in the promoter region of the Kcna2 gene (encoding Kv1.2) in the DRG ipsilateral to SNL. These findings suggest that DRG TET1 overexpression mitigated neuropathic pain likely through rescue of MOR and Kv1.2 expression in the ipsilateral DRG. Virus-mediated DRG delivery of TET1 may open a new avenue for neuropathic pain management.
