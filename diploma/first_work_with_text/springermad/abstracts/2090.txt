Previous cross-sectional studies have demonstrated a higher incidence of dehydration in patients admitted for stroke suggesting a possible association. However, the temporality of the association has not been well established. We examined whether dehydration increases the risk of ischemic stroke in patients with a recent hospitalization for atrial fibrillation (AF). Data was from 1994 to 2012 from the Myocardial Infarction Data Acquisition System (MIDAS), a repository of in-patient records New Jersey hospitals, for AF hospitalizations (n = 1,282,787). Estimates for the association between AF hospitalization with/without dehydration and ischemic stroke within 30 days post-AF discharge were determined using log-linear multivariable modeling adjusting for socio-demographic factors and comorbid conditions. Within 10 days of discharge for AF, patients 18–80 years old (YO) with comorbid dehydration had a 60 % higher risk of ischemic stroke compared to AF patients without comorbid dehydration (adjusted risk ratio (ARR) 1.60, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.28–2.00). Eighteen- to 80-YO patients had a 34 % higher risk of ischemic stroke in days 11–20 post-AF discharge (ARR 1.34, 95 % CI 1.04, 1.74). There was no difference in the risk of stroke in 18–80-YO patients with or without prior dehydration during days 21–30 post-AF discharge. We also found no difference in the risk of ischemic stroke during any time period in patients over 80 YO. Dehydration may be a significant risk factor for ischemic stroke in patients 18–80 YO with AF.
