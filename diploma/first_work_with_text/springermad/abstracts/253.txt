Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The relationship between SLE and perioperative cardiovascular risks following non-cardiac surgery is uncertain. We investigated associations between a diagnosis of SLE and outcomes following major non-cardiac surgery in a large national database from the United States. Patients age ≥ 18 years requiring major non-cardiac surgery were identified from Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project’s National Inpatient Sample data from 2004 to 2014. Systemic lupus erythematosus and perioperative major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE; myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke or death) were defined by ICD-9 diagnosis codes. Perioperative MACE were reported for SLE patients stratified by age and sex. From 2004 to 2014, a total of 17,853,194 hospitalizations for major non-cardiac surgery met study inclusion criteria. SLE was identified in 70,578 (0.4%) hospitalizations. Overall, the frequency of perioperative MACE was higher in patients with vs. without SLE [2.4 vs. 2.0%, p < 0.001; adjusted OR (aOR) 1.25; 95% CI 1.18–1.31]. Perioperative MACE associated with SLE was largely driven by increased death (aOR 1.58 95% CI 1.40–1.77) and myocardial infarction (aOR 1.32; 95% CI 1.05–1.66) in younger patients with SLE. The increased risk of perioperative MACE associated with SLE in younger patients was attenuated with increasing age. A diagnosis of SLE is associated with increased risk of perioperative MACE, particularly among younger patients. Efforts to improve the perioperative management and outcomes of patients with SLE are needed.
