Human 8-oguanine glycosylase 1(hOGG1), voltage-dependent anion channel 1(VDAC1), hexokinase 2(HK-2), represented the process of oxidative DNA damage, cell apoptosis and glycolysis, respectively. This study aims to explore the association between expression of hOGG1, VDAC1, HK-2 and cervical carcinoma.
