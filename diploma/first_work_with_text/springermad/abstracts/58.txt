Dysfunctional or infected hemodialysis polyester-cuffed catheters often require removal and are dissected out. The DermaPortâ„¢, percutaneous vascular access system (PVAS) permanently integrates a titanium mesh with the skin forming a stable, sterile barrier that allows for catheter placement, adjustment, or catheter exchange. This study aimed to describe the use and clinical outcomes of the DermaPort PVAS.
