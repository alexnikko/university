Anti-phospholipid antibodies (aPL) analyzed by line immunoassay (LIA) can recognize beta2-glycoprotein I (β2GPI) domain 1 (D1) epitopes depending on β2GPI binding to distinct phospholipids. The aPL LIA was compared with consensus ELISA to investigate whether both techniques can discriminate anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS) patients from aPL-positive, systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (SARD) patients without clinical symptoms of APS and controls.
