Autosomal recessively inherited lipopolysaccharide-responsive beige-like anchor (LRBA) protein deficiency was shown to be responsible for different types of inborn errors of immunity, such as common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) and autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS). The aim of this study was to compare patients with LRBA-related ALPS and LRBA-related CVID, to describe their clinical and laboratory phenotypes, and to prepare an algorithm for their diagnosis and management.
