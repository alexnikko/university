Gambogic acid (GA) has been proven to be a potent chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of lung cancer in clinical trials. However, GA is limited in its therapeutic value by properties such as poor water solubility and low chemical stability. In clinical trials, cationic arginine (Arg) was added to solubilize GA, and this may also cause other side effects. Here, we have designed and developed a more efficient human serum albumin (HSA)-based delivery system for GA with low toxicity which helps improve its solubility, chemical stability and increases its antitumor efficacy. The GA-HSA nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared by albumin-bound (nabTM) technology, with a particle size of 135.2 ± 35.03 nm, a zeta potential of −21.81 ± 1.24 mV, and a high entrapment efficiency. Compared with GA-Arg solution, the physical and chemical stability of the NPs were improved when stored at pH 7.4 in PBS or freeze-dried. The in vitro drug release showed that GA-HSA NPs had a more sustained release than GA-Arg solution. Furthermore, HSA NPs improved the therapeutic efficacy of GA and were less toxic compared with GA-Arg solution in A549-bearing mice. Therefore, this delivery system is a promising polymeric carrier for GA when used for tumor therapy.
