Primary Retroperitoneal Sarcomas are relatively uncommon tumors with varied manifestations, ill-defined prognostic factors and uncertain management modalities. We undertook this study to review patients who presented with primary or recurrent RPS at our institute during the study period. Between 2008 and 2010, 23 patients were evaluated. Statistical analysis was done using the chi square test or Fisher’s exact test. Recurrence was calculated using Kaplan Meier curves. The log-rank test was used to compare differences in survival or relapse. Among the 23 patients, 13 were males. Majority (52.2 %) presented with abdominal lump located in umbilical and right hypochondrial region. Surgery was done in 20 (87 %) patients for primary RPS and three (13 %) for recurrent RPS at initial presentation. 14 (61 %) received complete tumor resection, six (27 %) incomplete microscopic resection, and three (13 %) incomplete macroscopic resection. In univariate Cox’s proportional hazard model on time (‘timer’) to event (‘relapse’) analysis, all the variables like older age (p = 0.027), male sex (p = 0.012), incomplete resection (p = 0.008), large size (0.047) and high grade (p = 0.047) became significant predictor of early recurrence. However, multivariate analysis showed that only extent of resection, grade and sex were statistically significant predictors. Complete tumor resection of retroperitoneal sarcoma (n = 14) was associated with a significantly lesser recurrence compared with unclear resection (n = 9, p = 0.002). The median time between surgery and first recurrence was 15 months. High-grade sarcomas had a significantly higher recurrence (n = 10; median: 24, 95 % CI) than low-grade sarcomas (n = 13, median: 15; 95 %CI P < 0.01). Furthermore, the survival of male patients were worse than that of females (p = 0.036). Completeness of resection, tumor grade and sex are prognostic factors of retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcomas.
