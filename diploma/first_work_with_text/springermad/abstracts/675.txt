Quercetin, a flavonoid, has been reported to ameliorate cardiovascular diseases, such as cardiac hypertrophy. However, the mechanism is not completely understood. In this study, a mechanism related to proteasome-glycogen synthesis kinase 3 (GSK-3) was elucidated in rats and primary neonatal cardiomyocytes.
