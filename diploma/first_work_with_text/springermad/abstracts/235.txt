To investigate the impact of PLA2G7 polymorphism, and additional their interactions with smoking and drinking on coronary heart disease (CHD) risk based on Chinese population. GMDR model was used to screen the best gene–smoking and gene–drinking interaction combinations. Logistic regression was performed to investigate association between 4 SNPs and CHD, and the interaction effect between rs1805017 and smoking. For CHD patient–control haplotype analyses, the SHEsis online haplotype analysis software (http://analysis.bio-x.cn/myAnalysis.php) was employed. CHD risks were higher in carriers of homozygous mutant of rs1805017 and rs1805018 than those with wild-type homozygotes, OR (95% CI) were 1.45 (1.16–1.92) and 1.51 (1.23–1.97), respectively, but the other two SNPs, rs16874954 and rs1051931 were not significant associated with CHD risks. GMDR analysis indicated that there was a significant two-locus model (p = 0.0107) involving rs1805017 and smoking, indicating a potential gene–environment interaction between rs1805017 and smoking. But we did not found any gene–drinking and gene–gene interaction combinations in GMDR models. The haplotype R-I was observed most frequently in two groups, with 47.43 and 54.38% in the case and control group of the population, respectively. The results also indicated that the haplotype containing the rs1805017-H and rs1805018-T alleles were associated with a statistically increased CHD risk, OR (95% CI) 1.43 (1.10–1.86), p = 0.0021. Polymorphisms in rs1805017 and rs1805018, additional interaction between rs1805017 and smoking, and haplotype containing the rs1805017-H and rs1805018-T alleles were associated with increased CHD risk.
