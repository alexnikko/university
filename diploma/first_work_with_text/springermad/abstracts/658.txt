Mechanical stretch increases sodium and calcium entry into myocytes and activates the late sodium current. GS967, a triazolopyridine derivative, is a sodium channel blocker with preferential effects on the late sodium current. The present study evaluates whether GS967 inhibits or modulates the arrhythmogenic electrophysiological effects of myocardial stretch.
