Hypocretins are hypothalamic neuropeptides acting on the regulation of several physiological functions, the most important being the control of arousal. Hypocretin 1 and hypocretin 2 are derived from the same precursor and both bind to the orexin receptors. The hypocretinergic system has been a target of several studies that try to understand its function on the regulation of mood and behavior. The hypocretinergic system has a direct relationship with the pathways related to emotions and reward system, besides the interaction with the stress circuit. This article aims to analyze the relationship of hypocretins with anxiety, stress and depression, through a review of the existing literature.
