Heat shock cognate protein 70 (Hsc70) is a key mediator for the maintenance of intracellular proteins and regulates cellular activities. And it is elevated in various tumor tissues including glioma, which is closely related to the malignancy and poor prognosis of the tumors. However, the effects of Hsc70 on gliomas and its regulatory mechanism have not yet been elucidated. In the present study, we found that Hsc70 was overexpressed in glioma tissues and cultured glioma cells. Furthermore, Hsc70 expression exhibited positive correlation with the grades of gliomas. Knockdown of Hsc70 could effectively inhibit cell proliferation and increase cell apoptosis. Furthermore, we identified that β4GalT5 was a critical target for Hsc70-mediated anti-glioma effects. Blocking β4GalT5 activity could effectively reverse the anti-tumor effect of Hsc70. Taken together, these data indicate that Hsc70 regulates β4GalT5 levels, and possibly plays a role in cell proliferation and apoptosis of glioma.
