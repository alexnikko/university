The average adult stands approximately 50–60 times per day. Cardiovascular responses evoked during the first 3 min of active standing provide a simple means to clinically assess short-term neural and cardiovascular function across the lifespan. Clinically, this response is used to identify the haemodynamic correlates of patient symptoms and attributable causes of (pre-)syncope, and to detect autonomic dysfunction, variants of orthostatic hypotension, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome and orthostatic hypertension.
