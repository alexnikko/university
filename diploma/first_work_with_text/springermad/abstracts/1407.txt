We recently engaged in a two-part study of Clinostomum Leidy, 1856 across a geographic range comprising central Mexico southwards to Costa Rica, in Central America. In the first study, we investigated the species boundaries by using DNA sequences of mitochondrial and nuclear molecular markers, implementing several analytical tools and species delimitation methods. The result of that approach revealed five highly divergent genetic lineages that were interpreted as independent evolutionary units, or species. Here, we present the second part of the study, where we describe three of the five species for which we have sexually mature adult specimens obtained from the mouth cavity of fish-eating birds. Additionally, we characterise morphologically the metacercariae of the other two species, collected from freshwater fishes; these species cannot be formally described since no adults were found in their definitive hosts. We further discuss the characters that are more reliable for species identification within Clinostomum, such as the cirrus sac shape and relative position with respect to testes and ovary, the shape of the reproductive organs, and the diverticulated condition of the caeca.
