Despite ischemic stroke being the fifth leading cause of death in the USA, there are few therapeutic options available. We recently showed that the neuroprotective compound P7C3-A20 reduced brain atrophy, increased neurogenesis, and improved functional recovery when treatment was initiated immediately post-reperfusion after a 90-min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). In the present study, we investigated a more clinically relevant therapeutic window for P7C3-A20 treatment after ischemic stroke. MCAO rats were administered P7C3-A20 for 1 week, beginning immediately or at a delayed point, 6 h post-reperfusion. Delayed P7C3-A20 treatment significantly improved stroke-induced sensorimotor deficits in motor coordination and symmetry, as well as cognitive deficits in hippocampal-dependent spatial learning, memory retention, and working memory. In the cerebral cortex, delayed P7C3-A20 treatment significantly increased tissue sparing 7 weeks after stroke and reduced hemispheric infarct volumes 48 h after reperfusion. Despite no reduction in striatal infarct volumes acutely, there was a significant increase in spared tissue volume chronically. In the hippocampus, only immediately treated P7C3-A20 animals had a significant increase in tissue sparing compared to vehicle-treated stroke animals. This structural protection translated into minimal hippocampal-dependent behavioral improvements with delayed P7C3-A20 treatment. However, all rats treated with delayed P7C3-A20 demonstrated a significant improvement in both sensorimotor tasks compared to vehicle controls, suggesting a somatosensory-driven recovery. These results demonstrate that P7C3-A20 improves chronic functional and histopathological outcomes after ischemic stroke with an extended therapeutic window.
