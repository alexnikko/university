Breast conservation surgery (BCS) is now the standard of care for patients with early breast cancer. The main contraindications for BCS besides the presence of multicentricity and diffuse microcalcifications are inadequate tumour size to breast size ratio. With the advent of oncoplastic techniques, the indications of BCS may be further extended to patient with larger tumour size and or small volume breast. We prospectively assessed 42 patients undergoing oncoplastic breast conservation surgery for cosmetic and oncologic outcomes. Cosmetic outcome assessment was done by comparison of operated breast to contralateral breast by an independent surgeon, nurse and patient’s attendant at 6 months post-surgery. Risk factors for compromised oncologic outcomes included grades II/III tumours and non-ductal histology. Intraoperative margin assessment with frozen section analysis proved to be important in order to achieve negative surgical margins on final histopathology. By univariate analysis, tumours located in central quadrant and medial half of the breast had similar cosmetic outcomes comparable to tumours located in other quadrants. Majority of our patients (90%) had overall good to excellent cosmetic outcomes on Harvard scale. Oncoplastic breast conservation surgery techniques allow for larger parenchymal resections without compromising oncologic and cosmetic results. It further allows extension of BCS to patients otherwise denied for the same based on earlier recommendations for mastectomy. Oncoplastic techniques and intraoperative margin assessment with frozen section are vital in attaining adequate margins and also decrease chance of local recurrence and revision surgery for positive margins.
