Multiple antigen miniarrays used for detecting autoantibodies to tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) can be a useful approach for cancer detection and diagnosis. We here address a very specific question: might there be autoimmune responses to TAAs which precede clinical detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in HBV and HCV chronic liver disease patients under continuous medical surveillance, and if so, could these anti-TAAs be added to the armamentarium of diagnostic tests?
