The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of sensitivity encoding on the quantitative assessment of cardiac motion in black blood cine tissue phase mapping (TPM) sequences. Up to now whole volume coverage of the heart is still limited by the long acquisition times. Therefore, a significant increase in imaging speed without deterioration of quantitative motion information is indispensable.
