Cardiac amyloidosis is a manifestation of one of several systemic amyloidoses, and is characterized by increased left-ventricular (LV) wall thickness and normal or decreased LV cavity size. Congestive heart failure in cardiac amyloidosis is characterized by a predominant diastolic LV dysfunction, and systolic dysfunction occurs only in late-stage disease. Echocardiography is a noninvasive, reproducible method for assessing cardiac morphology and function in cardiac amyloidosis, and some echocardiographic indices are prognostic for amyloidoses. This review describes the advances in echocardiography and its role in the diagnosis and management of cardiac amyloidoses. Our review suggests that LV longitudinal function and the cyclic variation of myocardial integrated backscatter may be the best predictors of adverse outcomes. In the future, new echocardiographic techniques, such as fully automated echocardiogram interpretation, should provide further useful information for assessing cardiac function and prognosis in cardiac amyloidosis patients.
