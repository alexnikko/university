Angiogenesis plays a crucial role in development, wound healing as well as tumour growth and metastasis. Although the general implication of the cytoskeleton in angiogenesis has been partially unravelled, little is known about the specific role of actin isoforms in this process. Herein, we aimed at deciphering the function of Î³-actin in angiogenesis.
