The microencapsulation of plasticizing molecules, such as 4-methoxy chalcone (4MC), can raise serious stability issues in microparticle (MP) manufacturing and storage, especially when employing low glassy pseudo-plastic polymers, such as polylactides (PLA) and polylactide-co-glycolides (PLGA). In this work, two distinct steps were undertaken: (1) the study of the effect on manufacturing and storage of 4MC loading in polyester MP and (2) the investigation of a new stabilization strategy based on 4MC intercalation into a stearate-modified hydrotalcite (sHTC).
