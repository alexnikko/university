Cyclic-vomiting syndrome (CVS) is a chronic functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of nausea and vomiting. Although once thought to be a pediatric disorder, there has been a considerable increase in recognition of CVS in adults. The exact pathogenesis is unknown and several theories have been proposed. Migraine and CVS share a similar pathophysiology as suggested by several studies. Since there are no specific biomarkers available for this disorder, physicians should rely on Rome criteria for the diagnosis. Due to the lack of randomized control trials, the treatment of CVS is primarily empirical.
