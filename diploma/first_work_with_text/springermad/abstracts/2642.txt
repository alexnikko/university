Intramuscular administration of ketamine-midazolam was used as a fast-acting chemical restraint, with convenient use of the drug in domestic cats. Furthermore, biochemical and hematological changes were evaluated following administration. A total of 20 clinically healthy cats were selected. During the physical examination, cephalic vein was prepared aseptically. Then, cats were restrained cautiously and intravenous catheter was placed in the cephalic vein and immediately heparinized. After covering and protecting the catheter, the animals were kept in separate cages for half an hour. Subsequently, the first blood samples were obtained before intramuscular injection of combination of ketamine and midazolam. The intervals between injection and animal sedation were recorded and the second blood samples were taken. Results showed that the interval between intramuscular injection compound and clinical sedation, the time of second sampling, was 6 ± 2.12 (mean ± SD) min and cat’s recovery time and the time of returning to full power, consciousness, and ability to move and balance were recorded 19 ± 5.35 (mean ± SD) min. Also, values of blood-biochemical parameters were measured before and after administration of the ketamine-midazolam combination and implications on the effect of subsequent administration of the compound on the RBC count, hemoglobin values, PCV, WBC count, lymphocyte percentile, and glucose levels which were found to be significantly reduced (P < 0.05). It seemed that using a combination of ketamine-midazolam could well be tolerated in restraining cats without clinical complications. Following administration of this combination, a short time induction of clinical sedation is a valuable finding that may help to discharge clinical cases without undue delay.
