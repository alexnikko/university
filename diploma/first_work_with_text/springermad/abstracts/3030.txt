Recently, the genetic alterations associated with tumor progression and impaired host immunity against transformed cells draw increased attention. Here, we characterized the differential gene expression patterns and protein expression in tumor-free lymph node from recurrent and non-recurrent tumors to identify independent prognostic markers for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).
