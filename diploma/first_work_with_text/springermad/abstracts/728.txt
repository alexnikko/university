Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a primary immunodeficiency for which allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) offers potential cure. Direct comparison of HSCT to non-HSCT management in the North American population was performed to identify clinical factors associated with overall survival (OS) and transplant-related survival (TRS).
