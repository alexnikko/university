B7-H6 is a ligand of NKp30, which is an activating receptor of natural killer (NK) cells. High expression of B7-H6 is found in certain types of tumor cells, such as lymphoma, leukemia and gastric carcinoma. The expression of B7-H6 can be induced by inflammatory stress in healthy cells. The expression of B7-H6 is significantly correlated with distant metastasis status and post-operative prognosis in cancer patients. The effectiveness of B7-H6 modified antitumor immunotherapy strategies had been verified in tumor-bearing mice, which opened a new door to targeted therapy. In this review, we will focus on the recent development on the roles of B7-H6 in tumor immunity, as well as mechanisms involved in the regulation of B7-H6 expression.
