This study aims to explore the association between functional health literacy and awareness for, beliefs, and attitudes of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) and CRC screening test in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A total of 256 participants from two different tertiary level hospitals in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia were recruited in this study. The participants were interviewed by a trained researcher between October and December 2015. All respondents answered a three-part questionnaire which included demographic data, questions related to CRC awareness, attitude, behaviour, and short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (STOFHLA). More than half of the participants had an inadequate awareness of functional health literacy skills (FHLS), 16.4 % had marginal of FHLS awareness and 17.6 % had adequate awareness about FHLS as assessed by the STOFHLA. Overall, the majority of the participants in both marginal and adequate aware groups showed a limited awareness about colorectal cancer screening and testing. A significant association was found on awareness of the patients about frequencies that they should have been tested for colorectal cancer and functional health literacy. No significant association was found between functional health literacy as assessed by STOFHLA and concerns of Faecal Occult Blood Test (FOBT) (p = 0.384) and sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy might cause embarrassment (p = 0.089), harm (p = 0.917), and pain (p = 0.849). The present study revealed a low level of health literacy among Saudi adults in Riyadh region. Although the level of literacy was low, the bigger concern is that of the poor awareness and beliefs of Saudi adults about CRC and CRC screening.
