STING is a newly identified adaptor protein for sensing cytosolic nucleic acid. It is well established that STING plays a crucial role in innate immune response via inducing production of type I IFN. Emerging evidence suggests that the activation of STING-dependent signaling is also implicated in the process of cell death, such as apoptosis, pyroptosis, necroptosis, and autophagy. Of note, the pro-death outcome is even predominant in certain cell types, like lymphocytes, myeloid cells, and hepatocytes. Given that STING agonists are being tested for enhancing antitumor immune responses, it is necessary to fully understand the outcome of STING activation. The anti-microorganism response mediated by STING has been well described; therefore, we focus on the role of STING-dependent signaling on cell death in this review.
