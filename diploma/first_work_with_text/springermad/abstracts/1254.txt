Nearly 40% of men and women will be diagnosed with cancer during their lifetime. Thus, there is a rapidly growing need for novel therapies to combat this deadly disease. One such method is the consumption of blueberries. Long coveted for their powerful antioxidant properties, more recent studies have demonstrated that blueberries also exhibit inherent abilities to prevent carcinogenesis, inhibit the proliferation of neoplastic cells, and reduce the risks of recurrence in patients in remission. This review will focus on the specific activities of blueberry derivatives in cancer cells across many different forms of cancer. Ultimately, such research could be helpful in the development of new strategies to treat cancer.
