There is little information on the dynamics of BDNF in the CSF in the continuum between healthy aging, MCI and AD. We included 128 older adults (77 with amnestic MCI, 26 with AD and 25 healthy controls). CSF BDNF level was measured by ELISA assay, and AD biomarkers (Aβ42, T-Tau and P-Tau181) were measured using a Luminex xMAP assay. CSF BDNF levels were significantly reduced in AD subjects compared to MCI and healthy controls (p = 0.009). Logistic regression models showed that lower CSF BDNF levels (p = 0.008), lower CSF Aβ42 (p = 0.005) and lower MMSE scores (p = 0.007) are significantly associated with progression from MCI to AD. The present study adds strong evidence of the involvement of BDNF in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative changes in AD. Interventions aiming to restore central neurotrophic support may represent future therapeutic targets to prevent or delay the progression from MCI to AD.
