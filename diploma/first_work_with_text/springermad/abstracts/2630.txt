Malaria, a disease caused by a parasitic protozoan belonging to the genus Plasmodium spp., is one of the common diseases in the tropical regions. Our aim in this study is to examine the effects of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, pyrimethamine, and hydroxychloroquine sulfate on the liver, spleen, and kidneys of treated mice with Plasmodium berghei. Mice were divided into five groups, of which three were infected with the parasite and treated with the aforementioned drugs. The other two groups were considered as negative (non-infected) and positive (infected) controls. The histopathological changes in the spleen among the different groups were observed and the highest change was in the pyrimethamine group. Prescribing these medications are necessary, especially for people who take these drugs in the long term, since these drugs may cause severe adverse effects.
