The mycotoxin citrinin (CIT) deserves attention due to its known toxic effects in mammalian species and a widespread occurrence in food commodities, often along with ochratoxin A, another nephrotoxic mycotoxin. Human exposure, a key element in assessing risks related to these food contaminants, depends upon mycotoxin levels in food and on food consumption. Yet, data available for CIT levels in food are insufficient for reliable intake estimates. Now biomonitoring, i.e., analysis of parent compound and/or metabolites in human specimen (blood, urine, breast milk), is increasingly used to investigate mycotoxin exposure. Biomonitoring requires sensitive methods for determining biomarkers of exposure, combined with kinetic data to conclude on the absorbed internal dose in an individual. Recent advances in LC–MS/MS-based analytical techniques have facilitated biomonitoring studies on the occurrence of CIT biomarkers in body fluids, mainly in urine samples. This review compiles evidence on human exposure to CIT in different countries, on CIT kinetics in humans, and on biomarker-based CIT intake estimates. Human CIT exposures are discussed in light of an intake value defined as ‘level of no concern for nephrotoxicity’ by the European Food Safety Agency, and some uncertainties in the toxicological data base. Further studies on CIT, including biomarker-based studies are warranted along with regular food surveys for this mycotoxin to protect consumers against undesirable health effects.
