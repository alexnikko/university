Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global health problem and is independently associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The presence and severity of CKD is strongly related to the progression of coronary atherosclerosis, ventricular hypertrophy, myocardial fibrosis, valvular calcification, and cardiac conduction system abnormalities. Echocardiography plays a major role in the assessment of structural and functional cardiac abnormalities in CKD including abnormal left-ventricular (LV) geometry, LV diastolic dysfunction, valvular disease, and left atrial dilatation, which are very frequently present especially in patients with end-stage renal disease.
