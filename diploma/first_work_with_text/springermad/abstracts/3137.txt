Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death among all gynecological malignancies in developed countries. Eighty to ninety percent of ovarian cancers are epithelial, and more than two-thirds are diagnosed at an advanced stage. The current standard of management for a patient with advanced (stage III or IV) ovarian cancer is cytoreductive surgery followed by administration of systemic chemotherapy. Recently, the efficiency of “neoadjuvant chemotherapy” in ovarian cancer treatment has been widely discussed.
