The study was descriptively conducted to determine incidence of green muscle disease (Oregon disease) in slaughtered broiler chickens from west of Iran. During the study, five million broiler chickens were slaughtered out of which 29,255 (0.53 %) carcasses were condemned. Almost 1850 (0.033 %) carcasses were diagnosed with green muscle disease. The lowest and highest rate of the disease were seen in August (6.6 %) and February (14.2 %), respectively. There were significant relationships between chicken’s age, weight, and occurrence of the disease (P < 0.05). However, no relationship was found between ration and the disease. The results indicated that a good management program could control occurrence of the disease and prevent economic losses. Of course, no viral or bacterial agents are to be blamed for this disease; therefore, it is not problematic for public health.
