The present research was carried out to investigate the influence of mumie aqueous extract on aspirin-induced gastric lesions in rats. Thirty-eight male animals were grouped as the following: Normal control received 1 ml normal saline; positive control received 1 ml normal saline; standard control received omeprazole (20 mg/kg); treatment received mumie (600 mg/kg). After 1 h all the rats (except the normal control group) were given 500 mg/kg aspirin to induce lesions. Four hours after lesion induction, the gastric injuries were assessed through the evaluation of the macroscopic appearance of lesions, histopathology, and parameters including malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), glutathione reductase (GR), and catalase in the gastric tissue homogenate. The gastric lesion area and number significantly decreased in mumie and omeprazole groups compared to the positive control group, which histopathologically showed decrease of mucosal damage, edema, and leukocyte infiltration. A significant increase in oxidative enzyme levels with a reduction in MDA concentration was seen in rats of mumie and omeprazole groups compared to the positive control group. The preventive effect of the mumie aqueous extract was comparable to that of omeprazole. These findings demonstrated the protective effects of mumie against aspirin-induced gastric lesions.
