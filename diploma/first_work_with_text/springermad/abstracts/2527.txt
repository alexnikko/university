The role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of phenylketonuria (PKU)-associated disorders has been implicated. Ischemia modified albumin (IMA) is a modified form of serum albumin, which is produced under the conditions of oxidative stress. The aim of this study was to measure the serum level of IMA in the PKU patients and to investigate its ability in predicting the status of oxidative stress in these patients. Fifty treated-PKU patients and fifty age- and sex-matched healthy subjects were included in the study. The blood samples were obtained and the serum level of phenylalanine (Phe) was measured using reverse phase HPLC method. The levels of IMA, malondialdehyde (MDA), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) activity, and uric acid (UA) were determined using colorimetric methods. The levels of serum Phe, IMA, and MDA were significantly higher (p < 0.001) and the level of UA (p < 0.05) was lower in the PKU patients compared to control group. Serum IMA level was positively correlated with MDA (r = 0.585, p < 0.001) and UA (r = 0.6, p < 0.001). An inverse relationship was observed between the serum level of IMA and Phe (r = − 0.410, p < 0. 01). Results of the present study suggest that serum IMA level could be used as a novel marker for the evaluation of oxidative stress in the PKU patients.
