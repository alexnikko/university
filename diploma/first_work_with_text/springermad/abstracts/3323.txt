Arsenic trioxide (ATO) is among the first-line chemotherapeutic drugs used in oncological practice. It has shown substantial efficacy in treating patients with relapsed or refractory acute promyelocytic leukaemia. The clinical use of ATO is hampered due to cardiotoxicityÂ and hence many patients are precluded from receiving this highly effective treatment. An alternative to this would be to use any drug that can ameliorate the cardiotoxic effects and allow exploiting the full therapeutic potential of ATO, with considerable impact on cancer therapy. Generation of reactive oxygen species is involved in a wide range of human diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular, pulmonary and neurological disorders. Hence, agents with the ability to protect against these reactive species may be therapeutically useful. The present review focuses on the beneficial as well as harmful effects of arsenic and ATO, the mechanisms underlying ATO toxicity and the possible ways that can be adopted to circumvent ATO-induced toxicity.
