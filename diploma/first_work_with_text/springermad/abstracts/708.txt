Abdominal superficial surgical incision elicits cardioprotection against myocardial ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury in mice. This cardioprotective phenomenon, termed remote preconditioning of trauma (RPCT), results in an 80 to 85Â % reduction in cardiac infarct size. We evaluated cardioprotection and the molecular mechanisms of remote postconditioning of trauma (RPostCT) in a murine I/R injury model.
