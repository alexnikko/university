Mutations in RAB18, a member of small G protein, cause Warburg micro syndrome (WARBM), whose clinical features include vision impairment, postnatal microcephaly, and lower limb spasticity. Previously, our Rab18−/− mice exhibited hind limb weakness and spasticity as well as signs of axonal degeneration in the spinal cord and lumbar spinal nerves. However, the cellular and molecular function of RAB18 and its roles in the pathogenesis of WARBM are still not fully understood. Using immunofluorescence staining and expression of Rab18 and organelle markers, we find that Rab18 associates with lysosomes and actively traffics along neurites in cultured neurons. Interestingly, Rab18−/− neurons exhibit impaired lysosomal transport. Using autophagosome marker LC3-II, we show that Rab18 dysfunction leads to aberrant autophagy activities in neurons. Electron microscopy further reveals accumulation of lipofuscin-like granules in the dorsal root ganglion of Rab18−/− mice. Surprisingly, Rab18 colocalizes, cofractionates, and coprecipitates with the lysosomal regulator Rab7, mutations of which cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) neuropathy type 2B. Moreover, Rab7 is upregulated in Rab18-deficient neurons, suggesting a compensatory effect. Together, our results suggest that the functions of RAB18 and RAB7 in lysosomal and autophagic activities may constitute an overlapping mechanism underlying WARBM and CMT pathogenesis in the nervous system.
