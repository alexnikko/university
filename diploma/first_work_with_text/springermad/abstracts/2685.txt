Cancer immunotherapy has greatly advanced in recent years. Most immunotherapeutic strategies are based on the use of immune checkpoint blockade to unleash antitumor immune responses or on the induction or adoptive transfer of immune effector cells. We aim to develop therapeutic vaccines based on recombinant Semliki Forest virus vectors to induce tumor-specific effector immune cells. In this review, we describe our ongoing work on SFV-based vaccines targeted against human papillomavirus- and hepatitis C virus-related infections and malignancies, focusing on design, delivery, combination strategies, preclinical efficacy and product development for a first-in-man clinical trial with an HPV-specific vaccine.
