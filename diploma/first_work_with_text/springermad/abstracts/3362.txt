Lead (Pb) induces adverse effects when it chronically accumulates in the body, including effects on the nervous and cardiovascular systems. Wistar rats were exposed to lead acetate for 30 days (first dose 4 µg/100 g followed by 0.05 µg/100 g/day, i.m.) to investigate the cardiovascular system impact on the autonomic control. The femoral artery and vein were catheterised to perform hemodynamic evaluations in awake rats: heart rate variability (HRV), baroreflex sensitivity, cardiopulmonary reflex and hemodynamic responses to vagal and sympathetic pharmacological blockade. Rats exposed to Pb exhibited a higher blood pressure and reduced HRV in the time domain when compared to the saline-injected group. Spectral analysis of the HRV in the frequency-domain showed an augmented low-frequency component of the spectrum. Methylatropine and atenolol administration suggest increased sympathetic tone and reduced vagal tone on the control of heart rate. Chronic Pb exposure decreased the sensitivity of the baroreflex without significantly changing the cardiopulmonary reflex. This study demonstrated for the first time in an animal model of a controlled, low-dose chronic lead exposure that cardiovascular changes, such as arterial hypertension, are accompanied by impaired autonomic control of the cardiovascular system, as characterised by reduced baroreflex sensitivity and a sympathovagal imbalance.
