Accurate prediction of sudden cardiac death due to ventricular arrhythmia remains challenging. Left ventricular ejection fraction has shown an association with increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias and is included in the recommendations for implantable cardioverter defibrillator as primary prevention. However, left ventricular ejection fraction may be normal in a large number of patients who are at risk of ventricular arrhythmias. Echocardiography remains the imaging technique of first choice to rule out the presence of structural heart disease and assess left and right ventricular function. Advances in strain echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance have provided important insights into the mechanisms of ventricular arrhythmias, and will be summarized in this review.
