The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the 30-days safety (bleeding and vascular events) and efficacy (reduction in major stroke, myocardial infarction and mortality) of single anti-platelet (SAPT) versus dual anti-platelet (DAPT) after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). We used a meta-analytic method with Mantel–Haenszel methods to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Only randomized clinical trials that compared 30-days safety and efficacy based on Valve Academic Research Consortium criteria were included. Studies that included patients on anticoagulants were excluded. Our analysis included three studies with a total of 421 patients (210 SAPT and 211 DAPT). Life-threatening and major bleeding as well as major vascular complications was similar between SAPT and DAPT. Similarly, major stroke, myocardial infarction and mortality was also comparable between the two groups. The combined outcomes of 30-day mortality, life-threatening and major bleeding showed tendency toward lower event rates in SAPT compared to DAPT (9.5 vs. 15.6%, OR 0.57; 95% CI 0.31–1.03, p = 0.06). In conclusion, SAPT provided similar safety without adding incremental efficacy compared to DAPT but showed tendency of lower combined endpoints of 30-day mortality, life-threatening and major bleeding.
