Arterial stiffness is an inevitable consequence of the aging process and is considered an early stage in the development of cardiovascular diseases. The perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) is a distinct functional integral layer of the vasculature actively involved in blood pressure regulation and atherosclerosis development via PVAT-derived paracrine/autocrine factors. However, there is little knowledge regarding the relationship between PVAT and arterial stiffness.
