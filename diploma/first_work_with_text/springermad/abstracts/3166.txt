As the pharmaceutical industry increasingly adopts continuous manufacturing technology, significant attention must be paid to process analytical technology (PAT), process integration, and process control. Published information is no substitute for hands-on comprehensive training, which is critical to implementing and operating continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing systems effectively and efficiently. In this article, an intensive hands-on training course has been developed and implemented at the Engineering Research Center for Structured Organic Particulate Systems (C-SOPS) based on 15Â years of experience and several implemented systems. Here, we brought the details of the four integral components in a continuous direct compression manufacturing process: (1) unit operations, (2) PAT, (3) modeling and process controls, and (4) material characterization. Each section built-in classroom lectures with a brief overview on the theoretical aspects of each topic, followed by a hands-on session covering the classroom theory. The training program is described here in sufficient detail to enable creation of similar programs at other institutions.
