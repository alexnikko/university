Glenoid version angles are measured to objectively follow changes related to glenohumeral dysplasia in the setting of brachial plexus birth palsy. Measuring glenoid version on cross-sectional imaging was initially described by Friedman et al. in 1992. Recent literature for non-dysplastic shoulders advocates time-consuming reconstructions and reformations for an accurate assessment of glenoid version.
