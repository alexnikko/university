There is still uncertainty about the optimal usage of thrombolysis for acute pulmonary embolisms (PEs), leading to a widely varying usage in the real world. The COMMAND VTE Registry is a multicenter retrospective registry enrolling consecutive patients with acute symptomatic venous thromboembolisms (VTEs) in Japan. The present study population consisted of 1549 patients with PEs treated with tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) thrombolysis (N = 180, 12%) or without thrombolysis (N = 1369). Thrombolysis with t-PA was implemented in 33% of patients with severe PEs, and 9.2% of patients with mild PEs with a wide variation across the participating centers. Patients with t-PA thrombolysis were younger, and less frequently had active cancer, history of major bleeding, and anemia. At 30 days, t-PA thrombolysis as compared to no thrombolysis was associated with similar mortality rates (5.0% vs. 6.9%, P = 0.33), but a lower adjusted mortality risk (OR 0.41; 95% CI 0.18–0.90, P = 0.03), while it was associated with a trend for higher rates of major bleeding (5.6% vs. 2.9%, P = 0.06) and a significantly higher adjusted risk for major bleeding (OR 2.39; 95% CI 1.06–5.36, P = 0.03). In patients with severe PEs, the mortality rates at 30 days were significantly lower in the t-PA thrombolysis group than no thrombolysis group (15% vs. 37%, P = 0.006). In the present real-world VTE registry in Japan, t-PA thrombolysis was not infrequently implemented, not only in patients with severe PEs, but also in patients with mild PEs. A substantial mortality risk reduction might be suggested with t-PA thrombolysis in patients with severe PEs.
