Laryngeal preservation is an important consideration when treating cervical esophageal cancers (CECs) such as laryngeal cancer. The standard treatment for CEC allowing laryngeal preservation is chemoradiotherapy. However, in cases of laryngeal cancer, chemoselection has also been applied as a treatment strategy that promotes larynx preservation. This strategy involves assigning the appropriate radical treatment according to the primary tumorâ€™s response to induction chemotherapy. Since there have been no studies of the application of chemoselection in CEC cases, the present study compared the results, including laryngeal preservation rates, obtained upon applying chemoselection and chemoradiotherapy to CEC.
