The administration of antiplatelet drugs before coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) is associated with an increased risk of major hemorrhage and related surgical reexploration.

We evaluated the associated risk between the combined use of aspirin and clopidogrel and the transfusion of blood products perioperatively.
