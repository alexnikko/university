Angina is the most frequent initial and subsequent manifestation of ischemic heart disease in women. Women with stable ischemic heart disease have a more diverse symptom presentation than men, with prominent anginal equivalents; symptoms are more often precipitated by emotional or mental stress. Women, especially at younger age, whose acute myocardial infarction presentation is without chest pain have higher mortality rates than men without chest pain.
