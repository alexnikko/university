It is now recognized that solid tumors encroach on the hostâ€™s immune microenvironment to favor its own proliferation. Strategies to enhance the specificity of the endogenous T-cell population against tumors have been met with limited clinical success. We aimed to devise a two-tier protocol coupling in vivo whole antigen priming with ex vivo cellular expansion to clinically evaluate survival in patients following re-infusion of primed, autologous T cells, thereby determining treatment efficacy.
