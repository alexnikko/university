CARD9 deficiency is an inborn error of immunity that predisposes otherwise healthy humans to mucocutaneous and invasive fungal infections, mostly caused by Candida, but also by dermatophytes, Aspergillus, and other fungi. Phaeohyphomycosis are an emerging group of fungal infections caused by dematiaceous fungi (phaeohyphomycetes) and are being increasingly identified in patients with CARD9 deficiency. The Corynespora genus belongs to phaeohyphomycetes and only one adult patient with CARD9 deficiency has been reported to suffer from invasive disease caused by C. cassiicola. We identified a Colombian child with an early-onset, deep, and destructive mucocutaneous infection due to C. cassiicola and we searched for mutations in CARD9.
