Potentially fatal intracranial pressure (ICP) rises commonly occur after large intracerebral hemorrhages (ICH). We monitored ICP after infusing 100–160 μL of autologous blood (vs. 0 μL control) into the striatum of rats in order to test the validity of this common model with regard to ICP elevations. Other endpoints included body temperature, behavioral impairment, lesion volume, and edema. Also, we evaluated hippocampal CA1 sector and somatosensory cortical neuron morphology to assess whether global ischemic injury occurred. Despite massive blood infusions, ICP only modestly increased (160 μL 10.8 ± 2.1 mmHg for <36 h vs. control 3.4 ± 0.5 mmHg), with little peri-hematoma edema at 3 days. Body temperature was not affected. Behavioral deficits and tissue loss were infusion volume-dependent. There was no histological evidence of hippocampal or cortical injury, indicating that cell death was confined to the hematoma and closely surrounding tissue. Surprisingly, the most severe hemorrhages significantly increased cell density (~15–20%) and reduced cell body size (~30%) in regions outside the injury site. Additionally, decreased cell size and increased density were observed after collagenase-induced ICH. Parenchymal volume is seemingly reduced after large ICH. Thus, in addition to well-known compliance mechanisms (e.g., displacement of cerebrospinal fluid and cerebral blood), reduced brain parenchymal volume appears to limit ICP rises in rodents with very large mass lesions.
