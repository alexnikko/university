Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease (MSMD) is a rare primary immunodeficiency, triggered by non-tuberculous mycobacteria or Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccines and characterized by severe diseases. All known genetic etiologies are inborn errors of IFN-γ-mediated immunity. Here, we report the molecular, cellular, and clinical features of patients from 15 Iranian families with disseminated disease without vaccination (2 patients) or following live BCG vaccination (14 patients).
