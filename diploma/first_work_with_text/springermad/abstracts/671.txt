Sodium-dependent glucose transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, which are anti-diabetic drugs, reportedly decrease the incidence of cardiovascular events in high-risk patients with cardiovascular diseases, and thus chronic heart failure (CHF). SGLT-2 inhibitors also decrease albuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Since albuminuria is a biomarker of not only chronic kidney disease but also cardiovascular events, we hypothesized that, among T2D patients with CHF, SGLT-2 inhibitors will decrease the extent of albuminuria and also improve CHF concomitantly.
