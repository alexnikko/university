The surgical treatment of bladder cancer is the curative treatment especially in early cases. In this study, our aim was to assess the outcome of preservation of internal genital organs in selected females both oncologically and functionally, and to assess the feasibility of technique and its complication. 24 females with clinically and radiologically diagnosed T2 bladder cancer underwent gynecologic-tract sparing cystectomy (GTSC). Age ranged from 45 to 60 years. Patients with diffuse carcinoma-in-situ, those with tumors involving the bladder neck, those with poor general condition and those with preoperative incontinence were excluded. 1 patient, who developed local recurrence after 6 months. One patient lost follow up after 15 months. No recurrence developed in the retained genital organs. The remaining 20 patients remained free of disease. Among women who were eligible for functional evaluation, Daytime and nighttime continence were satisfactory in 21/22 (95.4 %) and in 20/22 (90.9 %) respectively. Chronic urinary retention, pouch-vaginal fistula was not noted. Most of patients showed superior Sexual Function index. Cystectomy with preservation of the internal genital organs is feasible in female with early, solitary or T2 bladder cancer with satisfactory functional and oncologic outcomes with proper case selection.
