Fabry disease resulting from a deficiency of α-galactosidase A leads to the accumulation of globotriaosylceramide in various organs. Because the disease is an X-linked recessive disorder, males tend to develop more symptoms and more severe symptoms than females. There are also some variants of Fabry disease, and cardiac variant (cardiac Fabry disease) has the dysfunctions only in heart. Cardiac manifestations in Fabry disease are initially symmetrical and concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, and later progressive cardiac dysfunction with localized thinning of the basal posterior wall. In recent years, enzyme replacement therapy has been performed as a treatment for Fabry disease, and the initiation of this therapy is expected before the cardiac fibrosis develops. Therefore, early diagnosis of Fabry disease is essential, and echocardiography is an indispensable tool for clinical practice of this disease. Then, it is necessary to remember this disease as a differential diagnosis when encountering unexplained left ventricular hypertrophy.
