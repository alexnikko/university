We aimed at evaluation of the clinicoepidemiologic data of patients with gastric carcinoma in the Egyptian Delta as regards the etiologic factors, behavior, presenting symptoms, and tumor location, grade, and stage with highlighting of the treatment modalities, survival, and prognostic factors. Three hundred cases with gastric carcinoma were enrolled, diagnosed, and treated in a tertiary oncology center in the Egyptian Delta. Data were collected as regards the etiology, presenting symptoms, family history, comorbid conditions, treatment modalities, responses, recurrences, and survival outcomes. Univariate and multivariate analyses were done to correlate the different clinicopathologic factors with the overall and disease-free survivals. Male to female ratio was 2:1. The median age was 43 years. The main tumor location was in the gastric body. Pain was the commonest presenting symptom (36%). Most of the cases were stage IV (42.0%). Only 49% of cases were operable. On multivariate analysis, age more than 60 years, performance status 3–4, high grade, diffuse type, T4 lesions, N2 and N3, and the presence of metastasis were independently associated with worse OS. We report a clinic-epidemiologic study of gastric carcinoma in the Egyptian delta; the age at presentation was a decade earlier than that recorded in the USA and Europe; most of the cases were sporadic, located mostly at the body. Most of the cases were presented at stage IV with poor response to neoadjuvant therapy with a poorer overall survival than that recorded in the USA and Europe.
