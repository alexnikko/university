A common approach to “Quality-by-Design” is to employ quality software(s) to characterize the impacts of input parameters on output-critical quality attributes. In this study, paclitaxel (PTX), a common chemotherapeutic agent, was loaded into poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs), and the coating process of chitosan (CS) onto PLGA NPs was focused for optimization.
