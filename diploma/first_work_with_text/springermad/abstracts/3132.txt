Klippel–Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) is a rare triad of congenital vascular malformations involving extensive port-wine stains, soft tissue or bone hypertrophy and underlying venous and/or lymphatic malformation affecting limb, pelvic or abdominal organs. Pregnancies with a hydatidiform mole and a live fetus are extremely rare, arising in about 1 in 20,000–1,00,000 pregnancies.
