Myocardial infarction (MI) is associated with high morbidity and mortality worldwide. This study aimed to explore the roles of resolvin D1 (RvD1), a metabolite of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, in protection against MI and investigate its influences on high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) and related molecular mechanisms.
