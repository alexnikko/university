The current study aimed to investigate the protective effects of coenzyme Q10 (Co Q10) and berberine (BB) with and without varicocelectomy on sperm parameters in postoperative varicocele rats. For the current purpose, a total of 60 mature male Wistar rats were randomly divided into control (n = 6 rats), control-sham (n = 6 rats), and experimental (n = 6 rats) groups. The animals in the experimental groups were undergone experimental varicocele, and simple laparotomy was performed in control-sham group. The experimental group was subdivided into the following groups 60 days after varicocele (VCL) induction: non-treated VCL-induced rats (n = 6 rats), VCL-induced rats administered 100 mg (kg per day) BB (n = 6 rats), VCL-induced rats administered Co Q10 75 mg (kg per day) (n = 6 rats), VCL-induced rats administered 100 mg (kg per day) BB + Co Q10 75 mg (kg per day) (n = 6 rats), varicocelectomy rats (n = 6 rats), varicocelectomy rats administered 100 mg (kg per day) BB (n = 6 rats), varicocelectomy rats administered Co Q10 75 mg (kg per day) (n = 6 rats), varicocelectomy rats administered 100 mg (kg per day) BB + Co Q10 75 mg (kg per day) (n = 6 rats). Following 60 days, the animals were euthanized and sperm parameters were evaluated. Non-treated VCL-induced animals indicated a significant (P < 0.05) decrease in sperm parameters and a significant (P < 0.05) increase in sperm DNA damage compared to control and control-sham groups. Insignificant changes were found between control and control-sham groups. Meanwhile, each treatment group showed a remarkable (P < 0.05) increase in sperm parameters as well as a significant (P < 0.05) decrease in sperm DNA damage. Based on current results, BB and Co Q10 alone and/or together could improve sperm parameters and reduce sperm DNA damage in varicocele-induced rats compared to control and control-sham groups. Varicocelectomy alone will improve sperm parameters, but this recovery will be greater when combined with Co Q10 and BB.
