Our understanding of prenatal morphogenesis of mammary glands has recently greatly advanced. This review focuses on morphogenesis proper, as well as cellular processes and tissue interactions involved in the progression of the embryonic mammary gland through sequential morphogenic stages in both the mouse and rabbit embryo. We provide a synthesis of both historical and more recent studies of embryonic mammary gland development, as well as arguments to revise old concepts about mechanisms of mammary line and rudiment formation. Finally, we highlight outstanding issues that remain to be addressed.
