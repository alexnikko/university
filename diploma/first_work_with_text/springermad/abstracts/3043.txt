Patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) have a high incidence of esophageal squamous cell neoplasms (ESCN). ESCN also has a negative impact on the survival of HNC patients. However, recent endoscopic advances enable the early detection of ESCN, and novel treatments may lead to improving survival rates for HNC patients with ESCN.
