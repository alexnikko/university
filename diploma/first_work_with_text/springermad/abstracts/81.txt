The usage of left-ventricular-assist device (LVAD) is increasing in patients presenting with advanced heart failure. However, device-related infections are a challenge to recognize and to treat, with an important morbidity and mortality rate. The role of nuclear medicine imaging remains not well established for LVAD infections. The present study compared the accuracy of positron emission tomography/computed tomography with 18F-fludeoxyglucose (18F-FDG PET/CT) and radiolabeled leucocyte scintigraphy for the diagnosis of infections in patients supported with a continuous-flow LVAD.
