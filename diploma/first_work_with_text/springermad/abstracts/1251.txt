To investigate the potential prognostic role of NFκB expression in primary high-grade non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Patients with primary high-grade non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer who received induction and maintenance BCG therapy were retrospectively included. Recurrence and progression were histologically proven. Intensity and extent of immunochemistry were assessed. The final evaluation of the NFκB staining was done by combining intensity and extent as ΄΄product΄΄ and expressing it as ΄΄low NFκΒ expression΄΄ or ΄΄high NFκB expression΄΄. Epidemiological, pathological, clinical parameters and NFκB expression were statistically analyzed for recurrence (REC), progression (PR), recurrence-free survival (RFS) and progression-free survival (PFS). NFκB is significantly associated with disease progression (p < 0,001 in univariate analysis and p = 0,001, Odds Ratio = 14,484, 95% Confidence Interval = 3187-65,821 in multivariate analysis), but not with recurrence. The median value of NFκB expression as ΄΄product΄΄ is significantly higher for the patients with progression in comparison to patients with recurrence only (p = 0,003) and patients without recurrence or progression (p = 0,001). Patients’ age is significantly associated (p = 0,001 in univariate analysis and p = 0,003, Odds Ratio = 1273, 95% Confidence Interval = 1086–1492 in multivariate analysis) with disease recurrence. High NFκB expression in primary high-grade non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, treated with postoperative intravesical BCG immunotherapy, could represent an unfavorable prognostic factor.
