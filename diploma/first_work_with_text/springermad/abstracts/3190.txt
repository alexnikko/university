The spores of Bacillus atrophaeus are used to monitor the efficacy of disinfection and sterilization processes, particularly in dry heat and ethylene oxide sterilization processes. The production process of biological sterilization indicators of this bacterium includes bacterial sporulation, which leads to a dormant structure with extreme resistance to heat stresses.
