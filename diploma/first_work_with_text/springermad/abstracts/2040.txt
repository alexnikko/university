Approximately, 16 million strokes occur worldwide each year, causing 6 million deaths and considerable disability, implying an enormous social, individual health, and economic burden. Due to this high incidence, strategies to promote stroke recovery are urgently needed. Research into new therapeutic approaches for stroke has determined that intravenous administration of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is a good strategy to improve recovery by amplifying mechanisms implicated in brain plasticity. Recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of MSCs in stroke, with no need for them to reach the area of brain injury. Although the mechanisms by which they mediate restorative effects are still unknown, the evidence suggests that MSCs might use specialised communication by sending and receiving biological information included in elements called exosomes. Exosomes are nanosized extracellular vesicles released into physical environments, and they have recently been suggested to mediate restorative stem cell effects. Moreover, after stroke, exosomes can also be synthesised and released from brain cells, passing through the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and can be detected in peripheral blood or in cerebrospinal fluid. Thus, exosomes could possibly be biomarkers that reflect pathological progress and promote stroke recovery. This review discusses the translational aspects of MSC-derived exosomes and their various roles in brain repair and as circulating biomarkers in stroke.
