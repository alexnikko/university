Performing pedicled TRAM in obese women carries risk of flap loss or native breast envelop necrosis. Our technique depends on performing total flap delay at the same setting with mastectomy with flap suture in situ to be followed 1 week later by flap transfer. This study included 24 operable women who were candidates for skin sparing or modified radical mastectomy. In one case, delay was only done and followed by mastectomy and flap transfer. In later experience, delay plus mastectomy was done first and followed later by flap transfer. Operative data and postoperative complications were recorded. The mean BMI was 37 ± 2.75. The mean total operative time was 200 ± 20.37. The mean total hospital stay was 9.1 ± 3.35 days. The mean total volume of blood loss was 380 ± 82.33 ml. Breast envelop necrosis was encountered in four cases; three of them were replaced by the TRAM skin. There was no total flap loss while partial loss was recorded in five cases. Fat necrosis occurred in eight cases. Most of mastectomy bed and abdominal complications were in average. Most of cases showed satisfactory esthetic outcome. Our new concept of “Interval TRAM” enables safe immediate breast reconstruction with pedicled TRAM in obese women and ensures presence of a skin pack up for the native breast envelop skin. We recommend this technique in every obese female who undergoes skin sparing mastectomy with immediate pedicled TRAM flap reconstruction.
