The human papillomavirus (HPV) is the major etiologic agent in the development of cervical cancer with known risk factors like immunosuppression. The natural history of HPV infection is altered in persons infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The persistent HPV infection increases their risk of having cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions (SILs). This study emphasizes on prevalence of high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) and correlation with cervical smears cytology in HIV-positive women regardless of treatment.
