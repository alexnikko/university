Caladium bicolor Aiton (Araceae) is used in ethnomedicine for the treatment of boils, wound ulcers and convulsion. This study investigated the effects of the leaf extracts on some neuropharmacological parameters. The leaves were collected, dried, powdered and then extracted by maceration in methanol to yield the whole extract (WE). Extraction was also done using n-hexane, ethyl acetate and methanol in a Soxhlet apparatus to obtain n-hexane (HE), ethyl acetate (EA) and methanol (ME) extracts. Preliminary phytochemical screening was done using the whole extract. Some neuropharmacological evaluations were carried out using standard methods. Phytochemical screening revealed the presence of carbohydrates, proteins, alkaloids and flavonoids. WE showed varying levels of protection against strychnine-induced convulsion. Each of HE, EA and ME increased latency (P < 0.01) to pentylenetetrazole-induced convulsion and offered varying levels of protection against maximal electroshock-induced seizure. Each of WE, HE and ME significantly increased the duration of stay on the open arm of the elevated plus maze. Both EA and ME at doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg, and HE at a dose of 400 mg/kg significantly reduced the duration of immobility in forced swim test. It is concluded that the leaf extracts possess anticonvulsant, anxiolytic and antidepressant properties.
