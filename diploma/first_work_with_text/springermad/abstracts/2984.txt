Forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) and paired box gene 3 (PAX3) have been reported to play an imported role in human cancers, but their role in cervical cancer has not yet been clarified. In this study, we evaluated the functional role of FOXO1 in cervical cancer cells and investigated the expression and clinical significance of FOXO1 and PAX3 in cervical lesions.
