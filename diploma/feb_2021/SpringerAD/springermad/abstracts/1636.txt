Neuroplastin 65 (Np65) is an immunoglobulin superfamily cell adhesion molecule involved in synaptic formation and plasticity. Our recent study showed that Np65-knockout (KO) mice exhibit abnormal cognition and emotional disorders. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we found 588 differentially-expressed genes in Np65-KO mice by microarray analysis. RT-PCR analysis also revealed the altered expression of genes associated with development and synaptic structure, such as Cdh1, Htr3a, and Kcnj9. In addition, the expression of Wnt-3, a Wnt protein involved in development, was decreased in Np65-KO mice as evidenced by western blotting. Surprisingly, MRI and DAPI staining showed a significant reduction in the lateral ventricular volume of Np65-KO mice. Together, these findings suggest that ablation of Np65 influences gene expression, which may contribute to abnormal brain development. These results provide clues to the mechanisms underlying the altered brain functions of Np65-deficient mice.
