Prosthetic valve thrombosis (PVT) is a potentially life-threatening complication associated with high morbidity and mortality. The CHA2DS2-VASc is a clinical score used to determine thromboembolism risk in non-valvular atrial fibrillation patients. Therefore; in this study, we aimed to determine predictive value of the CHA2DS2-VASc score for development of PVT in patients with mechanical prosthetic valve. This was a retrospective study included 417 consecutive patients with mechanic prosthetic valve in whom transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was performed due to different clinical indications from January 2004 to June 2016. After evaluation according to exclusion criteria, 267 patients with mechanic prosthetic valve were enrolled in the study. The definitive diagnosis of the PVT was made as proposed by TEE finding. The study population was divided into two groups; PVT patients (154 patients) and control group (113 patients) with functional prosthetic valve. The CHA2DS2-VASc score was calculated for each patient from the hospital electronic database. The mechanical mitral valve thrombosis predictive value of variables including CHA2DS2-VASc score was tested in our study. The mean CHA2DS2-VASc score was significantly higher in PVT patients compared to control patients (2.51 ± 1.54 vs. 1.13 ± 1.21, p < 0.01). Both on univariate and multivariate analysis demonstrated that the CHA2DS2-VASc score is independently associated with PVT (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). The patients whose CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 1–3 had 6.20 times higher risk for thrombus formation, and patients whose CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 4 had 16.6 times higher risk for thrombus formation compared to patients with CHA2DS2-VASc score = 0 (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). The CHA2DS2-VASc score may be a significant independent predictor of PVT in patients with prosthetic valve and the CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 2.5 or more was associated with increased PVT in patients with prosthetic valve. Thus; it may be an applicable risk scoring system to assess the risk of development of PVT in patients with prosthetic valve.
