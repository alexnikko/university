Protein–protein interaction (PPI) and host–pathogen interactions (HPI) proteomic analysis has been successfully practiced for potential drug target identification in pathogenic infections. In this research, we attempted to identify new drug target based on PPI and HPI computation approaches and subsequently design new drug against devastating enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O104:H4 C277-11 (Broad), which causes life-threatening food borne disease outbreak in Germany and other countries in Europe in 2011. Our systematic in silico analysis on PPI and HPI of E. coli O104:H4 was able to identify bacterial d-galactose-binding periplasmic and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 1-carboxyvinyltransferase as attractive candidates for new drug targets. Furthermore, computational three-dimensional structure modeling and subsequent molecular docking finally proposed [3-(5-Amino-7-Hydroxy-[1,2,3]Triazolo[4,5-d]Pyrimidin-2-Yl)-N-(3,5-Dichlorobenzyl)-Benzamide)] and (6-amino-2-[(1-naphthylmethyl)amino]-3,7-dihydro-8H-imidazo[4,5-g]quinazolin-8-one) as promising candidate drugs for further evaluation and development for E. coli O104:H4 mediated diseases. Identification of new drug target would be of great utility for humanity as the demand for designing new drugs to fight infections is increasing due to the developing resistance and side effects of current treatments. This research provided the basis for computer aided drug design which might be useful for new drug target identification and subsequent drug design for other infectious organisms.
