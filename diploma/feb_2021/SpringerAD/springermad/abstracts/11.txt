Image-guided cervical nerve root injections can cause serious complications including spinal cord infarction. This risk may be increased in patients with carotid stenosis who develop collateral arteries. The aim of this study is to describe the prevalence, and anatomical location, of arterial collateral vessels in relation to the optimal needle tip position in cervical nerve root injections.
