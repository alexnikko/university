Major BCR-ABL1 mRNA in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has generally been analysed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Application of the international scale (IS) for the quantification of major BCR-ABL1 mRNA has been recommended in several sets of guidelines, including those of the European LeukemiaNet. The aim of this study was to clarify the efficacy of digital PCR technology for the IS of BCR-ABL1 mRNA in the patients with CML by comparing with real-time PCR.
