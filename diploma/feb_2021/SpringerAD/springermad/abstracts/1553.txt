Aging is associated with a decline in lymphocyte function however, little is known about dendritic cell (DC) subsets and aging. Aging is also associated with increasing circulating lipid levels and intracellular lipid accumulation modulates DC function. Whether age-associated increases in lipid levels influence DC biology is unknown. Thus, the effects of aging on DC subsets were assessed in vivo using young adult and elderly C57BL/6Â J mice.
