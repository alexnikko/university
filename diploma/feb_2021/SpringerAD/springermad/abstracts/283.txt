Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a serious disease that, in the presence of underlying disease, causes persistent, generalized, marked coagulation activation. Early treatment based on an appropriate diagnosis is very important for improving patientsâ€™ prognosis, to which end diagnostic criteria play a key role. Several criteria have been proposed, but each has its strengths and weaknesses, and improved criteria are needed. Widespread use of coagulofibrinolytic markers has elucidated that the pathology of DIC differs greatly as a function of the underlying disease. Thus, discriminating use of DIC diagnostic criteria that take underlying diseases into account is important.
