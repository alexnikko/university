A previous functional magnetic resonance imaging study reported evidence for parallel memory traces in the hippocampus: a controlled match signal detecting matches to internally-generated goal states and an automatic mismatch signal identifying unpredicted perceptual novelty. However, the timing information in this process is unknown. In the current study, facilitated by the high spatial and temporal resolution of intracranial recording from human patients, we confirmed that the left posterior hippocampus played an important role in the goal match enhancement effect, in which combinations of object identity and location were involved. We also found that this effect happened within 520 ms to 735 ms after the probe onset, ~150 ms later than the perceptual mismatch enhancement found bilaterally in both the anterior and posterior hippocampus. More specifically, the latency of the perceptual mismatch enhancement effect of the right hippocampus was positively correlated with the performance accuracy. These results suggested that the hippocampus is crucial in working memory if features binding with location are involved in the task and the goal match enhancement effect happens after perceptual mismatch enhancement, implying the dissociation of different components of working memory at the hippocampus. Moreover, single trial decoding results suggested that the intracranial field potential response in the right hippocampus can classify the match or switch task. This is consistent with the findings that the right hippocampal activity observed during the simulation of the future events may reflect the encoding of the simulation into memory.
