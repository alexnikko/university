Since the last review paper published in Cerebellum in 2002 [1], there has been a substantial increase in the number of experiments utilizing transgenic manipulations in murine cerebellar Purkinje cells. Most of these approaches were made possible with the use of the Cre/loxP methodology and pcp2/L7 based Cre recombinase expressing transgenic mouse strains. This review aims to summarize all studies which used Purkinje cell specific transgenesis since the first use of mouse strain with Purkinje cell specific Cre expression in 2002.
