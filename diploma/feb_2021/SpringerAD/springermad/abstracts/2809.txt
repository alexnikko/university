Cancer stem cells (CSC) represent the subpopulation of cells within a tumour showing two fundamental properties of stem cells â€“ self-renewal (the ability to make more of their own kind) and differentiation (the ability to generate diverse cell types present within a tissue). The CSC hypothesis posits that CSCs play an important role in tumour initiation, maintenance and progression. Furthermore, owing to their intrinsic drug resistance, they remain refractory to currently used therapy, thereby contributing to tumour relapse. Thus, targeting or taming CSCs can lead to more effective cancer treatment in the coming decades. In this review, we will discuss about the origin of CSC hypothesis, evidence showing their existence, clinical relevance and translational significance.
