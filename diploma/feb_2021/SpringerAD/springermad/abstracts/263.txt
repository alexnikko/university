Subcutaneous unfractionated heparin (SCUFH) has been proved effective in puerperal cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), but its efficacy in the more serious form of the disease such as deep CVT patients (DCVT) unreported. We describe the outcomes of 37 (isolated:combined: 11:26) patients of DCVT diagnosed by MRI, treated with SCUFH in a tertiary care stroke unit. It was a prospective observational cohort study using 5000 U of SCUFH every 6 hourly for 10 days with oral Acenocoumarol started on day 7, with monitoring. The outcome was assessed by modified Rankin scale (mRS), National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and Barthel’s activities of daily life (BADL) at 3 months. The mean age of the cohort was 27.9 ± 9.7 years, females (n = 24) outnumbering the males (n = 13). Mean duration of symptoms being 10.2 ± 15.9 days. MRI showed vein of Galen and straight sinus involvement in 36 (97.3%) patients, with sparing of the basal vein of Rosenthal in 28 (75%). Thalamus 27 (73%) basal ganglia 21 (56.7%) were commonly involved areas with hemorrhagic lesions in 18 (48.6%) patients. The median NIHSS score at presentation was 11 (1–21). Mean duration of SCUFH treatment was 9.3 ± 1.3 days and the mean aPTT on day 7 was 49.3 ± 9.8 s (control 32–39 s), mean PT INR on day 13 was 1.5 ± 0.45. All the patients improved with no mortality in the study group. At 3 months, good functional outcome (mRS: 0–2) was observed in 94.6% (n = 35) of patients. Two patients had mRS-3. The median mRS (3{1–5} to 0{0–3}) and BADL (8{0–20} to 20{8–20}) improved at 3 months. Complications seen were thrombocytopenia-1, infection-6 and deep vein thrombosis of leg-4. Our preliminary data suggests that SCUFH is safe, effective treatment option in patients with DCVT in a stroke unit with minimal monitoring.
