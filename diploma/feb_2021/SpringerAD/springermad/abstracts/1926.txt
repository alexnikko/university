 In vivo imaging of the tau protein has the potential to aid in quantitative diagnosis of Alzheimerâ€™s disease, corroborate or dispute the amyloid hypothesis, and demonstrate biomarker engagement in clinical drug trials. A host of tau positron emission tomography agents have been designed, validated, and tested in humans. Several agents have characteristics approaching the ideal imaging tracer with some limitations, primarily regarding off-target binding. Dozens of clinical trials evaluating imaging techniques and several pharmaceutical trials have begun to integrate tau imaging into their protocols.
