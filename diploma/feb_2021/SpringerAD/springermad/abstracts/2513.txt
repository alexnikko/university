Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health problem worldwide and is associated with spatial learning deficits. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the protective effects of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) on CKD-mediated behavioral deficits with emphasis to the role of nitric oxide (NO) in these effects. Fifty rats were randomly allocated to five experimental groups including: sham, Five-sixth (5/6) nephrectomy (Nx), 5/6Nx + NaHS, 5/6Nx + NaHS+L-nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME), and 5/6Nx + NaHS+aminoguanidine (AMG). Twelve weeks after 5/6Nx, we evaluated proteinuria, creatinine clearance (CrCl), oxidative/antioxidant status, and hippocampus neuro-inflammation and NO synthase genes in all groups. Furthermore, training trials of all animals were conducted in the Morris water maze (MWM) task one day before animal euthanizing. As predicted, 5/6Nx induced several injuries, including enhancement of proteinuria and reduction of CCr, oxidant/antioxidant imbalance and up-regulation of TNF-α and IL-1β gene expressions in the hippocampus tissues. As predicted, 5/6Nx resulted in learning and memory impairments, and increased escape latency during acquisition trials in the MWM task. Interestingly, NaHS (H2S donor) improved behavioral deficits, renal dysfunction, accelerated anti-oxidant/anti-inflammatory responses and increased eNOS and decreased iNOS. Moreover, these effects of NaHS were prevented by L-NAME but not AMG co-administration. In conclusion, H2S ameliorates CKD-mediated brain dysfunctions, through interaction with NO signaling in the hippocampus.
