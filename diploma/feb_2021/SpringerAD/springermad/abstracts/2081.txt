Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. It is characterized by a sudden disruption of blood flow to the brain causing cell death and damage, which will lead to neurological impairments. In the current state, only one drug is approved to be used in clinical setting and new therapies that confer ischemic neuroprotection are desperately needed. Several targets and pathways have been indicated to be neuroprotective in ischemic stroke, among which the sirtuin family of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent deacetylases has emerged as important modulators of several processes in the normal physiology and pathological conditions such as stroke. Recent studies have identified some members of the sirtuin family are able to ameliorate the devastating consequences of ischemic stroke by conferring neuroprotection by means of reducing neuronal cell death, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation whereas some sirtuins are found to be detrimental in the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke. This review summarizes implications of sirtuins in ischemic stroke and the experimental evidences that demonstrate the potential of sirtuin modulators as neuroprotective therapy for ischemic stroke.
