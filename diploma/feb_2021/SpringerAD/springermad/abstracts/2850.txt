Lipids are a complex group of chemical compounds that are a significant component of the human diet and are one of the main constituents of milk. In mammals, lipids are produced in the milk-secreting cells in the form of milk fat globules. The chemical properties of these compounds necessitate developing separate processes for effective management of non-polar substances in the polar environment of the cell, not only during their biosynthesis and accumulation in the cell interior and secretion of intracytoplasmic lipid droplets outside the cell, but also during digestion in the offspring. Phospholipids play an important role in these processes. Their characteristic properties make them indispensable for the secretion of milk fat as well as other milk components. This review investigates how these processes depend on the coordinated flux and availability of phospholipids and how the relationship between the surface area (phospholipids) and volume (neutral lipids) of the cytoplasmic lipid droplets must be in biosynthetic balance. The structure formed as a result (i.e. a milk fat globule) is therefore a result of specified structural limitations inside the cell, whose overcoming enables the coordinated secretion of milk components. This structure and its composition also reflects the nutritional demands of the developing infant organism as a result of evolutionary adaptation.
