In patients with acute occlusions of the middle cerebral artery, the collaterals play an important role in infarct growth and potentially on clinical outcome. As the primary collateral pathway, the posterior cerebral artery with the posterior communicating artery (PComA) is important. We analyzed the influence of the presence of an ipsilateral PComA on infarct growth and clinical outcome.
