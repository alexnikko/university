Epileptic encephalopathies represent a group of devastating epileptic disorders that occur early in life and are often characterized by pharmaco-resistant epilepsy, persistent severe electroencephalographic abnormalities, and cognitive dysfunction or decline. Next generation sequencing technologies have increased the speed of gene discovery tremendously. Whereas ion channel genes were long considered to be the only significant group of genes implicated in the genetic epilepsies, a growing number of non-ion-channel genes are now being identified. As a subgroup of the genetically mediated epilepsies, epileptic encephalopathies are complex and heterogeneous disorders, making diagnosis and treatment decisions difficult. Recent exome sequencing data suggest that mutations causing epileptic encephalopathies are often sporadic, typically resulting from de novo dominant mutations in a single autosomal gene, although inherited autosomal recessive and X-linked forms also exist.
