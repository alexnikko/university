Recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin (rTM) has been established and introduced in the clinic as a standard treatment for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). However, the efficacy and safety of rTM for DIC associated with solid tumors (DIC-STs) have not been fully established. Here, we performed a retrospective analysis of the clinical outcomes of rTM for DIC-STs and considered a treatment strategy with rTM for DIC-STs.
