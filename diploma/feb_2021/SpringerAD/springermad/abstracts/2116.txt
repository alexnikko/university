Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a motor disease associated with the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta. p53 is a major neuronal pro-apoptotic factor that is at the center of gravity of multiple physiological and pathological cascades, some of which implying several key PD-linked proteins. Since p53 is up-regulated in PD-affected brain, we have examined its ability to regulate the transcription of α-synuclein, a key protein that accumulates in PD-related Lewy bodies.
