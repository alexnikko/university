Tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3, A20) is a negative regulator of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway. It has recently been recognized that TNFAIP3 deficiency leads to early onset of autoinflammatory and autoimmune syndrome resembling Behçet’s disease. Here, we report a novel mutation in TNFAIP3 in a Chinese patient, who had Behçet-like phenotype and persistent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) viremia.
