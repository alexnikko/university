Signs of pervasive developmental disorder and social deficits were reported in toddlers and children whose mothers were exposed to organophosphate pesticides during pregnancy. Deficits in social preference were reported in adult male mice exposed to chlorpyrifos on gestational days 12–15. This study aimed (a) to test the hypothesis that adult female and male mice that were exposed prenatally to subtoxic doses of chlorpyrifos would be impaired in social behavior and (b) to determine if prenatal chlorpyrifos altered the expression of transcripts for oxytocin in the hypothalamus. Pregnant mice were treated by gavage with corn oil vehicle or 2.5 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg of CPF on gestational days 12–15. Social preference, social and non-social conditioned place preference tasks were tested in adults. Expression of oxytocin transcripts in hypothalamus was measured by qPCR.
