The functional changes associated with endothelial senescence may be involved in human aging and age-related vascular disorders. Since the inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL-)1 inhibits endothelial growth, we evaluated the expression of IL-1α, IL-1β and their antagonist, the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), in endothelial in vitro senescence and quiescence. We also examined the expression of IL-1α in human senescent and progeric fibroblasts.
