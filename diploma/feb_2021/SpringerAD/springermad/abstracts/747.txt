This study aims to evaluate home-based treatment with immunoglobulin (IgG) by assessing and comparing the experiences and perceived value of patients and healthcare professionals, and potential differences in experiences between subcutaneous (SCIg) and intravenous (IVIg) modes of administration. As choices on the location and type of treatment are determined in a shared decision-making process, we evaluated the home-based treatment from the perspectives of both patients and professionals.
