Breast reconstruction (BR) should be offered and discussed to each woman with breast cancer who planned for mastectomy, except the cases with severe comorbidities. However, the majority of these patients do not undergo reconstructive surgery. A 20-question survey was administered to a group of 50 women (age 29–83 years, median 53) treated with mastectomy. 22.4 % underwent reconstruction of the breast, 24.5 % declared an interest in BR in the future, 53.1 % were not interested in reconstructive surgery. 51.2 % obtained information concerning BR before surgery, 58.1 % after and 44.2 % both before and after mastectomy. 59.2 % were informed about reimbursement. Information given before surgery had a statistically significant impact on performing reconstruction or a declared interest in BR (X 2 = 4.950, df = 1, p < 0.05), as well as information about reimbursement (X 2 = 8.875, df = 1, p < 0.05). Age <55 years was another significant factor (X 2 = 13.522, df = 1, p < 0.05, C Pearson = 0.525). Level of education did not impact upon the choice (p > 0.05). The main reasons for the refusal were fear of complications (47.4 %), priority to recovery over aesthetic (36.8 %), age, defined by the patient as “advanced” (31.6 %), high level of acceptance of the body after amputation (31.6 %), fear of cancer recurrence (26.3 %) and fear of the pain and discomfort (15.8 %). Each patient who planned for mastectomy should obtain sufficient information regarding breast reconstruction. Exact information is of special benefit to women discouraged by imagined disadvantages of surgery. Patients’ education impacts the quality of life—not only before surgery but also lifelong after finishing the treatment.
