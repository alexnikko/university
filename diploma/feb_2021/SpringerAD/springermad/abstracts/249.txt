Apixaban is effective and safe for preventing stroke, and its usage has increased exponentially in recent years. However, data concerning the therapeutic range of apixaban is limited. This study determined the trough and peak levels of apixaban-specific anti-factor Xa activity (AFXaA) in acute ischemic stroke patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) in Korea. The study included 85 patients who received apixaban. Blood samples were taken to measure the trough and peak levels of AFXaA using a chromogenic anti-factor assay, as well as prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). We also reviewed complications such as major bleeding of patients treated with apixaban. In patients given a 5.0-mg apixaban dose, the median trough and peak levels of AFXaA were 104.5 and 202.0 ng/mL. In patients given a 2.5-mg apixaban dose, the median trough and peak AFXaA levels were 76.0 and 151.0 ng/mL. The PT showed a positive correlation with increased AFXaA activity at both levels (Trough R = 0.486, Peak R = 0.592), but the aPTT had no relationship with AFXaA activity at both levels (Trough R = 0.181, Peak R = 0.129). Two cases with intracranial bleeding belonged to the highest AFXaA quartile (Trough, p = 0.176; Peak, p = 0.053). In conclusion, we determined the trough and peak levels of AFXaA in patients with NVAF while being treated with the apixaban in Korea. Our results could be used as a starting point when setting the reference ranges for laboratories using anti-Xa assay. Large-scale studies are needed to establish the reference range for AFXaA in patients with NVAF.
