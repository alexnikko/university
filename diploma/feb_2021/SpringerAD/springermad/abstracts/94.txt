Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and disease burden worldwide. Nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging with either single-photon emission computed tomography or positron emission tomography has been used extensively to perform diagnosis, monitor therapies, and predict cardiovascular events. Several radiopharmaceutical tracers have recently been developed to evaluate CVD by targeting myocardial perfusion, metabolism, innervation, and inflammation. This article reviews old and newer used in nuclear cardiac imaging.
