Deoxypodophyllotoxin (DPT) is a new potential anti-tumor drug with nearly no water solubility and low permeability. Hence, we prepared a poly (ethylene glycol)-distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine (PEG-DSPE) modified long-circulation liposomes for enhanced solubility and anti-tumor capacity of DPT with clinical expectation.
