Subclinical atrial fibrillation (AF) was found in a large number of pacemaker patients. It is not certain whether there is a similar risk/benefit ratio for oral anticoagulation in patients with subclinical AF compared to patients with similar risk profiles and clinically diagnosed AF. Given the weakness of clinical evidence for oral anticoagulation in patients with device-detected subclinical AF, specific recommendations in most guidelines for this population are scarce and rarely similar.
