Multiple studies demonstrated pro-angiogenic effects of microRNA (miR)-27b. Its targets include Notch ligand Dll4, Sprouty (Spry)-2, PPARÎ³ and Semaphorin (SEMA) 6A. miR-27 effects in the heart are context-dependent: although it is necessary for ventricular maturation, targeted overexpression in cardiomyocytes causes hypertrophy and dysfunction during development. Despite significant recent advances, therapeutic potential of miR-27b in cardiovascular disease and its effects in adult heart remain unexplored. Here, we assessed the therapeutic potential of miR-27b mimics and inhibitors in rodent models of ischemic disease and cancer.
