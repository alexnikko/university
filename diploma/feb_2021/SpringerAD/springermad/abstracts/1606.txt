The inflammasome, typically consisting of a Nod-like receptor, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein, and pro-caspase-1, has recently been identified as a huge intracellular complex, which plays a crucial role in interleukin-1 maturation or specific physiological functions. Two Nod-like receptors, such as nucleotide-binding oligomerization domains-containing protein (Nod)1 and Nod2, interact with the receptor-interacting protein serine-threonine kinase (RIPK)2 accompanied by Iκ-B kinase (IKK) complexes to construct the nodosome, leading to nuclear factor (NF)-κB activation. The aberrant activation of inflammasomes or nodosomes causes autoinflammatory diseases. Therefore, inflammasomes may be attractive targets to treat autoinflammatory diseases. Our aim is to develop reconstituted inflammasomes in a cell-free system to discover specific molecular-target drugs and elucidate the molecular pathogenesis of autoinflammatory diseases. In this review, we describe reconstituted inflammasomes in a cell-free system.
