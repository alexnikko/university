Benzimidazole (BZ) resistance of Haemonchus contortus has been associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in codons 200 (F200Y) and 167 (F167Y) and, to a lesser extent, in codon E198A, of the β-tubulin isotype 1 gene. The present study was undertaken to survey the status of BZ resistance in naturally infected goats in smallholder farms in southern Mozambique by real-time PCR (qPCR) using TaqMan® assays. H. contortus-infective larvae (L3; n = 432) from 12 populations were individually genotyped for F200Y and F167Y SNPs to detect BZ resistance. For the F200Y SNP, the results revealed an overall mean percentages of 18.8% homozygous resistant (RR), 47.8% homozygous susceptible (SS) and 33.4% heterozygous (RS) H. contortus. For the F167Y SNP, the overall mean percentages were 1.6% RR, 94.9% SS and 3.5% RS. The percentage of resistant alleles (%R) for the F200Y and F167Y SNPs was 35.7 and 3.4%, respectively. Genotype combinations of the two mutations indicate resistant percentages ranging from 0.0 to 52.9%. From the four herds with high RR individuals, three farms dewormed the animals monthly, while the fourth farm dewormed the animals every 3 months. In farms where animals were dewormed every 6 months, low percentages of RR individuals were found, whereas no RR individuals were discovered in herds where animals were dewormed annually. These results suggest that the F200Y SNP is more significant in BZ resistance development of the surveyed population compared with the F167Y SNP.
