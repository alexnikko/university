Voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) play a critical role in neuroinflammatory diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). CTK 01512-2 is a recombinant version of the peptide Phα1β derived from the spider Phoneutria nigriventer, which inhibits N-type VGCC/TRPA1-mediated calcium influx. We investigated the effects of this molecule in the mouse model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). The effects of CTK 01512-2 were compared to those displayed by ziconotide—a selective N-type VGCC blocker clinically used for chronic pain—and fingolimod—a drug employed for MS treatment. The intrathecal (i.t.) treatment with CTK 01512-2 displayed beneficial effects, by preventing nociception, body weight loss, splenomegaly, MS-like clinical and neurological scores, impaired motor coordination, and memory deficits, with an efficacy comparable to that observed for ziconotide and fingolimod. This molecule displayed a favorable profile on EAE-induced neuroinflammatory changes, including inflammatory infiltrate, demyelination, pro-inflammatory cytokine production, glial activation, and glucose metabolism in the brain and spinal cord. The recovery of spatial memory, besides a reduction of serum leptin levels, allied to central and peripheral elevation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, was solely modulated by CTK 01512-2, dosed intrathecally. The intravenous (i.v.) administration of CTK 01512-2 also reduced the EAE-elicited MS-like symptoms, similarly to that seen in animals that received fingolimod orally. Ziconotide lacked any significant effect when dosed by i.v. route. Our results indicate that CTK 01512-2 greatly improved the neuroinflammatory responses in a mouse model of MS, with a higher efficacy when compared to ziconotide, pointing out this molecule as a promising adjuvant for MS management.
