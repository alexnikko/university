Homozygous mutations in the HAX1 gene cause an autosomal recessive form of severe congenital neutropenia (SCN). There are limited data on cases of gonadal insufficiency that involve the HAX1 gene mutation. We aimed to evaluate the pubertal development and gonadal functions of our patients with a p.Trp44X mutation in the HAX1 gene.
