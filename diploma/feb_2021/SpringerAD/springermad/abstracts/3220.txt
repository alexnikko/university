The aims of the present work were to pelletize talc by extrusion-spheronization technique using microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) as a pelletization aid and to study its performance as a neutral substrate for coating. A 32 factorial design was used to study the effect of independent variables (X1, amount of talc, and X2, MCC) on pellet properties.
