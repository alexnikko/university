The study was performed to evaluate the effect of high-fat diet (HF) as well as high-fat high-fructose diet (HFF) and uninephrectomy on level of kidney profile and lipid profile. The statistical results showed that serum uric acid, creatinine, cystatin C, NLRP3, urine microalbumin, and creatinine were enhanced where glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was reduced in HFF than HF group compared to (low-fat) LF group. After dietary intervention, renal fibrosis, nephropathy, albuminuria, oxidative stress, and nephropathy occurred. These cases were more severed in uninephrectomized HFF followed by HF. In conclusion, HF- or HFF-induced kidney damage is enhanced further more with uninephrectomy and is linked with abnormalities in renal tissue. Progressive renal insufficiency and glomerulosclerosis had been observed in obese animals without uninephrectomy Therefore, renal damage because of obesity-related hyperfiltration is especially severe with uninephrectomy. More studies needed to study the effect of these diets on other metabolic organs in genetic level.
