ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) significantly changed the prognosis of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and clinical trials demonstrated that TKIs can be discontinued in approximately 50% of patients after a period of deep molecular response (DMR). However, in some patients, TKI discontinuation leads to anxiety and depression. Here, we analysed the incidence of anxiety and depression in patients who stop TKI therapy.
