We investigated the impact of suboptimal platelet reactivity on clinical outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We enrolled 500 patients with stable coronary artery disease undergoing elective PCI. Platelet reactivity was measured before PCI using the VerifyNow P2Y12 assay. Primary endpoint was the incidence of ischemic or bleeding events at 1 month and 5 years. Patients with high platelet reactivity (HPR) showed significantly higher rates of ischemic events both during the 1st month after PCI (HR 2.06, 95% CI 1.02–4.06), and beyond 1 month compared with patients without HPR (HR 1.73, 95% CI 1.02–2.95). Conversely, compared with patients without low platelet reactivity (LPR), patients with LPR presented significantly higher rates of bleeding only during the 1st month (HR 3.67, 95% CI 1.68–8.02). In conclusion, pre-procedural HPR is associated with ischemic events even beyond the 1st month after PCI. The association of LPR with bleeding events seems to be confined to the periprocedural period.
