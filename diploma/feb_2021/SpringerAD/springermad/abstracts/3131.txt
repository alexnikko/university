Endosalpingiosis has a close relationship with the development of serous tumors, especially low-grade serous carcinoma. It is often found accidently during surgery. “Endosalpingiosis” refers to the presence of fallopian tube-like epithelium outside fallopian tubes. It merits attention by both clinicians and pathologists since it is a benign, non-neoplastic condition which may be easily misjudged as carcinoma mainly due to the rarity of its occurrence and lack of awareness owing to paucity of its documentation in the literature. Further, salpingiosis can undergo massive cystic change, thereby mimicking a tumor (cystic endosalpingiosis).
