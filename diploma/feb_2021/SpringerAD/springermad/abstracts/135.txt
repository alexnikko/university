Mismatch between myocardial innervation and perfusion assessed with positron emission tomography (PET) is a potential risk marker for ventricular arrhythmias in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. This mismatch zone originates from residual viable myocardium that has sustained ischemic nerve injury. Heterogenic scar size assessed with late gadolinium-enhanced (LGE) cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) is also a risk marker of ventricular arrhythmias. These two imaging parameters may represent identical morphological tissue features. The current study explored the relation between innervation-perfusion mismatch and heterogenic scar size.
