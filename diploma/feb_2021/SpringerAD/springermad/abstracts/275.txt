The thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs) is a heterogeneous group of relatively uncommon but serious disorders presenting with thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic haemolysis. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is one of these microangiopathic processes. HIV infection is an acquired cause of TTP but the pathogenesis is poorly understood. HIV-associated TTP was previously described to be associated with advanced immunosuppression. The incidence of HIV-related TTP was expected to decline with access to anti-retroviral therapy (ART).
