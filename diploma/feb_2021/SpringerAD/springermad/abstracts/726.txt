Colitis is a common and serious complication of chronic granulomatous disorder (CGD) and requires assessment. Colonoscopy is invasive and carries risks of serious complication. We therefore assessed non-invasive monitoring via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We also evaluated fecal calprotectin (FCP), the Harvey-Bradshaw index (HBI) clinical score, and serum cytokines.
