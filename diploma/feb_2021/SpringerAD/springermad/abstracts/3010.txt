The EuroQol 5-dimension scale (EQ-5D) is one of the most frequently used preference-based quality of life (QOL) measures for health technology assessment. The 3-level version of the EQ-5D comprises a descriptive system (the EQ-5D-3L) and a visual analog scale (EQ-VAS). It remains unclear whether this five-item scale correlates with the QOL of patients with oral cancer during the perioperative period. We sought to clarify this point in the present study.
