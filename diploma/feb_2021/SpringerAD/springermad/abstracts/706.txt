Beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers (CCB) are milestones in the treatment of stable coronary ischaemic disease. Their main effects are particularly suited for the management of effort-induced angina because of the reduction of oxygen demand they achieve. The clinical benefits of these drugs are highly reproducible and have been shown to improve overall clinical outcomes. Despite the availability of other, and newer antianginal drugs, treatment guidelines continue to recommend the use of beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers as first line therapies.
