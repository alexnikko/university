Dimebon is an antihistamine compound with a long history of clinical use in Russia. Recently, Dimebon has been proposed to be useful for treating neurodegenerative disorders. It has demonstrated efficacy in phase II Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Huntington's disease (HD) clinical trials. The mechanisms responsible for the beneficial actions of Dimebon in AD and HD remain unclear. It has been suggested that Dimebon may act by blocking NMDA receptors or voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and by preventing mitochondrial permeability pore transition.
