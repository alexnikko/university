The factors underlying the increasing rates and the geographic variation of childhood cancers are largely unknown. Epidemiological studies provide limited evidence for a possible role in the etiology of certain types of childhood cancer of the exposure of pregnant women to environmental carcinogens (e.g., tobacco smoke and pesticides); however, such evidence is inadequate to allow definitive conclusions. Complementary evidence can be obtained from biomarker-based population studies. Such studies have demonstrated that, following exposure of pregnant mothers, most environmental carcinogens reach the fetus and, in many cases, induce therein genotoxic damage which in adults is known to be associated with increased cancer risk, implying that environmental carcinogens may contribute to the etiology of childhood cancer. During recent years, intermediate disease biomarkers, obtained via omic profiling, have provided additional insights into the impact of transplacental exposures on fetal tissues which, in some cases, are also compatible with a precarcinogenic role of certain in utero exposures. Here we review the epidemiological and biomarker evidence and discuss how further research, especially utilizing high-density profiling, may allow a better evaluation of the links between in utero environmental exposures and cancer in children.
