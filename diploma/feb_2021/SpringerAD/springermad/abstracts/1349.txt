Intraspecific variation of Parasaccocoelium mugili collected from mullet fish of the south of Russian Far East and Vietnam has previously been estimated on the basis of two molecular markers: ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) rDNA and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene sequences. In the present study, molecular identification of this species from the Kievka River, Primorye and from Vietnam was performed by analysis of 28S rDNA sequences. Analysis of ITS1 rDNA sequences variation revealed two highly differentiated main groups, representing trematode specimens from the two regions. Genetic variation within each region was relatively low. Mitochondrial COI gene sequence data analysis revealed fixed nucleotide and amino acid substitutions, and supported the existence of two genetically different groups associated with geographical origin. Analysis of the COI gene fragments showed extremely high variation within Russian and Vietnamese P. mugili samples. Our results for P. mugili most probably represent a case of initial step of allopotric speciation for this trematode, caused by living strategy of its definitive host at evolutionary scale. Mitochondrial DNA sequence data show that existence of gene flow between local populations of P. mugili in the Primorye Region caused by definitive hosts can be proposed.
