Many studies have examined the association between the XRCC3 Thr241Met gene polymorphism and lung cancer risk in various populations, but their results have been inconsistent. To assess this relationship more precisely, a meta-analysis was performed. The PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and CNKI database was searched for caseâ€“control studies published up to July 2012. Data were extracted and pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.
