Pregnancy associated melanoma (PAM) by definition appears during pregnancy or within 1 year after delivery. In this retrospective study we analysed the pathological characteristics and survival rate of PAM and matched the data with non-pregnant age- and stage-matched control patients. Between 2003 and 2014, 34 pregnant women (aged 32.5 ± 5.6 years) were diagnosed with melanoma at the Department of Dermatology, Venereology and Dermatooncology of the Semmelweis University. During the pathological process histologic subtype, Breslow thickness and Clark level, tumor cell type, mitotic rate, peritumoral inflammation, as well as ulceration, regression, necrosis, vascular invasion and presence of satellite were analyzed and related to clinical data. Primary tumor location and clinical staging, disease course, local recurrence and metastases, 5-year survival rate, other tumor development before or after the diagnosis of melanoma have also been documented. We found no difference in all parameters between pregnant and non-pregnant melanoma cases except peritumoral inflammation which was higher in PAM group, moreover the presence of mild inflammation was significantly higher in PAM group compared to non-pregnancy associated melanoma (NPAM) women group.
