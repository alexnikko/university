Time-of-flight (TOF) is known to increase signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and facilitate reductions in administered activity. Established measures of SNR gain are derived from areas of uniform uptake, which is not applicable to the heterogeneous uptake in cardiac PET images using fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG). This study aimed to develop a technique to quantify SNR gains within the myocardium due to TOF.
