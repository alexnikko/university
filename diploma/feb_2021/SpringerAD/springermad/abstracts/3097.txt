Peritonectomy is an important component in surgical treatment for peritoneal surface malignancies. Visual inspection and palpation to estimate the extent of tumor involvement are unreliable. Most gynecologic oncologists are skeptical regarding the benefits of complete peritonectomy and do not perform them, worrying about the benefit and associated morbidity. They believe it is the inherent tumor biology that determines the resectability of the tumor, not surgical aggressiveness. The aim of this study was to assess the recurrence pattern, oncological outcomes, morbidity and mortality based on the extent of parietal peritonectomy performed during CRS and HIPEC in stage IIIc epithelial ovarian cancers.
