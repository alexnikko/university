Sacubitril/valsartan reduced heart failure (HF) admissions and cardiovascular mortality in the PARADIGM-HF trial. However, real-life studies are scarce comparing daily practice patients with those of the trial. The aim of our study was to analyze the efficacy and safety of the drug in an advanced heart failure cohort and to review systematically the previous real-life studies published to date.
