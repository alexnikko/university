Renal dysfunction due to ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is a common problem following reno-vascular surgery and kidney transplantation. In the present study, we investigated the protective effects of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs), ischemic preconditioning (IPC), and royal jelly (RJ) administration on kidney I/R injury. Male Balb/c mice (30–35 g) were divided randomly into six groups including sham, I/R, I/R after IPC, I/R pre-treated with 100 mg/kg/day RJ for 20 days (I/R + RJ), treatment with 1 × 106 GFP+ BM-MSCs after I/R induction (I/R + MSCs), and I/R pre-treated with 100 mg/kg/day RJ for 20 days and treated with 1 × 106 GFP+ BM-MSCs after I/R induction (I/R + MSCs/RJ). Ten days before beginning the study, the right kidneys of all the mice were removed. I/R injury was induced by clamping the left renal artery for 45 min followed by reperfusion for 48 h. Blood serum was analyzed for blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels. The histological patterns and the expression of FADD, BAX, BAD, BCL-2, and miR-24 were also evaluated. The BUN level was reduced in I/R + RJ and I/R + MSCs groups significantly. However, the Cr level was significantly decreased just in the I/R + RJ group. The glomerular injury and expression of apoptosis genes were significantly less in the I/R + RJ and I/R + MSCs/RJ groups. The expression of miR-24 showed reduction in all the treated groups unless IPC. Although the previous studies have shown that IPC protects kidney against I/R injury, we found out MSCs and RJ may have a higher potential to protect the kidney tissue. According to the findings, RJ may be effective to protect the kidney against I/R injury.
