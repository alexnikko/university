Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) has been developed to improve reliability of many interventional radiology (IR) procedures performed with Angio system, such as transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). Angio-CT has emerged as a new imaging technology that combines a CT scanner with an Angio system in the same IR suite. The purpose of our study was to compare Angio system with CBCT capability and Angio-CT in terms of patient radiation exposure during TACE procedures.
