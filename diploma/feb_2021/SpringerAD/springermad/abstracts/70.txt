Quantification of myocardial blood flow (MBF) by positron emission tomography (PET) is important for investigation of angina in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Several software programs exist for MBF quantification, but they have been mostly evaluated in patients (with normal cardiac geometry), referred for evaluation of coronary artery disease (CAD). Software performance has not been evaluated in HCM patients who frequently have hyperdynamic LV function, LV outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction, small LV cavity size, and variation in the degree/location of LV hypertrophy.
