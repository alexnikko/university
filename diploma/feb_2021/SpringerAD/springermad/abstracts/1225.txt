Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by multisystem organ involvement and unclear pathogenesis. Several adipokines synthesized in the adipose tissue, including leptin, adiponectin, resistin, and chemerin, have been explored in autoimmune rheumatic diseases, especially SLE, and results suggest that these mediators may be implicated in the pathogenesis of SLE. However, the current results are controversial. In this review, we will briefly discuss the expression and possible pathogenic role of several important adipokines, including leptin, adiponectin, resistin, and chemerin in SLE.
