With trends toward increasing patient involvement in medical decision-making, decreasing clinic times, and the availability of the Internet, patients and their caregivers are increasingly researching cancer diagnoses online. It is essential for physicians to understand patient Internet usage as it relates to their own health education. Internet usage trends have been studied in various areas, but not in thoracic diseases. This prospective cohort study surveyed 337 thoracic surgery patients and their caregivers with both cancer and non-cancer diagnoses to examine their Internet usage trends. Cancer subjects were more likely to research their condition online if they were younger, had a higher income, had a higher education level, and were currently employed. Only age and income level were predictive for non-cancer subjects. Separately, cancer subjects were more likely to trust information found on the Internet if they had a higher education. Subjects were most likely to conduct research on a hospital website than other websites. These data will be helpful to thoracic surgeons who want to appropriately educate patients and their caregivers and direct them to reliable Internet sources. These data also illustrate the importance of developing trustworthy hospital websites with disease-specific information.
