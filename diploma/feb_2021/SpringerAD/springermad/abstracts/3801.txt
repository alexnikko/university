The number of synthetic derivatives of cathinone, the primary psychoactive alkaloid found in Catha edulis (khat), has risen exponentially in the past decade. Synthetic cathinones (frequently referred to as “bath salts”) produce adverse cognitive and behavioral sequelae, share similar pharmacological mechanisms of action with traditional psychostimulants, and may therefore trigger similar cellular events that give rise to neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity.
