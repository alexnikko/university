Neutral small hydrophiles are permeable to varying degrees, across the aqueous pores of phospholipid bilayer protein channels, with their potential for permeation into cells being predictable, on the basis of hydrophilicity and size. Here, it is hypothesized that permeation thresholds for small hydrophiles, across capillary zona occludens tight junction and inter-epithelial junction pore complexes are predictable, on the basis of predicted hydrophilicity in context of predicted molecular size and charge distribution, as are those of cations and anions, on the basis of predicted ionization in context of predicted atomic size.
