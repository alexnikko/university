Locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) is best managed by neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery and radiotherapy. Recent reports suggest that complete pathological response is associated with improved survival. Major concern of using concurrent chemoradiation in LABC is toxicity and cosmesis, and only very few studies addressed this issue. This study is carried out to study the feasibility, toxicity profile, pathological response of neoadjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiation with biweekly paclitaxel in locally advanced breast cancer patients.
