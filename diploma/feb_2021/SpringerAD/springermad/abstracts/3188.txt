To alleviate the harmful effects of radiations during occupational radiology, radiotherapy and diagnosis, radioprotective system with lower toxicity and extended activity is imperative. Trans-resveratrol (RVL) acts through free radical scavenging/antioxidant mechanism to mitigate the radiation-induced damage. But, its poor solubility and fast metabolism impede its efficacy. Thus, encapsulation of RVL into long circulating solid lipid nanoparticle (SLN) is aimed.
