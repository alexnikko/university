Canine parvovirus enteritis is a highly contagious viral disease which causes high morbidity and mortality rates in young puppies. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of procalcitonin as an inflammatory biomarker as compared with C-reactive protein and total leucocyte count in canine parvovirus enteritis. This study was carried out on 41 dogs constituting 14 apparently healthy dogs used as a control and 27 dogs affected with canine parvovirus enteritis. Inflammatory biomarkers analysis showed a significant increase in C-reactive protein, a significant decrease in leucocytes counts, and an insignificant increase in procalcitonin level. Hematological profile showed a significant decrease in red blood cells count, hemoglobin content, packed cell volume %, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and an insignificant increase in the mean corpuscular volume, and significant leucopenia, associated with neutropenia, lymphopenia, and monocytosis in addition to significant hypoproteinemia in canine parvovirus enteritis. Analysis of C-reactive protein concentration is found to be more effective than leucocytes count and procalcitonin concentration as an inflammatory biomarker in canine parvovirus enteritis.
