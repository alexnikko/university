The pediatric reproductive organs are optimally imaged with a full bladder. The filling of the bladder, however, often leads to significant delay in diagnosis and can subject the patient to invasive bladder catheterization. As the key imaging feature in ovarian torsion is unilateral ovarian enlargement, we suspected that a torsed ovary is large enough to be visualized even if the bladder is not well distended.
