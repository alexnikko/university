While transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is a mainstay of treatment for unresectable hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), technical aspects have varied considerably in the literature. These variations lead to heterogeneity and make meaningful comparisons between articles difficult. The goal of this survey was to report international embolization practices for the treatment of HCC in an effort to understand current treatment strategies as a first step toward technique standardization.
