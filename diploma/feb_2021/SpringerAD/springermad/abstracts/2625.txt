Research into the pharmacological potentials of saponins is attracting attention. This study probed the antidiabetic and free radical scavenging potentials of saponin extract from Cochlospermum planchonii root (CPS) in vitro. The antidiabetic activity was determined by the CPS inhibition of α-glucosidase and α-amylase activities while the free radical scavenging capacity was demonstrated against two, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and hydroxyl (OH) radicals. The results illustrated that CPS robustly inhibited α-glucosidase and α-amylase (IC50 values = 2.89 and 0.40 mg/mL), respectively as compared with acarbose. Both enzymes were uncompetitively inhibited as indicated by the decreased Km and Vmax values when compared with the respective control. Also, CPS displayed superior DPPH and OH radicals quenching power (IC50 values = 1.89 and 1.11 mg/mL), respectively compared with silymarin and vitamin C. Indication from the results suggests that CPS demonstrated superior inhibition of α-glucosidase and α-amylase but not a good potential source of alternative oral hypoglycemic drug.
