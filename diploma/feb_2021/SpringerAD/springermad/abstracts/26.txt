Cancer pain is most commonly classified as nociceptive (somatic or visceral) or neuropathic. Different types of pain or pain syndromes are present in all phases of cancer (early and metastatic) and are inadequately treated in 56% to 82.3% of patients. Percutaneous neurolysis and neuromodulation are feasible and reproducible, efficient (70–80% success rate) and safe (≈ 0.5% mean complication rate) palliative therapies for pain reduction in oncologic patients with refractory pain. Percutaneous neurolysis can be performed either by injection of a chemical agent (phenol or alcohol) or by application of continuous radiofrequency or cryoablation. During chemical neurolysis nerve damage is achieved by means of Wallerian degeneration. A thorough knowledge of neural anatomy and pain transmission pathways is fundamental to appropriate patient and technique selection. Imaging guidance and strict asepsis are prerequisites. The purpose of this article is to describe the basic concepts of percutaneous neurolysis in oncologic patients. Controversies concerning techniques and products will be addressed. Finally, the necessity for an individually tailored approach for the selection of the different techniques and targets will be emphasized.
