The aims of this study were to assess what sociodemographic characteristics are associated with cancer worry and what the influence of cancer worry is on four cancer-related protective health behaviors. Data from the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) (4th cycle of the 4th iteration) were used. Multiple regression models were used for all analyses. Behaviors analyzed were as follows: physical activity, diets, smoking, and routine medical screening. Demographics controls included participant age, income, body mass index (BMI), race/ethnicity, and education. N = 2630, Older participants (OR = .99, p < .001), participants with higher BMI (OR = 1.01, p = .017), females (OR = 1.39, p < .001), and highly educated participants were more likely to worry about cancer. Cancer worry was not a significant predictor of exercise, healthy eating, or cancer screening behaviors. However, participants who worried about cancer were more likely to be current smokers (RRR = 1.20, p < .001) compared to participants who never smoked. Although, worry is only an emotional influence on health behavior and may be short-lived, the influence of worry on health-related decision making is likely to be lasting even when the emotions are no longer present.
