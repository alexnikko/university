Esophageal cancer is among the most aggressive gastrointestinal tract malignancies, and squamous cell carcinoma is the most common subtype. Although both autophagy and apoptosis involve programmed cell death, autophagy also maintains cell survival by recycling cellular waste. The relationship between autophagy and apoptosis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is unclear. Autophagic and apoptotic markers of ESCC were detected by immunohistochemical staining (IHC) in 43 ESCC patients treated during 2007â€“2011. Chi-square test and Kaplan-Meier method were used to determine how clinicopathological parameters were related to IHC results for LC3B, Beclin-1 and caspase-3 (CASP-3). Correlations among Beclin-1, LC3B, and CASP-3 were analyzed by Spearman rho. The statistical analyses revealed no clinicopathological parameters that significantly correlated with expressions of Beclin-1, LC3B, and CASP-3. However, low CASP-3 expression and high LC3B expression revealed by IHC were predictors of a poor prognosis. Additionally, LC3B expression had a significant negative correlation with CASP-3 expression. Autophagy is antagonistic to apoptosis and predicts poor overall survival in ESCC.
