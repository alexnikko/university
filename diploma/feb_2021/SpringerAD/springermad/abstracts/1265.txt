Primary Ewing sarcoma / primitive neuroectodermal tumor (ES) of the kidney is a rare neoplasm with limited clinicopathologic data. We report 23 such cases with no history of ES elsewhere in the body. The patients included 13 male and 10 female, aged 8–70 years (mean, 31 years). The average tumor size was 11.7 cm (range, 5–20 cm). Microscopic analysis showed predominantly lobular growth (n = 14), with focal papillary (n = 3), alveolar (n = 1), and hemangiopericytoma-like (n = 1) patterns. Several tumors (n = 11) exhibited robust mitotic activity (>10 mitoses/10 high-power fields). Necrosis (n = 13) and lymphovascular invasion (n = 14) were common. Homer Wright rosettes (n = 6) and perivascular pseudorosettes (n = 1) were also identified. The tumors invaded the renal sinus or perinephric fat (n = 11), renal vein (n = 13), and adrenal gland (n = 2). Molecular and fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis showed rearrangement of EWSR1 gene (10/10), associated with EWSR1-FLI1 gene fusion (7/10). All patients with follow-up information (n = 18) had metastasis, commonly in the lungs (n = 12) and bone (n = 6). Twelve patients died of disease in a mean of 21 months; 6 patients were alive at a mean of 49 months after diagnosis. Primary kidney ES usually present at an advanced stage with extrarenal spread and metastasis. Although renal ES share histologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular features with their bone and soft tissue counterparts, they appear to be more aggressive tumors with poorer clinical outcome.
