Electrofishing is commonly used by fishery scientists for collecting fishes. During such work, fishes are often exposed to air for several minutes which lead to deleterious impacts. The purpose of the current paper was to compare hematological and biochemical parameters of wild carp when electrofishing device was applied. Hematology and serum biochemical analyses were performed. The result showed significant differences (p < 0.05) in white blood cells (WBC), cortisol, glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin, and albumin-globulin ratio between control and treatment groups. Also, electrofishing caused an increase in cortisol, glucose, cholesterol, albumin, albumin-globulin ratio, Ca2+, and Cl− levels, but decreased lactate, triglyceride, total protein, globulin, Mg2+, and Na+ levels. It can be deduced from this study that electrofishing method for fish capture provide stressful condition which subsequently influential on body homeostasis through some biochemical factors.
