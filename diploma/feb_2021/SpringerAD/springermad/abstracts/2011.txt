Neonatal colon irritation (CI; pain or inflammation) given for 2 weeks prior to postnatal day 22 (PND22), causes long-lasting functional disorders in rats that can be seen 6 months after the initial insult. This study looked at the effect of varying the frequency and duration of neonatal CI on the rate of growth, digestive outcomes, exploratory activity, and colon and skin sensitivity in adult rats.
