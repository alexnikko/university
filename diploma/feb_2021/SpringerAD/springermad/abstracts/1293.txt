Protein phosphatase 1 Î± (PP1A) is an enzyme intimately associated with cell cycle, the over expression of which has been demonstrated in glioblastoma (GBM). Further, the nuclear expression of PP1A has been shown to be highly specific to GBM. In addition, PP1A has been shown to be a connecting molecule in the p53 containing GBM sub network. In view of these, we evaluated the prognostic relevance of PP1A.
