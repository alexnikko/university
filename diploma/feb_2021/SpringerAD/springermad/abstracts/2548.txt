This study was conducted to investigate the role of different homocysteine metabolism-related vitamin (HMRV) levels in the correlation between hyperhomocysteinemia (HHCY) and ischemic stroke (IS) subtypes. Three hundred and forty-eight IS patients manifesting different vascular subtypes were subclassified on the basis of HMRV deficiencies. Correlation between HHCY and IS subtypes was investigated in all the subgroups. In this study, HHCY was significantly correlated with the IS subtypes in large artery atherosclerosis (OR 1.126, 95%CI: 1.051 ~ 1.206, P = 0.001) and small artery occlusion (OR 1.105, 95%CI: 1.023 ~ 1.193, P = 0.012). Subgroup analysis revealed a correlation between HHCY and IS subgroup (OR 1.201, 1.178, 95%CI: 1.081 ~ 1.334, 1.058 ~ 1.313, P = 0.001, P = 0.003, respectively) in HMRV deficiency, but not significantly with the IS subgroup in normal HMRV levels. Serum vitamin B12 concentrations are inversely correlated with both IS subtypes in HMRV deficiency subgroups (OR 0.992, 0.995, 95%CI: 0.987 ~ 0.996, 0.991 ~ 0.999, P < 0.001, P = 0.007, respectively), which may contribute to HHCY incidence in these populations. The correlation between HHCY and IS subtypes is affected by HMRV levels in this case-control study. Our findings are helpful to understand the inconsistency in prior homocysteine studies. Serum vitamin B12 levels may play a critical role in HHCY incidence in this Chinese population.
