Fractal geometry is a relatively young mathematical concept, which has been gradually implemented in various fields of human activity. The focus of this article lies on using this powerful tool for monitoring and forecasting the water solubility of dihydroquercetin (DHQ) and its new forms, which were obtained by lyophilization with different coformers. DHQ, also known as taxifolin, is the major flavonoid of larch wood. This compound prevents the accumulation of free radicals and is characterized by a wide range of pharmacological effects. DHQ is produced industrially and is registered in Russia as an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API).
