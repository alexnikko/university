Guava (Psidium guajava Linn) is a common fruit tree in Nigeria with different species; the leaves, fruits, and the bark are often used in folklore for different medicinal purposes. However, there is a dearth of information on safety assessment of the leaves extract of guava from different species. These studies conducted toxicological evaluation of white, red, and pink guava leaves extract in rats for 14 days. Oral administration of 50, 500, and 5000 mg/kg BWT was carried out; they were observed for toxicity signs hourly for the first 6 h after administration, and every day of the experimental period. Clinical indicators, body weight differences, mortality, and biochemical parameters were examined during the experimental period. There were no deaths, a slight body weight increase was observed in the rats, and no clinical sign was noticed throughout the period of the experiment. There were no significant changes in the rat tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, and the serum liver indicator enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphate (ALP), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), bilirubin) and serum renal marker enzymes (creatinine, urea, uric acid, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN)) of rats administered when compared with the control. This entail that the NOAEL (no observed adverse effect level) estimate of white, red, and pink guava leaves extract is 50–5000 mg/kg.
