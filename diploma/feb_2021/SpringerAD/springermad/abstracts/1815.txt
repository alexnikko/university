The rate of patients with obesity has been rapidly increasing, and this imposes a heavy economic burden on health-care systems. Food decisions, under the influence of different internal and external factors, lie at the core of this increasing health problem. Due to the biological necessity to consume sufficient amounts of food and to correctly regulate energy expenditure, there are different systems that control food intake. This article first focuses on neurobiological and hormonal foundations and explains various metabolic short- and long-term signals, such as leptin, insulin, and ghrelin. We then also present genetic factors, which directly or indirectly (via other genes or environmental influences) may affect nutritional status. Since the consumption of high-caloric foods is accompanied by dopamine release and the activation of the brainâ€™s reward system, we will then present the interdependence of metabolic and reward systems. Last, we will present a neuroeconomic perspective that complements research on metabolic and hedonic feeding regulation.
