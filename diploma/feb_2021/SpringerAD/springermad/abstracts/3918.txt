Evolocumab, a novel human monoclonal antibody, inhibits proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, a protein that targets low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) receptors for the treatment of hyperlipidemia. The primary objective of this analysis was to characterize the population pharmacokinetics (popPK) and exposure–response relationship of evolocumab to assess if dose adjustment is needed across differing patient populations. Data were pooled for 5474 patients in 11 clinical studies who received evolocumab doses of 7–420 mg at various frequencies, either intravenously or subcutaneously. Evolocumab area under concentration–time curve from 8 to 12 weeks (AUCwk8–12) was simulated for individuals using the popPK model and was used to predict the LDL-C response in relation to AUCwk8–12. Evolocumab was eliminated through nonspecific (linear) and target-mediated (nonlinear) clearance. PopPK parameters and associated variabilities of evolocumab were similar to those of other monoclonal antibodies. The exposure–response model predicted a maximal 66% reduction in LDL-C from baseline to the mean of weeks 10 and 12 for doses of evolocumab 140 mg subcutaneously every 2 weeks or 420 mg subcutaneously once monthly. After inclusion of statistically significant covariates in an uncertainty-based simulation, LDL-C reduction from baseline at the mean of weeks 10 and 12 was predicted to be within 74% to 126% of the reference patient for all simulated patient groups. Evolocumab had nonlinear pharmacokinetics. The range of responses based on intrinsic and extrinsic factors was not predicted to be sufficiently different from the reference patient to warrant evolocumab dose adjustment.
