Porcine contagious pleuropneumonia is a highly fatal respiratory disease that is caused by Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (APP) and results in tremendous economic losses for the pig breeding industry worldwide. Previous studies have demonstrated that Propionibacterium acnes (PA) could effectively prevent APP infection in mice and pigs. The humoral immune response played a primary role during this process and anti-PA antibody could mediate macrophages to kill the bacteria. However, the role of neutrophils in this process is currently unknown. In this study, mice were injected with cyclophosphamide to deplete neutrophils and then passively immunized with anti-PA serum or negative serum. Mice were subsequently challenged with APP serotype 1. The results showed that the mice exhibited less bacterial colonization, less lung damage, and a high survival rate, which were immunized with the anti-PA antibody whether neutrophils were depleted or not. Worse still, the presence of neutrophils increased the damage to the mice after challenge. These results suggest that the activity of the anti-PA antibody against APP infection was independent of neutrophils. These findings have important significance for understanding the mechanisms of humoral immunity conferred by heterologous immunization and lay a good foundation for preventing APP infection.
