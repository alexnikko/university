Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) surrounds blood vessels and regulates vascular tone through paracrine secretion of cytokines. During conditions promoting cardiometabolic dysfunction, such as obesity, cytokine secretion is altered towards a proinflammatory and proatherogenic profile. Despite the clinical implications for cardiovascular disease, studies addressing the biology of human PVAT remain limited. We are interested in characterizing the resident adipose progenitor cells (APCs) because of their potential role in PVAT expansion during obesity. We also focused on proteins regulating paracrine interactions, including the small GTPase Rab27a, which regulates protein trafficking and secretion.
