What is the specific role of echocardiography in cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT)? CRT has proven to be highly effective for improving symptoms and survival of patients with advanced heart failure (HF) and wide QRS. However, a significant minority of patients do not respond favorably to CRT on the basis of standard clinical selection criteria, including the electrocardiographic QRS width. Subsequently, echocardiographic assessment of left ventricular (LV) dyssynchrony has been considered useful for CRT for selected responders, but findings by multicenter studies suggest that its predictive value was not sufficiently robust to replace routine selection criteria for CRT. A more recent approach, however, using speckle-tracking echocardiography yields more accurate quantification of regional wall contraction. Speckle-tracking approaches have therefore generated a great deal of interest about their clinical applications for CRT. Although reports on speckle tracking have not been included in any recommendations as to whether patients should undergo CRT based on the current guidelines, speckle tracking can play an important supplementary part in CRT on the basis of a case-by-case clinical decision for challenging cases. Here, we review the strengths of speckle-tracking methods, and their current potential for clinical use in CRT.
