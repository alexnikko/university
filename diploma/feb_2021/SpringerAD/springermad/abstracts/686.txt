The optimal treatment approach to patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), including those with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), has been extensively evaluated. Several trials of stable ischemic heart disease including patients with T2DM have demonstrated that medical management is comparable to revascularization in terms of mortality and rates of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). There has been a growing appreciation for optimal medical therapyâ€™s (OMT) role in improving clinical outcomes. It is vital to target T2DM patients to prevent or delay MACE events through advanced OMT, ultimately delaying if not avoiding the need for revascularization. There has been significant evolution in the development of pharmacologic management of T2DM patients. Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a new pharmacologic therapy with tremendous potential to alter clinical practice and influence practice guidelines. SGLT2-inhibitors have great potential in reducing MACE in patients with T2DM and CAD. Empagliflozin should be considered as a part of OMT among these patients. If results similar to the EMPA-REG OUTCOMES trial are replicated in other trials, the use of these pharmacologic agents as a part of OMT may narrow the gap between revascularization and OMT alone in patients with T2DM and multi-vessel disease. Future studies on the role of SLGT-2 inhibitors with regard to heart failure outcomes are needed to elucidate the mechanisms and clinical effects in this vulnerable population.
