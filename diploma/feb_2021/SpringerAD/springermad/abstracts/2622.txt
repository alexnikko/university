Two known types of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) including zoonotic CL due to Leishmania major and anthroponotic CL due to Leishmania tropica are prevalent in 14 of 22 countries located in the Eastern Mediterranean region including Iran. According to existing data, CL is endemic in Sabzevar City (northeast of Iran) and, because of the climatic conditions in this semi-desert region, is suitable for living vector/reservoir hosts of infection. The aim of our study was to identify the recent status of CL causative species in rural areas of Sabzevar County. Suspected patients of CL who were referred to health centers in suburban areas of Sabzevar and confirmed via microscopic observation of amastigotes were included in the study. Molecular identification of Leishmania species was done via nested PCR assay, based on amplification of kinetoplast minicircle fragments of L. major and L. tropica. In total, 153 patients including 89 males and 64 females were enrolled in this study. A high infection rate was reported in the autumn season (with a peak in October). Our findings revealed that L. major is responsible for 100% of infections. In addition, there was no association between CL and risk factors after statistical analysis. It seems that the infection pattern of CL is changing predominantly to L. major in most regions of Iran, which may be due to environmental changes, or ecological amendment and their effects on (vector/reservoir) host distribution in rural parts. Finally, controlling programs as well as promotion in public health systems should be considered in this area.
