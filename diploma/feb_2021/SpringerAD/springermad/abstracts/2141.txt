The pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is associated with the accumulation of aggregated forms of the α-synuclein (αSN) protein. An early event in the neuropathology of PD and DLB is the loss of synapses and a corresponding reduction in the level of synaptic proteins. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in synapse damage in these diseases are poorly understood. In this study the process of synapse damage was investigated by measuring the amount of synaptophysin, a pre-synaptic membrane protein essential for neurotransmission, in cultured neurons incubated with αSN, or with amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides that are thought to trigger synapse degeneration in Alzheimer's disease.
