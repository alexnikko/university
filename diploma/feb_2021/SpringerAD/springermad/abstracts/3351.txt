Drug combinations may elevate the risk of proarrhythmia. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether combinations of non-cardiovascular agents induce an additive increase in the proarrhythmic risk. In 12 female rabbit hearts, a drug combination of cotrimoxazole (300 µM), ondansetron (5 µM) and domperidone (1 µM) was infused after obtaining baseline data. In another 13 hearts, a combination of cotrimoxazole (300 µM), ondansetron (5 µM) and erythromycin (300 µM) was infused. Monophasic action potentials and ECG displayed a significant QT prolongation in all groups. This was accompanied by a significant increase in action potential duration. Of note, addition of each drug resulted in a further increase in the QT interval. Furthermore, a significant elevation of spatial dispersion of repolarization was observed. Lowering of potassium concentration in bradycardic AV-blocked hearts provoked early afterdepolarizations and torsade de pointes (TDP) in both study groups. Under baseline conditions, no episodes of TDP recorded. After administration of the first agent, TDP occurred in 5 of 12 hearts (37 episodes) and 5 of 13 hearts (26 episodes), respectively. After additional infusion of the second drug, TDP were recorded in 7 of 12 hearts (55 episodes) and 8 of 13 hearts (111 episodes). After additional infusion of the third drug, TDP occurred in 11 of 12 hearts (118 episodes) and 9 of 13 hearts (88 episodes). Combined treatment with several non-cardiovascular QT-prolonging agents resulted in a remarkable occurrence of proarrhythmia. An additive and significant prolongation of cardiac repolarization combined with an increased spatial dispersion of repolarization represents the underlying electrophysiological mechanism.
