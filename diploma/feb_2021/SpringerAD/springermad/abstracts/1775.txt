Rett syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a mutation in the X-linked MECP2 gene. Individuals with Rett syndrome typically develop normally until around 18Â months of age before undergoing a developmental regression, and the disorder can lead to cognitive, motor, sensory, and autonomic dysfunction. Understanding the mechanism of developmental regression represents a unique challenge when viewed through a neuroscience lens. Are circuits that were previously established erased, and are new ones built to supplant old ones? One way to examine circuit-level changes is with the use of electroencephalography (EEG). Previous studies of the EEG in individuals with Rett syndrome have focused on morphological characteristics, but few have explored spectral power, including power as an index of brain function or disease severity. This study sought to determine if EEG power differs in girls with Rett syndrome and typically developing girls and among girls with Rett syndrome based on various clinical characteristics in order to better understand neural connectivity and cortical organization in individuals with this disorder.
