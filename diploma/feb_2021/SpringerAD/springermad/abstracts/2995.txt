Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common malignant bone tumor in young adults and adolescents with approximately 3 million new cases annually. Due to the lack of sensitive and specific diagnostic biomarkers, although OS patients are curable after surgical resection, many patients suffer from metastasis or recurrence. This study aimed to investigate whether circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) could serve as biomarkers for the diagnosis of OS.
