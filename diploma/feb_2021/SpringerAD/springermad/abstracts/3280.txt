Quinine, a treatment used in chloroquine-resistant falciparum malaria, was loaded into poly(ɛ-caprolactone) or Eudragit® RS100 nanocapsules using Curcuma oil as the oil-based core. Until now, the effect of cationic nanocapsules on malaria has not been reported. A 24 factorial design was adopted using, as independent variables, the concentration of Curcuma oil, presence of quinine, type of polymer, and aqueous surfactant. Diameter, zeta potential, and pH were the responses studied. The formulations were also evaluated for drug content, encapsulation efficiency, photostability, and antimalarial activity against Plasmodium berghei-infected mice. The type of polymer influenced all of the responses studied. Quinine-loaded Eudragit® RS100 (F13) and PCL nanocapsules (F9), both with polysorbate 80 coating, showed nanometric particle size, positive zeta potential, neutral pH, high drug content, and quinine photoprotection ability; thus, these nanocapsules were selected for in vivo tests. Both formulations showed lower levels of parasitemia from the beginning of the experiment (5.78 ± 3.60 and 4.76 ± 3.46% for F9 and F13, respectively) and highest survival mean time (15.3 ± 2.0 and 14.9 ± 5.6 days for F9 and F13, respectively). F9 and F13 showed significant survival curve compared to saline, thus demonstrating that nanoencapsulation improved bioefficacy of QN and co-encapsulated curcuminoids, regardless of the surface charge.
