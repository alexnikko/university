Differentiation between benign and malignant ovarian neoplasms is essential to create a system for patient referrals. Therefore, tumor markers such as CA-125 and human epididymis protein 4 (HE-4) as well as the risk ovarian malignancy algorithm (ROMA) and risk malignancy index (RMI) values were considered individually and in combination to evaluate their utility in referral of women at a high risk of having an ovarian malignancy to cancer centers where multidisciplinary input is available.
