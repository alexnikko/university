A limitation of antibiotic treatments for P. aeruginosa (PA) chronic pulmonary infections is the reduced efficacy due to sub-therapeutic concentrations at the infection site and the development of biofilm. A novel approach to sustain ciprofloxacin (CIP) in the lungs after inhalation is to reduce its pulmonary absorption rate by its complexation with copper (CIP-Cu). This study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial action of cationic CIP-Cu complex in PA biofilms in terms of drug concentration and time. Two PA strains, PA01 and PA14, were grown to form biofilm layers in equilibrium with planktonic cells. Static parameters such as pyoverdine production by planktonic cells, enzymatic activity within biofilms, and biofilm biomass 24Â h after the addition of CIP or CIP-Cu were evaluated. Also, the kinetic effects of CIP and CIP-Cu on biofilms were evaluated by bioluminescence kinetics using transgenic strains. No differences were observed between CIP and CIP-Cu in terms of efficacy against biofilms, validating the potential of using this complex to treat PA biofilms. Interestingly, CIP concentrations slightly below the MIC value against planktonic bacteria stimulated both virulence and biofilm PA01 production. These results support the need to accurately achieve high CIP concentration in the lungs, which can be more easily achieved by pulmonary delivery of advanced CIP formulations (CIP-metal complexes or liposomal CIP) instead of the oral administration of free CIP.
