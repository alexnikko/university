Diabetes mellitus (DM) affects nearly 30 million Americans and carries an increased risk of macrovascular complications of myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death. While aggressive cardiovascular risk factor reduction has long been advocated in patients with diabetes, clinical trials have only recently demonstrated that such reductions result in improved outcomes. This review discusses recent evidence for risk reduction strategies and therapies with a focus on the management of glycemia, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Although the degree to which aggressive glycated hemoglobin reduction decreases the risk of macrovascular outcomes remains unclear, the use of specific agents, such as the newer sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists, may reduce cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes, irrespective of glycated hemoglobin reduction. Statins have been the mainstay of dyslipidemia management, with recent guidelines recommending statin use in all patients aged 40–75 years with diabetes. There is an emerging role for the recently developed proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors in diabetes, as these agents further reduce serum cholesterol and clinical cardiovascular events beyond the maximum tolerated statin therapy. Lastly, most evidence suggests that aggressive blood pressure lowering in diabetic patients with hypertension reduces macrovascular events. Recent studies have re-affirmed a goal blood pressure of 140/90, and a lower pressure is likely prudent in most patients with diabetes. Specifically, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with diabetes beyond their blood pressure-lowering effect. In conclusion, there is a growing literature which shows that the risk of cardiovascular outcomes can be reduced in most patients with diabetes, as outlined in this review.
