The transmembrane receptor molecule CD31 is known to have immunomodulatory functions, suggesting a possible neuroprotective effect in the context of acute ischemic stroke by restricting an over-activation of secondary immunological processes. This study examines the density of CD31+ cells in mechanically extracted thrombi of stroke patients with the aim to test whether the occurrence of CD31+ cells was associated with a beneficial clinical outcome in those patients.
