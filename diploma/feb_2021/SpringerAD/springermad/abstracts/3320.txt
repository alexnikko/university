Pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) is a high-molecular zinc-binding metalloproteinase that was first detected in the serum of pregnant women. It can also be detected in men and non-pregnant women. Recently, a growing interest in determining the concentration of PAPP-A as a marker of oxidative stress and atherosclerotic processes has been observed. Among the factors that could potentially influence the PAPP-A formation is the exposure to tobacco smoke. Some components of tobacco smoke have an immediate effect on the body and also direct influence on the cardiovascular system. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relation between PAPP-A concentration and either passive or active exposure to tobacco smoke in the population of medicine students (n = 152). The relation between PAPP-A concentration and chosen markers of inflammatory response and anti-oxidative processes was analyzed. The samples of serum, urine, and saliva were collected and main nicotine metabolites in urine samples were determined using ELISA technique. Comparison of the PAPP-A concentrations in the study group revealed that in the group of active smokers, the concentration of the protein was significantly higher than in the group of passive smokers (p = .04) and the group of not-exposed students (p = .006). PAPP-A concentration showed significant positive correlation with the values of FRAP and main nicotine metabolites. The evident influence of both active and passive tobacco smoke exposure on PAPP-A levels in the studied population of young people who in general are not included in the group of high-risk cardiovascular incidents, shows how important early prevention of anti-health behaviors is.
