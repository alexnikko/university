Aging process is accompanied by a chronic sub-clinical systemic inflammation. This study aimed to assess the association between hearing impairment and polymorphisms of genes encoding cytokines deeply-committed to the inflammatory response and immune homeostasis in an elderly Japanese population. Data were collected in the Longitudinal Study of Aging surveyed biennially between 1997 and 2010. The participants without any missing information at baseline were 1,957 individuals, and the gross accumulated number of 8,675 subjects (40–89 years of age) was analyzed. Two hearing impairment criteria were taken as the better ear pure-tone average (PTABE) greater than 25 dB and greater than 40 dB. We analyzed cumulative data using generalized estimating equations to investigate the effect of 9 polymorphisms, namely, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α, rs1800630; TNF receptor super family (TNFRSF) 1B, rs1061624; interleukin (IL)-1A, rs1800587; IL-1B, rs16944; IL-4R, rs1801275; IL-6, rs1800796; IL-10, rs1800872; IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), rs1059702; C reactive protein (CRP), rs1130864.
