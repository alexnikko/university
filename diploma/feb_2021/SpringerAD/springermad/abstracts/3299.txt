Parenteral delivery remains a compelling drug delivery route for both large- and small-molecule drugs and can bypass issues encountered with oral absorption. For injectable drug products, there is a strong patient preference for subcutaneous administration due to its convenience over intravenous infusion. However, in subcutaneous injection, in contrast to intravenous administration, the formulation is in contact with an extracellular matrix environment that behaves more like a gel than a fluid. This can impact the expected performance of a formulation. Since typical bulk fluid dissolution studies do not accurately simulate the subcutaneous environment, improved in vitro models to help better predict the behavior of the formulation are critical. Herein, we detail the development of a new model system consisting of a more physiologically relevant gel phase to simulate the rate of drug release and diffusion from a subcutaneous injection site using agarose hydrogels as a tissue mimic. This is coupled with continuous real-time data collection to accurately monitor drug diffusion. We show how this in vitro model can be used as an in vivo performance differentiator for different formulations of both large and small molecules. Thus, this model system can be used to improve optimization and understanding of new parenteral drug formulations in a rapid and convenient manner.
