Early detection of pulmonary hypertension (PH) is essential to ensure that patients receive timely and appropriate treatment for this progressive disease. Rest and exercise echocardiography has been used to screen patients in an attempt to identify early stage PH. However, current PH guidelines recommend against exercise tests because of the lack of evidence. We reviewed previous studies to discuss the current standpoint concerning rest and exercise echocardiography in PH. Around 20 exercise echocardiography studies were included to assess the cutoff value for exercise-induced pulmonary hypertension (EIPH). Approximately 40 exercise echocardiography studies were also included to evaluate the pulmonary artery pressure-flow relationship as assessed by the slope of the mean pulmonary artery pressure and cardiac output (ΔmPAP/ΔQ). There were several EIPH and ΔmPAP/ΔQ reference values in individuals with pulmonary vascular disease. We believed that assessing the ΔmPAP/ΔQ makes sense from a physiological standpoint, and the clinical value should be confirmed in future studies. Exercise echocardiography is an appealing alternative in PH. Further studies are needed to assess the prognostic value of the pulmonary artery pressure-flow relationship in high-risk subjects.
