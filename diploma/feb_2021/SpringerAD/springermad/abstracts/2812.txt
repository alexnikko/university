Although preoperative chemoradiation has shown to improve surgical outcomes in both loco-regional control and long term survival; it has still not become the standard of care in many centers. There is reluctance in accepting preoperative chemoradiation primarily due to fear of increased perioperative morbidity/mortality or non-availability of infrastructure and expertise. We present a retrospective analysis of our results of radical esophagectomy after neoadjuvant chemoradiation. All patients who underwent Radical Esophagectomy from January 2009 to December 2013 by a single surgical team at our institute were included in the series (n = 118). Patients undergoing surgery after chemo-radiation (group A = 66) were compared with those under going upfront surgery (group B = 52) in terms of patient variables (age, sex, comorbidities, tumor location, staging, histology) and postoperative surgical outcomes and complications using Chi square test. Overall and disease free survival was analyzed using Kaplan Meir curve. There was no difference in duration of surgery, postoperative stay and overall morbidity and mortality in both groups. Although group A patients had more of advanced cases clinically, but histopathology showed complete pathological response (pCR) in nearly 40 % patients and negative nodes (pN0) in 62.5 % patients. OS and DFS showed a trend towards better survival with preoperative chemoradiation. We conclude that radical esophagectomy after preoperative chemoradiation is feasible and safe in developing countries. Moreover pathological complete response correlates well with improved survival. Randomized control trials may be required to further substantiate the results.
