In our previous study, proteomics analyses of host cells infected with Eimeria tenella sporozoites coupled with isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation, identified several host proteins related to Eimeria invasion. In this study, A 458-bp Gallus gallus fatty acid–binding protein 4 (FABP4) gene was cloned and subcloned to pET-28c(+) vector to construct the prokaryotic recombinant expression plasmid pET-28c(+)–FABP4. The 18.5 kDa recombinant FABP4 protein (rFABP4) was expressed and identified by western blotting. Expression of FABP4 in E. tenella sporozoite–infected DF-1 cells was downregulated significantly than in non-infected cells detected by western blotting and immunohistochemistry. The antibody inhibition assay showed that antibodies against FABP4 at 50, 100, 200, 300, and 400 μg/mL had no significant effect on sporozoite invasion. BMS-309403 and transforming growth factor-β3 (TGF-β3) was used to inhibit and improve the expression of FABP4 in DF-1 cells, respectively, and their effect on the sporozoite invasion of cells was detected by flow cytometry. Sporozoite invasion rate in the BMS-309403-treated group was not significantly affected; however, the invasion rate in the TGF-β3-treated group declined significantly. These results show that host FABP4 plays a negative role in Eimeria invasion. However, further studies are needed to elucidate the exact mechanism of how FABP4 negatively regulates Eimeria invasion.
