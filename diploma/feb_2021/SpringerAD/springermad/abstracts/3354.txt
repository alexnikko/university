The aim is to investigate the association of fasting serum bilirubin (FSB) levels with the prognosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). A total of 450 hospitalized patients with CAD undergoing PCI were enrolled. The clinical data including FSB levels, basic biochemical indices, and traditional cardiovascular risk factors were recorded after admission, and all patients were followed up for 2.17 ± 0.67 years. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). The 450 patients were divided into three groups based on their FSB levels: high FSB group (≥12.00 μmol/L; n = 158), intermediate FSB group (8.54–11.99 μmol/L; n = 141), and low FSB group (≤8.53 μmol/L; n = 151). A total of 118 MACEs were identified during the follow-up. Multivariate cox regression analysis showed that a decreased FSB level was an independent predictor of MACE in CAD patients (RR = 0.858, 95% CI 0.813–0.906, P = 0.001) post-PCI. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis suggested that the patients with low FSB tended to have a decreased MACE-free survival (log-rank test, χ2 = 34.65, P = 0.001). The baseline level of FSB is an independent predictor for clinical outcomes in post-PCI CAD patients.
