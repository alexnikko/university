The anion channel protein band 3 is the main target of the pathogenic red blood cells (RBC) autoantibodies in New Zealand black (NZB) mice. CD4 T cells from NZB mice with autoimmune hemolytic anemia respond to band 3. Previously, we have shown that IL-10 and peptides containing a dominant T cell epitope from red cell band 3 modulate autoimmune hemolytic anemia in NZB mice. Because of the immunoregulatory role of IL-10 in autoimmune diseases, we aim to identify individual band 3 peptides that induce high IL-10 production and simultaneously suppress CD4 T cell proliferation and to investigate the effect intranasal administration of IL-10 producing band 3 peptides on autoantibody responses of NZB mice.
