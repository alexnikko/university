Osteoarthritis (OA) is a worldwide joint disease with clinically loss of motion and pain in human. The conventional treatments are associated with essential side effects. In folk medicine, Shilajit is applied for treatment of arthritis and bone fractures. The present study evaluated effect of Shilajit on the osteoarthritis in rat model. Thirty-six adult male rats were randomly divided into two groups including OA and treated with Shilajit groups. OA was induced by injection of monosodium iodoacetate in the articular space of femorotibial joint. Aqueous extract of Shilajit was given to the treatment group by gavage as daily during experimental course until 21 days. The joint samples were investigated 7, 14, and 21 days post induction. The main macroscopic changes in the affected joints were swelling and congestion at early stages. Histopathologic study showed surface irregularity, erosion and fissures, necrotic chondrocytes, depletion of toluidine blue staining, and lysis of subchondral bone in both OA and Shilajit groups after 7 and 14 days. Synovium revealed synovial cells hyperplasia and inflammatory cells infiltration. Moderate to advanced OA was seen in both groups without significant difference. After 21 days, histopathologic scores of destructive damages and synovitis were reduced in the Shilajit group and showed significant difference in compare to OA group. The present study shows that aqueous extract of Shilajit decreased cartilage degenerative changes in knee osteoarthritis. Also, it reduced inflammatory reactions in synovial membrane.
