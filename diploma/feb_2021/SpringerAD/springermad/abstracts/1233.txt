Blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 engagement to reinvigorate T cell activity is supposed to be a potential therapeutic scheme. Studies have verified the participation of PD-1/PD-L1 in hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein-regulated immune response. To determine the roles of PD-1/PD-L1 signal pathway in HCV F protein-induced immunoreaction in chronic HCV infection, variations in T cells were examined. The results showed that PD-1 expression on CD8+ and CD4+ T cells was increased with HCV F stimulation in both chronic HCV patients and healthy controls, and could be reduced partly by PD-1/PD-L1 blocking. Additionally, by PD-1/PD-L1 blocking, HCV F-induced inhibition of T cell proliferation and promotion of cellular apoptosis were partly or even totally recovered. Furthermore, levels of both Th1 and Th2 cytokines were elevated in the presence of anti-PD-L1 antibody. All these results indicated that PD-1/PD-L1 signal pathway also participates in HCV F protein-induced immunoregulation. PD-1/PD-L1 blocking plays important roles in the restoration of effective functionality of the impaired T cells in chronic HCV patients.
