A 67-year-old Japanese female with back pain and severe cachexia visited our hospital. The diagnosis was disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex infection (dMAC) with multiple bone involvement. Anti-mycobacterial chemotherapy was started, but fever persisted and dislocation of cervical vertebrae has made her bedridden. Because anti-interferon (IFN)-γ autoantibody was positive, four doses of rituximab 375 mg/m2, every 7 day, were administered. Soon after treatment, progression of osteolytic lesions and wasting has stopped. We proved that rituximab has recovered IFN-γ signaling as shown by IFN-γ-induced STAT1 phosphorylation. It can be a promising option for dMAC cases with anti-IFN-γ autoantibody.
