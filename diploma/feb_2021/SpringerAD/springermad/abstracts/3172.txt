 Throughout the life cycle of a biotechnological drug product, changes and improvements of manufacturing processes are common. It is required by the regulatory bodies that manufacturers establish adequate and appropriate comparability between pre-change and post-change products. The goals of comparability assessments are to demonstrate the comparability and consistency of product quality before and after change and to demonstrate that the changes do not have an adverse effect on safety and efficacy of the drug products.
