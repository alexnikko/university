Previous clinical trials have already demonstrated that combinations of two or more drugs were more effective in the cancer treatment, especially sequential photodynamic design combing with sequential chemotherapy. In our study, we propose a ternary cocktail NP delivery system based on self-decomposable NPs, which could realize synergistic chemo-photodynamic therapy through double loading chemo-drugs and multi-level programmable PDT treatment.
