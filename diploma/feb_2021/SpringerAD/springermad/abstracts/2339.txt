Synaptic dysfunction and intracellular transport defects are early events in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Extracellular amyloid β (Aβ) oligomers cause spine alterations and impede the transport of proteins and organelles such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and mitochondria that are required for synaptic function. Meanwhile, intraneuronal accumulation of Aβ precedes its extracellular deposition and is also associated with synaptic dysfunction in AD. However, the links between intracellular Aβ, spine alteration, and mechanisms that support synaptic maintenance such as organelle trafficking are poorly understood.
