The Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are group of inherited metabolic diseases caused by the deficiency of enzymes required to degrade glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in the lysosomes. GAGs are sulfated polysaccharides involving repeating disaccharides, uronic acid and hexosamines including chondroitin sulfate (CS), dermatan sulfate (DS), heparan sulfate (HS) and keratan sulfate (KS). Hyaluronan is excluded in terms of being non-sulfated in the GAG family. Different types of mutations have been identified as the causative agent in all types of MPS. Herein, we planned to investigate the pathogenic mutations in different types of MPS including type I (IDUA gene), IIIA (SGSH) and IIIB (NAGLU) in the eight Iranian patients. Autozygosity mapping was performed to identify the potential pathogenic variants in these 8 patients indirectly with the clinical diagnosis of MPSs. so three panels of STR (Short Tandem Repeat) markres flanking IDUA, SGSH and NAGLU genes were selected for multiplex PCR amplification. Then in each family candidate gene was sequenced to identify the pathogenic mutation. Our study showed two novel mutations c.469 T > C and c.903C > G in the IDUA gene, four recurrent mutations: c.1A > C in IDUA, c.220C > T, c.1298G > A in SGSH gene and c.457G > A in the NAGLU gene. The c.1A > C in IDUA was the most common mutation in our study. In silico analysis were performed as well to predict the pathogenicity of the novel variants.
