Prevention of coccidiosis is one of the best ways of controlling disease. Therefore, the present study was carried out to evaluate the protective effect of ultraviolet (UV)-irradiated sporulated oocysts of Eimeria species against coccidiosis in layer chickens. One hundred forty-four one-day-old layer chicks were randomly divided into 4 groups (n = 36), including non-immunized/non-challenged negative control group (NC group), non-immunized/challenged control group (NIC group), non-irradiated sporulated oocyst/challenged group (CA group), and UV-irradiated sporulated oocyst/challenged (UV group). At the age of 4 days, chickens in groups UV and CA were both orally inoculated with 1.0 × 104 UV-irradiated and non-irradiated sporulated oocysts of Eimeria species, respectively. Chickens in groups NIC and NC were served as positive and negative controls, respectively. Chickens in all groups were orally challenged with 7.5 × 104 sporulated oocysts of Eimeria species except the NC group at the age of 21 days. The results revealed that chicks receiving UV-irradiated sporulated oocysts had no signs of illness with minimal or no changes in the cecal integrity and a significantly lower oocyst shedding (OPG) than in the NIC group. Additionally, the cytokine gene expression profiles were evaluated. Expression levels of IL-2, IL-12, and IFN-γ were significantly higher in the spleen of chicks in the UV and CA groups than in the NC group post-challenge. As expected, treatment with irradiated oocysts resulted in a significant reduction in oocyst shedding and maintenance of cecal mucosal integrity. Furthermore, the body weight was higher in chickens inoculated with UV-irradiated oocysts than their non-irradiated counterparts. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that inoculation with UV-irradiated sporulated oocysts of Eimeria species can produce a substantial reduction in infection symptoms.
