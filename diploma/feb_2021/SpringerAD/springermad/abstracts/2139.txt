Recently, several lines of evidence have shown the aberrant expression of cell-cycle-related proteins and tumor suppressor proteins in vulnerable neurons of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain and transgenic mouse models of AD; these proteins are associated with various paradigms of neuronal death. It has been reported that ATBF1 induces cell cycle arrest associated with neuronal differentiation in the developing rat brain, and that gene is one of the candidate tumor suppressor genes for prostate and breast cancers in whose cells overexpressed ATBF1 induces cell cycle arrest. However, the involvement of ATBF1 in AD pathogenesis is as yet unknown.
