In this study, we developed a systemic PD model in middle-aged cynomolgus monkeys using individualized low-dose MPTP, to explore effective indicators for the early prediction of clinical outcomes. MPTP was not stopped until the animals showed typical PD motor symptoms on days 10 to 13 after MPTP administration when the Kurlan score reached 10; this abrogated the differences in individual susceptibility to MPTP. The clinical symptoms persisted, peaking on days 3 to 12 after MPTP withdrawal (rapid progress stage), and then the Kurlan score plateaued. A Kurlan score at the end of the rapid progress stage >15 reflected stable or slowly-progressive PD, while a score <15 indicated spontaneous recovery. The entire clinical evolution and outcome of the systemic PD model was characterized in this study, thus providing options for therapeutic and translational research.
