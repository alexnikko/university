We have recently described a novel therapeutic antibody product (IL2–F8–TNFmut), featuring the simultaneous fusion of murine IL2 and of a TNF mutant with scFv(F8), an antibody specific to the alternatively-spliced extra domain A of fibronectin (EDA). Here, we report on the in vivo characterization of the anti-cancer activity of IL2–F8–TNFmut in four immunocompetent murine models of cancer, CT26, WEHI-164, F9 teratocarcinoma and Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC), using the product alone or in combination with a monoclonal antibody specific to murine PD-L1. All four models exhibited a strong expression of EDA-fibronectin, which was confined to vascular structures for F9 tumors, while the other three malignancies exhibited a more stromal pattern of staining. A complete and long-lasting tumor eradication of CT26 and WEHI-164 tumors was observed in BALB/c mice when IL2–F8–TNFmut was used in combination with PD-L1 blockade. The combination treatment led to improved tumor growth inhibition in 129/SvEv mice bearing murine teratocarcinoma or in C57BL/6 mice bearing murine LLC, but those cancer cures were difficult to achieve in those models. A microscopic analysis of tumor sections, obtained 24 h after pharmacological treatment, revealed that the PD-L1 antibody had homogenously reached tumor cells in vivo and that the combination of PD-L1 blockade with IL2–F8–TNFmut stimulated an influx of NK cells and of T cells into the neoplastic mass. These data indicate that potency-matched dual-cytokine fusion proteins may be ideally suited to potentiate the therapeutic activity of immune check-point inhibitors.
