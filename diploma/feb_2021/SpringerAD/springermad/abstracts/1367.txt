Sand flies were collected in a location from Romania in order to estimate their abundance and seasonal variation in correlation with environmental and anthropic factors. From May to October 2017, eight premises with different animal species were sampled for sand flies in a household from Fundătura village, Vaslui County, in North-Eastern Romania. Animal-related data, shelter-related data, and climatic parameters were recorded. All (n = 150) collected sand flies were Phlebotomus perfiliewi. A mono-modal type of abundance trend has been recorded (a single peak at the beginning of August). The first day of capture was in mid-July. The total number of females during the peak season was significantly higher than the total number of males. The highest percentage of males was recorded at the beginning and at the end of the sand fly activity. Only the traps placed in the poultry enclosure built from clay and wood were positive. A strong positive correlation was recorded between the total number of collected sand flies and the minimum and the maximum temperature. The analysis of the climatic data shows that the first presence of sand flies was registered only after the average minimum temperature for the previous 7 days was above 15 °C.
