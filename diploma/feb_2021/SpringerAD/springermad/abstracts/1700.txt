Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is a polyglutamine disease that progressively affects the cerebellum, brainstem, and retina. SCA7 is quite rare, and insights into biomarkers and pre-clinical phases are still missing. We aimed to describe neurologic and ophthalmological findings observed in symptomatic and pre-symptomatic SCA7 subjects. Several neurologic scales, visual acuity, visual fields obtained by computer perimetry, and macular thickness in optical coherence tomography (mOCT) were measured in symptomatic carriers and at risk relatives. Molecular analysis of the ATXN7 was done blindly in individuals at risk. Thirteen symptomatic carriers, 3 pre-symptomatic subjects, and 5 related controls were enrolled. Symptomatic carriers presented scores significantly different from those of controls in most neurologic and ophthalmological scores. Gradual changes from controls to pre-symptomatic and then to symptomatic carriers were seen in mean (SD) of visual fields − 1.34 (1.15), − 2.81 (1.66). and − 9.56 (7.26); mOCT − 1.11 (2.6), − 3.48 (3.54), and − 7.73 (2.56) Z scores; and “Spinocerebellar Ataxia Functional Index (SCAFI)” − 1.16 (0.28), 0.65 (0.56), and − 0.61 (0.44), respectively. Visual fields and SCAFI were significantly correlated with time to disease onset (pre-symptomatic)/disease duration (symptomatic carriers). Visual fields, mOCT, and SCAFI stood out as candidates for state biomarkers for SCA7 since pre-symptomatic stages of disease.
