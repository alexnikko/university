High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) has long been referred to as ‘good cholesterol’ due to its apparent inverse relationship with future CVD risk. More recent research has questioned a causal role for HDL-c in this relationship, however, as both genetic studies and numerous large-scale randomised controlled trials have found no evidence of a cardiovascular protective effect when HDL-c levels are raised. Instead, focus has switched to the functional properties of the HDL particle. Evidence suggests that both the composition and function of HDL may be significantly altered in the context of an inflammatory milieu, transforming the particle from a vasoprotective anti-atherogenic particle to a noxious pro-atherogenic equivalent. This review will summarise evidence relating HDL to CVD risk, explore recent evidence characterising changes in the composition and function of HDL that may occur in chronic inflammatory diseases, and discuss the potential for future HDL-modifying therapeutic interventions.
