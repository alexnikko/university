Oncology education for post-graduate medical trainees is mostly clinic-based with didactic lectures. However, a 3–4-week rotation lacks full exposure to the vast field of oncology, resulting in an educational gap. We felt there is a need for a standard curriculum to educate trainees on common oncology topics and encourage self-directed learning. This study aims to improve knowledge of oncology in trainees through the use of an oncology educational tool (consisting of a handbook and website) that we developed and evaluated. Fifty-three post-graduate trainees (years 1, 2, and 3) consented to participate at the start of their oncology rotation. In phase I, four participants took part in a usability evaluation of the tool. In phase II, 39 trainees underwent a knowledge assessment with use of the tool. Baseline and post-intervention test results were compared using paired t tests. In the qualitative study (phase III), 10 trainees provided feedback on the updated tool and overall rotation experience. Issues identified from phase I were addressed prior to subsequent phases. Phase II analysis of complete sets of data found the mean post-intervention scores (9.44/10) were significantly higher (p < 0.001) than the mean baseline scores (7.47/10). In the qualitative study, feedback strongly supported the integration of the tool for improving knowledge of trainees. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that an oncology educational tool for medical trainees improves oncology knowledge by providing a standard curriculum. Future work involves evaluating this tool to determine if effects are from the education tool or rotation experience.
