It has been hypothesized that microstents which are used to prevent coil protrusion in the treatment of cerebral aneurysms may have flow diverting and therefore occlusive effects. In a rabbit elastase aneurysm model, we investigated the aneurysm occlusion rate and vessel reaction of a braided Accero stent prototype with porosity in the lower range of other available (non-flow-diverter) microstents.
