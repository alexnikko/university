Narcolepsy is a rare disease that entails excessive daytime sleepiness, often associated with sudden episodes of muscle weakness known as cataplexy. Narcolepsy with cataplexy (NC) is due to the loss of hypothalamic neurons that release the neuropeptides orexin A and B. Orexin neuron projections prominently target brain structures involved in wake-sleep state switching and the central autonomic network. This review provides an updated summary of the links between NC and autonomic cardiovascular dysfunction from a translational perspective. The available evidence suggests that, compared with control subjects, the heart rate in patients and animal models with NC is variable during wakefulness and normal to high during sleep. Responses of the heart rate to internal stimuli (arousal from sleep, leg movements during sleep, defense response) are blunted. These alterations result from orexin deficiency and, at least during wakefulness before sleep, involve decreased parasympathetic modulation of the heart rate. On the other hand, NC in patients and animal models is associated with a blunted fall in arterial blood pressure from wakefulness to sleep, and particularly to the REM state, coupled to a variable decrease in arterial blood pressure during wakefulness. The former effect is caused, at least in part, by deranged control of the heart, whereas the latter may be due to decreased vasoconstrictor sympathetic activity. Systematic studies are warranted to help clarify whether and how the links between NC and autonomic dysfunction impact on the cardiovascular risk of patients with narcolepsy.
