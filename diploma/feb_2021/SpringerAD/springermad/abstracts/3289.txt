A great attention is presently paid to the design of drug delivery vehicles based on surface-modified magnetic nanoparticles. They can, in principle, be directed to a desired target area for releasing their drug payload, a process triggered by pH, temperature, radiation, or even magnetic field. To this, the possibility of forming part of diagnostic tools by enhanced magnetic resonance imaging or that of further treatment by magnetic hyperthermia can be added. Bare particles are rapidly eliminated from the bloodstream by the phagocyte mononuclear system, leading to short biological half-life. It is hence required to coat them in order to increase their biocompatibility and facilitate the drug incorporation. In this work, magnetite nanoparticles were coated with poly(butylcyanoacrylate) (PBCA) manufactured and characterized with regard to their physical properties and their suitability as a platform for magnetically controlled drug delivery. The average diameter of magnetite and core–shell nanoparticles was 97 ± 19 and 140 ± 20 nm, respectively. Infrared analysis, electrophoretic mobility, surface thermodynamics analysis, and X-ray diffraction all confirmed that the magnetic particles were sufficiently covered by the polymer in the composite nanoparticles. In addition, assays using normal (CCD-18 and MCF-10A) and tumoral (T-84 and MCF-7) cell lines derived from colon and breast tissue, respectively, demonstrated that nanocomposites have low or negligible cytotoxicity. It is concluded that PBCA-coated magnetite core–shell nanoparticles represent a remarkable promise as a platform for magnetically controlled drug delivery.
