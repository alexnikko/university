Uterine carcinosarcoma (UCS) is a relatively rare and very aggressive tumor. The predictors of survival for patients with UCS have not been determined clearly yet. The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible predictors of disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) for patients with UCS.
