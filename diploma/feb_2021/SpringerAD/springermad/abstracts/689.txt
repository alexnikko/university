The Statin-Associated Muscle Symptom Clinical Index (SAMS-CI) is a method for assessing the likelihood that a patientâ€™s muscle symptoms (e.g., myalgia or myopathy) were caused or worsened by statin use. The objectives of this study were to prepare the SAMS-CI for clinical use, estimate its inter-rater reliability, and collect feedback from physicians on its practical application.
