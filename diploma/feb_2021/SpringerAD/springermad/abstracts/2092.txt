Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) inhibition may be a promising therapeutic strategy for acute stroke treatment, given its potential to prolong the biological half-life of neuroprotective substrates. A related protease, fibroblast activation protein (FAP), was recently shown to inactivate the same substrates. Therefore, it should also be investigated as a potential target in stroke. The study aimed to investigate whether stroke severity and outcome correlate with DPPIV and FAP activities and their kinetics shortly after acute ischemic stroke. DPPIV and FAP activities were analyzed in the serum of 50 hyperacute stroke patients at admission, 1 day, 3 days, and 7 days after stroke onset and in 50 age-matched healthy controls. This was done as part of the Middelheim’s Interdisciplinary Stroke Study. DPPIV activity tended to increase shortly after stroke compared to the control population. DPPIV and FAP activities steadily decreased in the first week after stroke onset. Higher infarct volumes (≥5 ml) and a more severe stroke (NIHSS >7) at admission were correlated with a stronger decrease in the activities of both enzymes. Moreover, these patients more often developed a progressive stroke, were more often institutionalized. Patients with a stronger increase in DPPIV activity at admission and decrease in the activity of both DPPIV and FAP during the first week after stroke onset had a more severe stroke and worse short-term outcomes.
