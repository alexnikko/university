Apolipoprotein E (apoE) receptors act as signaling molecules in neurons, altering phosphorylation of numerous proteins after extracellular ligand binding and affecting neurite outgrowth, synapse formation, and neuronal migration. Since apoE is important in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), we tested whether apoE treatment of neurons affected molecules important to phosphorylation of tau, such as GSK 3β, P35, and CDK5, and the phosphorylation of tau itself. Treatment of primary neurons with 2 uM apoE (or an apoE-derived peptide) decreased levels of phospho-GSK 3β, P35 and CDK5, and decreased levels of phosphorylated forms of tau. A lower concentration of apoE (100 nM) had no effect on these molecules. The alteration of tau phosphorylation by apoE was blocked by an inhibitor of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family, demonstrating the effects were due to receptor interactions. These results demonstrate that apoE affects several downstream signaling cascades in neurons: decreased tau kinases phosphorylation and inhibition of tau phosphorylation at Thr171 and Ser202/Thr205 epitopes. We conclude that apoE can alter levels of tau kinases and phospho-tau epitopes, potentially affecting tau neuropathological changes seen in AD brains.
