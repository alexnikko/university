Accurate characterization of exposure–response relationship of clinical endpoints is important in drug development to identify optimal dose regimens. Endpoints with ≥ 10 ordered categories are typically analyzed as continuous. This manuscript aims to show circumstances where it is advantageous to analyze such data as ordered categorical. The results of continuous and categorical analyses are compared in a latent-variable based Indirect Response modeling framework for the longitudinal modeling of Mayo scores, ranging from 0 to 12, which is commonly used as a composite endpoint to measure the severity of ulcerative colitis (UC). Exposure response modeling of Mayo scores is complicated by the fact that studies typically include induction and maintenance phases with re-randomizations and other response-driven dose adjustments. The challenges are illustrated in this work by analyzing data collected from 3 phase II/III trials of golimumab in patients with moderate-to-severe UC. Visual predictive check was used for model evaluations. The ordered categorical approach is shown to be accurate and robust compared to the continuous approach. In addition, a disease progression model with an empirical bi-phasic rate of onset was found to be superior to the commonly used placebo model with one onset rate. An application of this modeling approach in guiding potential dose-adjustment was illustrated.
