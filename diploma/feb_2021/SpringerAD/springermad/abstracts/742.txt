Immunodeficiency is one of the key features of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (del), and it is seen in approximately 75% of the patients. The degree of immunodeficiency varies widely, from no circulating T cells to normal T cell counts. It has been hypothesized that the low number of T cells may at least in part be due to increased apoptosis of T cells. Increased spontaneous T cell apoptosis has been reported in one patient with 22q11.2del, but this has not been further investigated.
