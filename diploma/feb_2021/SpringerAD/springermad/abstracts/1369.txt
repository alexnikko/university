Myxozoans are economically important cnidarian endoparasites. Members of this group have been traditionally characterized by a morphology-based taxonomic system. Because myxozoans possess few morphological characters, these data are routinely accompanied by biological traits (host/organ/tissue specificity) and molecular data when describing or identifying myxozoan species. In the present study, a species of Myxobolus was collected from the fins of yellow catfish Tachysurus fulvidraco Richardson, 1846, which was consistent in spore morphology and host/organ specificity with Chinese records of Myxobolus physophilus Reuss, 1906. However, these earlier records and our own findings are inconsistent with the original description of M. physophilus from Russia. Specifically, there are differences in spore morphology (shape, intercapsular appendix, and polar capsule size), the infection site (air bladder vs. fins), and the host affinity (common rudd vs. yellow catfish). The inconsistencies allow us to conclude that both the present Myxobolus species and Chinese records of M. physophilus are distinct from the original description of M. physophilus and represent a new Myxobolus species, which we named Myxobolus xiantaoensis n. sp.
