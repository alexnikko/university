Oncoplastic surgery (OPS) has emerged as a new approach for extending breast conserving surgery (BCS) possibilities, reducing both mastectomy and re-excision rates, while avoiding breast deformities. OPS is based upon the integration of plastic surgery techniques for immediate reshaping after wide excision for breast cancer. This is a prospective feasibility cohort study of oncoplastic breast surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy that was carried at the National Cancer Institute, Cairo University and included 70 patients. The primary outcome was the local recurrence rate. Secondary outcomes included survival and margins obtained as well as cosmetic outcomes. Survival analysis was performed. Oncoplastic breast surgery did not compromise oncologic safety in the patients included in the study. It even allowed wider margins of resection which could be associated with better oncologic outcomes. At the same time, it gave a better cosmetic outcome and therefore higher patient satisfaction. Oncoplastic breast surgery includes a wide spectrum of surgical techniques, ranging from the basic level I techniques in breast conserving surgery to the more complex procedures of level II which are broadly classified into volume replacement (therapeutic mammoplasty) and volume displacement procedures. We suggest that oncoplastic breast surgery techniques should be the standard of care in breast surgery. They are the basis for breast conserving surgery techniques in early breast cancer. In our experience, oncoplastic surgery is feasible in locally advanced tumours after downstaging with neoadjuvant chemotherapy without compromising the oncologic safety.
