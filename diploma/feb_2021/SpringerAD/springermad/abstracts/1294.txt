Homeobox genes play an overruling role in the regional cell fate determination during development. EVX1 is known as a new target gene of BMP signaling pathway, a group of morphogens which are making the largest subset within the transformation growth factor beta (TGF-β) superfamily. In this study, we aimed to enlighten the expression level of EVX1 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and to disclose its apparent roles in maintenance and progression of the disease. The expression level of EVX1 was analyzed in fresh tumoral tissues in comparison with distant tumor-free tissues of 50 ESCC patients using relative comparative real-time PCR. The importance of EVX1 in development and cancer was also reviewed. EVX1 was underexpressed in 70 % of tumor samples. There was a significant correlation between down-regulation of EVX1 and lymph node metastasis of tumor cells (p = 0.027). Furthermore, EVX1 underexpression was significantly correlated with depth of tumor cell invasion (P = 0.037). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report highlighting EVX1 expression in ESCC to date. The clinicopathological relevance of EVX1 mRNA expression in ESCC targeted this gene as a new independent molecular marker for advanced tumor, which determine the characteristics and behavior of aggressive ESCC.
