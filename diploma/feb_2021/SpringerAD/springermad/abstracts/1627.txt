In this study, the distribution of five Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Han population was examined in combination with the evaluation of clinical cognition and brain pathological analysis. The associations among SNPs, clinical daily cognitive states, and postmortem neuropathological changes were analyzed in 110 human brains from the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences/Peking Union Medical College (CAMS/PUMC) Human Brain Bank. APOE ε4 (OR = 4.482, P = 0.004), the RS2305421 GG genotype (adjusted OR = 4.397, P = 0.015), and the RS10498633 GT genotype (adjusted OR = 2.375, P = 0.028) were associated with a higher score on the ABC (Aβ plaque score, Braak NFT stage, and CERAD neuritic plaque score) dementia scale. These results advance our understanding of the pathogenesis of AD, the relationship between pathological diagnosis and clinical diagnosis, and the SNPs in the Han population for future research.
