Probiotics that promote the gut microbiota have been reported to reduce stress responses, and improve memory and mood. Whether and how antibiotics that eliminate or inhibit pathogenic and commensal gut bacteria also affect central nervous system functions in humans is so far unknown. In a double-blinded randomized study, 16 healthy volunteers (27.00 ± 1.60 years; 9 males) received either rifaximin (600 mg/day) (a poorly absorbable antibiotic) or placebo for 7 days. Before and after the drug intervention, brain activities during rest and during a social stressor inducing feelings of exclusion (Cyberball game) were measured using magnetoencephalography. Social exclusion significantly affected (p < 0.001) mood and increased exclusion perception. Magnetoencephalography showed brain regions with higher activations during exclusion as compared to inclusion, in different frequency bands. Seven days of rifaximin increased prefrontal and right cingulate alpha power during resting state. Low beta power showed an interaction of intervention (rifaximin, placebo) × condition (inclusion, exclusion) during the Cyberball game in the bilateral prefrontal and left anterior cingulate cortex. Only in the rifaximin group, a decrease (p = 0.004) in power was seen comparing exclusion to inclusion; the reduced beta-1 power was negatively correlated with a change in the subjective exclusion perception score. Social stress affecting brain functioning in a specific manner is modulated by rifaximin. Contrary to our hypothesis that antibiotics have advert effects on mood, the antibiotic exhibited stress-reducing effects similar to reported effects of probiotics (supported by NeuroGUT, a EU 7th Framework Programme ITN no. 607652; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier number NCT02793193).
