This study was conducted in order to determine plasma amylase and lipase concentrations in captive black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus). Twenty-six healthy intact captive prairie dogs of both sexes were studied as part of an overall clinical health evaluation performed under general isoflurane anesthesia. Each animal underwent a complete physical examination, complete blood count, plasma biochemistry, and venous blood gas analysis. Venous blood samples were placed in heparinized blood-collection tubes and submitted for plasma amylase and lipase concentration analyses. The reference interval for amylase was 111.3–499.1 IU/L, and the mean and median plasma amylase concentrations were 323.2 and 341 IU/L, respectively (min = 152 IU/L, max = 481 IU/L). The reference interval for lipase was 25.7–78.4 IU/L, and the mean and median plasma lipase concentrations were both 49.5 IU/L (min = 27 IU/L, max = 80 IU/L). The new data presented in this report can promote better physiological understanding and improve clinical management of this rodent species.
