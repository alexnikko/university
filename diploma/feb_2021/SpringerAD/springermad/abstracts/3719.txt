KCNH family of potassium channels is responsible for diverse physiological functions ranging from the regulation of neuronal excitability and cardiac contraction to the regulation of cancer progression. KCNH channels contain a Per-Arn-Sim (PAS) domain in their N-terminal and cyclic nucleotide-binding homology (CNBH) domain in their C-terminal regions. These intracellular domains shape the function of KCNH channels and are important targets for drug development.
