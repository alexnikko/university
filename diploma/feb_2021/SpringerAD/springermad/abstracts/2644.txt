In this study, antioxidant and antileukemic activity of chemical components from bark of Mangifera casturi was investigated. Research findings have shown that several extracts of M. casturi have potent bioactivity. The methanol extract of M. casturi bark was partitioned successively to yield n-hexane fraction (6.7%), ethyl acetate (EtOAc) fraction (24.1%), and n-butanol (n-BuOH) fraction (28.1%). Five compounds were isolated from EtOAc fraction and one compound was isolated from n-hexane fraction. These compounds were identified as methyl gallate (1), taxifolin (2), pyrocatechuic acid (3), gallic acid (4), glucogallin (5), and Î²-sitosterol (6), respectively; they were confirmed by spectroscopic analysis and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. All compounds were isolated from bark of M. casturi for the first time. The EtOAc fraction as well as the isolated gallic acid (4) showed potent antioxidative and antileukemic activity against human leukemia HL-60 cells.
