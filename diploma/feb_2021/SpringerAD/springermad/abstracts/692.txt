Cardiovascular complications, including heart failure, hypertension, ischemic syndromes and venous thromboembolism, have been identified in patients treated with anti-cancer drugs. Oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and DNA synthesis inhibition are considered to be responsible for the cardiotoxicity induced by these agents. Protein quality control (PQC) has 3 major components, including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and the autophagy-lysosome system, and participates in protein folding and degradation to maintain protein homeostasis. We have demonstrated that PQC dysfunction is a new causal mechanism for the development of cardiac hypertrophy and failure. Increasing evidence shows that anti-cancer drugs, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, proteasome inhibitors, anthracyclines and autophagy inhibitors, cause PQC dysfunction. Here, we provide an overview of the potential role of PQC dysfunction in the development of cardiovascular complications induced by anti-cancer drugs.
