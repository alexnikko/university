It is well accepted that functional activity of platelet integrin αIIbβ3 is crucial for hemostasis and thrombosis. The β3 subunit of the complex undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation shown to be critical for outside-in integrin signaling and platelet clot retraction ex vivo. However, the role of this important signaling event in other aspects of prothrombotic platelet function is unknown.
