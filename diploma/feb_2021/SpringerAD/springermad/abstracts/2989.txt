Patients on chronic hemodialysis (HD) have an increased incidence of malignancy due to decreased immunity. Soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R), as an immunomodulator, seemed to have an effect in the process of malignancy. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the clinical significance of increased sIL-2R in the course of malignancy among HD patients.
