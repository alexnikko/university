The therapeutic outcomes of patients with advanced vulvar cancer are poor. Multi-modality treatments including neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, radiotherapy, concurrent chemo-radiation and surgery have been explored to reduce the extent of surgery and morbidity. The present single-institution study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of these approaches in locally advanced vulvar cancer.
