Adrenergic crises are a cardinal feature of familial dysautonomia (FD). Traditionally, adrenergic crises have been treated with the sympatholytic agent clonidine or with benzodiazepines, which can cause excessive sedation and respiratory depression. Dexmedetomidine is a centrally-acting Î± 2-adrenergic agonist with greater selectivity and shorter half-life than clonidine. We evaluated the preliminary effectiveness and safety of intravenous dexmedetomidine in the treatment of refractory adrenergic crisis in patients with FD.
