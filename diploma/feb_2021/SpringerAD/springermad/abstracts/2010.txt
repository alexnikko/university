The A1 allele of the ANKK1 Taq IA polymorphism (previously reported as located in the D2 dopamine receptor (DRD2) gene) is associated with reduced DRD2 density in the striatum and with clinical disorders, particularly addiction. It was hypothesized that impulsivity represents an endophenotype underlying these associations with the Taq IA and that environmental stress would moderate the strength of the gene-behavior relationship.
