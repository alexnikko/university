Isopsoralen is a type of furocoumarin that exhibits estrogen-like activities. The aim of this study was to determine the estrogen-like neuroprotection of isopsoralen in an animal model of spinal cord injury (SCI). Results indicated that isopsoralen (intraperitoneal injection of 5 and 10 mg/kg per day for two weeks) significantly enhanced the hindlimb locomotor functions of mice with SCI, as revealed in the BMS score and angle of inclined plane tests. Morphological data showed that isopsoralen significantly attenuated the injury of the gray matter of spinal cord and induced the up-regulation of ERα levels. The neuroprotective effects of isopsolaren were blocked by the ERα antagonist MPP (0.3 mg/kg), but not by the ERβ receptor antagonist PHTPP (0.3 mg/kg). Isopsolaren treatment increased phosphorylated PI3K and AKT (P-PI3K and P-AKT) in the spinal cord of SCI mice and showed a significant anti-apoptotic activity. These results suggest that isopsoralen performs estrogen-like neuroprotection against SCI-induced apoptosis by activating ERα and regulating the PI3K/AKT pathway.
