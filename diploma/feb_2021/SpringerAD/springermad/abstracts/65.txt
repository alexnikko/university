Using myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS), an increase in left ventricular (LV) volumes or a decrease in ejection fraction (EF) from rest to stress may be clinically important. The variation in these measures between the low-dose stress acquisition and high-dose rest acquisition in a one-day stress-rest protocol has not been established. We assessed the reproducibility of gated volumetric indices between stress and rest and the normal variation in ungated TID ratio for a one-day stress-rest 99mTc-tetrofosmin protocol.
