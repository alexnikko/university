Reliable process monitoring in real-time remains a challenge for the pharmaceutical industry. Dealing with random and gross errors in the process measurements in a systematic way is a potential solution. In this paper, we present a process model-based framework, which for given sensor network and measurement uncertainties will predict the most likely state of the process. Thus, real-time process decisions, whether for process control or exceptional events management, can be based on the most reliable estimate of the process state.
