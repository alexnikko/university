According to the World Health Organization, leishmaniasis is considered as a major neglected tropical disease causing an enormous impact on global public health. Available treatments were complicated due to the high resistance, toxicity, and high cost. Therefore, the search for novel sources of anti-leishmania agents is an urgent need. In the present study, an in vitro evaluation of the leishmanicidal activity of the essential oil of Tunisian chamomile (Matricaria recutita L.) was carried out. Chamomile essential oil exhibits a good activity on promastigotes forms of L. amazonensis and L. infantum with a low inhibitory concentration at 50% (IC50) (10.8 ± 1.4 and 10.4 ± 0.6 μg/mL, respectively). Bio-guided fractionation was developed and led to the identification of (−)-α-bisabolol as the most active molecule with low IC50 (16.0 ± 1.2 and 9.5 ± 0.1 μg/mL for L. amazonensis and L. infantum, respectively). This isolated sesquiterpene alcohol was studied for its activity on amastigotes forms (IC50 = 5.9 ± 1.2 and 4.8 ± 1.3 μg/mL, respectively) and its cytotoxicity (selectivity indexes (SI) were 5.4 and 6.6, respectively). The obtained results showed that (−)-α-bisabolol was able to activate a programmed cell death process in the promastigote stage of the parasite. It causes phosphatidylserine externalization and membrane damage. Moreover, it decreases the mitochondrial membrane potential and total ATP levels. These results highlight the potential use of (−)-α-bisabolol against both L. amazonensis and L. infantum, and further studies should be undertaken to establish it as novel leishmanicidal therapeutic agents.
