Crassiphiala is a monotypic genus of diplostomid digeneans and is the type genus of the subfamily Crassiphialinae. The type species Crassiphiala bulboglossa parasitizes kingfishers in the Nearctic and has a Neascus-type metacercaria that encysts on fish intermediate hosts, often causing black spot disease. While recent molecular phylogenetic studies included some members of the Crassiphialinae, no DNA sequence data of Crassiphiala is currently available. Our molecular and morphological study of adult and larval crassiphialines from the Americas revealed the presence of at least three lineages of Crassiphiala from the Nearctic and two lineages from the Neotropics. This is the first record of Crassiphiala from the Neotropics. Herein, we provide the first molecular phylogeny of the Diplostomoidea that includes Crassiphiala. Our data revealed 0.2–2.4% divergence among 28S sequences and 11–19.8% among CO1 sequences of lineages of Crassiphiala. The results of our analyses did not support the monophyly of Crassiphialinae. Our results clearly demonstrated that the diversity of Crassiphiala has been underestimated.
