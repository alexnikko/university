We explored the effects of rosuvastatin, aspirin, ticagrelor, and clopidogrel, alone or in combinations on the progression of atherosclerosis and inflammasome activation in diabetic mice. Statins and ticagrelor increase the production of 15-epi-lipoxin A4 via cyclooxygenase-2. Aspirin alone increases 15-epi-lipoxin A4, but when combined with statins, cyclooxygenase-2 is completely blocked.
