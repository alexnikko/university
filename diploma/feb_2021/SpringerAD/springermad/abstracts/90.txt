
Traditional cardiovascular (CV) risk factors have limited predictive value of CV mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD, creatinine clearance less than 60 mL/minute per 1.73 m2). The aim of this study was to evaluate incremental and independent prognostic value of single-photon emission computerized tomography-myocardial perfusion imaging (SPECT-MPI) across continuum of renal function.
