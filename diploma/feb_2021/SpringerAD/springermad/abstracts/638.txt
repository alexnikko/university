Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac rhythm disturbance and is associated with increased risk of thromboembolism. Oral anticoagulants are effective at reducing rates of thromboembolism in patients with AF in the general population. Patients with AF and concurrent chronic kidney disease (CKD) have higher risk of thromboembolism and bleeding compared with patients with normal renal function. Among moderate CKD and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients on chronic dialysis, the use of oral anticoagulants is controversial. Use of warfarin, while beneficial in non-CKD patients, raises a number of concerns such as increased bleeding risk, labile anticoagulant effect, and calciphylaxis, especially in the ESRD population. The newer direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) agents have demonstrated comparable efficacy and improved safety profiles compared with coumadin but are not as well studied in the CKD population. This review highlights the efficacy and safety of coumadin and the DOACs for thromboembolism prophylaxis in non-valvular AF patients with CKD.
