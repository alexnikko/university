The study was performed aiming to enhance the solubility and oral bioavailability of poorly water-soluble drug osthole by formulating solid self-microemulsifying drug delivery system (S-SMEDDS) via spherical crystallization technique. Firstly, the liquid self-microemulsifying drug delivery system (L-SMEDDS) of osthole was formulated with castor oil, Cremophor RH40, and 1,2-propylene glycol after screening various lipids and emulsifiers. The type and amount of polymeric materials, good solvents, bridging agents, and poor solvents in S-SMEDDS formulations were further determined by single-factor study. The optimal formulation contained 1:2 of ethyl cellulose (EC) and Eudragit S100, which served as matrix forming and enteric coating polymers respectively. Anhydrous ethanol and dichloromethane with a ratio of 5:3 are required to perform as good solvent and bridging agent, respectively, with the addition of 0.08% SDS aqueous solution as poor solvent. The optimized osthole S-SMEDDS had a high yield (83.91 ± 3.31%) and encapsulation efficiency (78.39 ± 2.25%). Secondly, osthole L-SMEDDS was solidified to osthole S-SMEDDS with no significant changes in terms of morphology, particle size, and zeta potential. In vitro release study demonstrated a sustained release of the drug from osthole S-SMEDDS. Moreover, in vivo pharmacokinetic study showed that the Tmax and mean residence time (MRT(0-t)) of osthole were significantly prolonged and further confirmed that osthole S-SMEDDS exhibited sustained release effect in rabbits. Comparing with osthole aqueous suspension and L-SMEDDS, osthole S-SMEDDS increased bioavailability by 205 and 152%, respectively. The results suggested that S-SMEDDS was an effective oral solid dosage form, which can improve the solubility and oral bioavailability of poorly water-soluble drug osthole.
