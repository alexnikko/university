Positive association between telomere length and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number were introduced in healthy and patients with psychiatric disorder. Based on frequent genetic changes of telomere and mitochondria in colorectal carcinomas (CRC), we studied their clinical characteristics and their association in colorectal carcinogenesis. DNA was extracted from 109 CRCs, 64 colorectal tubular adenomas (TAs), and 28 serrated polyps (SPs), and then, telomere length and mtDNA copy number were analyzed in these legions by using a real-time PCR assay. Telomere length and mtDNA copy number (mean ± S.D) in CRCs was 1.87 ± 1.52 and 1.61 ± 1.37, respectively. In TAs and SPs, relative mtDNA copy number was 0.92 ± 0.71 and 1.84 ± 1.06, respectively, shoing statistical difference (p = 0.017). However, telomere length was similar in these precancerous legions. Telomere length and mtDNA copy number did not show clinical and prognostic values in CRCs, however, positive correlation between telomere length and mitochondrial DNA copy number were found in CRC (r = 0.408, p < 0.001). However, this association was not shown in precancerous lesions (r = −0.031, p = 0.765). This result suggests that loss of co-regulation between telomeres and mitochondrial function may induce the initiation or play a role as trigger factor of colorectal carcinogenesis.
