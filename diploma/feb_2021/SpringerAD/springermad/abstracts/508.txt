Pixel-wise, parametric T2* mapping is emerging as a means of automatic measurement of iron content in tissues. It enables quick, intuitive interpretation and provides the potential benefit of spatial context between tissues. However, pixel-wise mapping uses much lower SNR data to estimate T2* when compared to region-based mapping thereby decreasing both its accuracy and precision. In this study, the effects that noise has on the precision and accuracy of pixel-wise T2* mapping were investigated and techniques to mitigate those effects are proposed.
