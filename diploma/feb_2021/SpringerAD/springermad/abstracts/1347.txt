The eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) specifically recognizes the 5′ mRNA cap, a rate-limiting step in the translation initiation process. Although the 7-methylguanosine cap (MMGcap) is the most common 5′ cap structure in eukaryotes, the trans-splicing process that occurs in several organism groups, including nematodes and flatworms, leads to the addition of a trimethylguanosine cap (TMGcap) to some RNA transcripts. In some helminths, eIF4E can have a dual capacity to bind both MMGcap and TMGcap. In the present work, we evaluated the distribution of eIF4E protein sequences in platyhelminths and we showed that only one gene coding for eIF4E is present in most parasitic flatworms. Based on this result, we cloned the Echinococcus granulosus cDNA sequence encoding eIF4E in Escherichia coli, expressed the recombinant eIF4E as a fusion protein to GST, and tested its ability to capture mRNAs through the 5′ cap using pull-down assay and qPCR. Our results indicate that the recombinant eIF4E was able to bind preferentially 5′-capped mRNAs compared with rRNAs from total RNA preparations of E. granulosus. By qPCR, we observed an enrichment in MMG-capped mRNA compared with TMG-capped mRNAs among Eg-eIF4E-GST pull-down RNAs. Eg-eIF4E structural model using the Schistosoma mansoni eIF4E as template showed to be well preserved with only a few differences between chemically similar amino acid residues at the binding sites. These data showed that E. granulosus eIF4E can be used as a potential tool to study full-length 5′-capped mRNA, besides being a potential drug target against parasitic flatworms.
