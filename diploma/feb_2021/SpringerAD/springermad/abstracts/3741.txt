Novobiocin is a coumarin antibiotic, which affects also eukaryotic cells inhibiting activity of Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90). The Hsp90 represents a molecular chaperone critical for stabilization and activation of many proteins, particularly oncoproteins that drive cancer progression. Currently, Hsp90 inhibitors focus a significant attention since they form a potentially new class of drugs in therapy of cancer. However, in the process of tumorigenesis a significant role is played also by the microenvironment of the tumour, and, in particular, by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). This study aimed at examination of the effect played by novobiocin on viability of human gingival fibroblasts (HGF-1).
