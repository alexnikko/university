A new cosmocercid species, Cosmocercoides qingtianensis sp. n., collected from the intestine of the Asiatic toad Bufo gargarizans Cantor (Amphibia: Anura) is described using integrated approaches, including light and scanning electron microscopy, and sequencing and analyzing the ribosomal [small ribosomal DNA (18S) and internal transcribed spacer (ITS)] and mitochondrial [cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1)] target regions, respectively. The new species can be distinguished from its congeners by the combination of the following morphological characters, including the large body size, the presence of lateral alae and somatic papillae in both sexes, the length of spicules, the particular morphology and length of gubernaculum, the number, arrangement and morphology of caudal rosettes, the presence of large medioventral precloacal papilla and the long tail. Our molecular analysis revealed the level of intraspecific genetic variation of C. qingtianensis sp. n. distinctly lower than that of the interspecific genetic variation in the ITS and cox1 regions. However, there are some overlaps in the range of intra- and interspecific 18S sequence divergence between the new species and some closely related species. The results of molecular analysis supported the validity of the new species based on the morphological observations. The 18S, ITS, and cox1 regions of C. pulcher collected from Bufo japonicus formosus in Japan were also sequenced and analyzed. The results showed a low level of intraspecific genetic variation in 18S and ITS regions (0–0.12% and 0–0.23% nucleotide differences, respectively), but a relatively high level of intraspecific genetic variation in cox1 region (0.78–4.69% nucleotide differences). In addition, it seems more powerful and practical to use the cox1 region as a genetic marker for the accurate identification and differentiation of species of Cosmocercoides than the 18S and ITS regions, especially for the closely related species.
