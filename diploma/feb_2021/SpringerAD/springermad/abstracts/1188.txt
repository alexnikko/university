Inflammation contributes to the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis (LN), which is the most serious complication that increases mortality of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Sophocarpine is a type of quinolizidine alkaloid that possesses anti-inflammatory property. This study investigated the speculation that sophocarpine might play a beneficial effect in LN. Female MRL/lpr mice received sophocarpine treatment for 8 weeks. Renal function and histopathology were evaluated. The level of immune complex deposition was measured by immunofluorescent staining, and the levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) and anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibodies were measured by ELISA. Western blotting was carried out to evaluate the levels of proteins involved in NLRP3 inflammasome and NF-κB pathway. Sophocarpine treatment reduced urine protein excretion, blood urea nitrogen, and attenuated renal tissue damage. The levels of renal immune complex deposition, serum anti-dsDNA, and serum and renal inflammatory cytokines were significantly reduced by sophocarpine. Sophocarpine treatment reduced the levels of proteins that form NLRP3 inflammasome. Activation of NF-κB in the kidney was inhibited by sophocarpine. Sophocarpine could ameliorate experimental LN in MRL/lpr. These effects might be through suppressing NLRP3 inflammasome and NF-κB pathway.
