Many orally inhaled products are supplied with a facemask instead of a mouthpiece, enabling aerosolized medication to be transferred from the inhaler to the lungs when the user lacks the capability to use a mouthpiece. Until recently, laboratory evaluation of an orally inhaled product-facemask was frequently undertaken by removing the facemask, treating the facemask adapter as being equivalent to a mouthpiece. Measurements of delivered drug mass were therefore subject to bias arising from the absence of dead volume, had the facemask been present. We have described the development of the Aerosol Delivery to an Anatomic Model (ADAM) infant, small child, and adult faces and upper airways, and their subsequent evaluation. Each model possesses physical features of appropriate size, and the soft tissues are also simulated. Rudimentary underlying bony structure is also present, because its purpose is only to provide support, enabling the mechanical response of the facial soft tissues when a facemask is applied to be realized. A realistic upper airway (nasopharynx for the infant model, naso- and oropharynx for the child and ﻿oropharynx﻿ for the adult models) is also incorporated, so that each model can be used to determine the mass of inhaled medication likely to penetrate as far as the lungs where therapy is intended to be applied. Measurements of the mass of pressurized metered-dose inhaler-delivered salbutamol at a filter distal to the upper airway of each model, simulating age-appropriate tidal breathing, were remarkably consistent, almost all being in the range 0.3 to 1.0 μg/kg across the model age ranges, when expressed as a fraction of body weight.
