Acetaminophen (APAP) is a widely used analgesic and antipyretic drug. APAP overdose can induce acute liver injury in humans, which is responsible for approximately 50% of total cases of acute liver failure in the United States and some European countries. Currently, the metabolism of APAP in the body has been extensively investigated; however, the exact mechanisms for APAP hepatotoxicity are not well understood. Recent studies have shown that mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress and inflammatory responses play a critical role in the pathogenesis of APAP hepatotoxicity. Autophagy is a catabolic machinery aimed at recycling cellular components and damaged organelles in response to a variety of stimuli, such as nutrient deprivation and toxic stress. Increasing evidence supports that autophagy is involved in the pathophysiological process of APAP-induced liver injury. In this review, we summarized the changes of autophagy in the liver following APAP intoxication and discussed the role and its possible mechanisms of autophagy in APAP hepatotoxicity. Furthermore, this review highlights the crosstalk between mitophagy, oxidative stress and inflammation in APAP-induced liver injury and presents some possible molecular mechanisms by which activated autophagy protects against APAP-induced liver injury.
