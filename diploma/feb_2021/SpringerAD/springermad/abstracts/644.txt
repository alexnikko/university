Chest pain is responsible for 6â€“10% of all presentations to acute healthcare providers. Triage is inherently difficult and heavily reliant on the quantification of cardiac Troponin (cTn), as a minority of patients with an ultimate diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) present with clear diagnostic features such as ST-elevation on the electrocardiogram. Owing to slow release and disappearance of cTn, many patients require repeat blood testing or present with stable but elevated concentrations of the best available biomarker and are thus caught at the interplay of sensitivity and specificity.
