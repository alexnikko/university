Uterine sarcomas are rare, accounting for 7â€“8% of all uterine cancers and less than 1% of all female genital tract cancers. Surgery is a cornerstone in the treatment, and addition of radiotherapy, chemotherapy or hormonal therapy depends on the stage of the disease. Due to its rarity, heterogeneity and aggressiveness, there is no consensus and there is scarce evidence regarding the optimal therapeutic approaches.
