The concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardioprotection and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents for pain relief is prevalent, particularly in the elderly for whom cardiovascular disease and pain are common co-morbidities. Non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are known to interfere with the antiplatelet effect of aspirin through competitive binding with COX-1. While the clinical significance of this interference is still unclear, this review sought to assess the body of literature which has evaluated the potential attenuation of the anti-platelet effect of aspirin when dosed concomitantly with an NSAID. This review supports that the pharmacodynamic interaction between aspirin and non-selective NSAIDs occurs, but finds that the interaction varies amongst agents, and is highly dependent on numerous factors including: dose timing, dose of aspirin, and dose of the NSAID in question. Recent findings suggest that patient factors, such as body weight may also be indicators of aspirinâ€™s cardiovascular effectiveness. Ultimately, the clinical decision making for concomitant NSAID and low-dose aspirin regimens remains at the patient level.
