Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the effective mean of immune restoration in severe combined immunodefiency (SCID). Usually, HSCT without cytoreductive conditioning is attempted. Nevertheless, conditioning procedures are still preferred in a subset of patients. Herein, we describe the immunological outcome in a cohort of conditioned and unconditioned patients, from diagnosis, through transplantation, to follow-up. This retrospective study was conducted on 17 patients with SCID (10 conditioned, 7 unconditioned) who later underwent HSCT. Immune reconstitution was assessed in the post-transplant year by quantification of T cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) and kappa-deleting recombination excision circles (KRECs), among additional laboratory and clinical evaluations. Unconditioned patients were diagnosed and transplanted earlier. TREC and KREC quantification showed a gradual increase in both groups, with higher levels in the conditioned group. Engraftment percentages differed drastically between groups, favoring the conditioned group. Unconditioned patients were significantly more dependent on intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIGs). One patient from each group succumbed to disease complications. Conditioning demonstrated superior laboratorial outcomes. Patients with unique characteristics (i.e., consanguinity, Bacillus Calmette–Guérin vaccination, impaired access to IVIG) may require personalized considerations. The effort to implement secondary prevention of SCID with newborn screening should continue.
