The present antiepileptic drugs pose several problems in the management of seizures owing to their meager neuroprotective potential, adverse effects on bone, detrimental effects on cognitive function, chronic toxicity, drug interactions, side effects including aggression, agitation, and irritability and sometimes exacerbation of seizures. We followed up progressive preclinical investigation in mice against pilocarpine (PILO)-induced status epilepticus (SE) and temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). To determine the response of raloxifene (RF) (4 and 8 mg/kg), fluoxetine (FT) (14 and 22 mg/kg), bromocriptine (BC) (6 and 10 mg/kg), and their low-dose combinations, oral treatment was scheduled for 28 days followed by PILO (300 mg/kg, i.p). The response was stalked for intensive behavioral monitoring of convulsions, hippocampal neuropeptide Y (NPY), and oxidative stress discernment along with histomorphological studies. The resultant data confirmed the therapeutic potential of triple drug combination of raloxifene (4 mg/kg) with fluoxetine (14 mg/kg) and bromocriptine (6 mg/kg) compared to monotherapy with raloxifene (4 mg/kg), and bromocriptine (6 mg/kg) as otherwise monotherapy with fluoxetine (14 mg/kg) was ineffective to suppress convulsions; an effect better than sodium valproate (300 mg/kg), a standard AED, was validated. Most profoundly, PILO-induced compensatory increases in hippocampal NPY levels (20.01%), which was escalated (100%) with the triple drug combination. The same pattern of results was superseded for oxidative stress indices and neuronal damage. The results for the first time demonstrate the propitious role of triple drug combination in the management of SE and TLE. Therapeutically, this enhancing profile of drugs fosters a safer and more effective drug-combination regimen.
