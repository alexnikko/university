Neurogenesis plays a significant role during adulthood, and the observation that neural stem cells reside in the central nervous system and the olfactory epithelium has attracted attention due to their importance in neuronal regeneration. In addition, soluble factors (SFs) release by neural stem cells may modulate the neurogenic process. Thus, in this study, we identified the SFs released by olfactory human neural stem/progenitor cells (hNS/PCs-OE). These cells express Ki67, nestin, and βIII-tubulin, indicating their neural lineage. The hNS/PCs-OE also express PSD95 and tau proteins during proliferation, but increased levels are observed after differentiation. Thus, we evaluated the effects of SFs from hNS/PCs-OE on the viability, proliferation, and differentiation potential of adult murine hippocampal neural precursor cells (AHPCs). SFs from hNS/PCs-OE maintain cells in the precursor and proliferative stages and mainly promote the astrocytic differentiation of AHPCs. These effects involved the activation, as measured by phosphorylation, of several proteins (Erk1/2; Akt/PRAS40/GSK3β and JAK/STAT) involved in key events of the neurogenic process. Moreover, according to the results from the antibody-based microarray approach, among the soluble factors, hNS/PCs-OE produce interleukin-6 (IL-6) and neurotrophin 4 (NT4). However, residual epidermal growth factor (EGF) was also detected. These proteins partially reproduced the effects of SFs from hNS/PCs-OE on AHPCs, and the mechanism underlying these effects is mediated by Src proteins, which have been implicated in EGF-induced transactivation of TrkB receptor. The results of the present study suggest the potential use of SFs from hNS/PCs-OE in controlling the differentiation potential of AHPCs. Thus, the potential clinical relevance of hNS/PCs-OE is worth pursuing.
