Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is associated with the risk of deteriorating liver function, especially in patients with preexisting liver damage. Current liver function tests may fail to accurately predict the functional liver reserve. Aim of this study was to investigate whether changes of liver function caused by TACE are associated with detectable changes of LiMAx values.
