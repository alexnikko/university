As a vital member of AAA+ (ATPase associated with diverse cellular activities) protein superfamily, Lon, a homo-hexameric ring-shaped protein complex with a serine–lysine catalytic dyad, is highly conserved throughout almost all prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. Lon protease (LONP) plays an important role in maintaining mitoproteostasis through selectively recognizing and degrading oxidatively modified mitoproteins within mitochondrial matrix, such as oxidized aconitase, phosphorylated mitochondrial transcription factor A, etc. Furthermore, the up-regulated LONP increased mitochondrial ROS generation to promote cell survival, cell proliferation, epithelial–mesenchymal transition, and cell migration, which was attributed to the up-regulation of NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit S8 via interaction with chaperone Lon under hypoxic or oxidative stress in tumorigenesis. In addition, Lon also participated in protein kinase RNA (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase signaling pathway under endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. In short, Lon, as a pivotal stress-responsive protein that involved in the crosstalks among mitochondria, ER and nucleus, participated in multifarious important cellular processes crucial for cell survival, such as the mitochondrial protein quality control system, the mitochondrial unfolded protein response, the mtDNA maintenance, and the ER unfolded protein response.
