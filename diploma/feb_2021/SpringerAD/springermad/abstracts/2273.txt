In the current study, we present an innovative concept based on the knowledge that enhancing naturally occurring biological mechanisms is effective in preventing neuronal damage and maintaining low disease activity in about 15% of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients presenting the benign type of MS. Recently, we have demonstrated that low disease activity in benign MS is associated with suppression of RNA polymerase 1 (POL1) pathway; therefore, targeting POL1 transcription machinery as a strategy for suppressing active forms of MS is suggested. To further establish our approach, we aimed to suppress POL1 pathway by silencing of the POL1-related RRN3, POLR1D and LRPPRC genes in specific MOG35-55-activated lymphocytes and assess their capacity to induce experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) by passive transfer. We have demonstrated that silencing of specific POL1 pathway-related genes significantly decreased viability and increased the proportion of CD4+/AnnexinV+/PI+ apoptotic cells in MOG35-55-primed lymphocytes. POL1-gene silencing significantly decreased the proportion of CD4+IL17+ and increased proportion of CD4+IL10+ and CD4+TNFa+ lymphocytes that occurred simultaneously with over-presentation of Treg CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ cells. Passive transfer of MOG35-55-primed lymphocytes after POL1-gene silencing suppressed EAE development in mice as demonstrated by delayed onset and peak of disease accompanied by significantly lower maximal and cumulative EAE scores. Our study supports a basis for direct targeting of POL1 transcription pathway as a strategy for selective induction of apoptosis and suppression of inflammation in EAE and consequently paves the way for innovative and targeted MS therapeutic strategy that is based on naturally existing biological mechanism.
