Ranolazine (RAN) added to amiodarone (AMIO) has been shown to accelerate termination of postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) following coronary artery bypass surgery in patients without heart failure (HF). This study aimed to investigate if treatment efficacy with AMIO or AMIO + RAN differs between patients with concomitant HF with reduced or preserved ejection fraction (HFrEF or HFpEF).
