Paraneoplastic syndromes are defined as clinical syndromes that are not related to direct tumor invasion or compression but are secondary to tumor secretion of functional peptides/hormones or related to immune cross-reactivity with normal host tissue. Paraneoplastic syndromes have a wide range of presentations and can present before the primary malignancy or tumor recurrence is diagnosed. They can mimic non-neoplastic processes, making detection, diagnosis and treatment difficult. However, they can also provide clues to the presence of an underlying malignancy. In this paper, we reviewed a range of paraneoplastic syndromes that can occur in children including: (1) neurologic (opsoclonus-myoclonus, limbic, anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate [NMDA] and anti-Ma2 encephalitis and myasthenia gravis); (2) endocrine (neuroendocrine tumors, hypercalcemia, SIADH [syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion], osteomalacia/rickets and ROHHAD [rapid onset of obesity, hypoventilation, hypothalamic dysfunction and autonomic dysregulation]); and (3) dermatologic/rheumatologic syndromes (hypertrophic osteoarthropathy and paraneoplastic pemphigus). Familiarity with these syndromes can aid in early diagnosis, treatment and imaging optimization.
