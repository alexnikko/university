Two mechanisms underlie smoking cessation efficacies of α4β2* nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonists: a “nicotine-like” agonist activity reduces craving by substituting for nicotine during a quit attempt, and a “nicotine-blocking” antagonist activity attenuates reinforcement by competing with inhaled nicotine during a relapse. To evaluate the contribution of each mechanism to clinical efficacy, we estimated the degree of agonist and antagonist activities of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), varenicline, cytisine, and the discontinued nAChR agonists dianicline, ABT-418, ABT-089, CP-601927, and CP-601932, relative to the functional effects of nicotine from smoking.
