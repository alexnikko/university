The marked clinical heterogeneity of CLL makes early prognosis assessment important. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) has been shown to confer adverse prognosis in CLL, recent data indicating it might also contribute to CLL cell survival and metabolism. We determined LPL mRNA expression in unselected peripheral blood of 84 CLL patients by RT PCR. Results were correlated with other prognostic markers and outcome. 30/84 (40 %) of cases were LPL positive based on the cutoff established by ROC analysis. In LPL positive patients significantly shorter median survival (136 vs 258 months, p < 0.0001) and time to first treatment intervals (36 vs 144 months, p < 0.002) were documented. LPL values correlated with male gender, higher stages, more treatment requirement, CD38 positivity and unmutated IgVH genes. Among cases with 13q deletion, LPL positivity identified a subcohort with poor outcome (median survival 108 months vs NR, p < 0.0001). In multivariate analysis, cytogenetic aberrations and LPL had significant impact on survival. Our results confirm that LPL is a strong predictor of outcome in CLL, able to improve prognostic accuracy in good risk cytogenetic subgroups. The relationship between its prognostic and functional role in CLL needs to be explored further.
