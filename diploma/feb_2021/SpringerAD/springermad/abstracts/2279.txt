As a key regulator of cell metabolism and survival, mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) emerges as a novel therapeutic target for Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD). A growing body of research indicates that restoring perturbed mTOR signaling in PD models can prevent neuronal cell death. Nevertheless, molecular mechanisms underlying mTOR-mediated effects in PD have not been fully understood yet. Here, we review recent progress in characterizing the association of mTOR signaling with PD risk factors and further discuss the potential roles of mTOR in PD.
