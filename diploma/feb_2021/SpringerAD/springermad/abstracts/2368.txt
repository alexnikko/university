Active hand prostheses controlled using electromyography (EMG) signals have been used for decades to restore the grasping function, lost after an amputation. Although myocontrol is a simple and intuitive interface, it is also imprecise due to the stochastic nature of the EMG recorded using surface electrodes. Furthermore, the sensory feedback from the prosthesis to the user is still missing. In this study, we present a novel concept to close the loop in myoelectric prostheses. In addition to conveying the grasping force (system output), we provided to the user the online information about the system input (EMG biofeedback).
