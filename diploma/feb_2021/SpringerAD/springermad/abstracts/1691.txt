Myelination by oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system requires coordinated exocytosis and endocytosis of the major myelin protein, proteolipid protein (PLP). Here, we demonstrated that a small GTPase, Rab27b, is involved in PLP trafficking in oligodendrocytes. We showed that PLP co-localized with Rab27b in late endosomes/lysosomes in oligodendrocytes. Short hairpin-mediated knockdown of Rab27b not only reduced lysosomal exocytosis but also greatly diminished the surface expression of PLP in oligodendrocytes. In addition, knockdown of Rab27b reduced the myelin-like membranes induced by co-culture of oligodendrocytes and neurons. Our data suggest that Rab27b is involved in myelin biogenesis by regulating PLP transport from late endosomes/lysosomes to the cell membrane in oligodendrocytes.
