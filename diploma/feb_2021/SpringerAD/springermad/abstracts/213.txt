Currently, single fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for clinical use is derived from individual blood donors. The objective of this study is to investigate the differences in single FFP units to make related strategies for improving FFP transfusion efficacy. 120 units of single FFP were selected randomly from Chinese PLA Clinical Blood Transfusion Center in Beijing, China. Single FFP samples were thawed in 37 °C water bath and were assessed immediately for total protein (TP), albumin (Alb), fibrinogen (Fg), factor V (FV), factor VIII (FVIII), antithrombin-III (AT-III) and protein C (PC). Multiple comparisons were employed to analysis the differences. The quality levels of 120 single FFP units showed wider ranges and presented normal distribution. Fg, FV and PC showed larger fluctuation range but TP, Alb, FVIII and AT-III showed smaller. The mean level of TP was 56.07 g/L and FVIII was 0.62 IU/mL. There were no significant differences to genders in single FFP units. FFP from younger people with 18–30 years old showed a trend towards reduced activity of coagulation factors, especially FV and FVIII. TP and Alb levels in FFP with type O were significantly higher than that in non-O type, but FVIII, AT-III and PC levels were lower in type O than that in non-O type. In a word, the whole quality of single FFP units from Chinese regional donors was acceptable, except FVIII. There were great differences of plasma proteins and factors in single FFP units, age and ABO blood type were main influence factors.
