Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death in women. Nevertheless, extensive evidence demonstrates under-diagnosis and under-treatment of women for suspected or known ischemic heart disease (IHD). Stress cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is becoming readily available and offers significant advantages over other stress imaging modalities. The high spatial and temporal resolution of CMR provides the unique ability to identify subendocardial ischemia, viability, and the presence of microvascular disease. Furthermore, CMR is free from ionizing radiation, and image quality is not compromised by attenuation artifacts or patient size. Over the past two decades, evidence-based data have demonstrated the high diagnostic and prognostic performance of stress CMR in the context of IHD, often superior to other stress imaging techniques. Importantly, ad hoc studies confirmed these results in women with known or suspected IHD. Stress CMR warrants consideration as the modality of choice for women requiring an imaging test for ischemia given its strong evidence base, superior test characteristics, comprehensive nature, and unique ability to characterize both epicardial and microvascular disease.
