Catechols are a class of compounds that contain adjacent hydroxyl groups on a benzene ring. Endogenous catechols in human plasma include the catecholamines norepinephrine, epinephrine (adrenaline), and dopamine; the catecholamine precursor DOPA, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG), which is the main neuronal metabolite of norepinephrine; and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), which is the main neuronal metabolite of dopamine. In the diagnostic evaluation of patients with known or suspected dysautonomias, measurement of plasma catechols is rarely diagnostic but often is informative. This review summarizes the roles of clinical catechol neurochemistry in autonomic function testing.
