To evaluate the impact of an institutional protocol on patterns of use and outcomes of inferior vena cava filters (IVCF). Following a multidisciplinary effort, an institutional protocol involving dedicated follow-up of patients receiving IVCF and a physician education program regarding IVCF utilization, was established. We prospectively collected data of patients who received IVCF during 2015–2016, following protocol implementation (POST group). For comparison, we reviewed records of patients who received IVCF during 2009–2014, before implementation of the institutional protocol (PRE group). In the PRE and POST groups, 76 and 38 IVCF per year were inserted respectively, with an overall decrease of 50%. IVCF were more likely to be placed for therapeutic rather than prophylactic indications in the POST compared to the PRE group (P = 0.003). Follow-up rates at our coagulation clinic were significantly higher in the POST than the PRE group (100 vs. 22.9%, P < 0.0001), as were rates of attempted retrieval: 60.5% (23/38) vs. 16.7% (76/455), P < 0.0001. Failed retrieval occurred at similar rates: 15.8% (12/76) vs. 18.2% (4/22), P = 0.75. There was a trend towards a lower thrombotic complication rate in the POST than the PRE group: 2.6 vs. 11.2%, P = 0.16. Implementation of an institutional protocol significantly decreased the use of IVCF and increased the retrieval rate. Such intervention could potentially lead to lower rates of IVCF-related complications in the future.
