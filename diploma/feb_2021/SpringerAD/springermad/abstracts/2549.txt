Psychopathological symptoms and reduced health related quality of life (HRQoL) are frequent in cirrhotics, but no data on their association with cirrhosis prognosis assessed by the MELDNa score are available. Prospective data on the long-term effect of deceased donor liver transplantation (LT) on psychopathological symptoms are needed. Before entering the LT waiting list, 44 consecutive LT cirrhotic candidates without a major psychiatric disorder underwent a psychopathological assessment, including Symptom Checklist-90-revised (SCL-90-R) and Defense Style Questionnaire (DSQ). HRQoL was measured by Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36). Abnormal performance at each questionnaire was defined by using 44 age, gender, BMI and education-matched healthy subjects. Separate binary logistic regression models were used to test the association of the Child-Pugh, MELD and MELDNa scores with abnormal performance at each questionnaire. Fourteen patients repeated the battery tests 3 years after LT. Before LT, increasing MELDNa was the only prognostic score independently associated with an abnormal SCL-90-R global psychopathological score index (OR: 1.207; 95% CI: 1.026–1.420; P = 0.02) and the best independent predictor of reduced HRQoL. After LT, compared to status prior to LT, performance at SF-36 general health perception scale ameliorated (P = 0.02), performance at SCL-90-R somatization scale (P = 0.001) and global psychopathological score index (P < 0.001) worsened and the negative correlation between the psychopathological global score index and HRQoL disappeared. The severity of cirrhosis in LT candidates should be monitored by the MELDNa score to better establish the right psychological counselling. Psychopathology, and in particular somatization, worsens after LT and should be carefully investigated.
