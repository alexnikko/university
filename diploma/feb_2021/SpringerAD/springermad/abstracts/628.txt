Obese adults exhibit increased levels of inflammation, which may negatively affect blood pressure regulation. Based on existing literature, we hypothesized: (1) baroreflex sensitivity would be lower in obese adults when compared to lean adults; (2) acute ibuprofen (IBU, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent) administration would increase baroreflex sensitivity in obese adults, with no effect in lean adults.
