The applicability of sleep medicine into public health policies depends on epidemiological and population-based surveys. The present study aimed to analyze a population-based sample to provide qualitative epidemiological profiles related to obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, by means of a correspondence analysis. The SÃ£o Paulo Epidemiological Sleep Study (EPISONO) dataset was used and variables related to the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome diagnosis, gender, age, self-reported ethnicity, and body mass index (BMI) were extracted to allow comparisons. Two distinct profiles were identified: (1) non-apneic adults were younger, non-obese, and presented Mulatto or Asian self-reported ethnicity; and (2) apneic individuals (regardless of the severity of the disease) were older adults, obese, and did not display any association with any specific self-reported ethnicity. The current analysis is pioneer on the use of correspondence analysis on sleep medicine.
