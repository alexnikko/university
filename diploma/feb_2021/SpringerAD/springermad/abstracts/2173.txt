Microglia-mediated neuroinflammatory responses are well known to inhibit neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the adult hippocampus, and growing evidence indicates that therapeutic intervention to suppress microglial activation could be an effective strategy for restoring the impaired neurogenesis and memory performance. In the present study, we investigated the effects of water-soluble arginyl–diosgenin analog (Arg-DG) on the adult hippocampal neurogenesis using a central LPS-induced inflammatory mice model, along with the fundamental mechanisms in vivo and in vitro using LPS-stimulated microglial BV2 cells. Arg-DG (0.6 mg/kg) attenuates LPS-impaired neurogenesis by ameliorating the proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs), and prolonging their survival. The impaired neurogenesis in the hippocampal DG triggered the cognitive function, and that treatment of Arg-DG led to the recovery of cognitive decline. Arg-DG also suppressed the production of LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines in hippocampal DG by blocking microglial activation. In in vitro study, Arg-DG inhibited the production of nitric oxide (NO), nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression, and prostaglandin D2 production (PGD2), as well as the pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). The anti-inflammatory effect of Arg-DG was regulated by NF-κB and MAPK JNK signaling both in vivo, and in LPS-stimulated microglial BV2 cells. Taken together, these results suggest that Arg-DG might have the potential to treat various neurodegenerative disorders resulting from microglia-mediated neuroinflammation.
