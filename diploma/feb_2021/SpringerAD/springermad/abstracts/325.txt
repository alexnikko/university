Platelet adhesion and subsequent thrombus formation on a subendothelial matrix at the site of vascular damage play a crucial role in the arrest of posttraumatic bleeding but also in different pathological thrombotic events, such as acute coronary syndrome and stroke. Recently published studies have clearly demonstrated that platelet integri αIIbβ3 is intimately involved in the occlusive thrombus formation at the site of endothelial damage. Therefore, any genetic variation in the expression of this receptor may lead to an excessive bleeding or excessive thrombus formation. In this study, we evaluated the influence of HPA-1 polymorphism of integrin αIIbβ3 on platelet adhesion onto immobilized fibrinogen using an in vitro system simulating blood flow.
