Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecological malignancy. Mechanisms involved in the progression of primary high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) into metastatic carcinoma are not understood. Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) is overexpressed in cancer, and its overexpression leads to epigenetic changes through hypomethylation of histones. It plays a role in epithelialâ€“mesenchymal transition and sustenance of cancer stem cells. NNMT expression in primary and metastases of ovarian carcinoma and its relationship with survival have not been studied before.
