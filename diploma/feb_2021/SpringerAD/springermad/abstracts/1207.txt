Platelet factor 4 (PF4) is a megakaryocyte-/platelet-derived chemokine with diverse functions as a regulator of vascular and immune biology. PF4 has a central role in vessel injury responses, innate immune cell responses, and T-helper cell differentiation. We have now discovered that PF4 has a direct role in B cell differentiation in the bone marrow. Mice lacking PF4 (PF4−/− mice) had fewer developing B cells in the bone marrow beginning after the pre-pro-B cell stage of differentiation. In vitro, PF4 increased the differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors to B cell lineage cells, indicating that PF4 has a direct effect on B cell differentiation. STAT5 activation is essential in early B cell development and PF4 increased the phosphorylation of STAT5. Taken together, these data demonstrate that PF4 has an important role in increasing B cell differentiation in the bone marrow environment.
