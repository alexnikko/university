High-dose chemotherapy for remission induction can induce cardiac toxicity prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). However, the details of cardiac function in patients undergoing HSCT are unclear, particularly during exercise. The aim of present study was to evaluate cardiac output responses to exercise in patients after high-dose chemotherapy before HSCT compared with in age-matched healthy controls.
