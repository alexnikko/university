People that reach extreme ages (Long-Living Individuals, LLIs) are object of intense investigation for increase/decrease of genetic variant frequencies, genetic methylation levels, protein abundance in serum and tissues. The aim of these studies is the discovery of the mechanisms behind LLIs extreme longevity and the identification of markers of well-being. We have recently associated a BPIFB4 haplotype (LAV) with exceptional longevity under a homozygous genetic model, and identified that CD34+ of LLIs subjects express higher BPIFB4 transcript as compared to CD34+ of control population. It would be of interest to correlate serum BPIFB4 protein levels with exceptional longevity and health status of LLIs.
