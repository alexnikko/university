Diagnostic technology is rapidly evolving, and over the last decade, substantial progress has been made even for the identification of antibodies, increasingly approaching this type of diagnostic to that of automated clinical chemistry laboratory. In this review, we describe the analytical and diagnostic characteristics of chemiluminescence technology in its strength and in its applicability for a more rapid and accurate diagnosis of autoimmune diseases. The wide dynamic range, greater than that of immunoenzymatic methods, the high sensitivity and specificity of the results expressed in quantitative form, the high degree of automation and the clinical implications related to the reduction in the turnaround time, and the ability to run a large number of antibody tests (even of different isotypes), directed towards large antigenic panels in random access mode, make this technology the most advanced in the clinical laboratory, with enormous repercussions on the workflow and on the autoimmunology laboratory organisation. Further improvements are expected in the coming years with the development of new analytical platforms such as the flow-injection chemiluminescent immunoassay, the two-dimensional resolution for chemiluminescence multiplex immunoassay and the magnetic nanoparticles chemiluminescence immunoassay, which will likely result in additional increases in the clinical efficacy of antibody tests.
