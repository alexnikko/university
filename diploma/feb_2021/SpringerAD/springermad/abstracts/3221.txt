This study describes the validation of a near infrared spectroscopic method for monitoring a continuous manufacturing system. The achievement of this goal requires determining the near infrared (NIR) methodâ€™s accuracy, precision, obtaining an estimate of the sample volume analyzed, and the frequency with which measurements should be obtained.
