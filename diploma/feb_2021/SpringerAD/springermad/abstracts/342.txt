Previous studies revealed a high rate of abnormal exercise test (ET) results in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) in asymptomatic athletes. The physiological background of this phenomenon is not well established. In particular, it is unclear whether sports-induced morphological cardiac adaptations are determinants of abnormal ET results. The main objective of this study was to investigate if healthy asymptomatic recreational and competitive athletes with abnormal ET results without obstructive CAD have a higher LV mass when compared with athletes with normal ET results.
