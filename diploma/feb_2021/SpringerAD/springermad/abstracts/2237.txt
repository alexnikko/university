The activation of c-Jun-N-terminal kinases (JNK) pathway has been largely associated with the pathogenesis and the neuronal death that occur in neurodegenerative diseases. Altogether, this justifies why JNKs have become a focus of screens for new therapeutic strategies. The aim of the present study was to identify the role of the different JNK isoforms (JNK1, JNK2, and JNK3) in apoptosis and inflammation after induction of brain damage. To address this aim, we induced excitotoxicity in wild-type and JNK knockout mice (jnk1  −/− , jnk2  −/− , and jnk3  −/− ) via an intraperitoneal injection of kainic acid, an agonist of glutamic-kainate-receptors, that induce status epilepticus.
