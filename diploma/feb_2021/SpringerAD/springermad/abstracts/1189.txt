The present study evaluated the immune-protective efficacy of the Chlamydia psittaci (C. psittaci) plasmid protein CPSIT_p7 and analyzed the potential mechanisms of this protection. The current study used recombinant CPSIT_p7 protein with Freund’s complete adjuvant and Freund’s incomplete adjuvant to vaccinate BALB/c mice. Adjuvants alone or PBS formulated with the same adjuvants was used as negative controls. Mice were intranasally challenged with 105 inclusion-forming units (IFU) of C. psittaci. We found that CPSIT_p7 vaccination significantly decreased the mouse lung chlamydial load, interferon-γ (IFN-γ) level, and pathological injury. This protection correlated well with specific humoral and cellular immune responses against C. psittaci. In vitro or in vivo neutralization of C. psittaci with sera harvested from immunized mice did not reduce the number of recoverable C. psittaci in the infected lungs, but CD4+ spleen cells collected from CPSIT_p7-immunized mice significantly decreased the chlamydial load via adoptive transfer to native mice. These results reveal that the protection conferred by CPSIT_p7 is dependent on CD4+ T cells.
