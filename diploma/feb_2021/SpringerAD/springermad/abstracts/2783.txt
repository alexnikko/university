Temporalis muscle flap is a versatile flap which can be used for reconstruction after major head and neck resections, owing to its optimal bulk, constant and reliable vascularity, ease of access to recipient site, minimal donor site morbidity and relatively better cosmetic outcome compared to more bulky flaps like pectoralis major myocutaneous flap or deltopectoral flap. The flap can be used as a muscle flap, myofascial flap (muscle with temporalis fascia). We present our series of 12 cases of temporalis muscle flap reconstruction for various head and neck reconstructions. The aim of this study was to analyse the application of temporalis muscle flap in head and neck reconstructions and its outcome.
