Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models are an important type of systems model used commonly in drug development before commencement of first-in-human studies. Due to structural complexity, these models are not easily utilised for future data-driven population pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses that require simpler models. In the current study we aimed to explore and automate methods of simplifying PBPK models using a proper lumping technique. A linear 17-state PBPK model for fentanyl was identified from the literature. Four methods were developed to search the optimal lumped model, including full enumeration (the reference method), non-adaptive random search (NARS), scree plot plus NARS, and simulated annealing (SA). For exploratory purposes, it was required that the total area under the fentanyl arterial concentrationâ€“time curve (AUC) between the lumped and original models differ by 0.002% at maximum. In full enumeration, a 4-state lumped model satisfying the exploratory criterion was found. In NARS, a lumped model with the same number of lumped states was found, requiring a large number of random samples. The scree plot provided a starting lumped model to NARS and the search completed within a short time. In SA, a 4-state lumped model was consistently delivered. In simplify an existing linear fentanyl PBPK model, SA was found to be robust and the most efficient and may be suitable for general application to other larger-scale linear systems. Ultimately, simplified PBPK systems with fundamental mechanisms may be readily used for data-driven PK analyses.
