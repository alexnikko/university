Systemic vasculitides constitute a heterogeneous group of diseases of autoimmunological origin characterized by inflammation of blood vessels and antibodies that react against autoantigens in a process that ultimately affects blood vessel walls. An important number of these patients present kidney disease. An endeavour of this area of research is the identification of autoantigens involved in these diseases. Accordingly, we used serum from a patient suffering from a microscopic polyangiitis, P-ANCA positive, manifesting a clinically atypical renal necrotizing glomerulonephritis and interstitial nephropathy for the identification of autoantigens; we also determined the prevalence of corresponding autoantibodies in other vasculitides, diabetic microangiopathy and in general population.
