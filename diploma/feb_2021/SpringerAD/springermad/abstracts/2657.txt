The purpose of present study was to determine the sub-acute toxicity effects of diazinon on the gill and intestine tissues histopathology of common carp (Cyprinus carpio) in exposure to TiO2 NPs. In this study, common carp (length: 21 ± 1.3 cm; weight: 11 ± 1.1 g) were assigned randomly to 12 experimental groups (15 each) and exposed to three non-lethal concentration of TiO2 NPs, two non-lethal concentrations of diazinon, and six mixture concentrations of diazinon and TiO2 NPs, as well a control group for a period of 14 days. For studies of classic histological, the samples of gill and intestine organs were prepared and stained by hematoxylin-eosin and, finally, was imagined by light microscopy. Compared to the control group, gill and intestine tissues of common carp in treatment groups, TiO2, diazinon, and a mixture of TiO2 and diazinon, showed higher histopathological alterations. The most commonly observed alterations in gill were hyperplasia, fusion of lamellae, aneurism, and necrosis. Common alterations in intestine were degeneration, increase in the number of goblet cells, increase in the number of lymphocyte, vacuolation, and necrosis and erosion. In conclusion, this research suggested that the coexistence toxicity of diazinon and TiO2 NPs on the gill and intestine histopathology of common carp was higher than the diazinon and TiO2 NPs alone.
