
Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease with progressive loss of dopamine neurons. PD patients usually manifest a series of motor and non-motor symptoms. In order to provide better early diagnosis and subsequent disease-modifying therapies for PD patients, there is an urgent need to identify sensitive and specific biomarkers. Biomarkers can be divided into four categories: clinical, imaging, biochemical, and genetic. Ideal biomarkers not only improve our understanding of PD pathogenesis and progression, but also provide benefits for early risk evaluation and clinical diagnosis of PD. Although many efforts have been made and several biomarkers have been extensively investigated, few if any have been found useful for early diagnosis. Here, we summarize recent developments in the discovered biomarkers of PD and discuss their merits and limitations for the early diagnosis of PD.
