Significant biochemical changes are observed in glycosaminoglycans in squamous cell laryngeal carcinoma. The most characteristics are in chondroitin/dermatan sulfate fine structure and proportion, which might be due to differential expression of the enzymes involved in their biosynthesis. The aim of the present work was the investigation in expressional and epigenetic level of the enzymes involved in chondroitin/dermatan sulfate biosynthesis in laryngeal cancer.
