Systemic administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) induces degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and reproduces the motor features of Parkinson disease (PD); however, the effect of MPTP on extranigral structures has been poorly studied. The aim of this research was to study the cardiac sympathetic innervation of control and MPTP-treated monkeys in order to describe the influence of MPTP toxicity on cardiac tissue.
