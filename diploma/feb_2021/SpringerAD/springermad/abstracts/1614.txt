GGGGCC repeat expansions in the C9ORF72 gene are the most common cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (c9ALS/FTD). It has been reported that hexanucleotide repeat expansions in C9ORF72 produce five dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins by an unconventional repeat-associated non-ATG (RAN) translation. Within the five DPR proteins, poly-PR and poly-GR that contain arginine are more toxic than the other DPRs (poly-GA, poly-GP, and poly-PA). Here, we demonstrated that poly-PR peptides transferred into cells by endocytosis in a clathrin-dependent manner, leading to endoplasmic reticulum stress and cell death. In SH-SY5Y cells and primary cortical neurons, poly-PR activated JUN amino-terminal kinase (JNK) and increased the levels of p53 and Bax. The uptake of poly-PR peptides by cells was significantly inhibited by knockdown of clathrin or by chlorpromazine, an inhibitor that blocks clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Inhibition of clathrin-dependent endocytosis by chlorpromazine significantly blocked the transfer of poly-PR peptides into cells, and attenuated poly-PR-induced JNK activation and cell death. Our data revealed that the uptake of poly-PR undergoes clathrin-dependent endocytosis and blockade of this process prevents the toxic effects of synthetic poly-PR peptides.
