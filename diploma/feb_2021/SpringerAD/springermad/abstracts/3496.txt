PIM2 kinase plays a crucial role in the cell cycle events including survival, proliferation, and differentiation in normal and neoplastic neuronal cells. Thus, it is regarded as an essential target for cancer pharmaceutical. Design of novel 5-(1H-indol-5-yl)-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-amine derivatives with enhanced PIM2 inhibitory activity. A series of twenty-five PIM2 inhibitors reported in the literature containing 5-(1H-indol-5-yl)-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-amines scaffold was studied by using two computational techniques, namely, three-dimensional quantitative structure activity relationship (3D-QSAR) and molecular docking. The comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) and comparative molecular similarity indexes analysis (CoMSIA) studies were developed using nineteen molecules having pIC50 ranging from 8.222 to 4.157. The best generated CoMFA and CoMSIA models exhibit conventional determination coefficients R2 of 0.91 and 0.90 as well as the Leave One Out cross-validation determination coefficients Q2 of 0.68 and 0.62, respectively. Moreover, the predictive ability of those models was evaluated by the external validation using a test set of six compounds with predicted determination coefficients R test 2  of 0.96 and 0.96, respectively. Besides, y-randomization test was also performed to validate our 3D-QSAR models. The most and the least active compounds were docked into the active site of the protein (PDB ID: 4 × 7q) to confirm those obtained results from 3D-QSAR models and elucidate the binding mode between this kind of compounds and the PIM2 enzyme. These satisfactory results are not offered help only to understand the binding mode of 5-(1H-indol-5-yl)-1,3,4-thiadiazol series compounds into this kind of targets, but provide information to design new potent PIM2 inhibitors.
