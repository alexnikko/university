A potent antioxidant, selenium might modulate dementia-induced progression of brain and blood oxidative and apoptotic injuries. The present study explores whether selenium protects against experimental dementia (scopolamine, SCOP)-induced brain, and blood oxidative stress, apoptosis levels, and cytokine production in rats. Thirty-two rats were equally divided into four groups. The first group was used as an untreated control. The second group was treated with SCOP to induce dementia. The third and fourth groups received 1.5 mg/kg selenium (sodium selenite) and SCOP + selenium, respectively. Dementia was induced in the second and forth groups by intraperitoneal SCOP (1 mg/kg) administration. Brain, plasma, and erythrocyte lipid peroxidation levels as well as plasma TNF-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-4 levels were high in the SCOP group though they were low in selenium treatments. Selenium and selenium + SCOP treatments increased the lowered glutathione peroxidase activity, reduced glutathione, vitamins A and E concentrations in the brain, erythrocytes and plasma of the SCOP group. Apoptotic value expressions as active caspase-3, procaspase-9, and PARP were also increased by SCOP, while they were decreased by selenium and selenium + SCOP treatments. In conclusion, selenium induced protective effects against experimental dementia-induced brain, and blood oxidative injuries and apoptosis through regulation of cytokine production, vitamin E, glutathione concentrations, and glutathione peroxidase activity.
