The recruitment of T-cells by bispecific antibodies secreted from adoptively transferred, gene-modified autologous cells has shown satisfactory results in preclinical cancer models. Even so, the approach’s translation into the clinic will require incremental improvements to its efficacy and reduction of its toxicity. Here, we characterized a tandem T-cell recruiting bispecific antibody intended to benefit gene-based immunotherapy approaches, which we call the light T-cell engager (LiTE), consisting of an EGFR-specific single-domain VHH antibody fused to a CD3-specific scFv. We generated two LiTEs with the anti-EGFR VHH and the anti-CD3 scFv arranged in both possible orders. Both constructs were well expressed in mammalian cells as highly homogenous monomers in solution with molecular weights of 43 and 41 kDa, respectively. In situ secreted LiTEs bound the cognate antigens of both parental antibodies and triggered the specific cytolysis of EGFR-expressing cancer cells without inducing T-cell activation and cytotoxicity spontaneously or against EGFR-negative cells. Light T-cell engagers are, therefore, suitable for future applications in gene-based immunotherapy approaches.
