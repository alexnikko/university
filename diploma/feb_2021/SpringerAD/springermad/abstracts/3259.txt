Statins are commonly used in the middle-aged and elderly people for treatment of hyperlipidemia. Both alpha lipoic acid (ALA) and ellagic acid (EA) are natural antioxidants found in a normal diet. They can protect against cellular damage and induce cellular apoptosis in many types of cancer cells. Fluvastatin (FLV) was combined with ALA and EA in a nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC) formula. The prepared NLCs were imaged with a transmission electron microscope (TEM). Particle size and zeta potential and FLV entrapment efficiency (%EE) were measured, and the FLV release profile was constructed. Cellular viability, caspase-3 enzyme levels, and cellular cycle were analyzed. The prepared NLCs were spherical, with a size of 85.2 ± 4.1 nm, and had a zeta potential of − 25.1 ± 3.4 mV and a %EE of 98.2 ± 1.1%. FLV IC50 was decreased by half by the formula and by about 30% when compared with the three drugs together. According to cell-cycle analysis, treatment with FLV-ALA-EA NLCs caused a significant increase in pre-G1 phase by about 1.44-fold in comparison with FLV-ALA-EA. These findings demonstrate that ALA and EA induced cell death, which makes their combination with FLV a candidate for prostate cancer therapy.
