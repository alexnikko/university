To analyze the changing patterns of treatment and to explore the current treatment approaches for breast cancer in Southwest China, we conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study of early breast cancer cases. The data of patients who registered in the information management system for breast cancer in Huaxi Hospital, Sichuan University from 1989 to 2012 were extracted. Nearly all patients underwent surgery, among whom radical mastectomy was the predominant option. Chemotherapy (88.7 %) was the most predominant adjuvant therapy approach. The percentage of patients receiving radiation therapy displayed fluctuant increase, which was 37.1 % in 2001 and reached up to 67.6 % in 2011. Besides, the endocrinetherapy became more and more popular in the hormone-receptor positive patients and the percentage of endocrinetherapy was increased from 54.1 at 2001 to 85.6 % at 2011. However, more than 10 % of hormone-receptor positive patients still did not receive endocrinetherapy annually. The hormone-receptor positive patients who received endocrinetherapy had better 5-year disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) compared to those without endocrinetherapy (5-y DFS: 88.4 % vs. 75.1 %, P < 0.001; 5-y OS: 95.7 % vs. 88.4 %, P < 0.001). N stage appeared to have greater impact on the 5-year DFS and OS than molecular subtyping. The treatment for breast cancer in China has been significantly improved but more attentions should be paid to radiotherapy and endocrine therapy. In addition, the value of N stage in the prognosis of breast cancer should not be ignored when the molecular typing draws more and more attentions.
