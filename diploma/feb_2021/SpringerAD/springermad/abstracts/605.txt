The initial symptoms of multiple system atrophy (MSA) and, in particular, early autonomic symptoms, have received less attention than motor symptoms. Whereas pathognomonic motor signs are essential to diagnostic specificity, early symptoms important to recognition of a neurodegenerative disorder may be less apparent or diagnostically ambiguous. This observational study sought to identify the very earliest symptoms in the natural history of MSA.
