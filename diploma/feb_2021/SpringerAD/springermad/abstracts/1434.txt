The neuronal guidance molecule Slit2 plays suppressive role in tumorigenesis and progression. We previously showed that Slit2-Robo1 inhibit cell migration in colorectal cancer (CRC). However, little is known about its downstream effectors in CRC. This study tries to identify whether the Slit-Robo Rho GTPase activating protein 1 (srGAP1) could mediate the inhibitory effect of Slit2-Robo1 on CRC cell migration.
