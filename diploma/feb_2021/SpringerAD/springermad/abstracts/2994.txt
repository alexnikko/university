The Japan Study Group for Cell Therapy and Transplantation (JSCT) organized a phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a treatment protocol (JSCT-MM12) for multiple myeloma (MM) patients who were previously untreated and transplantation-eligible. Since bortezomib-based therapy is known to be effective for MM, the protocol is intensified more than the previous protocol (JSCT-MM10) and comprised the subsequent treatments: bortezomib + cyclophosphamide + dexamethasone (VCD) induction; bortezomib + high-dose-melphalan (B-HDM) conditioning with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT); bortezomib + thalidomide + dexamethasone (VTD) consolidation; and lenalidomide (LEN) maintenance.
