Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a α-synucleinopathy in which intracellular aggregates of α-synuclein (α-syn) result in neurodegeneration and in the impairment of the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex-mediated release of neurotransmitters. SNAP25 is a SNARE complex component: its concentration is increased in the cerebrospinal fluid of PD patients and this is related to the severity of cognitive and motor symptoms. Five SNAP25 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that modulate gene expression and were described to play a role in neurologic conditions (rs363050, rs363039, rs363043, rs3746544, and rs1051312) were analyzed in a cohort of 412 sporadic Italian PD patients and 1103 healthy controls (HC) in order to identify possible correlation with the disease. The SNAP25 rs1051312 C allele and CC genotype confer protection against PD onset, in particular in males (p = 0.003, OR(95%CI) = 0.67(0.51–0.88)) (pc = 0.008, OR(95%CI) = 0.28(0.10–0.70)). Co-segregation analyses revealed that the rs1051312 effect was reinforced when present within the rs363043 C-rs3746544 T-rs1051312 C haplotype (p = 3.3 × 10−4, OR = 0.47, 95%CI = 0.31–0.72), once again in males. Finally, rs363039 influenced age at onset (p = 0.02) and MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination) scores (p = 0.01). The SNAP25 SNPs analyzed herein modulate gene expression at different levels as they are involved in binding miRNA and transcription factors; this suggests a possible synergistic effect of SNAP25 SNPs in the pathogenesis of PD. A replication in a larger and independent sample will help to further explore this hypothesis.
