Several original articles and editorials have been published in the Journal of Nuclear Cardiology last year. It has become a tradition at the beginning of each year to summarize some of these key articles (AlJaroudi and Hage in J Nucl Cardiol 22:507-512, 2015, 23:122-130, 2016; Hage and AlJaroudi in J Nucl Cardiol 22:714-719, 2015; 23:493-498, 2016). In this part one, we will discuss some of the progress made in patients with infiltrative disease, cardiomyopathies (non-ischemic, ischemic, and diabetic), hybrid and molecular imaging, using advancement in positron emission tomography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging.
