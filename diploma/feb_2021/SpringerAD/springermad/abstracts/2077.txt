Stroke remains a major cause of disability throughout the world: paralysis, cognitive impairment, aphasia, and so on. Surgical or medical intervention is curative in only a small number of cases. Nearly all stroke cases require rehabilitation. Neurorehabilitation generally improves patient outcome, but it sometimes has no effect or even a mal-influence. The aim of this review is the clarification of the mechanisms of neurorehabilitation. We systematically reviewed recently published articles on neural network remodeling, especially from 2014 to 2016. Finally, we summarize progress in neurorehabilitation and discuss future prospects.
