Lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) scan is now covered by Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services following an evidence-based recommendation, but a shared decision making process should inform patients of risks and limitations. An awareness campaign promoting LDCT screenings is an opportunity to elicit patient engagement with health providers about the risks and benefits. Focus groups representing three regions of Appalachian Kentucky known for high lung cancer rates discussed development of a lung cancer screening campaign. Recommendations included messaging content, appeals or design, campaign implementation, and trusted information or communication sources. Community health workers (CHWs) from three Eastern Kentucky regions recruited individuals from their local communities using established client files. CHWs hosted six total focus groups (7–11 participants each) using questions guided by the Communication-Persuasion Matrix framework. All sessions were recorded and transcribed for independent content analysis. A total of 54 individuals (61.1 % female; >55 pack year history) were participated. Prior to discussion, most participants had not heard of lung cancer screening. Cited needs for content of a campaign included benefits of early detection and payment information. Messages considered most persuasive were those that include personal testimony, messages of hope, prolonged life, and an emphasis on family and the ambition to survive. Having information come from one’s family doctor or specialty provider was considered important to message communication. Messages about survivorship, family, and prolonged life should be considered in lung cancer screening awareness campaigns. Our results provide community input about messages regarding screening options.
