Preformulation development studies for biologics are typically focused on evaluating the impact of various formulation components (pH, buffer, excipients, etc.) on the physical and chemical stability profiles of the active molecule. During the early development stages, the sample availability and information regarding the degradation profile of the protein can be limited. This necessitates the development of a high throughput screening method that requires small sample quantity and enables evaluation of wide experimental design space without required significant resource, material, or time.
