The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is a major player in the survival and proliferation of tumour cells and is overexpressed in up to 30Â % of breast cancer cases. A considerable amount of work has been undertaken to unravel the activity and function of HER2 to try and develop effective therapies that impede its action in HER2 positive breast tumours. Research has focused on exploring the HER2 activated phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT and rat sarcoma/mitogen-activated protein kinase (RAS/MAPK) pathways for therapies. Despite the advances, cases of drug resistance and recurrence of disease still remain a challenge to overcome. An important aspect for drug resistance is the complexity of the HER2 signaling network. This includes the crosstalk between HER2 and hormone receptors; its function as a transcription factor; the regulation of HER2 by protein-tyrosine phosphatases and a complex network of positive and negative feedback-loops. This review summarises the current knowledge of many different HER2 interactions to illustrate the complexity of the HER2 network from the transcription of HER2 to the effect of its downstream targets. Exploring the novel avenues of the HER2 signaling could yield a better understanding of treatment resistance and give rise to developing new and more effective therapies.
