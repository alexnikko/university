The activation of neurohumoral compensatory mechanisms is a common physiological phenomenon in heart failure in order to make up for a failing heart, which will usually have a deteriorating effect on overall health condition. Many medications, such as neprilysin and angiotensin inhibitors, have recently been introduced to remediate neurohumoral changes. This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the sacubitril-aliskiren combination versus the sacubitril-ramipril combination in the treatment of neurohumoral changes in rats with experimentally induced heart failure.
