Treatment regimens for cancer patients using single chemotherapeutic agents often lead to undesirable toxicity, drug resistance, reduced uptake etc. Combination of two or more drugs is therefore becoming an imperative strategy to overcome these limitations. A step forward can be taken through delivery of the drugs used in combination via nanoparticles. Co-administration of chemotherapeutic drugs encapsulated in nanoparticles has been shown to result in synergistic effects and enhanced therapeutic efficacy. In present study, we explored the combination treatment of histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat (VOR) and topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide (ETOP). The concurrent combination treatment of VOR and ETOP resulted in synergistic effect on human cervical HeLa cancer cells. VOR and ETOP were encapsulated into poly(ethylene glycol) monomethacrylate (POEOMA)-based disulfide cross-linked nanogels. The nanogels were synthesized using atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) via cyclohexane/water inverse mini-emulsion and were degradable in presence of intracellular glutathione (GSH) concentration. Both the drugs were loaded into the nanogels by physical encapsulation method and characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Both VOR- and ETOP-loaded nanogels showed sustained release profile. Furthermore, combination treatment drugs encapsulated of POEOMA nanogel demonstrated enhanced synergistic cytotoxic effect compared with combination of free drugs. Enhanced synergistic cell killing efficiency of drug-loaded POEOMA nanogels was due to increased apoptosis via caspase 3/7 activation. Therefore, combination of VOR- and ETOP-loaded PEG-based biodegradable nanogels may provide a promising therapy with enhanced anticancer effect.
