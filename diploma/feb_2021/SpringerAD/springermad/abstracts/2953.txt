Focal fibrocartilaginous dysplasia is a rare growth disturbance of bone resulting in deformity. In the ulna, focal fibrocartilaginous dysplasia is particularly rare, and the characteristic fibroligamentous tether can result in progressive deformity with progressive dislocation of the radial head. The fibroligamentous tether is similar in appearance and function to the Vickers ligament seen in Madelung deformity. The imaging features of ulnar focal fibrocartilaginous dysplasia include a unilateral angular deformity in the ulna with a radiolucent cortical defect and surrounding sclerosis, with secondary radial bowing or radial head dislocation. Focal fibrocartilaginous dysplasia of the ulna has been described using the term ulnar focal cortical indentation.
