Dissolving microneedles (MNs) offered a simple, minimally invasive method for meloxicam (MX) delivery to the skin. However, the fabrication of dissolving MNs still faced some challenges, such as significant time consumption, loss of drug activity, and difficulty in regulating MN drug loading. To address these issues, we developed the tip-dissolving (TD) MNs. Several kinds of drugs were encapsulated successfully, and the quantity of MX ranged from 37.23 ± 8.40 to 332.53 ± 13.37 μg was precisely controlled. The effects of fabrication process on biomacromolecules stability were studied, and it was found that tyrosinase kept 90.4% activity during the fabrication process. The whole process for the fabrication of MNs only takes approximately 1 h. In order to further evaluate the potential of the TD MNs, MX TD MNs were prepared for in vitro release experiments, in vivo release experiments, safety evaluation, pharmacokinetic studies, and pharmacodynamic studies. The results demonstrated that MX TD MNs offered several advantages, including rapid release of the encapsulated drug (91.72% within 30 min), efficient drug delivery to skin (79.18%), no obvious skin irritation, decent relative bioavailability (122.3%), and strong anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. Based on these results, we envisage that the TD MNs have promising potential for transdermal drug delivery of MX.
