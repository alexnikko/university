Comparative study on the hematological parameters of pure and reciprocal crosses of the African and Asian catfish was done to establish a reference range for fingerlings of the novel fish. Blood was collected from Clarias gariepinus (CG), Pangasianodon hypophthalmus (PH), Pangapinus (♀PH × ♂CG), and the two observed morphotypes (Clarias-like and Panga-like) of Clariothalmus (♀CG × ♂PH) obtained from similar breeding history. Result obtained revealed that red blood cell counts and white blood cell counts were significantly lower in Panga-like Clariothalmus (1.08 × 106/mm3 and 6.99 × 103/mm3, respectively) compare to other groups with similar higher counts (between 2.09 × 106/mm3 and 2.65 × 106/mm3; 13.60 × 103/mm3 and 17.27 × 103/mm3, respectively). However, Pangapinus and pure P. hypophthalmus had significantly higher values of packed cell volume (33.10 and 32.50%, respectively) and hemoglobin content (12.63 and 11.72 g/dL, respectively); similar values were recorded in those fish with Clarias maternal origin (between 25.00–27.80% and 6.67–8.03 g/dL, respectively for PCV and Hb). Calculated values for mean corpuscular volume was higher in Panga-like Clariothalmus (198.8 fL and 80.26 pg, respectively) while mean corpuscular hemoglobin and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration values were higher in the Pangapinus and pure P. hypophthalmus (between 48.10–56.98 pg and 38.28–35.96 g/dL, respectively). This result obtained is suggestive that the Panga-like Clariothalmus may have reduced fitness as compared to the other progenies. The baseline values established in this study could serve as a standard for physiological, pathological, and toxicological references in future studies.
