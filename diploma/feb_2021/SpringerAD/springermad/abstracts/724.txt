Immunodeficiency secondary to anti-interferon-gamma (anti-IFN-γ) autoantibodies was first described in 2004 as an acquired defect in the IFN-γ pathway leading to susceptibility to multiple opportunistic infections, including dimorphic fungi, parasites, and bacteria, especially tuberculosis and non-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) species. It has so far only been described in adult patients. We present 2 cases of disseminated NTM infections in otherwise immunocompetent children. A 16-year-old girl with Sweet’s syndrome–like neutrophilic dermatosis developed recurrent fever and cervical lymphadenitis secondary to Mycobacterium abscessus. A 10-year-old boy with a history of prolonged fever, aseptic meningitis, aortitis, and arteritis in multiple blood vessels developed thoracic vertebral osteomyelitis secondary to Mycobacterium avium complex. Both patients were found to have positive serum neutralizing anti-IFNγ autoantibodies. Testing for anti-IFNγ autoantibodies should be considered in otherwise healthy immunocompetent hosts with recurrent or disseminated NTM infection. This represents a phenocopy of primary immunodeficiency which has been recently described only in adults. We report the first two cases of this phenomenon to affect children.
