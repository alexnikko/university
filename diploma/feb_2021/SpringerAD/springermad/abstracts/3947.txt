Galactomannan (GM) is a polysaccharide present in the cell wall of Aspergillus spp. that is released during growth of the organism. It has been successfully used to aide in the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis allowing for earlier recognition of disease compared to conventional methods. Since its implementation in the clinic as a diagnostic tool, GM has been used in experimental models to measure therapeutic response. Several clinical studies describe the prognostic value of GM. Herein, we review the evidence supporting the utilization of GM antigen as a biomarker to measure response to systemic antifungal therapy.
