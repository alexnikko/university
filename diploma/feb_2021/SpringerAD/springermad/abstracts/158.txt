Evaluation of diastolic dysfunction and diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) by echocardiography are routinely performed at rest. However, many patients with modest HFpEF develop symptoms such as dyspnea only during exercise. Therefore, echocardiographic analysis at rest could be insufficient to identify these patients. Recent studies have demonstrated the utility of diastolic stress echocardiography to evaluate diastolic dysfunction during exercise. This review attempts to summarize and discuss current studies in diastolic stress echocardiography.
