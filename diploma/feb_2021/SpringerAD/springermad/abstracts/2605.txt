Amphistomiasis is a widespread disease of ruminants in many parts of the world including Iran. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and intensity of amphistomiasis in cattle from Gilan province, north of Iran in association with sex, age, breed, and season. This investigation was carried out over a 12-month period in Gilan. Through seasonal sampling and visual examination for amphistomiasis, the rumens and reticulum of 406 cattle, slaughtered in Rasht abattoir, Gilan province, were collected and relevant data on sex, age, and breed were recorded. The total number of harvested amphistomes, which was present in each organ was collected, counted, and preserved in a 10% formaldehyde solution. After preparation and identification, our findings revealed that Carmyerius spatiosus, Paramphistomum gotoi, Gastrothylax crumenifer, and Calicophoron calicophorum were present in this study. The overall prevalence of infection was 19.70% with a mean intensity of 764.70 (ranged from 10 to 6200). The relation between prevalence and season (P < 0.05) was significant but not sex, breed, and age (P > 0.05). On the other hand, the relative mean intensity had a positive relation with the breed (P = 0.050) and age (P < 0.01), but not with season (P = 0.108) and sex (P = 0.344). The results of this study can be used to plan for the control and prevention of this disease.
