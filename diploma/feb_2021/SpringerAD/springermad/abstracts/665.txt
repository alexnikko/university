High-intensity statins (HIS) are recommended by current treatment guidelines for patients with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and should be administered soon after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) event and maintained thereafter. However, adherence to guidelines remains adequate. Statin utilization patterns during index hospitalization and the first year after ACS event, and the association between statin utilization and post-discharge clinical and economic outcomes, are described.
