Immune status is influenced by malnutrition, but how this factor interacts in developing countries and whether these differences are similar to those determined in industrialized countries, is unclear. To establish whether malnutrition-associated immune profiles in a developing country are similar to those in industrialized countries we analyzed peripheral blood immune cell phenotypes by polychromatic flow cytometry in 50 young and 50 elderly subjects. Data on anthropometrics and diet were collected through interviews. Plasma samples were analyzed for common clinical chemistry variables. Subjects in 4 BMI categories differed in their immune parameters demonstrating influence of nutritional status on immunity. This was greater within the young group and affected the CD4 subset more profoundly than the CD8 subset. No nutrition-associated differences were seen in B or NK cells. CD8+ cells as a percentage of CD3+ T cells were positively associated with plasma CRP levels but not other factors. We conclude that there are differences in the immune signatures of obese, overweight and underweight versus normal-weight young and elderly, which seem broadly similar to the more extensively-documented state reported in industrialized countries, despite the marked societal, nutritional and many other differences.
