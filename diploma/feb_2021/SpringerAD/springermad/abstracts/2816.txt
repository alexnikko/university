Ovarian metastases from colorectal cancer are uncommon and can present synchronously and metachronoulsy. Role of prophylactic oophorectomy for colorectal cancer is controversial and there is no definitive evidence to support it. A retrospective analysis of all the patients with colorectal cancer who had attended a single unit at our center have been analysed. Clinical presentation, Pathological features and image findings were analyzed. We had 7 patients with ovarian metastases who had presented synchronously or metachronously at our institute. Five patients presented synchronously at the time of primary surgery and 2 patients had presented metachronously after the treatment of primary. Three patients had malignancy in ascending colon and 2 had in sigmoid colon , one in rectosigmoid junction and one case in rectum. The mean overall survival rate was 12.4 months (range 6–20 months). All the patients received adjuvant chemotherapy. Ovarian metastases is rare in colorectal and occurs in younger patients.
