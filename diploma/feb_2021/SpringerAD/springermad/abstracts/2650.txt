Mammary tumours are considered as an important health problem in female dogs and because of its numerous common characteristics with human breast cancer, it can be used as a good model for breast cancer studies. Interleukin-17 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine which is mainly secreted by activated Th-17 cells. There are evidences suggesting that interleukin-17 can be produced by various types of tumour cells and tumour-associated inflammatory cells. It also plays important roles in carcinogenesis by having both anti-tumour and pro-tumour functions. This study investigates interleukin-17 expression in canine mammary tumours by immunohistochemistry and its relationships with histologic grades, tumour recurrence and survival after 2 years. Results showed that 23 samples (63.88%) showed strong immunoreactivity for interleukin-17 and 13 samples (36.11%) showed moderate immunoreactivity. Interleukin-17 expression is significantly increased in canine mammary tumours compared to normal canine mammary tissues (P < 0.05). Furthermore, our results showed that interleukin-17 increased expression is significantly associated with high histologic grade (P < 0.05). Interleukin-17 may be involved in pathogenesis of canine mammary tumours by promoting malignancy grades; however, more investigations are needed to clarify this idea.
