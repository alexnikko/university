Neuronal apoptotic cell death plays an important role in many neurological disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and ischemic stroke. Spatholobi Caulis (SC) has been widely used in traditional herbal medicine for the treatment of cancer, inflammation, viral infection, and anemia. However, the protective effects of SC extract (SCE) against apoptotic cell death in the brain have not been reported. We investigated the protective effects of SCE against neuronal injury etoposide-induced neurotoxicity and in rats subjected to focal transient ischemic stroke middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 45 min, followed by 7 days of reperfusion. The in vitro study demonstrated that SCE protected cells against etoposide-induced cell viability loss in SH-SY5Y cells. Apoptotic phenotypes, such as cleaved PARP and caspase-3, and oxidative stress in etoposide-treated cells were ameliorated by SCE treatment. In MCAO-reperfusion injury, SCE promoted neuronal survival and level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) by reducing glial activation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in the ipsilateral cortex. These results indicated that SCE exerted protective effects under etoposide treatment and in a MCAO-reperfusion model by reducing JNK and p38 MAPK activation. This study presents the first evidence that SCE has therapeutic potential for the treatment of ischemic stroke or neurological disorder-related cell death.
