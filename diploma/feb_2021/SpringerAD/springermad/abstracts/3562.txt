This descriptive cross-sectional study was performed from May to June 2014 with a convenience sample of 376 undergraduate nursing students from one nursing faculty located in Izmir. Mean age of the students was 21.56 ± 1.96 years. The mean score that the females obtained from the level of knowledge and protection behaviors scales was significantly higher than that of the males. Older age group (≥22 years) obtained higher scores on the knowledge and protection behaviors scales than younger group (≤21 years). Nursing students’ knowledge of, and behavior regarding, skin cancer and sun health were insufficient. Equipping them with the necessary knowledge and behaviors related to skin cancer and sun health by developing training programs and strategies on the issue is of utmost importance.
