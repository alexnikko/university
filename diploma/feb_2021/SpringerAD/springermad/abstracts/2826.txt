Mastitis is important disease that causes huge economic losses in the dairy industry. In recent years, antibiotic therapy has become the primary treatment for mastitis, however, due to drug residue in milk and food safety factors, we lack safe and effective drugs for treating mastitis. Therefore, new targets and drugs are urgently needed to control mastitis. LXRα, one of the main members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, is reported to play important roles in metabolism, infection and immunity. Activation of LXRα could inhibit LPS-induced mastitis. Furthermore, LXRα is reported to enhance milk fat production, thus, LXRα may serve as a new target for mastitis therapy and regulation of milk fat synthesis. This review summarizes the effects of LXRα in regulating milk fat synthesis and treatment of mastitis and highlights the potential agonists involved in both issues.
