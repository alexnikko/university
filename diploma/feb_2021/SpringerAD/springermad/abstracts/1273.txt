Alterations of genes involved in histone modification are common in cancers. A histone demethylase-encoding gene PHF2 is considered a putative tumor suppressor gene (TSG). PHF2 is essential for p53-mediated TSG functions such as chemotherapy-mediated cancer cell killing. However, inactivating mutations of PHF2 that could inactivate its functions are not reported in cancers. In a genome database, we observed that the PHF2 gene possessed mononucleotide repeats, which could be mutated in cancers with high microsatellite instability (MSI-H). For this, we analyzed 124 colorectal cancers (CRCs) and 79 gastric (GCs) cancers for the mutations and their intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH). Twenty-two of 79 CRCs (27.8 %) and 7 of 34 GCs (20.6 %) harboring MSI-H exhibited frameshift mutations. However, we found no such mutations in microsatellite stable/low MSI (MSS/MSI-L) cancers. Also, we studied ITH for the detected frameshift mutations in 16 cases of CRCs and detected ITH in two (12.5 %) cases. Our data reveal that TSG gene PHF2 harbors mutational ITH as well as the frameshift mutations in CRC and GC with MSI-H. Based on this, it is suggested that frameshift mutations of PHF2 may play a role in tumorigenesis through its TSG inactivation in CRC and GC.
