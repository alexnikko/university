Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis (XGC) is an uncommon variant of chronic cholecystitis, characterized by focal or diffuse destructive inflammatory process. The importance of XGC is that it mimics gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) both preoperatively and intra-operatively, since it can present with pericholecystic infiltration, hepatic involvement and lymphadenopathy. As a result of this misdiagnosis which is not infrequent, the patient may need to undergo an unnecessary radical cholecystectomy rather than only a cholecystectomy which is associated with greater morbidity and mortality. Patients who underwent gallbladder and gallbladder-related operations during period of 5 years between 2010 and 2014 were reviewed (n = 462). A comparison of clinical, biochemical, radiological and operative features were made between patients with carcinoma gallbladder (n = 101) and xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis (n = 22). Patient with a long history of recurrent abdominal pain with leucocytosis and who on imaging are found to have a diffusely thickened gallbladder wall (p < 0.01), with cholelithiasis, choledocholithiasis and sub-mucosal hypoattenuated nodules (p < 0.05) are likely to have XGC while those with anorexia, weight loss, focal thickening of the gallbladder wall on imaging (p < 0.01) and dense local organ infiltration are more likely to have GBC. The presence of lymph nodes on imaging and the loss of fat plane interface between the liver and gallbladder are not differentiating factors. Differentiating XGC from GBC in preoperative setting is necessary to avoid radical procedures being done for a benign process. Certain clinical, radiological and intra-operative features aid in differentiating these benign and malignant process. However, the definitive diagnosis still remains a histopathological examination to avoid radical resection in patients who have a benign condition.
