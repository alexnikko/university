Total body clearance of biological drugs is for the most part dependent on the receptor mechanisms (receptor mediated clearance) and the concentration of antibodies aimed at administered drug – anti-drug-antibodies (ADA). One of the significant factors that induces the increase of ADA level after drug administration could be the aggregates present in the finished product or formed in the organism. Numerous attempts have been made to identify the sequence fragments that could be responsible for forming the aggregates – aggregate prone regions (APR).
