This study investigates the occurrence of anisakids and raphidascarids in commercial fish from Balearic Sea (Western Mediterranean). A total of 335 fish including 19 black anglerfish (Lophius budegassa), 33 white anglerfish (L. piscatorius), 129 European hake (Merluccius merluccius), 30 red mullet (Mullus barbatus), and 124 striped mullet (M. surmuletus) were examined using enzymatic digestion. A total of 948 nematode larvae were isolated (prevalence 52.53%) being the highest prevalence observed in striped mullet. Forty-six larvae were identified using molecular analyses which included PCR and sequencing of the 629-bp fragment of mitochondrial cox2 gene region. Anisakis pegreffii (80.43%), A. physeteris (8.69%), Hysterothylacium fabri (6.52%), and A. simplex (4.35%) were detected based on molecular analyses of larvae. Total nematode prevalence was positively correlated with weight, length, condition factor, and maturity stage of the host and also with fishing ground depth. Statistical differences between total nematode prevalence and geographical sector of capture were observed when fishing hauls were grouped according to the abundance of sperm whales or common bottlenose dolphins. The results also corroborate that fishing water depth may play an important role in anisakid and raphidascarid parasitization.
