Blood vessels form de novo through the tightly regulated programs of vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. Both processes are distinct but one of the steps they share is the formation of a central lumen, when groups of cells organized as vascular cords undergo complex changes to achieve a tube-like morphology. Recently, a protein termed epidermal growth factor-like domain 7 (EGFL7) was described as a novel endothelial cell-derived factor involved in the regulation of the spatial arrangement of cells during vascular tube assembly. With its impact on tubulogenesis and vessel shape EGFL7 joined the large family of molecules governing blood vessel formation. Only recently, the molecular mechanisms underlying EGFL7's effects have been started to be elucidated and shaping of the extracellular matrix (ECM) as well as Notch signaling might very well play a role in mediating its biological effects. Further, findings in knock-out animal models suggest miR-126, a miRNA located within the egfl7 gene, has a major role in vessel development by promoting VEGF signaling, angiogenesis and vascular integrity. This review summarizes our current knowledge on EGFL7 and miR-126 and we will discuss the implications of both bioactive molecules for the formation of blood vessels.
