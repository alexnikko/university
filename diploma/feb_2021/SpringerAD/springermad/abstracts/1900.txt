Pompe disease is a rare and deadly muscle disorder. As a clinical entity, the disease has been known for over 75 years. While an optimist might be excited about the advances made during this time, a pessimist would note that we have yet to find a cure. However, both sides would agree that many findings in basic science—such as the Nobel prize-winning discoveries of glycogen metabolism, the lysosome, and autophagy—have become the foundation of our understanding of Pompe disease. The disease is a glycogen storage disorder, a lysosomal disorder, and an autophagic myopathy. In this review, we will discuss how these past discoveries have guided Pompe research and impacted recent therapeutic developments.
