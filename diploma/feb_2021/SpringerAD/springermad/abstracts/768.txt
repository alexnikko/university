Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is an innate immune deficiency disorder of phagocytes, resulting from mutations in the components of the NADPH oxidase complex that impair the synthesis of oxygen radicals, thus rendering patients susceptible to recurrent infections and excessive hyperinflammatory responses. The most common autosomal recessive form of CGD is p47phox deficiency, which is often clinically milder than the more common X-linked recessive form. Here, we report data on genetics, clinical and biochemical findings in 17 CGD patients of Kavkazi origin with the nonsense mutation c.579G>A in the NCF1 gene, leading to p47phox deficiency.
