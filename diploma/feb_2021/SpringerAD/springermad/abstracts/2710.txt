Tumor-mediated immunosuppression via regulatory T-cells is a key player among the various immune-escape mechanisms in multiple myeloma. We analyzed the generation, distribution, function and immunophenotype of CD8+CD28− regulatory T-cells in patients with multiple myeloma. Functionality of CD8+CD28− T-cells was assessed by immunological assays using ex vivo generated antigen-specific T-cells from patients with plasma cell dyscrasias and healthy donors. Detailed analysis of distribution, immunophenotype and cytotoxic potential of CD8+CD28− T-cells was performed by flow cytometry and ELISA. We found that the amount of CD8+CD28− T-cells was directly correlated with the suppression of antigen-specific T-cell responses in patients with plasma cell dyscrasia. Analyzing the CD8+CD28− T-cells in detail, increased numbers of these cells were observed in the bone marrow (i.e., tumor microenvironment) of patients with plasma cell dyscrasia. Furthermore, we identified the expression of lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) as a marker of immunosuppression and defined the CD8+CD28−CD57+LFA-1high population as the relevant immunosuppressive compartment. These regulatory T-cells act as immunosuppressors via soluble factors and incubation with IL-10 augmented their immunosuppressive capacity. The immunosuppressive regulatory network of IL-10 and the CD8+CD28−CD57+LFA-1high regulatory T-cells show unique characteristics and contribute to the tumor immune escape mechanism in patients with multiple myeloma.
