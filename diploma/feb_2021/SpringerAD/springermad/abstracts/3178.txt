This study aims to describe innovation profile in the field of personalized medicine. While the major market players have recognized the importance of personalizing health care as the next milestone towards improved clinical outcomes, a common framework has yet to emerge. In the absence of such governance framework, the practices of research and development can shape the progress of the field. The cognitive structure of the research and development in the personalized medicine is mapped by characterizing the attributes of underlying technological space.
