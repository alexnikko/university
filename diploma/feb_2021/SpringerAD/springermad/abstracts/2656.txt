Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a complication of diabetes mellitus (DM) which may cause cardiac injury. The study aimed to compare concentrations of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and creatine kinase myocardium isoform (CK-MB) in DKA and normal dogs and determine the relationship between cTnI and CK-MB concentrations and blood profile values, complications, and the risk of death. Plasma samples from 20 normal and 24 DKA dogs were collected. The cTnI concentration of DKA dogs (0.053 [0.034–0.200] ng/ml) was higher than those of normal dogs (0.020 [0.015–0.043] ng/ml) (p < 0.0001). Dogs with higher cTnI concentration had a higher risk of death than those with lower cTnI concentrations (HR 12.34; 95 % CI 1.66, 91.97). DKA dogs (203.5 [142.8–290.0] U/l) had higher CK-MB concentrations than normal dogs (90 [78–134.5] ng/ml) (p = 0.008). In conclusion, cTnI and CK-MB concentrations increase in DKA dogs. With higher cTnI concentrations, dogs have a higher risk of death.
