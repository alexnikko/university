Therapeutic tumor vaccination based on dendritic cells (DC) is safe; however, its efficacy is low. Among the reasons for only a subset of patients benefitting from DC-based immunotherapy is an insufficient potency of in vitro generated classical DCs (cDCs), made by treating monocytes with GM-CSF + IL-4 + maturation factors. Recent studies demonstrated that CD137L (4-1BBL, TNFSF9) signaling differentiates human monocytes to a highly potent novel type of DC (CD137L-DCs) which have an inflammatory phenotype and are closely related to in vivo DCs. Here, we show that CD137L-DCs induce potent CD8+ T-cell responses against Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) and Hepatitis B virus (HBV), and that T cells primed by CD137L-DCs more effectively lyse EBV+ and HBV+ target cells. The chemokine profile of CD137L-DCs identifies them as inflammatory DCs, and they polarize CD8+ T cells to a Tc1 phenotype. Expression of exhaustion markers is reduced on T cells activated by CD137L-DCs. Furthermore, these T cells are metabolically more active and have a higher capacity to utilize glucose. CD137L-induced monocyte to DC differentiation leads to the formation of AIM2 inflammasome, with IL-1beta contributing to CD137L-DCs possessing a stronger T cell activation ability. CD137L-DCs are effective in crosspresentation. PGE2 as a maturation factor is required for enhancing migration of CD137L-DCs but does not significantly reduce their potency. This study shows that CD137L-DCs have a superior ability to activate T cells and to induce potent Tc1 responses against the cancer-causing viruses EBV and HBV which suggest CD137L-DCs as promising candidates for DC-based tumor immunotherapy.
