Partial sacrectomy is a radical procedure that benefits a select group of patients with locally advanced primary or recurrent rectal cancer with posterior extension and carries potential for significant morbidity. This study was done to evaluate the morbidity and oncological outcome of patients who underwent partial sacral resection for rectal cancer in a tertiary cancer center. Seventeen patients underwent partial sacrectomy during the period from 2011 to 2015. Eleven patients had primary and six had recurrent rectal cancer. All patients were evaluated with MRI pelvis and metastatic evaluation with CT scan of the chest and abdomen and PET scan in patients with recurrent cancer. All patients had resection below the level of S2/S3 junction or lower. Three patients were females and the remaining were males. Median age was 56 years. Overall morbidity was 76% and most common morbidity was wound related. The mean estimated relapse-free survival (RFS) for patients treated for primary rectal cancer was 20.3 months (95% confidence interval (CI), 12.8–27.9) and the mean estimated overall survival (OS) 23.9 months. Estimated mean RFS for patients who were operated for recurrent rectal cancer was 25.6 months (95% CI, 17.7–33.5) and the median RFS was yet to reach. Estimated mean OS was 29.7 months (95% CI, 15.5–43.8) and the median OS was 39.6 months. Partial sacrectomy below the level of S2/S3 junction is a safe approach to facilitate en bloc resection of locally advanced primary and recurrent rectal cancer extending posteriorly with loss of plane with sacrum. In selected patients, this approach can improve survival at the cost of high morbidity.
