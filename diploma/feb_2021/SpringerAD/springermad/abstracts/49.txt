Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is a potentially lethal outcome of pulmonary embolism. Balloon pulmonary angioplasty (BPA) is aimed at improving pulmonary perfusion and pulmonary hemodynamics and has gained a lot of interest recently in patients either unsuitable for or refractory to surgical pulmonary endarterectomy. This article outlines the clinical features and diagnostic criteria, imaging evaluation, current medical and surgical treatment options for CTEPH. BPA is discussed in detail, focusing on the rationale, patient selection, technical details, post-procedural care and outcomes.
