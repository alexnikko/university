GBM is the highest incidence in primary intracranial malignancy, and it remains poor prognosis even though the patient is gave standard treatment. Despite decades of intense research, the complex biology of GBM remains elusive. In view of eight hallmarks of cancer which were proposed in 2011, studies related to the eight biological capabilities in GBM have made great progress. From these studies, it can be inferred that miRs, as a mode of post-transcriptional regulation, are involved in regulating these malignant biological hallmarks of GBM. Herein, we discuss state-of-the-art research on how aberrant miRs modulate the eight hallmarks of GBM. The upregulation of ‘oncomiRs’ or the genetic loss of tumor suppressor miRs is associated with these eight biological capabilities acquired during GBM formation. Furthermore, we also discuss the applicable clinical potential of these research results. MiRs may aid in the diagnosis and prognosis of GBM. Moreover, miRs are also therapeutic targets of GBM. These studies will develop and improve precision medicine for GBM in the future.
