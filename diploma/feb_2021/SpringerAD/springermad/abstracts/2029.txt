Hydrocephalus is one of the most common sequelae after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), and it is a large contributor to the condition’s high rates of readmission and mortality. Our objective was to quantify the healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) and health economic burden incurred by the US health system due to post-aSAH hydrocephalus. The Truven Health MarketScan® Research database was used to retrospectively quantify the prevalence and HCRU associated with hydrocephalus in aSAH patients undergoing surgical clipping or endovascular coiling from 2008 to 2015. Multivariable longitudinal analysis was conducted to model the relationship between annual cost and hydrocephalus status. In total, 2374 patients were included; hydrocephalus was diagnosed in 959 (40.4%). Those with hydrocephalus had significantly longer initial lengths of stay (median 19.0 days vs. 12.0 days, p < .001) and higher 30-day readmission rates (20.5% vs. 10.4%, p < .001). With other covariates held fixed, in the first 90 days after aSAH diagnosis, the average cost multiplier relative to annual baseline for hydrocephalus patients was 24.60 (95% CI, 20.13 to 30.06; p < .001) whereas for non-hydrocephalus patients, it was 11.52 (95% CI, 9.89 to 13.41; p < .001). The 5-year cumulative median total cost for the hydrocephalus group was $230,282.38 (IQR, 166,023.65 to 318,962.35) versus $174,897.72 (IQR, 110,474.24 to 271,404.80) for those without hydrocephalus. We characterize one of the largest cohorts of post-aSAH hydrocephalus patients in the USA. Importantly, the substantial health economic impact and long-term morbidity and costs from this condition are quantified and reviewed.
