Quetiapine fumarate (QF), a novel antipsychotic agent, has got poor brain uptake because of its poor oral bioavailability (9Â %) due to extensive first-pass metabolism. The aim of this study was to develop QF microemulsion formulation to enhance the bioavailability and to accomplish the intranasal delivery of the drug to the brain. Mucoadhesive in situ gelling systems of QF were formulated to increase the residence time of dosage form and provide sustained release of the drug.
