Xenon (Xe) is a bioactive gas capable of reducing and stabilizing neurologic injury in stroke. The goal of this work was to develop lipid-shelled microbubbles for xenon loading and ultrasound-triggered release. Microbubbles loaded with either xenon (Xe-MB) or xenon and octafluoropropane (Xe-OFP-MB) (9:1 v/v) were synthesized by high-shear mixing. The size distribution and the frequency-dependent attenuation coefficient of Xe-MB and Xe-OFP-MB were measured using a Coulter counter and a broadband acoustic attenuation spectroscopy system, respectively. The Xe dose was evaluated using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The total Xe doses in Xe-MB and Xe-OFP-MB were 113.1 ± 13.5 and 145.6 ± 25.5 μl per mg of lipid, respectively. Co-encapsulation of OFP increased the total xenon dose, attenuation coefficient, microbubble stability (in an undersaturated solution), and shelf life of the agent. Triggered release of gas payload was demonstrated with 6-MHz duplex Doppler and 220-kHz pulsed ultrasound. These results constitute the first step toward the use of lipid-shelled microbubbles for applications such as neuroprotection in stroke.
