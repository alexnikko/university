Structural identifiability is an often overlooked, but essential, prerequisite to the experiment design stage. The application of structural identifiability analysis to models of myelosuppression is used to demonstrate the importance of its considerations. It is shown that, under certain assumptions, these models are structurally identifiable and so drug and system specific parameters can truly be separated. Further it is shown via a meta-analysis of the literature that because of this the reported system parameter estimates for the “Friberg” or “Uppsala” model are consistent in the literature.
