The prognostic value of left ventricular dyssynchrony measured by gated single-photon emission computed tomography (GSPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) and its relationship to electrical dyssynchrony measured by QRS duration are incompletely understood. The aim of this study was therefore to examine the independent and incremental prognostic value of dyssynchrony in yet the largest group of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).
