Inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) are a diagnostic challenge to clinicians. Autoimmune encephalitis (AE) is an important diagnostic consideration in patients with CNS inflammatory disorders; despite of a wide range of neuropsychiatric symptoms it should be diagnosed as soon as possible and the patient transferred to the neurologist. We studied a group of AE patients (n = 24) as compared to multiple sclerosis (MS, n = 61) and control (n = 19) groups. Detailed clinical pictures of patients are presented. We focused on relevant cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests like protein levels, cytosis and oligoclonal bands, neuroinflammation indices (interleukin-6, soluble receptor of IL-6, neopterin, anti-ribosomal proteins antibodies) and markers of neurodegeneration (phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain, pNfh). Elevated neopterin level was found in AE group as compared to the MS and control groups, while protein and pNfh were increased in both AE and MS groups. In the MS group, the cytosis and soluble receptor of IL-6 were higher as compared to the control group. Anti-ribosomal proteins antibodies were increased in a single patient with AE. High levels of protein were predictive of mortality in AE patients, while IL-6 and pNfh were elevated in severe AE patients. AE patients with paraneoplastic etiology demonstrated oligoclonal bands positivity. Taken together, our results suggest the neopterin as an additional marker of autoimmune brain inflammation. Though higher levels of protein, IL-6 and pNfh were found in patients with severe disease progression and death, prognostic values of these markers should be validated in larger cohorts of patients.
