Cancer metastases are accountable for almost 90% of all human cancer related deaths including from breast cancer (BC). Adipocytes can alter the tumor microenvironment, which can promote metastasis by inducing an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in BC cells. However, the role of adipocytes during the mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET), that can be important in metastasis, is not clear. To understand the effect of adipocytes on the BC progression, there is a requirement for a better in vitro 3-dimensional (3D) co-culture system that mimics the breast tissue and allows for more accurate analysis of EMT and MET. We developed a co-culture system to analyze the relationship of BC cells grown in a 3D culture with adipocytes. We found that adipocytes and adipocyte-derived conditioned media, but not pre-adipocytes, caused the mesenchymal MDA-MB-231 and Hs578t cells to form significantly more epithelial-like structures when compared to the typical stellate colonies formed in control 3D cultures. SUM159 cells and MCF7 cells had a less dramatic shift as they normally have more epithelial-like structure in 3D culture. Biomarker expression analysis revealed that adipocytes only induced a partial MET with proliferation unaffected. In addition, adipocytes had reduced lipid droplet size when co-cultured with BC cells. Thus, we found that physical interaction with adipocytes and ECM changes the mesenchymal phenotype of BC cells in a manner that could promote secondary tumor formation.
