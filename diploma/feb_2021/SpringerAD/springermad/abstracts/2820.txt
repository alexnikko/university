Human breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease with numerous subtypes that have been defined through immunohistological, histological, and gene expression patterns. The diversity of breast cancer has made the study of its various underlying causes complex. To facilitate the examination of particular facets of breast cancer, mouse models have been generated, ranging from carcinogen induced models to genetically engineered mice. While mouse models have been generated to mimic the initiating event, including p53 loss, BRCA loss, or overexpression of HER2 / Neu / erbB2, other genomic events are often not well characterized. However, these secondary genetic events are often critical to the mouse tumor evolution, subtype, and outcome, just as they are in human breast cancer. As such, these other genomic events are a critical component of what models are chosen to study specific subtypes of human breast cancer. Here we review the genomic analyses that have been completed for various genetically engineered mouse models, how they compare to human breast cancer, and detail how this information can be used in choosing a mouse model for analysis.
