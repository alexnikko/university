We investigated whether 50 Hz wave (3 mT) extremely low frequency electromagnetic field (ELF-EMF) had effect on ovarian tissue biochemical parameters and whether Allium cepa and cinnamon can reduce potential adverse effects of electromagnetic exposure. Forty female Wistar rats were subdivided into four groups; (1) a control group received 3 cc normal saline (0.9%) daily and was treated for 6 weeks, (2) a group exposed to ELF-EMF of 3 mT for 4 h/day 7 days/week for 6 weeks, (3) a group received Allium cepa and cinnamon (75 mg/kg body weight) daily for 6 weeks, (4) and a group exposed to ELF-EMF and received Allium cepa and cinnamon. On the 42nd day of research, 5 cc blood was collected from all the rats to measure serum malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, glutathione peroxidase (GPX), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT). Right ovaries were removed and prepared for electron microscopy study. Level of MDA significantly increased in the second group exposed to ELF-EMF (P < 0.05) and decreased in groups that received of Allium cepa and cinnamon (75 mg/kg body weight) (P < 0.05) in comparison to the control group. As well, levels of SOD, GPX, and CAT, significantly decreased in the second group (P < 0.05) and increased in groups that received Allium cepa and cinnamon (P < 0.05). Using Allium cepa and cinnamon as a nutritional supplements has beneficial effects on protection of reproductive systems in this life area population exposed to electromagnetic field.
