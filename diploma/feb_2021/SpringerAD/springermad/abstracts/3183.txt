The objective of present study was to increase solubility and dissolution performance of a poorly water soluble antidiabetic drug, Nateglinide (NAT), through formation of inclusion complexes with hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP–β–CD). The effect of L-arginine (ARG), an amino acid, on the complexation efficiency and solubility enhancing power of HP–β–CD was investigated by preparing ternary inclusion complexes.
