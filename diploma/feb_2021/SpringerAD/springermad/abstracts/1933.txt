Inflammation within the brain and in peripheral tissues contributes to brain injury following ischemic stroke. Therapeutic modulation of the inflammatory response has been actively pursued as a novel stroke treatment approach for decades, without success. In recent years, extensive studies support the high potential for cell-based therapies to become a new treatment modality for stroke and other neurological disorders. In this review, we explore different types of cellular therapies and discuss how they modulate central and peripheral inflammatory processes after stroke. Apart from identifying potential targets for cell therapy, we also discuss paracrine and immunomodulatory mechanisms of cell therapy.
