Conflicting results have been reported regarding the association of gene polymorphisms in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) with different aspects of coronary artery disease (CAD), such as myocardial infarction, neointimal hyperplasia or coronary artery vasomotion. Since previous studies have linked angiotensin II to aneurysmal disease, our study hypothesis was that RAS gene polymorphisms may be associated with aneurysm remodeling in response to CAD.
