The aim of this study is to provide a systematic review of the known epigenetic alterations caused by cigarette smoke; establish an evidence-based perspective of their clinical value for screening, diagnosis, and treatment of smoke-related disorders; and discuss the challenges and ethical concerns associated with epigenetic studies. A well-defined, reproducible search strategy was employed to identify relevant literature (clinical, cellular, and animal-based) between 2000 and 2019 based on AMSTAR guidelines. A total of 80Â studies were identified that reported alterations in DNA methylation, histone modifications, and miRNA expression following exposure to cigarette smoke. Changes in DNA methylation were most extensively documented for genes including AHRR, F2RL3, DAPK, and p16 after exposure to cigarette smoke. Likewise, miR16, miR21, miR146, and miR222 were identified to be differentially expressed in smokers and exhibit potential as biomarkers for determining susceptibility to COPD. We also identified 22 studies highlighting the transgenerational effects of maternal and paternal smoking on offspring. This systematic review lists the epigenetic events/alterations known to occur in response to cigarette smoke exposure and identifies the major genes and miRNAs that are potential targets for translational research in associated pathologies. Importantly, the limitations and ethical concerns related to epigenetic studies are also highlighted, as are the effects on the ability to address specific questions associated with exposure to tobacco/cigarette smoke. In the future, improved interpretation of epigenetic signatures will lead to their increased use as biomarkers and/or in drug development.
