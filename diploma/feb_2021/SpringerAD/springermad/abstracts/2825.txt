Mixed tumors are characterized by the histological identification of two or more cell types. Commonly, a mixture of epithelial and myoepithelial cells is included in abundant stroma, which can consist of myxoid, chondroid or bony matrices. Spontaneously arising mixed tumors are rare lesions in the human breast but are common in human salivary glands and canine mammary glands. Subtle histopathological characteristics and overlapping attributes of malignant lesions with other benign lesions can lead to a diagnostic challenge. Mixed tumors can present as benign or malignant. While malignant mixed tumors are quite rare in the human breast they have a poor prognosis. Benign mixed mammary tumors occur more frequently in female dogs than in humans and are usually associated with a good prognosis. This review will provide a comprehensive overview of mixed mammary tumors, across various mammalian species.
