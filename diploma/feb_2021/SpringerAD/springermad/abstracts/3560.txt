Assessments of cancer survivors’ health-related needs are often limited to national estimates. State-specific information is vital to inform state comprehensive cancer control efforts developed to support patients and providers. We investigated demographics, health status/quality of life, health behaviors, and health care characteristics of long-term Utah cancer survivors compared to Utahans without a history of cancer. Utah Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2009 and 2010 data were used. Individuals diagnosed with cancer within the past 5 years were excluded. Multivariable survey weighted logistic regressions and computed predictive marginals were used to estimate age-adjusted percentages and 95 % confidence intervals (CI). A total of 11,320 eligible individuals (727 cancer survivors, 10,593 controls) were included. Respondents were primarily non-Hispanic White (95.3 % of survivors, 84.1 % of controls). Survivors were older (85 % of survivors ≥40 years of age vs. 47 % of controls). Survivors reported the majority of their cancer survivorship care was managed by primary care physicians or non-cancer specialists (93.5 %, 95 % CI = 87.9–99.1). Furthermore, 71.1 % (95 % CI = 59.2–82.9) of survivors reported that they did not receive a cancer treatment summary. In multivariable estimates, fair/poor general health was more common among survivors compared to controls (17.8 %, 95 % CI = 12.5–23.1 vs. 14.2 %, 95 % CI = 12.4–16.0). Few survivors in Utah receive follow-up care from a cancer specialist. Provider educational efforts are needed to promote knowledge of cancer survivor issues. Efforts should be made to improve continuity in follow-up care that addresses the known issues of long-term survivors that preclude optimal quality of life, resulting in a patient-centered approach to survivorship.
