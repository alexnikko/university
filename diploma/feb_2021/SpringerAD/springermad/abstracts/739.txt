Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare disorder of the mucociliary clearance leading to recurrent upper and lower respiratory tract infections. PCD is difficult to clinically distinguish from other entities leading to recurrent oto-sino-pulmonary infections, including primary immunodeficiency (PID). Nasal nitric oxide (nNO) is a sensitive and specific diagnostic test for PCD, but it has not been thoroughly examined in PID. Past publications have suggested an overlap in nNO levels among subjects with PCD and PID. We sought to determine if nNO measurements among patients diagnosed with PID would fall significantly above the established PCD diagnostic cutoff value of 77Â nL/min.
