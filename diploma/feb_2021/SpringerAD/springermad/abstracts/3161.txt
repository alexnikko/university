Continuous manufacturing (CM) promises unrestricted scale up of production volume through runtime, together with lower product quality variability through stricter process control. However, unforeseen incidents that disrupt the processâ€™ steady state or even force temporary shutdown of the line may threaten this promise. A thorough, variable rate control strategy that assures constant product quality through model-based adaption of process parameters in real time while scaling material throughput together with appropriate buffers, can buy time for incident handling and mitigate the risk of complete shutdown. As experience on development of such a variable rate control strategy is limited up to this date, the presented paper is intended as a general guideline that is transferable to other CM processes.
