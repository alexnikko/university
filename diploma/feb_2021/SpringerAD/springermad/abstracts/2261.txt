Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is commonly diagnosed by vast extracellular amyloid deposits and existence of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. In accordance with the literature, age-related loss of sex steroid hormones in either males or females was found in relation to AD subjects. The dynamics of these hormones have been previously described in both physiological and pathological conditions with the evidence of changes in various intracellular signalings regarding the neurodegenerative disease. The potent protective effects of sex steroid hormones and their synthetic analogs are indicative of the decrease in the accumulated levels of intercellular beta-amyloid (Aβ) protein and an increase of specific proteases activity, resulting in the improvement of pathological features. In the current review, we focused on the dynamic of signaling pathway related to sex steroid hormones. It is logical to hypothesize that androgen hormones have regulatory actions on the kinetics of Aβ which make them as a promising preventive approach for neurodegenerative diseases in the near future.
