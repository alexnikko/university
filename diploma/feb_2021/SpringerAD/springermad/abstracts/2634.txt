 Brucellosis in humans is one of the most important zoonotic diseases worldwide. This disease causes weakness, fever, pain, sweats, and complications in the liver, spleen, and lymphatic system; Brucellosis requires long-term antibiotic therapy. This study attempts to identify Brucella abortus via an immunofluorescence (IF) test considering antibody against an outer membrane protein with 16-kDa molecular weight (OMP16). The B. abortus OMP16 protein was synthesized through cloning and expressing of the related gene and finally was purified to immunize rabbit in order to produce a polyclonal antibody. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) was attached to the antibody and the prepared complex was applied to screening of Brucella spp., as an IF test. Polyclonal antibody obtained from the sera of immunized rabbit with the purified OMP16 showed a strong reactivity in ELISA and properly identified the B. abortus strain in IF test. So, this high titer of antibody could be helpful for tracing of B. abortus via laboratory diagnostic tests.
