The aim of the current study is to investigate the effects of CO (carbon monoxide) on the cardiovascular system via electrocardiographic, echocardiographic and biochemical findings in children. This prospective study included 22 children with CO poisoning and 24 healthy children as a control group. The CO-intoxicated children were evaluated via electrocardiography and echocardiography 1 h after admission to the emergency department and daily until their discharge from the hospital. Blood gasses, complete blood account, troponin I and creatinine kinase-MB(CK-MB) were assessed daily. Tpeak–end (p:0.001), QTc durations (p:0.02), Tpeak–end dispersion (p:0.001) and Tpeak–end/QT ratio (p:0.001) of CO-intoxicated patients were significantly higher than those in the control group. Mitral E duration (p:0.001), mitral E/A ratio (p:0.001) and left ventricle contractile fraction (p:0.023) at admission were significantly lower, and left ventricle myocardial performance index was higher (p:0.001) in the CO poisoning group. Troponin I and CK-MB levels were higher at admission in 6 (27 %) and 4 (18 %) patients, respectively. The heart is the most critical organ in pediatric CO poisoning. These children present subclinical systolic and diastolic left ventricle dysfunction even in mild cases. Although, in children with acute CO-intoxication ventricular repolarization is impaired, it seems to be reversible like other findings.
