Our main aim was to evaluate the role of caspases’ genes SNPs in Philadelphia-chromosome negative chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (PN-MPNs) susceptibility. A case-control study in 133 Caucasian Portuguese PN-MPNs patients and 281 matched controls was carried out, studying SNPs in apoptosis related caspases: rs1045485 and rs1035142 (CASP8), rs1052576, rs2308950, rs1132312 and rs1052571 (CASP9), rs2227309 and rs2227310 (CASP7) and rs13006529 (CASP10). After stratification by pathology diagnosis for essential thrombocythemia (ET), female gender or JAK2 positive, there is a significant increased risk for those carrying at least one variant allele for CASP9 (C653T) polymorphism (OR 2.300 CI 95% [1.180–4.484], P = 0.014). However, when considered individually, none of the studied caspases polymorphisms was associated with PN-MPNs risk. Our results do not reveal a significant involvement of caspase genes polymorphisms on the individual susceptibility towards PN-MPNs as a whole. However, for essential thrombocythemia (ET), female gender or JAK2 positive, there is a significant increased risk to those carrying at least one variant allele for CASP9. Although larger studies are required to confirm these results and to provide conclusive evidence of association between these and other caspases variants and PN-MPNs susceptibility, these new data may contribute to a best knowledge of the pathophysiology of these disorders and, in the future, to a more rational and efficient choice of therapeutic strategies to be adopted in PN-MPNs treatment.
