Falls in patients with neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) have enormous detrimental consequences. A better understanding of the interplay between physical activity (PA) and fall risk might help to reduce fall frequency. We aimed to investigate the association between sensor-based PA and fall risk in NDDs, using “falls per individual PA exposure time” as a novel measure. Eighty-eight subjects (n = 31 degenerative ataxia (DA), n = 14 Parkinson’s disease (PD), n = 12 progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and 31 healthy controls) were included in this pilot study. PA was recorded in free-living environments with three-axial accelerometers (activPAL™) over 7 days. Falls were prospectively assessed over 12 months. Fall incidence was calculated by (i) absolute number of falls per person years (py) and (ii) falls per exposure to individual PA. Absolute fall incidence was high in all three NDDs, with differing levels (DA, 9 falls/py; PD, 14 falls/py; PSP, 29 falls/py). Providing a more fine-grained view on fall risk, correction for individual exposure to PA revealed that measures of low walking PA were associated with higher fall incidence in all three NDDs. Additionally, higher fall incidence was associated with more sit-to-stand transfers in PD and longer walking bouts in PSP. Our results suggest that low walking PA is a risk factor for falls in DA, PD and PSP, indicating the potential benefit of increasing individual PA in these NDDs to reduce fall risk. Moreover, they show that correction for individual exposure to PA yields a more differentiated view on fall risk within and across NDDs.
