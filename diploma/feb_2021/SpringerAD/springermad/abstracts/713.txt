The benefit of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition in chronic heart failure (HF) is partially due to its effects on pulmonary function and particularly on lung diffusion, the latter being counteracted by acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). Tissue ACE activity is largely determined by an insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism resulting in three possible genotypes (DD, ID and II). It is not clear if ACE inhibitor therapy could exert different effects in these genotypes. The aim of the study was to understand whether I/D polymorphism interferes with ACE inhibitorâ€™s protection of the lungs in HF during acute fluid overload.
