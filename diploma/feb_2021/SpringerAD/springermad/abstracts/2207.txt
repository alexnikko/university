Microglia plays a critical role in the brain and protects neuronal cells from toxins. However, over-activation of microglia leads to deleterious effects. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has been reported to affect neuronal cells via activation of microglia as well as directly to initiate neuroinflammation. In the present study, we evaluated the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effect of anthocyanins against LPS-induced neurotoxicity in an animal model and in cell cultures. Intraperitoneal injections of LPS (250 μg/kg/day for 1 week) induce ROS production and promote neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration which ultimately leads to memory impairment. However, anthocyanins treatment at a dose of 24 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks (1 week before and 1 week co-treated with LPS) prevented ROS production, inhibited neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, and improved memory functions in LPS-treated mice. Both histological and immunoblot analysis indicated that anthocyanins reversed the activation of JNK, prevented neuroinflammation by lowering the levels of inflammatory markers (p-NF-kB, TNF-α, and IL-1β), and reduced neuronal apoptosis by reducing the expression of Bax, cytochrome c, cleaved caspase-3, and cleaved PARP-1, while increasing the level of survival proteins p-Akt, p-GSK3β, and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein. Anthocyanins treatment increased the levels of memory-related pre- and post-synaptic proteins and improved the hippocampus-dependent memory in the LPS-treated mice. Overall, this data suggested that consumption of naturally derived anti-oxidant agent such as anthocyanins ameliorated several pathological events in the LPS-treated animal model and we believe that anthocyanins would be a safe therapeutic agent for slowing the inflammation-induced neurodegeneration in the brain against several diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease.
