The pelvis is composed of three paired primary ossification centers: the pubis, the ischium and the ilium. During maturation, multiple secondary ossification centers can be seen in the synchondroses between these bones and in the pelvic apophyses. The fragmented appearance of these centers can be confused with pathology.
