Currently, pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) is considered a common and feasibly performed surgery for periampullary tumours, but it is still a high-risk surgical procedure with potential morbidity and mortality rates. Previously, it was emphasised for the need of high-volume centres to perform specialised surgery such as PD. The authors have made an attempt to know the relation between low-volume centre and outcomes of PD. The study was conducted in a Tier-II city referral hospital located in Karnataka, India. A total of 37 patients with suspected periampullary neoplasms underwent surgical exploration with curative intent over a period of 4 years, i.e. from May 2012 to May 2016. Out of 37 patients, 26 underwent PD, either classic Whipple resection (n = 01) or pylorus-preserving modification (n = 25). In 11 patients, resection was not possible, where biliary and gastric drainage procedures were done. All patients were treated by standardised post-operative care protocols for pancreatic resection used at our centre. We recorded the perioperative outcome along with demographics, indications for surgery, and pre- and intra-operative factors of PD. Post-operative pancreatic fistulae were evident in 4 patients. Two patients had hepaticojejunostomy leak. One patient had chyle leak. Three patients had infection at the surgical site. One patient had post-operative pneumonia leading to mortality. None of the patients had post-op haemorrhage. The surgeon volume and surgeon experience may have minimal contributing factor in post-operative morbidity, especially if there is availability of well-equipped ICU and imaging facilities, along with well-experienced personnel like oncosurgeon, anaesthesiologist, intensivist, radiologist, and nursing staff. There is a need of a multicentre study from Tier-II city hospitals/low-volume centres and high-volume centres to come with perioperative surgical outcomes following PD.
