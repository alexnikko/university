Studies have shown that the expression profile of Wnt signaling pathway is very important in lung adenocarcinoma (LAD) and some lncRNAs can regulate the expression of key molecules of Wnt pathway. However, Wnt pathway related lncRNAs are not systematically analyzed and detected in lung adenocarcinoma. We used a high-throughput microarray to compare the lncRNA expression profiles in LAD and corresponding normal tissue (NT) samples. Several candidate Wnt pathway related lncRNAs were verified by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. We found that 232 Wnt pathway related lncRNAs were obviously expressed (≥2-fold change) in lung adenocarcinoma samples and 13 Wnt pathway related lncRNAs were aberrantly expressed in lung adenocarcinoma compared with matched histologically normal lung tissues by qPCR. Among these, RP11-181G12.2 and RP11-89 K21.1 were the most aberrantly expressed lncRNAs. Our study ascertained the expression of Wnt pathway related lncRNAs in lung adenocarcinoma. The results revealed that many Wnt pathway related lncRNAs were differentially expressed in lung adenocarcinoma tissues, suggesting that they may play a key role in tumor development.
