Carvedilol is a third generation non-cardioselective Î²-blocker used in the treatment of hypertension and demonstrated a potential in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases such as myocardial infarction and arrhythmias. For any drug to be therapeutically effective, it must enter the systemic circulation and to do so, it should have an optimum aqueous solubility at the site of absorption which is a major hurdle to overcome by a formulation scientist. Carvedilol belongs to BCS (biopharmaceutical classification system) class II drugs, thus having low solubility and poor bioavailability (around 25%). Hence, the purpose of this review is to elaborate on several approaches to increase the solubility, dissolution, and bioavailability of carvedilol.
