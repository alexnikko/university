Approximately 5 to 7% of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for the treatment of coronary artery disease require chronic oral anticoagulation (OAC) on top of aspirin and a P2Y12 receptor antagonist, mainly due to non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF). The advent of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) increased treatment options, while there is cumulative evidence that dual combination of a NOAC and a P2Y12 receptor antagonist attenuates risk of bleeding, compared to traditional triple therapy, consisting of a vitamin K antagonist (VKA), aspirin, and a P2Y12 receptor antagonist, without significantly compromising efficacy.
