Hepatocyte-specific contrast agents (HSCAs) are a group of intravenous gadolinium-based MRI contrast agents that can be used to characterize hepatobiliary pathology. The mechanism by which these agents are taken up by hepatocytes and partially excreted into the biliary tree improves characterization of hepatic lesions and biliary abnormalities relative to conventional extracellular gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs). This manuscript presents an overview of HSCA use in pediatric patients with the intent to provide radiologists a guide for clinical use. We review available HSCAs and discuss dosing and age specifications for use in children. We also review various hepatic and biliary indications for HSCA use in children, with emphasis on the imaging characteristics distinct to HSCAs, as well as discussion of pitfalls one can encounter when imaging with HSCAs. Given the growing concern regarding gadolinium deposition in soft tissues and brain, we also discuss safety of HSCA use in children.
