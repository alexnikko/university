Pulmonary congestion (PC) is associated with an increased risk of hospitalization and death in patients with heart failure (HF). Lung ultrasound has shown to be highly sensitive for detecting PC in HF. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether lung ultrasoundâ€“guided therapy improves 6-month outcomes in patients with HF compared with conventional treatment.
