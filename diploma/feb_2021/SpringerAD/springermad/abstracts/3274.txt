The aim of this study was an in vitro evaluation and comparison of the cytotoxic effects of free nisin and nisin-loaded PLA-PEG-PLA nanoparticles on gastrointestinal (AGS and KYSE-30), hepatic (HepG2), and blood (K562) cancer cell lines. To create this novel anti-cancer drug delivery system, the nanoparticles were synthesized and then loaded with nisin. Subsequently, their biocompatibility, ability to enter cells, and physicochemical properties, including formation, size, and shape, were studied using hemolysis, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively. Then, its loading efficiency and release kinetics were examined to assess the potential impact of this formulation for the nanoparticle carrier candidacy. The cytotoxicities of nisin and nisin-loaded nanoparticles were evaluated by using the MTT and Neutral Red (NR) uptake assays. Detections of the apoptotic cells were done via Ethidium Bromide (EB)/Acridine Orange (AO) staining. The FTIR spectra, SEM images, and DLS graph confirmed the formations of the nanoparticles and nisin-loaded nanoparticles with spherical, distinct, and smooth surfaces and average sizes of 100 and 200 nm, respectively. The loading efficiency of the latter nanoparticles was about 85–90%. The hemolysis test represented their non-cytotoxicities and the FITC images indicated their entrance inside the cells. An increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells was observed through EB/AO staining. These results demonstrated that nisin had a cytotoxic effect on AGS, KYSE-30, HepG2, and K562 cancer cell lines, while the cytotoxicity of nisin-loaded nanoparticles was more than that of the free nisin.
