Microspherule protein 1 (MCRS1) is a candidate oncogene and participates in various cellular processes, including growth, migration, senescence and transformation. MCRS1 is overexpressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and promotes the growth of cancer cells. However, the mechanisms driving these processes are not fully understood.
