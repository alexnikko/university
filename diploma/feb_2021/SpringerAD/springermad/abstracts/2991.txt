The later-line treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) has been drastically changing by the development of immune-oncology drugs and molecular targeted treatment in recent years. Although the International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC) model is useful for second-line setting, this model has the problem that over 50% patients are classified as intermediate risk group. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether the serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels prior to second-line treatment could divide intermediate risk group patients.
