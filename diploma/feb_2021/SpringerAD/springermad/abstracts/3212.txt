This paper presents a real-time process management (RTPM) strategy for Dropwise Additive Manufacturing of Pharmaceutical Products (DAMPP), a mini-manufacturing method for pharmaceutical dosage forms. The semicontinuous, small-scale nature of DAMPP allows for more automation and control than traditional large-scale batch pharmaceutical manufacturing processes and can be used to manufacturing drug products with precise amounts of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), suitable for production of high-potency drug products or individualized medicine.
