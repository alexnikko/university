There has recently been a paradigm shift in the field of dendritic cell (DC)-based immunotherapy, where several clinical studies have confirmed the feasibility and advantageousness of using directly isolated human blood-derived DCs over in vitro differentiated subsets. There are two major DC subsets found in blood; plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) and myeloid DCs (mDCs), and both have been tested clinically. CD1c+ mDCs are highly efficient antigen-presenting cells that have the ability to secrete IL-12p70, while pDCs are professional IFN-α-secreting cells that are shown to induce innate immune responses in melanoma patients. Hence, combining mDCs and pDCs poses as an attractive, multi-functional vaccine approach. However, type I IFNs have been reported to inhibit IL-12p70 production and mDC-induced T-cell activation. In this study, we investigate the effect of IFN-α on mDC maturation and function. We demonstrate that both recombinant IFN-α and activated pDCs strongly enhance mDC maturation and increase IL-12p70 production. Co-cultured mDCs and pDCs additionally have beneficial effect on NK and NKT-cell activation and also enhances IFN-γ production by allogeneic T cells. In contrast, the presence of type I IFNs reduces the proliferative T-cell response. The mere presence of a small fraction of activated pDCs is sufficient for these effects and the required ratio between the subsets is non-stringent. Taken together, these results support the usage of mDCs and pDCs combined into one immunotherapeutic vaccine with broad immunostimulatory features.
