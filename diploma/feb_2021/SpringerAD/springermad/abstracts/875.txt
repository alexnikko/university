Current clinical experience with immunomodulatory agents and monoclonal antibodies in principle has established the benefit of depleting lymphocytic populations in relapsingâ€“remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). B and T cells may exert multiple pro-inflammatory actions, but also possess regulatory functions making their role in RRMS pathogenesis much more complex. There is no clear correlation of Tregs and Bregs with clinical features of the disease. Herein, we discuss the emerging data on regulatory T and B cell subset distributions in MS and their roles in the pathophysiology of MS and its murine model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In addition, we summarize the immunomodulatory properties of certain MS therapeutic agents through their effect on such regulatory cell subsets and their relevance to clinical outcomes.
