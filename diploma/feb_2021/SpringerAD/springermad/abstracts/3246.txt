Brillouin light scattering (BLS), a technique theoretically described nearly a century back by the French physicist Léon Brillouin in 1922, is a light-scattering method for determining the mechanical properties of materials. This inelastic scattering method is described by the Bragg diffraction of light from a propagating fluctuation in the local dielectric. These fluctuations arise spontaneously from thermally populated sound waves intrinsic to all materials, and thus BLS may be broadly applied to transparent samples of any phase. This review begins with a brief historical overview of the development of BLS, from its theoretical prediction to the current state of the art, and notes specific technological advancements that enabled the development of BLS. Despite the broad utility of BLS, no commercial spectrometer is currently available for purchase, but rather individual components are assembled to suit a specific application. Central to any BLS spectrometer is the interferometer, and its performance characteristics—scanning or non-scanning, multi-passing, and stabilization—are critical considerations for spectrometer design. Consistent with any light-scattering method, the frequency shift is a key observable in BLS, and we summarize the connection of this measurement to evaluate the mechanical properties of materials. With emphasis toward pharmaceutical materials analysis, we introduce the traditional BLS approach for single-crystal elasticity, and this is followed by a discussion of more recent developments in powder BLS. We conclude our review with a perspective on future developments in BLS that may enable BLS as a novel addition to the current catalog of process analytical technologies.
