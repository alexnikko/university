Antipsychotic-induced weight gain (AIWG) is a common adverse effect of this treatment, particularly with second-generation antipsychotics, and it is a major health problem around the world. We aimed to review the progress of pharmacogenetic studies on AIWG in the Chinese population to compare the results for Chinese with other ethnic populations, identify the limitations and problems of current studies, and provide future research directions in China. Both English and Chinese electronic databases were searched to identify eligible studies. We determined that >Â 25 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 19 genes have been investigated in association with AIWG in Chinese patients over the past few decades. HTR2C rs3813929 is the most frequently studied single-nucleotide polymorphism, and it seems to be the most strongly associated with AIWG in the Chinese population. However, many genes that have been reported to be associated with AIWG in other ethnic populations have not been included in Chinese studies. To explain the pharmacogenetic reasons for AIWG in the Chinese population, genome-wide association studies and multiple-center, standard, unified, and large samples are needed.
