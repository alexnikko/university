The current diagnosis of infective endocarditis (IE) is based on the modified Duke criteria, which has approximately 80% sensitivity for the diagnosis of native valve endocarditis (NVE), with lower sensitivity for the diagnosis of prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) and culture-negative endocarditis. There is preliminary evidence that 18F-FDG PET/CT is an adjunctive diagnostic test with high accuracy reported in small studies to date. We therefore performed a meta-analysis of studies evaluating the use of PET/CT in the diagnosis of IE to establish a more precise estimate of accuracy.
