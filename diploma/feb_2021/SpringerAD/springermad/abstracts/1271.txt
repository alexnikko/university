The purpose of this study was to develop a recombinant adenovirus with secretory leukoprotease inhibitor (SLPI) promoter-controlled expression for gene therapy of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). An artificial microRNA targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was designed, and used to construct a replication-defective recombinant adenovirus with SLPI promoter-controlled expression. The silencing efficiency of this vector (Ad-SLPI-EGFRamiR) was detected in Hep-2 cells. Western blotting showed that the expression of 170 kD EGFR was significantly reduced in Hep-2 cells 72 h after infection with Ad-SLPI-EGFRamiR. At a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 200 pfu/cell, proliferation of Hep-2 cells was highly inhibited by Ad-SLPI-EGFRamiR (inhibition rate: ~70%). The apoptosis rate of Hep-2 cells at 72 h after infection with Ad-SLPI-EGFRamiR at a MOI 35 pfu/cell was 32.8%. The adenovirus constructed was able to specifically inhibit the growth of SCC cells in vitro.
