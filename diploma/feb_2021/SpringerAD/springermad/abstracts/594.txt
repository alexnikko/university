Syncope is a common condition that affects individuals of all ages and is responsible for 1–3% of all emergency department (ED) visits. Prospective studies on syncope are often limited by the exiguous number of subjects enrolled. A possible alternative approach would be to use of hospital discharge diagnoses from administrative databases to identify syncope subjects in epidemiological observational studies. We assessed the accuracy of the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) code 780.2 “syncope and collapse” to identify patients with syncope.
