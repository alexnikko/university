Metformin associated lactic acidosis (MALA) is a rare but lethal complication. There is no consensus regarding when to stop and resume metformin in patients who undergo coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). This study aimed to determine if uninterrupted metformin administration in patients with diabetes undergoing CABG increases the risk of lactic acidosis.
