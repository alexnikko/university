Inflammaging is a condition of chronic low-grade inflammation due to the aging process and is associated with a variety of chronic diseases. Monocytes are innate immune cells which contribute to inflammation and are dysregulated during aging, demonstrated reduced phagocytosis, increased inflammation, and alterations in subset proportions. Metabolism is known to determine immune cell function, with quiescent and anti-inflammatory cells primarily relying on fatty acid oxidation, while activated and inflammatory cells primarily rely on glycolysis. We have previously shown an age-related decrease in mitochondrial respiratory capacity in monocytes, so we hypothesized here that a compensatory shift toward glycolysis would occur which would also exacerbate inflammation.
