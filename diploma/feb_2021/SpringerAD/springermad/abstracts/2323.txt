PP2A is a major regulator of tau phosphorylation, which is principally regulated by an endogenous nuclear protein inhibitor 2 of PP2A (I2PP2A), also named SET. However, how SET is post-translationally regulated and translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm remain incompletely understood. Here we show SET is SUMOylated at K68 residue that induces its cytoplasmic retention, resulting in Alzheimer disease (AD) like tau pathology and cognitive defects. SET is predominantly SUMOylated at K68 that leads to its translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and subsequently induces inhibition of PP2A and hyperphosphorylation of tau in HEK-293 cells. Moreover, overexpression of wild type SET significantly inhibits PP2A activity, leading to tau hyperphosphorylation, less synapse loss and cognitive deficits. Conversely, blocking SET SUMOylation via mutating Lys 68 to Arg rescues tau pathology and cognitive impairments in C57/BL6 mice infected with adeno-associated virus encoding SET. Further, Î²-amyloid exposure of rat primary hippocampal neurons induces a dose-dependent SUMOylation of SET. Our findings suggest that SET SUMOylation stimulates its cytoplasmic retention and inhibits PP2A activity, consequently leading to tau hyperphosphorylation and cognitive impairments, which provides a new insight into the AD-like tau pathology.
