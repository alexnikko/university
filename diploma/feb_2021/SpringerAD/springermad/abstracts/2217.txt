Although numerous studies have demonstrated the harmful effect of excessive fructose consumption at the systemic level, there is little information on its effects in the central nervous system. The purpose of the present work was to study the cellular alterations related to oxidative stress and protein quality control systems induced by a high-fructose diet in the brain of Syrian hamsters and their possible attenuation by exogenous melatonin. High-fructose intake induced type II diabetes together with oxidative damage, led to alterations of the unfolded protein response by activating the eIF2α branch, and impaired the macroautophagic machinery in the brain, favoring the accumulation of aggregates labeled for selective degradation and neurodegeneration markers such as β-amyloid (1–42), tau-p-S199, and tau-p-S404. Melatonin attenuated the manifestation of type II diabetes and reduced oxidative stress, deactivated eIF2α, and decreased tau-p-S404 levels in the brain of animals fed a high-fructose diet.
