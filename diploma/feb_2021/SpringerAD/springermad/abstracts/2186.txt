Cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) is one of the 225 genes on chromosome 21 (HSA 21) that are triplicated in persons with trisomy 21 (Down syndrome). Although most triplicate HSA21 genes have their orthologous genes on murine chromosome 16, the murine ortholog of hCBS is on murine chromosome 17 and thus is not present in the well-studied Ts65Dn mouse model of trisomy 21. Persons with trisomy 21 (T21) present deficits in neurotransmission and exhibit early brain aging that can partially be explained by monoamine neurotransmitter alterations. We used transgenic mice for the hCBS gene, which overexpress the CBS protein in various brain regions, to study if CBS overexpression induces modifications in the monoamine neurotransmitters in the hypothalamus, thalamus, hippocampus, and striatum from transgenic and control female and male mice aged 3–4 months and 11–12 months. Sex, age, and brain area each influenced neurotransmitter levels. Briefly, the serotonin pathway was modified by CBS overexpression in various brain areas in female mice but not in male mice. The dopamine pathway was modified in brain regions according to sex and age. These results may allow us to better understand the role of the transsulfuration pathway and especially CBS overexpression in the metabolism of biogenic amines and the catecholamine catabolism in persons with trisomy 21.
