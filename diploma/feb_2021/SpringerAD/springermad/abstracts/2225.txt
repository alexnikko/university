Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive malignant primary brain tumor and still lacks effective therapeutic strategies. It has already been shown that old drugs like sulfasalazine (SAS) and valproic acid (VPA) present antitumoral activities in glioma cell lines. SAS has also been associated with a decrease of intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels through a potent inhibition of xc- glutamate/cystine exchanger leading to an antioxidant deprotection. In the same way, VPA was recently identified as a histone deacetylase (HDAT) inhibitor capable of activating tumor suppression genes. As both drugs are widely used in clinical practice and their profile of adverse effects is well known, the aim of our study was to investigate the effects of the combined treatment with SAS and VPA in GBM cell lines. We observed that both drugs were able to reduce cell viability in a dose-dependent manner and the combined treatment potentiated these effects. Combined treatment also increased cell death and inhibited proliferation of GBM cells, while having no effect on human and rat cultured astrocytes. Also, we observed high protein expression of the catalytic subunit of xc- in all the examined GBM cell lines, and treatment with SAS blocked its activity and decreased intracellular GSH levels. Noteworthy, SAS but not VPA was also able to reduce the [14C]-ascorbate uptake. Together, these data indicate that SAS and VPA exhibit a substantial effect on GBM cellâ€™s death related to an intracellular oxidative response imbalance, making this combination of drugs a promising therapeutic strategy.
