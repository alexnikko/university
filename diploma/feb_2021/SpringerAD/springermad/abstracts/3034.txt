Our sincere hope is to establish the predictive factors of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) response and provide patients with greater certainty regarding treatment outcomes. The aim of this study was to assess the response to NAC and survival in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) according to their RAS/BRAF mutation status.
