Heart failure patients often manifest white matter hyperintensites on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). White matter hyperintnsities have also been linked with cognitive problems in patients with heart failure. Sleep disordered breathing may contribute to structural brain changes in heart failure. The purpose of this study was to test the extent to which the apnea hypopnea index is associated with global and regional white matter hyperintensities, and is a moderating factor in the relationship between age and white matter hyperintensites. A total of 28 HF patients [mean age (SD) = 67.89 (5.8)] underwent T1-weighted and T2FLAIR MRI and a home sleep monitoring study. The apnea hypopnea index cut off of 10 was used to compare between higher and lower risks of sleep disordered breathing. Regression analysis was used to test the association between apnea hypopnea index and both global and regional white matter hyperintensities. The interaction term was entered to identify the moderation effect. Apnea hypopnea index was associated with higher regional white matter hyperintensities but not global white matter hyperintensities. There was a significant interaction between the apnea hypopnea index and age, such that older participants with the apnea hypopnea index ≥10 showed greater regional white matter hyperintensities than those with the apnea hypopnea index <10. The results of this preliminary study indicate that a higher apnea hypopnea index is associated with more white matter hyperintensities. The age-related white matter hyperintensities appear to be exacerbated by apnea hypopnea index in our individuals with heart failure. Future studies are needed to further investigate the underlying mechanisms.
