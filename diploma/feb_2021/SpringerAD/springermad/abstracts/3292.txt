Proanthocyanidins (PAs) have several bioactivities, but they are unstable in the digestive tract and possess low bioavailability. Nanoencapsulation stabilizes these compounds for oral administration. The intestinal absorption of grape seed and skin extracts, and the poly-lactic acid (PLA) nanoparticles loaded with such extracts was modeled, taking into consideration physicochemical process parameters, evaluating the PAs concentration profile in the human small intestine. Density (ρ), solubility, viscosity (μ), diffusion coefficient (D), and the global mass transfer coefficient (K) for both substrates were estimated, simulating their passing from the intestine into the blood at 37°C. For the seed and skin extracts encapsulated in PLA the physicochemical parameters were: D = 1.81 × 10^−5 and D = 5.72 × 10^−5 cm2/s; K = 3.4 × 10^−3 and K = 2.47 × 10^−4 cm/s, respectively. Lower resistance was offered by the seed extract than by skin extracts (nanoencapsulated), which was explained by differences in structural composition, and average molecular weight of the two kinds of extracts, which should be more favorable to the mass transfer in comparison to the raw extracts. The concentration profile of grape extracts in the small intestine was modeled through a pure convection model, and the encapsulated extract on PLA nanoparticles using a mixed regime model, which described the process of dissolution and absorption of the grape extracts from the intestine to the blood stream. The absorbed fraction predicted by the model was 42.7 and 24.2% for seed and skin extracts, respectively. Those values increased to 100% for both extracts after the simulation with the nanoencapsulated extracts. Consequently, extract encapsulation should produce a significant increase in intestinal absorption.
