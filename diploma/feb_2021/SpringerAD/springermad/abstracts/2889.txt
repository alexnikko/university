The first mouse mutation associated with a heritable defect in embryonic mammary gland development was Extratoes. It represents a functional null-mutation of the gene encoding Gli3, which is best known as a transcription factor mediating canonical Hedgehog (Hh) signaling. Here we review the roles of Hh and Gli proteins in murine embryonic mammary development. We propose that an off-state for Hh signaling, mediated by Gli3-repressor, is determinant for induction of a mammary instead of hair follicle fate in the trunk surface ectoderm.
