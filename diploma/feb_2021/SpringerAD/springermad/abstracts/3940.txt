Pharmacodynamic modeling of pulsatile endogenous compounds (e.g. growth hormone [GH]) is currently limited to the identification of a low number of pulses. Commonly used pharmacodynamic models are not able to capture the complexity of pulsatile secretion and therefore non-compartmental analyses are performed to extract summary statistics (mean, AUC, Cmax). The aim of this study was to develop a new quantification method that deals with highly variable pulsatile data by using a deconvolution-analysis-informed population pharmacodynamic modeling approach. Pulse frequency and pulse times were obtained by deconvolution analysis of 24 h GH profiles. The estimated pulse times then informed a non-linear mixed effects population pharmacodynamic model in NONMEM V7.3. The population parameter estimates were used to perform simulations that show agonistic and antagonistic drug effects on the secretion of GH. Additionally, a clinical trial simulation shows the application of this method in the quantification of a hypothetical drug effect that inhibits GH secretion. The GH profiles were modeled using a turnover compartment in which the baseline secretion, kout, pulse secretion width, amount at time point 0 and pulse amplitude were estimated as population parameters. Population parameters were estimated with low relative standard errors (ranging from 2 to 5%). Total body water (%) was identified as a covariate for pulse amplitude, baseline secretion and the pulse secretion width following a power relationship. Simulations visualized multiple gradients of a hypothetical drug that influenced the endogenous secretion of GH. The established model was able to fit and quantify the highly variable individual 24 h GH profiles over time. This pharmacodynamic model can be used to quantify drug effects that target other endogenous pulsatile compounds.
