To report the clinical presentation and outcomes of a series of patients who presented with abdominal/pelvic mass or pelvic pain and were diagnosed with a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). Retrospective data were collected of all patients who presented with an abdominal/pelvic mass or pelvic pain between January 2010 and July 2015 and who were ultimately diagnosed with a GIST. The patients' medical records were reviewed. A literature review was also conducted. The event free survival and overall survival was calculated for all patients using Kaplan Meier curve (SPSS19-SPSS Inc. USA). A total ten patients were identified with GIST during the study period. Eight of ten patients had a tumor in the small intestine, one in sigmoid colon and one in base of small bowel mesentry. The mean tumor size was 13.9 cm (range, 3.9 to 24 cm). A complete resection was achieved in all 10 patients. No patient had distance metastasis. There were no intraoperative complications. One patient developed postoperative intestinal fistula and was managed conservatively. All patients were treated with imatinib after surgery. The mean follow-up time was 18 months (range, 2 to 47 months). The seven of the 10 patients (70 %) with no evidence of disease, two (20 %) lost follow up and one patient developed recurrence during follow up period and was started on sunitinib and patient died during follow up period because of disease. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with an abdominal/pelvic mass or pelvic pain in Gynaecologic oncology department. In such unusual circumstances the complete resection and appropriate adjuvant treatment results in complete durable remission.
