A new myxosporean parasite, Myxodavisia jejuensis n. sp. (Myxozoa; Bivalvulida) is described from the urinary bladder of olive flounder Paralichthys olivaceus cultured on Jeju Island, Korea. Two long lateral appendages with whip-like extensions were attached to mature spores of triangular to semi-circular shape. The spores were measured at 13.1 ± 1.1 μm in length, 17.2 ± 1.0 μm in thickness, and 13.1 ± 1.0 μm in width. Two spherical polar capsules, with a diameter of 5.0 ± 0.4 μm, were observed on opposite sides in the middle of the spore. The suture line was straight or slightly sinuous on the middle of spores. The 18S rDNA from M. jejuensis n. sp. was used in BLAST and molecular phylogenetic analysis. The results demonstrated that M. jejuensis n. sp. was closest to Sinuolinea capsularis and that the infection site tropism was correlated with the phylogeny of marine myxosporeans. In addition, we designed specific primers to detect the 18S rDNA gene of M. jejuensis n. sp.; the results showed specific amplification in M. jejuensis n. sp. among the myxosporeans isolated from the urinary bladder of the cultured olive flounder.
