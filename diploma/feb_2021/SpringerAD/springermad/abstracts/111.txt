Adaptive servo-ventilation (ASV) therapy has been reported to be effective for improving central sleep apnea (CSA) and chronic heart failure (CHF). The purpose of this study was to clarify whether ASV is effective for CSA, cardiac sympathetic nerve activity (CSNA), cardiac symptoms/function, and exercise capacity in CHF patients with CSA and Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR-CSA).
