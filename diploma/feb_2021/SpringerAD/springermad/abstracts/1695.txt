The aim of the present study was to characterize and analyze the most important individual and organizational variables associated with job accommodation in subjects with degenerative cerebellar ataxia by administering a series of international and validated work activity-related scales. Twenty-four workers (W) and 58 non-workers (NW) were recruited: 34 with autosomal dominant ataxia and 48 with autosomal recessive ataxia (27 with Friedreich ataxia and 21 with sporadic adult-onset ataxia of unknown etiology). The severity of ataxia was rated using the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia. Our results showed that the ataxic W were predominantly middle-aged (41–50 years), high school graduate, and married men with a permanent work contract, who had been working for more than 7 years. The W with ataxia exhibited a good level of residual working capacity, irrespective of gender, age range, and duration of the disease, and they were observed to have a low or average-to-low job stress-related risk. Supporting patients with ataxia to find an appropriate job is an important priority because about 78% of NW search for a job and W and NW have the same potential work abilities (no relevant differences were found in terms of disease characteristics, gender, and work resilience). In this view, introducing NW to work-life may have a potential rehabilitative aspect. Findings of this study highlight that equal job opportunities for subjects affected by cerebellar ataxia are recommended.
