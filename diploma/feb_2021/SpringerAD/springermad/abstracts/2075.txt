Circulating levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine C-C motif chemokine 11 (CCL11, also known as eotaxin-1) are increased in several animal models of neuroinflammation, including traumatic brain injury and Alzheimer’s disease. Increased levels of CCL11 have also been linked to decreased neurogenesis in mice. We hypothesized that circulating CCL11 levels would increase following ischemic stroke in mice and humans, and that higher CCL11 levels would correlate with poor long-term recovery in patients. As predicted, circulating levels of CCL11 in both young and aged mice increased significantly 24 h after experimental stroke. However, ischemic stroke patients showed decreased CCL11 levels compared to controls 24 h after stroke. Interestingly, lower post-stroke CCL11 levels were predictive of increased stroke severity and independently predictive of poorer functional outcomes in patients 12 months after ischemic stroke. These results illustrate important differences in the peripheral inflammatory response to ischemic stroke between mice and human patients. In addition, it suggests CCL11 as a candidate biomarker for the prediction of acute and long-term functional outcomes in ischemic stroke patients.
