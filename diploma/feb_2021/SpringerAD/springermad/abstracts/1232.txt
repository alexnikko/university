CD4+ T regulatory cells (Tregs) play a pivotal role in the anti-inflammatory immune response following trauma. The mechanisms of CD4+ Treg activation are mostly unknown. Here, we hypothesize that platelets regulate CD4+ Treg activation following trauma. In a murine burn injury model (male C57Bl/6N mice), depletion of platelets or CD4+ Tregs was conducted. Draining lymph nodes, blood and spleen were harvested 2 h and 7 days after trauma. CD4+ Treg activation was measured using phospho- and conventional flow cytometry. Platelet activation was analyzed using thromboelastometry and flow cytometry. Trauma differentially activates CD4+ T cells, early after trauma only CD4+ Tregs are activated. Following burn injury, platelets augment the activation of CD4+ Tregs. This effect could only be seen early after trauma. While CD4+ Tregs influence hemostasis early following trauma, platelet activation markers were unchanged. Beyond their role in hemostasis, platelets are able to modulate the immunologic host response to trauma-induced injury by augmenting the activation of CD4+ Tregs. CD4+ Treg activation following trauma is considered protective. In addition, CD4+ Tregs are capable of modulating the hemostatic function of platelets. For the first time, we could show reciprocal activation of platelets and CD4+ Tregs as part of the protective immune response following trauma.
