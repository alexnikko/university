The aim of this study was to develop and validate an innovative protocol for the diagnosis of Echinococcus granulosus and other Taeniidae in dogs. For this purpose, three experiments were performed, using faecal samples from naturally infected dogs. Firstly, the FLOTAC technique was calibrated with five flotation solutions: saturated sodium chloride (specific gravity, s.g. = 1.20), zinc sulphate (s.g. = 1.35), zinc chloride (s.g. = 1.45), Breza (s.g. = 1.30) and modified Breza (s.g. = 1.40). Then, FLOTAC was compared with four techniques of flotation in centrifuge using: zinc sulphate (s.g. = 1.20), Breza (s.g. = 1.30), modified Breza (s.g. = 1.40), and zinc chloride (s.g. = 1.45). Finally, four different protocols of DNA extraction were compared for Taeniidae identification: QIAamp Tissue Kit and QIAamp Stool from eggs; QIAamp Stool and Wizard Magnetic Purification System for Food from faeces. FLOTAC with zinc sulphate was the most efficient method to detect Taeniidae eggs, showing highest mean of eggs per gram (EPG) of faeces. The QIAamp Stool, using eggs concentrated by FLOTAC, was the best method for DNA extraction. The combination of these protocols provided the highest number of positive samples with PCR, i.e., 47/50 (94.0%). The three negative samples showed a low faecal egg count (2 EPG) below the detection limit (4 EPG) of the protocol. From sequencing of the 47 positive samples: 6 samples were identified as E. granulosus sensu stricto (s.s.), 28 as Taenia hydatigena and 6 as T. pisiformis. A co-infection between different genera of Taeniidae was found in 7 samples.
