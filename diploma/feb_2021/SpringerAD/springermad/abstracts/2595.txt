The aim of this study was to assess the effects of feeding aflatoxins on some reproductive hormones and on the composition of buffalo milk. Forty lactating buffaloes fed total mixed rations (TMR), part of which was contaminated by fungi secreting aflatoxin. The animals were divided into two equal groups: aflatoxin high group (AHG), animals were fed TMR containing aflatoxin > 21.2 ppb, and aflatoxin low one (ACG), buffaloes were fed on TMR containing aflatoxin < 5 ppb. Blood concentrations of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), progesterone, estradiol 17ß, cortisol, and prolactin were assayed. The physiochemical indices of milk samples including fat%, solid not fat (SNF%), Slats%, protein%, total solids%, and pH were measured. The aflatoxins detected in dietary ration and milk of the buffaloes were aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) respectively. The mean concentration of AFM1 in raw buffalo milk was (0.42 ± 0.043 ppb) in AHG, while there was (0.04 ± 0.002 ppb) in the ACG; the difference was significant (P < 0.05). Animals in AG, revealed a highly significant (P < 0.001) decrease in FSH, LH, and progesterone concentration compared with control animals. In contrast, estradiol 17 ß and cortisol increased significantly (P < 0.01) in AHG compared with ACG. Prolactin concentration showed a slight elevation with a non-significant difference. There were no significant differences in the milk parameters between the two groups. Aflatoxins disturb some endocrine functions of the reproductive organs, which could adversely affect buffalo’s productivity.
