Although anti-disialoganglioside (GD2) antibodies are successfully used for neuroblastoma therapy, a third of patients with neuroblastoma experience treatment failure or serious toxicity. Various strategies have been employed in the clinic to improve antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), such as the addition of interleukin (IL)-2 to enhance natural killer (NK) cell function, adoptive transfer of allogeneic NK cells to exploit immune surveillance, and retinoid-induced differentiation therapy. Nevertheless, these mechanisms are not fully understood. We developed a quantitative assay to test ADCC induced by the anti-GD2 antibody Hu14.18K322A in nine neuroblastoma cell lines and dissociated cells from orthotopic patient-derived xenografts (O-PDXs) in culture. IL-2 improved ADCC against neuroblastoma cells, and differentiation with all-trans retinoic acid stabilized GD2 expression on tumor cells and enhanced ADCC as well. Degranulation was highest in licensed NK cells that expressed CD158b (P < 0.001) and harbored a killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) mismatch against the tumor-specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA; P = 0.016). In conclusion, IL-2 is an important component of immunotherapy because it can improve the cytolytic function of NK cells against neuroblastoma cells and could lower the antibody dose required for efficacy, thereby reducing toxicity. The effect of IL-2 may vary among individuals and a biomarker would be useful to predict ADCC following IL-2 activation. Sub-populations of NK cells may have different levels of activity dependent on their licensing status, KIR expression, and HLA–KIR interaction. Better understanding of HLA–KIR interactions and the molecular changes following retinoid-induced differentiation is necessary to delineate their role in ADCC.
