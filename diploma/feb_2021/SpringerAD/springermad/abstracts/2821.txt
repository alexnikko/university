The eleventh annual workshop of the European Network for Breast Development and Cancer, Methods in mammary gland biology and breast cancer, took place on the 16th to 18th of May 2019 in Weggis, Switzerland. The main topics of the meeting were high resolution genomics and proteomics for the study of mammary gland development and cancer, breast cancer signaling, tumor microenvironment, preclinical models of breast cancer, and tissue morphogenesis. Exciting novel findings in, or highly relevant to, mammary gland biology and breast cancer field were presented, with insights into the methods used to obtain them. Among others, the discussed methods included single-cell RNA sequencing, genetic barcoding, lineage tracing, spatial transcriptomics, optogenetics, genetic mouse models and organoids.
