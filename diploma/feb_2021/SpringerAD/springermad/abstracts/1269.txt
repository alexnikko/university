Emerging evidences suggested that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an interesting role in the tumor development and progression in various types of cancer. The aim of this study was to analyse the potential prognostic value for cancer patients . We systematically searched the reports through PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, CNKI, and the Cochrane Library from inception to March, 2016, and carefully identified according to eligibility criteria. This quantitative meta-analysis collected all relevant articles to investigated the association of SPRY4-IT1 expression status with overall survival (OS) and lymph node metastasis (LNM). A total of 765 patients with cancer from 8 studies were included in the final analysis. The hazard ratio (HR) of OS and the odds ratios (OR) of LNM were calculated to assess the association . The meta-analysis results showed high SPRY4-IT1 expression could predict unfavorable OS in various cancers (pooled HR: 2.18, 95% CI: 1.45–3.27, p = 0.001). Moreover, we found high SPRY4-IT1 expression was related to LNM (pooled OR = 3.86, 95%CI:1.31–11.35, P = 0.01). LncRNA SPRY4-IT1 can serve as a new molecular marker for cancer metastasis and prognosis.
