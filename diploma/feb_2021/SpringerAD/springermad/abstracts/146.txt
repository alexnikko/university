Percutaneous intervention for mitral valve disease has been established as an alternative to open surgical repair in high risk and inoperable candidates. Edge-to-edge leaflet plication with Mitraclip (Abbott, Menlo Park, CA, USA) is indicated for primary and secondary mitral valve diseases. Echocardiography provides a better understanding of mitral valve anatomy and allows us to classify and quantify mitral regurgitation. Transesophageal echocardiography is essential in patient screening, intraprocedural guidance, and post-procedure evaluation for patients undergoing edge-to-edge plication with MitraClip.
