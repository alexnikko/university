Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common primary malignant cancer of brain, which is extremely aggressive and carries a dreadful prognosis. Current treatment protocol runs around radiotherapy, surgical resection, and temozolomide with median overall survival of around 12–15 months. Due to its heterogeneity and mutational load, immunotherapy with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy can be a promising treatment option for recurrent glioblastoma. Initial phase 1 studies have shown that this therapy is safe without dose-limiting side effects and it also has a better clinical outcome. Therefore, CAR T cell therapy can be a great future tool in our armamentarium to treat advanced GBM. In this article, we have explained the structure, mechanism of action, and rationale of CAR T cell therapy in GBM; we also discussed various antigenic targets and clinical outcome of initial studies of this novel therapy.
