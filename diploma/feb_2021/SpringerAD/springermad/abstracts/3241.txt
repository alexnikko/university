The current study is concerned with the development and characterization of mixed micelles intended for the dermal delivery of beclomethasone dipropionate, which is a topical corticosteroid used in the management of atopic dermatitis. Mixed micelles were prepared using thin-film hydration technique, employing different concentrations of pluronic L121 with either poloxamer P84 or pluronic F127 with different surfactant mixture-to-drug ratios. The prepared formulae were characterized concerning entrapment efficiency, particle size, and zeta potential. Two formulae were chosen for ex vivo skin deposition studies: one formulated using pluronic L121/poloxamer P84 mixture while the other using pluronic L121/pluronic F127 mixture. The optimum formula with the highest dermal deposition was subjected to morphological examination and was formulated as hydroxypropyl methylcellulose hydrogel. The hydrogel was evaluated regarding viscosity and was subjected to ex vivo deposition study in comparison with the commercially available cream Beclozone®. In vivo histopathological study was conducted for both the hydrogel and Beclozone® in order to evaluate their healing efficiency. In vivo histopathological study results showed that the prepared hydrogel successfully treated sub-chronic dermatitis in an animal model within a shorter period of time compared to Beclozone®, resulting in better patient compliance and fewer side effects.
