To evaluate whether response based on contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) change at diffusion-weighted MRI after transarterial radioembolization (TARE) can predict survival, in patients with prior transarterial chemoembolization with drug-eluting beads (DEB-TACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
