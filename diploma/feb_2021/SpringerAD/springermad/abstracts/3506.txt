Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models provide a rational mechanistic approach for predicting the time course of macromolecules in plasma. Population PBPK models for large molecules necessitate incorporation of lymphatic circulation to mechanistically account for biodistribution. Moreover, characterization of subcutaneous absorption requires consideration of the microvascular transit from the injection site to the systemic circulation. A PBPK model for a pegylated peptide conjugate, previously developed for primates, was modified to describe the lymphatic uptake in a population of humans by incorporation of interindividual variability in the lymphatic circulation and a unique lymphatic drainage compartment (LDC). The model was then used to simulate the time course of the drug in a population of humans and compared to the same drug administered to a group of human subjects participating in a first-in-human study.
