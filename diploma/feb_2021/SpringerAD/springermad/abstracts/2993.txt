In Japan, positron emission tomography using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) has been covered by the national health insurance for esophageal cancer since 2006. FDG-PET is commonly performed in advanced esophageal cancer. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of FDG-PET on survival in patients with locally advanced inoperable esophageal cancer.
