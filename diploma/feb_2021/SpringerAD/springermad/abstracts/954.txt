The most common cause of ocular morbidity in developed countries is dry eye, many cases of which are due to lacrimal insufficiency. Dry eye affects approximately 10 million in the United States., most of whom are women. In the U.S. alone, an estimated 2 million Sj√∂gren's syndrome patients have dysfunctional lacrimal glands and severe dry eye, and there is no satisfactory treatment. These patients would benefit if their lacrimal tissue function could be restored.
