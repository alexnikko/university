Activation of mitochondrial large-conductance Ca2+-sensitive potassium (mBKCa)-channels is a crucial step for cardioprotection by preconditioning. Whether activation of these channels is involved in levosimendan-induced preconditioning is unknown. We investigated if cardioprotection by levosimendan requires activation of mBKCa-channels in the rat heart in vitro.
