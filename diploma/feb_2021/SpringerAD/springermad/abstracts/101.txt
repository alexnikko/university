Assessment of the area at risk (AAR) associated with an acute myocardial infarction is crucial for evaluating prevention and revascularization strategies. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) provides a more widely available assessment of anatomical AAR than the established anatomical angiographic methods.
