After childbirth, women may develop symptoms of depression with the associated sleep disturbances. This study assessed the relationship between insomnia and both depression symptoms and blood estradiol levels in women during the early postpartum period. 84 patients were assessed 24–48 h after labor. The main assessment methods were the following psychometric scales: Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS). Serum estradiol levels were measured using ELISA assay. Women who developed postpartum insomnia significantly more often reported insomnia during pregnancy (P = 0.001), were more likely to have suffered from depression in the past (P = 0.007) and had significantly higher BDI (P = 0.002) and EPDS (P = 0.048) scores. Our study demonstrated no significant association between Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) during pregnancy and postpartum insomnia. The groups of women with and without postpartum RLS showed no significant differences in the incidence of postpartum insomnia. No significant differences in estradiol levels were observed in women with and without postpartum insomnia. The study showed the following factors to play a major role in development of postpartum insomnia: an increase in Beck Depression Inventory score, a history of depression and a history of insomnia during pregnancy.
