Heart disease has been the leading cause of death in the United States since 1918. Cardiac mortality rates have dramatically decreased in this era of advanced medical and interventional therapies. However, this has been aptly described as “mopping up the floor instead of turning off the faucet.” With this recognition, prevention in cardiology is poised to become a central focus. Within prevention, dietary intervention is recognized as the single largest opportunity for improved cardiovascular outcomes, including improvement or elimination of cardiac risk factors, prevention of myocardial infarction, stroke and cardiovascular death, and reduction of plaque burden and myocardial ischemia. Cardiac imaging, particularly nuclear perfusion and coronary computed tomographic angiography, plays a critical role in early diagnosis and serial evaluation of myocardial ischemia and coronary artery disease. These techniques have the potential to help refine research protocols and evaluate their success by providing intermediate markers of improved myocardial blood flow and coronary plaque morphology.
