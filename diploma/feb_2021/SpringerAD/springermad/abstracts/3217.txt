The FDA withdrew the draft guidance document for industry “Powder Blends and Finished Dosage Units—Stratified In-Process Dosage Unit Sampling and Assessment.” An FDA’s primary concern was a lack of confidence that the results from USP <905> Uniformity of Dosage Units testing ensure the content uniformity of a batch. ISPE sponsored the Blend Uniformity and Content Uniformity Group (referred to as Group), which was formed in August 2013 to discuss approaches to assess blend and content uniformity. Modifications to the withdrawn draft stratified sampling guidance document are proposed by the Group for the assessment of adequacy of powder mix and content uniformity of the finished product in “Recommendations for the Assessment of Blend and Content Uniformity: Modifications to Withdrawn FDA Draft Stratified Sampling Guidance,” accepted by J Pharm Innov, 2014. Specific statistical methodologies to construct acceptance criteria were not recommended in the paper. This paper provides an example and technical discussion of a statistical approach that can be inserted into the framework described in the Group’s paper. There may be other approaches to sampling plans, statistical analysis, and acceptance criteria that are acceptable to demonstrate content uniformity.
