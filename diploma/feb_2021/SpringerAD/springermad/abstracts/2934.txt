The expression of the NKX2–1 gene and its encoded protein, thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1), plays a role in pulmonary surfactant homeostasis and lung development. NKX2–1 mutations have been associated with neonatal respiratory distress, hypotonia, choreoathetosis and congenital hypothyroidism. These clinical findings have been coined brain–lung–thyroid syndrome, although not all three organs are always involved. While many of these children develop interstitial lung disease, no systematic review of chest high-resolution CT (HRCT) findings has been reported.
