The purpose of this nationwide cohort study was to investigate the incidence and risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with acetaminophen (APAP) poisoning. We identified the patients with APAP poisoning and randomly selected comparison patients according to a 1:4 ratio, matching them by age, sex, and the index year using data from the National Health Insurance Research Database from 2000 to 2010. We traced both cohorts until a diagnosis of CAD, loss to follow-up, or the end of 2011. In total, 2723 patients with APAP poisoning and 10,892 comparison patients have followed. The incidence rate of CAD was higher in the APAP poisoning cohort than in the non-APAP poisoning cohort (1.53 vs 0.87 per 1000 patient-years). The APAP poisoning cohort exhibited a 1.85-fold higher risk of CAD than did the non-APAP poisoning cohort (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.85; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.16–2.94). Male sex, advanced age, and hypertension were independently associated with CAD risk. The risk of CAD was considerably higher within 3 years following APAP poisoning (aHR 2.73; 95% CI 1.31–5.69). This study indicated that APAP poisoning may increase risk of CAD development.
