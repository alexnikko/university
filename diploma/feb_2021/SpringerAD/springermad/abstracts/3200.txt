Pharmaceutical gelatin shell capsules are commonly used to deliver powdered solid dosage forms. The dissolution behavior of these products depends on a number of factors, including, notably, powder distribution within capsules. Powder agglomeration occurring during the filling and sealing stages may lead to regulatory compliance issues. Although not a typical procedure, X-ray images of the final capsules may be inspected manually to determine the presence of such agglomerates.
