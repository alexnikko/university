The objective of this work was to develop, validate, and implement a modeling methodology for predicting the shape and relative density fields in the vicinity of debossed features on a tablet surface. The resulting model was used to investigate the influence of debossed feature stroke angle and degree of pre-pick, which is expressed as a percentage of the stroke depth, as well as the influence of formulation lubricant on the aforementioned debossed feature parameters.
