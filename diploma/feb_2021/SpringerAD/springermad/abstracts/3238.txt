A tablet film coating and drying process was assessed by an experimentally validated thermodynamic balance model. Mass conservation equations were derived for the process air and the aqueous coating solution. Thermodynamic behavior of the solution was described by evaporation at the tablet surface and penetration into the tablet. Energy balance equations including heat loss to the atmosphere were coupled to the mass conservation equation. Experimental data using the ConsiGmaâ„¢ coater (GEA, Belgium) were used for both parameter estimation and model validation. The results showed the proposed model can investigate primitive outlet variables and further internal variables representing evaporation and penetration. A sensitivity analysis revealed that evaporation depended more on the input parameters while penetration hinges on the tablet properties, particularly on the tablet volume affecting the tablet porosity.
