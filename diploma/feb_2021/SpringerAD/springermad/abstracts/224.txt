Platelet receptor GPVI plays an important role in platelet firm adhesion to site of vascular injury. Receptor ligation with collagen, in company with other agonist/receptor interactions, augments inside out signaling pathways leading to platelet aggregation and thrombus formation. As GPVI expression is significantly modulated by ectodomain shedding, this study aimed to examine whether GPVI shedding functionally affects collagen-mediated platelet activation during storage. 6 PRP-platelet concentrates were subjected to adhesion analysis on collagen matrix under mild stirring condition as well as collagen-induced aggregation on day 1, 3 and 5 post-storage. Concurrently, platelet supernatants of same samples were fractionated by ultra-centrifugation and obtained micro-particle-free samples were subjected to western blot analysis for the evaluation of GPVI shedding. We showed a direct correlation between collagen-dependent platelet aggregation and adhesion (r = 0.8, p = 0.0001). The increasing levels of GPVI shedding during storage were in reverse correlation with collagen-induced platelet aggregation (r = − 0.82, p = 0.0004) which was significantly reducing during storage. Platelet adhesion to collagen matrix significantly decreased post-storage while it was also reversely correlated with the levels of GPVI shedding during 5 days storage of platelets (r = − 0.69, p = 0.002). Data presented here demonstrated that progressive shedding of surface adhesion receptor GPVI can affect its functional activities in stored platelets. Thereby considering the crucial role of GPVI in platelet adhesion to the site of injury, whether the therapeutic efficacy of banked platelet products could be influenced by storage-dependent shedding of this receptor, remains to be answered in future studies.
