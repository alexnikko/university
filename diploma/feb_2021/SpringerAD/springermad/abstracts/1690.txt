Neurosteroids are synthesized in the nervous system from cholesterol or steroidal precursors imported from peripheral sources. These compounds are important allosteric modulators of γ-aminobutyric acid A receptors (GABAARs), which play a vital role in pain modulation in the lateral thalamus, a main gate where somatosensory information enters the cerebral cortex. Using high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry, we found increased levels of neurosteroids (pregnenolone, progesterone, deoxycorticosterone, allopregnanolone, and tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone) in the chronic stage of neuropathic pain (28 days after spared nerve injury) in rats. The expression of the translocator protein TSPO, the upstream steroidogenesis rate-limiting enzyme, increased at the same time. In vivo stereotaxic microinjection of neurosteroids or the TSPO activator AC-5216 into the lateral thalamus (AP −3.0 mm, ML ±3.0 mm, DV 6.0 mm) alleviated the mechanical allodynia in neuropathic pain, while the TSPO inhibitor PK 11195 exacerbated it. The analgesic effects of AC-5216 and neurosteroids were significantly attenuated by the GABAAR antagonist bicuculline. These results suggested that elevated neurosteroids in the lateral thalamus play a protective role in the chronic stage of neuropathic pain.
