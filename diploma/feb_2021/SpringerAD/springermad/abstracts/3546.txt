In rural area, control of breast cancer is related to health promotion and early diagnosis, which includes knowledge, awareness, and stimulating behavioral change, emphasizing screening for disease. The present study was developed to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice of rural women about early detection of breast cancer in the Primary Health Care Centre. This is a cross-sectional study in a Primary Health Care Centre with 243 rural women participating in the public health service. Data collection was made by a self-administered questionnaire which included sociodemographic characteristics, questions on breast cancer risk factors, screening, and diagnostic methods. Marks were attributed to each question and calculated for each section. Participants fell in three categories of knowledge, attitude, and practice: appropriate, regular and inappropriate. Knowledge, attitude, and practice of early detection methods were considered especially appropriate for those rural women with education and higher economic level, but inadequate responses to such methods were still significant. It is noted that there is still a significant number of rural women who do not have basic knowledge regarding early detection methods of breast cancer, contributing to the non-realization of these methods, as its advocates.
