Cancer has become the number one killer. The most difficult part of cancer treatment is the treatment of metastasis, particularly the peritoneal metastasis, generally referred to as peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC). Internationally, the integrated treatment strategy of cytoreductive surgery (CRS) plus hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) has been developed to be the standard treatment for PC. Although the development in this field has been relatively slow, as a result of the hard work put in over the last 20 years, there has been outstanding progress and gratifying achievements in both the diagnosis and treatment of PC in China. Our center (Department of Peritoneal Cancer Surgery, Beijing Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University) focuses on the research in diagnostic methods for PC, CRS+HIPEC, and management of perioperative adverse events. Based on these, “Chinese expert consensus on cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy for peritoneal malignancies” is developed. Our center that is the pioneering center for this treatment in China has accumulated a wealth of experiences and achievements with more than 1000 cases of CRS+HIPEC. Additionally, our center establishes a nationwide professional training program to promote and standardize the practice of CRS+HIPEC gradually.
