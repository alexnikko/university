Data discussed in recent reviews demonstrated that dysregulation of microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles occurs during cervical carcinogenesis and characteristic up- or downregulation of certain miRNAs might be used as biomarkers. The majority of altered miRNAs, however were found to be inconsistent upon comparison with cancerous and normal cervical epithelia in the discussed studies due to several reasons. The results obtained in this present review suggest the need for further investigations on miRNAs on larger sample sizes in order to indicate sensitivity and specificity by means of well defined, “unified” methods. In addition, obtaining further data on the clinical course and outcome of patients in comparison to the dysregulation of miRNA expression profile could turn miRNAs into prognostic and/or progression markers. Inhibition of overexpressed miRNAs, as suggested by some authors, might even serve as target for cancer therapy.
