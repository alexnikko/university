The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between the presence of albuminuria and cytokines profile with biomarkers of endothelial damage and oxidative stress in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1). The sample was composed by 35 healthy individuals, 63 DM1 patients with normoalbuminuria (<30 mg of albumin/g of creatinine) and 62 DM1 patients with micro- and macroalbuminuria (≥30 mg of albumin/g of creatinine). Plasma and urinary cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-10) and thrombomodulin levels were determined by ELISA. Oxidative status was evaluated using the TBARS and MTT assays. Diabetic patients were characterized by elevated levels of urinary cytokines TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-10. Those with macroalbuminuria presented significantly higher TNF-α and IL-10 urinary levels when compared to other groups. Urinary and plasmatic levels of TNF-α were positively correlated with plasma levels of cystatin C, creatinine, urea and albuminuria, while they were negatively correlated with estimated glomerular filtration rate. Urinary IL-10 levels proved positive correlation with fasting glucose, HbA1c, thrombomodulin and TBARS, while IL-6 plasma levels were positively correlated with HbA1c and albuminuria. Only urinary TNF-α levels were associated with the presence and severity of macroalbuminuria, after logistic regression analysis. This finding suggests that measurement of urinary TNF-α level may be helpful to evaluate progression to nephropathy in DM1 patients.
