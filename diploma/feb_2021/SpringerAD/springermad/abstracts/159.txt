In this review, we make a comprehensive summary of exercise stress echocardiography in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and practical tips used in our hospital. The main objective of performing exercise stress echocardiography in patients with HCM is to evaluate left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, mitral regurgitation, left ventricular asynergy, and diastolic function during exercise. There are limitations to the explanations that can be provided for exertional symptoms when resting echocardiography is performed in patients with HCM. In contrast, exercise stress echocardiography causes the manifestation of findings that are latent at rest, which possibly provides the elucidation of symptom etiology. In this article, we focus on the usefulness of exercise stress echocardiography in HCM.
