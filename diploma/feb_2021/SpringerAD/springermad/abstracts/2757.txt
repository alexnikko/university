Peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) is a common evolution of abdominal cancers. It may arise from the peritoneum itself (primary) or originate from another type of cancer especially those of gastrointestinal or gynecological origin (secondary). Without aggressive multimodal therapeutic approaches, PC is associated with a poor prognosis. Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) have been used to treat PC since 1990. In Saudi Arabia, the first CRS and HIPEC were done in 2008. In 2018, Saudi Arabia population is 32 millions of people and the demand for such procedures has grown up. This article gives outlines of the current status of peritoneal surface oncology in Saudi Arabia and the future perspective.
