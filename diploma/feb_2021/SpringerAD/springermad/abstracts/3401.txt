Drug-induced cardiotoxicity is a serious problem associated with the administration of many drugs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to be affected by drugs and other xenobiotics, and the potential of miRNAs as biomarkers and diagnostic tools has been considered. In recent years, an association of certain miRNAs with the cardiotoxicity of some drugs, namely anthracyclines, bevacizumab, cyclosporine A and isoprenaline, has already been found. This review article summarizes available information about the changes in miRNA levels induced by cardiotoxic drugs. Three aspects are discussed: the altered expression of miRNAs in the heart upon treatment with cardiotoxic drugs, circulating miRNAs as promising early biomarkers of cardiotoxicity, and the potential of miRNAs in the prevention and/or attenuation of drug-induced cardiotoxicity. The targeted changes in the level of certain miRNAs by antagomiRs and miRNA mimics are also described and evaluated. In addition, the cardioprotective mechanism of various natural compounds via their effect on miRNA levels are examined.
