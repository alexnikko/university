Increased prenatal testosterone exposure has been hypothesized as a mechanism underlying autism spectrum disorders (ASD).

The current study sought to determine whether testosterone concentrations in umbilical cord blood are associated with a clinical diagnosis of ASD in a small number of children and with autistic-like traits in the general population.
