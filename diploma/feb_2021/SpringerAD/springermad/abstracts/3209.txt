In this manuscript, a moving horizon-based real-time optimization (MH-RTO) has been integrated with a hybrid model predictive control (MPC) system for a continuous tablet manufacturing process for quality by design (QbD)-based efficient continuous manufacturing. In the proposed approach, the integrated MH-RTO provides the optimal operational set points for the tablet production rate in real time. The MH-RTO takes into consideration the capital and operating cost, the market fluctuations, the product inventory, the product quality assurance strategy, the regulatory constraints, and the product rejections. An advanced hybrid model predictive control system then ensures that the required production rate with desired quality is met with minimum resources and time. A robust optimization strategy and an efficient control system have been integrated to achieve the maximum profit. The MH-RTO integrated with a hybrid control strategy ensures the maximum possible profit irrespective of the market demand fluctuations. The basic advantage of the MH-RTO framework is that it takes into consideration the future demand and thus can lead to increased profit compared to a standard real-time optimization approach.
