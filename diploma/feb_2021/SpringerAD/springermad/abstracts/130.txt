Myocardial blood flow (MBF) imaging is used in patients with suspected cardiac sarcoidosis, and also in stress/rest studies. The accuracy of MBF is dependent on imaging parameters such as new reconstruction methodologies. In this work, we aim to assess the impact of a novel PET reconstruction algorithm (Bayesian-penalized likelihoodâ€”BPL) on the values determined from the calculation of [13N]-NH3 MBF values.
