Worldwide, breast conservation has become increasingly accepted as the surgical management of breast cancer in clinical practice. Cancer care in India is also evolving tremendously with many cancer treatment centres following evidence-based practice hence the rates of breast conservation are expected to increase. Here, we are reporting the rate of breast-conserving surgery (BCS) at our centre. A retrospective study of 401 patients who underwent breast cancer surgery at a tertiary care centre in South India from January 2015 to August 2017 were analysed to study the rate of BCS. All early breast cancers (EBC) were offered BCS. For large operable breast cancer (LOBC) and locally advanced breast cancer (LABC), neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) followed by BCS was offered to these patients who wish to conserve their breast. The mean age was 45 years. A total of 163 patients underwent BCS. Yearly, BCS rates were 38.8% in 2015, 36.7% in 2016 and 46.5% in 2017. Majority had EBC 310 (77.3%) of which 62.7% of T1 lesions (n = 51) had BCS, and 45.7% of T2 lesions (n = 258) had BCS of which 5 patients had to undergo NACT to preserve their breast whereas 100% Tis patient (n = 1) had mastectomy. Fifty patients had LOBC and only 2 (4%) patients had upfront BCS whereas 9 of them had to undergo NACT (18%). cT4 lesions had NACT followed by BCS in 2 patients. The rates of BCS have been increasing in India over the past few years. The majority of the women presented with EBC which makes them suitable for BCS.
