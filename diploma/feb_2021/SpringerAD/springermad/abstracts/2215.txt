Axons of the corpus callosum (CC), the white matter tract that connects the left and right hemispheres of the brain, receive instruction from a number of chemoattractant and chemorepulsant cues during their initial navigation towards and across the midline. While it has long been known that the CC is malformed in the absence of Myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate (MARCKS), evidence for a direct role of MARCKS in axon navigation has been lacking. Here, we show that MARCKS is necessary for Netrin-1 (NTN1) signaling through the DCC receptor, which is critical for axon guidance decisions. Marcks null (Marcks−/−) neurons fail to respond to exogenous NTN1 and are deficient in markers of DCC activation. Without MARCKS, the subcellular distributions of two critical mediators of NTN1-DCC signaling, the tyrosine kinases PTK2 and SRC, are disrupted. Together, this work establishes a novel role for MARCKS in axon dynamics and highlights the necessity of MARCKS as an organizer of DCC signaling at the membrane.
