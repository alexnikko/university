Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the leading cause of disability worldwide. The serotonin hypothesis may be the model of MDD pathophysiology with the most support. The majority of antidepressants enhance synaptic serotonin levels quickly, while it usually takes weeks to discern MDD treatment effect. It has been hypothesized that the time lag between serotonin increase and reduction of MDD symptoms is due to downregulation of inhibitory receptors such as the serotonin 1B receptor (5-HT1BR). The research on 5-HT1BR has previously been hampered by a lack of selective ligands for the receptor. The last extensive review of 5-HT1BR in the pathophysiology of depression was published 2009, and based mainly on findings from animal studies. Since then, selective radioligands for in vivo quantification of brain 5-HT1BR binding with positron emission tomography has been developed, providing new knowledge on the role of 5-HT1BR in MDD and its treatment. The main focus of this review is the role of 5-HT1BR in relation to MDD and its treatment, although studies of 5-HT1BR in obsessive-compulsive disorder, alcohol dependence, and cocaine dependence are also reviewed. The evidence outlined range from animal models of disease, effects of 5-HT1B receptor agonists and antagonists, case-control studies of 5-HT1B receptor binding postmortem and in vivo, with positron emission tomography, to clinical studies of 5-HT1B receptor effects of established treatments for MDD. Low 5-HT1BR binding in limbic regions has been found in MDD patients. When 5-HT1BR ligands are administered to animals, 5-HT1BR agonists most consistently display antidepressant-like properties, though it is not yet clear how 5-HT1BR is best approached for optimal MDD treatment.
