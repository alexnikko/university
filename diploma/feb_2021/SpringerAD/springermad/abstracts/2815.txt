During 2012â€“13, we diagnosed 4 patients with extensive skeletal tuberculosis (TB) who were referred to us as cases of bony metastasis with unknown primary. Radiological investigations done outside favoured a diagnosis of disseminated malignancy. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan performed in our institute for localization of primary lesion also suggested metastatic disease. There was no evidence of malignancy on histo-pathological examination (HPE) of the involved sites. The diagnosis of TB was established on characteristics HPE. This article highlights the diagnostic dilemma of PET/CT in cases of TB versus malignancy and the importance of HPE for reaching an accurate diagnosis.
