Gastrodin, the major component isolated from the rhizome of the Chinese traditional medicinal herb Gastrodia elata (“Tianma”), has a long history in the treatment of epilepsy and other neurological disorders. However, the molecular mechanisms are not clear. Here, we found that gastrodin ameliorated pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced epileptic seizures with improvement of the electroencephalographic pattern in mice. Further studies demonstrated that gastrodin decreased the levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α while increasing interleukin-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine in the brain. Furthermore, gastrodin attenuated the PTZ-induced microglial activation along with inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinases, cAMP response element binding protein, and NF-κB. Our data suggest that gastrodin attenuates seizures by modulating the mitogen-activated protein kinase-associated inflammatory responses.
