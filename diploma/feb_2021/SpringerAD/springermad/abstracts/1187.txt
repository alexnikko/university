The LEW.1AR1-iddm rat is an animal model of human type 1 diabetes, which arose through a spontaneous mutation in the Dock8 gene within the MHC congenic background strain LEW.1AR1. This mutation not only mediates diabetes development but also leads to a variable T cell frequency in peripheral blood. In this study, the immune cell frequencies of primary and secondary lymphatic organs of LEW.1AR1-iddm rats were analysed at days 40 and 60 and compared to other MHC congenic LEW rat strains. In LEW.1AR1-iddm rats, the secondary lymphatic organs such as lymph nodes and spleen showed a reduced, around 15% in comparison to all other strains, but very variable T cell frequency, mirroring the fluctuating T cell content in blood. On the other hand, the frequency of B cells was increased by 10% in the lymph nodes and by 5% in the spleen. Thus, the decreasing number of T cells in blood could not be caused by an increase of T cells in secondary lymphatic organs. The frequency of single- or double-positive T cells in the thymus was unaffected. The T cell frequencies in the other analysed strains were more stable and mostly higher in all secondary lymphatic organs. Obviously, the Dock8 mutation leads to variabilities of T cell frequencies in blood as well as in secondary lymphatic organs. In conclusion, the Dock8 mutation was responsible for changed immune cell frequencies in different compartments and together with the RT1B/Du haplotype causing immune imbalances and development of autoimmune diabetes.
