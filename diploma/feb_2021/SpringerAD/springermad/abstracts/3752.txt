Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have important cardiovascular and renal benefits in adults with type 2 diabetes who have or are at high risk of cardiovascular and renal disease. These benefits are seen in patients with impaired renal function where the glucose-lowering effects are not observed. Here, we review the pharmacokinetics and pharmacology of SGLT2 inhibitors in relation to cardiovascular and renal outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).
