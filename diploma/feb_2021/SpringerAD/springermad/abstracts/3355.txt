The MEK inhibitor trametinib was approved in 2013 for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600E mutation, the most common pathogenic mutation in melanoma. Trametinib blocks activation of ERK1/2, inhibiting cell proliferation in melanoma. ERK1/2 also protects against multiple types of cardiac insult in mouse models. Trametinib improves survival in melanoma patients, but evidence of unanticipated cardiotoxicity is emerging. Here we describe the case of a patient with metastatic melanoma who developed acute systolic heart failure after trametinib treatment and present the results of the literature review prompted by this case. A patient with no cardiac history presented with a 6.5-mm skin lesion and was found to have metastatic BRAF V600E melanoma. Combination treatment with trametinib and the BRAF inhibitor, dabrafenib, was initiated. The patient’s pre-treatment ejection fraction was 55–60%. His EF declined after 13 days and that was 40% 1 month after treatment. Two months after initiating trametinib, he developed dyspnea and fatigue. We conducted a chart review in the electronic medical record. We conducted a PubMed search using trametinib/adverse effects AND (“heart failure” OR “left ventricular dysfunction” OR hypertension OR cardiotoxicity OR mortality). We also queried the FDA Adverse Events Reporting System for reports of cardiomyopathy, ejection fraction decrease, and left ventricular dysfunction associated with trametinib between January 1, 2013, and July 20, 2017. The literature search retrieved 19 articles, including clinical trials and case reports. Early clinical experience with the MEK inhibitor trametinib suggests that its clinical efficacy may be compromised by cardiotoxicity. Further studies in humans and animals are required to determine the extent of this adverse effect, as well as its underlying mechanisms.
