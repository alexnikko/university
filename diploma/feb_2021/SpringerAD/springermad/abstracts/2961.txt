Assessing tumor response is a large part of everyday clinical work in neuroradiology. However in the setting of tumor treatment, distinguishing tumor progression from treatment-related changes is difficult on conventional MRI sequences. This is made even more challenging in children where mainstay advanced imaging techniques that are often used to decipher progression versus treatment-related changes have technical limitations. In this review, we highlight the challenges in pediatric neuro-oncologic tumor assessment with discussion of pseudophenomenon including pseudoresponse and pseudoprogression. Additionally, we discuss the advanced imaging techniques often employed in neuroradiology to distinguish between pseudophenomenon and true progressive disease.
