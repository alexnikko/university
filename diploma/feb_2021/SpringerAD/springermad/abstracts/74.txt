Heart failure (HF) is associated with cardiac autonomic denervation (AD), which can be non-invasively assessed by 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I-mIBG) scintigraphy and has prognostic implications. We aimed to study the relationship between myocardial contractility assessed by global longitudinal strain (GLS) and AD assessed by 123I-mIBG scintigraphy in advanced HF.
