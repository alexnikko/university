Solid dispersions (SDs) of a poorly water-soluble drug were prepared, and their physicochemical properties were compared to those of control physical mixtures (PMs). Among the multiple techniques used to characterize the solid state of preparations, confocal micro Raman spectroscopy (CMRS) was used as a non-destructive tool to qualitatively probe content uniformity and distribution of drug and carrier.
