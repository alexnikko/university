Although the rate of cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related mortality has declined over the last decade, it is still the leading cause of mortality in the USA, accounting for over 1.4 million deaths annually. In addition, total direct (primarily hospital admissions) and indirect costs of CVD in the US is over $316 billion annually and is expected to grow to over $918 billion by 2030. Much of the etiology of CVD is due to atherosclerosis and its thrombotic complications, and central to this is the role of platelets. Atherosclerosis is a systemic disease, with meaningful morbidity and mortality when present in the coronary, cerebral, or major peripheral arteries. The recommended antiplatelet therapy differs based on the vascular bed impacted, with the optimal antiplatelet therapy yet to be defined. The PARTHENON program is a series of completed and ongoing phase III clinical trials investigating the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor in atherosclerotic CVD in comparison with established antiplatelet therapy or placebo. The overall aim of the program is to determine if more potent antiplatelet therapy, with different pharmacology, may reduce cardiovascular events in patients with atherosclerotic disease.
