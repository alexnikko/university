Epigenetic disorders such as point mutations in cellular tumor suppressor genes, DNA methylation and post-translational modifications are needed to transformation of normal cells into cancer cells. These events result in alterations in critical pathways responsible for maintaining the normal cellular homeostasis, triggering to an inflammatory response which can lead the development of cancer. The inflammatory response is a universal defense mechanism activated in response to an injury tissue, of any nature, that involves both innate and adaptive immune responses, through the collective action of a variety of soluble mediators. Many inflammatory signaling pathways are activated in several types of cancer, linking chronic inflammation to tumorigenesis process. Thus, Inflammatory responses play decisive roles at different stages of tumor development, including initiation, promotion, growth, invasion, and metastasis, affecting also the immune surveillance. Immune cells that infiltrate tumors engage in an extensive and dynamic crosstalk with cancer cells, and some of the molecular events that mediate this dialog have been revealed. A range of inflammation mediators, including cytokines, chemokines, free radicals, prostaglandins, growth and transcription factors, microRNAs, and enzymes as, cyclooxygenase and matrix metalloproteinase, collectively acts to create a favorable microenvironment for the development of tumors. In this review are presented the main mediators of the inflammatory response and discussed the likely mechanisms through which, they interact with each other to create a condition favorable to development of cancer.
