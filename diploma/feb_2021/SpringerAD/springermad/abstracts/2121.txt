Aggregation and aggregation-mediated formation of toxic alpha synuclein (aSyn) species have been linked to the pathogenesis of sporadic and monogenic Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD). A novel H50Q mutation of aSyn, resulting in the substitution of histidine by glutamine, has recently been identified in PD patients. We have previously shown that the lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) induces the formation of HNE-aSyn adducts, thereby promoting aSyn oligomerization and increasing its extracellular toxicity to human dopaminergic neurons. Intriguingly, we identified histidine 50 (H50) of aSyn as one of the HNE modification target residues. These converging lines of evidence support the hypothesis that changes in H50 via posttranslational modification (PTM) and mutation trigger the formation of aggregated, toxic aSyn species, which interfere with cellular homeostasis. In the present study, we aim to elucidate 1) the role of H50 in HNE-mediated aSyn aggregation and toxicity, and 2) the impact of H50 mutation on aSyn pathology. Besides the PD-related H50Q, we analyze a PD-unrelated control mutation, in which H50 is replaced by an arginine residue (H50R).
