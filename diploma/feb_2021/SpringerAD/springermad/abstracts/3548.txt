Efforts to prevent melanoma, especially for those at elevated risk for the disease, should ideally begin during childhood. However, there are few preventive interventions targeting children who are at higher risk for melanoma due to a family history of the disease. Further, there are no educational interventions that aim to help these at-risk children understand their risk for melanoma and the ways in which preventive behaviors, such as sun protection, can mitigate their risk. The current paper describes a multidisciplinary team’s process for creating a developmentally appropriate educational intervention about melanoma risk and prevention for children ages 8–17 years who have a family history of melanoma. Drawing from the fields of dermatology, health behavior change and education, genetic risk communication, science education, and graphic arts, the multimedia intervention created covers key learning points relevant to understanding melanoma, the role of DNA damage in melanoma development, inherited risk factors for melanoma, environmental factors causing DNA damage, and methods for preventing DNA damage, such as sun protective behaviors. Lessons learned during the development of the educational intervention, particularly relevant to multidisciplinary team interactions, are discussed. Implications for future testing and refinement of the novel educational content are also reviewed.
