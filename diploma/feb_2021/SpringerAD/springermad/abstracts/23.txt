Twenty percent of the patients with AAA have an aneurysm involving the common iliac arteries. Large common iliac diameter can be treated with an iliac branched device or extension of the stent graft to the external iliac artery with occlusion of the ipsilateral internal iliac artery (IIA) to prevent type 2 endoleaks. This study describes and evaluates a embolization technique using Onyx in conjunction with EVAR in aneurysms with poor landing zones in the common iliac arteries.
