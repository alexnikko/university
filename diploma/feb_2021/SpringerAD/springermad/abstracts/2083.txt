We previously found that hematoma worsens hydrocephalus after intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) via increasing iron deposition and aggravating ependymal cilia injury; therefore, promoting hematoma absorption may be a promising strategy for IVH. Recently, some investigations imply that simvastatin has the ability of accelerating hematoma absorption. Thus, this study was designed to examine the efficacy of simvastatin for IVH in rats. Intracerebral hemorrhage with ventricular extension was induced in adult male Sprague–Dawley rats after autologous blood injection. Simvastatin or vehicle was administered orally at 1 day after IVH and then daily for 1 week. MRI studies were performed to measure the volumes of intracranial hematoma and lateral ventricle at days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 after IVH. Motor and neurocognitive functions were assessed at days 1 to 7 and 23 to 28, respectively. Iron deposition, iron-related protein expression, ependymal damage, and histology were detected at day 28. Expression of CD36 scavenger receptor (facilitating phagocytosis) was examined at day 3 after IVH using western blotting and immunofluorescence. Simvastatin significantly increased hematoma absorption ratio, reduced ventricular volume, and attenuated neurological dysfunction post-IVH. In addition, less iron accumulation and more cilia survival was observed in the simvastatin group when compared with the control. What’s more, higher expression of CD36 was detected around the hematoma after simvastatin administration. Simvastatin significantly enhanced brain hematoma absorption, alleviated hydrocephalus, and improved neurological recovery after experimental IVH, which may in part by upregulating CD36 expression. Our data suggest that early simvastatin use may be a novel therapy for IVH patients.
