Peri-procedural myocardial infarction (PMI) occurs in a small but significant portion of patients undergoing percutaneous intervention (PCI). The underlying mechanisms are complex and may include neurohormonal activation and release of vasoactive substances resulting in disruption of the coronary microcirculation. Endothelin in particular has been found in abundance in atherosclerotic plaques and in systemic circulation following PCI, and may be a potential culprit for PMI through its action on microvascular vasoconstriction, and platelet and neutrophil activation. In this study we aim to characterize the behavior of the coronary microcirculation during a PCI with the index of microvascular resistance (IMR) and the effect of peri-procedural endothelin antagonism.
