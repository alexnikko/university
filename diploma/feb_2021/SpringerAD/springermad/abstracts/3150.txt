The sterility test described in pharmacopeial compendia requires a 14-day incubation period to obtain a valid analytical result. Therefore, the use of alternative methods to evaluate the sterility of pharmaceuticals, such as the Celsis AKuScreen™ Advance™ system, is particularly interesting because it allows a reduced incubation period and higher efficiency. The present study was aimed to evaluate and compare the performance of Celsis AKuScreen™ Advance™ system with the pharmacopeial sterility test. There was no significant difference between the ability of detection of microbial contamination observed within pharmacopeial method and test method. The Celsis AKuScreen™ Advance™ system allowed a faster detection of the challenge microorganisms, which indicates that the system is a viable alternative for assessing the sterility of injectable products.
