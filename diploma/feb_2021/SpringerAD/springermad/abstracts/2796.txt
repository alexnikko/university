Children with malignancy require venous access that is reliable, safe and compliant on a long-term basis. There is little data available on utilization of totally implantable venous access devices (TIVAD) for long term chemotherapy in children in an Indian setting [1]. We report our long-term follow-up results of utilization of totally implantable venous access devices for long-term chemotherapy in children. This was a retrospective analysis of 122 children requiring long-term chemotherapy done between January 2008 and December 2013. Data collected included primary disease process, type of port, site of insertion, intraoperative events, early and late postoperative complications, and issues with utilization, maintenance and removal. 127 ports were placed in 122 children. The follow up ranged from 16 to 50 months. Internal jugular vein was accessed in 96.8 % of cases (123/127). Majority of children (61 %) had hematological malignancy. Early complications occurred in 5 children. Late complications occurred in 18 children which included port pocket infection in 3, port site skin issues in 5, catheter related issues in 3, venous thrombosis in 2 and catheter related bacteremia in 5 children respectively. Only 10 children have been lost to follow-up either due to death or discontinuation of treatment and rest are on follow up. Totally implantable venous access devices usage is safe and reliable for access needs in children for long-term chemotherapy. Their low complication and low cost maintenance should increase their utilization in children requiring long-term chemotherapy. Chemoport placement in children with hematological malignancy can be carried out safely without much impact on complication rates. Though management and compliance of children with malignancy has improved; critical analysis and standardization of port system care through prospective trials are necessary to reduce the morbidity and for cost analysis in these children.
