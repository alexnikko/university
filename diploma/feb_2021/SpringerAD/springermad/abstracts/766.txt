Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a heterogeneous genetic disease caused by a deficit in C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) and clinically characterized by sudden events of edema, swelling, and pruritus. Here, we describe the first SERPING1 genotyping in 22 subjects from 4 non-related families, all from southern Colombia. The previously reported heterozygous gene mutations, c.1081C>T (p.Gln361*), c.1396C>G (p.Arg466Gly), c.1029+84G>A, or c.106_107del (p.Ser36Phefs*21), were found in 12 patients. Of note, a single patient clinically characterized as severe HAE type 2 expressed mutations in exon 8 and intron 6, whereas all the others have type 1 HAE and expressed one pathogenic variant. One of the subjects, a 5-year-old girl was discovered to have a pathogenic variant, and sheÂ is still asymptomatic. This is the first report focused on HAE genetic analysis in a Colombian population.
