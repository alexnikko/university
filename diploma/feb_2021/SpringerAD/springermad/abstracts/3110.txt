There are few lacunae in the Fédération Internationale de Gynécologie et d’Obstétrique (FIGO) staging system for Carcinoma of cervix, as the patients are not assessed for lymph node as well as distant metastases, though these are important prognostic factors. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as well as Flurodeoxy glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) has been used for evaluation of local tumor extent and nodal as well as distant metastasis in case of cervical cancer.
