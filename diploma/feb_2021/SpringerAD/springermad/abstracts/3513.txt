Gadofosveset is a Gd-based contrast agent used for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Gadolinium kinetic distribution models are implemented in T1-weighted dynamic contrast-enhanced perfusion MRI for characterization of lesion sites in the body. Physiology changes in a disease state potentially can influence the pharmacokinetics of drugs and to this respect modify the distribution properties of contrast agents. This work focuses on the in silico modelling of pharmacokinetic properties of gadofosveset in different population groups through the application of physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models (PBPK) embedded in SimcypÂ® population pharmacokinetics platform.
