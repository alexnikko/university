The larval stage of the species complex Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato (s.l.) is the cause of a widespread zoonotic disease known as cystic echinococcosis (CE). The disease is highly prevalent in southern Italy and represents a serious public health issue. The main aim of this study was to characterize E. granulosus s.l. genotypes from wild boar on a continental area of Italy (Campania region), using recently developed mtDNA markers of nad2 and nad5 for reliable identification of different genotypes. Here, nad5 (680 bp) allowed for a clear identification of G1 and G3, whereas a combination of nad2 (714 bp) and nad5 (1394 bp in total) did the same for genotype G7 and its haplogroups G7a and G7b. The results of this study revealed for the first time the presence of genotype G7 in continental Italy. While haplogroup G7b was previously shown to be restricted to the islands of Corsica and Sardinia, here we demonstrate that haplogroup G7b is also present on the mainland of Italy. This work has implications in designing future strategies to reduce CE in Italy.
