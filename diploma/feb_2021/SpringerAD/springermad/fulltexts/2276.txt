Introduction
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly (Sparks et al. ; Ferri et al. ; Blennow et al. ; Reitz et al. ). The main histopathological hallmarks of AD are intracellular neurofibrillary tangles and extracellular amyloid plaques. The tangles are mainly composed of phosphorylated tau, while the plaques contain amyloid β (Aβ) (Masters et al. ; Buerger et al. ). The histopathological changes in AD are reflected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as reduced levels of the 42-amino acid isoform of Aβ (Aβ1-42), and increased level of total tau (T-tau) and phosphorylated tau (P-tau) (Blennow et al. ). However, as other aspects of the disease are being unraveled, CSF markers that reflect other disease mechanisms (e.g., neuronal and synaptic injury) are increasingly gaining interest as potential diagnostic and prognostic markers (Blennow and Zetterberg ; Olsson et al. ). Such markers may provide insight into the different pathophysiological characterizing AD and assist in identifying novel targets for therapies in the future.
Stanniocalcin-1 (STC-1) is a 56-kDa homodimeric glycoprotein-secreted hormone that was originally identified in bony fish, where it is believed to regulate calcium/phosphate homeostasis and protects against toxic hypercalcemia (Wagner et al. ). STC-1 is expressed in various organs including neural cells, mature adipocytes, and megakaryocytes (Serlachius et al. ; Yoshiko and Aubin ). High expression of STC-1 has been reported in terminally differentiated mammalian brain neurons, with the Purkinje cells, the large neurons of basal ganglia, and the pyramidal neurons in the neocortex being particularly rich in STC-1 (Zhang et al. ). STC-1 in brain neurons plays an important role against hypercalcemic and hypoxic damage (Zhang et al. ). An upregulated neuronal expression of STC-1 has been reported in penumbra areas in human and rat brain infarction (Zhang et al. ). Importantly, data suggest that disruption of calcium hemostasis may play a role, at least proximal role, in the pathogenesis of AD (Khachaturian , ).
With the above in mind, we hypothesized that STC-1 concentration would be altered in CSF of patients with neurodegenerative disorders such as AD. We specifically tested the following hypotheses: (1) STC-1 would be possible to measure in human CSF, (2) STC-1 concentration in CSF would correlate with established neuronal markers such as tau, and (3) STC-1 concentration in CSF of patients with AD would be increased. We therefore measured STC-1 in CSF from three independent clinical cohorts, including patients with AD and other types of dementias, as well as cognitively normal controls (CNC).
Methods
Participants
Cohort A
Cohort A was our first explorative analysis cohort, collected at the Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Mölndal, Sweden. The CSF samples were from patients who sought medical advice due to cognitive impairment. Patients were designated as AD ( n = 20) and non-AD ( n = 20) according to CSF AD biomarker concentrations using cutoffs that are around 90 % specific for AD (Hansson et al. ): total tau (T-tau) >350 ng/L and Aβ1-42 <530 ng/L. None of the biochemically normal subjects fulfilled these criteria. All samples were de-identified left-over aliquots from clinical routine analyses, following a procedure approved by the Ethics Committee at University of Gothenburg.
Cohort B
We also included an independent cohort, enrolled at the Institute of Memory and Alzheimer’s Disease at the Pitié-Salpêtrière University Hospital in Paris, France, consisting of a total of 43 patients (12 AD cases, 12 prodromal AD, and 19 with other dementias (OD)). The OD group consisted of patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) ( n = 9), non-AD dementia (NAAD) ( n = 5), and with clinically undetermined cognitive disorder (UCD) ( n = 5).
Cohort C
Cohort C included 20 CNC and 60 patients: 18 AD patients, eight with mixed AD and cerebrovascular disease (mAD), 13 with stable mild cognitive impairment (sMCI), six prodromal AD patients, and 15 with other dementias. The other dementia group consisted of patients with vascular dementia (VaD) ( n = 10), dementia of Lewy body type (DLB) ( n = 4), and FTD ( n = 1). The study participants were recruited at the memory clinic in Falköping, Sweden, and have been described in detail previously (Johansson et al. ). The CNCs were spouses of the included patients or were recruited by advertisements in local newspapers. These individuals had no subjective symptoms of cognitive dysfunction and were cognitively normal upon formal testing.
Ethics
The ethics committees for medical research at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden, and the Pitié-Salpêtrière University Hospital, Paris, France, approved the study. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants or, if incapable, from their next of kin, prior to the inclusion in the study.
Biochemical Procedure
CSF was collected in polypropylene tubes by lumbar puncture through the L3-4 or L4-5 interspace. All CSF samples were stored at −80 °C pending analysis. CSF concentrations of Aβ1-42, T-tau, and P-tau were measured with INNOTEST (Fujirebio, Ghent, Belgium). CSF concentrations of STC-1 were measured using single determinations, in a sandwich enzyme immunoassay, BioAssay™ ELISA Kit (Human), according to the instructions from the manufacturer and using twofold dilution of the samples. All measurements were performed by board-certified laboratory technicians who were blinded to the clinical data.
APOE Genotype
Genotyping for APOE gene (locus 19q13.2) was performed using allelic discrimination technology (TaqMan; Applied Biosystems) or equivalent techniques. Genotypes were obtained for the two single-nucleotide polymorphisms that are used to define the ε2 , ε3 , and ε4 alleles unambiguously (rs7412 and rs429358).
Statistical Analyses
We evaluated association between demographic factors, CSF STC-1, CSF AD biomarkers and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score using Pearson’s correlation. For the group differences in sex, we used Pearson’s χ2 test. Mann–Whitney U test was used for pairwise comparison, and for multiple group comparison Kruskal–Wallis test was used. Bonferroni’s correction was performed for all multiple comparisons. All tests were two-sided, and statistical significance was determined at p < 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed using R (v. 3.0.3, The R Foundation for Statistical Computing).
Results
Demographic Characteristics of the Study Cohorts
The sample size and demographic characteristics of the three cohorts are summarized in Table 1 . As expected, APOE ε4 prevalence was the highest in patients with AD and the lowest in CNC, whereas MMSE score was the lowest in AD patients. Moreover, in all three cohorts, CSF Aβ1-42 concentration was decreased in AD patients, while CSF T-tau and P-tau concentrations were increased in AD (Table 1 ). CSF STC-1 concentration did not differ by age or sex (Table 1 ).

Assay Characteristics
STC-1 concentration was readily measureable in human CSF. The quantitative range of the assay was 31.2–2000 pg/mL, and all the samples were almost tenfold higher than the lower limit of detection and in the mid-region of the calibration curve. Intra-assay coefficients of variation were below 13 %.
Increased STC-1 in Biomarker-Enriched AD Patients
CSF STC-1 concentration was significantly ( p < 0.0001) increased in AD patients compared with CNC in cohort A (Fig. 1 a). Fig. 1 CSF stanniocalcin-1 concentrations in different diagnostic groups. Stanniocalcin-1 (STC-1) was significantly increased in neurochemically verified AD versus controls ( a ). In cohort B, STC-1 was increased in AD patients compared with the prodromal AD and other dementias; however, the increase was not significant when corrected for multiple group comparisons ( b ). In cohort C, the STC-1 was significantly lower in other dementias versus sMCI and CNC ( c ). AD Alzheimer’s disease, CNC cognitively normal controls, mAD mixed AD, pAD prodromal AD, OD other dementias, sMCI stable mild cognitive impairment
Decreased STC-1 in Other Dementias versus AD and CNC
In cohort B, CSF STC-1 concentration was increased in AD patients versus prodromal AD and patients with other dementias; however, the increase was not statistically significant ( p = 0.30 and p = 0.70, respectively, Fig. 1 b). In cohort C, there was no significant difference in CSF STC-1 concentration between AD and CNC ( p = 0.26) (Fig. 1 c). However, CSF STC-1 concentrations were increased in mAD and sMCI compared with CNC. CSF STC-1 concentration was significantly lower in other dementias versus CNC and sMCI ( p = 0.020 and p = 0.040, respectively), after correcting for multiple group comparisons (Fig. 1 c). Detailed analysis of CSF STC-1 concentration among dementias other than AD revealed significantly lower concentrations of CSF STC-1 in DLB and VaD patients versus CNC ( p = 0.036 and p = 0.022, respectively) (Fig. 2 a, b). Fig. 2 CSF stanniocalcin-1 levels were lower in non-AD dementias. a patients with AD had increased CSF STC-1 concentration than patients with FTD, NAAD and UCD; however, the increase was not statistically significant when corrected for multiple group comparison. b CSF STC-1 concentrations were lower in patients with DLB and VaD. AD Alzheimer’s disease, pAD prodromal AD, FTD frontotemproal dementia, NAAD non-AD dementia, UCD unclear cognitive decline, mAD mixed AD, sMCI stable MCI, CNC cognitively normal controls, DLB dementia with Lewy bodies, VaD vascular dementia
Correlation of CSF STC-1 with Markers of AD
The CSF STC-1 concentration correlated positively with T-tau ( r = 0.56, p < 0.001) and P-tau ( r = 0.51, p < 0.001) in cohort A, while there was an inverse correlation with Aβ1-42 ( r = −0.30, p = 0.06). In cohort B, there was a positive correlation between STC-1 and T-tau ( r = 0.44, p = 0.005), and Aβ1-42 ( r = 0.26, p = 0.11), as well as P-tau ( r = 0.46, p = 0.030). However, there was no significant correlation between STC-1 and T-tau ( r = 0.19, p = 0.09) in cohort C, while there was a significant correlation with Aβ1-42 ( r = 0.34, p = 0.002) and P-tau ( r = 0.27, p = 0.014).
Stanniocalcin-1 Levels and Cognitive Decline
There was no correlation between CSF STC-1 concentration and MMSE score in cohort B ( r = −0.04, P = 0.80). However, in cohort C, CSF STC-1 concentration correlated with MMSE score ( r = 0.24, P = 0.04).
The Effect of APOE ε4 on CSF STC-1 Concentration
In cohort C (the only cohort in which we had access to APOE genotype data), there was a significant association of APOE genotype with CSF STC-1 concentration; in particular, APOE ε4 carriers had higher concentrations than non-carriers (mean, 280 pg/mL, SD (76), versus mean 240 pg/mL, SD (73), p = 0.048).
Discussion
The biological function of STC-1 as a key regulator of neuronal calcium homeostasis(Yeung et al. ), the potential association of dysregulated calcium homeostasis with neurodegenerative diseases (Khachaturian ; Subhash et al. ; Khachaturian ; Bostrom et al. ), and the increased STC-1 expression in cerebrovascular disease (Zhang et al. ; Durukan Tolvanen et al. ) led us to hypothesize that STC-1 concentration in CSF could be altered in AD and/or other neurodegenerative diseases and dementia disorders. We found that: (1) STC-1 concentration was reliably measureable in CSF using a commercial ELISA kit, (2) CSF STC-1 concentration was significantly increased in neurochemically verified AD patients compared with non-AD patients, (3) there was no significant difference in CSF STC-1 concentration between AD patients and CNC in a well-characterized clinical cohort; however, in the same cohort CSF STC-1 concentration was higher in mAD and sMCI patients, (4) patients with other dementias, particularly patients with DLB and VaD had significantly lower levels of CSF STC-1 compared with AD, sMCI, and CNC groups, (5) STC-1 levels correlated with the established CSF biomarker tau, and (6) the levels of STC-1 were significantly higher in APOE ε4 carriers compared with non-carriers.
In our exploratory cohort of neurochemically verified AD patients, CSF STC-1 concentration was significantly increased in AD compared with non-AD patients. However, in cohort B, there was no significant difference in CSF STC-1 concentration between AD patients and CNC, and in cohort C, the levels of STC-1 were even lower in AD patients compared with CNC. At present, we do not have a definite explanation to why STC-1 was increased in neurochemically verified AD patients as compared to non-AD cases in cohort A, and not in the other two cohorts. However, one may speculate that the increase could be due to bias in selectivity as the diagnosis of AD was based on the results of the core AD biomarker cutoffs in cohort A with no clinical data (other than that the patients sought medical advice at a memory clinic) available. Further, the non-AD subjects in cohort A may suffer from other dementias that in the other cohorts tended to be associated with lower CSF STC-1 concentration. A replicable finding from both cohorts B and C was the significantly lower levels of STC-1 in patients with DLB and VaD compared with CNC and AD. The mechanism of why the level of STC-1 is reduced in DLB and VaD is not understood, but one could speculate based on the results from the previous experimental studies of STC-1, that cerebral or vascular ischemia may result in higher tissue uptake of STC-1 and, therefore, reduced levels in CSF (Lindsberg et al. ; Zhang et al. ). In addition, CSF STC-1 concentration was significantly increased in APOE ε4 carriers versus non-carriers. Last, CSF STC-1 concentration correlated with CSF tau concentration, suggesting that it reflects neuronal degeneration or related pathophysiology.
In summary, our study provides no strong support for CSF STC-1 as a biomarker for AD. However, a replicable result was the reduced CSF STC-1 concentration observed in the heterogeneous group of dementias other than AD. DLB and VaD stand out as the specific other dementia diagnoses with the lowest CSF STC-1 concentrations. Further studies with larger sample sizes are required in order to examine this aspect in closer detail and, if verified, clarify the causal relationships.
