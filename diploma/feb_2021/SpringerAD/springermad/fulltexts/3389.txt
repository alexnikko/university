Introduction
Diesel engine emissions result from the combustion of diesel fuels. Exposure of the general population varies depending on their proximity to emissions, for example, near to street traffic. Higher exposures have been observed in workplaces such as those in the mining, railway, construction and transport industries. In 2012, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified diesel engine emissions as carcinogenic for humans (“Group 1”). Human volunteer studies showed clear evidence that diesel fumes cause inflammatory effects in the lungs. In addition, exposure to diesel fumes has been suggested as the cause of cardiovascular effects and the intensification of asthma.
The composition of diesel exhaust and its concentrations in air have changed significantly over time, to the extent that now there is a distinction between “traditional” and “new technology” diesel emissions. The term “traditional diesel engine emission” usually applies to the exhaust of diesel vehicles that comply with the EURO 2 emission standards; whereas “New technology Diesel” engines comply with emissions from EURO 3 vehicles and higher. Traditional diesel effects are linked mainly to inflammation and carcinogenicity in the lung, which are caused by the carbon particles with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) adsorbed to them, while “new technology diesel” emissions induce inflammatory effects in the lung by several irritants, predominantly by nitrogen oxides. Carcinogenic effects are, therefore, no longer to be expected from exposure to new technology diesel. The occurrence of effects is determined by the extent of exposure, which is high in certain workplaces and much lower in ambient air, with large differences in the concentrations depending on the proximity to the sources of emissions.
This review is based on previous comprehensive documentations such as Henschler ( ); IARC ( , ); WHO ( ); US EPA ( , ); Greim ( ); NEG/DECOS ( ) and more recent publications. Based on this information it was the aim of this review to present the science-based data on the improvements of emissions from passenger cars. This is to evaluate whether emissions from passenger cars with diesel engines equipped with modern emission control technology and their energy efficiency compare with gasoline-driven cars.
Components of diesel exhaust
The amount and exact composition of emissions from diesel engines, as well as from gasoline-driven engines, depends on the engine type, the composition and physical properties of the fuel, and the methods of exhaust-gas purification.
The main components of the gas phase of diesel engine emissions include nitrogen, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), oxygen and water vapour. Nitrogen oxides (NO x ) and carbon monoxide (CO) are formed as products of incomplete combustion. In addition, there are smaller amounts of sulphur dioxide (SO 2 ) and various organic compounds (alkanes, alkenes, carbonyl compounds, carbonic acids, aromatics and their nitrated derivatives). The particle phase consists mainly of elemental carbon and adsorbed organic compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), oxidized PAHs, nitro-PAHs, sulphates, nitrates, metals or other trace elements. The particles vary in size from 0.03 to 2.5 μm and, therefore, also include so-called ultrafine particles with a diameter of less than 100 nm.
Over the past 20 years, diesel engine emissions have been subject to stringent regulations in the European Union and worldwide, which has led to considerable development of diesel combustion and catalyst technologies. As a result, emissions and composition of exhaust fumes have changed greatly. Thus, a considerable decrease in the adverse effects due to diesel engine exhaust on human health should also to be expected. The composition of diesel engine emissions also depends on the source of the fuel. Usually, diesel fuels derived from crude oil belong to the middle distillates of crude oil. Alternatives such as the so-called “biodiesel” are produced from vegetable oil or animal fats, and synthetic fuels from coal, gas or bio-mass.
The increasingly strict regulations for the registration of new cars to control the emissions of both diesel engines and gasoline-driven engines are given in Table 1 .

Accordingly, modern diesel engines and their exhaust reduction devices are regulated in such a way that their emissions are similar to the gasoline-driven engines. The reduction of particulate emissions of EURO 5 diesel engines has been achieved by introducing a diesel particulate filter (DPF) in combination with a diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) for all passenger cars. NO x emissions were reduced by the application of a cooled exhaust gas recirculation (EGR); however, physical and chemical boundary conditions limited the NO x reduction potential of this technical approach. The main consequence of the DOC + DPF configuration is a significant decrease of particle emissions, but an increase of NO x emissions. The obvious consequence was that the high NO 2 emissions of the EURO 5 vehicles exceeded the NEDC (New European Driving Cycle) emission limit of 180 mg/km. As a result, there were only two possibilities to reduce the NO x emissions. The legal approach was to reduce the EGR rate at operating conditions to lower NO x emissions, with the obvious consequence that particulate emissions increased. The alternative used by some companies was to install illegal software that detected the vehicle test bench operation, resulting in low emissions being recorded during the test cycle. Additionally, a time trigger was used, which reduced emissions during the typical test cycle to about 20 min. Detection of this illegal software in some vehicles led to the “Diesel scandal”. The scandal emerged in September 2015 when the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reported that VW had installed illegal so-called defeat devices in hundreds of thousands of 2.0-L engines in the United States since 2009. The software used in the Volkswagen, Porsche, Audi, Seat and Skoda brands helped make the cars meet exhaust pollution standards when monitored in tests, but in real life their emissions exceeded the limits. Shortly thereafter the Volkswagen company admitted that some 11 million diesel vehicles worldwide, including 8.5 million in Europe, and 600,000 in the United States, had been fitted with the software. In the following years it turned out that other carmakers had also installed illegal software and in May 2018 the German authorities ordered Porsche to recall 60,000 vehicles across Europe after they were found to have been equipped with so-called “defeat devices”. A month later, Audi was ordered to recall 60,000 cars for the same reason.
After-treatment devices to reduce NO x emissions have now been introduced, with the first technologies available at the end of the past decade. The main challenge of SCR (selective catalyst reduction) has been to reach an exhaust gas temperature of 200 °C, which is ambitious for diesel engines with “underbody catalyst converters”. This led to the development of second generation of passenger car SCR systems, which were introduced in 2016. This combined filtration and catalysis on a filter-catalyst device mounted directly adjacent to the engine, which enables high temperatures to be reached and thus high efficiencies in reducing soot particle and NO x emissions.
In the meantime, an extremely challenging new real driving emission legislation has been developed, which includes the use of portable real driving emission measurements (PEMS). The worldwide harmonized light vehicles test procedure (WLTP) was introduced on September 1, 2017 for new cars, which better simulates emissions under different driving conditions. Cars approved using the old NEDC test can still be sold. Since September 2018 all new vehicles must be certified according to the WLTP test procedure and since January 2019 all cars at dealership should have WLTP-CO 2 values only (see www.dieselnet.com/standards/eu/ld.php and https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/transport/vehicles/cars_en .
The regulation requires a constant reduction of diesel exhaust emissions, which in case of CO 2 has been regulated as follows: 2015: a fleet-average CO 2 emission target of 130 g/km must be achieved using vehicle technology by each vehicle manufacturer by 2015. To meet the EU CO 2 emission target of 130 g/km, a further emission reduction of 10 g/km can be achieved by additional measures such as the use of biofuels. 2020: a fleet-average CO 2 emission target of 95 g/km must be met by 95% of each manufacturers’ new passenger cars registered in 2020, and by 100% of cars from 2021 onwards.
Toxicology of diesel engine emissions
Epidemiological data consistently show an association between (traditional) diesel engine exhaust exposure and lung cancer, with risk ratios between 1.3 and 1.6. The study by Silverman et al. ( , ) in miners gave an odds ratio of 2.8 (1.3–6.3) for the highest exposure quartile with ≥ 563 µg elemental carbon/m 3 × year, compared to < 3 µg elemental carbon/m 3 × year in the lowest quartile. However, this study exhibited several inconsistencies and gave rise to questions and points of criticism, which have been addressed by Boffetta ( ); McClellan ( ); Morfeld ( ); Hesterberg et al. ( ); Möhner et al. ( , ); Crump et al. ( , ); Möhner and Wendt ( ); including responses by Silverman and Attfield ( ). Finally, Möhner and Wendt ( ) concluded as follows:
“Our review shows that most studies cannot add evidence for a causal link between DE (diesel exhaust) exposure and lung cancer risk. Therefore, a reliable derivation of a quantitative exposure–response relationship is not possible at present. In view of the results from animal studies and the fact that a threshold model cannot be ruled out, a conservative lower bound for a possible threshold value should be determined. Such a value could be derived by the German cohort study among potash miners. An upper bound for a cumulative exposure of 2.5 mg/m 3 years REC seems to be sufficient to prevent a detectable increase of lung cancer risk. This value corresponds to an average annual value of 50 μg/m 3 REC (respirable elemental carbon) assuming a working life of 45 years. Unless a re-analysis of the DEMS (Diesel Exhaust in Miners Study) yields considerably higher values, this value could be recommended as threshold value for occupational safety.”
Traditional diesel engine emissions are considered to be carcinogenic in animal experiments (for details see Henschler ; IARC , ; WHO ; Greim ; US EPA , ; SCOEL ; NEG/DECOS ). However, particulate matter and adsorbed mutagenic compounds are present in much lower concentrations in new-technology diesel engine exhausts than in traditional diesel engine exhausts. In accordance with this, 1-year mouse and 2-year rat studies with 2007-compliant diesel engine exhaust did not show tumours or genotoxicity (Hallberg et al. ; McDonald et al. ). In the rat study, four groups were exposed to one of three concentrations (dilutions) of exhaust, or to clean air as a negative control. Dilutions of exhaust were set to yield average integrated concentrations of 4.2, 0.8, and 0.1 ppm NO 2 . The major outcome of this study was the absence of pre-neoplastic lung lesions, primary lung neoplasia, or neoplasia of any type attributable to the exposure. The lung lesions that did occur were minimal to mild and can be detected only at the highest exposure level. The effects were generally consistent with those observed previously in rats exposed chronically to NO 2 alone. This suggests that NO 2 may have been the primary driver of the biologic responses with a clear NOAEC of 0.8 ppm NO 2 (≈ 1.6 mg/m 3 ).
Toxicology of the major components of diesel engine emissions
While the effects of traditional diesel are attributed predominantly to the carbon particles and the carcinogenic PAHs and nitro-PAHs adsorbed to them, “new Diesel” contains increasingly less elementary carbon; instead, NO x , especially NO 2 , are the primary drivers of the adverse effects.
Particles
Particles with a carbon core contain genotoxic components such as PAH or nitro-PAH. This has raised the question as to whether carcinogenicity of traditional Diesel is based on direct or indirect genotoxicity. The average benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) content of the carbon core of diesel particles is about 4 ng/mg (Heinrich et al. , Liang et al. , NIST ). Since 1 mg diesel particles contain 50% carbon, 1 mg diesel particles contain about 2 ng BaP. The US EPA unit risk for life time inhalation BaP exposure is 1 μg = 5:10.000. Accordingly, the risk of about 2 ng BAP corresponds to 1:1,000,000,000. This shows that the carcinogenic risk of adherent BaP is very low; therefore, a risk assessment of diesel particles can be based on the particle effect, namely inflammation. Consequently, a non-linear dose–response relationship and a threshold mechanism for carcinogenicity can be anticipated. Therefore, the “Ausschuss für Gefahrstoffe”, the German Committee on Hazardous Substances (AGS) (see BAuA ), classified traditional diesel engine emissions as threshold carcinogens and derived an “Arbeitsplatzgrenzwert”, occupational exposure limit (AGW), of 50 μg/m 3 . This is based on the Mauderly et al. ( ) inhalation study in rats, which took into account the different lung surfaces in rats and humans, the size of the elemental carbon core of diesel particles, the species-specific particle clearance from the lung, the respiratory volume and the rate at light work over 8 h/day for 5 days/week. Mauderly et al. ( ) exposed male and female F344 rats to 0.35, 3.5 or 7.1 mg/m 3 Diesel exhaust for 7 h/day, 5 days/week for up to 30 months. The mid and high exposures, but not the low exposure, resulted in increased tumour incidences, benign squamous cysts, dose-dependent interstitial lung fibrosis and proliferative lung diseases that were significantly elevated over the control group. Two pulmonary inflammatory indicators in the bronchoalveolar lung fluid were elevated and correlated with the presence of pulmonary fibrosis.
It can be concluded that new diesel engine exhaust is not carcinogenic. Its primary effect is inflammation triggered by NO 2 , with a threshold (NOAEC) of 0.8 ppm NO 2 , identified in the life time exposure study in F344 rats described above.
Nitrogen dioxide
In ambient air nitrogen oxide is rapidly oxidized to NO 2 so that health effects of the NO x emissions can be evaluated according to the NO 2 concentrations in workplaces and ambient air. Based on epidemiological studies, exposures of volunteers and animal experiments, the OEL for NO 2 in Europe is 0.5 ppm (950 μg/m 3 ) [German DFG Permanent Senate Commission for the Investigation of Health Hazards of Chemical Compounds in the Work Area (MAK), EU Scientific Committee on Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL)]. For an ambient air limit, the European Commission adopted the current WHO guideline with an 1-h level of 200 μg/m 3 and an annual average of 40 μg/m 3 (WHO , ). This is mainly based on cross-sectional studies, which indicate that effects on asthmatics appear to be more prominent in children than in adults.
On April 6, 2018, the US EPA issued a decision to retain the current national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for oxides of nitrogen (NO x ). Based on a review of the full body of scientific evidence, the US EPA has concluded that the current NAAQS protects the public health, including the at-risk populations of elderly adults, children and people with asthma, with an adequate margin of safety. The NAAQS for nitrogen oxides are a 1-h standard at a level of 100 ppb (188 μg/m 3 ) based on the 3-year average of 98th percentile of the yearly distribution of 1-h daily maximum concentrations, and an annual mean value of 53 ppb (100 μg/m 3 ). The US EPA concluded: Individual studies (N = 4–20) generally do not report statistically significant increases in AR (airway responsiveness) following exposures to NO 2 concentrations at or below 200 ppb, though the evidence suggests a trend toward increased AR following NO 2 exposures from 140 to 200 ppb. In contrast, individual studies do not indicate a consistent trend towards increased AR following 1-h exposures to 100 ppb NO 2 . Important limitations in this evidence include the lack of a dose–response relationship between NO 2 and AR and uncertainty in the adversity of the reported increases in AR. These limitations become increasingly important at the lower NO 2 exposure concentrations (i.e., at or near 100 ppb), where the evidence for NO 2− induced increases in AR is not consistent across studies.
Both, US EPA and WHO indicate that the strongest evidence supporting the conclusion of the causal relationship comes from controlled human exposure studies demonstrating NO 2 induced increases in airway responses (AR) in individuals with asthma with supporting evidence for a range of respiratory effects from epidemiological studies. Exposures of 100–530 ppb resulted in halving the dose of a challenge agent required to increase AR in about a quarter of study volunteers. In a subset of studies using NO 2 exposure to 260 ppb for 15–30 min or 400 ppb for up to 6 h provided evidence that study volunteers with asthma and allergy experienced increased inflammatory responses following allergen challenge (for details see US EPA ).
However, US EPA indicates that the findings in volunteers with asthma following exposures between 100 and 530 ppb have limitations. These are the lack of apparent dose–response relationship, uncertainty on the potential adversity of responses, and the general focus of available studies on people with mild asthma, rather than more severe asthma. Obviously, although the ambient air limit values of the EU and the US EPA are based on the same data, the EU values of 40 μg/m 3 for continuous exposure and 200 μg/m 3 for 1 h 18 times per year are more conservative. In a recent review (Möhner ) about the epidemiological data on the mortality risk of NO 2 , the author concludes as follows:
The studies do not provide a valid basis for a population based estimation of years of life lost due to NO 2 exposure. In view of the weak evidence and the global side-effects on the environment and resources, the commensurability of driving bans for diesel-powered vehicles must be questioned.
Human relevance of concentrations measured at monitor stations
According to the European regulation, the long-term exposure limits (mean values per year) for NO 2 and particles should not be exceeded. In Germany, several cities have been forced by court decisions to ban vehicles with diesel engines totally or in specific streets with NO 2 levels exceeding the limit value of 40 μg/m 3 . Usually, these values are derived from sampling points close to the street with high traffic (e.g., at Neckartor in Stuttgart, Germany). In such cases, the court decisions contradict the Directive 2008/50/EC, Annex III, which clearly indicates that the data should provide information on the long-term exposure of the general population compared to the ambient air limit values, rather than concentrations in a very small micro-environment to which the population may be exposed occasionally, if ever. The siting of sampling points is defined as follows:
B. Macroscale siting of sampling points 1. Protection of human health (Directive 2008/50/EC, Annex III) 1. (a) Sampling points directed at the protection of human health shall be sited in such a way as to provide data on the following: The areas within zones and agglomerations where the highest concentrations occur to which the population is likely to be directly or indirectly exposed for a period which is significant in relation to the averaging period of the limit value(s), Levels in other areas within the zones and agglomerations which are representative of the exposure of the general population, 2. (b) Sampling points shall in general be sited in such a way as to avoid measuring very small micro-environments in their immediate vicinity, which means that a sampling point must be sited in such a way that the air sampled is representative of air quality for a street segment no less than 100 m length at traffic-orientated sites and at least 250 m × 250 m at industrial sites, where feasible; 3. (c) Urban background locations shall be located so that their pollution level is influenced by the integrated contribution from all sources upwind of the station. The pollution level should not be dominated by a single source unless such a situation is typical for a larger urban area. Those sampling points shall, as a general rule, be representative for several square kilometres;
This clearly indicates that the use of data obtained from sampling points in the immediate vicinity of a street is not suitable to evaluate the continuous exposure of the population and does not take into consideration several aspects, e.g., short, if any, resting time of people near the sampling point or a decline of the concentration in air due to the distance to their living area. Contradictory to this is the recent decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (C-723/17 of June 26, 2019) that concentrations exceeding the reference values measured at sampling points close to streets violate the EU regulation because they affect human health. Average values from different sampling points are considered of little value. This not only contradicts Directive 2008/50/EC, Annex III but also ignores the definition of the air control limits. These are designed for long-term, life-time exposure of the population, which if all will be exposed at these points for minutes only.
Furthermore, at least in Germany, a general reduction of concentrations at traffic-oriented sites and total emissions of NO 2 and PM 10 has been observed. Since 1995, the average NO 2 concentrations at traffic-oriented sites decreased from ~ 50 µg/m 3 to less than 40 µg/m 3 . Moreover, the total emissions in Germany decreased by almost 60% between 1995 and 2016 (Umweltbundesamt ). At traffic-orientated sites, PM 10 emissions predominantly result from diesel emissions and dust from tires and the street. In Germany, since the early 1990s, the average concentrations decreased from about 50 µg/m 3 to 15–20 µg/m 3 in 2016. Likewise, according to the Federal Environmental Agency, the total emissions of PM 10 decreased by 38% between 1995 and 2016 (Umweltbundesamt ).
Fuel consumption of diesel- and gasoline-driven engines
Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and carbon (C) emissions for different types of vehicles are listed in Table 2 .

Table 2 clearly indicates that diesel engines emit 15–20% less CO 2 and carbon (C) than gasoline-driven engines. It also indicates that diesel engines consume less fuel than gasoline-driven engines.
Summary and conclusions
Diesel engine emissions are formed during the combustion of diesel fuels. Emissions contain several hundred chemical compounds, which are emitted partly as gas and partly as particles. As a result of improved technologies in response to stringent global regulations, the composition of emissions from modern engines has radically changed compared to “traditional” diesel emissions. Traditional diesel emissions are suspected of causing cancer, at least in experimental animals, whereby the carcinogenic effects are attributed to the carbon particles with PAHs bound to them. By contrast, modern diesel emissions cause irritation and inflammatory reactions in the lungs in long-term inhalation studies in rodents but they are not carcinogenic. The adverse effects of these emissions are determined mainly by the level of nitrogen oxides, primarily by NO 2 .
Since 2000, with the introduction of Euro 3 standards, the emissions of diesel engines have been increasingly reduced. Thus, a considerable decrease in the adverse effects due to diesel engine exhaust on human health should also be expected. The Euro 5 category achieved a significant reduction of particles by the inclusion of an oxidation catalyst, which conversely led to increased NO x emissions that exceeded the emission standard. The illegally applied software devices to reduce NO x emissions during the test cycles led to the so-called “Diesel scandal”. A further reduction of diesel engine emissions has been achieved by the regulation for EURO 6 engines which led to emissions to values similar to gasoline-driven engines. However, it should be noted that diesel engines consume 15–20% less fuel than gasoline-driven cars and, as a result, are more efficient in fuel combustion and emit less carbon dioxide and carbon.
With this the following conclusions can be made: The regulations for EURO 6 diesel passenger car emissions are almost the same as for EURO 6 gasoline-driven cars. Since diesel-driven cars emit by 20% less CO 2 than those with gasoline-driven engines there is no reason to question up to date diesel motor technology. The worldwide harmonized light vehicles test procedure (WLTP) simulates emissions under different driving conditions so that they represent actual driving conditions much more than before. Traffic restrictions for passenger cars with diesel technology based in data from sampling points close to the street with high traffic are highly debatable, because they do not represent the long-term exposure of the population. This contradicts Directive 2008/50/EC, Annex III, which clearly states that such values are not suitable to evaluate health effects of a continuous exposure of the population. The recent conclusion of the European Court of Justice, which is based on the assumption that even short-term exposures affect human health ignores the scientific evidence as well. In contrast to the old technology new diesel engine exhaust is not carcinogenic. Adverse effects seen at high concentrations in animal studies are primarily caused by the inflammatory effect of NO 2 , with a threshold (NOAEC) of 0.8 ppm (about 1600 μg/m 3 ) NO 2 , which is based on long-term studies in experimental animals and supported by several hours’ exposure studies in humans. Thus, health effects due to short-term exposures for a few minutes up to concentrations of 100 μg/m 3 are not plausible. Accordingly, the US EPA after re-evaluating the existing data-base confirmed its annual mean value of 100 μg/m 3 and 200 μg/m 3 for short-term exposures.
