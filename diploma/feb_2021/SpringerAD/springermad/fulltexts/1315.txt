Introduction
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer and the third leading cause of cancer death in both men and women world-wide [ ]. It is believed that proper screening could prevent the majority of these deaths. This is particularly important since early colorectal cancer is asymptomatic [ ]. In the US over the past 10 years there has been progress in reducing the incidence of colorectal cancer through prevention and early detection of the disease [ ]. However, in Asia there has been an increase in the morbidity and mortality due to CRC due to changes in lifestyle and diet [ ]. In addition, the age of patients in Asia with CRC is decreasing which has major implications for public health.
Currently, there are a number of methods used to screen for colorectal cancer and include stool tests that primarily detect cancer, and flexible sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, CT, colonography, and double-contrast barium enema which detect cancer and precancerous growths [ ]. Many of these methods are invasive or have limited sensitivity. Development of simple non-invasive sensitive screens for colorectal cancer would be beneficiary both for the patient and the healthcare providers [ ].
Detection of cancer markers is a non-invasive method in the diagnosis of cancers. It is acceptable in patients and simple in procedures. Thus, detection of cancer markers plays important clinical roles in the early diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of CRC [ ]. In the present study, five serological biomarkers (carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA], carbohydrate antigen CA19–9, CA125, CYFRA21–1, and CA72–4) which are associated with colon-cancer were analyzed to evaluate their association with patient clinical characteristics and disease progression in CRC. CEA is a serum glycoprotein and currently is the most widely used marker for colon cancer [ ]. It is commonly secreted by tumors located in hollow organs and has a specificity and sensitivity of 36 and 87 %, respectively, in screening for colon cancer [ ]. CA19–9 is an antigen that elevated in many types of gastrointestinal cancer including colorectal cancer, esophageal cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma [ ]. CA19–9 has a sensitivity and specificity of 23 and 96 % for colorectal cancer [ ]. CA125 is a glycoprotein antigen that was first found associated with ovarian cancer [ ]. It is also associated with gastric, colon, lung, pancreatic, and liver cancers, as well as, cancers of the blood. Multivariate analysis revealed that serum CEA levels (all p < 0.001) was an independent prognostic predictors for liver metastases [ , , , ]. CA72–4 has a sensitivity of approximately 40 % in colorectal and gastric cancer and 50 % in ovarian cancer, with an overall specificity of more than 95 % [ ]. CYFRA21–1 is a fragment of cytokeritin-19. Cytokeritin-19 is expressed in the unstratified or pseudostratified epithelium of the bronchial tress and is over expressed in many lung cancers [ , , ] and has also been implicated as a marker for colorectal cancer [ , ]. In colorectal cancer at the level of 95 % sensitivity, CYFRA21–1 has a specificity of about 35.5 % [ ].
Patients and Methods
This was a retrospective study of patients admitted to Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University from January 2006 to December 2007 that investigated the association of the expression of CEA, CA19–9, CA125, CYFRA21–1and CA72–4 with colorectal cancer. Patients were followed for 5 years. The study was approved by the institutional review board of Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China. Informed patients’ consents had been obtained in advance.
Study Patients
Eligible patients had diagnosed colorectal cancer as determined by pathology following surgery. Patients had received no preoperative chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Patients who were lost during the 5-year follow-up or died from other causes were excluded from the analysis. Patients were staged in accordance with TMN and Dukes classification.
Analysis of CEA, CA19–2, CA125, CYFRA21–1 and CA72–4
Fasting blood (2 ml) was collected from the cubital vein in the morning and serum was collected by centrifugation. All 5 markers were assessed at patient initial screening for cancer, pre and post-surgery, routine follow-up, and at disease recurrence. CEA, CA19–2, CA125, CYFRA21–1 and CA72–4 were detected using electrochemiluminescence immunoassay system (Elecsys 2010, Roche, Basel Switzerland) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The reference range was 0 to 5 ng/ml for CEA, 0 to 34 kU/L for CA19–9, 0 to 35 kU/L for CA125, 0 to 3.3 kU/L for CYFRA21–1 and 0 to 7 kU/L for CA72–4.
Statistical Analysis
Patients’ demographics and clinical characteristics were summarized descriptively as were serological markers, including CEA, CA125, CA19–9, CA72–4, and CYFRA21–1for pre-operation, post-operation, and recurrence period. Changes in expression of serological makers during different treatment periods were determined using the McNemar test. The association of expression of serological makers with patient demographics and clinical characteristics were performed using the Mann–Whitney U test and Pearson Chi-square or Fisher’s exact test with Yate’s correction for samples in which <5 cell expressed a given marker. A step-wise Cox-regression analysis was applied to identify the associations among time related data, overall survival time, and recurrence time in comparison with patient demographics, clinical characteristics, and pre-operative marker’s expression, respectively. Variables with significant associations in univariate Cox-regression analysis ( P < 0.05) were selected and analyzed using multivariate Cox-regression analysis. Moreover, Bayesian information criterion (BIC) index to evaluate which of the 5 markers may be best at predicting overall survival (smaller value is better). Hazard ratios (HR) with corresponding 95 % confidence intervals (95 %CI.) as well as P -values were determined by Cox-regression analysis. All statistical assessments were two-tailed and considered significantly at P < 0.05. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to evaluate the cumulative overall survival and disease recurrence rates. All the statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 18.0 statistics software (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
There are 373 patients enrolled in the study and all completed the trial. The median age of was 62 years, the most common form of cancer was adenocarcinoma (85.5 %) and most tumors were well differentiated (54.2 %) (Table 1 ). The most common depth of tumor infiltration and abdominal lymph node metastasis was serosal layer and pareneoplasctic lymph node metastasis (40 %) followed by serosal layer alone (29.2 %). Most patients had either stage III (44.0 %) or stage II (29.0 %) cancer and had cancer in the right colon (50.9 %). The majority of patients had no metastasis (86.6 %) or disease recurrence (61.4 %). About half the patients (55.5 %) were still alive at the end of the 5-year follow-up period.

All the five markers, CEA, CA19–9, CA125, CA72–4, and CYFRA21–1 were present in the patient population prior to and after surgery as well as when the disease recurred (Table 2 ). Prior to surgery less than 50 % of the patient were positive for any of the 5 markers with the most common being CEA (48 %), CA19–9 (33.2 %) and CYFRA21–1 (29.8 %). Following surgery, the proportion of patients having these makers significantly decreased (all P -values < 0.001) (Table 2 ). Disease recurrence was associated with a significant increase from post-surgery in the proportion of patients positive for the 5 markers (Table 2 ). CEA was the most common (87.5 %) followed by CYFRA21–1 (73.6 %) and CA19–9 (70.1 %).

Evaluation of the association of being positive for a given marker and demographics and disease characteristics found patients with positive CEA might be older than patients with negative CEA (median age: 65 vs. 59 years, P = 0.002). Furthermore, the positive expressions of a given markers was associated with degree of tumor differentiation, depth of infiltration, clinical stage, organ metastasis, recurrence, and survival status. CA72–4 was significantly associated with lesion site (all P -values < 0.05) (Tables 3 and 4 ).

Figure 1 represented the Kaplan-Meier curve of overall survival (OS) and recurrence for the 373 patients. The estimated mean of time to OS was derived as 47.1 months with a 95 %CI. = 45.5 to 48.8 months. The estimated mean of time to recurrence was derived as 42.4 months with a 95 %CI. = 40.0 to 44.7 months. (Fig. 1 ). Fig. 1 Kaplan-Meier curves of ( a ) overall survival (OS) and ( b ) recurrence. The estimated mean of time to OS was derived as 47.1 months (95 %CI, 45.5 to 48.8 months). The estimated mean of time to recurrence was derived as 42.4 months (95 %CI, 40.0 to 44.7 months)
Univariate analysis found that overall survival was associated with patients’ clinical characteristics as well as pre-operative and post-operative expression of CEA, CA125, CA19–9, CA72–4, CYFRA21–1 expressions (Table 5 ). Multivariate analysis showed that overall survival was associated with signet ring carcinoma, good differentiation, depth of infiltration (serosal layer plus paraneoplastic lymph node metastasis, serosal layer plus paraneoplastic lymph node and mesenteric lymph node metastasis), stage II cancer, and the presence of CEA before surgery (all P -value < 0.05) (Table 5 ).

Univariate Cox-regression analysis found disease recurrence was associated with patients’ clinical characteristics, and pre- and post-operative expression CEA, CA125, CA19–9, CA72–4, CYFRA21–1 expressions. Multivariate Cox-regression analysis revealed disease recurrence was associated with degree of differentiation (well differentiated), and depth of infiltration (serosal layer plus paraneoplastic lymph node metastasis, serosal layer plus paraneoplastic lymph node and mesenteric lymph node metastasis) (all P -value < 0.05). There was no significant association for disease recurrence and pre-operative and post-operative CEA, CA125, CA19–9, CA72–4, or CYFRA21–1 expressions. (Table 6 ).

To further examine the role of pre- and post-operative levels of the 5 markers in predicting overall survival, we used the BIC index to evaluate which of the 5 markers may be best at predicting overall survival (smaller value is better) (see Table 7 ). The model was based on the multivariate model in this manuscript. Each marker was individually included in the multivariate analysis model which adjusted for patients’ age, pathological type, degree of differentiation, depth of infiltration and abdominal lymph node metastasis, clinical stage, lesion site, and organ metastasis. The pre- and post—operative analyses indicated that models containing levels of CEA and CA199 or CEA and CYFRA21–1 might be better at predicting overall survival than the model which included other marker combinations including all 5 markers. (for pre-operative, BIC index: 1716.68 vs. 1730.75, respectively, and for post-operative, BIC index: 1718.56 vs. 1731.64) (Table 7 ). We also found that post-operative levels for each marker were positively correlated with pre-operative levels and this was independent of whether a patient was alive or dead (Table 8 ).

Discussion
This study evaluated the association of CEA, CA19–9, CA7–24, CA125, and CYFRA21–1 with disease characteristics, patient demographics, and disease progression in patients with CRC. We found that it was more common for a patient to express at least one of these markers prior to surgery and at disease recurrence than following surgery. In general, the presence of CEA, CA19–9, CA125, CYFRA21–1, and CA72–4 were not associated with gender, age, pathological type, and location of the cancer (all P -values >0.05), but were associated with poor tumor differentiation, higher tumor invasion, greater degree of abdominal lymph node metastasis, and higher TNM and Dukes stage tumors, and overall survival (all P -values <0.01). In contrast to the other markers, CEA was associated with older age (median 65 years of age), and multivariate analysis indicated the pre-surgery levels of only CEA correlated with overall survival. Multivariate analysis did not find an association of post-operative levels of any of the 5 markers to be significantly associated with disease recurrence or overall survival. Using the BIC Index we found that models containing pre- or post-operative levels of CEA and CA199 or CEA and CYFRA21–1 were possibly better at predicting overall survival than model which included other combination of marker or all 5 markers. These findings suggest CEA plus CA199 or CEA plus CYRFA21–1 may be useful in aiding in diagnosis, following recurrence, and monitoring patients.
Medically useful tumor markers to screen a large population at risk for a specific cancer would ideally be non-invasive, highly sensitive and specific, and inexpensive. CEA, CA199, CA125, and CA72–4 are commonly used for post-operative surveillance and monitoring treatment effect for colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer and gastric cancer, respectively, [ , , , , ]. In this study the overall positive rate of these markers prior to surgery were 48, 33.2, 23.1 %, respectively, which was similar to that reported previously [ ]. In our study, the pre-operative positive rate for CEA was similar to another study which reported 43.9 % sensitivity of detecting colorectal cancer [ ]. We found that CA125 was positive for 24.4 % of patient prior to surgery which was less than that reported in a prior study which had a positive rate of 64.1 % [ ]. The difference between the studies may reflect that the earlier study used microarrays to assay expression of the factor which is more sensitive than immunofluorescence method used in this study.
Several prior studies have also evaluated the correlation of CEA, CA125, CA19–9 with overall survival and disease recurrence [ , , ]. Similar to our study, the presence of CEA has been shown previously to be predictive of increased mortality and overall survival [ , ]. In contrast to our study, multivariate analysis in one study found pre-surgery serum CA125 status and not CEA was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival ( P = 0.016) [ ]. In addition, CA19–9 previously was shown to be an indicator of disease recurrence and overall survival, [ , , , ] and CA72–4 was associated with high recurrence rate [ ]. Interestingly, the combination of being positive for CA19–9, CEA, and CA125 was a strong predictor of overall survival and patients who were positive for these 3 markers also had the highest rate of disease recurrence (100 %) [ , ]. The difference between ours and other studies may reflect methods of analysis, study design, and patient population.
There are several limitations to our study which include the small sample size and the retrospective nature of the study. Since CYFRA21-1had not investigated as a marker for colorectal cancer before, further study had been warranted. In addition, analysis of the combination of markers and their relationship to disease characteristics, overall survival, and recurrence rate may give additional insight in the use of these markers in helping physicians following histoligical diagnosis in making clinical judgments on the patient status, and aid in monitoring treatment outcomes..
Conclusion
In conclusion, the cancer markers CEA, CA199, CA125, CYFRA21–1 and CA72–4 may potentially be useful in diagnosing and predicting treatment outcomes in patients with colorectal cancer. However, further analysis is needed to devise assays with these markers that have high sensitivity and specificity.
