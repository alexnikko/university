Introduction
The mammary secretions of mammals contain different somatic cell types including immune cells (lymphocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, and eosinophils) and mammary epithelial cells (MEC), as shown in various species [ , , ]. The MEC present in milk are exfoliated through shedding from the epithelium. Most of the MEC exfoliated into milk are viable and exhibit characteristics of differentiated alveolar cells [ ]. It was recently shown in ruminants that the MEC exfoliation process likely participates in regulating MEC number in the mammary gland and thereby participates in milk yield variations during lactation or in response to environmental or management factors [ ]. In dairy cows, the number of MEC that are lost by exfoliation per day averages 390 × 10 6 [ ] which represents a daily loss of 0.007% of the total number of MEC in the udder. However, the mechanisms that regulate MEC exfoliation remain unknown.
In humans, it has been hypothesized that either the cell turnover in the secretory tissue or the pressures associated with the continued filling and emptying cycle associated with milk synthesis and breastfeeding could be responsible for MEC exfoliation from the ductal or luminal layer [ ]. In response to the tactile stimulation of the teat during suckling or milking, a neural signal is carried to the brain resulting in the release of oxytocin (OT) into the general blood circulation by the neural lobe of the pituitary gland. In the mammary gland, OT binds to its specific receptors located on the myoepithelial cells, which surround the mammary epithelium, and induces the contraction of the myoepithelial cells. As a consequence of the mechanical forces exerted on the mammary epithelium, milk contained in the alveoli is expelled through the ducts into the nipple or the teat and becomes available for the offspring or is collected by the milking machine [ ]. This milk ejection reflex is similar in all mammalian species from rodents to ruminants and humans [ , ]. In ruminants, however, before being expelled through the teat, the alveolar milk descends into a specific organ ensuring the storage of milk between two suckling or milking bouts, namely, the cistern [ ].
In ruminants submitted to various physiological, breeding or environmental conditions, the increase in the rate of MEC exfoliation was associated with disruption of the mammary epithelium [ ]. Moreover, in dairy cows, OT administered at a supraphysiological dose has been shown to increase the permeability of the mammary epithelium [ , , ]. Milking has also been shown to disrupt the mammary epithelium [ ]. This mammary epithelium disruption at milking was concomitant with the exfoliation of MEC [ ]. We therefore hypothesized that the milking-induced release of OT induces myoepithelial cell contraction, which, in turn, could induce mammary epithelium disruption and stimulate MEC exfoliation through mechanical forces exerted on the mammary epithelium. To investigate the role of myoepithelial cell contraction in MEC exfoliation, we inhibited or induced the contraction of myoepithelial cells at milking by administering the OT receptor antagonist atosiban (Ato) or exogenous OT, respectively (Fig. 1 ). Since the MEC exfoliation observed at milking was reported to be concomitant with mammary epithelium disruption, we also investigated tight junction opening in response to these treatments. Fig. 1 Description of the experimental design and treatments. Cows from the Control + ocytocine (OT) treatment were first milked to collect the standard milk. Then, they received an injection of 5 IU of OT, and the residual milk was collected through a second milking. Cows from the Atosiban (Ato) + OT treatment received an injection of Ato (50 µg/kg body weight); 10 minutes after this injection, they were milked to collect the cisternal milk. Then, they received an injection of 5 IU of OT, and the alveolar milk was collected through a second milking. For each group of cows, N = 2.
Results
Plasma OT Concentrations in the Control+OT Treatment
In the Control+OT treatment, standard milking induced a discharge of endogenous OT, detected as an increase in plasma OT concentration from 44.3 ± 68.85 pg/mL prior to the beginning of milking to 316.1 ± 66.77 pg/mL only 1 min after the attachment of the milking-unit ( P < 0.001, Fig. 2 ). The plasma OT concentration then remained stable until the end of milking (which lasted 08:29 min) and finally decreased after milking (time point 10 min). The area under the curve of OT concentration was 2,278 ± 711 pg/mL × 10 min. Fig. 2 Plasma oxytocin (OT) concentration in 8 Holstein dairy cows submitted to the Control + OT treatment. Cows were first milked to collect the standard milk. Then, they received an injection of 5 IU of OT, and the residual milk was collected through a second milking. Data were analyzed using the Mixed procedure in SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) with a repeated statement. Time was used as the repeated parameter, and Cow as the subject for repeated measures. The effect of type of milking, and of time (minutes after the milking-unit attachment) and the interaction of type of milk x time were tested. The basal concentration of OT was used as a covariate. Data are presented as the means ± SEM
The injection of 5 IU of OT induced an even greater increase in plasma OT concentration: the plasma OT concentration reached 491.1 ± 66.77 pg/mL 4 min after the injection. The concentration then gradually decreased until the end of milking but did not return to the basal concentration 12 min after the OT injection (time point 25 min; P < 0.001).
Milking Duration, Milk Yield and Composition
The volume of milk collected varied greatly among milk types ( P < 0.001, Table 1 ). During the Control+OT treatment, milk yield after the standard milking averaged 22.9 ± 0.69 kg, while the volume of residual milk collected after the OT injection measured only 3.0 ± 0.69 kg, i.e., 8 times less than the standard milk yield. The standard milking lasted an average of 08:29 min, whereas the milking after OT injection lasted an average of 02:49 min. During the Ato + OT treatment, the volumes of the cisternal and alveolar milk were 5.9 ± 0.69 kg and 13.3 ± 0.69 kg, respectively, which represented 26 and 58% of the standard milk yield. The milking after Ato injection lasted an average of 04:01 min, whereas the milking after OT injection lasted an average of 05:54 min.

Then, they received an injection of 5 IU of OT, and the alveolar milk was collected through a second milking 3 The method used to determine milk fat composition (mid-infrared spectrometry) is accurate for milk with a fat content between 20 and 56 g/kg. Data for fat content of residual milk were out of range and therefore only indicative
The composition of milk also varied greatly according to the type of milk ( P < 0.001, Table 1 ). The cisternal milk had a lower fat content and greater protein content than the other types of milk, while the residual milk had the greatest fat content, the lowest protein content and the lowest lactose content ( P < 0.001). The lower protein content of the residual milk compared with the standard milk was due to lower casein and whey protein contents. In contrast, the greater protein content of the cisternal milk compared with the standard milk was due to greater casein and whey protein contents. The whey protein content was greater in the alveolar milk than in the standard milk. The concentrations of somatic cells (SCC) in standard, residual, cisternal, and alveolar milk averaged 40, 398, 50, and 32 × 10 3 cells/mL, respectively, showing that the residual milk also had the greatest SCC ( P < 0.001).
Mammary Epithelial Cell Exfoliation
The concentration and number of MEC differed among milk types ( P < 0.05, Table 2 ). During the Control+OT treatment, the number of MEC exfoliated into the standard milk averaged 100.0 × 10 6 cells. The residual milk (obtained after the OT injection) contained a lower number of MEC representing 39.8 × 10 6 but, owing to its small volume, exhibited a 4-fold increase in MEC concentration compared with standard milk ( P < 0.05, Table 2 ). Moreover, the percentage of MEC among total cells in residual milk was lower than in standard milk ( P < 0.001, Table 2 ). During the Ato + OT treatment, the cisternal milk had a similar concentration of MEC but a lower number of MEC compared with the standard milk (25.1 vs. 100.0 × 10 6 MEC, P < 0.01). The number of MEC exfoliated into the cisternal milk represented 28% of the number of MEC exfoliated during standard milking. The number of MEC exfoliated into the alveolar milk after the OT injection was 50 × 10 6 cells, which represented 55% of the number of MEC exfoliated during standard milking.

Then, they received an injection of 5 IU of OT, and the alveolar milk was collected through a second milking
The percentage of exfoliated MEC that were apoptotic averaged 32.6 ± 3.1% in standard milk, which did not significantly differ from the percentages in the cisternal and the alveolar milk (Table 2 ). The residual milk contained a lower percentage of apoptotic MEC than the standard or alveolar milk ( P < 0.01).
Concentration of Plasma Lactose
During the standard milking in the Control+OT treatment, plasma lactose concentration increased between the 4th and the 6th minute of milking ( P < 0.001) and remained stable until the end of milking (Fig. 3 ). During the first milking in the Ato + OT treatment, plasma lactose concentration did not increase ( P > 0.10) and was, on average, lower than during the standard milking (26.3 vs. 30.6 mg/L, P < 0.001, Fig. 3 ). In both treatments, the plasma lactose concentrations of the cows were greater during milkings after OT injections than during the first milkings (on average 35.1 vs 30.6 mg/L, P < 0.001, in the Control+OT treatment and 28.4 vs 26.3 mg/L, P < 0.01, in the Ato + OT treatment). The concentration of lactose in plasma following the OT injection was greater in the Control+OT treatment than in the Ato + OT treatment ( P < 0.05, Fig. 3 ). Fig. 3 Lactose concentration in plasma of 8 Holstein dairy cows submitted to the Control + Oxytocin (OT) treatment (■) or the Atosiban (Ato) + OT treatment (□) during 2 consecutive milkings . Cows from the Control+OT treatment were first milked to collect the standard milk. Then, they received an injection of 5 IU of OT, and the residual milk was collected through a second milking. Cows from the Ato + OT treatment received an injection of Ato (50 μg/kg body weight); 10 min after this injection, they were milked to collect the cisternal milk. Then, they received an injection of 5 IU of OT, and the alveolar milk was collected through a second milking. Data were analyzed using the Mixed procedure in SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) with a repeated statement. Time was used as the repeated parameter, and Cow as the subject for repeated measures.

Discussion
Oxytocin, through its well-known effect of inducing myoepithelial cell contraction and therefore milk ejection, is a key hormone in nursing and in regulating milk production. Indeed, poor removal of milk from the mammary gland reduces milk synthesis as a result of local inhibition [ ]. This hormone allows the complete removal of the alveolar milk [ , ], which is then directly available to the offspring or the milking machine. Administering Ato, an antagonist of OT receptors, inhibited this milk ejection reflex by inhibiting the contraction of the myoepithelial cells in rats [ ] and dairy ruminants [ , ]. In the present study, the Control+OT and the Ato + OT treatments allowed us to collect 4 different types of milk: the standard, the residual, the cisternal and the alveolar milk. The residual milk (i.e., collected following OT injection after the standard milking) was more concentrated in fat than standard milk as previously described [ , ]. This could be a result of the myoepithelial cell contraction induced by OT, which stimulates the secretion of the lipid droplets into the alveolar lumen [ ] and is also responsible for the active transfer of fat from the alveolar compartment to the cistern. The cisternal milk (i.e., collected without any contraction of the myoepithelial cells after the Ato injection) was similar, in terms of yield (26% of the standard milk yield) and fat content, to cisternal milk previously described [ , ]. Finally, the alveolar milk (i.e., collected after the OT injection in the Ato + OT treatment) had a higher concentration of fat than the cisternal milk and represented a yield 58% as high as the yield of standard milk. In the Ato + OT treatment, the total yield of milk collected (cisternal milk + alveolar milk) was only 84% as high as the yield of milk collected during the standard milking. This could be because at the time of the OT injection, Ato was not completely eliminated from the blood since the half-life of Ato is 18 min [ ]. Thus, even if we used a supraphysiological dose of OT, Ato bound to OT receptors could have limited the binding of the exogenous OT to this same receptor, not allowing 100% recovery of the standard milk yield.
Treatments had an effect on both the number and the proportion of immune cells and MEC in milk. Residual milk presented a higher SCC than the other types of milk, in agreement with previous studies [ , ]. The higher SCC in the residual milk might be explained by an influx of immune cells at the end of the milking, which has already been observed in cows [ , ], or by the fact that somatic cells trapped in the alveolar lumen could be ejected at the end of milking together with fat globules, which have hydrophobic properties [ ]. Besides immune cells, milk somatic cells also comprise MEC. In the present study, the number of MEC exfoliated during a standard milking was consistent with our previous observation [ ]. In the Control+OT treatment, the OT injection dramatically increased the concentration of MEC in the residual milk. As a consequence, the number of MEC exfoliated into 3 kg of residual milk was nearly half the number of MEC exfoliated into 23 kg of standard milk. Therefore, the OT injection induced an exfoliation of MEC from the mammary epithelium similar than at milking. This stimulatory effect of OT on the exfoliation of MEC was also observed after the OT injection in the Ato + OT treatment, since the number of MEC exfoliated was greater in the alveolar milk than in the cisternal milk. In contrast, the inhibition of myoepithelial cell contraction by the Ato injection reduced the number of MEC exfoliated into cisternal milk compared with the other three types of milk. It should be noted, however, that during the Ato + OT treatment, the total number of MEC exfoliated represented only 83% of the number of MEC exfoliated during a standard milking. This is likely a result of the binding competition between OT and Ato at the OT receptor. All these findings suggest that OT participates in regulating the number of MEC exfoliated in milk during milking.
The majority of MEC exfoliated in milk consisted of viable cells, with an average of 33% apoptotic MEC in the standard milk. In comparison, the injection of a supraphysiological dose of OT after the standard milking decreased the percentage of apoptotic cells and thus increased the ratio of viable to apoptotic MEC in the residual milk. This suggests that more viable MEC can be exfoliated as a direct consequence of the intense mechanical forces imposed by the myoepithelial cell contraction caused by the injection of a supraphysiological dose of OT. We have previously investigated MEC exfoliation during milking in dairy cows [ ]. On the basis of our previous results, we suggested that MEC either may be continuously exfoliated between two milkings, trapped in the alveolar lumen and expelled during the ejection of the alveolar milk or may be mainly exfoliated during milking as a consequence of the OT-induced mechanical forces and the disruption of mammary epithelium integrity [ ]. The fact that more MEC and a greater percentage of viable MEC are exfoliated following the OT injection argues in favor of an OT-induced MEC exfoliation at milking and against the hypothesis of an accumulation of MEC in the alveolar milk fraction between milkings. Nevertheless, the number of MEC exfoliated in the cisternal milk (on average 25 million) when OT action was inhibited represented nearly 25% of the number of MEC exfoliated during a standard milking. This presence of MEC in the cisternal milk suggests that in addition to OT-induced MEC exfoliation, MEC might also be exfoliated between successive milkings. The two hypotheses concerning the mechanisms responsible for MEC exfoliation (continuous exfoliation and OT-induced exfoliation) are thus not mutually exclusive.
Variations in the MEC exfoliation rate were previously reported to be linked with mammary epithelium integrity modulation, since higher MEC exfoliation rates have been associated with disruption of the mammary epithelium [ ]. Such a disruption of mammary epithelium integrity due to the opening of tight junctions between MEC is indicated by the leakage of milk components into blood and vice versa. Thus, the presence of lactose in cow plasma is used as an indicator of mammary epithelium disruption [ , , ]. In the present study, in accordance with our previous observation [ ], the standard milking induced mammary epithelium disruption as indicated by the increase in plasma lactose concentrations during the course of the standard milking. The injection of a supraphysiological dose of OT after the standard milking induced a further increase in the lactose concentration in plasma, indicating an even greater disruption of the mammary epithelium integrity. This further disruption of the mammary epithelium could be responsible for the shedding of a greater number of viable MEC from the epithelium into residual milk. The OT injection in the Ato + OT treatment also induced an increase in the plasma lactose concentration, indicating mammary epithelium disruption. This effect is consistent with previous findings reporting that the injection of supraphysiological doses of exogenous OT compromises mammary epithelium integrity [ , ]. In contrast, the Ato injection prevented this mammary epithelium disruption, demonstrating that the milking-induced release of OT is responsible for the mammary epithelium disruption observed during milking. The less leaky tight junctions could have prevented MEC exfoliation, and thus could explain the lower number of MEC exfoliated in the cisternal milk. The disruption of mammary integrity at milking is transitory since blood lactose concentration returns to basal after milking [ ]. We earlier suggested that cortisol released at the end of milking could close the tight junction and limit the MEC exfoliation [ ]. Further studies could be performed in order to confirm the role of OT in regulating MEC exfoliation during milking or suckling in other species of ruminants or non-ruminants. The involvement of OT in inducing MEC exfoliation could be investigated using intravital imaging of lactating mammary gland. Masedunskas et al. [ ] have recently developed this approach in mice and demonstrated that OT stimulated the lipid droplet release into the alveolar lumen.
To conclude, this study showed that inhibiting myoepithelial cell contraction with an injection of the OT receptor antagonist Ato caused a decrease in the number of exfoliated MEC in milk. In contrast, injections of exogenous OT increased the number of MEC in milk. These results suggest that OT-induced myoepithelial cell contraction participated, at least in part, in the exfoliation of MEC into milk during the course of milking. This study also showed that OT is responsible for milking-induced mammary epithelium disruption. This disruption could reinforce the stimulatory effect of OT-induced myoepithelial contraction on the MEC exfoliation process.
Materials and Methods
All procedures applied to animals were approved by the local Ethics Committee on Animal Experimentation of Rennes (France) in compliance with French regulations (Decree No. 2001–464; May 29, 2001).
Animals and Experimental Procedures
Eight multiparous Holstein cows (lactation 2 to 5) that were in peak lactation (64 ± 6 days in milk) at the beginning of the experiment were used in this study. The cows were housed at the INRA experimental farm of Mejusseaume (UMR PEGASE, Le Rheu, France). During the entire experimental period, the cows were fed according to the INRA recommendations and milked twice a day at 0700 h and 1700 h. The cows were divided into 2 batches of 4 cows each according to their calving date so that we could study cows at the same stage of lactation. First, after local anesthesia of the skin by s.c. injection of 40 mg of Lidocaine (Vetoquinol, Lure, France), the cows were surgically equipped with permanent catheters (Silclear medical-grade silicone tubing, i.d. 1.02 mm, o.d. 2.16 mm; Degania Silicone, Degania Bet, Israel) inserted into the jugular vein. Catheters were inserted 4 days prior to the beginning of the trial and remained there for the duration of the study. The 4 cows of the first batch (2 cows in group 1 and two cows in group 2) were subjected to 2 treatments during two morning milkings one week apart, according to a crossover experimental design of 2 periods: 1) No injection followed by OT injection (= Control+OT treatment) and 2) Ato injection followed by OT injection (= Ato + OT treatment, Fig. 1 ). Five weeks later, the 4 cows of the second batch (2 cows in group 3 and two cows in group 4) were assigned to these 2 treatments according to the same experimental design. For the Control+OT treatment, cows were first milked to collect the milk as usual (= standard milk). Approximately 3 min after the end of this first milking, cows received an i.v. injection of OT (5 IU, Syntocinon®, Medac S.A.S., Lyon, France) in the jugular vein through the catheter. This dose is a supraphysiological dose [ ]. Three minutes after the OT injection, residual milk was collected through a second milking. For the Ato + OT treatment, cows received an i.v. injection of atosiban (50 μg/kg of body weight, Tractocile®, Ferring, Madrid, Spain) in the jugular vein. Ten minutes after the Ato injection, the cows were milked in order to collect the cisternal milk. Approximately 7 min after the end of this first milking, 5 IU of OT was injected in the jugular vein of each cow; 3 min after this injection, the alveolar milk was collected through a second milking. These two treatments allowed us to collect 4 different types of milk separately for each cow: standard followed by residual milk during the Control+OT treatment and cisternal followed by alveolar milk during the Ato + OT treatment. The yield of each type of milk collected was recorded. Cow were milked with a 48 kPa vacuum pressure and a pulsation ratio of 60:40. The duration of each milking was also recorded for the two treatments.
Milk Composition Analysis
A sample of each type of milk (50 mL) was used for the determination of milk fat, and lactose content by mid-infrared spectrometry and SCC by flow cytometry (Mylab, Châteaugiron, France). This determination of fat content by –infrared spectometry is accurate for milk with a fat content between 20 and 56 g/kg. Total protein content was estimated from the total Nitrogen (N, Kjeldahl) and non-casein N (soluble at pH 4.6 in the presence of 10% acetic acid and 1 M sodium acetate) contents analysed in milk samples collected from each type of milk. Casein contents were estimated as the total Nitrogen minus soluble N at an acid pH relative to total N and whey protein as non-casein N minus non-protein N.
Purification of Milk Mammary Epithelial Cells
To determine the concentration, the number and the viability of MEC in each type of milk collected, MEC were purified from fresh milk (1.8 kg each of standard, cisternal and alveolar milk and 0.9 kg of residual milk) using an immunomagnetic method as described by Herve et al. [ ]. The proportion of apoptotic MEC was measured by flow cytometry after staining with the Annexin V/Dead Cell Apoptosis Kit (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and as previously described [ ].
Blood Sampling and Oxytocin and Lactose Assays
On the days of treatment, blood samples were collected before, during and after milking at −5 -2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 23, and 25 min relative to the first attachment of the milking-unit. Monovette syringes coated with sodium heparin (Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany) were used to collect samples for the measurement of plasma OT and lactose concentrations. The plasma was separated by centrifugation at 2264× g for 15 min at 4 °C and stored at −20 °C until analyses were performed.
Plasma OT concentration was measured using the ELISA method described by Marnet et al. [ ]. The detection limit was 48.5 pg/mL, the intra-assay coefficient of variation was 1.9%, and the inter-assay coefficient of variation was 3.5%. Because of a cross-reaction between Ato and OT, the results of OT assays in plasma samples of Ato-treated cows could not be used. Plasma concentrations of lactose were measured using a multiparameter analyzer (Kone Instrument Corporation, Espoo, Finland) and a kit for the detection of lactose/d-galactose (Roche Diagnostics, Meylan, France).
Calculations and Statistical Analyses
The number of MEC exfoliated into each type of milk was determined by multiplying the milk MEC concentration measured in each type of milk by the yield of each type of milk. To describe the OT release during standard milking in cows receiving the Control+OT treatment, we calculated the area under the curve of OT concentration from the beginning of milking to 10 min after the beginning of milking after subtracting the basal concentrations of OT. Milk yield and composition data were analyzed using the general linear model procedures in the Windows statistical software Epsilow (L. Delaby, INRA, UMR PEGASE, Saint-Gilles, France) according to the following statistical model: $$ {\mathrm{Y}}_{\mathrm{i}\mathrm{jkl}}=\upmu +\mathrm{Cow}{\left({\mathrm{Batch}}_{\mathrm{j}}\right)}_{\mathrm{i}}+{\mathrm{Batch}}_{\mathrm{j}}+\mathrm{Period}{\left({\mathrm{Batch}}_{\mathrm{j}}\right)}_{\mathrm{k}}\kern0.5em +\mathrm{Type}\ {\mathrm{of}\ \mathrm{milk}}_{\mathrm{l}}+{\mathrm{e}}_{\mathrm{i}\mathrm{jkl}} $$ with Cow within the Batch j , Batch, Period within the Batch j and Type of milk (milking, residual, cisternal or alveolar milk) as fixed effects. The results were expressed as least squares means ± SEM.
Plasma OT and lactose concentration data were analyzed using the Mixed procedure in SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) with a repeated statement using the basal concentration (calculated as the average concentration at 5 and 2 min before the onset of milking) as a covariate. Time was used as the repeated parameter, and Cow as the subject for repeated measures. The effects of type of milk, and of time (minutes after milking-unit attachment) and interaction of type of milk x time were tested. For all variables, differences were considered statistically significant when P ≤ 0.05 and a tendency when 0.05 < P ≤ 0.10.
