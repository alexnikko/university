Introduction
Statins are effective, well-tolerated medicines with a good safety profile [ , , , , , , ], and widely used in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). During the period of 2011 to 2012, 23.2% of people 40 years of age or older reported using a statin (a 42% increase from 2003 to 2004 [16.3%]) [ ]. The focus on cardiovascular risk assessment to guide initiation of statins, rather than specific targets of “normal” cholesterol in the most recent practice guidelines for use of statins in primary and secondary prevention, has expanded the scale and scope of statin treatment [ , ].
The most common side effect of statins is myalgia without biochemical evidence of muscle damage, which is generally reversible with stopping the drug. However, it is a common reason for low medication compliance [ ]. A portion of patients with statin-induced myalgia develops myopathy, which is defined as myalgia with mild elevation of creatinine kinase (CK) < 10× upper limited of normal (ULN). In addition, rhabdomyolysis, a rare but serious form of myopathy, defined as CK > 10× ULN, can lead to potentially fatal complications caused by skeletal muscle breakdown (Table 1 ) [ ]. Statin-induced myopathy (SIM) is associated with all statins (class effect) [ ] and treatment consists of cessation of statin therapy [ , , ]. However, low statin compliance can increase the risk of CVD [ ]. Carefully limiting side effects while maximizing benefits is therefore difficult but important to improve treatment outcomes and safety. Table 1 Key definitions for outcomes (phenotypes) (ULN upper limit of normal; CK creatine kinase) Clinical outcomes Definitions Mild to moderate myopathy - Muscle symptoms with/without CK elevation and - CK elevation <10× ULN Rhabdomyolysis (severe myopathy) - Muscle symptoms with CK ≥ 10× ULN with or without evidence of renal impairment Non-clinical outcome Definition Medication discontinuation Discontinuation of statin due to statin intolerance
Incidence estimates for SIM vary, especially between clinical trials (1.5–5% [ ] and routine practice (0.3–33%) [ , ], and depend on the medication and dose [ ]. Patients considered at high risk for statin toxicity are generally excluded from clinical trials, often resulting in underestimating the true rate of SIM in an unselected patient population [ , ]. Rhabdomyolysis is also rare in clinical trials (3–7 cases per 100,000 person-years [ ]), as well as in reports in the US FDA Adverse Event Reporting System database (AERS) (0.3–13.5 cases per 1,000,000 statin prescriptions) [ , ]. Healthcare providers’ reluctance to initiate and maintain statin therapy due to side effects appears to be one reason why only 50% of people who could benefit from statins actually receive therapy [ , , , ].
Many studies have assessed SIM as well as its risk factors, such as genetic predisposition, high-dose statin treatment, advanced age, hypothyroidism, hepatobiliary disease, renal disease, small body frame and frailty, and the concomitant administration of drugs that interfere with statin metabolism [ , , , ]. However, most studies tend to focus on only one or a few risk factors, and the degree of completeness and methods with which meta-analyses summarize them vary. While many papers with clinically useful information on risk factors associated with SIM exist, the current body of literature has two major gaps. First, there are no recent, comprehensive reviews of risk factors for SIM. Second, most of the existing reviews do not provide a formal meta-analysis that can support quantitative and objective clinical decision-making. Therefore, the objective of this study was to perform a comprehensive review and meta-analysis of known risk factors for statin-related myopathy and calculate aggregated odds ratios for each risk factor through a meta-analysis.
Methods
Our review proceeded through four phases (see Fig. 1 ), detailed below: (1) identification of the relevant primary literature; (2) abstract screening using inclusion and exclusion criteria; (3) detailed review and data extraction; and (4) synthesis and statistical analysis. Figure 1 illustrates the process and its main results. 1. Identification of the relevant primary literature: We searched MEDLINE via PubMed from inception to May 2016 for papers in English with the following search terms: statins (including all generic and brand names), hydroxymethylglutaryl-coa reductase inhibitors, myopathy (ranging from myalgia to rhabdomyolysis), and “risk” OR “risk factors”. (The complete search strategy is included in the supplemental materials.) The search was purposefully designed to be broad in order to maximize sensitivity. 2. Abstract screening using inclusion and exclusion criteria: Our initial search yielded 836 papers, of which we excluded 88 due to irrelevant titles and/or no abstracts. During abstract screening , we screened the remaining 748 papers by eliminating studies that met one or more of the following exclusion criteria: case reports, letters, reviews, commentaries, editorials, and meta-analyses animal/in vitro studies unrelated to statins language other than English did not address outcomes of interest, including risk factors, statin-induced myopathy, and statistical estimation results cerivastatin (and its brand names) since this statin was withdrawn from market Fig. 1 Study flow chart. * Exclusion criteria are as follows: case reports, letters, reviews, commentaries, editorials and meta-analyses; animal/in vitro studies; unrelated to statins; language other than English; did not address outcomes of interest, including risk factors, statin-induced; myopathy, and statistical estimation results; and cerivastatin (and its brand names) since this statin was withdrawn from market
Four investigators (KN, LL, DL, EW) screened all abstracts; each abstract was reviewed independently by two investigators. Investigators discussed discrepancies to reach consensus. This first level of screening yielded 72 papers for the subsequent full article screening .
Four investigators (KN, LL, TS, DL) performed full article screening . We only included papers that related one or more risk factors to one or more clinical outcomes of interest and expressed this relationship in statistical measures such as odds, hazard, or relative risk ratios. We excluded papers that lacked the study of SIM risk factors or statistical measurements. This screening eliminated 28 papers, for a final yield of 44 papers for data extraction. To capture the maximum number of risk factors, we included special patient populations, such as kidney transplant recipients, and treated the underlying conditions as risk factors for SIM. 3. Detailed review and data extraction: This phase was intended to extract data of interest from each paper formally and reliably. The data extracted from each paper were study type, patient population, duration of study or treatment, clinical endpoint, risk factor(s), statistical method(s), and risk factor estimate (a definition of each term is included in the supplemental materials). To standardize this data collection process, ten papers (from the original list of 72 papers) were chosen randomly for a pilot phase in which all four investigators (KN, LL, TS, DL) reviewed each paper and extracted data. We chose 10 articles from the list of 72 (instead of 44) papers because the phases of full article screening and data extraction overlapped. During the pilot phase, the investigators walked through all papers together in order to increase inter-rater reliability and common understanding of the data to be collected. After the pilot phase, pairs of investigators independently reviewed and extracted data from each of the remaining articles. The extracted data were then reviewed by all four investigators until consensus was reached. Statin-induced myopathy has no clear, unambiguous definition [ , , ] and its standardization as a clinical phenomenon appears to be only in its infancy [ , ]. We therefore classified clinical outcomes into two categories, myopathy and rhabdomyolysis as defined in Table 1 . This classification is adapted from Alfirevic et al.’s standardization for statin-induced myotoxicity [ ]. A third, non-clinical outcome was medication discontinuation due to statin intolerance because of its acknowledged significance in practice (often related to myalgia) [ , , ]. This general classification was intended to focus on aspects of statin treatment relevant, important, and actionable for clinicians. 4. Synthesis and statistical analysis: Data extracted from the papers were then synthesized and analyzed. We summarized the average effect of statins on efficacy and adverse drug reactions (i.e., the intercept term in the regression model) from randomized clinical trials in the existing meta-analysis literature [ , , , , ], and prospective and retrospective studies, respectively. For both prospective and retrospective studies, we normalized the duration of statin drug exposure such that the risk estimates were comparable across different studies. We transformed individual test statistics (ORs and HRs), as well as their 95% CIs, into IRRs using established methodology [ , ]. After transformation, we pooled and analyzed IRRs using the DerSimonian-Laird random effect model, which anchors studies as a sample of all potential studies and incorporates an additional between-study component into the estimate of variability.

General characteristics of papers
Table 2 shows general information about the 44 papers we analyzed (references are included in supplemental document). The 44 studies included six clinical trials; five and 29 prospective and retrospective cohort studies, respectively; three surveys (cross-sectional, continuous; Internet-based, self-administered; and observational telephone, respectively); and one Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS). Most studies ( n = 23) focused on myopathy exclusively, nine on rhabdomyolysis exclusively, one on discontinuation, ten on both myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, and one on all three outcomes. Three studies examined discontinuation, mostly combined with clinical outcomes. Sample size ranged from 142 to 1,116,805. This vast range of sample sizes is related to the diversity of study types. While some retrospective cohort studies only collected data from hundreds of patients, a study using insurance claims collected data from millions.

The studies collectively described 17 different potential risk factors, which we classified into three categories: three demographic factors (11 papers), ten clinical factors (31 papers), and five pharmacogenetics/biomarkers (12 papers). (Some papers studied more than one risk factor.)
Risk factors
Demographics
Table 3 presents detailed results for demographic factors. Both age (at least 65 years old) and female gender can increase the odds of myopathy (OR 1.09, CI 1.07–1.10 and OR 1.95, CI 1.46–2.60, respectively). However, for rhabdomyolysis, an age of at least 65 years appears to be a risk factor (OR 1.33, CI 1.17–1.50) while being female is not (OR 0.73, CI 0.72–0.73). This result also indicates that being male is a risk factor for rhabdomyolysis. Our review found no studies for myopathy or rhabdomyolysis outcomes related to body mass index and race.

Clinical factors
We categorized clinical risk factors for SIM into comorbidities, dose effects, drug-drug interactions, statin treatment duration, and baseline effect (see Table 4 ). Detailed results for the first three categories are presented in Table 4 , while those for statin treatment duration and baseline effects are included in the supplemental materials. Table 4 Clinical risk factors for statin-induced myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, as well as statin discontinuation; DDI drug-drug interaction; Interaction drugs are as follows: clarithromycin, erythromycin, cyclosporine, mibefradil, verapamil, diltiazem, nefazodone, itroconazole, fibrates, gemfibrozil, amiodarone, and protease inhibitors; SCr serum creatinine; OR odds ratio; Chronic disease score, a risk-adjustment metric based on age, gender, and history of dispensed drugs Outcome Risk factor Control OR Confidence interval Number of Publications Positive # Negative # Total Myopathy Comorbidity Diabetes mellitus 2.34 (2.06, 2.64) 1 5 1 10 2 Renal impairment (elevated SCr) 1.45 (1.09, 1.92) 1 5 0 1 Cardiovascular disease 6.62 (1.77, 24.77) 1 10 0 1 Dose effect Simvastatin 80 mg 40 mg 2.70 (1.08, 6.75) 1 43 0 1 Simvastatin 40 mg 20 mg 1.66 (0.19, 1.85) 0 1 43 1 DDI Statin + interacting drugs Statin 2.20 (0.97, 4.98) 3 5,22,28 3 22,36,44 6 Simvastatin + interacting drugs Simvastatin 1.92 (1.00, 3.68) 0 1 23 1 Lovastatin + niacin ER Lovastatin 0.03 (0.0006, 1.50) 0 1 37 1 Rhabdomyolysis Comorbidity Diabetes mellitus 1.96 (1.79, 2.15) 5 5,6,14,17,43 0 5 Renal impairment (elevated SCr) 2.37 (2.37, 2.38) 0 2 5,43 2 Cardiovascular disease 0.80 (0.51, 1.25) 0 1 43 1 Chronic disease score 1.05 (0.98, 1.13) 1 43 0 1 Hypertension 4.50 (1.40, 14.70) 1 6 0 1 Hypothyroidism 1.53 (0.97, 2.41) 0 1 43 1 Gout 0.69 (0.37, 1.28) 0 1 43 1 Prior elevated CK CK > 200 IU/ml 21.63 (7.43, 62.94) 1 43 0 1 Dose effect Simvastatin 20–80 mg < 20 mg 1.00 (0.67, 1.67) 1 43 0 1 Simvastatin > 80 mg < 20 mg 3.80 (2.33, 6.20) 1 43 0 1 Simvastatin 40 mg 20 mg 5.30 (1.88, 14,88) 1 4 0 1 Drug-drug interactions Statin + interacting drugs Statin 4.00 (3.55, 4.50) 9 1,5,6,14,17, 22,32,43,44 1 22 10 Simvastatin + interacting drugs Simvastatin 24.00 (13.59, 42.38) 3 14,23,35 0 3 Pravastatin + interacting drugs Pravastatin 0.77 (0.54, 1.11) 1 35 0 1 Atorvastatin + fenofibrate Atorvastatin 0.03 (0.02, 0.03) 0 1 14 1 Discontinuation Comorbidity Cardiovascular disease 0.82 (0.82, 0.83) 0 1 26 1 DDI Statin + interacting drugs Statin 1.28 (1.02, 1.61) 1 21 0 1 Statin + OATP1B1/P-gp Statin 1.80 (1.06, 3.05) 1 21 0 1 Numbers in superscript refer to papers listed in Table 2 . # Positive/negative, studies that showed a statistically significant/non-significant association between a risk factor and a clinical outcome
Myopathy
Only diabetes mellitus, renal impairment, and cardiovascular disease were comorbidities that had data available for SIM. All three conditions are risk factors (OR 2.34, CI 2.06–2.64; OR 1.45, CI 1.09–1.92; OR 6.62, CI 1.77–24.77, respectively). However, for both renal impairment and cardiovascular disease, only a single study was available, and we thus consider these conditions probable risk factors. Simvastatin at the highest dose (80 mg) was a risk factor when compared with the 40 mg dose (OR 2.70, CI 1.08–6.75). However, myopathy risk at 40 mg was not statistically significant compared to the lowest dose (20 mg) (OR 1.67, CI 0.19–1.85). Last, we categorized drug-drug interactions into drug interactions with all statins (including simvastatin) and drug interactions with simvastatin only. Drug interactions with simvastatin proved to be a probable risk factor for myopathy (OR 1.92, CI 1.00–3.68) since only one study investigated this factor. For drug interactions with all statins, our study showed that the odds of myopathy was similar to simvastatin when taking any statin with interacting drug(s) compared to taking statin alone. However, this was not statistically significant (OR 2.20, CI 0.97–4.98). Interacting drugs included in our study were clarithromycin, erythromycin, cyclosporine, mibefradil, verapamil, diltiazem, nefazodone, itraconazole, fibrates, gemfibrozil, amiodarone, and protease inhibitors.
Rhabdomyolysis
Comorbidities that could potentially put patients at risk for rhabdomyolysis included diabetes, renal impairment, cardiovascular disease, chronic disease score, gout, and prior elevated CK. Of these, diabetes mellitus (OR 1.96, CI 1.79–2.15), renal impairment (OR 2.37, CI 2.38–2.38), and prior elevated CK (OR 21.63, CI 7.43–62.94) appeared to be risk factors. For dosage effects, simvastatin at doses ≥ 80 mg had a higher risk of rhabdomyolysis compared to simvastatin < 20 mg (OR 3.80, CI 2.33–6.20). Simvastatin at 40 mg also has a higher risk of rhabdomyolysis compared to 20 mg (OR 5.30, CI 1.88–14.88). Similar to the myopathy outcome, dosage effect was only examined by single studies for each risk factor; thus, all of these are considered potential risk factors. Finally, interacting drugs were a risk factor when used concomitantly with all type of statins or with simvastatin alone (OR 4, CI 3.55–4.50 and OR 24, CI 13.59–42.38, respectively).
Pharmacogenetics/biomarkers
For myopathy, SLCO1B1 mutation is a risk factor, specifically with regard to two alleles: rs2306283 (OR 2.08, CI 0.54–8.03) and rs4343657 (OR 6.68, CI 2.44–18.24). GATM mutation, however, as evaluated in two studies [ , ], is a protective factor (OR 0.78, CI 0.76–0.80). Low CoQ10 level (either defined as < 100 units or < 200 units) is categorized as probable risk factor since only one study evaluated the relationship in our finding. The risk of myopathy was not higher for low CoQ10 levels when comparing < 100 units with ≥ 100 units, or < 200 units with ≥ 200 units (OR 2.30, CI 0.83–6.36; OR 1.56, CI 0.57–4.24, respectively). In one study by Shantha et al., a vitamin D level lower than 30 ng/ml was a risk factor for myopathy when taking either statin, simvastatin, or atorvastatin [ ].
For rhabdomyolysis, only SLCO1B1 rs4149056 was a risk factor (OR 3.42, CI 2.34–5.00). In one study with EYS genes [ ], the three alleles rs3857532 (OR 1.87, CI 1.87–1.87), rs9342288 (OR 1.81, CI 1.81–1.81), and rs1337512 (OR 1.81, CI 1.81–1.81) were risk factors. We did not find studies related to rhabdomyolysis for coQ10 and vitamin D (Table 5 ).

Discussion
We examined three categories of risk factors—demographic, clinical, and pharmacogenetics/biomarkers—in relation to three clinically important outcomes: myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, and discontinuation. Of the 44 papers reviewed, only 3 papers reported discontinuation outcomes on 3 potential risk factors. Therefore, we could not provide a comprehensive review for the discontinuation outcome.
Our analysis indicates that the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis is higher in patients who are at least 65 years old compared to younger patients. A prior meta-analysis conducted by Iwere and Hewitt suggested that the risk of myopathy (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.91–1.18) and rhabdomyolysis (OR 2.93, 95% CI 0.30–28.18) was not significantly different between the same age groups, regardless of whether they were exposed to statin monotherapy or a placebo [ ]. Our findings thus suggest that statin monotherapy alone might not affect myopathy risk, but that the risk might increase in patients at least 65 years old.
Chronic conditions, such as diabetes, renal impairment, and cardiovascular disease, appeared to be associated with increased risk for SIM. While the pathophysiologic mechanisms for increased SIM risk among diabetic and renally impaired patients have not been fully elucidated, a decrease in statin metabolism and excretion due to renal/hepatic impairments may be a potential cause. However, diabetes and established cardiovascular disease, in particular, are the disease states in which treatment with statin provides the greatest absolute benefit and reduction in cardiovascular events. In addition, patients with diabetes or established cardiovascular disease are more likely to be prescribed more intensive treatment at higher statin doses than common for primary prevention. Interestingly, none of six papers that studied diabetes as a risk factor clearly defined whether they included type 1 diabetes (DM1) or type 2 diabetes (DM2). Since study participants took oral antidiabetic agents such as fenofibrate, niacin, and metformin, we inferred that they were treated for DM2. (DM1 patients receive only insulin replacement therapy for treatment.) We recommend that future studies on diabetes as a risk factor clearly define whether they focus on DM1, DM2, or both. Our study could not clearly determine if gout as an independent risk factor for myopathy was due to drug-drug interactions, or adverse effects of medications used in treatment of gout.
Genetic risk factors for SIM have received increasing attention in the literature. Genes reviewed in this study included SLCO1B1, GATM, and EYES. The SLCO1B1 gene influences the OATP1B1 hepatic transporter, thus affecting the bioavailability of statin, especially simvastatin [ ]. GATM gene encodes the glycine amidinotransferase enzyme, which is important for creatine synthesis, a waste product of muscle action [ ]. Finally, EYS is eyes shut homolog that encodes protein products that can alter neuromuscular tissue [ ]. The exact mechanism of how the EYS gene potentially affects SIM is currently unknown. Our results on SLCO1B1 are consistent with those of Hou et al. [ ], which indicate SLCO1B1 as the only significant genetic risk factor for SIM [ , , ]. Current Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) [ ] guidelines also provide clinical recommendations for testing of SLCO1B1 gene variants in patients being prescribed simvastatin, but not other statins. Other genes and biomarkers such as GATM, EYES vitamin D, and CoQ10 enzyme require more study to provide enough evidence for meaningful conclusion.
This comprehensive review of risk factors for SIM is intended to help healthcare providers evaluate and manage SIM risk for their patients using a thorough understanding of risk factors. Odds ratios for SIM due to demographic, clinical, and genetic risk factors can help healthcare providers with more complete information to assess the risk/benefit balance of statin therapy. In addition, providers can use this information to educate patients about their risks, potentially reducing statin non-adherence, and thus improving both treatment outcome and safety.
Limitations
Our study has several limitations. First, we only searched for studies available in MEDLINE that were written in English. Second, there are several risk factors for which we were not able to provide conclusive findings due to differences in analytical methods. These include statin therapy duration, baseline effect (the effect of taking statin versus placebo), and body mass index. Information related to these three potential risk factors is included in the supplemental materials. Third, only a limited number of randomized controlled clinical trials focused on risk factors for SIM (only 6 out of 44 articles evaluated). However, it can be argued that cohort studies (prospective or retrospective) are better at detecting risk factors in the general population than randomized controlled clinical trials due to the representative nature of the study population. Fourth, while we intended to evaluate risk factors for statin-induced discontinuation, we could not arrive at conclusive results due to the limited number of papers available. Additional studies on these outcomes are important to help providers identify factors that can impact medication adherence. Finally, we did not calculate the degree of heterogeneity of the studies but treated all of them equally. This approach could mask potential publication bias.
Future directions
Our comprehensive review and meta-analysis of risk factors can guide further studies intended to define risk for statin-induced rhabdomyolysis in various patient subpopulations and possible risk/benefit calculations, as well as determine implications for pharmacogenetics. New analytical methods that combine information from reviews and meta-analyses such as this one with—now fairly ubiquitous—electronic health record (EHR) data can help estimate benefit, harm, and cost of drug therapy with population-wide, data-based assessments, instead of relying on the sum of individual clinicians’ decisions.
Conclusion
Statins are effective drugs for the treatment and prevention of CVD. A deep understanding of risk factors related to statin-induced myopathy can help prescribers evaluate the relationship between benefit and risk of statin therapy. Individual risk factors that should be taken into consideration include age, gender, comorbidities, statin dose, drug-drug interactions, and genetic factors. Incorporation of statin-induced myopathy risk factors into risk-benefit assessments may influence decisions regarding initiation of statin treatment, choice of high- vs low-intensity statin treatment, and specific statins prescribed. Providers should discuss the risks and benefits of statin therapy with patients prior to statin initiation to improve patient knowledge and adherence. Last, computerized clinical decision support could help prescribers assess and evaluate risk factors when prescribing statins and may be an effective tool to improve patient outcomes and safety.
