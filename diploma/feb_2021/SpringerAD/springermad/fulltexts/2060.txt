Introduction
Ischemic stroke is a common disease with great danger for human health, accounting for 70–80% of cerebrovascular diseases. In order to restore the blood flow as soon as possible, thrombolysis is a major strategy in clinic to rescue the ischemic brain. In addition to the ischemia, blood perfusion also brings damage to brain, which is called “reperfusion injury” [ ]. Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury involves multiple mechanisms, including oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, energy metabolic disorders, calcium overload, and inflammation. No matter what mechanisms are involved, final destiny for the most of injured brain cells is death. Generally, cell death mainly includes apoptosis and necrosis, which are believed to be the major types of cell death in I/R-induced brain injury [ , ].
Apoptosis is a caspase-dependent programmed form of cell death. To date, two pathways of apoptosis are identified as follows: the intrinsic pathway, resulting from mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and subsequent activation of caspase-3, and the extrinsic pathway, resulting from the activation of cell surface death receptors, leading to the activation of caspase-8 and the subsequent caspase-3 [ ]. Thus, caspase-3 is the common executioner caspase for both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of apoptosis. It has been shown that activation of caspase-3 causes the increased mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, DNA fragmentation, chromatin condensation, and cell death [ ]. Numerous studies have reported that the caspases-8 and caspase-3 are activated during cerebral I/R accompanied by cellular apoptosis [ , , ]. Based on these reports, it is naturally to think that intervention of caspase-8 or caspase-3 can limit the cerebral I/R injury. In fact, lots of chemicals indeed show beneficial effects on cerebral I/R injury through suppression of caspase-8 and/or caspase-3 [ , , ]. However, no caspase inhibitor is available in clinic to treat cerebral I/R injury.
Emricasan, also known as IDN-6556 or PF-03491390, is an inhibitor of caspases and it is currently in clinical trials for several liver diseases [ ], including liver cirrhosis and fibrosis [ , ]. In addition to caspase-3 and caspase-9, emricasan is capable of inhibiting the caspase-8 homodimer or the caspase-8/cFLIPL heterodimer [ ]. Moreover, emricasan has been reported to prevent I/R injury during liver transplantation [ ]. Based on these reports, we hypothesize that emricasan could alleviate cerebral I/R-induced apoptosis through suppression of caspases.
Necrosis is another major type of cell death during cerebral I/R. Different from apoptosis, necrosis has long been recognized as an accidental and uncontrolled passive death manner. In fact, it can also be tightly regulated by several signal pathways, referring to regulated necrosis [ , ]. Among them, the RIPK1/RIPK3 (receptor-interacting protein kinase 1/3)-dependent necrosis, the so-called necroptosis [ ], is the most-well studied one. Necroptosis has been found in multiple ischemia-relevant diseases, such as stroke and myocardial infarction [ , , ]. Therefore, inhibition of RIPK1/RIPK3 could be an effective strategy to prevent cerebral cell death in ischemic stroke. Recent studies have found that ponatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, can specifically down-regulate RIPK1 and RIPK3 protein expressions [ ]. It is not known, however, whether ponatinib can exert protective effect on cerebral I/R injury.
In the present study, using a rat model of cerebral I/R, we are going to evaluate the effect of emricasan or ponatinib alone on cerebral I/R injury first. On this basis, we will explore the curative effect of combination therapy with emricasan and ponatinib on cerebral I/R injury and the underlying mechanisms.
Material and Methods
Animals
Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250–300 g (8~9 weeks old) were provided by the Laboratory Animal Center, Xiang-Ya School of Medicine, Central South University, China. Food was withheld from the animals for 24 h before the experiments, but they are free access to tap water. The study was conducted following the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication, 8th edition, 2011) and the ARRIVE guidelines (Animal Research: Reporting In Vivo Experiments). The experiments were approved by the Central South University Veterinary Medicine Animal Care and Use Committee.
Rat Model of Cerebral Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury
To establish the rat model of I/R injury, the rats were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) as we described previously [ ]. Briefly, the animals were anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate (300 mg/kg, i.p.). The right common carotid artery (CCA) was exposed and clipped with artery clamp. The external carotid artery (ECA) was isolated and ligatured. A nylon suture with a rounded tip (0.40-mm diameter) was inserted into internal carotid artery (ICA) through a tiny incision in ECA and gently advanced 18~20 mm past the carotid bifurcation until a slight resistance was felt. At this point, the nylon suture blocked the origin of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and occluded all sources of blood flow from ICA, anterior cerebral artery, and posterior cerebral artery. After the occlusion of MCA for 2 h, the nylon suture was removed for subsequent reperfusion for 12, 24, 36, or 48 h, respectively. The rats were put back to cages with free access to water and food after incision was sutured. Animals from the sham group were subjected to the same procedure as that in the I/R group except that the nylon suture was inserted into the ICA only 7 mm above the carotid bifurcation. It is worth to point out that there are two different types for the sham surgery of MCAO according to the literatures. In the first type, the CCA is occluded [ , , , ]; whereas in the second type, the CCA is not occluded [ , , , ]. Because we favor the first type for the sham surgery, thereby, the CCA is occluded in the sham-operated rats in the present study.
Experimental Protocols
To explore the effects of emricasan and/or ponatinib on cerebral I/R injury and the underlying mechanisms, a serial experiments were performed. The first set of experiments was designed to optimize the time points for reperfusion. The animals were randomly to divided into six groups ( n = 10 per group): (1) the control group, no surgery for rats; (2) the sham group, the rats underwent surgical procedures but without ischemic insult; and (3–6) the I/R group, the rats were subjected to 2 h of ischemia followed by 12, 24, 36, or 48 h of reperfusion. At the end of reperfusion, the neurological deficit score was assessed first, and then the brain tissues were collected for measurements of infarct volume and the expressions of active caspase-8, RIPK1, and RIPK3. Based on the results of time-course experiments, the condition of 2-h ischemia and 24-h reperfusion was chosen for the following studies.
The second set of experiments was designed to evaluate the preventive effect of emricasan or ponatinib on cerebral I/R injury. The animals were randomly allocated to five groups for emricasan or ponatinib ( n = 6 per group): (1) the control group; (2) the sham group; (3) the I/R group: the rats were subjected to 2-h ischemia plus 24-h reperfusion; (4) the emricasan or ponatinib group, the rats received emricasan (15 mg/kg, i.g. purity ≥ 98.0%, MedChem Express, USA) or ponatinib (20 mg/kg, i.g. purity ≥ 98.0%, Abmole Bioscience, China) at 15 min before the ischemia; and (5) the vehicle group, the rats received the equal volume of vehicle (carboxymethylcellulose sodium) for emricasan or ponatinib.
The third set of experiments was designed to evaluate the therapeutic effect of emricasan or ponatinib on cerebral I/R injury. The animals were randomly allocated to five groups ( n = 6 per group) for emricasan or ponatinib which was exactly same as that in the second set of experiments except the rats received emricasan or ponatinib at 1 h after the reperfusion.
The fourth set of experiments was designed to evaluate the combined therapeutic effects of emricasan with ponatinib on cerebral I/R injury. The experimental protocol was same as that in the third set of experiments except one more group, in which the rats received the combined treatment with emricasan and ponatinib at 1 h after the reperfusion.
At the end of reperfusion, the neurological deficit score was assessed first, and then the brain tissues were collected for measurements of infarct volume and others (the activities of caspase-8 and caspase-3; the protein levels of RIPK1, RIPK3, and mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL)).
Assessment of Neurological Deficit Score and Infarct Volume
At the end of reperfusion, the functional consequences of brain injury were assessed by an investigator blinded to the experimental groups according to a five-point neurological deficit score (0 = no deficit, 1 = failure to extend the left forepaw, 2 = decreased grip strength of left forepaw, 3 = circling to the left by pulling the tail, 4 = spontaneous circling) [ ].
The infarct volume was evaluated by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. After a neurological function evaluation, the rats were sacrificed under the condition of anesthesia. The brains were sliced into 2-mm thick coronal sections. After treating with 1% TTC for 15 min at 37 °C, the sections were incubated with 4% paraformaldehyde overnight and scanned into a computer. The images of brain sections with TTC-staining were analyzed with the imaging software (Image J, NIH, USA).The absence or presence of infarction was determined by examining TTC stain. The infarct volume (in mm 3 ) of each section was calculated as infarct area (in mm 2 ) multiplied by the section thickness (2 mm). The total infarct volume of each brain was equal to the summation of the infarct volumes of all sections. To eliminate the effect of edema on the accuracy of infarct volume assay, the final infarct volume was corrected by following equation: corrected infarct volume = total infarct volume × (left hemisphere volume / right hemisphere volume). Left hemisphere refers to no-ischemic hemisphere of brain while right hemisphere refers to ischemic contralateral side.
Determination of Protein Levels of Active Caspase-8, RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL
Brain tissues were homogenized in ice-cool lysis buffer, then sonicated for about 1 min, and centrifuged for at 15,000 × g 15 min. The protein concentration in homogenate was evaluated by a BCA protein assay kit (Beyotime, Hangzhou, China). Samples containing 30–40 μg of protein were loaded to 8 or 12% SDS-PAGE gel and then transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. Blots were incubated with primary antibodies against active caspase-8 (Novus Biologicals, CO, USA), RIPK1 (Boster, Wuhan, China), RIPK3 (Biovision, CA, USA), MLKL (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), or β-actin (Beyotime, Shanghai, China), followed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-coupled secondary antibodies (Beyotime, Shanghai, China). The signals of blots were observed by Luminata™ Crescendo Western HRP substrate (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) through the Molecular Imager ChemiDoc XRS System (Bio-Rad, Philadelphia, USA). The densitometric quantification was performed with ImageJ.
Measurement of Caspase-8 and Caspase-3 Activities
The measurements of caspase-8 and caspase-3 activities were conducted following the manufacturer’s instructions (Beyotime, Hangzhou, China). In brief, mixture of 10 μl of brain tissue (dissections of ischemic hemisphere) homogenates with 90 μl of reaction solution containing caspase-8 or caspase-3 substrate (Ac-IETD-pNA/Ac-DEVD-pNA) was incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. The absorbance was monitored at 405 nm. The enzyme activity was presented as U/g protein, and 1 U of enzyme was equal to the amount of enzyme required to cleave 1.0-nmol Ac-IETD-pNA/Ac-DEVD-pNA per hour at 37 °C.
Statistical Analysis
SPSS software (Version 20) was used for statistical analysis. Data were expressed as mean ± SEM. Differences in measured values among the multiple groups were analyzed by the analysis of variance with one-way ANOVA and Student-Newman-Keuls multiple comparison tests. The neurological deficit scores were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis H and Wilcoxon tests. Differences were considered as significant when P < 0.05.
Results
The Neurological Deficit Score and Cerebral Infarct Volume in Rats at Different Time Points of Reperfusion After Cerebral Ischemia
A 5-point rating scale of neurological deficit score is commonly used for assessment of neurological function in MCAO rat model. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the neurological deficit scores were significantly increased after the reperfusion for 12, 24, 36, or 48 h compared with that in the sham group, concomitant with an elevation in cerebral infarct volumes (Fig. 1 B and C). The neurological deficit score and cerebral infarct volume reached peak at 24 h and slightly went down at the time points from 36 to 48 h. There was no significant difference in neurological function and cerebral infarct volume between the sham and the control groups.

Expressions of Active Caspase-8, RIPK1 and RIPK3 in Rat Brains at Different Time Points of Reperfusion After Cerebral Ischemia
Caspase-8 acts as the most upstream caspase in apoptotic signaling pathway and the level of active caspase-8 (cleaved caspase-8) can reflect the status of apoptotic signaling pathway. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the protein levels of active caspase-8 (cleaved caspase-8) in the rats brains were dramatically increased after the reperfusion for 12, 24, 36, or 48 h compared with that in the sham group, approximately peaking at 24 h and lasting for 48 h. There was no obvious difference in the level of active caspase-8 between the sham and the control groups.

RIPK1 and RIPK3 are the key components of the signaling pathway involving in cellular necroptosis/programmed necrosis. As displayed in Fig. 2 B and C, the protein levels of RIPK1 and RIPK3 were remarkably elevated after the reperfusion for 12, 24, 36, or 48 h compared with that in the sham group, peaking at 24 h and lasting for 48 h. No significant differences in RIPK1 and RIPK3 levels were observed in the sham and the control groups.
Preventive Effect of Emricasan or Ponatinib on Cerebral I/R Injury in Rats
Based on the time-course experiments for cerebral I/R injury in rats, we chose the condition of 2-h ischemia and 24-h reperfusion for the following studies because under this condition both apoptosis and necroptosis were noticeable. To evaluate the preventive effect of emricasan or ponatinib on cerebral I/R injury, emricasan (15 mg/kg) or ponatinib (20 mg/kg) was given to rats at 15 min before the cerebral ischemia. As shown in Fig. 3 , there were no significant changes in the neurological deficit score and infarct volume in the sham group comparing to the control group. Cerebral I/R caused dramatic increases in neurological deficit score and infarct volume; these increases were attenuated by pretreatment with emricasan (A and B) or ponatinib (C and D), whereas the vehicle of emricasan or ponatinib did not show such effects.

Therapeutic Effect of Emricasan or Ponatinib on Cerebral I/R Injury in Rats
To evaluate the therapeutic effect of emricasan or ponatinib on cerebral I/R injury, emricasan (15 mg/kg) or ponatinib (20 mg/kg) was given to rats at 1 h after the cerebral reperfusion. As shown in Fig. 4 , the neurological deficit score and infarct volume were obviously decreased in the presence of emricasan (A and B) or ponatinib (C and D) compared to that in the I/R group, whereas the vehicle of emricasan or ponatinib has no such effects.

The Combined Therapeutic Effect of Emricasan with Ponatinib on Cerebral I/R Injury in Rats
To further evaluate the combined therapeutic effect of emricasan with ponatinib on cerebral I/R injury, both emricasan (15 mg/kg) and ponatinib (20 mg/kg) were given to rats at 1 h after the cerebral reperfusion. As displayed in Fig. 5 , consistent with the results before, emricasan or ponatinib alone could reduce the neurological deficit score and infarct volume in the I/R-treated rats; these effects were obviously enhanced upon the combined application of emricasan and ponatinib. Fig. 5 The combined therapeutic effects of emricasan with ponatinib on cerebral I/R injury in rats. a Neurological deficit score ( n = 12 per group). b Representative image of triphenyltetrazolium chloride-stained brain tissue from each group. c Infarct volume ( n = 6 per group).

Effects of Emricasan or/and Ponatinib on the Activities of Caspase-8 and Caspase-3
To evaluate the effects of emricasan or/and ponatinib on I/R-induced cellular apoptosis, the activities of caspase-8 and caspase-3 in the rat brains were measured. Compared with the sham group, there were significant increases in the caspase-3 and caspase-8 activities in the I/R-treated rat brains; these increases were obviously blocked in the presence of emricasan alone or together with ponatinib, whereas ponatinib alone did not affect the caspase-3 and caspase-8 activities (Fig. 6 ).

Effects of Emricasan or/and Ponatinib on Necroptosis-Relevant Protein Expression
RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL are the necroptosis-relevant proteins. Compared with sham group, the protein expressions of RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL in the rat brains were up-regulated in the I/R group, which were suppressed by ponatinib alone or combination with emricasan, whereas emricasan alone had no effect on the expressions of RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL (Fig. 7 ).

Discussion
In the present study, by using a rat model of cerebral I/R, we evaluated the preventive and therapeutic effects of single emricasan or ponatinib and their combined therapeutic effects on I/R injury. Our results showed that neurological deficit scores and infarct volume (including cellular apoptosis and necrosis) were significantly elevated in the I/R-treated rat brain, accompanied by the up-regulation of active caspase-8, RIPK1, and RIPK3; these phenomena were dramatically attenuated by single use of emricasan or ponatinib. Combination of emricasan with ponatinib could synergistically ameliorate cerebral I/R injury through suppressing both caspase-8/3 and RIPK1/3 pathways. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to extend the potential clinical indications for emricasan and ponatinib in treating cerebral I/R injury or ischemic stroke.
Apoptosis is a caspase-dependent programmed form of cell death and can be initiated through the intrinsic pathway or extrinsic pathway. There are two types of caspases: the initiator caspases (including caspase-2, -8, -9, -10, -11, and -12) and the effector caspases (including caspase-3, -6, and -7) [ ]. Caspase-3 is the common executioner for both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of apoptosis. The activated caspase-3 executes apoptosis by cleaving several proteins that are vital for the cell [ ]. Different from caspase-3, caspase-8 is a prototypical initiator caspase and it is essential for initiation of the death receptor-driven apoptosis [ , ], the so-called extrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Numerous studies have demonstrated that the extrinsic caspase-dependent pathway of apoptosis is involved in cerebral I/R injury. For example, caspase-8, the initiator caspase for extrinsic pathway of apoptosis, was up-regulated in the cortex of ischemic rats [ ]. Administration of Z-IETD-FMK, a caspase-8 inhibitor, can block the caspase-8-mediated activation of caspase-3 and reduce I/R-induced apoptosis in rat brain [ ]. Consistent with these reports, in the present study, we have found that the protein levels of active caspase-8 (cleaved caspase 8) in the rat brains were dramatically elevated after the reperfusion for 12, 24, 36, or 48 h, approximately peaking at 24 h and lasting for 48 h, which confirmed the initiation of extrinsic pathway of apoptosis in the I/R-treated rat brains.
Necrosis is another major manner of cell death in the I/R-treated rat brain, and it is considered to be a random, passive cell death without definable mediators for many years. Recently, multiple types of regulated necrosis, such as necroptosis, ferroptosis, pyroptosis, oxytosis, and cyclophilin D-mediated necrosis, were identified and reported [ , ]. Among them, necroptosis is the most understood type of regulated necrosis. Necroptosis, also named programmed necrosis, is triggered by a cascade of protein kinases, including RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL [ ]. Assembly of RIPK1 and RIPK3 through a series of RIPK1 and RIPK3 auto- and transphosphorylation events leads to the formation of necrosome complex, which is the important initiation step for necroptosis. Formation of the necrosome causes the recruitment of MLKL, creating a supramolecular protein complex at the plasma membrane and activating necroptosis [ , ]. Multiple studies have demonstrated that RIPK-mediated necrosis contributed to the cerebral I/R injury because inhibition of RIPK1 or RIPK3 was able to attenuate the cerebral I/R injury [ , , ]. In agreement with these reports, in this study, our results showed that the protein levels of RIPK1 and RIPK3 were remarkably elevated after the reperfusion for 12, 24, 36, or 48 h, peaking at 24 h and lasting for 48 h, which confirmed the activation of RIPK-dependent necrosis in the I/R-treated rat brains.
Since both apoptosis and necroptosis contribute to cerebral I/R injury, it is easy to accept that suppression of either apoptosis or necroptosis can reduce the cerebral I/R injury. Actually, many chemicals exert beneficial effects on cerebral I/R injury through block either caspase-dependent apoptosis or RIPK-dependent necroptosis [ , , ]. However, we did not find any drug which could protect the brain against I/R injury through directly targeting either caspases or RIPK1/RIPK3 in clinic. Recently, two drugs, named emricasan and ponatinib, have attracted our attention because the former is a novel inhibitor of caspases while the latter might be a new inhibitor of RIPK1 and/or RIPK3 [ , ]. More intriguing, emricasan is in the clinical trial to treat liver cirrhosis and fibrosis while ponatinib is clinically used for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) [ , ]. Since emricasan is able to block the activation of caspase-8 and inhibition of caspase-8 could ameliorate ischemic injury in rat brain [ , ], it is reasonable to speculate that emricasan may have clinical potentials in prevention of cerebral I/R injury through block of the caspase-dependent apoptosis; since ponatinib is able to down-regulate RIPK1 and RIPK3 protein expressions [ ], we thus hypothesize that ponatinib may have new clinical indications for treating cerebral I/R injury through block of RIPK-dependent necroptosis.
To test our hypothesis, in the present study, we first evaluated the preventive and therapeutic effects of single emricasan or ponatinib on I/R injury in the rat brain. The results showed that administration of emricasan or ponatinib either before or after the cerebral ischemia could decrease the neurological deficit score and infarct volume, confirmed the preventive and therapeutic effects on I/R injury for both emricasan and ponatinib. Next, we further evaluated the combined effect of emricasan with ponatinib on cerebral I/R injury. The results showed that combined application of emricasan and ponatinib could further decrease the neurological deficit score and infarct volume compared to single emricasan or ponatinib did. Finally, we examined effects of emricasan and/or ponatinib on the activities of capase-8/-3 and levels of necroptosis-relevant proteins: RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL. Our results showed that emricasan decreased the activities of capase-8/-3 in the I/R-treated brain but it did not affect the protein levels of RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL, whereas ponatinib suppressed the expressions of RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL but it did not affect the activities of capase-8/-3. When the combination of emricasan with ponatinib was applied, both activities of capase-8/-3 and levels of necroptosis-relevant proteins in the I/R-treated rat brains were suppressed. These results are consistent with our hypothesis before.
So far, emricasan is a novel caspase inhibitor in clinical trial for treating liver diseases and it is well tolerated in humans [ ]. Thus, emricasan might possess potentials to extend its clinical indications for ischemic stroke. As a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, ponatinib has been approved again by the FDA in 2016 for treatment of patients with chronic phase, accelerated phase, blast phase chronic myeloid leukemia [ ], etc. Actually, it was temporarily suspended sales in 2013 because of its severe side effects [ ]. However, the situation is different if ponatinib is applied to treat ischemic stroke because it requires only single or short-term treatment. The potential side effects triggered by ponatinib under such condition might differ from those described for long-term treatment for cancer.
In summary, in the present study, we have demonstrated for the first time that combination of emricasan with ponatinib could synergistically reduce I/R injury in rat brain through simultaneous prevention of apoptosis and necroptosis. Our study might lay a basis on extension of the clinical indications for emricasan and/or ponatinib in treating ischemic stroke.
