Introduction
Improvement in stent technology and antithrombotic therapy has further improved clinical outcome and extended the indication for percutanoues coronary intervention (PCI) in both stable angina and acute coronary syndromes. [ , , , , ]. The recommended duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after coronary interventions ranges from 4 weeks, after bare metal stent (BMS) implantation in elective patients, to 6 months, after drug eluting stent (DES) implantation and 12 months, after acute coronary syndrome (ACS) [ ]. A considerable percentage of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) also have indication to chronic oral anticoagulation (OAC) due to atrial fibrillation and CHADS2 score > 1, mechanical prosthetic heart valves, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism or other cause [ ]. In this particular setting, triple therapy with aspirin, ADP antagonists and anticoagulation seems to increase the risk of bleeding, whereas a temporary discontinuation of anticoagulants increases the risk of thromboembolism with consequent higher incidence of cerebrovascular accidents [ ]. On the other side an early DAPT discontinuation increases the risk of stent thrombosis, in particular after drug eluting stents implantation [ ]. Several studies in last years reported significant differences of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), ischemic stroke or bleedings in patients receiving different antithrombotic strategies, with conflicting results [ ]. To date controversy still exists about optimal antithrombotic management after coronary stenting in patients requiring long term OAT [ , ]. Therefore, the aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate risk and benefits of triple antihrombotic therapy (TT) versus dual antithrombotic therapy (DT) in patients undergoing coronary stent implantation, requiring long term OAT.
Methods
Eligibility and Search Strategy
We performed a formal search of PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane central register of controlled trials and major international scientific session abstracts from January 1990 to September 2015 regarding the use of TT versus DT in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary stent implantation that required OAC. Moreover oral presentations and/or expert slide presentations were included, searching on EuroPCR ( www.europcr.com ), ACC ( www.acc.org ), AHA ( www.aha.org ), and ESC ( www.escardio.org ) websites from January 2000 to September 2015. The following key words were used: “triple therapy”, “dual antiplatelet therapy”, “chronic oral anticoagulation”, “Clopidogrel”, “percutaneous stent implantation”, “antithrombotic strategies”, “cerebrovascular accident”, “bleedings”. We included both prospective and retrospective, single and multicenter trials, which assessed risk and benefits of a TT with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), Clopidogrel and Warfarin versus DT alone (warfarin associated with single antiplatelet therapy or dual antiplatelet therapy alone) in patients undergoing coronary stent implantation requiring long term OAC. Studies assessing TT with ASA, Clopidogrel and anticoagulation therapy different from Warfarin were excluded. We did not restrict eligibility according to the reason for long term OAC.
Data Extraction and Validity Assessment
Data were extracted by two investigators, with a good agreement (k statistic =0.88). Disagreements were resolved by consensus. Data were managed according to the intention-to-treat principle.
Outcome Measures
Primary end point was mortality. Secondary endpoints were: 1) myocardial infarction (MI); 2) Major bleedings (defined as per protocol definition; see Table 1 );3) stroke.

Data Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using the Review Manager 4.27 freeware package, SPSS 17 statistical package. Odds ratio (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI) were used as summary statistics. The pooled odds ratio was calculated by using a fixed effect model (The DerSimonian and Laird method). The Breslow-Day test was used to examine the statistical evidence of heterogeneity across the studies ( p < 0.1). Potential publication bias was examined by constructing a “funnel plot” in which sample size was plotted against odds ratios. The study quality was evaluated by two investigators according to a score, as previously described [ ], that was expressed on a ordinal scale, allocating 1 point for the presence of each of the following: 1) statement of objectives; 2) explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria; 3) description of intervention; 4) objective means of follow-up; 5) description of adverse events; 6) power analysis; 7) description of statistical methods; 8) multicenter design; 9) discussion of withdrawals; 10) details on medical therapy. A meta-regression analysis was carried out to evaluate the relationship between the benefits in mortality with TT group and the variation in bleeding complications (as log of the odds ratio for bleedings with TT versus DT). A pre-specified analysis was performed to compare TT versus DAPT or versus single antiplatelet therapy in association with oral anticoagulation. The study was performed in compliance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [ ].
Results
Eligible studies. Among 2847 potentially relevant citations, 61 articles were considered of interest and fully reviewed. Of these 45 studies were excluded because of use of 1) anticoagulation therapy different from Warfarin; 2) duplicate studies; 3) meta-analysis. Therefore a total of 16 trials [ , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ] were finally included (Fig. 1 ). Fig. 1 Flow diagram of the systematic overview process
Six [ , , , , , ] studies were retrospective, six [ , , , , , ] were prospective registries, two [ , ] were prospective, observational studies and two [ , ] were multicentre randomized trials. We analyzed a total of 21716 patients of which 6950 received TT versus 14766 patients receiving DT alone with a follow-up period ranging from 180 to 730 days. All studies enrolled patients undergoing coronary stent implantation. Clinical and demographic characteristics of included trials are shown in Tables 1 and 2 .

Mortality
Data regarding mortality were available in 21657 patients (99.7 %). All cause mortality was observed in 724 out of 6924 patients (10.4 %) patients in TT versus 2401 out of 14733 patients (16.3 %) in DT (OR [95 % CI] =0.73 [0.66–0.80], p <0.001; p het <0.001) (Fig. 2 ). As shown by the funnel plot of all studies included in the meta-analysis (Fig. 3 ), we did not observed a skewed distribution, suggesting no publication bias ( p = 0.23). By meta-regression analysis we found that benefits in mortality were significantly and inversely related to the risk of major bleedings observed with TT (beta [95 % CI] = 2.25 (1.55; 2.95), p < 0.00001) (Fig. 4 ). The benefits in mortality associated with TT were more pronounced when compared to DAPT (OR [95 % CI] =0.86 [0.77–0.97], p = 0.01) rather than to oral anticoagulation in addition to a single antiplatelet agent (OAC + SAA) (OR [95 % CI] =0.5 [0.42–0.6], p < 0.001) (p interaction < 0.001) (Fig. 2 ).

The size of the data markers (squares) is approximately proportional to the statistical weight of each trial Fig. 3 Funnel plot of all studies included in the meta-analysis.

Secondary Endpoints
Myocardial Infarction
Data regarding myocardial infarction were available in 17680 patients (81.4 %). Interestingly, the incidence of myocardial infarction was significantly higher in patients treated with DT (1159 out of 11765, 9.8 % versus 383 out of 5915, 6.4 %) (OR [95 % CI] = 0.74 [0.65–0.84], p < 0.001; p het < 0.001). However, significant benefits with TT were only observed when compared to oral anticoagulation in addition to a single antiplatelet agent (OAC + SAA) (OR [95 % CI] = 0.59 [0.5–0.69], p < 0.001) but not to DAPT (OR [95 % CI] = 1.05 [0.87–1.28], p = 0.61) (p interaction <0.001) (Fig. 5 ). Fig. 5 Triple therapy (TT) versus dual therapy (DT) on myocardial infarction (including the longest follow-up available) both in case of triple therapy versus dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) and triple therapy versus oral anticoagulation (OAC) in addition to a single antiplatelet agent (SAA) with odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals (CI). The size of the data markers (squares) is approximately proportional to the statistical weight of each trial
Stroke
Data regarding stroke were reported in 14 studies for a total of 17680 patients (80.2 %). We found a significant correlation between DT and an increased incidence of ischemic stroke (465 out of 11765, 3.9 % versus 111 out of 5915, 1.8 %) (OR [95 % CI] = 0.55 [0.45–0.68], p < 0.00001; p het = 0.08). Similar results were observed when comparing TT versus DAPT (OR [95 % CI] = 0.61 [0.45–0.84], p < 0.001) and TT versus oral anticoagulation in addition to a single antiplatelet agent (OAC + SAA) (OR [95 % CI] = 0.5 [0.37–0.68], p < 0.001) (p interaction = 0.37) (Fig. 6 ). Fig. 6 Triple therapy (TT) versus dual therapy (DT) on stroke (including the longest follow-up available) both in case of triple therapy versus dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) and triple therapy versus oral anticoagulation (OAC) in addition to a single antiplatelet agent (SAA) with odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals (CI). The size of the data markers (squares) is approximately proportional to the statistical weight of each trial
Major Bleedings
Data regarding major bleedings were available in 21657 patients (99.6 %). As expected, TT was associated with a significant increase in major bleeding events (746 out of 6924, 10.7 % versus 1258 out of 14733, 8.5 %) (OR [95 % CI] = 1.38 [1.25–1.53], p < 0.00001; p het = 0.02). The higher risk of bleeding was more pronounced with TT when compared to DAPT (OR [95 % CI] = 1.54 [1.35–1.76], p < 0.001) rather than to oral anticoagulation in addition to a single antiplatelet agent (OAC + SAA) (OR [95 % CI] = 1.18 [1.01–1.39], p = 0.04) (p interaction = 0.01) (Fig. 7 ). Fig. 7 Triple therapy (TT) versus dual therapy (DT) on major bleedings (including the longest follow-up available) both in case of triple therapy versus dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) and triple therapy versus oral anticoagulation (OAC) in addition to a single antiplatelet agent (SAA) with odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals (CI). The size of the data markers (squares) is approximately proportional to the statistical weight of each trial
Discussion
The main finding of the study is that among patients undergoing coronary stent implantation requiring chronic OAC, the use of TT is associated with a reduction in overall mortality despite an expected higher risk of bleeding complications observed. Moreover, TT was associated with a significant reduction in the recurrence of important secondary end points such as MI and ischemic stroke. The superiority of TT in terms of reduction in overall mortality, recurrent MI and ischemic stroke was also confirmed in a pre-specified analysis comparing TT versus DAPT or OAC + SAA.
CAD is still the leading cause of mortality in developed countries [ ] with a large number of high-risk patients to manage. The improvement in pharmacological therapies and percutaneous revascularization procedures have greatly contributed to the relevant reduction in mortality observed in last years for CAD, especially in the setting of acute myocardial infarction [ , , ], however, the results are unsatisfactory in high-risk subgroups of patients, with a lot of controversies still unresolved. A particular setting to consider is represented by patients undergoing coronary stent implantation with a concomitant indication to long term OAC, in which, to date, there is still no consensus about the optimal antithrombotic management to undertake due to the concomitant risk of bleeding and embolism. The use of a TT represented by aspirin, clopidogrel and warfarin has shown to be associated with an increased risk of bleeding, but on the other side it seems to reduce the risk of embolism or prosthetic valve thrombosis. Khurram et al. [ ] in 2006 showed that in patients requiring OAC in addition to dual antiplatelet therapy there was an approximately 7 % major bleeding risk. Moreover, Manzano-Fernandez et al. [ ] in 2008 showed a high rate of major bleeding among 104 patients treated with PCI with indication for OAC due to atrial fibrillation. These results were confirmed by a more recent study [ ], in which 4959 patients were included in a prospective multicenter registry, showing that patients treated with TT displayed a higher rates of major bleeding without a measurable difference in terms of composite MI, death or stroke. On the other side several other studies assessed the safety of TT in patients undergoing stent implantation, requiring long term OAC. Konstantino et al. [ , ] showed in two different studies the feasibility of a TT in patients with acute coronary syndrome, in which the addition of dual antiplatelet therapy to warfarin did not significantly increased 30-day and 6-month mortality. Moreover, more recent studies [ , ] showed the efficacy and safety of TT in patients with indication to OAC who undergo PCI. Several other studies [ , , , ] give us conflicting results showing no differences in safety and efficacy of a TT versus DT in patients undergoing stent implantation with indication to OAC. Moreover a recent study [ ] by Lamberts at al. suggested that a DT with OAC and clopidogrel was equal or better on both benefit and safety outcomes compared to TT. Therefore, on the basis of these assumption, it is of extreme importance to investigate the optimal antithrombotic / antiplatelet treatment in patients with indication to chronic OAC after stent implantation. This is the most updated meta-analysis comparing TT vs DT among patients requiring anticoagulation and undergoing stent implantation. We included seventeen trials with a total of 22103 patients. We found that that among patients undergoing coronary stent implantation, requiring chronic OAC, the use of TT is associated with a significant reduction in mortality, with a lower incidence of MI and ischemic stroke. On the other side, two recent meta analyses [ , ] about this issue showed no benefits of TT on major adverse cardiac events, but a higher rate of bleeding complications. This controversy could be explained because of a large number of studies included in these meta analyses compared patients treated with TT with patients in DAPT without indication to long term oral anticoagulation. Therefore there could be a significant underestimation of thromboembolic events among this population with an apparent benefits of DT in terms of reduction of bleeding complications. In our meta analysis we included only studies assessing the role of TT in patients with indication to long term OAC who undergo stent implantation. As expected, we found a higher incidence of bleedings in TT group and, as expected, the benefits in mortality were inversely related top the risk of major bleedings. However, the significant reduction in overall mortality and in major cardiovascular adverse events such as recurrent MI or ischemic stroke, suggested that TT should be recommended in patients with indication to long term OAC treated with coronary stent implantation. Higher attention should systematically be paid to patients at high risk of major bleedings. Moreover all studies included in our meta analysis enrolled patients with indication to dual antiplatelet therapy (as for recommendation of the current guidelines after DES implantation), but in the era of the new DES several studies are now assessing a possible reduction of the dual antiplatelet therapy duration [ , ], bringing to a probable reduction of bleeding risk in patients with indication to TT.
Limitations
This meta-analysis was not based on individual patient data, as complete datasets were not available. Finally, the studies included in this meta-analysis were conducted with old therapies, such as clopidogrel and Coumarins , and therefore can not be extended to new oral ADP agonists and new oral anticoagulation therapies. Finally, we did not evaluate Stent Thrombosis, since the data on this endpoint were available in less than 20 % of the total population.
Conclusions
This meta-analysis showed that among patients undergoing coronary stent implantation, requiring chronic OAC, the use of a TT is associated with a significant reduction in mortality, despite the higher incidence of bleedings observed in this group. Benefits of TT were evident also in terms of reduction of recurrent MI and ischemic stroke. The superiority of TT in terms of reduction in overall mortality, recurrent MI and ischemic stroke was also confirmed in a pre-specified analysis versus DAPT or versus oral anticoagulation in association with single antiplatelet agent. Future large randomized trials are certainly needed to confirm our findings and to assess the best combination and duration of therapies, especially in the era of new generation DES, new ADP antagonists and new oral anticoagulation therapies.
