Introduction
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that causes selective death of neurons in the cortex and the spinal cord [ ]. Most cases (90%) of ALS are sporadic, while about 10% are familial. Mutations in the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) gene constitutes 20% of familial ALS cases, and the hSOD1 G93A mouse model is the most widely characterized model of ALS [ ]. The exact mechanisms of motor neuron death in this disease are not comprehensively known. Several mechanisms have been hypothesized, including abnormal protein aggregation [ ], glutamate excitotoxicity [ , ], oxidative stress [ ], and dysfunctional energy metabolism [ , ]. It is likely that a combination of these pathogenic mechanisms contributes to the pathogenesis and progression of ALS.
Alterations in energy metabolism in people with ALS as well as ALS animal models have been reported in various studies. Many patients with ALS display abnormal energy homeostasis and reduced body weight, indicating defects in whole-body energy metabolism [ , ]. In certain CNS regions, including the cortex and spinal cord, several fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and 14 C autoradiography studies have indicated glucose hypometabolism in patients and in animal models of ALS [ , , ]. Consistent with this, we demonstrated that glycolysis-derived metabolites and first-turn TCA cycle–derived metabolites were significantly reduced in the cortex and spinal cord of the hSOD1 G93A mouse model of ALS at symptomatic stages of the disease, indicating reduced glycolysis [ ]. Specifically, we measured the levels of metabolites of injected [1- 13 C]glucose and [1,2- 13 C]acetate using high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and 1 H and 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR spectroscopy). We found reduced total lactate, [3- 13 C]lactate, total alanine, and [3- 13 C]alanine concentrations mainly in the CNS at mid stage, while the levels of glucose were largely unaltered [ ].
There is little known about alterations in defined glycolytic and TCA cycle steps, nor the activity of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) in ALS. The PPP is strongly connected to glycolysis and is important for the generation of NADPH, which may protect cells from oxidative stress. Although increased oxidative damage has been reported in CNS tissues of patients with ALS and animal models (reviewed in [ , ]), there are few studies about alterations of the PPP in ALS thus far.
Several impairments in the TCA cycle pathway have been reported in ALS models [ ]. Reduced gene expression of the TCA cycle enzymes isocitrate dehydrogenase and oxoglutarate dehydrogenase was found in the CNS tissues from hSOD1 G93A mice [ , ], which could lead to diminished metabolism of glucose via the TCA cycle. In our previous study, we found reduced labeling of first-turn TCA cycle–derived metabolites from [1- 13 C]glucose, including [4- 13 C]glutamate, [4- 13 C]glutamine, and [2- 13 C] GABA, which indicates reduced entry of [3- 13 C]pyruvate into the TCA cycle and reduced availability of TCA cycle intermediates for amino acid and neurotransmitter generation [ ].
Collectively, abnormalities in the energy-producing pathways in ALS may lead to reduced ATP generation and subsequent death of neurons (reviewed in [ , ]). However, the specific pathologic changes in each of these pathways contributing to the generation of reduction equivalents, energy, riboses, neurotransmitters, amino acids, and lipids are not clearly understood. The aim of this study was to further investigate alterations in glycolysis, the pentose phosphate, and TCA cycle pathways in the brain and spinal cord tissues from hSOD1 G93A mice at symptomatic stage of the disease. Thus, we examined the activity of glycolysis, pentose phosphate, and TCA cycle pathways in vivo in the brain and spinal cord of wild-type and hSOD1 G93A mice at onset of disease (80 days). We studied the metabolism of uniformly labeled glucose ([U- 13 C])glucose in vivo quantifying metabolites by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and investigated the activities of enzymes involved in glucose metabolism in tissue extracts.
Methods
Animals
All animal experiments were approved by the University of Queensland Animal Ethics Committee (SBMS 128/14) and followed the guidelines of the Queensland Animal Care and Protection Act 2001. Wild-type and hSOD1 G93A mice were bred by mating hSOD1 G93A males expressing high copy number of mutant SOD1 (B6.Cg-Tg(SOD1*G93A)1Gur/J, Jackson laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) with C57BL/6 wild-type females (University of Queensland). Female mice at 80 days (onset of disease) were used for this experiment. Mice were maintained in a 12-h light, 12-h dark cycle and had access to food and water ad libitum. Animals were randomly assigned numbers for tissue extraction as well as LC-MS/MS, enzyme activity, and data analyses. The genotype of the two groups was revealed after all the analysis was completed. All efforts were made to reduce the numbers and suffering of animals.
Injection of Uniformly Labeled Glucose ([U-13C]Glucose)
Wild-type ( n = 13) and hSOD1 G93A mice ( n = 14) at 80 days (onset of disease) were injected with uniformly labeled glucose ([U- 13 C]glucose, 0.3 M i.p., Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Tewksbury, MA, USA). After 15 min, mice were killed by microwave fixation to the head (Model MMW-05, Muromachi, Tokyo, Japan) at 5 KW for 0.74 to 0.80 s, to denature enzymes quickly. The cortex and the lumbar sections of the spinal cord tissues were dissected and stored at − 80 °C until extracted. The spinal cord tissues were not microwave-fixated and therefore subject to post-mortem metabolism. The time taken to dissect and freeze the spinal cord was less than 60 s.
Extraction of Tissue
The cortical and spinal cord tissues were first homogenized with a sonicator (Branson ultrasonics, Danbury, CT, USA) with an initial solvent of 1000 μl for the cortex and 750 μl for the spinal cord samples of chilled methanol with the addition of 4 μl or 3 μl of 1 mM azidothymidine (AZT) as an internal standard, respectively. Water-soluble metabolites were extracted using methanol/water/chloroform extraction method as described in [ ]. Samples were dried and metabolites quantified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
Labeling Patterns of [U-13C]Glucose
Via glycolysis, [ 13 C 6 ]glucose is phosphorylated into [U- 13 C]glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) by hexokinase. G6P gets further metabolized into uniformly labeled ([U- 13 C])fructose-6-phosphate (F6P), fructose-1,6 diphosphate (F16DP), dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GA3P), 1,3 bisphosphoglycerate (13BPG, not measured), (2 + 3) phosphoglycerate (2 + 3 PG), phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP), and pyruvate (PYR) and lactate (LAC). [U- 13 C]G6P can also be metabolized to glucose 1-phosphate (G1P) or enter the pentose phosphate pathway to produce uniformly labeled ribose 5-phosphate (R5P), ribulose 5-phosphate (RL5P) and xylulose 5-phosphate (X5P). Metabolites of the PPP can re-enter glycolysis as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GA3P). [U- 13 C]pyruvate enters into the TCA cycle as [1, 2- 13 C]acetyl CoA via pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). In the first turn of the TCA cycle, if [1, 2]acetyl CoA condenses with unlabeled oxaloacetate (OAA), it forms M + 2–labeled citrate (CIT), aconitate (ACO), α-ketoglutarate (AKG), succinate (SUC), fumarate (FUM), malate (MAL), and OAA (see Fig. 1 ). In the second turn of the TCA cycle, [1, 2]acetyl CoA condenses with labeled (M + 2) oxaloacetate (OAA) to give rise to (M + 4) labeled CIT and AKG, (M + 3) SUC, FUM, and MAL. For detailed labeling pattern and mass isotopomer analysis, see [ ].

Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry
LC-MS/MS data were obtained as described in [ , ]. Total amounts of metabolites were corrected using the weight of extracted tissue and internal standard added. For % 13 C enrichment analysis, 1.1% natural abundant 13 C was subtracted. Two wild-type and three hSOD1 G93A samples without 13 C labeling, which were likely a result of misdirected injection of labeled glucose, were removed from the analysis.
Enzyme Assays
The maximal activities of cytosolic (hexokinase (HK), pyruvate kinase (PK), glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH)), and mitochondrial enzymes (oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH), glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH)) involved in energy metabolism were quantified in extracts of wild-type and hSOD1 G93A mice cortex and the spinal cord as previously described in [ , ]. All enzyme assays were performed with the investigators blinded to the genotype of the samples.
Cytosolic and Mitochondrial Enrichment
Wild-type ( n = 11) and hSOD1 G93A mice ( n = 15) were sacrificed at disease onset (80 days of age). Brains and spinal cortices were removed, snap-frozen in dry ice, and stored at − 80 °C until required. The cortex and the spinal cord tissues were homogenized in 500 μL of mitochondrial enrichment buffer (70 mM sucrose, 210 mM mannitol, 5 mM HEPES; pH 7.4) with the addition of 5 μL of protease inhibitor cocktail (cat no. P8340, Sigma-Aldrich, NSW, Australia) using a glass-Teflon homogenizer. Samples were centrifuged at 1000 g , 4 °C for 10 min, and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube and centrifuged again at 12,000 g . The supernatant (cytosolic fraction) was removed and the pellet was resuspended in 250 μL mitochondrial isolation buffer (with added 1 mM EDTA and 0.5% BSA) and centrifuged at 10,500 g . The pellet was resuspended in 150 μL mitochondrial isolation buffer (mitochondrial enriched fraction). Both fractions were aliquoted and stored at − 80 °C.
Continuous Spectrophotometric Assays
The activities of HK, PK, G6PDH, GDH, and GOT were determined through continuous spectrophotometric assays using the Spectramax 190 Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, CA, USA) as previously described in [ ]. A Pierce bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was performed to determine protein concentration in each sample. The activities of GDH, GOT, and PK were determined via the oxidation of reduced β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (β-NADH), while the activities of HK and G6PDH were measured through the reduction of β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (β-NADP+) at 340 nm. In a 96-well plate, 10–30 μg of each sample was added to a reaction mix. To measure GDH activity, 25 mM 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG) (initiating reagent) was added to a reaction mix consisting of 100 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 0.6 mM β-NADH, and 105 mM ammonium chloride. For GOT, 3 mM aspartate was added to 80 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 0.6 mM β-NADH, 15 mM 2-OG, and 8.5 U/mL malic dehydrogenase (cat. M1567, Sigma-Aldrich, NSW, Australia). For PK, 20 mM phosphoenol pyruvate was added to 70 mM imidazole buffer (pH 7.2), 5 mM ADP, 40 mM MgCl 2 , 50 mM KCl, 0.6 mM β-NADH, and 24 U/mL lactic dehydrogenase (cat. L2500, Sigma-Aldrich, NSW, Australia). For HK, 200 mM d -glucose was added to 200 mM triethanolamine buffer (pH 7.4), 60 mM ATP, 20 mM β-NADP, 600 mM MgCl2, and 0.4 U G6PDH. For the G6PDH assay, 15 mM G6P was added to 85 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2 mM β-NADP, and 100 mM MgCl 2 . The initiating reagents were added just prior to the measurement of enzyme activity. The linear portion of the change in absorbance was measured, and the enzyme activity was calculated using the following equation. $$ \mathrm{Activity}\left(\mathrm{nmol}/\min /\mathrm{mL}\right)=\frac{\varDelta\ Abs/\min \times \mathrm{dilution}\ \mathrm{factor}\times \mathrm{total}\ \mathrm{volume}\ \mathrm{of}\ \mathrm{assay}\ \left(\mathrm{mL}\right)\times 1000\ }{\mathrm{mM}\ \mathrm{extinction}\ \mathrm{coefficient}\times \mathrm{volume}\ \mathrm{of}\ \mathrm{enzyme}\ \left(\mathrm{mL}\right)} $$
The tests were performed in triplicate, and the activity was expressed as nmol/min/mL, normalized to protein content (determined from the BCA assay), and finally expressed as U/mg protein.
Continuous Fluorometric Assays
The activities of PDH and OGDH were determined using the Spectramax M4 Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, CA, USA) through continuous fluorometric assays as previously described by [ ]. The same procedure was followed except 60 μg of the sample (mitochondrial fraction) was used and the reduction of β-NAD+ was measured at 355-nm excitation and 460-nm emission. For PDH, 2 mM sodium pyruvate was added to 35 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0.175 mM thiamine pyrophosphate, 2 mM β-NAD, 2.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.15 mM coenzyme A, and 0.04 mM rotenone. For OGDH, 1 mM 2-OG was added to 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM coenzyme A, 0.2 mM thiamine pyrophosphate, 4 mM β-NAD, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.04 mM rotenone. Enzyme activities were expressed as units of relative fluorescence/min/mg protein and normalized to activities found in tissues from wild-type mice.
Data Analysis
The comparisons of metabolite levels and activities of cytosolic and mitochondrial enzymes in the cortex and spinal cord between wild-type and hSOD1 G93A mice were performed using Student’s unpaired t test. p < 0.05 was regarded to be significant. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad, San Diego, USA) and are expressed as mean ± SEM.
Results
The total amounts as well as % 13 C enrichments (the amount of label corrected for natural abundance 13 C over the total amount of metabolite) of glycolytic, PPP, and TCA cycle metabolites from extracts of the cortex and spinal cord of wild-type and hSOD1 G93A mice injected with [U- 13 C]glucose at onset of disease (80 days) were determined using LC-MS/MS. Also, the maximal activities of enzymes involved in glucose metabolism were investigated in extracts from wild-type and hSOD1 G93A mouse brains and spinal cords.
Total Amounts and % 13C Enrichments of Glycolytic and PPP Intermediates
The total amounts of the glycolytic metabolite pyruvate (PYR) were significantly reduced by 20% in the cortex of hSOD1 G93A mice compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 2 a, p = 0.039). There were no significant differences in the total amounts of G6P, F6P, F16DP, DHAP, 2 + 3 PG, R5P and PEP in the cortex (Fig. 2 a). In the spinal cord, the total amounts of the PPP metabolite R5P ( p = 0.037) were significantly diminished by 35% (Fig. 2 b). No significant differences were seen in the total amounts of G6P, F6P, F16DP, DHAP, (2 + 3) PG, PEP, and PYR (Fig. 2 b). We found increased % 13 C enrichments by 26% in F16DP (M + 6) in the cortex ( p = 0.038) and threefold in G6P (M + 6) in the spinal cord ( p = 0.04) of hSOD1 G93A mice, while there were no significant changes in % 13 C enrichments of G6P (M + 6), F16DP (M + 6), and PYR (M + 3) in the cortex, and F6P (M + 6), DHAP (M + 3), 2 + 3 PG (M + 3), and PEP (M + 3) in both the cortex and spinal cord (Table 1 ).

Total Amounts, % 13C Enrichments, and Cycling Rates of TCA Cycle Intermediates
There were no significant changes between wild-type and hSOD1 G93A mice in the total amounts of the TCA cycle metabolites ISO + CIT in the cortex, and ACO, KGA, SUC, FUM, and MAL in both the cortex and spinal cord (Table 2 ). No significant differences were seen between wild-type and hSOD1 G93A mice in the % 13 C enrichments of the first-turn TCA cycle metabolites CIT (M + 2) in the cortex, and SUC (M + 2), FUM (M + 2) and SUC (M + 2) in both the cortex and spinal cord (Table 3 ). Similarly, there were no significant differences in the % 13 C enrichments of second turn TCA cycle metabolites CIT (M + 4), SUC (M + 3), and MAL (M + 3), except an increased % 13 C enrichment in FUM (M + 3) by 35% in the cortex ( p = 0.033) of hSOD1 G93A mice compared with the wild-type mice (Table 3 ). Calculating the TCA cycling rates from the ratios of the second turn over the first turn, % enrichments of TCA cycle metabolites showed no differences (Supplementary Table 1 ).

Enzyme Activities
The maximal activities of various enzymes involved in glucose metabolism were investigated in the extracts from the cerebral cortex and spinal cord of wild-type and hSOD1 G93A mice at onset of disease (Fig. 3 ). The activities of the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase and the normalized activities of the TCA cycle enzyme OGDH were significantly reduced in hSOD1 G93A mice cortex by 31% ( p = 0.002, unpaired t test) and 13% ( p = 0.037, unpaired t test), respectively, compared to wild-type mice (Fig. 3 a). Also, there was a 15% reduction in the activities of the PPP enzyme G6PDH in the cortex, although it did not reach statistical significance ( p = 0.058, unpaired t test) (Fig. 3 a). In the spinal cord (Fig. 3 b), there was a 24% reduction in G6PDH activity ( p = 0.005, unpaired t test). Although it did not reach statistical significance ( p = 0.14, unpaired t test), there was a 22% reduction in OGDH activity in hSOD1 G93A mice spinal cord. No significant differences were seen in the activities of HK, PDH, GDH, and GOT in both the cortex (Fig. 3 a) and spinal cord (Fig. 3 b) and PK in the spinal cord (Fig. 3 b) between hSOD1 G93A and wild-type mice.

Discussion
The main finding of this study is that the pentose phosphate pathway is impaired, indicated by significant reductions in the concentrations of the PPP metabolite ribose 5-phosphate (R5P), increased % 13 C enrichment in G6P, and reduced activity of the PPP enzyme G6PDH in hSOD1 G93A mice spinal cord compared to wild-type mice at onset of disease. Also, we showed that the activities of the enzymes pyruvate kinase and the levels of pyruvate in cortex of hSOD1 G93A mice were significantly reduced at the onset of disease, which could contribute to impairments in the glycolysis and TCA cycle pathways. OGDH activity was also reduced in the cortex indicating oxidative stress. A summary of the changes in metabolite levels as well as enzyme activities found in the brain and spinal cord tissues of hSOD1 G93A mice is given in Fig. 4 .

Impaired Pentose Phosphate Pathway in the Spinal Cord of hSOD1G93A Mice
In this study, we found a decrease in the amounts of the PPP metabolite ribose 5-phosphate (R5P) in the spinal cord. We also found an increased % 13 C enrichment in G6P in the spinal cord, which most likely signifies reduced metabolism of G6P through the PPP. The PPP and glycolysis are connected via G6P, which is formed by glucose phosphorylation catalyzed by hexokinase. G6P can either enter into glycolysis or the PPP. Via the PPP, G6P generates R5P by the actions of enzymes including G6PDH and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. The reduction in R5P levels could be due to a reduction in the synthesis of R5P as a result of decreased activities of these enzymes. Consistent with this, we showed that the activity of the main PPP enzyme G6PDH was significantly reduced. Also, studies in NSC-34 models of ALS-transfected with mutant SOD1 G93A and SOD1 G37R have shown reduced expression and activities of the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase enzymes [ ]. The PPP is important to provide pentose sugar molecules for nucleotide synthesis and electrons for generation of NADPH. NADPH is essential to maintain glutathione, a major antioxidant defense molecule in the CNS, in its reduced state. Although the levels of NADPH and glutathione were not measured in this study, the impairment in the PPP is expected to lower their amounts. Overall, decreased PPP increases susceptibility to oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is a key feature of ALS, and several studies have shown increased oxidative damage in proteins, lipids, and DNA in patients with ALS [ , , ]. In NSC-34 models of ALS, the reductions in total levels of NADPH [ ] and reduced glutathione levels were found, consistent with impairments in the PPP [ ]. In addition, depletion of glutathione was found to accelerate cellular death in a NSC-34 cells with TDP43 pathology [ ], in the spinal cord of hSOD1 G93A mice [ ] as well as motor dysfunction and mitochondrial impairments in glutamate-cysteine ligase knockout hSOD1 G93A mice [ ]. Interestingly, in two studies, glutathione supplementation was able to reduce motor deficits and motor neuron death in the spinal cord [ , ].
Alterations in Glycolysis in CNS Tissues of hSOD1G93A Mice
We found reduced levels of pyruvate in the cortex of hSOD1 G93A mice at the onset of disease indicating reduced glucose metabolism through glycolysis. In agreement with this, we found that the activity of the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase was significantly reduced in the cortex of hSOD1 G93A mice. Various studies have shown abnormalities in the glycolytic pathway in CNS tissues of ALS mice. In our previous study, we found diminished levels of glycolytic-derived metabolites, specifically lactate in both the cortex and spinal cord, and alanine in the spinal cord at symptomatic stages of disease [ ]. In addition, using FDG-PET and 14 C autoradiography, several early studies have shown glucose hypometabolism in the cortex and spinal cord of patients with ALS and animal models of ALS [ , , ]. Decreases in glucose uptake together with impairments in glycolysis contribute to a reduction in glycolysis-derived metabolites. Similarly, alterations in enzymes involved in the glycolytic pathway have been reported in ALS. In the motor cortex of patients with ALS, decreased mRNA expression of the glycolytic enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (pfkfb3) was found [ ]. The enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase produces fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, which in turn activates the major glycolytic enzyme phophofructokinase 1 [ ]. Hence, the reduction in the activities of pfkfb3 could lead to slowed glycolysis. Similarly, in astrocytes obtained from hSOD1 G93A mice spinal cord, gene expression of the enzyme phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (pgk1) was reduced, also suggesting impairments in glycolysis [ ]. The levels of other glycolytic intermediates however were not significantly changed in our study at this early stage of the disease. Generally, the levels of each glycolytic intermediate in the CNS, are low and minor changes may be undetected at this stage of disease [ ]. It is important to further investigate the changes in glycolytic metabolism as the disease progresses.
On the other hand, reductions in the levels of pyruvate could arise as a result of an increased shunting of this metabolite into the TCA cycle via pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). However, our study did not show increased levels of total or 13 C-labeled TCA cycle metabolites. Moreover, studies in hSOD1 G93A mutant NSC-34 cells showed increased activities of PDH kinase, an enzyme that reduces PDH enzyme activities [ ] suggesting reduced entry of pyruvate into the TCA cycle. Alternatively, pyruvate can be converted to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase. Lactate can then be transferred into the blood and contribute to the reduction in the amounts of pyruvate. Increased blood lactate levels have been found in patients with ALS [ , ]. Increased glycogen formation may also contribute to low lactate levels. Glycogen levels were found to be high in hSOD1 G93A mice brainstem and lumbar spinal cord [ ]. Taken together, impairments in glucose metabolism via glycolysis could contribute to diminished production of ATP in CNS tissues in ALS.
TCA Cycle Intermediate Levels Were Largely Unchanged
The incorporation of 13 C in TCA cycle intermediates was mainly unchanged at the onset stage of disease except for an increase in % 13 C enrichment in fumarate in the cortex in the second turn of the TCA cycle, which may be caused by the trend towards the reduction in the total amounts of fumarate. Although the total amounts of TCA cycle intermediates were largely unchanged, we found reduced activity of the TCA cycle enzyme OGDH in the cortex at the onset of disease, which may indicate elevated oxidative stress. Increased oxidative stress has been shown to inhibit OGDH and other TCA cycle enzymes in isolated nerve terminals and various cellular systems [ , ]. In our previous study, some of the first-turn TCA cycle–derived neurotransmitters were reduced in the spinal cord at mid stage (120 days), which could be due to the reduced entry of pyruvate into the TCA cycle [ ]. Other studies have shown abnormalities in the enzymes involved in the TCA cycle, such as reduced gene expression of isocitrate dehydrogenase and oxoglutarate dehydrogenase in hSOD1 G93A mice spinal cord [ , ], and increased expression of PDH kinase 1, an enzyme which inactivates PDH in NSC-34 cells from SOD1 G93A mice [ ]. Conversely, substances that feed the TCA cycle were shown to delay loss of motor neurons and improve motor symptoms in hSOD1 G93A mouse model of ALS [ , ]. In this study, the TCA cycle appears to generally function normally at the onset of disease. In future experiments, changes in these energy-producing pathways need to be further characterized as the disease progresses.
Alternative Fuels and Antioxidants Could Correct Metabolic Abnormalities in ALS
Given the impairments found in the CNS glucose metabolism, particularly in glycolysis and the PPP, alternative fuels may aid in providing energy to neurons and delay disease progression in ALS [ ]. Studies using substances that provide additional energy such as caprylic triglyceride [ ], ketogenic diet [ ], triheptanoin [ ], and the “Deanna Protocol,” a combination of metabolic supplements including medium chain triglycerides and arginine α-ketoglutarate [ ], were shown to improve motor symptoms and protect loss of motor neurons in ALS animal models. Moreover, the impairments observed in the PPP could lead to reduced ability of the CNS to defend against oxidative stress. In light of increased oxidative stress found in ALS, several antioxidant molecules have been investigated and were shown to protect against motor neuron degeneration in models of ALS (Matthews et al. ; Cassina et al. ; Miquel et al. ). Clinical trials testing alternative fuels and antioxidants are limited, and there is a need to further assess the therapeutic effects of such substances in people with ALS. Recently, edaravone, an antioxidant molecule was approved by the FDA for the treatment of ALS, which further raises the hope of better treatment [ ].
Conclusion
In conclusion, we demonstrated impairments in the pentose phosphate and glycolytic pathways in hSOD1 G93A mice CNS tissues at the onset of disease, which are expected to lead increased oxidative stress. Also, this will impair ATP generation and contribute to subsequent energy deficit in ALS. These findings emphasize the role of metabolic dysfunction in the pathogenesis and progression of ALS and the need to correct metabolic abnormalities and protection against oxidative stress to improve outcomes.
