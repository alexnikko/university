Introduction
Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) still plays a major role in the assessment of stress myocardial ischemia and in the identification of ischemic myocardium. Tc-99m perfusion agents are currently used in this setting with two injections for the rest- and stress-SPECT recordings, separated by at least several hours in between. , Dual-isotope protocols, using both Tl-201 and Tc-99m agents, constitute an alternative, taking advantage of the particular kinetic properties of Tl-201 and especially, of a high ability to assess myocardial viability with the more current dual-isotope protocols in which Tl-201 is injected at rest. ,
A major drawback is the rather high radiation exposure for patients, with effective doses reaching as high as 25 mSv for dual-isotope protocols scheduled on conventional Anger cameras. , However, a two- to threefold reduction in injected doses is now possible owing to the dramatic enhancement in count sensitivity provided by cameras equipped with semiconductor [cadmium–zinc–telluride (CZT)] detectors and new collimation systems. , An additional dose reduction may be achieved by the use of stress-first protocols where rest acquisitions are no longer warranted once stress images have been interpreted as definitely normal. , Stress-first protocols can now be extensively used on CZT cameras due to the good quality of the stress-first images, even with very low injected doses and in obese subjects, contrary to that documented with conventional Anger cameras.
In light of the above, it is likely that radiation doses could be maintained at more acceptable levels for dual-isotope protocols where Tl-201 would be dedicated to the second resting-SPECT and prescribed only in instances where stress-SPECT could not be considered as definitely normal. Such a protocol can now be envisaged owing to the improved energy resolution of CZT cameras and with dedicated software allowing to correct for the down-scatter of Tc-99m into the lower energy window of Tl-201.
The present prospective study was aimed at assessing this low-dose dual-isotope procedure on a CZT camera and with a stress-first Tc-99m Sestamibi SPECT followed, when abnormal, by a rest Tl-201 SPECT, along with a head-to-head comparison with a single-isotope procedure.
Materials and methods
Patient Population
The study was conducted in two different French institutions equipped with the same D.SPECT ® camera (Spectrum Dynamics, Caesarea, Israel): the University Hospital of Nancy and the Jean Perrin Center in Clermont-Ferrand. All patients with a body weight ≤100 kg and who were routinely referred to a one-day low-dose stress Tc-99m Sestamibi myocardial SPECT for a known or suspected coronary artery could be prospectively pre-included, depending on patient consent and camera availability. All patients gave written informed consent for the final inclusion which was conditional to the prescription of a rest Tc-99m Sestamibi SPECT, and thus the exclusion of the pre-included patients who had a definitely normal stress Tc-99m Sestamibi SPECT.
The study protocol, in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki, was approved by the local Ethics Committee (agreement numbers 12.06.04 for CPP and 2012-A00569-34 for ANSM).
Study Protocol and Tracer Injections
Patients were referred to an exercise test on a bicycle ergometer or a treadmill, except when maximal exercise was impossible or contraindicated in which instance a dipyridamole test (0.56 mg kg-L in 4 minutes) was conducted with or without exercise. Tc-99m Sestambi was injected at ≥3 minutes from the end of dipyridamole injection and/or at peak of exercise, with the patient being asked to continue at the same workload during two additional minutes. The routine low-dose single-isotope protocol with Tc-99m Sestamibi has already been described elsewhere. , , As detailed in Table 1 , the injected activities of Tc-99m Sestamibi were adapted to body weight, around 120 MBq at stress for 75 kg of body weight, and were threefold higher for the rest acquisitions relative to the stress acquisitions. The rest injection of Tc-99m Sestamibi was preceded by the administration of a nitroglycerin spray, in order to enhance viability assessment. The SPECT recordings were initiated 20 to 30 minutes after Tc-99m Sestambi injection at stress and 30 to 60 minutes after Tc-99m Sestambi injection at rest. Table 1 Injected doses of Tc-99m Sestamibi and of Tl-201 according to body weight Body weight Tc-99m stress (MBq) Tc-99m rest (MBq) Tl-201 rest (MBq) ≤60 80 240 45 61 to 70 100 300 50 71 to 80 120 360 53 81 to 90 140 420 54 91 to 100 145 434 55
As per the schematic representation of the study protocol illustrated in Figure 1 , the patients had an additional injection of Tl-201, approximately one hour after the stress injection of Tc-99m Sestamibi, and a dual Tl-201/Tc-99m recording was started 10 minutes later. The injected activity of Tl-201 was also adapted to body weight (Table 1 ), as previously described, but with a maximal level set at 55 MBq, in order to limit radiation exposure. When simultaneously imaging Tc-99m Sestamibi and Tl-201, the major crosstalk stems from the down-scatter of the Tc-99m into the Tl-201 70 keV energy windows. To minimize this crosstalk, the ratio between the injected activity of Tc-99m Sestamibi and Tl-201 was defined to not exceed threefold. These conditions have already been found to provide accurate results. , Figure 1 Schematic representation of the study protocol
All tracer activities were measured within the syringe prior to injection with a dedicated dose calibrator (CRC ® -15R, Capintec Inc., Ramsey, NJ, USA). Effective doses were determined according to data provided by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) in 2013, with the resulting respective ratios of 0.0079 mSv/MBq for the stress injection of Tc-99m Sestamibi, 0.009 mSv/MBq for the rest injection of Tc-99m Sestamibi and 0.14 mSv/MBq for the rest injection of Tl-201.
SPECT Recordings and Reconstructions
The recording data were obtained in list mode on the D.SPECT camera and with the patients in a semi-reclining prone position. , For the conventional single-isotope Tc-99m Sestamibi SPECT, the recording time was automatically adapted to reach a level of 500 myocardial kcounts , whereas for the dual-isotope acquisition, the recording time was conversely fixed at 15 minutes. ,
The Tc-99m Sestamibi SPECT images were reconstructed using a 20% energy window at approximately 140 keV photopeak and a dedicated algorithm, along with the following parameters: 32 subsets, 7 iterations, inter-iteration kernel filter with a ponderation of 0.125 and normalizing filter. , These parameters were adapted for reconstructing the gated-SPECT images, as previously described.
The Tl-201 images were processed with a specifically designed software for the D.SPECT, analyzing the information from multiple energy windows and leading to a reduction in crosstalk, scatter effects and image noise to much lower levels. , Reconstruction parameters were the same as those described for Tc-99m Sestamibi SPECT, except that the number of iterations was reduced to 4.
Analyses of the SPECT Images
A myocardium-to-background count ratio was determined on a mid-ventricular short-axis slice of each SPECT recording. For this purpose, mean myocardial counts were determined on a ring-shaped region of interest (ROI) encompassing endocardial and epicardial borders and avoiding areas with uptake defects, with a mean background count determined on a half-moon-shaped ROI, at 15 mm of the lateral wall. These ROI were initially placed on the Tc-99m Sestamibi stress images and were reproduced on the Tl-201 and Tc-99m Sestamibi rest images.
Furthermore, a head-to-head comparison was performed between the dual- and single-isotope procedures with regard to the identification of ischemic myocardium and based on the rest reversibility of the stress defects. For this purpose, uptake differences with stress Tc-99m Sestamibi SPECT were analyzed: (1) for rest acquisitions from Tl-201 (dual-isotope procedure) and from Tc-99m Sestamibi (single-isotope procedure) and (2) in segments for which a diagnosis of ischemia, infarct or normal perfusion was achieved with the combined analysis of Tc-99m Sestamibi SPECT and gated-SPECT.
The 17-segment left ventricular model was used for the above analyses with the systematic exclusion of the anteroseptal basal segment corresponding to the membranous septum and outflow tract. The segmental uptake values were obtained with the quantitative perfusion SPECT (QPS) software, with the segments exhibiting <40% uptake at rest (those predominantly non-viable and approaching the background level) being additionally considered as irreversible (rest–stress uptake difference set to zero).
The identification of ischemic, infarct, and normally perfused segments was achieved by a visual analysis of the Tc-99m Sestamibi SPECT and gated-SPECT images provided by an experienced observer and with highly specific criteria: (1) only the segments with moderate to severe stress uptake defects and with clear contractility abnormalities on the stress gated-SPECT were considered for the identification of ischemic or infarct segments; (2) only those showing a clear reversibility (i.e., a significant improvement) at rest of both perfusion and contractility abnormalities were considered for the diagnosis of ischemia (segments with post-ischemic stunning , ); (3) only those showing both irreversible perfusion and contractility abnormalities were considered for the diagnosis of infarct and thus, with the exclusion of attenuation artifacts; and (4) only those without any perfusion abnormality (with the exclusion of mild forms) were considered as having a definite normal perfusion. The other segments were not considered in the analyses.
Statistical Analysis
Continuous variables are reported as mean ± SD and categorical variables, as percentages. Continuous variables were compared with Mann–Whitney tests for unpaired comparisons and with Wilcoxon tests for paired comparisons. For all tests, a P value <0.05 was considered to reflect a significant difference.
Results
Per-patient Data
A total of 102 patients were ultimately included for the analyses. As detailed in Table 2 , 74% had previous histories of myocardial infarction and/or revascularization. In most cases, the stress test involved physical exercise alone (78%) or in association with dipyridamole injection (10%); and 54% of the stress–rest single-isotope Tc-99m Sestamibi SPECT exams could be finally considered as abnormal. Table 2 Main parameters recorded in the study population (n = 102) Age (years) 63 ± 11 Female gender 10 (10%) Weight (kg) 79 ± 12 Body-mass index (kg.m-2) 27 ± 3 Medical history Chest pain 34 (33%) Myocardial infarction 56 (55%) Coronary angioplasty 63 (62%) Bypass grafting 18 (18%) Injected activities (MBq) Tc-99m Sestamibi stress 123 ± 20 Tc-99m Sestamibi rest 365 ± 61 Tl-201 rest 52 ± 5 Effective doses (mSv) Tc-99m Sestamibi stress 1.0 ± 0.2 Tc-99m Sestamibi rest 3.3 ± 0.5 Tl-201 rest 7.3 ± 0.7 Stress test Exercise 80 (78%) Dipyridamole 12 (12%) Dipyridamole and exercise 10 (10%) Abnormal MPI 55 (54%)
The dual-isotope procedure was associated with a mean effective dose of 8.3 ± 0.9 mSv corresponding to a sum of 7.3 ± 0.7 mSv for rest Tl-201 and 1.0 ± 0.2 mSv for stress Tc-99m Sestamibi. This dose was lower for the single-isotope procedure, 4.3 ± 0.7 mSv, corresponding to a sum of 3.3 ± 0.5 mSv for rest Tc-99m Sestamibi and 1.0 ± 0.2 mSv for stress Tc-99m Sestamibi.
The myocardium-to-background count ratio was higher on the rest Tc-99m Sestamibi images (3.7 ± 6.9) comparatively to the rest Tl-201 images (3.1 ± 11.4, P < 0.001) with the highest ratio recorded on the stress Tc-99m Sestamibi images (4.2 ± 8.1, P = 0.01 vs rest Tc-99m Sestamibi).
Segmental Analysis
A total of 1632 segments were initially considered (16 for each of the 102 patients) in which a diagnosis could be achieved in 1566 of cases on the basis of the combined analysis of the SPECT and gated-SPECT Tc-99m Sestamibi images: 51 ischemic, 90 infarct, and 1425 normally perfused segments. The remaining 66 segments were excluded from the subsequent analyses.
As detailed in Figure 2 , the mean uptake values were similar between the rest images from Tl-201 and Tc-99m Sestamibi in the normal segments (71 ± 11% vs 71 ± 11%), whereas they were clearly higher for Tl-201 in the segments with a diagnosis of ischemia (63 ± 10% vs 58 ± 11%, P < 0.001) or of infarct (48 ± 13% vs 41 ± 14%, P < 0.001 for all comparisons), yielding evidence of an upward shift of uptake values. An attempt was made to correct this shift by suppression of the rising background count levels on the Tl-201 images, and a 12% level was ultimately found to provide the best correction of the upward shift with similar mean resting values as those observed with Tc-99m Sestamibi in ischemic (58 ± 12%) and infarct (41 ± 15%) segments. Figure 2 Comparisons, in segments with diagnosis of ischemia or infarction, of the uptake ( upper panel ) and of the difference between rest- and stress-SPECT uptakes ( lower panel ) for rest-SPECT images recorded with Tc-99m Sestamibi ( white columns ), with Tl-201 and no background suppression ( black columns ) and with Tl-201 and a 12% background suppression ( grey columns ). * P < 0.05 for paired comparisons
As shown in Figure 2 , the rest–stress difference in uptake values, reflecting the reversibility of the stress defects, was higher in the 51 ischemic segments compared to the 90 infarct segments with single-isotope (10 ± 6% vs 4 ± 8%, P < 0.001) and the corresponding values provided by the background-corrected dual-isotope procedure were equivalent (10 ± 9% vs 4 ± 7%, P < 0.001).
Finally, as evidenced by the receiver operating characteristics curves in Figure 3 , the background-corrected dual-isotope procedure provided an accurate identification of the ischemic segments based on the quantified rest–stress uptake difference. The corresponding curve area was as much as 0.83 ± 0.03 and it was equivalent to that documented for single-isotope (0.81 ± 0.03). Figure 3 Receiver operating characteristics curves for differentiating the 51 segments with ischemia from the 1515 segments without ischemia (either infarct or normal perfusion) based on the rest–stress difference in myocardial uptake provided by single-isotope ( dashed line , area: 0.81 ± 0.03) or by dual-isotope and a 12% background suppression on Tl-201 images (full line, area: 0.83 ± 0.03)
The criterion of a rest–stress difference ≥9%, corresponding to a significant difference in segment uptake, was also a strong predictor for separating the ischemic segments from the infarct or normally perfused segments with the background-corrected dual-isotope procedure (sensitivity: 51% (26/51), specificity: 98% (1363/1515), Chi -square: 82), as well as with the single-isotope procedure (sensitivity: 61% (31/51), specificity: 86% (1304/1515), Chi -square: 83).
It may also be pointed out that the ROC curve, obtained with the dual-isotope procedure but no background suppression, looks very similar to that of the background-corrected one with an equivalent curve area (0.82 ± 0.03). However, the best thresholds to separate the ischemic from the necrotic or normally perfused segments are markedly higher without than with background correction. For example these thresholds would be 14% and 9%, respectively, for reaching a high level of specificity (>90%) together with comparable sensitivities (51% for both).
Representative SPECT images from single-isotope and from dual-isotope with and without background correction are displayed in Figure 4 in a patient with ischemia. Figure 4 Representative SPECT images obtained at stress with Tc-99m Sestamibi, at rest with Tc-99m Sestamibi, and at rest with Tl-201 and without or with a 12% background suppression (BK suppr.) in a 64-year-old male patient with an inferior and lateral ischemia extended to 4 segments (20 to 25% of the left ventricle). Note that background activity, as well as the reversibility of stress defects, appears higher on Tl-201 than on Tc-99m Sestamibi rest-SPECT, whereas these differences are no longer observed with the 12% background suppression
Discussion
A major drawback of Tc-99m/Tl-201 dual-isotope protocols has been a high radiation exposure to patients, with effective doses as high as 25 mSv on conventional Anger cameras. , Previous studies had already shown that these doses could be decreased to approximately 12 mSv owing to the reduction in injected doses rendered possible by high-sensitivity CZT cameras. , , The present study shows that this reduction can be further extended to a mean radiation dose of 8.5 mSv with the D.SPECT camera, in keeping with the general recommendation to limit radiation exposure to less than 9 mSv for the majority of myocardial SPECT exams. ,
Furthermore, a stress-first protocol was used herein in which rest acquisitions are no longer warranted when stress images have been interpreted as definitely normal. , In our institution, this represents up to 37% of the patients referred to stress myocardial SPECT in clinical routine. Thus, if the present dual-isotope protocol had been applied in a more general population and with a suppression of 37% of the rest Tl-201-SPECT, the mean effective dose would have been decreased even further to approximately 5.7 mSv. This level is lower than those documented for current one-day Tc-99m single-isotope procedures on Anger cameras (around 10 mSv) as well as for previous low-dose dual-isotope procedures on CZT cameras (12 mSv).
This dual-isotope protocol had nonetheless the disadvantage of a higher irradiation dose than that of low-dose single-isotope procedure planed on CZT cameras (<5 mSv in the present study) and furthermore required adapting to a higher noise level of the Tl-201 rest images, presumably due to an insufficient scatter correction.
An iterative deconvolution method was however used for scatter correction and for reducing the down-scatter of the Tc-99m Compton photons within the 70 keV Tl-201 window. , This method takes advantage of the high energy resolution of the CZT detectors and was already assessed for simultaneous Tc-99m/Tl-201 dual-isotope recordings with D.SPECT, , , albeit without head-to-head comparison with results from a conventional single-isotope protocol.
Such head-to-head comparison was hence prospectively planed in the present study, leading to document a clear excess in image noise on the Tl-201 comparatively to conventional Sestamibi rest images. From a more practical standpoint, the concordance between the rest-SPECT from Sestamibi and Tl-201 was found to be markedly enhanced by the suppression of a background count level set at 12% of the maximal cardiac voxel value on Tl-201 images. This corrected procedure provided an efficient identification of ischemic segments based with an accurate separation from the infarct or normally perfused segments according to the rest–stress difference in myocardial uptake (area of receiver operating characteristics curve: 0.83 ± 0.03). However, it is likely that this finding of an accurate 12% level for background suppression needs to be prospectively assessed in a different study population.
The choice of highly specific criteria of ischemia was mandatory in the present instance for adjusting the dual-isotope procedure according to results from the conventional single-isotope procedure. This approach leads, however, to a restricted viewpoint, focused on severe ischemia with post-ischemic stunning. Complementary studies based on external gold standards, such as the presence coronary stenosis at angiography, are required for further analyses.
Owing of the results of the present study and of the observed excess in the noise levels of Tl-201 images, it must be recognized that this dual-isotope protocol does not exhibit an overall advantage, compared with single-isotope. Therefore, it could not be yet recommended for clinical practice. However, although this remains to be further assessed, it is likely that this dual-isotope protocol might have several advantages in selected patients, such as those with history of myocardial infarction and/or LV dysfunction and for whom the precise delineation of viable and ischemic myocardium may be crucial. This is firstly because of the close similarity of cardiac orientations and therefore of attenuation patterns between the stress and rest images of the dual-recording procedure. This is also because of the particular efficiency of rest Tl-201-SPECT for assessing viability , with, contrary to Tc-99m labeled perfusion tracers, a low incidence of confusing abdominal foci setting close to the heart and additionally, no “shine-through” phenomenon of stress Tc-99m images into resting Tc-99m images (i.e., a situation where the rest reversibility of stress defects could be underestimated owing to the residual Tc-99m activity from stress injection). It must also be considered that the viability detection of our dual-isotope protocol could be further improved by the use of 4-hour redistribution and/or nitrate-enhanced Tl-201 images. , In this regard, it may be pointed out that nitrates could be given only a single time in the present study, before the resting injection of Tc-99m Sestamibi and not before Tl-201 injection. This constitutes a limit for our comparisons between the corresponding resting-SPECT images.
Therefore, the present prospective head-to-head comparison study provides evidence that a dual-isotope low-dose procedure, applied on a CZT camera and involving stress-first Tc-99m images, provides an acceptable level of patients’ radiation and coherent results, as compared with a conventional single-isotope procedure, although it requires an adaptation to the higher scatter and noise levels of Tl-201 images. However, the diagnostic accuracy and the specific indications of this procedure remain to be fully determined.
New Knowledge Gained
A dual-isotope procedure may provide acceptable radiation doses owing: (1) to the reduction of injected activities provided by high-sensitivity CZT cameras (<9 mSv for the overall stress–rest protocol in the present study) and (2) to the possible use of a stress-first protocol with a further decrease of the mean effective dose to less than 6 mSv (for an expected rate of 37% of patients for whom rest-SPECT is not warranted).
