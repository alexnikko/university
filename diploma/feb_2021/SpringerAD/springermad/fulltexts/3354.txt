Introduction
Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a complex multifactorial and polygenic disorder in which multiple environmental and genetic factors are involved simultaneously [ ]. Therefore, identification of CAD risk factors on the molecular level as well as clinical epidemiology studies can provide a scientific basis for early diagnosis and prevention of CAD. In recent years, clinical and basic research found that a large number of traditional-risk-factor-free CAD patients generated several new risk factors, including the levels of apolipoprotein B (apoB) and apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I), their ratio apoB/apo A-I [ , ], mean platelet volume (MPV) [ , ], levels of serum total bilirubin [ , ], interleukin-18 (IL-18) [ , ], cystation C (CysC) [ , ], and hyperhomocysteinemia [ ].
More studies confirmed bilirubin as an endogenous antioxidant, which can inhibit oxidative modification of LDL, capture oxygen free radical (OFR), inhibit human fibroblast protein kinase C activity, and increase hemeoxygenase activity and the ability of serum cholesterol to dissolve [ , ]. There are cumulative epidemiological evidences suggesting that lower serum bilirubin levels are associated with an increased risk of developing CAD. Schwenner et al. [ ] first reported that a 50% decrease in total bilirubin was associated with a 47% increase in the probability of developing a more severe CAD. Hopkins et al. [ ] reported that serum bilirubin showed a significant inverse correlation with the risk of early familial CAD, and the authors pointed out that these retrospective findings needed prompt confirmation by prospective analyses. Accordingly, the Framingham offspring study [ ], the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) of the local population in the USA [ ] and the NHLBI family heart study [ ] suggested that a lower concentration of total bilirubin was associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease in general population. Although these studies have investigated the association between serum bilirubin levels and the risks of CAD, the relationship between serum bilirubin levels and the prognosis of CAD after PCI remains unclear. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the association between FSB and the prognosis of CAD in a Chinese population.
Methods
Ethical Approval of the Study Protocol
Written forms of informed consent were obtained from all participants. An approval by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University (Xinjiang, China) was obtained. This study was conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki.
Inclusion Criteria and Exclusion Criteria
CAD was defined as the presence of at least one significant coronary artery stenosis blocking ≥50% luminal diameter on coronary angiography. The detailed diagnostic and selection criteria have been previously described [ , ]. All enrolled CAD patients were treated with PCI and their residual coronary artery stenosis was <50%. The clinical features, biochemical laboratory data, and coronary angiographic findings and treatments were collected when the patients were admitted into the hospital. Patients were excluded if they had following situations: (1) CAD patients undergoing PCI and their residual coronary artery stenosis larger than or equal to 50%. (2) Patients who had poor treatment compliance after receiving PCI and stent implantation. (3) Patients with a history of kidney and hepatic diseases. (4) Patients with malignant tumors. (5) Clinical data or coronary angiography was not complete.
Study Population and Design
A total of 450 CAD patients receiving PCI and stent implantation from January 2012 to May 2013 in the First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University were enrolled in the study. All participants were of Chinese Han ethnicity and were from the same geographic area in Xinjiang. Demographic data and subject characteristics, including the conditions of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, alcohol consumption, BMI, and biochemical laboratory data, were collected for all participants. Hypertension, diabetes, BMI, smoking, and alcohol consumption were defined as described previously [ , ].
All of the CAD patients received coronary angiography examination performed using the Judkins technique. Coronary angiography records were analyzed by two interventional physicians independently. The inconsistent conclusions will be solved through the third physician analysis. Germany's Siemens AXIOM Artis FC/BC cardiovascular computer quantitative analysis system was utilized to evaluate the degree of coronary artery stenosis. Multiple transverse projections of the right and left coronary arteries were recorded in posteroanterior and axial views. Scoring of CAD severity was performed with a modification of the coronary atherosclerosis scoring system named the standard of Gensini method, as described by Ttakashi et al. [ ]. The Gensini score is an anatomic scoring system and quantifies the properties of lesions including their complexity, morphology, and locations in the coronary tree. Gensini score was used to calculate the levels of coronary severity scores (CSS). Six grades of stenosis were considered: <25, 25–50, 51–75, 76–90, 91–99, and 100%. The relative severity of these lesions was graded using a score of 1 for <25% obstruction, and that number was doubled as the severity of the obstruction progressed, as indicated by the reduction in lumen diameter (<25%, score of 1; 25–50%, score of 2; 51–75%, score of 4; 76–90%, score of 8; 91–99%, score of 16; and 100%, score of 32). Fifteen arterial segments were considered: the common trunk, four right segments, five left anterior descending segments, and five left circumflex segments. Each segment was assigned a multiplicative factor for its location: main left coronary segment, 5; proximal segments, 2.5; midsegments, 1.5; second diagonal segments, 0.5; posterolateral segments, 0.5; and other segments, 1.0. Each of the 15 severity scores was multiplied by the factor assigned to that segment and the sum of the products was the coronary severity score (CSS) for that patient.
Biochemical Analysis
The specimen of fasting venous blood from each admitted patient was collected. The serum concentrations of triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total serum bilirubin (TBIL), direct bilirubin (DBIL), indirect bilirubin (IBIL) were measured using standard methods in the Central Laboratory of the First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University, as described previously [ , , ].
Study Endpoints
The primary end point was a composite of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), including death from cardiac causes, myocardial infarction, ischemia-driven target-vessel revascularization, and re-hospitalization due to unstable angina pectoris and heart failure. Deaths were considered cardiac unless an unequivocal, non-cardiac cause was established (ICD-10 codes I00–I99). MI was defined as new Q waves and an increase in the creatine kinase MB concentration to greater than five times of the upper limit of the normal range, if it occurred within 48 h after the procedure, or as new Q waves or an increase in creatine kinase MB concentration to greater than the upper limit of the normal range, plus ischemic symptoms or signs, if it occurred more than 48 h after the procedure, as described previously (ICD-10, I21). Ischemia-driven target-vessel revascularization was defined as any recurrence of vascularization in the treated vessels where a stenosis of at least 50% of the diameter was present with ischemic signs or symptoms or at least 70% stenosis was present without any ischemic signs or symptoms [ ]. Unstable angina pectoris (ICD-10, I20.0) and heart failure (ICD-10, I50.0) were a composite of hospitalization for the primary diagnosis
Follow-up
Patients stayed in the hospital for at least 48 h after PCI. They were interviewed after 180 days (±10 days), and all patients were recommended to accept follow-up coronary angiography after 10 months. The investigators reviewed the patients, either by office visits or by telephone contacts as deemed necessary. The drug compliance and adverse events were assessed at every visit for clinical follow-up. The surveys were continued to the end of April 2015 or till patients’ death, whichever occurred first.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS version 17.0 software (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Data were expressed as the mean ± standard deviations (SD). The significance of difference was evaluated using the ANOVA test for continuous variables. Categorical variables were analyzed as frequencies and compared with values predicted by the Chi-square test. The Cox proportional hazards model was used for the univariate analysis to determine factors significantly associated with MACE. Furthermore, multivariate analysis was performed using a Cox proportional hazards model for independent variables that were related to the presence or absence of MACE predictors. Relative ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for each factor using the Cox proportional hazards analysis. Prognostic analysis was carried out using the Cox proportional hazards model and Kaplan–Meier survival curves. P < 0.05 from the two-sided test was considered statistically significant.
Results
Characteristics of Participants
As shown in Fig. 1 , all (100%) of these 450 CAD patients receiving PCI and stent implantation were enrolled for our study and 432 patients were followed up for a median of 2.17 ± 0.67 years (range 15–51 months) until the follow-up was terminated in April 2015. During the follow-up of up to 4.2 years, major adverse cardiac events (MACE) occurred in 27.31% of patients (18 cardiac deaths, 25 myocardial infarctions, 29 ischemia-driven target-vessel revascularizations, and 46 re-hospitalizations due to unstable angina pectoris or heart failure). All the patients were divided into three groups based on their mean FSB levels: high FSB group (high group; serum bilirubin ≥12.00 μmol/L; n = 158), intermediate FSB group (intermediate group; 8.54< serum bilirubin <11.99 μmol/L; n = 141), and low FSB group (low group; serum bilirubin ≤8.53 μmol/L; n = 151). Baseline clinical, angiographic, and procedural characteristics of these 432 patients entering the study are shown in Tables 1 and 2 . There was no significant difference among these three groups in terms of clinical characteristics such as age, gender, BMI, blood pressure and other indexes ( P > 0.05). The severity for CAD decreased with increasing concentrations of serum bilirubin among all three groups ( P = 0.023). The procedural characteristics including target vessel, the number of stents, stent length, and drug compliance were not different among these three groups (all P > 0.05, Table 2 ).

Clinical Outcomes
The incidence of total primary end point was 49.3% in the low FSB group, 22.4% in the intermediate FSB group and 10.5% in the high FSB group, respectively ( P = 0.001). The incidences of death from cardiac causes, myocardial infarction, ischemia-driven target-vessel revascularization, and heart failure were also statistically different among the three groups (all P < 0.05). We did not find difference in the incidences of unstable angina pectoris among the three groups ( P = 0.617) (Table 3 ).

Kaplan–Meier survival analysis suggested that the patients with low FSB had a decreased MACE-free survival (log-rank test, χ 2 = 34.65, P = 0.000, Fig. 2 a). Long-term MACE-free survival rates were significantly higher among patients with high levels of FSB than those patients at low FSB levels (log-rank test, χ 2 = 20.76, P = 0.000, Fig. 2 b).

Discussion
This prospective study demonstrates that the fasting serum FSB concentration was associated with the MACE in CAD patients after PCI. The higher the concentration of FSB, the lower the incidence of MACE, including MI, ischemia-driven target-vessel revascularization, heart failure, and cardiac death after PCI. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the prognostic value of FSB in Chinese CAD patients after PCI.
It is well known that traditional indicators such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus are risk factors for CAD. Yet more research has increasingly focused on non-traditional study of CAD risk factors. In recent years, with the extensive research on in vivo antioxidants, the antioxidant effect of bilirubin becomes a hot topic. Serum circulating bilirubin, a breakdown product from normal heme catabolism, is useful for assessing liver function and has been widely used as a marker of cholestasis [ ]. Previous studies have suggested that bilirubin is an effective antioxidant both in vitro and in vivo. As an antioxidant, it has shown to suppress the oxidation of lipids and lipoproteins, especially that of LDL cholesterol, and is directly related to the total serum antioxidant capacity in human. Recent research indicates that the lipophilic bilirubin is more effective at protecting lipids from oxidation than the water-soluble antioxidants such as glutathione, which primarily protects proteins from oxidation [ , , ]. Several prospective studies have assessed the association between serum bilirubin levels and the risk of CAD and have generally suggested inverse correlation [ , , ].
The present population-based cohort study provided several relevant findings that have not been previously addressed in the Chinese population. In this study, we evaluated the degree of coronary vessel severity in CAD patients, using the modified Gensini scoring method. The high levels of CSS predicted a more severe coronary malfunction in CAD patients. We found a strong inverse correlation between the CSS levels and FSB concentrations. Our findings were consistent with most of the previous studies that examined the association between serum bilirubin levels and CAD risks [ , , , , , ]. However, those other studies did not investigate the relationship between serum bilirubin levels and CAD prognosis.
In our study, it was found that the FSB level also emerged as an independent predictor for MACE, even after adjusting other traditional cardiovascular risk factors. The long-term MACE-free survival rate was highest in the high FSB group. In addition, the present study is a single-center experiment with a small number of patients, and the statistical power might not be strong enough for any data to be conclusive.
In conclusion, our results suggested that the baseline FSB level is inversely correlated with the severity of CAD. Also, the FSB level is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events in CAD patients. Understandably, our findings need further verification by large-scale, multi-center clinical trials in the future.
