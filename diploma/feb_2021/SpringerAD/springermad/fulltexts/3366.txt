Introduction
Cerebral infarction is one of the critical medical problems worldwide [ ]. Cerebral infarction is widely thought to be caused by atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis in the major branches of cerebral arteries leads to the stricture and occlusion of arteries [ ] and consequent cerebral infarction. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disease and a serious threat to human health. Most deaths of patients with diabetes are associated with vascular dysfunction such as cerebral infarction [ ]. It has been reported that the morbidity and mortality of cerebral infarction in patients with diabetes increase twofold to sixfold compared to patients without diabetes [ ]. However, the molecular pathological mechanisms associated with cerebral infarction in diabetes remain to be elucidated.
Family with sequence similarity 5, member C (FAM5C) is also known as retinoic acid (RA)-inducible neural-specific protein 3 (BRINP3). The FAM5 family has three members: FAM5A/BRINP1, FAM5B/BRINP2, and FAM5C/BRINP3. FAM5C has been found to be abundant in the nervous system and plays a critical role in the development of the nervous system [ ]. FAM5C expression has also been found in cultured fibroblasts, vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), cancer cells, and myoblastic cells [ , ]. FAM5C has been demonstrated to play a role in smooth muscle cell proliferation and senescence and to be associated with the risk of myocardial infarction [ ]. In addition, FAM5C can enhance monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells and accelerate the formation of atherosclerosis [ ]. However, the role of FAM5C in the progression of cerebral infarction in patients with diabetes remains unclear.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are highly conserved noncoding single-stranded RNAs with a length of 20–26 nucleotides [ ] and play key roles in regulating gene expression through binding to the 3′ UTR of their targeted mRNAs and degrading them [ , ]. Recent studies have demonstrated the crucial role of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of cerebral infarction and type 2 diabetes [ , , ]. For example, miR-223 was found to be decreased in diabetes patients compared to healthy controls [ ]. A study showed that miR-223 can inhibit the expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules, which leads to the subsequent development and progression of atherosclerosis [ ]. We therefore hypothesize that miR-223 may also play a role in the development of cerebral infarction in patients with diabetes, perhaps through the regulation of its target genes, accelerating the progression of atherosclerosis, and enhancing the risk of cerebral infarction. However, the targets of miR-223, which may be associated with the development of cerebral infarction, have not been identified.
In this study, we investigated the expression level of miR-223 and FAM5C in diabetes patients, cerebral infarction-only patients, and cerebral infarction with diabetes patients.
Materials and Methods
Participants
This study was pre-approved by the Ethics Committee for Human Research, Central South University, and written consent forms were obtained from all participants. Fourteen patients with cerebral infarction without type 2 diabetes mellitus (CI group), 16 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM group), 12 patients with cerebral infarction and type 2 diabetes mellitus (CIDM group), and 18 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC group) were recruited at Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, from March 2013 to September 2014. All subjects were Han Chinese and had no history of using anti-platelet or anti-diabetic agents. Routine examination was performed on each patient and included blood pressure, blood glucose, lipid profile, carotid artery ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, and magnetic resonance angiography. Cerebral infarction was diagnosed according to a patient’s medical history, neurological examination, laboratory examination, magnetic resonance imaging, and angiographic findings. Cerebral infarction was classified by TOAST classification [ ], which divided cerebral infarction into large artery atherosclerotic stroke, cardio-embolic infarct, small artery lacunar stroke, other special etiologies, and undetermined etiology. For this study, only the large artery atherosclerotic stroke patients were recruited. All T2D patients were diagnosed according to World Health Organization criteria, with fasting glucose level over 7 mmol/L (126 mg/dL), glucose level over 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) during the 2-h oral glucose tolerance test, or a clinical diagnosis of the disease. All patients with diabetes mellitus were diagnosed for the first time. All patients with a history of atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, tumor, acute infectious disease, severe immunity disease, blood disease, renal or liver failure, and hemorrhagic stroke or recurrent stroke were excluded from the study.
Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells Collection
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from whole blood as previously described with small modifications [ ]. Briefly, 2 ml of fasting blood was collected into a tube containing EDTA. After dilution with 2 ml of 1× PBS, 4 ml of lymphocyte separation medium was added. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by centrifugation at 400 g for 20 min at room temperature. The PBMCs layer was extracted.
RNA Extractions
Total RNA was isolated from PBMCs using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) by following the user manual. The concentration of total RNA was determined, and all samples were obtained with an absorbance ratio between 1.7 and 2.0 at 260/280 nm.
Reverse Transcription and Real-Time Quantitative PCR
The total RNA was transcribed into cDNA using Reverse First Strand cDNA Synthase (Fermentas). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed in triplicate using SYBR Green PCR premix kit (Roche, USA). The FAM5C gene was amplified using forward primer: 5′-GCCTGCCAAGACAAAGAAC-3′ and reverse primer: 5′-AGGTCAGTTTCAAAGCCAAT-3′. The thermal cycler conditions comprised of 40 cycles of 94 °C, 30 s; 60 °C, 30 s; and 72 °C, 30 s. β2-Microglobulin (B2M) was amplified using forward primer: 5′-CATCCATCCGACATTGAAGT-3′ and reverse primer: 5′-GGCAGGCATACTCATCTTTT-3′ as an internal control.
The reverse transcription of miRNA was performed using TaqMan miRNA RT Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA) by following the manufacturer’s protocol. The expression of miR-223-3p was analyzed by real-time PCR using a TaqMan ® miRNA assay kit (Step plus One, ABI, USA) by following the manufacturer’s protocol. The miR-223-3p primers were purchased from the Life Technologies Corporation (USA, Cat#: 4395406). U6 was amplified as an internal control, and the primers were purchased from Life Technologies Corporation (Cat#: 4395470). Relative microRNA expression was calculated using Relative Quantification Software (StepOne Software v2.2.2) by normalizing to U6 expression. The expression of miR-223-3p was analyzed using the 2 −ΔΔCt method [ ].
Western Blot Analysis
PBMCs were homogenized in lysate buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 1 % Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, and proteinase inhibitors). Twenty micrograms of total protein was separated on a 10 % SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PVDF, Minipoll, USA). After blocking with 5 % nonfat dry milk in TBST (Tris and 0.1 % Tween 20), blots were incubated with rabbit anti-FAM5C antibody (Abcam; 1:200) for overnight at 4 °C, followed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Bioworld; 1:5000). Immunoreactive bands were visualized using Electro-Chemi-Luminescence (Minipoll). After stripping, the membranes were reblotted with GAPDH antibody (Bioworld; 1:5000), and the ratio of FAM5C to GAPDH was used for the statistical analysis.
Constructing FAM5C 3′UTR Report Vector and miR-223 Mimic Expression Vector
To construct FAM5C 3′UTR reporter vector, the 3′ UTR sequence of FAM5C gene (XM_005245118) containing the predicted target sites of miR-223-3p was amplified from a human cDNA library using forward primer: 5′-GGCTCTAGAAACCATAAATGTCAAGCACA-3′ and reverse primer: 5′-GCGTCTAGATTAATAACTGTTCAGCTAC-3′. The amplified 356-bp PCR fragment was digested with Xba I and then cloned into the Xba I site of GV306 Dual-Luciferase miRNA Target Expression Vector (Genechen Corporation, China). To generate the miR-223-3p mimic expression vector, a oligonucleotide: 5′-GCGGATCCTGTCAGTTTGTCAAATACCCAAAGCTTDCC-3′ and its complimentary sequence were synthesized and annealed to produce a double-strand DNA fragment to express miR-223-3p. After digesting with BamHI/HindIII, the DNA fragment was cloned into BamHI/HindIII sites of pmRZsGreen1 miRNA Expression Vector (Genechen). The cloned inserts were sequenced using the primers provided together with the vectors.
Dual-Luciferase Activity Assay
The 293T cell line is a human embryonic kidney cell line and transformed with large T antigen. The 293T cell line was purchased from Genechen Corporation (China), and cells were grown in DMEM medium in a 24-well plate at 37 °C with 5 % CO 2 . Cells at 90 % confluency were co-transfected with 0.2 µg of FAM5C 3′UTR reporter vector or empty vector and 0.6 µg of miR-223-3p mimic expression vector or empty vector using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, CA, USA) by following the manufacturer’s protocol. After 48 h, cells were washed twice with 1× PBS and suspended in 100 µl/well 1× Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega, USA). The firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase activities were measured according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The data were shown as the ratio of firefly to Renilla luciferase activity.
Statistical Analysis
Data were presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) and analyzed with SPSS 18.0 software (IBM, NC, USA). Chi-square (χ 2 ) test, Student’s t test, and one-way ANOVA (LSD-t) were used for statistical analysis. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

The Expression of miR-223-3p in PBMCs
The miR-223-3p level in DM patients was significantly lower than that in healthy controls ( P < 0.05). No significant difference in the expression of miR-223-3p was observed between CIDM and CI patients and healthy controls ( P > 0.05). No significant difference in the expression of miR-223-3p was observed between CIDM and CI patients ( P > 0.05; Fig. 1 c). Also, no significant differences were observed when miR - 223 - 3p expression was compared between male and female patients, smoking and non-smoking patients, drinking and non-drinking patients in CIDM, CI, DM patients and healthy controls as well as between any two groups separated by gender, smoking, and drinking ( P > 0.05).
The Relationship Between miR-223 and FAM5C mRNA Expression
The expressions of miR-223-3p negatively are correlated with FAM5C mRNA in healthy controls and DM patients, but not in CI and CIDM patients (Table 2 ). Table 2 The relationship between miR-223 and FAM5C mRNA Groups Correlation coefficient P value All subjects −0.553 0.002 HC group −0.803 0.009 DM group −0.808 0.015 CI group −0.549 0.202 CIDM group −0.251 0.631
The Dual-Luciferase Activity Assay
Cells were co-transfected with FAM5C 3′UTR empty dual-luciferase plasmid (F empty) + miR-223 empty plasmid (R empty), F empty + miR-223-3p, FAM5C 3′UTR dual-luciferase plasmid (F) + (R empty), F + miR-223-3p, FAM5C mutated 3′ UTR dual-luciferase plasmid (F mutation) + (R empty), and F mutation + miR-223-3p. The dual-luciferase activity was significantly lower in cells co-transfected with miR-223-3p plasmid and FAM5C 3′UTR dual-luciferase plasmid than in cells co-transfected with miR-223 empty plasmid and FAM5C 3′UTR dual-luciferase plasmid ( P < 0.01). There were no significant differences in dual-luciferase activity between co-transfection of miR-223-3p plasmid with FAM5C 3′UTR-mutation dual-luciferase plasmid and co-transfection of miR-223 empty plasmid with FAM5C 3′UTR-mutation dual-luciferase plasmid ( P > 0.05; Fig. 1 d). There was no significant difference in dual-luciferase activity between co-transfection of miR-223-3p plasmid with FAM5C 3′UTR empty dual-luciferase plasmid and co-transfection of miR-223 empty plasmid with FAM5C 3′UTR empty dual-luciferase plasmid ( P > 0.05). These findings suggested that m-R-223-3p targets FAM5C and downregulates FAM5C gene expression. Using a bioinformatic prediction program such as TargetScan ( http://www.targetscan.org/ ), the putative miRNA-223 binding sites were predicted at the 3′ UTR of FAM5C (Fig. 2 b). miR-223 displayed a high targeting probability, indicated by a context score of <−0.15.

Discussion
Diabetes has been widely accepted as an important risk factor for cerebral infarction [ ] with unclear molecular mechanisms. This study compared the FAM5C and miR-223 expression in PBMCs in patients with cerebral infarction without type 2 diabetes mellitus (CI), patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), patients with cerebral infarction and type 2 diabetes mellitus (CIDM) to healthy controls. FAM5C mRNA and protein expression was significantly elevated in CIDM patients, but not in CI and DM patients, while miR-223 expression was significantly downregulated in DM, but not in CIDM and CI patients, compared to healthy controls.
miR-223 level has been found to be downregulated in human hematopoietic diseases and in populations with obesity [ ], suggesting a role of miR-223 in the metabolism of diseases. Zampetaki et al. [ ] reported that the level of miR-223 was lower in diabetes patients compared with healthy controls. Our study found that the miR-223 levels in the PBMCs of DM patients were significantly downregulated. Therefore, hyperglycemia probably depresses the expression of miR-223. However, miR-223 expression had only a tendency to be decreased in CI and CIDM patients compared to the healthy controls. This finding implicates that: (1) miR-223 may not be a risk factor for cerebral infarction in diabetes patients; (2) this might be a bias due to small sample size ( n = 12–16) or low miR-223 level in PBMCs; and (3) cerebral infarction increased miR-223 expression under an unknown mechanism. For example, a previous study demonstrated that circulating miRNA-223 level was elevated in acute ischemic stroke patients [ ]. Previous studies have revealed that FAM5C is associated with the risk of myocardial infarction throng involved in the formation of atherosclerosis [ , ]. However, the role of FAM5C in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with or without cerebral infarction has not been addressed. This study first showed that both FAM5C mRNA and protein levels were significantly elevated in CIDM, but not in CI and DM patients. Therefore, FAM5C is probably a specific marker for the risk of cerebral infarction in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. However, the dual-luciferase assay showed a 3′ UTR function of miR-223 on FAM5C, but correlation analysis showed no correlation between miR-223 levels and FAM5C mRNA and protein expression in CI and CIDM patients (Fig. 1 ). This divergence could be explained through CI possibly activating other miRNAs or other signal molecules that also regulate FAM5C expression. It has been widely accepted that a gene can be regulated by many miRNAs [ ]. A previous study has demonstrated that miR-146 is involved in ischemic stroke in diabetes mellitus [ ]. Therefore, our future studies will focus on identification of other miRNAs that are also involved in CIDM.
In this study, the in vitro dual-luciferase experiment showed that miR-223 can bind to the 3′ UTR of FAM5C and inhibit the expression of the FAM5C gene. In the clinical samples, the expressions of miR-223 are negatively correlated with FAM5C mRNA in all subjects. These results suggest that FAM5C is a target of miR-223. However, the level of FAM5C mRNA and protein was significantly upregulated in CIDM, but not in CI and DM patients. In contrast, the expression of miR-223 was significantly downregulated in DM, but not in CIDM and CI patients. These observations suggest that the FAM5C level in CIDM and DM may not be mainly regulated by miR-223.
In conclusion, our study suggests that elevation of FAM5C level in PBMCs may be a crucial biomarker for the risk of cerebral infarction in type 2 diabetes mellitus. MiR-223 plays limited roles in the elevation of FAM5C in diabetes.
