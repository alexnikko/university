Introduction
In 1987, the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED) coined the concept of “sustainable development” to refer to the development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs [ ]. Sustainable development is thus about a balancing act between economic endeavors, environmental and social responsibilities—the so-called triple bottom line of sustainability. A sustainable business enterprise is hence the one that strives to create products or services using processes and systems which are economically viable, non-polluting, conserving natural resources, safe, and beneficial to society [ ]. Such an important aspect of sustainability to businesses has been highlighted in a recent survey conducted by McKinsey [ ]. Using a sample of about 3000 executives from various companies ranging from finance services, retail, energy, telecommunication, manufacturing, and healthcare and pharmaceutical, the survey highlighted some interesting findings. For example, a large percentage of the respondents mentioned that their companies have been actively reducing energy use (63 %), waste generation (61 %), emissions (43 %), and water use (38 %) as part of the sustainability commitment. Further, the survey also highlighted that while sustainability has been well integrated into the company operations (58 %) and strategic planning (54 %), it has been lacking in the area of supply chain management (41 %).
A supply chain (SC) can be defined as a network of individuals and organizations involved in the creation, distribution, and sale of a product, from the raw material suppliers to the manufacturers, warehouses, distribution channels, and customers [ ]. Supply chain management (SCM) is then the management, integration, and coordination of all resources, information, activities, and technologies involved along the product value chain. Traditional SCM focuses only on economic viability such as reduced cost, short lead time, and high service level. However, with sustainability increasingly becoming a top concern, companies are now focusing their attentions on their SC operations not just in terms of economic goals but also environmental impacts. This is because every decision involving the SC — from the sourcing of raw materials to plant sitings and material transportation — has potential negative impacts on the environment, for example, toxic waste, water pollution, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. To enhance the long-term sustainability of their SC operations, a series of measures needs to be taken. This includes re-evaluating and re-designing the SC to ensure that it performs economically with minimum environmental impacts—this is termed as environmentally sustainable SC.
Recent years has seen much awareness from the pharmaceutical industry to include sustainability considerations in the business. GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), for example, has stated its commitment to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 25 % (from the 2010 baseline) by 2020 [ ]. It also aimed to be carbon neutral in its product value chain by 2050 [ ]. Similarly, Pfizer has planned to reduce GHG emissions along its SC by 20 % below 2012 levels by 2020 [ ]. However, compared to other industries, the heavily regulated nature of the pharmaceutical industry has added more challenges in terms of managing and implementing GHG emissions reduction in the SC. To illustrate this, consider the drug filing process. Once a new drug compound has reached phase III of clinical trials, it is usually prepared for registration. The typical materials that are submitted in the regulatory filing include proof of concept, clinical trial data, manufacturing process, and basic SC information such as chosen suppliers and manufacturing sites [ ]. Hence, at the filing stage, not only the SC structure for phase III has been fixed but the commercial stage as well. This could result in SC inefficiencies during the drug launch as the initial SC was not designed with the perspectives of minimizing SC costs moreover environmental impacts but rather delivering the product to the market as quickly as possible. However, re-designing the SC to accommodate emissions reduction during the commercial stage is not a feasible option since it requires a new filing process which is tedious, time-consuming, and expensive. As such, the challenge for pharmaceutical companies is to evaluate the fuller picture of both the economic aspects and environmental impacts associated with their SC activities early, even during the drug development phase. We address this important problem in this paper by proposing a systematic framework that can be used to drive GHG emissions reduction along the pharmaceutical SC starting from the early stages of drug development.
This paper is organized as follows: in the next section, literature survey of different methodologies to drive sustainability in the pharmaceutical SC is presented. This is followed by a presentation of an industrially relevant pharmaceutical case study. Next, we propose our framework for design of environmentally sustainable pharmaceutical SC and illustrate it using the case study. In the final section, we discuss the outcomes and present some conclusive remarks and future direction of our work.
Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Sustainability in Literature
Research in the area of pharmaceutical SCM has resulted in numerous techniques and methodologies published in the literature. However, most of these techniques have focused on improving the economic aspects of the SC such as cost, service level, and lead time without consideration of the environmental impacts. For example, Sousa et al. [ ] addressed the issue of optimal planning in a global pharmaceutical SC. They developed a mathematical optimization model for product-plant allocation in order to maximize profit. Niziolek et al. [ ] studied the impact of direct distribution strategies (disintermediation) from manufacturers to customers in a pharmaceutical SC system comprising of five or more manufacturing sites, one primary distribution center, multiple regional distribution centers, and hundreds of customers. They simulated different scenarios to evaluate the effects of varying delivery frequency and degrees of disintermediation on the transportation and inventory costs. Uthayakumar and Priyan [ ] developed an integrated inventory model for production and distribution of multiple products in a two-echelon system comprising a pharmaceutical company and a hospital. Their objective was to achieve the targeted customer service level at minimum cost. Staudacher and Bush [ ] investigated the impacts of lean manufacturing practices along a pharmaceutical SC comprising four primary manufacturers, a secondary manufacturer, and a distributor. They analyzed the impacts of reduced batch sizes, setup time, and different production sequence on the lead time variability.
Selection of suitable suppliers is one important element in the pharmaceutical SC. Hence, several decision-making methods have been proposed to address the supplier selection problem. Kirytopoulos et al. [ ] proposed an analytic network process (ANP) to select and evaluate credible suppliers in a pharmaceutical company. They included the following selection criteria in the analysis: cost, service, supplier’s reputation, quality, and risk factor. Enyinda et al. [ ] proposed an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) for supplier selection and evaluation in a generic pharmaceutical company. They extended the selection criteria of Kirytopoulos et al. [ ] to include several environmental elements such as regulatory compliance and green purchasing.
Manufacturing outsourcing is one area that has been drawing a lot of interest in the pharmaceutical industry. Zhang et al. [ ] studied the criteria for awarding contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) by the pharmaceutical companies. They proposed a method that is based on the theory of dynamic capability to manage the outsourcing relationships within the pharmaceutical industry. Nagurney et al. [ ] applied a game theory to determine the optimal pharmaceutical product flows associated with the SC activities such as make-or-buy decisions and contractor selections. Their objective was to minimize the total costs including potential disrepute costs with the contractors. Recently, Chatterjee [ ] applied an AHP method to select and evaluate CMOs. Their selection criteria were technical competency, geographical proximity, service cost, and manufacturing capacity.
While these methodologies are useful, not all are applicable to the problem that we are addressing in this paper, i.e., incorporating environmental sustainability into the design of pharmaceutical SC network during the early stages of drug development. Such a problem is particularly challenging due to the limited availability of SC information during the early stages. As such, the simulation and optimization methodologies described in the literature cannot be applied as they require information that is mostly available after the drug’s commercial launch. In addition, all the methodologies described in the literature are limited in their scope to solving specific domain of SC problem such as supplier selection, lead time minimization, and profit maximization. Design of an environmentally sustainable pharmaceutical SC, on the other hand, requires a close collaboration between different methodologies and integration of various knowledge areas for generating and evaluating alternative SCs in order to find the most sustainable one. Finally, all the methodologies described in literature share a common drawback—they do not address explicitly the environmental consequences associated with the SC. We address all these challenges by developing a systematic framework that integrates different methodologies—supplier and manufacturer selection, SC network mapping, and metrics calculation—for design of environmentally sustainable pharmaceutical SC. In the next sections, we will discuss each step of the framework but before that, we first describe an industrially motivated case study that will be used for illustrating different elements of the framework.
Case Study Description: Drug DF Production
This case study is based on an Eli Lilly process for manufacturing an API named R [ , ]. We have extended this case study to include the final drug production stage. The setting is clinical trial stage where basic chemistry information is available, as shown in Table 1 . Initially, reactants B, C, D, and M are reacted together to generate intermediate A. This is followed by a reaction between the intermediate A with reactants E, G, I, P, S, and T to produce API R. After separation, the API is blended with two excipients to produce drug product DP. Finally, the drug product is packed in primary (internal) and secondary (external) containment and sent as finished product DF for distribution. Our objective here is to design an environmentally sustainable SC network for commercial launch of drug DF. The considered scenario is delivery of 3000 kg of drug DF to two wholesalers located at different countries in equal portions.

Supply Chain Network Design Framework
Design of a SC network involves a decision-making to determine the location of each of the SC entities (suppliers, manufacturing plants, distributors, etc.) and the network connecting them. In this section, we describe our proposed SC design framework. Figure 1 outlines the sequence of steps employed in the framework. This has been developed from the perspective of a global pharmaceutical company which owns the manufacturing facilities and distribution centers. First, basic SC information including process materials, chemistries, make-or-buy decisions, and potential SC entities is consolidated. Next, each of the process materials is evaluated for selecting the most suitable supplier and manufacturer sites. For this, we have applied analytic hierarchy process (AHP) technique to assist in the decision-making. Once the sites have been decided, the next step is to map the entire SC network. In the meantime, several indicator metrics including lead time, SC cost, and carbon footprint are calculated based on the flows of materials within the network. In this paper, we have used the terms “GHG emissions” and “carbon footprint” interchangeably to refer to the total amount of GHG emissions generated during the SC activities. Next is detailed analysis of the SC network for the objective of implementation. This step is dependent upon the judgment of the decision-maker on the basis of indicator metrics. If the metrics are deemed unsatisfactory, alternative process chemistries, materials, SC sites, or material flows can be proposed and the metric calculation step be repeated again. Each of these steps is described in detail as follows. Fig. 1 Proposed SC design framework
Step 1: SC Information Gathering
The process of bringing a new drug to market starts with screening of thousands of chemical compounds, synthesizing the candidate compounds in the laboratory and testing them (on animals) in a pre-clinical setting. When the test data shows a promising result, the drug development then progresses to clinical trial stage—the synthesis is further scaled up from gram to kilogram level. At this stage, more detailed information about the drug manufacturing process such as product yield, reaction kinetics, and material and energy balances can be obtained from direct measurements or estimation [ ].
The first step in our SC design framework is to collect relevant SC information. In the early stages of drug development like the start of clinical trials, such information would include list of materials, make-or-buy decisions on materials (outsourcing options), list of potential suppliers and manufacturers (in-house or external), and material costs. Over the past 10 years, outsourcing has become a norm in the pharmaceutical industry and this is expected to continue in the coming years as it has proven effective at reducing both the capital and operational requirements [ ]. To decide on the outsourcing options, pharmaceutical company will first perform a comprehensive risk assessment of its product portfolios [ ]. Typically, drug substance of low volume production and not on the high-priority intellectual capital safeguard is an ideal candidate for outsourcing [ ]. On the other hand, an in-house production is favored if the substance is a proprietary material which accounts for a significant portion of the company’s revenue [ ]. For more information on make-buy decisions, the reader is referred to various literature sources [ , , , , ].
Once the outsourcing strategies have been decided, the potential suppliers and external manufacturers for each of the “buy” materials can be shortlisted. The costs of supplying these buy materials and their processing time over the required quantity can also be known — this is usually available through supplier quotations. In the meantime, the potential in-house manufacturing sites for each of the “make” materials can be identified together with the estimated production cost and time.
Table 2 highlights a portion of material supply information pertinent to our case study. The material supply and demand from each of the potential sites can be inferred from the mass balance information of Table 1 —this was calculated on the basis of delivery of 3000 kg of drug DF to two wholesalers in equal portion. Besides the material data, other information listed in Table 2 includes also GHG emissions associated with material processing. While GHGs comprise various gases including carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone, the amount of GHG emissions is generally expressed in terms of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 e), which is the total amount of CO 2 gas that would have the same global warming potential when measured over a specific timescale [ ]. Such emission data can also be obtained directly from the suppliers—this is the case for company such as GSK which request its suppliers to measure and report their emissions [ ]. Alternatively, it can be derived from the mass and energy balance data of the manufacturing process.

Table 3 lists selected distances, shipment modes, and transportation lead time between potential sites. These need to be accounted for in the network design. Distances between the potential sites can be calculated using geographical information tools such as Google Maps [ ]. Transportation lead times can be estimated based on the site distances and various shipment modes (truck, sea cargo, air cargo, and rail transport). For a complete version of Tables 2 and 3 , the reader is referred to the supplementary information.

Step 2: Selection of Supply and Manufacturing Sites
The next step in our SC design framework is to select the most suitable supplier and manufacturer sites among the list of potential sites. In the past, the decision-makers such as clinical supply professionals would have simply selected the sites on the basis of on-time delivery, consistent performance (past experience), potential risk, and cost [ ]. However, as sustainability becomes increasingly critical to businesses, pharmaceutical companies need to consider environmental factor as one of the selection criteria as well. Supplier and manufacturer site selection is thus a complex decision-making activity involving multiple considerations. A suitable decision-making tool can certainly be used so that decisions can be evaluated in a rational, transparent, and holistic manner rather than relying on intuitive and subjective judgment of the decision-makers.
One way of solving decision-making problem involving multiple criteria is through analytic hierarchy process (AHP) technique [ ]. AHP has been proven useful for structuring the decision-maker’s thoughts in a systematic manner [ ]. Due to its simplicity and ease of use, it has been widely used to solve many practical problems in business, industries and governments [ ]. Within the pharmaceutical industry, AHP has been successfully used to assist in assessing the likelihood of success of drug candidates at the early stages of drug development [ ]. It has also found application in decision-making related to technology upgradation in a manufacturing facility [ ]. While other technique such as analytic network process (ANP) can be equally used, we have applied AHP to site selection problem. This is because AHP is less data intensive and hence less time-consuming than ANP [ ].
The basic principle of AHP involves structuring the selection problem into three levels of hierarchy: goal, criteria, and options. In the context of SC network design, the goal can be to select the most suitable supplier or manufacturer sites. On the other hand, selection criteria can vary depending on the decision-maker’s considerations. For this, we have compiled a list of commonly used selection criteria upon which the decision-makers could base their selection. These criteria, which have been consolidated from various literature sources, include the following: Technical and scientific competency [ , , , ]: How skillful, knowledgeable and experienced are the manpower? Do they have the necessary equipment and technology to complete the work? Quality and regulatory compliance [ , , ]: How well does the site’s quality system and product’s quality meet the requirement set by the company and regulatory agency? Cost [ , , ]: How competitive is the offered price for the product or contracted process? Is there any tax relief given by the government where the site is located? Delivery [ , , ]: How satisfactory is the committed delivery, including lead time and quantity, for the product or contracted process? Which of the sites have the capacity to produce the material such that the delivery, lead time, and quantity satisfy the forecasted demand? Service quality and integrity [ , , ]: How dedicated and committed is the site in the business with the company? Does the site respect the company’s product and technology in terms of patent? Financial stability [ , , ]: How strong and reliable is the site’s finances in enabling an enduring and lasting partnership with uninterrupted supply? Environmental impact [ ]: What is the likely environmental impact caused by the site? Does it breach any regulation related to environmental matters? Social impact [ ]: What is the likely social impact (e.g., health and safety of the workforce) caused by the site? Does it breach any regulation related to social matters?
Besides those criteria, others mentioned in the literature include potential risk [ , , ], potential to improve [ , ] and recommendation and personal experience [ , ]. However, we do not include them as our selection criteria since they are not mutually exclusive of the other criteria [ ]. Consider the potential risk as an example. Risk is ubiquitous in various aspects of the SC and can present itself as environmental risk, delivery risk, cost risk, and so on. The same also applies to potential to improve and recommendation and personal experience. Hence, in our approach, we consider potential risk, potential to improve, and recommendation and personal experience as important considerations for the decision-maker when evaluating different options. Consider the scenario of comparing two potential manufacturing sites (external manufacturers) with respect to environmental impact criterion. The potential risk refers to the possibilities of the sites in causing environment impacts worse than the current environmental performances. Such situation can arise due to the companies’ culture (c ompany - related risk ) or locations where the sites reside ( location - related risk ). The former can be gauged by considering the past environmental incidence records, previous regulatory issues, unfavorable media coverage and so on. The latter can be referred from various available sources including database software such as Verisk Maplecroft’s Environmental Risk Analytics Risk Atlas [ ], World Resources Institute’s Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas [ ], and WWF’s Water Risk Filter [ ]. The potential to improve suggests the sites’ commitment in reducing the environmental impacts—this can be reflected through the sites’ involvement with various environmental stewardship programs and accreditations such as ISO or other environmental initiatives. The recommendation and personal experience refers to word of mouth and past experiences in working with the manufacturing sites—this will provide strong benchmark for comparison with other available sites. We have also included likely performance as important consideration in the site assessment. In this case, likely performance refers to the potential environmental impacts caused by the sites if they were to perform the assigned manufacturing process. Such environmental impacts, which include emissions, water usage, waste generation, and energy consumption, can be obtained through direct measurements, modeling, or estimation from the respective sites.
Consider the scenario of selecting an in-house facility among four potential sites (API-JP-01, API-FR-01, API-US-01, and API-BR-01) for manufacturing of intermediate A. To simplify the problem, we have considered the following criteria as determining factors for the site selection: quality and regulatory compliance (QRC), delivery (DL), and environmental impact (ENV). Figure 2 shows the hierarchy structure of the decision problem. At the top level of hierarchy is the goal of the decision, which is site selection. The second level presents a set of criteria that need to be considered for site selection. At the lowest level are the decision alternatives, which are potential sites. Once the hierarchy structure has been established, the next step is to perform a series of pairwise comparisons in order to derive the weight (importance) of each of the criteria. For this, we first compare QRC with DL, followed by QRC with ENV and finally DL with ENV. Once the weight of each criterion is known, the next step is to compare the potential sites against each of the criteria for preference—this is also done in pairwise. For example, with reference to environmental impact, API-JP-01 is first compared with API-FR-01, followed by API-JP-01 with API-US-01 and so on. The comparison can be done based on precise information about the sites (e.g., the GHG emissions per unit of product) or estimation by the decision-maker (e.g., API-FR-01 is thought more reliable in delivery than API-BR-01). As such, selection based on AHP does not necessarily require detailed information that is usually absent in the early stages of drug development. The reader is referred to Saaty and Vargas [ ] and Mocenni [ ] for more detailed description of AHP technique. Fig. 2 AHP hierarchy for selection of manufacturing site for production of intermediate material A
Table 4 shows our AHP results, which show the priority and rank of each site. The order of preference for producing intermediate material A according to the table is as follows: API-JP-01, API-FR-01, API-US-01, and API-BR-01. In the same way, we have also performed the same AHP procedure to each of the outsourced and internally manufactured materials for this case study. The result is shown in Table 5 . Overall, using AHP, we can reduce the complexities of a large decision problem into smaller ones that can be evaluated independently through a set of pairwise comparisons. This procedure is certainly easier to perform than simultaneously comparing all the alternatives at once and hence reduces the subjectivity of the decision-maker’s judgment.

Step 3: SC Network Design and Sustainability Assessment
Subsequent to the site selection step is SC network mapping, which involves creating a network connecting the raw material suppliers to the end customers — in our case, they are the wholesalers’ warehouses. To illustrate this step, consider Fig. 3 a which shows one possible SC network, called SC Network1. This network has been created by connecting all the sites, which have the highest AHP rank (see Table 5 ). Once the network has been created, we can evaluate it for its sustainability — this is done by calculating a set of performance indicator metrics. In our approach, we focus only on economic and environmental metrics. In the former, SC cost and lead time are used as the measure of economic impacts. For environmental impact, we calculate the total GHG emissions of the network. This is explained next. Fig. 3 SC Network1 a siting of suppliers and manufacturers with the highest AHP rank, b lead time calculation, and c carbon footprint calculation
Cost Calculation
The SC cost for delivering products or services to customers consists of two components: direct and indirect costs [ ]. The former refers to the cost that is directly attributed to fulfilling customer orders (e.g., cost of materials used and/or delivered, labor costs) while the latter refers to additional cost required to operate the SC (e.g., cost to lease and maintain equipment, inventory depreciation). In the SC design problem, direct cost component is considered more relevant and this involves the material purchasing cost, material transportation cost, and production cost, as follows: $$ SC\ \mathrm{costs}=\sum_{y=1}^{N_B}{m_yMC}_y+\sum_{x=1}^{N_T}{m_x{d}_xTC}_x+\sum_{w=1}^{N_M}{m_wPC}_w $$ (7)
The first term on the right hand side of the equation corresponds to the purchasing cost of N B units of buy materials at cost MC per unit. The second term relates to the transport costs of a total N T routes between the sites (suppliers, manufacturing plants, and distribution centers) over a distance d traveled at a unit cost of TC for each route. The TC values for various transportation modes can be obtained, for example, from the US Department of Transportation [ ]. In our case, we have used the following values ($/kg.km): 8.51 × 10 −4 (air cargo), 1.03 × 10 −4 (truck), 2.52 × 10 −5 (rail), and 1.14 × 10 −5 (ship cargo). The third term of the equation is the manufacturing cost of N M units of make materials at cost PC per unit . We have calculated the SC cost for SC Network1 using this equation and obtained a total cost of $6,366,905. The reader is referred to the supplementary information for detailed cost information.
Lead Time Calculation
The SC lead time can be obtained by considering the direction of material flows within the network, i.e., from the suppliers to the wholesalers’ warehouses. To calculate the SC lead time, the following information is needed: the supply time of each supplier, the processing time of each manufacturing plant and distribution center, and the transport time for material transfer between sites. When a particular material needs to be produced from a mixture of materials supplied by different suppliers of varying delivery times, the longest delivery time from any of the suppliers will be set as the lead time for supplying that material. To illustrate this, consider the SC network shown in Fig. 3 b. To deliver materials B, E, G, and P, the delivery time required for supplier SUP-CN-01 is 18 days (15 days production time and 3 days transportation time). For supplier SUP-JP-01 (materials C, I, and T) and SUP-KR-01 (materials D, M, and S), the delivery time is 22 and 12 days, respectively. Since all these materials are required for the production of API R, hence, the lead time for all these materials to be delivered to API-JP-01 is taken as 22 days (=max of [ , , ]). By applying the same procedure to each material flow within the SC network, we obtained the overall lead time of 112 days for SC Network1.
Carbon Footprint Calculation
The SC carbon footprint (SCCF) consists of two components as follows: $$ \mathrm{SCCF}=\sum_{z=1}^{N_s}{SCE}_z+\sum_{x=1}^{N_T}{TCE}_x $$ (8)
The first component of SCCF is SCE, which is the equivalent GHG emission from N S number of sites due to material processing. The second component of SCCF is TCE, which is the equivalent GHG emission due to material transport for a total N T number of routes. The value of TCE for each route x can be obtained by multiplying the traveling distance DT for that route with mass of material being transported and the emission factor for transportation mode used in the route. This is expressed as follows: $$ {TCE}_x={DT}_x\times {MT}_x\times {CEF}_x $$ (9)
The GHG emission factors for various transportation modes can be obtained from literature. In our case, we have used the database of GaBi software [ ]. In this case, the emission factors for ship, truck, rail, and air transports are 1.06 × 10 −5 , 7.02 × 10 −5 , 2.47 × 10 −5 , and 5.63 × 10 −4 kg CO 2 e/(kg.km), respectively. Using Eqs. ( 8 ) and ( 9 ), we have calculated and obtained a total SC carbon footprint of 21,895 kg CO 2 e. Figure 3 c shows the site and transportation carbon footprint contributions for this network. It shows that material transport contributes 12 % of the total GHG emissions.
An alternative network can also be proposed by connecting all the sites which have the second highest AHP rank (see Table 5 ). Figure 4 shows the structure of the network, which is called SC Network2. The total cost of the network is $6,267,704 while the SC lead time and the carbon footprint are 137 days and 28,827 kg CO 2 e.

Discussion
Table 6 compares the indicator metrics between SC Network1 and SC Network2. While SC Network2 is inferior in terms of lead time (22 %) and carbon footprint (32 %), it exhibits a negligible lower cost, which is within 2 % from the SC Network1 cost. Such longer lead time and higher carbon footprint of SC Network2 can be partly attributed to the sparse geographical locations of its supply and manufacturing sites around the world, hence necessitating longer transport distances (24 %) and transport time (14 %). The result is then 201 % increase in the transport emission. Another contributor to the higher carbon footprint in the SC Network2 is the site emission, which is 8 % higher than that of SC Network1. The table also highlights a large increase (203 %) in the transportation cost for SC Network2. However, this is compensated with a slight decrease both in the production cost (1 %) and purchasing cost (3 %). This shows that synergies and trade-offs exist between different components of the network. It is also important to note that SC Network2 is inferior in terms of quality and regulatory compliance, delivery, and environmental risk, as shown from its AHP rank. Hence, from the decision-maker’s standpoint, all these results conclude that SC Network1 is more sustainable than SC Network2 on overall.

As illustrated through the case study, the advantages of our proposed SC framework are threefold. Firstly, analysis based on AHP is useful and comprehensive for identifying high-priority suppliers and manufacturers on the basis of preset economic and environmental criteria. By structuring the multi-faceted selection problem into a hierarchy and performing pairwise comparison against a diverse range of criteria, the decision-makers are able to make holistic and transparent judgment that minimizes subjectivity. Secondly, the SC network mapping and metric calculation steps are valuable for designing a SC network that not only improves the environmental performance but also adds value to the business. In this case, the proposed framework enables evaluation and comparison between different SC network alternatives through their indicator metrics. Any resulting synergies and trade-offs between different SC alternatives could be highlighted and taken into consideration for deciding on the most sustainable one. Thirdly, the findings demonstrated how different network alternatives can be proposed using limited SC data. As such, the proposed framework presents a promising method that can be used during the early stages of drug development. This is the most important aspect of our approach as compared to other methodologies in the literature.
While the results from this case study are very encouraging, the methodologies implemented in the framework can be further improved. For example, during the AHP analysis, it is very common for the decision-maker to face uncertainties in his/her judgment. This may be due to the lack of SC information available both in amount and exactness. Further, there is also variability associated with the transportation and manufacturing lead time. Hence, in the future, we will address these issues by incorporating uncertainty (variability) analysis in our framework. The goal is to assist the decision-maker to assess the quality of his/her judgment and to identify critical areas of uncertainty so as to improve the level of confidence. Moreover, the current framework does not consider optimizing the flows of materials in between the sites to improve the network sustainability. Therefore, our next step will also incorporate SC optimization into the framework. The optimization can be cast as a multi-objective decision problem, where trade-offs between economic and environmental impacts need to be resolved. Such problem has been attempted by Elzakker et al. [ ] using the ε-constraint optimization technique. In the meantime, work is currently underway to develop a computer system (decision support system) that implements the framework.
