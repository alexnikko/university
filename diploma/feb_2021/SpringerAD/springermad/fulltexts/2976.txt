Introduction
The most common adverse reactions to intravenous iodinated contrast media administration, such as allergic-like reactions and contrast-induced nephropathy, have been widely investigated [ ], but few studies have evaluated contrast media’s potential effects on thyroid function. Specific European Society of Urogenital Radiology guidelines on the topic refer to studies in adults dating to 2004 [ ], and the most recent guidelines on contrast media from the same society cited only issues of thyrotoxicosis and contrast administration during pregnancy [ ]. Data on this subject on children are scarce and conflicting, probably because of the lack of prospective studies and of the use of different study protocols (population, iodinated contrast medium dose and concomitant use of iodine-based topical antiseptics) [ , , , , , ]. The use of iodinated contrast media in children is a safety issue that needs to be addressed, as highlighted recently in a United States Food and Drug Administration safety announcement advising that rare cases of under-active thyroid have been reported following iodinated contrast medium in premature and seriously ill infants, and requiring the manufacturers to conduct further studies [ ]. These concerns are mainly related to the crucial role of thyroid hormones in brain development, as shown in rodents and humans [ , ], but also in these hormones’ role in children’s growth and skeletal maturation, cardiovascular function and antioxidant modulation [ , ].
Therefore we investigated the effects of a standard dose of iodinated contrast medium on thyroid function in children with congenital heart disease undergoing cardiac CT.
Materials and methods
Study population
The paediatric ethics committee of the Regione Toscana, Italy, approved this study and we carried it out in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments. The ethics committee waived informed consent because of the retrospective nature of the study.
We conducted a retrospective observational study on paediatric patients admitted to the Fondazione Toscana Gabriele Monasterio (Massa, Italy) for various congenital heart diseases, who underwent contrast-enhanced cardiac CT between June 2012 and November 2015. We included all children whose serum levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone, free triiodothyronine and free thyroxine were available before CT (this measurement was performed the same day or the day before the exam), at 48 h after CT and at discharge from the hospital. These three hormonal measurements are the standard in the Fondazione when children are admitted and undergo CT. We excluded children with thyroid or kidney dysfunction at baseline, along with children taking any medication with known side effects on the thyroid gland or those who underwent any procedure with iodinated contrast medium administration other than CT, such as angiography, during their hospital stay. From baseline to 48 h after CT, the clinical course of the children was not characterised by any significant event, such as surgery or new drugs administration. All children in the study underwent surgery during their hospital stay, but always after the 48 h hormonal measurements.
The final cohort of subjects consisted of 33 children (22 boys and 11 girls). Their age was (mean ± standard deviation) 224±345 days (quartiles: 23, 125, 258; range: 1–1,636 days); their weight was 5.4±2.8 kg (quartiles: 3.6, 5, 6.3; range: 2.2–13 kg). We grouped children according to the World Health Organization position paper on paediatric age categories [ ]: group 1 included 10 neonates (age 0–30 days, 7 boys) and group 2 included 23 non-neonates (age>30 days, 15 boys).
Cardiac CT was performed with intravenous administration of 1.14±0.17 mL/kg of body weight (range 0.8–1.5 mL/kg) of Iopromide (Ultravist®; Bayer Pharma, Berlin, Germany) with a concentration of 370 mg of iodine/mL. The CT dose index value (mean ± standard deviation) was 0.8±0.2 mGy.
Statistical analysis
Quantitative variables were summarised as mean values, standard deviations, median, and 25th and 75th percentiles, and categorical variables as percentages. Normality distribution was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. In each group, we performed Friedman analysis of variance to compare the differences of thyroid-stimulating hormone, free triiodothyronine and free thyroxine values over time. We used the post hoc sign test when the Friedman test result was significant. For post hoc multiple testing, we adjusted the alpha level by using the Bonferroni correction (i.e. results were considered statistically significant at P <0.0167). For all other analyses, P -values <0.05 were considered significant. Statistical analyses were conducted using STATA/SE for Windows, version 12.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).

Table 2 shows the thyroid function variations over time in group 1; the ranges of normality of hormonal measurements are taken from the literature [ , ]. The time from CT to discharge was (mean ± standard deviation) 20.5±16.5 days. The variations over time of thyroid-stimulating hormone median levels were statistically significant ( P =0.0017). In particular we observed a significant reduction of thyroid-stimulating hormone median levels from baseline to 48 h ( P =0.0020). At discharge hormone levels in the sample were higher than those measured at 48 h, although they were lower than baseline levels (not significant). Differences in the trend of free triiodothyronine were statistically significant ( P =0.0247); however post hoc comparisons were not. There was no significant time trend for free thyroxine.

Looking more closely at thyroidal hormones response in group 1 patients at the three time points, it is evident that thyroid-stimulating hormone medians underwent much larger and significant variations over time with respect to free triiodothyronine and free thyroxine. However, in spite of the drop that was observed at 48 h, when most of the levels were abnormal, thyroid-stimulating hormone values at discharge were within normal range; only one child (a 1-day-old boy weighing 2.3 kg at admission, diagnosed with tetralogy of Fallot, discharged after 10 days) did not return to normal thyroid function, with thyroid-stimulating hormone at 0.20 μIU/ml at discharge.
Table 3 shows the demographics and the thyroid function variations over time in group 2; the ranges of normality of hormonal measurements are taken from the literature [ , ]. The time from CT to discharge was (mean ± standard deviation) 19.5±23.0 days. In this group the differences in thyroid-stimulating hormone and free triiodothyronine levels over time were statistically significant ( P <0.001 in both cases). For thyroid-stimulating hormone levels, we observed a significant reduction of levels from baseline to 48 h and an increase from 48 h to discharge ( P =0.0005 and P =0.0001, respectively), while the difference between baseline and discharge was not significant. For free triiodothyronine levels, we observed a reduction from baseline to 48 h and an increase from 48 h to discharge ( P <0.0001 and P =0.0106, respectively); the differences between baseline and discharge were not statistically significant. The variations over time of free thyroxine levels were not statistically significant. In this group 16/23 patients (70%) had normal thyroid-stimulating hormone values at discharge, while 17% had reduced and 13% increased values. The medians of thyroid-stimulating hormone and free triiodothyronine had larger variations over time with respect to free thyroxine.

Discussion
Children undergoing contrast-enhanced CT are exposed to a significant excess iodine from iodinated contrast medium intravenous administration considering that the National Institutes of Health recommended daily intake is 110 μg from birth to 6 months and 130 μg from 6 months to 2 years of age. Cardiac CT delivers approximately 422 mg of iodine per kg of body weight. The clinical significance of iodine excess in children following iodinated contrast medium is still a matter of debate and conclusions cannot be drawn yet.
Our study has three main findings: (1) children experienced thyroid-stimulating hormone reduction from baseline to 48 h after iodinated contrast administration; (2) the alteration was transient in most cases, with thyroid hormone levels in the normal range at hospital discharge; (3) the variation of thyroid-stimulating hormone over time was wider with respect to free triiodothyronine and free thyroxine, especially in neonates.
The thyroid-stimulating hormone drop that we observed from baseline to 48 h after iodinated contrast medium administration was in contrast with previously published data. A recent study by Dechant et al. [ ] analysed the effects on thyroid-stimulating hormone, free triiodothyronine and free thyroxine of iodinated contrast medium in 10 neonates and 11 infants undergoing cardiac catheterisation, sampling the hormones at 3–5, 12–16 and 21–35 days after the procedure. At 3–5 days they observed small hormone fluctuations within the ranges of normality in most of the children, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone increase in some neonates, suggesting a latent hypothyroidism; at the following time points, all hormones returned to normal levels. In this study the time points of hormonal evaluation were different from ours, in particular their first sampling was at 3–5 days whereas ours was at 48 h. At the first time point Dechant observed the Wolff-Chaikoff effect on the patients, while we probably anticipated it. The Wolff-Chaikoff effect is an autoregulatory mechanism of the thyroid gland characterised by thyroid hormone synthesis suppression following a high amount of iodine. The effect starts days after iodine load, and generally resolves within 2 weeks because of the activation of the so-called escape phenomenon [ ]. With our hormonal measurement at 48 h, we probably observed the thyroid response to excess iodine before the Wolff-Chaikoff effect. Another difference between the two studies was the delivered dose of iodinated contrast medium; in fact, ours was 1.14 mL/kg of body weight and at a lower concentration, and theirs was 6.8 mL/kg. During cardiac catheterisation iodine doses can be much higher and less standardised than in CT, and this was likely to be another factor leading to different thyroidal responses.
In contrast to our experience, the iodine dose varied very largely in the studies reported in literature, ranging from less than 1 mL of iodinated contrast medium for localisation of percutaneous vascular catheters (unsurprisingly with absence of thyroid function alteration) [ ] to nearly 10 mL/kg of body weight for cardiac percutaneous interventions [ ], reflecting the different uses of iodinated contrast medium in many clinical scenarios. Other studies evaluated whether neonates exposed to iodinated contrast medium were at risk of hypothyroidism but, as also pointed out in a systematic literature review by Ahmet et al. [ ], the risk of biases was generally high because of many confounding factors. For example, in two studies performed in infants undergoing cardiac catheterisation, authors concluded that the relative contribution to thyroid alterations derived from iodinated contrast medium and from iodine-containing topical antiseptics (no longer in use) cannot be distinguished with certainty [ , ]. Another possible confounding factor, in our opinion, could be the variability of the time points of hormone measurements after iodinated contrast medium exposure. This was evident, for example, in a very recent study on preterm neonates by Williams et al. [ ], who measured thyroid-stimulating hormone and free thyroxine at 7 days, 14 days and 28 days after birth, but iodine administration varied between 0 and 6 days after birth. This was also a limitation of our study because the last measurement was made at discharge and was not at a fixed day after CT; however we were able to perform the first measurement consistently at 48 h.
The variability of results presented in different studies was also highlighted by Bona et al. [ ], who did not observe any thyroid function alteration at 10 days and 30 days after high doses of iodinated contrast medium (5 mL/kg) in 10 healthy neonates undergoing urography. This result could be explained by an optimal activation of the Wolff-Chaikoff effect, and not only by the use of a nonionic iodinated contrast medium, as suggested by the authors.
As for the possible differences between ionic and non-ionic, high- and low-osmolality contrast agents on thyroid function, these comparisons were not feasible in our study because we used only one low-osmolality non-ionic contrast medium, which is our standard clinical practice when performing CT studies in children.
Our study had some limitations. First, the study population was relatively small, which is a critical common issue of studies involving children affected by congenital heart diseases. Second, the last hormone measurement was performed at discharge from the hospital and therefore it varied greatly, as previously discussed. This was a result of the retrospective nature of the study, which is another significant limitation. This latter limitation gave rise to another one; in fact we were not able to avoid many potentially confounding factors that could have affected thyroid function in our population. In particular, we could not compare healthy with diseased children, and match our subjects with other ones with hormonal measurement but without iodinated contrast medium administration. However, we excluded from our study children with thyroid or renal disease and those taking medication with known side effects on the thyroid gland. Another important limitation was that children were born at other hospitals, often outside the country, and therefore in many cases we were not able to retrieve information on the children’s antenatal and perinatal status (e.g., if the children were premature), even if in some cases this could be inferred by the body weight of children at the time of CT. Finally, we could not evaluate thyroid hormones 1 month or later after CT, again because of the retrospective nature of the study.
Conclusion
There is a significant reduction of thyroid-stimulating hormone levels from baseline to 48 h after cardiac CT with a standard dose of iodinated contrast medium administration in both neonates and infants/young children with congenital heart diseases in the absence of thyroid or renal pathology. This reduction is transient in most children. In our sample, thyroid-stimulating hormone had returned to normal range by discharge from the hospital. Variations of free triiodothyronine and free thyroxine were less pronounced.
