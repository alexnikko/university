Introduction
Hydatid disease is a major parasitic disease of veterinary and public health importance all over the world. It has great economic and zoonotic importance due to its great morbidity and mortality, which is attributed in most cases of cyst complications (Osman et al. ). Hydatid cyst affects 1–220 people per 100,000 depending on the region. The disease is endemic in Mediterranean and Middle Eastern countries; eastern European countries; and in eastern Africa, Australia, China, New Zealand, and Argentina (Şahin et al. ). Hydatid disease is endemic in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), affecting both humans and their domestic animals (Al-Olayan and Helmy ).
Hydatid disease or cystic echinococcosis is a disease caused by infection with the larval stage of the cestode tapeworm Echinococcus ( E. ) granulosus (World Health Organization ). The lifecycle of E. granulosus requires two hosts: a definitive carnivore and an intermediate herbivore including sheep and cattle. Humans represent a “dead end” in the lifecycle and become infected after handling feces of the definitive hosts or consuming food contaminated with eggs (Virginio et al. ). The hydatid cyst is encompassed by a cyst wall composed of two layers, an innermost germinal layer and an outer acellular laminated layer. The hydatid cyst is filled with hydatid cyst fluid (HCF) which delivers the nutrients and necessary components for the growth and development of the larval cyst.
The liver is the vital organ involved in numerous metabolic functions and detoxification of lethal substances. The disruption in the transport function of the hepatocytes as a result of hepatic damage causes the outflow of enzymes from the liver cytosol into the blood due to altered permeability of the membrane (Bastway et al. ). The liver is the most common site of hydatid cyst in patients, followed by the lungs. Other organs which are infected but with lower frequency are kidneys, spleen, muscles, skin, abdominal and pelvic cavity, mediastinum, heart, brain, and spinal cord (Ahmadnia et al. ).
The present study was designed to estimate the prevalence of cystic echinococcosis and determine cyst fertility and viability rates in slaughtered sheep at Hail city, KSA. Also, biochemical components within hydatid cysts play an important role in the metabolism, physiology, and immunology of cystic echinococcosis. Hence, the current study evaluates the electrolyte profile and hepatic transaminase enzymes in hydatid cyst fluid of fertile and sterile cysts.
Methods and materials
The study protocol was performed and approved according to the Institutional Scientific and Research Ethics Committees College of Applied Medical Science, University of Hail, Saudi Arabia. All applicable international, national, and institutional guidelines for the care and use of animals were followed.
The present study was done in the Department of Clinical Laboratory Science, College of Applied Medical Science, Hail University, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The duration of the study was a period of 1 year from 1 January 2015 to 30 December 2015.
Study area
The study was conducted in Hail region, KSA.
Animals
This study was carried out prospectively on sheep slaughtered in a southern slaughterhouse, Hail city, where all the organs of the slaughtered animals were carefully inspected for hydatid cyst.
The infected liver was collected and carefully cut with a knife and collected in plastic packages containing 10% formalin as a preservative and sent to the parasitological laboratory.
Parasitological examination
The individual cysts from each of the infected liver were incised and examined for protoscoleces. The protoscoleces appeared as white dots, and each cyst was characterized as fertile. This was done by placing a drop of fluid taken from the cyst containing hydatid sand and examining for amoeboid-like peristaltic movements. Cysts were identified and classified as fertile and infertile. The infertile cysts were further classified as sterile and calcified (Assefa et al. ).
Viability test
Eosin exclusion test was applied to determine the viability of protoscoleces (Dalimi et al. ).
Conformational staining of protoscoleces
Several vital stains like methylene blue and fast green were used for viability determinations of hydatid cysts.
Biochemical examination
The cysts were transferred to the parasitological laboratory and their fluids were aspirated aseptically, centrifuged at 1500 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min, and the supernatants were analyzed for various biochemical parameters including glucose, total protein, triglycerides, cholesterol, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and electrolyte profiles using commercial kits purchased from United Diagnostics, KSA.
Histopathological examination
Immediately after aspiration of the cyst fluid, the cysts, and the surrounding tissues were fixed in 10% neutral formol saline to be used in the histopathological studies. Samples were embedded in paraffin blocks and serial sections were cut at a thickness of 4–5 μm and stained with hematoxylin and eosin as a routine histopathological stain (Drury and Wallington ).
Statistical analysis
The SPSS for Windows, version 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago), was used for the statistical analyses. Results were expressed as mean ± SE. Statistical analyses were performed using t test. Values of P < 0.01 and P < 0.001 were considered highly and very highly significant, respectively.
Results
From a total 53,981 slaughtered sheep, 3811 were found infected with hydatid cyst; specifically, hydatid cyst was detected in the liver of sheep. The overall infection rate in slaughtered sheep in this period (from 1 January 2015 to 30 December 2015) was 7.06% as shown in Table 1 . Table 1 Number of infected animals slaughtered in the period from 1 January 2015 to 30 December 2015 Number of slaughtered animals per year No. of infected Infection rate (%) 53981animals 3811 animals 7.06%
The fertility rate of the 330 examined hydatid cysts selected from the overall slaughtered sheep was observed to be 18.18%, while 60.91% of the cysts were sterile, and 20.91% cysts were calcified as shown in Table 2 . Table 2 Number and type of hydatid cysts found in the liver of infected sheep ( n = 330) Type of hydatid cyst No. of hydatid cyst ( n = 330) Percent (%) Fertile cyst 60 18.18 Sterile 201 60.91 Calcified 69 20.91
Fertile cysts were exposed to a viability test where a drop of the residue containing the protoscoleces was observed microscopically on a glass slide covered with a cover slip to observe amoeboid-like peristaltic movements as shown in Fig. 1 . The invaginated protoscoleces in echinococcosis characterized by the presence of flame cells on the anterior portion and the posterior portion are covered with a knob-like projection with the dense cap as shown in Fig. 1a . While, evaginated protoscoleces have a thick tegument enclosing spongy parenchyma which contains calcareous corpuscles and with a double row of hooks as shown in Fig. 1b .

Regarding the biochemical examination of hydatid cyst fluid in fertile and infertile cysts, we found a very highly significant ( P < 0.001) difference between the levels of electrolytes as shown in Table 3 . Table 3 Electrolyte profiles of hydatid fluids from infected sheep with cystic echinococcosis ( n = 30) Electrolyte profile Infertile Fertile Calcium (mmol/l) 1.86 ± 0.14 13.24*** ± 0.46 Phosphorus (mmol/l) 1.49 ± 0.27 9.61*** ± 0.43 Sodium (mmol/l) 84.32 ± 1.33 71.51*** ± 1.00 Potassium (mmol/l) 9.49 ± 0.53 38.25*** ± 0.71 Chloride (mmol/l) 57.31 ± 0.94 59.59** ± 0.84 Iron (μmol/l) 0.59 ± 0.08 63.01*** ± 2.57 Data are expressed as (mean ± SEM) *** P < 0.001; ** P < 0.001 versus infertile group
On the other hand, the hydatid cyst fluid of fertile cyst showed a significant decrease in glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, and total protein levels as compared to the infertile hydatid cyst fluid. While, the hydatid cyst fluid of fertile cyst showed a significant elevation in alkaline phosphatase activity as compared to the infertile hydatid cyst fluid as shown in Table 4 .

Histopathological examination
Histopathological changes in liver sections showed fibrosis and massive necrotic hepatic cells near the cyst with dead scolices (Fig. 4a, b ). A large area of calcification appeared outside the cysts with hyalinization of the fibrous wall (Fig. 4c ), a small area of calcification inside the fibrous wall with marked hyalinization of the fibrous wall, and few inflammatory cell infiltrations (Fig. 4d ).

Discussion
Cystic Echinococcus is a chronic infectious disease that predominantly affects any organs such as the liver, lung, kidney, spleen, bone, and brain (Pakala et al. ). Cystic Echinococcus can exist unnoticed in livestock animals for years and only detected incidentally during meat check-up in abattoirs (Oryan et al. ). Clinical hydatidosis is exceptional in animals, but hydatid cysts in the liver and other tissues at slaughter are prevalent and cause conviction and economic loss.
Despite the intensified and continued efforts, cystic echinococcosis control is still a challenge. Therefore, it is crucial to survey this zoonosis and get updated data concerning the prevalence of cystic echinococcosis (CE) in animals in order to monitor its epidemiologic aspects. During the present study, the occurrence of CE in livestock at the Hail Municipal abattoirs was found to be 7.05%. Our finding was lower than those reported in Al-Baha, Al-Taif, and Jeddah at rates of 10.26, 12.91, and 42.43% respectively (Ibrahim ; Toulah et al. ; Hayajneh et al. ). This variation in prevalence of cystic echinococcosis inside Saudi Arabia could be attributed to many factors as differences in climate (mean temperature and mean rainfall), the time at which the studies took place, awareness, and the abundance of canine infected hosts in these different regions.
Regarding the fertility of cysts, the current study showed that 18.18% were fertile and the remaining 81.81% were infertile. The infertile cysts were classified as sterile (60.91%) and 20.90% were calcified. Our results are in agreement with the findings of Daryani et al. ( ) and Getachew et al. ( ).
This variation is most probably due to the complex geographical strain and fundamental biochemical and physiological variance, which may occur among different animal species all over the world (Azami et al. ). Also, Zemen et al. ( ), reported that a high percentage number of infertile cysts in the liver of sheep may be due to high reticuloendothelial cells and the abundant connective reaction of the liver which encapsulates the cyst within a dense fibrous wall.
With regard to staining techniques for confirmation of protoscoleces viability in fertile cysts, all staining techniques were used to check the movement and activity of flame cells. Protoscoleces with inactive flame cells or stained with eosin is considered dead. Our finding is in agreement with Yildirim et al. ( ) and Esfandiari ( ).
Hydatid cyst fluid is a combination of metabolic components derived from the parasite and host (Vuitton and Gottstein ). The quantitative variations in the metabolism of E. granulosus and in the biochemical contents of hydatid fluids vary within intermediate hosts (Radfar and Iranyar and Osman et al. ). Biochemical components inside hydatid cysts play a critical role in the metabolism, physiology, and immunology of hydatidosis (Li et al. and Osman et al. ).
Because of the little information about whether there are variations in the biochemical levels of components in hydatid cyst fluid of fertile cyst and hydatid cyst fluid of sterile cyst, the current study attempted to identify the biochemical variation between fertile and sterile hydatid cyst fluid.
In the present work, the fluid electrolyte profile showed an elevation of calcium, phosphorus, and iron ions in the fluid of fertile hydatid cysts compared to sterile ones in sheep livers. Our results are in agreement with Radfar and Iranyar ( ) and Kojouri and Moshtaghi ( ).
Calcium and phosphorus ions play important roles in preventing the acidity of hydatid cyst fluid, and they also found that, as a calcareous body in the cyst, the high level of calcium in cystic fluids may be due to the degenerative changes and calcification occurring in the cysts (Radfar and Iranyar ).
Regarding sodium, potassium, and chloride ions, our findings showed that there are significant differences between the level of these electrolytes in fertile and infertile cysts fluid where sodium level in the infertile cyst was higher than in the fertile ones.
Li et al. ( ) reported that the concentrations of electrolytes in hydatid cyst fluid vary between hosts. The concentration of sodium (Na + ) in the cyst fluid was approximately half that in healthy human serum, while the levels of potassium (K + ), Mg 2+ , and calcium (Ca 2+ ) were higher in the cyst fluid.
The entrances of essential electrolytes in the hydatid cyst fluid have depended on selective permeability and parasite requirement (Rahdar et al. ).
The present study revealed a significant decrease in fluid levels of glucose, total protein, cholesterol, and triglycerides of fertile hydatid cyst as compared to infertile ones. The presence of proteins and cholesterol in hydatid cyst is related to the degradation of parasitic membranes or protoscoleces, and its low level in the fluid of fertile hydatid cyst may be due to its use by the parasite. The present findings are consistent with those found by Osman et al. ( ) who reported that glucose occurrence indicated the presence of glycolysis cycle related to energy production with parasite cyst. Salwa et al. ( ) reported occurrence of glucose and triglycerides in hydatid cyst fluid in sheep.
Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is an enzyme which plays an important role in the metabolism, physiology, immunology, and nutrient absorption of the cystic echinococcosis (Shaafie et al. ). The current study showed a significant elevation in alkaline phosphatase activity of the fluid of fertile hydatid cyst as compared to the infertile hydatid cyst fluid. Karibozorg et al. ( ) reported that hydatid infection stimulates biliary cells to excrete ALP. So, a higher level of ALP activity could be considered as a pathological biomarker in hydatid cyst disease.
The incidence of biochemical components in hydatid cyst fluid may be due to the rapid diffusing properties of these components through the hydatid cyst membranes.
Pathological alterations detected in liver sections showed hepatocyte degeneration, and mass necrosis of hepatic cells near the cysts and protoscoleces was seen, as well as inflammatory cell infiltration and areas of calcification. Our findings are in accordance with Ahmedullah et al. ( ) and Singh et al. ( ) who reported that infection of food-producing animals with hydatid cysts revealed a considerable damage in parenchymal tissues of liver, and tissues around the cyst are solid because of the fibrous capsule that formed around the cyst with additional cellular interactions in the area surrounding the cyst. Also, the significant changes observed in liver sections were mainly attributed to the pressure effect employed by the hydatid cyst (Chen et al. ).
Conclusion
The prevalence of cystic Echinococcus in Hail area was at an overall rate of 7.06% and the majority of cysts in sheep were infertile; additionally, the biochemical analysis of HF could be helpful for the diagnosis of hepatic hydatid cysts which have a deleterious effect on morbidity and mortality in sheep. This study will be further useful for immunological studies; the genotyping of the circulating E. granulosus strains are crucial to monitor this important zoonosis and may be helpful to find various strains of E. granulosus in Hail region.
