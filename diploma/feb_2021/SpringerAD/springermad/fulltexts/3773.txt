Introduction
Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling is a successful computational model [ ] that offers the unique feature of mimicking human physiology to accurately simulate concentration–time profiles of candidate compounds in the blood (plasma/serum) or other biological fluids, organs and tissues [ ]. Since 2000, the model has been used to support decision-making [ ] during the different phases of drug discovery to select potential candidate compounds [ ] for clinical development [ ]. The applications of PBPK modeling in oncology drug development include the prediction of drug concentration–time profiles in animals [ , , , ], first-in-human (FIH) dose extrapolation [ , , , , ], phase II/III clinical trials [ , , , , , ], organ impairment [ , , ], dose adjustment in pediatrics [ , , , ] and drug–drug interactions (DDIs) [ , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ]. In addition, through simulating blood concentration–time profiles in a virtual population as an individual model (together with patient information, called “personalized medicine” [ , ]) or population-based model, the model helps to reduce the number of animals and human participants enrolled in nonclinical studies and clinical trials. PBPK modeling could be an alternative strategy by which to address the various difficulties encountered when conducting a clinical study of a anticancer drug during the early phases of drug development, particularly in healthy volunteers but also in phase I clinical trials involving cancer patients [ ].
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicine Agency (EMA) recently recommended that results from PBPK modeling can be used as supportive information for drug regulatory submissions [ , ]. Both regulatory agencies launched guidance for PBPK modeling in 2016 [ , ] to provide instructions on the relevant information required from PBPK modeling.
Several reviewed articles on PBPK modeling have been published in the past 10 years. However, only a few are focused on the development of oncology drugs [ , , ], and all provide a general overview of and the challenges associated with PBPK modeling without addressing prediction accuracy in each phase of drug development. The objective of this review is, therefore, to define the accuracy of PBPK model prediction and its utility throughout the phases of oncology drug development.
Methodology
Data sources and search
A systematic search was performed in the PubMed, Pub-Med-Central (PMC) and Cochrane Library databases for articles published in the English language using the following search terms: “physiologically based pharmacokinetic or PBPK modeling,” “anticancer,” “oncology,” antineoplastic,”, “cancer,“ and “tumor.” Additional handsearching was also performed in Google, using the search terms “physiologically based pharmacokinetics or PBPK modeling” and “cancer.” To obtain the maximum number of articles, we also searched the PubMed, PMC and Cochrane Library databases using the terms “physiologically based pharmacokinetics or PBPK modeling” + anticancer drugs in the U.S. National Institutes of Health anticancer drug lists.
Eligibility criteria
To be included in our review analysis each article had to meet the following criteria: (1) be published in English, (2) include a PBPK modeling application in cancer therapy, (3) report the area under the curve (AUC) values in the results or 90% confidence interval (CI) of the AUC of the observed or predicted value, (4) include an independent population validation (cross validation) and (5) report information on the mathematical equations for model construction.
Data extraction and data synthesis
The selected articles were categorized into six study types in accordance with the U.S. FDA guidance for pharmacokinetics in nonclinical and clinical drug development: (1) in vivo, (2) FIH, (3) phase II/III clinical trials, (4) organ impairment, (5) special population (pediatrics) and (6) DDIs. The predicted and observed AUC values reported in each article were extracted and compared for the accuracy of model prediction according to the equation: $$ AAFEs={10}^{\frac{\sum_{I=1}^n\left|\mathit{\log}\frac{prediction}{observation}\right|}{n}} $$ where prediction is the predicted AUC value from the model; observation is the observed AUC value from nonclinical or clinical studies; AAFEs are absolute-average-folding errors which are commonly used for the evaluation of PBPK modeling accuracy and represent the error between the observed and predicted values. There are no standard acceptance criteria of AAFEs, but most published articles suggest that the values should be within twofold [ , ].
Quality assessment
All authors (TS, KN and JK) evaluated the quality of an article following the U.S. FDA guidance for model performance evaluation (model validation: independent population) [ ].
Results
A total of 2341 articles published during January 1980 to February 2017 were retrieved from the electronic databases, and 40 articles were included for analysis (Fig. 1 ). The PBPK modeling articles included in the study together with the number of validated data, parameter adjustment and the accuracy of the data are described in Table 1 . Twenty-seven articles reported results from four types of small-molecule studies according to the Biopharmaceutic Classification System (BCS) (median AAFEs 1.17, range 1.07–1.39) [ , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ]; three articles reported findings from studies on small-molecule drugs that were unidentified [ , , ] and seven articles reported results from monoclonal antibody studies (median AAFEs 1.18, range 1.07–1.24) [ , , , , , , ]. Twenty-eight articles were on population-based simulations with an assessment of anthropometric variability, demographic variability, physiological variability and genetic polymorphisms [ , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ]. When these variables were incorporated into the models, the simulated results were able to explain the variability of the volume of distribution, drug clearance and drug concentrations in the population. Fourteen articles reported on a sensitivity analysis [ , , , , , , , , , , , , , ]. A summary of a model framework for the utility of PBPK modeling and its related parameters is given in Fig. 2 .

Quality of included studies
Cross-validation was performed in all included articles (independent population).
Application of PBPK modeling in vivo study
Of the 40 articles included in our systematic review, four reported the application of PBPK modeling in in vivo studies, with median AAFEs of the predicted AUC of 1.24 (range 1.20–1.55) [ , , , ]. Two, one and one articles reported the application of PBPK modeling in xenografted mice [ , ], rabbits [ ] and dogs [ ], respectively. These four studies are described in the following sections.
Brandhonneur et al. studied the utility of PBPK modeling in the prediction of methotrexate concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) ventricles in a rabbit model using the tissue composition-based model approach [ ]. The model was constructed with different compartments, such as richly/poorly vascularized organs and CSF ventricles. The AAFEs of the predicted AUC in the third ventricle after intrathecal administration was 1.26 [ ].
Bradshaw-Pierce et al. studied the applicability of PBPK modeling for determining docetaxel dose regimens following intraperitoneal administration [ ]. Using a known clinically relevant AUC in humans and PBPK modeling, these authors were able to determine the optimal dosage regimen in mice that would achieve plasma levels comparable to the human dose. The AAFEs of the predicted AUC in various doses varied from 1.55- to 1.88-fold [ ].
Gustafson et al. examined the effects of the ABCB1 transporter polymorphism on doxorubicin disposition using a PBPK model in dogs [ ]. The virtual dog population was simulated using both ABCB1 null (knockout type) and ABCB1 wild . The AAFEs of the predicted AUC in dogs carrying the wild-type allele following dosing of 30 mg/m 2 was 1.064. The concentration–time profiles in ABCB1 null mice following the three doses were simulated. The predicted plasma AUC was increased approximately by 25% for the ABCB1 null population, whereas the concentrations in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract had markedly accumulated by approximately 300% [ ].
The utility of PBPK modeling incorporated with key determinants of target-mediated disposition was proposed by Urva et al. to predict the concentrations of two types of monoclonal antibody (mAb) (T84.66 anti-CEA mAb and 8C2) in two tumor-bearing mouse models (LS174T and HT-29) [ ]. Three different doses of T84.66 anti-CEA mAb were evaluated. The AAFEs of the predicted AUC for all doses in mouse models LS174T and HT-29 ranged from 1- to 1.22-fold. The AAFEs of the predicted AUC of 8C2 (topotecan) in the HT-29 model for all doses ranged from 1.03- to 1.71-fold. In the study of Abuqayyas and Balthasar, the pharmacodynamics (PD) model was incorporated with PBPK (PBPK-PD model), and the efficacy of both drugs on the growth of both tumor types was predicted [ ].
Application of PBPK modeling in FIH study
Five articles included in our systematic review reported the application of PBPK modeling in FIH studies [ , , , , ]. Of the four studies reporting the AUC, the median AAFEs of the predicted AUC for all studies was 1.25 (range 1.15–1.39) [ , , , ]. The 90% CI was reported in one study [ ]. Prediction of clearance (CL) in human subjects is the key feature to predict blood concentration–time profiles for the establishment of FIH. Of these five articles, three reported studies on the application of clearance approaches in the respective PBPK modeling studies [ , , , ].
Youwei et al. used the top–down clearance approach to predict gefitinib disposition in healthy volunteers following the administration of two doses [ ]. The AAFEs of the predicted AUC values for all compartments in mice were within 1.3-fold of the observed values. The observed AUC values in the human volunteers were within 90% CI of the predicted AUC values [ ].
Takahashi et al. reported the applicability of the in vitro/in vivo to human extrapolation (IVIVE) model using the recombinant cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme approach to predict cobimetinib disposition in healthy volunteers [ ]. The AAFEs of the predicted AUC values were 1.18 [ ]. Bradshaw-Pierce et al. applied the IVIVE model to predict docetaxel disposition in human subjects [ ], using human liver microsomes to predict intrinsic CL (CL int ). The AAFEs of the predicted AUC in various doses fell within 1.2-fold range, and the AAFEs of the predicted CL in various doses fell within 1.3-fold [ ].
Chen et al. demonstrated the allometric scaling CL approach to predict deoxypodophyllotoxin disposition in human subjects [ ]. Clearance was calculated from body weight, and the exponent allometric scaling function was set to 0.75. Four animal species were used in this study with different dose regimens. The AAFEs of the predicted AUC and CL for all species fell within 1.5-fold [ ].
Application of PBPK modeling in phase II/III clinical trials
Nine articles described phase II/III clinical trials [ , , , , , , , , ]. The model accuracy in five of these studies was reported as AAFEs [ , , , , , ], and that in 4 studies was reported as the 90% CI of the observed value [ , , ]. Median AAFEs of the predicted AUC was 1.27-fold (range 1.07–1.42) [ , , , , , ]. All articles except one [ ] reported the predicted AUC values to be within 90% CI of the observed values.
Of these nine studies, three had physiological parameters adjusted in accordance with age-related changes and/or physiological changes in cancer patient populations. The AAFEs of the predicted AUC in this group was 1.25 (range 1.24–1.27) [ , , ]. Interestingly, a similar AAFE of the predicted AUC of the physiologically non-adjusted model was obtained, i.e.1.24 (range 1.07–1.42). However, in one of the six studies applying the physiologically non-adjusted model the predicted results were not well predicted with the observed values [ ].
Xia et al. studied the applicability of age-related physiological changes in Japanese and Caucasian subjects using a module in GastroPlus™ (Simulations Plus, Inc., Lancaster, CA, USA) based on patient information. The AAFEs of the predicted AUC for Caucasian and Japanese subjects were 1.27 (range 1.03–1.32) and 1.32 (range 1.26–1.35), respectively [ ]. Adjustment of individual patient information (e.g. receptor concentration, the release rate of drug, tumor volume, binding rate and glomerular filtration rate [GFR]) was applied in two studies. The AAFEs of the predicted AUC in both studies fell within 1.3-fold [ , ].
Application of PBPK modeling in organ impairment
Three 40 articles reported the application of PBPK modeling in organ impairment [ , , ]. The median AAFEs of the predicted AUC fell within 1.15-fold (range 1–1.36). One and two and one articles applied PBPK modeling in hepatic [ ] and renal [ , ] impairment, respectively.
Regarding renal impairment, Lu et al. studied the application of PBPK modeling in the prediction of the AUC of orteronel (renal excretion) following a single oral dose of 400 mg in healthy subjects and in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment by adjusting the GFR [ ]. The model was built using the Simcyp population-based simulator (Certara®, Princeton, NJ, USA). The AAFEs of the predicted AUC ratio for patients with moderate and severe renal impairment were 1.101 and 0.978, respectively [ ]. Tan et al. studied crizotinib (non-renal excretion) in patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive non-small cell lung cancer with severe renal impairment [ ]. The AAFEs of the predicted AUC was 1.12 [ ].
Regarding liver impairment, Hudachek et al. utilized the PBPK model to predict lapatinib disposition in patients with solid malignancies [ ]. The first-order hepatic metabolism was adjusted with regard to the reduction of liver function in hepatic impairment. The AAFEs of the predicted AUC for both groups of patients were 1.36 and 1.31, respectively [ ].
Application in the special population (pediatrics)
Four articles reported findings in pediatric studies, with one study reporting both AAFEs and the 90% CI, and one and two studies reporting AAFEs and the 90% CI, respectively. The AAFEs of the predicted AUC and/or 90% CI reported in all studies were within 1.5-fold and within the 90% CI of the observed/predicted values [ ]. Median AAFEs of the predicted AUC for this pediatric population was 1.22 (range 1.19–1.38) [ , , ].
Diestelhorst et al. studied the application of PBPK modeling on busulfan doses in various age groups [ ]. Drug metabolism and clearance were extrapolated from adults using age-dependent changes in enzyme concentration (ontogeny and enzyme maturation). The AAFEs of the predicted AUC for all age groups were 1.14 (range 1.1–1.19) [ ].
Walsh et al. studied the utilization of PBPK modeling to predict actinomycin D drug disposition in different age groups [ ]. The effects of biliary and renal clearance were included in model construction, and adult data of both clearances were used without the incorporation of ontogeny effects. Plasma AUCs of actinomycin D following different intravenous infusion doses were simulated using a virtual population of 100. The AAFEs of the predicted AUC for all age groups was 1.21 (range 1.09–1.54) [ ].
Thai et al. optimized docetaxel dosage regimens in pediatric patients with different types of cancer by extrapolating from adult data [ ]. The first model was developed based on adult cancer patients using Simcyp® and accounted for age-dependent physiological changes in children, including ontogeny effects based on the healthy pediatric information. The AAFEs of the predicted AUC ranged from 1.1 to 1.54 [ ].
Ogungbenro et al. predicted plasma concentration–time profiles of 6-mercaptopurine taking into account the role of genetic polymorphism of thiopurine methyltransferase enzyme activity in the pediatric population and age-related physiological changes [ ]. The observed AUC for the parent drug and metabolites according to age ranged between 1 and 18 years and were within 90% CI of the predicted values [ ].
Application in DDI studies
Fifteen articles reported the application of PBPK modeling in DDIs with various mechanisms, including reversible inhibition (RI), mechanism-based inhibition (MBI), time-dependent inhibition (TDI) or irreversible inhibition, and enzyme induction (EI) [ , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ]. Median AAFEs of the predicted AUC ratio for all 15 DDI studies was 1.08 (range 1.0–1.17). The types of DDIs in these articles were classified based on the U.S. FDA guidance. Median AAFEs of the predicted AUC ratio for RI ( n = 2) was 1.06 (range 1.01–1.11) [ , ]. The predicted values for TDI ( n = 2) was 1.015 (range 1.00–1.03) [ , ]; for EI ( n = 2), 1.15 (range 1.14–1.17) [ , ]; for TDI and EI ( n = 5), 1.11 (range 1.07–1.15) [ , , , , ]; for TDI, EI and RI ( n = 2), 1.07 (range 1.06–1.08) [ , ]. Two studies did not report the type of inhibition and/or induction [ , ]. In addition, PBPK modeling was applied to evaluate the DDI studies in phase II metabolizing enzymes [ ], transporters [ , ], the effect of therapeutic proteins on CYP450 enzymes [ ], the effect of phenotype polymorphism [ , ] and the effect of metabolites on parent drug [ , ]. Median AAFEs of the predicted AUC ratio of those applications fell within 1.2-fold [ , , , , ] or within the 90% CI of the predicted values [ , ]. Of the 15 articles, six applied PBPK modeling to further predict DDIs (untested scenario: predicted results without clinical data validation) in weak and moderate CYP3A inhibitors [ , , , , ], moderate CYP2C8 inhibitors [ ] and weak, moderate and strong CYP3A inducers [ , ], while the AAFEs of the predicted AUCR for strong CYP3A inhibitors and/or strong CYP3A inducers fell within 1.2-fold [ , , , , , , ].
Discussion
The increasing number of PBPK modeling applications in oncology drug studies indicates the applicability of PBPK modeling and its impact on drug discovery and development processes. However, there is limited evidence to support the accuracy of the predictions of PBPK modeling. This systematic review is the first article that defines the accuracy of PBPK modeling prediction (from 40 studies) and its utility in oncology drug development. AAFEs of the predicted AUC and AUC ratio from studies in this review were within twofold, which is an acceptable level of accuracy [ , ]. However, a study by Poulin et al. showed that the predictive ability of PBPK modeling ranged from high-to-medium accuracy (two- to three-folds), with a 69% for intravenous (total = 18) drugs, and 23% for oral drugs (total = 95) [ ]. However, the model assumptions in that study were limited to hepatic clearance and perfusion-limited equation, and as such they may not be suitable for all drug cases, such as drugs with intestinal and/or renal clearance. Therefore, the reported accuracy may vary. While the results of the study suggest that the clearance approach and tissue-to-plasma partition coefficient approach played a pivotal role in the predictive accuracy [ ], those of another study demonstrate that a different approach has no effect on FIH dose prediction [ ]. Future studies should address this discrepancy.
The studies included in this systematic review cover both small-molecule drugs and mAbs in different phases of drug development. The results suggest that PBPK modeling has the potential to play a major role in future anticancer drug development. In addition, this strategy can also be a useful tool in personalized medicine for dose optimization in cancer patients with hepatic and renal impairment [ , ]. However, the mAb has unique mechanisms and is not yet well understood (e.g. transportation rate across capillary, catabolism rate and the rate of target turnover) [ ]. These factors remain challenges to the successful application of PBPK modeling.
Another challenge is the development of novel PBPK models and a user-friendly interface for clinicians. Incorporating anthropometric variability, demographic variability, physiological variability and genetic polymorphism in a PBPK-population (pop)-PK construction can provide a better prediction and a better description of drug disposition variability than the conventional pop-PK modeling [ ]. Furthermore, the utilization of PBPK-pop-PK modeling with a virtual population can reduce the number of participants who need to be enrolled in clinical trials.
The results from this review demonstrate the unique application of in vivo PBPK modeling for the prediction of drug concentration in various tissues, such as the CSF, GI tract or tumor, in addition to its concentration in blood/plasma. The ability to predict concentrations in other tissues would allow the treating physician to predict drug actions, such as efficacy and side effects, and this information would facilitate dose adjustment [ , ]. The implications of this ability were demonstrated in a human study where the model predicted the efficacy of capecitabine (pro-drug of fluorouracil at a tumor site and its side effects in the GI tract [ ].
A unique application of PBPK modeling in FIH studies is the ability to predict the FIH dose through the prediction of human drug clearance, particularly when no human data are available. As seen from the studies in this review [ , , , , ], the bottom–up approach (IVIVE) is appropriate to predict drug clearance in the initial phase of drug development. However, the use of PBPK modeling to predict the FIH dose is more reliable and reasonable over conventional approaches. The construction of a PBPK model is based on human physiology and in vitro data using human liver microsomes or human hepatocytes or recombinant CYP450 enzymes, while conventional approaches rely only on the toxicity of animal models. The clearance of small molecules can be predicted using the allometric scaling approach. However, this approach is still questionable when applied for the predication of mAb, and further studies to standardize scaling factor values are needed [ ].
A unique application of PBPK modeling in phase II/III clinical trials is the adjustment of physiological parameters in accordance with pathological changes in patients. Physiological changes and their alterations in cancer patients, particularly in the elderly patient population, such as changes in body composition, absorption, plasma protein binding and activities of drug-metabolizing enzymes, can influence drug disposition [ , , , , , ]. In this review, the limited data available on physiological adjustment and non-adjustment yielded good prediction accuracy. However, one study without adjustment was not well predicted [ ]. Further studies may be needed to clarify the role of physiological adjustment in cancer patients. Although pathophysiological changes in cancer patients can be adjusted using PBPK modeling, databases of cancer patients (e.g. absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) are limited, possibly due to issues of intellectual property in each commercial program or inadequate data in the certain type of cancer. Accordingly, database sharing should be encouraged to facilitate the use of PBPK modeling and to improve the reliability of PBPK modeling.
A unique application of PBPK modeling in organ impairment is the adjustment of pathological changes in patients, such as GFR, metabolism rate and plasma protein binding. The utility of PBPK modeling in hepatic impairment was included in the EMA guidance [ ], and the use of PBPK modeling in renal impairment will be included in the next revision [ ]. The prevalence of renal [ ] and hepatic impairment [ ], which may influence drug disposition, is high in patients with cancer [ , , , ]. Thus, dose adjustment is deemed essential. Based on the studies included in this review, PBPK modeling yields good prediction accuracy in cancer patients with renal and hepatic impairment.
Further, a unique application of PBPK modeling in DDIs is the ability to assess DDIs in the untested scenario [ ]. A request to waive the requirement for a clinical study can be made for drugs which are moderate inhibitors of CYP450 when the model prediction for strong inhibitors demonstrates a good correspondence with clinical data [ ]. In this review, PBPK modeling was found to assist in DDI assessment in both healthy and patients in phase I/II metabolizing enzymes and transporters for both small-molecule drugs (parent drugs and metabolites) and therapeutic protein with good prediction. However, enzyme expressions for different phenotypes of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 should be assessed for model prediction [ ].
In 2014, the role of PBPK modeling in drug registration has been discussed by various regulatory agencies, including the U.S. FDA and the Ministerial Industry Strategy Group (MISG)/Association of British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI)/Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) [ ]. Both the U.S. FDA and MHRA agreed with the application of PBPK modeling on DDI studies for CYP-mediated DDIs, but not for transporter-mediated DDIs, non-CYP-mediated DDIs, and DDIs in the GI tract as more data are still needed [ , ]. The U.S. FDA may accept the data from PBPK modeling to supplement the prediction of dose selection in FIH studies when there is inadequate data from the other methods [ ]. In pediatrics, dose prediction could be acceptable in patients aged > 2 years but not < 2 years where the incorporation of ontogeny and maturation effects in model construction are needed [ ]. The application of PBPK modeling in hepatic impairment and renal impairment is not yet well recognized by the U.S. FDA, but there is a need to gather more information to support its use [ ]. The existing guidance does not provide standard acceptance criteria for prediction performance or the standard methodology for different model constructions. Among the studies included in this review the methodologies used in PBPK development modeling were varied. Determination of standard acceptance criteria and methodologies for model construction and experiments may be necessary for future PBPK modeling development to provide a better reliability and accuracy of the prediction.
We selected the AUC to represent the model accuracy because it was the PK parameter most commonly used in the majority of published studies included in our review, while values for other PK parameters, such as maximum (peak) concentration © max ), time required to reach to C max (T max ), clearance and apparent volume of distribution at steady state (V ss ), were not readily available. The AUC does not represent the accuracy of the shape of plasma concentration–time profiles, but it can reflect the clearance. An overestimated AUC may result in an underestimated clearance, such as for intestinal clearance and/or hepatic clearance. This review includes a limited number of studies for some phases. It is therefore not possible to compare the accuracy of different approaches/methodologies, such as physiological adjustment in cancer patients and clearance methods in FIH, among others. The limited number of publications on unsuccessful model application may contribute to a bias toward the usefulness of PBPK modeling. Nevertheless, our assessment of the amount of validated data in each article together with the model adjustment could lessen the effects of bias (Table 1 ).
Conclusion
Physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling is a potential mathematical tool which can be effectively applied throughout the different phases of oncology drug development. The number of experimental animals and human participants enrolled such studies can be reduced using PBPK modeling and PBPK-pop-PK. However, the differences in experimental methodologies, clearance approaches and other model constructions, including model accuracy, should be standardized to further improve model reliability. Limited publications of unsuccessful model application may contribute to a bias toward the usefulness of PBPK modeling.
