Highlights
Optimal dosing of 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (4F-PCC) for warfarin reversal is unknown We compared manufacturer-recommended dosing to reduced dosing of 4F-PCC in warfarin treated patients Manufacturer-recommended dosing improved rates of INR reversal but not hemostatic efficacy Reduced dosing of 4F-PCC may result in less harmful thromboembolic events with similar clinical outcomes
Introduction
Warfarin has a narrow therapeutic window and clinicians must balance the risk of hemorrhage and thromboembolic events. Despite the risks of warfarin-associated hemorrhage, one major advantage of warfarin over newer, target specific oral anticoagulants is the ability to reverse the medication’s effects predictably and reliably. Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) has several advantages over fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K in that it is a low-volume solution that can be rapidly reconstituted and infused with immediate effect. In the event of life-threatening hemorrhage or for urgent surgical intervention, 4-factor PCC (4F-PCC) has been shown to be superior to FFP for the outcome of rapid INR reversal [ , ], and although increased hemostatic efficacy has not been clearly demonstrated, 4F-PCC has become the recommended first-line therapy for rapid warfarin reversal in major society guidelines and consensus documents [ , , ].
Despite these guideline-based recommendations, the optimal dose of 4F-PCC required to achieve effective hemostasis remains unclear. In the selection of dosing recommendations by the manufacturers of 4F-PCC, these agents are considered blood products by regulatory agencies and therefore dose-finding (Phase I) studies have not been conducted. While low doses may risk a lack of effectiveness, several studies of low, fixed-dose strategies of alternative 4F-PCCs have yielded successful outcomes [ , , , ]. To date, no published studies have evaluated the efficacy and safety of the 4F-PCC product available in the United States, Kcentra®, when utilized with a low dose weight-based dosing strategy as compared to manufacturer-recommended dosing regimen recommended by the manufacturer. In 2015, our institution revised its clinical practice guideline to eliminate the manufacturer-recommended 35 and 50 units/kg doses of Kcentra® out of concern for thrombotic events [ ]. Furthermore, our experience using a low-dose 4F-PCC for warfarin reversal in the setting of central nervous system (CNS) hemorrhage suggested that lower doses of 4F-PCC may be effective for warfarin reversal across many INR ranges [ ].
In this retrospective observational study of patients that receive 4F-PCC, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of a low-dose strategy compared to dosing recommended by the manufacturer of 4F-PCC. We hypothesized that a more conservative dosing regimen of 4F-PCC is adequate for warfarin reversal and may reduce the risk of thrombotic events.
Methods
All adult patients (≥ 18 years of age) presenting with warfarin-associated bleeding or need for surgical intervention or procedure to our institution between November 2013 and January 2017 were evaluated for inclusion in the study. The manufacturer-recommended dosing group consisted of patients presenting between November 2013 and May 2015 when our institution used the dosing strategy recommended by the manufacturer. The low-dose group consisted of patients presenting between May 2015 and January 2017 that were treated according to our modified dosing protocol (Fig. 1 ). Patients were excluded if they had received 4F-PCC for coagulopathy secondary to liver disease or a non-warfarin oral anticoagulant, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), surgical coagulopathy not related to anticoagulant administration, and patients without follow-up imaging or testing of INR due to withdrawal of care. Patients presenting with CNS and non-CNS hemorrhage were specified as pre-defined subgroups. For patients presenting with CNS-related hemorrhage, an INR cut-off of 2.0 was used to determine low versus moderate dose (INR 1.6–1.9 received 15 units/kg while INR ≥ 2.0 received 25 units/kg). For the non-CNS subgroup we chose an INR cut-off of 4 to determine whether a patient would receive a low dose (15 units/kg) or a moderate dose (25 units/kg) of 4F-PCC.

The primary effectiveness outcome was effective clinical response within 24 h and a target INR achieved upon first check after receipt of 4F-PCC. Effective clinical response was defined by the criteria and definitions developed by the subcommittee on the control of anticoagulation in the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis [ ]. Non-CNS-related hemorrhage was assessed independently in a retrospective manner by two investigators (WZ and BC), specifically reviewing timing of hemoglobin decrease from baseline through 48 h, administration of further blood products or hemostatic agents, and the ability to perform invasive procedures without excessive bleeding from chart notes. In the event of disagreement or uncertainty, a third investigator (KS) reviewed the case in question and consensus was achieved among the three investigators. In the case of warfarin reversal for CNS-related hemorrhage, hematoma expansion was defined as > 33% increase in interval size within 48 h, using the ABC/2 method [ ] and was assessed by a neurointensivist blinded to patient characteristics and outcomes. Target INR was defined as < 1.6 for CNS-related bleeding and < 2.0 for non-CNS bleeding and for surgical reversal. Secondary effectiveness outcomes included frequency of repeat dosing of 4F-PCC and achievement of the target INR at 24 h after reversal. The primary safety outcome was the incidence of PCC-related thromboembolic adverse events (TAE) within 72 h of 4F-PCC administration. Additional safety outcomes included TAE occurring within 30 days of 4F-PCC administration.
Normally distributed data are presented as mean (± SD) and comparisons between groups were made using the Student’s t-test. Non-normally distributed data are presented as median (interquartile range; IQR) and comparisons were conducted using the Mann–Whitney U test. Categorical data are presented as frequency and comparisons were made using Chi square test or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. Statistical analysis was done using SAS plug-in for Microsoft Office version 5.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). This study was deemed exempt from review by the local institutional review board.
Results
A total of 240 patients received 4F-PCC over the 62 month period, with 134 patients receiving dosing according to the package-insert recommendation and 106 patients receiving dosing according to the reduced-dose strategy (Fig. 2 ). Of these, 26 patients (12 in manufacturer-recommended dose group, 23 in low dose group) were excluded due to the receipt of 4F-PCC for non-warfarin reversal indications. The final treatment group consisted of 122 patients in the manufacturer-recommended dose group and 83 patients in the low-dose group.
Fig. 2 Patient selection
Baseline patient characteristics are presented in Table 1 . The patient groups were well matched for age, gender, and body weight. The majority of patients were receiving warfarin therapy for atrial fibrillation (68% in manufacturer-recommended dose group versus 71.1% in the low dose group) and received 4F-PCC for a CNS-related bleed indication (59% in both groups). Distribution of presenting INR was similar between both groups, with a majority of the patients in both groups presenting with an INR between 2.0 and 3.9 (60.7% vs. 63.9%, p = 0.643). Characteristics of reversal treatments are shown in Table 2 . The mean dose of 4F-PCC was significantly higher in the manufacturer-recommended dose group compared to the low dose group, 2132 ± 907 and 1530 ± 504, respectively (p < 0.001) (Fig. 3 ). The administration of vitamin K was similar in both groups (96.7 and 95.2%) as was the administration of additional blood products (32.8% vs. 21.7%, p = 0.083). There was no difference in the need for repeat 4F-PCC administration between the two groups (1.6% vs. 1.2%). Although not statistically significant, there was a numerical trend to higher administration of red blood cells (23.8% vs. 13.3%, p = 0.073) and fresh frozen plasma (20.5% vs. 9.6%, p = 0.052) in the manufacturer-recommended dose group compared to low dose. Significantly more patients received transfusions of platelets (12.3% vs. 1.2%, p = 0.003) and cryoprecipitate (8.2% vs. 1.2%, p = 0.03) in the manufacturer-recommended dose group.

Overall, fewer patients met the primary outcome in the low-dose group compared to the manufacturer-recommended dose group, (61.4% vs. 75.4%, p = 0.033) (Table 3 ). There was no difference in rates of effective clinical response between the two groups (79.5% vs. 74.7%, p = 0.418); however, more patients in the manufacturer-recommended dose group achieved their INR target at first repeat check (95.9% vs. 84.3%, p = 0.005). More patients presenting with CNS bleeding (94.4% vs. 81.6%, p = 0.036) or with a baseline INR > 4 (100% vs. 80.9%, p = 0.026) also achieved the target INR on first check in the manufacturer-recommended dose group compared to the low-dose group. There was no difference in overall INR goal achievement between the two groups with 98.4% vs. 94%, (p = 0.122) of patients achieving the INR goal at 24 h. There was no significant difference for the safety outcomes of thromboembolic events within 72 h (4.1% manufacturer-recommended vs. 1.2% low, p = 0.404) or at 30 days (8.2% manufacturer-recommended vs. 4.8% low, p = 0.409). The type of early thromboembolic events in the five manufacturer-recommended dose patients were: 2 ischemic strokes, 1 ST-elevation myocardial infarction, 1 Non ST-segment myocardial infarction, and 1 new deep vein thrombosis. In the low-dose group, the one early thromboembolic event that occurred was a superficial vein thrombosis developing in the setting of a venous access device. More patients in the manufacturer-recommended dose group died or were transferred to hospice care during hospitalization (21.3% vs. 9.6%, p = 0.027).

Tables 4 and 5 describe the subgroups of patients with CNS and Non-CNS bleeding. For CNS bleeding, the majority of the patients presented with subdural hematoma (48.6 and 46.9%) or intracerebral hemorrhage (33.3 and 32.7%). In the manufacturer-recommended dose group, more patients achieved target INR at first check (94.4% vs. 81.6%, p = 0.036), but not at 24 h after 4F-PCC administration (97.2% vs. 89.8%, p = 0.118). There was no difference in the rate of hematoma expansion (5.6% vs. 14.3%, p = 0.118) or hemostatic efficacy (90.3% vs. 85.7%) between the two groups. For patients with non-CNS bleeding, all patients achieved target INR on first check, target INR at 24 h, and hemostatic efficacy in both treatment groups.

Discussion
Utilization of a low-dose 4F-PCC strategy resulted in fewer patients achieving the primary outcome of hemostatic efficacy and target INR achieved on first repeat check. This was primarily influenced by INR reversal on first check as more patients in the manufacturer-recommended dose group reached the goal (95.9%) compared to the low dose group (84.3%). Additionally, more patients presenting with CNS hemorrhage or with a baseline INR > 4 achieved the target INR in the manufacturer-recommended dose group than the low-dose group. Despite these differences, effective clinical response was similar in all patients and across all subgroups of patients, and survival was better in the low-dose 4F-PCC group despite a higher rate of incomplete INR normalization.
The use of a fixed dose dosing strategy for 4F-PCC products compared to INR/weight based dosing has previously demonstrated similar results for both INR reversal and clinical response [ ], clinical response but not INR reversal [ , ], and for INR reversal alone [ , , , , ]. Similar to prior studies, we found that our low-dose 4F-PCC strategy was less likely to achieve the target INR reversal compared to the manufacturer-recommended dose strategy, especially in patients with CNS-related hemorrhage or with a baseline INR > 4, though there was no difference in effective clinical response. In a study conducted by Abdoellakhan and colleagues [ ] examining a variable dose versus fixed dose strategy of 4F-PCC administration in patients with intracranial hemorrhage, the fixed dose was not as successful at INR reversal, especially in patients with a baseline INR > 4. In our low-dose protocol, the dose of 4F-PCC in patients with CNS related bleeding was not different than our manufacturer-recommended dose group unless the presenting INR was ≥ 4, therefore the findings of a lower achievement of target INR in CNS related bleeding is interesting. Although not statistically different, there was a numerically higher number of patients in the manufacturer-recommended dose group presenting with an INR > 4 which would have received 35 units/kg instead of 25 units/kg, which may explain the difference in target INR achievement when pooled with patients across all INR ranges. In addition, a significantly higher dose of vitamin K was administered in the manufacturer-recommended dose group compared to the low dose group (7 ± 3.1 vs. 5.1 ± 1.9, p < 0.001) as well as a significantly longer time to repeat INR (1.1 [0.75, 2.75] h vs. 1.0 [0.72, 1.25] h, p = 0.019) both of which may have contributed to achievement of the goal INR.
In patients presenting with warfarin-associated hemorrhage, target INR achievement alone has not been shown to improve clinical outcomes. The randomized trial comparing 4F-PCC to FFP for warfarin associated hemorrhage also showed similar results with 4F-PCC correcting INR faster with no difference in hemostatic efficacy or mortality at 30 days [ ]. In an early retrospective study comparing PCC to FFP in intracranial hemorrhage, PCC was shown to more rapidly correct the INR but failed to show a benefit in reducing mortality [ ]. Most recently, a large retrospective analysis of patients presenting with warfarin-related ICH showed that INR reversal to < 1.3 was linked to lower rates of hematoma expansion compared to higher INR values [ ]. Following this study, the INCH trial [ ], demonstrated that 4F-PCC was superior at achieving the primary outcome of INR reduction to a goal < 1.3 within 3 h (67% for 4F-PCC vs. 9% for FFP, p < 0.001). Even with achievement of this INR goal, hematoma expansion still occurred in 44% of patients at 3 h and in 30% of patients at 24 h when treated with 4F-PCC, much higher than the 9.1% overall rate we saw in our study (5.6% in manufacturer-recommended dose group and 14.3% in low dose group). Additionally, the INCH trial showed no difference in any of the functional outcomes assessed as secondary endpoints. In our study we did not find a statistically different frequency of hematoma expansion between both patient groups, even with a higher target INR (< 1.6). We did see a numerically higher rate of hematoma expansion in the low-dose group; however, each patient with hematoma expansion achieved the target INR upon first check in both groups, suggesting that hematoma expansion is multifactorial and not simply related to INR reversal.
The decision of our institution to use a low-dose 4F-PCC strategy for warfarin reversal was driven by adverse events following the administration of higher doses of 4F-PCC [ ]. Analyses of randomized trials with the 4F-PCC available in the United States has shown a rate of thromboembolic events of 7.3%, similar to the 6.8% demonstrated in this study (15 events in 205 patients). Further, we saw a numerically higher rate of events within 72 h of administration in the manufacturer-recommended dose group (5 events [4.1%] vs. 1 event [1.2%], p = 0.404) with the types of thrombotic events within 72 h being less severe than those in the manufacturer-recommended dose group.
The findings of our study should be considered within the context of its limitations. First this was a retrospective analysis of existing documentation and medical records, therefore we cannot exclude errors or omissions in documentation. Second there was reduced usage of 4F-PCC in the low-dose group over the same period of time. This was attributed to changes made to the ordering process within the electronic record, significant stewardship of dosing and appropriateness of use following adverse events with higher doses, and a heightened sense of potential risk among the medical staff. Third the majority of patients presented with an INR between 2.0 and 3.9. Our protocol change did not alter doses within this range for either reversal indication but significantly reduced the dosing for patients presenting with an INR ≥ 4, thus likely underrepresenting the true impact of a low-dose strategy in patients presenting with higher INR values. A much larger study examining low doses in this range of presenting INRs is required to further establish this dosing strategy. Finally, because the study evaluated two different time periods during which more elements of care than simply 4F-PCC dosing may have changed, it is impossible to exclude the confounding effects of changing standards of care in our patient outcomes.
Conclusions
Utilization of a low-dose 4F-PCC reversal strategy for reversal of warfarin related bleeding resulted in fewer patients meeting the outcome of INR reversal following 4F-PCC plus effective clinical response, but also a numerically lower rate of thromboembolic events within 72 h. Despite this incomplete reversal of INR, patients that had received low-dose 4F-PCC had lower mortality. Further examination of low-dose 4F-PCC strategies in larger trials is warranted.
