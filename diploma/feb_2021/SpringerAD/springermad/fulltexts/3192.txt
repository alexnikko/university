Introduction
Tablets are the most popular dosage form in the pharmaceutical industry and also require stringent process controls. A key challenge in tablet processing is to achieve adequate powder flow, either from the hopper into the tablet press or from the feed frame into the compression die. Hopper flow failure modes include “rat holing” (when the center of a bulk of powder in a hopper flows, but the sides do not) or “bridging” (when powder binds to itself in the hopper forming a barrier that prohibits powder from moving). Tablet press flow failures can occur in both low-pressure conditions, where powders are aerated and flow mostly due to gravity and high-pressure conditions where powders are consolidated under high compressive stress. Low-pressure flow failures can include poor tablet weight uniformity (representing inconsistent flow of powders into tablet die cavities) and powder segregation (leading to poor unit dose uniformity). High-pressure flow failures can include exceptionally large ejection stresses, tablet capping/delamination, and tablet picking and sticking.
Many different tests have been developed to characterize “good” powder flow vs “poor” powder flow. Geldart et al. [ ] explored the impact of particle size on angle of repose and powder cohesion in various gradations of alumina powder and found a strong correlation between all three measurements. Traina et al. [ ] utilized bulk and tap density measurements to determine dynamical compression properties on a broad range of granular materials including ceramics and pharmaceutical materials. The results showed a definitive ability to discriminate between these significantly different powders. Emery et al. [ ] examined the effect of moisture content on properties such as Carr index, Hausner ratio, angle of repose, and Jenike shear index for pharmaceutical powders. Results ranged from no measureable effect to qualitative trends. Thalberg et al. [ ] studied modified Hausner ratio and angle of repose for ordered mixtures of inhalable lactose powders and found a strong correlation between these powder flow characteristics and the ordered mixture compositions. In recent years, powder rheometers have been used to gather reproducible information for individual powders. M. Leturia et al. [ ] investigated the effects of state of compaction and bed voidage on bulk solid flowability utilizing standardized methods provided by the FT4 Powder Rheometer. Their findings indicated an ability to discriminate between different powders and ordered mixtures of carbon and metal oxide, but the results were difficult to interpret due to physical powder phenomena and environmental parameters.
Shah et al. [ ] determined that powder rheometers were much more discriminating than traditional tests such as bulk/tap density/angle of repose for studying minor variations in lubrication grades in equivalent mixtures. S.V. Søgaard et al. [ ] studied the effects of powder consolidation during shear and wall friction testing. They concluded that powder flow properties depend strongly on consolidation stresses during testing, and testing methods should accurately mimic stresses found in manufacturing processes in order to not overestimate the flowability of a powder.
In addition to more traditional test methods, various other tests have been adapted to characterize powder flow. Zhao et al. [ ] explored the use of the Gurnham index (a measure of the effect a change in pressure has on a powder’s porosity) as a means of characterizing powder compression. Their work indicated that the Gurnham index could provide a quantitative description of material compressibility for single-component materials and more complex mixtures.
For many powders, one of these methods is capable of discriminating between two or more different grades of excipients or mixtures, and the experimental work has focused on demonstrating method robustness, reproducibility, and discriminating ability between powders that flow “well” vs “poorly.” While these previous studies explain the effectiveness of various tests of powder flowability, they compare measures of flowability to heuristic ranges rather than determining if the powders would provide acceptable flow in tablet manufacturing or other downstream processes. In this work, powders were not only subjected to a range of small-scale powder flow characterization tests but also downstream processed to produce tablets on a commercial-scale rotary tablet press. Observations were recorded regarding the downstream performance of each powder and qualitatively compared to the small-scale powder characterization results.
Materials
A common base unit formula was utilized for all testing. The base formula contained a 1:1 ratio of microcrystalline cellulose PH102 (FMC) to mannitol SD100 (Roquette) with 5 % sodium croscarmellose (FMC), abbreviated “NaCMC” and 0.5 % magnesium stearate (Mallinckrodt). To simulate poorly flowing API, four common pharmaceutical excipients known to be relatively poor flowing were added to the base unit formula. These poorly flowing excipients are referred heretofore as “pseudo-APIs.”
These include starch 1500 (National), crystalline mannitol (Pearlitol 25C, Roquette), impalpable lactose monohydrate 313 (Foremost Farms, USA), and dicalcium phosphate anhydrous (Mallinckrodt). Each of these pseudo-APIs was blended with the base unit formula at varying concentrations to produce qualitatively good and poor formulations, as judged by visual screening.
In some cases, additional magnesium stearate was also added to the blends to aid in lubrication. The decision to add additional magnesium stearate was based on flow performance in the downstream tablet compression process. All formulations tested as well as characterization results are shown in Tables 1 and 2 .

Methods
In order to produce both acceptably and poorly flowing powder formulations, multiple 250-g screening batches were first produced with varying levels of pseudo-API drug loading. Of these screening batches, two formulations of each pseudo-API were selected via visual screening, one presenting qualitatively acceptable flow and another presenting with qualitatively poor flow. These two formulations were then scaled up to a larger (7 kg) batch size and subjected to a full panel of powder flow characterizations and downstream processing.
The chosen formulations were processed into tablets, and visual observations were recorded along with powder flow-related process parameters such as tablet weight relative standard deviation (RSD) and ejection stress. Formulations were then determined to be either successful or unsuccessful depending on the large-scale observations and recorded process parameters during tablet compression.
As a reference point, a placebo batch containing 0 % pseudo-API was manufactured into tablets by direct compression and used as a placebo reference for all pseudo-API evaluations.
Small-Scale Batch Production
Small-scale (250 g) blends were made with varying pseudo-API loadings for the purposes of visual screening and selection of appropriate loadings for larger-scale work. The pseudo-API, a 1:1 mixture (by weight) of mannitol SD100 and microcrystalline cellulose, and 12.5 g NaCMC were passed through a 20-mesh screen into a bottle and blended for 300 revolutions on a Turbula mixer. Of the Mg-stearate, 1.25 g was passed through a 30-mesh screen and added to the bottle. The mixture was blended for an additional 150 revolutions on a Turbula mixer.
Visual Powder Flow Screening
A sample of the 250-g batch was transferred to a clear 20-mL scintillation vial and examined visually against a set of visual flow standards that were ranked from 1 to 5 based on the qualitative visual flow assessments of experienced technicians. The flow standards were as follows: 1: FastFlo (supplied with a Geopyc 1360 Envelope Density Tester) 2: Mannitol SD100 3: MCC PH102 4: NaCMC 5: Magnesium stearate.
Thus, a sample received a rank of 3 if it appeared to flow similarly to MCC PH102. A rank of 3.5 was recorded if the sample clearly flowed better than MCC PH102 but worse than NaCMC.
It was subjectively predicted that a ranking of “4” (NaCMC) was the borderline between failure and success. If the sample visually appeared to flow worse than NaCMC, the powder was expected to fail on the tablet press. If the sample visually appeared to flow better than NaCMC, the powder was expected to process acceptably on the tablet press. Based on this qualitative analysis, two drug loadings were chosen for each pseudo-API, one expected to pass and one expected to fail.
Large-Scale Batch Production
A single batch of mannitol/MCC premixed powder was produced and used to supply all the large batches in the study by subsampling the premix and adding in the pseudo-API, sodium croscarmellose (NaCMC) at a 5 % level, and magnesium stearate (Mg-stearate) at varying levels (as defined in Table 2 ). The large-scale batches were each produced at a 7-kg scale.
Preparation of Mannitol/MCC Premix
Equal masses of mannitol SD100 and microcrystalline cellulose PH102 were weighed passed through a 20-mesh screen into an 8-ft 3 tumble bin. The mixture was blended for 20 min at 15 rpm.
Intermediate Blends
Unit formulas selected for scale-up by the visual screening assessment were scaled up by dispensing the prescribed amounts of mannitol/MCC, NaCMC, and pseudo-API. Each ingredient was passed through a 20-mesh screen and into a 1-ft 3 tumble bin. The mixture was blended for 20 min at 15 rpm. A 200-g sample was taken from this “intermediate blend” to be analyzed through physical testing.
Final Blends
The prescribed percentage (Table 2 ) of Mg-stearate was passed through a 30-mesh screen and added to the same 1-ft 3 tumble bin containing intermediate blends. The mixture was blended for 5 min at 15 rpm. A 200-g sample was taken from this “final blend” to be analyzed through physical testing.

A portion of the blend was removed and compressed into tablets. The remainder of the blend was retained. When lubrication failures were observed during tablet compression (e.g., sticking or high ejection forces), 0.25 wt.% additional Mg-stearate was added to the retained portion of the blend and blended for an additional 5 min at 15 rpm. A new lot number was assigned (e.g., previous lot no. +0.25 MgSt), and tablet compression was attempted again. Mg-stearate was added to the retained portion of the blend until tablets could be produced. Thus, each portion of Mg-stearate was blended to a different cumulative extent. Kushner et al. [ ] have shown that additional shearing of Mg-stearate causes additional lubrication. This lube level vs shear profile is a complicating factor in the analysis, and the blends produced here are not expected to have the same lubrication characteristics as blends with the same unit formula produced in a single blending unit operation. However, since blends were both characterized and downstream processed consistently, the relation between powder flow and large-scale performance can still be elucidated.
Tablet Compression
All final blend formulations were compressed on a KORSCH XL100 tablet press. Ten stations were used with 6-mm-diameter punches. The target weight for the tablets was 100 mg. Compression profiles were taken at five different compression forces.
The lot was deemed a lubrication failure if the ejection stresses were high enough that the machine would automatically power down or if it was observed that powder was sticking to the bottom of the punches.
Compression profiles were produced by setting the press speed at 50 rpm, corresponding to a dwell time of 31 ms, 1 and adjusting the compression force to values of 5, 6.5, 8, 9.5, and 11 kN, corresponding to compression stresses of 177, 230, 283, 336, and 389 MPa, respectively. Periodic weight checks were performed by weighing 10 tablets and ensuring that they totaled between 0.95 and 1.05 g. A sample was collected at each compression force, and the tablet weight, thickness, and diametrical breaking force were recorded for each of ten tablets from each sample. The tablet tensile strength was calculated using Eq. ( 1 ) reported by Cunningham et al. [ ]. $$ {\sigma}_T=\frac{2P}{\pi Dt} $$ (1)
where σ T is the tensile strength, P is the diametrical breaking force, D is the diameter of the tablet, and t is the thickness of the tablet.
After generating a compression profile, the press speed was increased to 100 rpm to give a dwell time of 15.5 ms. The compression force target was adjusted to 8 kN (283 MPa), and 100 tablets were collected every 5 min until all powder ran out of the hopper. A weight distribution analysis (WDA) was performed on each of the run out samples by weighing each of the 100 tablets and calculating the tablet weight RSD. The lot was deemed a failure if the weight percent RSD of the tablets was greater than 2 %, which would represent a rejected lot during large-scale pharmaceutical manufacturing processes.
Physical Testing
The physical tests described below were performed on each of the intermediate blends and final blends, as well as on formulations with additional Mg-stearate. The results of these tests were evaluated against the results from tablet compression to determine if any tests were indicative of poor tablet press performance. A brief explanation of each test method is given below.
Mass Flow
An Erweka GT was used to determine the mass flow rate of each powder. The hopper was filled with 100–150 mL of each powder. The powder would flow, with the assistance of a stirrer, out of the hopper through an orifice in a nozzle for a set amount of time. The powder fell onto a balance, and the results were expressed in gravity per second. The nozzle size, stirrer speed, and flow time were recorded and kept constant through the study. The mass flow rate of each powder was taken three times, and an average of the three results was found.
Angle of Repose
An Erweka GT was used to determine the angle of repose of each powder. The hopper was filled with 100–150 mL of each powder. The powder would flow, with the assistance of a stirrer, out of the hopper through an orifice in a nozzle until the hopper emptied. The powder fell onto a platform, and a laser measured the angle at which the pile rested. The nozzle size and stirrer speed were recorded and kept constant through the study. The angle of repose of each powder was taken three times, and an average of the three results was found.
Flodex
A Flodex tester was used to determine the flowability index of each powder. The Flodex tester was affixed with a 20-mm orifice. If powder flowed out of the orifice uninhibited, the test was repeated until the smallest orifice that yielded a positive result could be determined. The flowability index of each powder was determined by dividing 100 by the size (in mm) of the smallest orifice.
Bulk and Tap Density
A pretared 100-mL graduated cylinder was filled with 100 mL of powder. Bulk density was calculated based on the weight of 100 mL of loosely settled powder. The cylinder was covered and placed in a tap density tester following the procedures in USP30-NF25-S1. The new volume was calculated after 500, 1250, and 2500 taps. The mass of the powder and the volume after 2500 taps allowed for the calculation of tap density. The Hausner ratio was calculated by dividing tap density by bulk density. The compressibility index was found by subtracting bulk density from tap density and dividing the result by tap density. $$ CI=\frac{\rho_{\mathrm{tap}}-{\rho}_{\mathrm{bulk}}}{\rho_{\mathrm{tap}}}\times 100 $$ (2) $$ HR=\frac{\rho_{\mathrm{tap}}}{\rho_{\mathrm{bulk}}} $$ (3)
Powder Shear Testing
A Schulze ring shear tester (model RST-XS; Jenike & Johanson Inc., USA) was used to analyze each sample. An annular trough was filled with sample to overflow a standard Schulze shear test cell before it was leveled off and the cell was weighed. Testing was performed using a preconsolidation pressure of 2000 Pa (FFC 2000 ). Shear stress values were collected at each of the following consolidation pressures: 250, 400, 1000, and 1600 Pa, with a replicate point at 400 Pa. All testing was controlled by the instrument software. Each run produced a yield locus at the five consolidation pressures from which values of σ 1 (major principle consolidating stress), f c (unconfined yield stress), and ϕ (angle of internal friction) were determined for the preconsolidation stress of 2000 Pa. The FFC value was calculated as the ratio of σ 1 to f c .
Plastic Work of Compression
An Instron mechanical tester was used to integrate the plastic work of compression from 0 to 127 MPa of compression stress for each powder blend sample. Plastic work has been found to correlate with Gurnham index by Aburub et al. [ ]. The same methods for plastic work measurement were repeated in this work.
Results and Discussion

Compaction Profiles
Tablet compaction data are summarized in Fig. 1 , with colors indicating the pseudo-API used and size of the marker indicating drug load. Tensile strengths generally decreased with increasing drug loads at similar solid fractions. For example, at 0.9 solid fraction, 5 % starch formulations (light blue cross symbols) exhibited a tensile strength near 4.7 MPa, while the 20 % starch formulations (black cross symbols) exhibited a tensile strength near 2.9 MPa. Similar findings were apparent for the dicalcium phosphate formulations (brown vs red squares). Note that tablets were not successfully produced when ejection stresses or excessive sticking were encountered. Data show that lots containing dicalcium phosphate achieved comparatively low solid fractions under the same compressive load (Fig. 1 ), while the measured tensile strengths were similar to other blends over the range of compression stresses studied. This trend is consistent with the findings of Aburub et al. [ ].
Visual Powder Flow Screening
The experimental results from the visual screening tests are plotted in Fig. 2 . Data points are color coded by success/failure information collected during tablet compression. The y axis is bracketed by pseudo-API for ease of comparison between similar formulations. The data show that the 40 % starch sample exhibited the highest visual flow ranking of 4.5 and produced tablets with a high-weight RSD. This is a qualitatively correct trend since powder flow observed in the scintillation vial should be indicative of powder flow into a compression die. The visual flow ranking increased with increasing loading of each pseudo-API, also a qualitatively correct trend. However, the visual flow ranking was neither predictive of sticking nor the presence of high ejection stresses.
Mass Flow Rate and Angle of Repose
Mass flow rates (g/s) and angle of repose (deg) are plotted for both final blends and intermediate blends of each batch in Figs. 3 and 4 , respectively. While the mass flow rates generally decrease with increasing pseudo-API load, the angle of repose values were scattered and highly variable. The level of Mg-stearate, as indicated by the size of the markers, shows no real correlation between lube level and mass flow rate or angle of repose. For example, for the 40 % starch formulation, the intermediate blend contained no Mg-stearate (small gray cross marker) and had a higher mass flow rate than the final blend which contained Mg-stearate (large yellow cross marker). At the 30 % starch level, this trend was reversed. In all cases, the intermediate blends produced similar values to their final blend counterparts. The largest difference was observed for the placebo, where the intermediate blend (small gray asterisk) was ∼10 g/s, while the final blend (large blue asterisk) was ∼12 g/s. In addition, the variability was higher in the angle of repose data, particularly for the 30 % crystalline mannitol formulation, where the angle of repose varied between ∼32 and ∼41°. Neither set of data show a distinction between red/purple (sticking/ejection), yellow (high tablet RSD), and blue (successful tablet process) batches. Thus, for this data set, the mass flow rate and angle of repose do not appear to be good predictors of large-scale performance for the powders studied. These results may attest to the variations in hopper design of small-scale tests such as mass flow and angle of repose as opposed to large-scale operations, where less than ideal conditions are always present.
Flodex
Flowability index values are plotted for each batch in Fig. 5 . The data show that powders with the highest flow indices (above 5) produced “successful” batches. However, most of the powders were characterized by flow indices near 4 and were not distinguishable from each other. Thus, the flowability index may be a good predictor of powders with excellent flow. For example, the placebo formulation exhibited a Flodex index of ∼14. However, 80 % of the powders studied had a Flodex index below 5, and the test lacked sufficient resolution to distinguish between acceptable powders and powders that failed in large-scale manufacturing operations. No discernible trend was observed with increasing pseudo-API load nor with Mg-stearate level.
Hausner Ratio
Hausner ratios are plotted for each batch in Fig. 6 . The figure shows a clear distinction between successful batches (blue) and high RSD batches (yellow). High tablet weight RSDs were observed when Hausner ratios were above 1.55. In addition, the figure shows some distinction between successful batches and batches that resulted in excessive sticking/ejection stress (red/purple). For example, for the 40 % lactose formulations, the intermediate blend (small gray triangle) and the blends containing 0.5 and 0.75 % Mg-stearate were characterized by HR values of 1.59 (Table 2 ) and exhibited sticking during large-scale production (overlapping red triangles). However, the blend containing 1.0 % Mg-stearate was characterized by an HR value of 1.49 and was deemed successful during large-scale production (large blue triangle). In general, powders with HR values below 1.55 processed acceptable with a notable exception in the case of the 20 % crystalline mannitol formulation (medium red circle). The Hausner ratio was also found to correlate strongly with increasing pseudo-API load, suggesting that it can be reliably used to distinguish powders of similar composition. This is especially apparent for the starch formulations, where the HR of both intermediate and final blends increased with increasing pseudo-API load.
Of all the tests and powders considered in this study, the Hausner ratio correlated most strongly with large-scale performance and was the most discriminating. This may be due to the fact that the Hausner ratio measures a powder’s propensity to settle and form “plugs” under a similar stress state as the powder experiences during processes such as die filling and hopper flow. Specifically, the Hausner ratio reflects the powder’s propensity to densify under its own gravitational and inertial forces. The formation of plugs is important because powder densification reflects strength evolution of the powder compact (i.e., denser powder compacts are stronger than less dense compacts). It could be reasonably hypothesized that powders with a higher propensity to form these plugs would perform more poorly when run through large equipment such as a tablet press.
Powder Shear Testing
The experimental results from the powder shear tests are plotted in Fig. 7 . Similar to the Hausner ratio results, FFC was also found to discriminate successful batches (blue) from high RSD batches (yellow), sticking (red), and high ejection forces (purple). Powders with an FFC value above 5.5 were found to process acceptably at large scale. It is interesting to note that neither Hausner ratio nor FFC predicted the performance of the 20 % crystalline mannitol formulation with 0.5 % Mg-stearate (red circle). The similarities between FFC and Hausner ratio are further illustrated in Fig. 8 , which shows a strong correlation between the two measurements.
While Hausner ratio provides an indirect measurement of powder strength (via powder densification), the FFC value reflects the strength of a powder compact directly. In this case, the FFC value is inversely proportional to the strength of a powder compact when consolidated under a pressure of 2000 Pa. A stronger compact (lower FFC) is more likely to flow inconsistently into a die in the tablet press. This is expected to result in high-weight RSDs during tablet manufacturing as observed in Fig. 7 . The 2000-Pa consolidation stress is thought to be in accordance with stresses experienced by the powder during routine manufacturing. For example, neglecting effects of wall friction, the pressure at the bottom of a bed of powder with density of 0.5 g/cm 3 and bed depth of 0.4 m is approximately 2000 Pa. It is possible that an even better correlation with powder flow could be found at a different consolidation pressure. For both the Hausner ratio and FFC tests, strong correlations between test results and large-scale performance may be a reflection of the similarities in applied inertial forces/stress states between the tests and large-scale processes.
Plastic Work of Compression
The plastic work of compression is plotted for each powder in Fig. 9 . The data show that plastic work does not distinguish well between the powders studied. However, for powders where magnesium-stearate levels were varied, plastic work was found to increase with decreasing Mg-stearate level. This is the expected result as internal lubricants are expected to facilitate particle rearrangement and provide increased densification at lower stress. Thus, for the powders studied, plastic work may be a good indicator of “lubricity,” or the extent of lubrication, within a powder. Fig. 9 Drug load (Pct) vs plastic work of compression (J/g)
Conclusion
Several powder flow characterization tests were evaluated in this study and assessed in terms of their ability to predict large-scale processing performance on a tablet press. While potentially useful tests for other purposes, the angle of repose, Flodex, and plastic work of compression values did not distinguish process failures from successes for the powders studied in this data set nor did they qualitatively correlate with increasing pseudo-API loading. The mass flow rate and visual ranking measurements correlated qualitatively correctly with the pseudo-API loading, and while the visual assessment correctly delineated the “high-weight RSD” failure mode, neither measurement was a predictor of picking/sticking nor of high ejection stresses. The Hausner ratio and FFC results were found to be most predictive of process failures. They also correlated correctly with the pseudo-API load in each formulation, and they were highly correlated with each other.
For future work, more diverse powder formulations should be studied in order to broaden the data set. Additionally, to provide a more robust experimental method, different lubricants should be utilized that have lower sensitivity to shear stress during blending.
