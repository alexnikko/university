Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) usually occurs in a background of cirrhosis which compromises and complicates survival prognostication [ ]. HCC survival is multifactorial, and various imaging and laboratory survival predictors have been investigated [ , , ]. In this analysis, we studied routine laboratory parameters which are representative of the various parameters that are thought to affect outcomes (inflammation, liver function, and tumor activity). These may predict survival in HCC following yttrium-90 transarterial radioembolization (TARE). These factors included neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (N:L), albumin–bilirubin grade (ALBI grade) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP).
N:L provides information on neutrophil (inflammation) and lymphocyte (regulatory/immune pathway) counts [ , ]. N:L in cancer patients integrates the detrimental effects of neutrophila and lymphopenia (reflecting decreased immune response) and has emerged as a useful survival prognosticator [ , , , ]. N:L also has a prognostic role in patients with unresectable HCC [ ].
Liver health is reflected by the synthetic and excretory hepatic functions, with the magnitude of injury/disease represented by the degree of hypoalbuminemia and hyper-bilirubinemia. The ALBI scoring/grading system has been developed as an objective index of liver dysfunction, based solely on albumin and bilirubin level [ ]. It has also been suggested to more accurately predict patients’ mortality than Child–Pugh Class and has been validated as a prognostic index across all Barcelona Clinic for Liver Cancer (BCLC) stages in HCC [ ].
Serum AFP level also plays an important role in representing the pathobiological features of HCC identified as prognostic factors [ , , ]. Elevated AFP has been correlated with (a) poorly differentiated HCC; (b) large tumor size; (c) multifocal tumor; and (d) tumors with macrovascular invasion [ , , , , ]. A decrease in post-therapeutic AFP prognosticates survival [ ]. A combination of AFP, AFP-L3 (an AFP ligand), and protein induced by vitamin K absence-II (PIVKA-II) such as the GALAD score represents the optimum tumor marker assessment tool in HCC [ ]. We do not perform all three tumor marker tests routinely at our institution.
Many scoring systems are being studied/developed into determine survival predictability. A recent study by Spearifico et al. suggests the role of a score based on extent of portal vein thrombosis, bilirubin level, and tumor burden in patients with HCC and PVT [ ]. In this study, we evaluated the survival predictability of laboratory prognosticators (reproducible and routinely performed) including ALBI grade, AFP response, and N:L. A scoring system combining significant laboratory predictors of survival was developed and internally validated.
Methods
This study was compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and approved by the Northwestern University Institutional Review Board. Diagnostic criteria for HCC were defined by established institutional guidelines (arterial phase hyper-enhancement and venous/delayed phase washout) [ ]. Patients were selected for TARE in our institutional multidisciplinary HCC conference.
Patient Cohort
We selected patients with elevated baseline (pre-TARE) AFP > 100 ng/dL [ ]. This cutoff was chosen as Tateishi et al. have shown that when baseline AFP ≤ 100 ng/dL, no significant change in AFP levels is observed following therapy [ ]. Additionally, there are trials being designed for patients with baseline AFP > 100 ng/dL such as “A Study of Ramucirumab Versus Placebo in Participants with HCC and Elevated Baseline AFP (REACH-2).” We excluded patients with laboratory values unavailable at baseline or at the post-TARE (1, 3, or 6 months) Landmarks.
Evaluation/Staging
All patients underwent pretreatment assessment consisting of history, laboratory, and imaging workup. Baseline staging was performed by CP (Child–Pugh; liver function), UNOS TNM (United Network for Organ Sharing; tumor, node, and metastases), and BCLC classification systems [ ]. Tumor characteristics included distribution, maximum dimension of the index lesion, focality (solitary or multifocal), extrahepatic metastases, portal vein thrombosis, and imaging cirrhosis. Baseline laboratory values included bilirubin, albumin, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, and AFP.
Radioembolization
Radioembolization was performed with yttrium-90 glass microspheres using previously described methodology [ , ].
Follow-Up
The following three parameters were reviewed at 1-, 3- and 6-month Landmarks following TARE for the following laboratory variables.
N:L
Absolute values of neutrophils and lymphocytes counts were reviewed and N:L was calculated at baseline, 1-, 3-, and 6-month Landmarks. N:L > 5 and N:L ≤ 5 were compared for survival analyses. Historically, different N:L cutoffs have been used and proposed ranging from 2 to 5 [ ]. We chose 5 as a cutoff value to increase specificity of a high N:L.
ALBI Grade
ALBI grade at baseline, 1-, 3-, and 6-month Landmarks was calculated using the following formula [ ]: $$ {\text{ALBI}}\, = \,\log_{10} \left( {{\text{bilirubin}}\, \times \,17.1} \right)\, \times \,0.66\,{-}\,\left( {{\text{albumin}}\, \times \,10} \right)\, \times \,0.085 $$
ALBI score was converted to ALBI grade as follows [ ]: ALBI score ALBI grade ≤ − 2.60 I > − 2.60 to ≤ − 1.39 II > − 1.39 III
AFP
AFP at 1-, 3-, and 6-months Landmarks was compared to baseline. AFP response was determined at all Landmarks and defined as ≥ 50% decrease from baseline [ ].
Statistical Methodology
All analyses were performed in SPSS 24.0 and R 3.3.2. R package “survival ROC” was applied. p < 0.05 was considered significant for the analyses. The details of the statistical methods used are presented in the eMethods. These are summarized below.
Landmark method is recommended in oncology guidelines for time-dependent analyses. For this analysis, 1-, 3-, and 6-month post-TARE Landmarks were used. The 401 patients were randomized to the following groups: (a) score development and (b) score validation. In order to determine independent risk factors for overall survival (OS), Cox regression was applied. For each Landmark, we included baseline characteristics and the laboratory parameters (at the specified Landmark) as independent variables. The outcome was OS at the post-TARE Landmark. The following scores were developed: (a) Laboratory Score, (b) Baseline Imaging Score, and (c) Combination Score. The validation of the Laboratory, Baseline Imaging, and Combination scores was performed in the validating group. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristics (ROCs) of these three scoring systems at 1, 3, and 6 months were plotted. Areas under the curve (AUCs) of time-dependent ROCs were calculated.
Change in the Laboratory Score was also used to determine treatment response. $$ {\text{Change}}\;{\text{in}}\;{\text{lab}}\;{\text{score}}\, = \,{\text{Lab}}\;{\text{score}}\,\left( {\text{baseline}} \right)\, - \,{\text{Lab}}\;{\text{score}}\;\left( {\text{Landmark}} \right) $$
The change in Laboratory Score was calculated as above. A positive change in the score represents a decrease in the score at the specific post-treatment Landmark and vice versa. All cutoffs were chosen at the 25th and 75th percentile as represented in eTable 3, and patients were grouped into three groups based on these cutoffs.
Results
Baseline Characteristics
Four hundred one patients were included for these analyses (eFigure 1). One hundred forty (35%) tumors were < 5 cm (range of sizes 1.2–22 cm). One hundred ninety-six (36%) tumors were solitary.

Scoring System
Laboratory Score
In the predicting group, the final multivariable Cox regression models with laboratory parameters as independent variables at baseline and 1, 3, and 6 months Landmarks are listed in Table 1 . From the multivariable Cox regressions in the developing group, we detected that ALBI score and AFP measured at each Landmark were independent risk factors of mortality at all Landmarks. The linear components of these regression models are listed below: Baseline Baseline ALBI score + 0.290 * Ln(Baseline AFP) 1 month ALBI score 1 m + 0.573 * Ln(AFP 1 m) 3 months ALBI score 3 m + 0.209 * Ln(AFP 3 m) 6 months ALBI score 6 m + 0.337 * Ln(AFP 6 m)
The coefficient of LnAFP and ALBI scores remained robust at all Landmarks, and we estimated the Laboratory Score to be: $$ {\text{ALBI}}\;{\text{score}}\, + \,0.3\, \times \,{\text{LnAFP}} $$
Baseline Imaging Score
The final multivariable Cox regression models with baseline imaging parameters as independent variables at baseline and 1-, 3-, and 6-month Landmarks are listed in Table 1 . The linear components of these regression models were used for the Baseline Imaging Score. The values in this score system are assigned as follows: if extrahepatic metastasis, PVT, multiple lesions and/or ascites are present, they are assigned 1, otherwise 0.
Combination Score
For the Combination Score, the final multivariable Cox regression model with baseline imaging parameters as independent variables at baseline and 1, 3, and 6 months Landmarks are listed in Table 1 . The linear components of these regression models were used for the Combination Score. The values in this scoring system are assigned in the same way as in the Baseline Imaging Score.
Time-Dependent ROC Curves of the Scoring Systems
Areas under the curve (AUC) of time-dependent ROCs of the Baseline Imaging Score vs. Laboratory Score in predicting patient OS 1 month post 1, 3, and 6 months Landmarks were 0.62 versus 0.68, 0.56 versus 0.82, and 0.57 versus 0.77, respectively (Figs. 1 A–D, 2 A–D, 3 A–D). AUCs in predicting patient OS 3 months post 1, 3, and 6 months Landmarks were 0.64 versus 0.70, 0.58 versus 0.72, and 0.55 versus 0.79, respectively (Table 2 ).

Discussion
Increasing HCC incidence demands accurate post-therapeutic prediction of survival. Imaging response using the recommended Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST) 1.1 takes time to occur (median of 6 months from treatment) [ ]. Laboratory analyses are routinely performed as part of standard-of-care workup in HCC patients, including liver functions (ALBI), complete blood count which can be used to calculate the N:L (inflammatory/immune), and tumor marker (AFP).
This analysis evaluated the three aforementioned parameters in a cohort of 401 patients with HCC treated with TARE who had AFP > 100 ng/dL at baseline. We used the Landmark method to mitigate guarantee-time bias and study the relationship of time-dependent laboratory parameters and survival [ ]. The Landmark method determines patient laboratory parameter status at a specified post-therapeutic time point. OS is then estimated from that time point onward. Patients who die before the Landmark are excluded, minimizing confounding effects and permitting survival analysis in patients with favorable biology (liver function and tumor). The baseline, 1-, 3-, and 6-month (± 1 month) Landmarks were deemed clinically relevant [ ].
Increased inflammation is represented by an increased N:L and may be used as a noninvasive diagnostic marker [ ]. N:L represents local pathophysiological reaction of the body/tissue to the tumor which can in turn predict survival [ , ]. In our analysis, N:L was a significant OS prognosticator on univariate analyses of survival at all Landmarks and was significant on multivariate analysis at the 1-month Landmark.
The extent of disease (cirrhosis) in non-tumoral hepatic parenchyma is important in HCC survival [ , ]. Assessment of liver function and its inclusion in follow-up is important as degree of hepatic parenchymal injury is a competing cause of death [ , ]. ALBI, a new evidence-based system, was introduced and validated externally and internally in large cohorts [ , , ]. In a systemic review of prognostic variables in cirrhosis, serum bilirubin and albumin were the two most important and prominent individual prognosticators [ ]. Hence, we used ALBI in our study as the marker of liver function. ALBI was a significant OS prognosticator on univariate and multivariate analyses at all three Landmarks.
AFP has been used as diagnostic, screening and prognostic tool for HCC [ , , ]. Chan et al. investigated AFP response following chemotherapy and concluded that AFP response is an independent prognostic factor for survival in HCC following chemotherapy [ ]. AFP response occurs earlier than RECIST imaging response [ ]. AFP was a significant OS prognosticator on univariate and multivariate analyses at all three Landmarks.
Bruix et al. have recently shown that survival benefit of sorafenib is greater in patients with low N:L, low AFP, and macrovascular invasion [ ]. Many other investigators are evaluating the role of laboratory values and imaging characteristics as survival prognosticators in HCC [ ]. It is recommended to have collaboration in future analyses which may lead to prospective validation and standardization of these parameters.
As seen in Table 2 , Laboratory Scores showed better OS predictability than Baseline Imaging Scores at 1, 3, and 6 months. The Combination Score also demonstrated improved survival predictability when compared to Baseline Imaging Score at all Landmarks. We propose using the Laboratory Score (AFP response and ALBI) for post-therapeutic follow-up. External validation of the proposed combinations in retrospective and prospective analyses is recommended.
Clinical Utility
To bring a clinical perspective to this proposed Laboratory Score, we grouped patients based on a change in the Laboratory Score at each Landmark. The differences in OS between the three groups were significant ( p < 0.001) in the developing and validating groups (Table 3 and eFigure 2). For example, at the 6-month Landmark in the developing group, OS in groups 1, 2, and 3 were 6, 13, and 52 months, respectively. Group 3 in all Landmarks is the group with a decreasing post-treatment AFP (tumor necrosis) and/or ALBI score (improved liver function). If externally validated, this score may be used for post-therapeutic prognosis and at the 1-month Landmark, it may help make early changes in management before any imaging evidence of response or progression.
Strengths and Limitations
Strengths to this analysis include: (a) Landmark methods decreased guarantee-time bias and minimizing unknown confounders; (b) multiple statistical methods with similar findings strengthen the conclusions; (c) the study consists of a cohort with representation of all HCC stages; and (d) internal validation of the score.
Limitations of this study include: (a) retrospective model; (b) single treatment modality; (c) single-center based; (d) only patients with AFP > 100 ng/dL (although this allows for studying percent change in AFP values, the role of findings presented in this manuscript is limited in HCC patients with AFP < 100 ng/dL); (e) given low numbers at each Landmark, sub-stratification by HCC staging systems (such as BCLC) was not possible; (f) no imaging response was included (this is a focus of an ongoing research project at our institution); (g) the AUCs were not compared to each other as no validated comparison method was available for time-dependent ROCs.
Conclusion
AFP, N:L, and ALBI grades are objective and reproducible values from routinely performed blood tests. As seen in this analysis using Landmark methodology, AFP response and ALBI are significant prognostic indicators of overall survival at all three Landmarks. This study provides an internally validated score combining these parameters. External validation of the proposed Laboratory Score in other cohorts of HCC is recommended.
