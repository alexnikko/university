Introduction
Species are the basic units of biological studies, although delimiting species is a highly complex subject (Sites and Sites and Marshall ; Mckay et al. ). Currently, most parasite species are delimited based on morphological characters; nevertheless, such practice turns problematic when distinguishing characters are subjectively stated, or erroneously evaluated (Hawkins ; McKay et al. ).
The use of different sources of information contributes to a better understanding of the intraspecific variation that may exist among individuals of the same species; also, it might be useful for discovering species and for testing hypotheses of species limits (Padial et al. ; Meik et al. ). The conceptual framework of integrative taxonomy is useful for delimiting units of biodiversity by using several sources of information (Dayrat ; De Queiroz ). In this study, we explored several sources of information to accomplish a robust species delimitation of the nematode Rhabdochona ictaluri , and to test its taxonomic validity as one of the species of the genus Rhabdochona , a widely diverse group of nematodes parasitic in freshwater fishes around the world (Moravec et al. ; Moravec and Adlard ). Up to date, 12 nominal species of Rhabdochona have been recorded in Mexico (see Garrido-Olvera et al. ; Caspeta-Mandujano ; Aguilar-Aguilar et al. ). The high levels of species-richness and endemism of Rhabdochona in the Mexican freshwater fishes have been attributed to two main factors: a complex evolutionary history consisting of extensive ecological host extensions accompanied by host-switching events (Mejia-Madrid et al. ), and the fact that Mexico lies between the Nearctic and Neotropical biogeographical regions, making this country an interesting area from the zoogeographical point of view (see Moravec et al. ). Rhabdochona ictaluri was described from the Yaqui catfish, Ictalurus pricei , and the Lerma catfish, I. dugesii , both endemic species of ictalurid catfishes in northern Mexico, corresponding with the Nearctic biogeographical region (Aguilar-Aguilar et al. ). However, the species was later considered as a junior synonym of Rhabdochona kidderi (Moravec et al. ). According to these authors: “The general morphology of R. ictaluri corresponds with that of R. kidderi , and the latter species is also reported from congeneric hosts ( Ictalurus spp.), [thus…] R. ictaluri should be considered a junior synonym of R. kidderi kidderi ”. In our opinion, the argument is not satisfactory because R. ictaluri was synonymized with R. kidderi on the basis of an apparent similarity of measurements of some structures, and the fact that the parasite was found in the same host group (siluriform catfishes), disregarding other morphological data, host association particularities related with their biogeographical differences (ictalurids have a Nearctic affinity, whereas heptapterids are Neotropical fishes [Miller et al. ; Helfman et al. ; De Borba et al. ; Pérez-Rodríguez et al. ]), and lacking any comparison with the type material of R. ictaluri. Here, we obtained sequence data through one mitochondrial and two nuclear genes of newly sampled specimens of R. ictaluri and an integrative taxonomy approach was followed to test the validity of R. ictaluri .
Material and methods
Sample collection
Nematodes belonging to six species of the genus Rhabdochona were collected between 2015 and 2016 from the intestine of freshwater fishes in eight localities across Mexico (Table 1 ). Hosts were sampled using minnow traps, spoon nets, or seine nets, and transported alive to the laboratory. Individual fish were necropsied a few hours after their capture; all internal organs were placed individually in Petri dishes with saline solution (0.65%) and observed under a stereomicroscope. Collected nematodes were fixed by sudden immersion in hot 4% formalin for morphological procedures, or in 100% ethanol for DNA extraction and sequencing.

Morphological study
All the collected nematodes were identified at species level following standard procedures. Newly sampled individuals were cleared with a solution of 1:1 glycerin-distilled water (Lamothe-Argumedo ). Specimens were then compared with those deposited at the Colección Nacional de Helmintos, Mexico City (CNHE): R. ictaluri ex Ictalurus pricei , Río Tunal at Nombre de Dios, Durango (CNHE 6551, Holotype); R. kidderi ex Rhamdia guatemalensis , Cenote Xnmcuy, Yucatán (CNHE 2698); ex Typhliasina pearsei , Cueva Nahech (CNHE 3286); ex Theraps irregularis , Río Lacantún, Chiapas (CNHE 8065). Morphometric study of each nematode included the diagnostic features used for species of the genus Rhabdochona . Measurements were obtained using the software Image-Pro Plus 7.0 (Media-Cybernetics, Maryland, USA). In addition, the ultrastructure of the body surface of some specimens of R. kidderi and R. ictaluri was studied through scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Specimens were dehydrated through an ethanol series, mounted on a metal stub with carbon adhesive tabs, then gold coated, and examined at 15 kV in a Hitachi Stereoscan Model SU1510 (Hitachi Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Voucher specimens of R. ictaluri and R. kidderi were deposited at the CNHE (accession numbers 10808 and 10865, respectively).
Multivariate statistical analysis
A matrix of 11 metrical variables for males and seven variables for females was built with the morphological data obtained from specimens of R. ictaluri and R. kidderi . Equality of variances between groups was examined using the F test. Values of the morphometric variables were standardized and used to perform a standard discriminant function analysis to evidence the significant differences between the two populations analyzed. In addition, a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed to explore and describe patterns of variation among the data, with the aim of visualizing the clustering of specimens in the morphometric space (Agustí et al. ). For the discriminant function and PCA analyses, 40 individuals per species (20 of each sex) were selected. Analyses were performed with STATISTICA software version 7.1 (StatSoft Inc ).
Extraction, amplification, and sequencing of DNA
Specimens were placed individually in Eppendorf tubes containing 150 μl ultrapure water for 10 min to remove the excess of alcohol. Water was replaced with 25 μl of the Extraction solution and 6.25 μl of the Tissue Preparation Solution included in the REDExtract-N-Amp™ Tissue PCR Kit (Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, St. Louis, USA). Samples were incubated at 55 °C for 1 h, and posteriorly digested in the Thermal Cycler MJ Research PTC-100 (Global Medical Instrumentation Inc., Ramsey, USA) at 95 °C for 3 min. The reaction was neutralized by 25 μl of Neutralization Solution B . The cytochrome c oxidase subunit I ( COXI ), 18S ribosomal RNA (18S), and 28s ribosomal RNA (28S) were amplified using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Primers COIint-F (TGATTGGTGGTTTTGGTAA) and COIint-R (ATAAGTACGAGTATCAATATC) were used to amplify the COXI (Casiraghi et al. ); while primers used for amplifying 18S and 28S were 502-F (CAAGTACCGTGAGGGAAAGTTGC) and 536-R (CAGCTATCCTGAGGGAAAC) (García-Varela and Nadler ), and G18s-F (GCTTGTCTCAAAGATTAAGCC) and 136-R TGATCCTTCTGCAGGTTCACCTAC (Nadler et al. ), respectively. PCR reactions (25 μl) consisted of 1 μl of each primer 10 mM, 2.5 μl of 10XA buffer, 1.5 μl of 50 mM MgCl 2 (1.5 μl), 2.5 μl of 2 mM dNTP’S, 2 μl of the genomic DNA, 0.125 μl of Taq DNA polymerase (Vivantis, Subang Jaya, Malaysia), and 14.375 μl of ultrapure water. PCR cycling was performed in a Thermal Cycler MJ Research PTC-100. Parameters of amplification included the following: (1) denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min, (2) preparing annealing at 94 °C for 30 s, (3) annealing at 45 °C for 1 min, and (4) extension at 72 °C for 2 min (repeating 2–4 by 35 cycles) followed by a post-amplification incubation at 72 °C for 7 min for COXI . The same parameters were used for 18S and 28S with a variation in the temperature and time in the annealing step (54 °C for 30 s for 18 s and 50 °C for 1 min for 28 s). Sequencing reactions were performed using ABI Big Dye (Applied Biosystems, Boston, USA) terminator sequencing chemistry, and reaction products were separated and detected using an ABI 3730 capillary DNA sequencer. Contigs were assembled and base-calling differences resolved using Geneious version 5.0.4. (Drummond et al. ). Sequences were deposited in the GenBank data (accession numbers MK353470 to MK353487).
Alignments, phylogenetic analyses, and genetic pairwise difference
Newly generated sequences were aligned and compared with other sequences of members of the genus Rhabdochona available in GenBank. Nucleotide sequences were aligned using Clustal W (Thompson et al. ) implemented in the web version of the software at http://www.genome.jp/tools/clustalw/ with the option slow/accurate pairwise alignment. Datasets were analyzed separately for each molecular marker and were later concatenated. Tree searches were run under the maximum likelihood (ML) criterion and Bayesian inference (BI) employing a GTR+GAMMA+I model as suggested by jModelTest ver. 2 (Darriba et al. ). Likelihood inference (100 replicates), model parameters, and bootstrap (BS) support (1000 repetitions) were estimated with RaxML GUI 1.5 beta (Silvestro and Michalak ). The software MrBayes v. 3.2.1 (Ronquist et al. ) was used to perform BI analysis, running four independent MCMC of two chains each run for 20 million generations with a heating parameter value of 0.05. Sampling tree topologies every 1000 generations and burn-in periods were set to the first 1500 generations. A 50% majority-rule consensus tree plus posterior probability values of nodal support were calculated from the remaining trees. The phylogenetic trees were visualized with the software FigTree ver. 1.4.2 (Rambaut ). The genetic pairwise difference among samples was estimated using uncorrected “p” distances with the program MEGA version 6 (Tamura et al. ). The species Spinitectus mexicanus , sampled from the poeciliid Heterandria bimaculata from one locality of Mexico (Table 1 ), was used as outgroups following recent phylogenetic analyses that place this genus and Rhabdochona as sister groups (Choudhury and Nadler ).
Results
In total, 230 adult nematodes of the genus Rhabdochona were collected from the intestine of seven species of freshwater fishes in 10 locations of Mexico comprising river basins in both, Nearctic and Neotropical biogeographical regions.
Morphological study
Measurements of the main morphological traits of Rhabdochona ictaluri and R. kidderi are shown in Table 2 . The range of most of the morphological traits is overlapped, although overall, R. kidderi is smaller than R. ictaluri and females possess a lower number of eggs in the uterus (Fig. 1 ); both species possess a prostom armed with 14 teeth and small bifurcated deirids, and the major diagnostic trait distinguishing both species is the presence of six teeth in the base of the prostom in R. ictaluri , and their consistent lack in R. kidderi (Fig. 1 ).

Discriminant function analysis and PCA
Discriminant function analysis showed a significant separation between the specimens of R. ictaluri and R. kidderi. Values of Mahalonobis distance, Wilks’ lambda and F for males and females are shown in Table 3 . Morphometric variables that significantly contributed to the discriminant function were the body width and the length of left spicule in males, and body length and body width in females (Table 3 ). Principal Component Analyses were performed for males and females separately. Both analyses showed two separate clusters (Fig. 2 ), one corresponding with R. ictaluri , and the other with specimens of R. kidderi . In males, body length and glandular esophagus length had a greater contribution to component 1, while vestibule, prostom, and muscular esophagus length contributed more to component 2. In females, body length and width as well as the position of the vulva contributed more to component 1, meanwhile the vestibule, prostom, and muscular esophagus length contributed to component 2 (see Table 3 ).

Phylogenetic analyses and genetic pairwise difference
The alignments of the three molecular markers were analyzed separately; COX1 alignment consisted of 21 terminals (plus Spinitectus mexicanus as outgroup) and was 629 bp long; alignments of the nuclear genes represented a subset of the COX1 samples and included six and 10 terminals for 18S and 28S rDNA with a length of 1797 bp and 1257 bp, respectively. In all datasets analyzed separately, phylogenetic trees showed that Rhabdochona is a monophyletic assemblage. The 18S tree showed very low resolution; R. kidderi and R. ictaluri are sister taxa and are nested with R. canadensis (tree not shown). The 28S tree showed the two isolates of R. ictaluri as sister taxa of two isolates of R. kidderi forming a well-supported monophyletic clade (tree not shown). Figure 3 depicts the resulting COX1 ML tree (-In = 8244.039539) that includes five isolates of R. ictaluri and three isolates of R. kidderi. The tree yielded seven reciprocally monophyletic clades for Rhabdochona species, showing R. ictaluri and R. kidderi as independent and closely related species each highly supported by bootstrap and posterior probability support values, although relationships between them were supported by low bootstrap and posterior probability values. The Bayesian tree retrieved the same topology as the ML tree. These trees showed that the two species of Rhabdochona are the sister taxa of a group consisting of R. canadensis and R. ahuehuellensis + R. xiphophori . The concatenated analysis of the three molecular markers (18S, 28S, and COXI ) analyzed through ML and BI, uncovered the same sister group relationships and higher nodal support for the relationships between R. ictaluri and R. kidderi ; however, these two species nest as the sister taxa of R. mexicana (Fig. 4 ). The mean intraspecific genetic divergence for COX1 among isolates of each Rhabdochona species varied from 0 to 4.8%. Variation of this value within R. kidderi was 2.6%, while within R. ictaluri was 0.07%. The interspecific divergence values for COX1 are shown in Table 4 . The COXI interspecific genetic divergence between the species R. ictaluri and R. kidderi was very high, with a mean value of 13.14%.

The taxonomic identification in nematodes is a difficult task because the characters used for the description of the species require the use of high-resolution microscopy techniques and a relatively specialized knowledge of the morphology of the group (De Ley et al. ; Chaudhary et al. ). In addition, factors such as the lack of robust diagnostic characters in the descriptions, intraspecific variation, samples of individuals at different developmental stages or from different sex sometimes impede an objective comparison and contribute to the lack of accuracy in the taxonomic differentiation between taxa (De Ley et al. , ; Pereira et al. ; Archidona-Yuste et al. ; Chaudhary et al. ; Janssen et al. ). Therefore, the use of several sources of information through an integrative taxonomy approach (Dayrat ; Schlick-Steiner et al. ) is necessary; data from morphology, DNA, ecology (host association), and biogeography have proven to be very useful to accomplish a robust species delimitation and even to recognize the existence of cryptic species (Nadler and Pérez-Ponce de León ).
The synonymy of Rhabdochona ictaluri with R. kidderi as proposed by Moravec et al. ( ) solely on morphological grounds provided an opportunity for the scrutiny of the taxonomical act by following an integrative taxonomy approach. First of all, the results of our morphological analyses confirmed that the most notorious difference between both species is the presence of six basal teeth at the prostom in R. ictaluri , a character that is absent in R. kidderi , as pointed out by Aguilar-Aguilar et al. ( ). The specimens of R. kidderi deposited at the CNHE were studied, and the consistent lack of such teeth was corroborated. We acknowledge that the comparison of morphometric traits indicated a high level of overlap between the two species, but overall, R. kidderi is smaller than R. ictaluri and possesses a lower number of eggs in the uterus in females. Likewise, such morphological differences might be considered not reliable to establish the separation among the two species of Rhabdochona. To further corroborate the species distinction, we performed multivariate statistical analyses with the aim of reducing the potential subjectivity of the morphometric differences; these methods have also proven to be useful to distinguish species in several taxonomic groups (e.g., Albrecht ; Cheng et al. ; Mazur et al. ; Egan ). In the present study, discriminant analysis and principal components allowed us to recognize that both species are clearly separated, and that separation is statistically significant . In principle, our morphological analyses suggested that R. ictaluri is a valid species and does not corroborate the proposed synonymy with R. kidderi suggested by Moravec et al. ( ), more likely to be a result of a misinterpretation of the intraspecific variation of the species.
However, to further corroborate the species distinction, we used other sources of information following an integrative approach (Dayrat ; Will et al. ; Schlick-Steiner et al. ; Pante et al. ). Molecular data provide information about species limits by detecting genetic variation among species and populations (see Pante et al. and references therein), and it is not subjected to phenotypic variation and the potential overlap on the measurements of morphological traits. We used molecular data through one mitochondrial and two nuclear genes to explore the genetic divergence among the sampled individuals of the two species of Rhabdochona , to test for reciprocal monophyly and to assess the phylogenetic interrelationships with respect to other congeneric species occurring in Mexican freshwater fishes. The phylogenetic analyses of independent data sets, as well as the concatenated analysis of the three molecular markers (Fig. 4 ) showed that isolates of R. ictaluri and R. kidderi represented reciprocally monophyletic lineages. The nuclear DNA sequences of 18S and 28S were less informative than COX1 which possess a higher substitution rate. The cytochrome oxidase c subunit 1 of the mitochondrial gene ( COX1 ) has been proposed as the preferred marker for the molecular differentiation among species (e.g., Huang et al. ; Eberhardt ; Satler et al. ); particularly in nematodes, COX1 also represents the preferred molecular marker for species delimitation studies (see Blouin ; Singh et al. ). Our study revealed high levels of interspecific genetic divergence of COX1 among species of Rhabdochona with overall values varying from 6.14 to 14.09%. The average genetic divergence between R. ictaluri and R. kidderi was 13.14%. The use of a genetic yardstick has been highly debated (see discussion in Nadler and Pérez-Ponce de León ), and even though there is not a well-defined threshold to differentiate among parasite species, in most studies on parasitic nematodes, species limits are considered when COX1 values reach about 6% (see Blouin , ; Nakano et al. ; Solórzano-García et al. ; Singh et al. ; Chaudhary et al. ). The molecular study further corroborated that R. ictaluri is a valid species.
The phenotypic and genetic cohesion found that among the species compared in the present study seems to respond to the genetic isolation derived from ecological and biogeographical barriers (Templeton ). The diversification of helminths in Mexican freshwater fishes has been correlated with the geographical and ecological isolation of their hosts (Pérez-Ponce de León and Choudhury , ; Mejia-Madrid et al. , ; Alcántar-Escalera et al. ; Martínez-Aquino et al. ; Sereno-Uribe et al. ; Pérez-Ponce de León et al. ). The species R. ictaluri has been found only in freshwater fish hosts with Nearctic affinity, such as ictalurid catfishes (Mayden ; Miller et al. ); instead, R. kidderi has been registered predominantly in fish hosts with a marked Neotropical affinity, particularly in species of the families Cichlidae and Heptapteridae (Miller et al. ), or in Nearctic fishes of the genus Ictalurus inhabiting Neotropical localities (Caspeta-Mandujano ). Several studies (e.g. Rego ; Rosas-Valdez and Pérez-Ponce de León ; Quiroz-Martínez and Salgado-Maldonado ; Choudhury et al. ) have actually suggested a very limited or null faunal exchange of helminth parasites among freshwater fishes with different biogeographical origin, as in this case, ictalurids (Nearctic origin) vs heptapterids and cichlids (Neotropical origin) (Pérez-Ponce de León and Choudhury ; Rosas-Valdez and Pérez-Ponce de León ). In this context, empirical geographical evidence seems to reinforce the differentiation between the species R. ictaluri and R. kidderi , being the first a Nearctic species, and a Neotropical species the latter. The catfishes of the genus Ictalurus are not the preferred host of R. kidderi and the sporadic records in these fishes (see Pérez-Ponce de León and Choudhury ; Caspeta-Mandujano ) resulted from an ecological host-extension, although the very low prevalence values and the immature nature of specimens of R. kidderi indicate that they represent accidental infections. Host association and biogeography provided another piece of information to recognize the validity of R. ictaluri as separate species. The results of our study show the convenience of gathering evidence from different sources of information to attain a more robust species delimitation, contributing to resolve taxonomical controversies that result in the synonymy of species.
