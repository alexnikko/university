Introduction
Epilepsy is a serious neurological disorder manifested by recurrence of unprovoked seizures resulting in devastating consequences on 75 million of the world population [ , ]. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) derive only symptomatic relief, while the underlying pathology remains unabated, and 20–30% of patients remain refractory to treatment [ ], while 20–30% have associated neurological disorders. Therefore, their remains an exorbitant need for novel and more effective AEDs, which would exhibit simultaneous membrane stabilizing, as well as neuroprotective property. Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common type of partial complex seizure in adulthood [ ]. The animal models of TLE inculpate experimental transaction in which the epileptic condition results as a downstream sequel of brain damage induced by an acute episode of status epilepticus (SE). This episode is elicited by administration of chemical convulsants (e.g., pilocarpine; and Kainic acid) or with electric shock. It has been shown that duration of SE during the initial insult is critical to the duration of latent period and subsequent development of spontaneously recurring seizures (SRSs) and brain damage [ ]. Thus, if a drug abolishes the onset of SE or restricts its duration to few minutes, the subsequent development of chronic epilepsy can be prevented.
Anti-psychotics (antagonist at 5-HT and Dopamine (D2) receptors) are reported to lower seizure threshold in epileptic patients and promote seizures in patients with no previous history of the disease [ ]. It means depletion of serotonin and dopamine at 5-HT and dopamine (D2) receptors, respectively, predisposes to seizures. Alterations in signaling through 5-HT receptors have also been implicated in multiple types of epilepsies, e.g., genetically engineered mouse for elevated serotonin levels exhibited increase in threshold to kainic acid (KA)-induced seizures. Fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), has been claimed to ameliorate short-term metabolic impairment and signs of neuronal damage in surviving rats evaluated against lithium-PILO model of epilepsy [ ]. Besides, fluoxetine in combination with existing AEDs, i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and ameltolide, has been reported to produce a dose-dependent reduction in their ED50 values against maximal electroshock (MES)-induced tonic hind limb extension (THLE) in mice [ ]. In genetically epilepsy-prone rats (GEPRs), fluoxetine in combination with LY 206130 (1-[1-H-indol-4-yloxy]-3-[cyclohexylamino]-2-propanol maleate) and 5-HT1A somatodendritic autoreceptor antagonists (-)-pindolol enhanced their anti-seizure effects [ ].
Several lines of investigation have also confirmed inadequacy of dopaminergic system in progression of epileptic seizures. For example, Bozzi et al. (2000) inactivated D2R gene in two mouse strains known to be previously resistant to (KA-induced seizures and excitotoxicity and demonstrated their increased sensitivity, susceptibility, and hippocampal cell death on KA administration compared to WT mouse [ ]. Bromocriptine, a dopamine (D2) receptor agonist, has been reported to lower spike frequencies in both primary and secondary epileptic foci following implantation of cobalt in conscious rats as inscribed by electrocorticogram [ ]. It has also shown protection against hippocampal neurodegeneration induced by ischemia in gerbil model of global cerebral ischemia [ ].
Far from being given, fluoxetine and bromocriptine would restrain generation of epileptic seizures and even act as mild neuroprotectants, but intricate character of epileptic seizures is severe neurodegeneration coupled with hypersyncronous neuronal activity. Thus, neurodegeneration would, in the progression of disease, degenerate serotonergic and dopaminergic neurons, deplete post-synaptic receptor densities of serotonergic and dopaminergic receptors, and change receptor properties by altering the properties of binding site towards binding of serotonin and/or dopamine. Thereby, subsequent effect of serotonergic and dopaminergic agonists would evanesce, leading to clinical onset of drug refractory epilepsy, as is the problem with existing AEDs.
This problem could have been circumvented with the use of estrogens which although are neuroprotective but are reported to facilitate seizures. The effect of 17β-estradiol on neurons is well established during menopause, i.e., state of diminished levels of 17β-estradiol leading to increased cascade of neurodegenerative diseases, while post-liminary administration of 17β-estradiol around menopause delays the onset of neurodegenerative disorders [ ]. 17β-estradiol increases excitatory (glutamatergic) transmission, and that facilitation of transmission extends to seizures [ , ]. Hence, its use to prevent seizure-induced neuronal death is inexpedient. These limitations have been overcome by selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), which act as estrogen agonist in the bone, cardiovascular system, and brain and as an antagonist in uterus and breast [ ], and thus have emerged as surrogate for providing neuroprotection [ ]. Raloxifene, a SERM, has been shown to protect hippocampus from excitotoxic effects of KA [ ], ameliorate seizures and hippocampal neuronal damage in postmenopausal temporal lobe epileptic mouse model [ ], and attenuate seizure severity, prolong latency to seizures, and reduce morbidity against PILO-induced SE in rats [ ]. Hence, raloxifene would exert neuroprotective effect as like estrogens but would simultaneously withhold proconvulsive behavior amalgamated with estrogens. Thus, a combination of test drugs, raloxifene with fluoxetine and bromocriptine, was sought to exhibit synergistic effect against SE and TLE in mice through abolishing irregular neuronal electrical activity and augmenting neuroprotective effect, while a comparison was drawn with individual drugs.
Epilepsy leads to cascade of pathophysiological events in the brain in the form of changes in hippocampal neuropeptide (NPY) levels, induction of oxidative stress, and degeneration of different regions of hippocampus. NPY is a 36 aa polypeptide widely distributed in the CNS, where it is involved in various physiological functions [ ]. NPY behaves as a natural barrier against progression of seizures in hippocampus from perforant path to dentate gyrus granular cell [ ]. NPY reduces glutamate release by a presynaptic mechanism involving suppression of voltage-dependent Ca 2+ influx [ ]. NPY-deficit and knockout mice that had no detectable levels of NPY were reported as more prone to convulsions, while transgenic rats overexpressing NPY were less susceptible to seizures compared to their wild type (WT) counterparts [ , ]. Synthesis of NPY is induced by brain derived neurotropic factor-tyrosine receptor kinase-B (BDNF-TrkB) signaling upon estrogen administration. Further estrogen in inhibitory presynaptic boutons promotes loftier release of NPY during seizures (i.e., viable mechanism of estrogen induced neuronal survival in the DG and CA1–CA3 hippocampal pyramidal cell layers) [ ]. This signaling pathway was sought to emulate with triple drug combination of raloxifene with fluoxetine and bromocriptine (in rescission of epileptogenesis).
Oxidative stress (OS) and nitrosative stress (NS) are defined as imbalances between generation and elimination of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), the disparity in which is associated with neurodegeneration and mitochondrial dysfunction spotted with epileptogenesis [ ]. Seizures activate NMDA receptors by increasing levels of glutamate, reducing extracellular Ca 2+ concentration and along with increase in cytosolic Ca 2+ concentration [ ]. The effects mediated by Ca 2+ during excessive glutamate receptor activation (excitotoxicity) escorts to neuronal degeneration and overload of mitochondria with Ca 2+ , so free radicals are generated. Overload of this type of Ca 2+ leads to oxidative stress (OS), cellular damage, and eventually cell death because of Ca 2+ -mediated opening of mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) pores associated with apoptosis [ ]. Thus, treatment strategies ameliorating seizure-induced oxidative stress could avert neuronal death.
Brain damage or neuronal injury caused by epileptic seizures or SE critically alters morphologic and functional characteristics of neurons leading to clinical onset of chronic epilepsy or TLE accompanied by learning and memory deficits [ ]. AEDs like valproic acid have demonstrated neuroprotection against ischemia in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced hyperglycemic rats [ ], while topiramate has demonstrated neuroprotective effects against glutamate excitotoxicity in rat hippocampal neurons via modulating BDNF/TrkB-dependent ERK pathway [ ]. However, neuroprotective effect of said drugs is frequently masked by severe side effects posed by them, during long-term therapy. Hence, there is an unmet need of drug(s) or drugs combinations which would simultaneously raise seizure threshold, restrict the anatomical and functional damage to neurons exposed to initial insult, and promote endogenous fight against seizures with meager side effects. In view of above facts, we assessed the effects of raloxifene, fluoxetine, bromocriptine, and their low-dose combinations against PILO-induced SE in mice. Besides, an attempt was made to explore the role of hippocampal NPY, oxidative stress, and neuroprotection in mediation of anti-epileptic effects of the above drug(s).
Materials and Methods
Animals
Swiss albino mice (both sexes), 10–12 weeks old in the weight range of (25–35 g), were obtained from central animal house facility IIM Jammu (India). Animals were housed in polypropylene cages with dust-free rice husk as a bedding material. The animals were provided with a commercial diet (Ashirwad feed, India) and water ad libitum under controlled temperature (25 ± 2 °C), humidity (60 ± 10%), and lighting (12:12 light/dark cycle) conditions. All the experimental procedures involving animals were conducted as per CPCSEA guidelines after getting proper approval by Institutional Animal Ethical Committee (IAEC), PG Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Kashmir, Srinagar [No: F-IAEC(Pharm. Sc.) APPROVAL/2013/15]. Utmost care was taken to ensure that animals were treated in the most humane and ethically acceptable manner.
Drugs and Dosing Schedule
Sodium valproate (SV) and fluoxetine (FT) were gifts from Sun Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (India). Raloxifene (RF) was purchased from Cipla Ltd. (India), bromocriptine mesylate (here to referred as bromocriptine (BC)) and diazepam were sourced from Monarch Pharmaceuticals (India), and PILO was obtained from Himedia Laboratories Pvt. Ltd. (India). Sodium valproate and PILO were prepared from pyrogen-free sterile water for injection. Raloxifene, fluoxetine, bromocriptine and diazepam were suspended in 2% Tween 80. All treatments were administered orally except PILO and diazepam, which were injected intraperitoneally (i.p) in a volume not exceeding 10 ml/kg. Raloxifene was administered in doses of 4 and 8 mg/kg (the dose of 8 mg/kg was derived from the corresponding dose (60 mg) in humans for the treatment of osteoporosis [ ]). Fluoxetine was administered in doses of 14 and 22 mg/kg (the dose of 22 mg/kg was reputed to induce granule cell dematuration and enhance serotonergic modulation [ ]) and bromocriptine was administered in doses of 6 and 10 mg/kg (the dose of 10 mg/kg was reported to protect against MPTP-induced neurotoxicity in mice [ ]). All drug(s) were administered for a period of 28 days prior to PILO (300 mg/kg) injection in mice. Diazepam (10 mg/kg) was used to reduce PILO-induced mortality in susceptible groups.
Experimental Design
One hundred thirty mice were randomly selected and divided into 13 experimental groups consisting of ten mice in each group. The division followed was the following: Group I: normal control; Group II: toxic control; Group III: standard anti-epileptic drug (AED); Groups IV–XIII were administered raloxifene (RF), fluoxetine (FT), and bromocriptine (BC) alone and in different combinations; Groups IV–IX as monotherapy; Groups X–XII as duo drug combination therapy; and Group XIII as triple drug combination therapy. The monotherapy with each of raloxifene, fluoxetine, and bromocriptine had been evaluated at two dose levels, while in combination, the lower doses of each were used in order to achieve desired therapeutic response at the cost of minimum adverse effects.
Pilocarpine-Induced Behavioral Seizures
The dose of PILO (300 mg/kg; i.p) was standardized in our laboratory for induction of SE in 100% of normal mice, which was found in conformity with that of Mazzuferi et al. (2012) [ ]. The mice were placed in plexiglas chambers for behavioral monitoring of seizure progression for 60 min. The continuous seizure activity was recorded as per slight modification of Kim et al. (2010) [ ] as follows: Stage 1: immobilization and staring; Stage 2: head nodding; Stage 3: rearing accompanied by forelimb clonus and wet dog shakes; Stage 4: falling and wobbling; Stage 5: jumping, circling, or rolling; and Stage 6: severe tonic-clonic seizures. A highest score was recorded at intervals of every 3 min, i.e., 20 scores for 60 min. The mean for 20 scores was calculated, which gave a score for each animal. The mean of scores from all animals in a group was tailed, i.e., seizure severity score for each group was established. A substance was considered to possess anticonvulsant activity if it reduced seizure severity score compared to score in toxic control. Six (06) mice from each of the groups were promptly sacrificed post-monitoring and processed for hippocampal NPY and biochemical estimations, while remaining four (04) mice from each of the said groups were kept under controlled conditions for 24 h, thereafter sacrificed for histomorphological studies. A compound was considered to possess anticonvulsant activity if it decreased seizure severity score when compared to score in mice treated with PILO alone.
Pilocarpine-Induced Neuronal Damage
PILO-induced neuronal damage was assessed by histopathological evaluation of hippocampus 24 h after PILO injection. Animals from each group were deeply anesthetized with ether, and the brains were removed from the skull and immediately preserved in formalin. Brains were cut in 8-μm thick coronal sections, every 100 μm from 2.3 to 4.3 mm posterior to the bregma with the help of microtome and mounted the sections on clean marked glass slides. Hematoxylin and eosin (H/E) staining was used for staining to access neuronal terminal and cellular degeneration. The prepared slides were examined under light microscope, and digital photographs were taken by a pathologist unaware of treatment regimen from hippocampal Cornu ammonis sub regions, i.e., CA1, CA2, CA3, and DG of both hemispheres (entire hippocampus was studied under 4×, while hippocampal subregions, cornu ammonis—CA1, CA2, CA3—and dentate gyrus were considered under 40×). Normal neurons were skillfully differentiated from deformed neurons by their typical large size, medium-intensity staining, and dark nucleoli. After seizures pyramidal cells often were shrunken, pyknotic or few had entirely disappeared. The analysis of neurons was executed with a 1-cm 2 10 × 10-box microscopic grid. The grid of counting was positioned on a well-defined zone of hippocampus, i.e., CA1, CA2, CA3, and DG, and counting was conducted out with a microscopic enlargement of 200- or 400-fold defined for each single hippocampal subfield. Neurons touching the inferior and right edges of the grid were not counted.
Estimation of Hippocampal NPY Levels
Succeeding behavioral experiments, animals were sacrificed, band the rains were removed and hippocampus was separated. NPY was estimated using mouse NPY ELISA kit (Ray Biotech, Norcross, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The kit allows in vitro quantitative determination of NPY levels using immunoassay techniques.
Estimation of Hippocampal Oxidative Stress Indices
Post-behavioral monitoring of seizures in the mice, homogenate of hippocampus was processed in ice-cold phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C to obtain the supernatant, which was used for the following:
Protein Estimation
Briefly, 0.2 ml of PMS (10% w / v ) was pipetted off in a fresh autoclaved calibrated glass tube and processed with 0.8 ml of MilliQ water, followed by addition of 5 ml Copper Reagent. The samples were incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Finally, 1 ml of Folin’s reagent was added to each sample, vortexed, and again incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The blue color developed was read at 700 nm against appropriate blank using bovine serum albumin (BSA 0.1 mg/ml) as standard [ ].
Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances (TBARS) Estimation
Briefly, 1 ml of PMS (10% w / v ) was pipetted off in a fresh autoclaved calibrated glass tube, followed by addition of 1.0 ml of TCA (10%) and 1.0 ml of TBA (0.67%). The tubes were covered with thin aluminum sheets and incubated in boiling water for 45 min. After cooling, the tubes were centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 10 min. The absorbance of supernatant was read spectrophotometrically at 525 nm against appropriate blank. Rate of lipid peroxidation (LPO) was estimated by measuring MDA content as nanomole MDA formed per gram wet tissue at 37 °C by using a molar extinction coefficient of 1.56 × 10 5 M −1 cm −1 [ ].
Catalase (CAT) Estimation
Briefly, 0.05 ml of PMS (10% w / v ), 1.95 ml of phosphate buffer (0.1 M, PH 7.4), and 1.0 ml of H 2 O 2 (0.019 M) were pipetted off and mixed in a fresh autoclaved calibrated glass tube to make total assay mixture of 3.0 ml. Changes in absorbance were recorded spectrophotometrically at 240 nm. Catalase activity was calculated as nanomole H 2 O 2 consumed per minute per milligram of protein [ ].
Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) Estimation
Briefly, 0.1 ml of PMS (10% w / v ), 3 ml of Tris HCl buffer (PH 8.5), and 25 μl of pyrogallol (24 mM) were pipetted off and mixed in a fresh autoclaved calibrated glass tube. Changes in absorbance were recorded at 1-min intervals for every 3 min spectrophotometrically at 420 nm. One unit of SOD is described as the amount of enzyme required to cause 50% inhibition of pyrogallol autooxidation [ ].
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison test. The data was represented as mean ± SEM. P < 0.05 was considered as significant in all the cases.
Results
Effect of Raloxifene, Fluoxetine, Bromocriptine, and their Combinations on Pilocarpine-Induced Seizure Severity in Mice
PILO (300 mg/kg, i.p) induced severe seizures in mice. Monotherapy with low doses of raloxifene (4 mg/kg) and bromocriptine (6 mg/kg) significantly ( p < 0.05) reduced seizure severity score, while no such effect was observed with their corresponding higher doses, i.e., raloxifene (8 mg/kg) and bromocriptine (10 mg/kg). Also, fluoxetine (14 and 22 mg/kg) and its duo drug combinations each with raloxifene (4 mg/kg) and bromocriptine (6 mg/kg) were devoid of anti-seizure effects. The combination of raloxifene (4 mg/kg) and bromocriptine (6 mg/kg) rendered no additional therapeutic benefit over individual drugs. However, interestingly, triple drug combination of raloxifene (4 mg/kg) with fluoxetine (14 mg/kg) and bromocriptine (6 mg/kg) exhibited synergism in abrogation of PILO-induced seizures ( p < 0.001), and an anti-seizure effect greater than observed with sodium valproate ( p < 0.01), a standard AED, was exhibited (Fig. 1 ). Fig. 1 Effect of RF (4 and 8 mg/kg), FT (14 and 22 mg/kg), BC (6 and 10 mg/kg), and their combinations against PILO-induced seizure severity in mice using SV (300 mg/kg) as standard AED. Data is represented as mean ± SEM of 10 mice per group. Analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey-Kramer’s multiple comparison test. *** p < 0.001; ** p < 0.01; * p < 0.05 (compared with normal control group). ### p < 0.001; ## p < 0.01; # p < 0.05 (compared with toxic control group)
Effect of Raloxifene, Fluoxetine, Bromocriptine, and their Combinations on Hippocampal NPY Levels in Mice
PILO (300 mg/kg, i.p) upsurged NPY levels by 20.01% ( p < 0.05) in the hippocampus. NPY levels were further raised by 29.71 and 31.25% ( p < 0.05, p < 0.01) upon raloxifene (4 mg/kg) and bromocriptine (6 mg/kg) administration, while their corresponding higher doses, i.e., raloxifene (8 mg/kg) and bromocriptine (10 mg/kg) insignificantly elevated hippocampal NPY levels. The minuscule elevation of NPY levels was also observed with fluoxetine (14 and 22 mg/kg) and its combination with each of raloxifene (4 mg/kg) and bromocriptine (6 mg/kg). Low-dose combination of raloxifene (4 mg/kg) and bromocriptine (6 mg/kg) inflated NPY levels by 31.52%, ( p < 0.01), and an effect similar to monotherapy with bromocriptine (6 mg/kg) was observed. However, interestingly, triple drug combination of raloxifene (4 mg/kg) with fluoxetine (14 mg/kg) and bromocriptine (6 mg/kg) exhibited 100% escalation in NPY levels ( p < 0.001), which was greater than observed with sodium valproate (300 mg/kg) (31.80%; p < 0.01) (Fig. 2 ). Fig. 2 Effect of RF (4 and 8 mg/kg), FT (14 and 22 mg/kg), BC (6 and 10 mg/kg), and their combinations on hippocampal NPY levels after PILO-induced SE in mice using SV (300 mg/kg) as standard AED. Data is represented as mean ± SEM of six mice per group. Analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey-Kramer’s multiple comparison test. *** p < 0.001; ** p < 0.01; * p < 0.05 (compared with normal control group). ### p < 0.001; ## p < 0.01; # p < 0.05 (compared with toxic control group)
Effect of Raloxifene, Fluoxetine, Bromocriptine, and their Combinations on Hippocampal Oxidative Stress in Mice
Protein Levels
PILO (300 mg/kg, i.p) lured decrease in hippocampal protein levels. Administration of raloxifene (4 mg/kg), bromocriptine (6 mg/kg), and their combination significantly ( p < 0.05) resisted abatement in protein levels. Captivatingly, triple drug combination of raloxifene (4 mg/kg) with fluoxetine (14 mg/kg) and bromocriptine (6 mg/kg) also significantly ( p < 0.001) resisted alleviation in protein levels, and an effect greater than standard AED, i.e., sodium valproate ( p < 0.01), was surmountable, while remaining drug(s) and their combinations failed to resist such change (Fig. 3 ). Fig. 3 Effect of RF (4 and 8 mg/kg), FT (14 and 22 mg/kg), BC (6 and 10 mg/kg), and their combinations on hippocampal protein levels post-PILO-induced SE in mice using SV (300 mg/kg) as standard AED. Data is represented as mean ± SEM of six mice per group. Analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey-Kramer’s multiple comparison test. *** p < 0.001; ** p < 0.01; * p < 0.05 (compared with normal control group). ### p < 0.001; ## p < 0.01; # p < 0.05 (compared with toxic control group)
TBARS
Pilocarpine (300 mg/kg, i.p) impelled increase in hippocampal MDA levels. Administration of raloxifene (4 mg/kg), bromocriptine (6 mg/kg), and their combination significantly ( p < 0.05) dwindled MDA levels. Engrossingly, triple drug combination of raloxifene (4 mg/kg) with fluoxetine (14 mg/kg) and bromocriptine (6 mg/kg) also significantly ( p < 0.001) attenuated MDA levels, and an effect greater than sodium valproate ( P < 0.01) was surmountable, while remaining drug(s) and their combinations failed to resist such change (Fig. 4 ). Fig. 4 Effect of RF (4 and 8 mg/kg), FT (14 and 22 mg/kg), BC (6 and 10 mg/kg), and their combinations on hippocampal lipid peroxidation levels following PILO-induced SE in mice using SV (300 mg/kg) as standard AED. Data is represented as mean ± SEM of six mice per group. Analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey-Kramer’s multiple comparison test. *** p < 0.001; ** p < 0.01; * p < 0.05 (compared with normal control group). ### p < 0.001; ## p < 0.01; # p < 0.05 (compared with toxic control group)
Catalase Levels
Pilocarpine (300 mg/kg, i.p) magnified hippocampal catalase levels. Administration of raloxifene (4 mg/kg), bromocriptine (6 mg/kg), and their combination further significantly ( p < 0.05) raised catalase levels. Engagingly, triple drug combination of raloxifene (4 mg/kg) with fluoxetine (14 mg/kg) and bromocriptine (6 mg/kg) furthermore significantly ( p < 0.001) escalated catalase levels. The said combination increased catalase levels more than standard AED, i.e., sodium valproate, while remaining drug(s) and their combinations failed to significantly contribute to the variation (Fig. 5 ). Fig. 5 Effect of RF (4 and 8 mg/kg), FT (14 and 22 mg/kg), BC (6 and 10 mg/kg), and their combinations on hippocampal catalase (CAT) levels post-PILO-induced SE in mice using SV (300 mg/kg) as standard AED. Data is represented as mean ± SEM of six mice per group. Analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey-Kramer’s multiple comparison test. *** p < 0.001; ** p < 0.01; * p < 0.05 (compared with normal control group). ### p < 0.001; ## p < 0.01; # p < 0.05 (compared with toxic control group)
Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) Levels
Pilocarpine (300 mg/kg) induced insignificant curtailment in hippocampal SOD levels. Hence, all drugs and their combinations also exhibited insignificant augmentation in SOD levels (Fig. 6 ). Fig. 6 Effect of RF (4 and 8 mg/kg), FT (14 and 22 mg/kg), BC (6 and 10 mg/kg), and their combinations on hippocampal superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels after PILO-induced SE in mice using SV (300 mg/kg) as standard AED. Data is represented as mean ± SEM of six mice per group. Analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey-Kramer’s multiple comparison test. *** p < 0.001; ** p < 0.01; * p < 0.05 (compared with normal control group). ### p < 0.001; ## p < 0.01; # p < 0.05 (compared with toxic control group)
Effect of Raloxifene, Fluoxetine, Bromocriptine, and their Combinations on Pilocarpine-Induced Hippocampal Neuronal Damage in Mice
Hippocampal scrutiny of normal mice administered with vehicle (2% Tween 80) displayed normal size, shape, and regularly ordered compact array of neuronal cells, with prominent dark-colored nucleus in all hippocampal subregions. In contrast, PILO (300 mg/kg) administration revealed marked effects of SE in the form of comprehensive loss of pyramidal neurons in CA1, CA2, and CA3 regions, while extensive neuronal loss and gross neuronal shrinkage were palpable in the DG region. Treatment with raloxifene (4 mg/kg) and bromocriptine (6 mg/kg) protected against neurodegeneration as discernible from mild apoptosis in CA1, CA2, and CA3 regions. However, their combination bestowed no additional benefit than individual drugs, while their corresponding higher doses, i.e., raloxifene (8 mg/kg) and bromocriptine (10 mg/kg), replenished meager neuroprotection. Fluoxetine (14 mg/kg and 22 mg/kg) and its low-dose combination each with raloxifene (4 mg/kg) and bromocriptine (6 mg/kg) failed to produce neuroprotection, apparent from boundless loss of neurons in CA1, CA2, and CA3 regions, while the DG region revealed large number of shrunken neurons. Amusively, triple drug combination of raloxifene (4 mg/kg) with fluoxetine (14 mg/kg) and bromocriptine (6 mg/kg) was foreseen with overwhelming neuroprotective effect substantiated with mild pyknosis in the CA1 region, while CA2, CA3, and DG revealed compactly arranged organized layer of pyramidal cells with prominent nucleus and very few pyknotic neurons. The neuroprotective effect of triple drug combination was much superior than sodium valproate (Figs. 7 and 8 ). Fig. 7 Representative photomicrographs depicting H/E stained hippocampal sections of Swiss albino mice comparing PILO-induced neuronal damage in different monotherapy groups. Scale bar of 4X images (EH) = 0.5mm (500 μm ) and 40X images (CA1, CA2, CA3 & DG) = 0.05 mm (50 μm). Hippocampal transverse section of mice observed 24 h following PILO (300 mg/kg, i.p) delineates complete loss of pyramidal neurons in CA1, CA2, and CA3 regions, while extensive neuronal loss and gross neuronal shrinkage is evident in DG region (Group II). Nominal loss of healthy neurons, mild pyknosis is discerned in CA1 and CA2 regions, while scattered arrangement of healthy neurons in CA3 region along with grossly normal morphology of neurons is ascertained in DG region upon sodium valproate administration (group III). Treatment with raloxifene (4 mg/kg) prevented morphological changes induced by PILO, as evidenced from mild apoptosis in CA1, CA2, and CA3 regions along with failure to resist gross neuronal shrinkage in the DG region (group IV). However, raloxifene (8 mg/kg) displayed minimal influence on deranged morphology (group V). Treatment with fluoxetine (14 and 22 mg/kg) rather aggravated PILO-induced neuronal damage (groups VI and VII). Bromocriptine (6 mg/kg) also exhibited neuroprotective effect evidenced with mild pyknosis in CA1 CA2, CA3, and DG regions (group VIII), while with bromocriptine (10 mg/kg), neuroprotective effect was not substantial (group IX) Fig. 8 Representative photomicrographs depicting H/E stained hippocampal sections of Swiss albino mice comparing PILO-induced neuronal damage in different combination treatment groups. Scale bar of 4X images (EH) = 0.5mm (500 μm ) and 40X images (CA1, CA2, CA3 & DG) = 0.05mm (50 μm). Hippocampal transverse section of mice reveals inversion of neuroprotective effect of raloxifene (4 mg/kg) when combined with fluoxetine (14 mg/kg) (group X). The combination of raloxifene (4 mg/kg) with bromocriptine (6 mg/kg) retrieved PILO-induced damage as observed by mild pyknosis in CA1, CA2, CA3, and DG (group XI). Again, the combination of fluoxetine (14 mg/kg) with bromocriptine (6 mg/kg) rather peeved PILO-induced neuronal damage (group XII). Yet, though triple drug combination of raloxifene (4 mg/kg) with fluoxetine (14 mg/kg) and bromocriptine (6 mg/kg) effectively prevented the morphological changes induced by PILO as evident by intact neuronal structure with very few pyknotic nuclei in the CA1, CA2, and CA3 regions (group XIII)
Discussion
The present AEDs pose several problems in the management of seizures owing to their meager neuroprotective potential, adverse effects on the bone, detrimental effects on cognitive function, chronic toxicity, drug interactions, side effects including aggression, agitation, and irritability, and sometimes exacerbation of seizures [ , ]. Long-term outcome studies [ ] and randomized trials [ , , , ] suggest that fewer than 50% of patients become seizure-free on the first AED. Even prognosis and efficacy of new AEDs are discouraging, and no AED has been found to possess exemplary properties [ , ]. The probable choices of AEDs alone or in combination are so innumerable that often it is not possible for a prescriber to try every permutation within a single lifetime. The introduction of newer AEDS to the established drugs brings their total number up to around 20 for use in the common epilepsies [ ]. This qualifies the likelihood possibility of about 200 duo-therapies or more than 1000 combinations of three AEDs. Most patients with refractory epilepsy take two, three, or even four AEDs [ ]. However, the experimental and clinical evidence in support of “rational polytherapy” is sparse, with only the combinations of topiramate each with lamotrigine, gabapentin and felbamate, and sodium valproate with lamotrigine described as reliable synergistic combinations, while the latter combination is also fortified with human data [ , ]. However, increase in the practicability of intensified adverse effects even with such combinations cannot be abandoned [ ]. Much to the contrary, the combination of carbamazepine with lamotrigine was found to be antagonistic involving pharmacodynamic mechanism, resulting in extravagant drug loading [ ], while brimming teratogenic risks are reported with combination of phenobarbital, phenytoin and primidone, carbamazepine, sodium valproate, and phenobarbital with or without phenytoin (i.e., cramping use in pregnant women) [ ]. Thus, epileptic disorders have remained a serious challenge for researchers; the reason we could ascribe is that we are missing the right therapeutic target.
It has been hypothesized that combining two or more AEDs with different MOA results in heightening of their anticonvulsant effects. To ratify this hypothesis, a study was carried out to ascertain synergistic interaction between duo and triple drug combinations of raloxifene (anti-osteoporosis drug), fluoxetine (antidepressant drug), and bromocriptine (dopamine (D2) receptor agonist). The comparison was figured with individual drugs and standard AED, i.e., sodium valproate. Results of this study clearly stipulated the superlative activation of hippocampal NPY signaling pathway by triple drug combination of raloxifene with fluoxetine and bromocriptine and subsequent mitigation of PILO-induced SE and TLE. The anticonvulsant effect of the said combination was better than sodium valproate, which was further confirmed from histomorphological findings and measurement of oxidative stress indices. Hence, there are compelling reasons to state that the present study has significant clinical potential in patients with SE, TLE, and refractory epilepsies.
In agreement with previous literature, raloxifene (4 mg/kg) was found to be effective in restricting chemically (PILO) induced seizures as evidenced from scaling down of seizure severity score [ ]. Raloxifene is delineated to act via regulating opiate and GABAergic neurotransmission by modulating the levels of β-endorphin and neuroactive steroids. Chronic raloxifene administration to postmenopausal women increases plasma levels of β-endorphin and tetrahydroprogesterone (allopregnanolone), an anxiolytic metabolite of progesterone that modulates GABAA receptors, and exerts anti-epileptic effects [ , ]. Bromocriptine (6 mg/kg) was also found to mitigate PILO-induced seizures, which is in alliance with previous literature demonstrating anti-epileptic effects of bromocriptine, in case of self-induced, drug-resistant epilepsy [ ] and neuroprotective efficacy against KA-induced brain damage [ ]. In clinical studies, bromocriptine has been shown to reduce seizure severity in TLE patients affected by pituitary prolactinomas [ ]. Interestingly, prolonged use of bromocriptine treatment was without any severe side effects [ ]. Exceptionally, higher doses of raloxifene (8 mg/kg) and bromocriptine (10 mg/kg) unveiled no significant effect on attenuating seizure severity, while their low-dose combination rendered no additional therapeutic benefit than individual drugs at lower doses. Fluoxetine (14 and 22 mg/kg) was also devoid of anti-seizure effect although recounted in literature to suppress maximal electroshock-induced seizures in rats [ ], pentylenetetrazole-induced convulsions in mice, focally evoked limbic motor seizures in rats [ ], and audiogenic seizures in genetically epilepsy-prone DBA/2J or genetically epilepsy-prone rats (GEPRs) [ ]. Fluoxetine has also been reported to significantly enhance the doses of picrotoxin needed to produce tonic hindlimb extension and death in unstressed and swim-stressed mice, and in stressed mice also the dose of picrotoxin producing running/bouncing clonus [ ]. It also raised the density of GABAA receptors in DG, CA1, and CA2 regions of lithium–PILO-treated rats, and indicative of anti-epileptic effect [ ]. However, failure of fluoxetine (14 and 22 mg/kg) to restrict PILO-induced seizures suggests that pathophysiological involvement of brain is different in the case of seizures involving chemical or electric shock or in genetically epilepsy prone rats. The combination of fluoxetine (14 mg/kg) either with raloxifene (4 mg/kg) or bromocriptine (6 mg/kg) tended to inverse their anti-seizure effects, whilst in literature, fluoxetine has been reported to enhance the anticonvulsive action of sodium valproate, but not that of ethosuximide against PTZ-induced clonic convulsions in mice [ ]. The reason behind this anomaly needs to be investigated. Nevertheless, triple drug low-dose combination of raloxifene (4 mg/kg) with fluoxetine (14 mg/kg) and bromocriptine (6 mg/kg) exhibited synergism in abrogation of PILO-induced seizures ( p < 0.001). Here, fluoxetine (14 mg/kg) augmented the anti-seizure effect of raloxifene (4 mg/kg) and bromocriptine (6 mg/kg), and an antiepileptic effect better than sodium valproate ( p < 0.01) was contemplated. The decrease in seizure severity is related to delay in initiation of seizures, as well as reduction in the number of occurrences of tonic–clonic seizures induced by PILO. This might suggest mitigation of M1 mAChR as well as N -methyl- d -aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation by the said drug(s), in particular triple drug combination. Further, it has been shown that duration of SE during the initial insult is critical to the duration of latent period and subsequent development of SRSs and brain damage. Lemos and Cavalheiro (1995) conducted first study of its kind where adult male Wistar rats were injected with a single dose of PILO (300–320 mg/kg, i.p.) followed by a combined diazepam (10 mg/kg) and pentobarbital (30 mg/kg) treatment, and a progressive increase in the mean latency to the first spontaneous seizure and a decrease in seizure frequency in animals with shorter SE (1 and 2 h) were observed along with less severe neuropathological alterations in the animals. Finally, study ended up showing that animals experiencing only 30 min of SE did not develop SRSs [ ]. On the contrary, Klitgaard et al. (2002) observed SRSs in rats that had experienced 30 min SE and had terminated SE by injecting diazepam (10 mg/kg, i.v.) [ ]. Nevertheless, the probability, latency, and severity of SRSs and of neuropathological change enfeeblements with depreciating SE duration [ , ]. Hence, if a drug abolishes the onset of SE or restricts its duration to few minutes, the subsequent development of chronic epilepsy (TLE) can be prevented. Yet, it can be comprehended that triple drug combination prevents SE as well as TLE.
Neuropeptide-Y (NPY) is an endogenous neuropeptide widely distributed across rat brain with eminent expression in the hilar region of the hippocampus, arcuate nucleus of hypothalamus, and cerebral cortex [ ]. Anti-seizure effect of NPY has been reported against absence seizures in Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats of Strasbourg (GAERS) via modulating pathological oscillatory thalamocortical activity [ ]. In our study, PILO-induced seizures with a concomitant increase in hippocampal NPY levels, which is in agreement with previous report of Dube 2007, who reported upregulation of hippocampal NPY expression after experimentally induced febrile seizures (FS) and concluded that inhibitory actions of NPY, released after seizures, exert a protective effect that reduces the risk of seizure recurrence in the brain. The hippocampal NPY was further escorted with significant (29.71%, 31.25%; p < 0.05, p < 0.01) rise from chronic treatment with low doses of raloxifene (4 mg/kg) and bromocriptine (6 mg/kg) alone, while their combination rendered an effect similar to bromocriptine (6 mg/kg). This finding braces behavioral result from this study that dual drug combination of raloxifene (4 mg/kg) and bromocriptine (6 mg/kg) is no better than individual drugs. An insignificant elevation of hippocampal NPY levels was revealed with fluoxetine (14 mg/kg and 22 mg/kg) alone and its combination each with raloxifene (4 mg/kg) and bromocriptine (6 mg/kg). It also emphasizes results from behavioral study that fluoxetine (14 mg/kg) inverses therapeutic potential each of raloxifene (4 mg/kg) and bromocriptine (6 mg/kg). Yet, though, triple drug combination of raloxifene (4 mg/kg) with fluoxetine (14 mg/kg) and bromocriptine (6 mg/kg) displayed an enormous upsurge (100%; p < 0.001) in hippocampal NPY levels. Further, our study corroborated with the earlier experimental reports indicating that sodium valproate boosts NPY levels [ ]. However, the rise in NPY levels observed with triple drug combination was substantially higher than sodium valproate (31.80%, p < 0.01).
The miraculous effect of antagonist fluoxetine (14 mg/kg) on seizure severity, neurodegeneration, oxidative stress, and hippocampal NPY levels, in combination with agonists raloxifene (4 mg/kg) and bromocriptine (6 mg/kg), is charismatic, as synergism was not observed with low-dose combination of raloxifene (4 mg/kg) and bromocriptine (6 mg/kg). The mechanistic approach hypothesized for therapeutic potential of triple drug combination involves elevated synthesis and release of NPY (estrogen induces NPY formation through BDNF-TrkB signaling, which was predicted to mimic with raloxifene, a component of triple drug combination) and activation of hippocampal NPY (Y2) receptors (presynaptic) and NPY (Y5) receptors (postsynaptic). Invigoration of former receptor inhibits glutamate release at CA1-CA3 synapse via inhibiting N-type, P/Q type, and VGCC at presynaptic neuronal terminal, while incitement of latter receptor advances coupling with Gi/o—inhibiting AC, activating MAPK—opening of K + channels and obstruction of excitatory hilar-CA3 synaptic transmission, leading to synergistic anti-epileptic and neuroprotective effects [ , , ]. Taken together, NPY is perhaps co-released with serotonin and dopamine and synergizes with them in mediation of antiepileptic and neuroprotective effects. The co-transmission and synergism of NPY with NA had formerly been reported [ ].
Oxidative stress is defined as deficit between generation and neutralization of ROS species such as hydroxyl radical (HO · ), superoxide anion radical (O 2 · ), hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), peroxyl radicals (HOO · ), and high amounts of nitric oxide (NO · ) and its derivative reactive nitrogen species (RNS) [ ], which play an important role in the generation and progression of epileptic seizures [ , ]. Anomalous levels of oxidant and antioxidant enzymes have been reputed in children with refractory epilepsies [ ]. Inflation of hippocampal oxidative stress in mice on PILO administration had been disclosed [ ]. In the present study too, there was significant ( p < 0.001) elevations in hippocampal MDA (a marker of lipid peroxidation) levels in PILO-SE mice, which is in conformity with previous reports [ , ]. Raloxifene (4 mg/kg), bromocriptine (6 mg/kg), and their combination facilitated significant ( p < 0.05) reduction in MDA levels, while fluoxetine (14 and 22 mg/kg) alone and its combination each with raloxifene (4 mg/kg) and bromocriptine (6 mg/kg) did not significantly alter raised MDA levels. However, triple drug combination of raloxifene (4 mg/kg) with fluoxetine (14 mg/kg) and bromocriptine (6 mg/kg) showed exorbitant potential in diminishing ( p < 0.001) MDA levels.
Catalase (CAT) is an enzyme present mainly in mitochondria and peroxisomes that catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen [ ]. A significant rise in hippocampal CAT levels was observed in PILO-SE mice, which is in agreement with previous literature [ , ]. It has been documented that increase in ROS generated because of PILO-SE that leads to increase in CAT as a compensatory mechanism [ ]. Further significant ( p < 0.05) escalation in CAT levels was observed upon administration of raloxifene (4 mg/kg), bromocriptine (6 mg/kg), and their combination. However, fluoxetine (14 and 22 mg/kg) and its combination each with raloxifene (4 mg/kg) and bromocriptine (6 mg/kg) failed to signify any effect. Convincingly, triple drug combination of raloxifene (4 mg/kg) with fluoxetine (14 mg/kg) and bromocriptine (6 mg/kg) showed exorbitant potential in sprouting ( p < 0.001) CAT levels.
The SOD enzyme plays indispensible role in detoxifying superoxide anions in hydrogen peroxide and oxygen. It can scavenge the superoxide anion by catalyzing it to H 2 O 2 and O 2 , which prevents the oxidative stress-induced cellular damage [ ]. In the present study, there was no significant change in SOD activities in PILO-SE mice. Hence, all the treatment groups failed to show any significant alteration in SOD levels. Thusly, SOD is not likely the key enzyme involved in intracellular antioxidant defense system of the brain against seizures (i.e., is not engaged in a crucial role against oxidative stress induced with PILO-SE). The present results further suggest that triple drug combination has superlative antioxidative effect via modulating levels of MDA and catalase than via superoxide dismutase activity, compared to other treatment groups and could well restrict oxidative stress-induced hyperpolarizations and neuronal damage.
After an initial insult preceding epileptic seizures, the change in neuronal network functions is set in motion, leading to onset of chronic seizures in the presence of both neuronal damage and over excitation [ ]. Neurodegeneration involves change in receptor properties of neurons thereby critically altering neuronal response towards anti-epileptic drugs leading to clinical onset of pharmacoresistant seizures sometimes accompanied by cognitive decline [ ]. Unfortunately, not all AEDs exhibit neuroprotective potential. Drugs like barbiturates and benzodiazepines have been reported to be neutral or even promote neurodegeneration especially on immature brain tissue, although novel AEDs especially lamotrigine, tiagabine, and topiramate seem out to be neuroprotectants [ ]. However, extrapolation of data from animals to humans presents several challenges, as most of the studies concerning neuroprotective effects of AEDs have been conducted in ischemic models of neuronal injury. Hence, therapeutic interventions, which would counteract neurodegeneration along with hyper-synchronous neuronal depolarizations, can halt the progression of epileptic seizures. Hippocampal neuronal loss in patients with epilepsy especially those with generalized epileptic seizures and long duration of the epileptic disorder has been reported [ ]. Histopathological examination of normal and hippocampal sections from PILO (300 mg/kg) administered mice revealed marked effects of SE in the form of extensive neuronal death in CA1, CA2, and CA3 areas, hallmark of extensive neuronal pyknosis, with extensive shrinkage of neurons in the DG region, which is in agreement with previous studies [ , ]. These changes were markedly improved by triple drug combination of raloxifene (4 mg/kg) with fluoxetine (14 mg/kg) and bromocriptine (6 mg/kg) and were bolstered up to a lesser extent by low doses of raloxifene (4 mg/kg) and bromocriptine (6 mg/kg), while their corresponding higher doses exhibited no such neuroprotective effect. Further, the low-dose combination of raloxifene (4 mg/kg) with bromocriptine (6 mg/kg) rendered no additional neuroprotective effect than the individual drugs at low doses. The sodium valproate seemed out to be neuroprotectant also, but less so than triple drug combination.
Conclusions
The present study recites that synergistic low-dose triple drug combination of raloxifene with fluoxetine and bromocriptine as optimum strategy against chemically induced seizures and neurodegeneration enriched with meager adverse effects and malformation rate. The study further emphasizes that optimum level of serotonin and dopamine acts synergistically with NPY against deteriorating process of epileptogenesis.
