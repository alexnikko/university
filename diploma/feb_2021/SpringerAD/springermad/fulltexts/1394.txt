Introduction
Myxosporeans are a diverse group of parasitic metazoans, generally infecting marine and freshwater fishes (Jirků et al. ). Chloromyxum Mingazinni, 1890, the fourth largest genus of myxosporeans, harboring 151 nominal species is characterized by spherical to subspherical or slightly elongated spores with a straight meridional suture and binucleate sporoplasm (Eiras et al. ; Liu et al. ; Zhang et al. ). Spores possess two pairs of polar capsules, often unequal and located near the apex, and two smooth or ridged spore valves with caudal filamentous projections in some cases (Lom and Dyková ). Members of the genus exhibit wide variations in morphological features and host specificities. Most of the marine species infect the gallbladder of elasmobranchs while the freshwater species infect the gallbladder and urinary bladder of various fishes. Infections were also reported in other organs like testes, gills, muscles, and liver (Eiras et al. ). Spores of freshwater species are usually spherical to subspherical with extra-sutural ridges on shell valves while marine forms generally have oval, broad spores with a thickened apex and caudal filaments and exhibit very low host specificity compared to their freshwater counterparts. The type species of the genus, C. leydigi Mingazzini 1890, has a wide host range, infecting the gallbladder of 21 species of sharks and rays (Gleeson and Adlard ).
Traditional myxosporean taxonomy based on morphology and morphometrics has its own limitations, especially when dealing with morphologically indistinguishable forms. Lom and Dyková ( ) observed that scanning electron microscopy can provide a pattern of extra-sutural ridges which will help in differentiating members of the genus Chloromyxum . Molecular phylogeny of Chloromyxum reveals that the genus is polyphyletic. All reported species of Chloromyxum infecting elasmobranchs form a single clade, while their freshwater counterparts occupy a separate position (Fiala and Dyková ; Jirků et al. ; Gleeson and Adlard ; Sanders et al. ; Liu et al. ; Zhang et al. ). Hence, a multipronged approach involving morphology, morphometrics, molecular phylogeny, and host and tissue specificity along with geographical distribution is preferred for delineating myxosporeans at species levels (Lom and Dyková ; Bartošová and Fiala ; Gleeson and Adlard ).
Among the reported 151 species of Chloromyxum , 11 species— C. amphipnoui Ray, 1933; C. mrigalae Tripathi, 1952; C. hoarei Lalitha Kumari, 1969; C. meglitschi Sarkar, 1982; C. mitchelli Kalavati & Narasimhamurti, 1984; C. tripathii Kalavati & Narasimhamurti, 1984; C. clariasum Sarkar, 1994; C. heteropneustesi Rajendran & Janardanan, 2005; C. puntiusi Rajendran & Janardanan, 2005; C. ompokii Sarkar, 2007, and C. puntii Sarkar, 2007—have been reported from Indian waters (Kalavati and Nandi ; Eiras et al. ) . Of these, C. mitchelli and C. tripathii were recovered from marine fishes while the remaining were from freshwater or brackish water habitats. Except C. mitchelli which infects the kidney, all Indian species were recovered from the gallbladder. The present study describes a new species of Chloromyxum infecting the urinary bladder of the brackish-water fish, Scatophagus argus.
Materials and methods
Sample collection
One hundred and fifty-five samples of Scatophagus argus were collected from Cochin backwaters along the southwest coast of India (9° 59.001′ N; 76° 14.584′ E). Samplings were conducted once per season/quarter during April 2015 to July 2017 (Table 1 ), and the size of the collected fish ranged from 10.1 to 24.9 cm in length. Table 1 Details of season-wise sampling Seasons 2015 2016 2017 Total Collected Infected Collected Infected Collected Infected Collected Infected Jan–Mar (Q1) – – 13 6 10 9 23 15 Apr–Jun (Q2) 14 0 20 1 19 3 53 4 Jul–Sept (Q3) 12 2 11 4 14 6 37 12 Oct–Dec (Q4) 22 18 20 16 – – 42 34 Total 48 20 64 27 43 18 155 65
The collected fish were brought to the laboratory, euthanized, and examined for external infections under a stereozoom microscope (Nikon SMZ 1000, Nikon, Japan). The fish were dissected and internal organs/tissues were screened by examining smears of various organs/tissues, while coelozoic infections were screened by examining contents of the gallbladder and urinary bladder under a Nikon Eclipse 80i research microscope (Nikon, Japan). Portions of infected samples were fixed in 95% ethanol for molecular analysis, 2.5% glutaraldehyde for scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and methanol for preparing Giemsa-stained permanent smears. Statistical analysis of prevalence of infection in relation to size groups as well as seasons was carried out using two-way analysis of variance. All the required ethical and regulatory guidelines (CPCSEA Guidelines on Regulation of Scientific Experiments on Animals, 2007) have been followed while carrying out the present work.
Morphology and morphometry
Morphological analysis of spores was carried out using Nomarski Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) optics at × 100 magnification, and photomicrographs were taken using a Nikon DS Fi1c camera (Nikon, Japan). Morphometry of spores ( n = 30, unless otherwise specified) based on the guidelines proposed by Lom and Arthur ( ) was carried out using Nikon - Elements BR software. All measurements are given in micrometers (μm) as mean values with standard deviation, followed by range in parentheses. Principal component analysis was performed with PAST 3 scatterplots (Hammer et al. ) with 95% confidence ellipses ( n = 30) to understand the intraspecific morphological variations, if any, between the isolates.
Scanning electron microscopy
Contents of the urinary bladder were washed thrice with distilled water to remove salt and other debris, and the washed spores were transferred to a poly-L-lysine-coated coverslip and allowed to stand for 15 min. The coverslip with spores were then fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde buffered with 0.1 M sodium cacodylate (pH 7.5) for 3 h and washed thrice with the same buffer, post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide for 1 h followed by three buffer washes of 10 min duration each. The samples were dehydrated in acetone series, critical point dried using a Hitachi HCP2 Critical Point Dryer (Hitachi, Japan), gold coated using Quorum SC76220 mini sputter coater (Quorum Technologies, UK), and observed under a Tescan VEGA3 scanning electron microscope (TESCAN, Brno, Czech Republic) at various magnifications.
Molecular analysis
Genomic DNA was extracted using a HipurA multisample DNA purification kit (HIMEDIA, India), following the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, ethanol-fixed samples were centrifuged at 1300 rpm for 5 min; pellets were separated, lysed in lysis buffer, and loaded onto DNA extraction columns. The DNA was washed in wash buffer and finally eluted in nuclease-free water. SSU rDNA was amplified by PCR using MYXOSPECF and 18R primers (Whipps et al. ; Fiala ). PCR was carried out in 30 μl reaction mixture containing 15 μl Dream Taq Green PCR Master Mix 2X (Thermo scientific, USA), 8.8 μl nuclease-free water, 0.6 μl of each primer, and 5 μl DNA extract. The reaction was performed in a ProFlex PCR system (Applied Biosystems, USA), and the thermocycler program included an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles at 95 °C for 45 s, 53 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 90 s, and a final elongation at 72 °C for 7 min. PCR products were electrophoresed through 1.5% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide, and positive DNA bands were excised, purified using a HiPurA™ Quick Gel Purification Kit (HIMEDIA, India), and sequenced (Sanger sequencing) through a commercial firm.
Phylogenetic analysis
Forward and reverse sequences obtained were assembled to generate contigs using BioEdit (Hall ), and the resultant 1640-bp sequences were deposited in NCBI GenBank. BLAST N analysis was performed in NCBI and phylogenetic analysis carried out based on SSU rDNA partial sequences from 18 species of Chloromyxum and 10 other closest representative myxosporeans appearing in BLAST N analysis. Sequences were aligned using Clustal W (Thompson et al. ) with sequences of Buddenbrockia plumatellae (AY074915) and Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae (FJ981823) as out-groups. For tree construction, multiple sequence alignment of 30 sequences retrieved from GenBank and 2 sequences of the present myxosporean was performed in Mega 7.0.14 version (Tamura et al. ). Bayesian analysis revealed K2+G with alpha value of gamma distribution parameter 0.35 to be the best-fitting evolutionary model for maximum likelihood (ML) analysis, while neighbor joining (NJ) and maximum parsimony (MP) analyses were carried out using default parameters with 1000 resamplings each.
Results
Sixty-five of 155 S. argus (41.93%) screened were infected with the present myxosporean. Two-way analysis of variance revealed that prevalence of infection varied significantly with size of fish ( p < 0.05); the average prevalence observed are 66.7% in the 10–15-cm size group ( n = 51), 49.0% in the 15–20-cm size group ( n = 49), and 12.7% in the 20–25 cm size group ( n = 55) (Fig. 1 ). Significant difference in prevalence was restricted between the size groups 10–15 and 20–25 cm. Analysis also revealed significant differences ( p < 0.05) in prevalence of infection between seasons (Fig. 2 ). Average prevalence observed for different seasons was 65.2% during January–March (Q1, n = 23), 7.5% during April–June (Q2, n = 53), 32.4% during July–September (Q3, n = 37), and 81.0% during October–December (Q4, n = 42). Significant differences in prevalence values were found between Q1 and Q2, Q2 and Q4, as well as Q3 and Q4. Infections were observed in both sexes, and in heavy infections, the urinary bladder appeared pale yellow with turbid urine. Parasite spores were observed that were consistent with myxozoans of the genus Chloromyxum , but did not match any nominal species and is described here as a new species.

Diagnosis
Mature spores were recovered from the ureter and urinary bladder of infected fish. Spores were subspherical and measured 9.40 ± 0.66 μm (8.32–11.50) in length and 9.32 ± 0.87 μm (8.22–12.20) in width (Fig. 3 a). A prominent, caudal extension-like structure was observed arising from the posterio-lateral region of each spore valve. In valvular view, the caudal extension tapered sharply and ended with a blunt tip, while in sutural view, it appeared narrow (Fig. 4 a, b). It measured 5.90 ± 0.77 μm in length while the width varied from 2.45 ± 0.18 μm at its origin, 1.41 ± 0.15 μm at the middle, and 0.47 ± 0.13 μm at the tip. Scanning electron microscopy revealed both the spore valves to be equal with a prominent sutural ridge (SR) (Fig. 5 c, d) and possessed numerous extra-sutural ridges (ESR) on the surface (Fig. 6 a–i). SR were straight, 270 ± 20 nm in thickness and 348.32 ± 33 nm in height ( n = 7). ESRs varied widely in numbers, measured 183.74 ± 54 nm in width, and were separated by furrows measuring 127.84 ± 24 nm in depth ( n = 12). In most cases, the first two ESRs were observed running parallel to the sutural ridge (Fig. 5 c, d). The remaining ones showed wide variations including multibranching and did not show any consistency in its pattern/arrangement (Figs. 5 c and 6 a–i). ESRs were limited to the surface of the spore and were absent on the caudal extension (Fig. 5 a, b). There were four polar capsules, pyriform and unequal, located at the anterior region of the spore; large and small polar capsules were arranged diametrically opposite to each other, leaving one small and one large polar capsule in each spore valve (Fig. 4 b). The large polar capsule measured 2.97 ± 0.44 μm in length and 2.60 ± 0.50 μm in width while the small polar capsule measured 1.97 ± 0.47 μm in length and 1.72 ± 0.30 μm in width. The polar filament is flat, ribbon-like, with four to five coils in large polar capsules and three coils in small polar capsules (Figs. 3 i and 4 b). Polar filaments measured 23.59 ± 4.49 and 8.85 ± 0.95 μm in large and small polar capsules respectively ( n = 13). Four polar filament discharge pores (PFDP) were observed in the anterior region of the spore (Fig. 4 d). Generally two PFDPs are observed in each valve, one of which is located on the second or third ESR while the other is on the third or fourth ESR (Figs. 5 d and 6 a–i). Occasionally a fifth PFDP was also observed in some cases (Fig. 6 a). Pores appeared as prominent, circular to slightly elliptical, raised structures with an oval to slit-like opening in the center (Fig. 6 a–i). PFDPs measured 708.78 ± 56.09 nm in length and 512.01 ± 38.95 nm in width ( n = 20) while the central opening measured 389.16 ± 54.28 nm in length and 120.9 ± 15.01 nm in width ( n = 14). The sporoplasm is binucleate, filling the entire spore cavity (Fig. 4 b). Principal component analysis (PCA) of morphometric measurements revealed very high morphological overlapping between isolates in the present study (Fig. 7 ).

Vegetative stages
Pansporoblast irregular in shape, with granulated cytoplasm and small pseudopodia-like structures on one side and fine villosites on the other (Fig. 3 c), measured 34.71 ± 0.48 μm in length and 22.38 ± 0.34 μm in width ( n = 7). Plasmodia spherical and/or irregular in shape (Fig. 3 d–h) were observed floating freely in the urinary bladder, measured 17.31 ± 0.53 μm in length and 15.96 ± 0.56 μm in width. Both monosporic (Fig. 3 e–g) and polysporic (Fig. 3 h) forms were observed. Plasmodia contained granular cytoplasm with refractive granules. Monosporic plasmodia possess ESRs and wing-like processes on either side which extend backwards as the caudal extension (Fig. 3 e, f). Polysporic were plasmodia irregular in shape and harbored various developmental stages. Developing polar capsules and spore boundaries were clearly visible (Fig. 3 h).
Molecular analysis
Partial SSU rDNA of the present myxosporean was sequenced and the 164- bp nucleotide sequences submitted to GenBank (accession numbers: MG029440 and MG029441). In molecular analysis, the isolates of the present myxosporean showed 99.1% sequence identity to each other. In BLAST N analysis, the present sequences showed maximum identity (87–88%) with C . kurisi (KJ526212). This was followed by C. fluviatile (GU471264) with 83–84% and C. careni (HM641794) with 82–83% identities respectively. While with C. kurisi , the closest reference sequence, the isolates showed 86.4 and 85.5% molecular identities and 14.0 and 15.3% divergence respectively. The remaining sequences showed still lower molecular identities and higher divergence values. A comparison of variable SSU rRNA regions of the present form with that of 18 species of Chloromyxum is given in Table 2 . In the size of the V4 and V7 regions, the present myxosporean showed more affinity towards the estuarine ( C . kurisi ) and freshwater species of Chloromyxum. V4 and V7 regions of marine and terrestrial forms exhibited wide variations in size (Table 2 ).

Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic trees (NJ, ML, and MP) revealed similar clustering with minor topological variations. In all trees, members of the genus Chloromyxum were polyphyletic (Fig. 8 ). In NJ and MP trees, clade A appeared as an assemblage of diverse genera which included C. kurisi (KJ526212), C. argusi n. sp. (present isolates—MG029440 and MG029441), S. oncorhynchi (AF201373), and M. lieberkuehni (X76638), all infecting the urinary bladder of teleosts and C. careni (HM641794) infecting the urinary bladder of amphibians. C. ellipticum (KX424575) and C. legeri (AY604197), both infecting the gallbladder of freshwater teleosts, also found a place in this cluster. In all the trees, clade B was composed of species infecting the gallbladder of freshwater teleosts while clade C included species of Chloromyxum infecting the gallbladder of elasmobranchs.

Discussion
Members of the genus Chloromyxum are generally coelozoic, infecting the gallbladder and urinary bladder of freshwater and marine fishes. Of the 151 species of Chloromyxum , only 19 were found infecting the urinary system while the majority infected the gallbladder of freshwater fishes (Eiras et al. ; Sanders et al. ; Liu et al. ; Zhang et al. ). The present study describes a new species, C. argusi n. sp., infecting the urinary bladder of S. argus . Morphological features like subspherical spores with ESRs, two pairs of unequal polar capsules, and binucleate sporoplasm place the present myxosporean under the genus Chloromyxum Mingazzini 1890.
Among the species of Chloromyxum infecting the urinary system and having spores with extra-sutural ridges and unequal polar capsules, the present form comes close to C. psedomucronatum (Shulman, 1966) C. kovaljove (Evlanov, 1981), C. inexpectatum (Baska, 1990), C. menticirrhi (Casal et al., 2009), and C. kurisi (Sanders et al., 2015) in spore morphometrics. However, it differs from C. kovaljove , C. psedomucronatum , C. inexpectatum , and C. menticirrhi in the measurements of polar capsules. Though C. kurisi closely resembles the present form, it can be distinguished based on the spore dimensions (Table 3 ). The general ESR pattern of the present myxosporean also differs from that of all the above species compared.

It has been suggested that ESRs can help delineate Chloromyxum species (Lom and Dykova, 1993), but here, we observed a wide variation in its pattern, questioning the dependability of ESRs as a tool for distinguishing species under this genus. Age or state of development may alter the shape/size of spores and asynchronous development may lead to variations in spore morphologies (Lom and Dyková ; Holzer et al. ; Atkinson et al. ). In addition, the present form is distinct from all known species of Chloromyxum in having a prominent caudal extension. Many members of the genus Chloromyxum , especially the marine forms, are known to possess caudal filaments. But, the caudal extension found in the present form is different and bears more resemblance to the caudal projection found in Caudomyxum nanum Bauer 1948. However, other morphological features like extra-sutural ridges on spore valves, unequal polar capsules, and freely floating plasmodium places the present myxosporean under the genus Chloromyxum rather than Caudomyxum . Considering the morphological and morphometric differences with already described species of Chloromyxum , the present myxosporean is considered as a new species.
In molecular analysis, the present isolates exhibit a percentage identity of 99.1%, which along with morphometrics and PCA clearly indicates their conspecificity. The isolates showed 86.4 and 85.5% molecular identities and 14.0 and 15.3% divergence with C. kurisi , the closest reference sequence in BLAST N analysis while the remaining sequences showed still lower molecular identities and higher divergence values, indicating the molecular uniqueness of the present isolates. Many authors have considered genetic variations around 1–1.3% for discriminating species of myxosporeans (Gunter and Adlard ; Gunter et al. ; Heiniger and Adlard ). However, interspecific variations ranging from 0.2 to 30% have been reported for the genus Myxobolus (Kent et al. ; Bahri et al. ; Fiala ; Ferguson et al. ). Intraspecific variations are also common, as evidenced by < 1% in Kudoa thyrsites (Whipps and Kent, 2006), 2.6% in Myxidium lieberkuehni (Schlegel et al., 1996), and up to 3.6% in Myxobolus dujardini (Molnár et al., 2006). Hence, discrimination of species based on divergence values alone may not be proper.
In molecular phylogeny, but for the minor topological variations, NJ, ML, and MP trees were all similar and clearly highlight the polyphyletic origin of the genus Chloromyxum. Marine elasmobranch-infecting species formed a well-supported Chloromyxum sensu stricto clade (clade C) while the remaining freshwater/estuarine species was grouped under the Chloromyxum sensu lato clade as observed in other studies (Fiala and Dyková ; Sanders et al. ; Liu et al. ; Zhang et al. ). Under the Chloromyxum sensu lato clade, two different lineages were observed—clade A and clade B—with bootstrap values of 56 and 99 respectively. The present isolates fall under clade A and stand out with a high bootstrap value, positioned as a sister branch of C. kurisi which also is an estuarine form infecting the urinary system of a teleost (Fig. 8 ). Cutting across genus borders, clade A also included members of Sphaerospora and Myxidium in addition to Chloromyxum. Except C. ellipticum and C. legeri , all are parasites of the urinary bladder, indicating that the taxonomic lineages based mainly on spore morphology are not simple as they appear. Except C. ellipticum , C. legeri , and C. trijugnum , all other species infecting the gallbladder of freshwater teleosts grouped together as clade B while C. trijugnum occupied a separate position as observed by other authors (Liu et al. ; Zhang et al. ).
A comparison of variable SSU rRNA regions (V4 and V7) also indicates that the present myxosporean is close to C. kurisi . Size-wise, V4 and V7 regions of estuarine species appear closer to those of freshwater species and are far shorter than C. careni , a parasite of frogs. In C. ellipticum , C. legeri , and C. trijugum , the V4 region is longer, varying from 379 to 387 bp, while V7 is shorter having 141–154 bp. These variations may also contribute to the unusual positioning of these three gallbladder-infecting freshwater species in phylogenetic trees. Smaller values of V4 and V7 in elasmobranchs justify the formation of a well-supported marine elasmobranch clade (Holzer et al. ; Jirků et al. ; Liu et al. ; Zhang et al. ).
Prevalence of C. agrusi n. sp. infection decreased progressively with host size, and fish in the 10–15-cm length class showed the highest prevalence. Chances of contracting myxosporean infections depend on various factors including mode of life, feed and feeding preferences, immune status, and age/size of the host. In brackish-water habitats, young S. argus usually prefer mangroves, where the risk of transmission by contact with actinospores shed from infected polychaetes is high. Yemmen et al. ( ) have also observed decreasing prevalence of Zschokkella soleae infection with increase in size of its fish host, Solea solea . In the present study, prevalence of C. agrusi n. sp. infection showed significant differences between seasons, with October–December (winter) recording the highest prevalence and April–June (summer) the lowest. This pattern has been reported from many species of Ceratomyxa including C. shasta , C. buri , and C. seriolae (Hendrickson et al. ; Yokoyama and Fukuda ; Alama-Bermejo et al. ). Water temperature is known to influence the prevalence of many myxosporeans through direct influence on their development in fish. Availability of infective actinospores in the habitats can also vary with seasons, thereby affecting the prevalence (McGeorge et al. ; Kent et al. ; Yokoyama ; Canning and Okamura ).
Genus Chloromyxum was erected purely on morphological basis, and mismatches in morphological and molecular/phylogenetic findings warrant a relook into the taxonomic status of this group. Many authors have pointed out the importance of tissue specificity and development in addition to spore morphology while discussing the taxonomy of this genus and myxosporeans in general (Lom and Dyková ; Ferguson et al. ; Bartošová and Fiala ; Gleeson and Adlard ; Atkinson et al. ). However, these issues can be resolved only after detailed morphological, molecular, and phylogenetic analyses (Fiala and Dyková ; Jirků et al. ; Gleeson and Adlard ; Sanders et al. ; Liu et al. ; Zhang et al. ). In view of the morphological, morphometric, and molecular differences with the existing species of Chloromyxum , and considering the differences in host and geographic locations, the present species is treated as new and the name Chloromyxum argusi n. sp. is proposed. This study forms the first report of a species of Chloromyxum from family Scatophagidae.
