Introduction
Sudden cardiac death (SCD) causes more than three million deaths per year worldwide [ , , ]. In three out of four cases, SCD occurs due to ventricular tachyarrhythmia (including sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF)) [ , ]. Treatment and prevention of ventricular tachyarrhythmia and SCD consists of the implantation of cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD) as well as therapy with pharmacological drugs. Currently, pharmacological treatment with “classic” antiarrhythmic drugs has become rare. Primary and secondary prevention of SCD by treatment of the underlying structural heart disease, cardiac pathology, and reduction of cardiovascular risk factors has gained more importance [ , , , , ].
Beta-blockers (BB) reveal multifactorial pharmacological effects, such as reducing sympathetic activity, slowing down sinus rate, inhibiting ectopic beats and triggering mechanisms preventing ventricular arrhythmia and SCD [ , , , ]. Therefore, BB are recommended as first-line pharmacological therapy for prevention of SCD and all-cause mortalty [ , , ]. Prevention of SCD was also shown for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEi/ARB) [ , ]. ACEi/ARB aim to minimize remodeling processes and scarring in patients with structural heart disease and post myocardial infarction, where they may prevent scar-related re-entry tachyarrhythmia [ , ]. Both pharmacological drugs were shown to be effective in the post-MI period associated with the highest risk of developing ventricular tachyarrhythmia and SCD [ , , , , ]. Their importance in improving prognosis in heart failure, especially in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 35% has been proven consistently [ , , ].
Currently, only few studies are available evaluating the impact of both BB and ACEi/ARB [ ], and direct comparative analyses of both therapeutics have been investigated rarely. Moreover, the secondary preventive effect of both BB and ACEi/ARB in patients specifically presenting with ventricular tachyarrhythmia is still unclear. Therefore, this study separately evaluates the prognostic impact of (1) BB vs. no BB, (2) ACEi/ARB vs. no ACEi/ARB, and (3) directly compares prognosis of sole BB vs. sole ACEi/ARB therapy on secondary survival of patients after presenting with ventricular tachyarrhythmia on hospital admission.
Methods
Study Patients
The present study included all patients surviving at least one episode of ventricular tachyarrhythmia on admission from 2002 until 2016 at one institution. Ventricular tachyarrhythmia comprised ventricular tachyarrhythmia, VT and VF, as defined by current international guidelines [ ]. Sustained VT was defined by duration of more than 30 s or causing hemodynamic collapse within 30 s, non-sustained VT by duration of less than 30 s both with wide QRS complex (≥ 120 ms) at a rate greater than 100 beats per minute [ ]. Ventricular arrhythmia were documented by 12-lead ECG, ECG tele-monitoring, ICD, or in case of unstable course or during resuscitation by external defibrillator monitoring. Documented VF was treated by external defibrillation and in case of prolonged instability with additional intravenous antiarrhythmic drugs during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).
The present study is derived from an analysis of the “Registry of Malignant Arrhythmias and Sudden Cardiac Death - Influence of Diagnostics and Interventions (RACE-IT)” and represents a single-center registry including consecutive patients presenting with ventricular tachyarrhythmia and SCD being acutely admitted to the University Medical Center Mannheim (UMM), Germany ( clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02982473) from 2002 until 2016. The registry was carried out according to the principles of the declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the medical ethics commission II of the Faculty of Medicine Mannheim, University of Heidelberg, Germany.
The medical center covers a general emergency department (ED) for emergency admission of traumatic, surgical, neurological, and cardiovascular conditions. Interdisciplinary consultation is an inbuilt feature of this 24/7 service and connects to a stroke unit, four intensive care units (ICU) with extracorporeal life support, and a chest pain unit (CPU) to alleviate rapid triage of patients. The cardiologic department itself includes a 24-h catheterization laboratory, an electrophysiologic laboratory, a hybrid operating room, and telemetry units.
Data Documentation and Assessment of Comorbidities
Using the electronic hospital information system, patients’ files, daily charts, and reports of technical examinations, all relevant clinical data related to the index event were documented. These comprised baseline characteristics, medical history (prior and at index hospitalization), prior medical treatment, length of index stay, detailed findings of laboratory values at baseline, data derived from all non-invasive or invasive cardiac diagnostics and device therapies, such as coronary angiography and electrophysiological examination, data being derived from prior or newly implanted cardiac devices, including already implanted at index and implanted cardiac defibrillators (ICD) at follow-up, pacemaker or cardiac contractility modulation (CCM), imaging modalities, such as echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI), and discharge medication. All comorbidities were documented, including the history of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), cardiogenic shock, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), potassium disorder, cardiac arrhythmia, acute and chronic heart failure, stroke, intracranial bleeding, chronic kidney disease, cardiomyopathy, and atrial fibrillation. Documentation period lasted from index event until 2016. Documentation of all medical data was performed by independent cardiologists at the time of the patients’ individual period of clinical presentation, being blinded to final data analyses.
Risk Stratification
For the present study, all patients surviving index hospitalization after presenting with ventricular tachyarrhythmia between 2002 and 2016 were included. Patients not surviving index hospitalization were excluded.
Risk stratification was performed according to the presence of BB or ACEi/ARB at discharge: Firstly, the prognostic impact of “BB” was compared to “no BB” and the prognostic impact of “ACEi/ARB” was compared to “no ACEi/ARB.”
The “BB”-group comprised patients with BB, the “ACEi/ARB”-group comprised patients with ACEi or ARB at discharge from index hospitalization. All kinds of BB and ACEi/ARB were allowed and individual dosages at discharge were documented. All other medical therapies apart from BB or ACEi/ARB were allowed.
Finally, patients receiving BB without ACEi/ARB (“BB only”) were compared to patients receiving ACEi/ARB without BB (“ACEi/ARB only”) to directly compare both single therapeutic regiments.
Indication to treat patients with BB and/or ACEi/ARB was based on European guidelines on heart failure and ventricular tachyarrhythmia [ , ].
Outcomes
The primary prognostic outcome was all-cause mortality during the follow-up period until 2016. All-cause mortality was documented using our electronic hospital information system and by directly contacting state resident registration offices (“bureau of mortality statistics”) across Germany. Identification of patients was verified by place of name, surname, day of birth, and registered living address. In 48 patients, no data on patients’ survival could have been retrieved, as those patients were even not reachable by telephone, and therefore, these patients were excluded from final analyses (i.e. corresponding lost to follow-up rate of 1.7%).
Propensity Score Matching
In randomized controlled trials (RCT) patients with or without a specific treatment (such as BB, ACEi/ARB, or both) would have a 50% chance to be treated and balanced measured and unmeasured baseline characteristics would be expected. In an observational study, recruiting “real-life” patients, the specific treatment would not be randomized resulting in varying chances between 0 and 100% to receive it including imbalances in baseline characteristics. Therefore, differences of outcomes in specific treatment groups might be explained by heterogeneous distribution of baseline characteristics. To reduce this selection bias, we used 1:1 propensity scores for the receipt of a specific discharge medication (i.e., BB or ACEi/ARB, or both) to assemble a matched cohort, in which patients receiving and not receiving the discharge medication would be well-balanced regarding all measured baseline characteristics.
1:1 propensity score matching was performed including the entire study cohort applying a non-parsimonious multivariable logistic regression model using patients with the specific “treatment” as the dependent variable [ , ]. Propensity scores were created according to the presence of the following independent variables: age, gender, diabetes, chronic kidney disease (glomerular filtration rate < 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), left ventricular dysfunction, CPR, AMI, atrial fibrillation, presence of an implanted cardiac defibrillator (ICD), and underlying ventricular tachyarrhythmia (i.e., VT/VF) on admission.
Based on the propensity score values counted by logistic regression, for each patient in the “treatment group” one patient in the control group with a similar propensity score value was found (accepted difference of propensity score value < 5%). Propensity scores were calculated for the following comparative analyses: (1) Prognostic impact of “BB” compared to “no BB” and (2) prognostic impact of “ACEi/ARB” compared to “no ACEi/ARB.” (3) Prognostic impact of “BB only” compared to “ACEi/ARB only.”
Statistical Methods
Statistics were only performed within the propensity score-matched cohorts. Quantitative data are presented as mean ± standard error of mean (SEM), median and interquartile range (IQR), and ranges depending on the distribution of the data and were compared using the Student’s t test for normally distributed data or the Mann-Whitney U test for nonparametric data. Deviations from a Gaussian distribution were tested by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Spearman’s rank correlation for nonparametric data was used to test univariate correlations. Qualitative data are presented as absolute and relative frequencies and compared using the chi 2 test or the Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate. Univariable Kaplan-Meier survival curves were calculated. Multivariable Cox regression models were developed using the “forward selection” option, where only statistically significant variables ( p < 0.05) were included and analyzed simultaneously. Multivariable Cox regressions were applied in propensity-matched cohorts and here within stratified according to pharmacological treatment. Hazard ratios (HR) are given together with 95% confidence intervals. Follow-up periods for evaluation of all-cause mortality were set at 3 years (= long-term). Patients not meeting long-term follow-up were censored. The result of a statistical test was considered significant for p < 0.05, and a statistical trend for p < 0.10. SAS, release 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) and SPSS (Version 25, IBM, Armonk, New York) were used for statistics.
Results
Study Population
A total of 972 consecutive patients surviving venricular tachyarrhythmia between 2002 and 2016 were finally included (Fig. 1 , flow chart, matched cohorts (anaylses 1 and 2 = 444 + 528). Patients’ characteristics, comorbidities, and survival data are presented in Table 1 for “BB” compared to “no BB” and in Table 2 for “ACEi/ARB” compared to “no ACEi/ARB” therapy. Target dosages were reached already at discharge, as seen for metoprolol as the most frequently administered BB (mean dosage 77 mg/day), followed by carvedilol (mean dosage 21 mg/day) and bisoprolol (mean dosage 6 mg/day), as well as ramipril as the most frequently applied ACEi/ARB (mean dosage 5 mg/day) (Supplemental Table 1 ).

The rates of VT and VF were similar in all groups (“BB” vs. “no BB”: VT 62–64%, VF 37–38%; “ACEi/ARB” vs. “no ACEi/ARB”: VT 62–66%, VF 34–38%). The median age was 64 years. Prior medical history and comorbidities at index were evenly distributed, including AMI, cardiogenic shock, and atrial fibrillation despite a slightly higher rate of arterial hypertension in “ACEi/ARB” patients (Table 2 ). In contrast, the degree of LV dysfunction and implanted cardiac devices was equally distributed across all subgroups.
Prognostic Impact of “BB” Therapy
The overall median follow-up time of the study cohort was 4.8 years (IQR 705 days to 8.3 years). Already at 3-years of follow-up, “BB” patients had significantly better survival compared to no “BB” patients (long-term mortality rate: 18 versus 27%; log rank p = 0.041; HR = 0.661; 95% CI = 0.443–0.986; p = 0.043) (Fig. 2 , left panel). Univariable benefit of “BB” compared to “no BB” was still evident in VF (log rank p = 0.076), LVEF < 35% (log rank p = 0.069) and in patients without an activated ICD (log rank p = 0.025) (data not shown). Fig. 2 Kaplan-Meier survival curves comparing the prognostic impact of “BB” to “no BB” (left panel) and “ACEi/ARB” to “no ACEi/ARB” (right panel) on secondary survival after ventricular tachyarrhythmia
Within multivariable adjusted Cox regression models, “BB” still revealed prognostic benefit over “no BB” patients (HR = 0.594; 95% CI 0.395–0.896; p = 0.013) (Fig. 3 , left panel). Fig. 3 Even after multivariable adjustment, both “BB” (left panel) and “ACEi/ARB” (right panel) were associated with improved long-term prognosis, CKD chronic kidney disease, Card.

After excluding patients with “ACEi/ARB” from the “BB” group, the prognostic benefit of “BB” was still evident (data not shown).
Prognostic Impact of “ACEi/ARB” Therapy
Furthermore, treatment with “ACEi/ARB” was associated with better survival compared to “no ACEi/ARB” as well (long-term mortality rate 13% versus 23%; log rank p = 0.004; HR = 0.544; 95% CI = 0.359–0.824; p = 0.004) (Fig. 2 , right panel). Univariable benefit of “ACEi/ARB” was still evident in VF (log rank p = 0.007), LVEF 54–35% (log rank p = 0.001), LVEF < 35% (log rank p = 0.060) and in patients without an activated ICD (log rank p = 0.001) (data not shown).
Even after multivariable adjustment, “ACEi/ARB” revealed prognostic benefit compared to “no ACEi/ARB” patients as well (HR = 0.526; 95% CI = 0.344–0.806; p = 0.003) (Fig. 3 , right panel). In addition to both drugs, an activated ICD revealed additional prognostic benefit (HR = 0.453 and HR = 0.505).
After excluding patients with “BB” from the “ACEi/ARB” group, the prognostic benefit of “ACEi/ARB” was still evident (data not shown).
Prognostic Impact of “BB Only” Compared to “ACEi/ARB Only”
Table 3 outlines baseline characteristics directly comparing “BB only” to “ACEi/ARB only” patients ( n = 101 in each group). Directly comparing “BB only” with “ACEi/ARB only” therapy, no difference in long-term survival was observed in between both treatment groups when surviving ventricular tachyarrhythmia at index (long-term mortality rate 21% versus 26%; log rank p = 0.539) (Fig. 4 ).

Discussion
The present study comparatively evaluates the prognostic impact of BB and ACEi/ARB on secondary survival of patients after presenting consecutively with ventricular tachyarrhythmia on admission. It was demonstrated that both BB and ACEi/ARB were associated with improved secondary survival in patients surviving ventricular tachyarrhythmia, especially in patients with VF and those with LVEF < 35%.
The present study confirms the current recommendation for BB as first-line therapy in patients presenting with ventricular tachyarrhythmia, even in the absence of an activated ICD [ ]. Beside targeting cardiovascular risk factors and cardiac pathologies, the role of pharmacological therapies is still under ongoing debate for the prevention of SCD [ ]. For instance, the prognostic impact of BB is usually based on studies investigating post-AMI patients or patients suffering from heart failure. SCD occurs in the presence of relevant CAD in more than 75%, accompanied with a higher risk for onset of ventricular arrhythmia during AMI [ ]. Within the present study, a prior history of AMI (15%) and coexisting AMI at index presentation (16%) was present in many patients across all subgroups with the need for PCI in 26% across all subgroups. In post-AMI patients pharmacological treatment with BB and ACEi/ARB is obligatory [ , ].
BB or ACEi/ARB therapies have oftentimes been investigated for primary prevention of SCD and all-cause death usually in post-AMI patients, such as within the “Timolol” [ ], “Metoprolol Pooled Data” [ ] and “Beta-Blocker Herat Attack” [ ], “SAVE” [ ], AIRE [ ], and “TRACE” trials [ ]. Furthermore, BB and ACEi/ARB are indicated in patients with heart failure and LVEF < 35% [ ] in order to prevent adverse structural remodeling and reduce mortality by preventing SCD [ , , , , ]. Notably, within the MERIT-HF trial [ ], patients with LVEF < 40% revealed a higher prevalence of SCD in patients with NYHA class II and III, whereas patients in NYHA class IV more often died from progressive heart failure.
In contrast, BB or ACEi/ARB have rarely been investigated for secondary prevention after ventricular tachyarrhythmia [ , ]. BB were shown to decrease mortality in 941 patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [ ]. Moreover, Brodasky et al. observed a low incidence of sudden and non-sudden death in 32 patients with either sustained VT or VF and low ejection fraction [ , ]. In contrast to BB, ACEi/ARB were shown to be effective in primary and secondary prevention in 1509 patients with an implanted ICD and LVEF ≤ 30%, where a decrease of ICD shocks was observed in the presence of ACEi/ARB therapy [ ]. However, studies comparing BB with ACEi/ARB are limited. Benefits of both drugs in heart failure patients were seen in a meta-analysis of 12 trials [ ]. In contrast, Landry et al. postulated BB to be more effective than ACEi/ARB to reduce mortality in heart failure and post-AMI patients [ ]. Prognostic benefits were shown for mortality reduction irrespective of the presence of ventricular tachyarrhythmia.
Accordingly, the present study is the first to identify a comparable benefical association of both BB and ACEi/ARB for improved survival secondary to ventricular tachyarrhythmia. Notably, administration of BB or ACE may depend on the type of ventricular tachyarrhythmia as well as on underlying comorbidities. For instance, half of patients had arterial hypertension in need of pharmacological treatment, where ACEi/ARB represent the first-line therapy to decrease arterial blood pressure [ ]. Therefore, a patient with arterial hypertension and ventricular tachyarrhythmia is usually not treated by BB only.
Data from RCTs about BB and ACEi/ARB reveal a clear prognostic benefit of both drug groups in patients with systolic heart failure [ , , , ]. Therefore, investigation of a RCT for the evaluation of the secondary preventive effect of each drug itself—similar to the present retrospectively matched study—may be difficult partially due to ethical considerations, since both treatments are established and recommended by international guidelines [ , ] and different types of ventricular tachyarrhythmia can be additionally caused by various and severe comorbidities affecting multiple pathophysiological pathways. These circumstances indicate the need of a statistical method providing comparability of the treatment and control group. Propensity-score matching represents an alternative statistical method, analyzing patients from an observational trial in a balanced manner, and has therefore gained more importance over the past years [ ]. Applying this statistical method within the present registry, the prognostic impact of both BB and ACEi/ARB therapy was analyzed in such balanced cohorts revealing comparable distribution of important prognosis-relevant comorbidities.
In conclusion, the present study identifies both BB and ACEi/ARB to be comparably associated with an improved long-term survival secondary to ventricular tachyarrhythmia, especially in the presence of VF and in those without an activated ICD.
Study Limitations
This observational and retrospective registry-based analysis reflects a realistic picture of consecutive health-care supply of high-risk patients presenting with ventricular tachyarrhythmia. Lost to follow-up rate regarding the evaluated endpoint of all-cause mortality was minimal. Pharmacological therapies were only documented focusing on discharge medication at index event. Beyond selection bias may not be excluded for instance in patients not surviving out-of-hospital CPR while not being transferred to our clinic, which were not included in the present study. Although, propensity-score matching aims to minimize cofounding, a bias due to parameters not documented within the present study is still possible. All clinical data was documented reliably by individual cardiologists during routine clinical care being blinded to final analyses, alleviating the use of an independent clinical event committee. The present results need to be re-evaluated within even larger and more representative multi-center registry data or even RCT, especially focusing on the impact of BB compared to ACEi/ARB.
