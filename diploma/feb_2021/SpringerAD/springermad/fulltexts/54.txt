Introduction
After the publication of the Dialysis Outcome Quality Initiative guidelines, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) gradually replaced surgical revisions as the primary treatment for dysfunctional dialysis vascular access [ ]. Nonetheless, less than half the accesses remained functional without subsequent restenosis or occlusion [ ]. The outcome was even poorer if occlusion developed, with a 3-month unassisted patency rate that ranged from 30 to 40% [ ]. The most common predisposing factor for access occlusion is anatomic stenosis, which usually occurs at the venous anastomoses or outflow veins, and accounts for more than 80% of occlusions [ ]. Nonetheless, occlusions that develop early after angioplasty may be secondary to non-anatomic causes, such as hypotension, hypovolemia, thrombophilia, and inadequate hemostasis [ ].
Thrombophilias are inherited or acquired predispositions to thrombosis. Studies have reported conflicting results regarding the impact of thrombophilia on dialysis access occlusion [ , , , ]. To our knowledge, no study has investigated the role of thrombophilia in the most critical period, that is, early after PTA. It is crucial to delineate the role of thrombophilia early after PTA because a case-specific antithrombotic strategy, such as vitamin K antagonist or low-molecular-weight heparin administration, may be beneficial in this critical period. Accordingly, we conducted a case–control study to evaluate the role of thrombophilia in early occlusion after PTA for dialysis vascular access.
Materials and Methods
Study Participants
This case–control study involved hemodialysis patients who experienced dialysis vascular access dysfunction and underwent PTA at our institution. Patients who experienced the occlusion of vascular access within 30 days after successful PTA were classified as the case group (early occlusion). For each case, one control patient was selected from among patients who underwent PTA but did not develop occlusion for at least 30 days. They were selected from the procedure log, considering the procedures that were immediately followed the index procedures of the case groups. Both the case and control groups underwent PTA according to any of the following criteria: (1) clinical signs suggesting occlusion or dysfunction of vascular accesses; (2) a 25% reduction in flow rate from baseline; (3) a total access blood flow rate of < 500 mL/min, as indicated by the ultrasound dilution method (Transonic Flow-QC; Transonic Systems, Ithaca, NY); and (4) increased venous pressure during dialysis (three consecutive measurements of dynamic venous pressure exceeding 150 mmHg for arteriovenous fistulas or 160 mmHg for arteriovenous grafts). All occlusion events were confirmed by angiography at the time of thrombectomy. Patients who had a history of vascular thrombosis events in any vascular territory within 1 month before enrollment were excluded. The following data were collected from our database of dialysis vascular access interventions: demographics, access, information on angiography/angioplasty, biochemical data, and medication data. The protocol used in this study conformed to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki (edition 6, revised 2000). Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants. This study was approved by the Institutional Research Board of our hospital.
Angioplasty Procedures
Angioplasty was performed according to the National Kidney Foundation-Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines (i.e., only for patients with clinical indicators of dysfunction and a minimum of 50% diameter stenosis). The stenosis or occlusion was treated by standard endovascular techniques during the index PTA procedures, as described previously [ , ]. The degree of stenosis was evaluated in two orthogonal planes and the greatest degree of stenosis was used for subsequent anatomical measurements. Diagnostic angiography was performed and angiograms of the PTA procedures were independently reviewed by angiographers who were unaware of the patients’ clinical and biochemical data. Single antiplatelet therapy with aspirin (100 mg daily) was used for 3 days after the PTA procedures. Medications for underlying diseases were continued according to their original indications.
Laboratory Analysis
Blood samples of all participants were drawn before dialysis. The blood samples were stored at − 80 °C until analysis. Tests for thrombophilia included evaluation of protein C, protein S, antithrombin III, anticardiolipin antibody (IgM), and lupus anticoagulant levels. The lupus anticoagulant level was measured with dilute Russell’s viper venom time (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Germany). Anticardiolipin antibody concentrations were measured using an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay kit (Autozyme, Cambridge Life Sciences, UK). Antithrombin III and protein C activities were determined via chromogenic assays (Berichrom ATIII, Berichrom PC, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Germany). Functional protein S levels were measured by coagulometry (Protein S Ac, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Germany). The laboratory staff who performed the tests was not aware of the patients’ clinical information. The normal reference range of protein C, protein S, antithrombin III, and lupus anticoagulant levels is the 2.5–97.5th percentile interval of the levels in presumed healthy individuals. The anticardiolipin antibody level was defined as elevated using a medium titer of 30 GPL-U/ml.
Statistical Analysis
Continuous variables are expressed as mean (SD) for normally distributed variables or median (IQR) for non-normally distributed variables. Differences between groups were assessed using Student’s t test for normally distributed continuous variables, the Mann–Whitney U -test for non-normally distributed continuous variables, and the Chi-squared test or Fisher’s exact test for dichotomous variables. The association between early occlusion and dependent variables was analyzed via logistic regression. The effect of thrombophilic factors was evaluated, after adjustment for confounding factors (i.e., age, sex, diabetes, graft access, and acute occlusion), via multivariate analysis. All P values were two-tailed, and a P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software, version 20.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY).
Results
From February to October 2015, 462 patients underwent PTA for dialysis vascular accesses in our institution. Forty-one patients (8.9%) experienced early occlusion within 30 days of PTA (case group). The control group consisted of another 41 patients without occlusion after, at least, 30 days of PTA. The mean age of all participants was 68 (SD 11) years and the median age of dialysis access was 36 (IQR, 16––57) months. Their clinical and access characteristics are shown in Table 1 . There were no differences in demographic, clinical, and medication factors between the case and control groups. The case group had more graft accesses (73 vs. 29%, P < 0.001) and more thrombosis events (67 vs. 15%, P < 0.001) than the control group. No differences in other access factors or procedural factors were found between the two groups.

In the whole cohort, 41 patients (50%) had at least one abnormal thrombophilic factor. Four patients (5%) had protein C deficiency, 7 patients (9%) had protein S deficiency, 3 patients (4%) had antithrombin III deficiency, 13 patients (16%) had increased anticardiolipin antibody levels, and 18 patients (22%) had increased lupus anticoagulant levels. The incidence of individual thrombophilic factor deficiencies was stratified according to the case and control groups (Fig. 1 ; Table 2 ). The case group had a higher incidence of protein C deficiency (10 vs. 2%), protein S deficiency (15 vs. 5%), and antithrombin III deficiency (10 vs. 2%) and increased anticardiolipin antibody levels (22 vs. 10%), but none of these differences were statistically significant (Table 2 ). When combined thrombophilia was defined as the occurrence of any one of these deficiencies, 26 patients (63%) in the case group had combined thrombophilia, compared with 15 patients (37%) in the control group (unadjusted odds ratio [OR], 3.004; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.223–7.380; P = 0.027). When combined thrombophilia was defined as a combination of protein C deficiency, protein S deficiency, antithrombin III deficiency, and increased anticardiolipin, excluding lupus anticoagulant, the case group had an even higher prevalence of thrombophilia compared to the control group (49 vs. 17%, P = 0.004) (Fig. 1 ; Table 2 ).

Stratification by native or graft access was performed to eliminate the influence of access types on the association between thrombophilia and early thrombosis. The case group still had a higher incidence of combined thrombophilic factors compared to the control group, both in the patients with native (73 vs. 39%, P = 0.082) and graft (60 vs. 31%, P = 0.104) accesses. When a combination of protein C deficiency, protein S deficiency, antithrombin III deficiency, and increased anticardiolipin was used to define thrombophilia, the association remained, irrespective of native (55 vs. 18%, P = 0.044) or graft (47 vs. 15%, P = 0.086) accesses (Table 3 ; Fig. 2 ). In univariate logistic regression analysis, graft access, occlusion, and thrombophilia increased the risk of early occlusion after PTA (Table 4 ). After adjusting for age, sex, graft access, and occlusion via multivariate modeling, thrombophilia remained an independent risk factor for early occlusion after PTA, regardless of the inclusion or exclusion of lupus anticoagulant (Table 5 ).

Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study to specifically investigate occlusion within the first month of PTA for dialysis access. We found that synthetic grafts, access dysfunction due to acute occlusion, and combined thrombophilia were independently associated with early post-angioplasty occlusion.
Our study documented a high incidence of early occlusion (8.9%) after PTA for dialysis vascular access. Previous studies have demonstrated that thrombosis of dialysis vascular access is associated with inflammation, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases [ , ]. In patients who received PTA, graft access and residual stenosis increased the risk of post-angioplasty thrombosis [ ]. In the current study, lesion length, vessel diameter, residual stenosis, or vascular complications were not associated with early occlusion after PTA. The only vascular factor associated with early occlusion was graft accesses. Most patient factors were not associated with early occlusion, except for a presentation of acute occlusion and combined thrombophilia. This discrepancy in patients with early occlusion suggests that the pathogenic mechanisms of post-angioplasty occlusion may vary with time.
It is usually thought that most episodes of dialysis vascular access occlusion are due to underlying anatomical abnormalities at the outflow veins. Nonetheless, the mechanism early after angioplasty may be quite different. Indeed, 2–4 weeks are needed for the development of significant stenosis after balloon angioplasty [ , ]. However, the mechanically disrupted vessel wall may trigger an inflammatory response cascade, including platelet activation and thrombus formation [ ]. Therefore, non-anatomical factors, such as low blood pressure, hemostasis, and thrombophilia, may play a more prominent role early after PTA [ ]. The role of thrombophilic disorders in arterial and venous thrombotic events have been described previously [ , ]. Dialysis vascular access involves components of both the arterial and venous systems; however, the role of thrombophilic factors has been inconsistent in previous studies. In the present study, we focused on the high-risk period within the first month of PTA. Given the relatively low incidence of individual thrombophilic factors, no significant difference in any single factor was noted. Nevertheless, when a combination of thrombophilic factors was used, nearly half of the patients had at least one thrombophilic abnormality. Thus, in the early period after PTA, a thrombophilic state was more prominent before complete endothelialization of the disrupted vessel walls.
In this study, a substantial portion of thrombophilic abnormalities was attributed to elevated anticardiolipin antibody levels. The prevalence of increased anticardiolipin antibody levels (22%) in our study was similar to that in previous studies (15.5–29%) [ , , , ]. Increased anticardiolipin antibodies in hemodialysis patients are thought to be due to repeated vascular injury or exposure to artificial cellulose membranes, which is similar to a platelet-endothelium interaction [ ]. The effect of anticardiolipin antibodies on the occlusion of dialysis vascular access has been controversial in previous studies. In our study, patients with early occlusion had a higher prevalence of anticardiolipin abnormalities, but this difference was not statistically significant. This may likely be because of the relatively small sample size of our study.
Currently, there is no consensus on the optimal use, dose, or duration of antiplatelet therapy after intervention for dialysis vascular accesses. In our institution, single antiplatelet therapy is administered for 3 days after PTA. Subsequently, the use of antiplatelet therapy depends on the patient’s medical condition rather than on the explicit goal of preventing access occlusion. In this study, only 32% of the patients in case group and 24% of the patients in control group continued antiplatelet therapy beyond the first 3 days after PTA. The percentage of patients using antiplatelet therapy did not differ between the early occlusion and control groups. In the general population, thrombophilia-related venous thrombosis is treated with anticoagulants. Nonetheless, recent randomized trials have failed to show any benefit of warfarin or the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel in preventing access occlusion [ , ]. Moreover, none of these studies specifically evaluated high-risk patients with thrombophilia. The benefit of antithrombotic therapy in these high-risk patients in the post-PTA period deserves further investigation.
Some limitations of this study should be addressed. First, various degrees of selection bias are unavoidable in a case–control design. Second, the thrombophilic factors were measured after early thrombosis developed. The presence of these factors may be dynamic and may change in response to the occurrence of thrombosis. Third, we did not measure all known thrombophilic factors, including factor V Leiden, prothrombin gene mutation, and activated protein C resistance, since previous studies have found that these mutations are rare in Chinese and Japanese populations, unlike in Caucasian populations [ , , , ].
Conclusion
Patients with graft access who presented with acute occlusion were at a risk of early occlusion after PTA. The prevalence of thrombophilia was high among patients undergoing hemodialysis. No single thrombophilia factor predicted early post-angioplasty occlusion; however, a combination of thrombophilic factors, such as protein C, protein S, antithrombin III, and anticardiolipin antibody levels, were associated with early occlusion after PTA for dialysis vascular accesses.
