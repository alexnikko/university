Introduction
Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder with a worldwide prevalence of 1.4–4.6 affected per 1000 individuals (Jablensky ). The disorder has a substantial genetic background as indicated by family, twin and adoption studies, with an estimated heritability of approximately 80 % (Sullivan et al. ). However, as for many other neuropsychiatric disorders, a complex mode of inheritance is suggested, where several genes and environmental factors might interact (Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium ).
One important genomic region linked to schizophrenia is 15q13–q15, which includes the CHRNA7 gene encoding the subunit of the human α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α 7 nAChR), which is a homopentameric ligand-gated ion channel and one of most abundant nicotine receptors in the brain (Papke ). This receptor is a highly interesting drug target for schizophrenia (reviewed by Freedman ; Leonard and Freedman ).
Initially, the association between CHRNA7 and schizophrenia was based on the linkage of P50 auditory evoked potential deficit, a suggested endophenotype for schizophrenia, to the polymorphic marker D15S1360 located in intron 2 of CHRNA7 (Freedman et al. ). P50 suppression is a measure of unconscious filtering of the second of two paired auditory signals, and the P50 suppression deficit is usually defined by an elevated P50 ratio (amplitude to second stimulus/amplitude to first stimulus). More than 85 % of the schizophrenic patients have an elevated P50 ratio compared to the general population, and the trait appears to be inherited in schizophrenic families in an autosomal dominant pattern, where 50 % of the patients’ first-degree relatives have elevated P50 ratio, regardless of their phenotype (Leonard et al. ). Notably, the P50 suppression deficit in schizophrenic patients and their relatives has been shown to be transiently normalized by smoking, suggesting that nicotinic receptor activation may modify neuronal systems involved in sensorimotor dysfunction (Adler et al. ).
Another similar and widely assumed measure for the ability of the brain to filter out unnecessary information is the prepulse inhibition of the startle reflex (PPI). PPI refers to the suppressing effect that a weak prepulse stimulus has on a healthy individual’s response to an intense, startle-eliciting stimulus (usually a loud sound). Similar to P50 suppression, PPI is impaired in schizophrenic patients and their unaffected relatives (reviewed in Braff et al. ), and smoking also reduces the severity of the PPI deficit in schizophrenia (Kumari et al. ), likely via the α 7 nAChR. Furthermore, blockade of the α 7 nAChR results in loss of inhibition of auditory responses in rodents (Luntz-Leybman et al. ) comparable to the P50 suppression deficit observed in schizophrenic patients, and this impaired inhibition could be normalized by nicotine (Stevens et al. ). Finally, α 7 nAChR agonists and allosteric modulators have a number of effects on cognitive domains relevant to schizophrenia that are independent of PPI (Wallace and Porter ).
The epidemiological, biological and pharmacological data linking CHRNA7 , schizophrenia, deficient P50 suppression, and to some extent PPI together, have intrigued mutation screening studies of the CHRNA7 gene in schizophrenic patients. However, mutation screening of the coding regions of CHRNA7 did not identify any variants associated with schizophrenia or the P50 suppression deficit (Gault et al. ). Similarly, Liu et al. ( ) did not find any association of three intronic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with P50 suppression or PPI deficits in schizophrenic patients. On the other hand, several studies have identified an association of CHRNA7 promoter variants with schizophrenia and P50 suppression. The first study, performed by Leonard et al. ( ), found that the -86T variant [rs149637464, chr15:32,322,712 (hg19)] was significantly associated both with schizophrenia and with an elevated P50 ratio in healthy controls. In contrast to these findings, Houy et al. ( ) did not identify any significant association between the -86T variant and schizophrenia or between -86T and P50 suppression, but found that the -194C variant [rs28531779, chr15:32,322,604 (hg19)] was significantly associated with a decreased P50 ratio.
These data prompted us to investigate the frequency of CHRNA7 promoter variants in a Danish cohort of antipsychotic naïve, first-episode patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. Our aim was to search for an association of CHRNA7 promoter variants with schizophrenia, P50 suppression and PPI.
Materials and Methods
Individuals
In this study, 95 antipsychotic-naïve schizophrenic patients (67 % males and 33 % females) and 450 unaffected controls (68 % males and 32 % females) were included. Patients were recruited from different university hospitals in the catchment area of Copenhagen (both in- and out-patients) and referred to the Center for Neuropsychiatric Schizophrenia Research (CNSR), Psychiatric Center Glostrup, Copenhagen University Hospital. Diagnoses were ascertained with the Schedule for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN), version 2.1 (Wing et al. ) according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria. Psychopathology was assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) (Kay et al. ). Patients with alcohol or cannabis abuse at inclusion were not excluded from the study, but urine analyses for drugs were performed to ensure that no drugs were taken during the examination period.
Healthy controls were either recruited from CNSR or Neurobiology Research Unit, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital. All control individuals were evaluated using a SCAN interview to rule out any personal or first-degree family history of psychiatric illness. All the patients and healthy controls were evaluated with a physical and neurological examination prior to inclusion to ensure that they were all physically healthy. Written informed consent was obtained from all the individuals included in the study. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes or saliva using standard methods.
Variant Screening
The CHRNA7 promoter region was PCR amplified from genomic DNA using the forward primer 5′-GGTTGGCAAGACTTCCGAAGCC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′–GTGGCTTTACCGTGCAGGAGCG-3′ (Leonard et al. ). The 618-bp purified PCR product was sequenced using the same forward primer and the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The sequencing product was purified and run on an ABI 3130 XL genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems). The sequence from −391 to +9, relative to the ATG translation initiation site, was analyzed for variants using SeqScape software (Applied Biosystems). Novel variants were verified with bidirectional sequencing using the above-mentioned primers. PCR conditions are available on request.
Electrophysiological Recordings
A subgroup of the patients and controls included in this study was tested using the psychophysiological battery CPTB (Copenhagen Psychophysiological Test Battery). Demographics of these individuals are given in Table 1 . PPI and P50 measurements were taken as described in detail elsewhere (Aggernaes et al. ; Mackeprang et al. ; Oranje et al. ). To keep the data comparable across the studies, only data of PPI trials that were assessed in all the studies were used: trials where a prepulse stimulus (20 ms, 85 dBa) was presented either 60 or 120 ms prior to the startle-eliciting stimulus (20 ms, 115 dBa). Table 1 Demographics of the patients and controls included in the PPI and P50 analyses PPI P50 Controls Patients Controls Patients Subjects ( N ) (male/female) 106 (76/30) 49 (36/13) 80 (59/21) 50 (35/15) Mean age (SEM) 26.7 (0.8) 25.4 (0.9) 26.4 (0.7) 25.4 (0.9) Average PANSS scores (SEM) Positive 19.75 (0.62) 19.86 (0.62) Negative 23.09 (0.9) 22.86 (0.89) General 43.34 (1.21) 43.44 (1.23) Total 86.18 (2.09) 86.16 (2.14) SEM Standard error of the mean
PPI data were obtained from 49 patients and 106 controls and are throughout the current paper presented as: [1 − (PP/PA)] × 100 %, where PP is the average startle amplitude to prepulse–pulse trials, and PA is the average startle amplitude to pulse-alone trials. P50 suppression data were obtained from 50 patients and 80 controls and are given as the ratio of the amplitude of the second (testing or T ) stimulus to that of the first (conditioning or C ) stimulus, i.e., the ratio T / C .
Part of the electrophysiological data included in this manuscript have been published previously (Aggernaes et al. ; Mackeprang et al. ; Oranje et al. ). Thus, as the electrophysiological recordings were performed as parts of these previously published studies, we were not able to test the additional individuals included in this work, explaining why PPI and P50 data are only available for a subgroup of the cohort.
Statistical Analysis
All analyses were performed with SPSS version 21.00 (SPSS. Inc., USA), and a value of P < 0.05 was used as the standard for statistical significance. In accordance with other studies (Cadenhead et al. ; Hetrick et al. ; Kumari et al. ; Kumari ), we found gender to influence some of our data (both PPI and P50 suppression data, see results). Similarly to our previous reports (Aggernaes et al. ; Mackeprang et al. ; Oranje et al. ), smoking (yes/no) did not covary significantly in any of the tests ( P > 0.11, η 2 < 0.02) and was therefore omitted from the analyses. Not all PPI and P50 suppression data were normally distributed; therefore, parametric or nonparametric statistical analyses were performed where appropriate.
Raw startle amplitude was analyzed with repeated-measures ANOVA with between-factor “group” (controls vs. patients) and within-factor “trial” (pulse alone and the two prepulse–pulse combinations). Group effects in PPI were analyzed by ANOVA with between-factor “group” and within-factor “SOA (stimulus onset asynchrony)” (60/120 ms).
Raw P50 amplitude data were analyzed by repeated-measures ANOVA with between-factor “group” and within-factor “stimulus” (average amplitude to C- vs. T -stimuli). Similarly, P50 suppression (ratio T / C ) was analyzed by repeated-measures ANOVA with between-factor “group.”
Possible associations of promoter variants with schizophrenia were analyzed by case–control comparison using the Chi-square test.
Results
Association with Schizophrenia
Variant screening of the CHRNA7 promoter was performed on 95 schizophrenic patients and 450 gender-matched control individuals [there was no significant difference in the male:female ratio between patients and controls ( P > 0.05)]. A total of nine different variants, including two novel variants, were identified. The total number of patients and controls with variants are given in Table 2 . Twenty-two out of 95 patients (23 %) and 92 out of 450 controls (20 %) had a CHRNA7 promoter variant ( P > 0.05). However, the number of schizophrenic patients who had the -194C variant was significantly higher compared to controls ( χ 2 = 4.74; df = 1; P = 0.030).

Assuming an additive model where individuals homozygous for the -194C variant are at higher risk of developing schizophrenia compared to heterozygous, thus, based on the allele frequencies, the -194C variant was again shown to be significantly associated with schizophrenia ( χ 2 = 4.15; df = 1; P = 0.042). Individuals with the -194C allele carried significantly higher odds for schizophrenia compared to those with the wild-type -194G allele (OR 2.02; 95 % CI 1.01–4.04).
Two schizophrenic patients and one control individual carried two different promoter variants, of which the -194C was one of the variants in one of the patients (data not shown). The presence of double variants was significantly associated with schizophrenia ( χ 2 = 5.08; df = 1; P = 0.024; OR 9.66). Due to the small number of individuals with two variants, the confidence interval was very large but still positive (95 % CI 0.87–107.60).
Two novel variants, -66G and -81G, were identified in one control individual and one schizophrenic patient, respectively. When assessing the functional relevance of these variants using the online computer program SIGNAL SCAN (Prestridge ), the change of a thymine to a guanine at position -81 introduces a putative new binding site for the Sp1 transcription factor, whereas the -66A → G variant was not predicted to introduce or interrupt the binding site of any transcription factor.
P50 Suppression and PPI
The groups of patients and controls from whom we had psychophysiological data did not differ in age ( t < 0.97, P > 0.33) or gender ( χ 2 < 0.52, P > 0.69) composition. The patients were moderately to severely ill as can be inferred from their PANSS score (Table 1 ).
P50 Data
The analysis of the raw amplitude data showed a significant main effect of stimulus only [ F (1,128) = 209.5, P < 0.001, η 2 = 0.62], indicating the usual drop in amplitude to T -stimuli, compared to C -stimuli, regardless of group. Neither a significant main effect of group [ F (1,128) = 0.33, P = 0.57, η 2 = 0.003] nor a group*stimulus interaction effect [ F (1,128) = 1.78, P = 0.18, η 2 = 0.014] was found. Similar to the raw amplitude data, analysis of the P50 suppression data ( T / C ratio) showed no main effect of group [ F (1,128) = 1.32, P = 0.25, η 2 = 0.01]. No significant gender effects were found in the P50 data. The P50 data for patients and controls are given in Table 3 . A grand average graph of the P50 suppression data is illustrated in Fig. 1 .

PPI Data
Analysis of the raw startle amplitude data showed a significant effect of trial type [ F (2,152) = 71.2, P < 0.001, η 2 = 0.48], indicating significantly reduced amplitudes in prepulse–pulse trials compared to pulse-alone trials. We found no effect of group [ F (1,153) = 2.43, P = 0.121, η 2 = 0.016] and no interaction effect between trial and group [ F (2,152) = 1.01, P = 0.37, η 2 = 0.013]. The main analysis of the (percentage) PPI data showed neither significant main effects of group, trial, nor an interaction effect between trial*group ( P > 0.31, η 2 < 0.17], indicating no differences in percentage PPI between patients and controls, regardless of trial type. Although we did find a main effect of gender [ F (1,152) = 4.31, P = 0.04, η 2 = 0.028], covarying for this effect did not change these PPI results. The PPI data for patients and controls are given in Table 4 .

Association of CHRNA7 Promoter Variants with P50 and PPI
Even though we did not observe any differences in P50 suppression or PPI between patients and controls in the current sample, we investigated the association of the -194 promoter variant with these electrophysiological variables. Table 5 shows the results of P50 suppression and PPI in all individuals, in the presence or absence of the -194C allele. There was no significant difference in P50 suppression between individuals with and without the -194C allele ( P > 0.05). Similarly, no difference in the mean PPI values (60 and 120 ms) or startle magnitude in pulse-alone trials was observed in individuals with and without the -194C allele ( P > 0.05). Finally, we investigated whether the presence of any CHRNA7 promoter variant would have an effect on the P50 or PPI values (Table 6 ). The startle magnitude to pulse-alone trials was significantly higher among individuals with a CHRNA7 promoter variant compared to individuals without a variant ( z = 2.64, P = 0.008); however, such an effect was observed neither for P50 ratios nor for PPI ( P > 0.05).

Discussion
The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between CHRNA7 promoter variants and schizophrenia, P50 suppression and PPI using a cohort of 545 Danish antipsychotic-naïve schizophrenic patients and healthy controls.
Through screening of the CHRNA7 promoter region, we found a significant association of the -194C variant with schizophrenia. This variant and five other promoter variants have previously been found to be significantly over-represented among patients with schizophrenia compared to controls (Leonard et al. ). However, this is the first study where -194C isolatedly is associated with schizophrenia, while in contrast to Leonard et al. ( ), we did not observe an association of all six variants (including -194C) with schizophrenia when considered together (data not shown). This could be due to differences in the clinical characteristics, number or ethnicity of investigated individuals between the studies; we included 95 patients and 450 controls, most of whom were native Danes, while Leonard et al. investigated 195 American patients and 165 controls of mixed ethnicity. Although the total number of individuals investigated in our study is larger, Leonard et al. included twice as many patients in their study. Thus, if CHRNA7 promoter variants are more prevalent in schizophrenic patients, this could explain why we did not observe a general association of these variants with schizophrenia. It is also clear that ethnicity plays a role, as several of the investigated variants were only observed in African-Americans (Leonard et al. ) explaining why we did not observe them in our cohort of Caucasian individuals. Finally, it is possible that not all variants within the CHRNA7 promoter contribute to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia.
In addition to the previously published CHRNA7 promoter variants, we identified two novel variants, -66G and -81G identified in one control individual and one schizophrenic patient, respectively. Using in silico analysis, -81G was predicted to introduce a Sp1 transcription factor binding site, similar to -194C, and is therefore expected to result in decreased CHRNA7 expression. In contrast, -66G was suggested to be neutral with regard to a structural effect.
Previous functional studies using a luciferase gene reporter assay show that presence of the -194C variant significantly reduces the CHRNA7 promoter activity, possibly through introduction of a Sp1 transcription factor binding site (Leonard et al. ). This suggests that presence of the -194C variant, and potentially the -81G variant, would decrease CHRNA7 transcription and, thus, likely result in reduced α 7 nAChR subunit synthesis, and α 7 nAChR maturation and function. This could correspond to the lower α 7 nAChR-dependent neurotransmission underlying some cognitive symptoms in schizophrenia and the need for α 7 nAChR-enhancing drugs in treatment (Thomsen et al. ).
P50 and PPI recordings were performed on a subset of individuals included in this study. We did not find significant differences in PPI and P50 suppression in patients compared to controls, in spite of the fact that we have previously shown such a relation (Aggernaes et al. ; Düring et al. ; Oranje et al. ). The lack of difference between patients and controls with respect to these electrophysiological parameters is likely due to the differences in composition of the current sample compared to previous, uncombined, samples. The -194C variant was significantly associated with a decreased P50 ratio in a French Caucasian population (Houy et al. ), suggesting that -194C could have a protective effect against sensory gating deficits in schizophrenia. These results are in contrast to our findings, where we did not observe any significant association between -194C and the P50 ratio, perhaps because the -194C variation does not have an actual effect on P50 suppression, but is in linkage disequilibrium with another causative variant in the French population, but not in the Danish population. Even though we did not observe an effect of the -194C variant on P50 suppression or PPI, we observed a significant association with the presence of schizophrenia. This could indicate that -194C is a risk allele for one or several other endophenotypes for schizophrenia, e.g., other electrophysiological or cognitive parameters, reflecting the complex etiology of the disorder.
To our knowledge, this is the second study investigating the involvement of CHRNA7 on PPI. In line with the findings of Liu et al. ( ), we did not observe a significant association between the presence of CHRNA7 promoter variants and reduced PPI levels. Thus, the results of the present study do not imply that the genetic association of CHRNA7 with schizophrenia acts through the PPI or P50 gating mechanisms. However, as we observed a significant association of CHRNA7 promoter variants with elevated startle magnitude on pulse-alone trials, this could indicate that sensory registration of stimuli is directly affected by changes in CHRNA7 expression.
In conclusion, we identified a significant association of the -194C variant with schizophrenia but not with P50 suppression or PPI. We suggest that other CHRNA7 promoter variants may have an effect on yet undefined sensory or sensorimotor gating mechanisms impaired in schizophrenia. This study should be considered exploratory as none of the results reached statistical significance when corrected for multiple testing. Future studies should address the question of a suggested role for -194C on α 7 nAChR function and its potential effect on cognitive parameters such as attention, learning and memory.
