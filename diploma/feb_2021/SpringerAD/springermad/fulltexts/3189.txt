Introduction
Lung disorders, primarily pneumonia, are considered to be a major cause of death worldwide [ , ]. The antimicrobial therapy has considerably reduced outbreak of pneumonia, but there are instances reported on the failure of this therapy. This was primarily owing to increased antimicrobial-resistant pathogenic microorganisms, which resulted in the administration of ineffective treatments [ ]. Following administration, the drug travels freely through the body and also accumulates in other parts apart from the infection site. High dosage and repeated ingestion of antibiotics in the treatment of pneumonia lead to inappropriate disposition of the drug and thus increase in undesirable effects. Additionally, subtherapeutic antibiotic concentration at the infection site and prolong usage of antibiotic have also led to antibiotic resistance [ ]. These issues facilitate the requirement of a targeted drug delivery model to maximize therapeutic efficacy against pneumonia.
The drug resistance and adverse effects are the major concerns in use of any antibiotics, which can be minimized by targeting optimal antibiotic dose to the site of infection [ ]. Levofloxacin has been considered as one of the foremost fluoroquinolone agent used for treatment of pneumonia in recent past. The parenteral use of levofloxacin has significantly reduced the duration of treatment, length of hospital stay, cost, and mortality. The use of levofloxacin in the treatment of pneumonia is recommended based on the fact that it offers documented efficacy and tolerability. To add on, the levofloxacin is approved for the treatment of drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumonia and has extensively been included in various guidelines and formularies [ , ]. The existing pharmacodynamic parameters of levofloxacin indicate that a high dose would be required to ensure efficacy against drug-resistant S. pneumonia [ ].
High-dose (750 vs 500 mg), short-course therapy (7 vs 5 days) of levofloxacin when administered orally was found to be effective in the treatment of pneumonia, which minimized medical cost by reduced treatment duration and hospital stay of the patient. However, there was slight increase in the adverse effects [ ]. The use of levofloxacin may lead to common adverse effects such as gastrointestinal disturbances, central nervous system toxicity, phototoxicity, cardiotoxicity, arthropathy, and tendon toxicity [ , ]. Hence, with conventional dose, the concept of drug targeting hypothesis helps to achieve optimum serum concentration and desired pharmacological action. The role of drug targeting was found to be evident considering various parameters such as pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and clinical factors [ ]. Additionally, development of targeted drug improves health care approach toward treatment of pneumonia and promises survival of the patients [ ]. Many drugs such as enrofloxacin [ ], carboplatin [ ], tobramycin [ ], and biotinylated epithelial growth factor [ ] have been successfully formulated as microspheres for lung targeting. Hence, the current study with an intent of targeting levofloxacin to lungs was encapsulated by way of gelatin microspheres.
On intravenous administration, microspheres with 7–15 μm particle range are capable of being entrapped by lung capillaries [ ]. In the recent past, a great deal of awareness has been observed in the preparation of microspheres using gelatin for targeted drug delivery. The rationale was to specifically deliver the drug to the target tissues or cells by evading other tissue from undesirable effect [ ]. Earlier study has shown that levofloxacin targeting to lungs using poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) polymers has been found be successful [ ]. Although, the use of PLGA and alginate has also been reported as useful pulmonary drug delivery carriers, few unique properties of the gelatin make it an ideal carrier for lung targeting along with surface modifications [ , ]. Literatures have well documented the major concerns associated with liposomes such as their stability and pharmacokinetics that are still unresolved problems [ ]. Moreover, gelatin microspheres are non-toxic and physically and chemically stable. Further, the presence of carboxyl and amine functional groups on the surface of gelatin enables it to conjugate with biotinylated ligands via avidin. This concept can enhance affinity of the gelatin microspheres with specific receptor such as epithelial growth factor (EGF) primarily present on alveolar epithelial lining of the lungs [ , ]. However, this study was classified to evaluate the in vivo lung targeting efficiency parameters of levofloxacin gelatin microsphere (LGM) as targeted drug delivery.
Materials and Methods
Materials
Levofloxacin was obtained as a gift sample from Karnataka Antibiotic Pharmaceutical Limited, Bengaluru, India. The gelatin purified (prepared by alkaline method-type B bloom strength 250, Merck Specialties Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai, India) was used as a polymer. The Tween 80, heavy liquid paraffin, formaldehyde, and acetone were purchased from Merck Specialties Pvt. Ltd. The other reagents used were of analytical grade.
Analytical Method for Estimation of Levofloxacin
Quantitative determination of levofloxacin was done by reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) [ ]. The Phenomenex TM -C 18 column (15 cm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) was used as an analytical column, and the UV detector was set at 294 nm. Mobile phase in the ratio of 84:16:04 mL/mL consisted 0.04 M phosphoric acid solution, acetonitrile, and triethanolamine, respectively. The injection volume was 20 μL with flow rate of 1 mL/min. The retention time of the drug peak was observed at 9.00 min, and the limit of detection was 0.4 ng/mL.
Experimental Design
In this study, central composite design (CCD) was utilized to investigate the effect of formulation variables on dependent factors. The Design-Expert software (v.8.0.7.1 Trial Stat-Ease Inc., Minneapolis, USA) was used for optimization. The model contained eight factorial points, six axial points, and six center points. The mean value was set as 0, and +1 and −1 was considered as higher and lower levels for each factor, respectively. To determine the effect of independent variables on response variables, the data was subjected to analysis of variance. In addition, response surface plots were also calculated to show the associations between these two variables. The selected factors with their levels are summarized in Table 1 . The residuals between expected and observed value suggest that the optimized microspheres were desirable.

Preparation of LGM Intended for Lung Targeting
The gelatin-based levofloxacin microspheres intended for lung targeting was prepared by emulsion method [ ]. The gelatin concentration, stirring speed, and the volume of Tween 80 varied as depicted by central composite design for the purpose of optimization (Table 1 ). The gelatin solution (gelatin dissolved in 10 mL of water) was warmed, and 500 mg of levofloxacin was incorporated into the solution. The resultant solution was stirred for 25 min at 25 °C and preheated to 80 °C. At the same temperature, 50 mL of the heavy liquid paraffin previously warmed to 80 °C was added to above solution. Tween 80, as an emulsifying agent, was added, and the mixture was homogenized (IKA ® T25 digital, ULTRA-TURRAX) at 2000 rpm for 10 min to obtain water in oil emulsion. The formed microspheres were stabilized by stirring the mixture with 0.1 mL of formaldehyde solution (25 % w / v ). After stirring for 15 min, the emulsion was quickly cooled to 5 °C. To dehydrate and flocculate coacervated particles, the emulsion was treated with 100 mL of acetone. The microspheres were separated by filtering the emulsion through a sintered glass filter.
Particle Size Measurement
The particle size analysis [ ] was carried out by photon correlation spectroscopy in Malvern Meta sizer, UK (He–Ne laser beam at wavelength of 633 nm and 90° scattering angle). Five milligram of the microspheres was dispersed in 10 mL of ethanol. The PCS software (Malvern Instruments Inc.) was used for data processing.
Estimation of Drug Encapsulation Efficiency
The drug encapsulation efficiency was estimated by high-speed centrifugation method [ ]. Ten milligrams of the microspheres was mixed with 10 mL of the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), vortexed for 1 min, and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 20 min. The PBS was prepared by dissolving 0.2 g of potassium chloride, 1.44 g of disodium hydrogen phosphate, and 0.24 g of dihydrogen potassium phosphate in 800 mL of distilled water. The pH was maintained at 7.4, and the volume was made upto 1000 mL [ ]. The free drug content in the supernatant was subjected to UV spectroscopy at a wavelength of 294 nm. The total drug content was estimated in similar way by dissolving 10 mg of the microspheres in 10 mL of methanol for demulsification, and then, 1 mL of the solution was diluted 10 times with PBS. The D t was calculated total drug minus free drug. Equation (1) was utilized to determine the drug encapsulation efficiency. $$ \mathrm{Drug}\ \mathrm{encapsulation}\ \mathrm{efficiency}\ \left(\%\right) = \frac{D_{\mathrm{t}}}{M_{\mathrm{t}}} \times 100 $$ (1)
where D t is the amount of encapsulated drug in microspheres and M t is the microsphere quantity.
X-ray Diffraction Analysis
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis (Philips X’Pert Pro, Netherlands) of levofloxacin powder, gelatin, and the optimized LGM was performed at 40 kV voltages and applied 30 mA of current (nickel-filtered CuKα radiation). The sample was scanned over a 2θ range of 10–800 with an interval of 0.020 at the rate of 20/min.
In Vitro Release Study of the Optimized LGM
Levofloxacin release from LGM was estimated using Franz diffusion cells [ ]. The cell consisted of a dialysis membrane with MW cutoff of 12,000–14,000 Da (Himedia Laboratories Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai, India). This membrane acted as a barrier between donor and receiver compartment. Hundred milligram of the microspheres dispersed in 1 mL of PBS was placed in the donor compartment. At 37 ± 0.5 °C, 200 mL of PBS was placed in the receiver compartment and stirred on a magnetic stirrer at 200 rpm. At specified time, 1 mL of the solution was pipetted out from the receiver compartment and was replaced with the same volume of PBS. The drug content was determined utilizing the formerly mentioned RP-HPLC method.
Release Kinetics of the Optimized LGM
Various models such as first-order model (Eqn 2), Higuchi square root model (Eqn 3), Baker and Lonsdale (Eqn 4), Koresmeyer–Peppas (Eqn 5), and Hixson and Crowell cube root model (Eqn 6) models were used to study drug release mechanism from the microspheres. The data was fitted to these models and was analyzed using sigma plot. $$ {Q}_{\mathrm{t}} = {Q}_0\ {\mathrm{e}}^{-{k}_1t} $$ (2) $$ {Q}_{\mathrm{t}} = {k}_{\mathrm{H}}\sqrt{t} $$ (3) $$ \frac{Q_{\mathrm{t}}}{Q_{\infty }}=1 - \frac{6}{\pi^2} \exp \left(\frac{-{\pi}^2 \times Dt}{r^2}\right) $$ (4) $$ {Q}_{\mathrm{t}} = {Q}_0 + a{\left(\frac{t}{r^2}\right)}^n + b{\left(\frac{t}{r^2}\right)}^{2n} $$ (5) $$ \sqrt[3]{Q_0} - \sqrt[3]{Q_t}={\mathrm{k}}_{\mathrm{HC}}t $$ (6)
Q t is the total amount of drug released after time (%); Q 0 is the initial amount of drug (%); k 1 is the first-order release rate constant (h −1 ); k H is the rate constant obtained according to the Higuchi equation (%h −1/2 ); Q ∞ is the percent release at infinite time; D is the diffusion coefficient in the polymer in cm 2 / s ; r is the radius of the sphere in cm; n and 2 n are the release exponent for Fickian diffusion and case II transport, respectively; a and b are constants related to the drug and the structural and geometric properties of the microparticles, and k HC is the rate constant obtained according to the Hixson and Crowell equation (%h −1 ) [ , , ].
Stability Study of the Optimized LGM
The stability study was conducted as per ICH Q1AR2 guideline, intended to test the stability for new substances and product. The optimized preparation was stored at 25 ± 2 °C and 60 ± 5 % RH for 6 months and at 5 ± 3 °C for a period of 12 months. The required volume of microsphere dispersion was stored in closed glass bottles and sealed tightly. At regular intervals, the sample was subjected for determination of encapsulation efficiency, mean particle size distribution, and for any physical changes. The test was carried at 3-month intervals for a period of 12 months for long-term storage condition under refrigeration and at 0, 2, 4, and 6 months for accelerated condition at room temperature.
In Vivo Pharmacokinetic Studies in Albino Mice
The animal experiments were carried out in accordance to the protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee formed under CPCSEA guidelines. Prior to the study, 36 adult male and female, Swiss Albino mice, weighing 20 ± 3 g was fasted for 12 h with free access to water. Prior to drug administration, the animals were randomly divided into two groups with 18 animals in each group. Three animals from each group were sacrificed at each time interval (0.5, 1, 1.5, 6, 8, and 12 h) to determine the in vivo drug distribution pattern. LGM microspheres (12.3 mg of the microspheres equivalent to 10 mg of levofloxacin) were dispersed in 1000 μL of saline with 1 % of Tween 80 and vortexed for 5 s. The control group received levofloxacin (100 μL of saline equivalent to 1000 μg of levofloxacin) solution at a dose of 50 μg g −1 of the mice body weight and was injected intravenously via tail vein over 30 s, while the LGM group was injected intravenously the equivalent content of levofloxacin in LGM [ , ].
Plasma or Organ Isolation and Extraction
At specified intervals, the blood samples were collected from the ocular artery directly from each mouse after removal of eye ball and were placed into heparinized test tubes. By centrifugation (4000 rpm) for 15 min, the plasma was immediately separated. The animals were then sacrificed by cervical dislocation. The plasma and tissue samples of targeted organs such as lung, liver, and spleen were isolated and stored at −20 °C for 24 h. To determine targeted release, the levofloxacin concentration in each organ was estimated by subjecting 1 g (after removal of surface water) of the tissue sample through extraction process. The normal saline (0.1 mL mg −1 ) was added to the isolated organs and was homogenized in an ice bath. To precipitate protein, 2 mol L −1 perchloric acid (100 μL) was added to plasma sample and the tissue was homogenized. Subsequently, 300 μL of plasma or homogenized tissue suspension was added to 450 μL of methanol. The mixture was vortexed for 60 s and then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min [ ]. The supernatant was collected and filtered through a 0.22 μm pore size Phenomenex filter. The levofloxacin concentration in processed samples was quantitatively analyzed by abovementioned RP-HPLC method.
In Vivo Pharmacokinetic Parameters
Change in levofloxacin concentration with time was monitored in blood, lung, liver, and spleen. Based on the analysis of parameters and model, the two-compartment model could best describe the in vivo pharmacokinetics of microspheres in blood. The levofloxacin, area under the curve (AUC), and area under first moment curve (AUMC) were determined from the beginning of the intravenous injection ( t 0 ) to last observation ( t last ) by linear trapezoidal rule with extrapolation to infinite time. Additionally, levofloxacin half-life ( t 1/2 α and β ), distribution rate constants ( K 21 , K 10 , and K 12 ), clearance (CL), mean residence time (MRT), and apparent volume of distribution at steady state ( V SS ) were also calculated. The Kinetica 5.0 PK/PD analysis software was also utilized for the calculation of pharmacokinetic parameters.
Lung Targeting Characteristics
The lung targeting efficiency of LGM was evaluated by using intake rate ( r e ), targeting efficacy ( t e ), overall drug targeting efficiency ( T e ), percentage of drug distributed to lungs ( j ), and peak concentration ratio ( C e ) [ ]. Mathematical relationships, which extrapolate the in vivo data in terms of lung targeting efficiency (Eqs. 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11) were utilized in this study. $$ {r}_{\mathrm{e}} = \frac{\left( AU{C}_0^{\infty}\right)i,\ Test}{\left( AU{C}_0^{\infty}\right)i,\ Control} $$ (7) $$ {t}_{\mathrm{e}} = \frac{\left( AU{C}_0^{\infty}\right) Target- tissue}{\left( AU{C}_0^{\infty}\right)Non- target\ tissue} $$ (8) $$ {T}_{\mathrm{e}} = \frac{{\left( AU{C}_0^{\infty}\right)}_{\mathrm{Target}\ \mathrm{tissue}}}{{\displaystyle {\sum}_{i=1}^n}{\left( AU{C}_0^{\infty}\right)}_i}c $$ (9) $$ j = \frac{{\left( AU{C}_0^{\infty}\right)}_{\mathrm{Target}\ \mathrm{tissue}}}{{\displaystyle {\sum}_{i=1}^n}{\left( AU{C}_0^{\infty}\right)}_i} \times 100 $$ (10) $$ {C}_{\mathrm{e}} = \frac{\left({C}_{\mathrm{p}}\right)\ Test}{\left({C}_{\mathrm{p}}\right) Control} $$ (11)
The intake rate ( r e ) mentioned in Eq. 7 refers to the time-averaged relative drug exposure. The numerator and denominator refer to the time-averaged exposure of any tissue i to drug administered via test and control, respectively. Values of r e > 1 indicate that the tissue “ i ” is exposed to drug to a greater extent following the use of test formulation and vice versa. Although Eq. 7 gives better understanding of relative efficacy of two drug delivery systems in reference to one tissue, it lacks to provide information regarding the efficacy of a given delivery device in terms of the target: non-target tissue distribution of drug. Hence, the Eq. 8 was used to calculate the targeting efficiency ( t e ). The t e refers to the drug targeting efficiency of a delivery system against a given non-target tissue. The values of t e > 1 indicate greater selectivity of the delivery system for the target tissue, as compared to the non-target tissue against which this parameter is estimated. The drug targeting efficiency of a delivery system against a given non-target tissue, a composite, or an overall drug targeting efficiency of a delivery system against non-target tissues, T e , can be calculated as shown in the Eq. 9. The denominator refers to the sum total of drug exposure to all the tissues, including the target tissue. Finally, the time-average distribution of a drug to a given tissue, following the administration of delivery system, can be estimated as illustrated in the below Eq. 10. j (%) refers to drug distributed to the tissue. The ratio of peak concentration C e (Eq. 11) refers to the extent of attaining peak drug concentration of a delivery system against the control. The numerator and denominator refer to peak drug concentration of test and control, respectively.
Histopathological Studies
The animals (12 h post sample administration) were subjected to experimenting process by cervical dislocation. To examine tissue tolerability of the formulation, specified organs (lungs, liver, and spleen) were washed with cold saline. Later, the organs were pressed between filter pads and weighed. Using 10 % formalin, the tissues were fixed and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Under light microscopy with 200× magnification, the tissue samples were examined for any cytoarchitecture changes.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was carried out by using Student’s t test with a P value less than 0.05 considered as statistically significant.
Results and Discussion
Preparation and Optimization of LGM for Lung Targeting
The response surface plots showing the effect of the formulation variables on response factors are shown in Fig. 1 . X 1 at all high level and at all levels of X 2 demonstrated significant effect on the yield. The possible rationale for such a behavior was that the sufficient polymer concentration would increase encapsulation of the drug. Low level of X 2 significantly increased yield at all level of X 1 . X 3 had minimal effect on the yield. X 1 increased mean particle sizes at all levels of X 2 ; mean particle size was moderately decreased up to middle, and later, it improved more than proportional, the particle size being an important parameter for drug targeting with microspheres, as the size helps in discharge of drug in controlled manner and uptake of drugs into tissue. The particle size was found to be a significant factor to distinguish between soluble carrier and particulate systems, the particle size being an important parameter for drug targeting to lungs with microspheres, as the size helps in discharge of drug in controlled manner and uptake of drugs into tissue. In this study, the mean particle size ranged from 6.28 to 19.72 μm. Various other studies [ , ] have reported similar particle size for gelatin microspheres. Fig. 1 Response surface plot showing the effect of gelatin concentration ( X 1 ) and stirring speed ( X 2 ) on a yield ( Y 1 ), b mean particle size ( Y 2 ), c encapsulation efficiency ( Y 3 ), and d 12th hour in vitro drug release ( Y 4 )
Following intravenous administration, over 85 % of 5–15 μm particle size range of the microspheres can get deposited in lungs by mechanical entrapment [ ]. A study by Glenny et al. [ ] reported that blood flow in rat lungs was not significantly affected by 15 μm particle size of the microspheres. Microspheres with 1–3 μm particle size will be removed by reticuloendothelial system and usually accumulate in liver and spleen. The maximum encapsulation efficiency of 81.0 % was observed in this study. At all high level of X 1 , encapsulation efficiency increased at all levels of X 2 . This behavior can be attributed to the fact that at higher gelatin concentration, strong viscous solution decreases the dissolution of levofloxacin in to external phase of the emulsion. At high level of X 1 , 12th hour in vitro drug release was low, and at all levels of X 2 , 12th hour in vitro drug release was moderately reduced. The final equations for Y 1 , Y 2 , Y 3 , and Y 4 are represented below (Eqs. 12, 13, 14, and 15, respectively). $$ {Y}_1=+66.90+3.58{X}_1-0.71{X}_2-0.196{X}_3 $$ (12) $$ {Y}_2=+10.37+3.87{X}_1-0.47{X}_2-0.59{X}_3-0.12{X}_1{X}_2-0.12{X}_1{X}_3-0.37{X}_2{X}_3+0.55{X}_1^2+1.08{X}_2^2+0.55{X}_3^2 $$ (13) $$ {Y}_3 = +81.60 + 6.17{X}_1 + 0.39{X}_2 + 0.29{X}_3 $$ (14) $$ {Y}_4=+92.74-2.78{X}_1+0.23{X}_2+0.37{X}_3 $$ (15)
To generate the finest settings, a numerical optimization by the desirability approach was used. Optimization was carried out for the response variables Y 1 – Y 4 by maximizing yield (%), targeting mean particle size within range of 8 μm, encapsulation efficiency (%), and 12th hour in vitro release within range. The desirable ranges are from 0 to 1 (least to most desirable, respectively) and mainly depends on the response values to predict the optimum formulation. As predicted model, the new formulation was prepared and subjected for characterization. The optimized formula with expected and observed response values along with their residual values is shown in Table 1 .
In Vitro Study and Curve Fitting Analysis of the Optimized LGM
The optimized LGM in vitro release study (Fig. 2 ) showed a minimum of 36.37 % and a maximum of 93.23 % of levofloxacin release at the end of 1st hour and 12th hour, respectively. LGM showed biphasic in vitro drug release viz, an initial burst followed by sustained release at the end. The initial burst was due to the dispersed drug close to microsphere surface, and additionally, high drug encapsulation also contributes to this effect. The diffusion of dispersed drug in polymeric matrix and gelatin erosion would also lead to sustained release of the microspheres. Initial burst effect was required to provide loading dose of the drug to combat high bacterial load which is usually seen during initial phase of the pneumonia [ ]. Fig. 2 Cumulative amount of drug released ( ) optimized LGM and ( ) levofloxacin solution ( bars represent mean ± SD; n = 3)
The release pattern of the optimized formulation on sigma plot has been represented in Fig. 3 . The regression coefficient of Korsmeyer–Peppas model ( R 2 = 0.9959) was most significant among other models. The Korsmeyer–Peppas model illustrates the drug release mechanism from polymeric devices. To describe drug release process, the n value can be obtained by fitting data into Korsemeyer–Peppas model. The n value was found to be 0.40, indicating Fickian diffusion type of release. Due to dispersion of the levofloxacin in polymeric matrix, dissolution may not be rate limiting step, but diffusion of the drug through polymeric matrix was considered to be slowest step for drug release. Various studies [ , ] have showed similar behavior for gelatin microspheres. Fig. 3 In vitro release profile of the optimized LGM curve fitting models ( bars represent mean ± SD; n = 3). Regression coefficient ( R 2 ): Baker and Lonsdale 0.9908, Koresmeyer–Peppas 0.9959, Hixon and Crowell cube root 0.8879, Higuchi square root 0.9774, first order 0.9353
XRD Analysis
XRD of the pure levofloxacin, gelatin, and LGM are shown in Fig. 4 . XRD spectral characteristic of the pure levofloxacin shows many diffraction peaks, indicating crystallinity of the drug. In contrast, the diffraction peaks was significantly reduced in LGM. XRD of gelatin shows one peak, which indicates non-crystallinity. The LGM formulation showed decreased crystallinity of levofloxacin, which was similar to that of gelatin indicating the incorporation of levofloxacin in the polymer. Fig. 4 XRD of a levofloxacin, b gelatin, and c optimized LGM
Stability Study of the Optimized LGM
The stability test observations of the optimized LGM at refrigeration conditions and room temperature are depicted in Table 2 . On storage, no major deviations were observed in macroscopic characteristics. There were no major changes in mean particle size of the optimized formulations stored at 25 °C. On storage, the extent of microsphere sedimentation was not prominent; on manual agitation, they were redispersed easily. Even though, there was slight decrease in the encapsulation efficiency (1.6 %), but was within acceptable range. Thus, the optimized formula confirmed to be stable on long term and accelerated storage conditions as well.

In Vivo Pharmacokinetic Studies
Based on the analysis of parameters and model, the two-compartment model could best describe in vivo pharmacokinetics of the microspheres in blood. The in vivo pharmacokinetic parameters are illustrated in Table 3 . The decisive parameters for penetration into biological fluids and tissues are the drug molecular weight, lipophilicity, and its protein binding [ ]. Compared to control, LGM altered in vivo levofloxacin distribution and the half-life of levofloxacin released from LGM intravenous injection ( t 1/2 ( α ) = 2.746 h, t 1/2 ( β ) = 3.92 h) were prominently higher than the intravenous injection of levofloxacin solution ( t 1/2 ( α ) = 0.262 h, t 1/2 ( β ) = 3.58 h). Gelatin microspheres improve circulatory half-life of the drug by inhibiting drug uptake by reticuloendothelial system [ ]. This data demonstrated the sustained release efficacy of LGM. Levofloxacin concentration in mice lungs (38.32 μg g −1 , 30 min) of LGM was appreciably higher than other tissues and plasma. In comparison, levofloxacin concentration in the lungs of the animals treated with levofloxacin solution was 19.63 μg g −1 after 30 min. An overall 87.14 % of the drug was distributed to lungs when administrated as LGM formulation. A clinical study [ ] has shown that the initial high upfront release of levofloxacin from the microspheres helps in achieving higher levofloxacin concentration required to act against the early bacterial burden at the infection site in lungs.

After intravenous injection of LGM and levofloxacin solution preparations, the distribution of levofloxacin with time was determined in lung, liver, spleen (μg g −1 ), and blood (μg mL −1 ). Levofloxacin concentration in blood and other organs was considered as 100 %. The lung targeting parameters and the peak drug concentration along with their ratios are shown in Tables 4 and 5 , respectively. Tissue and plasma distribution of the drug after intravenous injection of LGM and levofloxacin solution (control) are shown in Fig. 5a, b , respectively. Levofloxacin tissue distribution was found to be higher than plasma concentration in all time points. Levofloxacin concentration in lungs considered to be a vital factor in achieving an effective clinical treatment. The capillary blockade (as a function of particle size) resulting in mechanical filtration leads to accumulation of the microspheres in lung. LGM showed highest value of AUC (899.62 μg h mL −1 ) and r e (5.74) for lung, and the difference was statistically significant ( p ≤ 0.0001). The LGM targeting efficacy ( t e ) of lung increased by a factor of 33.45 (compared with spleen) and ∼12.74 (compared with liver). The targeting ratio of LGM increased by a factor of 26.22 (compared to spleen) and ∼10.58 (compared to liver). Additionally, compared with control, the ratio of peak concentration in lung ( C e ) increased by a factor of 4.63.

Among fluoroquinolone, the longer retain time ( t > MIC) at the target site of levofloxacin and higher estimated pulmonary penetration (0.82) results in relatively short treatment period [ ]. In this study, the gelatin microspheres certainly have further influenced accumulation of levofloxacin particularly in lungs. The presence of many functional groups such as carboxyl and amine groups on surface of the gelatin allows it for surface modification, and mechanically entrapped in endothelial capillary of the lung further increases affinity leading to higher levofloxacin concentration especially in lungs [ ]. Gelatin has binding sites for cell attachment, and it can be broken down by cellular action through the secretion of specific matrix metalloproteinases. Interestingly, this enzymatic breakdown process does not produce toxicity, and gelatin matrices can be completely degraded by cells [ ]. The surface charge usually plays an important role in targeting the microspheres into cytosol by gaining rapid escape from acidic endolysosomes. The electrostatic attraction between the cell membrane (negative zeta potential) with opposite charged on the surface of microspheres increases the adhesion of microspheres to the cells [ ].
The positively charged polymer can significantly increase the drug distribution to lungs. The charged moieties in gelatin can bond with proteins via polyionic complexing, and either anionic or cationic molecule can be sequestered in gelatin matrices, depending on the pH and the type of gelatin used [ , , ]. Improved levofloxacin loading in lung tissues by LGM compared to control confirms alteration in biodistribution of the levofloxacin; thus, the lung targeting characteristic of LGM was evident. The tissue tolerability considered to be a major concern as in microsphere-based targeted system due to accumulation of the drug and excipients in the targeted organs. Histopathology of the mice lungs (Fig. 6a, b ) did not show any degenerative changes in LGM formulation compared to control group. Prominently, there were no signs of edema/lung leak, increase in neutrophils, or activated alveolar macrophage. This confirmed the safety and biocompatibility of the LGM as a parenteral formulation for lung targeting.

Conclusion
This study successfully formulated levofloxacin incorporation into gelatin microspheres for lung targeting. The preparation method, particle size, encapsulation efficiency, in vitro analysis, XRD, and stability study showed favorable results. The AUC, r e , and t e values were appreciably higher in lungs compared to liver and spleen. Additionally, T e , j , and C e in the optimized LGM were significantly increased in comparison with the control. These parameters concluded that high levofloxacin concentration can be achieved by minimizing its inappropriate disposition in other tissues. Thus, gelatin microspheres can be concluded as a good vehicle for lung-targeted delivery of levofloxacin. The improved lung concentration of levofloxacin can allow the dosing convenience and reduce undesirable effects of levofloxacin in the treatment of pneumonia. Further studies can be also carried out to investigate the impact of conjugation of these gelatin microspheres in enhancing the drug permeability and retention in targeted drug delivery.
