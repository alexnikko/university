Introduction
ANCA-associated vasculitides (AAV) are chronic autoimmune diseases that can bring substantial damage to affected organs, mostly by granulomatous and/or vasculitic inflammation. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA; formerly Wegener’s granulomatosis) frequently affects the head and neck region and granulomatous disease can locally spread to adjacent tissues. In generalized disease states, vasculitis can virtually affect every organ system throughout the body. While involvement of the central nervous system and somatic peripheral nerves is well described [ , , ], less is known of the involvement of the autonomous nervous system.
We recently reported that patients with AAV have more symptoms of autonomic dysfunction than healthy controls, though we did not find cardiac autonomic dysfunction measured by heart rate variability during deep breathing [ ]. Symptoms and objective parameters of cardiac autonomic dysfunction have been described in a variety of other autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis or Sjoegren’s syndrome [ , , , , ].
Dynamic pupillometry is an established autonomic testing tool [ ]. Both parasympathetic and sympathetic responses of the pupillary light reflex were shown to be disturbed in patients with autonomic neuropathies [ , , ], but also in autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, SLE and systemic sclerosis [ ]. Some authors found correlations between pupillary autonomic function and clinical parameters such as ocular dryness in rheumatoid arthritis, esophageal motility in systemic sclerosis or disease activity in SLE [ , , ]. Pupillary autonomic dysfunction (PAD) has been found to be associated with mortality in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [ ].
Studies of autonomic functions in AAV may be of interest for several reasons. Like patients with other chronic inflammatory diseases, AAV patients are at increased risk for cardiovascular death which cannot be solely explained by prevalence of traditional risk factors [ , ]. Autonomic dysfunction might be a contributing factor. Cardiac autonomic dysfunction has been associated with a variety of cardiovascular comorbidities, amongst others increased risk for cardiovascular events, adverse outcomes after myocardial infarction, left ventricular remodeling and atrial fibrillation [ , , , ].
The current study aimed to compare sympathetic and parasympathetic responses of the pupillary light reflex between AAV patients and healthy controls. Furthermore, associations with clinical parameters and cardiac autonomic function should be investigated by correlating the results with relevant clinical disease scores and two cardiovascular reflex tests.
Materials and methods
Patients and controls
Patients with a diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) or microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) were enrolled after written informed consent. Clinical parameters were assessed as described before [ ]. Patients with comorbidities that can affect the autonomous nervous system (e.g. diabetes mellitus, inflammatory nervous system disorder other than vasculitis, advanced atherosclerosis, alcoholism, uremia) were excluded. Autonomic function is known to decline with aging. Thus, age-matched subjects (±2 years) without known medical conditions served as controls. Patients that were on concomitant medications that may have an impact on autonomic function (such as antidepressants, beta-blocking agents, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors) were pleased to pause the medication 48 h prior to the assessment if medically justifiable.
COMPASS31 questionnaire
The questionnaire has been validated in its English version for the assessment of symptoms of autonomic dysfunction in patients with autonomic neuropathies [ ]. It comprises 31 questions that cover 6 domains of autonomic organ impairment (orthostatic symptoms; cutaneous vasomotor function; gastrointestinal symptoms; sweating behavior; bladder symptoms; pupillomotoric). Scores can range from 0 to 100 with higher values indicating more severe autonomic dysfunction. A German version of the COMPASS31 was used in the present study as previously described [ ].
Dynamic pupillometry
Infrared dynamic pupillometry was performed in a dark room after an accommodation time of 10 min (compact integrated pupillograph; AMTech Pupilknowlogy GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany). Pupillary light reflex was assessed for both eyes by using a light stimulus of 10.000 cd m −2 and a duration of 200 ms. The following parameters were measured: pupil diameter before light stimulus; maximum constriction velocity; minimum pupil diameter after light stimulus; amplitude of pupillary constriction; relative amplitude of pupillary constriction (amplitude divided by pupil diameter before light stimulus); early dilatation velocity; late dilatation velocity. Amplitude, relative amplitude and maximum constriction velocity reflect the active parasympathetic part of the light reflex, whereas the late dilatation velocity reflects the active sympathetic part [ ]. The early dilatation phase is believed to be mainly driven by withdrawal of parasympathetic activity [ ]. At baseline, light reflex of both eyes was measured in order to rule out side differences. Pupillometry was performed at afternoon, between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m., in order to rule out circadian changes of sympathetic and parasympathetic tone.
Cold pressor test (CPT)
As the baseline diameter is also influenced by the basic sympathetic tone which can be different between patients that are used to a hospital setting and controls that are not, light reflex assessment of the left eye was also performed under sympathetic stimulation. Patients and controls had to immerse one hand into ice water for 5 min. Blood pressure (sphygmomanometry) and pain score on a numerical scale were assessed every minute ( t 0 = baseline; t 1–5 = hand in ice water; t 6 = 1 min after hand retrieval of ice water). During the CPT, pupillometry parameters of the left eye were measured in both patients and controls.
Exspiratory/inspiratory (E/I) ratio during deep breathing test (DBT)
Heart rate variability (HRV) underlies parasympathetic and sympathetic influences. The parasympathetic-controlled part of HRV can be assessed by DBT. E / I ratio during DBT was assessed as described before [ ]. In brief, continuous ECG recording was performed while the patient was asked to breathe metronomically with a frequency of 6 breaths per minute over a period of 2 min. The median E / I ratio is the median quotient of the longest and the shortest RR interval of each breathing cycle.
Statistical analysis
SPSS version 23 was used for statistical analysis. Student’s t test was used to compare variables with normal distribution, and Mann–Whitney U test for comparisons of medians in case of non-normally distributed variables. Bivariate correlations and age-adjusted partial correlations of pupillometric parameters with clinical and cardiovascular autonomic parameters were performed. The study was approved by the local ethics committee (study no. 520-13).
Results
Demographic data
The clinical characteristics of patients are shown in Table 1 . 23 patients and 18 controls were enrolled. Most of the patients had GPA, and only two patients had microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). Of note, controls were slightly younger than patients but the difference was not statistically significant (median 52 years; range 21–79). In addition, the control group comprised more females than in the vasculitis group ( n = 14; 78%; p = 0.025). Eleven patients (48%) had a history of neurological involvement and ten patients (38%) had eye involvement that consisted of episodes of scleritis or episcleritis. No patient had active or recent anterior uveitis prior to pupillometry. Seven patients (30%) had peripheral neuropathy, predominantly affecting the lower limbs. No patient had neuropathic symptoms of the upper limbs. A total of 21 patients (91%) had present or past vasculitic activity in the head and neck region. Most of the patients were in remission at the time of assessment, which is reflected by the low median BVAS score of 1.0. Six patients were on medications with possible influence on autonomic measurements (Table 1 ). The medications were paused 48 h prior to testing in all patients. 17 patients did not take any potentially confounding medication. In the control group, one individual took duloxetine in an on demand schedule, but during the week prior to autonomic testing.

Dynamic pupillometry: patients vs. controls
Patients had a smaller amplitude of the light reflex at baseline and a slower constriction velocity than controls (Fig. 1 ). No significant differences were observed in relative amplitude and slow dilatation velocity at baseline. CPTs provoked an effective pain sensation in both patients and controls. The median maximum pain score was similar in patients (8.0 ± 1) and controls (8.5 ± 1). Both maximum systolic and diastolic blood pressure increases were similar between the groups (patients: median ∆RRsys 19 ± 12 mmHg; median ∆RRdia 12 ± 7.5 mmHg; controls: median ∆RRsys 22 ± 11.5 mmHg; median ∆RRdia 13.5 ± 4.5 mmHg). Differences in pain scores and blood pressure increases were not significant between the groups. Under sympathetic stimulation, amplitude and constriction velocity increased and remained significantly smaller in patients throughout the painful stimulus (Fig. 1 ). Relative amplitude became significantly smaller in patients at t 3 and remained smaller in patients until the end of the painful stimulus. The sympathetically determined slow dilatation velocity increased both in patients and in controls under painful stimulation and patients tended to have lower values than controls. However, the means did not differ significantly at any point in time.

Correlation of parasympathetic parameters in patients
In a bivariate analysis, both amplitude and constriction velocity were correlated negatively with age and positively with E / I ratio (Table 2 ). No significant correlations were found between baseline parasympathetic pupillometry parameters (PPP) and disease-specific parameters. However, there was a trend to a negative correlation with disease duration and vasculitis damage index (Fig. 2 ). No correlations were found for PPP and COMPASS31 total score or pupillomotor subscore, respectively. There was no correlation between clinical disease activity (BVAS score) or CRP and PPP. The relative amplitude did not correlate with any of the demographic or disease-specific parameters.

After adjusting for age, no significant correlation was found between mean PPP (under sympathetic stimulation t 1–5 ) and E / I ratio or parameters of disease activity or scarring (Table 3 ). For disease duration and vasculitis damage index, there was a trend to a negative correlation with amplitude and maximum constriction velocity.

Correlation of sympathetic parameters in patients
In the bivariate analysis, slow dilatation velocity at 2 ( t 2 : r = −0.424; p = 0.044) and 4 ( t 4 ; r = −0.459; p = 0.028) min after painful stimulus correlated negatively with age, but not at baseline or at the other points in time during the CPT. No correlation was seen between slow dilatation velocity and systolic or diastolic blood pressure increase. After adjusting for age, we found no significant correlation between slow dilatation velocity and blood pressure increase, although there was still a trend towards a positive correlation. In contrast to the parasympathetic parameters, not even a trend was seen between slow dilatation velocity and clinical parameters (Table 3 ).
Discussion
To our knowledge, the present study is the first to describe PAD in a representative cohort of patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis. The finding of reduced PPP indicates a higher prevalence of pupillary parasympathetic hyporeflexia in AAV patients than in controls. In addition, patients exhibited reduced sympathetic pupillary parameters (SPP), although this difference was not statistically significant. The most pronounced association of PPP was found with age and E / I ratio. However, no correlation with age was observed for relative amplitude. Autonomic pupillary and cardiac autonomic function are known to decline physiologically with age. After adjusting for age, PPP did neither correlate significantly with E / I ratio nor with clinical parameters. Thus, the correlation between PPP and E / I ratio seems to be determined predominantly by aging and not by disease-associated autonomic dysfunction. In our recent report, there was no difference in E / I ratio between patients and controls [ ]. In contrast, we now identified significant parasympathetic PAD in this cohort, indicating a pattern of autonomic impairment that is rather related to specific organs or nerves with autonomic qualities and not to a generalized inflammatory state. A possible explanation is the frequent involvement of the head and neck region, particularly in GPA patients. 91% of our patients suffered from ENT involvement at any point in time since diagnosis. Chronic inflammation may affect adjacent structures such as nerves with autonomic qualities. On the contrary, vasculitic heart involvement is unusual in AAV and was absent in all of our patients. This could in part explain the different findings of the autonomic function tests.
Assessment of PAD in different autoimmune diseases revealed conflicting results in the past. Some authors found simultaneous prevalence of PAD and cardiac autonomic dysfunction (CAD) while others did not [ ]. Apart from methodological issues, this might be explained by different patterns of autonomic nervous system involvement according to the underlying pathophysiology. Moreover, comorbidities, differences in demographic- or disease-specific parameters such as disease duration, control of inflammatory activity or organ damage may contribute to PAD. PAD has also been linked to the prevalence of esophageal dysmotility in scleroderma, to inflammatory disease activity in SLE and to mortality in rheumatoid arthritis, although the studies were small and not designed to prove causality [ , , , , ].
Taken together, these and our observations indicate that there are different patterns of autonomic dysfunction in autoimmune diseases with potential clinical implications in respect to disease activity, disease phenotypes and potentially mortality. At least in our cohort of AAV patients, however, we found no significant correlations of PAD with markers of disease activity, number of affected organs or damage. Most of our patients were in remission at the time of investigation. The sample likely comprised too few active patients to find an existing correlation with BVAS and CRP. This issue deserves further study. We observed a trend towards a negative correlation of PPP with both vasculitis damage index and disease duration, indicating a possible relationship of PAD with long-term chronic inflammation and structural damage of involved organs.
Of note, there was no link between general and pupillomotor symptoms of autonomic dysfunction. Lacking correlation with COMPASS31 total score may be explained by the localized pattern of autonomic impairment as discussed before. However, one would expect correlation with pupillomotor subscores in case of marked PAD. This lacking correlation in our cohort can have several reasons. First, COMPASS31 score was designed as a sum score. Using isolated subscores may thus be invalid. Second, the sample size may be too small to find significant correlations. However, there was not even a trend towards a correlation. Third, vasculitis patients may be more prone to muscle fatigue than healthy controls. Most of our patients were on low-dose steroids. Although steroid myopathy rather affects the limbs, we cannot rule out that there was some steroid effect on ciliar muscles. In addition, generalized fatigue is a frequent symptom in vasculitis patients and an association with reduced pupillary light reactivity is possible [ ]. Finally, the extent of PAD may be too small to cause clinical symptoms. The absolute values of our patient cohort were in a similar range as values of patients with known mild autonomic neuropathy in the report of Muppidi et al. [ ]. In contrast, patients with more severe autonomic neuropathy in their work had also lower values of absolute amplitude and maximum constriction velocity compared to our AAV patients. Potentially, PAD should be more pronounced than in our patients to cause clinical symptoms.
Our study shows that dynamic pupillometry is a potent tool to assess PAD. Thus, adding pupillometry to other standardized batteries of autonomic testing could offer a more comprehensive assessment of autonomic function in certain patient populations.
Our study has certain strengths. We used age-matched healthy controls (±2 years) instead of established reference values to rule out confounding by methodological differences. In addition, we performed measurements at baseline and serial measurements after sympathetic stimulation in order to minimize confounding by different levels of sympathetic activation (patients are used to the hospital setting whereas healthy controls usually are not). We used well-defined dynamic pupillometry parameters that are known to be more robust than static pupillometry parameters that were used in other studies.
The study also offers some drawbacks. The sample size may be too small to find existing correlations between pupillometry and clinical parameters. Moreover, due to the small sample size we were not able to adequately compare patients with and without PAD. It would be interesting to characterize patients with PAD in more detail in order to investigate possible determinants of PAD and associated clinical outcomes such as comorbidities and mortality. Assessors of pupillometry were not blinded to whether the subject was a patient or control. The control group comprised significantly more females than the patient group. Some autonomic parameters are known to differ in relation to sex, although the effect of aging should be far more important. Six patients had concomitant medications that can affect autonomic testing. Confounding was minimized by pausing the medications 48 h prior to testing. Moreover, the study results remained significant when we analyzed the data of the remaining 17 patients without potentially confounding medication (data not shown). Finally, COMPASS31 score has not been formally validated in German language.
In conclusion, this is the first study that describes PAD in ANCA-associated vasculitis. Patients with AAV exhibit significant PAD that can rather be linked to disease duration and structural damage than to active inflammation or symptoms of autonomic dysfunction.
