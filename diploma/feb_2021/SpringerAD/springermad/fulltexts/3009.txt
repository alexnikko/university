Introduction
Cancer, one of the main leading causes of morbidity and mortality, is a major serious public health problem worldwide [ ]. Growing evidence proposed that interaction of various genetic loci and numerous environmental factors plays a role in cancer development [ ]. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), the common genetic variation in the human genome, are associated with the risk of cancer [ , ].
The human survivin gene, also called BIRC5, is mapped to the chromosome 17 (17q25.3), encoding survivin [ ]. Survivin protein belongs to the human inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) family. Survivin, a 16.5 kDa protein, is the smallest member of IAPs [ , ]. This family of anti-apoptotic proteins includes NAIP, c-IAP1, c-IAP2, XIAP, and survivin [ ]. They prevent apoptosis by binding to the effector caspases and inhibiting their activities [ , ]. IAPs are the central regulator of apoptosis [ ]. These proteins have a key role in the course of carcinogenesis by increasing cell survival through inhibiting extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways, promoting accumulation of genetic changes, and increasing resistance to therapy [ ]. It has been proposed that unlike other IAP members, survivin is highly expressed in most cancers, although it is rarely expressed in normal adult tissues [ ]. As overexpression of survivin is involved in cancer development and metastasis by inhibiting apoptosis [ , , ], the survivin polymorphisms may modulate susceptibility to cancer by affecting the survivin expression.
Survivin is polymorphic and several polymorphisms of the survivin gene have been characterized. Some of these are the rs8073069, rs17878467 and rs9904341 variants located in the promoter, the rs2071214 variant that is a missense one located in exon 5, and the rs1042489 variant located in the 3ʹ untranslated region (3ʹUTR) (Fig. 1 ).
Fig. 1 The structure of survivin gene and the positions of polymorphisms analyzed in this meta-analysis
Several studies have been conducted to assess the association between survivin polymorphisms and cancer susceptibility in diverse populations [ , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ]. But, the findings of these studies are inconsistent. Therefore, we carried out an updated meta-analysis including those newly published articles to find out the impact of survivin rs9904341, rs1042489, rs2071214, rs8073069, and rs17878467 polymorphisms on cancer risk based on all available eligible studies at present.
Methods
Literature search
Relevant publications were identified through a comprehensive search in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases using search strategy “cancer, carcinoma, tumor, neoplasms”, “survivin or BIRC5” and “polymorphism or mutation or variant or rs9904341 or rs2071214”. The last search was up to July 30, 2018.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
To be eligible for inclusion in the quantitative analysis, the study should meet the following criteria: (1) original case–control studies that assessed the survivin polymorphism and cancer risk; (2) studies providing necessary information about genotype frequencies in both cases and controls. The exclusion criteria were: (1) conference abstract, case reports, reviews, meta-analysis, duplication data; (2) insufficient genotype information provided.
Data extraction
Two investigators independently extracted the relevant data from retrieved articles. The following data were collected from each study such as the first author, publication year, country, ethnicity of the participants, cancer type, source of control, genotyping methods, number of cases and controls, frequencies of genotypes and alleles in case and control groups and result of the HWE test (Table 1 ).

Statistical analysis
All statistical calculations were conducted by Revman 5.3 software (Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2014) and STATA 14.1 software (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA). Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) for control groups was tested by Chi square test. Pooled ORs and their 95% CIs for codominant, dominant, recessive, overdominant and the allelic genetic inheritance models were estimated. The Z test was employed to determine the significance of the pooled ORs, and a p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
The Q -test was used to evaluate the between-study heterogeneity. When p > 0.1 indicating lack of heterogeneity, a fixed-effect model was used; otherwise, the random-effects model was applied.
The potential publication bias was assessed by Begg’s funnel plot inspection. The symmetry in plots implied no publication bias. The degree of asymmetry was measured by Egger’s test and p < 0.05 was considered significant. Sensitivity analyses were executed by excluding a single study at a time to assess the relative influence on pooled estimate.

Regarding rs1042489 variant, 7 studies including 1655 cases and 1977 controls proposed no significant association between the variant and risk of cancer. For rs2071214, the findings from 7 studies involving 1774 cases and 2290 controls showed that this variant was not associated with cancer risk. For rs8073069, the data from 6 studies including 1334 cases and 1395 controls suggested no significant association between this polymorphism and cancer risk. Concerning rs17878467 variant, the findings from 5 studies (737 cases and 1093 controls) did not support an association between this polymorphism and cancer risk (Table 2 ).
Subgroup analysis results
Stratified analysis of survivin rs9904341 polymorphism was achieved by ethnicity and cancer type (Table 3 ). The subgroup analysis by ethnicity indicated that rs9904341 polymorphism significantly increased the risk of cancer in the Asian population but not in Caucasians. Also, the findings suggested that this variant significantly increased the risk of gastrointestinal cancer, digestive tract cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, bladder cancer, pancreatic cancer, renal cancer, prostate cancer, endometrial cancer, papillary thyroid carcinoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, breast cancer, and acute leukemia. While, rs9904341 variant was associated with protection against oral cancer, lung cancer and Wilms’ tumor. No significant association was found between rs9904341 variant and risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, urothelial cancer, esophageal carcinoma, skin cancer, and cervical cancer (Table 3 ).

Heterogeneity and publication bias
Heterogeneity among the studies included in the meta-analysis is shown in Table 2 . The findings showed that heterogeneity existed between some studies.
The potential publication bias was assessed using a Begg’s funnel plot and Egger’s linear regression test. As shown in Fig. 4 , the shape of funnel plots was symmetrical and no publication bias was observed. The Egger’s test also indicated that publication bias was not evident (Table 2 ).

Sensitivity analysis
We performed a sensitivity analysis to assess the effect of a specific publication on the overall estimate. The sensitivity analysis revealed that the elimination of an individual study in turn did not change the OR effect of the combined effect, which suggested that the pooled results was stable and reliable in the meta-analysis (Fig. 5 ).

Discussion
Apoptosis or programmed cell death is a physiological mechanism of cell death. The regulation of apoptosis is critical for proper development and function of multicellular organisms. Defects in the apoptosis machinery may lead to various diseases, including cancer [ ]. Survivin, a potent anti-apoptosis factor, is a member of the IAPs [ ]. Survivin plays a role in cancer cell survival and is overexpressed in most common types of cancers [ ]. It has been proposed that mutation in the promoter region of survivin gene may lead to the overexpression of survivin in cancer cells [ ]. It has been shown that the − 31G>C polymorphism (rs9904341) located in the promoter region of survivin gene correlated with gene expression. The − 31C allele has significantly high activity compared to − 31G allele [ ].
In the present meta-analysis, we estimated the association between the survivin gene polymorphisms and cancer risk based on 43 eligible case–control studies [ , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ]. Pooled risk estimates revealed that survivin rs9904341 polymorphism was significantly associated with an increased risk of overall cancer. Stratified analysis proposed that this variant significantly increased the risk of gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, bladder cancer, pancreatic cancer, renal cancer, prostate cancer, endometrial cancer, papillary thyroid carcinoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, breast cancer, and acute leukemia. While, the variant was associated with protection against oral cancer, lung cancer and Wilms’ tumor. The variant was not associated with the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, urothelial cancer, esophageal carcinoma, skin cancer, and cervical cancer. A met-analysis performed by Zhu et al. [ ] aimed to determine the relationship between survivin polymorphisms and the cancer susceptibility. In agreement to our findings, the data from 26 studies proposed that rs9904341 variant significantly increased the risk of cancer. Stratified analysis by cancer types revealed that the variant increased the risk of colorectal cancer, while there was no significant association between this variant and esophageal cancer risk. The variant significantly decreased the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma.
For the survivin rs2071214, pooled analysis from five studies indicated a significant association between this variant and an increased cancer risk [ ]. Our meta-analysis from seven studies did not support an association between rs2071214 variant and cancer risk. For the survivin rs17878467, they found that this variant significantly decreased the risk of cancer [ ]. While our data from five studies did not support an association between the variant and risk of cancer. Regarding rs8073069 variant, they observed that this variant significantly increased the risk of cancer ( n = 3) [ ]. In contrast, we found no significant association between the variant and risk of cancer ( n = 6).
In a meta-analysis from 13 studies, Srivastava et al. [ ] have found that rs9904341 variant significantly increased the risk of overall cancer. Quin et al. [ ] performed a meta-analysis to examine the relationship between rs9904341variant and the risk of overall cancer. They enrolled 29 studies with 7,473 cancer cases and 9086 controls and found that this variant significantly increased the risk of overall cancer.
Zhou et al. [ ] conducted a meta-analysis of the association between survivin rs9904341 (− 31 G/C) polymorphism and risk of colorectal cancer. They enrolled six case–control studies and found that the variant significantly increased the risk of colorectal cancer. The findings is agreement with our stratified analysis by cancer types.
The meta-analysis performed by Liu et al. [ ] from nine studies revealed that survivin rs9904341 polymorphism significantly increased the risk of gastrointestinal tract cancer. Our findings from 11 studies are in agreement with this finding. Relative larger sample sizes in our meta-analysis compared to polished meta-analysis increase statistical power.
Survivin, a member of IAP family, is implicated in inhibiting apoptosis and promoting cell proliferation and cancer development. Overexpression of survivin has been reported to be related with a poor prognosis of several cancers including glioma [ ], renal cell cancer [ ], esophageal cancer [ ], breast cancer [ ], gastric cancer [ , ], ovarian cancer [ ], laryngeal cancer [ ], and colorectal cancer [ , , ].
There are some limitations that need to be noted in our meta-analysis. First, heterogeneity existed among studies. The heterogeneity maybe derived from the difference of ethnicity, cancer type and source of control. Second, gene–environmental interactions were not evaluated due to the lack of relevant data across the comprised studies. Gene–environmental interactions may alter cancer risk. Finally, the small sample sizes of studies for rs1042489, rs2071214, rs8073069, rs17878467 variants as well as subgroup analysis cause low power of data, though we have pooled all published studies.
In summary, our meta-analysis provided an evidence of the association between survivin rs9904341polymorphism and increased risk of cancer. Concurrently, the same results were obtained in stratified analysis of ethnicity in the Asian population, which suggests that the increased risk might be ethnicity specific. Further studies with larger sample sizes focusing on cancer types or ethnicities should be done to confirm the findings.
