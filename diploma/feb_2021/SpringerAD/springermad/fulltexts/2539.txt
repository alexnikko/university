Introduction
Creatine (N-[aminoiminomethyl]-N-methyl glycine) is a guanidine compound synthesized from glycine, arginine and labile methyl groups generated largely through the methionine/ homocysteine cycle in the kidneys, liver and pancreas with a smaller amount derived from diet (Wyss and Kaddurah-Daouk ). Creatine is synthesized in two steps; first through the action of Arginine: Glycine Amidinotransferase (AGAT; E.C.2.1.4.1) that catalyzes the reversible transamidination of the guanidino group from arginine to glycine yielding guanidinoacetate (GAA) and ornithine and secondly through the action of Guanidinoacetate: methyltransferase (GAMT) that catalyzes the S-adenosyl-L-methionine dependent methylation of GAA to yield creatine and S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (Iqbal ). Creatine provides a readily available source of energy in the form of a high-energy phosphate bond. It functions both as a reservoir for ATP derived energy and as a means for moving energy from the site of production in the mitochondria to the sites of consumption, such as the central nervous system and muscles by the phosphocreatine circuit (Wallimann et al. ).
Despite the importance of this metabolic pathway, no inborn disorders of creatine synthesis were identified until 1994 when the first case of GAMT deficiency was reported by Stöckler et al., (Stöckler et al. ). In 2001, the second and X-linked inherited disorder of creatine metabolism, due to a defect of the creatine membrane transporter 1 in the central nervous system, was reported in two pedigrees (Cecil et al. ; Salmons et al. ). Later on, two Italian sisters with a previously unclassified deficiency of brain creatine were found to have AGAT deficiency (Item et al. ).
During the last decade a significant amount of work has demonstrated the utility and effective-ness of creatine supplementation in different neurological disease models but also in the healthy state (Komura et al. ; Amital et al. ; Mercimek-Mahmutoglu et al. ; Gualano et al. ). Recent evidence suggests a role in cerebral physiological processes, such as learning and memory (Bianchi et al. ) as it is reported to enhance intelligence test scores, reduces mental fatigue and protects against a decrease in cerebral oxygenated hemoglobin when subjects repeatedly perform a mathematical calculation (Watanabe et al. ; Rae et al. ; Valenzuela et al. ).
Schmidt et al. (Schmidt et al. ) had generated the knockout mouse model of GAMT deficiency through targeted disruption of the mouse GAMT gene in embryonic stem cells resulting in characteristic biochemical changes including elevated guanodinoacetate and decreased creatine in serum, urine, skeletal and cardiac muscles and brain of GAMT knockout mice. GAMT knockout mice suffered from increased neonatal mortality, muscular hypotonia, decreased male fertility and a non-Lipton mediated lifelong reduction in body weight due to reduced body fat mass (Iqbal ). The AGAT knockout mouse was generated by Choe et al. (Choe et al. ) by targeted disruption of Exon 3 through insertion of a lox P-flanked neomycin selection cassette in the mouse AGAT gene in embryonic stem cells resulting in chronic Cr-dependent activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which stimulates catabolic pathways in metabolically relevant tissues such as brain, skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, and liver.
The present study was designed to investigate the utility of long term (10 weeks) dietary creatine supplementation on the neurological functioning and biochemical phenotype of female AGAT and GAMT knockout mice and their wild littermates.
Results
Assessment of neurological function
Rota rod
Analysis of the results indicated that for AGAT mice, the rota rod performance was significantly improved in both wild type ( p = 0.05) and knockout ( p = 0.02) mice supplemented with 2% creatine than mice on creatine free diets. In GAMT mice, the knockout mice supplemented with 2% creatine held on rotating rod for significantly longer time ( p < 0.001) than knockout mice on creatine free diet. Creatine supplemented GAMT wild type mice also showed better performance than mice on creatine free diet but difference in performance did not reach the statistical significance ( P > 0.05) (Fig. 1 ).

Asterisk indicates the significance of difference in rota rod test performance between mice supplemented with 2% Cr and Cr free diet. (2 sample t test; ** = p < 0.01; *** = p < 0.001)
Open field
AGAT wild type mice supplemented with 2% creatine showed higher values for all the studied open field parameters but the difference in performance did not reach the significance ( p > 0.05). For the AGAT knockout mice, creatine supplemented animals covered more distance ( p = 0.009), with higher velocity ( p = 0.03), more large movements ( p = 0.02) and higher sniffing ( p = 0.001) and rearing frequencies ( p = 0.04) (Supplementary Table 1 ). On the other hand, no significant effect of diet was observed on exploratory and locomotory behaviour for both wild type and GAMT knockout mice (Supplementary Table 2 ).
Morris water maze
AGAT mice
Analysis of MWM training data indicated that duration of training period (day1–4) had a highly significant effect on path length, rest time, average speed and latency to reach the platform ( p < 0.0001 for all parameters) in AGAT mice (data not shown here). Rest time was the most severely affected parameter during training days as diet ( p < 0.0001) and genotype ( p = 0.016) had significant effect on rest time. It was observed that mice on creatine free diet were not good swimmers, as they tend to float in water rather than swimming increasing their rest time and decreasing the overall activity. Mice on 2% creatine took significantly less time to reach the hidden platform than mice on creatine free diet indicating that creatine supplementation has a positive effect on spatial memory
During the MWM probe trial, it was observed that both wild type ( p = 0.003) and knockout mice ( p = 0.005) on creatine supplementation travelled significantly ( p = 0.003) more distance in the target quadrant than the other three quadrants when compared with mice on a creatine free diet (Fig. 2 a).

For time to reach virtual platform ( p = 0.03) and number of times cross virtual platform ( p < 0.001), mice on creatine supplemented diet took less time to reach virtual platform and more frequently than mice on creatine free diet (Fig. 2 )c, d.
GAMT mice
It was observed during the acquisition phase of MWM (day1–4) that duration of training had significant effect on path length ( p < 0.0001), rest time ( p < 0.0001), average mouse speed ( p < 0.0001) and latency to reach platform ( p = 0.03) (data not shown here). Mice supplemented with 2% creatine monohydrate took significantly less time to reach the hidden platform as compared to mice on creatine free diet indicating that creatine supplementation has improved the spatial memory of GAMT mice.
During probe trial of MWM, it was observed that path lengths in the target quadrant were significantly higher for mice on 2% creatine diet than those on a creatine free diet ( p < 0.001) (Fig. 3 a). Animals on 2% creatine diet spent significantly more time ( p = 0.01) in target quadrant than mice on creatine free diet (Fig. 3 b). Analysis of parameters, virtual time to reach platform and number of times crossing platform during probe trial, revealed significant effect of genotype and diet indicating that mice on creatine free diet and knockout mice took longer time (sec) to reach the virtual platform position and crossed this region less frequently than mice on creatine plus diet and wild type mice respectively (Fig. 3 b, d).

Biochemical profiling
AGAT mice
Analysis of the metabolites, associated with creatine metabolism revealed that dietary supplementation did not affect the studied parameters in both plasma and urine in wild type mice supplemented with or without creatine (Table 1 ). In contrast knockout AGAT mice showed a significant increase in plasma creatinine ( p = 0.02) and ornithine ( p = 0.02) concentrations along with increased urine creatine ( p < 0.001) and creatinine ( p = 0.001) excretion supplemented mice (Table 1 ).

GAMT mice
Analysis of the creatine metabolites revealed that dietary supplementation with creatine has a significant effect on metabolite levels in plasma and urine in wild type as well as in GAMT knockout mice. Significantly higher creatine ( p = 0.002), creatinine ( p = 0.006) and homocysteine ( p = 0.04) concentrations in plasma and increased creatinine ( p = 0.01) and methionine ( p = 0.03) levels in urine were observed in wild type mice supplemented with 2% creatine in diet for 10 weeks. Comparison of the studied parameters in knockout GAMT mice indicated a significantly increased GAA concentration ( p = 0.01) in plasma of animals on creatine free diet when compared with knockout mice supplemented with 2% Cr. While 2% Cr supplemented mice had higher plasma creatinine ( p < 0.001) and methionine ( p = 0.05) while lower GAA ( p = 0.01) concentrations than knockout mice supplemented with creatine free diet for 10 weeks. Analysis of urine samples indicated that GAMT knockout mice supplemented with 2% creatine had significantly higher urinary creatine ( p = 0.004) and creatinine ( p = 0.07) excretion than mice on creatine free diet (Table 2 ).

Analysis of the body weight
Body weight showed a significant increase over time ( p < 0.0001) in AGAT mice. The interaction between time and diet was significant ( p = 0.04) indicating that diet composition had an effect on weight gain during experimental duration. Student t-test analysis revealed a highly significant difference in weight gain between Knockout Cr plus and Knockout Cr free treatment in AGAT mice. Significantly different ( p = 0.01) weight gain was observed in these two treatments from the second week of experiment and this trend continued throughout the experimental duration. The difference in weight gain was highly significant ( p = 0.0002) at the end of experiment (Supplementary Fig. 1 ).
For GAMT mice, body weight showed a significant increase over time ( p < 0.0001). The interaction between time and diet was significant ( p = 0.05) indicating that diet has an overall significant effect on weight gain during experimental duration. While the interactions time and genotype ( p = 0.3) was not significant indicating that genotype did not have a significant effect on weight gain during experiment (Supplementary Fig. 1 ).
Discussion
Creatine has emerged as a nutritional supplement that not only increase muscle mass and enhance their performance but also improves muscle rehabilitation as it strengthens cellular energetic in muscles (Wallimann et al. ). Mechanisms underlying neural function enhancement by creatine includes improved energy storage and supply. Creatine seems to modulate central transmission processes as reported that creatine is released in an action-potential dependent manner, suggesting a putative role of this amino acid as a neuromodulator in the brain (AlmediaL et al. ). Considering the important physiological role of creatine in brain metabolism, it has implications for the design of therapies to maintain brain function (Wyss and Kaddurah-Daouk ). Since systematic patient studies on the pathophysiology of creatine deficiency syndrome cannot be conducted due to low incidence, genetically engineered mice provide an experimental system for understanding gene function, modelling the pathophysiology of specific human genetic disorders such as GAMT and AGAT deficiencies, the preclinical testing of therapeutic agents, and for developing new therapeutic interventions such as gene therapy.
Choe et al. (Choe et al. ) has reported reduced body tension and severe scoliosis in AGAT knockout mice indicating chronic muscular hypotonia. While Schmidt et al. (Schmidt et al. ) had also reported that GAMT knockout mice suffered from muscular hypotonia confirming the important role that is played by Cr in the energy metabolism of muscles. Results of rota rod test (for balance and neuromuscular coordination) for both GAMT and AGAT mice indicated that the difference in test performance was due to the presence or absence of creatine in diet as for both models, mice on 2% Cr supplemented diet held longer on rotating rod than those mice feeding on Cr free diet (Fig. 1 ). Genotype (Wild type or Knockout) had also affected the rota rod performance but the difference failed to reach statistical significance (Data not shown here). For both mouse models, the knockouts on Cr free diet supplementation showed the poor performance indicating poor muscular strength due to lack of Cr in muscles while the rota rod performance of knockout mice with 2% Cr supplementation, from both models, was comparable to their wild type littermates indicating that Cr supplementation has neutralised Cr deficiency generated by gene knockout in these animals (Fig. 1 ). Cr supplementation has possibly improved the muscular strength and neuromuscular coordination enabling not only the wild type but knockout mice as well to hold longer on rotating rod as Cr is known to increase the muscular strength and power output in humans as well as in animal models (Wyss and Kaddurah-Daouk ; AlmediaL et al. ; Kreider et al. ). For AGAT knockout mice, our results are in agreement with Nabuurs et al. (Nabuurs et al. ) who had reported that oral Cr administration led to rapid accumulation in skeletal muscle (faster than in brain) and reversed all the muscle abnormalities, revealing that the condition of the AGAT knockout mice can be switched between Cr deficient and normal simply by dietary manipulation.
Open field (OF) was used to measure the parameters of locomotor activity and exploratory behaviour of mice. Open field test had very interesting results in case of AGAT mouse as diet had significantly affected several OF parameters especially in knockout mice. It was observed that AGAT knockout mice on 2% Cr supplemented diet had travelled more distance, with higher velocity and more large movements in OF chamber than mouse on Cr free diet (Supplementary Table 1) indicating an improved locomotor and exploratory behaviour. For GAMT mouse, there was no statistically significant affect of genotype and/or diet on studied parameters in open field test complementing the findings of Torremans et al. (Torremans et al. ) who had indicated that exploratory behaviour of GAMT mice did not reveal differences between genotypes. Similar observations have been reported recently by Iqbal et al. (Iqbal et al. , , ) that long-term creatine monohydrate supplementation did not affect the locomotory and exploratory behaviour in male albino mice indicating that Cr supplementation did not affect this particular behaviour in both normal as well as transgenic mice.
To our knowledge, this is the first time that spatial memory formation is reported in an AGAT mouse model. Torremans et al. (Torremans et al. ) had reported the behavioural phenotype of GAMT mouse and had compared the neurological performance of wild type, heterozygous and knockout mice concluding that GAMT deficient mouse model shows only a mild cognitive deficit. Our study had emphasized the effect of different diets, and genotype on learning.
We conducted the Morris water maze (MWM) test to test the spatial memory of AGAT and GAMT mouse. For both AGAT and GAMT mice, all the studied MWM parameters, except rest time had a decreasing trend while rest time showed an increase from training day 1 to 4. Both wild type and GAMT knockout mice on 2% Cr diet choose smaller paths to reach the platform as compared to mice on Cr free diet but this difference in path length was not statistically significant (Data not shown here). It was observed that wild type and knockout mice on Cr free diet were not active swimmers in pool as they preferred to float in water which resulted not only in increasing rest time but also in decreasing swimming speeds from training day 1 to 4. This was probably due to lack of creatine in muscles that has depleted their ATP depended energy reserve required for active swimming. Latency to reach platform is an important indicator of spatial learning and results indicated that there was a gradual reduction in time taken to reach platform by wild type and knockout GAMT mice on 2% Cr diet indicating a gradually improved learning during the acquisition phase. Poor latency results in knockout mice on Cr free diet are possibly because of the fact that learning disability and mental retardation are the characteristic features of GAMT deficiency (Schulze et al. ; Stöckler et al. ) and these mice being GAMT knockout had no indigenous Cr synthesis as well as no Cr in diet leading them ultimately to almost depleted cerebral Cr pool which is the classical condition found in human GAMT deficient patients resulting in poor memory formation in these animals. Similar trend was observed for both mouse models during probe trail as wild type and knockout mice spent more time with higher path length in the target quadrant as compared to three other quadrants and visited the virtual platform area more frequently than their littermates on Cr free diet (Figs. 2 and 3 ). An interesting observation during the present study was that wild type mice supplemented with Cr free diet performed poorly during spatial learning test as compared to littermate mice on 2% Cr supplemented diet although they had an intact endogenous creatine synthetic mechanism leading us to the conclusion that presence of creatine in diet has an important role in learning and memory formation in addition to its endogenous synthesis.
Analysis of body weight during the experimental duration revealed interesting results. Knockout AGAT mice on a Cr free diet had significantly reduced body weights as compared to the other three experimental treatments from week 4 onwards (Supplementary Fig. 1 ) confirming the findings of Choe et al. (Choe et al. ) who had observed that from four weeks of age onward, knockout AGAT mice showed consistently lower body weight. While there was no difference in weight between wild type and heterozygous animals, they observed reduced fat content in knockout mice upon body composition analysis. An interesting observation was the gain in weight for AGAT knockout mice on 2% Cr supplemented diet that was comparable to wild type animals indicating that Cr was involved in the weight gain. These results are in line with Nabuurs et al. (Nabuurs et al. ) who had reported that Cr supplementation for 3 months increased the body weight of AGAT knockout mice up to 56%, while age-matched wild type mice showed an increase of only 19.3 ± 4.7% over that period, which is not significantly different from wild type animals on a normal diet (15.3 ± 2.2%).. Schmidt et al. (Schmidt et al. ) had reported decreased male fertility and a non-Lipton mediated lifelong reduction in body weight due to reduced body fat mass in GAMT knockout mice. This shows that, in contrast, Cr supplementation in GAMT knockout mice will lead to weight gain confirming our observations (Supplementary Fig. 1 ).
The reaction mediated by AGAT is considered to be a rate-limiting step in creatine biosynthesis (Choe et al. ). Expression of AGAT is repressed by creatine (Humm et al. ), induced by thyroxin and growth hormone and inhibited by ornithine (Sipilä et al. ). AGAT deficiency is characterised by a total lack of Cr/PCr peak in the paraventricular white matter, in the parieto-occipital cortex and in the cerebellum (Battini et al. ) with decreased GAA concentration in serum and extremely low excretion of GAA in urine (Item ). In humans, the biosynthesis of creatine is reported to represent about 75% of the total utilization of methionine though S-adenosyl L-methionine (SAM) and thus GAMT is believed to be the major enzyme involved in the metabolic conversion of SAM to SAH (MuddSH and Scriver ). Patients with GAMT deficiency have systemic depletion of creatine and creatine phosphate due to impairment of de novo creatine biosynthesis and the daily rate of urinary creatinine excretion is low. Also the creatinine concentrations in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid are reported to be low (Iqbal ; Stöckler et al. , ; Dhar et al. ). Analysis of the biochemical data revealed that wild type mice supplemented with Cr free diet had reduced concentrations of Cr and creatinine in plasma and urine of both mouse models than their wild type littermates on 2% Cr supplemented diet but the difference in concentrations did not reach the statistical significance (Tables 1 and 2 ) probably due to the fact that indigenous Cr biosynthetic pathway was intact for these mice and Cr deficiency in diet has affected the overall concentrations of these metabolites in plasma and urine. Our results indicated that 2% Cr supplementation had significantly affected the biochemical profile in both AGAT and GAMT knockout mice (Tables 1 and 2 ). AGAT knockout mice had a significantly higher concentration of creatinine in both plasma ( p = 0.02) and urine ( p < 0.001), creatine in urine ( p = 0.001) and Ornithene in plasma ( p = 0.002) than AGAT knockout mice on Cr free diet (Table 1 ). Our results are comparable with Bianchi et al. (Bianchi et al. ) who had reported that Cr supplementation at a rate of 400 mg/Kg/day in human patients resulted in 40 and 80% increased Cr and PCr concentrations in the brain as compared to controls within 3 to 9 months of treatment. It was reported that after 16 months of Cr treatment, a nearly complete replenishment of the Cr/PCr was observed in patients (Bianchi et al. ).
Diet supplementation had more pronounced effects in GAMT mice. For GAMT wild type mice, 2% Cr supplemented diet resulted in an increased Cr, creatinine and methionine both in plasma and urine, increased homocysteine in plasma and a significantly decreased GAA in plasma and urine as compared to wild type mice on Cr free diet was observed (Table 2 ). GAMT knockout mice supplemented with Cr in diet also had significantly higher creatinine and methionine levels in plasma and with more urinary creatine and creatinine excretion than knockout mice on Cr free diet (Table 2 ). GAA concentrations were significantly higher in knockout animals on Cr free diet in plasma and urine confirming the findings of von Figura et al. (Figura ). These higher plasma Cr and creatinine levels are responsible for the improved neuromuscular coordination and neurological test performances as it has been reported that Cr supplementation in diet ultimately improves the Cr/PCr pool in human and mouse brain (Kreider et al. ). Mechanisms underlying neural function enhancement by creatine include improved energy storage and supply (Iqbal et al. ). Cr seems to play a direct modulatory role in the central transmission processes as in studies conducted by Almeida et al. (Almeida et al. ) which show that creatine is released in an action-potential dependent manner, suggesting a putative role of this amino acid as a neuromodulator in the brain.
In conclusion, we have observed that 2% Cr supplementation has not only improved the biochemical and neurological output in AGAT and GAMT knockout mice but lack of Cr in diet can also effect the behavior of wild type animals indicating that both indigenous Cr synthesis and exogenous supply through diet are necessary for normal brain function. We are also reporting that Cr deficiency is reversible in both knockout mouse models as following the 2% Cr supplementation for 10 weeks, where the neurological test performance was comparable to that of wild type animals. This study will pave the way for further exploring the role of Cr supplementation for the treatment of creatine deficiency syndrome.
Materials and methods
Animals
Heterozygous breeding pairs of AGAT and GAMT mice were provided by the Center of Molecular Neurobiology, University of Hamburg, Germany and maintained in cages made of Makrolon and filled with wood chips in the core unit of Biomedical Research, Division of Laboratory Animal Science and Genetics, Medical University of Vienna, Austria. Only female mice were used in these experiments. Experiments were performed under the license from the federal ministry of education, science and culture that includes an ethical evaluation of the project (BMWF-66.009/45-II/106/2008). Housing and maintenance of animals were in compliance with European and national regulations.
Experimental design
Toes of female pups were clipped on the 4th day of life for marking as well as for genotyping. DNA from the toe clips was extracted by putting the tissue in 70-90 μl of lysis buffer while shaking at 54 °C overnight. Lysate was briefly centrifuged and used directly for PCR. GAMT mice were genotyped following Schmidt et al. (Schmidt et al. ) while AGAT mice were genotyped following Choe et al. (Choe et al. ).
At postnatal day 18–20, mice (both models) were separated from dams and housed in individual cages due to the previously reported risk of coprophagy (Schmidt et al. ). Special mouse diets (containing either 2% Creatine monohydrate or Creatine free) were purchased from Sniff Spezialdäten GmbH (Germany) and each group was maintained on specific diet for 10 weeks. Based on genotype and diet supplementation, mice were divided into four groups ( n = 10 for each): 1) Wild type mice fed with 2% creatine; 2) Wild type mice fed with creatine free diet; 3) Knockout mice fed with 2% creatine; 4) Knockout mice fed with creatine free diet.
Neurofunctional assessment
A battery of tests was applied to assess neuro-cognition and performance in GAMT and AGAT mice. Rota rod and open field tests were done during the 10th week of the study on separate days, 24 h after the completion of the last test. The Morris water maze was done after the completion of 10 weeks of dietary supplementation.
Rota rod
The rota rod tests balance and coordination and utilizes a rotating drum that is accelerated from 4 to 40 rpm (Columbus Instruments, Ohio, USA). The time duration on the drum was recorded. Each animal received three pre-trial trainings and completed three consecutive trials. The average time on the drum was used for analysis (Iqbal et al. , , ).
Open field
Mice were observed using a video monitoring system consisting of a video camcorder (1/3″ SSAMHR EX VIEW HAD) connected to a computational tracking system TiBeSplit in an open chamber (40 cm × 40 cm with 70 cm high walls) for 10 min. The mice were placed in the middle of the chamber for each trial and standard parameters for locomotor activity (i.e. total distance covered, average speed, amount of large movement, amount of local movement, resting time, frequency of spontaneous change in direction) and exploratory behavior (i.e. rearing, crossing the center, time spent in the margin) were recorded (Iqbal et al. ).

The Morris Water Maze (MWM) consisted of a circular pool (122 cm diameter, walls 76 cm depth) in which mice were trained to escape from water by swimming to a hidden platform (1.5 cm beneath water surface) whose location could be only be identified using distal extra-maze cues attached to the room walls.
The pool was divided into four quadrants (compass locations: NE, NW, SW and SE) by a computerized tracking/image analyzer system (video camcorder: 1/3″ SSAMHR EX VIEW HAD connected to a computational tracking system, TiBeSplit). The platform was placed in the middle of the SW quadrant and remained at the same position during the entire experiment.
The spatial acquisition phase consisted of 16 training trials: 4 training trials per day and 4 training days with an inter-trial interval of 15 min. Mice were released randomly with their heads facing the pool wall from the four compass locations, and allowed to swim and search for the platform for 120 s. If mice did not locate the platform after 120 s, animals were manually placed on the platform and allowed to remain on it for 30 s. On the first training day, mice were given an acclimatization training session in the water maze; mice were placed on the hidden platform, were allowed to swim for 30 s, and were guided subsequently back to the platform. The latency and path length to reach the hidden platform, rest time during the trial and average speed was recorded.
On day 5, after the acquisition phase, subjects received a probe trial, in which the platform was removed. Mice were released from the NE start point and were allowed to swim freely for 60 s. The path each mouse swam was tracked and analyzed for the proportion of swim time and/or path length spent in each quadrant of the pool. Virtual time to reach the platform, number of times crossing the platform and swim speed was also recorded (Iqbal et al. ).
Biochemical analysis
After the completion of the long-term neurological test battery, mice were kept in specially designed metabolic cages for the collection of 24 h urine for the determination of creatine metabolites. Finally, blood was sampled either from the retro-orbital sinus or from direct cardiac puncture under inhaled isoflurane anaesthesia. Plasma was separated by high-speed centrifugation and stored at -20C until further analysis.
Aminoacids determination in plasma and urine
Concentrations of arginine, glycine, methionine, ornithine and homocysteine were measured in plasma and urine samples. Samples were prepared by using an EZ: fast free amino acid analysis kit (Phenomenex, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions for the determination of amino acids except homocysteine. Homocysteine was separately determined only in plasma samples. Liquid chromatography (Waters Acquity UPLC; Waters, Milford, MA) with a 2.00 × 250 mm EZ:fastAAA-MS 4 μm HPLC column supplied with the kit was used for elution of amino acid derivatives. Mobile phase A: 10 mmol/L ammonium formate in water, B: 10 mmol/L ammonium formate in methanol. Gradient: 0 min: 30%A-70%B, 14 min: 17%A-83%B, 15 Min: 17%A-83%B, 16 min: 30%A-70%B, 20 min: 30%A-70%B. Flow rate was set at 0.25 ml/min. Total run time was 14 min. 10 μl of prepared sample were injected onto the column. Detection was made by tandem mass spectrometry (PESciex API3000 with Analyst 1.5 software; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) in positive electro spray mode. The mass spectrometer was optimized to give maximum sensitivity for multiple reaction monitoring of the transitions 204.5 > 144.2 for glycine, 278.5 > 190.2 for methionine, 303.5 > 70.1 for arginine, 347.5 > 287.3 for ornithine and 350.5 > 204.3 for homocysteine. The total acquisition time was 14 min.
Creatine metabolites determination in plasma and urine
Metabolites of creatine biosynthetic pathway [guanidinoaceticacid (GAA), creatine and Creatinine (CTN)] were determined in urine and plasma samples (Bodamer et al. ). Analysis was done by tandem mass spectrometry (PESciex API3000 with Analyst 1.5 software; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) in positive electro spray mode. The mass spectrometer was optimized to give maximum sensitivity for multiple reaction monitoring of the transitions 114.2 > 44.1 for CTN and 117.2 > 47.1 for d3-CTN. The following parameters were used during metabolite determination: CE = 19 V, DP = 50 V, FP = 300 V, EP = 12 V, CXP = 6 V, IS = 4500 V, TEM = 300C. The total acquisition time was 2 min.
Body weight analysis
The body weight of the experimental treatments was recorded throughout the experiment on a weekly basis in order to determine the effect of genotype and diet supplementation on the mean body mass of the subjects.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was carried out using SAS 9.1. In all cases, values are presented as mean ± standard error of mean (SEM) for all the parameters. Significance level was set at p < 0.05 in all instances.
For the biochemical analysis (GAA, Cr, CTN and amino acids in plasma and urine) and for rota rod and open field 2 sample t-test was applied to compare the studied parameters between mice exposed to various dietary supplementations. For the change in body mass and MWM probe trial data, first multi-variate MANOVA was calculated and in case of significant results, univariate ANOVAs were calculated for each parameter (dependant variable). Genotype and diet were fixed factors. For the analysis of parameters measured during MWM training days, a mixed model was calculated for each parameter with the parameter as dependent variable, genotype, diet and day (training day 1–4) as fixed factors and measurement and mouse as random effects. Genotype and diet were taken as class variable, while training day were taken as numeric variable. For analysis of body weight, we calculated repeated measures ANOVA, with the body weights from the beginning of the experiment until week 10 of the experiment as dependent variable, genotype (wt/ko), treatment (No HI/HI), diet (2% Cr/Cr free) as fixed factors.
