Introduction
Atherosclerosis is the most common cause of ischemic stroke (IS) by embolism or arterial thrombosis and inflammation plays a fundamental role in the process of it (Montero-Vega ; Tuttolomondo et al. ). C-reactive protein (CRP), as a classical acute-phase protein, represents a clinical marker of inflammation (Deodhar ). A great number of studies have indicated that elevated CRP levels are associated with poor clinical outcome in patients with IS (Di Napoli et al. ; Pandey et al. ; Rajeshwar et al. ; Ryu et al. ; Song et al. ; Ye et al. ; Yeh et al. ). However, CRP levels may fluctuate over time during the acute stage after a stroke (Bogaty et al. ). On the other hand, numerous studies have indicated that the concentration of circulating CRP is influenced by many factors, such as obesity, smoking, ethnicity, physiology and socioeconomic adversity (Huang et al. ; Kivimaki et al. ; Kushner et al. ). These conditions limited CRP as a powerful biomarker to predict outcomes for IS patients. Common genetic variants have been identified robustly which affect the levels of plasma CRP (Kivimaki et al. ). Genome-wide association study (GWAS) demonstrated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CRP gene strongly affect CRP levels (Dehghan et al. ; Dorajoo et al. ; Okada et al. ; Reiner et al. ; Vinayagamoorthy et al. ; Wu et al. ).
IS is a heterogeneous disease with many different etiologies (Adams et al. ). The underlying pathogenesis and the role of genetic factors would vary among different IS subtypes. Plasma concentrations of CRP may be associated with different etiological IS subtypes (Ladenvall et al. ). A previous study indicated SNP rs1130864 in the CRP gene predicted post-stroke functional outcome (Guo et al. ). However, this study did not consider the potential different etiological subtypes of IS. Little is known about the association of variants of the CRP gene with the outcome of atherosclerosis IS.
We hypothesized that SNPs of the CRP gene may influence the functional outcome of patients with large artery atherosclerotic (LAA) IS. Therefore, we performed this prospective cohort study to investigate the association between five GWAS-supported CRP level-related SNPs of CRP gene and clinical outcome of LAA IS, at 3 months after the stroke event.
Subjects and Methods
Study Population
Consecutive patients with IS were prospectively registered in Nanjing Stroke Registry Program (NSRP), which has been described in detail previously (Liu et al. ). Patients with first-ever IS who were consecutively recruited between August 2013 and October 2015 were assessed for eligibility of participation in the present study. IS was diagnosed as a sudden focal neurologic deficit lasting longer than 24 h and is confirmed based on computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging. Inclusion criteria for this study: (1) aged 18 years or older, (2) Chinese Han ethnicity, (3) first-ever IS was diagnosed and blood was drawn within 4 weeks of symptom onset, (4) LAA stroke was determined according to the TOAST (Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment) criteria (Adams et al. ). We excluded patients from the present study if patients with (1) concurrent cancerous disease, liver or kidney failure, (2) recent clinical infection, (3) surgery or major trauma in the previous month, (4) pre-stroke modified Rankin scale (mRS) score more than 2.
This study was performed according to the Helsinki Declaration and was approved by the Ethics Committee of Jinling hospital. All enrolled participants were unrelated Chinese Han and provided written informed consent.
Follow-Up and Outcome
Enrolled patients were prospectively followed up for 3 months after the index stroke via clinical visit or telephone interview. The functional outcome was assessed utilizing mRS by two certificated investigators, who were blinded to the baseline data. Neurologic functional disability is categorized into two levels: 0–2 (favorable outcome) and 3–6 (poor outcome).
Screening Target SNPs
Two investigators (Z Ye and H Zhang) searched PubMed database for all GWASs on CRP-related SNPs in CRP gene published before September 30, 2015. A total of 16 GWASs about CRP gene were found ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1401 ). Among the 16 CRP gene-related GWASs, only four GWASs about CRP genetic variants and CRP levels which were performed in Asian population were found (Dorajoo et al. ; Okada et al. ; Vinayagamoorthy et al. ; Wu et al. ). Based on the p value < 5 × 10 −8 and a minor allele frequency (MAF) > 0.05 for Chinese Han population indexed in Hapmap Data Phase III ( http://www.hapmap.org ), five SNPs (rs876537, rs2794520, rs3093059, rs7553007 and rs11265260) in CRP gene were selected for genotyping.
DNA Isolation and Genotyping
The five SNPs were genotyped by SNPscan technology (GeneSky). The whole genotyping process was supported by the Center for Human Genetics Research, Shanghai Genesky Biotechnology Company. Genotypic assay failed to operate for 0.4% samples. For quality control, reproducibility of genotyping was performed in 5% randomly selected samples and a 100% concordance was confirmed.
Statistical Analysis
Categorical variables were summarized as counts and percentages, and compared using Chi-square test. Continuous variables with normal distributions were presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and analyzed with independent t test. Continuous variables with skewed distributions were expressed as interquartile range (IQR) and median and compared using Wilcoxon test. In order to fit a less skewed distribution, levels of CRP were log transformed. The difference between the CRP levels according to genotypes of CRP SNPs was analyzed by binary logistic regression models. The genotypic distributions of each SNP were evaluated by Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) using exact Chi-square goodness-of-fit test. Binary logistic regression models were constructed to assess the association between SNPs and the risk of poor outcome after LAA IS. Each SNP was analyzed in three models: additive model, dominant model and recessive model. Bonferroni correction was performed in order to control the false positive error rate. The above statistical analyses were performed by IBM SPSS Statistics version 20.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). Two-sided values of p < 0.05 were deemed to be statistically significant. Power analyses were performed utilizing the Power and Sample Size program (PS version 3.0.43). Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis was analyzed by Haploview 4.0 software (Cambridge, MA 02141, USA) (Barrett et al. ). Haplotypes were reconstructed with the SNPstats software ( http://bioinfo.iconcologia.net/SNPstats ) (Solé et al. ). In haplotype analysis, haplotypes with frequencies < 0.01 were ignored.
Results
Baseline Characteristics
From August 2013 to October 2015, a total of 721 first-ever LAA IS patients met the inclusion criteria. Genotyping was unsuccessfully performed in three participants. After 3-month follow-up, 28 participants were lost. At last, the remaining 690 participants (494 with good outcome and 196 with poor outcome) with valid data were analyzed. The clinical characteristics of the study subjects are summarized in Table 1 . Among the 690 patients, the mean age was 61.10 ± 10.83 years, and 507 (73.48%) were male. The median plasma levels of CRP on admission were 2.90 mg/L (IQR 1.00, 5.33). Compared with the good outcome group, patients in poor outcome had a higher prevalence of female and diabetes mellitus. National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, age and CRP levels on admission were also significantly different between the good outcome group and the poor outcome group ( p < 0.05).

CRP Gene Polymorphisms and CRP Levels
The information of five selected SNPs of CRP gene is presented in Table 2 . The genotypic distributions of the five selected SNPs were all consistent with HWE ( p > 0.05). The genotype frequencies in CRP polymorphisms and the comparisons of CRP levels with various genotypes are summarized in Table 3 . CRP levels were measured within 5 ± 2 days after symptom onset. As elevated CRP (≥ 3.0 mg/L) was significantly associated with the risk of cerebral vascular disease (Biasucci et al. ; Shen et al. ), here CPR was categorized into elevated CRP (≥ 3 mg/L) and normal CRP (< 3 mg/L). The results showed SNPs rs11265260 (multivariate-adjusted, p = 0.022), rs2794520 (multivariate-adjusted, p = 0.036) and rs3093059 (multivariate-adjusted, p = 0.027) were significantly associated with elevated CRP (Table 3 ).

CRP Gene Polymorphisms and Outcome of LAA IS
Table 4 presents the effect of CRP gene polymorphisms on the outcome of LAA IS. Among the five selected SNPs of CRP gene, only two SNPs (rs3093059 and rs11265260) were found to be significantly associated with the outcome of LAA IS. For rs3093059, in multivariable logistic regression model, CT genotype (CT vs CC, OR 2.31; 95% CI 1.42–3.77; p = 0.001) and TT genotype (TT vs CC, OR 5.09; 95% CI 1.64–15.76; p = 0.005) increased the poor outcome risk compared with CC genotype. The adjusted ORs (95% CI) in dominant model and recessive model for rs3093059 in multivariable logistic regression model were 2.49 (1.55–4.00) and 3.67 (1.22–11.03), respectively. Similarly, after adjusted for potential covariates, polymorphisms of rs11265260 were significantly associated with poor outcome of LAA IS in additive model, dominant model and recessive model ( p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p = 0.004, respectively). The power of sample size for rs3093059 and rs11265260 was 0.802 ( α = 0.05, p 0 = 0.834, m = 2.520, OR 0.658) and 0.851 ( α = 0.05, p 0 = 0.836, m = 2.520, OR 0.639), respectively. The above significant results were still existed after Bonferroni correction ( p < 0.05/5).

LD Analysis and Haplotype Analysis
Only one block was detected in the five selected SNPs in LD analysis (Fig. 1 ). High allelic associations were found between rs876537 and rs2794520 ( r 2 = 0.95), rs876537 and rs7553007 ( r 2 = 0.95), rs2794520 and rs7553007 ( r 2 = 0.95), rs3093059 and rs11265260 ( r 2 = 0.98). To reduce potential false positive, haplotypes with frequencies < 0.01 were omitted in the haplotype analysis. After adjusted for potential variables, patients with GCTGC haplotype (OR 1.76; 95% CI 1.05–2.95; p = 0.031) had higher frequency of poor outcome when compared to those with ATCAT haplotype (Table 5 ).

Discussion
In this prospective, hospital-based study, we comprehensively evaluated the association of five GWAS-supported CRP level-related SNPs of CRP and 3-month outcome of first-onset LAA IS in Chinese Han population. The main finding is that CRP rs3093059 and rs11265260 polymorphisms are significantly associated with poor functional disability at 3 months of first-onset LAA IS. Also, haplotype of GCTGC is an independent predictor for unfavorable outcome in this ethnic group. Moreover, genotypes of rs2794520, rs3093059 and rs11265260 are related to triggered CPR concentrations in acute first-onset LAA IS.
Series of studies indicated that elevated serum CRP concentration predicts a poor outcome in acute stroke (Gong et al. ; Kaptoge et al. ; Winbeck et al. ). In the present study, we also found patients with unfavorable outcome had much higher CRP levels than those with favorable outcome. The causality between increased CRP levels and unfavorable functional outcome remains controversial. A growing body of evidence indicated that elevated levels of CRP after stroke onset may relate to the pathophysiology of IS and the extension of cerebral ischemia (Arenillas et al. ; Dirnagl et al. ; Winbeck et al. ). Dirk Sander et al. reported that CRP measurement within 48 h after symptom onset was related to diffusion-weighted images necrosis volumes (Winbeck et al. ). The severity of neurologic functions for IS is usually associated with the extent of the lesion. Also, post-ischemic inflammatory mechanisms may further lead to secondary neuronal injury (Arenillas et al. ; DeGraba ).
CRP, as a sensitive marker of inflammation process, could increase significantly in a few days after symptom onset in IS (Winbeck et al. ). CRP concentration was different between individuals because of many factors, such as coronary heart disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cancer, infectious diseases, BMI, smoking. Also, a great deal of studies indicated that SNPs in CRP gene were genetically related to plasma CRP levels. In the present study, we adopted homogeneous LAA IS patients by strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, adjusted for potential factors to evaluate the association between five GWAS-supported CRP-related SNPs and 3-month outcome in LAA IS patients.
A small number of previous studies were performed to investigate the relationship between CRP gene polymorphisms and neurologic deficit in IS. However, these researches yielded inconsistent results. A study from Poland indicated there was no significant association between NIHSS score on the last day of hospitalization and variants of 717A/G CRP gene polymorphism (Kotlega et al. ). Guo J et al. indicated that SNP rs1130864 in CRP gene is an independent predictor of 90-day functional disability in Han Chinese patients with first-onset IS (Guo et al. ). However, no differentiation was made between stroke subtypes in previous investigations, and heterogeneity within the combined stroke phenotype could have limited the power to detect association. In this prospective study, we adopted homogeneous first-onset IS patients with etiological subtype of LAA according to the TOAST criteria and found that SNPs rs3093059 and rs11265260 of CRP gene were significantly associated with 3-month functional disability in LAA IS patients. Rs3093059 is located in the promoter region of the CRP gene. The mutation of rs3093059 may create a potential transcription factor binding site for LHX2 and regulate the expression of CRP (Xue et al. ). An earlier study demonstrated that rs3093059 was associated with triggered CRP levels in acute stroke (Kong et al. ), which is consistent with our study. So far, no study has reported the association of CRP gene rs11265260 polymorphism with CRP levels in IS. In the present study, LAA IS patients with genotype of GG had much higher CRP levels than those with genotype of AA or AG. We speculate that SNPs rs3093059 and rs11265260 may influence the concentration of CRP, which affects the functional outcome in patients with LAA IS. However, the precise mechanism by which these two polymorphisms may affect the functional outcome in patients with LAA IS remains unclear and further studies are needed to confirm the possible mechanism.
Several potential limitations should be considered when interpreting the results. First, sample size in the present study was relatively small. However, the power of sample size for rs3093059 and rs11265260 in the present study was 0.802 and 0.851, respectively. Further studies with larger sample are still needed. Second, all patients in the present study were Han Chinese and we only selected GWASs which were performed in Asian population. As genetic influence is strongly relevant to ethnic background, the results in our study may not compliant with other races and ethnic groups.
In conclusion, CRP variants rs3093059 and rs11265260 and haplotype of GCTGC are significantly associated with 3-month outcome after first-onset LAA IS in Han Chinese patients. Our study also provided further evidence that CRP variants rs2794520, rs3093059 and rs11265260 are related to triggered CRP levels in acute LAA IS. Further replication in other races and ethnic groups with large sample for association study or biological functional study should be needed.
