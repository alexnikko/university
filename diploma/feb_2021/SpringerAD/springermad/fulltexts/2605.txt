Introduction
Amphistomiasis is a widespread disease of ruminants in many parts of the world including Turkey (Ozdal et al. ), Zambia (Phiri et al. ), France (Mage et al. ), India (Hanna et al. ), and recently in West-European temperate regions as a neglected parasitic disease that is causing tremendous economic losses (Millar et al. ; Mason et al. ). The total life cycle of these parasites is thought to take at least 3–4 months to complete and is similar to the other main trematode parasite in cattle, the liver fluke Fasciola hepatica . Following the ingestion of metacercaria by the final host, the juvenile parasites attach to the small intestine mucosa and grow before they migrate to the rumen. Live adults attached to the surface of the rumen and reticulum have a light to bright red color when fresh, are pear-shaped, and are about 1.0 cm in length (Taylor et al. ; De Waal ).
The immature worms in the small intestine cause dilatation of the intestinal glands, destruction of superficial glands, replacement of fibrin, diffuse infiltration of inflammatory cells, fibrinonecrotic enteritis, and hemorrhage and are responsible for anorexia, polydipsia, severe diarrhea, and mortality (Rolfe et al. ; Tehrani et al. ). As a matter of fact, adult flukes are well tolerated by infected animals and immature flukes are the causative agent of morbidity and mortality in some areas of India, the Republic of South Africa, and Australia, where mortality of sheep and cattle has reached 80 to 90% (Boray ; Soulsby ). However, Fuertes et al. ( ) demonstrated the adult parasites are attached to the papillae of rumen and reticulum and affected papillae show morphological changes denoted by very narrow stalks and expanded heads. These changes are characterized by epithelial acanthosis-hyperkeratosis of the epithelium. Tissue damage and inflammatory reaction are more severe in the ruminal atrium, where the largest number of flukes and affected papillae are observed. Although the treatment for adult fluke has no direct benefit to the animal, it may reduce the source of infection for the snail intermediate host. Treatment with an appropriate drench should be timed for autumn and spring. Effective treatment of immature stomach fluke infection requires removal of stock from the source of infection, usually swampy land, as well as treatment with a drench which is effective against immature fluke. Drugs shown to be effective are resorantel, oxyclozanide, clorsulon, niclosamide, and bithionol (Bowman and Georgi ).
Moreover, despite one report on the importance of this infection in some parts of Iran (Eslami et al. ) and rich amphistomes fauna in the country (Rafyi et al. ; Sey and Eslami ), the infection remains a neglected disease and no report exists on its pathogenicity and treatment. In fact, since clinical signs of bovine amphistomiasis are usually mild and fecal examination remains the only way to demonstrate the presence of adult worms, it may lead to misjudgment of the disease by veterinarians and absence of veterinary attention. Meanwhile, the size of the paramphistome burden is an important factor in determining the degree of rumen damage and potential economic losses. This study carried out to determine the epidemiology of cattle amphistomiasis in Gilan province, in northern Iran, along with the Caspian Sea.
Materials and methods
Study area
This study was conducted in Gilan province, one of the 31 provinces of Iran covering 14,700 km 2 . This region lies between longitudes, 48° 52 ′ 19″ to 50° 34 ′ 12 ″ and latitudes 36° 58 ′ 25 ″ to 38° 25 ′ 45 ″ along the Caspian Sea. As shown in Fig. 1 , Gilan province (with Rasht city as the center) is bordered by the province of Mazandaran to the east, province of Ardabil to the west, provinces of Zanjan and Qazvin to the south, and the Republic of Azerbaijan to the north, as well as Russia across the Caspian Sea. In addition, Gilan has a humid subtropical climate with the highest amount of annual rainfall in Iran (1400–1900 mm per year) reaching the peak between September and December.

Sample collection
During spring, summer, autumn, and winter 2016, the rumen and reticulum of 406 cattle including 142 purebred or hybrid and 264 native cattle slaughtered at Rasht abattoir, the main abattoir of Gilan province, were examined by visual examination for the presence of amphistomes. The age, sex, and breed of examined cattle were recorded. Then, all of the amphistomes harvested from infected organs were collected, counted separately, and preserved in a 10% formaldehyde solution. In addition, in order to identify species, as we described previously, median sagittal sections were prepared from specimens by a conventional method (Coskun et al. ). Finally, species were identified by histomorphological peculiarities of muscular organs.
Statistical analysis
To show the normality of the intensity based on every variable, first Kolmogorov-Simonov test was used, whereas one-way ANOVA and post hoc Scheffe test were employed to evaluate the difference between intensity, seasonality, and age. Independent samples t test and chi-square test were used to evaluate the relation between sex, breed, and every variable with the prevalence of amphistomiasis.
Results
Out of 406 cattle, 80 (19.70%) harbored amphistomes in their rumen only. The overall mean of intensity in infected cattle was 764.70 (ranged from 10 to 6200). The relation between prevalence, intensity, season, age, sex, and the breed is shown in Tables 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 . Based on analyzed data, the prevalence of infection in spring was significantly higher than in other seasons ( P < 0.05); however, no such a relation was shown between prevalence, sex, age, and breed ( P > 0.05). On the other hand, the relation between intensity, season, and sex was not significant ( P = 0.108), while the mean ± SE intensity was significantly higher in cattle less than 2 years of age ( P < 0.01) and in pure breed cattle ( P = 0.050).

Discussion
The topographic position of the Caspian lowlands results in a very characteristic “Hyrcanian” climate, and the whole province of Gilan belongs to this exceptionally humid and green area: Prevailing north-south atmospheric currents, humidified over the Caspian, are forced to a vigorous ascendancy by the mighty barrier of Alborz and thus pour all around the year, abundant rainfall on both the plain and the northwestern slope of the mountains. The precipitation regime shows a sharp maximum in autumn (September to December) when atmospheric instability is at its highest point, medium values in winter and early spring, and lowest (but generally abundant enough to remain over the limit of the “dry months”) values from May to August. The forested coastal plains rise up quickly into the Alborz Mountains. This province has a humid subtropical climate with the heaviest rainfall in Iran: reaching as high as 1900 mm (75 in.) in the southwestern coast and generally around 1400 mm (55 in.). Humidity is very high because of the marshy character of the coastal plains and can reach 90% in summer. The Alborz range provides further diversity to the land in addition to the Caspian coasts and large parts of the province are mountainous, green, and forested. Accordingly, these parameters as well as the mean seasonal temperatures and rainfall in spring (18.3 °C and 53.7 mm), summer (23.7 °C, and 95.3 mm), autumn (13.3 °C and 185.7 mm), and winter (7.8 °C and 118.3 mm) provide a suitable environment for the development of appropriate intermediate hosts in most months of the year. Based on our study, all of the amphistomes which were identified in the rumen of cattle of Gilan province, Carmyerius spatiosus , Calicophoron calicophorum , Paramphistomum gotoi , and Gastrothylax compressus were among the ten species reported previously from domestic ruminants of Iran (Coskun et al. ; Eslami et al. ; Khedri et al. ; Sey and Eslami ). Indeed, the variation in the number of species reported in two latter studies is mainly due to the pooled specimens, a plurality of geographical regions and host species examined by Sey and Eslami ( ). The high number of amphistomes species reported suggests a rich fauna in the ruminants of Iran in comparison with our west and east neighbors, Turkey ( Paramphistomum cervi , Paramphistomum ichikawai , Calicophoron daubneyi ), Pakistan ( Paramphistomum daubneyi , P. cervi ), as well as France ( Paramphistomum microbothrium and G. crumenifer ) (Javed Khan et al. ; Mage et al. ; Ozdal et al., ). Since amphistomiasis is a weather-dependent parasitic infection, different prevalence rates of infection have been reported. For instance, the result of the present study from the cattle of Gilan (19.70%) is in line with buffalo paramphistomiasis in Pakistan (22.29%) and in Spain (18.8%) (González-Warleta et al. ; Javed Khan et al. ); however, it is much higher than with the cattle of Turkey (8.95%) (Ozdal et al., ) and less than with the cattle of Mazanderan (33.6%), the neighboring province of Gilan (Eslami et al. ) and cattle from Zabol, in south-eastern Iran (36.9%) (Khedri et al. ), Zambia (51.7%) (Phiri et al. ), and central France (44.7%) (Mage et al. ). Furthermore, subsequently, rainy seasons, but not months of the year, have had a critical role in the epidemiology of infection. As a case in point, in Gilan (present study), having the highest precipitation (30.48 mm), spring was the most infected season ( P = 0.05) which was in concurrence with Pakistan, Nigeria, Mexico, Turkey, and Zambia (Biu and Oluwafunmilayo ; Javed Khan et al. ; Ozdal et al., ; Phiri et al., ; Rangel-Ruiz et al. ). Meanwhile, the size of the paramphistome burden is an important factor in determining the degree of rumen damage and potential economic losses. Besides, data on the intensity of infection is scarce, and different figures are indicative of the suitability of environmental conditions for the development of snail intermediate hosts. Subsequently, the mean intensity of infection in the cattle of Gilan (764.70) was much higher than that of the Sistani breed from Zabol, south-eastern Iran (123.32 ± 32.2), cattle of Turkey (95.55), Zambia (11.96 ± 1.07), Nigeria (203), but very close to Mazandaran province of Iran (864.4 ± 127.2) and Brahman breed of Zabol (652.66 ± 281.5) (Biu and Oluwafunmilayo ; Khedri et al. ; Ozdal et al. ; Phiri et al. ; Eslami et al. ). Since successful small infections produce an almost complete immunity, amphistomiasis is largely a disease of young animals. To the authors’ knowledge, despite several reports on the relation between prevalence and age (Biu and Oluwafunmilayo ; Pfukenyi et al. ; Eslami et al. ), there are no such reports available on the relation between age and intensity of infection. Accordingly, higher mean ± SE of intensity was observed in the cattle of Gilan, less than 2 years old ( P < 0.01). In addition, the non-significant relation between prevalence, sex, breed, and intensity of infection in studied areas ( P > 0.05) is in agreement with the results obtained from Zambian cattle, buffaloes of Pakistan, and sheep of Nigeria (Biu and Oluwafunmilayo ; Javed Khan et al. ; Phiri et al. ), but about the correlation between the prevalence of the infection with breed is in conflict with Mazandaran, Zabol, and Galicia (Spain) studies (Eslami et al. ; González-Warleta et al. ; Khedri et al. ).
According to Vercruysse et al. ( ), the pathogenicity of mixed infection with different species of amphistomes, as it was shown in the present study, is similar; therefore, no special pathogenicity could be attributed to any species found in this study. On the other hand, there is little evidence regarding the pathogenicity of adult flukes to their hosts, although severe damage to the mucosa of the rumen is provoked in heavy infection and a large number of flukes can cause chronic ulcerative rumenitis accompanied by atrophy of rumen papillae (Love and Hutchinson ). According to Rolf et al., the presence of 20,000 to 25,000 mature flukes in the rumen can result in clinical disease and a smaller number would cause significant subclinical disease (Rolfe et al. ). Therefore, taking into consideration the overall mean of intensity (764.70), the highest number of collected flukes (6200) from one cattle, and mean ± SE of intensity in young animals (1287.6 ± 362.6), the amphistome burden can produce a subclinical form of the disease in the cattle of Gilan.
Conclusion
Amphistomiasis in Gilan province of Iran, with 97,000 purebred or hybrid, 288,000 native cattle, and 7000 buffalo ( https://dla.maj.ir/ ) is one of the most important parasitic diseases of cattle. The majority of this population is breeding in a traditional way by the villagers, which also increases the risk of parasitic infections. In general, the absence of any report on the pathogenicity and chemotherapy of cattle amphistomiasis in Iran may be due to veterinarians’ negligence and misjudgement, since, clinical signs of bovine amphistomiasis, mainly subclinical forms, are usually mild and fecal examination remains the only way to demonstrate the presence of adult worms. Therefore, our findings are of great significance to elucidate different aspects of the epidemiology of the disease in some parts of Iran, where formulating a control program should be taken into consideration. In order to effectively control amphistomosis in this geographical region, further studies including both gut and fecal examination, infections caused by immature forms, identification the species using molecular techniques, and also study on intermediate host snails should be made.
