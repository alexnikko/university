Introduction
Carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) is a sialylated Lewis blood group antigen, first described by Koprowski et al. in 1979 [ ]. CA19-9 is the most representative tumor marker that correlates with pancreatic cancer progression [ , , , ]. It has been widely used for diagnosis [ , , , ], determination of resectability [ , ], and evaluation of treatment response in pancreatic cancer [ , ].
Baseline CA19-9 has shown considerable false-positive and false-negative probabilities as a diagnostic or even a prognostic factor, which makes it difficult to determine the application of baseline CA19-9 for clinical practices [ ]. Until recently, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) has discouraged the usage of baseline CA19-9 as a screening tool for pancreatic cancer [ ].
Meanwhile, post-treatment CA19-9 levels of pancreatic cancer have been alternatively investigated for prognostic features, although an unusual elevation has also been reported [ ]. For patients with localized resectable disease, one prospective study demonstrated that postoperative CA19-9 level was correlated with survival after postoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) [ ]. Similarly, for patients with unresectable disease, post-CCRT CA19-9 level has been mainly evaluated for overall survival [ , ].
However, it was undetermined which CA19-9 level would be the optimal variable as a prognostic factor in locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) patients treated with CCRT [ ]. Furthermore, the cut-off points of diverse variables of CA19-9 level have not usually been calculated by a statistical method in many studies [ , ].
The purpose of this study was to assess the association between CA19-9 levels (at initial diagnosis, pre-CCRT, post-CCRT, change between initial and post-CCRT, and change between pre- and post-CCRT) and treatment outcome in patients with unresectable non-metastatic LAPC who were treated with CCRT.
Methods
Study population
Between August 2000 and July 2013, 219 consecutive patients with LAPC without distant metastasis underwent definitive CCRT at Seoul National University Hospital and Ewha Womans University Mokdong Hospital. Patients were considered unresectable based on imaging studies including computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
A retrospective chart review was performed according to the following eligibility criteria—(1) biopsy-proven carcinoma of the pancreas, (2) radiotherapy (RT) dose ≥40 Gy, (3) minimum follow-up period of 6 months for survivors, (4) CA19-9 level available at diagnosis (initial CA19-9), within 2 weeks before CCRT (pre-CCRT CA19-9) for patients undergoing upfront chemotherapy, and within 3 months after CCRT (post-CCRT CA19-9). Patients with initial CA19-9 <2 U/mL were considered as non-expressers and excluded from the study [ ]. Finally, a total of 97 patients were included in the current study.
Treatment scheme
All patients were treated with definitive CCRT. Fifty-nine patients (61.0%) underwent upfront chemotherapy before CCRT, and 62 patients (63.9%) were treated with additional chemotherapy after CCRT.
All patients received CCRT with conventional fractionation. The fraction size of RT was either 1.8 or 2.0 Gy. The majority of patients underwent sequential treatment of 45 Gy to the elective nodal region and primary tumor, followed by a boost to the primary tumor and involved nodes (81.4%). The RT dose ranged from 40−59.4 Gy, and 79 patients (81.4%) received a radiation dose of ≥50 Gy. Gemcitabine-containing combination chemotherapy was administered to 33 patients (34.0%), 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy to 32 patients (33.0%), and capecitabine to 32 patients (33.0%).
Evaluation of CA19-9 level
The initial CA19-9 level was defined as the latest serum CA19-9 level within 2 weeks before definitive treatment (CCRT or upfront chemotherapy before CCRT if given). For all patients who underwent upfront chemotherapy, the pre-CCRT values were evaluated separately. For patients not receiving upfront chemotherapy, the pre-CCRT CA19-9 level was defined as the initial CA19-9 level. The post-CCRT CA19-9 level was obtained within 3 months after CCRT. The change in CA19-9 level from initial to post-CCRT and from pre- to post-CCRT was calculated as follows: $$\begin{aligned} &{\text{CA19-}}9\,{\text{ change between initial and post-CCRT }}(\%) \\ &\quad = \frac{{\left\{ {({\text{post-CCRT CA19-9}} \, {\text{level}}) - ({\text{initial CA19-9}}\,{\text{level}})} \right\}}}{{({\text{initial CA19-9}}\,{\text{level}})}} \times 100 \hfill \\ \end{aligned}$$ $$\begin{aligned} &{\text{CA19-9}}\,{\text{change between pre- and post-CCRT }}(\%) \\ &\quad = \frac{{\left\{ {({\text{post-CCRT CA19-9}} \, {\text{level}}) - ({\text{pre-CCRT CA19-9}} \, {\text{level}})} \right\}}}{{({\text{pre-CCRT CA19-9}} \, {\text{level}})}} \times 100 \end{aligned}$$
Statistical analysis
Cut-off point analysis for overall survival was performed for continuous variables using maximally selected rank statistics as implemented in the package maxstat in R [ ]. Optimal cut-off points with statistical significance ( p < 0.05) were chosen for overall survival analysis. The Kaplan–Meier method was used to calculate survival probabilities from the day of image diagnosis. Overall survival was censored at the date of last follow-up for survivors. Univariate analysis was performed using the log-rank test on clinical factors. Only variables trending towards significance ( p < 0.10) on univariate analysis were evaluated in multivariable analysis. Pearson’s chi-squared test was used for the comparison of categorical variables between groups. Student’s t test was used for the comparison of two means. Statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS version 18.0. (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
Patient characteristics
Patient characteristics are listed in Table 1 . The median age was 61 years (range 35–78 years). There were 54 males and 43 females. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status was 0 or 1 in 83 patients (85.6%). All but two patients had adenocarcinoma. The other histologies included adenosquamous carcinoma and undifferentiated carcinoma. Clinical T and N stages at diagnosis were evaluated by abdominal CT scan and/or MRI. Lymph nodes measuring >10 mm in the short axis diameter were considered as involved nodes. All patients were staged according to the 7th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system. The number of patients with T4 and N1 stage was 87 (89.7%) and 40 (41.2%), respectively.

Treatment outcomes
Median survival was 14.7 months (95% CI 13.4–16.0), and the 2-year survival rate was 16.5%. The median initial, pre- and post-CCRT CA19-9 levels were 338 U/mL (range 2.0–24,000 U/mL), 182 U/mL (range 2.0–24,000 U/mL) and 75 U/mL (range 1.0–49,000 U/mL), respectively. Serum CA19-9 level decreased in 69 patients (71.1%) and increased in 28 patients (28.9%) after CCRT. The median CA19-9 level change between initial and post-CCRT was −35.2% (range −99.8 to 5518%), whereas median CA19-9 level change between pre- and post-CCRT was −18.0% (range −89.4 to 5518%).
Prognostic factors
Cut-off point estimations using R maxstat package were implemented for continuous variables. The variables included age (years), RT dose (Gy), initial CA19-9 level (U/mL), pre-CCRT CA19-9 level (U/mL), post-CCRT CA19-9 level (U/mL), CA19-9 level change between initial and post-CCRT (%), and CA19-9 level change between pre- and post-CCRT (%). Among various CA19-9 levels, the only significant cut-off point was identified in the CA19-9 level change between initial and post-CCRT. The optimal cut-off point of CA19-9 level change between initial and post-CCRT was 94.4% (maximal log-rank statistical M = 3.1225; p = 0.041) (Fig. 1 ). The distribution of CA19-9 levels according to the CA19-9 level change is described in Table 2 . Although the initial CA19-9 and pre-CCRT CA19-9 levels were not different between the two groups, the post-CCRT CA19-9 level showed a significantly different distribution ( p = 0.718, 0.597, and 0.034, respectively). The change in CA19-9 level between pre- and post-CCRT was marginally significant, and the estimated cut-off point was 26.9% (maximal log-rank statistical M = 2.9577; p = 0.065). These two estimated cut-off points for CA19-9 level changes were applied to dichotomize each variable before performing univariate analysis.

Other variables did not show statistical significance with their estimated cut-off points. Therefore, a CA19-9 level of 37 U/mL was used as a cut-off point of normal range for initial, pre- and post-CCRT CA19-9 on univariate analysis. Age ≥65 years was investigated on univariate analysis. RT dose was split into multiple ranges (cut-off points were 45, 50, and 54 Gy) and each dose range was evaluated on univariate analysis for overall survival.
Patient characteristics and treatment parameters were investigated in relation to overall survival with univariate analysis (Table 3 ). The prognostic factors significantly associated with overall survival were the use of upfront chemotherapy ( p = 0.022), CA19-9 level change between initial and post-CCRT with a cut-off point of 94.4% ( p < 0.001), and CA19-9 level change between pre- and post-CCRT with a cut-off point of 26.9% ( p < 0.001). RT dose ≥50 Gy ( p = 0.076), additional chemotherapy ( p = 0.058), and post-CCRT CA19-9 ≤37 U/mL ( p = 0.076) trended towards improved overall survival. On multivariate analysis, CA19-9 level change between initial and post-CCRT with a cut-off point of 94.4% was the only statistically significant variable for overall survival ( p < 0.001) (Table 4 ).

Treatment response and patterns of failure according to CA19-9 change
Tumor response to treatment was evaluated within 3 months after CCRT. Only one of 80 (1.3%) patients with CA19-9 change ≤94.4% presented with local progression. However, 4 of 17 (24%) patients with CA19-9 change >94.4% presented with local progression. The correlation between tumor response and CA19-9 change (dichotomized by 94.4%) was statistically significant ( p < 0.001).
However, the pattern of the first failure was similar between the two groups ( p = 0.951). The number of patients with local recurrence, distant metastasis, or both were 13 (16%), 30 (38%), and 16 (20%) in patients with CA19-9 change ≤94.4% and 2 (12%), 6 (35%), and 5 (29%) in those with CA19-9 change >94.4%, respectively.
Discussion
Among various CA19-9 levels tested in this study, which were initial, pre-CCRT, post-CCRT, change between initial and post-CCRT, and change between pre- and post-CCRT, only change between initial and post-CCRT achieved a statistically meaningful cut-off point (94.4%). The estimated optimal cut-off point of CA19-9 level change was highly correlated with overall survival for LAPC treated with CCRT.
For LAPC, post-CCRT CA19-9 has been regarded as a promising surrogate and several studies evaluated the correlation between post-CCRT CA19-9 and prognosis [ , ]. A cut-off point of post-CCRT CA19-9 was usually extrapolated from the RTOG 9704 study; around 90–100 U/mL was one of the choices [ ]. The cut-off point of RTOG 9704, however, was not obtained from statistical calculation. It originated from CONKO-001, a randomized controlled trial of postoperative gemcitabine versus observation for pancreatic cancer, in which patients with a CA19-9 level >2.5 times the upper limit of normal (around 90 U/mL) were excluded [ ]. On this historical basis, following studies compared the outcomes between CA19-9 ≤90 U/mL with >90 U/mL. In our study, the cut-off point of 90 U/mL for post-CCRT was not univariately significant for survival ( p = 0.321).
Koom et al. performed univariate analysis at each range to search for optimal cut-off points. Although all the cut-off points of post-CCRT CA19-9 from 37−1000 affected overall survival, 100 U/mL demonstrated the greatest prognostic power on univariate analysis. On multivariate analysis incorporating decline of CA19-9 (%), however, the prognostic power of post-CCRT CA19-9 disappeared [ ].
In the current study, no statistically significant cut-off point for post-CCRT CA19-9 was obtained. Instead, CA19-9 change between initial and post-CCRT was the only prognosticator after multivariate analysis. The change of CA19-9 after definitive CCRT, therefore, seemed to be a critical indicator of prognosis rather than various absolute quantities of CA19-9 (initial, pre- or even post-CCRT CA19-9). In addition, treatment effect could also be evaluated using CA19-9 change. The serum CA19-9 test is safe, economical, and immediately available during any treatment period. The significant association between CA19-9 change and treatment response in our study suggests that CA19-9 change >94.4% can be a surrogate for disease progression even when radiographic evidence is unavailable. For further analyses, we separated the patients into two subgroups according to the use of upfront chemotherapy. Nvertheless, on multivariate analyses in each subgroup, CA19-9 change between initial and post-CCRT >94.4% was significantly associated with inferior overall survival (data not shown). Therefore, regardless of receiving upfront chemotherapy, the selection of CA19-9 change with a cut-off point of 94.4% from diagnosis to the completion of CCRT may be an acceptable choice.
There is no consensus on the treatment for LAPC, which leads to substantial heterogeneity among therapeutic regimens [ ]. Huguet et al. demonstrated that CCRT improved survival in patients with controlled LAPC after chemotherapy compared with continuing chemotherapy alone (15.0 vs 11.7 months) [ ]. Although CCRT failed to show superiority over chemotherapy alone in patients with controlled LAPC after chemotherapy in a subsequent randomized trial [ ], there are several institutional reports favoring CCRT over chemotherapy alone [ , ]. In our study, an RT dose >50 Gy showed a trend towards improved survival ( p = 0.071), which implies that patients with LAPC might benefit from CCRT.
Some patients may benefit from upfront chemotherapy followed by CCRT [ ]. Our study also demonstrated that upfront chemotherapy was also associated with improved overall survival with statistical significance on univariate analysis ( p = 0.022) and borderline significance on multivariate analysis ( p = 0.060). Regarding CA19-9 change, the CA19-9 level decreased after completion of upfront chemotherapy, and therefore the pre-CCRT CA19-9 level was lower with borderline significance (median 91 U/mL with upfront chemotherapy vs 539 U/mL without upfront chemotherapy, p = 0.053). However, the difference in the post-CCRT CA19-9 level was not statistically significant between the two groups ( p = 0.172) (Supplementary table). This is because the CA19-9 level decreased to a greater extent during upfront chemotherapy, but not as much during CCRT. Therefore, the CA19-9 change between initial and post-CCRT may be a more appropriate surrogate of treatment outcome than the change between pre- and post-CCRT.
This study is limited by its retrospective nature. Other limitations of this study include relatively small sample size, and heterogeneous treatment regimens. Patients without CA19-9 level data were excluded which therefore leads to selection bias.
In conclusion, for LAPC patients treated with CCRT, the change in CA19-9 between initial and post-CCRT, rather than absolute CA19-9 level after CCRT, may identify patients at higher risk for treatment failure.
