Introduction
Attention is the process for enhanced processing and integration, and memory is the ability to store, retain, and recall information and experiences (Winkler and Cowan ). Recent research has concentrated on the formation of new plant based medicine that boosts cognitive skills, as medicinal plants are claimed to possess antioxidant and cognitive enhancing effects (Saenghong et al. ). Caffeine is one of the widely consumed throughout the world in beverages, foods, and as a drug for a variety of reasons, including its stimulant-like effects on mood and cognitive performance (Fredholm et al. ; Lieberman et al. ).
Different beverages have been used as attention and memory enhancers (having caffeine) in Asian, Indian, and Arabic folklore like coffee arabica (Qahwa) and coffee robusta. Arabic coffee is a traditional drink prepared in many Arab countries throughout the Middle East by using coffee arabica green beans (without/slight roasted) which contain 12 mg of caffeine per gram of dry mass (Silvarolla et al. ). Coffee robusta is prepared by boiling finely powdered roasted beans (either coffee robusta or coffee arabica) possibly with sugar (Jamieson ) while coffee arabica (Qahwa) is made from coffee beans (without/slight roasted) and cardamom. Traditionally, green coffee beans are roasted at home slightly and ground (Mahmoud et al. ). Coffee robusta bean excessively roasted (250 °C) to produce more bitterness than arabica (Qahwa) due to their pyrazine content (Wintgens ).
Previously, the effects of coffee have been assessed scientifically (Mesas et al. ; Nehlig ). Coffee has both good and bad effects, both of which may impact on cognitive performance. Coffee is found to increase neuron activity in the frontal lobe, the site of working memory which regulates the ability to pay attention (Ryan et al. ). There are multiple theories that the presence of caffeine in coffee affects short-term memory, due to an increase in concentration. In addition, caffeine has a direct effect on brain functions. It stimulates brain areas that cover short-term memory and attention. Caffeine causes the blood vessels in the brain to constrict, and boosts metabolism. The neurons in the brain work faster when affected by caffeine. This causes a chain reaction that leads to mental alertness that allows for better concentration and consequently, better recall of information (Hameleers et al. ). In conclusion, different studies revealed that coffee robusta enhanced attention and cognitive performance under the condition of stress and sleep deprivation (Patat et al. ; Reyner and Horne ).
Qahwa is a cultural drink believed to have anti-atherosclerotic (Alsaif et al. ) and anti-inflammatory effects and markers of inflammation were significantly lowered by intake of Arabian Qahwa (Habib et al. ). Coffee arabica (Qahwa) is flavor-rich with cardamom. Cardamom ( Elettaria cardamomum ) contained α terpineol, myrcene, limonene, menthone, β-phellandrene, 1,8-cineol, sabinene and heptane and borneol (Farooq et al. ) found to possess anxiolytic (Masoumi-Ardakani et al. ) and it enhance learning and memory retention as compared to control (Abu-Taweel ).
However, coffee arabica (Qahwa) has still not been investigated for its described effects, although it is traditionally consumed in many Arab countries throughout the Middle East. The present study, therefore, aims to observe the effect of coffee arabica (Qahwa) on memory and compare the effect of coffee arabica (Qahwa) and coffee robusta on psychomotor performance.
Materials and methods
For the estimation of cholorogenic acid (CGA) in coffee robusta and coffee arabica (Qahwa), a thin layer chromatography (TLC) was performed. Isolation solvent Isopropanol–formic acid (10:0.5 v /v) was used in TLC (Wen et al. ).
Subjects
This study was carried out on 300 young adult women aged 18–26 years old. The participants were students at Umm Al-Qura University (UQU). They were informed about the possibility of receiving water, coffee robusta and coffee arabica (Qahwa), when they signed up. Prior to the day of research activity, subjects were requested to have their normal night’s sleep, to abstain from any type of beverage (caffeinated /uncaffeinated) or any medicine for 24 h prior to testing, and to abstain from food three hours prior to testing. A self-reported absence of any physical or neurological conditions that affect visual, tactile, or auditory performance, using stimuli criterion designed according to the National Drug Strategy, 1998 (Reid et al. ), was also required to meet the eligibility criteria for the study. Some participants were excluded on these latter criteria .
Materials
The participant were randomly divided into three groups.
Group I 12 g of 2 in 1 City Cafe coffee (Coffee robusta) instant coffee + One sugar sachet of 4.6 g + 100 ml of water added to each cup.
Group II 3.02 g of coffee arabica (Qahwa) and 2.04 g of ground cardamom were used to make 100 ml cup without sugar.
Group III 100 ml of drinking water.
Procedure
The research was approved by the Umm Al Qura University. The participants filled out and signed a consent form before the start of experiment. Task sessions were conducted between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. on weekdays. The participants came to a designated room and received general instruction. Before drinking, questionnaires were given out including a nine-question survey about their normal sleep and caffeine consumption. The participants were told to choose any one cup (100 ml of water or Coffee robusta or coffee arabica/Qahwa). After sixty minutes, the participants were instructed that they had started the further tests. They were also told not to write anything until told to do so.
Sleepiness assessment scales (Karolinska sleepiness scale KSS)
The Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS; Reyner and Horne ), is a 9-point Likert-type self-report scale used to subjectively assess sleepiness.
Clear headedness rating scale (CH)
The Clear Headedness Rating Scale (CH), developed by Bruck and Pisani ( ) is a 5-point Likert-type scale used to subjectively assess clear headedness, or the grogginess associated with sleep inertia (Bruck and Pisani ) .
Trail making test A and B
This test (Tombaugh ) was done to assess attention and explore the ability of coordination (visuomotor) and processing speed during the arrangement of both numbers and letters (Lezak et al. ) .
Part A
In part A, the participant should connect the numbers (1–25) in ascending order (Tombaugh ) .
Part B
In part B, participants were instructed to connect the circles in an alternating pattern between the numbers and letters (i.e., 1-A-2-B-3-C, etc.) in 30 s. Errors affected the participant’s scores and were considered as negative scores, deducted from positive scores (Corrigan ) .
The symbol digit and digit symbol substitution task (SDST)
This is a screening tool for the detection of cerebral dysfunction (Strauss et al. ) and divided attention (Ponsford and Kinsella ). In this pencil-and-paper task, participants were presented with a coding key in which the numbers 1 to 9 correspond to different arbitrary abstract symbols (Tietzel and Lack ). During test participants are required accurately to fill in as many boxes as possible within a 30 s time period. Scores are calculated by summing the number of correctly completed items, but points are not deducted for errors.
Letter cancellation test (LCT)
The Letter Cancellation Test (LCT) assesses selective attention and requires visual scanning and motor speed skills. Participants were presented with a large 32 × 45 matrix of random capital letters and asked to search for two particular stimuli, e.g., ‘L’ and ‘U’ line by line from left to right in a 30 s time period (Lezak et al. ; Tietzel and Lack ).
Stroop effect
In psychology, the Stroop effect demonstrates the reaction time of a task. During the task, the name of a color (e.g., “red” “blue” or “green”) was printed in a different color (e.g., the word “green” was printed in blue ink instead of green ink). The participant was instructed to read the name of the color, not the word (Stroop ). In the second experiment, participants were asked to read the color of the letters instead of the written word (Porges and Furman ).
Card recall test (CRT)
The participants were instructed that they would be shown twenty different pictures for 30 s. After the two minutes were up, the participants were given another set of pictures and instructed to separate those pictures that were also present in first set. This test measures prefrontal functions, assessing different dimensions: cognitive processing speed, concept formation, inhibition capacity and cognitive flexibility (Adan and Serra-Grabulosa ).
Talland letter cancellation (TLC)
Talland Letter Cancellation (Bittner et al. ) is a test to measure the ability to “focus” attention and screen out distraction. In each trial, the participants were asked to examine rows to cross out target in 30 s.
In Trails 1 and 2 (capitals), participants drew a line on capital letters.
In Trials 3 and 4 (spaces), participants drew a line before and after each double space.
In Trials 5 and 6 (both), participants performed both types of assigned targets (i.e. capitals and spaces).
Statistical analysis
A power analysis suggested that the sample size be set at N = 159 (53 per group) to achieve a power of 0.8, given a medium effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.25) and an alpha of 0.05 calculated by G*Power (Erdfelder et al. ). However, in the present study number of volunteers per group N = 100 were enrolled. Result of this analysis indicated that 100 subjects per group yielded a statistical power of 0.97 if inputs were, 3 groups, α = 0.05, total sample size = 300, critical F = 3.026 (d.f. = 2, 297).
All hypotheses were tested using analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests. Alpha was set at (0.05). Significant effects were subjected to Tukey’s multiple-range tests for comparison of treatment means with a control.
Results
The results of TLC are shown in Fig. 1 . The isolation time was 10 min for separation of CGA with isopropanol:formic acid (10:0.5 v /v) as the solvent (RF = 0.29), and both of the isolations were performed at the temperature of 25 °C.

Clear headedness chart and sleep chart
The Clear headedness chart test, used to assess the focus component of attention, did not find any significant differences in water ( P = 0.96, non-significant) and coffee robusta ( P = 0.88, non-significant) groups, when compared with each respective control (before ingestion Table 1 ). However, the increase in score regarding attention after coffee arabica (Qahwa) ingestion were statistically significant (F (5,594) = 3.28 P = 0.03, P < 0.05) when compared to control (before ingestion of coffee arabica, Table 1 ).

A Sleep chart is used to assess sleep criteria. For the pooled data for all treatment groups, showed a significant decrease in response and decrease in sleepiness (F (5,594) = 7.203 P = 0.0001, P < 0.05). Statistical analysis for the Sleep chart shows that the mean scores decreased after ingestion of coffee robusta ( P = 0.2 non-significant) and coffee arabica (Qahwa), and after ingestion of coffee arabica this decrease approached significance (P < 0.05).
Trail making test part A and B
The Trail Making test A was used to assess the focus component of attention. There were non-significant differences in scores, (F 2,297 = 1.6, P = 0.2, P > 0.05). The results (Table 2 ) show that that the mean correct responses increased after the ingestion of coffee robusta and coffee arabica (Qahwa) but non-significantly (P > 0.05) as compared to control. For the pooled data for Trail Making B, showed a significant increase in correct response (F 2,297 = 6.537, P = 0.0001, P < 0.05). Statistical analysis for the Trail Making B showed that the mean correct answer increased after the ingestion of coffee robusta ( P < 0.05) and coffee arabica (Qahwa) and this increase was statistically significant (P < 0.05) when compared with control.

Symbol digit and digit symbol substitution task (SDST) and letter cancellation
The score results of Symbol digit and letter cancellation tests used to assess attention, revealed significance (F 2,297 = 5.63, P = 0.005, P < 0.05). Results of Tukey HSD Post-hoc Test showed that consumption of coffee arabica (Qahwa) increases the score significantly (P = 0.005, P < 0.05) when compared to water ( P < 0.05) as shown in Table 2 . A non-significant difference between water and coffee robusta ( p > 0.05) was observed in both tests.
Talland test
A Talland test was used to assess attention, speed and accuracy. The results showed that significant differences were observed between beverage groups (F 2,297 = 5.39, P = 0.006, P < 0.05) when compared with control. Statistical analysis for the Talland test showed that the mean correct answer/score increased after ingestion of coffee arabica (Qahwa) significantly ( P < 0.05) when compared with water ( P = 0.006) and coffee robusta ( P = 0.02, Table 2 ).
Stroop test
The present study indicated that different drinks consumed had a significant effect on reaction times (F 2,297 = 5.55, P = 0.006, P < 0.05) and errors (F 2,297 = 3.115, P = 0.04, P < 0.05). Statistical analysis for the Stroop test showed that the mean reaction time increased significantly after the ingestion of coffee arabica/Qahwa ( p < 0.05), and this increase in mean correct answer was being greater compared to the coffee robusta ( P = 0.02, p < 0.05) group, as shown in Table 2 . The ANOVA performed for the errors/mistake in reaction revealed a significant decrease in error was observed between water and coffee arabica (p < 0.05). After coffee robusta ingestion performance also showed impairments with more incorrect responses although statistically nonsignificant ( P = 0.9),
Card recall test
The score results of card recall tests, revealed significance (F 2,297 = 10.70, P = 0.007, P < 0.05). Tukey HSD Post-hoc Statistical analysis for the card test showed that the mean correct answer increased after ingestion of coffee arabica (Qahwa), and this increase approached significance (P < 0.05). Card test was used to assess memory. The result showed significant differences between water and Arabic coffee (P < 0.05). Consumption of coffee decreased the mean score (4.36 ± 0.09), though non-significantly (P < 0.05) as shown in Table 2 .
Discussion
The results of the present study are presented in Tables 1 - 2 . The results confirm that coffee robusta and coffee arabica (Qahwa) are associated with memory and cognitive functions.
During the present study, coffee robusta and coffee arabica (Qahwa) was ingested and different tasks were performed after thirty minutes, as it is rapidly absorbed in 30–40 min and has a half-life of between 3 and 6 h (Rogers et al. ) . All psychological tasks were performed on subjects between 8:00 am and 12:00 noon because short-term memory (STM) is thought to be influenced differently throughout the day (Mitchell and Redman ). In other work, when coffee robusta has been ingested in the morning, STM performance will be different than at the end of the day (Mitchell and Redman ). Foreman et al. reported that there were non-significant effects of coffee robusta on response times or recall tasks. In the present results after coffee robusta consumption, the subjects have slower response than the coffee arabica (Qahwa) group. The current results were in accordance of (Foreman et al. ), who suggested that subjects who were given coffee robusta were weak and showed slow responses during the Stroop test. The researchers suggest that coffee robusta may have a detrimental effect on the rapid processing of ambiguous or confusing stimuli. Coffee robusta administered in subjects recalled fewer words than control subjects in the card test (Table 2 ), and also behind the control subjects in recalling the lists (Terry and Phifer ) . However, other studies have shown that coffee robusta intake has no effect ( Herz ) . Coffee robusta has been shown to have beneficial effects on cognitive performance when individuals are sleep-deprived (Patat et al. ; Reyner and Horne ) it increase subjective alertness and reduce fatigue (Adan et al. ; Hewlett and Smith ) and reduce the adverse effects of sleep deprivation and exposure to severe environmental and operational stress on cognitive performance (Lieberman et al. ). The same was observed in the present study, after coffee robusta intake subjects felt alert and clearheaded, although the difference was non-significant (Table 1 ). This result was also obtained by (Hameleers et al. ) who found a correlation between caffeine consumption and improved mental alertness. Caffeine helped attention to remain sharper.
Coffee robusta has beneficial effects on reaction times and sustained attention tasks. Studies have found it improves motor-skill performance (driving task; Brice and Smith : and handwriting ; Tucha et al. ). These findings are in accordance with our results, confirming that drinking coffee robusta improves the psychological performance as tested by Talland, digit symbol and LCT (Table 2 ) but non significantly. Another source suggests that coffee robusta alters the levels of CNS neurotransmitters and metabolism of circulating free fatty acids. The end result is an increase in blood sugar indirectly by metabolism (Williams ). Sugar (glucose) is used in the present study in coffee robusta while coffee arabica (Qahwa) was served without sugar. Previously Serra-Grabulosa et al. ( ) quoted that combined caffeine (coffee robusta) and glucose could increase the efficiency of the attentional system studies. Serra-Grabulosa (Serra-Grabulosa et al. ) used 75 g sugar that is far higher than the levels found in sweetened coffee robusta. It is also higher than the 5 g used in present studies that’s why during the present study coffee robusta was not found to increase the efficiency of the attentional system studies significantly compared to coffee arabica (qahwa), it only improves the attention (Table 2 ).
Compared to water (control) and coffee robusta, the consumption of coffee arabica (Qahwa) had significant beneficial effects on the execution of simple reaction-time tasks and sequential reaction time, alertness and memory tests (talland test, digit symbol test, symbol digit test, card test, stroop test and trail making test) as shown in Table 2 . This current study suggesting that coffee arabica (Qahwa) is a more effective cognition enhancer. Coffee robusta and coffee arabica (Qahwa) come from same plant. Green coffee beans are used for the preparation of coffee arabica, while coffee robusta is prepared by brewing roasted, ground beans (Vincent ) . Roasting cause degradation of many contents (polysaccharides, sugars, amino acids and chlorogenic acids), and an increase in organic acids and lipids (Cuong et al. ). In coffee arabica (green seeds) the Chlorogenic acids CGA are intact, as shown in the present TLC from this study (Fig. 1 ). Chlorogenic acids (CGA) in coffee seeds completely convert into phenol and quinolactones due to excessive roasting (Clifford ; Farah et al. ) . This CGA compounds present in green coffee are highly absorbed and metabolized in humans (Farah et al. ). Chlorogenic acids (CGA), which are present in high concentrations in Coffee arabica/qahwa (Fig. 1 ) have exhibited their action in the brain function (Farah et al. ) and exert anti-amnesic activity via inhibition of an enzyme (acetylcholinesterase) and malondialdehyde in the hippocampus and frontal cortex, so increasing memory process (Kwon et al. ). Not only the CGA, Another constituent of coffee arabica (Qahwa) is cardamom ( Elettaria cardamomum ), previously reported to enhance learning and memory retention as compared to control (Abu-Taweel ).
Another study revealed that significant attention and memory (Trail B, Digit Symbol Test and Stroop) scores were associated with cardiac output (Putzke et al. ). Cardamom in coffee arabica (Qahwa ) increased the cardiac output ( Bhaswant et al. ). Thus the presence of CGA in coffee arabica and cardamom both has promising beneficial effects on attention, memory and psychological performance.
Limitation of study
Finally, it is important to emphasize that there are some limitations to our study. It should be stressed that our results must be considered as preliminary, as we only used 100 subjects (on a voluntary basis aged between 18 and 26 years young adult womens’) per group, although statistically significant, were found in the coffee arabica groups. The sample size used in present study correlates medium effect size with 0.97 power, For that reason, there is no assurance that present results could be applicable to other populations and conditions.
Conclusion
It is concluded that coffee arabica (Qahwa) is a more effective cognition enhancer, having intact polysaccharides, sugars (glucose), amino acids and chlorogenic acids (CGA) while it burns in coffee robusta due to excessive roasting. Second, cardamom in coffee arabica (Qahwa) increases cardiac output, which has having beneficial effects on psychological performance (attention and memory).
