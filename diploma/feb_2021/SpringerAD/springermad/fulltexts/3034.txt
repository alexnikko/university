Introduction
The preoperative use of systemic chemotherapy using developed cytotoxic and/or targeted drugs, such as induction chemotherapy [ , , ], and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) alone [ , , , ], or as a part of total neoadjuvant therapy [ ], is widespread in the treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). Excellent response to neoadjuvant therapy has been reported to yield a favorable outcome in several studies [ , , ]. On the other hand, major problems in neoadjuvant treatment include overtreatment and tumor progression during therapy. However, individual responses to NAC are varied and remain difficult to predict prior to therapy. Our sincere hope is to establish the predictive factors of response to preoperative chemotherapy, providing patients with greater certainty regarding treatment outcomes.
A RAS mutation disturbs the use of anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibodies and is thought to confer resistance to systemic chemotherapy in a palliative setting [ , , ]. A BRAF mutation is reported to be a negative predictor of both the response to chemotherapy and survival [ ]. However, in a neoadjuvant setting using oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab (Bev), the role of RAS/BRAF mutation status has not been reported and is still unclear.
The aim of this study was to assess the response to oxaliplatin-based NAC and subsequent survival in patients with LARC according to their RAS/BRAF mutation status.
Patients and methods
Patients
A retrospective analysis was performed based on information prospectively collected from our colorectal cancer database. The inclusion criteria for this study were patients with a clinical stage II/III mid or low rectal adenocarcinoma diagnosis who were being treated with oxaliplatin-based NAC. Between January 2009 and March 2016, a total of 84 patients meeting these criteria were treated at Nagoya University Hospital in Nagoya, Japan. Of these 84 patients, 20 patients who underwent upfront surgery and 7 patients with unknown mutation status were excluded from this study. Therefore, the remaining 57 patients were included in this analysis (Fig. 1 ). All patients had been assessed by clinical examination, carcinoembryonic antigen measurement, total colonoscopy, chest and abdominopelvic computed tomography, and pelvic magnetic resonance imaging. Tumors were evaluated in accordance with the 7th edition of the International Union Against Cancer TNM staging system. Enlarged lymph nodes (LNs) with short-axis diameters of 5 mm or more were judged to be positive for cancer. LNs were divided into the two categories: regional LNs within the mesorectum and lateral pelvic LNs outside of the mesorectum (including LNs along the internal iliac vessels and within the obturator space).

This study was approved by the Nagoya University Hospital Institutional Review Board.
Treatment
All patients received oxaliplatin-based NAC with or without Bev for 2–4 months. Regimens of chemotherapy included XELOX (oxaliplatin + xeloda) and FOLFOX (oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and fluorouracil). In cases treated with Bev, Bev was not included in the last cycle to avoid delayed wound healing as previously reported [ , ]. No patients received preoperative radiotherapy in this series. Total mesorectal excision or more extended surgery was performed at a median of 5 (3–10) weeks after the last administration of NAC. Additionally, lateral pelvic lymph node dissection (LPLD) was performed in patients with low rectal cancer according to the Japanese guidelines [ ] (although recommendations were given at the multidisciplinary conference). There were no patients who became inoperable due to the tumor progression during the NAC treatment period.
Pathological assessment
Surgical specimens were subjected to conventional processing. R0 resection was defined according to the actual margins. Grades of histological regression were assessed using the tumor regression grade advocated by Dworak et al. [ ]. All patients were classified into two groups according to tumor regression grading (TRG): responders (TRG 3/4) and non-responders (TRG 0–2). The mutation analysis of RAS/BRAF was performed using tumor DNA obtained from the pretreatment biopsy tissue. Tumor cells were isolated using microdissection, and the genomic DNA was extracted. PCR analysis was performed to detect the specific RAS/BRAF mutation. All patients were classified into two groups based on mutation status: wild-type in both RAS and BRAF (WT) or mutant-type in either RAS or BRAF (MT).
Statistical analyses
Possible clinical and pathological factors were compared in terms of RAS/BRAF mutations. Variables were compared by the Fisher exact test or the Mann–Whitney U test, as appropriate. Relapse-free survival (RFS) was defined as the time from the induction of chemotherapy to the time of any type of disease recurrence or death from any cause. RFS rates were determined by the Kaplan–Meier method and the comparisons were performed using the log-rank tests. All reported p values are the results of two-sided testing with significance at p < 0.05. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software version 20.0 (IBM Japan Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).
Results
Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the 57 patients and their associated RAS/BRAF mutation status. Tumors were diagnosed as clinical T4 disease in 22 patients (39%) and as clinical N2 disease in 14 patients (25%). LPLN was initially judged as positive for cancer in 22 patients (38%). Bev was added to the oxaliplatin-based regimen in 21 patients (37%). Regarding mutation status, 23 patients (40.3%) were classified as WT and the remaining 34 patients (59.6%) were MT. The detailed mutation status in the MT group included KRAS mutation ( n = 30), NRAS mutation ( n = 2), and BRAF mutation ( n = 2). The baseline clinical parameters were similar between the WT and MT groups.

Operative and pathological results are shown in Table 2 . The rate of performing sphincter-preserving surgery and LPLD was similar in both groups. The N down-staging rate in the WT group was 89%, which was higher than that in the MT group. On the other hand, the T down-staging rate was similar in both groups. In the WT group, the R0 resection rate was 91%, which was higher compared to the MT group (79%), but there was no statistical significance. Histological response to NAC was similar in both groups. All patients who achieved pCR had no LN metastasis. Table 3 shows the univariate analysis of predicting factors associated with tumor response to NAC. None of the pretreatment values, including RAS/BRAF mutation status, could predict the response. However, there was a trend towards the use of Bev yielding desirable response to NAC ( p = 0.066).

During the median follow-up of 33 (6.7–82) months, 12 patients developed recurrent disease. Recurrent sites were local in 3 patients and in a distant location in 11 patients, including the lung ( n = 8), liver ( n = 3), and peritoneum ( n = 1). Among the 3 patients who developed local relapse, 2 patients (67%) had coincidence of distant metastasis. In responders, the 3-year RFS was better compared to non-responders (92 and 66%, respectively), but the difference did not reach statistical significance ( p = 0.065) (Fig. 2 a). In the WT group, the 3-year RFS was 95%, which was significantly better compared to the MT group (59%, p = 0.011) (Fig. 2 b). The MT group was further subdivided into the following 2 groups using the NAC effect: the MT responders ( n = 10) and MT non-responders ( n = 24). The incidence of recurrent disease in the MT responders was 10%, whereas it was 42% in the MT non-responders. The 3-year RFS was 50% in the MT non-responders, which was the worst among the four groups (Fig. 3 a) and was significantly decreased compared to the remaining patients (92%, p = 0.001) (Fig. 3 b). Three patients died during this study period, all of which were MT non-responders. Fig. 2 a The 3-year relapse-free survival (RFS) was 92% in the pathological responders which was better compared to the pathological non-responders, but not statistically significant (66%, p = 0.065). b The 3-year RFS was 95% in the wild-type group, which was significantly better than in the mutant-type group (59%, p = 0.011) Fig. 3 a The RFS curves according to the RAS/BRAF mutation status and the pathological response. Among these 4 groups, RFS was worst in patients who had either a RAS or BRAF mutation (MT) and could not achieve favorable pathological response (non-responders). b The 3-year RFS was 50% in the MT non-responders which was significantly worse compared to that in the remaining patients (92%, p = 0.001)
Discussion
RAS/BRAF mutations have been suggested to be predictive factors of poor response and survival in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer in palliative settings treated with systemic chemotherapy [ , , , ]. On the other hand, according to stage II-III resected colorectal cancers, the impact of RAS/BRAF mutations on the survival is still controversial [ , , ]. Moreover, the influence of the perioperative chemotherapy has been hardly evaluated. Both clinicians and patients earnestly desire the revelation of the predictive markers of response to neoadjuvant treatment. In this study, we investigated the impact of RAS and BRAF mutations on treatment outcome in patients with LARC treated with NAC and found that they did not affect the response. However, in patients with either a RAS or BRAF mutation who could not achieve a favorable pathological response, the RFS was likely to be poor. The RFS was favorable in patients who were RAS/BRAF wild-type regardless of the pathological response.
Regarding the impact of RAS/BRAF mutations in patients treated with preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT), conflicting results have been reported. Chow et al. found that a KRAS mutation was independently associated with poor response to CRT [ ]. Other reports suggested the same result, but it was dependent on the KRAS codon [ , ]. Conversely, several studies concluded that KRAS/BRAF mutations were not associated with treatment outcomes [ , , ]. However, the role of the RAS/BRAF mutations on outcomes in patients with LARC treated with systemic chemotherapy alone has never been reported. Because the standard treatment for LARC in Western countries is preoperative CRT, it lacks realness to investigate the impact of chemotherapy without radiotherapy on LARC. In Japan, the standard treatment is still upfront surgery and the use of radiotherapy is not common [ ]. Under such circumstances, we could evaluate the role in the treatment of LARC treated with NAC alone.
Despite the response has no relation to the RAS/BRAF mutations status, the survival in the MT non-responder is likely to be worse compared to the other group. For patients in the MT non-responder, oxaliplatin-based NAC alone followed by surgical resection is insufficient. The additional CRT or more powerful regimen, such as FOLFOXIRI might be suitable. The BACCHUS trail, which is a randomized phase II trial comparing neoadjuvant FOLFOX + Bev and FOLFOXIRI (FOLFOX + irinotecan) + Bev, investigates the pCR rate after NAC alone in patients with LARC in the United Kingdom [ ]. The results of this study are eagerly awaited. On the other hand, regardless of the response to NAC, NAC alone with the omission of subsequent radiotherapy could become an option for those with WT RAS/BRAF.
Although this is the first report that makes mention of the relationship between RAS/BRAF mutations and outcome in LARC treated with NAC alone, limitations of the present study include its small sample size, retrospective design, and using various regimen with or without Bev. Moreover, the specific mutation in the KRAS codon was unknown in some patients. However, this study suggests that RAS/BRAF mutation status might be helpful in building personalized treatment for patients with LARC. We have to further investigate the impact of various subtypes of those genomic mutations.
Conclusions
RAS/BRAF mutations have no effect on the response to NAC. However, the RFS was likely to be poor for those in the MT group who did not achieve a favorable pathological response. To clarify the cause and predictive markers of response to NAC should be a next topic. In contrast, the RFS was favorable in the WT group regardless of the pathological response. NAC followed by curative resection might be an option in this group.
