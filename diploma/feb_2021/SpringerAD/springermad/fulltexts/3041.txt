Introduction
Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) represents a particularly unpleasant adverse effect of chemotherapy. As CINV reduces the quality of life and sometimes makes continuation of treatment difficult, its management is extremely important for performance of safe and effective chemotherapy.
The standard antiemetic treatment for patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC) is a three-drug antiemetic regimen [neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist (NK 1 RA), 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 receptor antagonist, and dexamethasone] [ , ]. Standard treatment with NK 1 RA, palonosetron, and dexamethasone achieves a complete response (CR: no emesis and no use of rescue medications) rate of 91.8% in the acute phase (0–24 h) and 67.2% in the delayed phase (24–120 h) [ ]. Thus, control of delayed emesis is still poor, with further studies being required to improve its management.
Olanzapine is an antipsychotic agent that acts as an antagonist of serotonin 5-HT 2A/2C , 5-HT 3 , 5-HT 6 , dopamine D 1–4 , histamine H 1 , and adrenergic α 1 receptors [ , , ]. It also exhibits an antagonistic effect on D 2 , 5-HT 2C , and 5-HT 3 receptors, which are related to CINV, suggesting the possibility of this drug being a useful antiemetic agent. Olanzapine was administered at a dose of 10 mg in most of the previous studies that investigated its antiemetic effect [ , , , , ]. Tan et al. reported that somnolence occurred in 73% of patients that received olanzapine at this dose [ ]. While several studies have evaluated the antiemetic effect of olanzapine at a lower dose of 5 mg, there have been few reports published with detailed information relating to adverse events at this dose [ , ].
We conducted a double-blind randomized phase II dose-finding study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of olanzapine (10 or 5 mg) as add-on therapy to a standard antiemetic treatment in patients receiving HEC.
Patients and methods
Study design
This study was a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, phase II dose-finding study conducted at 6 centers in Japan. Eligible patients were centrally randomized to either 10 or 5 mg of olanzapine in a 1:1 ratio, considering gender and cisplatin dose (≥ 70 vs. < 70 mg/m 2 ) as adjustment factors using a stratified block randomization [ ]. This study was registered with the UMIN Clinical Trials Registry as UMIN000014214.
This study was done in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the institutional review boards of all participating centers.
Patients
The main eligibility criteria were patients aged 20–75 years with a solid tumor, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0–2; patients receiving the first course of a highly emetogenic chemotherapy regimen based on cisplatin (≥ 50 mg/m 2 ) (however, patients who had previously received highly emetogenic cisplatin-based chemotherapy could be enrolled if at least 3 months had passed since the final day of treatment in that regimen); adequate major organ function (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase < 100 IU/L, bilirubin < 2.0 mg/dL, and creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min); and written informed consent of the patient. The main exclusion criteria were hypersensitivity to olanzapine, aprepitant, palonosetron, or dexamethasone; serious concurrent disease; symptomatic brain metastasis; a history of diabetes or HbA1c ≥ 6.5% according to the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program; or scheduled to receive radiotherapy to the abdominal region.
Treatment and masking
Olanzapine (10 or 5 mg) was given orally once daily after supper on days 1 through 4. In each arm, the following standard prophylactic antiemetic treatment was given: oral aprepitant (125 mg on day 1 and 80 mg on days 2–3) and intravenous palonosetron (0.75 mg on day 1) and dexamethasone (intravenous infusion or orally 12 mg on day 1 and 8 mg on days 2–4). Intravenous administration of fosaprepitant was also permitted. In that case, patients received intravenous fosaprepitant (150 mg on day 1) and intravenous palonosetron (0.75 mg on day 1) and dexamethasone (intravenous infusion or orally 12 mg on day 1, 8 mg on day 2 and 16 mg on days 3–4).
Pharmacists at the participating institutions pulverized the required amount of olanzapine tablets and mixed the powder with lactose to make 10 and 5 mg doses that were visually identical (blinded administration), and packed the mixture into sachets so that the final weight of the two test medications was equal. To ensure in-hospital blinding, dose assignment and blinding of olanzapine at each participating institution were performed by independent pharmacists so that leakage of information to other hospital staff and patients could be prevented.
Assessments
The primary endpoint was the CR rate in the delayed phase. Secondary endpoints were the CR rate in the acute phase and the overall phase (0–120 h); the rates of complete control (CC; no emetic episodes, no use of rescue medications, and no or only mild nausea) and total control (TC; no emetic episodes, no use of rescue medications, and no nausea); and the time to treatment failure (TTF; time to first emetic episode or use of rescue medication).
Patients filled out a diary covering the period from the start of cisplatin treatment on day 1 to day 6 after the start of chemotherapy, in which they documented for each 24-h interval the time of onset and the number of emetic episodes, the presence of nausea and its severity classification on a four-grade scale (none, mild, moderate, or severe), and use of rescue medication. An emetic episode was defined as one or more connected attacks of vomiting or retching. The patients also assessed the severity of somnolence by using a visual analog scale (VAS). The VAS for somnolence ranged from “Not sleepy at all” on the left (0 mm) to “Very sleepy” on the right (100 mm). To obtain baseline data, assessment was also performed before the start of chemotherapy.
Physical examination, safety evaluations, and laboratory tests were performed before the initiation of treatment and laboratory tests were performed again between day 6 and day 8. Adverse events were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0 (CTCAE version 4.0).
Statistical analysis
The primary objective of this study was to determine which dose (olanzapine 10 or 5 mg) is more suitable for a further phase III trial. A delayed phase CR rate of 65% was considered to be unacceptable based on the result of a previous study [ ]. Assuming the primary endpoint would be 75% with olanzapine and the threshold value would be 65%, 72 patients per arm provided a power of over 75%, using a one-sided binomial test with a normal approximation at a 10% level of significance. A dropout rate of 3% was allowed; thus, a total sample size of 150 patients was required for the study. An interim analysis was to be performed after half of the total number of patients has been registered [ ]. A Bayesian predictive power to assess the futility of the primary hypothesis test for the olanzapine 10 mg arm was calculated [ ]. If the Bayesian predictive power is < 1%, the study was to be discontinued. As a result, a stopping boundary was not crossed at the interim analysis.
The analyses for the efficacy endpoints were based on the intention-to-treat principle without imputing missing observations. The primary endpoint was analyzed by using a closed testing procedure to address multiplicity. The analysis was performed the following steps. In Step 1, a binomial test was performed to assess the CR in the 10 mg arm, and in Step 2, a binomial test was performed to assess the CR in the 5 mg arm. Step 2 was only to be performed if Step 1 yielded a significant result. If significant improvement of the CR rate was only observed with 10 mg arm, this dose was to be selected for the subsequent study. If significant improvement was observed with both doses, the recommended phase III dose was to be selected by comparing the incidence of adverse events.
For the secondary analysis, the proportions of CC and TC were estimated, and exact 80% confidence intervals were calculated with the use of a binomial distribution. TTF was analyzed by using the Kaplan–Meier method, and 80% confidence intervals were calculated. A linear mixed-effects model was used for changes from the baseline VAS for somnolence to evaluate trends over time. Time and treatment were included as fixed effects, and intercept terms were included as random effects. Compound symmetry correlation structure was used to account for within-subject correlation over time. All analyses were planned prior to un-blinding the data, except the analysis of the VAS for somnolence. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS software version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, N.C., USA).
Results
Patients
Between July 2014 and March 2015, 153 patients were enrolled; 76 and 77 patients were randomly assigned to either 10 or 5 mg olanzapine (Fig. 1 ). One patient in the 10 mg olanzapine group was considered to be ineligible for the safety analysis because the study treatment was not administered; accordingly, 152 patients (75 in the 10 mg group and 77 in the 5 mg group) were assessed for safety. The demographic characteristics in the intention-to-treat population were well balanced between the 10 and 5 mg olanzapine group (Table 1 ). Fig. 1 CONSORT flow diagram.

Efficacy
The CR rate in the delayed phase was 77.6% (80% CI, 70.3–83.8, P = 0.01) for the 10 mg olanzapine group and 85.7% (80% CI, 79.2–90.7, P < 0.001) for the 5 mg olanzapine group ( P value for H 0 : complete response rate ≤ 65% of historical control) (Table 2 ). The percentages of patients in both groups who achieved a CR in the acute phase and overall phase are shown in Table 3 . The CR rate in the acute phase was 100% (80% CI, 97.0–100) and 98.7% (80% CI, 95.0–99.9) in the 10 mg and 5 mg olanzapine groups, respectively. In addition, the overall CR rate was 77.6% (80% CI, 70.3–83.8) and 85.7% (80% CI, 79.2–90.7), respectively. The results for the other secondary endpoints are provided in Table 3 . The overall TC rate was 59.2% (80% CI, 51.2–66.8) in the 10 mg olanzapine group and 62.3% (80% CI, 54.4–69.7) in the 5 mg olanzapine group. Kaplan–Meier analysis of the time to the first emetic episode or use of rescue medication in the intention-to-treat population demonstrated that the median time to treatment failure was > 120 h in both groups (Fig. 2 ). The most common time for failure of CR after cisplatin administration was from 72 to 96 h in the delayed phase (Fig. 2 ).

Safety
Treatment-related adverse events that occurred in at least 2% of the patients in either group are shown in Table 4 . The most common treatment-related adverse event was somnolence (53.3% in the 10 mg group and 45.5% in the 5 mg group), which was followed in frequency terms by constipation (16.0% in the 10 mg group and 19.5% in the 5 mg group). The incidence of hyperglycemia was 4.1% in the 10 mg group and 5.2% in the 5 mg group, while dry mouth occurred in 6.7% and 1.3% patients, respectively. Grade 3 adverse events were observed in three patients within the 10 mg group (constipation in two and hyponatremia in one), and two patients in the 5 mg group (constipation and hyponatremia in one each). There were no adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation. Figure 3 shows the estimated value and 80% confidence interval of the change in the VAS for somnolence as assessed by each patient in the ITT population.

Discussion
In this randomized, phase II study, a satisfactory antiemetic effect was demonstrated when olanzapine was administered in combination with a standard three-drug antiemetic regimen. The CR rate in the delayed phase was 77.6% (80% CI: 70.3–83.8, P = 0.01) in the 10 mg group and 85.7% (80% CI: 79.2–90.7, P < 0.001) in the 5 mg group ( P value for H 0 : complete response rate ≤ 65%). Both doses of 10 and 5 mg olanzapine met the primary endpoint, indicating that the addition of 10 or 5 mg olanzapine to standard three-drug antiemetic regimen could reduce delayed emesis.
Passik et al. performed a phase I study to investigate the maximum tolerated dose of olanzapine for the prevention of CINV [ ]. They concluded that the maximum tolerated dose was 5 mg (for days -2 and -1) and 10 mg (for days 0–7), and reported that the dose-limiting toxicity was grade 3 sedation. Based on these results, Navari et al. conducted phase II and III studies that investigated the antiemetic effect of 10 mg olanzapine [ , , , ]. In the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for antiemetic therapy (first version, 2014), 10 mg is also the dose of olanzapine recommended for treatment of emesis [ ]. However, a phase III trial of 10 mg olanzapine showed that somnolence remains a matter of serious concern in 73% of patients [ ]. In addition, the 2016 Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) and European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines on antiemetic therapy call attention to mild/moderate sedation in patients receiving 10 mg of olanzapine [ ].
When we started this study, there had been no reports concerning the effect of adding olanzapine to a standard three-drug antiemetic regimen. Therefore, the aim of this phase II study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of olanzapine (10 and 5 mg) in combination with a standard three-drug antiemetic regimen. This study demonstrated for the first time that the antiemetic effect of 5 mg of olanzapine was comparable to that of the 10 mg dose.
Before performing this study of olanzapine, there was concern about somnolence and sedation as adverse reactions due to the antagonistic effect of this drug on the H 1 receptor. The timing of olanzapine administration was not described in a previous phase III trial of 10 mg olanzapine [ , ]. As somnolence tends to occur around the time of maximum concentration of olanzapine (Tmax) in the blood, we scheduled its administration after supper. Our study showed that the incidence of somnolence was 53.3 and 45.5% in the 10 and 5 mg olanzapine groups, respectively. Moreover, assessment of the evaluations made by each patient revealed that the change of the VAS was higher in the 10 mg olanzapine group than in the 5 mg group, especially when the initial evaluation was made at 24 h after administration of olanzapine. The change of the VAS for somnolence showed a reduced difference between the 10 and 5 mg olanzapine groups over time, and there was little difference between the two groups at 96 and 120 h after the final dose of this drug, which was presumably related to the last dose of olanzapine being administered after supper on day 4.
Among other adverse reactions to olanzapine, hyperglycemia occurred in 4.1 and 5.2% of the 10 and 5 mg olanzapine groups, respectively; moreover, there were no patients with grade 2 or worse hyperglycemia. According to data from the TRIPLE study, the incidence of hyperglycemia was 4.6% in the palonosetron arm (aprepitant, dexamethasone, and palonosetron), suggesting that administration of olanzapine on days 1–4 may have had no appreciable effect on blood glucose level in the present study.
Contemporaneously with our study, Navari et al. conducted a phase III investigation of the effect of adding 10 mg of olanzapine (days 1 through 4) to standard antiemetic therapy (aprepitant or fosaprepitant combined with a 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 receptor antagonist and dexamethasone) [ ]. Although emesis was well controlled by 10 mg of olanzapine, they found that sedation was a problematic adverse reaction on day 2 (severe in 5%), and they suggested that it was necessary to assess the effect of 5 mg of olanzapine in the future. Our present study provided useful information about the additive antiemetic effect and safety of olanzapine at doses of 10 and 5 mg. The NCCN guidelines for antiemetic therapy (first version, 2017) state that physicians should “consider a dose of 5 mg if the previously administered 10 mg dose caused excessive sedation. Data suggest that sedation is most notable on day 2 and improves over time.” [ ] This is actually quoted from our report published at the ASCO Annual Meeting in 2016 [ ].
The chief limitation of the present study was its design, i.e., the antiemetic effect of olanzapine (10 and 5 mg) combined with current standard three-drug therapy was not directly compared with that of standard therapy alone, but instead was compared with data obtained from a historical control study (TRIPLE study) [ ]. Although the key eligibility criteria of this study was the same as the TRIPLE study, the sample size differed between two studies (153 patients from 6 sites in this study vs. 842 patients from 20 sites in the TRIPLE study). However, this was a dose-finding study that aimed to determine the optimum dose of olanzapine for use in a subsequent phase III study.
In conclusion, this study demonstrated that addition of olanzapine (10 or 5 mg) to a standard three-drug antiemetic regimen improved the control of CINV. Because the antiemetic effect showed no significant difference between the 10 and 5 mg olanzapine groups, while the incidence of somnolence was lower with 5 mg than 10 mg, we considered that the recommended dose of olanzapine should be 5 mg. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study of standard three-drug antiemetic therapy with or without 5 mg of olanzapine is currently underway in patients receiving HEC (J-FORCE study; UMIN-CTR identification number: UMIN000024676).
