Introduction
Schizophrenia is a psychotic disorder characterized by abnormalities in one or more of the following five aspects: delusions, disorganized thinking (speech), grossly disorganized or abnormal motor behavior (including catatonia), hallucinations, and negative symptoms [ ]. Its median estimate of lifetime prevalence is approximately 0.5%, worldwide [ ]. The characteristic symptoms of schizophrenia affect the quality of life of the patients and their families. Recent estimates indicate that the burden of the disease continues to increase and leads to important disability in several aspects of the individual’s personal, social, and occupational functioning [ ]. The factors contributing to this disability include the high relapse rate, disease chronicity, and stigma [ ]. Furthermore, people with schizophrenia have a 2.5 times higher risk for premature death, associated with suicide or comorbid somatic conditions [ ].
The treatment of schizophrenia comprises multiple efforts, including the approach by a multidisciplinary team, and often requires the use of antipsychotics, classified into first-generation (typical) or second-generation (atypical) drugs. Typical antipsychotic drugs were developed in the 1950s and are strong dopamine D2 receptor antagonists. As a result of their inadequate therapeutic potential and associated adverse events, principally extrapyramidal side effects (EPSE), novel antipsychotic drugs emerged in the 1980s—the second-generation antipsychotics [ ]. Although they are effective and have a more secure profile for the treatment of movement disorders [ ], these second-generation drugs are associated with higher risk for metabolic disturbances, i.e., weight gain and changes in glucose and cholesterol levels [ ].
Due to the debilitating nature of schizophrenia and the adverse events that may occur during use of antipsychotic drugs and further worsen the patient’s condition, a comparative analysis of the available drug therapies is necessary for the determination of the best options. The optimal method for this comparison is through systematic reviews, which are considered the gold standard of evidence in health care. This type of study involves the application of scientific strategies, in ways that limit bias, for the collection, critical appraisal, and assembly of all studies addressing a specific question. It may also be accompanied by meta-analysis, which uses statistical techniques to combine and synthesize the data from the primary studies into a single quantitative estimate or measure of the effect [ ].
Given the great availability of published systematic reviews with or without meta-analysis, it is a challenge for the health professionals to keep up-to-date. Thus, a new type of study called “overview” has been proposed that evaluates and summarizes the results of the systematic reviews [ ]. To our knowledge, there is no published overview on the use of aripiprazole in schizophrenia. In this sense, this overview aimed to summarize the information presented in systematic reviews with meta-analysis, in order to evaluate the efficacy and safety of aripiprazole, compared with that of placebo or other antipsychotics, for the treatment of schizophrenia.
Methods
The protocol of this overview was registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/ ; registration number, CRD42017068626).
Literature search
A comprehensive literature search was performed in Medline/PubMed, LILACS, the Cochrane Library, and the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD), for articles published until March 31, 2017. The search strategy included the use of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms or text words related to the health condition (schizophrenia), intervention (aripiprazole), and type of study (systematic review with meta-analysis). The full search strategy of all databases is showed in Appendix 1 . In addition, a search was held within the reference lists of the appraised studies to identify any potential study that could have been missed.
Study selection
After searching the databases, the selection process was performed in three stages: (1) exclusion of repeated records, (2) analysis of the titles and abstracts, and (3) analysis of the full-text articles. The studies were independently selected by two authors (E.L.A.R. and T.M.L.), with any disagreement resolved by a third author (P.M.A.). When the full text could not be obtained, the corresponding authors were contacted by e-mail and/or via ResearchGate ( www.researchgate.net ).
To be included in this overview, the articles had to meet the following criteria: (1) must be a systematic review with meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs); (2) must be published in English, Portuguese, or Spanish; (3) must have evaluated the effect of aripiprazole, in comparison with placebo or other antipsychotic drugs; (4) must report the outcomes of interest for efficacy and/or safety; and (5) must include patients with schizophrenia or other types of schizophrenia-like psychoses (e.g., schizophreniform and schizoaffective disorders). Articles were excluded if being reviews without a clear search strategy; systematic reviews without meta-analysis; updated systematic reviews (only the last version was considered); meta-analyses not from systematic reviews; or systematic reviews with meta-analysis that included another target population, intervention, or primary study designs.
The efficacy of the antipsychotic therapy was evaluated according to the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), used for measuring symptom severity in patients with schizophrenia [ ]. This scale involves 30 items that are commonly aggregated into three subscales (positive, negative, and general psychopathology), each including several specific symptoms. High scores indicate greater disease severity. For the evaluation of safety outcome measures, we considered EPSE (such as general EPSE, anxiety, agitation, akathisia, dystonia, and parkinsonism) along with metabolic changes (such as weight gain and changes in glucose and cholesterol levels). These safety outcomes were selected for analysis, since the increased occurrence of EPSE is principally related to typical antipsychotics, and metabolic changes are associated with atypical antipsychotics.
Data extraction
Data extraction was performed by two independent researchers (E.L.A.R. and T.M.L.), and any disagreement was resolved by a third author (P.M.A.). The following information was collected on a spreadsheet preformatted in Microsoft Excel®: author(s) and year of publication, literature search, target population, number of RCTs and patients included in the meta-analysis, intervention, comparators, outcome measures, effect size, heterogeneity or inconsistency, and funding source.
Quality assessment
The quality of evidence for the outcomes of interest was evaluated by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach [ ]. The quality of evidence is classified into four levels: high, moderate, low, and very low (indicates confidence in effect estimate) and the quality of evidence starts as high when RCTs are analyzed. The risk of bias (i.e., methodological limitations), publication bias, indirectness, imprecision, and inconsistency are factors responsible for reducing the level of evidence of the outcome. Network meta-analyses were evaluated, considering the adjustments proposed by Salanti et al., 2014 [ ]. The evidence profile was established from an explicit judgment of each of these factors using GRADEpro computer software ( https://gradepro.org/ ). Two authors (E.L.A.R. and T.M.L.) used this tool independently, and any disagreement was resolved by a third author (P.M.A.).
The ROBIS tool (phases 2 and 3) was used to assess the risk of bias in systematic reviews. Specifically, it addresses the degree to which the review methods minimized the risk of bias in the effect estimates and conclusion of systematic reviews. Phase 2 covers four domains through which bias may be introduced into a systematic review: eligibility criteria, identification and selection of studies, data collection and study appraisal, and synthesis and findings. Phase 3 assesses the overall risk of bias in the interpretation of review findings. Risk of bias in each phase is judged as “low,” “high,” or “unclear” [ ]. One author (T.M.L.) conducted the evaluation of the studies, and a second one (P.M.A.) verified this evaluation.
Data synthesis
The characteristics of systematic reviews, and the quality of evidence and their risk of bias, were descriptively summarized using systematically structured tables. The estimates of effect size from meta-analyses (and their 95% confidence intervals [95% CI]) were expressed as mean difference (MD), standardized mean difference (SMD), odds ratio (OR), relative risk (RR), or event rate (ER), depending on what the authors had reported.

Search results
A total of 185 potentially relevant records were collected upon database searching (Fig. 1 ). After removing duplicates and screening titles and abstracts, 159 records were excluded. The remaining 26 records were selected for full-text examination, of which 14 systematic reviews with meta-analysis on aripiprazole for the treatment of schizophrenia fully met the eligibility criteria and were included in the overview [ , , , , , , , , , , , , , ]. The excluded studies, and the reasons for their exclusion, are detailed in Appendix 2 . The dataset with the full selection process of the systematic reviews is shown in Appendix 3 . All included systematic reviews were published in English between 2008 and 2017. Fig. 1 Study selection flowchart through literature search. RCT, randomized controlled trials
Characteristics of the included systematic reviews
Characteristics of the 14 studies included in this overview are shown in Table 1 . Most studies included patients of any age [ , , , , , , , , ] and the rest included only patients above 18 years [ , , , , ]. Most systematic reviews used the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition; DSM-IV) and the tenth revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10), as diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders (schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform disorder, or delusional disorder).

Direct evidence was principally used for the comparison between aripiprazole and other interventions. However, some studies used indirect evidence, based on the Bucher’s method of adjusted indirect comparison [ ] and Bayesian network meta-analysis [ , , , ]. Olanzapine [ , , , , , , , ] and risperidone [ , , , , , ] were the antipsychotics compared to aripiprazole, in most cases. Other common comparators were placebo, haloperidol, ziprasidone, quetiapine, clozapine, and amisulpride.
Seven studies assessed efficacy outcomes, according to the PANSS criteria [ , , , , , , ], while 12 studies assessed safety outcomes concerning EPSE and metabolic changes. Anxiety [ , , , , ], agitation [ , , , ], akathisia [ , , , , ], dystonia [ ], parkinsonism [ ], and use of antiparkinsonian medication [ , , , ] were reported as EPSE. Relating to metabolic changes, weight gain [ , , , , , , , , ], blood glucose [ , ], and cholesterol levels [ , ] were reported.
Most reviews [ , , , , , , , , ] received research funding from governments, universities, research healthcare centers, public health systems, or national institutes. Two studies received research funding from the industry [ , ], two did not report a source of support [ , ], and one declared no support from any organization [ ].
Results on efficacy
PANSS
Aripiprazole-based therapy presented significant reduction in total PANSS (very low quality), positive PANSS (moderate quality), and negative PANSS (low quality) upon direct comparison to placebo [ ] (Table 2 ). In addition, mixed comparison showed a significant reduction in total PANSS compared to that resulting from placebo (low quality) [ ]. Regarding atypical antipsychotics, aripiprazole showed a less significant reduction in total PANSS compared to that induced by olanzapine (moderate quality) and amisulpride (very low quality) [ , , ]. However, the results from the comparison between aripiprazole and risperidone or paliperidone were inconsistent, since the different inclusion criteria adopted in the studies [ , ]. In contrast, aripiprazole was significantly superior than risperidone in reducing the negative PANSS upon short-term use (moderate quality) [ ]. Aripiprazole did not show a significant benefit over typical antipsychotic drugs [ , ].

Weight gain
Weight gain was evaluated either as a continuous (magnitude of the body weight increase) and/or as a dichotomous measure (increase ≥ 7.0% of the body weight) (Table 3 ). All systematic reviews on this outcome showed that aripiprazole significantly induced weight gain (dichotomous and continuous measure), compared with placebo (very low or low quality). As an exception, Oya et al. [ ] did not show any significant difference by a direct comparison of intramuscular aripiprazole to placebo (dichotomous measure). About atypical antipsychotic drugs, aripiprazole induced weight gain to a significantly lower extent than did clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine (very low or moderate quality) (dichotomous measure) [ , ] and most atypical antipsychotics (continuous measure) [ , , ], with the exceptions of lurasidone, ziprasidone, amilsupride, and asenapine [ ]. It is worth noting that the findings were inconsistent among the studies comparing aripiprazole’s and risperidone’s effect on body weight increase, since Rummel-Kluge et al. [ ] did not present significant differences in their results. Besides, aripiprazole did not induce significant changes in body weight gain compared to typical antipsychotics [ , ].

Changes in glucose and cholesterol levels
All systematic reviews on this outcome showed that aripiprazole significantly reduced the increase in blood glucose levels [ ] or induced the increase in blood glucose to a significantly lower extent than did risperidone, clozapine, and olanzapine (low or moderate quality evidence) [ , ]. Furthermore, aripiprazole induced an increase in cholesterol levels to a significantly lower extent than did olanzapine (low or moderate quality evidence) [ , ] (Table 3 ).
General extrapyramidal side effects
Regarding general EPSE, the results from the comparison of aripiprazole to placebo were inconsistent. Direct comparisons did not provide significant results [ , ], while indirect comparisons showed that aripiprazole significantly increased general EPSE [ , ]. These results presented very low or low quality evidence. One systematic review [ ] reported a significant difference in favor of aripiprazole, compared to risperidone (moderate quality). No significant difference was found in the general EPSE caused by aripiprazole and other atypical antipsychotics [ , ]. On the other hand, aripiprazole induced general EPSE to a significantly lower extent than did typical antipsychotic drugs (moderate quality evidence) [ ] (Table 4 ).

Akathisia and dystonia
Two studies [ , ] reported that aripiprazole increased the risk of akathisia to a significantly greater extent than did placebo (low quality), as can be seen in Table 4 . However, Oya et al. [ ] did not observe significant differences in the comparison between intramuscular aripiprazole and placebo (very low quality). In addition, Khanna et al. [ ] reported that aripiprazole increased the risk of akathisia to a significantly lower extent than did risperidone (moderate quality evidence), but the risk was similar to that associated with other atypical antipsychotics. Thomas et al. [ ] showed that aripiprazole increased significantly the occurrence of akathisia, compared with olanzapine, ziprasidone, and risperidone (moderate quality evidence). On the other hand, aripiprazole was associated with a significantly lower risk of akathisia than were typical antipsychotics (low quality evidence) [ ]. For dystonia, Khanna et al. [ ] showed that aripiprazole caused this effect to a significantly greater extent than did risperidone (moderate quality) and to a significantly lower extent than did clozapine (low quality) [ ]. No significant difference was reported between oral and intramuscular aripiprazole administration in regard to the induction of akathisia and dystonia (very low quality) [ ].
Agitation and anxiety
Belgamwar et al. [ ] reported a significant difference in favor of aripiprazole on the risk of agitation, compared to placebo (low quality evidence). Nevertheless, three studies [ , , ] did not show significant differences upon comparison of aripiprazole to typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs. Two systematic reviews showed no significant difference between aripiprazole and placebo or typical antipsychotics, for the occurrence of anxiety [ , ]. About atypical antipsychotics, Khanna et al. [ ] reported that aripiprazole induced anxiety to a significantly greater extent than did risperidone and clozapine (low quality). No significant difference was detected between the risk of agitation associated with aripiprazole and other atypical antipsychotic drugs [ , ] (Table 4 ).
Parkinsonism and the use of antiparkinsonian medication
As can be seen in Table 4 , Khanna et al. [ ] reported no significant difference between aripiprazole and olanzapine in the induction of parkinsonism. About the use of antiparkinsonian medication, two reviews [ , ] found no significant difference, when comparing aripiprazole to placebo administration. Compared to risperidone, lurasidone, and zotepine, aripiprazole significantly reduced the use of antiparkinsonian drugs [ ] (moderate quality). On the other hand, aripiprazole significantly increased the use of antiparkinsonian drugs, compared with clozapine (moderate quality) [ ]. Two reviews showed that aripiprazole was associated with the use of antiparkinsonian medication to a significantly lower extent than were atypical antipsychotics (moderate quality evidence) [ , ].
Risk of bias in systematic reviews
The assessment of the risk of bias in systematic reviews based on the ROBIS tool is showed in Table 5 . Domain 1 of phase 2 assessed the specification of eligibility criteria, and ten studies [ , , , , , , , , , ] were characterized as of “low” risk of bias. Studies classified as “unclear” [ ] or “high” [ , , ] risk of bias did not show details of the eligibility criteria, such as specifications and restrictions. Domain 2 assessed the methods used for the identification and selection of studies, and four reviews [ , , , ] reached a “low” risk of bias. Studies classified as having “unclear” [ , , , , ] or “high” [ , , , , ] risk of bias had not reported the complete search strategy, neither the terms used, and had not provided detailed restrictions on the date, format, and language of the incorporated publications. Domain 3 assessed the methods used to collect data and appraise studies, and six reviews [ , , , , , ] achieved a “low” risk of bias. Systematic reviews classified as of “unclear” [ , , , , , ] or “high” [ , ] risk of bias had not presented the quality assessment of the RCTs, using appropriate criteria or failed to minimize the error of this evaluation. Six studies [ , , , , , ] achieved a “low” risk of bias classification in domain 4, which assessed the synthesis and findings. Studies categorized as having “unclear” [ , , , , , ] or “high” [ , ] risk of bias had not provided information on the pre-defined protocol. Phase 3 assessed the overall risk of bias in the systematic reviews, and five studies were classified as “low” risk [ , , , , ], five as “unclear” risk [ , , , , ], and four were categorized as “high” risk of bias [ , , , ].

Discussion
Main findings
The present overview identified 14 systematic reviews with meta-analysis that studied the efficacy and/or safety of aripiprazole for the treatment of schizophrenia. The efficacy of the antipsychotic drugs was evaluated using the PANSS scale, whereas safety was estimated by the reported metabolic changes and EPSE. Despite superior efficacy in total, positive, and negative PANSS, when compared to placebo, aripiprazole’s performance was similar to that of the typical antipsychotics, on these same scales. Among the atypical antipsychotic drugs, aripiprazole was inferior to olanzapine and amisulpride, in total PANSS, and did not show significant differences in comparison to the atypical antipsychotics for positive and negative PANSS. In this sense, if a patient with schizophrenia presents a good clinical response on aripiprazole, the most relevant factor for choosing it would be its safety profile.
While aripiprazole induces body weight gain, it usually causes less weight gain than other atypical drugs (except for lurasidone, ziprasidone, amisulpride, and asenapine) and does not show a significant difference in relation to typical antipsychotics. Given that weight gain is multifactorial in patients with schizophrenia, aripiprazole has the benefit of causing less weight gain within its class (atypical drugs), and its effects are similar to those of typical antipsychotics. Weight gain is an adverse event that increases mortality, produces somatic sequelae, and jeopardizes medication adherence, as well as stigmatization and deterioration in quality of life [ ]. In this sense, aripiprazole could be a valuable option for patients prone to weight gain.
Regarding the metabolic changes caused by atypical antipsychotics, aripiprazole was the one that caused the lowest increase in blood glucose and cholesterol levels. Schizophrenia is a risk factor for glucose intolerance and for the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus [ , ]. Consequently, individuals with schizophrenia who need antipsychotic drug treatment and bear other risk factors for diabetes (i.e., genetic and environmental predisposition) could benefit from the use of aripiprazole. In addition, high cholesterol levels contribute substantially to the development of coronary artery disease [ ]; thus, aripiprazole may be the drug-of-choice for schizophrenic patients with high cardiovascular risk.
EPSE are attributed to dopaminergic block in certain brain areas. Therefore, the first-generation (typical) antipsychotics are associated with an elevated risk of EPSE, since their main mechanism of action is the dopamine receptor blockade. This risk is usually higher than that of atypical antipsychotics, sharing other mechanisms of action beyond dopaminergic block [ , ]. In this overview, aripiprazole was shown to cause less general EPSE, compared to typical antipsychotics, and exhibited no significant difference in relation to the other atypical drugs.
Akathisia is described by motor restlessness, accompanied by the subjective feeling of inner tension and discomfort, principally of the upper and lower limbs. It may coexist with parkinsonism; however, it can be more common, and its symptoms more distressing, leading to poor medication adherence [ ]. In contrast, acute dystonia is a sustained condition of abnormal postures or muscle spasms, developed within 7 days after the initiation of treatment. The drug-induced acute dystonia is considered secondary and usually occurs after the use of anti-dopaminergic drugs, such as antipsychotics [ , ]. The findings of our overview indicate that aripiprazole causes akathisia in fewer cases than do typical antipsychotics and risperidone and dystonia in fewer cases than does risperidone. Nevertheless, dystonia was caused by aripiprazole in more cases than by clozapine. Given the debilitating nature of akathisia and dystonia, the related high risk of poor medication adherence, and the difficulty of managing treatment-related adverse events, aripiprazole appears as an alternative associated with a low risk of EPSE.
Drug-induced parkinsonism is a condition that includes the presence of resting tremor, muscular rigidity, akinesia, or bradykinesia, developing within few weeks after starting or raising the dosage of a medication, typically neuroleptic [ ]. Therefore, individuals with schizophrenia bearing risk factors for parkinsonism—e.g., elderly, females, with familial predisposition, severe unexplained hyposmia, concomitant brain damage and atrophy, dementia, and high dose of inducing medication [ ]—should choose drugs that do not target dopamine receptors or do not induce parkinsonism. Current evidence shows that patients taking aripiprazole require antiparkinsonian medication to a lesser degree than do those taking typical drugs and most other atypical antipsychotics, with the exception of clozapine.
Aripiprazole showed no significant difference about anxiety and agitation, compared to typical antipsychotic drugs or regarding agitation, compared to atypical antipsychotics. In contrast, aripiprazole was shown to cause anxiety to a significantly greater extent than did clozapine and risperidone. Negative symptoms are a major problem in schizophrenia, since they directly affect the patient’s quality of life and participation in the society. Primary negative symptoms are intrinsic to schizophrenia, while secondary negative symptoms occur in association with, or presumably are caused by positive symptoms, affective symptoms, medication adverse effects, environmental deprivation, or other treatment- and disease-related factors [ ]. Given that anxiety is a relevant source of secondary negative symptoms [ ], its control is essential for the improvement of the patient’s quality of life.
Risk of bias in systematic reviews
According to our knowledge, this is the first schizophrenia-based study to apply the ROBIS tool to evaluate the risk of bias in systematic reviews. The ROBIS tool was chosen for quality assessment of the systematic reviews because it was recently published, have fair reliability and good construct validity, and requires a more detailed assessment of the methodology employed for the systematic review [ , , ]. Although AMSTAR tool is widely used and has showed acceptable reliability and validity [ ], studies have reported limitations related to the interpretation of the items and their instructions [ , ]. In addition, there is overlap in the items considered by ROBIS and AMSTAR and a strong correlation between both tools [ , ]. Most reviews (nine studies), included in this overview, were characterized as having “unclear” or “high” risk of bias. Many studies did not detail the eligibility criteria (prior protocol), did not report the complete search strategy, and did not assess the quality of the RCTs, using appropriate criteria. Importantly, domain 4 in phase 2 is an easy tool for the evaluation of direct evidence in systematic reviews with meta-analysis. However, for indirect or mixed comparisons, there is little guidance in the ROBIS tool on how to classify systematic reviews on study variability (heterogeneity) and robustness of the data (sensitivity analysis). In addition, important aspects in indirect or mixed comparison are not addressed in this tool, such as the principle of transitivity and inconsistency.
Opportunities for future research
Most systematic reviews, included in this overview, involved hospitalized patients with schizophrenia or related well-defined disorders, with limited physical and psychical comorbidities. However, this population is minority in everyday life of the medical clinic, since most patients are not hospitalized, have other associated pathologies (e.g., substance abuse and depression), and use other concomitant medications [ ], which may affect the effectiveness of pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia. In addition, most studies evaluated short-term treatment (usually up to 12 weeks), making difficult the understanding of the long-term efficacy and of the safety profile of aripiprazole—patients with schizophrenia usually require prolonged pharmacotherapy. In addition, most studies included in the overview were classified as having “high” or “unclear” risk of bias, according to the ROBIS tool. Many reviews did not detail eligibility criteria (prior protocol), complete search strategy to be replicated, and did not assess the quality of primary studies.
Given the debilitating nature of schizophrenia—affecting not only the patient but also the family—pharmacotherapy needs to be better studied and documented through RCTs of high methodological quality, with reduced risk of bias, including a larger number and diversity of patients, and with a longer follow-up period. Thus, it is expected that new and more robust scientific evidence will be available to health professionals and guide improved decision-making.
Limitations of the overview
The present overview has some limitations. Firstly, the risk of bias in the GRADE approach was judged based on the risk assessment of original trials made by the review authors. In addition, the exclusion of three potential systematic reviews due to failure in obtaining the full-text articles—even though they were requested from the corresponding author via ResearchGate and/or by e-mail—may have generated publication bias. Also, we did not search unpublished reviews, either in thesis repositories or in proceedings of scientific events. Furthermore, our a priori decision to exclude reviews not presenting a meta-analysis might have led to the exclusion of important reviews on this theme, because in some cases statistical pooling was not appropriate. We could not conduct a quantitative analysis owing to the heterogeneity of populations, interventions, and outcomes in the included reviews.
Conclusion
The findings of this overview showed that aripiprazole is effective for the reduction in the total PANSS and has efficacy similar to that of typical and atypical (with the exception of olanzapine and amisulpride) antipsychotics. Given the high occurrence of metabolic effects among atypical antipsychotics, aripiprazole—in spite of provoking them—is related to lower weight gain and lower change in glucose and cholesterol levels, compared to clozapine, risperidone, or olanzapine. Although typical antipsychotics do not usually cause metabolic effects, they tend to cause movement disorders. Aripiprazole caused less general EPSE, need for antiparkinsonian medication, and akathisia, compared to typical antipsychotic drugs and risperidone. On the other hand, it caused more anxiety than that caused by risperidone, in addition to more dystonia, anxiety, and need for antiparkinsonian medication than did clozapine. Therefore, individuals with a good clinical response to aripiprazole and with predisposition for certain EPSE, weight gain, hyperglycemia, or hyperlipidemia may be the main beneficiaries of this therapy. However, it is important to note that these results were based mostly on “low” or “very low” quality evidence and were derived from systematic reviews mostly with “high” or “unclear” risk of bias.
