Introduction
Among agricultural pesticides, organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) have been demonstrated to cause several adverse effects to the environment and to human health. OCPs (such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane [DDT], hexachlorocyclohexane [HCH] and dieldrin) are persistent organic pollutants (POPs), because of their high persistence in the environment: their high lipophilicity, bioaccumulation, and long half-life increased the chances of human toxic effects in those rural areas where high-output agricultural production has led to environmental contamination. Although OCPs have been banned in most developed countries, they are still used in some developing countries of Asia, because of their low cost [ , , ].
The Republic of Kazakhstan is a region where cotton agriculture and textile industry are important resources for the local economy. This industry is concentrated in the south part of the country and, importantly, most workers are females. OCPs have been widely used in cotton growing for long time; currently, many of these pesticides have been banned in the Republic of Kazakhstan since 2004 [ , ]. However, in Kazakhstan, there are still some stocks of POPs-containing pesticides and equipment, and the local population has been using containers, where pesticides have been held, to store food or water [ ]. Moreover, as mentioned previously, OCPs persist in the environment for long time and enter in tubers, roots and several crops, in addition to contaminating the groundwater [ ].
OCPs can be responsible of several health-related problems in humans, including endocrine diseases. By acting as endocrine disruptors, OCPs can alter thyroid function and have been reported to be associated with several types of hormone-related cancers (e.g., breast, prostate); moreover, several studies analyzed the negative effect of OCPs on the reproductive system during adulthood and, recently, also in adolescents [ , , ]. In addition to endocrine negative consequences, some articles described the detrimental effects of pesticides on several aspects of the immune system function, but a few studies focused on the immunologic consequences of OCPs exposure and, in particular, their relationship with the reproductive system. Some and prevalently dated studies suggested that OCPs might affect the production of different inflammatory cytokines, which may contribute to the development of several metabolic diseases and endocrine disorders, including delayed puberty, which is a frequent finding in children affected by inflammatory chronic illnesses [ , , , ].
Previously, we described a correlation between the concentration of OCPs and delayed puberty, sexual hormonal axis and the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), respectively, in female adolescents living in contaminated rural areas of South Kazakhstan [ ].
A very recent research suggested that the homeostasis of IL-1 axis may be altered by OCPs [ ]. In this article, we provide some interesting data on this specific immunological aspect in our cohort of OCP-exposed female adolescents.
Materials and methods
Patients
This observational cross-sectional study examined 524 female adolescents aged 10–17 years. They were divided into 2 groups according to their place of residence. The first (OCPs exposed) group included 253 females who were from a rural area of South Kazakhstan (exactly, Sary-Agach District), where those pesticides were widely used to grow cotton. The second (OCPs unexposed) group, serving as controls, included 271 females living in Sairam District, where animal husbandry was the main economic activity and, thus, systematic use of OCPs has been never implemented. Due to the geographic proximity, the climatic setting was identical; also, social and welfare conditions (low-middle income deriving from rural activities) were comparable, according to the information collection during the medical evaluation.
Somatic and gynecological records were obtained for all patients; the clinical study included the evaluation of physical and sexual development. The physical development of females was assessed by measuring the main anthropomorphic indicators (including weight, height, etc.); the sexual development was assessed based on the secondary sexual characteristics, according to Tanner method (modified by Tumilovich). It was expressed through the formula of Ma (mammary gland), P (pubic hair growth), Ax (axilla hair growth), and Me (menstrual function). The maximum sexual development score (SDS)—12 points—corresponds to compete sexual development and regular menstrual cycle with the Ma 3 , P 3 Ax 3 formula. In order to obtain an objective evaluation, two physicians concomitantly assessed the pubertal development in each patient.
The evaluation of pelvic organs was obtained by trans-abdominal ultrasonography; the patients with menstrual cycle underwent the exam on day 3–7 after the menses. Patients with comorbid conditions and/or family history of puberty disorders were excluded.
This research was approved by the Ethic Committee of the Akhmed Yasawi International Kazakh - Turkish University. Informed consent was obtained by each patient (and guardian) included in this study.
Laboratory analyses
Blood samples for hormonal analyses were obtained on the third to the seventh day of the menstrual cycle, at 10 a.m. in fasting state or on any day for non-menstruating females. Gonadotropic hormones (follicle-stimulating [FSH], luteinizing [LH]) and Estradiol [E2] were assessed in 89 females in the exposed group and 83 females from the control group, by a radioimmunoassay using Stratec SR300 automatic analyzer system (Stratec Biomedical Systems AG, Germany). Kits and reagents were provided by DLS-10-3700 ACTIVE (USA) and HPL BIOSERV ELISA (Germany).
The concentration of OCPs (Lindane, Dieldrin, DDT, and Endrin) in peripheral blood was assessed in 87 females (47 in the exposed group and 40 in the control group) and was performed by gas-liquid chromatography with Crystal 2000M machine. The concentration of pesticides in the blood was expressed in mg/l. IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-1Ra were investigated in 89 females belonging to the exposed group and 83 females of the control group by ELISA, whose kits and reagents were provided by Vector-Best (Novosibirsk, Russia). Serum samples for OPCs and interleukins analyses were obtained concomitantly to blood draws for hormonal tests. Importantly, at the time of such an assessment, the patients had no concomitant and/or acute illnesses, including infections.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis of obtained data was performed by parametric statistics, with the “Biostat” analysis software package version 5.8.4.3 (AnalystSoft, Canada). Methods of descriptive statistics included the calculation of the arithmetic mean (M) and the mean error of the value (m). The reliability of the difference between the two means was determined with Student’s t test ( t ). A coefficient with a 0.05 significance level or less was considered statistically reliable. The dependence between the studied parameters was determined by the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient. The direct/inverse correlation was assessed as follows: up to ± 0.3: weak; from ± 0.3 to ± 0.7: moderate; from ± 0.7 to ± 1: strong.
Results
Pubertal parameters, hormonal assessment, and OCPs’ blood levels
Overall, the physical and sexual development of OCPs exposed females was significantly delayed compared to control group, according to secondary sexual characteristics, somatic parameters and pelvic organ developments, as previously described [ ]. The main parameters related to clinical and hormonal assessment are summarized in Table 1 . In particular, the levels of gonadotropins (FSH, LH) and estradiol (E2) were significantly impaired in OCPs exposed adolescents, according to three different classes of age (I: 10–12 years; II: 13–14 years; III: 15–17 years). Importantly, we could evidence significant statistical differences between OCPs exposed and unexposed girls in all age classes, as regards the female hormones linked to sexual development.

The measurement of OCPs blood levels confirmed the chronic intoxication in environmental exposed female adolescents from Sary-Agach District of Kazakhstan. Remarkable differences in blood levels (expressed as OCPs exposed girls vs. controls) were found for all four OCPs that we have analyzed, namely lindane (1.8 ± 0.02 mg/dl vs. 0.4 ± 0.04 mg/dl, p < 0.001), diendrin (16.9 ± 0.31 mg/dl vs. 3.1 ± 0.37 mg/dl, p < 0.001), DDT (17.8 ± 0.27 mg/dl vs. 10.9 ± 0.26 mg/dl, p < 0.001) and endrin (3.8 ± 0.09 mg/dl vs. 0.48 ± 0.07 mg/dl, p < 0.001). These results are graphically summarized in Fig. 1 . Interestingly, we could correlate blood levels of all four OCPs with the hormonal status of our cohorts of female adolescents, as showed in Table 2 . In particular, we found a strong negative correlation with E2 plasma levels and a moderate negative correlation with FSH levels, whereas no correlation was evident between blood OCPs and plasma LH.

Interleukin-1 (IL-1) levels in serum and correlation with OCPs exposure
The study of IL-1 immune axis showed a significant increase of IL-1α and IL-1β in girls living in areas with OCPs contamination. Indeed, in OCPs exposed group, serum level of IL-1α was 1.91 ± 0.07 pg/ml (vs. 1.53 ± 0.09 pg/ml in control group, p < 0.05) and the concentration of serum IL-1β was 9.96 ± 0.35 pg/ml (vs. 8.29 ± 0.59 pg/ml in control group, p < 0.01). Moreover, also serum IL-1 RA concentration was evaluated, but no significant differences were found between OCPs exposed and not exposed female adolescents (621.7 ± 38.28 pg/ml vs. 557.4 ± 45.9 pg/ml, p > 0.05). Both IL-1α and IL-1β serum levels showed a moderate direct correlation with blood concentrations of all four OCPs taken in consideration, as summarized in Table 3 .

Discussion
Previously, a correlation between the concentration of OCPs and both growth parameters and the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) was found in female adolescents living in contaminated rural areas of South Kazakhstan. In this article, we focused our attention on the impairment of main hormones regulating the pubertal development in girls, namely FSH, LH, and E2. Those resulted significantly altered in OCPs exposed girls, compared to controls from an uncontaminated area of Kazakhstan [ ]. Importantly, we found a significant negative correlation between blood levels of all four OCPs and plasma levels of both FSH and E2, which are the most important hormonal mediators of the beginning of puberty and the development of secondary sexual characteristics. The fact that no similar correlation was noticed for LH may be due to its circadian rhythm and pulsatile pattern of release. Indeed, the lowest LH plasma concentrations are reached during the daytime (when blood work was performed), whereas FSH levels are more stable during the 24 h and its half-life is longer [ ]. A similar association with delayed pubertal development was described in Russian boys who were exposed to β-hexachlorocylohexane, p.p’-dichlorodiphenyl-dichloroethylene, and haexachlorobenzene, which are other types of OCPs [ , ].
Specifically, here, we investigated the potential relationship between the most powerful inflammatory cytokine, namely IL-1, and OCPs exposure. Indeed, some immunologic and inflammatory factors could modulate the maturation of sexual endocrine axis in several diseases [ ]. IL-1 is a key pro-inflammatory cytokine consisting of two molecular species, IL-1α and IL-1β. IL-1 cytokines bind to different receptors. A first type of receptor (IL-1RI) is constitutively expressed from many cell types, whereas a second type of IL-1 receptor is expressed only after cell activation. The latter receptor lacks a cytoplasmic tail and, thus, it does not result in any intracellular signaling; actually, it is released as soluble “decoy” receptor in competition with the type I receptor. However, a second mechanism that downregulates IL-1 activities is the secretion of IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) [ , ]. In this study, we were able to show a direct correlation between serum levels of both IL-1α and IL-1β and the blood concentrations of OCPs; moreover, such an IL-1 increase was not associated to a similar trend in IL-1Ra levels. That might suggest an overall pro-inflammatory effect of OCPs chronic intoxication, which also correlated with FSH and E2 levels.
Unfortunately, the available data does not allow any discussion about the direct and/or indirect impact of OCPs and IL-1 on the ovarian activity. However, previous researches evidenced that IL-1 may be involved in several ovulation associated events, and may affect ovarian steroidogenesis [ ].
Previously, Imbeault P et al. described a weak but statistically significant association between persistent OCPs exposure and elevated levels of several inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1 [ ]. Very recently, Martin TJ and Whalen MM published the results of their research investigating the effect of two OCPs (pentachlorophenol, PCP; and DDT) on the secretion of IL-1 from human immune cells. Interestingly, they showed that those OCPs were able to stimulate ex vivo the secretion of IL-1β by all immune cells populations that they tested, including NK cells, monocytes, and T cells, although the amplitude of such a response was variable among different donors [ ]. Our data supported those findings and may represent the in vivo counterpart. Exposure to OCPs throughout a period of several years in childhood and adolescence might have implications in future ovarian function and reproductive health, and long-term detrimental effects of OCPs environmental exposure should be a matter of further studies.
In conclusion, although we found differences in hormones involved in reproductive axis and IL-1 levels, between OCPs exposed and control groups of girls, we are not able to ascertain how all these findings might be potential and/or additional factors contributing delayed puberty in OCPs exposed female adolescents. Further research is needed to confirm these initial and interesting findings.
