INTRODUCTION
Developing a new drug involves two main stages, preclinical and clinical, which require a significant amount of resources and time ( , , ). In the preclinical stage, it is necessary to perform simulations of the absorption process to predict the behavior of the drug in the intestine using mathematical models, which seek to obtain the absorbed fraction of the drug based on their physicochemical properties ( , , , ). With the concentration profile obtained after the simulation, it is possible not only to obtain the absorbed fraction of the drug, but also to understand the transport mechanisms involved in the process.
Mathematical models have been rarely used to predict the intestinal absorption of natural extracts ( , , ). Although the study of natural bioactive compounds has increased over the past decades, few studies in the field of phytopharmaceuticals have examined the absorption of these compounds by simulation.
Proanthocyanidins (PAs) are phenolic compounds present in País grapes ( Vitis vinífera L.), which have a potential therapeutic effect in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases, through the inhibition of the angiotensin converting enzyme ( ). However, PAs have low accessibility and bioavailability, due to their high molecular weight and great capacity for reaction with other components of the digestive tract, such as proteins, generating their instability ( ). Currently, it is possible to stabilize these molecules for oral administration through nanoencapsulation ( , ).
Previously, we modeled the concentration profiles and the absorbed fraction of País grape seed extracts in the human small intestine, using a microscopic model that considers the dissolution and absorption processes and the physicochemical parameters of the extract; but these were experimentally determined in water ( ), which is not representative of the gastrointestinal environment.
In the present study, the gastrointestinal digestion of the raw extracts and the PLA nanoparticles loaded with them was modeled under a gastrointestinal simulated ambient condition. In a first stage, physicochemical parameters ( ρ , μ and solubility) and transport ( D and K ) were determined experimentally. Using the measured physicochemical parameters, we developed a mathematical model that considers diffusion and convection to obtain the concentrations profile and the absorbed fraction of the grape extracts and the loaded PLA nanoparticles. The simulation of the intestinal absorption of encapsulated compounds in nanoparticles has been given limited attention ( , ), so this work is a contribution to knowledge in this area.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
Sodium acetate, acetone, acetonitrile, acetic acid, ethanol, hydrochloric acid, orthophosphoric acid, tetrahydrofuran, sodium carbonate, sodium acetate, dichloromethane, saccharose, potassium chloride, ammonium phosphate, methanol, n-hexane, and ammonium sulfate were supplied by Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Additionally, (+)-catechin, (−)-epicatechin, phloroglucinol, and the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). A Millipore Milli-Q (Bedford, MA, USA) water purification system was used to purify the water used in all solutions. Poly(d,l-lactide) (PLA) MW 75,000–120,000 and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) MW 31,000–50,000, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Acetate cellulose membrane of 12 kDa was also purchased (Spectrum Labs, Spectra/Por 2, CA, USA)
PAs Isolation from Grapes
The grapes were harvested a month before commercial ripening in Quillón in the Itata Valley, Bio Bio Region, Chile. The skins and seeds of 400 grapes were manually separated and extracted in Erlenmeyer flasks using 250 mL of acetone and water (2:1, v / v ) for 15 h at 35°C and 250 rpm, in the absence of light to reduce oxidation ( ). The skin and seed extracts were separately filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure and temperature (<35°C) to remove the acetone. Seed extracts were washed 3 times with 50 mL of n-hexane in a separator funnel to remove liposoluble compounds. Finally, both extracts were centrifuged at 2218 g for 5 min, filtered and frozen at −18°C for further purification.
PAs Purification and Characterization
Raw extracts were purified according to size exclusion chromatography using Toyopearl HW-40F resin packed in an Omnifit column (420 × 35 mm, 7 mL/min). The column was equilibrated with ethanol/water (55:45, v / v ) (two column volumes). The skin and seed extracts were separately loaded into the column; the sugars and phenolic acids were removed with ethanol/water (55:45, v /v) (three column volumes). This fraction was discarded and not analyzed. Then, acetone/water (60:40, v / v ) (one column volume) was used to elute the PAs fraction. Acetone present in this fraction was evaporated at reduced pressure and temperature (<35°C), and the extracts were lyophilized separately to yield 2.57 mg/g grape seed and 1.11 mg/g grape skin, which were stored at 4°C for further analysis.
The PAs of each extract were characterized by an acid-catalyzed depolymerization method followed by HPLC detection ( , ) to obtain the mean degree of polymerization (mDP), the average molecular weight (aMW), and the molar composition of extracts. A solution of 0.1 moleq./HCl in methanol containing 50 g/L of phloroglucinol was reacted with the seed and skin extracts (5 g/L) at 50°C for 20 min. Then, the mixture was combined with 5 volumes of aqueous sodium acetate 40 mM, to stop the reaction. The procedure was performed in duplicate for all tested samples. The compounds were detected with an HPLC Merck-Hitachi chromatograph LaChrom L7000 Series, with a gradient pump L-7100, Autosampler L-7200, UV detector L-4250 (wavelength 280 nm) and two Chromolith Performance Series RP-18e columns (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). The mobile phase consisted in Milli-Q water with 1% v / v aqueous acetic acid (mobile phase A) and acetonitrile with 1% v / v acetic acid (mobile phase B) and elution was performed with 3% B for 4 min. The linear gradients used were 3–18% B for 14 min and 80% B for 2 min at a flow rate of 3 mL/min and 30°C. The column was washed with 3% B for 2 min before performing the next injection. To quantify the samples, an external standard of catechin (100 mg of C/L) was used. The extract characterization gave values of mDP, the proportion of their components (C, EC, (−)-epigallocatechin (EGC), (−)-epicatechingallate (ECG), (−)-epicatechin-phloroglucinol (EC-P), (d)-epicatechingallatephloroglucinol (ECG-P), (d) epigallocatechin-phloroglucinol (EGC-P)), yield (>80 g/100 g), and concentration.
The molecular weight distribution of the extracts was determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) ( ). Samples (50 mg) were acetylated with pyridine and acetic anhydride (2 mL, 1:1, v / v ) overnight at room temperature. The solvents were evaporated and the acetylated extracts were dissolved in tetrahydrofuran THF (10–15 mg/mL), and the molecular weight distribution of the extracts was determined with the HPLC (ACME 9000, Young Lin Instrument Co. Ltd., Anyang, Korea) which was equipped with a UV/VIS detector and two PSS SDV gel columns (5 μm, 100 and 500 Å) of 30 cm and a PSS SDV gel pre-column (5 μm) equilibrated at 23°C. Analytes were detected at 254 nm at a flow rate of 1 mL/min of the mobile phase (THF) and with an injection volume of 20 μL. Ten standards of polystyrenes with different molecular weights were used, Mw 162–19,950 Da.
Synthesis of PAs–poly(d,l-lactide) Nanoparticles
Poly(d,l-lactide) (PLA) nanoparticles were prepared by the solvent evaporation method based on Zambaux et al. ( ), with modifications ( ). Fifty milligrams of PLA and dry PAs extract (5 mg) were sonicated (250-sonifier, Branson, USA) at 40% amplitude in 2 mL dichloromethane (DCM) for 30 s at room temperature. Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) (4 mL at 3%, w / v ) was added and again sonicated similarly to form an emulsion. The emulsion was diluted by 0.1% ( w / v ) PVA solution to a final 80-mL solution (0.24% w / v ). The organic solvent (DCM) was evaporated under vacuum using a rotating evaporator. The nanoparticles were separated by centrifugation at 16,500 rpm for 20 min at 10°C and washed twice with distilled water by centrifugation. Simple PLA nanoparticles were prepared according to the same procedure. Saccharose (5 mL) was added as a cryoprotectant at 10% w / v to the pellet and lyophilized using a lyophillizer (Hetodrywinner, Denmark). The lyophilized samples were stored at 2–8°C till further use.
Percentage Entrapment Efficiency, Particle Size, and Zeta Potential
The percentage entrapment efficiency of the PAs-PLA nanoparticles, after the synthesis, was calculated as the difference between the total amount used to prepare the particles and the amount that was found in the supernatant ( ). These amounts were determined by total phenols, obtained by Folin-Ciocalteu assay ( ) of the supernatant using a UV spectrophotometer (Techcomp, UV2300 Spectrophotometer, China) at 765 nm, in milligram gallic acid equivalents. The size distribution, the zeta potential, and the polydispersion index of unloaded and PAs-PLA nanoparticles were performed in a Nanosizer (Zetasizernano Z, Malvern Instruments, UK). 0.2 g of lyophilized particles were resuspended in 5 mL MQ water (pH 7.4) and then homogenized by vortex (Finex vortex, Korea). The particle size distribution was determined through the principle of dynamic light scattering in glass cuvettes. The NPs solution was filtered (1 μm, glass microfiber filters Whatman, UK) to eliminate agglomerates. To measure the zeta potential, 2 mL of the solution were used with cuvettes and folder capillary cells (Malvern, UK).
Density, Viscosity, and Solubility Determination
The density of the grape extracts and PLA nanoparticles was determined ( ). A test tube was gauged by hitting it 10 times against a flat surface, and the mass and volume were measured. The density was obtained with the difference between the weight of the flask containing the sample and vacuum, divided by the volume.
The viscosity of simulated gastrointestinal fluid was based on the standard ADTM D 1795–96, where a viscometer CANNON 200 was used in a thermostatic bath at 25°C and the temperature was regulated by a thermostat JULABO ED, range 0–120°C. Ten milliliters of simulated gastrointestinal fluid were prepared based on Ortega et al. ( ) and transferred to a Cannon-Fenske viscometer. To get the intestinal fluid viscosity, the viscometer was calibrated with Milli-Q water at 25°C based on the methodology described in the standard. The viscosity ( μ ) was determined by the following equation: $$ \mu =7.16\bullet {10}^{-3}\bullet t $$ (1)
The extract solubility was determined by Belscak-Cvitanovic et al. ( ). The grape extracts (0.15 g) were dissolved in 1.5 mL of simulated intestinal fluid, which was a solution of HCl 0.01 M titled with NaHCO 3 (0.1 M to pH 6.5), until the saturation point was reached, at 37°C and under agitation for 30 min. Then, the mixture was centrifuged at 5000x g for 10 min (Heraeus, Biofuge Primo, Germany). The supernatant was dried at 105°C until a constant weight was reached.
Diffusion Coefficient of the Grape Seed Extract and Loaded PLA nanoparticles in Simulated Gastrointestinal Fluid at 37°C
The diffusion coefficient was evaluated using a Franz cell according to Wu et al. ( ). The cell consisted of two compartments, each of which had a useful volume of 14 mL. The upper compartment was agitated by a helix, and the lower compartment was agitated using a magnetic stirrer, each at 70 rpm. The compartments were separated by an acetate cellulose membrane of 12 kDa (Spectrum Labs, Spectra/Por 2, CA, USA). First, stomach simulated digestion was carried out with seed or skin extract (1 g/L) in HCl 0.01 M, pH 2, for 2 h at 37°C. Subsequently, this fluid was deposited in the lower compartment (10 mL), while that in the upper compartment contained simulated intestinal fluid, composed of HCl 0.01 M, titled with NaHCO 3 until reaching pH 6.5. The cell was placed in a thermostatic bath at 37°C. After 180 min, both compartments were emptied, and the total phenol concentration was determined.
The total phenols in each sample were analyzed following the procedure by Jerez et al. ( ). First, 2.5 mL of Folin-Ciocalteu reagent were diluted with 2 mL of 7.5% w / v sodium carbonate solution and 0.5 mL of the sample. Then, the solution was heated for 13 min at 45°C, and the mixture absorbance was measured at 765 nm (Techcomp spectrophotometer, UV-2300, China). The total phenol concentration was expressed in units of milligram equivalent catechin/cubic centimeter using Eq. ( 2 ). $$ {F}_{\mathrm{t}}={f}_{\mathrm{c}}\cdot {A}_{\mathrm{bs}}\cdot {D}_{\mathrm{i}} $$ (2)
where A bs is the sample absorbance; D i is the sample dissolution, which in this case is 10; f c is an equivalence factor, which in this case is 79.34 mg eq. catechin/L; and F t is the concentration of total phenols in milligram equivalent catechin/liter.
To determine the diffusion coefficient of the extract-loaded nanoparticles, a solution containing the nanoparticles in an equivalent extract concentration (1 g/L) was prepared and the two coefficients were compared.
The diffusion coefficient was calculated using Eq. ( 3 ) ( ). $$ D=\frac{1}{Bt}1\mathrm{n}\left[\frac{C_{1,0}-{C}_{2,0}}{C_1-{C}_2}\right] $$ (3)
where B is the cell constant in cm −2 , C 1,0 is the initial concentration in the upper compartment, C 2,0 is the initial concentration in the lower compartment, C 1 is the concentration at time t in the upper compartment, and C 2 is the concentration at time t in the lower compartment. All concentrations are in units of milligram equivalent catechin/cubic centimeter, and t is the time in seconds.
The cell was calibrated with 0.1 mol/L of potassium chloride at 37°C, resulting in a value of 6.05 ± 0.03 cm −2 for the cell constant, B . To validate the cell, diffusion coefficient measurements of KCl were made at 25°C at concentrations of 0.01, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 1 mol/L, and the results were compared with those reported in the literature ( ), showing a relative error of less than 8%.
Global Mass Transfer Coefficient (K) of the Grape Extracts and Loaded PLA nanoparticles Simulating the Pass from the Intestine to the Blood
The global mass transfer coefficients of the grape seed and skin extracts and of the extract-loaded PLA nanoparticles, respectively, were also determined using a Franz cell chamber. In the cell, the sample passing from the intestine content to the blood stream was simulated. The cell was placed in a thermostatic bath at 37°C.The intestinal wall was simulated using an acetate cellulose membrane with a molecular weight cut-off of 12 kDa (Spectrum Labs, Spectra/Por 2, CA, USA), since only low molecular weight compounds can permeate into the serum ( , ). In the cell upper compartment, simulated intestinal fluid was deposited containing the grape extracts or nanoparticles (1 g/L), while the lower compartment contained 10 mL of phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 to simulate the blood pH. The lower compartment was agitated to simulate the condition that in the blood the compound concentration is null. Aliquots of 0.5 mL were withdrawn each 10 min during the first hour and every 15 min during the second hour. The samples were stored in Eppendorf tubes at 4°C for total phenol determination. The global mass transfer coefficient was calculated according to Eq. ( 4 ) ( ). $$ K=\frac{\mathrm{dC}}{\mathrm{dt}}\frac{V_{\mathrm{c}}}{A_i{\mathrm{C}}_{\mathrm{s},0}} $$ (4)
where A i is the cross sectional area of the Franz cell in m 2 , C s,0 is the initial concentration in the upper compartment in milligram equivalent catechin/liter, C is the concentration in the lower compartment in milligram equivalent catechin/liter, K is the global mass transfer coefficient of the drug between the intestinal content and the blood in m/s, t is the time in seconds, V c is the lower compartment volume of the Franz cell in m 3, and dC/dt is the slope of the graph C vs . t in kg/m s.
Mathematical Model for the Grape Extracts and the Extracts Loaded on PLA Nanoparticles for the Absorption Prediction
For the model development, the small intestine was considered as a long tube (3 m) with a diameter of 0.03 m, in which the intestinal fluid flows with a speed of 3.7 . 10 −4 m/s. A plug flow model was chosen, considering only the axial direction transfer (convection and diffusion were considered) while that radially mass transfer occurs by diffusion. A differential mass balance was carried out considering a fixed volume element ΔV = SΔz, with S cross section, and area A = 2πRΔz to obtain the two different profile concentration: a mass balance to represent the grape extract dissolution Eq. ( 5 ) and the nanoparticle dissolution on the intestine length Eq. ( 6 ), respectively.
First Case of Study: Mathematical Model of the Extract Dissolution on the Intestine
Mass balance: $$ \left[{J}_c(z)+{J}_d(z)\right]-\left[{J}_c\left( z+\varDelta z\right)-{J}_d\left( z+\varDelta z\right)\right]-{J}_w=0 $$ (5)
Convective flux is defined by the following equation: $$ {J}_{\mathrm{c}}={QC}_{\mathrm{a}}={Sv}_{\mathrm{z}}{C}_{\mathrm{a}}(z) $$ (6)
The diffusive flux is determined by Fick’s law: $$ {J}_{\mathrm{d}}=- D\frac{dC_{\mathrm{a}}}{dz} S $$ (7)
Furthermore, the extract absorption flux from the intestine to the blood is given by the general equation for mass transfer, where the grape extract concentration in the blood was considered zero since the bloodstream speed minimizes the thickness of the limit layer ( ). $$ {J}_{\mathrm{w}}= K\Delta A\left({C}_{\mathrm{a}}-0\right)= K2\pi R\Delta z\left({C}_{\mathrm{a}}-0\right) $$ (8)
Replacing in Eq. ( 5 ) $$ S\left[{v}_{\mathrm{z}}{C}_{\mathrm{a}}(z)- D\frac{d{C}_{\mathrm{a}}}{ d z}(z)\right]- S\left[{v}_{\mathrm{z}}{C}_{\mathrm{a}}\left( z+\varDelta z\right)- D\frac{d{C}_{\mathrm{a}}}{ d z}\left( z+\varDelta z\right)\right]-2 K\pi R\varDelta z\left({C}_{\mathrm{a}}-0\right)=0 $$ (9)
Dividing by SΔz = πR 2 Δz and taking the limit as Δz→0, we got: $$ {v}_{\mathrm{z}}\frac{{d C}_{\mathrm{a}}}{ d z}= D\frac{d^2{C}_{\mathrm{a}}}{{d z}^2}-2\frac{K}{R}{C}_{\mathrm{a}} $$ (10)
A mass balance in steady state and not considering the chemical reactions of intestinal metabolism was made to the solution, based on an Eulerian reference frame. There are two boundary conditions for this balance: $$ z=0\kern0.5em {C}_{\mathrm{a}}={C}_{\mathrm{a}0} $$ (11) $$ \begin{array}{cc}\hfill z= L\hfill & \hfill \frac{dC_{\mathrm{a}}}{dz}=0\hfill \end{array} $$ (12)
Second Case of Study: Mathematical Model of the Intestinal Absorption of Grape Extracts Encapsulated in PLA Nanoparticles
As in the previous case, a grape extract mass balance was performed in a differential volume element ΔV, considering a stationary state. A mass balance was carried out to the particle r p considering a distance dz to a velocity v p and in a time t , considering the particle as reference frame. It is considered that the particle velocity is the same as the fluid v z . Thus, the particles Reynolds are defined as $$ R{e}_{\mathrm{p}}=\frac{\left|{v}_{\mathrm{p}}-{v}_{\mathrm{z}}\right|2{r}_{\mathrm{p}}}{\mu}=0 $$ (13)
The mass transfer coefficient of the film around the particle was considered following an empiric correlation ( ). $$ \frac{k_{\mathrm{l}}2{r}_{\mathrm{p}}}{D}=2+0.6{Re}_{\mathrm{p}}^{0.5}{Sc}^{\frac{1}{3}}=2 $$ (14) $$ {k}_{\mathrm{l}}=\frac{D}{r_{\mathrm{p}}} $$ (15)
Since the nanoparticles protect the grape extracts from the stomach passage, the dissolution occurs mainly in the intestine, and an entrance flux through ΔV for dissolution ( J s ) and intestinal absorption ( J w ) were considered:
Mass balance $$ S\left[{v}_{\mathrm{z}}{C}_{\mathrm{a}}(z)- D\frac{d{C}_{\mathrm{a}}}{d_{\mathrm{z}}}(z)\right]- S\left[{v}_{\mathrm{z}}{C}_{\mathrm{a}}\left( z+\varDelta z\right)- D\frac{d{C}_{\mathrm{a}}}{ d z}\left( z+\varDelta z\right)\right]+{j}_{\mathrm{s}}{S}_{\mathrm{p}}\pi {R}^2\varDelta z-{j}_{\mathrm{w}}2\pi R\varDelta z=0 $$ (16)
Dividing by SΔz = πR 2 Δz and taking the limit as Δz→0, we got: $$ -\frac{d}{ d z}\left({v}_{\mathrm{z}}{C}_{\mathrm{a}}- D\frac{d{C}_{\mathrm{a}}}{ d z}\right)+{j}_{\mathrm{s}}{S}_{\mathrm{p}}-\frac{2}{R}{j}_{\mathrm{w}}=0 $$ (17)
The mass flux density for the particle dissolution ( J s ) is given for: $$ {j}_{\mathrm{s}}={k}_{\mathrm{l}}\left({C}_{\mathrm{s}}-{C}_{\mathrm{a}}\right)=\frac{D}{r_{\mathrm{p}}}\left({C}_{\mathrm{s}}-{C}_{\mathrm{a}}\right) $$ (18)
The mass flux density for the intestinal absorption ( J w ) is given for: $$ {j}_{\mathrm{w}}= K\left({C}_{\mathrm{a}}-0\right) $$ (19)
with K as the mass transfer global coefficient, which considers the transfer coefficient in the intestinal fluid, the intestinal wall resistance, and the transfer coefficient in the bloodstream.
The specific surface ( S p ) was defined as the relation between the surface of n particles and the volume of the doses ingested; in this study, 10 mL were used with a concentration of 1 g/L. $$ {S}_{\mathrm{p}}= n\frac{A_{\mathrm{p}}}{V_0}= n\frac{4\pi {r}_{\mathrm{p}}^2}{V_0} $$ (20)
Since the particle radius decreases with the time caused for the dissolution, a mass balance was made to a particle following a Lagrangian framework $$ \frac{dm_{\mathrm{p}}}{dt}=-{k}_{\mathrm{l}}{A}_{\mathrm{p}}\left({C}_{\mathrm{s}}-{C}_{\mathrm{a}}\right) $$ (21)
with $$ {m}_{\mathrm{p}}={\rho}_{\mathrm{p}}{\upsilon}_{\mathrm{p}}={\rho}_{\mathrm{p}}\frac{4}{3}\pi {r}_{\mathrm{p}}^3;{A}_{\mathrm{p}}=4\pi {r}_{\mathrm{p}}^2\kern0.5em \mathrm{and}\kern0.5em {\upsilon}_{\mathrm{z}}= Q/ S $$ (22)
as the particle change of position over time. $$ {v}_{\mathrm{z}}=\frac{dz}{dt} $$ (23) $$ dt=\frac{dz}{v_{\mathrm{z}}}=\frac{dz}{Q/ S} $$ (24)
Thus, the mathematical model that describes the intestinal dissolution and absorption of PLA-nanoencapsulated grape extracts is defined by the following equations system, which was solved using the shooting method in Matlab®. $$ {v}_{\mathrm{z}}\frac{{d C}_{\mathrm{a}}}{ d z}= D\frac{d^2{C}_{\mathrm{a}}}{{d z}^2}+ n\frac{D}{V_0}4\pi {r}_{\mathrm{p}}\left({C}_{\mathrm{s}}-{C}_{\mathrm{a}}\right)-2\frac{K}{R}{C}_{\mathrm{a}} $$ (25) $$ z=0\kern8.5em {C}_{\mathrm{a}}={C}_{\mathrm{a}0} $$ (26) $$ z= L\kern8.5em \frac{\partial {C}_{\mathrm{a}}}{\partial z}=0 $$ (27) $$ \frac{dr_{\mathrm{p}}}{dz}=\frac{- D\pi {R}^2}{Q\rho}\frac{\left({C}_{\mathrm{s}}-{C}_{\mathrm{a}}\right)}{r_{\mathrm{p}}} $$ (28) $$ z=0\kern7em {r}_{\mathrm{p}}={r}_{\mathrm{p}0} $$ (29)
Statistical Analysis
All experimental design analyses were performed in duplicate. The spectrophotometric determinations were performed in triplicate, and the arithmetic means were expressed with the standard deviation. The Statgraphics® Plus 4.1 software was used with a statistically significant average of p ≤ 0.05.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Grape Seed and Skin Extract Characterization
The PAs present in the grape seed and skin extracts were characterized by the type of subunits present in the PAs, the mean degree of polymerization (mDP), the average molecular weight (aMW), and the PA content (Table I ). The structural composition differed significantly since the skin extracts have no EC or ECG and EGC-P were not detected in the seed adducts. Furthermore, EGC was found only in skin extracts, and its mDP was higher than for the seed extracts (mDP = 9.2 on average for seed, mDP >25 in the skin). The seed extracts were found to have a higher total PA content than the skin. Thus, the PAs from skin were more complex and of a bigger size than seed PAs, but the PA content per gram of extract was lower, which could have an effect on the nanoparticle formation as will be discussed in the next paragraph.

The results obtained here for País grapes were consistent with those for grapes from the same variety harvested in other years ( , ). A comparison of the structural characteristics of PAs from País grapes with those reported for PAs of international grape cultivars determined by a depolymerization method ( , , ) showed that the seed extract from País grapes has the same extension and terminal PA subunits as those of most of the well-known grape varieties such as Pinot Noir , Carmenere , Cabernet Sauvignon , Merlot , Tempranillo , and Graciano , while the skin extract differed from that of Cabernet Sauvignon , Merlot, Tempranillo , and Graciano , due to the absence of EC in its terminal subunits.
The molecular distribution of the skin extracts was broader than seed extracts (Table II ), determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The skin extracts had six different molecule types, with MW between 451 and 25,807 Da, which were not present in the seed extract. This latter extract had 59% of molecules between 800 and 21,928 Da, distributed in 3 ranges. Thus, skin and seed extracts had differences in their polymeric compositions, which could produce different metabolic behavior in vivo and on nanoparticle formation.

Physicochemical Parameters of Grape Seed and Skin Extracts and Loaded PLA Nanoparticles
Biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles have been extensively used for controlled delivery of active molecules and drugs ( ). Polymeric nanoparticles have the potential to act as drug carriers at target sites by enhancing biological activity and reducing adverse side effects ( ). Various biodegradable polymers such as poly-lactic–co-glycolic acid (PLGA), poly-D,L-lactide (PLA), poly-e-caprolactone (PCL), chitosan, gelatin, and poly (alkyl cyanoacrylates) have been successfully used for targeted delivery of drugs to treat cancer, asthma, diabetes, malaria, and other harmful diseases ( , ). Among the biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles, poly-D,L-lactide (PLA) has been extensively used for the encapsulation of many therapeutic agents, due to its high hydrophobicity, biodegradability, biocompatibility, low toxicity, strong mechanical strength, and slow drug release ( , , , ), all of which motivated the use of this polymer to stabilize the PAs.
The entrapment efficiency of the extract on PLA nanoparticles was over 80% for both types of extracts (Fig. 1 ). The nanoparticle size was between 291 and 352 nm for seed and skin extracts, respectively, and the effective electric charge on the nanoparticle surface, determined by zeta potential measurement, was −20.8 and −6.9 mV, with a polydispersion index of 0.120 and 0.202, respectively. The density of the extracts was lower than that of loaded PLA nanoparticles, i.e., seed extract, 96 kg/m 3 vs . PLA loaded with grape seed extract, 210 kg/m 3 ; skin extract, 54 kg/m 3 vs . PLA loaded with grape skin extract, 212 kg/m 3 . This could be due to the presence of the encapsulant polymer, whose density is 1270 kg/m 3 . Nevertheless, the density of PLA nanoparticles was about 83% lower than that of their constituent polymer, which could be explained by the spatial configuration taking PLA along with the extract in the encapsulation process. The density of the extracts and loaded PLA nanoparticles was compared with the density of other antihypertensive drugs ( ), the densities of both samples (extracts and nanoparticles) being lower, which is a factor that could have a negative influence on the dose determination. Fig. 1 TEM image of skin PAs-PLA nanoparticles showing spherical nonagregated particles
The density (ρ) and viscosity (μ) of intestinal simulated fluid was determined, in order to define the intestinal fluid regime flux, these being ρ = 946 ± 5 kg/m 3 and μ = 0.84 ± 0.01 mPa*s, respectively. Both values were close to the properties of water at 25°C (ρ = 997 kg/m 3 and μ= 0.89 mPa*s) ( ). The Reynolds number was 12.48, considering an axial velocity of 3.7∙10 −4 m/s ( ), which corresponds to a laminar regime. The solubility of seed extracts in the simulated intestinal fluid was 77.5 ± 1.3 kg/m 3 , whereas the solubility of the skin extract was 63.8 ± 10.3 kg/m 3 . Based on the classification made by Oh et al. ( ), a compound whose solubility is less than 0.05 kg/m 3 is considered slightly soluble, so that grape extracts are highly soluble at intestinal pH. This result is favorable because the saturation concentration represents the upper concentration limit, which can be achieved within the intestine.
Diffusion Coefficient (D) of Seed and Skin Grape Extracts and PLA Nanoparticles Loaded in Simulated Gastrointestinal Fluid at 37°C
D was determined for the extracts and PLA-loaded nanoparticles in simulated gastrointestinal fluid, the samples being first submitted to pH 2.0 for the stomach and then to pH 6.5 for the intestine, using a Franz cell and a synthetic membrane (Table III ). The diffusion coefficients for seed extract and skin had the same magnitude order. If we compared the D value of seed extract in simulated intestinal fluid with D of grape seed extract in Milli-Q water (pH 7.4, D = 0.345∙10 −5 ± 5∙10 −8 cm 2 /s) ( ); although it was the same magnitude order, it was 1.78 times lower. This could be caused by the influence of pH on molecular interactions. The electric double layer formed at the boundary between a solid surface and an electrolyte solution determines its electrokinetic (interfacial double layer or charge) properties ( ). The loaded nanoparticles have a negative zeta potential to pH 7.4 (see previous results), and reducing the pH can change the surface charge and thereby its diffusion.

Moreover, in a study conducted by Shirivas et al. ( ), the diffusion coefficient was determined in water at 39°C for (+)-catechin and (−)-epicatechin, whose values were 3.07∙10 −6 and 2.66∙10 −6 cm 2 s −1 , respectively. It was observed that the diffusion coefficients for seed extract and skin had the same order of magnitude as their constituent compounds; however, their values differ, which could be explained by the difference in temperature at which the experiments were performed, and also the difference in molecular weights (Table II ), where the presence of higher molecules could change the behavior of the monomeric molecules.
A comparison of D from grape extracts with those obtained for PLA-nanoencapsules loaded with the extracts showed a diffusion coefficient 9.4 and 23.3 times higher for skin and seed, respectively. This difference could be due to the influence of the synthesis processes of nanoparticles, especially in the ultrasonication, where the polymer precipitated as a nanoparticle and the grape extracts could suffer a break in their chains dispersed in the matrix network of PLA. Thus, the extract release from the nanoparticle would have a smaller molecular size than unencapsulated extract, increasing the diffusion coefficient. Furthermore, it has been reported that nanoencapsulation increases the solubility of the phenolic compounds in physiological fluids ( ), so it would be reasonable to obtain higher diffusion coefficients.
Global Mass Transfer Coefficient (K) of Grape Seed and Skin Extracts and Loaded PLA Nanoparticles Simulating the Passing from the Intestine to the Blood
The global mass transfer coefficient of skin and seed extracts and loaded PLA nanoparticles were K = 24.7∙10 −4 and K = 34.1∙10 −4 cm/s, respectively (Table III ). K from skin extract was two times lower than in the case of the seed extract. This can be associated with the differences in the PAs polymer compositions of the two extracts, as previously discussed.
Table IV shows the overall mass transfer coefficients between the intestinal contents and blood of different active compounds used as drugs, which were determined in vivo , using murine models, by Salphati et al. ( ). Among them are antihypertensives such as propranolol, naproxen, metoprolol, and atenolol. Their global mass transfer coefficients were of the same magnitude order as those obtained in this study, so they are comparable. Note that the lowest coefficient value of mass transfer, which corresponds to skin extract, had a value similar to that of metoprolol, considered a high permeability compound based on FDA guidelines (2002). Moreover, it is noteworthy that the global mass transfer coefficient values were of the same magnitude order, considering the high molecular weight of the extracts, in relation to the other active compounds. As previously mentioned in Table II , PA extracts possess a molecular weight distribution, so that only low-size molecules will have diffusion. Furthermore, the molecular weight reported in Table I corresponds to an average of lyophilized extract, and does not consider the hydrolytic degradation experienced by higher molecular weight PAs during digestion ( ).

Mathematical Model for the Absorption Prediction of Grape Extracts and PLA Nanoparticles Loaded with Grape Extracts
Ananthakrishnan ( ) studied the dispersion through various transport mechanisms relating through the Bodenstein number ( B 0 ), with the objective of determining a mathematical model based on the mass transfer mechanism. The B 0 number represents a relationship between the transport by convection and diffusion, and is given by the following equation: $$ B\mathrm{o}=\frac{v_{\mathrm{z}}{d}_{\mathrm{t}}}{D} $$ (30)
where υ is the axial velocity intestinal fluid in the intestine, d t is the diameter bowel, and D is the diffusion coefficient. With the diffusion coefficients determined experimentally in this paper, B o numbers for each case were obtained, this being for the grape extracts a pure convection regime and for the PLA nanoparticles a mixed flow regime.
The mathematical model used to simulate the grape extract absorption and PLA nanoparticles loaded with extracts consists of a system of two second-order ordinary differential equations (see materials and method section ). Along with this, the physicochemical experimentally obtained parameters were used, as summarized in Table V , and they were used to solve Eq. ( 10 ) using the boundary conditions Eqs. ( 11 and 12 ) for the first case of study , $$ {C}_{\mathrm{a}}={C}_{\mathrm{a}0} \exp \left(\frac{-2 Kz}{Rv_{\mathrm{z}}}\right) $$ (31) Table V Physical-Chemical Parameters used to Solve the Models for the Extracts and Nanoparticles Property Seed extract Skin extract PLA nanoparticles loaded with seed extract PLA nanoparticles loaded with skin extract K (cm/s) 1.03 × 10 −4 5.13 × 10 −5 0.0034 0.00247 ρ (g/cm) 0.0961 0.054 0.2120 0.2095 C a0 (g/cm 3 ) 0.001 0.001 3.48 × 10 −6 4.42 × 10 −6 C s (g/cm 3 ) 0.0775 0.0638 0.0775 0.0638 r p0 (cm) 3.52 × 10 −5 2.92 × 10 −5 D (cm 2 /s) 1.81 × 10 −5 5.72 × 10 −5 n 2.58 × 10 4.57 × 10
Figure 2 shows the concentration profiles simulation of seed and skin extracts along the extension of the intestine. In both cases, the concentration profile begins with a maximum value, since the extract dissolution was produced in the stomach, and the concentration began to drop due to intestinal absorption. However, the concentration never reached zero, which is consistent with in vitro studies, where only 48% of the phenolic compounds present in food are absorbed in the small intestine ( ). Furthermore, the seed extract fraction absorbed in the small intestine was 42.7%, while for the skin extract it was 24.2%. This was due to a higher global mass transfer coefficient of the seed extract than the skin extract coefficient, which offers a lower resistance to mass transfer from the intestine into the blood, which can be explained by the different chemical composition of both extracts. However, the complete absorption was not achieved for either of the extracts. Fig. 2 Simulated concentration profiles of seed ( solid line ) and skin ( dash line ) extracts along the extension of the intestine
The absorption simulation of grape extracts encapsulated in PLA nanoparticles was carried out using the model presented in Eq. ( 25 ), which was solved using the boundary conditions for the second case of study , Eqs. ( 26 – 28 ). The nanoparticles had an initial radius of 352 and 291 nm for seed and skin extracts, respectively. Furthermore, due to the flow rate of the solution of PLA nanoparticles in intestinal fluid corresponding to a mixed flow regime, the model represented the mass transport by diffusion and convection.
Figure 3 shows the concentration profiles for skin and seed extract on PLA nanoparticles, respectively, with the intestine length. A maximum was observed in both cases, and finally the absorbed fraction was 100%. Encapsulated seed extract was absorbed in the first 30 cm of the intestine, while skin extract was absorbed in the first 17 cm. The distance in which the absorption occurs was reduced in comparison to the raw extracts, the process being improved with the encapsulation. Fig. 3 Simulated concentration profiles of seed extract loaded PLA nanoparticles ( solid line ) and skin extract loaded PLA nanoparticles ( dash line ) along the extension of the intestine
The decrease in nanoparticle radius with respect to the intestinal length is shown in Fig. 4 , where the dissolution of the extract occurred before the absorption. This could be due to the high value of diffusion coefficient obtained experimentally, which added to the low amount of nanoencapsulate mass, causing a fast dissolution of the extracts in the intestinal fluid, reaching a maximum to later decrease to zero. Fig. 4 Seed extract-loaded PLA nanoparticles ( solid line ) and skin extract-loaded PLA nanoparticles ( dash line ) radius decrease with respect to the intestinal length
Therefore, solubility was not a limiting step in the whole dissolution-absorption process. The particle nano size favors the mass transfer from the intestine, due to the increased particle surface to volume ratios.
CONCLUSIONS
The intestinal absorption of grape seed and skin extracts and of the PLA nanoparticles loaded with such extracts was modeled. The physicochemical process parameters, density ( ρ ), solubility, viscosity ( μ ), diffusion coefficient ( D ), and the global mass transfer coefficient ( K ) for both substrates were estimated by simulating their passing from the intestine into the blood at 37°C. In particular, for seed and skin extracts nanoencapsulated on PLA, K increased 33 and 48 times, and D was 10 and 23 times more than for the raw extracts, respectively. Thus, the encapsulation of the extracts was favorable, which should reduce the mass transfer resistance. The concentration of grape skin and seed extracts in the small intestine was modeled through a pure convection model and that of the PLA nanoparticles encapsulated extracts using a mixed regime model, which described the process of dissolution and absorption of grape extract from the small intestine into the bloodstream. Extract encapsulation increased the absorbed fraction to 100% in comparison with the raw extracts, where complete absorption was not achieved for either of the extracts. Thus, extract encapsulation should produce a significant increase in intestinal absorption. In the future, in vivo work should be performed to validate the results found here.
