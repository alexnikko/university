1 Introduction
Sleep is a fundamental necessity for human beings [ ]. Sleep problems are quite common in organizations causing several work-related consequences. Research indicates that employees suffering from chronic insomnia reported a 4.5 times higher accident rate as compared with those without insomnia [ ]. Several epidemiological studies have shown how working for long hours becomes a critical risk factor for workplace injury [ , , , , ]. Long work hours more often than not results in a short or disturbed sleep [ ]. Sleep quality and Sleep quantity have been largely conceptualised as one of the two variables of sleep by the organizational sleep research [ , ]. Sleepiness is one of the most common and debilitating direct consequences of sleep problems [ , ]. “Sleepiness can be both a state (i.e. a subject’s level of sleepiness at a particular time, which may be normal or abnormal) and trait (i.e. a subject’s more enduring and able level of daytime sleepiness) phenomenon” [ ]. Workplace sleepiness helps us understand how sleepy the employees feel during at their work time [ ] and can be understood as an outcome of low sleep quality and/or quantity. Epidemiologic studies have shown that sleepiness affects 4–5% of the total population in the western world, which further leads to social and occupational problems for the individual [ ].
Reports of disturbed sleep in the Indian context exhibits a frightening future for the country if the employees continue to follow a poor sleep routine. Studies have shown that 72% of Indians are waking up one to three times per night and 87% say sleep is affecting their health. 58% of Indians believe their work suffers due to inadequate sleep, whereas 38% have witnessed a colleague falling asleep at work [ ]. Studies from the Occupational health experts of Bangalore have shown that night shift duties result in very serious health concerns for call center employees and sleep disorders were observed among 83% of employees. Sleep deprivation leads to a lot of health problems: fatigue, mood changes like depression, decreased cognitive functioning, poor executive functioning, impaired vigilance, and an increased vulnerability to a number of infections [ ]. The study by Raja and Bhasin has also shown that most call handlers’ work leads to a dual life in terms of their ‘time of work’. At times when they are normally expected to be sleeping, they are forced to work and vice versa. It is almost as if they have embraced the life of an Indian worker by day and westerners by night. This ‘graveyard shift’ primarily challenges their circadian rhythm and often leads to Circadian rhythm sleep disorders (CRSD). Majority of the employees working the night shift are unable to get good sleep during the daytime and are likely to develop cumulative sleep debt which can further worsen their health leading to extreme sleep deprivation and other medical conditions [ ].
As Anjan Bose, Vice-president of Philips Healthcare India, once said: “Sleep is not optional- it is absolutely critical to people’s health. The consequences of not sleeping enough are well documented and anybody who is experiencing poor sleep must definitely visit the doctor”. Despite the cautions, sleep in the professional context is a neglected area of study. Keeping this research gap, the present study seeks to address two research objectives: first, to assess the overall sleep quality and sleepiness among diverse professionals and to look at if the quality of sleep and sleepiness varies across professions; and second, to check if PSQI can be used as a predictor of sleepiness of employees at workplace.
2 Study Design and Participants
2.1 Study Participants
There were four categories of white collar employees viz. Consultants, Academicians, Marketing Managers and Technical Professionals measured for the study. Consultants were chosen because they always work in a rigid work schedule. They need to provide services to their clients on deadlines, and studies have shown how deadlines have a negative effect on sleep [ ]. Academicians were chosen because they are offered comparatively pleasant working environment offering autonomy and time for scholarly reflection. It is estimated that on an average, academicians work approximately 55 h per week and are expected to be under heavy strain as they are often expected to fulfil multiple role demands within the work setting, e.g. teaching, involving in research related work, consultation, etc. [ ]. As Academicians have been consistently identified as a group experiencing high level of stress and job demand [ ] it was assumed that they experience sleep disturbances. The FMCG sector in India faces tough competition and it is expected to increase in the coming years. Marketing Personnel in this sector are under extreme pressure as they are accountable for the success of the top and bottom line of the company. Technical Professionals were chosen because software engineers have been found to be low on sleep quality [ ]. The Consultants in the present study were working in business, IT and HR consultancies, Academicians were the professors working full time in the top B Schools, Marketing Executives were chosen from the FMCG sector, and the Technical Professionals were working in the software companies/IT departments in various organizations. All the participants were based out of Mumbai, the financial capital of India.
2.2 Sampling Strategy
419 respondents participated in this research. The sampling technique used was purposive sampling, a technique in which the respondents or the participants for the study are chosen based on the purpose of the study [ ]. Within purposive sampling, maximum variation sampling, also known as heterogeneous sampling, was used to capture a wide range of perspectives relating to sleep. The criteria used for the inclusion of the respondents were professionals having minimum 2 years of work experience, those who were without any sleep medications for the last 3 months, and those who volunteered to participate in the study. The mean age of the participants was 31 ± 7.7 years, the minimum was 23 years, and maximum 54 years. 199 participants belonged to the age group of 23–29 years (coded as 1), 124 belonged to the age group of 30–39 years (coded as 2), 51 belonged to the age group of 40–49 years (coded as 3) and 45 belonged to the age group of 49–54 years (coded as 4). 202 participants were males and the remaining were females (Table 1 ). Table 1 Professional category and age group cross-tabulation results Professional category Age Total 23–29 30–39 40–49 50 and above Consultants 106 (53) 66 (33) 12 (6) 15 (7) 199 (100) Academicians 43 (57) 20 (29) 7 (9) 5 (6) 75 (100) Marketing Executives 39 (60) 18 (27) 6 (9) 2 (3) 65 (100) Technical Professionals 51 (63) 20 (25) 5 (6) 4 (5) 80 (100) Total 239 124 30 26 419 Figures in parenthesis indicate the percentage of total sample belonging to the Professional Category
2.3 Measures for Sleep Assessment
The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), 1 developed by researchers in the University of Pittsburgh, was used to estimate the participant’s sleep quality. The PSQI measure has 24 items of which 19 self-reported items are added non-linearly to generate seven components. Component scores range from 0 to 3 and are summed to obtain a global score, which ranges from 0 to 21. Higher scores suggest greater sleep disturbance; a global score more than 5 suggests a significant disturbance [ ].
Daytime sleepiness was measured by using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). 2 The ESS was developed by Johns and it is a widely used and validated self-administered questionnaire. It asks subjects to rate their chance of falling asleep or dozing on a scale of 0–3 in eight soporific situations, ranging from ‘Lying down to rest in the afternoon when circumstances permit’ to ‘in a car while stopped for a few minutes in traffic’.
2.4 Data Analysis
The data were analysed using the statistical software packages of SPSS version 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA) and AMOS software (version 22).
3 Results
3.1 Assessment of Overall Sleep Quality and Daytime Sleepiness
The first objective of the study was to assess the overall sleep quality and sleepiness among diverse professionals in India and examine if the quality of sleep and sleepiness varies across professions. To address this, descriptive statistics were first calculated using SPSS across gender- and age-groups (Table 2 ). As Table 2 indicates, participants’ mean PSQI global score was 5.49 ± 2.45. The cut-off point of PSQI score is 5 (PSQI > 5 indicate poor sleep quality). It indicates that, on an average, participants met a minimal threshold definition for poor sleep quality. The mean ESS score of participants was 10.45 ± 4.55, which indicates relatively higher normal daytime sleepiness.

Prevalence of sleep quality and sleepiness among professionals was estimated using one-way ANOVA (analysis of variance) (Table 2 ) with post hoc Tukey HSD (honestly significant difference) (Table 3 ). As Table 2 displays, the ESS scores for the consultants is higher than the other professional groups ( M = 11.45 ± 4.42). Further probing indicated that there was no significant difference in the mean PSQI, F (1,417) = 1.18, p > 0.05, and ESS F (1,417) = 0.08, p > 0.05 score between the genders. Similarly, ANOVA results indicate no significant difference in the mean score of ESS between and within the four age groups, F (3,415) = 1.99, p > 0.05. However, significant difference F (3,415) = 2.803, p < 0.05 was found in the mean PSQI score across age groups. There is a significant difference in the PSQI scores between the age group of 23–29 years (5.64) and 49–54 years (4.19) at p ≤ 0.05 (Table 2 ). The Tukey post hoc tests in (Table 3 ) point out that the daytime sleepiness of the consultants was statistically significantly different from Academicians, Marketing Executives and Technical Professional ( p = 0.05).

The graph presented in (Fig. 1 ) indicates that 31.3% of participants have reported the score of less than 5, and the remaining 68.7% a score more than 5 indicating poor quality of sleep. None of the participants reported a minimum score of zero and a maximum score of 18. It is to be noted here that PSQI component 6, i.e. sleep medication is not included in any statistical analysis in this section as only those participants who were without any sleep medication for the past 3 months were included in the study. The individual components of the tool such as components 1, 2, 4 and 7, did show floor and ceiling effects (Fig. 2 ). Fig. 1 The percentage distribution of the PSQI global scores Fig. 2 The per cent distribution of the PSQI scores—component wise
The mean sleepiness score is 10.45 ±4.55 indicating higher normal daytime sleepiness in participants. 52.7% of the participants have reported the score of 10 or less, indicating lower to higher normal daytime sleepiness. Mild and moderate excessive daytime sleepiness was experienced by 15.3% and 12.4% of the participants, respectively. 19.6% of the participants scored between 16 and 24, which indicates severe excessive daytime sleepiness and that it needs medical attention. 3.3% of the participants reported a minimum score of 0, and 0.5% reported a maximum score of 24 (Fig. 3 ). Fig. 3 The percentage distribution of the ESS scores
3.2 Testing Psychometric Properties of PSQI and ESS
The psychometric validity of both PSQI and ESS was then examined before proceeding to address the second objective of the study. The reason being both the tools have not been validated in a sample of working professionals in India before. The Cronbach alpha test was first done to assess the internal consistency. The internal consistency test of PSQI scores showed Cronbach’s alpha of 0.47, a value suggesting low consistency and ESS scores showed Cronbach’s alpha of 0.807, a value suggesting high consistency. Internal homogeneity for both the variables was tested by the correlation analysis. The internal homogeneity as indicated by Spearman’s correlation coefficient ( r ) between component scores and the global PSQI score was 0.28–0.68. The Spearman’s correlation coefficient ( r ) between individual ESS scores and the composite ESS score was 0.37–0.99. All the correlation coefficients were significant ( p < 0.001) (Table 4 ). Table 4 Internal homogeneity of the PSQI and ESS scores Components of the PSQI Component-to-global PSQI score correlations 1. PSQI component of sleep quality 0.555** 2.

Then suitability of data for the exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was tested. The two tests, viz. Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO) tests the adequacy of sampling, while the strength of the relationship among variables was assessed through Bartlett’s test of sphericity. KMO values for PSQI was 0.671 indicating mediocre and ESS was 0.481 indicating unacceptable data set. Bartlett’s test of sphericity values in case of both the variables were less than 0.05 significance level which indicates that these data do not produce an identity matrix and are thus approximately multivariate normal and acceptable for further analysis (Table 5 ). Anti-image correlation matrix: indicates how strongly one item is correlated with other items in the matrix. The cut-off is more than the threshold, i.e. > 0.70. Table 5 Summary of the sample size adequacy measures and EFA of the PSQI and ESS Measures PSQI (six components) PSQI (four components) ESS (eight items) ESS (seven items) Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin test of sampling adequacy 0.671 0.683 0.481 0.729 Bartlett’s test of sphericity < 0.001 < 0.001 < 0.001 < 0.001 Anti-image matrix 0.476–0.727 0.650–0.741 0.178–0.571 0.675–0.831 Determinant 0.499 0.520 0.004 0.305 Number of factors Kaiser’s criteria (Eigen value > 1) 2 1 2 1 Cumulative variance rule (> 40%) 2 1 1 1 Scree plot 2 1 2 1 Parallel analysis 3 2 4 2
An important consideration in EFA is the determination of an appropriate value to determine whether an item has “loaded” on a factor. Factor loadings are essential to see for data reduction or structure detection. The purpose of data reduction was to eliminate redundant (highly correlated) variables from the data file. The purpose of structure detection was to look at the underlying (or latent) relationships between the variables. Loadings of 0.3 or 0.4 and above are typically considered the “rule of thumb” threshold for this determination. However, a factor loading cut-off of > 0.50 was used in this study. Looking at Table 6 , we can see that PSQI component 1, 2, 5 and 7 load on factor 1 while component 3 and 4 are substantially loaded in factor 2. Similar is the case with ESS. The factor loadings for the final model of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) are reported for comparison with those of EFA in Table 5 . Table 6 Factor loadings in exploratory factor analysis of the PSQI and ESS Components of the PSQI PSQI-six components PSQI-four components Factor one Factor two Factor one 1.

Sitting quietly after a lunch without alcohol 0.641 0.011 0.640 ESS 8. In a car, while stopped for a few minutes in the traffic 0.738 − 0.347 0.760
Then confirmatory factor analysis was performed on the covariance matrix of the PSQI and ESS items. The model parameters were estimated in AMOS using maximum likelihood. PSQI originally had 6 items and ESS had 8 items. CFA removed components 3 and 4 from PSQI and four items, i.e. 1, 2, 4 and 5 from ESS. The results of the EFA of both PSQI and ESS showed a 2-dimensional structure, but the outcome of CFA favoured uni-dimensionality of the tools. After deletion of two components, i.e. component nos. 3 and 4, in the post confirmatory factor analysis, the KMO values of PSQI increased from 0.671 to 0.683 and Cronbach’s alpha value increased from 0.47 to 0.674. Similarly, the KMO values of ESS increased from 0.489 to 0.729 and Cronbach’s alpha increased from 0.807 to 0.825. Table 7 shows the overall fit indices for the CFA models. The Chi square minimum fit function test was significant. Based on suggestion by Hair et al. at least three indices must be fitted well to determine the model fit [ ]. This hypothesized one-factor model did fit the data well from both a statistical perspective ( χ 2 / df ) or a practical perspective (GFI, AGFI, CFI, RMSEA). Based upon this result, the PSQI and ESS measure items were finally shortened to 4 and 7 items, respectively.

3.3 PSQI as a Predictor of ESS
The final objective of the study was to investigate if PSQI can be used to predict the daytime sleepiness. We first ran the bivariate spearman correlations in SPSS to find the relationship between age, PSQI and ESS. The revised PSQI and ESS measures were used to perform the statistical analysis. Though age and professional category are found to be a significant predictor of both PSQI and ESS, PSQI and ESS relationship shows a negative and insignificant relationship (Table 8 ).

Then we performed the stepwise linear regression in SPSS to further probe into the causal connection between PSQI and ESS. In this regression, we controlled for the demographic variables such as age, gender and professional categories. The statistical analysis confirms the correlation results. The regression is split into two models. Model 1 includes the independent variable viz. sleep quality, while Model 2 includes the three control variables. Table 9 displays the unstandardized coefficients and standard errors (in brackets) of each predictor. Significant coefficients are marked with signs that are explained in the bottom of the Table. In Model 1, sleep quality explained only 2% of the variance in sleepiness ( R 2 = 0.020). In Model 2, when the three control variables were included, R 2 improved significantly to 12.6%. It shows that the controls like age and professional categories outweigh sleep quality in terms of their impact on sleepiness. Thus, we observed limited association between these two commonly used instruments, the ESS and the PSQI.

4 Discussion
Sleep loss has become quite common in modern society due to multiple factors such as hectic lifestyles, increased travel and the modern overall culture that we all currently reside in [ ]. Technological advancements have provided modern society with 24 × 7 work operations and also provided exposure to innumerable electronic devices. Increasing evidence indicates towards the fact that such advancements have taken their toll on human functioning and health through their detrimental effects on sleep behaviour such as quality, quantity and timing [ ]. Poor quality of sleep has been highly linked to increased health problems and various sleep disorders. Research has found that 7–8 h of sleep at night is associated positively with longevity and self-report health status [ ]. Despite such premonitions, no major study was conducted till date to delve into the extent of prevalence of sleep problems among different professional groups in India. Thus, the present study can be considered as a maiden attempt in this direction.
In this study, no significant difference was found in the mean PSQI and ESS scores between male and female participants. Prevalence of poor sleep quality and sleepiness was found in majority of the participants. 79.2% of the participants reported score more than 4, indicating poor quality of sleep (mean PSQI score was 5.49). 3 Daytime sleepiness was reported by 47.3% of the professionals who scored 10 and more in the ESS tool. No significant difference was found in the mean score of ESS between and within the four age groups; however, significant difference ( p < 0.05) was found in the mean PSQI score between the age group of 23–29 years (5.64) and 49–54 years (4.19). In the age group 49–54 years the sleep quality is excellent with an average of 4.19; whereas in the same group the average ESS score (12.02) is the highest possibly due to multiple factors such as some form of physical illness or changes in the circadian rhythms [ ]. Since participants were skewed towards Consultant professional category, and the mean age group of this category is 27 years, this age difference may be responsible for the significant change in the parameters.
The sleep quality of Consultants differed significantly from the Marketing Executives. Marketing executives, Academicians and Technical Professionals suffer from relatively inferior sleep quality as compared to the consultants. Daytime sleepiness of the consultants was statistically significantly different from academicians, Marketing Executives, and Technical Professionals. However, no statistically significant difference in sleepiness was found between Academicians, Marketing Executives and Technical Professionals. Though sleep quality is better among consultants, unexpectedly the sleepiness is also maximum in this category. As seen in previous studies, the relation between PSQI and ESS is weak and PSQI has usually not been seen as a strong predictor of ESS [ ]. The present study also finds no significant correlation between sleep quality and sleepiness. Sleep quality acts as a predictor of sleepiness when the variables like age and professional categories are controlled for.
The study has made an attempt to examine the psychometric validity of PSQI and ESS in the workplace/professional context. Originally the PSQI and ESS did not show the uni-dimensional factor structure in the professional settings for screening sleep problem. The final version of the PSQI, after EFA and CFA, contained four components (1, 2, 5 and 7). The ESS contained 7 items after EFA (san item 5) and 4 items (3, 6, 7 and 8) after CFA. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such modified versions of the sleep tools indorsed for use in Indian context.
Sleep quality explained 2% variance in sleepiness of the participants. But when the control variables were included, the model explained 12.6% variance in sleepiness. Thus, sleep quality acts as a predictor of sleepiness when the variables like age and professional categories are controlled for. Age and professional categories take precedence over sleep quality in terms of their impact on sleepiness. Thus, we observed restricted causal association between these two frequently used instruments, the ESS and the PSQI. Gender did not correlate with sleepiness problem. A few studies such as Pahwa and colleagues found similar results when conducted with the Canadian, Australian and American population [ ]. Lack of significant correlation between PSQI and ESS was also found by Buysse et al. in their study of patients with Parkinson’s disease and healthy controls, study of insomnia and control subjects or a study of hyper somnolence in truck drivers. Few Studies have also reported that PSQI and ESS measure orthogonal dimensions of sleep–wake symptoms, but neither is related to objective sleep measures [ ]. Some studies have found PSQI to be more closely related to psychological symptom ratings and sleep diary measures than the ESS, and they were not found to be useful for screening for Polysomnographic abnormalities [ ].
There are steps that can be taken by HR to make sure there employees do not fall prey to the problems of sleepiness at the workplace. It is important that regular monitoring is done in terms of overall health including their sleep cycle/schedule to see there is nothing out of the ordinary and they are getting the optimal hours and quality of sleep. One should keep a look out for lower work quality, higher accidents at work, frequent forgetful behaviour, absenteeism and anything else that is not usual of the employee. Over-time work should not be encouraged and employees should be given a sleep watch/ACTi graph that can track their sleep cycle and necessary action can be taken when things are not right. Sleep pods should be available at offices so that one can rest or take a power nap when exhausted to regain one’s focus rather than sitting at the work desk pretending to work. HR professionals can also involve employees in the process of devising their own work schedules that match employee preferences while keeping the business needs intact but also not compromising on the worker’s health. The early warning sign can help a long way in correcting the problem and increasing the productive work life of the employee.
5 Limitations and Implications for Future Research
The limitations of this study includes a modest sample size, and restricted professional groups. Future studies may look at other professional segments such as Finance and Accounts, Legal, Medicine, Police, Nursing, Scientists, Artists, etc. Sleep quality and sleepiness were measured using measures subjective in nature. There was non-application of clinical screening and Polysomnography (PSG) which could have supplemented our findings. Future research may include such applications to examine sleep issues of various professional groups. The psychometric validity of both PSQI and ESS was checked and revised factor structures were identified. Future studies should test these shortened version of the measures to generalize this result. The research was cross-sectional in nature because data for this study were collected from individual respondents at a single point of time. The results may differ from a longitudinal study, where sleep could be measured periodically. The present study could not be carried out in a longitudinal manner due to constraints like lack of permission from the organisations and unwillingness of the participants to extend support beyond a point because of work pressure. The authors wished they could have included and collected data on chronotype and BMI and their impact on sleep and sleepiness, but they could not do it because of feasibility issues. Finally, participants tended to be healthier than those who were discounted for being under sleep medication and medication for ailments like blood pressure, diabetes, and antidepressants during the preceding 3 months. It is possible that some of the respondents were taking some other medications which interrupted their sleep quality or triggered daytime drowsiness. Researchers did not have any control over medications. Nonetheless, in the field of sleep and wakefulness, several unanswered questions always stay. Theses unanswered questions can be picked by other researchers for further inquiry.

In the current study component 6, which deals with use of sleep medications has been excluded from the study. Hence any score of ‘4’ and greater instead of ‘5’ was considered as an indicator of poor sleep quality.
