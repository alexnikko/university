Introduction
Rabbits have been an invaluable animal model within the field of tissue engineering, offering insight to the graph-specific immune response of experimental biomaterials [ , , , , , , ]. They are the largest small animal species available, are easy to house, with short reproduction cycles, while still possessing organ systems similar to humans [ ], making them excellent surgical candidates for biomaterial assessment [ ]. Development of a T cell flow cytometry panel has potential for monitoring of rabbit graft-specific T cell-mediated immune responses toward xenogeneic biomaterials.
Glutaraldehyde-fixed bovine pericardium (BP) is a widely used heart valve leaflet biomaterial; however, limitations of such fixed tissue valves have prompted development of numerous decellularization/antigen removal methods intended to reduce biomaterial antigenic burden [ , , , , , , ]. However, there is mounting evidence that chronic graft-specific cell-mediated immune responses may persist toward antigen-masked or acellular xenogeneic biomaterials [ , , , , , ]. Rabbits have been used for antigenicity screening of biomaterials previously through Western blots to detect anti-BP IgG antibodies [ , ]. While this information has proven useful, it only peripherally considers the role of T cells through inference of the requirement for T-helper cell help in isotype switching. Direct assessment of lymphocyte proliferation in response to such biomaterials has been achieved using thymidine incorporation; however, information concerning differential response of T cell subtypes is lacking [ ]. Previously reported rabbit immune panels have been restricted in their scope [ , ]. However, with the advent of more cross-reactive and species-specific antibodies for rabbits, the ability to generate a more complex immune panel is now possible. A flow cytometry-based T cell assay has potential to facilitate quantification of T cell proliferation, while simultaneously examining different T cell subtypes to assess graft-specific T cell responses and inform ongoing development of candidate xenogeneic biomaterials. Direct assessment of graft-specific cell-mediated responses toward BP in rabbits has potential application toward development and monitoring of such xenogeneic heart valve biomaterials.
The current manuscript intends to generate a robust T cell flow cytometry panel and associated proliferation assay that can aid in further developing the rabbit as an animal model, as well as providing a screening assay for development of future heart valve biomaterials. The ultimate aim is to monitor the chronic cell-mediated immune response toward BP using a previously validated model of antigenicity. Specifically, we hypothesized that T cells obtained from rabbits chronically immunized with homogenized BP would proliferate more strongly following in vitro re-stimulation with BP protein extract than would cells obtained from naïve rabbits. The goals of the current research are therefore to (1) develop a comprehensive flow cytometry T cell panel for rabbit-related research, (2) determine the effect of chronic immunization and cell culture on the different T cell populations, and (3) determine the effect of re-stimulation with bovine pericardium (BP) on proliferation, population distribution and marker intensity of T cells isolated from naïve versus immunized rabbits.
Materials and methods
All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) unless otherwise stated.
Tissue harvest
Fresh BP was harvested immediately postmortem from young adult cattle (Spear Products, Coopersburg, PA, USA) and shipped on dry ice. Tissue was defrosted and washed in 0.1% ( w / v ) anhydrous ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 1% ( v / v ) antibiotic and antimycotic solution (AAS), phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4), and 4% ( v / v ) Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Tissue underwent dissection to remove connective tissue, and the pericardial sac cut into 1 × 16 cm circumferential strips individually stored in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagles Medium (DMEM) with 15% ( v / v ) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at − 80 °C.
Protein extraction
Protein was extracted from minced BP as previously described [ ]. Briefly, BP was manually minced and mixed with extraction solution containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mM magnesium chloride hexahydrate, 10 mM potassium chloride, 0.5 mM Pefabloc SC (Roche, Indianapolis, IN), and 134 mM non-detergent sulfobetaine-256 (NDSB-256) at 1000 rpm, 4 °C for 1 h. Following centrifugation at 17,000 g , 4 °C for 25 min, protein extract was concentrated to 1 mg/mL with Amicon Ultra-4 centrifugal filter devices (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) and stored at − 80 °C.
Rabbit immunization
All animal procedures were conducted in accordance with the guidelines established by University of California, Davis IACUC, Mayo Clinic IACUC and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals [ ]. Five New Zealand White rabbits were bled (0 day) and blood collected in 10-mL hepranized tubes. Four rabbits received 500 μL of homogenized BP (1 g in 5 mL of 10 mM tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 2 mM magnesium chloride hexahydrate (MgCl 2 –6H 2 O), 10 mM potassium chloride (KCl), 0.5 mM Pefabloc (protease inhibitor)) and complete Freund’s adjuvant at D0, and incomplete Freund’s adjuvant on D14, 28, 42, at a 1:1 ratio by subcutaneous injection, as previously described [ ]. Post-immunization blood was collected at D0, 7, 14, 42, 56, and 84.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cell isolation
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated through three methods: ammonium-chloride-potassium (ACK) lysis alone, density stratification alone, and density stratification followed by ACK lysis. ACK lysis solution (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was performed in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations; a 10:1 ratio of buffer to blood was incubated for 3 min and quenched with 10 mL of PBS. For density stratification, Lympholyte®-Rabbit (Cedarlane®, Burlington, NC) was used according to manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 10 mL of whole blood was overlaid on 10 mL of lympholyte in a 50-mL centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 1500 g at RT for 30 min without a brake, and PBMCs collected. For density stratification with lysis, following density stratification, residual RBCs were removed by re-suspending the cell pellet in 4 mL of ACK lysis solution for 2 min and then quenched with 10 mL PBS. Regardless of isolation method, PMBCs were washed twice in 5 mL PBS and counted with a BD coulter counter (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), which quantified both nucleated and non-nucleated cells. Viability was assessed by manually counting the proportion of live/dead cells on a hemocytometer with a 1:1 dilution with trypan blue.
CellTrace™ violet labeling
PBMC concentration was equalized to 1 × 10 7 cells/mL for CellTrace™ Violet (CTV) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) staining. CTV stock was added to PBS to a final concentration of 2 μM. Equal volumes of cell solution and 2 μM CTV were mixed thoroughly and incubated at room temperature (RT) for 5 min. The reaction was quenched with 15 mL of media, and PBMCs were washed twice with complete RPMI (Roswell Park Memorial Institute) media (RPMI-1640, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 5% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S).
Culture conditions and mitogen stimulation assay
PBMCs were cultured in 24-well plates, at a density of 1 × 10 6 cells/well, in 1 mL of complete media for 3 days at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 . Maximally stimulated cells were cultured in complete media containing 5 μg/mL concavalin A (ConA). For the BP re-stimulation assay, T cells were primed in culture with 0.25 μg/mL ConA, which had been previously determined using a titration to determine the optimal response (data not shown), in addition to extraction solution alone (NDSB only) or 10 μg of BP protein extract (BP extracted in NDSB) [ , , ]. Proliferation response was defined as the percentage of proliferating T cells following stimulation with BP protein extract minus the percentage proliferating following NDSB addition alone. All stimulation assays used n = 5 rabbits with n = 3 technical replicates per experiment, except for the BP re-stimulation which used n = 4 rabbits.
Flow cytometry staining
After isolation or 3 days of culture, PBMCs were stained for flow cytometry with markers and their associated fluorophores listed in Table 1 . The CD4, CD8, and CD25 antibodies were purchased as purified antibodies and later conjugated to fluorophores using Abd Serotec conjugation kits (Bio-Rad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The T lymphocyte marker was purchased pre-conjugated and is a species-specific marker for rabbit T lymphocytes. Briefly, cells were washed with PBS, stained with FVS700 (BD Biosciences, NJ) viability stain, and washed with flow buffer (PBS with 1% FBS and 0.1% sodium azide). Cells were then stained with surface markers for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing with flow buffer, PBMCs were intracellularly stained for FOXP3 (BD biosciences FOXP3 staining kit) with a cross-reactive antibody that has been previously reported in rabbit lymphocytes (eBiosciences, San Diego, CA) [ ]. Briefly, PBMCs were fixed and permeabilized for 1 h at 4 °C and then stained with FOXP3 for 30 min at RT. Single stained controls were generated using ThermoFisher’s AbC total antibody compensation beads, and cultured unstimulated PBMCs were used for FMO controls [ ].

Flow cytometry data acquisition and analysis
Flow cytometry data was collected on an LSR-II (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Voltages were adjusted based on unstained and singly stained controls. Gating was done such that dead cells were excluded first followed by doublets; then, the lymphocyte area was gated on using side scatter (SSC) and forward scatter (FSC), and finally, events positive for T lymphocyte markers were gated. A total of 10,000 events were collected within the live cell positive T lymphocyte gate. All data was analyzed using FlowJo V10.3 Software, and compensation was applied within FlowJo. Singly stained and unstained samples were used to set up the compensation using the compensation tool, and no manual changes were made to the compensation matrix. The axes were transformed using the Biex function with a FlowJo calculated width basis. All gates were set using fluorescence minus one (FMO) controls to exclude non-specific staining (Fig. S1 ) [ ].
Statistical analysis
Data analysis was performed in GraphPad using a two-way ANOVA with a Tukey’s post hoc test. For comparisons between two groups, a two-tailed Student’s t test was utilized. All data is presented as mean ± standard deviation, with statistical significance defined as p < 0.05.
Results
PBMC isolation
Several methods were investigated to determine the optimal rabbit PBMC isolation protocol that maximized yield while minimizing erythrocyte contamination. Density stratification resulted in a higher lymphocyte yield than ACK lysis (Fig. 1 a). However, density stratification also resulted in a significant amount of erythrocyte contamination (Fig. 1 b). A lysis step after density stratification significantly reduced residual erythrocyte contamination without affecting yield and maintained cell viability when compared to density stratification alone (> 90% viability for density stratification or density stratification with lysis) (Fig. 1 c). Based on this data, density stratification followed by lysis was used for PMBC isolation in all subsequent experiments. Fig. 1 Lymphocyte isolation. Yield was significantly higher in density stratification (DS) and density stratification followed by lysis (DSL) than ACK lysis alone ( a ). A lysis step following density stratification (DSL) significantly reduced erythrocyte contamination ( b ) and did not significantly change the number of live lymphocytes ( c ). Bars not connected by the same lower case letter are statistically significantly different ( p < 0.05). Values are expressed as mean ± SD, n = 6 per group, using fresh blood from D0 naïve rabbits
Distribution of T cell subsets in naïve and immunized rabbits
Fresh cells were stained in order to validate the panel design. Different populations of T cells could be clearly elucidated using the developed panel (Fig. 2 a, b). PBMCs from immunized rabbits had a significantly lower proportion of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells than those from naïve rabbits (53.61 ± 1.04 vs 56.95 ± 0.94%, p = 0.02 and 6.56 ± 0.67 vs 9.25 ± 0.11%, p = 0.003, respectively) (Fig. 2 c, d). However, all other T cell subtypes were unaffected by immunization state ( p > 0.05). Additionally, no significant differences in MFI were identified between naïve and immunized rabbits, regardless of T cell subtype ( p > 0.05). Fig. 2 Lymphocyte subtype population percentages in freshly isolated rabbit cells. Rabbit PBMCs were isolated and stained for the surface and nuclear markers shown in Table 1 ( a , b ). There was a significant decrease in percentage of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in immunized rabbits compared to naive rabbits ( c , d ), but no difference in CD4 + CD25 + or CD4 + CD25 + FOXP3 + T cells ( e , f ). Bars not connected by the same lower case letter are statistically significantly different ( p < 0.05). APC = Allophycocyanin, APC-Cy7 = Allophycocyanin-Cyanine7, PE = Phycoerythrin, PE-TxRed = Phycoerythrin-Texas Red. Values are expressed as mean ± SD, n = 6 per group
Effect of cell culture on T cell subsets and surface marker intensity
While culture conditions for rabbit T cell proliferation have been studied [ ], effect of round-bottomed plates on proliferation potential has not been examined. Gating for proliferation studies was determined from the freshly stained cell histogram (Fig. 3 a). When naive PBMCs were cultured in a 96-well round-bottom plate (Fig. 3 b), lymphocytes were unable to retain their CTV, and while the area under the curve was different for unstimulated and stimulated cells, the percent of the population that demonstrated reduced CTV staining was indistinguishable between culture conditions. Culture using flat-bottomed plates resulted in CTV histograms with clear distinctions between the two culture conditions (Fig. 3 c) and consequently flat-bottomed plates were used for all subsequent studies. Fig. 3 Effect of T cell culture conditions on proliferation. Unstimulated cells were utilized to determine maximal CTV intensity and as a gating control ( a ). PBMCs stained with CTV were cultured in round bottom ( b ) or flat bottom plates ( c ). Live, singlet, T lymphocytes were gated on and data shown are representative histograms from each culture condition. When cultured in round bottom plates, proliferation profiles of unstimulated cells (blue) and concavalin A stimulated cells (red) were almost identical ( b ). When cells were cultured in flat bottomed plates, a distinct separation between stimulated and unstimulated cells was observed ( c )
Since T cell proliferation studies require in vitro culture, the effect of culture on T cell subtype distribution and surface marker intensity was investigated. Regardless of rabbit immunizations status, cell culture decreased the CD4 + T cell population (55.27 ± 2.36 vs 42.25 ± 3.33%, p = 0.008) (Fig. 4 a) and surface marker intensity (MFI 413 ± 31 vs 364 ± 8, p = 0.04) (Fig. 4 b), compared to fresh cells. In contrast, the CD8 + population increased in culture (7.91 ± 1.89 vs 14.99 ± 2.44%, p = 0.0004) (Fig. 4 c), with a small decrease in surface marker intensity (MFI 168 ± 20 vs 142 ± 10, p = 0.005) (Fig. 4 d). Culture also decreased the double positive CD25 + FOXP3 + population (14.06 ± 3.64 vs 5.56 ± 6.98%, p = 0.0006) (Fig. 5 a), but increased transcription factor intensity (MFI 30 ± 2 vs 900 ± 431, p = 0.006) (Fig. 5 b) compared to fresh cells. Fig. 4 Effect of cell culture and stimulation on CD4 + and CD8 + distribution and intensity. Freshly isolated cells (fresh) were compared to cells that had been cultured (cultured) and cells that had been cultured with concavalin A (stimulated) ( a – d ). Independent of immunization status, CD4 + T cells decreased with culture but increased with stimulation compared to fresh ( a ), the same occurred with CD4 MFI ( b ) (square brackets). Independent of immunization status, CD8 + T cells increased when cultured compared to fresh cells; stimulation decreased this population compared to culture ( c ) (square brackets). CD8 MFI decreased with culture but increased with stimulation, with no difference between fresh and stimulated cells ( d ) (square brackets). Regardless of cell preparation state, there was a larger population of CD8 + T cells in naïve rabbits compared to immunized rabbits ( p = 0.03) (indicated by a′ and b′). Bars not connected by the same lower case letter are statistically significantly different ( p < 0.05) and square brackets with stars indicate statistical differences between culture conditions (* < 0.05, ** < 0.01, *** < 0.005, **** < 0.0001). Values are expressed as mean ± SD, n = 6 per group Fig. 5 Effect of cell culture and stimulation on T-regulatory cells. Freshly isolated cells (fresh) were compared to cells that had been cultured (cultured) and cells that had been cultured with concavalin A (stimulated) ( a , b ). Independent of immunization state, cultured and stimulated cells both had fewer double positive cells, but higher FOXP3 intensity than fresh cells ( a ) (square brackets). Independent of culture conditions, FOXP3 intensity was higher in the immunized rabbits’ CD4 + CD25 + FOXP3 + T cells compared to naïve rabbit cells ( p = 0.02) (indicated by a′ and b′). Bars not connected by the same lower case letter are statistically significantly different ( p < 0.05) and square brackets with stars indicate statistical differences between culture conditions (* < 0.05, ** < 0.01, *** < 0.005, **** < 0.0001). Values are expressed as mean ± SD, n = 6 per group
Effect of stimulation and immunization on T cell subsets
ConA stimulation was utilized to determine the ability of rabbit lymphocytes to respond appropriately to mitogenic stimulation and examine the effect of stimulation on T cell subtype distribution and marker profiles. ConA was sufficient to induce proliferation of 60–90% of T lymphocytes. For naïve rabbits, stimulation maintained the CD4 + population compared to fresh cells (56.95 ± 3.27 vs 64.77 ± 8.92%, p = 0.199), abrogating the decrease associated with culture alone (Fig. 4 a). Additionally, CD4 intensity increased following stimulation of naïve cells (MFI 514 ± 113) compared to either cultured (MFI 358 ± 50, p = 0.0001) or fresh (MFI 435 ± 13, p = 0.008) cells, respectively (Fig. 4 b). For immunized rabbits, stimulation expanded the CD4 + T cells beyond that of fresh cells (72.84 ± 11.32 vs 53.61 ± 3.63%, p = 0.006). CD4 intensity increased following stimulation of immunized rabbit cells (MFI 549 ± 73) compared to either cultured (MFI 369 ± 63, p = 0.0002) or fresh (MFI 391 ± 14, p < 0.0001) cells, respectively (Fig. 4 b).
In contrast, stimulation decreased the CD8 + T cell population compared to cultured cells, both for cells from naïve (16.72 ± 4.22 vs 5.53 ± 3.74%, p < 0.0001) and immunized rabbits (13.27 ± 5.84 vs 4.99 ± 2.38%, p = 0.003) (Fig. 4 c). However, compared to cultured cells, ConA stimulation resulted in a slight increase in CD8 intensity independent of rabbit immunization status (MFI 142 ± 11 vs 171 ± 33, p = 0.01) (Fig. 4 d). Stimulation did not alter T regulatory cell population or transcription factor intensity for either naïve or immunized rabbit cells compared to cultured cells ( p > 0.05) (Fig. 5 a).
Two T cell subsets were altered by immunization, the CD8 + population decreased (10.5 ± 5.69 vs 8.27 ± 4.39%, p = 0.03) (Fig. 4 c), while FOXP3 intensity increased (643 ± 533 vs 994 ± 838, p = 0.02) (Fig. 5 b) compared to naïve rabbits, independent of culture or stimulation condition.
Effect of bovine pericardial re-stimulation
Response to proteins extracted from BP was assessed to determine if T cell recall response differs between naïve versus immunized rabbits. Proliferation was gated using the same method as previously stated (Fig. 3 a). Re-stimulation with BP extract alone did not induce proliferation in either naïve or immunized rabbit cells (Fig. S2 ), which was expected given previous reports in the rabbit of antigen-specific suppression of PBMC proliferation [ ]. Addition of submaximal levels of ConA (0.25 μg/mL) induced increased proliferation response for T cells from immunized rabbits compared naïve rabbits (5.67 ± 2.08 vs − 3.04 ± 1.81%, p = 0.005) (Fig. 6 a). Proliferation was then assessed for CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells separately; both cell types showed similar levels of proliferation when exposed to BP, with slightly greater proliferation in CD4 + T cells (− 3.75 ± 2.72 vs 5.204 ± 3.72, p = 0.0134) (Fig. 6 b) compared to CD8 + T cells (− 2.388 ± 2.29 vs 4.621 ± 5.77, p = 0.0496) (Fig. 6 c). The number of CD4 + T cells expressing CD25 was used to assess level of T cell activation. While there was only a trend toward increased CD4 + CD25 + T cells in immunized compared to naïve rabbits (30.19 ± 12.34 vs 3.58 ± 1.68%, p = 0.076) (Fig. 6 d), these cells had significantly higher intensity of CD25 (MFI 938 ± 128 vs 356 ± 84, p = 0.009) (Fig. 6 e). This increase was independent of CD4 + CD25 + FOXP3 + T cells, since no change in this cell population was identified between immunized and naïve rabbits ( p > 0.05) (Fig. 6 f). However, when specifically looking at the cells that proliferated, the majority were CD4 + T cells instead of CD8 + T cells (77.23 ± 3.95 vs 9.92 ± 1.13%, respectively, p < 0.0001) (Fig. 6 g). This response was monitored during the course of the 84-day immunization scheme and demonstrated that the response increased with time and immunizations reaching its maximum in day 84 cells (Fig. 6 h). Fig. 6 Bovine pericardial re-stimulation in D84 immunized and D0 naïve rabbits. Proliferation response was calculated as the percentage of proliferating T cells following stimulation with BP protein extract minus the percentage proliferating following addition of protein extraction solution alone. T cells from naïve rabbits undergo significantly less proliferation in response to BP stimulation than do those from immunized rabbits ( a ). BP protein extract induced a similar proliferative response in both CD4+ ( b ) and CD8+ T cells ( c ). The higher proliferation in immunized rabbits could be caused by the greater population of CD4 + CD25 + T cells in immunized versus naïve rabbits ( d ), although this finding failed to reach statistical significance ( p = 0.076). However, the intensity of CD25 was greater in the CD4 + CD25 + T cells from immunized compared to naïve rabbits ( e ). There was no significant difference in FOXP3+ cells between naïve and immunized rabbit cells stimulated with BP extract ( p > 0.05) ( f ). When examining the T cells that had proliferated in response to BP from D84 immunized rabbits, they are predominantly CD4 + T cells, with a minority of cells CD8 + T cells ( g ). Timeline of re-stimulation assay, demonstrating that BP protein extract increases T cell proliferation compared to extraction solution only and that this stimulation increases over the 84-day immunization period ( h ) ( p = 0.009). The gray arrows indicate the timing of the BP injections. Bars not connected by the same lower case letter are statistically significantly different ( p < 0.05).

Discussion
The expanding use of BP-based biomaterials has led to increased motivation to examine interactions between the immune system and these antigen-masked or antigen-reduced materials. Several research groups have implicated lymphocytes in the chronic immune response toward BP biomaterials [ , , , , , ]. In the current study, we demonstrated that (1) the fragility of rabbit PBMCs necessitates specific isolation methods to avoid cell death, RBC contamination, or both; (2) specific culture conditions are required to avoid proliferation of non-stimulated cells; (3) rabbit T cell subsets responded appropriately to mitogenic stimulation; (4) re-stimulation with BP requires T cells to be sensitized with submaximal concentrations of ConA; (5) BP re-stimulation results in a CD4 + T cell dominated proliferation response; (6) BP re-stimulation increases both the proportion and individual cell intensity of CD25 in cells from previously exposed rabbits. Together, these findings generate an in vitro proliferation-based screening assay for BP-based biomaterials using modern flow cytometry techniques that can be applied longitudinally in individual animals.
Isolation techniques for human and murine lymphocytes have long been established, but optimal isolation techniques for rabbit cells have had to rely on reagents developed for other species [ ]. Even with rabbit-specific ficoll, there is still significant residual erythrocyte contamination, unlike humans and mice [ , ]. Consequently, a combined approach of density stratification followed by second lysis step that removed residual erythrocytes without decreasing cell viability proved to be optimal for isolation of rabbit lymphocytes. Round-bottomed plates have been successfully implemented in many animal models, because they reduce the required cell number and increase the amount of proliferation toward antigens or cytokines in stimulation assays [ , , , ]. However, in the current study, round bottom plates resulted in the depletion of the proliferation tracking dye in non-stimulated rabbit cells preventing their use in this species. The majority of freshly isolated PBMCs were CD4 + T cells, with a ratio of CD4 + to CD8 + being 6:1 and 9:1 in naïve and immunized rabbits, respectively. This finding differs from T cells isolated from humans, where the ratio is closer to 2:1 [ ]. Both the CD4 + and CD8 + T cells decreased in immunized compared to naïve rabbits, indicating a rise in double negative (CD4 − /CD8 − ) T cells. Potentially, immunization with BP antigens caused molecular mimicry with self-antigens, leading to expansion of the double negative T cell population that has been previously associated with autoimmunity [ ]. However, following maximal non-specific stimulation, the CD4 + population expanded most prominently, which is similar to the response of human cells following lectin-based stimulation [ ]. There were a few differences in the T-regulatory subsets, with a trend toward greater CD25 + and a significant increase in FOXP3 intensity in immunized vs naïve animals. The increase in CD25 + intensity is most likely due to the expected increased immune activation in immunized animals [ ]. Several groups have shown that T-regulatory cells are upregulated after an immune challenge [ , ]. Consequently, this work optimized conditions for rabbit T cell isolation, culture and stimulation, and demonstrates that rabbit T cell response to mitogenic stimulation and immunization in a similar manner to that reported for human cells.
BP extract alone was not sufficient to induce a proliferative response. In fact, BP extract inhibited proliferation compared to extraction solution alone, potentially due to the presence of tissue-related anti-inflammatory cytokines [ ]. Even in animals that had been immunized, there was no response to BP extract alone. Previous research has reported “suppressive cells” inhibiting the clonal expansion of antigen-specific T cells in the peripheral blood; however, the suppressive cells were never phenotyped [ ]. Our experiments showed that there was an increase in the intensity of FOXP3 in cultured cells and that immunized rabbits had an even higher intensity than naïve rabbits. These suppressive cells were most likely T-regulatory cells acting as a barrier to antigen-specific T cell activation [ ]. Consequently, it was necessary to add a submaximal level of ConA to overcome this anti-inflammatory environment and boost the proliferative ability of BP-specific T cells.
The hypothesis that BP protein extract would result in differential stimulation of immunized versus naïve rabbit cells was supported by the BP re-stimulation experiments. Absence of response of naïve rabbit cells following BP stimulation is presumably due to the low level of antigen-specific precursor T cells in naïve animals. The proliferative response of immunized rabbit T cells increased over the 84-day immunization scheme and with each immunization booster, which is an expected memory T cell response [ ]; however, development of memory T cells cannot be confirmed using the markers available in the panel. Following immunization (D0), an initial increase in proliferative response was identified which was indicative of an acute cell-mediated response. As expected, this T cell response initially decreased following this initial acute naïve response, but increased following each successive boost [ , ] and ultimately continued to rise and become a chronic reaction from D42 onwards. These results are in agreement with previous assessments of rabbit humoral immune response toward BP antigenicity, which similarly demonstrated increasing graft-specific IgG production over time [ , , ]. Furthermore, while both CD4 and CD8 T cells responded similarly to BP re-stimulation, the majority of proliferating cells in immunized rabbits following BP re-stimulation were CD4 + T cells. Considering the route of immunization and type of antigen, CD4 + T cells would be expected to comprise the predominant cell-mediated recall response during a re-stimulation assay [ , ]. This would also explain why the immunized animals had a smaller proportion of CD8 + T cells. More CD4 + cells from immunized rabbits that proliferated in response to BP were positive for CD25 and had higher CD25 + intensity compared to naïve cells. There was no difference in FOXP3 intensity between naïve and immunized rabbits, indicating that the increase in CD25 intensity was not connected to an increase in T-regulatory cell presence, which is seen in humans as well [ ]. Consequently, we conclude that the increase in CD25, a high affinity IL-2 receptor and a marker of activation [ , ], was the mechanism behind the enhanced proliferation in immunized rabbits. Given the time of exposure and number of boosting immunizations, these results demonstrate that chronic graft-specific T cell responses toward BP are dominated by CD4 + T cells and increased CD25 intensity.
Rabbits have become increasingly popular as an animal model [ ] with growing interest in their immune system [ ], and as such, work needs to be done to provide more in-depth information about the phenotype of their T cell populations. Historically, flow cytometry has been limited in rabbits due to limited availability of reagents in this species. Therefore, the purpose of this paper was to not only illustrate the growing body of rabbit reagents, but to also demonstrate that a complex T cell panel with minimal overlap can be made using commercially available products and provide a foundation for characterizing rabbit T cell responses toward clinically relevant heart valve biomaterials. Since rabbit T cells can be re-stimulated in culture with BP protein extract, this demonstrates the utility of this assay as an in vitro screening tool for assessment of graft-specific cell-mediated immune responses. While there are differences in the human and lagomorph immune system [ ], a risk taken with any small animal model, a major benefit to this model is that it can be extrapolated into a surgical model for future implantation studies [ ]. Most importantly, this work may have utility toward understanding graft-specific cell-mediated immune response toward decellularized/antigen-removed biomaterials and potentially determining residual biomaterial antigenicity prior to in vivo implantation of such heart valve biomaterials in human patients [ , , , , , , ].
