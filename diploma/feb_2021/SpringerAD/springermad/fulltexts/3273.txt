INTRODUCTION
Abuse deterrent formulations (ADFs) have been developed in the past decade to help curtail the rise of prescription drug misuse and abuse ( , , , , ). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has supported and encouraged the development of these formulations as indicated by the release of its guidance entitled “Abuse-Deterrent Opioids - Evaluation and Labeling” in April of 2015 and the draft guidance entitled “General Principles for Evaluating the Abuse Deterrence of Generic Solid Oral Opioid Drug Products” for generic drug products in March of 2016 ( , ). Currently, the techniques available or under development for ADFs include the following: a physical/chemical barrier, pro-drug approach, agonist/antagonist combination, inclusion of an aversive agent, depot/implant delivery systems, and new technologies such as ion exchange resins or combinations of the above ( , ). The first product to receive abuse deterrence labeling claims was OxyContin® in 2010 which uses a physical barrier matrix. Since 2010, the FDA has approved nine more abuse deterrent products that implement various technologies and techniques. These products are TARGINIQ™ (oxycodone HCl and naloxone HCl) extended-release (ER) tablet ( ), Embeda® (morphine sulfate and naltrexone hydrochloride) ER capsule ( ), Hysingla™ (hydrocodone bitartrate) ER tablet ( , ), Morphabond™ (morphine sulfate) ER tablet ( ), Xtampza™ (hydrocodone hydrochloride) ER capsule ( , ), Troxyca® (oxycodone HCl and naltrexone HCl) ER capsule ( ), Arymo® (Morphine Sulfate) ER tablet, Vantrela®(hydrocodone bitartrate) ER tablet, and most recently, RoxyBond™ (Oxycodone HCl) immediate-release tablet.
Physical barrier type ADFs are designed to make crushing, grating, grinding, chewing, cutting, or any form of solid oral dosage form reduction time consuming and difficult. In addition, even if abusers are successful at reducing the tablet, exposure of the resulting particles to moisture will result in the formation of a polymer gel making drug extraction difficult, parenteral injection deadly and nasal insufflation much less desirable. Specifically, regarding nasal insufflation deterrence, a bioadhesive can retard the absorption of the drug by increasing the residence time of the formulation and its aversive agents in the nasal mucosa ( , ). Depending on the polymer used in the formulation, this increased residence time can reduce mucociliary clearance and act as a controlled release agent thereby reducing the release and extending the absorption time of the drug. Many ADFs, such as OxyContin®, use polyethylene oxide (PEO) to create these physical barrier properties ( , ). There are other physical barrier products such as Xtampza™ that implement a waxy resin multiparticulate system ( , ). If the beads are crushed, the drug-loaded waxy ion exchange resin still maintains controlled release of the drug.
Currently, most investigations examine the overall strategies for what should be assessed in an ADF, but the actual in vitro experimental methods which are relevant to real abuse situations need further development. In theory, there are an infinite number of ways an abuser can manipulate a product; thus, to limit the number of tests that could be done in a reproducible manner to a manageable number of tests, Edward Cone first suggested an iterative approach to assess abuse deterrent formulations ( ). Xu et al. suggested a risk based approach that accounts for the probability of an abuse approach and severity of harm for each mode of abuse ( ). An “Extractability Rating System” to standardize testing and reporting of extraction studies done on abuse deterrent opioids was conducted by Katz et al. ( ). Butler et al. developed a 17-item opioid attractiveness scale that monitors abuse potential liability based on both intrinsic physiochemical properties of the opioid and extrinsic factors such as cost and availability of the drug ( ). Factoring the amount of time and effort required to abuse a formulation was proposed by Cone et al. ( ). While such work provides a strategic framework for how to assess an abuse deterrent formulation, the actual analytical methodology to perform these manipulations still needs research. For example, several publications investigate the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, safety, and abuse potential of an abuse deterrent product in vivo . The methods qualitatively describe tablets being ground into “fine” and “coarse” particles ( , , ). Having a comminution method that can apply a consistent amount of force to the tablets followed by the careful characterization of the comminuted particle size will provide more information about the effects of abuser behavior on nasal absorption. For example, Vosberg et al. characterized the particle size of the manipulated tablets in their vivo studies comparing tamper and non-tamper resistant formulations ( ); with this added information, they were able to show that particle size can affect a participant’s willingness to snort the resulting particles. This shows the value of including particle size characterization as an in vitro testing parameter.
For physical barrier type formulations, an in vitro test would be valuable to assess and compare how different formulations can influence the release of the drug if it were to be successfully manipulated by an abuser and insufflated. Snorting an opioid formulation is popular because drugs are quickly absorbed intranasally due to the high permeability of the nasal epithelium ( , ). Mucociliary clearance can have a large impact on the intranasal absorption of a drug. For intranasal absorption, the drug-containing particle has on average a 12–15-min absorption window before it is cleared by the mucocilia ( , ). However, incorporation of a bioadhesive agent, such as PEO, can extend the residence of the drug particles for up to 6 h ( ). The mucociliary clearance is also dependent on the site of deposition in the nasal cavity; the posterior and middle turbinate contain ciliated epithelium whereas the anterior turbinate does not have cilia. Therefore, drug has a slower clearance if it lands on the anterior region of the nose ( ). In addition, the nasal cavity has a high humidity and the nasal surfaces are fully hydrated ( , ). While a completely representative in vitro model of nasal absorption that is reproducible and practical is not currently available; in vitro test methods should try and account for as many of the anatomical features of the nasal cavity as possible.
In this study, we examined the use of a vertical diffusion cell (VDC) in the measurement of drug release from comminuted tablets with ADF properties. Diffusion cells are described in the literature to reproducibly assess formulation differences in nasal absorption drug delivery ( , , ). The novelty of our approach is that the comminuted particles are non-solvated, i.e. , dry, when presented to a wetted cellulose membrane. Traditionally, nasal absorption studies present the drug in a liquid formulation or fully hydrated gel or cream; however, for abuse deterrent applications, these methods do not account for the effects of polymer transformation from its dry state to hydrated state ( ). Polymer hydration and swelling have been shown to be important steps in the release of drug from delivery systems such as tablets ( , , ). This is important because when the dry powder contacts the wet membrane, the polymer in the formulation begins to swell forming a gel. This series of events is representative of what would occur in the actual abuse scenario where dry particles are snorted and the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) would be released in parallel with particle hydration and gel formation. Thus, the drug would experience different rates of release depending on the stage of gel formation and API entrapment in the gel.
To better understand the effect of formulation factors on drug release from ADF, different metoprolol tartrate tablets were produced based in part on the excipients used in the commercially available OxyContin® formulation. In our formulations, the model drug metoprolol tartrate was blended with polyethylene oxide and compressed. The resulting tablets were sintered at 80 °C for 30 min to enhance the mechanical strength of the tablets as reported in the patent for ADF OxyContin® ( ). The metoprolol tartrate tablets were manipulated under three different types of mechanical stresses that are typical of routine household items commonly used by abusers; these forces were grinding, cutting, and milling. The particle size distribution of comminuted tablets was characterized. Then, the release of drug from the resulting particles was measured. The same test was applied to abuse deterrent OxyContin® and another drug product, Opana®. Opana® does not have an abuse deterrent labeling claim but exhibits similar properties as OxyContin®. Thus, the objective of this study was to compare how factors such as tablet composition and porosity and different modes of tablet comminution affect the resulting particle size distribution and then determine how these factors will affect the drug release from the ADF or the tablet formulations made with ADF-like properties.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
Polyethylene oxide (PEO) (POLYOXWSR 303–NF, Lot#2D1555S5R4, DOW Chemical, Midland, MI) and PEO (POLYOX WSR N12K–NF, Lot#212455S5L2, DOW Chemical, Midland, MI, Lot#212455S5L2), metoprolol tartrate (Lot#238006495, Assia Chemical Industries, Be’er Sheva, Israel), and magnesium stearate (MgSt) 2256 (Lot#L06615 Macron Chemicals, Center Valley, PA) were used. Lactose (Supertab ZLAN, Lot#10361059, DFE Pharma, Germany), cornstarch (Lot#M4316, Roquette, France), and croscarmellose cellulose (Aci-Di-Sol SD-711, Lot#TN09820745, FMC, Philadelphia, PA) were used as well. OxyContin® CII, 80 mg (Lot#WSD80A, Purdue Pharma LP Stamford, CT), Opana® ER 40 mg (Lot#B13046A, Endo Pharmaceuticals, Chadds Ford, PA), neat oxycodone HCl (Lot#13BW240, Noramco, Wilmington, DE), and neat oxymorphone HCl (Lot#14LW493, Noramco, Wilmington, DE) were also used. OxyContin® 80 mg drug product consists of active ingredient oxycodone hydrochloride and other generally regarded as safe (GRAS) excipients (butylated hydroxytoluene, polyethylene glycol 400, PEO, magnesium stearate, hypromellose, titanium dioxide, hydroxypropyl cellulose, yellow iron oxide, and FD&C Blue #2/Indigo Carmine Aluminum Lake). Opana® 40 mg consists of oxymorphone active and other GRAS excipients (hypromellose, PEO, polyethylene glycol, alpha-tocopherol, citric acid, polyvinyl alcohol, titanium dioxide, macrogol, talc). Properties of all three API used in this study are shown in Table I . Spectra/Por® (Lot# 9200225 Spectrum Laboratories, Inc., Rancho Dominguez, CA) cellulose dialysis tubing with a molecular weight cutoff of 12,000 to 14,000 was used.

Methods
Blending
The batch size of the simulated ADF metoprolol tartrate drug product was 100 g. For each blend, the metoprolol tartrate (30% w / w ) and polyethylene oxide (70% w / w ), either 7E 6 or 1E 6 molecular weight, were co-sieved through a #30 mesh (595 μm) screen. The mixture was vigorously premixed by hand for 2 min. The blend was transferred to a 0.75 quart V-Blender (Paterson Kelley) and blended for 12 min. The MgSt (0.5% w / w ) was added to the blender and blended for two additional minutes. For the immediate-release (IR) blend, sieved metoprolol tartrate (30% w / w ), lactose (45.5% w / w ), corn starch (22% w / w ), and croscarmellose (2% w / w ) were hand blended for 2 min before blending in the 0.75 quart V-Blender for 12 min. The MgSt (0.5% w / w ) was added to the blender and blended for two additional minutes.
Preparation of Metoprolol Tablets
The above metoprolol-PEO blends were compacted into tablets with 10 mm B type-standard flat faced tooling (Natoli, Saint Charles, MO) using a single station hydraulic press (Carver, Model# 3851-0, Wabash, IN) (dwell time = 1 min). A 350-mg tablet weight was selected. For the 7E 6 M W PEO tablets, a 4- and 9.3-kN compression force was used to target 20 and 10% porosity tablets, respectively. For the 1E 6 MW PEO tablets, a 4-kN compression force was used to target a 20% porosity and 11.6 kN was used to make 10% porosity tablets. The tablets were then sintered in an oven for 30 min at 80 °C to increase tablet strength. For the IR tablets, a 22.2-kN compression force was used to achieve 10% porosity.
Gel Preparation
The effect of PEO hydration on drug release was tested with gels containing metoprolol tartrate, and the gels were designated as a tertiary control to the neat API and IR tablets. Two gels were made; one with 1E 6 M w PEO and one with 7E 6 M w PEO. A 30 mg/mL metoprolol tartrate aqueous solution was first prepared. Using an overhead mixer (Model RW-20, IKA, Wilmington, NC), PEO was slowly added to the solution while mixing until a solution viscosity of 300 cP was obtained. Solution viscosity was measured using a cone and plate rheometer (DVIII Ultra, Brookfield Ametek, Middleboro, MA) with a cone spindle (CPA-40Z, Brookfield Ametek, Middleboro, MA). The calibration was done using B29 standard reference solution (Lot#15101, Brookfield Ametek, Middleboro, MA). The viscosity of the gels was measured at a shear rate setting of 2 RPM at 25 °C.
True Density and Porosity
The true density of each powder blend was measured using a helium pycnometer (Accupyc 1330, Micromeritics, Norcross, GA). The particle densities were measured as the average of three replicates (5 repetitive purge cycles for each sample) and were used in the calculation of compression parameters to obtain the desired tablet porosity. The porosity of all tablets was calculated using the equation: $$ \epsilon =1-\left(\frac{M_{tab}}{\rho_{true}{V}_{tab}}\right) $$ (1) where M tab is the tablet mass, V tab is the tablet volume, and ρ true is the true density of the material obtained with the Accupyc.
Mechanical Manipulation
Three different mechanical manipulation methods were selected: milling (coffee grinder with binary metal blade), grinding (abrasion with sandpaper using a rotary tool), and cutting (cutting by hand with diagonal cutters) to simulate abuser behavior and represent the range of forces that could be applied to an ADF. For each formulation and manipulation method, ten tablets were tested. For milling, one tablet at a time was placed in a coffee mill (Type 203 B, KRUPS, Millville, NJ) rated for 160 W (60 Hz) with a 35-mm radius blade (from center to tip) that had one blade curved up and the other blade curved down. The tablet was milled continuously for 1 min at 19,600 RPM. The RPM of an empty mill was measured using a tachometer (Model HT-4100, Distek, Township, NJ). The resulting milled particles were collected by turning the mill upside down and tapping the sides until no more powder came out; this was done to simulate user behavior. The particles were stored in a tightly sealed glass vial at room temperature for diffusion studies. The mill was thoroughly cleaned between each sample to prevent carry over.
For grinding, a rotary tool (10,000 RPM, setting 1) (MultiPro 7.2 V Model #770, DREMEL, Mount Prospect, IL) equipped with a 240-grit, 0.61-cm diameter sand drum (B00C050TWC, TEMO) was used. A new sanding drum was used for each tablet manipulation to prevent carryover and to ensure optimal consistency of sanding area and texture. Each tablet was held with forceps over a beaker to collect the particles; all studies were done in a fume hood. The tablet was continuously repositioned during the grinding to allow the rotary tool to grind the tablet effectively. The time to grind the tablet until the forceps could no longer hold the intact particle was recorded.
For cutting, diagonal cutting pliers (Crescent®, 2.3-cm cutting length, 11.5-cm handle length, Sparks, MD) were used. The number of cuts made within 5 min was recorded. The tablets were first cut in half; then, each half piece was cut into thirds. Then, each third was cut into as many pieces as possible. To prevent the coffee mill and rotary tool motors from overheating and to prevent hand fatigue, the manipulation method was rotated through the sample set so a tablet was milled, then another tablet was ground and then another tablet was cut. The same procedure for the OxyContin® and Opana® tablets was used, but the coating for each product was removed first by gently sanding it off with a 100-grit sanding paper. The IR tablets were ground in a mortar and pestle to produce a fine powder.
The percent recovery after each manipulation was recorded to determine the variability and reproducibility associated with each manipulation. The percent recovery was calculated as follows: $$ \%\mathrm{Recovery}=100\ast \frac{W_b}{W_a} $$ (2) where W a is the weight of tablet before manipulation and W b is the weight of the comminuted particles collected after manipulation.
Assay
Metoprolol Tartrate Blend Assay
Content uniformity of the metoprolol tartrate blends was assayed by UV-vis (Model#1700, Shimadzu, Columbia, MD) by a single point calibration at 273 nm. For the metoprolol-PEO blends, a 0.25 mg/mL metoprolol tartrate stock solution was prepared with 70% w / w PEO added as solution background and was used as the single point calibration. For the IR blend, a 0.25 mg/mL metoprolol tartrate aqueous stock solution was used for the single point calibration. The absorbance of three different samples of the standard was measured. Solutions were prepared for the blend samples by sampling from five discrete locations in the bag. The sample was dissolved to a theoretical concentration of 0.25 mg/mL metoprolol tartrate. The absorbance of each solution was measured in triplicate and the actual concentration was calculated and percent metoprolol calculated for all five samples.
Tablet Assay
An HPLC (Shimadzu SPD 10A detector and SCL pump, Shimadzu, Columbia, MD) equipped with a RP 18, 5 μm, 4.6 × 150.0 mm column (XTerra, Waters, Milford, MA) was used to assay the concentration of API in each sample for each time point in the diffusion studies. Assay methods were based upon the USP monographs for Metoprolol Tartrate Tablets and Oxycodone Hydrochloride and a publication by Hussain for oxymorphone HCl ( ) . The UV wavelength was set to 273, 280, and 283 nm for metoprolol tartrate, oxycodone HCl, and oxymorphone HCl, respectively. The mobile phase for oxycodone HCl was prepared using the same mobile phase listed for oxymorphone HCl ( ). The retention times for metoprolol tartrate, oxycodone HCl, and oxymorphone HCl were as follows: 3.7, 4, and 5.1 min. The calibration curve for all drugs consisted of a 2-mg/mL stock solutions with direct stock dilutions of 1.5, 0.75, 0.2, 0.15, 0.05, and 0.01 mg/mL The calibration curve of Y = 3,825,780 x − 2604; R 2 = 0.999 was acquired for metoprolol tartrate. The calibration curve for oxycodone HCl was Y = 2999,200 x − 6402; R 2 = 0.999. The calibration curve for oxymorphone HCl was Y = 3,085,565 x − 10,598.1; R 2 = 0.999.
Particle Size Analysis
Particle size data was measured with a dry powder dispersion laser diffraction instrument (Scirroco 2000, Malvern, Malvern, PA) equipped with a dry powder feeder accessory. Particle size test conditions were optimized for each type of comminuted tablet. The test conditions for the ground and milled samples were set at 50% vibratory feed rate, and 3.5-bar air pressure. Care was taken to prevent particle milling and deformation in the lense during dry dispersion thus more conservative test conditions were chosen for the cut particles. The test conditions for the cut samples were set to 30% vibratory feed rate and 3 bar air pressure. The particle size analysis was done using the Fraunhofer model.
Diffusion Studies
API release was measured using a 7-mL glass vertical diffusion cell (Hanson Research Co., Chatsworth, CA). A cellulose membrane was used as the membrane barrier between receiver and donor compartments. The cellulose membrane was soaked in phosphate buffer (PBS) pH 6.4 for 12 h before the study to hydrate the membrane. PBS buffer pH 6.4 was also used as the receiver solution to match the pH of the adult nasal mucosa and the water circulator (Model#58-001-430, Polyscience, Niles, IL) was maintained at 37 ± 0.5°C ( ). A helix stir bar was placed in the receiver solution and rotated at 450 RPM. The membrane was then placed on the diffusion cell, and allowed to equilibrate with the receiver medium for 1 h prior to the sample being introduced. The release of drug from all samples was measured in triplicate where each replicate was taken from three different manipulated tablets. The amount of sample placed on the membrane was equivalent to 10 mg of API for each sample and leveled with a spatula. A cover was then placed over the donor compartment to maintain the sample humidity. For the prepared gel samples, a 100 μL aliquot of gel formulation equivalent to 10 mg of API was dispensed on the membrane using an automatic pipette. Sampling occurred at 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, and 300 min. At each sampling time point, 5.8 mL of fresh receiver solution displaced 5.8 mL of solution in the receiver compartment of the cell to maintain sink conditions. The first 2 mL of receiver solution displaced was discarded and the remainder of the sampling volume was collected for assay by HPLC.
Statistical Analysis
Study Design
Independent variables in this study were molecular weight of PEO (1E 6 M w or 7E 6 M w PEO) and tablet porosity (20 or 10%) to produce four different formulation combinations. The four formulations had three different treatments applied, considered as such the comminution method employed (cutting, grinding, milling). The dependent variables consisted of the particle size distribution of the comminuted tablet, and the diffusional release of the API from the comminuted tablet. A two-way ANOVA analysis was implemented with the significance threshold set at p < 0.05 for the ρ-values; this value was used to determine the significance of the milling method used, the effect of formulation factors on resulting particle size of comminuted tablets, and the API release constant to characterize API release from the various PEO matrices. A Tukey post hoc analysis was further applied at a 0.05 threshold to compare the significance of initial tablet porosity on the resulting comminuted tablet particle size.
Dissolution f2-Similarity Test for Drug Release Comparisons
The f 2 -test was used to assess the similarities in the cumulative percent release of the diffusion curves, see FDA guidance ( ). The f 2 values were calculated using $$ {f}_2=50\ast \log \left[{\left[1+\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)\sum \limits_{t=1}^n{\left({R}_t-{T}_t\right)}^2\right]}^{-0.5}\ast 100\ \right] $$ (3) where n is the number of time points, R t is the percent released of the reference sample at time t , and T t is the percent released for the test sample at time t . An f 2 that is greater or equal to 50 implies that the two cumulative release curves are similar and a value less than 50 demonstrates the curves are not similar.
Release Constant
The release constant can be determined from the slope of the regression of cumulative API release per surface area, Q , vs t : $$ Q=\left[{C}_NV+{\sum}_{i=1}^{N-1}{C}_iS\right]/A $$ (4) and C i is the concentration of API at the i th time interval, N is the total number of time intervals, V is the volume of the receiver compartment, A is the surface area of the membrane, and S is the sample aliquot volume ( ).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
The results of this present study focus on characterizing the processes that occur before an end user abuses the product by nasal insufflation and then how the drug is released from the comminuted dosage form. First, the manipulation method employed to break down a pharmaceutical tablet is assessed, then the resulting particle size distribution is characterized and finally API cumulative release and release kinetics from the comminuted dosage form are determined.
A complete evaluation of an abuse deterrent formulation should take into consideration the known routes of abuse for the non-abuse deterrent drug product predecessor. Evaluation should also anticipate the effect that deterring abuse by one route may shift abuse to another possible riskier route or riskier end user behavior as was the case with the recent outbreak of AIDS related to increased injection of Opana® ( ). While this study focuses exclusively on evaluating tablets prepared for nasal insufflation, research related to this project that investigates these products for other routes of abuse are published separately ( ).
Manipulation Method Characterization
Table II describes the metoprolol, oxymorphone (Opana®), and oxycodone (OxyContin®) samples used in the tablet comminution and diffusion studies. The percent recovery for each type of tablet manipulation is shown in Fig. 1 . For the cut samples, the percent of dosage form recovered was between 98 and 100% for all sample types. For the ground and milled samples, the percent recovery varied from 72 to 84%. For high porosity metoprolol tartrate tablets, the percent recovery ranged from 75 to 77%, and for low porosity metoprolol tablets, the percent recovery was 84% for milled samples compared to 72% for ground samples. For grinding, OxyContin® and Opana® yielded a 70 and 73% recovery, respectively, which is slightly lower than the metoprolol tablets. The percent recovery for milled drug product is greater than for the ground tablets.

Drug products are designated as CD for OxyContin® and MR for Opana® followed by G, M, or C for the respective manipulation used for the samples
The error associated with percent recovery provides an indication of how reproducible the manipulation method was. The cutting method produced a 2% standard deviation as calculated from the ten tablets tested for metoprolol, OxyContin®, and Opana®. In contrast, milling and grinding produced a higher standard deviation for percent recovery that varied depending on the tablet type. For grinding, the standard deviation was 5, 9, and 12% for the metoprolol, OxyContin®, and Opana®, respectively, and for milling the recovery standard deviation was 5, 3, and 1% for metoprolol, OxyContin®, and Opana®, respectively. The larger range and upper maximum demonstrated higher variability with the grinding manipulation method. This implies that an abuser would not experience a consistent dosing each time they abuse a tablet.
The number of cuts made in 5 min and manipulation time was used to characterize cutting and grinding, respectively (see Fig. 2 a, b). The number of times the tablet was cut in 5 min offers an indication of how resistant an abuse deterrent tablet is to comminution by cutting. A high cut number indicates a weaker tablet that is more readily broken down by the applied cutting shear force. For instance, the number of cuts made in 5 min for Opana® was significantly lower than for OxyContin®, see Fig. 2 a, indicating that it is much more difficult to reduce Opana® using diagonal pliers. In addition, more cuts of the metoprolol tartrate tablets were counted in the 5-min period compared to OxyContin® and Opana®, which demonstrates these tablets were not able to resist shear force from diagonal cutters as well as the drug products. In addition, the cut number percent relative standard deviation (RSD) ranged from 5 to 11% RSD for the different samples which offers some level of precision to the method. In contrast, the time to grind the tablets (Fig. 2 b) had a 15 to 30% RSD across the different sample types; the high % RSD is a disadvantage of this characterization method.

Particle Size of Comminuted Tablets
One key question in assessing an ADF is whether formulation variables or comminution technique used is more critical in controlling the particle size of the resulting comminuted tablet? This is an important question because differences in comminution approaches can overwhelm formulation differences. The particle size distributions for all comminuted samples were mono modal and normally distributed with very minor distribution tails. Table II shows the D(V, 0.5) and span value for each type of sample.
Figure 3 a, b shows a box plot for the formulation type and manipulation method, respectively. These figures indicate that the metoprolol formulations produce smaller particles when comminuted, while the OxyContin® and Opana® produced relatively larger particles. Fig. 3 b indicates that the method of comminution had the largest impact on the final particle size of the manipulated tablet. To analyze the data, a two-way ANOVA test with interaction terms was done using the R software program. The mechanical manipulation technique had significant (ρ < 0.0001) impact on the resulting particle size distribution. The formulation type and interaction terms were also significant, but had a larger p value than the manipulation technique. As shown by Fig. 3 a, much of the formulation significance resulted from the differences between the metoprolol tartrate tablets and marketed drug product Opana® and OxyContin®. Fig. 3 Box plots for the collective particle size of all manipulation methods for each sample type ( a ) and the particle size for all samples produced by each manipulation method ( b ). Samples are notated by AB where A represents the polymer molecular weight of 1E 6 (1) or 7E 6 (7) and B the porosity level of high (H) or low (L) porosity. Drug products are designated as CD for OxyContin® and MR for Opana®
To study the effect of initial porosity and PEO molecular weight, Opana® and OxyContin® were removed from the two-way ANOVA analysis with interaction terms. The formulation type and manipulation technique were still significant, but the Tukey post hoc analysis showed that only the 7H/1H, 7H/1L, and 7L/7H comparisons were significant with p values of 0.0048, 0.00001, and 0.001, respectively. These results imply that the difference in PEO molecular weight and initial tablet porosity do not always have an impact on the resulting particle size of the comminuted metoprolol tartrate tablets. The manipulation technique used to reduce the particle size was always significant.
Generally, the high porosity tablets 7HM, 1HM, 7HC, and 1HC appeared to have smaller particle size than the low porosity tablets 7LM, 1LM, 7LC, and 1LC, see Table II . When compared in a t test, however, the difference was only significant between the 7HM/7LM and 7HC/7LC comparisons. The difference in particle size was not significant for the 1HM/1LM and 1HC/1LC comparisons. The metoprolol tablets that were ground did not have observable and/or significant differences in particle size between tablets with high and low initial porosity with the same molecular weight of PEO (1E 6 or 1E 7 ). It is possible that the tablets with a high initial porosity that were reduced to a significantly smaller size compared to tablets with low initial tablet porosity occurred because high porosity tablets would have less internal bonding between the particles as compared to tablets with low initial porosity. These effects were also most likely considered significant in the tablets made with 7E 6 because of differences in sintering mechanisms. It was shown by Boyce et al. that the final tablet strength after sintering is effected by the initial tablet strength ( ). While the authors did not investigate the effect of PEO molecular weight on sintering outcomes, it is possible that the molecular weight of PEO may exhibit different viscoelastic flow patterns during sintering which could explain why differences were only significant when 7E 6 M w PEO was used. Finally, the particle size difference between ground metoprolol tartrate tablets, ground Opana® and ground OxyContin® were considered insignificant by the t test. These observations demonstrate that initial tablet characteristics are not a significant factor when a manipulation technique involves high intensity shearing such as grinding . This observation is consistent with the literature where the ability of a material to be reduced is dependent not only on the material’s intrinsic properties but also the manner ( e.g. , tool selected and settings) in which size reduction is achieved ( ).
Characterization of API Release and Kinetics from Manipulated Tablets
In this section, the release of drug from the manipulated tablets obtained from the diffusion studies will be discussed. The cumulative release of oxycodone HCl from comminuted OxyContin® (Fig. 4 a), oxymorphone HCl from comminuted Opana® (Fig. 4 b), and metoprolol tartrate from the comminuted tablet formulations with 1E 6 M w PEO (Fig. 5 a) and with 7E 6 M w PEO (Fig. 5 b) are shown. For the comminuted metoprolol tablets, the cumulative release was compared to the cumulative release of the neat metoprolol tartrate, a physical blend of the metoprolol tartrate formulation (not compressed or sintered), an IR comminuted tablet and a fully hydrated gel. For the comminuted Opana® and OxyContin® tablets, the cumulative release at 5 h was compared to the cumulative release of the neat oxymorphone HCl powder and oxycodone HCl powder, respectively. Comparisons between different drug products were not made due to the limitations of the study. Fig. 4 Release rate of oxycodone HCl from comminuted OxyContin® tablets ( a ) and release rate of oxymorphone HCl from comminuted Opana® tablets ( b ). All samples shown as n = 3. Samples are notated by ABC where MR is used for Opana® or CD for OxyContin® followed by the respective manipulation of grinding (G), milling (M), cutting (C), or (N) for neat API Fig. 5 Release rate of metoprolol tartrate from experimental tablets formulated with 1E 6 M w polyethylene oxide ( a ) and formulated with 7E 6 M w polyethylene oxide ( b ). All samples shown as n = 3. Samples are notated by ABC where A represents the polymer molecular weight of 1E 6 (1) or 7E 6 (7), B the porosity level of high (H) or low (L) porosity, and C the manipulation method employed, cut (C), milled (M), or ground (G). The controls are abbreviated as MT for metoprolol tartrate followed by (N) for neat API, or I for immediate-release tablet. The fully hydrated gel is represented by gel and the formulation blend is abbreviated by PB both prefixed with 1 or 7 for the corresponding M w of PEO used
OxyContin® Release
The release curves for the comminuted Opana® and OxyContin® tablets demonstrate that the cumulative release from comminuted tablets is much slower than from the neat API, see Fig. 4 a, b, respectively. The vertical diffusion cell data clearly show a difference in release due to type of comminution employed. For OxyContin® (Fig. 4 a), the f 2 statistic demonstrates that the cumulative percent release from both the cut ( f 2 = 26) and milled ( f 2 = 30) samples are different from the release from the ground samples. However, the milled and cut samples are similar in terms of cumulative release with a score of f 2 = 61. Interestingly, the release of oxycodone HCl from the ground tablet had the slowest release over the entire 5-h period, even though the particle size was the smallest (Fig. 4 a and Table II ). We would expect the smallest particle to have the fastest release; however, perhaps in the case of OxyContin®, the smaller particle size allowed the polymer to more quickly hydrate and form a gel matrix that slowed the release of the oxycodone HCl compared to the milled tablets. On the other hand, smaller particles could block the membrane more efficiently than bigger particles. It is possible that this specific conclusion is related to the distinct formulation properties and manufacturing techniques employed to make OxyContin®. As this information is not publicly available, we cannot draw any definitive conclusions about why the ground OxyContin® exhibited swelling controlled release characteristics. The cut tablets exhibited a slower initial release during the first hour which was followed by a faster release than the milled samples between 1.5 and 5 h.
Opana® Release
The cumulative percent release curves for Opana® were all different depending on the comminution technique employed, see Fig. 4 b. The milled ( f 2 = 5) and cut ( f 2 = 37) samples differed in release from the ground tablets. The milled and cut samples showed dissimilarity between each other with an f 2 = 10 score. Like OxyContin®, the cut Opana® samples exhibited a slower initial release than the milled samples between 0 and 1 h, and between 1.5 and 5 h the release of the cut samples increased while the release of the milled samples decreased (Fig. 4 b). While ground Opana® exhibits different relative release behavior than ground OxyContin®, it is important not to draw conclusions comparing the release among different drug products. It is possible that the molecular weight of PEO used in OxyContin® and Opana® are different and the manufacturing processes used could also vary and affect the final release of the drug from the comminuted formulation. Consequently, Opana® ground tablets exhibited the fastest release over milled and cut Opana® tablets. It is possible that the particle size of the ground Opana®, see Table II , did not create the conditions for rapid PEO hydration and gel formation, which allowed the API to diffuse before the gel formation, see Fig. 4 b. Overall, the VDC was able to discriminate differences in release profiles as a result of comminution method employed for specific drug products, while exhibiting similar qualitative release characteristics for comminution method ( i.e. , milled and cut).
Metoprolol Tartrate Release
Metoprolol Tartrate 1E6 MW PEO Release f2
Cumulative release of metoprolol tartrate from the comminuted metoprolol tablets (Fig. 5 a, b) followed similar trends as OxyContin® and Opana® drug products, Fig. 4 a, b. For the 1E 6 M W PEO samples (Fig. 5 a), all the high porosity tablet release curves were different from the low porosity tablets that were comminuted using the same method. The f 2 value was 32 for 1HG/1LG, f 2 = 45 for 1HM/1LM, and f 2 = 45 for 1HC/1LC comparisons. For the high porosity tablets, the cumulative release from the cut samples was different from the ground tablets ( f 2 = 25) and the milled tablets ( f 2 = 21). However, the cumulative percent release for the milled metoprolol tablets exhibited a similar release curve as the ground metoprolol ( f 2 = 59). The cumulative release from the low porosity tablets showed that release of metoprolol from the milled samples was dissimilar to the release from the ground tablets ( f 2 = 38) and from the cut samples ( f 2 = 44). However, for the low porosity tablets, the release from cut metoprolol tablets was similar to the ground samples ( f 2 = 70).
Metoprolol Tartrate 7E6 Mw PEO Release f 2
For the metoprolol tablets made with 7E 6 M W PEO, the cumulative release of metoprolol also varied depending on the comminution method employed and the initial porosity of the tablet (Fig. 5 b). The release from the ground tablets was shown to be dependent on porosity (7HG vs 7LG, f 2 = 33), so was the release from the cut tablets (7HC vs 7LC, f 2 = 31). The porosity level did not affect the release when the metoprolol tablets were milled (7HM vs 7LM, f 2 = 67). For the high porosity tablets, the milled tablets and cut tablets exhibited different release profiles from the ground tablets with a f 2 = 29 and f 2 = 22, respectively. The release of the milled tablets was similar to the release of metoprolol from the cut tablets with a f 2 = 50. Release of drug for tablets that exhibited low initial porosity yield e d similar release curves (7LG vs 7LM, f 2 = 96; 7LG vs 7LC, f 2 = 52; 7LM vs 7LC, f 2 = 50).
Metoprolol 1E6 MW and 7E6 MW Comparison f2
The molecular weight of PEO used in the metoprolol tartrate tablets is a significant factor in the release of metoprolol. Release of the metoprolol from the 1E 6 M W PEO (Fig. 5 a) was different from the 7E 6 M W PEO (Fig. 5 b) in all cases except for the high porosity, ground samples where 7HG vs 1HG were similar with a f 2 = 54.
The release from the pre-made gel and physical blend, which were used as controls, was faster than the comminuted tablets. Since the metoprolol is already dissolved in the hydrated PEO gel, this data showed that the PEO hydration plays an important role in the release of the comminuted particles that have API embedded in their structure. The small sample aliquot of 100 μL of gel may contribute to a thin layer of the sample forming on the membrane allowing for a uniform, consistent release of metoprolol over a more evenly spread out area of the membrane.
Further, the IR formulation exhibited release similar to that of the neat API and even the physical blends showed faster release profiles than the comminuted samples (Fig. 5 a, b). These results show that incorporation of PEO, compaction, and sintering decreased the release of the API. It may be that the tableting and sintering of PEO in the dosage form aids in densification of PEO with metoprolol tartrate thereby affecting the surface area of metoprolol freely available for fast diffusion at earlier time points.
The results showed the vertical diffusion test can detect differences in drug release due to formulation factors, such as initial tablet porosity and molecular weight of the PEO used in the dosage form, as well as the type of manipulation applied to the sample (cutting, grinding, milling). In some cases where release curves were described as similar, it is possible that the f 2 statistic was not discriminative enough to fully quantitate the qualitative differences that occur with each type of comminution method. This is an area that could warrant further research. Further, each type of drug product used (metoprolol tartrate tablets, Opana®, or OxyContin®) exhibited their own qualitative release curves and patterns .
Mechanism of Release
In addition to determining release differences among different modes of abuse, and among the different types of formulations, we used a model independent analysis to assess the release from the comminuted tablet formulations.
For model independent methods, there are many ways to analyze the data (Table II ). For example, the dissolution percentage in the first 30 min (Q 30 ), and the time it takes for 20, 50, and 80% ( t 20% , t 50% , and t 80% ) of the drug to release have been reported in the literature ( , ). The advantage of model independent methods is that a result can be retrieved without model fit, which can be challenging and time consuming for complex diffusion data. Table III shows that neat API, gels, IR tablets, and the non-compressed, formulation blends exhibited 20% release in less than 15 min. The marketed drug products, Opana® and OxyContin®, required at least 40 min to release 20% of API in comminuted form with specifically ground OxyContin® and milled Opana® requiring over 2 h to release 20% API. The release of 20% metoprolol tartrate from most of the comminuted tablets only required 20 to 40 min. Table III Different Methods to Assess Diffuion Data Using Independent Models Name Model independent method Comments T 20% Statistical percentile Early release most important for abusers Q 30min Statistical quartile Characterize percentage of drug to be released in 30 min
The Q 30min value is an indicator of how much drug is released in 30 min. In general, the greater amount of drug rapidly released may be related to an end abuser’s high. Table III shows that within 30 min all neat API controls, the metoprolol IR tablets and gels released greater than 50% or the total amount released by 5 h for each individual product. The physical blends reduced the amount of drug released in 30 min to below 50 and 25% for sample 1PB and 7PB, respectively. All the comminuted samples, drug products, and metoprolol tablets experience retarded release with less than 30% of drug being released in 30 min. The ground OxyContin® experienced only 7% drug release within 30 min resulting in an 82% reduction in drug release compared to the neat API release. For ground Opana®, a 71% reduction in drug release compared to the neat API was observed. The metoprolol tartrate tablets also exhibited significant decreases in release to the neat API, i.e. , 56 and 75% reduction in drug release for the 1E 6 and 7E 6 M w PEO formulations, respectively. These decreases in release support further that incorporation of PEO into the drug matrix will retard the release of API and further processing such as compaction and sintering can result in further significant reductions in drug release.
Release Kinetics of API Release from PEO Matrix
The release constant of drug from the PEO matrix over 5 h was evaluated using Eq. 4 . The release constant is useful to make quick comparisons with regard to formulation effects on release. A higher slope value is related to large changes in mass transfer during the diffusion period while smaller slope values indicate a slower change in release of drug over time, see Table IV . The change in release constant due to mechanical manipulation employed for the metoprolol tablets is found to be statistically significant ( p = 0.0003). The sample type, involving PEO molecular weight and initial tablet porosity, was also found to significant impact the release constant ( p = 0.0241). Specifically, for 7E 6 M w PEO, there were no significant differences in release constant due to initial porosity ( p = 0.7608) whereas for 1E 6 M w PEO the initial tablet porosity was significant ( p = 0.0498) in effecting the overall release constant.

Drug products are designated as CD for OxyContin® and MR for Opana® followed by G, M, or C for the respective manipulation used for the samples
The overall release constant of OxyContin® and Opana® drug products was significantly affected by the product type ( p = 0.0247) compared to the mechanical manipulation method employed ( p = 0.1594). This is expected since different drugs exhibit different release constants. Comparing the release constant of the different comminuted products by the t test, it was found that the release constant for ground Opana® was significantly different from the release constant of cut and milled Opana®. Further, milled and cut Opana® was found to also be significantly different when the t test was used for comparison. For OxyContin®, the release constant of the cut tablets was significantly different from the ground and milled tablets. However, the release constant for the ground and milled tablets were not significantly different based on the t test. These comparisons agree with the observations made with the f 2 test.
Unexpectedly, some of the milled samples exhibited lower release constants compared to the ground samples (Table V ). For instance, the milled sample for metoprolol tartrate tablets made with 7E 6 M w PEO and compressed with high initial porosity had a significantly lower release constant compared to the release constant of the same tablets that were ground instead. One explanation for this trend may be that the small particles from the ground sample dissolved quickly resulting in more rapid initial Fickian diffusion before the gel forms and release is controlled by anomalous diffusion, i.e. , swelling controlled ( ). For the larger, cut particles, the particles do not dissolve as quickly, and the subsequent formation of the gel prevents diffusion of the API until later time points, resulting in overall swelling controlled diffusion, which contributes to the large slope changes. The milled particles exhibit initial release behavior that is somewhere between quick dissolution of the drug and swelling controlled release of the drug most likely due to the characteristics of the milled comminuted tablet particles. These competing mechanisms in the milled product may be the reason why the milled particles have a lower overall release constant compared to the ground samples.

CONCLUSION
The VDC offers a quick, simplified, reproducible model that may indicate an ADF’s potential to curtail abuse by measuring the rate at which a drug is released from its formulation; the rate of drug release is known to be a factor in an abuser assessment of “drug liking.” We used several methods ( f 2 statistic, model independent analysis, and release constant) to analyze the release rate data. It was shown that the molecular weight of PEO in the dosage form can affect the release of the drug product. Additionally, the initial porosity of the starting tablet was shown to have an impact on the final particle size of a manipulated tablet, and consequently impacted the time needed for most of the drug to be released. It was also shown that increasing the amount of shear force applied to the tablet during manipulation effectively reduced the effect of formulation composition and manufacturing conditions as shown when the different drug products were ground (highest micro shear force) and the resulting particles were similar in particle size, see Fig. 3 b.
