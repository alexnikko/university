Introduction
Derived from Artemisia annua L. , artemisinin (ART) is a sesquiterpene lactone compound with an endoperoxide bridge (Dayrit ). It is mainly used for the treatment of Plasmodium falciparum ( P. falciparum ) owing to its rapid effect, low side effect, and high safety, especially in drug-resistant and cerebral malaria (Klayman ). Inspired by these attributes, a series of ART derivatives such as dihydroartemisinin (DHA), artemether (ARM), arteether (ARE), and artesunate (ARS) were developed and used in the clinic (Liu ). However, disadvantages such as a short half-life, low bioavailability, high recrudescence rate, and decreased cure rate were observed in all the aforementioned drugs. Therefore, changes in drug delivery, dosage form, and chemical modifications were explored for overcoming the above disadvantages (Shen et al. ; Prabhu et al. , ; O’Neill et al. ).
Recently, a pro-drug of ART synthesized by the twin combination principle for improving its pharmacological activity has become a topic of keen interest (Fredric and Michael ). And a great variety of ART-derived dimmers were synthesized and evaluated on the in vitro and/or in vivo pharmacological activity compared to the parent drug. Thereinto, the DHA dimer (Fig. 1 ) was proved to have dramatically enhanced activity against EN2 tumor cells over DHA (Beekman et al. ). It is accepted that both the antitumor and antimalarial activities of ART-derived compounds mainly depend on the endoperoxide linkage (Woerdenbag et al. ; Fröhlich et al. ). Thus, it was of great interest to investigate whether its antimalarial activity has similarly improved. However, studies on its antimalarial activity were lacking in the existing literatures. Fig. 1 Chemical structure of DHA dimer
Herein, we evaluated the antimalarial activity in vitro and in vivo of the dimer. In addition, the metabolites and major metabolic pathways of the dimer in rats were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography-high resolution multistage mass spectrometry (HPLC-HRMS n ) method. The results of this paper could provide the experimental basis for further development of the DHA dimer and other DHA-relative dimers.
Materials and methods
Materials
DHA was purchased from the Chongqing Pacific Pharmaceutical Co. (purity > 99.0%; Chongqing, China). Acetonitrile (HPLC grade) was obtained from Fisher Chemicals (Fairlawn, USA). The DHA dimer which was synthesized by our laboratory and confirmed to be the dimer of α-DHA and β-DHA with single-crystal X-ray diffraction was consistent with the previous report (Yue et al. ). HEPES, sorbitol, hypoxanthine, and saponin were all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Shanghai, China). AlbuMAX II and RPMI 1640 were supplied by Gibco Inc. (Shanghai, China). Gentamicin, SYBR Green I dye, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), ether, Tris, EDTA, Triton X-100, JiShi dye, and Switzerland’s dye were all purchased from Biotiopped Co. (Beijing, China). Peanut oil was provided from the Shandong Luhua group (Shandong, China).
Instruments
All the HPLC-HRMS n experiments were carried out on a Thermo Electron LTQ Orbitrap XL hybrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Company, Germany) equipped with electrospray ionization (ESI). An “Accela” HPLC system (Thermo Electron, USA) with an autosampler, a vacuum degasser unit, and a quaternary pump was employed. Additional instrumentation included the YS100 light microscope (Nikon, Japan), a camera (Chongqing Optec Instrument Co., Ltd., China), a Varioskan Flash-type full-wavelength multifunctional enzyme mark with a CO 2 incubator (311, Thermo Fisher Scientific Company, USA), a biological purification worktable (ZHJH-C1112B, Shanghai ZHICHENG Analytical Instrument Co., Ltd., China), and a vertical pressure steam sterilizer (BXM-30R, Shanghai Boxun Industrial Co., Ltd., China).
Animals
Healthy Sprague Dawley (SD) rats (220 ± 20 g) and Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) male mice (20 ± 2 g) were supplied by the Department of Laboratory Animal Center of Shanxi Medical University. All experimental procedures and animal treatments were performed in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Institutes of Health Publications, Nos. 85–23, revised 1996). All the rats and mice were maintained at room temperature (20–25 °C) with a relative humidity of 40–70%. They had free access to water throughout the experiment and were fed twice a day, in the morning and evening.
In vitro antimalarial activity
The chloroquine-susceptible 3D7 strain of P. falciparum , asexually cultured in complete medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) with type O human blood (2% final hematocrit, 0.4% parasitemia), was used to evaluate the antimalarial activity of the drug (Trager and Jensen ). Drug dissolved in DMSO was diluted with culture medium to obtain a final DMSO concentration below 0.1%. A series of DHA and DHA-dimer concentrations were prepared. The DHA concentrations were 2 × 10 3 , 2 × 10 2 , 20, 2, 0.2, 2 × 10 −2 , and 2 × 10 −3 nmol/L. The dimer concentrations were 10 3 , 10 2 , 10, 1, 0.1, 10 −2 , 10 −3 , and 10 −4 nmol/L. Then, 80 μL of the above P. falciparum mixture and 20 μL of the drug solutions were added into microtiter plates for a 72-h incubation at 37 °C. The complete medium without P. falciparum and the culture medium with 0.1% DMSO and the complete medium with P. falciparum and the culture medium with 0.1% DMSO were used as the blank group and the negative control group, respectively. Then parasite growth was assayed by the method of SYBR Green I (Cheng et al. ). The excitation wavelength (Ex) and emission wavelength (Em) were set at 485 and 535 nm, respectively. The parasite inhibition rate in triplicate on a 96-well microtiter plate was calculated. And IC 50 and IC 95 , corresponding to the drug concentrations for 50 and 95% parasite growth inhibition, respectively, were evaluated.
In vivo antimalarial activity
In the experiment, ICR male mice were infected by intraperitoneal injection with 0.2 mL/20 g of whole blood diluted by normal saline, which included approximately 10 7 erythrocytes infected with Plasmodium vinckei (BY 265 strain). After 2 h, mice were treated once a day for four consecutive days by i.g. administration or by tail i.v. injection with a series of doses of the dimer and DHA as a positive control group (Barkan et al. ). The 32 groups with each group consisting of eight mice in total were evaluated. The normal group was the non-infected and non-treated group. The negative control group was infected but not treated. And the placebo group was infected and treated with inactive peanut oil for the i.g. administration group or 20% DMSO for the tail i.v. injection group. On the fifth day, the infection, inhibition, and negative conversion rats were determined (Liu et al. ). And ED 50 (the dose at which infection is reduced by 50%) and ED 90 (the dose at which infection is reduced by 90%) values were also analyzed. A month after drug withdrawal, the recrudescence rates, cure rates, mortality, and average survival days for different dose groups were calculated.
In vivo metabolism
Optimized conditions of HPLC-HRMSn
Chromatographic separation was achieved on the ZORBAX-C 18 column (150 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm; Agilent, USA). The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile (A) and ammonium acetate buffer solution (B) including 2 mM ammonium acetate and 0.5% ( v/v ) formic acid. Gradient elution was used. The column temperature and the sample plate temperature were maintained at 20 and 4 °C, respectively.
The mass spectrometer was operated in the positive ionization mode. The ionization voltage and the capillary temperature were set at 4.2 kV and 300 °C, respectively. Nitrogen was used as both the sheath (60 units) and auxiliary gas (15 units). The resolving power was 15,000 for full scan and 7500 for the MS 2 scans.
The dimer, DHA, and its metabolites were derived in the form of [M+NH 4 ] + adduct ions in the high-energy collision dissociation (HCD) mode using the normalized collision energy at 35%. The full scan mode across an m/z range that bracketed the dimer, DHA, and its phase I/II metabolites was used for quantitative analysis of the dimer, DHA, and its metabolites. Extracted ion chromatograms (EICs) of m/z 302.1956 for DHA and m/z 568.3484 for the dimer were generated for quantification with a 5-ppm range centered on the exact m/z value.
Sample preparation
Sixteen healthy SD rats were housed in metabolic cages for the collection of feces, urine, bile, and plasma. A single dose (10 mg/kg) of dimer or DHA was administered by oral gavage after 12 h of fasting with free access to water. Feces, urine, and bile were collected individually at pre-dose and from 0 to 24 h. The bile was obtained as illustrated below (Fig. 2 ) after anesthesia with ether. All the samples were stored at − 80 °C until analysis. Heparinized blood samples of 1 mL were collected at pre-dose, 2, 6, 12, and 24 h from the ophthalmic veins of the rats by sterile capillary tube and then shaken and centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 10 min. The supernatants were decanted, pooled, and kept at − 80 °C until analysis. Fig. 2 The collection of bile from rats
The feces samples collected pre- and post administraion were separately homogenized with acetonitrile at a rate of 1:2 (g/mL), then sonicated for 15 min, and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. Finally, a 20-μL aliquot of the supernatant was used for HPLC-HRMS n analysis.
Aliquots of 100 μL of 24-h post-drug plasma sample and pre-drug plasma sample were each treated with 200 μL of acetonitrile, vortexed for 3 min, and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. A 20-μL aliquot of the resultant supernatant was used for HPLC-HRMS n analysis.
The 24-h post-drug urine or bile sample and pre-drug urine or bile sample were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. And an aliquot of 500 μL of supernatant was loaded onto a C 18 solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridge preconditioned with 2 mL of methanol and 2 mL of water. Then, the SPE cartridge was washed with 200 μL of methanol, and an aliquot of 20 μL of eluent was used for HPLC-HRMS n analysis.
Statistical analysis
The in vitro parasite inhibition rate = 1 − (fluorescence value of the added drug group − fluorescence value of the blank group)/(fluorescence value of the negative control group − fluorescence value of the blank group). Dose-effect curves were analyzed based on the parasite inhibition rate by SPSS 13.0 software, and the results were expressed as IC 50 and IC 95 .
The in vivo infection rate = the number of erythrocytes infected with Plasmodium vinckei /the number of all the counted erythrocytes. The inhibition rate = (average infection rate of the negative control group − average infection rate of the drug-treated group)/average infection rate of the negative control group. The ED 50 and ED 90 values were determined based on the inhibition rate using SPSS 13.0 software. The negative conversion rate = the number of mice with no infection or infection rate below 1%/the total number of the mice in the group. The recrudescence rate = the number of mice with reinfection/the total number of mice with negative conversion once in the group. The cure rate = the number of the negative mice/the total number of mice in the group. The mortality = the number of dead mice/the total number in the group. The average survival days = the sum of the survival days after infection for all the mice/the number of the total mice in the group.
Results and discussion
Antimalarial activity
In vitro antimalarial activity
In vitro antimalarial activity was determined against the 3D7 strain of P. falciparum . This followed a 72-h drug contact with the parasite. The IC 50 of the dimer was lower relative to DHA (Table 1 ). Table 1 The in vitro IC 50 and IC 95 of dimer and DHA ( n = 9) Concentration (nM) Dimer DHA IC 50 0.51 ± 0.12 1.81 ± 0.70 IC 95 4.72 ± 1.86 6.40 ± 2.05
It is believed that the antimalarial activity of DHA depends on the radical generator of the endoperoxide bridge (Posner and Chang ). Since the dimer is two molecules of DHA linked together, it could be that it generated twice the amount of the so-called active radical generated by DHA molecule and hence its better activity. These interesting results may also suggest that the dimer itself could be a better radical generator and need not degrade to DHA. It is also possible that metabolites generated only by the dimer could exert some activity on the parasites and/or with the radical bring about synergistic effect.
In vivo antimalarial activity
Mice infected with Plasmodium yoelii rodent malaria were used for the evaluation of the in vivo antimalarial activity of the dimer (Table 2 ). The lowest infection rates of 0.82 ± 0.01% and 0.57 ± 0.01% and the highest inhibition rates of 97.82 ± 0.89% and 98.26 ± 0.48% of the dimer at the highest dose of 15.6 mg/(kg·day) for the i.g. administration group and 6.0 mg/(kg·day) for i.v. injection group were obtained. It showed better activity relative to DHA which had the infection rates of 1.15 ± 0.22% and 1.45 ± 0.11% and the inhibition rates of 96.94 ± 1.12% and 95.62 ± 0.32%. The ED 50 values of the dimer calculated based on the infection rates and inhibition rates were lower than those of DHA for both the i.g. administration groups and tail i.v. injection groups (Table 3 ).

The negative conversion rates, recrudescence rates, mortality, and average survival days as evaluation indexes of the dimer’s efficacy were also calculated and listed in Tables 4 and 5 . The best parasite clearances for the dimer were achieved at the highest dose of 15.6 mg/(kg·day) for the i.g. administration group and 6.0 mg/(kg·day for the i.v. injection group. The negative conversion rates of the dimer in both cases were 100%, which were higher than those of DHA at 62.5 and 50%. And the lower recrudescence rates of 50 and 25% and the higher cure rates of 50 and 75% were also observed compared to those of DHA which had the recrudescence rates of 100% in both cases and cure rates of 0% for both experiments. Moreover, the mortality of 25 and 0% and average survival days of ≥ 22 and > 30 were also remarkably superior to those of DHA which had a mortality of 100% for both experiments and average survival days of 16 and 17.

In this study, the antimalarial activity of the dimer in vivo was consistent with that in vitro. The increased lipophilicity of the dimer relative to DHA was measured in our research (Dai ), and the generated radical was responsible for the antimalarial activity and cytotoxicity. Thus, a fine radical generator as well as the improved physical and chemical properties of the dimer may be considered the reasons of its activity.
Metabolism in vivo
Metabolism of DHA in vivo
Nineteen chromatographic peaks relevant to DHA were detected in the urine of rats after i.g. administration of DHA. This finding confirms the earlier report by Liu ( ). The total ion chromatograms (TICs) and EICs are shown in Fig. 3 . The chromatographic peak of D0 was DHA. The other 18 base peaks were m/z 302.1956 (D1–D2), m/z 300.1809 (D3–D4), m/z 318.1913 (D5–D6), m/z 316.1768 (D7–D9), m/z 286.2014 (D10), m/z 284.1855 (D11), m/z 478.2278 (D12), m/z 462.2312 (D13), m/z 476.2114 (D14), m/z 494.2236 (D15-D17), and m/z 492.2088 (D18). D5, D7, D10, and D14 were also detected in the plasma. D0–D4, D7, D10, D13, D15, D16, and D18 were also found in the bile. D0, D3, D5, D7, and D11 were also observed in the feces. These metabolites mainly appeared in the urine and bile. The chromatographic and mass spectral data of the metabolites associated with DHA are listed in Table 6 .

Eighteen metabolites were divided into 11 phase I metabolites and 7 phase II metabolites. It could be inferred that phase I metabolites were obtained by hydroxylation (A), loss of oxygen (B), and desaturation (C), and phase II metabolites were generated by glucuronidation (D), as described in Fig. 4 . Fig. 4 Proposed metabolic pathways of DHA in rats
Metabolism of dimer in vivo
Twenty-seven metabolites relevant to the dimer were detected from urine, faces, plasma, and bile for the dimer following the i.g. administration of the dimer. These included DHA (D0) and 11 of its metabolites (D1–D5, D7, D10, D12–D14, D18) and 15 other metabolites peculiar only to the dimer. The chromatographic peak labelled M0 was ascribed to the dimer. The other 14 base peaks were assigned as follows: m/z 568.3480 (M1–M4), m/z 584.3433 (M5–M6), m/z 566.3339 (M7), m/z 600.3405 (M8), m/z 582.3266 (M9), m/z 616.3325 (M10–M12), m/z 598.3245 (M13), and m/z 614.3527 (M14–M15). The typical chromatographic peaks of M0–M4 and M8, M5–M7, and M9–M15 were detected in the urine (Fig. 5 ), feces (Fig. 6 ), and bile (Fig. 7 ). The metabolic pathways of the other 15 metabolites may be loss of oxygen (A), hydroxylation (B), and hydroxylation of dehydration (D), as shown in Fig. 8 . The chromatographic and mass spectral data of the metabolites of the dimer are shown in Tables 6 and 7 . Differences in types and amounts of metabolites were observed between DHA and its dimer.

Conclusions
This research demonstrates that the antimalarial effects both in vitro and in vivo increased as expected with the concentration of drugs. The antimalarial effects of the dimer both in vitro and in vivo were greater than DHA. Therefore, the dimer of DHA is a promising candidate for antimalarial drugs and deserves further development. The dimer was metabolized to DHA and metabolites of DHA. The main possible metabolic pathways and excretive pathways of the dimer were tentatively deduced and reported for the first time.
