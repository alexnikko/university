Background
Cardiac amyloidosis is an underdiagnosed cause of heart failure in patients with preserved ejection fractions, and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. , Diagnoses of cardiac amyloidosis can be challenging since it often mimics other cardiac conditions (e.g., hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, hypertensive heart disease) common in older adults. , Cardiac amyloidosis is caused by the extracellular deposition of protein fibrils in the myocardium. Pathophysiologic substrates of cardiac amyloidosis with principal clinical significance are primary light-chain amyloidosis (AL), mutant transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTRm), and wild-type transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTRwt). , Restrictive cardiomyopathy is the primary clinical presentation of both forms of ATTR-CA and AL. In the United States, the most common ATTR-CA mutation, V122I, is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and is predominately present in African Americans. Additionally, to date, ATTRwt has been described almost exclusively in elderly males, while ATTRm is present in patients of both genders and across a variety of age ranges.
Prognosis and therapies are distinct for each of the pathophysiologic substrates of the cardiac amyloidosis. Median survival from time of diagnosis is 9 to 12 months for AL, 25 to 36 for ATTRm, and 24 to 66 months for ATTRwt. Treatment options vary across subtypes; chemotherapy and stem cell transplant are standard for AL amyloid while there are a number of non-FDA approved, but promising and non-invasive treatments for ATTR-CA.
Accordingly, given the growing awareness of ATTR-CA as a cause of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), and the need to distinguish between subtypes of cardiac amyloid for the purposes of prognosis and therapies, there is an unmet clinical need for inexpensive, readily available, and non-invasive methods to detect ATTR-CA and differentiate it from AL. Endomyocardial biopsies, the current gold standard to diagnose cardiac amyloidosis, must be coupled with immunohistochemistry , or mass spectroscopy in inconclusive cases, and as such requires specialized expertise and centers. Although there are a number of nuclear imaging methods currently under investigation, aside from 99m Tc-PYP, there are significant limitations when utilizing them to diagnose ATTR-CA. In particular, planar imaging with technetium-99m 3,3-diphosphono-1,2-propanodicarboxylic acid ( 99m Tc-DPD), can be used to diagnose ATTR-CA, , but the isotope is not currently approved for use in the United States. Although unable to distinguish between subtypes, PET/CT imaging with C-Pittsburgh compound B (C-PIB) , and 18F-Florbetapir to diagnose cardiac amyloidosis , shows encouraging results, as of yet investigations are ongoing.
Consequently, in the United States, the radioisotope of choice is 99m Tc-PYP since it is FDA approved and readily available. Most importantly, the single-center experience has demonstrated excellent diagnostic accuracy of 99m Tc-PYP planar imaging for ATTR-CA, and as a result, popularity for this technique is spreading across centers. , , , , In this study we aim to describe a standardized 99m Tc-PYP imaging protocol to diagnose ATTR-CA.
Methods
Study design
We reviewed 99m Tc-PYP scans among patients enrolled in a prospective single-center, blinded study with the goal of standardizing a 99m Tc-PYP imaging protocol to diagnose ATTR-CA. A total of 104 consecutive scans were obtained from 45 patients. All patients included in the study underwent 99m Tc-PYP planar imaging at the Columbia University Medical Center/New York Presbyterian Hospital. The study was approved by the Columbia University IRB and subjects provided informed consent. Patients with biopsy-proven diagnoses of ATTRwt, ATTRm, and AL cardiac amyloidosis were included in this study. Cardiac amyloid was confirmed by endomyocardial biopsies in 82% (37/45) of patients, or if unavailable histologic documentation of Congo red staining in at least one involved organ with echocardiographically defined evidence of amyloid cardiomyopathy (thickness of the left ventricular septum or posterior wall >12 mm) without another cause of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in 11% (5/45) of patients, or documented amyloidogenic TTR mutation by DNA analysis and echocardiographically defined evidence of amyloid cardiomyopathy without evidence of a plasma cell dyscrasia in 7% (3/45) of the cohort. All scans were reviewed by experienced nuclear cardiologists blinded to subjects’ amyloid status.
99mTc-PYP imaging
Patients underwent single imaging sessions during which multiple scans acquired with different imaging parameters, including counts, time to acquisition, and processing matrix, were obtained. 99m Tc-PYP dose was gradually decreased in subsequently scanned patients. The camera settings, image acquisitions, processing matrix, and 99m Tc-PYP doses utilized to scan patients are presented in Table 1 . Semiquantitative and quantitative methods used to evaluate 99m Tc-PYP planar scans and diagnose ATTR-CA have been previously described. Briefly, myocardial 99m Tc-PYP uptake on planar images was categorized as focal or diffuse, and since myocardial infarctions present focally and cardiac amyloidosis presents diffusely, only images with diffuse uptake were included. Nuclear cardiologists blinded to the patients’ biopsy status evaluated cardiac retention of 99m Tc-PYP using a semiquantitative visual scoring method (0 = no uptake, 1 = uptake less than ribs, 2 = uptake equal to ribs, 3 = uptake greater than ribs). A target region of interest (ROI) was drawn circularly over the heart to quantify mean myocardial 99m Tc-PYP uptake. A mirror image ROI was also drawn over the contralateral chest to normalize the target ROI for background 99m Tc-PYP. A Heart/Contralateral ratio (H/CL) was calculated as the fraction of heart ROI mean counts to background ROI mean counts. Table 1 Potential scintigraphy protocols Procedures Parameters Preparation No fasting required Scan Rest scan Dose of 99m Tc-PYP Graduated decrease: 25, 20, 15, 10 mCi Time to acquisition 1 hour and 2–4 hours Position Supine Acquisition and processing Camera Philips Precedence SPECT/CT camera (Philips Healthcare, Guildford, United Kingdom) Field of view Large Detector configuration 90-degrees with a non-circular orbit for 180-degree transit Cardiac position with a 45 degree start angle Energy window 140 keV, (20%) Collimators Low energy, high resolution Number of views Two (Anterior and Lateral) Image acquisition 750,000 counts and 2000 K counts Zoom 1.45 Matrix 256 × 256 and 128 × 128
Imaging parameters, including counts (750 vs 2000 K), time to acquisition (1 vs 2 to 4 hours), processing matrix (256 vs 128), and 99m Tc-PYP dose were assessed for image quality and correlation of H/CL ratios. The image quality for these different imaging parameters and processing matrixes was determined using an overall image quality scale and extracardiac activity scale. 99m Tc-PYP dose was determined by assessing the image quality of scans obtained from different patients injected with gradually decreased doses of the radioisotope. Two experienced nuclear cardiologists evaluated overall image quality using a visual 5-point grading scale (1 = uninterpretable, 2 = poor, 3 = fair, 4 = good, 5 = excellent), and rib uptake as measure of extracardiac radioactivity using a 3-point grading scale (1 = no or negligible extracardiac activity, 2 = mild extracardiac activity, 3 = moderate to marked extracardiac activity). When there was discordance in the scoring between the two readers, the “worse” score was used (lower score for quality, higher score for extracardiac activity), so as to be conservative.
Correlation and reproducibility
Imaging parameters, including counts (750 vs 2000 K), time to acquisition (1 vs 2 to 4 hours), processing matrix (256 vs 128), and 99m Tc-PYP dose were assessed for correlation and reproducibility. The correlation between H/CL ratios obtained from scans acquired with different imaging parameters and processing matrixes was evaluated. The inter- and intrareader variability of semiquantitative visual scores obtained from scans acquired with different imaging parameters was assessed by four nuclear cardiologist, one of whom read the scans twice, seven days apart.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics, using mean ± standard deviation for continuous variables and relative percentages for categorical variables, were used to analyze demographic and clinical characteristics of the study population. The statistical analyses were conducted using Statistical Analysis Software (SAS; Cary, North Carolina). The subgroup comparisons were conducted using 1-way ANOVA with post hoc Bonferroni correction for continuous variables, and chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables. All p-values used were two-sided, with P < .05 considered significant. Relative percentages were used to evaluate image quality of different imaging parameters using the 5-point image quality scale and 3-point extracardiac activity scale. Comparisons between the distributions of image quality scores across different imaging and dosing parameters were conducted by dichotomizing the 5-point image quality scale (4 vs 5) and tested with McNemar’s Test. Comparisons between the distributions of extracardiac activity grades across various imaging and dosing parameters were conducted by dichotomizing the 3-point scale (1 vs 2 and 3) and tested with McNemar’s Test. The correlation between the H/CL ratios of different imaging parameters was assessed using a Pearson Correlation Coefficient with Fisher’s Z Transformation for a 95% confidence interval. Reproducibility of semiquantitative visual scores from different imaging parameters were evaluated using Cohen’s Kappa Coefficient.
Results
Study population demographics
The scans of 45 patients, 84% (38/45) male with a mean age of 70 ± 2 years, with biopsy-proven cardiac amyloidosis, 27% (12/45) AL, 35% (16/45) ATTRw, and 38% (17/45) ATTRm, were included in this study. Patients with ATTRm had the following mutations: Val122Ile ( n = 12), Thr60Ala ( n = 2), Ser23Asn ( n = 1), Thr59Lys ( n = 1), and Ala120Ser ( n = 1). The distribution and significance of demographic, laboratory, and echocardiographic characteristics across amyloid subgroups, have been previously published by Bokhari et al. 2013 and are presented in Table 2 . ATTRwt subjects were significantly older than those with AL ( P = .0008). Likely due to the association between the V122I mutation and black race, the majority of ATTRm subjects were black ( P ≤ .0001). The clinical presentation of subjects, including New York Heart Association class, ejection fraction, and abnormal ECG, evidenced by low-QRS voltage and infarct pattern, did not differ among patients and was consistent with previously reported descriptions of cardiac amyloidosis. Additionally, laboratory results did not differ among patients with different types of cardiac amyloidosis, a finding attributable to similar disease severity among subjects.

Optimal image quality
Overall image quality was deemed excellent in 82% of patients imaged at 750 K counts acquired at 1 hour and good in 67% of patients imaged at 2 to 4 hours ( P = .63). Scans from patients imaged at 2000 K counts acquired at 1 and 2 to 4 hours were deemed excellent in 86 and 56% of patients, respectively ( P = .25). There was no significant difference between the image quality of scans acquired with 750 vs 2000 K counts at 1 hour ( P = .25). Image quality of scans acquired with 750 K counts at 1 hour, and processed with a 128 matrix, were deemed excellent in 100% of patients, and did not differ from scans acquired with a 256 matrix ( P = 1.00). Overall image quality of each imaging parameter evaluated using the 5-point visual scoring scale is presented in Table 3 . Table 3 Image quality of different imaging parameters 750 K counts to acquisition 2000 K counts to acquisition 1 hr a 256 × 256 1 hr 128 × 128 2–4 hr 256 × 256 1 hr 256 × 256 2–4 hr 256 × 256 Overall image quality Uninterpretable 0% (0/45) 0% (0/7) 0% (0/6) 0% (0/29) 0% (0/6) Poor 0% (0/45) 0% (0/7) 0% (0/6) 0% (0/29) 0% (0/6) Fair 0% (0/45) 0% (0/7) 0% (0/6) 0% (0/29) 0% (0/6) Good 18% (8/45) 0% (0/7) 67% (4/6) 14% (4/29) 67% (4/6) Excellent 82% (37/45) 100% (7/7) 33% (2/6) 86% (25/29) 33% (2/6) Extracardiac Image Quality b Grade 1 51% (23/45) 14% (1/7) 0% (0/6) 10% (3/29) 0% (0/6) Grade 2 42% (19/45) 72% (5/7) 0% (0/6) 31% (9/29) 0% (0/6) Grade 3 7% (3/45) 14% (1/7) 100% (6/6) 59% (17/29) 100% (6/6) a hr. indicates hour of acquisition b Extracardiac Image Quality is measured as rib uptake; Grade 1 = no or negligible extracardiac activity; Grade 2 = mild extracardiac activity; Grade 3 = moderate to marked extracardiac activity
Image quality was also assessed by evaluating extracardiac activity, measured as rib uptake in the contralateral chest, on scans acquired with different imaging parameters. On scans acquired for 750 K counts at 1 hour, 51% were grade 1 studies (no or negligible extracardiac activity), and at 2 to 4 hours, 100% were grade 3 studies (moderate to marked extracardiac activity) ( P = .25). On scans acquired for 2000 K counts at 1 hour, 59% were grade 3 studies, and at 2 to 4 hours 100% were grade 3 studies ( P = .25). Scans acquired for 750 K counts at 1 hour had significantly lower extracardiac activity compared to scans acquired for 2000 K counts at 1 hour ( P = .00098). Representative scans, Figure 1 , demonstrate decreased extracardiac activity, measured as rib uptake in the contralateral chest, in scans acquired for 750 vs 2000 K counts at 1 hour, and although not statistically significant, this is also demonstrated in scans acquired for 750 K counts at 1 vs 2 to 4 hours. On scans acquired for 750 K counts at 1 hour and processed with a 128 matrix, 71% were grade 2 studies (mild extracardiac activity), and did not differ from scans acquired with a 256 processing matrix ( P = .5). Table 3 presents the distribution of extracardiac activity grades, measured as rib uptake in the contralateral chest, in scans obtained using different imaging parameters. Figure 1 Scans from a single imaging study show decreased rib 99m Tc-PYP uptake in a scan acquired for 750K counts at 1 ( A ) vs 2 to 4 ( B ) hours, processed with a 256 × 256 matrix. Decreased 99m Tc-PYP uptake is also illustrated in 750 K ( C ) vs 2000 K counts ( D ), each at acquired at 1 hour and processed with a 256 × 256 matrix
The mean 99m Tc-PYP dose injected was 26.2 ± 5.24 mCi, with a range of 10.4 to 30.9 mCi. There was no significant difference in the overall image quality of scans obtained from patients injected with approximately 10 mCi of the radioisotope as compared to higher doses ( P = .50). However, extracardiac activity decreased on scans from patients injected with approximately 10 mCi of 99m Tc-PYP as compared to higher doses ( P = .0015). Additionally, although using 10 mCi relative to 25 to 30 mCi of 99m Tc-PYP increased imaging time by 4 to 3 minutes, it decreased radiation exposure by 5 to 7 mSv.
Correlation and reproducibility of different imaging parameters
Scans obtained with 750 vs 2000 K counts had H/CL ratios which were moderately correlated ( r = 0.92 (CI 0.84 to 0.96), P < .001). Ratios obtained from scans acquired with 750 K counts at 1 vs 2 to 4 hours were also correlated ( r = 0.93 (CI 0.46 to 0.99), P = .005). Scans acquired with 2000 K counts at 1 vs 2 to 4 hours had H/CL ratios which highly correlated ( r = 0.98 (CI 0.82 to 1.00), P < .001). Scans processed with a 128 vs 256 matrix, and acquired for 750 K counts at 1 hour, were also highly correlated ( r = 0.99 (CI 0.93 to 1.00), P < .001).
The quantitative methodology used to evaluate 99m Tc-PYP uptake using the H/CL ratio, and the semiquantitative visual scores with correlating cardiac amyloid diagnoses (0, 1 = AL, and 2, 3 = ATTR-CA), are depicted in representative scans (Figure 2 ). Reproducibility of the semiquantitative visual scoring method utilized to assess scans and diagnose ATTR-CA was high. Agreement between readers was 95% for scans acquired with 750K counts at 1 hour and at 2 to 4 hours, and with 2000K counts at 1 hour and at 2 to 4 hours. Intrareader agreement was 95% for scans acquired with 750K and 2000K counts, at 1 and 2 to 4 hours. Figure 2 The quantitative method used to diagnose ATTR-CA with H/CL ≥ 1.5 is depicted in a patient with AL cardiac amyloidosis ( A ) and a patient with ATTR-CA ( B ). The range of semiquantitative visual scores ( C visual score = 0, no uptake and AL positive; D visual score =1, uptake less than rib and AL positive; E visual score of 2 = uptake equal to rib and ATTR positive; F visual score = 3, uptake greater than rib and ATTR positive) are shown. Images were all acquired for 750 K counts at 1 hour and processed with a 256 × 256 matrix. F Mean : mean counts; Max : max counts; SD: standard deviation of counts; Total : total counts; Area : area of the region of interest (mm 2 )
Optimal Protocol Recommendation
The different protocols studied produced images of similar quality and all had moderately to highly correlated H/CL ratios as well as reproducible semiquantitative scores. Due to shortest overall study time (1 vs 2 to 4 hours) and lowest radiation exposure (3 vs 8 to 10 mSv), a protocol using 10 mCi of 99m Tc-PYP with scans acquired for 750 K counts at 1 hour and processed with a 256 matrix was chosen. This protocol had high correlation and reproducibility as well as comparable or improved image quality relative to other imaging parameters. A full summary of the standardized imaging protocol is presented in Table 4 .

Discussion
The molecular mechanism underlying myocardial transthyretin amyloid uptake of 99m Tc-PYP uptake has not yet been delineated. 99m Tc-PYP uptake in myocardial infarctions has been attributed to high calcium levels in the mitochondria as part of the repair process. Consequently, one hypothesis proposes that 99m Tc-PYP and 99m Tc-DPD uptake in ATTR-CA patients is due to the binding of calcium in transthyretin amyloid fibers to phosphate in these radiotracers. There is calcium in both myocardial transthyretin amyloid fibrils and light-chain amyloid fibrils. Thus the discrepancy between 99m Tc-PYP uptake in the presence of ATTR-CA versus AL cardiac amyloidosis, may be due to increased calcium content in transthyretin amyloid fibrils relative to AL fibrils, as well as an increased duration of ATTR-CA amyloid fibril accumulation due to a longer disease course. ,
Imaging parameters utilized to scan patients in this study were based on 99m Tc-PYP scintigraphic studies conducted to image myocardial infarctions and European studies deploying whole-body scans to image cardiac amyloidosis with 99m Tc-DPD. , , , , While the molecular structure of 99m Tc-DPD and 99m Tc-PYP is similar, the pharmokinetics of each isotope differ. 99m Tc-DPD imaging protocols involve whole-body scans acquired for 2000 K counts at 3 to 4 hours post an injection of 25 mCi of 99m Tc-DPD. However, 10% of 99m Tc-PYP remains in the heart after 1 hour. Thus, the recommended 99m Tc-PYP protocol is tailored to cardiac imaging and utilizes 750K counts acquired at 1 hour post an intravenous injection of 10 mCi of 99m Tc-PYP, processed with a 256 matrix. Figure 3 demonstrates that as compared to 99m Tc-PYP protocols, 99m Tc-DPD protocols involve acquiring two whole-body scans vs a single chest scan, increased radiation exposure, and longer imaging and study time. Figure 3 Nuclear imaging protocols used to diagnose ATTR-CA with 99m Tc-PYP and 99m Tc-DPD are shown. Imaging with 99m Tc-DPD requires two whole-body scans vs a single chest scan, as well as increased radiation exposure, and longer imaging and study time. WB Scan—Whole-Body Planar Scan; Chest Scan—Planar Chest Scan
Additionally, while the semiquantitative visual scale used to diagnose ATTR-CA with 99m Tc-DPD is similar to the one used for 99m Tc-PYP, the quantitative methodology involves drawing ROIs over the heart, kidney, and bladder, all of which are copied and mirrored over posterior images. 99m Tc-PYP quantitative methodologies to diagnose ATTR-CA are relatively simpler and have 100% specificity and 97% sensitivity. The standardized 99m Tc-PYP protocol not only provides scans with good to excellent image quality and low extracardiac activity, but has decreased radiation exposure and total study time compared to other potential imaging protocols as well as imaging protocols utilizing 99m Tc-DPD.
There are several inherent limitations to the methodology proposed in this study, including the fact that 99m Tc-PYP planar imaging is unable to diagnose AL cardiac amyloidosis. Additionally, all of the subjects studied had advanced ATTR-CA, and the role of 99m Tc-PYP scanning for identification of early ATTR-CA is unknown. Consequently, further studies are needed to evaluate whether this technique can identify ATTR-CA prior to the onset of echocardiographic manifestations.
New Knowledge Gained
Currently, to the best of our knowledge, no standardized imaging protocol using 99m Tc-PYP to diagnose ATTR-CA has been established. European whole-body nuclear imaging protocols using 99m Tc-DPD to diagnose ATTR-CA have been described. The effectiveness of using the same protocol for both isotopes has not been studied. This study is the first of its kind to evaluate optimal imaging parameters and 99m Tc-PYP dosing for planar scanning to diagnose ATTR-CA. An imaging protocol using 750 K counts, 10 mCi of 99m Tc-PYP, and a 256 matrix was chosen as the standardized imaging protocol since it provided the shortest overall study time (1 vs 2 to 4 hours) and lowest radiation exposure (3 vs 8 to 10 mSv).
Conclusion
In this study, we established a 99m Tc-PYP scintigraphy protocol with relatively decreased overall study time and radiation exposure that can effectively diagnose ATTR-CA. This imaging modality is readily available and can be utilized in a variety of centers, and as such is highly relevant to the clinical management of patients with cardiac amyloidosis. In effect, this protocol enables clinicians to identify ATTR-CA with immediacy and accuracy, and will potentially allow for the optimal utilization of upcoming ATTR-CA treatments.
