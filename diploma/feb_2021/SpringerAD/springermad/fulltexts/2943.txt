Introduction
Unilateral oophorectomy is performed in children for ovarian tumor, infection or torsion, although the pediatric prevalence of unilateral oophorectomy is unknown [ ]. These children represent a challenge for the evaluation of ovarian pathology in the single remaining ovary because few studies have explored the morphological and physiological effects after oophorectomy.
During the sonographic assessment of ovaries, identifying ovarian disease involves measuring ovarian volume [ , ]. Ovarian enlargement occurs in a variety of pathologies, including ovarian cysts, benign or malignant tumor, torsion, tubo-ovarian abscess or, rarely, endometriosis [ , , ]. To define ovarian enlargement, normal ovarian volumes have been defined in the pediatric population [ , ].
Ovarian enlargement also occurs in physiological conditions. Studies in mice, rats, pigs and opossums have shown that compensatory hypertrophy occurs in the remaining single ovary after contralateral oophorectomy [ , , , , ]. Similar findings of compensatory hypertrophy have been observed in the remaining testis of human boys with monorchism [ ]. To our knowledge, no study has been performed in girls and young women to characterize the remaining ovarian volume after unilateral oophorectomy. If similar compensatory hypertrophy occurs in children after the removal of one ovary, determining the average remaining ovarian volume by ultrasound in these patients might help clinicians to better characterize the potential presence of ovarian pathology. The purpose of this study was to describe average ovarian volumes in pediatric patients who have had contralateral oophorectomy and to compare them with volumes in age-matched controls who have two normal ovaries.
Materials and methods
The University of Pittsburgh institutional review board approved this retrospective study.
We identified patients by searching our pediatric hospital electronic medical record database for females ages 0–18 years who had unilateral oophorectomy and available ultrasound (US) imaging from 2000 through 2017. We collected information about patient age, date of oophorectomy, reason for oophorectomy, side of oophorectomy, surgical and pathological data, date of ultrasound, prior and subsequent ultrasounds, available menstrual history including first day of last menstrual period (LMP) relative to the ultrasound exams, and pregnancy history. We excluded patients if a subsequent oophorectomy was performed on the remaining ovary or if there was a sonographic abnormal finding, such as cyst ( n =11). A cyst was defined as measuring greater than 3 cm in accordance with the 2010 Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound Consensus Conference statement [ ]. All patients were nulliparous. In total, 64 ovaries from pediatric patients with prior unilateral oophorectomy were included.
For comparison, we evaluated pelvic US examinations of consecutive normal female age-matched patients (control group) from July 30, 2017, to Oct. 25, 2017. We obtained information about patient age, date of ultrasound, available menstrual history including first day of LMP relative to US exams, indication for ultrasound, and any pregnancy history. We excluded patients with any abnormality of ovarian size including those with cysts, mass, confirmed precocious or delayed puberty, prior or current pregnancy, or known syndrome such as Turner ( n =33). In total, we included 384 consecutive normal female age-matched ovaries.
Two radiologists (K.A.D., 4 th -year radiology resident, and J.H.S., 4 years of pediatric radiology experience) each reviewed about half the US images and radiology reports of patients who had unilateral oophorectomy and control patients with normal ovaries. They confirmed normal findings and ovary sizes by evaluating both US images and radiology reports. A transabdominal approach was used in all cases. The ovaries were measured in three dimensions, with depth and length measured on the sagittal view, and width measured on the transverse view. The ovarian volume was then calculated using the formula for a prolate ellipsoid: 0.523 x depth x length x width.
GE Logiq E9 (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI), Philips IU22 (Philips Healthcare, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) and Acuson Sequoia (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Tarrytown, NY) ultrasound machines were used with a variety of transducers appropriate for patient size.
We divided patients in the unilateral oophorectomy and control groups by first and second decades of life (0–10 and 11–18 years, respectively). We also divided the patients by their menstrual status into premenarchal and menstruating groups. Patients were included in the menstruating group if LMP date was known, and they were excluded from the group if LMP was unknown. The menstruating patients were further divided into follicular, pre-ovulatory and luteal phases of menstrual cycle according to the first day of their LMP, as described by Cohen et al. [ ] in 1990.
For each decade of life, menstrual stage and menstrual phase, we calculated the mean ovarian volumes. We analyzed the mean ovarian volumes using the two-tailed Student’s t -test, and P ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
The mean age of the 192 total patients in the control group was 12.0 years (range 1 day to 18 years). The mean age of the 64 total pediatric patients with unilateral oophorectomy was 11.1 years (range 2 months to 17 years). The left ovary was removed in 55% of patients ( n =35) and the right was removed in 45% ( n =29). The mean time interval between oophorectomy surgery and US examination was 588 days, with a range of 9–6,011 days. The most common pathologies of the removed ovary were torsion and teratoma (Table 1 ). The most common indication for ultrasound for the oophorectomy cohort was pain and postoperative tumor surveillance, while the most common indication for the normal cohort was pain (Table 2 ).

Higher mean ovarian volume (mL) was observed in the 26 patients in the first decade of life with prior oophorectomy when compared to 146 control ovaries (3.2±3.7 mL vs. 1.8±1.7 mL, P <0.003). Similarly, higher mean ovarian volume was seen in the 38 patients in the second decade of life with prior oophorectomy compared to 238 control ovaries (10.6±5.1 mL vs. 5.8±3.2 mL, P <0.0003). These findings are summarized in Table 3 . Additionally, there was a statistically significant increase in ovarian volumes from the first to second decades of life within the unilateral oophorectomy group ( P <0.0005) and separately, within the control group ( P <0.0003). The mean age for the control patient cohort in the first decade of life was 7.5 years, with a range from 1 day to 10 years of age, compared to a mean age for the oophorectomy patient cohort of 6.1 years, with a range from 2 months to 10 years of age. The mean age for the control patient cohort in the second decade of life was 14.7 years with a range of 11–18 years, compared to a mean age for the oophorectomy patient cohort of 14.6 years with a range of 11–17 years.

When dividing patients by menstrual status, higher mean ovarian volume was also demonstrated in the unilateral oophorectomy group compared to the control group in the premenarchal and menstruating stages, differences that were statistically significant (2.6±3.9 mL vs. 1.5±1.5 mL, P <0.05, and 11.7±5.2 mL vs. 6.3±3.3 mL, P <0.0001, respectively). These findings are presented in Table 4 . The ovarian volumes additionally showed a statistically significant increase from the premenarchal to menstruating stages in the unilateral oophorectomy group ( P <0.0003) and within the control group ( P <0.0002). Of note, patients and ovaries were excluded from the menstruating group if LMP was not known.

The menstruating patients were separated according to phase of menstrual cycle. Higher mean volume was observed in the follicular (10.9±5.3 mL vs. 5.7±2.8 mL, P <0.0001), pre-ovulatory (11.8±4.4 mL vs. 6.6±3.4 mL, P =0.0005) and luteal phases (13.6±5.8 mL vs. 6.9±3.5 mL, P <0.0003) in the unilateral oophorectomy group compared to the control group (Table 5 ). There was no significant difference between the ovarian volumes of each menstrual phase within the unilateral oophorectomy group. In the control group, no significant difference was observed between the ovarian volumes of the follicular and pre-ovulatory phases, and the pre-ovulatory and luteal phases in the control group, but a significant difference was observed between the ovarian volumes of the follicular and luteal phases ( P <0.02).

This study also provides an updated reference of normal pediatric ovarian volumes. Table 6 summarizes our findings compared to previously reported normative ovarian volumes for patients of similar age groups, menarchal statuses and menstrual cycle phases; the new volumes all fall within 2 standard deviations of previously reported values [ ].

Discussion
We observed higher mean ovarian volumes in the remaining ovary after contralateral oophorectomy in all pediatric age groups, menstrual stages and menstrual cycle phases, compared to control ovaries. The results are concordant with animal study findings of compensatory hypertrophy in the remaining ovary [ ]. In studies in mice and rats with prior unilateral oophorectomy, the mechanism behind this change is thought to relate to increased pituitary gonadotropin secretion [ , , ].
Ovarian enlargement can be seen in the setting of ovarian pathology, such as tumor, infection or torsion. It is important to note that Doppler findings can be normal in the setting of ovarian torsion, and ovarian enlargement is the most common abnormality [ ]. Absolute volume >75 mL, ovarian diameter ratio >2.3, as well as ovarian volume ratio of >12–15:1 have been suggestive of torsion in prior publications [ , , ]. Conversely, when ovarian volume is below 20 mL, the suspicion for ovarian torsion in the menarchal female is extremely low [ ]. Despite higher mean ovarian volumes observed across all age groups, menstrual stages and menstrual cycle phases, mean ovarian volumes after contralateral oophorectomy remain under the threshold of 20 mL, including in the menarchal group.
Morphologically, the remaining ovary post unilateral oophorectomy demonstrates a similar growth pattern to normal ovaries across the menstrual cycle. For both the unilateral oophorectomy and control groups, there was no significant difference between the ovarian volumes of the follicular and pre-ovulatory phases, and the pre-ovulatory and luteal phases. When estimating normal ovarian volumes by ultrasound in menstruating patients, Cohen et al. [ ] also found no significant difference between ovarian volumes among the menstrual cycle phases in 1990.
Our study addresses the paucity of literature investigating ovarian volumes in humans and pediatric patients in the remaining ovary after contralateral oophorectomy. An additional strength of this work is that the characteristics of the unilateral oophorectomy population in this study are similar to those in previous publications. In pediatric patients undergoing unilateral oophorectomy for emergent and non-emergent conditions, Cass et al. [ ] and Quint and Smith [ ] found that torsion and teratoma were also among the most common pathologies in the removed ovary, like in our patient population. Finally, we provide updated values for normal pediatric ovarian volumes from a relatively large sample size ( n =384).
Compared to normal ovarian volumes from similar age groups, menstrual stages and menstrual cycle phases from prior works, our unilateral oophorectomy group had higher mean ovarian volumes. Work by Cohen et al. [ ] showed smaller normal ovarian volumes in the first and second decades of life at 1.7±1.4 mL and 7.8±4.4 mL compared to corresponding age groups in the oophorectomy cohort. Smaller normal mean ovarian volumes were also seen in premenarchal (3.0±2.3 mL) and menstruating (9.8±5.8 mL) patients, and during the follicular (9.7±6.1 mL), pre-ovulatory (10.2±7.1 mL) and luteal (9.4±5.6 mL) phases in comparison to the oophorectomy group. Similarly, work by Herter et al. [ ] in 2002 showed smaller normal mean ovarian volumes in girls ages 1–10 years with a range from 0.3±0.1 mL to 1.2±0.2 mL. An older study by Orsini et al. [ ] in 1984 looked at girls ages 2–10 years and also found smaller normal mean ovarian volumes with a respective range from 0.8±0.4 mL to 2.2±0.7 mL compared to the oophorectomy group. For girls ages 10–17 years, Ivarsson et al. [ ] found a range of normal mean ovarian volumes from 0.7 mL to 5.8 mL.
There are limitations of this study. As a retrospective study performed over a 17-year period with a variety of patient ages and sizes, a strict sonographic protocol could not be applied for every examination, but imaging was considered diagnostic for all cases. The radiologists were not blinded to oophorectomy status during the review, which could introduce bias. Also, the power of the study is limited by the relatively small sample size of 64 total pediatric unilateral oophorectomy patients. In addition, although the LMP for patients is known and recorded in our electronic medical record database, the premenarchal group was assumed to be equal to or less than 9 years of age because the patients were not clearly labeled as prepubertal in the electronic medical record. Furthermore, while menstrual cycle length can vary in the first few years after menarche, most cycles still fall within a 21- to 45-day range, with the majority of cycles ranging 21–35 days (typical adult cycle length) by the third post-menarchal year [ , , ]. Ovarian volumes were also not categorized according to height and weight because this information was not available at the time of retrospective view. Additionally, routine ultrasound follow-up of patients after oophorectomy was not performed at our institution, and so because we do not have baseline sonographic measurements of the remaining ovary immediately after surgery, we cannot describe the time it takes compensatory hypertrophy to occur or the rate of compensatory hypertrophy in the remaining ovary after oophorectomy. Finally, this study does not address the mechanism causing compensatory hypertrophy.
Future prospective studies might better describe potential sequential changes occurring in the remaining ovary before and after surgery with regard to time. Such studies would prove useful in characterizing whether the ultimate volume of the ovary is affected by oophorectomy surgery performed at a certain age or pubertal status.
Conclusion
Ovarian enlargement occurs in both ovarian pathology and in the remaining normal ovary after unilateral oophorectomy. To help differentiate between ovarian pathology and compensatory hypertrophy in children who have had unilateral oophorectomy, we provide reference values for the remaining ovary for various age groups, menstrual stages and menstrual cycle phases. Mean ovarian volumes are higher in girls and young women with unilateral oophorectomy compared to those with two normal ovaries, but the mean volumes remain below 20 mL for all ages.
