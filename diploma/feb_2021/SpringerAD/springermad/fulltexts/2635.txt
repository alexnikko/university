Introduction
Growing prevalence of obesity makes it one of the biggest health challenges in the world (Ayatollahi and Ghoreshizadeh ; Kelishadi et al. ; Shi et al. ). Relationship of obesity with development of many chronic diseases such as metabolic disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer adds further concern about it (Conway and Rene ). Very few treatments are effective for severe obesity. Interventions such as diet, increased physical activity, or drug therapy almost always failed to achieve a significant and sustainable weight loss in these patients. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is one of the surgery procedures which is popular because of its relative ease and less-invasive technique (Brethauer et al. ; Gumbs et al. ; Shi et al. ). However, one of the problems of all surgical procedures which can endanger patients’ health is occurrence of complications after surgery. Management of some post-operative complications such as bleeding, sepsis, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism, stroke, and acute myocardial infarction is difficult and can threaten the patient’s life (Gumbs et al. ; Mittermair and Renz ; Shi et al. ). Therefore, investigation of complications after surgery can help medical staff to reduce their risks. So, the aims of the present study were to investigate the correlation of anthropometric measures and both short-term and long-term surgical complications in obese patients who underwent LSG.
Materials and methods
Patients
All patients referred to the obesity center of Ghadir Mother and Child specialized hospital in Shiraz, Iran, from January 2012 to January 2013, were evaluated. Fifty-four patients over 20 years old with BMI between 35 and 55 by non-randomized sampling participated in this cross-sectional study. The exclusion criteria were any cardiovascular problems that endanger the patient’s life, special circumstances that prevent post-operative diet and physical activity, lack of diet, and lack of walking as 45 min, 3–5 times a week. Informed written consent was obtained before participation in the study. The study protocol was approved by the Human Ethics Committees of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences. All experiments on human subjects were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Measurements
Primary data collection was done 3–5 days before surgery. Demographic data were recorded by a questionnaire. Physical activity levels and anthropometric measurements were recorded before and after surgery. Physical activity levels were classified as sedentary, low active, active, and very active. Anthropometric measurements included body weight (BW), height, body mass index (BMI), arm circumference (AC), waist circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and conicity index. Height and BW were measured after overnight fasting. BMI was calculated based on this formula:
$$ \mathrm{BMI}\ \left(\mathrm{kg}/{\mathrm{m}}^2\right)=\frac{\mathrm{Weight}\ \left(\mathrm{kg}\right)}{\mathrm{Height}\ {\left(\mathrm{m}\right)}^2} $$
A non-stretch plastic tape was used for the circumference measurements. AC was measured at the midpoint of the arm. WC was measured around the abdomen on the midpoint between the lower border of the rib cage and the iliac crest, while the participant was standing with the abdomen relaxed, both feet touching, and arms hanging freely at the end of a normal expiration. HC was measured at the maximum circumference of the buttocks. WHtR and WHR were calculated on the basis of WC, height, and HC. Conicity index was calculated as follows (Musaad et al. ; Wei et al. ):
$$ \mathrm{Conicity}\ \mathrm{index}\ \left(\raisebox{1ex}{${\mathrm{m}}^3$}\!\left/ \!\raisebox{-1ex}{$\mathrm{kg}$}\right.\right)=\frac{\mathrm{Waist}\ \mathrm{circumference}\ \left(\mathrm{m}\right)}{0.109\times \sqrt{\raisebox{1ex}{$\mathrm{weight}\ \left(\mathrm{kg}\right)$}\!\left/ \!\raisebox{-1ex}{$\mathrm{height}\ \left(\mathrm{m}\right)$}\right.}} $$
Data about surgical complications was extracted from medical records and/or using direct contact with the patients. Short-term complications include those occur immediately or during a week after surgery such as gastric or intestinal perforation or leakage, which causes the abscess, internal bleeding, severe wound infection, wound dehiscence, damage to spleen or other organs, ileus obstruction, lung problems (pneumonia, the collapse of the lungs tissues, fluid in the chest, inappropriate breathing, pulmonary edema, emboli, and DVT), heart problems (heart attacks, heart arrhythmia, and heart failure), liver and kidney problems, acute renal failure, liver failure, hepatitis, mental problems, anorexia, and death. Long-term complications occur after 12 months post-operation and included gallstones, depression, social problems, ulcers, minerals, vitamin and protein deficiency, weight gain, lack of weight loss, and abnormal lowering blood sugar.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 18 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Normality of data was assessed through Shapiro-Wilk test. Descriptive statistics were reported. Comparisons of the anthropometric variables of participants before and after the surgery were done using paired sample t test. Comparisons of the anthropometric variables in the participants with and without surgery complications were done using independent sample test. Analysis of the correlations between variable was done using chi-square and Fisher’s exact test when more than 20% of cells with expected count of less than five were observed. P < 0.05 was considered as significant difference.
Results
Pre- and post-operative BW, height, HC, WC, and WHtR, plus pre-operative WHR and post-operative conicity index, had normal distribution. Descriptive analysis of 54 participants (12 men and 42 women) is shown in Table 1 . Post-operative BW, BMI, AC, WC, HC, WHtR, and conicity index were significantly lower than pre-operative indices ( P < 0.05). In addition, comparison of the physical activity level before and after surgery using Wilcoxon test showed significant difference between these variables ( P < 0.001). Table 1 Mean and SD of different variables before and after operation Variables Pre-operative Post-operative P value Age (year) 33.26 ± 10.17 Height (cm) 166.00 ± 8.46 Weight (kg) 125.56 ± 23.92 84.57 ± 16.41 < 0.001 BMI (kg/m 2 ) 45.31 ± 8.70 30.36 ± 6.54 < 0.001 Arm circumference (cm) 41.44 ± 6.49 29.87 ± 6.35 < 0.001 Waist circumference (cm) 122.50 ± 16.00 101.48 ± 16.26 < 0.001 Hip circumference (cm) 131.67 ± 17.97 108.89 ± 17.20 < 0.001 Waist-to-height ratio 0.74 ± 0.10 0.61 ± 0.10 < 0.001 Waist-to-hip ratio 0.93 ± 0.07 0.94 ± 0.13 > 0.05 Conicity index ( \( m3/ kg \) ) 97.93 ± 19.20 66.71 ± 15.11 < 0.001
Frequencies of short- and long-term complications are shown in Fig. 1 . Totally, 13 and 37% of patients had short- and long-term complications, respectively. Among them, the most frequent short-term complications were hypoglycemia (3.7%) and fever (3.7%). Other short-term complications such as wound infection, leak, tachycardia, perforation of the stomach or intestines, damage to the spleen or other organs, lung problems, emboli, liver or renal failure, hepatitis, anorexia, and death were not seen. The most frequent long-term complication was hair loss (18.5%). No sepsis, myocardial infarction, depression, ulcer, and failure to lose weight were recorded as long-term complications.

Patients with short-term complications just had significantly differed in post-operative HC in comparison to patients without short-term complications ( P = 0.04), while patients with long-term complications were significantly differed in pre-operative AC ( P = 0.02), HC ( P = 0.003), WC ( P < 0.001), WHtR ( P < 0.001), conicity index ( P =0.003), and post-operative HC ( P =0.04), WC ( P =0.04), and WHtR ( P =0.02) in comparison to patients without long-term complications.
The significant positive correlation between pre-operative AC and long-term complications (rho = 0.34, P = 0.01) and post-operative HC and short-term complications (rho = 0.30, P = 0.03) and significant negative correlation between post-operative WHR and short-term complications (rho = − 0.32, P = 0.02) were detected. There was no significant correlation between sex and surgery complications and between physical activity level and surgery complications ( P > 0.05).
Discussion
The dramatically increased numbers of individuals with obesity worldwide have caused to amplified attraction to surgical treatments to achieve sustainable weight loss. LSG is a low-risk and safe procedure for the management of obesity (Brethauer et al. ; Gumbs et al. ; Shi et al. ). However, any surgery procedure will impose a series of complications to the patients. Some of these complications are very dangerous and can threaten a person’s life. As a result, assessing the affecting factors on surgery complication has a great importance. The literature is lacking in terms of association of surgery complications and anthropometric measures.
We evaluated the association of anthropometric indices with short- and long-term complications after LSG in people with obesity. Our findings demonstrated that the most frequent short-term complications were hypoglycemia and fever, while the most frequent long-term complication was hair loss. One of the measurements frequently used to screen obesity is BW and BMI. However, these measures are limited because they cannot determine the differences between fat mass and muscle mass (Santana et al. ; Wise et al. ). Other anthropometric measures such as WC, WHR, and WHtR are being considered to show body fat distribution. It is reported that negative effects of these measures are much profound than BMI and these measures are more sensitive to predict the risk of obesity-related diseases. These evidences bold the importance of identifying the anthropometric measurements which can affect the complications after surgery (Kahn et al. ; Lofgren et al. ; Musaad et al. ; Valdez ; Valdez et al. ).
According to our knowledge, no study has investigated the relationship between different anthropometric indices and complications after surgery in people with obesity. Pre-operative factors considered in most studies include diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, asthma, arthritis, sleep apnea, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and depression (Cawley et al. ; Shi et al. ). Wei et al. investigated the effect of anthropometric indicators of obesity on pulmonary function in adult people with obesity before surgery. They reported that WHtR is more sensitive in predicting cardiovascular risk than body mass index (Wei et al. ). Musaad et al. compared the anthropometric measures of obesity including WC, WHtR, and conicity index in childhood allergic asthma. They reported that these measures are more associated with the presence of asthma and asthma severity in children with allergic rhinitis when compared with standard BMI measures (Musaad et al. ).
The short-term complication rate in the present study was 13% that was in the reported range. Flum et al. have followed patients for 1 year and showed that the death rate after sleeve gastrectomy increased from 2.2% after 30 days to 4.6% after 1 year (Flum et al. ). In the present study, the death rate after 12 months was 1.9%. It was similar to the reported range in the previous studies. The long-term complication rate in the present study was 37%. The results showed that pre-operative BW, BMI, AC, WC and HC, WHtR, conicity index, and physical activity level were significantly different from post-operative measures. Furthermore, pre-operative HC and post-operative HC had significant differences between groups with and without short-term complications. In addition, pre-operative AC, pre-operative HC, post-operative HC, pre-operative WC, post-operative WC, pre-operative WHtR, post-operative WHtR, and pre-operative conicity index had significant differences between groups with and without long-term complications. While BW and BMI did not show significant association with short-term or long-term surgery complications, several studies have reported the central obesity as the main measures of obesity-associated morbidity in many diseases. Although BMI has assessed frequently in many studies in obesity, recent investigations have concluded that it is a measure of body weight and not of obesity. These results of the present study agree with the findings of the previous studies which have reported that central obesity measures are more informative than BMI in people with obesity (Buchholz and Bugaresti ; Janssen et al. ; Lofgren et al. ; McCarthy et al. ; Musaad et al. ; Wei et al. ).
Limitations
There are some limitations of this study. First, the analyses of the study were done on a small sample size (all patients who undertaken LSG during 12 months in Ghadir Mother and Child specialized hospital). Second, the results are based on cross-sectional data and it is not generalizable to all obese population because it was performed in one surgical center in Shiraz.
Conclusion
All anthropometric parameters of obesity measured, except for BW and BMI, were associated with complications after LSG in people with obesity and can better explain the likelihood for having complications after LSG. Consequently, a greater emphasis should be placed on central obesity measures coupled with AC compared with BMI in population with obesity.
