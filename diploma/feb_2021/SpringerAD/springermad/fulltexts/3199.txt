Introduction
Herbal medication plays an important role in cancer therapy; as naturally occurring flavolignan, deoxypodophyllotoxin (DPT) displays anti-proliferative and anti-tumor activities in multiple cell types such as cell line Hela [ , ], cell line HL-60 [ , ], NCI-H460 (H460) and multi-drug resistant cell line C-6, HepG2 [ ], and K-562 [ ]. According to previous reports, DPT could bind directly to tubulin to induce destabilization and prevent microtubules assembly. This eventually causes cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase associated with the capacity to alter the expression of cyclins A and B1 proteins in tumor cells. The anti-angiogenic and vascular disrupting effects of DPT have been considered as an important component of tumor treatment by anti-angiogenic therapy [ ]. Moreover, DPT displays some other functions such as anti-inflammatory [ ], anti-viral [ ], and anti-allergic activities [ ]. However, all the results above come from in vitro experiments. DPT’s water insolubility delayed in vivo study and its possible use for intravenous injection in clinical practice. Thus, researchers have made efforts to enhance its water solubility by preparing DPT inclusion complex with sulfobutyl ether-β-cyclodextrin (SBE-β-CD) [ ] and mPEG-PLA micelles nanoparticles [ ] to facilitate chemical stability after parenteral drug administration. The former method increased the solubility of DPT in water from 0.5 mg/L (insoluble form) to 5 g/L (relatively soluble form) whereas the latter one improved DPT pharmacokinetic profile based on solubility enhancement.
Recently, liposomes have been widely studied as a potential vehicle for small molecular drugs, especially anti-tumor drugs. Liposomes have been employed as a very favorable way of modifying the therapeutic profile, ensuring higher stability, better biocompatibility, nontoxicity, biodegradability, and controlled release for modulating encapsulated drugs [ , ]. Unlike most normal tissues or organs, solid tumors possess unique pathophysiological characteristics, such as extensive angiogenesis and defective vascular architecture, and enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [ , , , , ]. Compared to most free drugs, liposomes are expected to be accumulated preferentially in various types of solid tumors due to this particular effect and likely to be retained in the blood for a relatively longer period of time. The uptake of nanoparticles by macrophages in the reticuloendothelial system (RES) leads to a rapid drug concentration decline in the blood which should be avoided to achieving an efficient EPR effect-based passive drug targeting [ , , ].
It has been proved that controlled release of drugs in the vicinity of the target tissues may lead to improved therapeutic availability [ , , ]. Furthermore, long blood-circulating nanoparticles could slowly accumulate in tumor, inflammation, or infarcted sites and have been shown to preferentially accumulate in tumors due to the leaky nature of microvasculature in solid tumors [ , ]. In that case, various strategies such as the surface modification of nanoparticles with phosphatidylinositol or polyethylene glycol (PEG) have been developed to avoid the constraints mentioned above. As the most popular and successful method to obtain long-circulating and biologically stable liposomes, several studies have reported that PEGylation enhances storage stability by preventing larger vesicle formation between liposome particles and produced hydration layer to lessen opsonic protein approaching which simultaneously increase systemic exposure whiles decreasing blood clearance. After intravenous or subcutaneous administration, a remarkable influence on the pharmacokinetic profile and tissue distribution of the carrier and encapsulated drug is therefore likely to be achieved [ , , , , , , ].
Yoshizawa et al. [ ] used PEG as surface modification of emulsion and liposome to improve their in vivo behavior. According to the results, the effect of PEGylation on the pharmacokinetics was more remarkable on liposome than that of the emulsion; AUC of PEGylated liposome indicated a 3.6-fold availability of naked liposome, demonstrating extensively PTX encapsulated blood stability enhancement after intravenous dosing of PTX-PEG liposomes into normal rats. The in vivo studies also confirmed that PTX-PEG liposomes delivered significantly larger amount of PTX to tumor tissue and possess more excellent anti-tumor efficacy than PTX-naked liposomes. Gill et al. [ ] loaded PTX into PEG 2000 -DSPE and vitamin E-TPGS combined micelles which prolong its chemical stability over 45 days and enhance its in vitro anti-tumor efficacy. Wei et al. [ ] modified PEGylated liposome system by lactoferrin (Lf) to improve drug efficacy in hepatic cancer cells. The in vitro and in vivo results suggested that, Lf and PEGylated liposome system promoted accumulation in Heps cells while reducing the toxicity of the therapy. Long blood-circulating nanoparticles modified by PEG have been shown to preferentially accumulate in tumors due to the EPR effect in solid tumors.
Herein, we optimized the formulation of DPT-loaded long-circulation liposomes (DPT-LCLPs) and then characterized in details. In vitro and in vivo evaluation studies were further used to verify the long blood-circulating ability and its high anti-tumor efficacy via PEG modification. The in vitro cytotoxicity of DPT-loaded DPT-LCLPs on HepG2 cells were estimated by using the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The in vivo studies have further been carried out to confirm the long blood-circulating ability via pharmacokinetic studies, and anti-tumor efficacy against Heps tumor xenograft models, respectively.

Soybean phosphatidylcholine (SPC, Lipoid S100) was purchased from Lipoid (Ludwigshafen, Germany). Cholesterol (CHOL, >95 %) was purchased from Aladin Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Poly (ethylene glycol) 2000 -distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine (PEG 2000 -DSPE) was obtained from the Advanced Vehicle Technology Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). Trehalose was supplied by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Piscataway, Japan). Human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 and murine hepatic carcinoma (Heps) tumor cells were obtained from China Pharmaceutical University College of Life Science and Technology (Nanjing, China). All of the cell culture media and reagents were purchased from TransGen Biotech Co., Ltd (Beijing, China). Other reagents and solvents were of analytical or HPLC grade without further purification unless otherwise stated.
Animals
Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (200–250 g, male and female) and Kunming (KM) mice (18–22 g, male), obtained from the Shanghai Silaike Laboratory Animal Limited Liability Company were pathogen-free and allowed access to food and water. The experiments followed the regulations of the Administration of Affairs Concerning Experimental Animals.
Preparation and Characterization of Long-Circulating DPT-Loaded Liposomes
The long-circulating DPT-loaded long-circulating liposomes (DPT-LCLPs) were prepared by thin-film dispersion method [ ]. Briefly, SPC, CHOL, DPT and PEG 2000 -DSPE (50:10:3:9, wt/wt) were dissolved in 30 mL of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v / v ) and the organic phase was removed by vacuum rotary evaporator over night at 40 °C; 30 mL of phosphate buffered solution (Tris-HCl, 0.05 M, pH 8.0) was added to obtain the DPT-LCLPs suspension by rotary evaporation at 40 °C. Afterwards, the suspension was treated with probe-type ultrasonic for 120 cycles (200 W, endure 2 s and interval 2 s). The solution was filtered with a 0.45-mm-pore-sized microfiltration membrane to remove the un-encapsulated DPT from liposomes solution; 2 % trehalose was optimized as lyophilized protective (wt/vol); the dried powder of DPT-LCLPs was obtained using a freeze dryer system (Sibo, China). The entrapment efficiency (EE) and drug-loading (DL) were calculated by the following equations: $$ \mathrm{E}\mathrm{E}\left(\%\right)=\frac{\mathrm{weight}\;\mathrm{of}\;\mathrm{D}\mathrm{P}\mathrm{T}\;\mathrm{in}\;\mathrm{liposomes}}{\mathrm{weight}\;\mathrm{of}\;\mathrm{D}\mathrm{P}\mathrm{T}\;\mathrm{fed}\;\mathrm{in}\mathrm{itially}}\times 100\% $$ $$ \mathrm{D}\mathrm{L}\left(\mathrm{wt}\;\%\right)=\frac{\mathrm{weight}\;\mathrm{of}\;\mathrm{D}\mathrm{P}\mathrm{T}\;\mathrm{in}\;\mathrm{liposomes}}{\mathrm{weight}\;\mathrm{of}\;\mathrm{D}\mathrm{P}\mathrm{T}\;\mathrm{in}\;\mathrm{liposomes}+\mathrm{weight}\;\mathrm{of}\;\mathrm{lipid}\;\mathrm{fed}\;\mathrm{in}\mathrm{itially}}\times 100\% $$
The concentration of DPT was determined by HPLC. Briefly, 20 μL samples were injected into a Shimadzu instrument with a UV detector (LC-10AT VP, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The mobile phase used was acetonitrile/water (55:45, v / v ) with detection at a wavelength of 224 nm. A Hypersil ODS C 18 column (150 × 4.6 mm, Shimadzu, Japan) equipped with a guard column was used with flow rate at 1 mL/min. The HPLC method was applied after validation of specificity, linearity, recovery, precision, accuracy, and stability [ ]. The in vitro and in vivo standard curves were set up and satisfactory linearity was obtained.
Characteristics, including particle size, size distribution, and zeta potential of DPT-LCLPs were measured by Zetasizer 3000 HS instrument (Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK) [ ]. The morphology of DPT-LCLPs was visualized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Briefly, samples were dropped onto copper grids, immersed in 2 % phosphomolybdic acid aqueous solution for 5 min and dried with a filter paper. Finally, the grids were visualized by a transmission electron microscope JEM-200CX (JEOL, Japan).
Stability Studies
The physical stability of liposome was studied by monitoring the changes of particle sizes over time. A measured amount of DPT-LCLPs was dissolved in 10 mL 0.9 % NaCl, DMEM medium with 10 % ( v / v ) FBS or rat plasma to obtain a DPT concentration of 0.20 mg/mL ( n = 3). The incubation experiments were carried out for 24 h at (25 ± 0.5) °C and (37 ± 0.5) °C, respectively. At scheduled time intervals, 200 mL of the sample was diluted in 3 mL of distilled water and the particle size of the liposome was measured and recorded.
Drug Release Studies
The permeability of bilayer was evaluated by the release behavior of DPT from the internal phase of DPT-LCLPs. About 5 mL of the DPT-LCLPs, normal-LPs and DPT-SBE-β-CD (all containing 1 mg DPT) were placed into the dialysis tube (molecule weight cut-off 10,000, Sigma-Aldrich Co., USA) against 100 mL PBS (pH 7.4) which contain 1 % Tween 80 in a shaker (100 rpm, 37 ± 0.5 °C), respectively. At 0, 2, 6, 12, and 24 h, 2 mL of the release media was collected and fresh release media was added. The release amount of DPT was determined by HPLC as described in “ Preparation and characterization of long-circulating DPT-loaded liposomes ”.
In Vitro Cytotoxicity Studies
MTT assays were applied to evaluate the cytotoxicity of blank liposomes and drug-loaded ones. DMEM medium (contain 10,000 U/mL of penicillin/streptomycin) with 10 % ( v / v ) FBS, was used for HepG2 cell culture in a 5 % CO 2 with 90 % relative humidity at 37 °C. Briefly, the cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 5 × 10 3 cells/well and incubated for 24 h. Ten microliters of blank LCLPs, DPT-LCLPs and DPT-SBE-β-CD were added, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C under the same culture condition. Forty-eight hours later, 11 μL of MTT solution (5 mg/mL in PBS) was added to each well and cells were incubated for another 4 h. Then, the medium was removed and 150 μL DMSO was added to each well. The plate was agitated for 10 min and the absorbance was read at a wavelength of 570 nm and 630 nm via an Enzyme Immunoassay Instrument (ELx800, BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT) and the relative cell viability ( R ) and inhibitory rate (IR,%) were calculated as follows: R % = A test / A control × 100 %; IR% = 1 − A test / A control × 100 %, where A test and A control were the absorbance of the cells treated with the test solutions and the blank culture medium (FBS free) as a negative control, respectively.
Pharmacokinetic Studies
The pharmacokinetic behavior of DPT-LCLPs was assessed by the determination of DPT content in rat plasma, and DPT-SBE-β-CD was studied as control. Approximately 6 g DPT-LCLPs lyophilized powder was dissolved in 12 mL 0.9 % sodium chloride injection and sterilized with 0.45 mm pore size microspore films before intravenous injection. SD rats (180–220 g) were randomly divided into two groups ( n = 6). Then, the solutions were injected into the tail vein of rats at a dose of 4 mg/kg. At 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, 120, 240, 360, 480, and 720 min after injection, blood samples (0.2 mL) were collected from the venous plexus of the eye. One hundred microliters of plasma was obtained from blood by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 5 min and 200 μL acetonitrile, 10 μL diazepam (0.75 μg/mL, internal standard) were respectively added before mixing with a vortex mixer for 3 min. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min, 250 μL of upper supernatant was evaporated and re-dissolved in 100 μL acetonitrile again. Then, 20 μL of samples were injected into HPLC system directly and the DPT concentration in rat plasma was calculated using the standard curve. Drug and Statistics for Kinetica 4.4 was used to analyze the pharmacokinetic parameters of the area under the plasma concentration–time curve (AUC 0−τ ), the apparent volume of distribution ( V d ), total body clearance (CL), distribution half-life ( T 1/2α ), elimination half-life ( T 1/2β ) and mean residence time (MRT) of DPT for each formulation.
In Vivo Anti-tumor Studies
To set up the tumor xenograft model, mice were subcutaneously inoculated in the armpit with mice hepatocellular carcinoma cell line Heps (1 × 10 7 cells) suspended in PBS (20 mL). Tumor volume ( V ) was determined by measuring length ( L ) and width ( W ), and calculated as V = L × W 2 /2. Tumor-bearing mice were used as the volume of tumor reached around 100 mm 3 at 5 days post-tumor inoculation. Heps-engrafted mice with similar tumor size (100 mm 3 ) were divided randomly into six groups ( n = 10) and administered every three days with: (1) saline, (2) Etoposide (15 mg/kg), (3) DPT-SBE-β-CD (15 mg/kg), (4) DPT-LCLPs (5 mg/kg), (5) DPT-LCLPs (10 mg/kg), (6) DPT-LCLPs (15 mg/kg) respectively for 14 days.
On the 14th day, the mice were sacrificed and the tumor was extracted, weighed, and washed with saline thrice and fixed in 10 % formalin. Formalin-fixed tumors were embedded in paraffin blocks to prepare hematoxylin and eosin (HE) stained tumor sections for optical microscope (Olympus, Japan) visualization. The survival rates were monitored throughout the study. Tumor volume ( V ) was recorded everyday and tumor volumes were calculated by using the formula V = a × b 2 /2, where a and b were the largest and perpendicular diameter, respectively and V is given in mm 3 . Relative tumor volume (RTV) was calculated as follows: RTV = V n / V 0 , where V 0 was the original volume of tumors and V n was the volume measured everyday ( n = 1∼14, V 1 = V 0 ). Tumor inhibition rate (IR, %) was calculated by the formula: IR% = ( W 0 − W T ) / W 0 × 100 %, where W 0 and W T were the tumor weight of control group and positive groups, respectively.
Statistical Analysis
Data were presented as the mean ± S.D. of at least three independent experiments. The results were analyzed using an unpaired, two-tailed Student’s t -test. Statistical significance was indicated as * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01 or *** P < 0.001.
Results and Discussion
Preparation and Characterization of DPT-LCLPs
The optimal weight ratios of different materials were screened to prepare DPT-LCLPs via a thin-film dispersion method. DPT-loading rate, entrapment efficiency, particle size, and polydispersity index were used as assessment parameters whiles single-factor investigation by central composite design (Design expert 7.0) was employed for formulation optimization. The final optimum preparation conditions were: soybean phosphatide (SPC): cholesterol: DPT = 50:10:3 ( w / w / w ), and PEG-DSPE to total ratio of 0.05:1 (mol/mol). The predicted values obtained from formulation Optimization Model were 4.01 and 92.06 %, while the drug-loading rate and entrapment efficiency were 3.88 ± 0.18 % and 92.45 ± 5.21 % respectively, with a bias (%) less than 3 %. Additionally, the lyophilization condition was investigated by the effects of lyoprotectants/total weight ratio on the size, polydispersity index, and entrapment efficiency of DPT-LCLPs. The liposome size, zeta potential and polydispersity of DPT-LCLPs were 110.5 ± 4.5 nm, −15.06 ± 1.14 mV, and 0.22 ± 0.01 under the optimum preparation conditions. The particle size and morphology of liposomes were detected and the quasi-spherical shapes with multilayer particle diameter ranging from 100 to 200 nm were visualized by TEM in Fig. 1 .

Stability Studies of DPT-LCLPs
In the pharmaceutical field, the application of liposomal formulations in vivo counts on several aspects including drug-loading efficiency, safety, and stability. It is really important for the liposomes to be kept stable away from the attack of plasma proteins in blood until reaching the final target. The change in the particle size of the liposomes is generally monitored in the plasma as a simple but essential index to estimate the stability of the liposomes in vitro. Also, the stability of the liposomes in medium can be estimated in the same way. As shown in Fig. 2 , the particle sizes of DPT-LCLPs incubated with 10 % FBS in DMEM and rat plasma were measured over time and control groups were incubated with 0.9 % NaCl. The curves of particle size over time were obtained, which illustrated that there was no obvious particle size alteration of all groups through the whole 24-h incubation. In the first 12 h, the particle size of plasma group raised slowly, approximately 10 nm. A leap in particle size to about 120 nm, 1.5 times the initial value was observed about 12 h later. Large particles could be seen by the unaided eye around this same period of time. The plasma contained large quantities of proteins and other macromolecules with positive charge, which may dramatically adsorb or combine with DPT-LCLPs since it is negatively charged. It therefore resulted in the growth of the particle size and aggregation between particles by plasma. However, the stability in rat plasma for the first 12 h still indicated that DPT-LCLPs have high stability before reaching the final target. Moreover, the stability in DMEM medium during 24 h illustrated that the cell uptake of DPT-LCLPs was in its original dosage form during the following in vitro cytotoxicity test. Comparing to rat plasma group, the saline group shows more particle size stability with a 10-nm size enhancement. Fig. 2 The particle size variation of DPT-LCLPs in saline, medium and rat plasma
Permeability of DPT-LCLPs
The permeability of liposomes in vitro could partly reflect the release behavior of DPT-LCLPs in vivo. Comparing to DPT-SBE-β-CD (released over 80 % in 4 h), DPT-LCLPs released just over 30 % of its initial drug content during 24 h, while release of DPT from normal liposomes (normal-LPs) without PEG modification was approximately 55 %, as shown in Fig. 3 . Obviously, a remarkable retarded release of DPT from DPT-LCLPs was observed compared with that from normal-LPs during 48 h. In comparison with normal-LPs, the affixation of PEG-DSPE could form hydration layers outside the bilayers and sustain the permeability of the bilayers ensuring an ultimate enhancement of the stability of whole liposome structure. Since the DPT-LCLPs group showed less drug release in vitro, we considered that DPT-LCLPs might stay longer in circulation system until reaching the target and was confirmed with pharmacokinetic studies. Fig. 3 Release profiles of three formulations in 1 % Tween PBS (pH 7.4) at 37 °C ( n = 3)
In Vitro Cytotoxicity
As shown in Fig. 4a , after 48 h incubation, long-circulation liposomes without DPT (LCLPs) showed nearly no cytotoxicity against HepG2 cells with over 90 % of cell viability. The cytotoxicity of DPT-SBE-β-CD and DPT-LCLPs were evaluated against HepG2 cells, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4b , both DPT-SBE-β-CD and DPT-LCLPs inhibited the growth of HepG2 cells; however, DPT-LCLPs showed higher inhibition activity than DPT-SBE-β-CD. The IC 50 of DPT-SBE-β-CD and DPT-LCLPs were 1.58 ± 0.44 and 0.81 ± 0.31 μg/mL, respectively. It was noteworthy that the relatively higher cytotoxicity of DPT-LCLPs compared to DPT-SBE-β-CD was more significant at higher concentrations. We inferred that this phenomenon was caused by the fact that high concentration of PEG-DSPE induced cell membrane structural rearrangements that strengthens the endocytosis of liposomes while the free DPT enters into tumor cells mainly by passive diffusion.

Pharmacokinetic Studies of DPT-LCLPs in Rats
As shown in Fig. 5 , during the initial phase of the formulation, the rapid eliminations of the drug from the blood circulation were observed in both groups after the intravenous injection with DPT-SBE-β-CD group decreased comparatively with 30 % of initial concentration at 10 min after injection. After a slower decrease, the DPT concentration of DPT-SBE-β-CD group in the plasma went below the lowest determination line after 240 min whereas that of DPT-LCLPs group was 720 min. The pharmacokinetic behavior of DPT was altered significantly after encapsulation in liposomes. The DPT-LCLPs was noticeably removed slowly from the circulation relative to that of DPT-SBE-β-CD group. The DPT plasma concentrations over time fitted to two-compartment model analyzed by compartmental model, and the main pharmacokinetic parameters are listed in Table 1 . PEGylation dramatically increased plasma concentrations of DPT and provided AUC that was about 2.39 times larger than that of DPT-SBE-β-CD. It was also found to significantly increase MRT and T 1/2β of DPT, which is 3.24 times and 3.54 times larger than those of corresponding DPT-SBE-β-CD at same dose, respectively. In addition, the CL of DPT-LCLPs was 17.20 ± 2.10, therefore, significantly smaller than that of DPT-SBE-β-CD. Theoretically, the V d should be decreasing instead of increasing. According to our experiments, we supposed that this situation may be caused by the control group. DPT-SBE-β-CD formulation has been confirmed to cause extreme decrease of V d [ ] compared to normal solution. Thus, it may cause this phenomenon. These results clearly indicate that PEGylation markedly reduced the affinity of DPT resulting in the prolonged blood residence time of DPT. It has been generally considered that PEGylation forms a fixed aqueous layer on the surface of nanoparticles via interaction between PEG and water molecule [ ], leading to reduced amounts of serum opsonins associated on the surface, thereby prolonging blood circulation time of nanoparticles [ , ].

In Vivo Anti-tumor Efficacy
At the end of the study, we compared the anti-tumor efficacy of DPT-SBE-β-CD, Etoposide on Heps mice to DPT-LCLPs in different dose. The sacrifice percentage of each group was shown in Fig. 6a with relatively higher death rate of negative group (90 %) as compared to the other groups. The enhancement of survival rate in all treatment groups were noticeable, especially the DPT-LCLPs groups. A comparison between DPT-LCLPs groups indicated that the efficacy of DPT-LCLPs might be dose related since the mice in 10 and 15 mg/kg groups all survived whereas the survival rate in 5 mg/kg was only 80 %. As shown in Fig. 6b , the variation of RTV could be observed and compared apparently to those administered with DPT-SBE-β-CD, Etoposide, and DPT-LCLPs groups within 14 days. Obviously, comparing to DPT-SBE-β-CD and Etoposide, the treatment of DPT-LCLPs groups with the same dosage demonstrated higher tumor inhibition efficiency. Furthermore, from Fig. 6c , the average RTV of rats administered with different doses of DPT-LCLPs further suggested that the efficiency of tumor therapy by DPT-LCLPs was dose dependent. The average tumor weight from different groups in Fig. 6d supported the inference that, anti-tumor efficacy were more evident in groups treated with the same dose of DPT-LCLPs and between dose-related DPT-LCLPs groups. The images of stained tumor tissue section by HE showed the greatest massive cancer cell remission after applying DPT-LCLPs (15 mg/kg; Fig. 7 , arrows indicate cell necrosis in tumor tissue), which presents a substantial evidence of the efficient anti-tumor activity of DPT-LCLPs in vivo. Overall, DPT carried by PEGylation liposome attains the goal of overcoming sequential physiological and biological barriers and improving anti-tumor efficacy in vivo. Furthermore, it was realized that higher anti-tumor efficiency contributed to the prolonged circulation time and improved tumor accumulation as a result of PEG-DSPE modification.

Conclusions
In summary, the design of PEGylation in formulation enhances the water solubility of DPT and provides the possibility of in vivo research for this new anti-tumor drug. Pharmacokinetic studies proved that PEG-DSPE was applied to help liposomes achieve long blood circulation by avoiding uptake of reticular endothelial system (RES) before reaching its final target. Thus, this property endures DPT-LCLPs with precise and safe anti-cancer drug delivery for tumor cells, with largely improved therapeutic efficacy and decreased drug toxicity proved by both in vitro and in vivo study.
