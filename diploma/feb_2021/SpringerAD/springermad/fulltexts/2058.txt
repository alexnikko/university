Introduction
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a main cause of death and chronic disability throughout the world [ ]. Falls and road accidents are major causes of severe TBI [ ], 32 and 18%, respectively [ ]. A study conducted in 2003 showed that 1.224 million of 1.565 million TBIs in the USA are admitted in the emergency department and 290,000 of them are hospitalized, whereas 51,000 die yearly [ ]. In addition, in another study conducted in 2010, it was reported that each year, 1.7 million people in the USA suffer TBI and 53,000 of them die [ , ]. While most TBIs occur in children 0 to 4 years, most cases of hospitalization and death occur in people 65 years old and on the basis of sex, the majority of cases are men. Although TBI is a leading cause of death and disability in children and young people under 45 years [ ], in developed countries with high aging population, it is a major cause of disability in aged people [ ]. Age of TBI occurrence in low and middle income countries differs when compared with high income countries; the occurrence of TBI in young people is higher in low and middle income countries than high-income countries due to the considerable use of motorcycle and bicycle and the existence of traffic problems [ ] and also less life expectancy and physical activity in older people [ ].
Advances in emergency medicine and intensive care have reduced the rate of death due to TBI [ ], but those who survive, suffer neurological and neuropsychological problems [ ]. Primary and secondary neuropathologic changes in people who survive following TBI are accompanied with a variety of detrimental consequences such as cognitive decline, and motor and mental disturbances led to deep negative effects on daily life quality [ ]. Also, the direct and indirect costs for treatment of TBI reach approximately 1.76 million dollars per year [ ].
TBI is presented as a silent epidemic because of the invisible and long-term disabilities resulting from it [ ]. It is an extremely heterogeneous disease due to the different mechanisms of injury (for example, skull impact or acceleration-deceleration whole head), different levels of injury severity, and intracranial and extracranial complications (for example, hypotension, hypoxia, and subarachnoid hemorrhage or epidural hematoma) [ ]. Despite the heterogeneity of TBI, two distinguishable substantial pathologies directly affect the brain: topical injury such as contusions and diffuse axonal injury, the latter of which is not diagnosed by imaging technique due to lack of overt pathology, despite the severe functional disturbance induced by axonal rupture in patients [ ]. Exacerbation of histopathological damage to the brain parenchyma and functional deficiencies over time is an important feature of the TBI [ ]. Recent studies show multiple organ disorder (MOD) syndrome occurs following TBI, and systemic disorders such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, coagulation problems, and cardiomyopathy affect clinical progression of TBI [ , ].
Lack of effective treatments approved for TBI is a major health issue. Despite the fact that the efficacy of more than 130 monotherapies has been shown in animal models of TBI [ ], their clinical effectiveness has not been confirmed. In addition to the heterogeneity of damage mechanisms, factors such as age, sex, drug or alcohol use, comorbidities, multiple trauma, and genetics can affect the effects of an intervention following TBI [ ]. Development of least effective treatments for TBI in relation to the range of damage severity, disease complexity due to the effect of TBI on multiple tissues and cells, the rapid initiation of pathophysiology, the existence of disabilities, and environmental and developmental factors are TBI problems [ , ]. So, TBI is a medical emergency that requires the research to determine the risk factors and develop of interventions for patients.
A prerequisite for the development of new and effective treatments for TBI is obtaining detailed knowledge of cellular and molecular mechanisms of secondary brain injury and also their time profile. Obtaining this knowledge has a medical and useful significance, because despite considerable efforts in the past decade, as yet no special treatment exists for TBI patients [ ]. Experimental evidence suggests that complications resulting from damage in TBI is less in females compared to males [ ] and the neuroprotective effects of female sex hormones have been reported in our and others’ TBI experimental studies [ , ]. Because the clinical studies in this area report conflicting results [ , ], the treatment efficacy of female sexual hormones has not been confirmed. Therefore, in this review, firstly, we attempt to introduce the literature related to the mechanisms of pathological injury in TBI. Secondly we also report the evidence respective to the effects of estrogen and progesterone administration on these mechanisms in the intervals 2012 and 2017, whereby research gaps may be marked in this context. These gaps can be removed through suitable design of experimental and clinical studies; as, clinical effectiveness of many therapies such as estrogen and progesterone is identified, although their neuroprotection has been suggested in TBI animal studies. To illustrate the pathophysiological mechanisms of TBI in the present review, the types of injuries created in TBI are described at first.
Primary and Secondary Injury in TBI
TBI is a multifactorial neurological problem caused by a number of primary and secondary injury mechanisms. In all cases of TBI, immediate and irreversible primary damage occurs following the mechanical impact and next acceleration-deceleration effects in neurons, axons, glia, and blood vessels or skull fractures, and subsequently, rupture of white and gray matter and hemorrhage [ , ]. Factors such as hypoxia, respiratory depression, ischemia, epilepsy, apnea, hematoma, edema, diffuse axonal injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), parenchymal inflammation, lipid peroxidation, NO, and intraparenchymal contusion are involved in creating this damage. The primary injury can be diffuse and local mechanical injury that histopathologically occurs within 100 ms [ ].
Primary injuries and pathophysiological imbalance lead to a series of aggressive agents called delayed nonmechanical secondary injuries, including cerebral ischemia, hypoxia, inflammation, blood-brain barrier (BBB) destruction, excitotoxicity, edema, apoptosis, necrosis, change in energy metabolism, free radical production, and blood-spinal barrier destruction [ , , ] (Fig. 1 ). The severity of secondary injuries in TBI depends on the severity of the primary injury and its location [ ]. Secondary injury processes are responsible for the development of many neurological problems observed after TBI [ ]. So, TBI pathophysiology is accompanied with many detrimental neurobiological outcomes [ ]. Fig. 1 The pathophysiologic mechanisms of traumatic brain injury and inhibited by estrogen and progesterone. BBB blood brain barrier; NMDA N -methyl-D-aspartic acid; NO nitric oxide; E estrogen; P progesterone
In cases where trauma causes a type of injury, many cellular and molecular events are extended by minutes, hours, even to days, leading to cellular damage [ , ]. On the other hand, the activity of several pathological cascades cause diffuse secondary injury that may be invisible for days, weeks, months, or even years after the primary injury [ ]. Although the primary injury is a determinant factor of outcome in TBI patients, the secondary injury caused by physiological disorders brings about a bad outcome in these patients [ ].
Secondary damage (delayed) has two stages: acute and chronic. Acute stage of secondary damage occurs in the first 48 h after TBI and is associated with an inflammatory response in adjacent tissue of damage that causes accumulation of granulocytes, release of DAMPS and chemokines, recruitment of leukocytes, activation of microglia, increased BBB permeability, protein extravasation, formation of edema, intracranial hypertension, cerebral ischemia, and neuronal death at the site of injury. While, the chronic stage of secondary damage begins 48 h after TBI and results in worsened practical outcome after TBI [ , ]. It is known that significant damage, although slow, is created over weeks, months, and years after TBI [ ] and leads to the loss of cognitive function and substantial disability [ ]. Chronic stage of secondary injury is mediated at least in part by invading blood monocytes and lymphocytes via the release of IL-1β, CCl2, and other chemokines expressed in the brain parenchyma [ ]. Impairment in brain function after TBI is caused by secondary injury mechanisms instead of mechanical rupture of axons [ ].
Various animal models for TBI have been designed, including the two common models of closed head injury: the model of falling weight on the skull caused local damage in the cortex and hippocampus underneath it, while lateral impact of weight produces a diffuse TBI. The other model is falling weight by the method of Marmarou that produces a diffuse TBI unlike the other models. Two common models of open head injury are fluid percussion impact (FPI) and controlled cortical impact (CCI), which caused a more uniform injury than other models of head injury. FPI produces more diffuse damage in the white and gray matter than CCI, while CCI results in diffuse damage in white matter [ ].
The efficacy of therapy drug in TBI is assessed by the evaluation of neurological reflexes or motor function [ ] and also the behavioral tests of cognitive function or memory. Neurological severity score (NSS) is the most common, easiest and fastest of the evaluation methods of neurological reflexes and motor skills [ ]. Although motor impairments spontaneously recover within a week, memory and cognitive disorders can be permanent [ ].
Pathophysiological Mechanisms in TBI
TBI is damage induced by an external force that results in the change in performance or pathology of the brain such as mechanical damage to endothelial cells, neurons, and glia [ ]; cell death; the release of molecules, ions, and proteins called danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMP) [ ]; pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines [ , ]; and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS), vascular permeability to inflammatory cells, platelets, and the activity of resident microglia and astrocytes [ , ]. These early events not only increase brain damage but also induce a background for subsequent inflammatory events that lead to an increase in tissue remodeling and repair [ , ]. Understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of TBI is important for neuroprotective evaluations of therapeutic agents, so in this part of the review, we discuss these mechanisms.
Delayed Excitotoxicity
Excitotoxicity is an important neurodegenerative mechanism among most of the neurodegenerative disorders such as traumatic brain injury, and this mechanism is involved in both apoptotic and necrotic neuronal death mechanisms [ , ]. Excitotoxicity mechanisms mainly caused by glutamate have a pivotal role in the secondary injuries post-TBI [ ]. Disturbance in cell calcium homeostasis is a main mechanism that mediates pathological events caused by glutamate excitotoxicity [ ]. Increase in intracellular calcium caused by the activity of NMDA receptors results in mitochondria dysfunction, and increase in the activity of cellular enzymes such as protein kinases, NOS, calpain, and other proteases, calcineurin and endonucleases [ ]. The activity of these enzymes in turn will strengthen the production of free radicals, the destruction of the cytoskeleton, and the damage of DNA and also activate cell death pathways [ ]. Microdialysis studies in human TBI have reported high concentrations of extracellular glutamate after TBI that results in the activation of cell death cascade and the release of excitotoxic molecules [ ]. One of the most important mechanisms of diffuse neuronal dysfunction and damage in TBI is the entry of ions into the neurons and the formation of brain edema caused by excitatory amino acids [ ]. Brain edema and increased intracranial pressure (ICP) cause early death in TBI [ ]. The control of brain edema and increased ICP are the most important problems in the management of acute TBI [ ].
Mitochondria Damage
The production of ROS and RNS, and oxidative stress (OS) are involved in injury after TBI [ , ]. ROS and NOS are extremely reactive chemical species that are involved in aggressive effects in the body because of their reaction to macromolecules such as lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids [ ]. High content of saturated fatty acids and iron in the brain causes sensitivity of the brain neuron membrane to lipid peroxidation [ ]. It seems lipid peroxidation in humans is proportional to the severity of injury [ ]. Lipid peroxidation results in proteins and nucleic acids damage in neurons through the formation of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE) [ ]. Lipid peroxidation causes increasing intracellular calcium following TBI due to the inhibition of astrocyte glutamate transporters [ ], the inhibition of calcium pump [ ], the stimulation of releasing calcium from intracellular stores [ ], and finally, the disruption of mitochondrial membrane [ ]. Mitochondrial dysfunction in TBI happens along with increased lipid peroxidation (4HNE) and protein nitration (3-NT) [ ]. Neuronal mitochondria with high calcium are both the main source of production and the target of free radicals that initiate membrane lipid peroxidation and protein changes which cause irreversible loss of mitochondrial functions including mitochondria respiration, oxidative phosphorylation, ionic transport, and reduction in calcium buffering capacity [ , ]. Early production of radicals and thus an imbalance between oxidant and antioxidant factors occurs following TBI [ ] that causes brain edema and increased ICP.
Delayed Necrosis and Apoptosis
Necrosis and apoptosis in the weeks or months after TBI may be associated with an increase in CSF and plasma proapoptotic proteins of patients [ , ]. Mechanisms involved in apoptosis may be excitotoxicity, inflammation [ ], oxidative stress [ ], calcium accumulation, mitochondria dysfunction [ ], and increase in caspase 3, 8, and 9 [ ] and calpain-mediated proteolysis in the brain [ ].
Inflammation
Inflammatory reaction begins during the first hours after TBI and continues until weeks or months after it because of the activity of inherent inflammatory cells such as microglia and the recruitment of systemic inflammatory cells and macrophages [ ]. The other reason of inflammatory reaction in TBI is an increase in neutrophils, macrophages, and gliosis around the damaged area [ ]. TBI results in local or diffuse damage in all parts of the brain, especially the cerebral vessels and cerebral parenchymal cells, two parts involved in the next inflammatory response of brain [ ]. The acute inflammatory events may take part in the process of secondary damage, while the delayed inflammatory events occur in restoration [ , ].The activated neurons and astrocytes after TBI induce the immediate production of inflammatory interleukins such as extracellular IL-1β and IL-18 [ ] which are the key activators of microglia and other early inflammatory events [ , ]. It has been reported that increase in other cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6, IL-12, and interferon gamma is an additional early event in the inflammatory response [ ]. The increased IL-1β, IL-6, TNF–α, and other pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brain and CSF samples have been reported in the first 6 h after TBI [ , ].
BBB Disruption
BBB dysfunction appears in white and gray matter and brain stem nuclei [ ]. The increase in brain vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) following traumatic brain injury results in BBB permeability through the synthesis and release of NO. In addition, the release in reactive oxygen species and inflammatory cytokines causes the destruction of the BBB and the development of brain edema [ ]. The role of BBB disruption in inflammation following TBI should be considered. Increased ICP causes the entrance of immune cells to the brain through damaged BBB, which induce oxidative damage and cell death via the high production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines [ ].
Seizure and Cortical Diffuse Depolarization
These events occur weeks, months, or years after the injury which results in more vulnerability including cortical diffuse compression following ion imbalance [ ]. The release of Fe and increase in the production of oxygen free radicals following hemolysis cause the release of glutamate and abnormal neuronal toxicity as one of the reasons for the emergence of epilepsy [ ].
Calpains
Calpains, intracellular proteases, mediate cell damage after TBI [ ]. Calpain-mediated proteolysis of the cytoskeleton and membrane causes the appearance of α-spectrin in CSF, one of the markers of calpain activity [ ]. The activity of calpain and calpain- mediated proteolysis of spectrin in experimental TBI occur before cell death [ ].
Diffuse Axonal Injury
Diffuse axonal injury (DAI), a common result of TBI with complex pathophysiology, causes poor outcome [ ]. This injury appears in white matter following local and diffuse TBI and is assayed by measuring β- amyloid precursor protein to show early and progressive axonal damage and determine Valerian degeneration [ , ]. At least two delayed and progressive pathobiologic changes occur following TBI, one is axonal injury that is not a result of tearing traumatic tissue, but rather a result of complex changes in cytoskeleton or axolema and/or both, leading to cytoskeleton collapse and disturbance in the axoplasmic transmission [ ]. Another change in TBI is the increased sensitivity of traumatic brain to secondary ischemia by neurotransmitter storm following TBI that takes part in the induction of DAI and lasts more than 24 h [ ]. Although the initiation of DAI is mechanical, as part of an initial injury, it mainly occurs following secondary damage mechanisms [ ]. The mechanisms of DAI are permeability disorders [ ], calcium-induced proteolysis by calpain [ ], mitochondrial disorders, and caspase activity [ ], in addition to primary and secondary axotomy [ ].
Decrease in Cerebral Blood Flow
This disturbance is associated to the changes in vascular response to various factors according to the severity of TBI [ ]. Decrease in cerebral blood flow (CBF) is dependent on cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), the latter is determined by mean arterial pressure (MAP) and ICP [ ]. Decrease in CBF after TBI could be due to a drop in CPP, failure in autoregulation mechanisms [ ] and increased oxidative stress [ ]. Secondary damage in TBI is affected by changes in CBF, cerebral metabolic disorders and cerebral insufficient oxygenation [ ]. The reduction in CBF impairs the function of ion pumps and thereby causes brain edema and other processes of secondary damage [ ].
Brain Edema
Brain edema, one of the secondary damage mechanisms in TBI, is induced by two underlying mechanisms: (1) cytotoxic edema is characterized by increased water inside the neurons, microglia, and astrocytes following the increase in cell membrane permeability, dysfunction of ion pump and the intracellular accumulation of osmotic active substances [ ]. (2) Vasogenic edema is distinguished by the destruction of BBB [ ]. Brain edema raises ICP which causes cerebral ischemia and death [ ]. Reducing energy supply in TBI augments glycolysis process leading to the accumulation of lactic acid associated with increasing membrane permeability, strengthening edema, and stability of a destructive positive feedback loop. The next step in this pathophysiological cascade is determined by glutamate excitotoxicity.
In summary, although the severity and the locus of the initial injury are the most important factors determining appropriative damage, calcium-mediated excitotoxicity, free radicals, mitochondria damage, inflammation, and apoptosis are discussed as possible targets for therapeutic interventions. The main recommendations for TBI therapy research include (1) selection of treatments affecting multiple targets rather than a single target, (2) usage of sensitive and standard tests for the systemic and comprehensive evaluation of treatments effects on brain injury and restoration processes in the pre-clinical and clinical studies, and (3) performance of effective studies, such as combination therapies.
Given that female sex hormones are the compounds with multiple effects and can affect several targets in treatment, in this review at first, the extragonadal effects of these hormones and theirs receptors and then their neuroprotective mechanisms are described.
Extragonadal Effects of Female Sex Hormones in the Brain
Women constitute almost the half of total population of the world and females’ hormonal changes during sexual cycle, pregnancy, and menopause are associated with differences in cognitive function, and risk and consequences of neurologic deficit [ ]. Apparent sexual dimorphism in cognitive function shows unique effects of female sex hormones on cognitive performance [ ]. It has been reported that the reduced cognitive function in females with age and in ovariectomized women is associated with disturbance in sex hormones secretion and an increase in gonadotropins levels [ , ].
Neurosteroids were used for the first time by Baulieu, who showed the nervous system is an endocrine organ which synthesizes steroid hormones from precursors in circulation [ ]. Neurosteroids, as the molecular signals for neuroendocrine effects, affect the brain development and plasticity [ ]. The role of sex steroid hormones has been suggested in the different brain functions including the development of peripheral and central nervous system, regulation of neurotransmitter systems, synaptic connections, dendritic branching, and myelination. The effects have also been reported on cognition, emotion, mood, and sexual and social behavior [ , ]. These steroids are synthesized by neurons and glia in countless areas of the brain including the hippocampus, hypothalamus, and cortex [ ]. All enzymes necessary for the synthesis of neurosteroids from cholesterol or steroid precursors with environmental origin are expressed in the nervous system [ ]. Different patterns of steroidogenic enzymes expression in neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes are indicative of the assistance of neurons and glial cells in the metabolism of different sex steroids, especially allopregnanolone, testosterone, and progesterone [ ]. Steroidgenesis in the brain is performed by the neuron-glial crosstalk [ ]. Some steroids are produced by glia, whereas glial cells are as targets for steroids and regulate neuronal survival.
Steroids affect neuronal development and function and respond to brain injury via their action on glial cells or their production by these cells [ ]. The proteins involved in cholesterol that transport into mitochondria (the first stage of steroidgenesis) of the nervous system are enhanced following TBI. Thus, increased steroidgenesis is a part of the mechanism used by the brain in response to TBI.
Progestins
Progesterone (P4: Pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione), a steroid hormone 21-carbon, is the most important progestin in humans and is synthesized by several stages [ ]. The starting point for the synthesis of all steroid hormones including progesterone is cholesterol. Progesterone is used as a precursor for the production of estrogen, androgen, allopregnanolone, and adrenocortical steroids. The effects of progesterone may be due not only to progesterone itself, but also the action of hormones produced by its metabolism [ ]. Progesterone is synthesized in brain in addition to the reproductive organs and the adrenal glands. This hormone in the human brain is five times higher than plasma [ , ]. Astrocytes, the most active glial cells, produce neurosteroids such as pregnenolone, progesterone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), testosterone, estradiol, and allopregnanolone. The synthesis of pregnenolone, progesterone, and allopregnanolone associated to glial hyperplasia is enhanced in brain areas adjacent to damage [ ].
Progesterone is synthesized at a similar rate in male and female brains, and has a key role in the evolution of the brain during pregnancy at a thigh rate. The higher level of this neurosteroid may protect brain at the time of injury [ ]. Progesterone neuroprotection by Attella et al. (1987) was reported when it was observed that TBI rats with false pregnancy had better functional outcome and less brain edema compared to females suffering similar damage with natural cycle [ ] . The researchers hypothesized that the observed difference may be related to high levels of sex hormones in false pregnancy. Follow-up studies by Roof and colleagues showed that progesterone administration in both male and female rats experiencing TBI can attenuate cerebral edema and improve functional outcome [ , , ] .
Studies have shown the importance of glial cells as the target for multiple neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory actions of progesterone. Progesterone decreases brain inflammation and edema by reducing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive gliosis, and regulating the expression of aquaporin-4 (AQP4) in astrocytes and microglia [ ] .
Estrogens
17β-estradiol (17βE2) not only originates from the ovaries but is also produced in different areas of the brain such as the hippocampus mainly by neurons and astrocytes through the action of aromatase [ ]. It is the most potent natural estrogen circulating in terms of receptor affinity [ ].
Estrogen has an important role in neuronal activity and protection against damage. More protective actions of estrogen in the brain following injury may be caused by estrogen synthesized within the CNS than derived from the environment [ ]. Immediate actions of estrogen likely occur by estrogen synthesized in the brain through its membrane receptor [ ]. Studies have shown that estrogen inhibits apoptosis [ ], oxidant activity [ ], inflammation [ ], inward Ca++ flow, and calpain activity [ ]. The reduction in estrogen level of aging animals causes the increase in TNF-α level leading to increased oxidative stress and vascular problems [ ]. The increase in estrogen level results in the number of TrkA (tropomyosin receptor kinase A, a neurotrophin receptor effective on the neuronal growth) in astrocytes augmenting 16-fold, the number of which is reduced by ovariectomy, whereas estrogen replacement reverses it [ ].
Cognitive performance is not static in women and changes with endogenous estrogen levels [ ], as the information available indicates that low level of endogenous estrogen causes cognitive decline. Results from animal studies suggest that estrogen influences cognitive outcome and males show better spatial memory than females [ ]. More support for the beneficial effects of estrogen comes from the findings of studies that have reported the exogenous estrogen improves cognitive impairment in postmenopausal and ovariectomized rodents [ ]. In addition, the benefits of estrogen therapy have been studied in a variety of neurotrauma and neurodegenerative diseases including SCI, TBI, ischemia, Alzheimer, and multiple sclerosis [ , ].
Female Sex Hormones Receptors
Estrogen functions are performed by different and complex types of estrogen receptors (ERs) in the brain and the environment. It was previously believed that ERs are found in organs and tissues such as ovary, uterine, breast, hypothalamus and pituitary, and participate in classic reproductive functions. But non-reproductive countless functions of ERs have been diagnosed in several tissues and organs of the body including the brain, cardiovascular system, bone, liver, and immune cells [ ]. The types of ER in the brain are found in brain cognitive areas in relation to learning and memory including amygdala, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and basal forebrain [ ]. ERs have been diagnosed in almost all types of CNS cells, including neurons, astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, and endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells of vessels that mediate effects of exogenous and endogenous estrogen through various physiological mechanisms [ ]. Response to estrogen consumption declines with age [ ] which is probably due to the changes in ER distribution [ ]. When estrogen is consumed after long-term depletion of hormone, the changes in ERα expression or action result in decreasing response to estrogen [ ] and the effects of estrogen neuroprotection post-TBI [ ]. The difference in the ER expression through ER recycling and down regulation following estrogen consumption triggers diverse mechanisms of action causing different biological effects [ ].
The beneficial effects of estrogen in ovariectomized animals TBI are mediated through a variety of receptors containing ERα, ERβ, and GPER1 [ , , ]. The classic (genomic) pathway of estrogen means that this hormone after entry into the cell binds to the cytoplasmic receptor ERα or ERβ and then estrogen-receptor complex migrates into the nucleus following receptor dimerization [ ]. This complex binds to the estrogen response element (ERE) in the nuclear DNA leading to modulation in the expression of estrogen target gene [ ]. Estrogen non-genomic pathway causes immediate effects in different tissues. The non-classical effects (non-genomic) of estrogen are generally mediated by binding estrogen to membrane (Gper1) or cytoplasmic (ERs) receptors resulting in the production of NO and cAMP mediators [ ].
ERβ is expressed at high levels in neurons and glial cells [ ]. Six types of ERβ have been identified in the brain and other tissues, of which ERβ1 isoform has a neuroprotective role and acts as a tumor suppressor, while ERβ2 isoform has significant negative role at the start of oncogenesis [ ]. It has been shown that neuroprotective effects of estrogen by ERα and ERβ depend on the different areas of brain. For example, estrogen by ERα and ERβ promotes the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells [ ], anti-inflammatory effect with an emphasis on ERβ activity [ ], inhibition of brain edema and BBB permeability and improvement of neurologic outcome in diffuse brain injury [ , ]. In addition, estrogen facilitates non-genomic signaling mechanisms in vascular structure [ ] and reduces the signaling elements of GoSK3/AKT/PI3K pathway mainly by ERα [ ]. Studies over the past decade have shown an important physiological role for the membrane ER, ER1 coupled with protein G (GPER1; previously known as GPR30), in the brain and the environment. This receptor mediates several non-genomic signaling actions of estrogen [ ]. Estrogen neuroprotection may be applied through ERα and ERβ signaling mechanisms in a physiological concentration of estrogen, while the antioxidant pathway in a higher concentration independent of ER [ ]. Interactions of ER-female ligand may not be a prerequisite for estrogen neuroprotection [ ].
ERα and ERβ agonists probably act through different signaling pathways [ ]. However, concept of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) is based on the interactions of transcription co-repressor or co-activator with estrogen. The relative percentage of co-repressor and co-activator proteins is notably different in diverse neuronal cells and accordingly, a foreign agent may act as an agonist or antagonist on different neurons.
Progesterone classic receptors similar to estrogen classic receptors are transcription factors activated by ligands that regulate gene transcription. These receptors are expressed in the brain cells with the different number based on rest or reactive cell [ ]. In vivo studies show that the activity of progesterone receptor (PR) decreases cerebral edema, cell death mediators, inflammatory cytokines and reactive gliosis, and increases antioxidant activity [ ]. Progesterone promotes the expression of multiple target genes, particularly growth factors involved in neuroprotection and neurogenesis, and neuronal restoration by binding to its nuclear receptor. These growth factors stimulate neuronal protection and restoration through signaling activity of PI3K/AKT and MAPK and thus enhancement of the anti-apoptotic proteins (like BCL-2) and inhibition of apoptosis [ ].
The findings suggest that the pro-inflammatory response mediated by progestins in TBI takes place through classic PR or independent of classic PR [ ], so membrane receptors in addition to intracellular PRs may be involved in progesterone neuroprotection. The first known progesterone membrane receptor (different from classical intracellular PR isoforms) contains a domain passing through the membrane and is called membrane binding protein 25-DX [ ]. 25-DX receptor in the brain has been identified in hippocampus, circumventricular organs, ependymal cells of the ventricular lining and meninges. This receptor is expressed along with vasopressin in neurons of paraventricular, superaoptic and retrochiasmatic nucleuses. The expression of 25-DX increases after TBI in neurons and astrocytes which are involved in maintaining water homeostasis. Moreover, the expression of membrane receptor mPRα increases following TBI in microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, indicating a role for this receptor in neuroprotection [ ].
In addition to the action mechanisms through its receptor, progesterone can also be metabolized to other neurosteroids like allopregnanolone which exerts its neuroprotective effect through ligand-gated ion channel receptors including GABA A receptors [ , ].
Neuroprotective Mechanisms of Female Sex Hormones
Gender differences in TBI support the fact that females are involved in TBI less than males and also injury outcome including the level and extent of damage in ovariectomized and male rats is more than rats with estrus cycle [ ]. Furthermore, it has been shown that the beneficial effects of female sex on improvement in neurological outcome and reduction in BBB permeability and brain edema after TBI is weakened following ovariectomy [ ]. However, 17βE2 administration weeks before or minutes and hours after TBI decreases the deleterious effects of ovariectomy [ , ]. It has also been reported that rats at proestrus phase had less brain edema and ICP, but more CPP than rats at estrous phase [ ]. In other studies, gender differences have been shown in the size of injury, loss of neuron, poor outcome, and mortality after trauma [ ]. The differences reported between males and females are probably due to differences in levels of sex hormones, especially estrogen and progesterone in both sexes [ ], because these hormones in a variety of brain injury models cause endogenous protection in women or exogenous protection following administration in men and women [ ]. Accordingly, multiple neuroprotective mechanisms of estrogen and progesterone are described separately.
Estrogens
The strongest estrogen of blood, 17βE2, has been used in most studies indicating the beneficial effects of estrogen in TBI, stroke, and Alzheimer [ , ]. Estrogen therapy causes improvement in clinical manifestations and neurological outcome, the reduction in histopathological symptoms, inflammation [ ], size of infarct, mortality [ ] and neuronal injury, the enhancement of retention in delayed memory of males, and the prevention of cognitive impairment in postmenopausal women following neurodegenerative disorders [ , ]. In addition, declining β-amyloid amount [ ] and improved cognitive function have been reported following estrogen therapy in Alzheimer’s disease [ ]. Estrogens affect a different number of cell types, neuronal signaling cascades, and nervous system mediators associated with damage [ ], so the mechanism of estrogen neuroprotective effects is a combination of multiple neurobiological and signaling effects including (Fig. 2 ): 1. BBB. BBB is an important target of estrogen action and its permeability may be adjusted by ERα and ERβ [ , ]. ERα, ERβ, and GPER1 are expressed in cerebral vascular endothelial cells but the most considerable effect of 17βE2 on these cells is mediated through ERα [ ]. Multiple protective actions of estrogens on cerebrovascular system include the regulation of tight junctions proteins, occludin and Claudin-5, the promotion of vasodilation through increasing expression of eNOS, the improvement in mitochondrial function, and the inhibition of vascular inflammation through decreasing endothelial proinflammatory molecules such as cytokines, E-selectin, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1 [ , ]. 17βE2 increases the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) resulting in the dilation of brain blood vessels through both genomic and non-genomic (Akt/PI3K) signaling mechanisms [ , ]. Estrogen resulted in adequate brain perfusion associated with declining cerebral edema and ICP after TBI [ ]. Also, estrogen therapy in TBI models improved CBF and thereby reduced infarction size [ ]. 2. Mitochondrial function. It has recently been found that ER exists in mitochondria and estrogen binds to mitochondrial components including ATPase F0/F1 [ ]. Estrogen improves ATP production and leads to the neuronal survival possibly by moderating intracellular Ca2 + level under conditions of cellular stress and compromising mitochondria action [ ]. 3. Inflammation. Estrogen neuroprotection has been reported against the harmful effects of chronic inflammation conditions such as TBI and spinal cord injury (SCI) [ ]. Estrogen blocks the release of inflammatory molecules including TNF-α, NO, ROS, prostaglandin E2, etc. of microglia [ ]. Inhibitory effects of estrogen on the neural inflammation could be a novel treatment strategy to delay the onset or progression of neurodegenerative injuries through weakened microglial activation. Estrogen decreases the expression of iNOS and thus production of NO, as part of the innate inflammatory response, in addition to the effect on eNOS expression in cerebral vessels [ ].17βE2 anti-inflammatory properties are suppressed during long-term hypoestrogenemia in reproductive aging or middle-aged mice [ ]. In one study it has been implied that the changes in inflammatory cytokines levels of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β and TGF-β1 after TBI following estrogen administration in middle-aged ovariectomized rats are dose and time-dependent [ ]. The estrogen mechanism in this effect is suggested through genomic and non-genomic signaling mechanisms [ ]. 4. Free radicals. Estrogen exerts antioxidant effects by inhibiting the production of ROS and inducing different antioxidant enzymes. Although estrogen is not a strong ROS scavenger [ ], it is very effective in the prevention of ROS production and thus lipid peroxidation [ ]. Estrogen blocks the production of superoxide by promoting ERK1/2 activity [ ] and also activates superoxide dismutase, as a collector of superoxide ions, in vascular tissue [ ]. Other antioxidant enzymes such as catalase and glutathione peroxidase are also regulated by estrogen [ , ]. Estrogen acts as an antioxidant to protect neurons against glutamate toxicity in TBI. The enhancement of antioxidant enzymes has been reported following the administration of estrogen in TBI [ ]. Zlotnik et al. have shown that premarin (a conjugated estrogen) therapy reduces the amount of blood glutamate causing improved neurological outcome in TBI of male rats [ ]. 5. Structure plasticity. Estrogen stimulates CNS plasticity, especially the number of dendritic spines which leads to the changes in cognitive function such as learning or long-term potentiation (LTP) [ ]. This effect of estrogen is mediated by a NMDA receptor-dependent mechanism which is indicative of the ability in the hippocampus structure change [ ]. LTP is strengthened in females during the proestrus phase in which blood estrogen levels are high [ ]. Chronic administration of 17βE2 in ovariectomized animals compensates the effect of hormone depletion on LTP [ ] through binding to ERβ [ ]. Neurogenesis was previously thought to be limited to early neuronal development, but today it has been shown that sex hormones alter the number of neurons in the hippocampus of adult brain [ ] through GPER receptor [ ]. Also, alterations in endogenous estrogen level during sexual cycle have occurred together with dramatic fluctuations in the proliferation of precursor cells [ ]. 17βE2 acute injection into the hippocampus heightens memory function [ ], possibly by increasing cell proliferation [ ] and hippocampal spine density [ ]. 6. Neurotransmitter system, especially cholinergic system. Forebrain cholinergic system is involved in learning and memory and the activity of this system changes with age. Estrogen may alter cognitive consequences by affecting the neurotransmitter systems related to cognition [ ]. It has been shown that beneficial effect of 17βE2 on cognition requires a basal forebrain cholinergic system [ ] so that 17βE2 expands cholinergic projections to the hippocampus and thus memory potentiation [ ]. 7. Cell survival. One of the other possible mechanisms of estrogen neuroprotection may be the changes in the neurotrophins level [ ]. Neurotrophins such as nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), factors affecting the survival of neurons, are involved in cognitive function [ ]. Moreover, there is growing evidence which indicates a part of estrogen neuroprotective action is done by interfering with IGF receptors [ ]. The synergistic effect of estrogen and IGF has been reported on neuronal survival in damaged brain [ ]. Modulating apoptotic and necrotic cell death cascades is another mechanism of the 17βE2 effect on neuronal survival, in addition to adjustment of the level of growth factors [ ]. The anti-apoptotic effects of estrogen have been shown in experimental TBI. Premarin administration caused the inhibition of apoptosis in hippocampal and cortical neurons after TBI, possibly through ERα [ ]. Estrogen also protects neurons in TBI through repelling the increase in intracellular calcium [ ]. 8. Angiogenesis. Estrogen increases VEGF, bFGF [ ], and platelet-activating factor (PAF) and its receptor, and also modulates the signaling mechanisms of gene expression induced by HIF-1α, all of which are involved in angiogenesis processes by estrogen [ ]. 9. And etc. Although neuroprotective mechanisms of estrogen in addition to the mentioned mechanisms, have been suggested in other studies, the expression of all of them is avoided in this review because of the prolongation of the text. Fig. 2 The neuroprotective mechanisms of progesterone. BBB blood brain barrier
Progestins
The majority of hormone therapies in women contain a progestin in addition to estrogen. Progestins have very useful known functions in the nervous system [ ]. Many researchers have shown the neuroprotective role of progestins in animal studies conducted in 22 different models of brain injury, and in the treatment of neurological disorders [ ]. Progesterone alters the expression of over 500 genes mainly involved in inflammation and apoptosis pathways after TBI by multiple actions [ ]. Although some clinical trials fail to show the beneficial effects of progesterone in brain injury, and some evidence even suggest that adding progesterone to estrogen may suppress useful effects of estrogen in the combined consumption [ ], evidence exists that some combined doses of estrogen and progesterone have beneficial effects [ ].
Neuroprotective effects of progesterone have been indicated in animal models of brain injury according to the multiple components of injury pathophysiology [ ], including: suppression of the metabolic cascade of damage and secondary inflammation [ ], recovery of neurological defects, cognitive function, movement and anxiety [ ], reducing the infarction size [ ], edema [ ] and neuronal degeneration [ ].
Although the pre-clinical and clinical results of progesterone in TBI are hopeful, comprehensive understanding of the action mechanisms of progesterone in TBI is needed [ ]. Neuroprotective effects of progesterone following TBI are mainly mediated by the following possible mechanisms (Fig. 3 ): 1. Brain edema. Many studies have shown that progesterone diminishes cerebral edema following TBI [ , ]. Attella et al. detected the augmentation in the size of brain ventricles in females with natural cycle compared to females with false pregnancy and sham controls following TBI [ ], then perused the effect of estrogen or progesterone pretreatment in ovariectomized females (OVX) of this type of injury and found that progesterone in false pregnancy is responsible for neuroprotection in this type of damage. Reduction of brain edema through the use of progesterone has been elucidated in rat TBI [ ]. The inverse association has been demonstrated between brain edema and serum progesterone level in TBI [ ]. Progesterone lowers ICP whereas elevates CPP in TBI possibly by deducing cerebral edema [ ]. Progesterone also restrains the astrocyte activity after brain injury [ ]. In a study by Khaksari, it was found that progesterone may apply a part of its anti-edema effect via increasing neuromedin S, and its receptor (NMS) led to oxidative stress diminution and BBB protection [ ]. In one study it was determined that abatement in cytotoxic and vasogenic edema after TBI by progesterone could be through classical and non-classical receptors (membrane, 25-DX) [ ]. AQP4 facilitates the development of early cytotoxic edema while arrests delayed vasogenic edema [ ]. It has also been suggested that the debilitation of brain edema formation by progesterone could be applied via the alterations in AQP4 expression [ ]. Another possible multiple mechanism of progesterone to reduce brain edema involves attenuating the BBB permeability (its index, expression of P-glycoprotein efflux pump, PGP) and improving the mitochondrial activity [ ]. 2. Apoptosis. Another possible mechanism proposed for progesterone neuroprotection in TBI is the intensification of neuronal survival. Increased survival of neurons may be mediated at least in part by the effects of progesterone on apoptosis. NFҡB is involved in inflammation and apoptosis after TBI and progesterone detracts NFҡB and thus prevents neuronal apoptosis. It has been reported that progesterone alleviates the loss of neurons in the medial dorsal nucleus (MDN) after contusion [ ] and also injury volume following FPI in females with natural cycle [ ]. In addition, weakening of the DNA fragmentation by progesterone has been illustrated in different models of TBI [ ]. Neuronal death was also attenuated by progesterone administration following DAI and unilateral parietal damage [ ]. Other mechanisms of progesterone to suppress apoptosis in TBI involve reducing the pre-apoptotic factors including caspase- 3 [ ], Bax [ ], Bad [ ], Akt [ ] and p53 [ ] after TBI, enhancing the anti-apoptotic factors including Bcl-2, ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinases) and Bcl-xl [ , ]. In addition, the increment of prosurvival factor, BDNF, and the decrement of prosurvival precursors, proBDNF and ProNGF have been determined following progesterone therapy in TBI [ ]. 3. Inflammation. Inflammation is a leading participant to the secondary injury and microglial activation and its control generates a beneficial effect in the injured area and beyond areas of injury and even other organs [ ]. Progesterone and its derivatives are powerful anti-inflammatory agents which inhibit the release of cytokines, and the migration and activity of immune cell [ ]. Progesterone attenuates the increased expression of molecules associated with inflammation including IL-1β [ , ], TNF-α [ , ], NF-ҡB [ ], IL-6 [ , ], COX-2 [ ], and ICAM-1 [ , ] post TBI. Progesterone also undermines the activity of complement system [ ] and enhances TGF-β level [ , ]. Progesterone usage alters the expression of genes involved in inflammation modulation including the complement system, chemokines and their receptors [ ]. Anti-inflammatory action of progesterone affects the improvement in neurological outcome [ ]. 4. Oxidative stress. Membrane lipid peroxidation is a principal cause of BBB disruption. Progesterone diminishes oxidative stress on TBI in addition to inflammation [ ]. Membrane lipid peroxidation is lessened by progesterone in TBI, possibly through extenuating the production of free radicals and also boosting the activity of antioxidant enzymes [ , ]. The level of 8- isoprostaglandin- F2, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, declines following progesterone administration in TBI [ ]. The antioxidant effect of progesterone can improve cell viability in the adjacent area of damage and BBB permeability [ , ]. 5. GABA activity. Gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) is an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain and progesterone inhibits neuronal activity mediated by GABA. Progesterone amplifies the inhibitory action of GABA and weakens the response to excitatory amino acid of glutamate against glutamate-caused excitotoxicity in brain injury [ ]. It seems that attenuating effect of allopregnanolone on neuronal activity in excitotoxicity-induced damage is more potent than progesterone [ ]. 6. Coagulation. Coagulation problems caused by TBI are another cause of secondary neuronal damage. Progesterone, a precoagulation factor, acts as a protective agent in TBI by increasing thrombin, fibrinogen, and coagulation factor XIII [ ]. Allopregnanolone acts as an anticoagulant agent via the enhancement in tissue plasminogen activator. Two different effects of progesterone and allopregnanolone on the coagulation cascade suggest progesterone remains a choice in TBI management in which blood loss can be harmful while allopregnanolone is a choice in ischemia treatment [ ]. 7. Systemic effects. TBI results in systemic inflammatory effects and oxidative injury causing damage in heart, kidneys, lungs, liver, and other tissues of the body [ ]. Systemic inflammation associated with TBI can lead to multi-organ failure and infection resulting in death [ ]. Progesterone reduces the expression of systemic inflammatory cytokines and thus systemic damage [ , ]. So, the use of a drug such as progesterone which operates in multiple locations may be useful in the treatment of TBI systemic complex processes. Fig. 3 The neuroprotective mechanisms of estrogen
In summary, the probable neuroprotective action mechanisms of sex steroids in TBI are exerted by targeting multiple paths of damage which include: the effect on cerebral blood flow [ ], leukocyte recruitment [ ], cerebral edema formation [ ], oxidative stress [ ], cytokines [ ], excitotoxicity [ ], apoptosis [ ], β-amyloid [ ], growth factors [ ] and neurotrophins expression [ ], neuronal calcium signaling [ ], ICP level [ ], Aqp4 expression [ ], mitochondrial dysfunction [ ], BBB permeability [ , ], astrocyte accumulation [ ], NF -KB signaling pathway [ ], Toll-like receptor signaling pathway [ ], amino acid response [ ], cell proliferation [ ], and axonal damage [ ].
For better understanding and transparency of the effects of estrogen and progesterone treatment in TBI, the results of estrogen and progesterone studies in TBI have been illustrated in Tables 1 and 2 . In these tables, the first dose of administered drugs is shown, which is important to generalize to clinical studies [ ]. Sex physiological differences in brain metabolism, for example, more blood flow of hemisphere in women than men and larger cerebral cortex size in women than men [ ] may be the reason of gender differences in risk, progression and improvement of numerous neurological diseases [ ]. Therefore, in these tables, we have also noted animal sex according to recent changes in guidelines of National Institutes of Funding Health (NIH) studies.

Neuroprotective Effects of Female Sex Steroids in Clinical TBI
Despite the detection of damage processes and the development of new pharmacological agents in experimental TBI, the results of TBI clinical trials have not been encouraging in many cases [ ]. Finding effective treatments for TBI is not easy and many clinical trials remain to be done [ ]. It seems, continuous research to identify and test new neuroprotective agents, develop a better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms and improve the design and analysis of clinical trials for TBI are needed [ ]. Neuroprotective effect of progesterone in TBI has been reported in five clinical trials [ , , , , ].
In the study of Wright et al. infusion of 12 mg/kg/day of progesterone for 3 days was performed in patients with moderate and severe TBI admitted in the first 11 h of the injury. A reduction of more than 50% mortality on severe TBI and an improvement in neurologic outcome on moderate TBI at 30 days after injury without any adverse effect were observed in progesterone group compared with the placebo group [ ]. In a study conducted by Xia et al. patients with severe TBI admitted in the first 8 h of the injury received 2 mg/kg/day intramuscular progesterone for 5 days. An amelioration in the neurologic outcome (FIM, GOS) and a diminution in mortality at three and 6 months after the injury were reported in progesterone group compared with placebo group [ ].
In two single-center randomized phase II clinical trials performed in Iran [ , ], survival and functional outcome in the 3 months after injury were reported in patients with severe TBI admitted at the first 8 h of the injury receiving 2 mg/kg/day oral medroxyprogesterone or intramuscular progesterone for 5 days. In our clinical study, a decline in mortality and a betterment in clinical outcome at three and especially 6 months after injury were observed in patients with moderate and severe TBI admitted in the first 4 h of the injury receiving 2 mg/kg/day intramuscular progesterone for 5 days [ ]. In addition, an abatement in lipid peroxidation and injury markers and a damping in inflammatory factors appeared following progesterone consumption in TBI patients [ , ].
However, results of two multi-center phase III clinical trials conducted following two phase II clinical trials were not satisfactory. In the Protect III study [ ], an increment in survival and an improvement in outcome at 6 months after injury were not appeared in patients with moderate and severe TBI who received infusion of 12 mg/kg/day progesterone for 4 days. In the SYNAPSE study [ ], people with severe TBI admitted at the first 8 h of the injury taking infusion of 12 mg/kg/day progesterone for 5 days did not indicate the alterations in survival and outcome at 3 and 6 months after the injury. This contradiction among clinical findings and also between clinical and experimental results for progesterone effect induces unreliability regarding its use as a neuroprotective factor among physicians and patients. But the side effects of progesterone administration were not reported in any of the two failed clinical studies.
A difference between pre-clinical and clinical studies with respect to ischemic stroke for neuroprotection evaluation induced by estrogen is the type of outcome investigated in which, in preclinical studies infarct volume and loss of neurons are mainly evaluated [ ]. It seems the appropriate design of pre-clinical studies is required to explore the neuroprotective effects of hormone therapy [ ]. Thus, the conditions before damage [ ], the lack of certain biomarkers, the different damage mechanisms in patients, and the assessment of non-sensitive outcomes in addition to the heterogeneity of injury in big clinical studies could impress the results of a study.
In a TBI clinical study in premenopausal women, outcome 1 month after injury was worse in women that were in the luteal phase of menstruation cycle in injury time (progesterone level is in the highest level) than women in the follicular phase (progesterone level in the lowest level) and those who received exogenous progesterone in injury time [ ].
The Lack of Neuroprotective Effects of Female Sexual Steroids in TBI
While the majority of pre-clinical studies support the therapeutic role of estrogen and progesterone in TBI, a small number do not support this [ , , ]. The difference in BBB action was not shown among males, females with natural cycle and females with false gestation 24 h after bilateral medial frontal cortex injury [ ]. Many clinical reports have not illustrated the importance of gender differences in outcome after TBI [ , ] and others have suggested worse outcome in female patients than male patients [ , ]. Although differences in gonadal sex hormones may play an important role in gender differences in TBI outcome, this role is inconclusive [ ].
The damage exacerbation in TBI following previous treatment with estradiol [ ], the lack of previous 17βE2 administration effect on the loss of neurons in the cortex and hippocampus and microglial activation after TBI [ ], and detrimental effect of estrogen consumption in ischemia-reperfusion have been reported. These studies emphasize that the mechanisms of this treatment strategy have not been fully understood and further investigation is needed.
The lack of memory improvement [ ] and IL-1β and TNF-α reduction in TBI [ ], and the macrophages or activated microglia accumulation along with proinflammatory effects in TBI have been shown following progesterone usage [ ].
Conclusions and Future Prospects
Although neuroprotective effect of female sexual hormones has been tremendously successful in TBI pre-clinical studies (Tables 1 and 2 ), it has not been promising in TBI clinical trials, especially phase III clinical studies, similar to other TBI clinical studies. It seems the following options suggested should be considered in a TBI clinical study after sufficient understanding of the secondary damage mechanisms and proper design of animal studies: (1) obtaining an optimum dose of drug, optimum duration of treatment, and proper form of drug usage for human; (2) exploring pre-clinical and clinical pharmacodynamics, absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of drug based on the severity of damage and the consumption of drug at the time of injury onset; (3) assessing the effect of solvent before executing a clinical study; (4) the classification of patients in an appropriate age range, and severity and location of the damage based on GCS and CT; (5) evaluating the primary efficacy of the treatment over time; (6) investigating the predictive and pharmacologic biomarkers (inflammation, damage and oxidative stress biochemical biomarkers and functional and molecular imaging biomarkers) to determine the effect of drug; (7) considering the population heterogeneity in TBI; (8) measuring the vitamin D level at the time of assessment, (9) efficacy studies of drug dose-duration-response according to age, gender, and hormonal status of females during pre-clinical and clinical evaluation; and (10) the heterogeneity of TBI. In this subject, the attention of journal readers is also attracted to reviews of stoke for more detail [ , ].
Although estrogens and progestins can exert potent neuroprotective benefit in TBI according to studies performed, further work is required to clarify the circumstances in which these effects will occur. Since most of the pre-clinical studies, unlike clinical studies, have illustrated the beneficial effect of estrogen and progesterone in TBI, it seems the therapeutic window, dosing of drug delivery, the assessment of appropriate objectives in drug therapy, attention to age and sex and the determination of responsive population based on the animal model should be considered in the design of clinical trials in future.
