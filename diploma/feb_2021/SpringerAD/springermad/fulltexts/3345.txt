Introduction
Cardiovascular medications were the fourth most common adult poisoning exposure and second most common cause of adult poisoning fatality in the USA in 2015 according to the American Association of Poison Control Centers’ National Poison Data System’s annual report. Calcium channel blockers are responsible for a substantial portion of the mortality associated with cardiovascular medication overdose cases [ ]. The calcium channel blocker class can be divided into dihydropyridines and non-dihydropyridines based on the primary site of action and expected physiologic effects. There are more than 10 different calcium channel-blocking agents prescribed in the USA for a variety of indications including hypertension, arrhythmias, angina, subarachnoid hemorrhage, migraines and Raynaud’s disease [ , ].
Amlodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, acts on the l -type calcium channels within the vascular smooth muscle and has little effect on cardiac tissue. Amlodipine is commonly used in clinical practice due to desirable properties, such as once daily dosing and minimal effects on heart rate. However, in the setting of acute overdose, these characteristics can become undesirable and lead to difficulty in successfully managing these patients. A delayed onset of action and prolonged half-life (ranging between 30 and 60 h) can cause elevated plasma concentrations that may persist for days [ ]. Amlodipine clearance at toxic levels is unpredictable due to alterations in pharmacokinetic principles and impaired drug delivery to the liver [ ]. Additionally, vascular selectivity is often lost in overdose leading to negative inotropic effects [ ].
This report describes a severe amlodipine overdose case that was refractory to multiple therapeutic approaches.
Case Report
A 53-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department of this hospital after ingesting eighty 10 mg tablets of amlodipine in a suicide attempt. Per emergency medical services, the patient was initially found to be hypotensive with systolic blood pressure (SBP) in the 80s and diaphoretic. He was given 400 mL of normal saline with a resulting increase in SBP to the 100s.
On arrival to the hospital, he was alert and oriented and confirmed that he did attempt to commit suicide. The patient’s physical examination was normal. His past medical history was significant for depression and hypertension, for which he was taking amlodipine, divalproex DR, risperidone and trazodone. The local poison center was consulted to assist in the management of this overdose case. Shortly after arriving, the patient’s blood pressure decreased to 81/41 mmHg. He was then given a 1 L bolus of normal saline, glucagon 1 g intravenously (IV) and 2 g of calcium gluconate IV. The patient’s vital signs and laboratory results throughout his hospitalization are depicted in Table 1 . The patient was administered a bolus of 220 units (2 units/kg) of regular insulin IV and then started on a continuous IV infusion at a rate of 220 units/h (2 units/kg/h). A central line and also a femoral arterial line were placed. He remained hypotensive during the insulin infusion, with blood pressures ranging from 81/41 to 57/40 mmHg, leading to the initiation of a norepinephrine continuous infusion.

Twenty minutes later, the patient’s mental status became altered and he was emergently intubated. Dopamine was added approximately 90 min later. Over the next 2 h, the patient remained hypotensive, and the norepinephrine infusion was increased to the institution’s maximum rate of 0.3 mcg/kg/min. During this timeframe, he also received two 20% lipid boluses of 150 and 250 mL, respectively. The patient remained hypotensive [SBP in the low 80s and mean arterial pressure (MAP) in the 50s] while on maximum rates of both norepinephrine and dopamine. At this point, both epinephrine and vasopressin were started.
Over the next 2 h, he received an additional 2 g of calcium chloride and 250 mL of 20% lipids. The patient’s SBP and MAP remained in the 80s and 50s, respectively. Phenylephrine was then started and was titrated to the institution’s maximum rate of 5 mcg/kg/min within 20 min. Due to the patient’s inadequate response to the vasopressor and inotropic agents, methylene blue was started in an attempt to achieve hemodynamic stability. He received a 100 mg dose of methylene blue that was repeated approximately one hour later. Following administration of methylene blue, the patient’s blood pressure improved for the first time since he presented to the hospital. The SBP increased to the low 90s and the MAP improved to the low 60s. Approximately 2 h after the second methylene blue dose, the beneficial effects of this agent began to wear off, and the patient’s SBP and MAP decreased to the low 80s and the 50s, respectively. The patient then received calcium chloride 2 g, and approximately 75 min later, he was given another 4 g of calcium gluconate. His SBP dropped again into the 70s prompting the administration of an additional 200 mg of methylene blue, which also produced a clinically significant improvement in his hemodynamics. A nephrology team was consulted, and plasma exchange was ordered in an attempt to reduce the patient’s serum amlodipine levels. He received approximately 2 h of plasma exchange therapy. The patient’s serum amlodipine level prior to plasma exchange was 120 ng/mL and the level post-plasma exchange was 63 ng/mL. Following completion of the plasma exchange, the patient was started on continuous renal replacement therapy to manage his acute renal failure in the setting of severe hypotension. Over the next 2 h, he received an additional 250 mL of 20% lipids and 2 g of calcium chloride. In total, the patient received 14 g of calcium.
Due to persistent hypotension, it was decided to place the patient on arterial–venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (A–V ECMO). As the patient was being transferred to the operating room table and prepped for the procedure, he became bradycardic and then asystolic. A Code Blue was called, chest compressions were performed, and standard code medications were administered per the advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) algorithm. During the code, the rhythm changed from asystole to pulseless electrical activity before full flow ECMO was able to be started. ECMO was initiated following return of spontaneous circulation, and the patient’s MAP was sufficient for the duration of his time on this therapy. Following ECMO placement, the patient’s pupils were fixed and dilated, and he did not respond to commands. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head showed anoxic brain injury. Neurology was consulted and confirmed that the patient suffered an anoxic brain injury during the code, and he was pronounced brain dead. This information was conveyed to his family, which led to their decision to withdraw all medical support, and the patient expired.
Discussion
This report adds to the growing body of the literature describing amlodipine overdose cases with varying patient outcomes. Calcium channels are located throughout the body in the cardiac myocytes, smooth muscles and β -islet cells of the pancreas. Calcium channel blockers inhibit the movement of calcium through each of these channels [ ]. Effects of this blockade in the vascular smooth muscle manifest as reductions in blood pressure, dilation of the coronary vasculature and decreased afterload. Impaired inotropy results from calcium channel blockage within the cardiac muscles, and decreased heart rate is seen due to blocked channels of the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes [ ]. Amlodipine is selective for the calcium channels in the periphery during normal physiological conditions. In the setting of an acute overdose, selectivity is lost and amlodipine also displays negative cardiac effects [ ]. Calcium channel blocker’s effects in the pancreas leads to hyperglycemia from impaired insulin release and insulin resistance. Low levels of insulin lead to reduced cardiac function because of impaired glucose uptake into the cardiac cells. Although there is no universal treatment algorithm, the treatment modalities employed in an amlodipine overdose are targeted to reverse these different mechanisms of toxicity [ , ].
Standard management of amlodipine toxicity includes calcium administration and hemodynamic support through the use of vasopressors and inotropes. Calcium is provided in supratherapeutic doses, as boluses or continuous infusions, in order to overcome the antagonism of the calcium channels [ ]. Studies have shown conflicting results regarding the efficacy of calcium administration [ ]. Because of the low risk of adverse effects, calcium therapy remains a first-line treatment strategy except in cases of concurrent cardiac glycoside overdose. Negative inotropic effects and vasodilation can be counteracted with agents that activate β 1 receptors in the myocardium and α 1 receptors in the periphery. Agents including epinephrine, norepinephrine, phenylephrine, dopamine, dobutamine and isoproterenol have all be used in amlodipine overdose cases [ ].
Glucagon is considered a primary treatment strategy in the management of beta-blocker overdoses, but it may also have utility in calcium channel blocker overdoses as well [ ]. Following administration of glucagon, levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) are increased within the cells causing activation of protein kinase C. This results in an enhanced influx of calcium across the cell membrane and improved cardiac contractility and smooth muscle contraction [ ]. Animal studies demonstrate beneficial effects on heart rate with glucagon administration, but no improvements in mean arterial pressure or overall survival [ ]. However, a case report was published describing resolution of hypotension following glucagon administration in a patient with a calcium channel blocker overdose [ ]. Because of this conflicting evidence, the benefits of this treatment strategy remain controversial in the treatment of calcium channel blocker toxicity [ ].
Although originally used in the treatment of toxicity from local anesthetics, lipid emulsions are now a commonly used treatment modality for calcium channel blocker overdoses. The beneficial effects of intralipid therapy are thought to be due to a dual mechanism of action. The toxic drug molecule becomes sequestered in the plasma following lipid administration due to a lipid sink effect. Because the drug is trapped in the plasma, it is unable to bind to its receptor, and therefore, undesirable consequences are prevented [ ]. Additionally, intralipids serve as a source of free fatty acids, which are used as a cardiac energy source. In a healthy patient, fatty acids are the typical energy source for the cardiac myocytes. Conversely, the myocytes utilize glucose as an energy source in states of severe stress. Because insulin secretion is impaired by the calcium channel blocker overdose, glucose is an inadequate energy source and fatty acids are required for appropriate cardiac function. Although less well validated than the other mechanisms, it is also thought that the intralipids may directly stimulate the calcium channels themselves [ ]. There have been multiple reports of successful use of intralipids in the management of amlodipine overdose both with and without concurrent hyperinsulinemic euglycemic therapy (HIET). In each case, the patient’s hemodynamic parameters improved soon after administration of the lipids [ ].
The benefits of HIET have been well established in the setting of cardiac dysfunction, and the use of HIET has gained popularity recently in the management of cardiac drug overdose cases [ ]. Insulin administration leads to positive inotropic effects, which is thought to be due to enhanced glucose transport into the cardiac muscle cells [ ]. As stated above, glucose is the preferred energy source for the myocardium during states of stress. Together, insulin and dextrose increase cardiac contractility. By stimulating calcium and potassium channels to renew cytosolic adenosine triphosphate, this combination therapy improves myocardial energy production. Insulin therapy may also be considered cardio-protective because of its anti-inflammatory properties [ ]. Multiple case reports are published in the literature describing both success and treatment failures with the use of HIET in calcium channel blocker overdoses. In these reports, insulin bolus doses vary between 0.1 and 10 units/kg followed by continuous infusions of 0.5–2 units/kg/h [ ]. Additionally, a prospective observational study was conducted to evaluate the use of HIET in seven patients with calcium channel blocker overdoses. The results demonstrated that HIET is a safe and efficacious treatment strategy particularly when used with other conventional treatments and when started early in the overdose course [ ].
The vasodilation caused by amlodipine, unlike with other calcium channel blockers, is potentiated by the production and release of nitric oxide. The effect is thought to be due to enhanced nitric oxide synthase activity and mediation of bradykinin receptors. Increased levels of nitric oxide lead to increased formation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). cGMP is responsible for reduced systemic vascular resistance and impaired response to vasoconstrictors. This impaired response may help to elucidate why vasopressors may be ineffective in the treatment of severe amlodipine overdoses, which was observed in this patient case. Methylene blue may be beneficial in the management of an amlodipine overdose because of its ability to scavenge nitric oxide, prevent nitric oxide production and impede guanylate cyclase activity [ ]. Two case reports describe successful use of methylene blue in an amlodipine and an amlodipine–atenolol overdose patient who were refractory to standard medical treatment. Methylene blue led to rapid increases in the patient’s blood pressure in both cases [ , ]. The patient described in this case report also experienced improvements in his blood pressure following each administration of methylene blue with these beneficial effects persisting for a few hours.
Hemodialysis is not useful for the removal of amlodipine because the molecule is highly protein bound; however, therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) is considered a viable treatment option [ ]. During TPE, the patient’s plasma is replaced by crystalloid or colloid products. This procedure effectively removes toxins that are highly protein bound from the blood, but not from other body compartments, which should lead to reduced plasma concentrations of the toxic substance [ ]. According to the American Association of Blood Banks and the American Society of Apheresis, TPE for acute drug overdose is a Category II recommendation and considered an appropriate adjunctive treatment option [ ]. TPE successfully decreased the plasma concentration of amlodipine from 150 to 40 ng/mL in an amlodipine overdose case reported by Ezuduegwu et al. [ ]. The patient improved hemodynamically after 2 TPE sessions and remained stable throughout the rest of her hospitalization [ ]. TPE has also been described as an effective treatment along with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in a patient with a mixed ingestion of multiple substances including amlodipine [ ]. Amlodipine levels in the patient described in this report were reduced by nearly 50% after completing approximately 2 h of treatment, which further supports the utility of TPE in the setting of an amlodipine overdose.
Finally, in patients who are refractory to all other standard medical treatments, ECMO has been used in amlodipine overdoses as a lifesaving measure. Case reports describe the use of veno-arterial ECMO in a combined amlodipine, lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide overdose and in a combined amlodipine and metoprolol overdose. The patients in both reports survived [ , ]. A retrospective cohort study evaluated extracorporeal life support in 17 patients admitted for prolonged cardiac arrest or refractory shock after a drug overdose who did not respond to conventional treatments. The overall survival rate in the study was 76%, which suggests extracorporeal life support is an efficient treatment modality when other conventional strategies have failed [ ]. However, prior to this case report, there has been no other literature describing the use of ECMO in an amlodipine overdose without any other concurrent ingestion. Our patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout his time receiving ECMO, but unfortunately coded just prior to the start of this intervention. Therefore, we hope that this report brings awareness to the potential benefit of early implementation ECMO in amlodipine overdose cases.
As is evident by the outcomes in the patient described in this case report, there are inherit limitations to the treatment strategies described previously and all patients may not respond sufficiently. It would be beneficial for future research in the area to attempt to elucidate novel mechanisms for reversing the toxicities associated with massive amlodipine ingestions. One possible novel mechanism may involve administering agents that are capable of reopening the l -type calcium channels or increasing calcium influx through these channels, which are inhibited following amlodipine administration. However, no clear evidence currently supports the use of any existing medication in this capacity.
The compound Bay K8644 is a calcium channel agonist that enhances the influx of calcium at voltage gated calcium channels. Animal studies suggest that this compound produces a significant increase in the opening potential of l -type calcium channels within the neurons and enhances the current of these channels within the cardiac membrane [ , ]. Data suggest that Bay K8644 may be able to reverse the effects of certain calcium channel blockers including nifedipine, verapamil and diltiazem [ ]. Unfortunately, this compound is utilized only for research purposes and is not currently available for clinical use. In addition, studies conducted in cortical neurons demonstrated an increase in intracellular calcium influx following administration of a vasopressin 1 A receptor agonist suggesting that an increase in intracellular calcium concentrations is dependent on vasopressin 1 A receptor activation [ ]. Additional studies conducted more recently and clinical evidence is needed before a clear association can be drawn supporting a potential benefit of these agents with l -type calcium channels in the setting of a calcium channel blocker overdose.
Conclusion
There is limited evidence in the existing literature describing the refractory treatment modalities utilized in this patient, such as plasmapheresis, methylene blue infusions and ECMO. We believe that our case report is unique as it describes the clinical course of a patient when a multitude of these unique treatments were combined. Although our patient did expire, his hemodynamic parameters did drastically improve following administration of many of the salvage treatment modalities that were used. We hope that this case helps to bring awareness to unique treatment options that exist and that other institutions would be able to use the information presented in this report to expedite the application of similar strategies to optimize the management of a patient presenting with a severe amlodipine overdose.
