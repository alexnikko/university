Introduction
Abnormalities in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) regulation have been implicated in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (Diniz and Teixeira ). In animal models, the amyloid-beta peptide (Aβ) reduced BDNF expression in rat hippocampus, leading to memory impairment (Christensen et al. ). By contrast, the infusion of BDNF in the entorhinal cortex was associated with a reduction in synapse loss, improvement in cell signaling and restoration of gene expression in aged primates (Nagahara et al. ). These effects were independent of local Aβ load and were beneficial to learning and memory, and the infusion of BDNF reversed neuronal atrophy and ameliorated age-related cognitive decline (Nagahara et al. ).
Early postmortem studies documented a lower BDNF expression in the hippocampus of AD patients (Phillips et al. ). More recently, precursor and mature forms of BDNF were lower in the brain of subjects with pathological diagnosis of AD compared to those without AD pathology (Peng et al. ). On the other hand, studies on CSF BDNF levels of patients with AD and other dementias report conflicting findings. While Blasko et al. ( ) did not find statistically significant differences in AD compared to controls, Laske et al. ( ) reported significantly lower BDNF concentrations in the CSF of AD patients as compared to controls and patients with non-AD dementia. In a study with healthy older adults, lower CSF BDNF levels were associated with poorer memory performance and faster cognitive decline (Li et al. ).
Few studies addressed BDNF regulation at predementia stages of AD. Subjects with amnestic MCI showed lower serum BDNF concentrations in comparison with healthy older subjects, which was correlated with worse cognitive performance (Yu et al. ; Shimada et al. ). In a study conducted by our group, we found decreased serum BDNF levels in patients with MCI and AD and demonstrated a role for the BDNF gene Val66Met polymorphism in predicting cognitive decline (Forlenza et al. ). More recently, Weinstein et al. ( ) showed that lower serum BDNF levels significantly predicted the progression from MCI to AD in a community-based cohort study. However, subsequent studies found increased BDNF in MCI and early AD, suggesting that higher serum BDNF in these subjects may be a compensatory event to the emerging AD pathology (Angelucci et al. ; Faria et al. ).
To date, no studies addressed CSF BDNF levels in patients with MCI and its association with progression to AD. Thus, the aim of the present study is to determine CSF BDNF in patients with amnestic MCI compared to age-matched controls and its potential role in predicting cognitive outcome, i.e., conversion from MCI to AD. We also determined the possible relationship between CSF BDNF and other well-established CSF biomarkers of AD (Aβ 42 , total Tau and phosphorylated Tau 181 ). We hypothesized that there is a gradual and significant decline in the CSF BDNF levels in the continuum from cognitively healthy, MCI and AD, that subjects with MCI who progress to AD would have lower CSF BDNF level compared to stable MCI and that CSF BDNF level is significantly correlated with AD-related CSF biomarkers (Aβ 42 , total Tau and phosphorylated Tau 181 ).
Methods
Sample and Assessment
Detailed information about recruitment, assessment and diagnostic procedures can be found elsewhere (Forlenza et al. ). In brief, all participants underwent a clinical evaluation including the Cambridge cognitive test (CAMCOG), the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) for global cognitive performance and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-21 items (HDRS-21) for depressive symptoms. Trained neuropsychologists administered neuropsychological examinations to all study participants. The neuropsychological battery included tests for episodic memory: the Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test (RBMT), the Fuld Object Memory Evaluation (FOME), the Brazilian version of the Short Cognitive Test (SKT), verbal fluency (category: fruit), Trail Making Test A (TMT A) and Trail Making Test B (TMT B). Evidence of functional decline was based on the scores of the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) and on all available evidence of difficulties to perform basic and instrumental activities of daily living, reported by a close relative or caregiver, and on the patient’s self-report. For the sake of conciseness, we will report data only on the clinical evaluation.
The total sample size included 128 older adults (77 with amnestic MCI, 26 with Alzheimer’s disease and 25 cognitively healthy controls) who were included in this study. The diagnosis of AD was established according to the NINDS–ADRDA criteria (McKhann et al. ) and of amnestic MCI according to the Mayo Clinic Criteria (Petersen et al. ). Patients with MCI were reassessed after 1–3 years (mean follow-up of 23.8 ± 9.8 months) and reclassified according to conversion status, i.e., conversion to AD (MCI-AD) or stable MCI (MCI-S).
The present study was approved by the local ethical committee and was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration. Informed consent was obtained from all participants to study procedures.
Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Collection and Biomarkers’ Analysis
CSF samples were obtained in the morning (no fasting required) by lumbar puncture in the L3/L4 or L4/L5 inter-vertebral space. A total volume of 12–15 ml of CSF was collected with a 23-gauge needle in polypropylene tubes and centrifuged at 3200 g for 10 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, samples were subdivided into 0.5-ml aliquots and immediately frozen at −80 °C.
Concentrations of BDNF were determined in duplicate by sandwich ELISA assay (DuoSet, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) according to the procedure supplied by the manufacturer and standardized in our laboratory. No significant cross-reactivity is observed with pro-BDNF. A standard curve was generated by reducing the data using a computer-generated four-parameter logistic (4-PL) curve fit. Measurements fell within the range of the standard curve with a correlation of r = 0.98. The detection limit for these assays was 10 pg/ml. Concentrations of total Tau (T-Tau), phosphorylated Tau 181 (P-Tau) and amyloid-beta 1–42 peptide (Aβ 42 ) were determined with the INNo-Bia AlzBio3 assay (Innogenetics, Ghent, Belgium), a multiplex microsphere-based Luminex xMAP platform that allows simultaneous analysis of these biomarkers.
Apolipoprotein E (APOE) Genotype
Genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood, and APOE genotyping was performed using the TaqMan ® 5′-exonuclease allelic discrimination assay obtained from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA, USA) with primers and probes sets from inventoried assays. This methodology uses two PCR assays to screen for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (rs429358, rs7412) within the exon 4 of APOE gene. Results from the individual assays were used to determine the APOE genotype for all participants.
Statistical Analysis
Prior to analyses, we evaluated the distribution of CSF biomarkers. BDNF, T-Tau and P-Tau did not show a normal distribution and were log-transformed prior to analyses. We carried out multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) to assess for baseline differences in CSF biomarkers and clinical data among diagnostic groups (AD, MCI and controls). Chi-square test was used to evaluate differences in the distribution of categorical variables (gender and APOE status) between groups.
We carried out additional MANOVA analyses to assess baseline differences in CSF biomarkers according to the MCI outcome in the follow-up (MCI-AD vs. MCI-S). Logistic regression analysis evaluated the best predictors of conversion to AD in the MCI subjects. In the logistic regression model, conversion status was the dependent variable and the CSF biomarkers (Aβ 42 , P-Tau, T-Tau and BDNF); and age, gender, APOE status, years of education, scores on the MMSE, CAMCOG and HDRS-21 were independent variables. We used a backward conditional method to estimate the best predictors of conversion from MCI to AD.
Results
Table 1 shows baseline clinical and CSF biomarker data for the diagnostic groups. Subjects with AD showed lower levels of CSF amyloid-β 42 and higher levels of P-Tau 181 and T-Tau compared to MCI and control subjects. Subjects with AD showed significantly lower CSF BDNF levels compared to MCI ( p = 0.001) and healthy control ( p = 0.03) subjects; there were no significant differences between MCI and healthy controls ( p = 0.4). After controlling for demographic, clinical variables, presence of the APOE*4 allele and CSF AD-related biomarkers, CSF BDNF levels remained significantly reduced in AD subjects compared to MCI and healthy controls ( F 2,127 = 5.00, p = 0.009). Pearson correlation analysis showed that CSF BDNF levels were significantly correlated with CSF T-Tau ( r = 0.172, p = 0.05), MMSE scores ( r = 0.185, p = 0.04), CAMCOG scores ( r = 0.266, p = 0.002), HDRS-21 scores ( r = −0.205, p = 0.02) and age ( r = −0.200, p = 0.02) in the whole sample. There were no significant correlations with CSF Aβ 42 ( r = −0.153, p = 0.08) or P-Tau levels ( r = −0.118, p = 0.18), as well as with other clinical and demographic variables, including educational level ( r = 0.05, p = 0.6). We split the sample according to the diagnosis and reran the Pearson correlation analysis. The results remained similar for most comparisons, although we found a significant correlation between CSF Aβ 42 and BDNF in the MCI group ( r = 0.231, p = 0.04).

Seventy-two (93 %) MCI subjects had follow-up assessments; 21 progressed to AD (MCI-AD), and 51 retained the diagnosis of MCI (MCI-S). Table 2 shows the CSF biomarkers according to MCI outcome. CSF BDNF levels were reduced in MCI-AD subjects, but this difference was marginally significant ( p = 0.06). CSF Aβ 42 was significantly reduced in MCI-AD subjects, while CSF P-Tau was significantly increased in these subjects. After controlling for demographics, clinical variables, presence of the APOE*4 allele and CSF AD-related biomarkers, CSF BDNF levels were significantly reduced in MCI-AD compared to MCI-S subjects ( F 1,71 = 4.13, p = 0.04).

Logistic regression models showed that the best predictors of progression from MCI to AD were lower CSF BDNF levels ( B = −2.18 ± 0.82, Wald = 7.04, p = 0.008), lower CSF AβA 42 ( B = −0.12 ± 0.004, Wald = 7.84, p = 0.005), lower MMSE scores ( B = −0.54 ± 0.20, Wald = 7.16, p = 0.007) and gender ( B = 1.91 ± 0.89, Wald = 4.52, p = 0.03). We further assessed the classification accuracy of CSF biomarker panels to identify MCI-AD subjects. When only AD-related biomarkers (Aβ 42 , T-Tau and P-Tau) were included, the logistic regression model predicted progression to AD or stability of MCI diagnosis with 70 % of accuracy. Including CSF BDNF, the logistic regression model accuracy increased to 77 %.
Discussion
Our results suggest that decreased CSF BDNF concentration is significantly associated with progression to AD in amnestic MCI subjects, and confirm previous studies that found reduced concentrations of BDNF in the CSF of AD patients. We further demonstrated that CSF BDNF concentrations showed a significant negative correlation with cognitive performance, depressive symptoms, age and CSF total Tau levels, and a positive correlation with CSF amyloid-β 42 levels. Our results are in line with previous reports in the literature that found decreased levels of CSF BDNF in subjects with MCI and patients with AD (Laske et al. ; Li et al. ). Nonetheless, our sample size of AD and amnestic MCI subjects is larger than in the previous studies, and we provide data on the progression to AD in the MCI group on follow-up. Overall, our results provide strong evidence that reduced neurotrophic support is an important driver of neurodegeneration and may play a role to increase vulnerability to cognitive decline and progression to in older adults.
We found a negative correlation between age and CSF concentrations of BDNF, which is in line with previous evidence, suggesting that BDNF decreases in the brain during aging (Li et al. ). In a recent study, we found a significant age-related decrease in BDNF plasma levels over 2 years of follow-up in older adults (Diniz et al. ). In a postmortem study, Douillard-Guilloux et al. ( ) found that the expression of BDNF mRNA in the brain negatively correlated with age, and such reduction may be an important factor associated with late-life neuropsychiatric disorders. BDNF plays an important role in maintenance of neuronal homeostasis, including synaptic function and plasticity, resilience against local and systemic injuries, and restorative functions (Diniz and Teixeira ). These effects are mainly mediated through the binding of BDNF with the high-affinity tyrosine kinase receptor B (TrkB) that activates several intracellular signaling cascades, including Ras/MAPK, PI3 K/Akt and phospholipase C. In a lesser extent, BDNF can also interact with p75 neurotrophin receptor, activating a different set of signaling cascades, such as c-Jun N-terminal kinase-p53-Bax, that may determine neuronal apoptosis (Teixeira et al. ). The negative correlation between Tau and BDNF in the whole sample, and with amyloid-β 42 in the MCI group, may reflect a physiologic response to emerging neurodegeneration in older adults. Therefore, the reduction in BDNF in the brain during aging may render subjects more vulnerable to the emergence of neurodegenerative changes observed in the continuum from MCI to AD (Sibille ). Our finding that lower BDNF is associated with higher risk of progression to AD in MCI subjects reinforces this hypothesis.
BDNF levels were higher in the MCI group, in particular in the MCI-S group ( p = 0.001), compared to healthy subjects. This result goes in the opposite direction of what would be expected, i.e., a linear decline in BDNF level in the continuum between normal aging, MCI and Alzheimer’s disease (Peng et al. ). On the other hand, the increased levels of CSF BDNF in MCI-S compared to the other groups may reflect a compensatory mechanism against emerging neurodegenerative changes in MCI subjects. These compensatory changes have been observed in other studies with MCI subjects and early AD participants. In an earlier study, Laske et al. ( ) found a significantly higher serum BDNF level in early-stage AD compared to controls and late-stage AD participants. Functional neuroimaging studies found greater activation in the hippocampus and other brain areas in MCI subjects compared to controls (Miller et al. ; Clément and Belleville ). Greater hippocampal activation correlated with increased brain β-amyloid deposition in PiB-PET scans (Huijbers et al. ) and greater rate of cognitive decline (Huijbers et al. ; Miller et al. ).
Drugs with potential disease-modifying properties for AD can modulate neurotrophic systems. Long-term lithium treatment for patients with amnestic MCI has been shown to attenuate cognitive decline and Tau phosphorylation (Forlenza et al. ). Lithium administration can also increase BDNF levels and exert additional neuroprotective effects in patients at risk of AD (de Sousa et al. ). Cerebrolysin, a peptide mixture with neurotrophic properties, was also shown to improve cognitive deficits and amyloid burden in animal models of AD (Rockenstein et al. ). In a clinical trial, cerebrolysin improved cognitive function in patients with mild-to-moderate AD (Alvarez et al. ). Neurotrophic peptides and NGF delivery systems are considered promising mechanisms in drug development (Covaceuszach et al. ). Therefore, neurotrophic systems can be a target for disease-modifying interventions if implemented early enough in the course of AD, preferentially at predementia stages (i.e., MCI) or even prior to the onset of cognitive symptoms (preclinical AD).
Significant abnormalities in the BDNF system can also be found in other neuropsychiatric disorders (Teixeira et al. ). Young and older adults with major depression have significantly lower BDNF levels in plasma and the CSF (Brunoni et al. ; Diniz et al. ). In a recent study, we reported that CSF BDNF was significantly reduced in older adults with depression (Diniz et al. ). Such reduction was greater in those subjects with depression and MCI and was independent of the AD-related neurodegenerative changes. Moreover, subjects with depression and MCI showed a significant decline of BDNF levels over 2 years of follow-up (Diniz et al. ). These findings may suggest that the reduction in BDNF level may be a final common pathway for different physiopathologic changes that render the brain more vulnerable to cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration (Sibille ; Diniz et al. ). Therefore, decreased CSF BDNF is not specific to AD, thus precluding its potential as biomarker of AD.
The present results must be viewed with caution. Some subjects had very high CSF BDNF levels. This might be due to small contamination with blood during lumbar puncture procedure. However, we did a routine laboratory analysis in all CSF samples to exclude blood contamination and other potential artifacts for measuring AD-related biomarkers. The subjects included in this study were recruited in a clinical outpatient service, and the present results may not be generalized to the whole population. Also, the present study has a relatively small sample size, in particular of MCI subjects who progressed to AD upon follow-up what may limit the power to detect more significant findings. We did not evaluate the impact of polymorphisms in the BDNF gene and its relation with the progression to AD. Finally, this study lacks the inclusion of an independent sample to validate the results. Therefore, it is necessary to replicate the present findings in independent larger samples, preferentially from community-based sources.
In conclusion, the present study adds strong evidence of the involvement of BDNF in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative changes in AD and the progression from prodromal to the dementia stage of AD. Interventions aiming to restore central neurotrophic support and maintain physiologic balance of the neurotrophic system may represent future therapeutic targets to prevent or delay the progression from MCI to AD.
