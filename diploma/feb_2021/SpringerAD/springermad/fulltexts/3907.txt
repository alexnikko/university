Introduction
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a rare, debilitating and potentially life-threatening auto-immune disease that has an approximate prevalence of 20–150 cases per 100,000 people. SLE has manifestations in diverse body organs including but not limited to blood vessels, skin and kidney. The extent of organ injury is dependent on varying factors such as genetic, environmental, and immunoregulatory factors [ , , , , ]. To date, only one SLE treatment [ ], with moderate efficacy [ ], has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and, therefore, it is a disease of high unmet medical need.
Type I Interferon (IFN) is proposed to play a key role in SLE pathogenesis and therefore a number of therapeutic strategies are targeting the IFN pathway. Type I IFNs are primarily produced by pDCs. PDCs are generated in the bone marrow and are found in peripheral blood and secondary lymphoid organs. pDCs secrete large amounts of type I IFNs, in response to viruses that engage toll-like receptors (TLRs) 7 and 9, and are one of the primary sources of IFN in viral infections. As such, targeting pDCS and dampening pDC-derived IFN may be an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of SLE [ , , , ].
BIIB059 constitutes a new, potentially first-in-class, therapy that is currently under development for the treatment of SLE including Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus (CLE). It is a humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) mAb that specifically binds to BDCA2, a receptor expressed exclusively on the surface of non-human primates and human pDCs [ ]. BDCA2 receptor engagement on pDCs was shown to diminish TLR7- and TLR9-induced production of IFNα, and pDC-derived cytokines as well as chemokines [ , , , ]. In nonclinical studies, BIIB059 was demonstrated to significantly inhibit all TLR9-induced type I IFNs, as well as other pDC-derived cytokines and chemokines. BIIB059 ligation leads to rapid internalization of BDCA2 from pDCs surface and subsequent inhibition of type I IFN [ ]. Therefore, the BDCA2 internalization is a measure of the BIIB059 pharmacodynamic response.
It is well accepted that the PK behavior of large molecules in general and mAbs in particular is traditionally more complex than the PK of small molecules. A major feature that differentiates the two is the target mediated drug disposition (TMDD) which gives rise to non-linear dynamics under a specific range of mAb concentrations. Although TMDD has been rarely observed in small molecules, it is a recurrent theme in the PK of mAbs and is mainly caused by the different mAb clearance mechanisms. Therefore, understanding the complexity underlying the PK behavior of mAbs in pre-clinical species and in humans necessitates the development of quantitative PK/PD models [ ].
Mager and Jusko [ ] built the first PK/PD model to describe the TMDD behavior of mAbs. Since then, several PK modeling approaches have been developed that capture the dynamics of mAbs. These approaches are of varying complexity and include simple two compartment PK models, minimal Physiology Based PK (PBPK) models, as well as full PBPK models that account for drug distribution in the majority of body organs [ , , , , ]. These PK models are sometimes linked with PD models of different types and are informed using data from several species, although there is no concrete method for translating the PD models across different species.
Several quantitative models that describe the PK/PD of SLE treatments have been previously developed [ , , , ]. Herein, a NHP PK/PD model for BIIB059 was developed, and a sensitivity-analysis-driven PK/PD scaling approach was established, to predict clinical PK/PD profiles in humans for different dose levels.
Methods
The concentrations of BIIB059 from 17 healthy cynomolgus monkeys with an average weight of 5.4 kg were used in this analysis. BIIB059 was administered either subcutaneously (doses of 0.2 and 7.5 mg/kg) or via intravenous infusion (doses of 1, 5 and 10 mg/kg). The dosing regimen consisted of either a single dose (0.2, 1, 7.5, 10 mg/kg) or three consecutive doses (5 mg/kg) at 0, 360 and 696 h. As mentioned above, BIIB059 ligation leads to rapid internalization of BDCA2 from pDCs surface [ ] and, therefore, the intensity of free BDCA2 is a measure of the BIIB059 pharmacodynamic response. The fluorescence intensity of free BDCA2 receptors on the surface of pDCs from 6 cynomolgus monkeys was, therefore, utilized for PD model development. Details of the study design and the data used for PK/PD model development are provided in Table 1 . The analytical methodology implemented in this study has been detailed previously [ ].

NHP PK/PD model development and evaluation
The population parameters of the NHP PK/PD model were estimated in a step-wise approach using NONMEM ® 7.3 [ ]. As a first step of the analysis, only the PK parameters of the model were estimated. Different PK model structures were tested in order to identify the most appropriate model to describe the available data. One-, two- and three-compartment PK models were tested with either linear or non-linear (Michaelis–Menten) elimination or both, linear and non-linear elimination, in combination. In addition, the TMDD modeling approach [ ] was evaluated as a part of the model development. The developed PK model that best described the available NHP data was a two-compartment model with linear elimination: $$\frac{dC}{dt} = - K_{a} \cdot C, \;with \,C(0) = Dose/V_{1}$$ (1) $$\frac{{dC_{1} }}{dt} = K_{a} \cdot C - \frac{Q}{{V_{1} }} \cdot C_{1} + \frac{Q}{{V_{2} }} \cdot C_{2} - \frac{CL}{{V_{1} }} \cdot C_{1},\;with \,C_{1} (0) = 0$$ (2) $$\frac{{dC_{2} }}{dt} = \frac{Q}{{V_{1} }} \cdot C_{1} - \frac{Q}{{V_{2} }} \cdot C_{2},\; with \,C_{2} (0) = 0$$ (3) where C is the drug concentration in the dosing compartment, C 1 is the drug concentration in the central compartment and C 2 is the drug concentration in the peripheral compartment. K a is the absorption rate constant, CL is the clearance, Q is the inter-compartmental clearance, V 1 is the volume of the central compartment and V 2 is the volume of the peripheral compartment.
Once the PK model building was completed, implementation of the PK/PD link was carried out by testing different PD model structures, such as direct and indirect response PD models [ ]. A Hill coefficient was added to the PD equation as it was found to improve model fitting. The PD model structure that best described the data was found to be an indirect response model with stimulation of the dissipation of the response: $$\frac{dR}{dt} \equiv k_{in} - \frac{{k_{in} }}{{E_{0} }} \cdot \left( {1 + \frac{{E_{\hbox{max} } \cdot C_{p}^{\gamma } }}{{EC_{50}^{\gamma } + C_{p}^{\gamma } }}} \right) \cdot R,\;{\text{with\;R}}(0) = 1580{\text{ MFI}}$$ (4) where R is the response, k in is the zero-order constant for production of drug response, E o is the baseline effect prior to drug administration, E max is the maximum fractional factor of stimulation, EC 50 is the drug concentration required to achieve 50% of the total stimulation, Cp is the concentration of drug in the central compartment and γ is the Hill coefficient. The initial condition for R, R(0), was estimated based on the available data.
Additive as well as exponential inter-individual variability (IIV) was tested on each parameter, first in the PK and then in the PD model, to explore whether it improves model fitting and could explain some of the variability seen in the observed data. This was performed by implementing the forward inclusion method followed by the backward elimination method. Statistical criteria (a 3.84 difference in objective function value) as well as visual criteria using goodness-of-fit plots were considered to evaluate whether or not the addition of a single parameter to the model results in model improvement throughout the entire PK/PD model development. In addition to IIV, additive, proportional and combined residual error was tested for both the PK as well as the PD model.
Internal model evaluation of the final PK/PD model was performed using Visual Predictive Checks (VPC) generated using MatVPC [ ]. The VPCs included the median, 5th and 95th percentile intervals of 500 simulations. The simulations were overlaid with the individual observed data. The uncertainty of the final PK/PD parameter estimates and model robustness was assessed using non-parametric bootstrap in PsN (Perl-speaks-NONMEM) [ ]. For this, 500 subjects were randomly sampled and the model parameters were re-estimated using the sampled datasets. The median, 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles were calculated for each parameter from the successfully converged runs and compared to the values of the population parameter estimates of the original dataset. The bootstrap analysis demonstrated adequate model robustness, as the original estimates for both the PK and the PD model fall within the 95% confidence intervals, and close to the median, of the bootstrap estimates.
Scaling of NHP pharmacokinetic model to humans
Upon completion of the PK/PD model development, scaling of the PK/PD NHP model to adult humans was performed. For the PK model, body-weight allometric scaling was used implementing the traditional approach that is based on the rule of exponents. The exponent used for the volumes, V , was 1: $$V_{human} = V_{monkey} \cdot \left( {\frac{70}{5.4}} \right)^{1}$$ (5) where 70 kg is the average human weight and 5.4 kg the average weight of the available cynomolgus monkeys. The exponent used for the total body CL and intercompartmental clearance ( Q ) was 0.85: $$CL_{human} = CL_{monkey} \cdot \left( {\frac{70}{5.4}} \right)^{0.85}$$ (6) $$Q_{human} = Q_{monkey} \cdot \left( {\frac{70}{5.4}} \right)^{0.85}$$ (7)
The exponent values 0.85 and 1 were selected based on a previous study whereby scaling of 13 therapeutic mAbs with linear elimination was performed [ ].
In contrast to scaling of PK models, no established approach for scaling PD models of mAbs has been defined yet. Therefore, a multifaceted approach that implements global sensitivity analysis was introduced to identify model parameters that would have the highest influence on the output of the model; only these parameters would then be considered in the scaling method. Here, the recovery time (time to transition from minimum to baseline levels) of BDCA2 was considered as the output of the model, as this particular characteristic was of interest during the development of BIIB059.
Unlike local sensitivity analysis which only assesses the contribution of a single parameter to the model output, global sensitivity analysis offers an enhanced analysis, as it explores the contribution of different combinations of parameters to the output of the model. To date, several global sensitivity analysis methods have been described; for the present study, the Sobol sensitivity analysis was implemented as follows [ ]: A total of 250,000 parameter sets were generated wherein all 4 PD parameters ( E 0 , E max , EC 50 , k in ) were perturbed up to ± 40% from their estimated values (shown in Table 2 ). Simulations of the PK/PD model were performed in MATLAB ® using the generated parameter sets (assuming an IV bolus dose of 0.1 mg/kg) and the sensitivity indices were calculated based on the outcome of the simulations.

To scale the NHP PD model, the most influential parameter identified by the Sobol analysis was multiplied by a scaling factor equal to 16 (2·8) to account for the following differences between cynomolgus monkeys and humans: 1) number of pDCs, which is approximately 2-fold higher in humans compared to cynomolgus monkeys, and 2) BDCA2 density on the surface of each single pDC, which is about 8-fold higher in humans compared to cynomolgus monkeys. Based on this, EC 50 was multiplied by a scaling factor equal to 16: $${\text{EC}}_{{ 50,{\text{human}}}} = 1 6\cdot{\text{EC}}_{{ 50,{\text{monkey}}}}$$ (8)
The dependence of EC 50 on the receptor number has been previously demonstrated by Krippendorff et al. [ ].
The values of all the other PD parameters were assumed to be the same across cynomolgus monkeys and humans and, therefore, not scaled.
Evaluation of scaled NHP PK/PD model against clinical data
The scaled NHP PK/PD model was used to simulate (n = 200) the BIIB059 dose–response relationship in humans under the following single ascending BIIB059 IV doses: 0.05, 0.3, 1, 3, 10 and 20 mg/kg; these doses were administered to healthy volunteers in the Phase I study of BIIB059. During the scaling and simulation process, the analysts at the University of Florida were blinded to the clinical Phase I study data. The simulation results were processed and the median with the 90% percentile intervals were plotted using R 3.2.4. After the simulations were carried out, comparison was performed between the observations from the Phase I clinical study of BIIB059 and the predictions made by the scaled NHP PK/PD model. To this end, the predictability of the scaled model for PK and PD data was evaluated.
Results
NHP PK/PD model development and evaluation
Data from 17 cynomolgus monkeys were used to develop a quantitative NHP model that describes the PK/PD of a novel mAb for the treatment of SLE and CLE. The developed NHP PK/PD model was further used to predict a FIH dose using allometric PK/PD scaling.
The developed PK model best described the available NHP data using a two-compartment model with linear elimination. The description and the value of each model parameter are listed in Table 2 . Despite the usual TMDD behavior observed with mAbs, in this work non-linear dynamics were observed only in one cynomolgous monkey (Fig. 1 , green color). This non-linearity may be attributed to anti-drug antibody response exhibited by this monkey. In this single case, the elimination phase of the drug could not be described adequately well with the developed model, as the structure of the PK model featured only linear elimination (adding non-linear elimination did not improve the fitting significantly). Overall, the PK model captured the observations well (Fig. 1 , top row). Addition of exponential IIV on parameters V 1 , V 2 , CL and K a resulted in a statistically significant improvement in the objective function value determined by a difference of 3.84 units per additional model parameter. A combined, additive plus proportional, model best described the residual unexplained variability of the PK. Fig. 1 Individual fits of the PK (top row) and the PD (bottom row) model. The lines correspond to model predictions whereas the circles correspond to observations from cyno-monkeys. Different colors denote different IDs. The dose amount is shown on the top of each plot. MFI is the Mean Fluorescence Intensity (Color figure online)
Following the completion of the PK model development, the parameters of the PD model were estimated. As a first step in the estimation of the PD parameter values, the PK parameters were fixed to their estimated values. As a subsequent step, after the PD parameters were estimated, all the model parameter values were estimated simultaneously; the results presented here are from the latter step of the estimation. The PD model structure that best described the data was found to be an indirect response model with stimulation of the dissipation of the response.
The estimates of the PD model are shown in Table 2 . As shown in Table 2 , the E max of the model was estimated to be 55.6 whereas the EC 50 was estimated equal to 0.3 μg/mL. Addition of proportional/exponential IIV on parameters E 0 , E max and EC 50 resulted in a statistically significant improvement of the objective function value. A combined, additive plus proportional, model best described the residual unexplained variability of the PD. The PD model fitting from this process is presented in Fig. 1 (bottom panel) showing the individual BDCA2 predictions compared to the observed BDCA2 concentrations over time.
As Fig. 1 (bottom panel) shows, the PD model predicts the observations well. It is important to highlight that in all subjects the BDCA2 receptors reappeared as soon as the drug was eliminated. Capturing this reappearance adequately necessitated the incorporation of a Hill coefficient in the model. Another interesting observation was the high variability observed for low BDCA2 levels, which could not be captured well with the presented PK/PD model.
Once the final PK/PD model was developed, it was subsequently evaluated using VPCs (n = 500 simulations) generated by MatVPC [ ], a recently developed computational tool that offers simulation and evaluation of quantitative pharmacology models of any complexity level. The VPC plots of the developed PK/PD model are shown in Fig. 2 and indicate that the developed model describes the trend of the observations adequately well, for both the PK as well as for the PD data. In addition, the 5th, median and 95th percentile intervals of the simulations mostly fall into the 90% percentile intervals of the observations. Finally, the bootstrap analysis shown in Table 2 demonstrated adequate model robustness. Fig. 2 VPC plots of the PK (top 2 rows) and the PD model (bottow row).

Scaling of NHP pharmacokinetic model to humans
NHP PK/PD models are used in enhancing our understanding of drug behavior as well as in making predictions of the drug dynamics in adult humans, i.e. the targeted population. For the latter, scaling of the NHP is required to ensure the differences between the species are accounted for in the human model. The developed NHP PK/PD model was scaled to humans to examine whether it could predict the clinical data from the Phase I clinical trial. PK scaling was performed using the traditional body-weight allometric scaling approach using the rule of exponents.
Unlike the extensively utilized allometric scaling approaches for PK of mAbs [ , , , , ], there is no established method in the literature for scaling mAb PD from NHP to humans, despite the various scaling methods that have been implemented to date [ , , ]. Sobol analysis, a global sensitivity analysis approach, was used here as an approach to identify the PD parameters to be scaled [ ]. Figure 3 shows the total sensitivity index for each PD parameter as calculated using the Sobol sensitivity analysis. Fig. 3 Global sensitivity analysis indices of the PD model parameters. Error bars (in red) correspond to 95% confidence intervals from bootstrap (Color figure online)
Global sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the time which is needed for BDCA2 levels to transition from minimal to 100% compared to their baseline is predominantly determined by EC 50 . To this end, EC 50 was multiplied by a scaling factor equal to 16. Based on internal experimental evidence, the affinity of BIIB059 for BDCA2 was considered to be the same in cynomolgus monkeys and humans. The remaining PD parameters of the model were not scaled given the results from sensitivity analysis which demonstrate that changes in these PD parameters do not impact the output of interest significantly (Fig. 3 ).
Evaluation of scaled NHP PK/PD model against clinical data
Simulating different clinical scenarios using scaled PK/PD models has been a key contribution of pre-clinical quantitative pharmacology modeling. Here, simulations of dose–response curves were performed using the scaled NHP PK/PD model. In these simulations, the following ascending IV doses were considered: 0.05, 0.3, 1, 3, 10 and 20 mg/kg and the median predicted BIIB059 concentrations and BDCA2 levels with their respective 90% prediction intervals were overlaid on the observations from the Phase I study (Figs. 4 and 5 ). Although different methods exist to predict PK/PD dynamics in humans based on purely pre-clinical data, quantitative modeling allows for thoroughly interrogating the exposure/response relationship of a drug, thereby aiding the determination of a safe dose that leads to the Minimum Anticipated Biological Effect Level (MABEL). Fig. 4 Validation of the scaled PK model. The green line corresponds to the median simulated BIIB059 and the green shaded area corresponds to the 90% percentile intervals of the simulations (n = 200). The red circles show the observations from the Phase I study and the red line show the median of the observations. The analysts were blinded to the clinical data during the development and scaling of the PK model (Color figure online) Fig. 5 Validation of the scaled PD model. The green line corresponds to the median simulated BDCA2 and the green shaded area corresponds to the 90% percentile intervals of the simulations (n = 200). The red circles show the observations from the Phase I study and the red line show the median of the observations. The analysts were blinded to the clinical data during the development and scaling of the PD model (Color figure online)
As shown in Fig. 4 , simulations of the scaled PK model captured the clinical observations well. Although the non-linearity in the PK of some subjects in Phase I study could not be predicted by the scaled NHP model, as the pre-clinical PK model was linear, overall the simulations satisfactorily described the clinical data.
The PD observations from Phase I were described by the scaled PD data satisfactorily (Fig. 5 ), although the agreement between simulations and clinical data was not as good as in the case of the PK data. Of note, the trend in the PD observations was captured by the simulations for most of the doses, and many of the observations fell within the confidence intervals of the simulations. As observed in Fig. 5 , the variability in the PD observations was particularly high, and in many cases could not be predicted due to the nature of the PD model used (e.g. model does not allow for values > 100% of baseline). Given that the sensitivity analysis approach was based on the BDCA2 recovery time (time to transition from minimum to baseline levels), this recovery time was compared between the simulations and the clinical observations. In the case of 0.05 mg/kg, the BDCA2 recovery time was 0.8 ± 1.2 weeks for the simulations and 7.8 ± 5.6 weeks for the observations. In the case of 0.3 mg/kg, the BDCA2 recovery time was 4.4 ± 3.2 weeks for the simulations and 9.8 ± 8 weeks for the observations. Regarding the other doses, a comparison between simulations and observations is not possible, as the observed BDCA2 levels were not fully recovered within the timeframe of this study.
Discussion
For FIH clinical studies in healthy volunteers, predicting the behavior of a drug in general and determining its MABEL dose in particular is of paramount importance; a too high starting dose could trigger serious adverse events whereas a too low starting dose could require additional dose evaluations to determine a therapeutic dose [ , , ]. Therefore, exploiting preclinical data of mAbs to support the selection of a safe FIH dose has been attracting increasing interest. Selecting a safe FIH dose of mAbs has been particularly challenging due to unique features underlying mAbs. Even for cross-reactive mAbs, the underlying differences in the pharmacology between test species and humans may result in an unrelated No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) between these species [ ].
PK/PD modeling for large molecules or mAb has gradually become a useful tool in supporting the design and dose selection of FIH clinical studies [ , , ]. Several approaches have been implemented for scaling preclinical PK models to predict clinical data, aiming to guide the selection of a safe FIH dose. These models include both Michaelis–Menten approaches [ ] as well as TMDD approaches [ , , ]. The implemented scaling approaches in these studies have described mAbs whose target is either a soluble ligand or is found on the cell surface. Despite the significant contribution of these scaling approaches, no established method exists for simultaneous scaling of the PK/PD relationship of mAb models as a means to support the design of FIH clinical studies based in NHP information. In addition, no previously published work has proposed the use of sensitivity analysis to identify, and consequently scale, the parameters that govern model behavior.
In the present work, data from healthy NHP subjects were utilized aiming to build a NHP PK/PD model for BIIB059, scale the NHP model to humans, and examine whether the scaled model could be utilized (i) to identify the MABEL dose and (ii) to predict the exposure–response relationship in humans. In NHP, treatment with BIIB059 led to rapid and complete down-modulation of BDCA2 on the surface of pDCs at all dose levels. Time to reappearance of BDCA2 on pDC cell surface correlated with circulating levels of BIIB059, establishing an in vivo PK/PD relationship. Despite the low availability of the NHP data, this in vivo PK/PD relationship was captured well with the NHP model. Of note, the confidence intervals of the simulations of the PD parameters were relatively large compared to their counterparts of the PK model. These large confidence intervals stem mostly from the high variability (96.5%) in the estimated EC 50 parameter value. High EC 50 variability, however, was important for capturing the noise in the limited available PD data.
Subsequently, the NHP PK model was scaled using the traditional body-weight based allometric scaling approach. To scale the NHP PD model, however, first global sensitivity analysis, i.e. Sobol [ ], was conducted in order to identify the PD parameters that mostly impact the time to BDCA2 reappearance on pDC cell surface after BIIB059 treatment. This analysis demonstrated that this BDCA2 reappearance time is mostly governed by EC 50 . Next, based on the information from the sensitivity analysis, the parameter EC 50 was scaled in the PD model. The value of the scaling factor for EC 50 was not arbitrarily selected but was instead based on solid physiological evidence, i.e. the experimentally measured amount of target in the test species (cynomolgus monkeys) and humans.
This study was carried out to explore whether the presented scaling approach could be exploited in future studies for prospectively determining a safe MABEL dose and predicting a drug’s PK/PD relationship in humans. To do so, the predictability of a safe MABEL dose was tested as follows: A minimum biological activity with a median of ~ 5% and a mean of ~ 20% decrease in BDCA2 density was pre-specified. Subsequently, PK/PD simulations (n = 200) under different doses were performed (data not shown) to identify which dose would yield the aforementioned minimum biological activity. Based on the simulations, a dose of 0.05 mg/kg was found to have a minimum pharmacological effect, as it led to a median BDCA2 inhibition of ~ 3% and a mean inhibition of ~ 25%. In addition, pre-clinical studies have shown that this dose has ~ 1600 safety margin against the NOAEL. Given this, the developed model could have been prospectively used to predict the dose of 0.05 mg/kg as the MABEL dose. Indeed, the lowest dose that was used in the FIH trial for BIIB059 was 0.05 mg/kg [ ].
In addition to accurately predicting a safe MABEL dose, the presented scaled model could have been used to predict the PK in humans, as its retrospective evaluation showed that its PK predictions were very close to the clinical data (Fig. 4 ). On the other hand, retrospective evaluation showed that the PD prediction was not as accurate (Fig. 5 ). The lack of accuracy in predicting the highly variable PD response using the scaled model could be attributed to many reasons including the high variability in the PD data, the potential covariates in humans that the NHP model could not account for, the non-linear human PK that the linear scaled PK model could not capture, and the PD scaling approach that was used. However, the overall clinical PK/PD prediction using NHP data has shown adequate accuracy and would have therefore allowed for a well-designed FIH study.
Conclusion
This analysis demonstrated how the clinical BIIB059 and BDCA2 levels can be predicted by implementing a quantitative modeling approach including a new scaling methodology for PD. Therefore, the presented method for scaling NHP PK/PD models of mAbs holds promise for predicting clinical PK/PD relationships and FIH doses by simply utilizing pre-clinical data.
