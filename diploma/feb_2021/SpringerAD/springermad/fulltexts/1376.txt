Introduction
The fish blood flukes (Digenea: Aporocotylidae Odhner, 1912; see Bullard et al. ) that infect sharks, skates, and rays (Chondrichthyes: Elasmobranchii) plus chimaeras (Chondrichthyes: Holocephali) presently comprise eight nominal species assigned to six genera: Selachohemecus olsoni Short, 1954 from the Atlantic sharpnose shark, Rhizoprionodon terraenovae (Richardson) (Short ; Bullard et al. ); Selachohemecus benzi Bullard et al., 2006 from the blacktip shark, Carcharhinus limbatus (Valenciennes) (Bullard et al. ); Chimaerohemecus trondheimensis van der Land, 1967 from rabbit fish, Chimaera monstrosa Linnaeus and spookfish, Hydrolagus mitsukurii Jordan and Snyder (van der Land ; Kamegai et al. ); Orchispirium heterovitellatum Madhavi and Rao, 1970 from the Bengal whipray, Brevitrygon imbricata (Bloch and Schneider) (Madhavi and Hanumantha Rao ; Bullard and Jensen ); Myliobaticola richardheardi Bullard and Jensen, 2008 from the Atlantic stingray, Hypanus sabinus (Lesueur) (Bullard and Jensen ); Hyperandrotrema cetorhini Malliard and Ktari, 1978 from the basking shark, Cetorhinus maximus (Gunnerus) (Maillard and Ktari ; Orélis-Ribeiro et al. ); Hyperandrotrema walterboegeri Orélis-Ribeiro et al., 2013 from shortfin mako shark, Isurus oxyrinchus Rafinesque (Orélis-Ribeiro et al. ); and Ogawaia glaucostegi Cutmore et al., 2018 from the giant shovelnose ray, Glaucostegus typus (Anonymous [Bennett]) (Cutmore et al. ). They collectively infect the heart, kidney, mesenteric blood vessels, and gill epithelium of four sharks and three rays in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean (Gulf of Mexico) (Short ; Bullard et al. ; Bullard and Jensen ; Orélis-Ribeiro et al. ) and Indian Ocean (Madhavi and Hanumantha Rao ; Maillard and Ktari ). The single blood fluke named from chimaeras has been reported from off Norway (van der Land ) and Japan (Kamegai et al. ), but another congener may exist off Greenland (Karlsbakk et al. ). A new species of blood fluke infecting the heart of smalltooth sawfish, Pristis pectinata Latham in the eastern Gulf of Mexico off Florida, USA, is being described by us (MBW and SAB) and will comprise the ninth named blood fluke infecting a chondrichthyan. Compared to the taxonomic diversity of blood flukes reported from ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii), those infecting early-branching fish lineages, especially chondrichthyans, remain vastly underexplored.
Herein, we propose a new genus and describe a new species of blood fluke from the heart of smooth butterfly rays, Gymnura micrura (Bloch and Schneider), (Myliobatiformes: Gymnuridae) captured in the northern Gulf of Mexico. This is the fourth species described and fourth genus proposed for a blood fluke infecting a ray.
Materials and methods
A total of 74 smooth butterfly rays were captured using a 10-m otter trawl during summer 2016 ( n = 54) and 2017 ( n = 20) from the mouth of Mobile Bay (30°13′22.61′′N, 88°3′18.57′′W) (northern Gulf of Mexico). Each smooth butterfly ray was identified using the dichotomous key of McEeachran and de Carvalho ( ) and by having a tail without serrated spines and no tentacle on the posterior margin of the spiracle. Live smooth butterfly rays were removed from the trawl and placed in a flow-through seawater tank prior to necropsy. At necropsy, each smooth butterfly ray was killed by pithing before the heart and all gill arches were excised intact, placed in separate sample bags (heart was bisected; gill arches separated), exposed to 60 °C freshwater, shaken vigorously, and preserved in 5–10% neutral buffered formalin. Gill arches, gill filaments, and corresponding sediment from the sample bags were examined using a stereo-dissecting microscope for the presence of adults and eggs of the new species. Several gill filaments from each set of gill arches were excised, wet-mounted on a glass slide, and examined with the aforementioned compound microscopes to detect blood fluke eggs in the branchial arterioles and gill epithelium (observations of eggs will be reported elsewhere). Twenty live smooth butterfly rays captured in 2017 were pithed, placed on ice, and examined for the purposes of extracting blood flukes for DNA extraction: one adult blood fluke was isolated from the heart of two smooth butterfly rays, wet-mounted on a glass slide to confirm their identity, placed directly into 95% EtOH, and stored at − 20 °C until DNA was extracted (see below). All bagged, formalin-fixed tissues were examined with the aid of a stereo-dissecting microscope and fiber optic light source to isolate blood flukes for morphology. The heart was teased apart with fine forceps to reveal adult blood flukes, and sediment from each sample bag was examined for blood flukes with aid of a settling column.
Specimens for morphology were rinsed with distilled water, cleaned with fine brushes to remove any debris, stained overnight in Van Cleave’s hematoxylin with several additional drops of Ehrlich’s hematoxylin, dehydrated using an ethanol series, cleared in clove oil, permanently mounted in Canada balsam, illustrated using Leica DM 2500 and Leica DMR microscopes each equipped with differential interference contrast (DIC) optical components, measured using an ocular micrometer, and illustrated using a drawing tube. Blood fluke measurements are reported in micrometers (μm) as the range followed by the mean, +/− standard deviation, and sample size in parentheses. Scientific names, including taxonomic authorities and dates for fishes, follow Eschmeyer et al. ( ). Morphological terms and nomenclature for blood flukes follows Bullard et al. ( , ), Bullard and Jensen ( ) and Orélis-Ribeiro et al. ( ). Type and voucher materials are deposited in the National Museum of Natural History’s Invertebrate Zoology Collection (USNM, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.) and the Auburn University Museum of Natural History (AUMNH, Auburn, AL).
Using the two EtOH-preserved and microscopically identified blood flukes, total genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted using DNeasyTM Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) as per the manufacturer’s protocol with one exception: the proteinase-K incubation period was extended overnight and the final elution step used 100 μL of elution buffer to increase the final DNA concentration. Amplification and sequencing of the large subunit ribosomal DNA (28S) used the set of primers described in Orélis-Ribeiro et al. ( ). PCR amplifications were performed according to Warren et al. ( ) with one exception: the annealing temperature was 61 °C for 30 s. DNA sequencing was performed by ACGT, Incorporated (Wheeling, IL, USA). Sequence assembly and analysis of chromatograms were performed with Geneious version 11.0.5 ( http://www.geneious.com ; Kearse et al. ). All nucleotide sequence data were deposited in GenBank (Table 1 ). Figs. 1–5 Gymnurahemecus bulbosus Warren and Bullard gen. et sp. nov.

The phylogenetic analysis included two sequences of the new species plus the taxa included in Cribb et al. ( ) (Table 1 ). The outgroup comprised the three turtle blood fluke taxa Hapalorhynchus gracilis Stunkard, 1922, Spirorchis artericola (Ward, 1921), and Vasotrema robustum Stunkard, 1928. Sequences were aligned using MAFFT (Katoh and Standley ). JModelTest 2 version 2.1.10 was implemented to perform statistical selection of the best-fit models of nucleotide substitution based on Bayesian information criteria (BIC) (Darriba et al. ). Aligned sequences were reformatted (from .fasta to .nexus) using the web application ALTER (Glez-Peña et al. ) to run Bayesian inference (BI). BI was performed in MrBayes verision 3.2.5 (Ronquist and Huelsenbeck ) using substitution model averaging (“nst-mixed”) and a gamma distribution to model rate-heterogeneity. Defaults were used in all other parameters. Three independent runs with four Metropolis-coupled chains were run for 5,000,000 generations, sampling the posterior distribution every 1000 generations. Convergence was checked using Tracer v1.6.1 (Rambaut et al. ) and the “sump” command in MrBayes: all runs appeared to reach convergence after discarding the first 25% of generation as burn-in. A majority rule consensus tree of the post burn-in posterior distribution was generated with the “sumt” command in MrBayes. The inferred phylogenetic tree was visualized using FigTree v1.4.3 (Rambaut et al. ) and further edited for visualization purposes with Adobe Illustrator (Adobe Systems).

These were identical (100% similar) to each other; differed from the 28S sequence of C. trondheimensis (AY157239) by 256 nucleotides (15%); and differed from those of O. glaucostegi and Aporocotylidae sp. NSW1 by 371 (32%) and 349 (30%) nucleotides, respectively. The recovered 28S phylogeny (Fig. 11 ) placed the new species within a clade that included sequences from two adult blood flukes ( C. trondheimensis and O. glaucostegi ) infecting chondrichthyans as well as that of a cercaria extracted from a bivalve. Expectedly, the BI tree recovered four clades comprising the blood flukes of marine actinopterygians, euryhaline elopomorphs, freshwater cercariae, and marine chondrichthyans.

Taxonomic remarks
The new genus is most similar to Hyperandrotrema (two species, both infecting lamniform sharks) and Chimaerohemecus (monotypic, infecting chimaeras) by the combination of having a minute, diminutive, aspinous anterior sucker that is not demarcated from the body, C-shaped lateral tegumental spines each associated with a muscular peduncle, intestinal caeca that are inverse U-shaped (lacking anterior caeca) and that lack diverticulae, an internal seminal vesicle and cirrus sac, an oviducal ampulla, a Laurer’s canal, an oötype that is posterior to the remainder of the genitalia, a dextral vitelline duct (posteriorly asymmetrical vitellarium), and a common genital pore (van der Land ; Maillard and Ktari ; Orélis-Ribeiro et al. ). The new genus can be easily differentiated from Chimaerohemecus and Hyperandrotrema by the combination of having a single column of lateral tegumental spines, a medial oesophageal bulb anterior to a diverticulate region of the oesophagus, intestinal caeca that terminate in the middle 1/3 of the body, a sinistral, post-caecal, post-testicular ovary, and a post-caecal common genital pore. This combination of features differentiates the new genus, Chimaerohemecus , and Hyperandrotrema from the remaining chondrichthyan blood fluke genera, i.e., Selachohemecus (comprised of two species, both infecting carcharhiniform sharks) (Short ; Bullard et al. ) plus Orchispirium , Myliobaticola , and Ogawaia (each monotypic, infecting rays) (Madhavi and Hanumantha Rao ; Bullard and Jensen ; Cutmore et al. ). Further, these features distinguish the new genus and its relatives infecting chondrichthyans from all genera of blood flukes that infect ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii). Selachohemecus is unique among chondrichthyan blood fluke genera by having X-shaped intestinal caeca and an oötype at level of the seminal vesicle as well as by lacking an oviducal ampulla (the oviducal seminal receptacle in S. olsoni and S. benzi comprises a swelling of the proximal portion of the oviduct) and Laurer’s canal. Orchispirium , Myliobaticola , and Ogawaia are distinct by having a looped testis and a post-caecal common genital pore as well as lacking lateral tegumental spines, an oviducal ampulla ( Orchispirium and Myliobaticola have an oviducal seminal receptacle comprising a swelling of the proximal portion of the oviduct), and a Laurer’s canal.
Discussion
Because chondrichthyans are the earliest branching, extant lineage of jawed vertebrate (Craniata: Gnathstomata), their blood flukes comprise an obvious and requisite group with which to test hypotheses concerning fish blood fluke monophyly and blood fluke-craniate cophyly. This area of research has progressed considerably since the late 1990s, when it was accepted that the blood flukes of fishes exhibited no detectable level of phylogenetic host specificity (Smith ). The present study, comprising only the 2nd and 3rd published elasmobranch and chondrichthyan blood fluke 28S sequences (Cribb et al. ), respectively, provides further evidence of a monophyletic chondrichthyan blood fluke lineage. This result agrees with and extends previous morphology- and/or nucleotide-based phylogenetic assertions that the blood flukes of early-branching jawed craniates are monophyletic and phylogenetically distant from the blood flukes of ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii: Euteleostei) (Bullard et al. , ; Bullard and Jensen ; Cribb et al. ; Orélis-Ribeiro et al. , , ). Clearly, the chondrichthyan blood flukes share morphological features that set them apart as unique and differentiate them from other blood flukes infecting ray-finned fishes, turtles, crocodiles, birds, and mammals (present study; Bullard et al. ; Orélis-Ribeiro et al. ). However, relatively low taxon sampling for chondrichthyan blood flukes used in molecular phylogenetic studies limits our ability to thoroughly test these patterns. Further, no life cycle for a chondrichthyan blood fluke is known. Aporocotylidae sp. NSW1 is a cercarial sequence, and the definitive host for that taxon is indeterminate; however, Cribb et al. ( ) assumed that it matured in an elasmobranch because it claded with O. glaucostegi, and that clade is sister to C . trondheimensis (Cutmore et al. ) .
Although it has been extensively demonstrated that morphologically similar fish blood flukes mature in phylogenetically related craniates (Bullard et al. , ; Bullard and Jensen ; Orélis-Ribeiro et al. , , ), no molecular phylogenetic evidence definitively supports a strict cophyly hypothesis for the blood flukes of craniates (Orélis-Ribeiro et al. ). For example, existing blood fluke phylogenies, including ours herein, fail to recover a topology reflective of the current deep classification system for the subphylum Craniata (see Nelson et al. ), i.e., the blood flukes of cartilaginous fishes are monophyletic and sister to all remaining craniate blood flukes. Instead, the recovered phylogenies generally show a monophyletic Aporocotylidae, which is sister to the paraphyletic turtle blood flukes (“Spirorchiidae”) and monophyletic Schistosomatidae (Fig. 11 ) (Orélis-Ribeiro et al. ; Cribb et al. ). Again, low taxon sampling among the blood flukes of early-branching craniates is a contributing factor to this conundrum, and this lack of information underscores the importance of robust taxonomic descriptions coupled with molecular sequence data from chondrichthyan blood flukes. Sequences from blood flukes infecting chondrichthyans (especially sharks), early-branching actinopterygians (Acipenseriformes [sturgeons and paddlefishes], Polypteriformes [bichirs], Amiiformes [bowfin], Lepisosteiformes [gars]), and early-branching members of Teleosteomorpha (see Nelson et al. ) could result in a topology that mirrors that of craniates (Chondrichthyes sister to Actinoptergyii + Sarcopterygii). Obviously, obtaining a blood fluke from a hagfish (Myxiniformes) or a lamprey (Petromyzontiformes) would be a breakthrough in this regard. Fig. 11 Phylogenetic relationships of blood flukes reconstructed using Bayesian inference with the large subunit ribosomal DNA (28S) gene. Clades are indicated by colors: blue = marine actinopterygians, green = euryhaline elopomorphs, yellow = freshwater cercariae, red = marine chondrichthyans, and black = turtle blood fluke outgroup. Numbers aside tree nodes indicate posterior probability. Scale bar is in substitutions per site
The recovered 28S phylogeny (Fig. 11 ) indicates four fish blood fluke lineages corresponding to the phylogenetic and ecological affiliation of their definitive hosts: marine actinopterygians, euryhaline elopomorphs, freshwater cercariae, and marine chondrichthyans. Cribb et al. ( ) recovered the same clades and discussed them; however, they recovered the blood flukes infecting rays and chimaeras as sister to those infecting freshwater actinopterygians. Based on only a few life cycles from marine and freshwater fish blood flukes, Orélis-Ribeiro et al. ( ) suggested a dichotomy between marine and freshwater fish blood flukes that infect polychaetes and bivalves vs. those that infect snails, respectively. Doubtless, previous speculation on the evolutionary history of the blood flukes is wanting for information about their life cycles. Although several workers have described cercariae morphologically ascribed to the fish blood flukes (Smith ), Aporocotylidae sp. NSW1 (MF503307) is the only published cercarial sequence that clades with adult blood flukes infecting chondrichthyans (Cribb et al. ). Although no life cycle for a chondrichthyan aporocotylid is known and despite not knowing the identity of the definitive host for the aforementioned cercaria, Cribb et al. ( ) speculated that all elasmobranch blood flukes utilize a bivalve intermediate host rather than a gastropod or polychaete (this assumes also that all blood flukes of marine ray-finned fishes utilize polychaetes as exemplified so far by Aporocotyle simplex Odhner, 1900 [see Køie ]; Cardicola forsteri Cribb et al., 2000 [see Cribb et al. ]; Cardicola parvus Bullard et al., 2012 [see Bullard et al. ; Siegal et al. ]; and Cardicola laruei Short, 1953 [see McVay et al. ; Siegal et al. ] only). They predicted that this could explain the phylogenetic separation between the blood flukes that mature in chondrichthyans and those of actinopterygians.
Regarding hosts and blood fluke ancestry, within the marine actinopterygian clade (Fig. 11 ), it is noteworthy that Elopicola spp. are sister to all of the blood flukes infecting the remaining marine actinopterygians. The hosts for Elopicola spp. comprise euryhaline fishes, ladyfishes ( Elops spp.: Elopidae), and tarpons ( Megalops spp.: Megalopidae) (Orélis-Ribeiro et al. ) that spend considerable periods of their life in freshwater or low salinity estuarine waters (Zale and Merrifield ; Adams and Cooke ). Bullard ( ) documented eggs and schistosomula larvae of Elopicola nolancribbi Bullard, 2014 in the gill epithelium and blood of juvenile ladyfish ( Elops saurus Linnaeus) in a northern Gulf of Mexico estuary; suggesting that the life cycle was being completed in that estuary or a nearby river(s). Species of Elopicola Bullard, 2014 and Paracardicoloides Martin, 1974 infect fishes with a leptocephalus larva (Euteleostei: Elopomorpha), are morphologically similar, and are sister taxa based on ITS2 sequence data (Bullard ; Orélis-Ribeiro et al. ); all of which strongly suggest cophyly among elopomorphs and their blood flukes. Nolan and Cribb ( ) demonstrated the life cycle of P. yamagutii , which infects a riverine freshwater snail ( Posticobia brazieri [Smith] [Littorinimorpha: Tateidae]) and matures in the Australian long-finned eel, Anguilla reinhardtii Steindachner. The assertion that related blood flukes infect related intermediate hosts predicts that Elopicola spp. (like the related P. yamagutii ) use gastropods rather than bivalves or polychaetes. Cercariae ascribed to the fish blood flukes by molecular barcoding and phylogenetic inference (i.e., Aporocotylidae sp. W5003, Sanguincola cf. inermis , and Aporocotylidae sp. W5004; see Cribb et al. ) also infect gastropods but are distantly related to Elopicola spp. Hence, Cribb et al.’s ( ) tree and ours herein (if Elopicola spp. have a gastropod intermediate host) suggest that gastropod blood flukes are paraphyletic.
We do not know the intermediate host for G. bulbosus , but based upon Cribb et al.’s ( ) prediction, it should be an estuarine or littoral bivalve. Scant information is available on the life histories of the smooth butterfly rays throughout their range; however, this fish is considered to be a relatively non-vagile resident of estuaries, with females producing offspring year-round (Yokota and Lessa ; Yokota et al. ). Given the residency of this elasmobranch, the host is likely littoral or estuarine. Examinations of estuarine invertebrates in the northern Gulf of Mexico continue (MBW) in an attempt to isolate infected intermediate hosts, especially bivalves.
Phylogenetic analyses involving the chimaera blood fluke C. trondheimensis and the ray blood flukes consistently produce long branches (Bullard et al. ; Bray et al. ; Orélis-Ribeiro et al. , , ; Santoro et al. ; Yong et al. , , ; Cribb et al. ; Siegal et al. ). We speculate that the genetic differences that produce these long branches are indicative of a long phylogenetic separation from other blood flukes and that morphological distinctness is reflected by genetic distinctness. The inferred long branches could also be a result of limitations to taxon sampling associated with extinction in chimaera and ray blood flukes (and their hosts). Furthermore, unresolved, deep relationships among chondrichthyan and ray-finned fish blood flukes (Fig. 11 ) are likely a result of long branch artifacts. Greater taxon and character sampling will ultimately be needed to resolve relationships among these major lineages.
