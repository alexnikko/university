Introduction
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly, and 11% of the population over the age of 65 and about one third of the people 85 and older suffer from the disorder [ ]. The most common clinical signs of AD are memory loss and behavior changes. As the disease progresses, people experience greater memory loss and other cognitive difficulties. Next, control language, reasoning, sensory processing, and conscious thought are damaged. Finally, people with AD at late stage cannot carry out daily activities and depend on others for daily care with the overall decline in physical function [ ]. There are no reliable early diagnostic biomarkers and no treatments to stop or reverse its progression, though some may temporarily improve symptoms. Neuritic plaque and neurofibrillary tangle are the two main pathological characteristics of AD neuropathology [ , ]. Amyloid β protein (Aβ), the central component of the plaques, is a cleaved product of APP [ ], and the hyperphosphorylated tau, a microtubule-associated protein, forms the core of tangles [ , ]. Less than 1% of the cases are familial Alzheimer’s disease and caused by mutations in the amyloid β precursor protein (APP) gene, presenilin-1 (PSEN1), and presenilin-2 (PSEN2) [ , , ]. The cause for sporadic AD cases is still unknown [ ].
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading health and socioeconomic problems in the world. The cost of hospitalization and treatments has raised great concerns by the healthcare system. The social and economical cost has reached $38 billion per year [ ]. TBI is defined as structural injury and/or physiological disruption of brain function resulting from the head striking a hard object or from rapid brain acceleration or deceleration. Causes of TBI are falls, motor vehicle accidents, being struck by or against, and assaults [ ]. TBI can cause a host of physical, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral changes, and outcomes can range from complete recovery to permanent disability or death [ ]. TBI causes acute pathological changes around the region of injury and initiates a long-term neurodegeneration. The penetration of the brain structure can tear neurons, shear axons, disrupt neuronal circuitry, and damage the vasculature, with further impact on the brain through induction of necrotic cell loss as well as apoptosis of the surrounding cells [ , , , , ]. Moderate and severe head injury increased the risk of AD for 2.3 and 4.5 times, respectively [ ]. TBI has been considered as a risk factor of developing AD [ ]. The key components of amyloidogenic cascade APP, BACE1, and PS1 were increased in the damaged axons of TBI patients [ ], and BACE1 and PS1 were considered the promising targets for treatment of TBI [ ]. Edema, inflammatory and axonal injury, and deposition of Aβ were localized pathological changes following TBI [ , , ]. Metabolic dysfunction has also been implicated in the incidence and progression of neurodegenerative disorders [ ]. Abnormal glucose tolerance is a common metabolic dysfunction observed in AD [ , ]. Whether the alteration in systemic metabolism is a cause linked to AD or is a consequence of the disease development is still unclear. Furthermore, whether TBI will affect the metabolic function in AD remains elusive.
Metabolomics is a large-scale and high-throughput measurement of metabolites in biological samples such as cells, tissues, and bio-fluids [ , , ]. It applies a comprehensive, simultaneous, and systematic analysis of multiple metabolites in biological samples. Metabolomics analysis uses methods including high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy (GCMS), and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) [ , , ]. Here, we used the 1 H-NMR approach to analyze the metabolic differences of serum and urine samples from the mouse model of AD with or without TBI. Results showed TBI induced alteration of metabolites in AD model mice and suggested that mitochondrial dysfunction might play a key role in the connection between TBI and AD.
Materials and Methods
Animals
Animal experiment protocols were approved by the Chongqing Medical University Animal Ethics Committee. APP23 transgenic mice carry human APP751 complementary DNA (cDNA) with the Swedish double mutation at positions 670/671(KM → NL) under control of the murine Thy-1.2 expression cassette [ , ]. PS45 transgenic mice carry human presenilin-1 cDNA with the G384A mutation under control of the murine Thy1 promoter [ , ]. APP23 and PS45 mice were backcrossed to generate double transgenic mice [ ]. The double transgenic mice overexpress mutant APP and PS1 and develop neuritic plaques in the neocortex and hippocampus at 6–8 weeks of age. The genotype of the mice were confirmed by PCR.
Traumatic Brain Injury
In order to study the effects of injury on the brain, we have adopted the weight drop model which avoids the interference of surgical invasion. The weight drop model of TBI with the gravitational forces of free falling is used to produce closed head injury. The weight drop device consists of a hollow plexiglas tube 2 cm in diameter and 40 cm long, a cylindrical-shaped acrylic stick (20 g), and a foam platform. The tube is kept vertical to the surface of the mouse head and guides the freely falling acrylic stick onto the head. The diameter of the upper part of the stick is 1.8 cm, which allows little lateralization of the stick to hit the head. The end of the stick is flat, round, and 1 cm in diameter which will hit the top of the mouse head encompassing the area over the frontal and parietal bones. According to the model of diffuse brain injury [ ], this model produced long-lasting deficits of learning and memory, short duration of brain edema, and transient neurobehavioral suppression like human concussive brain injury after TBI, but without brain contusion and focal lesion [ , ].
The double transgenic mice were randomly assigned to the TBI group and control group. All of the TBI mice were anesthesized by 2.5% isoflurane and received the concussive-like head injury once at 8 weeks of age. When the extremity reflex of the mouse that was stimulated by a needle to the toe disappeared, the mouse was placed on the foam platform in the prone position quickly. The hollow plexiglas tube was adjusted to assure that the head of the mouse was tightly approximated to the lower end of it. The end of the stick produced an impact on the area between the coronal and the lambdoid sustures. From 35 cm height, the stick was freely dropped through the hollow plexiglas tube. Meanwhile, the weight linked to the other end of the stick was released to prevent secondary damage. The control mice were anesthetized and placed on the foam platform in the same fashion as the TBI mice without injury.
After the head trauma, we recorded the intensity of each convulsion [ ] as well as the unconsciousness time which was evaluated by the duration of the loss of righting reflex [ ]. After consciousness (indicated by return of righting reflex and mobility) was regained, the mouse was put back to its home cage. The control mouse was anesthetized and placed on the platform in the same fashion as the injured ones, but without any injury.
Morris Water Maze
Animals were subjected to the Morris water maze test 2 weeks after TBI treatment. The test was performed in a 1.5-m-diameter pool with a 10-cm-diameter platform. The procedure consisted of 1 day of visible platform tests, 4 days of hidden platform tests, and a probe trail 24 h after the last hidden platform test. On the first day, the mice were tested for five continuous trials, with the platform 1 cm above the surface of the water placed in the southeastern quadrant with an inter-trial interval of 60 min. On days 2 to 5, the platform was submerged 1 cm below the surface. The mice were trained for five trials with an inter-trial interval of 1 h. Each mouse has 60 s to find the platform. If the mouse found the platform before the 60-s cutoff, the mouse was allowed to stay on the platform for 5 s. If the mouse did not find the platform, the mouse was placed on the platform and allowed it to stay there for 20 s before returning to its home cage. On the last day, the mouse was tested for one trial with the platform removed [ ]. The distance traveled, escape latency, and number of passes through the platform were recorded by automated video tracking (ANY-maze, Stoelting), and the data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s post hoc test.
Immunohistochemical Staining
Mice were sacrificed at 3 months of age after behavioral test. Halves of the brains were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and sectioned with a Leica Cryostat to 30-μm thickness. Every 12th slice with the same reference position was mounted onto slides for staining. Immunocytochemical staining was performed on floating sections. The plaques in the sections were detected with biotinylated monoclonal 4G8 antibody (Covance) in 1:500 dilution, visualized by the ABC and DAB method, and counted under a microscope with ×40 magnification as previously described [ , ]. The average plaque count per slice was recorded for each mouse. Thioflavin S staining of plaques was also performed with 1% Thioflavin S visualized using fluorescence microscopy [ ].
Western Blotting and Aβ40/42 ELISA Assay
Brain tissue lysates were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer supplemented with a complete Mini Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablet (Roche Diagnostics). The samples were boiled after being diluted in 4× SDS sample buffer, and resolved on 12% Tris-glycine-SDS-PAGE or 16% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE gels, followed by transfer to polyvindylidine fluoride (PVDFFL) membranes. Rabbit anti-APP C-terminal polyclonal antibody C20 was used to detect full-length APP and its CTF products. BACE1 was detected by D10E5 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). ADAM10 was detected by anti-ADAM10 antibody (Abcam). β-Actin expression was analyzed using monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody AC-15 (Sigma), and used as an internal control. Densitometry was visualized on the resulting bands using Odyssey system (LI-COR Biosciences). The hippocampus tissues of APP23/PS45 double transgenic mouse were prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions of the ELISA protocol (Invitrogen). The concentration of Aβ40/42 was measured using Aβ40/Aβ42 Colorimetric ELISA kit (Invitrogen).
Blood and Urine Sample Collection
Cardiac blood without anticoagulant was collected before sacrificing mice. Serum was obtained by centrifugation at 4000 RCF for 10 min. Volumes of blood collected range from 500 to 800 μL for a mouse, and isolated serum ranges from 200 to 300 μL. The serum was stored at −80 °C until NMR experiment. Urine was collected for 12 h after fasting at three time points: 24 h before TBI, 24 h post TBI, and 24 h before sacrificed. Metabolism cages were used to collect urine overnight. The urine samples were stored on ice with 0.1 mL of 1% sodium azide solution and then centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was stored at −80 °C until measurement.
Preparation of Samples and Acquisition of 1H-NMR Spectra
Prior to 1 HNMR analysis, urine samples were thrawed, and 200-μL aliquots were mixed with 50 μL D 2 O containing sodium trimethylsilyl propionate-d4 (TSP) (0.018 g/mL) and 300 μL of phosphate buffer (0.2 M Na 2 HPO 4 /NaH 2 PO 4 , pH 7.4) to minimize variations in pH. The mixtures were centrifuged at 12000 g for 10 min at 4 °C to separate any precipitate, and then 500 μL of the supernatant was transferred to 5-mm NMR tubes [ ]. D 2 O provided a field frequency lock, and TSP was used as the chemical shift reference. Serum samples were thawed, and 150 μL of each was diluted by 300 μL of phosphate buffer (0.2 mM Na 2 HPO 4 /NaH 2 PO 4 , pH 7.4) to minimize variations in pH and 50 μL D 2 O for a field frequency lock. The mixed serum samples were centrifuged at 12000 g for 10 min at 4 °C to separate any precipitate. Aliquots of 450 μL of the supernatants were transferred to 5-mm NMR tubes [ ].
All NMR spectra were recorded at 298 K on a Bruker AVANCE III 600 NMR spectrometer operating at 600.13 MHz 1 H frequency and equipped with a triple resonance probe. The CPMG (Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill) pulse sequence was used to attenuate the broad NMR signals from slowly tumbling molecules such as proteins and retain those from low-molecular-weight compounds. Typically, 128 scans were collected into 64-K data points over a spectral width of 12,000 Hz with a relaxation delay of 4 s and an acquisition time of 2.65 s. An exponential line broadening of 0.3 Hz was applied to the FID prior to Fourier transformation. All spectra were carefully phased and baseline corrected and referenced to the methyl peak of lactate (CH3, d1.33) [ ].
Data Processing of NMR Spectra and Multivariate Pattern Recognition
In order to exploit all the metabolic information embedded in the spectra, all NMR spectra were divided into integral regions with an equal width of 0.01 ppm (buckets) corresponding to the region of 10.0–1 using TopSpin 2.1 software package (Varian, Inc.) for multivariate pattern recognition analysis. Another data was divided into integral regions with an equal width of 0.0015 ppm for quantitative analysis. The remaining spectral segments for each NMR spectrum were normalized to the total sum of the spectral intensity to partially compensate for differences in concentration of the many metabolites in the samples. Subsequently, the normalized integral values were entered into SIMCA-P +V12.0 software (Umetrics, Ume, Sweden) as variables and were subjected to analysis by partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) [ , ], where each point represents an individual spectrum of a serum sample. PLS-DA revealed the differences of serum composition in different groups, which are assessed by R 2 and Q 2 .
Statistical Analysis
The statistical significance of metabolite quality between different groups was performed by using the independent-samples t test in the SPSS11.0 software (SPSS Inc., USA). The P values of <0.05 were considered to be of statistical significance.
Results
TBI Increases Aβ Deposition and Neuritic Plaque Formation in the Brain of AD Mice
To assess whether TBI could have any effect on AD-associated phenotypes, TBI was induced on APP23/PS45 double transgenic mice. A weight drop model of TBI was used to produce head injury on the mice at 8 weeks of age. The TBI and control group mice were sacrificed after behavioral test at 3 months of age. Neuritic plaques were detected in the brain by 4G8 immunostaining (Fig. 1 a, b) and Thioflavin S (Fig. 1 d, e). The number of neuritic plaques in the brain of TBI mice was significantly increased when compared to the control mice (55.68 ± 1.66 vs. 41.14 ± 3.46 per slice) ( P < 0.01) (Fig. 1 c). Thioflavin S staining further confirmed that TBI increased plaque formation in AD model mice (Fig. 1 d, e). Fig. 1 TBI increases neuritic plaque formation in AD transgenic mice. APP23/PS45 double transgenic mice were subjected to traumatic brain injury once at the age of 2 months. All the mice were sacrificed at 3 months after behavioral tests. Neuritic plaques were detected using Aβ-specific monoclonal antibody (4G8) and Thioflavin S fluorescent, respectively. The plaques were visualized by microscopy with ×40 magnification. a , b Neuritic plaques were detected using Aβ-specific monoclonal antibody (4G8). Black arrows point to plaques. Bars 500 μm.

TBI Promotes β-Secretase Cleavage of APP
Deposition of Aβ to form neuritic plaques in the brain is the unique pathological feature to AD. Aβ is generated from APP by sequential β- and γ-secretase cleavages. BACE1 is the β-secretase in vivo [ ], and presenilin-1 (PS1) is the key component of the γ-secretase complex [ , , ]. APP is also cleaved by ADAM10 at the α-secretase site in neuron to preclude Aβ production [ ]. To explore whether TBI regulated APP processing and its products, Western blot analysis was performed to select the protein expression level of APP, APP-CTFs, BACE1, ADAM10, and PS1 in the brain of APP23/PS45 mice. The TBI mice were subjected to one TBI treatment at 2 months, while age-matched control mice received sham treatment. The mice were then sacrificed at 3 months of age. TBI treatment significantly increased the brain level of APP (to 142.6% ± 9.0%), BACE1 (to 135.7% ± 7.9%), and its cleaved CTFβ fragments C99 and C89 (to 167.6% ± 19.6%) compared to controls ( P < 0.05) (Fig. 2 a, b). In addition, we examined the levels of ADAM10 and PS1, and the results showed that TBI had no effect on the protein level of ADAM10 and PS1 ( P > 0.05) (Fig. 2 a, b). We further assayed the level of Aβ40/42 in the brain of AD model mice. TBI treatment significantly inceased the level of Aβ40 to 151.2% ± 3.6% ( P < 0.01 relative to control) (Fig. 2 c) and Aβ42 to 263.0% ± 26.3% ( P < 0.01 relative to control) (Fig. 2 d), respectively. These data demonstrated that TBI increased BACE1-mediated β-secretase cleavage of APP, leading to overpreduction of Aβ and increased plaque formation. Fig. 2 TBI promotes β-secretase cleavage of APP. a Half brains of APP23/PS45 mice from TBI and control groups were lysed in RIPA-Doc lysis buffer and separated with 16% Tris-Tricine and 12% Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE. APP full-length and CTF β (C99 and C89) were detected by C20 polyclonal antibody. BACE1 was detected by D10E5 antibody. ADAM10 was detected by anti-ADAM10 antibody. PS1 was detected by anti-PS1 N terminal antibody 231. The β-actin was detected by anti-β-actin antibody AC-15 as the internal control. b Quantification showed that APP and CTF β were significantly increased, whereas PS1 and ADAM10 had no significant difference. n = 20 mice total. * P < 0.05 by Student’s t test. c , d ELISA assay was performed to measure Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels from the brain tissues of APP23/PS45 mice.

TBI Exacerbates Memory Deficits in AD Model Mice
Morris water maze test was performed to assess whether TBI affects the learning and memory of AD mice. The test was performed 2 weeks after APP23/PS45 double transgenic mice undergoing TBI or sham operation. In the visible platform test, TBI mice and control mice had similar escape latency (48.67 ± 4.74 s and 39.78 ± 4.34 s) ( P > 0.05) (Fig. 3 a) and path length (7.18 ± 0.77 and 9.02 ± 1.61 m) ( P > 0.05) (Fig. 3 b), respectively, indicating that mobility or vision was not injured by TBI treatment. In the hidden platform test, there was significant difference between TBI mice and control mice. TBI mice spent more time to find the hidden platform than control mice ( P < 0.01) (Fig. 3 c). Meanwhile, the TBI mice swam longer distances to reach the platform when compared to control mice ( P < 0.01) (Fig. 3 d). On the last day of the probe trial, the platform was removed. TBI mice spent less time traveling into the third quadrant where the hidden platform was previously placed as compared with control mice (3.6 ± 0.22 and 5.9 ± 0.28 times; P < 0.01) (Fig. 3 e). The result indicates that TBI exacerbated the learning and memory deficits of AD mice. Fig. 3 TBI exuberates memory deficits in AD transgenic mice. APP23/PS45 mice were subjected to TBI once at 2 months of age. Two weeks later, the Morris water maze test was performed ( n = 10 in each group). ANY-maze tracking software was used for recording mouse movement. a The first day is visible platform test; the TBI and control APP23/PS45 mice showed a similar latency to escape onto the visible platform. P > 0.05, Student’s t test. b The two groups of mice had similar swimming distances before escaping onto the visible platform in the visible platform test. P > 0.05, Student’s t test. c In hidden platform tests, mice were trained with five trials per day for 4 days. TBI mice had a longer latency to escape onto the hidden platform. * P < 0.01 by ANOVA. d The TBI mice had a longer swimming length before escaping onto the hidden platform. * P < 0.01 by ANOVA. e In the probe trail on the sixth day, the TBI mice traveled significantly less times than control mice into the third quadrant, where the hidden platform was previously placed. * P < 0.001, Student’s t test
1H-NMR-Based Metabonomics of Serum Samples from APP23/PS45 Mice
To assess the effect of TBI on the metabolism in AD pathogenesis, a metabonomics approach was used to examine the metabolic changes in the AD double transgenic mice after TBI treatment. We first performed 1 H-NMR analysis of the serum metobilites from TBI-APP23/PS45 mice and control APP23/PS45 mice. Representative 1 H-NMR spectra of the serum samples are shown in Fig. 4 . Resonance assignments were performed [ , ]. The spectroscopic profiling of the two groups showed major metabolites (Fig. 4 a, b), and the projection to latent structure discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) demonstrated a characteristic difference in metabolic pattern (Fig. 4 c) between TBI mice and control mice ( R 2 X = 0.636, R 2 Y = 0.868, Q 2 = 0.622, Fig. 4 c). The plot displayed a clear separation of trajectory diagrams of the two groups (Fig. 4 d). To confirm the change of the metabolites, the integral levels of serum samples from TBI and control groups of the AD mice were further analyzed (Table 1 ). The TBI mice showed reduced level of alanine, glycine, histidine, choline, and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) ( P < 0.05) as compared with control mice. The results showed that TBI treatment disturbed the metabolic balance, especially in amino acids and TMAO.

1H-NMR-Based Metabonomics of Urine Samples from APP23/PS45 Mice
Next, we examined the metabolites in urine sample from 24 h pre TBI at 8 weeks, 24 h post TBI, and 24 h before sacrificed at 12 weeks. Compared with control mice, all the metabolites in TBI mice had no significant difference from control before treatment ( R 2 X = 0.544, R 2 Y = 0.645, Q 2 = −0.33, Supplemental Fig. 1 and Supplemental Table 1 ). However, post TBI the projection to latent structure discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) demonstrated a characteristic difference in metabolic pattern ( R 2 X = 0.653, R 2 Y = 0.984, Q 2 = 0.508, Fig. 5 c). The levels of creatine and cis -aconitate were remarkably increased in TBI mice and control mice ( P < 0.05), but the alteration was restored before sacrifice. Before sacrifice, the levels of DMG and O -phosphocholine in TBI mice were higher than that of control mice ( P < 0.05) (Supplemental Table 1 ).

There were 11 spieces of metabolites altered between pre- and post-treatment at 8 weeks in TBI mice. Compared with TBI mice before treatment, the level of 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG), citrate, cis -aconitate, hippurate, and fumarate were significantly increased after treatment, whereas 2-hydrobutyrate(2-HB), lactate, acetate, acetoacetate, pyruvate, and malonate concentrations were reduced markedly ( P < 0.05).

Discussion
Over the past decades, increasing evidences have linked traumatic brain injury to a greater risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease [ ]. The traumatic brain injury’s direct effects could be long-lasting and even permanent. However, the mechanism on how TBI initiates and promotes the occurrence of AD is still unclear. Falls are the leading cause of traumatic brain injury for all ages. In this study, we examined the effects of TBI on plaque formation and memory by using a weight-drop model of TBI on an Alzheimer’s disease mouse model. We found a more dramatic plaque formation and significant memory deficits after TBI. Previous studies reported the accelerated Aβ aggregation and cognitive impairment in transgenic AD mice at 24 h, 7 days, and even 6 weeks after TBI [ , ]. Another study showed that increased Aβ deposition and cognitive changes were observed at 28 days, not 7 days, after TBI [ ]. The epidemiological survey illustrated that the observed time from injury to AD onset was shorter than expected in the TBI cases who subsequently developed Alzheimer’s disease, and the effect of TBI on time to onset was greatest when the injury occurred before the age of 65. With advancing age, the effect of TBI on time to onset may be diluted by the exponential increase in the risk of AD [ ]. Our results show that the protein levels of APP, BACE1, CTF β , Aβ40, and Aβ42 were signifcantly increased in the brain of APP23/PS45 transgenic mice at 4 weeks after TBI. These results demonstrated that TBI could have a long-lasting effect on triggering amyloid beta processing, which is the central component of Alzheimer’s disease.
There have been few studies on TBI’s effect on metabolism in AD. Our results revealed that TBI alters metabolism in the AD transgenic mouse model. In this study, the reduced level of choline, trimethylamine- N -oxide (TMAO), and glycine in serum of the TBI group suggested the disturbance of the methylamine metabolism pathway. Choline is hydrolyzed from dietary phosphatidylcholine and then converted to trimethylamine (TMA) by microbial lysis in the colon, and further converted to TMAO in the liver by hepatic flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs) [ ]. Choline, as the precursor of neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the central nervous system and the precursor of sphingomyelin and phosphatidylcholine as structural components of cell membranes, is an essential molecule for several biological functions including cholinergic neural networks associated with learning and memory [ ]. The loss of cholinergic neurons and the deficiency of choline acetyltransferase activity are associated with learning and memory deficits in AD [ ], and adequate concentrations of choline are believed to be protective against AD [ ]. We found that TBI resulted in lower serum level of choline, which could further facilitate cognitive deficits in AD. Glycine, an antioxidant and a source of glutathione, can relieve the damage of oxygen free radicals to the body [ ]. The decreased serum glycine by TBI in this study might represent an increased oxidative stress. Consistent with our study, reduced glycine was found in the hippocampus and the cortex of APP/PS1 transgenic mice [ ]. However, Jimenez-Jimenez et al. observed increased glycine in the serum of AD patients [ ]. The species variation, sample resources, and interventions might lead to the inconsistency.
Urine samples are easily collected, and metabolite changes in urine could serve as indicators of disease pathogenesis and its biomarkers. We found that TBI induces significant changes of metabolites. There were decreased levels in lactate, pyruvate, acetate, and acetoacetate, and increased level in citrate and cis -aconitate after TBI treatment. These metabolic differences associated with an abnormal energy metabolism, corroborated by the decline of glycolysis and an increase of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.
Brain tissue consumes a large amount of energy which typically gets most of its energy from oxygen-dependent metabolism of glucose [ ]. Reduction of the cerebral metabolic rate for glucose and oxygen supply is one of the main features of Alzheimer’s disease [ , ]. In the present study, the decline of glycolysis and increase of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle were observed in APP23/PS45 double transgenic mouse after TBI. TBI results in the disruption of brain energy metabolism, and the energy deficit is associated with the degree of neuronal damage [ ]. Mitochondrial dysfunction could be transient as in mild TBI (mTBI), or permanent as in severe TBI (sTBI) [ , ]. Glucose metabolism dysregulation occurs after TBI and leads to hyperglycolysis during persistent mitochondrial malfunctioning. Mitochondrial dysfunction affected tau phosphorylation [ , ] and could induce inflammation [ ], as well as APP processing [ , ]. TBI could induce a complex pathophysiology, including inflammation, metabolic perturbation, and mitochondrial damage. Our results demonstrated that TBI perturbed the maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis.
A history of TBI has been found to increase risk for developing cognitive impairment. The clinical data showed that a history of traumatic brain injury can accelerate cognitive decline with age. The amelioration for cognitive impairment after TBI might help to prevent exacerbation in the later age. In our study, we identified that the metabolism of glucose, methylamine, and amino acids and the TCA cycle were disturbed by TBI in serum and urine of transgenic mouse model of AD. These changes indicate that oxidative stress, energy metabolism, and mitochondrial dysfunction could mediate TBI to accelerate the development of AD. This result from the metabolic analysis is very meaningful to find biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease development and also important for designing treatment strategies after TBI, which can help to ameliorate exacerbated cognitive impairment and potentially prevent cognitive deficit. Future studies are needed to identify the molecular mechanisms that mediate the metabolic dysfunction on cognitive impairment after TBI.
