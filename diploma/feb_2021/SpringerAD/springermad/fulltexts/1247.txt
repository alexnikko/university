Introduction
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer worldwide [ , ]. Despite of the recent improvements in the therapy, CRC remains as a global public health problem due to its poor prognosis [ ]. Evidence has shown that early diagnosis of CRC is vital for the outcome of CRC [ ]. Thus, identification of new biomarkers with high sensitivity and specificity is necessary for the early diagnosis of CRC.
Aberrant gene methylation has been shown to contribute to the loss of gene function and the occurrence of cancers [ , , , , ], including CRC [ , , ]. Meanwhile, methylated DNA is chemically and biologically stable and less subjected to transient alterations [ ], which considered as an ideal biomarker in the occurrence and progress of carcinoma.
SFRP1 and SFRP2 are tumor suppressor genes of the SFRP family. Wnt proteins and Frizzled receptors can interact with each other through SRPF1 in the extracellular compartment. It is noteworthy that SFRP1 plays a key role in embryonic development, cell differentiation and proliferation [ ]. SFRP2 protein can inhibit Wnt receptor from binding to downregulate pathway signaling [ ]. Previous studies showed that SFRP1 and SFRP2 hypermethylation had been found in CRC [ , , , , , ]. However, those studies were involved with a relative fewer CRC samples (from 15 to 52) in Europeans and Asians. And most of those studies were performed by methylation specific PCR (MSP), a qualitative approach with a low sensitivity in methylation detection [ ].
In this study, SFRP1 and SFRP2 methylation was measured by quantitative methylation specific PCR (qMSP) in tumor and para-tumor tissues of 80 Chinese Han CRC patients. The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between candidate genes methylation and CRC.
Materials and Methods
Tissue Samples
Frozen tissue samples from 80 CRC patients were obtained from Shaoxing People’s Hospital (Zhejiang, China) and Zhejiang Tumor Hospital (Zhejiang, China) in the study. The patients were diagnosed with CRC by pathologists’ histological diagnosis and no one had ever received radiation or chemotherapy before surgery. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained slides were used to determine representative areas of invasive tumor. We examined each sample by microscope and there are over 80% of cancer cells presenting in each sample. The study was approved by ethical committees at Shaoxing People’s Hospital and Zhejiang Cancer Hospital. Written informed consent forms were obtained from all participating individuals.
DNA Isolation, Bisulfite Modification and Quantitative Methylation Specific PCR (qMSP)
The details of DNA isolation, bisulfite modification and qMSP were as described previously [ ]. E.Z.N.A.™ Tissue Kit (Omega Bio-Tek, Norcross, GA) was used to isolate genomic DNA according to the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA concentration was determined by using Nanodrop2000 spectrophotometer (Thermal Scientific Co. Ltd., Wilmington, USA). Genomic DNA was chemically modified by bisulfite modification, which converted unmethylated cytosine to thymine, whereas methylated cytosine would not be change. SYBR green-based quantitative methylation specific PCR (qMSP) was performed by LightCycler® 480 (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) after DNA extraction and bisulfite conversion, aiming to quantify the extent of gene methylation. The primer sequences were shown in Table 1 . The whole system of qMSP was add up to 10 μl containing 0.25 μl primers, 1 μl transformed DNA, 4 μl of ddH2O and 5 μl of 2 × SYBR Green Master Mix. PCR was conducted under the following conditions: 1 cycle at 95 °C for 10 min, 45 cycles at 95 °C for 20 s, specific annealing temperature (Table 1 ) for 20 s, 72 °C for 30 s, 1 cycle for the melting curve analysis at 95 °C of 15 s, 60 °C of 1 min, then increasing temperature at 0.11 °C per second to 95 °C, and a final extension stage at 40 °C for 10 min. ACTB was chosen as the internal reference, and methylated sperm DNA from a healthy individual by excess SssI methyltransferase (Thermo Fisher Scientiific, Uppsala, Sweden) was used as a positive control. The percentage of methylated reference (PMR) of the 2 genes in each sample was calculated by 2 −ΔΔCt quantification approach, in which ΔΔCt = sample DNA (Ct target gene – Ct ACTB ) − fully methylated DNA (Ct target gene – Ct ACTB ) [ ].

Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay
The human embryonic kidney 293 T (HEK293T) cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin Solution. The target fragments of SFRP1 and SFRP2 were purified by Cycle Pure Kit (Omega, Norcross, GA, USA). The amplified genes and the plasmid were digested by XhoI and KpnI (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). The pGL3 control vector (Promega, Madison city, WI, USA) containing SV40 promoter upstream of the luciferase gene was used as a positive control and the empty pGL3-Basic vector was used as a negative control. The target fragments were cloned to pGL3 promoter vector in the presence of DNA Ligation Kit (TaKaRa, Japan). Cells were prepared in 96-well plates and details of plasmid transfection were described in previous articles [ ]. Luciferase activity was determined by the dual luciferase reporter gene assay system (Dual-Luciferase® Reporter Assay Systems, Promega, Madison city, WI, USA). Each test was carried out in triplicate.
Data Mining Study
We extracted the 450 K array data of 395 CRC patients from the TCGA database. The methylation level of Methyl450 CpG site (cg15839448) was used to present the methylation of SFRP1 . The mean methylation levels of cg05874561 and cg05774801 were used to present the methylation of SFRP2. And SFRP1 and SFRP2 methylation levels also were compared between 395 CRC tumor tissues and 48 non-tumor tissues. Moreover, we measured the association between SFRP1 and SFRP2 methylation and expression among 214 CRC tumor tissues according to the TCGA database. The expression data were retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database ( www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo , accession no. GSE32323). We compared the expression changes of SFRP1 and SFRP2 in three CRC cell lines (COLO20, HCT116 and HT29) with and without 5′-AZA-deoxycytidine treatment.
Statistical Analysis
Spearman correlation test was used to determine the relationship between association between clinicopathological characteristics and gene methylation. Either independent sample T test or nonparametric test was used to detect the methylation differences between tumor tissues and non-tumor tissues. The diagnostic value of SFRP1 and SFRP2 methylation for CRC was evaluated by the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) test. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant difference.
Results
We collected 80 pairs of CRC tumor samples and adjacent non-tumor samples for the detection of SFRP1 and SFRP2 methylation. The target fragments of SFRP1 and SFRP2 in the current methylation assay included 103 bp (hg19, chr8: 41166328–41,166,430, Fig. 1 a) and 167 bp (hg19, chr4: 154709692–154,709,858, Fig. 2 a), respectively. Meanwhile, we used the Sanger sequencing method to confirm that the amplified fragments matched the target sequences (Fig. 1 b, Fig. 2 b).

The methylation levels of SFRP1 and SFRP2 in tumor tissues were significantly higher than those in paired para-tumor tissues [PMR of SFRP1 : 12.035% (1.710%, 50.498%) versus 2.225% (0.323%, 10.210%), P = 2E-5; PMR of SFRP2 : 15.635% (0.675%, 103.675%) versus 5.905% (0.500%, 36.525%), P = 0.014; Fig. 3 a]. Then, SFRP1 and SFRP2 hypermethylation was found in 56 out of 80 CRC patients and 45 out of 80 CRC patients, respectively. Moreover, we examined the correlation between the methylation of SFRP1 and SFRP2 and the clinicopathological features of CRC patients. However, no statistically significant correlation was found between the methylation of two genes with age, gender, differentiation, lymph node metastasis, tumor stage, tumor size, and tumor localization (Table 2 ).

In addition, we assessed the association between the clinicopathological features of CRC patients and tumor localization. In the present study, we did not find any statistically significant correlation of tumor localization with age, gender, differentiation, lymph node metastasis, or tumor stage ( P > 0.05). Interestingly, there was a significant correlation between tumor localization and tumor size ( P = 0.001). Tumors with size larger than 6 cm were more frequently in the colon cancer (17/39) than rectum cancer (5/41). More studies should be performed to explain the explicit relationship between the clinical characteristics of CRC and tumor localization.
Subsequently, we used ROC curve to calculate the diagnostic value of SFRP1 and SFRP2 methylation in CRC, respectively. The area under the curve of SFRP1 is 0.669 (95% CI: 0.586–0.753), with a sensitivity of 60.0% and a specificity of 70.0%. And the area under the curve of SFRP2 is 0.555 (95% CI: 0.465–0.645) with a sensitivity of 38.8% and a specificity of 77.5%.
According to our previous study, no significant promoter activity could be found for the recombinant plasmids of SFRP1 and SFRP2 fragments [ ]. In the current study, luciferase reporter gene assay showed that the recombinant plasmids with SFRP1 and SFRP2 fragments could enhance the promoter activity ( SFRP1 : P = 0.002, SFRP2 : P = 0.004, Fig. 3 b).
The data from Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was downloaded to validate the result. Our data mining study showed that the relative methylation levels of SFRP1 (cg 05874561) were significantly higher in CRC tissues than that in paired adjacent non-tumor tissues [the mean β value: 0.0467 (−0.0184, −0.1038) versus −0.2278 (−0.2789, −0.1522), P = 7E-21, Fig. 3 c]. And SFRP1 hypermethylation yielded an AUC of 0.947 (95% CI: 0.904–0.990) with a sensitivity of 88.4% and a specificity of 95.8%. Similarly, SFRP2 methylation in tumor tissues was significantly higher than that in paired adjacent tissues [the mean β value: 0.0267 (−0.1424, 0.1407) versus −0.3831 (−0.4006, −0.3693), P = 5E-24, Fig. 3 c]. And SFRP2 hypermethylation yielded an AUC of 0.914 (95% CI: 0.886–0.942) with a sensitivity of 87.8% and a specificity of 95.8%.
In addition, SFRP1 and SFRP2 methylation was negatively correlated with the mRNA expression displayed by TCGA data mining ( SFRP1 : r = −0.432, P = 3.682E-11; SFRP2 : r = −0.478, P = 1E-13, Fig. 4 a). Using the data of GEO database (GSE32323), we found that SFRP1 and SFRP2 expression in three CRC cell lines (COLO20, HCT116 and HT29) was increased after 5′-AZA-deoxycytidine treatment (Fig. 4 b). All the evidence indicated that SFRP1 and SFRP2 methylation might regulate gene expression.

Discussion
Despite of the improvement of technology, early diagnosis of CRC is still hindered for the lack of effective method. As the most common tumor marker, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA19–9) showed 33% sensitivity and 11% sensitivity at early stages of CRC patients, respectively [ , ]. In addition, the positive rate of fecal occult blood test (FOBT) in normal control group and CRC was 9.1% and 33.3%, respectively [ ]. In this study, the methylation levels of SFRP1 and SFRP2 in CRC tissues were found to be significantly higher than those in the adjacent non-tumor tissues. SFRP1 and SFRP2 hypermethylation was found in 56 out of 80 (70%) and 45 out of 80 (56%) CRC patients, respectively. Our findings provided candidate biomarkers for the diagnosis of CRC.
Altered DNA methylation patterns were considered as a screening method to diagnose cancer and predict tumor progression and prognosis which could be discovered by specific test methods in advance [ ]. There are some DNA hypermethylation genes, such as SLC5A8 , ITGA4 , SFRP2 , CDKN2A , HLTF , and MGMT , seeming to play a crucial role in colon carcinogenesis [ ]. SFPR1 and SFRP2 were reported to be useful in early detection or CRC [ ]. In the current study, SFRP1 methylation yielded an AUC of 0.669 (sensitivity: 60.0%; specificity: 70.0%) and SFRP2 methylation yielded an AUC of 0.555 (sensitivity: 38.8%; specificity: 77.5%) in CRC. Compared with CEA, CA19–9 and FOBT, SFRP1 and SFRP2 hypermethylation might sever as more sensitive biomarkers for CRC scanning. CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) status seems to be an emerging biomarker, which detected multiple genes methylation in CRC [ ]. Therefore, we could combine SFRP1 and SFRP2 hypermethylation with other specific biomarkers to create a new CIMP-based diagnostic panel.
Multiple levels of regulation were existed in the Wnt signaling pathway. The secreted frizzled-related protein (SFRP) family is one of the antagonists of two functional families controlling the activation of Wnt signaling [ ]. SFRP1 , encoding a tumor suppressor protein, acts as a modulator of the Wnt signaling pathway [ ]. SFRP1 could prevent the Wnt proteins from combining with the Fz receptors, and thus stop the initiation of signaling cascade [ ]. The suppressed SFRP1 could remarkably down-regulate p-β-catenin, and it will affect the proliferation and invasion in CRC cells [ ]. Similarly, SFRP2 was related to Wnt pathway and it was shown to accelerate cancer cell invasion and growth in tumor progression [ ]. In the current study, analyses of TCGA and GEO databases showed that SFRP1 and SFRP2 hypermethylation were inversely correlated with gene expression. Therefore, we speculated that SFRP1 and SFRP2 hypermethylation might be involved in carcinogenesis through silencing the tumor-suppressor genes through Wnt pathway.
There are some limitations in our study. We only obtained tumor tissues in the current study. The blood-based strategies have the advantages of minimally-invasiveness compared to endoscopie. However, only one blood-based biomarker, the circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) methylation biomarker Epi proColon30, has been approved by FDA with a sensitivity of 72.2% with a specificity of 80.8% [ ]. What’s more, Harada et al. suggested that DNA methylation of miR-124-3 , LOC386758 and SFRP1 in bowel lavage fluid (BLF) obtained during colonoscopy may be a promising biomarker for CRC (AUC = 0.834; sensitivity: 82%; specificity: 79%) [ ]. Thus, the diagnostic value of SFRP1 and SFRP2 hypermethylation in blood and BLF samples should be assessed in the future. In addition, future studies should be performed to explore the potential regulatory mechanism between DNA methylation and gene expression.
In summary, SFRP1 and SFRP2 hypermethylation might be useful diagnostic biomarkers for the detection of CRC. Further studies on the detailed mechanisms of SFRP1 and SFRP2 hypermethylation should be explored to elaborate their role in the carcinogenesis of CRC.
