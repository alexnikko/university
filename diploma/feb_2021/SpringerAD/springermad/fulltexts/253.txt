Introduction
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune connective tissue disease that affects approximately 20–150 per 100,000 adults in the United States (US), with a higher prevalence in women and non-white populations [ , , ]. SLE is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, driven by infectious, renal, and cardiovascular complications. Although the pathogenesis remains incompletely understood, systemic cardiovascular effects of SLE appear to be mediated by chronic inflammation, increased platelet activity, a hypercoagulable state, and vascular dysfunction [ , ].
Nearly 300 million non-cardiac surgeries are performed annually in the US. While perioperative cardiovascular events are on the decline, 3% of patients ≥ 45 years of age hospitalized for surgery still develop MI, stroke, or death in the perioperative period [ ]. However, data in surgical patients with SLE are limited and thus it remains unknown whether declining trends are also applicable to this population. Two prior studies noted that SLE was associated with an increased risk of adverse perioperative outcomes [ , ]. However, data were from surgeries performed in Taiwan or in the United States nearly two decades ago, cohorts of SLE patients undergoing surgery were relatively small, analyses excluded men, and did not investigate outcomes by age. Accordingly, this study was initiated to investigate the relationship between a diagnosis of SLE and adverse cardiovascular outcomes following major non-cardiac surgery in a large contemporary nationwide database from the United States.
Methods
Patients age ≥ 18 years requiring major non-cardiac surgery were identified from Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project’s National Inpatient Sample data from 2004 to 2014, using previously described methodology [ ]. Systemic lupus erythematosus was identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) diagnosis code 710.0. As described previously, perioperative major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were defined by death and ICD-9 diagnosis codes for acute myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke (Table 2 footnote). Multivariable logistic regression models were generated to estimate odds of perioperative events, adjusted for patient demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, and surgery type. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 20 (IBM SPSS Statistics, Armonk, NY). P values < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.
Results
From 2004 to 2014, a total of 17,853,194 hospitalizations for major non-cardiac surgery met study inclusion criteria and SLE was identified in 70,578 (0.40%). Patients with a diagnosis of SLE were younger, more likely to be female (90.3 vs. 64.7%, p < 0.001), black (20.1 vs. 9.6%, p < 0.001), more frequently had hypertension, end-stage renal disease, heart failure, and were less likely to have diabetes and hyperlipidemia than patients without SLE (Table 1 ). Patients with SLE were more likely to undergo vascular or orthopedic surgery, and were less likely to undergo surgery during an elective hospitalization than patients without SLE. Overall, patients with SLE had a higher frequency of perioperative MACE in comparison to patients without SLE (2.4 vs. 2.0%, p < 0.001) (Table 2 ). After multivariable adjustment, SLE remained associated with perioperative MACE overall [adjusted OR (aOR) 1.25; 95% CI 1.18–1.31] and in both women (aOR 1.29; 95% CI 1.22–2.37) and men (aOR 1.17; 95% CI 1.03–1.33). The frequency of MACE by age and sex is shown in Fig. 1 . Observed increases in perioperative MACE associated with SLE were largely driven by increased risk of death (aOR 1.58 95% CI 1.40–1.77) and myocardial infarction (aOR 1.32; 95% CI 1.05–1.66) in patients with SLE age < 50 years. The increased risk of perioperative MACE, death, and MI associated with SLE was attenuated in older patients (Table 2 ). No differences in perioperative acute ischemic stroke were identified in patients with and without SLE.

Discussion
In this analysis of patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery, men and women with SLE had higher risks of perioperative MACE and in-hospital mortality than those without SLE, with the greatest increases in risk observed in the youngest patients. The vast majority of SLE patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery were women, and in the subgroup of women age 18–49, MACE was approximately fivefold higher in patients with SLE in unadjusted analyses, with a 27% increase in risk of MACE associated with SLE after adjusting for clinical covariates. There was a higher frequency of MI among the younger patients age 18–49 (of both sexes) in the analysis, although confidence intervals of adjusted odds ratios for MI were wide in subgroups stratified by sex. The increased risk of perioperative MI and MACE associated with SLE observed in younger patients was attenuated in the older subgroup. This may be attributed to the competing risks of age-related cardiovascular disease in older cohorts, or a survival bias of SLE patients with less severe disease. SLE was not associated with a signal for increased perioperative stroke in this analysis, a surprising finding in light of the increased risk of arterial thrombosis in patients with SLE [ ].
There are several notable limitations of this study. Analyses were based on administrative coding data, which is subject to reporting bias and coding errors. It is unknown whether patients met either the American College of Rheumatology or SLE international cooperating clinics (SLICC) classifications [ , ]. Medical therapy, including immunosuppressive and antithrombotic regimens, were not available from this dataset, nor were levels of anti-phospholipid antibodies. Similarly, data on perioperative antiplatelet, anticoagulant, and statin use were not available. Causes of death could not be determined and may have been related to infectious complications. Finally, the sequence of cardiovascular complications following non-cardiac surgery cannot be firmly established from ICD-9 coding.
In conclusion, a diagnosis of SLE was associated with increased incidence of perioperative MACE and in-hospital mortality, particularly among younger women hospitalized for non-cardiac surgery. Mechanisms of death among SLE patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery are uncertain. Patients with SLE may require careful consideration during pre-operative cardiovascular risk assessment, and antithrombotic and lipid lowering therapies indicated for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease may be beneficial. Trials of medical therapy to improve the perioperative outcomes of young patients with SLE require further study.
