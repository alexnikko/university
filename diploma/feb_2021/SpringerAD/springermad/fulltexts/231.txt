Highlights
This review illustrates the high rates of bleeding events among patients with end-stage renal disease receiving the most commonly prescribed anticoagulants in this population, apixaban and warfarin, suggesting that the benefit of anticoagulation in this population may not outweigh the risk This review is the first to show the superiority of apixaban in comparison to warfarin in rates of major bleed in patients with end-stage renal disease receiving hemodialysis This review shows non-inferiority of apixaban in comparison to warfarin in rates of clinically-relevant non-major bleed and minor bleed in patients with end-stage renal disease, suggesting that apixaban and warfarin have similar safety profiles in this population Future research regarding the safety of anticoagulation in patients with end-stage renal disease should take into account different dosing regimens, interacting medications and comorbid conditions and should focus on novel anticoagulants whose clearance relies less on the kidneys than those currently available
The decision for chronic anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation or venous-thromboembolism must be carefully balanced with the increased risk of bleed associated with such therapy. This balance requires an even further risk versus benefit analysis in those with chronic kidney disease. This population is at an increased risk for bleed in addition to a paradoxical increased risk for the formation of thrombi [ , ]. Furthermore, overall bleeding risk increases as kidney function decreases [ , , , 7, ]. Patients classified as having end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have either an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, in mL/min, as estimated using the Cockcroft-Gault equation) < 15 mL/min or those receiving chronic hemodialysis (HD). It has been shown that those with ESRD have a 20% increased risk of bleed while receiving anticoagulation [ , ]. Patients with advanced kidney disease (AKD, eGFR < 25 mL/min) have been excluded from all large-scale, randomized controlled trials involving anticoagulation due to such safety concerns [ , ]. Therefore, a need to analyze risk versus benefit in anticoagulation utilization among those with AKD exists. Controversy regarding the appropriateness of anticoagulant therapy and its use is prevalent among clinicians [ ].
Chronic anticoagulation options for patients with AKD include warfarin, a Vitamin K antagonist (VKA), and apixaban (Eliquis™, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, New Jersey, USA), a direct Factor Xa inhibitor. Until 2014, warfarin was the sole anticoagulant recommended for patients with AKD. Apixaban gained FDA approval in 2014 for its use in this population based on small-sample size, single dose pharmacokinetic (PK) data [ ]. Warfarin continues to dominate as the treatment of choice among such patients, although the utilization of apixaban has been steadily increasing [ , ].
This review opens with the known risks and benefits of warfarin and apixaban in patients with AKD. It then goes on to review existing apixaban PK data while discussing the implications and controversies surrounding the application of this data to real-life clinical practice. Lastly, clinical trials with primary outcomes including the safety of apixaban in patients with AKD or those directly comparing the safety of apixaban versus warfarin are reviewed. Using statistical analysis (a comparison of proportions) the data found in these studies were combined to better understand the safety of apixaban versus warfarin in those with AKD. All articles utilized in this review were located within PubMed, Cochrane and Embase databases. Search terms included apixaban, warfarin, anticoagulation, end-stage renal disease, kidney disease and renal insufficiency.
Anticoagulation in AKD
Benefits associated with warfarin
Clinical familiarity of warfarin in patients with AKD partially explains its prominent use in this population. Dose adjustment using the international normalized ratio (INR) seeks to maintain a narrow therapeutic index that balances effectiveness and safety. Reversal strategies are readily available if substantial supratherapeutic INR values or substantial bleeding are encountered. In addition, warfarin is considered a relatively safe option in renal insufficiency due to its predominant hepatic clearance. Bioaccumulation is theoretically reduced in patients with poor renal function [ ]. Interestingly, there has never been a large scale, randomized controlled trial that evaluates the safety of warfarin in patients with AKD [ ]. In a systematic review, mortality was reduced in 5 out of 7 studies analyzing the effect of warfarin in extending the lifespan of dialysis patients [ ]. Despite other available anticoagulants, warfarin use in AKD remains the recommended agent by the American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology and the Heart Rhythm Society [ ].
Risks associated with warfarin
It has been shown that patients with ESRD often have sub-therapeutic INR levels due to conservative dosing attributed to concerns over increased bleeding risk and safety [ ]. Metabolic variance exists within the general population which creates differences in response to warfarin in patients with or without renal failure [ ]. This effect is magnified in patients with ESRD which could lead to an increase in adverse events [ ]. Matrix G1a proteins (MGPs) are vitamin-K dependent enzymes whose activity is diminished by the presence of warfarin. Inherent MGP activity against vascular mineralization is lessened by warfarin leading to an increased risk for calciphylaxis and arteriovenous malformations in the brain which may lead to an increased risk for intracerebral hemorrhage [ , , ]. In those requiring HD, warfarin seems to not only extend the time it takes for an arteriovenous fistula or graft (AVF/AVG) to mature but also decreases the lifespan of access [ ]. Access thrombosis is a common complication during HD therapy. When clotting occurs in patients on warfarin, inpatient hospitalization is required for heparin bridging thus increasing patient burden and costs [ ]. A systematic review done by Brancaccio et al. showed that VKA therapy is unlikely to provide any benefit in regards to thromboembolic prevention in patients with ESRD. It also revealed an increased risk for bleeding [ ].
Benefits of apixaban
Compared with other direct oral anticoagulants, apixaban relies the least on renal clearance. It therefore has an enhanced safety profile in patients with renal insufficiency [ ]. 27% of apixaban is cleared renally with most elimination occurring via the hepatic route and to a lesser extent on fecal elimination [ , ]. In a small study looking at 16 patients with warfarin-induced calciphylaxis, apixaban was shown to be a safe option in those with ESRD. No bleeding events occurred and a majority of patients either had complete resolution or improvement of calciphylaxis [ ]. A meta-analysis by Pathak et al. revealed that the risk of bleeding in those with mild kidney disease was significantly less with apixaban when compared to warfarin and similarily to warfarin in patients with more severe disease [ ]. This meta-analysis, however, did not evaluate patients with ESRD or those receiving chronic HD [ ].
The pharmacokinetics of apixaban and the FDA’s approval of its use in ESRD
Apixaban has two dosing regimens for long-term use, 5 mg twice daily is the standard dose. A lower dose of 2.5 mg twice daily is indicated for patients with two or more of the following criteria—greater than 80 years old, less than 60 kg in body weight or a serum creatinine of greater than 1.5 [ , ]. Note that renal insufficiency alone does not warrant the use of the lower dosing.
The decision by the FDA to approve the standard 5 mg dose of apixaban twice daily in patients with AKD was based on its apparent safety shown in small sample, single dose PK studies [ , ]. In Wang et al. a single dose of 5 mg was administered to eight patients with ESRD while the control group consisted of 8 patients with normal kidney function who also received a single 5 mg dose [ ]. PK data was obtained and analyzed for both groups [ ]. A similar study by Chang et al. evaluated PK data following a single 5 mg dose given to seven patients with an eGFR < 30 [ ]. In both of these studies, PK analysis revealed little difference in the time it took the drug to reach peak plasma concentration (T max ), total peak plasma concentration (C max ) and drug half-life (t 1/2 ) when compared to healthy controls (Table 1 ). In addition, there were no incidents of major bleed or death in either group [ , ]. Despite these findings, total exposure to apixaban as represented by area under the curve (AUC) was increased by roughly 40% in the ESRD group when compared to healthy controls in both studies [ , ] (Table 1 ).

It has been proposed that HD in itself does not play a major role in removing apixaban from circulation due to it being primarily protein-bound in plasma [ ]. This was supported by the study design of Wang et al. Initially, all eight patients with ESRD were treated with apixaban 5 mg 2 h prior to HD. After a washout period of 7 days elapsed, five of these patients received a second 5 mg dose immediately following a HD session. There was little change in PK parameters before or after HD [ ] (Table 1 ). It was thus determined the timing of apixaban administration does not need to coincide with the timing of HD.
Clinical concern arose following the FDA’s approval for several reasons. The single-dose nature of these studies did not consider the effect of possible bioaccumulation that may occur once steady state is reached [ , , ]. It is known that a steady state of any drug is not achieved until 4–5 half-lives have elapsed. For apixaban, this equates to roughly 48 h of continuous dosing [ ]. In addition, the 40% increase in AUC (total exposure to the drug) following a single 5 mg dose raised concerns regarding safety [ , ].
To study the effect of bioaccumulation once steady state is reached, Mavrakanas et al. examined PK data in seven ESRD patients receiving the lower 2.5 mg twice daily dose for 8 days. Following this, five of these same patients received the standard 5 mg twice daily dose for 8 days following a washout period [ ]. Mavrakanas et al. compared the PK data achieved among both groups with data determined to be therapeutic based on the findings of the landmark randomized controlled trial, ARISTOTLE, that compared safety and effectiveness between warfarin and apixaban in those without AKD [ , ]. It was found that the lower 2.5 mg dosing regimen resulted in therapeutic plasma concentrations at steady state while the higher 5 mg dosing regimen led to supra-therapeutic levels [ ]. Significant increases in C max and t 1/2 were also seen once steady state was reached in both dosing regimens (Table 1 ).
The decision to use apixaban in patients with AKD and to follow the FDA labelled 5 mg dosing regimen instead of the lower 2.5 mg regimen remains an area of debate among clinicians. In one small-sample retrospective study, ESRD patients receiving the standard 5 mg dose did not experience a major bleeding event after several months of follow-up [ ]. On the other hand, a case study of a patient receiving the lower 2.5 mg dose experienced a gastrointestinal bleed 7 days into treatment [ ]. Until more robust clinical trials are performed, controversy is likely to continue.
Analysis of the safety of apixaban versus warfarin in patients with AKD in clinical practice
Five retrospective cohort studies were found that analyzed the safety of apixaban in real-life clinical practice, three of which compared safety outcomes head-to-head with warfarin [ , , ]. All used bleeding definitions based on the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH), ‘major bleed’ is defined as overt bleeding plus at least 1 of the following—decrease in hemoglobin of greater than 2 units, transfusion of greater than 2 units of red blood cells or bleeding involving at least 1 critical site (intracranial, intraspinal, intraocular, pericardial, intra-articular, intramuscular with compartment syndrome) or bleeding resulting in death. ‘Clinically relevant non-major bleeding (CRNMB)’ is defined by the ISTH as bleeding which compromises hemodynamics or leads to hospitalization, unexpected hematoma or excessive wound hematoma, epistaxis, gingival bleeding, hemoptysis, hematuria, gastrointestinal bleed or any other bleeding event requiring medical intervention. ‘Minor bleeding’ is a bleeding event not defined by either major-bleed or CRNMB criteria [ , , , ].
The main objective of the studies conducted by Sarratt et al., Stanton et al. and Reed et al. were comparing bleeding rates in warfarin versus apixaban in patients with renal insufficiency [ , , ]. Sarratt et al. and Reed et al. limited their population to patients with ESRD on chronic HD [ , ]. Stanton et al. included all patients with an eGFR < 25 including those with ESRD on HD [ ]. While these studies looked at the proportion of patients receiving the 2.5 versus 5 mg twice daily dose, none compared these dosing regimens head-to-head in terms of bleeding events [ , , ]. Overall, for all three studies, 45% of all patients were prescribed the lower 2.5 mg dosing regimen whereas 55% were prescribed the FDA-recommended higher dosing regimen of 5 mg [ , , ]. Both dosing regimens are prescribed almost equally, highlighting the uncertainty that exists in which dosing regimen is more favorable. When comparing safety, none of these retrospective cohort studies found a substantial difference between bleeding events in those on warfarin versus those on apixaban [ , , ] (Table 2 ).

A study conducted by Steuber et al. and one conducted by King et al. analyzed apixaban alone with no warfarin comparison group [ , ]. The retrospective multicenter cohort study by Steuber et al. included ESRD patients on HD receiving apixaban. While one objective of the study was determining bleeding rates based on ISTH criteria, the primary goal of this study was in identifying risk factors for bleeding in HD patients receiving apixaban [ ]. This study was the only study found that directly compared bleeding rates based on different dosing regimens [ ]. Although the sample size was small, safety did favor the lower 2.5 mg dosing. The majority of all bleeding events, roughly 59%, occurred among patients receiving the higher 5 mg dosing regimen [ ]. In King et al., the primary objective was to analyze the response to apixaban in patients who experienced warfarin-induced calciphyalxis. A secondary objective was to determine bleeding rates. This study only included patients receiving the 5 mg dosing regimen and although the sample size was small, there were no bleeding events documented throughout several months of follow-up [ ].
Cumulative data from all five studies were compiled and total ISTH defined bleeding rates were determined in this review. Due to the different study designs, two separate patient populations were analyzed; those with AKD, including those with ESRD on HD and those with ESRD on HD alone (Table 2 ). Due to different sample sizes among the studies, a comparison of proportions was calculated for each type of bleed using the GraphPad QuickCalcs Web site: http://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs . All raw data can be seen in Table 2 . All data was plotted on forest graphs (Figs. 1 , 2 ).

In patients with ESRD on HD, there existed a difference of 5.93% in major bleeding events between patients receiving apixaban versus those receiving warfarin (4.66 vs 10.59%, CI − 0.78 to 11.82, p = 0.02). For CRNMB, the difference in events was 2.21% (7.20 vs 9.41%, CI − 3.15 to 8.16, p = 0.42). For minor bleed, the difference in events was 2.11% (3.81 vs 1.70%, CI − 1.62 to 5.57, p = 0.21). When combining all types of bleeds for this population, a difference in events of 6.67% was observed (15.68 vs 22.35%, CI − 0.97 to 14.63, p = 0.09). This data highlights two important points. First, the high rates of bleeding events occurring among patients with ESRD on HD receiving anticoagulation was demonstrated. Second, the safety of apixaban when compared to warfarin in rates of major bleeding reached clinical significance. To our knowledge, this is the first publication to reveal superiority of apixaban over warfarin in terms of a safety event. When combined, this data reveals that apixaban can be considered non-inferior to warfarin in terms of bleeding risk in patients with ESRD on HD (Fig. 1 ).
In all patients with AKD, there existed a difference of 4.4% in major bleeding events between patients receiving apixaban versus those receiving warfarin (5.96 vs 10.36%, CI − 0.78 to 10.02, p = 0.09). For CRNMB, the difference in events was 0.71% (7.66 vs 6.74%, CI 4.31–5.88, p = 0.72). For minor bleed, the difference in events was 0.38% (2.98 vs 2.60%, CI − 3.29 to 3.76, p = 0.81). When combining all types of bleeds for this population, a difference in events of 3.09% was observed (16.60 vs 19.69%, 95% CI − 4.18 to 10.56, p = 0.68). Again, this data reveals the increased bleeding risk in patients with AKD receiving anticoagulation. Although not reaching levels of statistical significance, a review of the proportions and the corresponding forest plot in this population does suggest that apixaban may be superior to warfarin in terms of safety among patients with AKD. At the very least, it demonstrates the non-inferiority of apixaban when compared to warfarin in terms of safety in this population (Fig. 2 ).
Discussion and conclusion
Anticoagulation in patients with AKD is an area of great controversy and large-scale, randomized controlled trials are ultimately needed to determine the safety of anticoagulation in this population. Such studies might support the safety suggested by limited PK data. These studies should consider different apixaban dosing regimens and their effect on overall safety. They should also consider the safety effects of adding other interacting medications such as antiplatelet agents and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) and comorbid conditions including hepatic disease and thrombocytopenia. The high rate of bleeding seen in this review and in many other studies looking at patients with AKD on anticoagulation brings risk versus benefit analysis into question. The risk of bleeding may outweigh the benefit of preventing thromboembolism in this population and may suggest that any anticoagulant may be contraindicated in this population for chronic use. In a survey asking clinicians whether warfarin should be used in dialysis patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, 45.1% of respondents answered ‘no’ [ ]. Whether anticoagulation should be used at all in patients with AKD needs to be investigated further in larger-scale studies.
Our review supports the results of similar studies that conclude with apixaban being a viable, safe alternative to warfarin therapy in patients with AKD, including those with ESRD on HD. Current research regarding laboratory values to assess therapeutic levels of apixaban, the most promising being chromogenic anti-FXa assays, is underway [ , , , ]. This would be the equivalent to INR testing in warfarin patients. Reversal agents for Factor Xa inhibitors, such as andexanet and Ciraparantag, are currently being investigated in clinical trials [ ]. As these new developments evolve, clinicians may become more comfortable in using apixaban and similar agents in patients with AKD as alternatives to warfarin. The newly released Factor Xa inhibitor betrixaban (Bevyxxa™, Portola Pharmaceuticals, South San Francisco, CA) depends on the kidneys for elimination by only 5–7%, enhancing its potential for use among patients with AKD [ , ]. Whether alternatives like betrixaban prove to be safer than warfarin in AKD remains an open area of research and ongoing inquiry.
