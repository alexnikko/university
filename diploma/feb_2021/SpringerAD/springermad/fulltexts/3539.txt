Background
The incidence of cancer worldwide is steadily increasing. For instance, in Jordan, around 5000 new cancer cases are diagnosed every year [ , ]. Although the higher incidence of cancer is in developed countries, 70% of cancer-related deaths occur in developing countries [ ]. In this context, 14% of deaths in Jordan are related to cancer [ ].
Cancer is a genetic disease that results from multiple cell mutations [ ]. Accumulated mutations beside the activation of the oncogene and inactivation of tumour suppressor genes lead to the development of cancer. The interaction between inherited mutated genes and environmental factors also causes cancer [ ]. Based on this fact, theoretically, modifying some dietary and lifestyle habits could minimize, or at least reduce, the risk of cancer [ ]. Recent reports show that of the seven million annual cancer-related deaths worldwide, 35% are due to modifiable factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, low fruit and vegetable intake, and a high-fat diet [ , ]. Economically, cancer prevention and early detection measures would significantly reduce the cost of total medical care provided for cancer patients [ , , ]. For example, it is estimated that the cancer-related mortality rate decreased by 17% between the years 1990 and 2001; this considerable reduction was attributed to the decrease in the exposure to cancer risk factors, screening campaigns, and the increased awareness of cancer prevention principles and practices (i.e. lifestyle modifications, nutrition, and physical activity) [ ]. Hence, it might be useful for developing countries, such as Jordan, to implement early cancer prevention measures to reduce the burden on financial resources and decrease the number of cancer-attributed deaths. One of the most important preventive measures is increasing awareness of cancer warning signs.
About 27% of cancer patients in Jordan are diagnosed at an advanced stage [ ], resulting in poor prognosis and survival rates. The possible causes of late presentation might be lack of awareness of warning signs of cancer or a delay in referral from primary healthcare settings [ ]. More specifically, the delay in cancer detection is caused by factors related to patients, doctors, and the healthcare system [ ]. The Department of Health in the UK acknowledged that these factors need to be fully investigated to improve early detection of cancer and treatment outcomes. In response to this call, a national survey was conducted in the UK to measure public awareness of warning signs of cancer and perceived barriers to seeking medical care [ ]. Two thousand two hundred sixteen participants were interviewed using the Cancer Awareness Measure questionnaire [ ]. The results showed that participants had a low level of awareness of signs of cancer. Also, the logistic regression analysis showed that male, younger, low economic status, and being a member of ethnic minorities predicted a lower level of awareness. Further, the top-rated barriers to seeking medical advice were difficulty in making an appointment, worry about wasting the doctor’s time, and worry about what would be found [ ]. Four years later, another study compared the level of cancer awareness across a group of western countries (Australia, Canada, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and the UK); a total number of 19,079 participants were recruited [ ]. A high level of awareness was reported in all of these countries. However, the increased awareness of cancer risk with age was low in the UK (14%), Canada (13%), and Australia (16%). Differences in the reported barriers to seeking medical care were also found in these countries; for example, 15% of the UK participants reported that embarrassment would put them off going to the doctor, compared to only 6% in Denmark. Being too busy to go to the doctor was the major barrier in Canada [ ].
In the context of Arab-Islamic culture, a study in the United Arab Emirates investigated the awareness and knowledge of women about breast cancer [ ]. These authors surveyed 247 women using the CAM (Cancer Awareness Measure) questionnaire. It was found that most of the women lacked knowledge about the warning signs of breast cancer. For instance, half of them were unaware of the national breast cancer screening programme. In addition, they did not recognize that having a lump in the breast was a serious sign that needed to be further examined by a doctor [ ]. About 38% of women reported not doing breast self-examination for fear of what they might find. Recent studies in Australia [ ], Denmark [ ], Iran [ ], Malaysia [ ], Saudi Arabia [ ], and the UK [ ] consistently reported a low level of awareness and knowledge of the warning signs for all types of cancer. Interestingly, 15 to 17% of Australian women were unaware of some major signs of breast cancer (i.e. having a dimple or change in breast shape) [ ]. In the Malaysian study, 38% of the participants reported zero knowledge of cancer warning signs [ ]. In this context, two thirds of the participants in the Saudi study reported never to have heard of alarming signs of cancer [ ]. However, in Jordan, no similar study has explored this important issue.
Such a study takes on extra importance in the developing countries (i.e. Jordan), because the incidence of cancer is increasing and most newly diagnosed cases are found at advanced stages. For example, cancer is the third most likely cause of death in Jordan [ ]. In addition, the burden and cost are increasing with time. The WHO confirmed that improving and measuring public awareness of cancer enhance the prevention that remains the mainstay to reduce the spread of cancer and limit its consequences [ ]. Thus, the purpose of this study was to identify the level of awareness of cancer’s warning signs and the barriers to seeking medical advice among the Jordanian public.
Methods
Aims
This study aims to answer the following research questions: 1. Are Jordanians aware of the warning signs of cancer? 2. Is the Jordanian public aware of the risk factors of cancer? 3. What are the perceived barriers to seeking medical help?
Design
A descriptive cross-sectional survey design was used.
Sample
This study includes 2292 Jordanian participants who are older than 18 years and willing to take part in the study.
Sample Size
The required sample size depended critically on the percentage of responses to the CAM. For a percentage of 50%, given that the number of Jordanians older than 18 years old is about four million [ ], complete data from 2400 participants would be needed. From http://www.raosoft.com/samplesize.html , this would allow the percentage of correct answers to be estimated with a 95% confidence interval and margin of error of at most ±2%. The number of participants recruited from each governorate was proportional to the number of population in that governorate [ ].
Setting
This is a national study covering the whole country: central, northern, and southern areas. Participants were recruited from public places such as city centre markets and large malls.
Instrument
The CAM [ ] was used, as the only known validated tool in this field [ ]. It has good internal reliability (Cronbach α = 0.77) and test-retest reliability ( r = 0.81). It asked about awareness of cancer symptoms (one open question and ten items), anticipated delay (one closed question), and barriers to help seeking (ten closed questions). The awareness sub-scale starts with the open question asking the subject to list whatever he/she knows of cancer warning signs. Ten items with (yes/no) answers are then listed. Anticipated delay is evaluated by a closed question with two categories: low (<2 weeks) and high (>2 weeks) anticipated delay. Finally, the 11 items about barriers to help seeking (yes/no) include four emotional barriers, three practical barriers, and three service barriers; we added one further barrier “No medical insurance to cover the cost”. Permission to use the tool was obtained and it was translated into Arabic. Information about participants’ demographic characteristics, such as sex, age, marital status, economic status, and education, was also collected.
Procedure
The researcher first obtained the required ethical approval from the appropriate authority. Research assistants were trained on completing the questionnaire before visiting public places and malls in each governorate, where people from both villages and city neighbourhoods gather. The study’s purpose, procedure, and requirements were explained to the participants, who then signed a consent form and completed the questionnaire in the presence of the research assistant, who provided help if needed.
Data Analysis
Data was entered into SPSS (Release 17). Descriptive statistics were estimated using means, frequency, percentages, and 95% confidence intervals for percentages across the entire sample and for key sub-groups. The statistical differences between two variables (yes/no) were analysed using two-group tests such as chi-squared test for nominal variables and independent t test. Further, to compare the variable mean between three or more groups, the one-way ANOVA was used.
Results
Of the 2400 persons invited to participate, 2292 (95.5%) agreed to complete the questionnaire, 64 (2.7%) refused to participate, and 44 (1.8%) questionnaires were not completed appropriately and were excluded. Of the 2292 participants, 1206 were female with a mean age of 30.5 (SD 11.3) years, ranging from 18 to 81. See Table 1 for the detailed demographic characteristics of the participants. Table 1 Sample demographics Variable Frequency (%) Gender Male 1206 (52.6) Female 1073 (46.8) Missing 13 (0.6) Marital status Married 1108 (48.3) Not married 1169 (51.0) Missing 15 (0.7) Working status Working 1013 (44.2) Not working 1247 (54.4) Missing 32 (1.4) Education level Low education (≤secondary school) 892 (38.9) High education (≥diploma) 1377 (60.1) Missing 23 (1.0) Family monthly income (US$) Low (<$845) 1646 (71.8) High (≥$845) 320 (14.0) Missing 326 (14.2) Living region Central 1457 (63.5) Northern 627 (27.4) Southern 208 (9.1)
None of the participants was able to correctly identify the first (colorectal cancer), second (lung cancer), and third (prostate cancer) most common cancers among Jordanian males. Seventy-four per cent were able to identify the first (breast cancer) but not the second (colorectal cancer) and third (lymphoma) most common cancers among Jordanian females. The result of chi-squared tests showed that high education level ( χ 2 = 4.84, df = 1, p = .28) and having a first-degree relative with cancer ( χ 2 = 8.31, df = 1, p = .005) were significantly associated with the recognition of the first most common cancer among women in Jordan. However, participants’ gender, living area, family monthly income, and working status were found to be not associated with the knowledge of the most common cancer among women ( p > .05).
Recall and Recognition of Cancer Warning Symptoms
Recall (open question) was not good for all warning symptoms; the percentage of participants who correctly recalled one of the nine symptoms ranged from 1.7 to 22.9%; see Table 2 . The mean of the total number of warning symptoms recalled was very low at 0.7 (SD 1.1). Classic tumour symptoms of lump/swelling (22.9%), weight loss (17%), and bleeding (6.7%) were the most frequently recalled symptoms. Table 2 Frequency and percentage of participants’ knowledge of cancer warning symptoms Symptom Recognition Recall Yes Yes Frequency % Frequency % 1. Unexplained lump or swelling 1778 77.6 524 22.9 2. Persistent unexplained pain 1066 46.5 117 5.1 3. Unexplained bleeding 1118 48.8 153 6.7 4. Persistent cough or hoarseness 1020 44.5 108 4.7 5.

Sore that does not heal 1126 49.1 38 1.7 9. Unexplained weight loss 1444 63.0 390 17
Recognition (selection from the given symptoms) resulted in higher percentages of correct answers (see Table 2 ) and the number of identified warning symptoms. The mean of the total number of recognized symptoms was also low 4.7 (SD 2.4). The highest recognition percentages were as follows: lump/swelling (77.6%), weight loss (63%), and change in appearance of a mole (61.1%). As presented in Table 2 , other important warning symptoms were only recognized by 50% or less of the participants. There was no significant difference in the mean of the total number of recognized symptoms regarding the participants’ gender, education level, working status, and having a first-degree relative with cancer as evident by the results of the independent t test ( p > .05). In addition, the one-way ANOVA showed no significant difference in the mean of the total number of recognized symptoms and living area ( F = 0.41, df = 2 and 2235, p = .665).
Barriers and Anticipated Delay to Seeking Medical Care
The most commonly reported barriers were the following: worried about what the doctor might find (70.5%), being too scared (68.6%), and too busy (48.4%); see Table 3 . The highest reported number of barriers was the emotional barriers (mean = 2.7 SD 1.3); see Table 3 . Table 3 Perceived barriers to seeking medical care Mean (SD) Yes Frequency % Emotional barriers 2.7 (1.3) Worried about what doctor might find 1616 70.5 Too scared 1572 86.6 Too embarrassed 872 38.0 Not confident to talk about symptoms 969 42.3 Practical Barriers 1.1(1.0) Too busy 1110 48.4 Other things to worry about 788 34.4 Difficult to arrange transport 670 29.2 Service barriers 1.3 (1.1) Difficult to make appointment 833 63.7 Worried about wasting doctor’s time 457 19.9 Difficult to talk to doctor 685 29.9 No medical insurance to cover the cost 969 42.3
The majority of participants (65.7%) reported that they would seek medical help within 2 weeks of identifying a warning symptom. Chi-squared test showed no significant differences in the duration of waiting time between participants in regard to their gender, educational level, working status, marital status, or region of the country ( p > .05). The independent t test showed that participants who would like to seek medical care within 2 weeks tended to know higher mean number of warning symptoms (mean = 4.94 SD 2.4) ( t = −4.01, df = 1490.5, 95% CI = −0.635 to −0.214, p < .001) and lower mean number of barriers (mean = 4.31 SD 2.6) ( t = 4.45, df = 1482.6, 95% CI = 0.286 to 0.748, p < .001) than participants who would like to wait for 2 weeks or more to seek medical care (mean = 4.52 SD 2.3, mean = 4.83 SD 2.54, respectively) but not for the total number of recognized risk factors where no significant difference in the mean was noted ( p > .05). Further testing with the independent t test showed that working participants (mean = 4.29 SD 2.7) reported significantly lower total barrier score than non-working (mean = 4.63 SD 2.5) participants ( t = 2.96, df = 2120.3, 95% CI = 0.111 to 0.551, p = .003). However, there was no significant difference in the mean of the total barrier score in regard to gender, education level, family monthly income, and marital status ( p > .05). Furthermore, the one-way ANOVA showed significant difference in the mean of the total barrier score and living area ( F = 11.7, df = 2 and 2235, p < .001). Post hoc analysis showed that this difference was between participant living in central (mean = 4.25) and northern (mean = 4.79) areas and between central and southern areas (mean = 4.96).
Awareness Level of Cancer Risk Factors
With regard to recognizing risk factors, the most commonly known was being a smoker (81.4%), followed by drinking more than one unit of alcohol a day (74.8%), and exposure to another person’s cigarette smoke (63.3%) (see Table 4 ). The mean of the total number of risk factors identified was also low at 4.6 (SD 2.5) out of 11 (the maximum mean score). The rest of the risk factors were identified by ≤46.9% of the participants. Most participants (62.6%) believed that there is no relation between the occurrence of cancer and age. No significant differences in the mean of total recognized risk factors and the participants’ characteristics were found ( p > .05).

Discussion
This survey examined the Jordanian public’s awareness of cancer warning symptoms, risk factors, and barriers to seeking medical care. It considered one of the first documented efforts in exploring this highly important issue and promoting primary cancer prevention strategies in Jordan.
The results demonstrated that the Jordanian public had a very low level of awareness regarding cancer warning symptoms. On average, they were able to recall less than one symptom and recognize about 4.5 symptoms from the nine given in the questionnaire. This level is lower than that reported in studies conducted in developed countries [ , , , ]. However, in developing countries, a low awareness level of cancer symptoms has been consistently reported [ , ]. This result can be explained by the absence of national educational programmes or awareness campaigns about cancer prevention in Jordan. In the last decade, most of the cancer awareness programmes were devoted to breast cancer and disregarded other types of cancer. Education remains one of the most effective strategies to promote public awareness of cancer, but no agreement on the best and most cost-effective method of education has yet been reached [ ]. Hence, the results of this study should be considered as baseline data for prospective trials testing the efficacy of various educational interventions and awareness campaign to promote cancer awareness; as such, they are highly recommended.
In addition, the results show that Jordanians were not aware of the most common risk factors for cancer. The most commonly identified risk factors were being a smoker and drinking excess alcohol. This result is in accord with previous reports [ , ]. However, the most worrying issue is that most of the participants were not aware of diet and lifestyle risk factors such as low fruit intake, eating red meat, low physical activity, and advanced age. These results confirm the need for a comprehensive education programme to increase awareness of cancer risk factors. For example, sessions on cancer prevention could be included in biology classes for secondary school students, with others at university level. Given that the documented percentage of smoking among Jordanians is high [ , ], interventions to reduce the number of smokers, encourage current smokers to quit, and protect non-smokers from smoking harm should be developed. Such interventions should be designed based on models for changing behaviours and theories to maximize their benefits. Also, they should target all age groups within the Jordanian public, but paying particular attention to the young.
The Jordanian public identified a moderate level of barriers to seeking medical care, mostly emotional. However, most participants would seek medical care within 2 weeks if they noticed a warning symptom. Previous studies indicated that most reported barriers were likely to be practical and emotional [ , , ]. In our study, practical barriers were less indicated, and this might be because of the availability and easy access of healthcare services. Emotional barriers might be correlated with the belief that cancer literally means death, supported by the high mortality rate among Jordanian cancer patients [ ]. The public should be aware that early diagnosis of cancer would improve survival rates and prognosis. This could be achieved through the above-recommended educational courses. According to the study results, educational awareness campaigns should be designed to provide comprehensive information about cancer alarming symptoms and risk factors. Also, it should address the possible barriers to seeking medical care as well as informing public about available resources that would provide them help when needed. Based on the results, it is recommended that extra attention should be given to Jordanian with low education level, non-working, and living in the northern and southern regions of the country. These sub-groups seem to be underserved and have special needs for such intervention. The best methods of education need to be carefully considered to meet their needs; for example, face-to-face lectures with simple language may serve the goal. However, such method needs to be tested for its efficacy, cost-effectiveness, and feasibility.
This survey has its strengths and limitations. It was a population-based survey with a relatively high response rate (95.5%). This enhanced its representativeness, although generalization to the Jordanian public as a whole cannot be assumed. In addition, in this survey, we used a valid and reliable measurement tool which improved the study’s internal validity. However, the uses of a semi-structured interview with pre-prepared answers might limit participants’ ability to express answers that are not listed, or to overestimate some answers.
Conclusions
Overall, this study demonstrated that there is a low level of awareness on cancer symptoms and risk factors. This indicates room for improvement through using applicable and effective intervention. In particular, education remains the mainstay for such improvement. In addition, addressing emotional barriers to seeking medical care through behaviour-changing models should be considered when designing national awareness programmes.
