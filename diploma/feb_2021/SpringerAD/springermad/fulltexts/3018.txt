Introduction
Irinotecan hydrochloride is a topoisomerase I inhibitor that is used worldwide as a treatment for many solid tumors, including metastatic colorectal cancer [ ]. However, this anticancer drug can cause severe, potentially fatal toxicities such as neutropenia and/or delayed diarrhea [ , , , , ].
Irinotecan is a prodrug that is extensively metabolized in the liver to produce the active metabolite 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38) by carboxylesterase, and is then conjugated predominantly by liver UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 to form inactive SN-38 glucuronide (SN-38G) [ ]. The UGT1A1 * 28 and * 6 polymorphisms in the UGT1A1 gene can decrease the expression of the UGT1A1 enzyme and reduce its catalytic activity, respectively, resulting in significantly decreased conversion of SN-38 to SN-38G. Therefore, patients who carry the UGT1A1 * 6 /* 6 , * 28 /* 28 , or * 6 /* 28 genotypes show severe irinotecan-induced neutropenia, in contrast to those carrying UGT1A1 * 1 /* 1 , * 1 /* 6 , or * 1 /* 28 [ , , , ]. In addition to severe neutropenia and/or delayed diarrhea [ , , , , ], ‘cholinergic syndrome’, is another acute adverse event that is frequently observed after commencing irinotecan treatment.
Symptoms of cholinergic syndrome include abdominal pain, bradycardia, diarrhea, lacrimation, sweating, and/or nasal discharge; these conditions often lower the patients’ quality of life (QOL) [ , , , ]. Miya et al. [ ] reported a patient with recurrent colorectal cancer who experienced repeated bradycardia after irinotecan treatment, and recommended careful monitoring for cholinergic syndrome manifestations such as bradycardia as well as severe hematologic toxicity and/or diarrhea during irinotecan-containing chemotherapy. Fujii et al. [ ] recently reported a significant association between the occurrence of irinotecan-related cholinergic syndrome and improved overall survival in patients with colorectal cancer. Irinotecan-induced cholinergic syndrome also tended to show a positive correlation with progression-free survival. Nonetheless, there have been few investigations to identify the risk factors for the development of irinotecan-induced cholinergic syndrome.
Among Western patients, the incidence of irinotecan-induced cholinergic syndrome is higher in patients administered irinotecan doses of 250–350 mg/m 2 than in those administered 150 mg/m 2 [ , , , ]. On the other hand, the effects of irinotecan dose on the incidence and/or severity of cholinergic syndrome among Japanese patients remains unclear. Irinotecan is frequently administered to cancer patients as a combination therapy with other cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), cisplatin, and oxaliplatin [ , , , ]. Furthermore, molecularly targeted drugs including aflibercept beta, bevacizumab, cetuximab, panitumumab, and ramucirumab have simultaneously been administered to patients with irinotecan-containing chemotherapy [ , , , , ]. However, the combinatorial effects of chemotherapeutic agents and/or molecularly targeted drugs on irinotecan-induced cholinergic syndrome remain unclear, and the risk factors for irinotecan-related cholinergic syndrome have not been fully identified to date.
Based on this background, we retrospectively examined the clinical factors related to the onset and incidence of irinotecan-related cholinergic syndrome in patients with cancer who received irinotecan-containing regimens via their medical records.
Patients and methods
Study design
This retrospective study was performed at Showa University Hospital. All Japanese patients with cancer who received their first cycle of an irinotecan-based regimen between April 2014 and June 2018 were included in this investigation to identify the clinical factors associated with irinotecan-related cholinergic syndrome. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Showa University (Approval Number 2181).
Patients
All patients, who were managed by medical oncologists at our department, were 20 years or older, had histologically confirmed solid tumors, and were genotyped for UGT1A1 * 6 and * 28 . These patients were administered irinotecan monotherapy or a combination of irinotecan and other cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents. Some, but not all patients were also administered a molecularly targeted drug. Patients who had previously received any irinotecan-containing chemotherapy or had been started on any irinotecan-containing chemotherapy regimen in any other hospital were excluded.
Chemotherapeutic regimens containing irinotecan
The irinotecan-containing regimens administered to patients were as follows: (1) One cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent, irinotecan monotherapy involving irinotecan hydrochloride at a dose of 100 mg/m 2 as a 90 min intravenous (i.v.) infusion on days 1, 8, and 15 repeated every 4 weeks [ ], or irinotecan hydrochloride at a dose of 150 mg/m 2 as a 90 min i.v. infusion on day 1 repeated every 2 weeks [ , ]. (2) Two cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents involving (i) FOLFIRI, irinotecan hydrochloride at a dose of 150 mg/m 2 as a 90-min i.v. infusion, l -leucovorin ( l -LV) at a dose of 200 mg/m 2 as a 2 h i.v. infusion followed by 5-FU 400 mg/m 2 as an i.v. bolus then by 2400 mg/m 2 as a 46 h continuous i.v. infusion, all administered on day 1 and repeated every 2 weeks [ ]; (ii) irinotecan and cisplatin, irinotecan hydrochloride at a dose of 60 mg/m 2 as a 90 min i.v. infusion on days 1, 8, and 15 plus cisplatin at a dose of 60 mg/m 2 on day 1, repeated every 4 weeks [ ]; (iii) IRIS, irinotecan hydrochloride at a dose of 150 mg/m 2 as a 90 min i.v. infusion on day 1 followed by S-1 (tegafur, gimeracil, and oteracil potassium) 80 mg/day for body surface areas (BSAs) < 1.25 m 2 , 100 mg/day for 1.25 ≤ BSAs < 1.50 m 2 , and 120 mg/day for BSAs ≥ 1.50 m 2 for 2 weeks orally, repeated every 4 weeks [ ]. (3) Three cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents involving (i) modified FOLFIRINOX (mFOLFIRINOX), oxaliplatin at a dose of 85 mg/m 2 as a 2 h i.v. infusion where l -LV was administered at a dose of 200 mg/m 2 as a 2 h i.v. infusion, irinotecan hydrochloride at a dose of 150 mg/m 2 as a 90 min i.v. infusion, followed by 5-FU 2400 mg/m 2 as a 46 h continuous i.v. infusion, all administered on day 1 and repeated every 2 weeks [ ]; (ii) modified FOLFOXIRI (mFOLFOXIRI), irinotecan hydrochloride at a dose of 150 mg/m 2 as a 90 min i.v. infusion, l -LV was administered at a dose of 200 mg/m 2 as a 2 h i.v. infusion, oxaliplatin 85 mg/m 2 as a 2 h i.v. infusion followed by 5-FU 2400 mg/m 2 as a 46 h continuous i.v. infusion, all administered on day 1 and repeated every 2 weeks [ ].
Data collection
Patient background data such as sex, age, type of cancer, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, and smoking history, as well as irinotecan-containing chemotherapy-related data including laboratory tests and the onset of symptoms of cholinergic syndrome (abdominal pain, bradycardia, diarrhea, lacrimation, nasal discharge, and/or sweating) within 24 h after the start of treatment were collected for all patients from the medical records, during the entire period of irinotecan-containing chemotherapy. All symptoms of cholinergic syndrome were judged by medical oncologists who treated the patients with an irinotecan-containing regimen. The severity of cholinergic syndrome was not noted because these data were not necessarily described in the medical records. If an anticholinergic drug was prescribed to treat a cholinergic syndrome-related symptom, that information was also collected.
Statistical analyses
Differences in qualitative variables were tested using Fisher’s exact test or Pearson’s Chi-square test. Logistic regression analysis was performed for the multivariate analysis. Two-tailed p values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed using the JMP software, version 13.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
Results
Patient characteristics
During the study period, 194 patients with cancer received irinotecan-containing chemotherapy. 15 patients were excluded from the analyses: two patients who commenced an irinotecan-containing chemotherapy in other hospitals, ten who previously received irinotecan-containing chemotherapy, two without information on their UGT1A1 genotype, and one younger than 20 years old. Hence, 179 patients were ultimately analyzed. The characteristics of the patients in our study are shown in Table 1 .

Treatment of patients
The irinotecan-containing regimens administered to the patients are summarized in Table 2 . 91 patients (51%) received 1 cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent (irinotecan monotherapy, with or without a molecularly targeted drug). Regimens with a combination of 2 cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents (FOLFIRI, irinotecan and cisplatin, or IRIS, with or without a molecularly targeted drug) were administered to 66 patients (37%). 22 patients (12%) received 3 cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents (mFOLFIRINOX or mFOLFOXIRI, with or without a molecularly targeted drug). Molecularly targeted drugs were administered to 57 patients (32%). The median dose of irinotecan was 150 mg/m 2 , which was equivalent to 210 mg/body.

Cholinergic syndrome manifestation
The symptoms of cholinergic syndrome observed in our patients are shown in Table 3 . Among the 179 patients treated with irinotecan-containing regimens, 51 experienced symptoms consistent with cholinergic syndrome following treatment; the most common was sweating ( n = 31). Ten patients experienced sweating and diarrhea simultaneously, and 5 experienced both diarrhea and abdominal pain. Among the 51 patients, 42 (82%) developed cholinergic syndrome at their initial treatment with an irinotecan-containing regimen, whereas others developed the syndrome at second treatment or later.

27 patients (53%) received the anticholinergic drug to treat their irinotecan-induced cholinergic syndrome. Among those who developed cholinergic syndrome, approximately half were administered prophylactic anticholinergic drug before their subsequent treatment. 26 of the 27 patients (96%) did not experience the irinotecan-induced cholinergic syndrome after receiving prophylactic anticholinergic treatment, emphasizing the effectiveness of the prophylactic anticholinergics.
Risk factors for cholinergic syndrome
We first performed univariate analysis to identify clinical factors associated with irinotecan-induced cholinergic syndrome (Table 4 ). The number of cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents was significantly related to the incidence of cholinergic syndrome ( p < 0.05, Pearson’s Chi-square test); the incidences in patients receiving 1, 2, and 3 cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent(s) were 17.6%, 37.9%, and 45.5%, respectively. The Cochran-Armitage trend test revealed that the higher the number of cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs, the greater the incidences of irinotecan-related cholinergic syndrome ( p < 0.05). However, the addition of a molecularly targeted drug did not affect the incidence of cholinergic syndrome. As shown in Table 4 , the remaining investigated clinical factors were not associated with the incidence of cholinergic syndrome.

The results of multivariate analysis are shown in Table 5 . The incidence of cholinergic syndrome in patients who received two cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents (FOLFIRI, irinotecan and cisplatin or IRIS) was significantly higher than that in patients who received 1 cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent (irinotecan monotherapy) [odds ratio (OR) 4.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.5–12, p = 0.0053]. A significantly higher incidence rate of cholinergic syndrome was observed in patients who received three cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents (mFOLFIRINOX or mFOLFOXIRI) than in those who received irinotecan monotherapy (OR 4.50, 95% CI 1.5–14, p = 0.0093). These results indicate a positive correlation between the addition of cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents administered as part of irinotecan-containing regimens and the incidence of irinotecan-induced cholinergic syndrome.

Discussion
We found a positive correlation between the addition of cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents in administered irinotecan-containing regimen and the incidence of cholinergic syndrome. The incidence rate of cholinergic syndrome in patients administered 2–3 cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents was significantly higher than that in patients administered irinotecan monotherapy (Table 5 ). At present, the mechanism through which cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents had an additive effect when combined with irinotecan monotherapy to produce cholinergic syndrome remains unclear. Valencak et al. [ ] reported a 53-year-old woman who experienced cholinergic syndrome attributable to irinotecan therapy; her regimen comprised 85 mg/m 2 oxaliplatin on days 1 and 15 followed by 80 mg/m 2 irinotecan on days 1, 8, and 15. The patient complained of hypersalivation and abdominal pain along with decreased blood pressure immediately after the first infusion of irinotecan. Interestingly, she did not experience these side effects with the second dose of irinotecan alone on day 8; however, on day 15, her symptoms promptly recurred during the infusion of irinotecan following oxaliplatin administration. After this second episode, the regimen was modified, and oxaliplatin was infused on days 1 and 14 while irinotecan was administered separately on days 2, 8, and 15. The second cycle of treatment with this split schedule was tolerated without any side effects, and the patient did not experience any irinotecan-induced acute symptoms with this modified regimen. However, when the patient was re-challenged with the original schedule of both drugs administered on the same day, she again experienced symptoms consistent with cholinergic syndrome. These results suggest that the irinotecan-induced cholinergic syndrome was triggered by the coadministration of oxaliplatin, as the adverse effect was not observed with the application of irinotecan alone. Taken together, the coadministration of oxaliplatin may be, at least in part, responsible for the significantly higher incidence of irinotecan-induced cholinergic syndrome observed in patients administered three cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, including oxaliplatin, than that in patients treated with irinotecan alone. On the other hand, there have been no reports of higher incidences of irinotecan-related cholinergic syndrome in patients coadministered 5-FU. Further studies are, therefore, warranted to clarify the mechanisms responsible for the additive effects of cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents on the incidence of irinotecan-induced cholinergic syndrome.
In general, irinotecan-induced cholinergic syndrome impairs the patients’ QOL. Medical oncologists sometimes treat such patients with anticholinergic drugs either to improve their QOL or to prophylactically prevent the development of symptoms in subsequent treatments with irinotecan, nonetheless there are no sufficient lines of evidence for the use of such anticholinergics to treat cholinergic syndrome [ , , , , , ]. Our present results suggest that appropriate anticholinergic usage should be established for patients who will require irinotecan combined with other cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents.
Irinotecan-related cholinergic syndrome is observed at various doses of irinotecan, and its incidence rate appears to be dose-dependent [ , , , ]. We summarized the relationship between the incidence rate of irinotecan-induced cholinergic syndrome and doses in patients administered irinotecan monotherapy in previous studies [ , , , ] as well as ours in Table 6 . We found that patient groups administered irinotecan doses of 250 mg/m 2 or greater had higher incidences of cholinergic syndrome (> 50%), whereas those receiving irinotecan doses less than 250 mg/m 2 had lower incidence rates (approximately 40% or less). In our present study, the incidence rates of cholinergic syndrome were 33% at an irinotecan dose of 150 mg/m 2 and 21% at doses under 150 mg/m 2 , which were approximately consistent with the values observed in previous studies (Table 6 ). There was no significant difference in the incidence rates between the < 150 and 150 mg/m 2 dosage groups, indicating that dose-dependent increases of cholinergic syndrome were not observed at irinotecan doses ≤ 150 mg/m 2 . Hence, the incidence of irinotecan-induced cholinergic syndrome appears to increase at doses higher than 250 mg/m 2 . On the other hand, Kanbayashi et al. [ ] recently reported that irinotecan dose (mg/body) was a significant factor for the development of cholinergic syndrome, although we did not observe a significant relationship between cholinergic syndrome and irinotecan dose [median 210 (range 80–290) mg/body (Table 2 )] (data not shown). Further studies are necessary to clarify the effects of irinotecan dose on the onset of cholinergic syndrome.

Several lines of evidence have linked UGT1A1 * 28 and UGT1A1 * 6 genotypes to irinotecan-induced toxicity, especially severe neutropenia [ , , , ], because the (TA) 7 allele in the proximal promoter region of UGT1A1 ( UGT1A1 * 28 ) [ ] as well as a mutation in exon 1 (211G < A, G71R), referred to as UGT1A1 * 6 [ ], can cause reduced gene expression and decreased catalytic activity of the drug-metabolizing enzyme, respectively, resulting in a significantly decreased conversion rate of SN-38 to SN-38G [ , , , ]. Our current data revealed no significant association between the UGT1A1 genotypes and irinotecan-induced cholinergic syndrome, suggesting that plasma levels of SN-38 and SN-38G played no role in the occurrence of cholinergic syndrome, which is consistent with the results obtained by Blandizzi C et al. [ ].
The incidence of irinotecan-induced cholinergic syndrome appears to be roughly similar between Japanese (current study) and Western patients [ , , , ], when patients were treated with irinotecan doses less than 250 mg/m 2 (Table 6 ). The frequency of Japanese patients with two ‘risk alleles’ (i.e., UGT1A1 * 28 /* 28 , * 6 /* 6 , and * 6 /* 28 ) (10.1%) [ ] was almost equal to that of Western patients with the risk allele UGT1A1 * 28 /* 28 (~ 11%) [ ]. In addition, our current data showed no significant association between the UGT1A1 genotypes and the cholinergic syndrome at irinotecan doses of ≤ 150 mg/m 2 (Table 4 ). Overall, the incidence of irinotecan-induced cholinergic syndrome in Japanese and Western patients might be almost similar at least with irinotecan doses less than 250 mg/m 2 , and is not related to UGT1A1 genotypes.
Approximately 20% of patients examined in this study showed a Ccr < 60 mL/min (Ccr median 75 mL/min, range 20–199 mL/min), and there was no correlation between renal function and irinotecan-related cholinergic syndrome. de Jong et al. [ ] demonstrated that irinotecan clearance observed in patients with mild renal failure (Ccr 35–66 mL/min) was slightly lower than that in patients with normal renal function (Ccr > 98 mL/min), although clearances of SN-38 and SN-38G did not differ substantially. However, patients in our study who had Ccr levels < 60 mL/min appeared to have similar pharmacokinetic profiles of all irinotecan, SN-38, and SN-38G to those with normal renal function (Ccr ≥ 60 mL/min). Our results also suggest that there is no difference in patient susceptibility to irinotecan-induced cholinergic syndrome (pharmacodynamics) based on renal function as measured by Ccr.
It has been reported that cigarette smokers showed a significantly lower dose-normalized area under the plasma concentration–time curve of irinotecan than nonsmokers by the potential induction of carboxylesterase enzyme, which catalyzes irinotecan conversion to SN-38, by cigarette smoke components [ ]. Furthermore, smokers showed an almost 40% lower exposure to SN-38 as well as a higher relative extent of glucuronidation of SN-38 into SN-38G, probably owing to the upregulation of the UGT1A1 enzyme by cigarette smoke. Although smokers experienced considerably less hematologic toxicity in a previous study [ ], our results demonstrated that smoking cigarettes was not correlated with irinotecan-induced cholinergic syndrome. The pharmacokinetic profiles of irinotecan and its metabolites in our smoking patient population may not be sufficiently altered to induce cholinergic syndrome.
Our study had several limitations. First, it was a retrospective observational study in which information on cholinergic syndrome was collected from medical records written by medical oncologists based on patient complains, without any predetermined criteria, which may lead to potential bias in both patient and their evaluation. The severities of cholinergic syndrome symptoms were not investigated because of the lack of such information in medical records. Second, we did not investigate concomitant medications that may have affected the onset of irinotecan-induced cholinergic syndrome except for anticholinergics prescribed for the symptom by medical oncologists.
In conclusion, our study demonstrated for the first time that the addition of cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent(s) coadministered with irinotecan is positively correlated with the onset of irinotecan-induced cholinergic syndrome.
