Introduction
Pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum and acne (PAPA) syndrome is a rare autosomal-dominant autoinflammatory disease of incomplete penetrance and variable expression caused by a mutation in the proline serine threonine phosphatase-interacting protein 1 ( PSTPIP1 )/CD2-binding protein 1 ( CD2BP1 ) gene located on chromosome 15. PAPA syndrome results in an abnormal overproduction of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β) [ , , , , , , , ]. This syndrome clinically manifests as early onset recurrent episodes of acute aseptic inflammation of the joints in the first two decades of life. Later, characteristic skin lesions might appear in the third decade, after the joint symptoms are less pronounced [ , , , , , , , ]. Imaging findings of the joints in the acute setting, although not specific, might include large effusions, synovitis with synovial hypertrophy, bone marrow edema and soft-tissue swelling.
The diagnosis of PAPA syndrome is clinical, based on laboratory results and genetic testing. Clues to the diagnosis of PAPA syndrome, especially when there is no known family history or skin manifestations, include: (1) a history of recurrent episodes of arthritis, especially after minor trauma; (2) usually afebrile patients; (3) purulent synovial fluid with increased neutrophils, but negative bacterial cultures; and (4) clinical and imaging findings at initial presentation that suggest an infectious process, but with minimal improvement with antibiotics.
We present the clinical and imaging findings of PAPA syndrome in two unrelated adolescents with confirmed mutations in the PSTPIP1/CD2BP1 gene with review of the literature. Although uncommon, a timely diagnosis of PAPA syndrome is crucial so that appropriate treatment can be initiated to mitigate the potentially severe and rapid joint destruction.
Cases descriptions
Patient 1
Patient 1 is a 15-year-old boy who presented to the emergency department with an acute onset of severe joint pain and swelling of his right elbow for 4 days. He had a history of recurrent episodes of right knee arthritis that were culture-negative, with the first episode documented at age 5. Genetic testing had confirmed PAPA syndrome. He also had a history of a few mild episodes of knee arthritis in the last 4 years, but none was as markedly symptomatic as his current presentation. These previous events were treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), oral prednisone and intraarticular steroid injections, following confirmation of a negative culture.
His right elbow was markedly swollen, tender and warm to touch, but not erythematous, with severely limited range of movement. He was afebrile, no concurrent infections were identified, and no recent trauma was reported. There were no skin lesions. A radiograph and MRI of the elbow were obtained (Fig. 1 ). The radiograph showed marked soft-tissue swelling with joint effusion. MRI showed a very large multiloculated joint effusion with internal septations and extensive synovial thickening with post-contrast enhancement. There was enhancing bone marrow edema in T1-weighted fat-saturated sequences, with high signal on T2-weighted fat-saturated images, and diffuse surrounding soft-tissue swelling. While these imaging findings were suggestive of an underlying septic process, ultrasound-guided synovial fluid aspirate yielded negative synovial gram stain and subsequent negative cultures. Synovial fluid analysis showed multiple polymorphonuclear cells and no organisms. Bloodwork revealed a normal white blood cell count, markedly elevated inflammatory indices, with high C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. The boy had minimal clinical response to treatment with the maximum dose of NSAID and prednisone. An interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (anakinra) was added to his treatment, resulting in significant clinical improvement. A repeat MRI obtained 6 weeks after treatment demonstrated marked improvement of the right elbow joint effusion, with mild residual synovial enhancement and subtle residual soft-tissue and bone marrow edema (Fig. 2 ). He had no recurrence during follow-up.

Patient 2
Patient 2 is a 16-year-old boy with confirmed genetic testing for PAPA syndrome who presented to the emergency department with an acute onset of severe pain, swelling and marked reduction in range of movement of his right arm and elbow. No fever or concurrent infections were identified. Review of systems was otherwise negative. Radiographs and MRI of the elbow were obtained (Fig. 3 ). Radiographs revealed a large joint effusion and significant periarticular soft-tissue swelling. No periarticular osteopenia, periostitis, epiphyseal overgrowth, joint space narrowing, erosions or loose bodies were seen. The MRI demonstrated large joint effusion with synovial thickening and increased enhancement. There was abnormal periarticular bone marrow edema with low T1-weighted, high T2-weighted fat-saturated, and high short tau inversion recovery (STIR) signal intensity with abnormal increased enhancement on post-gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted fat-saturated sequences. Marked edema of the surrounding extraosseous soft tissues was present.

There was a history of multiple episodes of arthritis involving different joints occurring as early as 4 years of age, with clear exacerbation and increased frequency of symptoms during adolescence (Figs. 4 , 5 and 6 ). Many of these events were precipitated by sports injuries; the last episode was diagnosed clinically after a hockey injury. Family history revealed that his father had a similar history of joint involvement during adolescence and later developed acneiform eruptions involving his back during early adulthood.

The boy had increased inflammatory indices, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and synovial fluid leukocytosis. Blood and synovial fluid cultures were negative. There was minimal clinical response following treatment with NSAIDs and prednisone. Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (anakinra) was added as well and resulted in complete resolution of the clinical findings. There was also resolution of the MR abnormalities in the osseous and soft-tissue structures of the joint.
Discussion
We present two unrelated cases with confirmed genetic diagnoses of pyogenic sterile arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum and acne (PAPA) syndrome and a review of the literature with a focus on the musculoskeletal manifestations and radiologic findings, with the objective to make the radiologist aware of this disorder that mimics other entities and is more commonly seen in children.
PAPA syndrome (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man [OMIM] ID #604416) is a rare autosomal-dominant autoinflammatory disorder [ , , , , , , , ]. It is caused by mutations in the CD2BP1 gene and its murine ortholog the PSTPIP1 gene, located in chromosome 15 [ , , , , , , , ]. According to our literature search, a total of 53 cases with PAPA syndrome have been reported [ , , ]. The individuals with PAPA syndrome showed the characteristic feature of recurrent aseptic pyogenic arthritis, affecting different joints and usually occurring after minor trauma (Table 1 ; [ , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ]). The joint involvement appears early in childhood, with an increase in frequency during adolescence. Characteristic skin lesions (of pyoderma gangrenosum and acne) typically present after a decrease in the joint symptoms. Table 1 Summary of literature on PAPA syndrome.

Historically, it was described as streaking leukocyte factor, arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum and acne in a 14-year-old boy presenting with multiple recurrent episodes of sterile pyarthrosis affecting different joints including ankles, elbow and hip, as well as acne, and pyoderma gangrenosum [ ]. The acronym of PAPA syndrome was proposed in 1997 by Lindor et al. [ ] after they studied a multigenerational disorder of 10 family members affected with recurrent acute events of pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum and severe acne. The authors described the pleiotropy and variable expression of PAPA syndrome [ ]. Later Wise et al. [ ] described another family with similar clinical characteristics. The family members they described had been diagnosed with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Authors identified an autosomal-dominant inheritance pattern in this family. The proband had had multiple events of recurrent arthritis, with accumulation of sterile pyogenic joint fluid and cutaneous findings. But they noted other family members had also had episodic JIA-like events characterized by joint inflammation, some of them demonstrating eventual joint destruction, and some individuals showing skin lesions. This JIA-like disorder was then considered a distinct clinical entity to JIA and was initially called “familial recurrent arthritis” [ ]. Then, after comparing the clinical characteristics of their family members to those described by Lindor et al., the authors concluded the family was also affected with PAPA syndrome [ , ].
The exact molecular mechanisms in PAPA syndrome remain unclear. PSTPIP1 encodes a cytoskeleton-associated adaptor protein with an essential role in the cytoskeleton organization, modulating T cell and phagocyte activation, as well as IL-1β release, ultimately resulting in an abnormal overproduction of the pro-inflammatory cytokine [ , , , , , , , , , ]. Wise et al. [ ] suggested an inflammatory model of disease pathogenesis in PAPA syndrome, with potential etiological overlap through a biochemical pathway mediated by CD2BP1, and other inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. Shoham et al. [ ] identified an increased production of IL-1β by peripheral leukocytes in clinically active patients with PAPA syndrome and demonstrated that the PSTPIP1/CD2BP1 mutations show increased interaction with pyrin in PAPA patients, providing evidence linking PAPA syndrome with abnormalities in pyrin- PSTPIP1 binding [ , ]. Pyrin is involved in the activation and secretion of IL-1β and is also the mutated protein encountered in familial Mediterranean fever [ , , , ]. Familial Mediterranean fever is the prototype of an autoinflammatory disease, characterized by fever, serositis, arthritis and skin rash. This suggests a common biochemical pathway between PAPA and familial Mediterranean fever [ , , ]. It is also known that PSTPIP1 protein interacts with many other intracellular proteins, including the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein, through different domains, which is possibly responsible for the variability in the manifestations of the syndrome and its similarity with other clinical conditions [ ].
PAPA syndrome is the first autoinflammatory entity described in the literature within a spectrum of multiple other diseases secondary to mutations in the PSTPIP1 gene. These are called the PSTPIP1 -associated inflammatory diseases (PAID), which incorporate episodes of severe recurrent arthritis and skin or other organ manifestations [ , ]. There are approximately 25 PSTPIP1 gene sequence variants reported in the literature [ , , , ]. Apart from PAPA syndrome, other PSTPIP1 -associated inflammatory diseases include: PSTPIP1 -associated myeloid-related proteinemia inflammatory syndrome (PAMI); pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, acne and hidradenitis suppurativa syndrome (PAPASH); pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum and acne-like syndrome (PAPA-like); and pyoderma gangrenosum, acne and ulcerative colitis syndrome (PAC), which may show similar clinical characteristics, or overlap with PAPA syndrome (Table 2 ) [ , , , , , , ].

PAPA syndrome has also been included in a group of autoinflammatory disorders secondary to a single gene defect [ , ]. Monogenic autoinflammatory syndromes (MAIS) are entities with dysregulation of the innate immune system that leads to activation of abnormal inflammasomes. This dysregulation is spontaneous, with no autoantibodies or autoreactive T cells. Monogenic autoinflammatory syndromes may present as a systemic manifestation, like episodes of fever, or with involvement of different tissues including skin, serous membranes, eyes, joints, gastrointestinal tract and nervous system [ , ]. Some of these disorders have prominent features including arthritis and bone inflammation, or skin manifestations, like rash [ , , , ]. Including PAPA syndrome, other monogenic autoinflammatory syndromes include familial Mediterranean fever, Blau syndrome or early onset sarcoidosis, chronic atypical neutrophilic dermatosis with lipodystrophy and elevated temperature syndrome (CANDLE), Majeed syndrome, deficiency of the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (DIRA), deficiency of the IL-36 receptor antagonist (DITRA), mevalonate kinase deficiency or hyper-IgD syndrome (HIDS), Guadalupe-type fever syndrome ( NLRP12 -associated autoinflammatory disorder), tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), and cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) [ , , , , , , ]. Within the CAPS are included the familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS), Muckle-Wells syndrome and the neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID) or CINCA (chronic infantile neurological, cutaneous and articular) syndrome [ , , , ]. Of these entities familial Mediterranean fever, FCAS, Muckle-Wells syndrome and NOMID syndrome share a common etiology as being affected by pyrin or related proteins, like PAPA syndrome [ , ]. These disorders can manifest with inflammatory symptoms of variable severity, duration and frequency, with associated increased inflammatory parameters identified in laboratory investigations. Table 2 summarizes the main clinical manifestations of these entities.
Clinical manifestations of PAPA syndrome
PAPA syndrome is characterized by recurrent, intermittent arthritis that appears early in childhood, with subsequent appearance of severe cystic acne, after marked decrease in joint manifestations [ , , , , , , , ]. The classic triad manifestations of PAPA syndrome are rarely seen simultaneously. Some individuals present florid manifestations early in life, but others show milder clinical features. Studies of families affected with PAPA syndrome have demonstrated a variable penetrance and expression, even with asymptomatic carriers [ , , , , , , , , , ], with PAPA syndrome going unrecognized in some families and passing unnoticed between generations, or being treated as a different condition [ , ]. The differences in the positioning of the mutated proteins, as well as the complex interactions of PSTPIP1 with other intracellular proteins involved in the immune response, might be responsible for the variable presentation and response to treatment in PAPA syndrome [ , , ]. The focus of this review is the clinical and imaging findings of the joint manifestations of PAPA syndrome, although we briefly comment on the skin and other systems’ manifestations.
Joint manifestations
The characteristic acute recurrent sterile arthritis, characterized by accumulation of sterile pyogenic polymorphonuclear leukocyte-rich material within the joint space, is commonly the first manifestation of PAPA syndrome. The arthritis is predominantly of early childhood onset, occurring as early as the first year of age. However, in some patients the first manifestation of arthritis appears after 20 years of age, and in some the skin lesions appear before puberty [ , , ]. The acute flares of joint pain and swelling can occur spontaneously or apparently after minor trauma [ , , , , ]. Initially the articular symptoms are very sporadic, but there seems to be an increase in frequency during puberty in most patients [ ].
PAPA syndrome mainly affects joints of the appendicular skeleton in a random order, including ankles, knees, elbows and wrists [ , , , , ]. It also has been described to involve shoulders, hips, and metacarpophalangeal and metatarsophalangeal joints, although with less frequency [ , , , ]. Involvement of the cervical spine has also been described [ ]. The recurrent inflammatory joint episodes lead to accumulation of neutrophil-rich material within the affected joints and different degrees of joint changes, which has been described as mild to non-resolving, leading to severe cartilage destruction, and progressive destructive joint changes if left untreated [ , , , , ].
Radiographic patterns include pauciarticular, erosive arthritis; advanced arthritic changes including osteophyte formation, diffuse joint narrowing, subchondral sclerosis and cyst formation; reactive new bone formation, with remarkable bone overgrowth and, in some cases, joint deformity or destruction with ankyloses [ , , ]. For example, Lindor et al. [ ] described that all except one of the family members diagnosed with PAPA syndrome in their cohort developed arthritis. Some of their patients developed sterile joint abscesses, which were treated with joint drainage. One individual, who developed joint deformity, required eventual bone grafting and derotational osteotomy in the hip, and developed decreased range of motion of the affected joint [ ]. A patient described in a case report by Cortis et al. [ ] developed narrowing of the right hip joint space and a shorten and irregular femoral head with significant limitation of range of motion, although it is unclear whether the joint changes were in some part related to side effects from long-term steroid treatment. Another patient developed flexion contracture of the left elbow after recurrent episodes of inflammatory arthritis [ ]. Similarly, other individuals described in the literature as being affected with PAPA syndrome have shown various degrees and patterns of joint involvement. The patients that we describe in this paper presented with recurrent, sporadic flares of arthritis, affecting a single joint — same or different from previously — during every event,. The most commonly affected joints were the knees and elbows.
There is lack of literature illustrating the MRI findings of the affected joints in PAPA syndrome. The MRI in the patients presented in this review did not demonstrate particular imaging characteristics that could aid in recognizing this entity, nor in differentiating it from other more common pediatric musculoskeletal conditions, like septic arthritis or juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), osteomyelitis, or chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) [ , , , , , , , , ]. Table 3 summarizes the differential diagnoses that could be considered in the acute setting of PAPA syndrome. Both of our patients showed nonspecific findings, including a large multiloculated joint effusion with synovial thickening and hyperenhancement, as well as bone marrow edema/enhancement and surrounding soft-tissue edema. Pertinent negative findings include absence of periostitis, subchondral irregularity, erosions, cartilage destruction or subperiosteal collections. Another negative was the lack of rice bodies.

Interestingly, Caorsi et al. [ ] reported a case of a 33-month-old girl who had been seen for recurrent worsening events of left knee arthritis with negative cultures presenting as early as 18 months of age; these events were treated with antibiotics and showed partial temporary response. During one of the acute events of left knee arthritis, the girl also developed distal leg pain, and the radiograph showed a small osteolytic lesion with periosteal reaction in the distal diaphysis of the left tibia, confirmed with MRI. Bone biopsy of this lesion showed inflammatory infiltrate with neutrophils, macrophages and monocytes and was diagnosed originally as CRMO and treated with prednisone showing good response. The girl subsequently developed new right knee arthritis with synovial vegetations, but negative cultures, and eventually was diagnosed with PAPA syndrome with confirmed mutations in the girl and her father. Although the inflammatory osteolytic lesions are not considered a characteristic feature of PAPA syndrome, these lesions have been described as a common finding of other autoinflammatory entities like Majeed and DIRA syndromes and CRMO [ , , , , ]. Although bone infection is not commonly seen in PAPA syndrome, Demidowich et al. [ ] reported isolated cases of osteomyelitis. Finally, dactylitis and tendinitis have been described in PAPA syndrome [ ], although these are not considered characteristic features.
Skin manifestations
The skin manifestations in PAPA syndrome also can be episodic. Although early onset might be seen at 10–11 years of age, it is more frequently seen after puberty, at which time the joint symptoms decrease [ , ]. Characteristic skin lesions include recurrent non-healing sterile ulcers, severe cystic acne, pyoderma gangrenosum and acne conglobata, usually seen by the third decade of life [ , , , ]. Most patients develop acne, usually the nodulocystic form, which generally appears after puberty and persists into adulthood [ ]. Pyoderma gangrenosum is seen less frequently, although it is an important characteristic of PAPA syndrome. It is initially characterized by small superficial erythematous violaceous papules, evolving to sterile pustules and aggressive ulcerative skin lesions predominantly seen in the extremities [ ]. Pyoderma gangrenosum also occurs in other conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease, hepatitis, seronegative arthritis, myeloproliferative disorders and hyperzincemia [ ]. These entities can encompass other inflammatory disorders, which might include inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, uveitis and hidradenitis suppurativa. Another skin manifestation of PAPA syndrome is the formation of sterile abscess at the site of injections [ ].
Other systems
With regard to the involvement of other systems in PAPA syndrome, Khatibi et al. [ ] described a patient with confirmed genetic mutation and central nervous system involvement who developed cerebral arterial vasculitis and subarachnoid hemorrhage secondary to a ruptured dissecting aneurysm involving the posterior cerebral artery. Although the cause of the vasculitis in this patient was not confirmed on histopathology because no biopsy was performed, authors suggested an inflammatory etiology with a resulting dissecting aneurysm secondary to the underlying arteriopathy, proposing an association of intracranial arterial vasculitis or vasculopathy and PAPA syndrome [ ]. Although vasculitis has not been a characteristic of PAPA syndrome, it has been associated with other autoinflammatory conditions such as familial Mediterranean fever and Behcet syndrome.
Horiuchi et al. [ ] described a 31-year-old pregnant woman who was diagnosed with a cerebral aneurysm with eventual subarachnoid bleed. Although according to authors this woman was clinically diagnosed with PAPA syndrome, no identifiable PSTPIP1 mutation or family history of PAPA syndrome was confirmed. Similarly, Hong et al. [ ] described a 32-year-old man with pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum and acne, but also with no evidence of genetic mutation. Therefore one could speculate these two patients represented a different clinical entity within the spectrum of chronic autoinflammatory or PAPA-like diseases rather than PAPA syndrome.
Diagnostic challenges and differential diagnoses of PAPA syndrome
The broad expression and great variability in the clinical presentation of PAPA syndrome even in same-family members challenges its prompt diagnosis. Even though there seems to be a common distinct pattern of acute pyogenic aseptic inflammatory arthritis that later switches to skin manifestations after the second decade of life, and a lack of systemic manifestations, the clinical suspicion of PAPA syndrome syndrome might be low. Diagnosis of PAPA syndrome is especially difficult in the early years because of the rarity of the syndrome, absence of skin lesions, or absence of family history. Furthermore, because the joint events closely mimic other more frequent pediatric entities, like infection, a septic process needs to be promptly excluded. The final diagnosis of PAPA syndrome must be clinical and relies on exclusion of joint infection, or other acute or chronic etiologies that present with comparable clinical characteristics, supported by a positive family history, together with a confirmed genetic mutation. Thus extensive workup must be performed. One must also consider that the prolonged turnaround time for genetic mutation analysis (at least 8–12 weeks), which can delay the diagnosis of PAPA syndrome.
In the acute setting, PAPA syndrome mimics septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, JIA or CRMO. However, because it is associated with periodic inflammatory flares, other entities that present with inflammatory arthritis should be considered. Therefore, in the setting of recurrent or chronic manifestations of PAPA syndrome, potential diagnostic entities might include other diseases secondary to mutations in the PSTPIP1 gene (PAID), or some of the monogenic autoinflammatory disorders. These entities might show clinical similarities overlapping with the classic PAPA syndrome triad, but they also demonstrate important differences (Table 2 ) [ , , , , , , ]. PAMI, PAPASH and PAPA-like syndromes are the PAID entities that present pyogenic arthritis and similar skin lesions as seen in PAPA syndrome [ , , ]. Apart from PAPA syndrome, two other MAIS entities are considered within the autoinflammatory pyogenic disorders [ , ]: Majeed syndrome, which is characterized by multifocal sterile osteomyelitis, anemia and dermatosis [ ]; and DIRA syndrome, which is characterized by multifocal sterile osteomyelitis, periostitis, pustulosis with ichthyosis-like features, nail abnormalities, and risk of multiorgan failure [ , , ].
Septic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum and cystic acne are clinically distinct members of the larger class of inflammatory diseases. Arthritis and pyoderma gangrenosum have independently been linked with inflammatory bowel disease. However, the severe acne seen in PAPA is not a characteristic feature of inflammatory bowel disease [ , ]. The association of chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) with arthritis and pyogenic skin manifestations has been described as part of a distinct entity characterized by synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis (SAPHO), which might also be considered in the differential diagnosis [ , , ]. Tables 2 and 3 summarize these entities.
A feature seen in PAPA syndrome and other PAID entities like PAMI is the characteristic expression of two pro-inflammatory proteins of the S100 family, named alarmins or danger-associated molecular patterns. These are MRP8 (S100A8) and MRP14 (S100A9), proteins that are released during cellular stress states or local cell damage during inflammation and are highly expressed in phagocytes [ ]. Therefore testing serum levels of MRP8 and MRP14 and genetic testing might be warranted for the appropriate diagnosis of PAPA syndrome [ ].
Cultures of the joint effusion are characteristically negative in PAPA syndrome. However this should not be considered a unique feature because there is a broad overlap of signs and symptoms between infectious and non-infectious pyogenic arthritis. Therefore other etiologies including tuberculosis and culture-negative Kingella kingae and other pathogens must be considered [ , ]. Kingella, for example, is a leading pathogen associated with osteoarticular infection in children. However cultures are frequently sterile because this organism is difficult to isolate in bone and joint samples [ ]. Serologic assessment in PAPA syndrome is negative for antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, anticardiolipin antibodies (IgM and IgG), hepatitis serology (B and C) and plasma reagin cryoglobulin, and it has normal complements C3 and C4, prothrombin time, and partial thromboplastin time. Hypogammaglobulinemia and elevated serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha have been identified in these patients [ , ]. Exploratory surgery of the joint in PAPA syndrome has shown nonspecific joint inflammation and hypertrophic synovitis with marked synovial thickening and high leukocyte count in the joint aspirates and high synovial fluid complement levels, which can help to differentiate PAPA syndrome from rheumatoid arthritis [ ]. Loffler et al. [ ] proposed synovial cell counts as a potentially useful method to diagnose PAPA syndrome because persistence of exceedingly high synovial cell counts over time would be unusual in other more common inflammatory joint diseases. Authors have suggested this test could be especially beneficial in children before the skin component of the syndrome has manifested [ ].
Treatment
There is no standardized treatment for PAPA syndrome. Although the genetic and pathogenic background of PAPA syndrome is being continuously studied, its therapeutic approach remains challenging. For the initial cases of PAPA syndrome reported in the literature, the therapeutic approach included the use of corticosteroids (prednisone), either systemically administered or by direct intraarticular injection, NSAIDs, or antibiotics, although with varied experience [ , , ]. Joint aspiration has been reported to be useful for relieving joint distension/pain during clinical flares. Understanding the pathogenesis of PAPA syndrome has led to more targeted treatment approaches. Several reports have documented the efficacy of anti-interleukin (IL) 1β treatment, more commonly with the IL1 receptor antagonist anakinra. Treatment with monoclonal anti-IL1 antibody and anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (anti-TNF-α) agents have shown efficacy [ , , , , , , , ]. When the final diagnosis of PAPA syndrome is made, administration of prompt systemic therapy should aid in avoiding repeated arthrocentesis for cultures, or other ineffective therapies. Both cases we present here were treated with anakinra, with excellent clinical and imaging response for their joint manifestations within a few weeks of treatment.
Summary
PAPA syndrome is an exceptionally rare condition whose diagnosis remains clinical. However it might be suspected after exclusion of joint infection in repeated episodes of joint inflammation, and confirmed after genetic testing. To our knowledge, current literature on PAPA syndrome describes the overall clinical manifestations associated with the syndrome, mainly with emphasis in the cutaneous manifestations but with limited literature detailing the imaging findings of the affected joints. This review might help the reader to have general knowledge about the syndrome and its potential clinical and imaging differential diagnoses.
