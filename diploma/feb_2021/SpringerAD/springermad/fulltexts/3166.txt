Introduction
Pharmaceuticals is a global business sector focused on development of performance-based products designed to address the healthcare needs of more than seven billion people. In recent years, economic, technological, and regulatory challenges associated with the current pharmaceutical manufacturing methodologies have encouraged industry to invest in more efficient and reliable product manufacturing technologies that help reduce development time, save cost, and improve drug product quality [ , ].
Although batch processes are the predominant development route in most of the pharmaceutical industry, often they do not result in the most efficient method for manufacturing, given the number of steps required and the need to scale-up to meet demand [ , ]. Moreover, responding to the need of implementing Quality by Design (QbD) and process analytical technology (PAT) initiatives, the pharmaceutical industry is currently focusing on continuous manufacturing (CM) of drug products [ , , , , , ] as the main alternative to batch manufacturing. There are numerous advantageous gained by utilizing CM; some of these are mentioned here. CM enables a much deeper level of process knowledge and understanding. Since continuous process scale-up is done through increase in operation time and parallelization of the same continuous train of equipment (e.g.,” scale-up by number-up”), process knowledge acquired during development can be directly applied to manufacturing processes [ , ]. This development strategy minimizes technology transfer to commercial sites, improves risk assessment and failure mode analysis (i.e., equipment is highly studied), and reduces capital cost. Furthermore, CM processes function in a nearly steady “state of control” where critical product quality attributes are kept nearly constant over time by deliberate manipulation of process variables. Therefore, continuous systems with automation and process control can result in higher quality products, improving quality and robustness and reducing waste [ ]. These and other advantages have motivated major pharmaceutical and equipment manufacturing companies to embrace CM technology for both legacy and new drug products [ , ]. Nonetheless, there are many challenges confronting a company seeking to implement CM technology: higher initial cost, extended initial development effort, lack of familiarity with PAT and process control tools required for monitoring continuous processes, and difficulty of implementation for low volume and low dosage products [ ]. Details regarding these problems can be found in the literature: Since it is difficult to determine where one batch starts and another end, material traceability becomes of the utmost importance [ , , , ]. Residence time distributions are commonly used to determine how long the material takes while passing through each unit operation [ , ]. One of the most significant issues for continuous manufacturing, and material traceability, is adhesion of components to the various exposed surfaces of the continuous line. Adhesion can be due to several causes, primarily stemming around particle size and crystallinity. In the feeder, powder can adhere to the hopper or agitator blade, creating near infinite residence time. Additionally, powder can adhere to the screws of a feeder, causing them to clog and unable to dispense material at a controllable rate. While some equipment can be modified to provide workarounds to certain issues, this may not be the case for all the listed issues. If fine particles acquire electrostatic charge, this can also cause the particles to adhere to the surface of the continuous line. By having active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) adhering in the line, production of subpotent tablets could become an issue, until the adhered powder disengages from the walls. When the adhered powder falls off, it can cause a significant spike in concentration and superpotent tablets. Powder adhesion is particularly troubling if it happens at the PAT interface. This could cause content uniformity predictions to be to be inaccurate, resulting in diversion of good material or in labeling bad material as good. Also, as primary particle size decreases below 50 μm, the intensity of the gravitational force begins to approach that of the inter-particle forces. This can result in particles that agglomerate. If this is the case for a low-dose API, there could be significant issues in content uniformity of the final product. It can cause most tablets to be slightly subpotent causing a few tablets to be strongly superpotent. Agglomeration of API can be overcome by using high shearing forces within the continuous line. Another notable challenge for CM is dealing with regulatory uncertainty; while the US FDA has provided ample input regarding their support for this technology, other regulatory agencies around the world have been less forthright. Another significant difficulty in implementing CM at new locations is the pronounced scarcity or properly trained process engineers capable of implementing such systems, which has become a rate-limiting factor in the adoption of CM. This is in fact a significant opportunity for academic research centers to undertake the development of instructional courses that acquaint current and future members of the pharmaceutical industry with this novel technology.
As part of our commitment to improving the pharmaceutical manufacturing, our center, the NSF Engineering Research Center for Structured Organic Particulate Systems (ERC-SOPS), developed and executed a 2-week full-time course focusing on both the theoretical and practical knowledge needed to evaluate, design, and operate continuous manufacturing processes. More specifically, the goal of this training was to provide teams of industrial members and regulatory agency representatives with hands-on experience in methods used for formulation and development of continuously manufactured direct compression products. The training covered four inter-related elements of continuous direct compression manufacturing process: (1) unit operations (i.e., processing equipment), (2) PAT, (3) modeling and process controls, and (4) material characterization. Each section included classroom lectures giving an overview on the theoretical aspects of each topic, followed by a hands-on experimental component. In this article, we describe in detail the topics covered in this training, as well as present the exercises covered for each component. Our ultimate objective is to provide other research centers and organizations with a framework to develop similar courses to train members of the pharmaceutical industry as well as encourage the adoption of CM.
Pharmaceutical Continuous Direct Compression
A schematic process flow diagram showing the major unit operations in pharmaceutical continuous direct compression (PCDC) is shown in Fig. 1 [ ]. The process begins with constant feeding of raw solid ingredients (e.g., excipients and active pharmaceutical ingredients) into the system using gravimetric feeders. These units are operated under loss-in-weight control to maintain a desired flow rate and set the correct ingredient concentrations (i.e., ingredients being fed based on a mass ratio) [ ]. Fed materials may be passed through a high shear co-mill unit to break large, electrostatic, soft lump of material that can impact the blending process and therefore the product’s content uniformity and to promote dry coating and ordered mixing, which can result in improved flow properties. The co-milled material is blended to achieve a uniform distribution of ingredients using a continuous blender. Blender types include tubular blenders, vertically stacked mills, ribbon blenders, and low shear paddle blenders [ , , , , , ]. Now, tubular blenders are the most commonly used. A lubricant, which intends to reduce powder sticking during compression, is added during the blending unit operation using a feeder. Following the blending step, the material exiting the blender is sent directly to a tablet press or capsule filling machine where the blend is compacted into tablets or filled into capsules, respectively. Each of the units presented in Fig. 1 are connected in series as part of the continuous process. Except for the blender, all can be studied and characterized separately. However, to understand the true dynamics of the system, it is required to study the line as an integrated system. Fig. 1 Pharmaceutical continuous direct compression process flow diagram
Feeders
The classroom session on feeders entailed a four-hour presentation on feeder basics, specifically aimed at members of the pharmaceutical industry. Major components, process variables, processing terminology, modes of operation, failure modes, and performance evaluation metrics were discussed during the classroom session. The lecture was followed by a hands-on training exercise on two different feeders (K-Tron MT-12 KT-20) equipment. Students were made to participate in equipment assembly, operation, and disassembly. Feeder operations discussed in the lecture were presented during the hands-on session while feeder data was collected. Data collected from the hands-on session was evaluated and the results were correlated with the information presented in the lecture. Students participated in data analysis and were evaluated on how they could implement their experience in using feeders for process development and operation.
Classroom Lecture
Feeders are the first unit operation in the line and play two critical roles: (1) maintaining the steady state of the process and (2) setting the average concentration of ingredients in the final product. Given their importance and location in the process, feeders were presented during the first day of the training. The classroom lecture presents (1) an introduction to feeder basics and (2) data analysis of feeders. The feeder basics included a discussion on the equipment and tooling selection. Several feeding units were introduced with emphasis on LOSS-IN-WEIGHT (LIW) feeders. LIW feeders can provide the required feeding accuracy for pharmaceutical processes, even when low flow rates are required as is sometimes the case for APIs and lubricants [ , ]. LIW feeders are composed of a feed hopper, a weight scale, and a screw conveying mechanism at the unit’s bottom . Inside the feeder hopper materials are contained before being dispensed out by the screws and they are all mounted on top of a weight scale that constantly monitors the weight as a function of time. Some commercially available feeders also contain an agitator at the feed hopper base to more easily convey powder from the hopper into the screw region. Arches and other hopper flow issues are reduced with the presence of a well-engineered agitator. Some examples of feeders are shown schematically in Fig. 2 . Fig. 2 K-Tron feeder with its major components symbolized. (A) Feeder hopper, represented inside the red dash-dot box, (B) flow aid system is inside the blue dashed box, and (C) conveying system shown inside the green dotted box
The LIW screw feeder conveying systems consist of screws with a defined annular volume, also known as a flight pitch volume, rotating to displace this volume as a function of time. Students were introduced to the concept of volumetric displacement calculations based on the screw dimensions and how to obtain this information from equipment vendors. When volumetric displacement is considered along with a material bulk density, it can translate into a volumetrically based mass flow rate (VBMFR). The VBMFR can be used to determine the maximum capacity of a feeder. However, as presented in the lecture, it should not be used as the sole means for computing flow rate. The equations relating mass and volumetric flow rate out of feeders as a function of screw speed implemented into the feeder model, are presented below in Table 1 . Table 1 Feeder displacement metrics Variable Units (SI) Definition Equation Volumetric displacement \( \frac{{\mathrm{Centimeter}}^3}{\mathrm{second}} \) Volume displaced by the screw per unit time. Based on screw rotations and volume of one screw flight. \( \dot{V}=\omega\ {V}_{\mathrm{screw}} \) Volumetrically based mass flow rate (VBMFR) \( \frac{\mathrm{Grams}}{\mathrm{second}} \) Mass displaced by the screw volume assuming a constant material density. Typically, does not apply for real granular systems because of material density changes during operation. \( {\dot{m}}_V=\dot{V}{\rho}_B \)
In Table 1 , V screw is the annular volume displaced by one screw rotation, ω is the screw speed, and ρ B is the material’s average bulk density.
During the lecture, instructors also covered data acquisition and analysis for feeders. Data analysis included feeder critical process parameters, feeding performance metrics, data collection from feeders, feeding control methods, feeder limits of performance, and potential sources of failure. In this section, the presentation focused primarily on understanding what variables are critical to monitor during feeder operation as well as the methods for controlling these variables to give students the needed skills to design, operate, and evaluate feeder performance. The variables shown in Table 2 are presented as the minimum critical process parameters (CPPs) that need to be monitored in SI units. Table 2 Process variables critical for feeder units Variable Units (SI) Definition Equation Feeder weight Grams Weight measured by the scale. Note that this is a force measurement, not a mass measurement. External forces can corrupt this measurement. – Screw speed \( \frac{\mathrm{Revolutions}}{\mathrm{second}} \) Angular speed at which the screws are rotating. Drive command, in percent value, can be used in lieu of screw speed since it represents the current screw speed as a function of maximum speed. Drive command must be accompanied by the maximum screw speed value. – Gravimetric feeder flow rate \( \frac{\mathrm{Grams}}{\mathrm{second}} \) Rate of weight loss derived from weight changes. Variable is reported from the control box after data filters are applied to minimize the presence of noisy values. The noise being filtered is typically attributed to the movement of the screws and powder movement, not powder weight loss. \( {\dot{m}}_G={\left(-\frac{\Delta \mathrm{Weight}}{\Delta \mathrm{Time}}\right)}_{\mathrm{filters}} \) Perturbation value Percentage Ratio between forces disturbing the weight measurement (i.e., those being perceived by the balance) and those expected due to weight loss. All values are reported as positive values with a maximum of 1000%. \( \mathrm{PV}=\frac{\left|\Delta {F}_{\mathrm{measured}}-\Delta {F}_{\mathrm{expected}}\right|}{\Delta {F}_{\mathrm{expected}}} \) ∆F expected = ∆ Weight ∙ g
Note that there is a critical difference between the volumetrically based and gravimetrically measured mass flow rates and they allude to a larger topical area: feeder controls. The controls for feeders are divided into two major control algorithms: volumetric and gravimetric controls. In volumetric control, the volumetric flow rate out of the system is attempted to be held constant by maintaining constant screw speed. During this operation, the mass flow rate out of the system is not controlled and therefore may change over time due to changes in material density entering the screws and the degree of filing of the screw channel. Volumetric control is often referred to as open-loop regime and is only recommended during refilling of the feeders for pharmaceutical operations. In contrast, gravimetrically controlled feeders are operated in a closed-loop configuration where a controller changes the screw speed (i.e., the volumetric displacement) to match a specified mass flow rate. The flow rate out is considered as the variable to correct by the controller and is computed as the negative time derivative of mass measured by the load cell [ ]. Mass-based control ensure flow rate accuracy by maintaining a tight control over the screw speed of the system. However, during refill operations, these controls are not applied, leaving the feeding operation unsupervised for a period typically lasting from 10 to 30 s. This leads to mass flow rate deviations from what has been shown in literature [ , ].
From the relation between volumetric displacement and feeder CPPs, a fifth variable can be computed: the feed factor. This variable has at least two different definitions and units, depending on the equipment manufacturer. For some, this variable represents the mass of material leaving the system per screw revolution (i.e., grams per revolution), whereas for others, it represents the maximum flow rate capacity of the unit, which can be computed by taking the grams per revolution and multiplying it by the maximum screw speed allowable by the feeder (i.e., grams per second). The equations for both metrics are shown below in Table 3 . Table 3 Introduction to the feed factor variable based on two equipment manufacturer definitions Units (SI) Equation \( \frac{\mathrm{Grams}}{\mathrm{revolutions}} \) \( \raisebox{1ex}{$\dot{m}$}\!\left/ \!\raisebox{-1ex}{$\omega $}\right. \) \( \frac{\mathrm{Grams}}{\mathrm{second}} \) \( \left(\raisebox{1ex}{$\dot{m}$}\!\left/ \!\raisebox{-1ex}{$\omega $}\right.\right)\bullet {\omega}_{\mathrm{maximum}} \)
In Table 3 , \( \dot{m} \) is the mass flow rate and ω maximum is the maximum screw speed allowed by the feeder motor. The feed factor, in both of its forms, can serve as a key metric to determine the feeders’ flow rate capacity and variability for a given material. This variable can be associated with material properties and therefore become a key critical process parameter.
Hands-on Exercises
Following the lecture, the students were split into laboratory groups composed of five people. Each laboratory group spent a total of two (2) hours with the two feeders used in the training. The feeders used are listed in Table 4 . Table 4 Feeder units used in the hands-on training exercises Feeder Screw configuration Capacity K-Tron MT-12 Coarse concave Low K-Tron KT-20 Fine concave Medium a K-Tron KT-20 Coarse concave Large a a One of the five student groups observed the medium capacity, and the other observed the large capacity feeding
During the training, the instructor performed the assembly and disassembly of the equipment, discussing each component as the process was performed. Afterwards, students proceeded to assemble the unit, giving them the opportunity to actively participate in the procedure. Once the unit was assembled, the feeder controls were explained in detail, describing how to set up and calibrate the feeder before operation. Control settings for the feeder were covered and explained based on classroom teachings. Both volumetric and gravimetric feeder control settings were presented. The feeder’s load cell was tared and calibrated using the feeder’s controlling system and a standard weight. Students proceeded to fill the unit with powder to a full hopper and calibrate the initial feed factor (in kg/h) of the unit three consecutive times. For the K-Tron feeders, the feed factor is in units of grams per second and can serve as a metric to compute the feeder’s maximum flow rate capacity. From the feed factor calibration, a flow rate of 50% was calculated. The goal of the flow rate was to maintain drive command between 20 and 80%, since those are the values concur with the equipment manufacturer’s specifications. Compap L acetaminophen was the selected material to be fed in both feeders. The feeder’s control box was connected to a laptop computer, which had the K-Tron Coperion Data Recorder® software installed. Students were shown how to connect a feeder using the software and how to collect data from the unit.
Feeder flow rate performance was characterized using the catch scale methodology presented in literature [ , ]. The catch scale experiment was set up using an Ohaus balance with a receptacle at the feeder’s end. A schematic of the setup is shown in Fig. 3 . The study’s objective was to show the students how feeders behave and compare the collected data from them versus measurements using a third-party catch scale. Students were shown the methodology to compare the flow rates between feeder—calculated due to weight loss—and catch scale—calculated via weight gain—using the data collected from both systems. The collection sampling frequency for the catch scale was set to 1 Hz. Fig. 3 Catch scale experiment set up at Rutgers to characterize the K-Tron KT-20 feeder
K-Tron MT-12 Feeder: Example of Low-Throughput Feeding
Students were introduced to the basics of low throughput feeding. A K-Tron MT-12 feeder was set up to feed Compap L at a rate under 1 kg/h (i.e., 0.27 g/s). The data collected from the feeder and catch scale were compared briefly during the exercise to show students their difference. Signal noise was shown to be one of the major factors affecting feeder performance since the amount of material being delivered by the system was small per unit time. This was important to note for the students, as they could use this information when designing or evaluating low flow rate operations and determine potential sources of process variability. Students observed the time it took for the feeder to reach steady state with a low flow rate set point and were able to determine what would be the required time for an entire process to a state of control with low powder flow rate streams.
K-Tron KT-20 Feeder: Feed Factor Comparison
Changes in the feed factor due to tooling were presented using a KT-20 feeder. Since students had the opportunity to use two screw configurations using the same feeder, they could note feed factor differences due to changing screws. The fine and coarse concave screws presented different dimensions, specifically in their pitch length and annular volume, which lead to different volumetric displacements. Both screws are shown in Fig. 4 . Fig. 4 a 10-mm fine concave screws. b 20-mm coarse concave screws
From the initial feed factor calibration, students computed the feed factor differences based on the screw type. The results are presented on Table 5 . The fine concave screw showed a 2.6-time reduction in the volume as compared to the coarse concave. This result was expected given the changes in the pitch, which can be observed from Fig. 4 . Using these results, students were then asked to compute the average volumetric displacement of the feeder using the maximum screw speed ( ω maximum = 139 RPM) and Compap L’s average bulk density. Table 5 Feed factor differences between screws for a K-Tron KT20 feeder Screw configuration Avg. feed factor (g/rev) Est. annular volume (cm 3 /rev) a Max. volumetric displacement (dm 3 /h) Fine concave 1.27 2.60 21.70 Coarse concave 3.38 6.92 57.76 a Compap L bulk density known from data and it is assumed to be constant at ρ B = 0.488 g/cm 3
The results from the maximum volumetric displacement agreed with the manufacturer’s specifications [ ], which was the overall goal of the exercise. Using this exercise, the students had an opportunity to understand the importance of selecting appropriate feeder design variables (e.g., tooling) to attain their manufacturing goals.
K-Tron KT-20 Feeder: Example of Refill and Disturbances
Students also had the opportunity to observe the impact that process disturbances (e.g., refills, vibrations, and contact) had on the K-Tron KT-20 feeder flow rate. Note that during these process disturbances, feeder flow rate calculations cannot occur since the load cell perceives other forces as a gain in weight that do not allow for a weight loss calculation. Data was continuously collected using the feeder and catch scale data collection software. Results for one of the trials are presented in Fig. 5 . Fig. 5 Feeder profiles for the exercise involving the K-TRON KT-20 feeder. a Flow rates from feeder control box (output) and computed from catch scale measurements. b Feeder screw speed as reported by feeder control box. c Feeder weight as reported by load cell. d Perturbation value as reported by feeder control box. Each of the arrows denoted with numbers represents a moment in time when a disturbance was introduced. For 1, a refill was introduced; for 2, a strong shaking of the feeder was performed; and for 3, the feeder was lightly tapped
Refill: #1
Students were shown how to enable refill and to set up the refill conditions in the control box. During operation, a refill step was performed to demonstrate how the feeder would react when the lower limit of refilling level was reached (i.e., switched from gravimetric to volumetric mode) and how feeder changed back to gravimetric mode after (1) the upper limit of the refilling level was met and (2) an extra period of refilling delay time elapsed, which could be set up in the refill condition settings. Students noted the changes in screw speed as well as the average feed factor as the refill was being performed, which occurred due to the feeder switching from gravimetric mode to volumetric mode. Students were informed that flow rate calculated during this time is a computation of the feed factor and the screw speed, not an actual reading, which means the feeder is not controlled during the refilling process. This was important for the students to understand, as it affected their view of the data outputted by the feeder control box. Students were shown how the flow rate was affected in the process, by decreasing from the set point, as seen from the catch scale results. Students were shown the difference between the feeder output and the catch scale and then encouraged to discuss how this decrease in the flow rate affect their process performance and how they could minimize this effect.
Disturbances: #2 and #3
Students were also encouraged to introduce two disturbances: one large (i.e., a forceful shake of the feeder) and one small (i.e., a light tap on the feeder). These disturbances are shown in Fig. 5 d as arrows 2 and 3, respectively. The objective of introducing the disturbance was to observe the changes on the feeder’s perturbation value (%). The data from the catch scale was used to identify the differences between the flow rate calculated by the feeder during disturbances and the catch scale collected value. Students were shown that when the feeder reached a perturbation value over 100% (case shown with arrow 2 in (Fig. 5 d), the flow rate calculation due to weight loss is replaced with an expected value and the controls switch from gravimetric to volumetric mode. This change of controls also causes the reduction in variation in the feeder screw speed in Fig. 5 b, as the gravimetric control is disengaged and no longer actively attempting to control the mass flow rate. A small deviation in the weight data is also noted for the case of the large disturbance (Fig. 5 c). The small disturbance (case shown with arrow 3 in Fig. 5 d) led to a perturbation value less than 100%. For this disturbance, the students could observe that the feeder controls remained in gravimetric (i.e., screw speed was still controlled), the weight curve was not largely disturbed, and deviations of flow rate were more closely captured.
Filters and Feeder Flow Rate Calculation
Students were shown how to analyze flow rate data posteriori. Data collected from both the feeder’s control box and catch scale were analyzed and compared. For the feeder’s control box, feeder calculated mass flow, weight, and flow rate set point were provided at 1 Hz frequency. Similarly, the weight of the receptacle as measured by the catch scale was collected at 1 Hz frequency. The unfiltered mass flow rates for the feeder and receptacle (i.e., the rate of weight loss for feeders and weight gain for the receptacle) were calculated by computing the weight difference between time points. These unfiltered mass flow rates data were described as 1 s flow rates. The results for each flow rate were compared and are shown in Fig. 6 . Fig. 6 Profiles for 1-s flow rate from feeder and catch scale measurements. The arrows indicate the process disturbances introduced in Fig. 5
Differences between the catch scale and feeder flow rate can be attributed to the inherent noise perceived by the feeder load cell. Screw and agitators turning, as well as powder moving in the hopper, affect the force noted by the feeder load cell and affects the computed 1 s flow rate. After observing the differences between the catch scale and feeder 1 s flow rates, students moved on to understand the impact of filters on feeder flow rate. One of the simplest filters available is the moving average, presented in Table 6 . This filter consists of averaging data points within a time window of length n , followed by a move of the averaging window one time step forward and re-computing the average. A moving average calculation of 5 and 30 s time-averaging windows were performed on the 1 s flow rates to characterize the dampening of feeder flow rate calculations using a filter. The results of the time-averaged 1 s flow rate were compared with the data provided by the feeder’s controlling system, which applies a company-trademarked filter. The results are shown in Fig. 7 a. Student could observe that feeder data had a much lower level of fluctuation compared to the 1 s flow rate data calculated from the scale and the 5 and 30 s time-averaging. This result was presented, and students were reminded that feeders optimize the data’s outlook by using special filters that aim to smooth vibratory fluctuations due to the screws and agitator movement. To further evaluate the differences between the flow rate fluctuation, students were shown how to compute the relative standard deviation (RSD) of flow rate. To compute the RSD for the 1 s data, with no filter used, \( \overline{\dot{m}} \) was defined as the target mass feed rate and \( \dot{m_i} \) , was the actual mass feed rate, at the i th time point. Using these variables, the RSD was calculated by equations in Table 6 . Table 6 Computation of moving average and RSD Equation name Equation Moving average \( \dot{m_j}=\frac{1}{n}\sum \limits_{i=j}^{j+n-1}{m}_i \) Relative standard deviation \( \sigma =\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n{\left({\dot{m}}_i-\overline{\dot{m}}\right)}^2}{n-1}} \) Fig. 7 a Feeder flow rate profiles for the same exercise involving the K-TRON KT-20 feeder. One-second interval time derivatives of weight scale measurements were computed. Moving average (i.e., square filtering) was applied to the resulting derivative and compared with the output calculated by feeder. b Flow rate RSD was computed for varying time averages to determine the correlation between the filter length and the performance metric. The arrows indicate the process disturbances introduced in Fig. 5
Then the RSD with different length of filter were calculated and compared with the one without any filter. Students observed that the RSD goes down as the filter length increases. These results can be found in Fig. 7 b. Clearly, when the filter length reaches the same as the length of all the data, there would be only one data point left to calculate the RSD, which leads the value of RSD to be zero. The filter length could be properly selected by the designs and settings of the downstream units particularly continuous manufacturing design. To reinforce the concepts of filtering, students were asked if unfiltered flow rate results (i.e., 1 s) should be used as process metrics. Students were taught this was not an appropriate data point, because there was too much variability on the measurement for subsequent control architectures to use the information coming from the system. Students were able to realize that flow rate filter selection was a function of both the amount of tolerable variability (i.e., process robustness) and risk acceptance.
Once students compared the differences between feeder calculated flow rate and the weight differentials from the feeder load cell, the comparison with the catch scale was performed. The flow rates calculated by the feeder and the 1-s catch scale weight are shown in Fig. 8 . The flow rate from the feeder shows much lower variability when compared to the catch scale. This result is opposite from Fig. 6 results, where the feeder 1 s flow rate was compared with the catch scale’s. Flow rate variability on the catch scale can be attributed to the oscillatory flow rate of material coming out of the feeder due to screw rotation. When a 10-s moving average filter is applied to the 1-s catch scale data, the variability decreases and yields a curve much closer to the feeder calculated flow rate. The 10-s moving average flow rate is the one plotted on Fig. 5 a. Fig. 8 Profiles comparing the 1-s flow rate and 10-s moving average flow rate for the catch scale along with the feeder calculated flow rate. The arrows indicate the process disturbances introduced in Fig. 5
Blender
Blenders were introduced in a full day session using a combination of classroom lectures and hands-on training. The classroom lecture entailed a four-hour session on fundamentals of powder blending, batch vs. continuous blending, continuous blender designs, and the key continuous blender metrics. There was emphasis on critical continuous blending concepts of mass holdup, residence time and residence time distribution (RTD), and feeder-blender pairing. Role of the co-mill in powder homogenization for a continuous direct compaction process was also discussed. In addition, a case study exhibiting the concept of arrested segregation in continuous mixing was presented [ , ]. Concepts from the lecture were then reinforced in a hands-on session. The students operated the blending setup and observed how the blender filled up with powder during start-up and reached steady state. They measured the mass holdup within the blender as a function of impeller speed and mass flow rate. Step changes were made to the concentration of the active ingredient to exhibit a RTD test. Data collected during the experiments was discussed in a short classroom session, and the results were correlated to what was explained in the lecture.
Classroom Lecture
The lecture began with a discussion on the fundamentals of powder mixing. Powder mixtures can be classified as “perfect mixtures,” “random mixtures,” “ordered mixtures,” and “textured mixtures” as shown in Fig. 9 . Definitions were explained and presented from Chapter 15 of Hand Book of Industrial Mixing [ ]. This was followed by a brief discussion on “scale of scrutiny” definitions and “sample size,” as applied to solid oral dosage forms. Fig. 9 Simulated mixtures showing a a perfect mixture and b a random mixture. Distribution of particles differing in size for c freely-flowing and d cohesive particles
This was followed by a discussion on mechanisms of mixing as classified by type of transport process, namely, convection, dispersion, and shear. Mixing mechanisms based on scale of mixing, such as, macro-mixing and micro-mixing were also discussed.
After the general background, students were introduced to continuous tubular blenders as the unit most commonly used for powder mixing in continuous manufacturing [ ]. Figure 10 shows a schematic of a convective tubular blender. This class of blenders generally consists of a hollow tube 4 to 8 in. in diameter, with a central shaft fitted with blades, known as the impeller. The impeller is driven by a motor with a variable frequency drive (VFD). An unmixed powder stream enters the blender at one end and a “homogeneous” blend exits through the other end. The blender can exhibit two states: “dynamic” and “steady.” During the dynamic state, blender process variables are overtly time dependent, typically transitioning from one target value to another. For example, during the first few seconds of run time the flow rate out of the blender is zero; then it increases asymptotically until it reaches the inlet flow rate. During the time that powder is coming into the blender but does not go out of it, the blender is filling up. The dynamics of how continuous blenders fill and behave under unsteady state operation can also be characterized. However, this was not covered in the course and hence will not be discussed here. Fig. 10 Continuous tubular blender showing distribution of material in radial cross-sections at the entrance and the exit
The mass of powder accumulated inside the blender is called the holdup. Holdup increases until the blender reaches “steady state.” At steady state, the blender variables become independent of time (except for short-lived random fluctuations around the desired value). In other rewords, the mass flow rate coming into the blender equals the mass flow rate out of it and the blender holdup remains constant. The residence time, representing the average time it takes for powder to enter and exit the blender, can be computed as the ratio between the steady state mass holdup and the flow rate into the blender.
As shown in Fig. 10 , powder mixing occurs in two directions, along the radial cross section of the tube (radial) and along the length of the tube (axial). At steady state, powder particles entering the blender’s tube experience convection in two directions along the axis: forwards and backwards. Throughout the blender, some particles experience greater convection in the forward axial direction while some experience an unusual amount of backward pushing. Thus, the level of convection experienced by particles is not uniform, but distributed. As a result, some particles might exit the tube quickly, while other particles spend an unusually long time inside the tube. There thus exists a distribution of residence times for a set of particles entering a blender at steady state. This is called its residence time distribution (RTD). Most particles stay in the blender for a time close to a certain mean value, defined as the “mean residence time.” The mass holdup within the blender, and consequently, the residence time of the material in the blender, depends on process parameters such as the speed of the impeller and the total mass flow rate of the process. The holdup and residence time also depend on design parameters such as the blade configuration and design of outlet.
During the lecture, there was considerable emphasis on the above concepts, which are crucial to understanding continuous blenders. This was followed by a discussion on the measurement of the RTD [ ].
The RTD of the blender can be measured by introducing an instantaneous pulse of a tracer material in the system or by creating a step change in the concentration of a measurable ingredient, followed by measuring the response of the unit as a function of time. Key definitions and their associated equations, which were discussed in class are listed in Table 7 .

Hands-On Exercises
The objectives of hands-on exercises were twofold. The first objective was to show the effect of process and design parameters, namely, impeller speed, blade configuration, and total mass flow rate on blender mass holdup. The second objective was to demonstrate how to perform RTD tests by introducing step changes in the concentration of a measurable ingredient.
Following the lecture, students were taken to the lab and briefed on the experimental setup, shown in the schematic in Fig. 11 , which consisted of two gravimetric loss-in-weight feeders, one feeding a mixture of microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel PH-101) and magnesium stearate and the other anhydrous Compap L. Fig. 11 Mass holdup experimental set up for the Gericke-250GM blender
The target concentration of components, set by the ratio of flow rates, consisted of ingredients in the ratio shown in Table 8 . The powder stream entered a continuous tubular blender (Gericke GCM 250), equipped with 10 blades. Powder exiting the blender was collected in a receptacle setup on a weighing scale, which constantly monitored the weight.

The effect of total flow rate, blade configuration, impeller speed, and weir design on the mass holdup within the blender was demonstrated. The experimental design executed by the students, along with the obtained results is shown in Table 9 .

To demonstrate the effects of the process and design variables on mass holdup within the blender, the line was fully cleaned and emptied before each run. Mass contained in the hopper of the feeder was measured by recording the feeder “net weight” values. The process was run at the desired experimental design point until the system reached “steady state,” which was detected when the rate of the change of the mass being collected in the collection bucket reached a steady value. The “rate of change of mass” values were read from a computer connected to the collection scale. Once the system was at steady state, all unit operations were stopped simultaneously and the net weight in the feeders was recorded. The difference in the initial and the final net weight is the total amount of material dispensed by the feeders over the run period. The mass of the total amount of material that exited the blender and accumulated in the collection container was also recorded. The difference between the total weight dispensed by the feeders and the weight of material that had exited the process was the blender mass holdup. The procedure was repeated for all the experimental design points. The results obtained for all the measurements are summarized in Table 9 . Based on this data, the students plotted correlations showing the effect of the impeller speed (Fig. 12 a), total flow rate (Fig. 12 b) and the angle of the exit weir (Fig. 12 c) on the mass holdup and the RTD of the material in the blender. As expected, the mass holdup and the residence time within the blender decreased with increasing impeller speeds, decreased with increasing mass flow rate, and decreased as the degree of openness of gates increased. These observations agreed with previous literature [ ]. The students were explained the causality of the correlations; interested readers can refer to the work of Vanarase and co-workers [ , ]. Figure 12 illustrates a subset of all the data generated by the students. Fig. 12 Correlations showing the effect of process parameters on mass holdup and space-time. a Effect of blade configuration on both space-time and mass holdup for a flow rate of 5.6 g/s.

Demonstrations on computing mass holdup were followed by a demonstration on performing RTD tests by introducing a step change in the concentration of a measurable ingredient. The setup was similar to the one used for measuring the mass holdup. The key difference between the setups was the replacement of the collection bucket in the first setup with a chute. Powder exiting the blender entered the chute. The exit of the chute was regulated by a rotary valve. The speed of the rotary valve was adjusted in a way that the mass flow rate out of the chute equaled the incoming mass flow rate, thereby ensuring steady operation. A NIR spectrometer (Bruker Matrix) was mounted on a window of the chute, as shown in Fig. 13 . The NIR monitored the concentration of the API in real time. The experiment began with a clean setup. The feeders were started, and the system was allowed to reach steady state. Steady state was determined when the level of powder in the acrylic window of the chute held steady and when the concentration of Compap L read a steady value on the NIR monitor. Once the system reached steady state, a step change in the concentration of Compap L acetaminophen was made by changing its concentration from 65% ( w / w ) to 70% ( w / w ). The system was again allowed to reach steady state at this new concentration of the API. This was followed by a second step change from 70% ( w / w ) to 60% ( w / w ). The system was again permitted to reach the new steady state. Acetaminophen concentration was continuously monitored and recorded. The concentration vs. time profile was regressed to determine the RTD parameters. Fig. 13 Residence time distribution experimental setup for the Gericke-250GM blender
Compaction
Tablet compaction in a press is the final stage of tableting procedure. The physical and mechanical properties of a tablet are significantly affected by this process [ , , , ]. Thus, a full day was spent for both the classroom lectures and hands-on exercises on this subject. Below is a full description of the materials covered in the lecture and the relevant experiments chosen for the hands-on training.
Classroom Lecture
The lecture started by identifying the advantages and disadvantages of tablets as a solid dosage form [ ]. A short introduction on the role of individual ingredients in pharmaceutical formulation during the tablet compaction and on the final tablet properties was provided [ ]. Tablet manufacturing is classified into three methods: dry granulation, wet granulation, and direct compaction. The focus of this training was on the direct compression, which refers to the compaction of the dry mixture of the individual ingredients. Regardless of how the formulation blend is prepared, the tableting stage remains largely the same.
The lecture continued with the fundamentals of powder compaction. The compaction process starts with particle re-arrangement, which refers to particles moving into closer packing. With an increase in the compaction pressure, particles deform either plastically, elastically, or they fracture into smaller particles. In most cases, more than one of the mentioned mechanisms occur [ ]. Bonds are formed between the particles, which ultimately results in consolidation. Finally, elastic recovery occurs during the decompression stage [ ].
The main stages of a compaction cycle were thoroughly explained die filling, compression, and ejection, as shown in Fig. 14 . The main types of tablet presses were introduced: mechanical and hydraulic tablet presses. In mechanical presses, the distance between the punches can be controlled and powders are compressed to constant thickness. In hydraulic presses, the force exerted on powders is the processing variable and powders are compressed to constant force. Fig. 14 Tablet compression cycle stages [ ]
Tabletability, compressibility, and compactability were introduced and elaborated on as three important terms in tablet compaction. Each term refers to a correlation between two of the following parameters: compaction pressure, tensile strength, and porosity [ ]. Table 10 lists how these parameters are calculated. The tablets considered in this training are flat faced cylindrical and the equations provided are according to this geometry. The diametrical compression test was explained as one of the conventional methods to measure the breaking strength of a tablet. Table 10 Key parameters and their associated equations. ( m , D , and t are the mass, diameter, and thickness of tablet, respectively. ρ t refers to the true density of powder, F a is the applied compaction force, and F b is the breaking force of tablet) Variable Units (SI) Equation Relative density _ \( {\rho}_r=\frac{4m}{\pi {D}^2t{\rho}_t} \) Porosity _ 1 − ρ r Compaction pressure MPa \( P=\frac{4{F}_a}{\pi {D}^2} \) Tensile strength MPa \( {\sigma}_t=\frac{2{F}_b}{\pi Dt} \) [ ]
The compression process during tableting can be characterized by the force-displacement curve, which is measured in a compaction simulator by accurate reading of upper punch force and displacement [ ]. This profile depends on the material and equipment. The area under the force-displacement curve is the work done to compress powder. The role of compaction modeling in optimization, reduction of experimental design, and parameter identification was briefly mentioned. Some well-known powder compaction equations were presented [ , , , , ]. The two most common are presented in Table 11 . Table 11 Well-known powder compaction equations. ( ρ 0 is relative apparent density of powder in absence of applied pressure, and A 1 , B 1 , A 2 , and B 2 are constant parameters) Author Equation Heckel \( \ln \left(\frac{1}{1-\rho}\right)={A}_1P+{B}_1 \) Kawakita \( \frac{\rho }{\rho -{\rho}_0}=\frac{\rho }{\rho -{\rho}_0}+{B}_2 \)
The major tablet press processing parameters are compaction force and compaction speed. The lecture ended by discussing some failure modes in tablet production including weight variability, content variability, capping or lamination [ ], sticking [ ], and low hardness [ ]. The possible reasons causing these failures were also discussed. For example, weight and content variability are mainly caused by poor flowability of the powder, whereas elastic recovery [ ], compaction speed [ ], tooling shape [ ], and residual die wall stress [ ] can be listed as key reasons for capping and lamination.
Hands-On Exercises
For the hands-on training, a mechanical linear compaction simulator (Presster, Metropolitan Computing Corp., NJ, USA) equipped with a 10-mm, flat-face B-type tooling was used to demonstrate the compaction cycle and produce tablets (Fig. 15 ). Two materials with different deformation behavior were selected: lactose monohydrate and microcrystalline cellulose (MCC, Avicel PH-102). Lactose monohydrate mainly deforms by fragmentation [ ] and microcrystalline cellulose has ductile behavior [ , ]. The two powders were separately mixed with 0.25% magnesium stearate on a weight basis using a Resodyn Acoustic Mixer operated at a frequency of 60 Hz for 2 min. Fig. 15 Presster, a linear mechanical replicator of any rotary tablet press
The first objective was to investigate the effect of the compression force on the hardness of tablets. The dosing position was set first, where the tablet weight is controlled. Next, the gap between the punches at pre-compression and compression stages was adjusted. As this distance decreases, the compression force increases. Later, five tablets at different compaction forces were made. After compaction, the tablets dimensions were measured (using a caliper) in addition to their mass (using a 0.1-mg precision balance).
For each powder, the force-displacement measurement of one tablet was extracted from the Presster and the students were asked to plot and compare the compaction pressure vs. in-die relative density profile based on the data given in Fig. 16 . Fig. 16 Compaction pressure vs. in-die relative density for MCC and lactose
The tensile strength of tablets was evaluated by diametrical compression fracture tests. This was performed using a hardness tester, where the breaking force F b was measured . Students were asked to plot the compactability (tensile strength vs. relative density). As shown in Fig. 17 a, it was observed that tensile strength increases with increasing relative density of tablets for constant tableting speeds and tablet shapes. Fig. 17 a Tensile strength vs. out-of-die relative density for MCC and lactose and b comparison of tensile strength levels of low and high sheared lactose powder mixed with MgSt
The second objective was to show how the lubricant concentration and exposure to shear affect the tensile strength of tablets. We selected the same lactose monohydrate used in the first objective. However, this time we mixed it with 2% of MgSt for 20 min in the mixer at the same intensity. Five tablets at different compaction forces were made and characterized. The students were then asked to plot and compare the first set of lactose tablets with the newly produced ones. A drop in tensile strength values was evident from the comparison plot in Fig. 17 b. Formation of MgSt film on lactose particles weakens the inter-particle bonding, and thus, tablet mechanical strength significantly reduces [ , ].
Later, the students were taken to see a 24-station rotary tablet press (Fette 1200, Germany) connected in series as part of the PCDC. On the next day, students were given a quick refresher quiz and the answers were reviewed and discussed as a group.
Material Characterization
Material characterization techniques were introduced in a full day training session by using a combination of classroom lectures and hands-on experiments. The classroom lecture entailed a four-hour session on fundamentals of raw and processed powder properties in relation to behavior of the material in different stages of a continuous manufacturing system. Powders flow behavior was first addressed due to the importance of this property in CM, particularly in feeders. Several relevant tests were described, including flow property testing, charging of powders by friction impedance measurements, and lubricant effects on blends wettability and surface energy. Finally, the characterization techniques presented in the lecture were reinforced in the hands-on session operated by both instructors and several students. The material properties of various raw materials and blends were compared to define their relation to process behavior.
Classroom Lecture
The lecture was split into two sections: flowability and surface properties. Powder properties have great impact on the way in which material behave when subjected to manufacturing processes, and as a consequence, on the metrics associated to performance of the different unit ops. For example, feeders RSD greatly depend on flow properties [ ]. It is known that micro-mixing phenomena that occur during blending is associated to lubricity which in turn affects surface properties of particles in the blend.
Flowability
The class began by analyzing the differences between behavior of powders, fluids, and solids. Powders may act as liquids when flowing. However, powders do not obey similar stress-strain relations as liquids, as they can withstand external shear stresses in equilibrium. In that aspect, they can also act as solids. Because of this dual behavior, there is no universally accepted constitutive equation (or set of equations) that describe powder flow. Therefore, the treatment is nearly always semi-empirical [ ].
The complexity of flow behavior in powders is the result of several mechanisms acting together at different length scales [ , ]. First, the intrinsic particle physical properties such as particle size, density, particle shape, surface roughness, conductivity, and tribo-electric charge tendency determine the surface interactions between particles. Second, collective properties of particles (known as bulk powder properties) such as particle size distribution and bulk density affect the system packing. In addition, powder bulk structure affects the collective behavior of the particles and consequently, macroscopic flow properties. One such property is compressibility at a certain normal stress, defined as the ratio between densities at that applied stress with respect to the tapped density. Finally, flow behavior is dependent on the processing environment and external conditions such as external stress and humidity.
Traditional indexes to measure powder structural states (tap and pour densities, Carr and Hausner indexes) and their relations with flowability and particle properties were also described. Moreover, measurement of particle size distribution through laser diffraction methodology and the indexes obtained (D10, D50, D90, D[3,2]) were introduced.
Due to the lack of a fundamental flow equations and the complexity of powder flow behavior, its semi-empirical description should be interpreted through a collection of different measurements and parameters [ ]. Diverse characterization techniques were introduced in the lecture and further reinforced in hands-on tests and their parameters were interpreted. The FT4 powder rheometer instrument (Freeman Technology, Tewkesbury, UK) allows performing different tests that describe powders flow properties under diverse conditions [ ], including shear cell test, compressibility, and dynamic flow energy. Parameters such as cohesion (C), flow function (FF), stability index (SI), and bed density as a function of normal stress (compressibility index, CI) were presented in the lecture and obtained for different powders during the hands-on session [ ].
Shear Cell
Typically, a shear cell measures a series of shear yield points as a function of decreasing normal stress (Fig. 18 a). The procedure consisted of four steps: conditioning, consolidation, pre-shearing, and shearing. By applying the Mohr circle analysis, cohesion (which represents the yield shear stress at zero applied normal stress), unconfined yield stress, major principal stresses, angle of internal friction, and flow function coefficient were extracted. Fig. 18 Schematic view of FT4 powder rheometer. a Shear cell. b Compressibility. c Dynamic flow energy
Compressibility
As a bulk property, compressibility is the measurement of how the density of a sample changes as a function of applied normal stress (Fig. 18 b). The compressibility index is automatically calculated as a percentage change of the volume. In addition, compressibility can be represented as relative density. In general, cohesive material shows larger compressibility due to lose initial packing states and sensitivity to external stress.
Dynamic Flow Energy
Dynamic flow energy testing measures the energy required to move a helical standardized shape blade through a powder bed as a function of time and blade tip speed (Fig. 18 c). This test represents the friability and force transmission between particles.
Surface Charge
Surface charge is one of the most important surface properties. Electrostatics is inevitable in pharmaceutical applications. Many of the material such as excipients and APIs are electric insulators that can easily acquire and hold charge upon friction and/or contact with other materials. The correlations between flow characteristics and electrical properties of powders have been described extensively in literature [ ]. To describe this characteristic, reasons for tribo-electricity (charging due to the collision or contact between two particles in movement) and their correlation with particle properties and external conditions were explained through case studies and examples. This phenomenon may cause the materials flow properties to change after processing. For example, the post-feeder materials were found become more cohesive. Two methodologies were described to obtain information about the possibilities that particles get charged during flow: measurement of charge density and impedance of a static powder bed. Relations between these two methodologies were exemplified from real cases in literature [ ]. Finally, advantages of the impedance method over charge density were also discussed [ ].
Surface Energy and Wettability
The concept of surface energy, cohesion, adhesion, and their inter-relations were defined in the context of the effect of those fundamental properties on powder behavior. Existing models for surface energy assessment from Zisman’s plot analysis [ ], Fowke’s approach [ ] with dispersive and polar contributions to the total energy, and Van Oss-Chaudhury’s [ ] contribution attributing a basic and acid entity to the polar component [ ] were defined. The general methodology to obtain the surface energy of a non-porous solid material, from contacting it with two or three different liquids of diverse interactions, was described. Finally, three characterization techniques to obtain wettability results from solid powder materials were introduced: capillary rise in a column (Washburn method) [ ], liquid droplet penetration [ ], and inverse gas chromatography (IGC) [ ]. The two liquid penetration techniques were described with equations on how to interpret results and obtain an “average” cosine of contact angle of water with that material. Water wettability (hydrophilicity-hydrophobicity) depends on whether the cosine is positive or negative, respectively. It is important to notice here that Washburn column’s technique does not allow to measure hydrophobic materials as liquid will not penetrate spontaneously into the column. However, a modification of the droplet method will allow to assess a hydrophobic material. It is also important to notice that to negate the effect of the test bed packing and therefore to obtain values of contact angle with respect to a liquid (water for example), it is important to compare results with a liquid that has zero contact angle (a liquid with very low surface tension, such as hexane or a polydimethylsiloxane, can be used) under the assumption that the test bed has been constructed under similar packing conditions. Finally, if several liquids are used, it is also possible to obtain an “effective” surface energy of the powder material like the solid non-porous materials.
During the hands-on experiments, measurements with two liquids were performed in different powder beds with different wetting properties and permeability. Important to note, because of the effect of packing, it is possible that a “less wettable” powder is more permeable.
IGC was not demonstrated, as these measurements take too much time and require a substantial amount of training. Nevertheless, the operating principle and the model used to obtain dispersive surface energy and polar surface energy components were explained. It was demonstrated through examples from the literature that surface energy obtained from IGC is usually higher than the one obtained by liquid penetration [ ].
Hands-On Exercises
Following the lecture, the students were separated into two groups. One group headed to flowability characterization and the other one was assigned to wettability characterization. Three characterization sections were performed: flowability, wettability, and electrostatic measurement. In the flowability section, students were trained to measure 9 kpa shear cell, compressibility, and tapped density. The dynamic flow energy test was discussed but not demonstrated by hands-on exercises. Both the drop penetration experiment and the Washburn column experiment were performed for wettability characterization. Impedance measurement was performed for electrostatic measurement.
Flowability Characterization
Performing on FT4 powder rheometer, shear cell and compressibility tests were presented individually. Afterwards, aerated and tapped density was interpreted by using AUTOTAP tapped density analyzer (Quantachrome Instruments, USA). The materials used for flowability training are listed in Table 12 . Table 12 Material list for flowability characterization Material Cohesiveness Conditioned bulk density (g/ml) Avicel PH-101 Easy flowing 0.343 Compap L Free flowing 0.488 Magnesium stearate Poor flowing, lubricant, low density 0.205
Shear Cell
The 9 kpa shear cell testing was operated and analyzed by students. Following the operation instruction on FT4 powder rheometer, the model material was initially filled into a 25-ml split vessel. After the standard running of four steps—conditioning, consolidation, pre-shearing, and shearing—a linearized yield locus on τ − σ diagram was obtained.
From the result of shear cell test, students could compare the τ − σ diagram for both materials (Fig. 19 ). Flowability index including the cohesion and the flow function coefficient were also indicated (Table 13 ) [ ]. Fig. 19 τ − σ diagram Table 13 Series values table for shear cell test Material Cohesion Flow function coefficient Angle of friction (°) Avicel PH-101 0.753 5.99 37.3 Compap L 0.203 20.0 27.3 Magnesium stearate 0.551 8.45 21.8
Compressibility
Following the instruction of the operation on FT4 powder rheometer, the model material was initially filled into a 25-ml split vessel. After the conditioning cycle and the testing cycle, the compressibility percentage was obtained as a function of normal stress (Fig. 20 ). Results show that more cohesive material exhibits larger compressibility index. Fig. 20 Compressibility percentage
Aerated and Tapped Density
Highly depending on both the particle density and packing of sample, this measurement is widely used in the characterization of flowing properties. In the first place, the powder sample went through a vibrating sieve mesh for removing large agglomerates. Afterwards, students poured the sample into a 100-ml column. Reading the actual sample volume, the measurement of aerated density was performed as the ratio of sample mass and sample volume. The column was then subjected to N vertical taps using AUTOTAP tapped density analyzer. N was determined starting from 10, until the decreasing of recorded sample volume was less than 2 ml between consecutive measurements, typically 10, 500, 750, 1250, 2250, et al. The measurement of tapped density was then calculated as the ratio of the mass to the volume of the sample. The flowing properties can be represented by Carr index and Hausner ratio as below: $$ {\displaystyle \begin{array}{l}\mathrm{Carr}\ \mathrm{index}=\frac{V_0-{V}_N}{V_0}\\ {}\mathrm{Hausner}\ \mathrm{ratio}=\frac{\rho_N}{\rho_0}\end{array}} $$
Discussion on Flowability Characterization
From the results of both shear cell and compressibility, the Compap L reflects the best flowing behavior (small cohesion value, large flow function coefficient, and small compressibility percentages). However, students would also notice that some different results can be observed from shear cell and compressibility for Avicel PH 101 and MgSt. In the shear cell, the cohesion value of MgSt is smaller than Avicel PH 101. Generally, this behavior represents better flowability for MgSt. However, the opposite tendency was observed in compressibility. This “inconsistency” means that a single flowing index is rarely enough to describe the complex nature of powder “flowability.” As the lubricant, MgSt, has small particle-particle frictional interaction, its measured cohesion value and the angle of friction is small. However, it is a common sense that MgSt exhibits poor flowability due to its low density and small particle size. Therefore, the loose initial packing of MgSt powder bed had larger volume change under applied normal stress, which was demonstrated in compressibility testing. The two tests are measuring “flowability” under different conditions, both of which are relevant to manufacturing. The more meaningful interpretation is that MgSt flows better under shear because of its compliant nature, while Avicel 101 flows better under unconfined conditions. Interested readers can also see Wang et al.’s [ ] publication on using flowability index to predict the performance of material in feeders.
Wettability Characterization (Drop Penetration)
Based on the penetration dynamics of a sessile drop deposited on a slightly compressed powder bed, the drop penetration method was developed to characterize the wettability of powders. In this method, drop volume as a function of time was plotted and analyzed as the drop penetration profile. Drop penetration experiments were performed using powder beds in a cylindrical 25 ml vessel. Powder beds were prepared using FT4 rheometer by 15 kpa shear cell test similar as was described above, while using only the conditioning and consolidation steps. Silicone oil (PDMS) was used as the reference liquid for water contact angle measurement. Generated by a manual syringe, a droplet was ejected and deposited on the powder bed. Sequences of droplet penetration images were recorded using a CCD camera as shown in the setup in Fig. 21 . Using image analysis, the penetrated volume was calculated assuming the shape of the droplets is axisymmetric. The same procedure was repeated for PDMS. The contact angle can be calculated by the dimensional analysis. More details of data analyzing was reported by Liu et al. [ ]. Fig. 21 Drop penetration setup
Blends made by students in blending hands-on excises were used as model materials to characterize wettability (Table 14 ). The graph of drop volume versus time presented the drop penetration period material shared at 150 RPM was longer than non-sheared material (Fig. 22 a) [ ]. Then, the silicone oil penetration videos were also analyzed as Fig. 22 b. Consequently, the contact angle of material was calculated by students as shown in Table 15 . The small cosine values reflected the lesser wettability of sheared material covered by the hydrophobic lubricant. Table 14 Material list for wettability characterization Formulation Blender speed 65% Compap L, 34% Avicel, 1% MgSt 150 rpm 65% Compap L, 34% Avicel, 1% MgSt No shear Fig. 22 a , b Drop penetration profile Table 15 Dynamic contact angle of blends Blender speed Cosine of the contact angle 150 rpm 0.048 No shear 0.082
Wettability Characterization Alternative Method (Washburn Column)
Llusa et al. [ ] and Oka et al. [ ] reported in detail the technique to characterize the hydrophobicity of lubricated blends of pharmaceutical excipients (see Fig. 23 ). Washburn described the phenomenon of liquid rising into the powder bed due to capillary pressure [ ]. The linear relationship between water uptake mass into the column and square root of time was considered as below to represent powder bed wettability: $$ t=\frac{\eta }{C{\rho}^2\gamma \cos \theta }{m}^2 $$ Fig. 23 Liquid rising in the Washburn column
Electrostatic Measurements
Various pharmaceutical excipients and APIs are electric insulators that can easily acquire and hold charge upon friction and/or contact with other materials. The correlations between flow characteristics and electrical properties of powders have been described extensively in literature [ ]. In this exercise, the impedance measurement was studied. The testing sample was pre-dried over-night using and oven to minimize variability due to uncontrolled water content.
The experimental setup used for impedance testing is shown in Fig. 24 . The details of the operation can be found in [ ]. By performing the test, the impedance for each frequency was calculated as the module ratio of the amplitudes of the voltage and current. Fig. 24 Impedance measurement
Process Analytical Technology
In 2004, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) established a regulatory framework to promote new technologies for real-time quality assurance [ ], including spectroscopy-based sensors [ ].The techniques described in this section are complemented with multivariate data analysis methods such as principal components analysis (PCA) and partial least squares (PLS) [ , , ] that allow the extraction of information from spectroscopic measurements. A logical extension to PAT is to use it for product release decisions, enabling the real-time release testing (RTRt) approach encouraged by the FDA and the ICH Q8 guideline [ ]. This section will also describe how an RTRt methodology was explained w.r.t. a specific case study [ ].
Classroom Lecture
The material is discussed by introducing the importance of PAT and the challenges that are commonly faced during its implementation. Besides the in-line sensors that are required to enable “built in” quality, as stated in the PAT guidance by FDA, benchtop devices that are used for offline analysis, are described too. Two types of sensor are described, namely, near infrared (NIR) and Raman. The inherent differences in their working principles were explained, particularly regarding their use in continuous tablet manufacturing. The higher chemical specificity of the Raman versus the NIR’s sensitivity to physical material attributes result in redundant yet different application of the two complementary sensors.
Spectroscopic and Data Pretreatments
Typical spectral was displayed, followed by a discussion about the differences in diffuse reflectance and transmittance measurements depending on the detector position. Scattering effects in powder samples were taught to demonstrate how this affects the baseline and slope of spectral data in diffuse reflectance [ ]. The effect of using various combination of pretreatments on the spectra to highlight the differences followed by exploratory type analysis like PCA was demonstrated. Since often within the pharmaceutical industry, spectral data is used for quantitative determinations, and it is necessary to explain how to build regression models.
Real-Time Release Testing
The significance of RTRt for continuous manufacturing was elucidated by stressing the need for continuous monitoring of the manufacturing process, including the parameters for each unit operation as well as critical material attributes of raw materials and critical quality attributes (CQAs) of the end-products. Since the need is to reduce the number of dissolution tests performed, several approaches were shown that serve this purpose. An in-house Rutgers approach based on a surrogate model for the dissolution of tablets containing acetaminophen (APAP) was taught as a case study.
Hands-On Exercises
The hands-on experiments consisted of constructing and evaluating calibration models for real-time measurements of API concentration by near infrared spectroscopy. Examples highlighted chemical variation (vibrational information in Raman and NIR) to minimize the effects due to physical differences in samples.
The purpose of each station was to get students familiarized with spectroscopic instruments, both benchtop and portable, widely used for non-destructive method development. These instruments are commonly used in industry to obtain information about active pharmaceutical ingredient concentration in tablets and powders.
Station 1: Bruker MPA (Bruker Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA) is a multipurpose analyzer of tablets, powder samples, and liquids. Samples can be analyzed by diffuse reflectance and transmittance modes. Here, both these modes of spectral acquisition were introduced. Scattering effects were also discussed and their effects NIR measurement accuracy was emphasized. The instructors also defined techniques to maximize the information from spectral data through data pretreatments such as normalization and derivatives.
Station 2: Raman PhaT probe (Kaiser Optical Systems, Inc., Ann Arbor, MI, USA) was described for two purposes. One is to establish differences between scattering and absorption vibrational spectroscopy and the difference between fundamental peaks versus combination and overtone bands. This is also one of the primary differences between Raman scattering and NIR absorption. The source, filter, and detector are explained and why this is critical for Raman measurements. The other purpose is to introduce the Raman technique and explain why this is complementary to infrared spectroscopy, thereby encouraging multiple measurement techniques.
Station 3: Bruker Matrix (Bruker Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA) is a process instrument. Participants are at this point familiar with spectroscopic measurements and now instructors introduce a process instrument. The features of this instrument allow them to understand the importance of fast measurements for monitoring and control purposes. Variation in resolution and in number of averaged scans is included. Participants are encouraged to estimate the inverse squared root relationship between the scan numbers and noise. The interferogram is extracted from the instrument and the difference between a dispersive and a Fourier transform is stated.
Another portable NIR, the microNIR (Viavi Solutions Inc., Milpitas, CA, USA) was shown to the participants as a handy NIR unit that is often used to monitor processes. The differences between this device and the Matrix were listed to indicate how although there are some tradeoffs in terms of resolution, spectral range, the two devices can achieve comparable results.
Station 4: The mPAT 3D Raman Imaging (H2Optx, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA) was introduced to the participants as a relatively new technique for considering the microstructure of a sample. After showing the workings of the device, the significance of the results obtained was explained in the following manner: often, the microstructure is the link to the processing parameters and the sample performance. Knowledge of the ingredient spatial distribution is very helpful to understand deviations from normal sample behavior. Additionally, this information can help in the production of “perfect” samples by adjusting the parameters to ensure a good sample microstructure.
Hands-On Method Development
Calibration models were prepared in advance using 1.5 kg samples. The setup included a NIR interface consisting of a chute with a window where the NIR instrument was attached to acquire spectra in diffuse reflectance mode. The level of powder was controlled by a rotary valve and participants had access to the control panel to observe the variation in flow. Five calibration blends were used with the concentration range of 10–20% w / w .
Spectral data was selected for calibration (67%) and test (33%). Plots of NIR data for different concentration are visualized and trends in the data are represented by principal components analysis.
Partial least squares (PLS) calibration models were prepared by using the gravimetric value from the analytical weight scale used to create the standards. Spectral data is used as X and the reference values as Y for PLS models. Root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) was calculated for the test set for each calibration model and the lowest five models were saved for real-time measurements.
Real-Time Measurements
Five calibration models were uploaded to the Opus Software from Bruker (Billerica, MA, USA) and the same experimental setup was used. Test blends at the target concentrations were used and real-time measurements were shown on the computer screen. Participants had access to actual measurements each 6 s with plots based on time vs. predicted values.
Because of the PAT training exercises, the participants not only increased their knowledge and experience from using different PAT sensors but also develop intuition regarding when and how these sensors can be used. One of the key aspects of PAT is knowing which device is appropriate for the attribute being measured. A sensor’s usefulness comes not only from its ability to measure the attribute of interest but also with respect to its measurement range, sensitivity, resolution, and location/placement. The students were taught the implementation of specific sensors for monitoring specific batch and continuous processes, emphasizing the sample-sensor interface. During the training, the participants learn how to use the information received during the lectures about basic concepts of spectroscopy, data preprocessing, and multivariate analysis. Overall, this leads to the understanding of how monitoring a process outcome can be used for improving product quality and reducing “failed” products. To implement quality by design (QbD), this knowledge can lead to an “analysis by design” concept.
Pharmaceutical Process Control
Process control is the last essential step needed to manufacture the desired product with pre-specified quality as mandated by regulator (e.g., FDA). When the continuous process is integrated with a real-time distributed control system that manipulates inputs to achieve desired outputs, it is called a “closed-loop process.” A closed-loop process is used to ensure the achievement of desired predefined product quality. Under closed-loop operation, the raw and intermediate critical material attributes (CMAs), the critical process parameters (CPPs), and the final product critical quality attributes (CQAs) are measured in real time. Since these values are recorded in real time, the corrective actions are taken in real time, using feedback and/or feedforward controllers. A controller can be defined as a mathematical equation or algorithm able to calculate the quantitative actions.
The trainees need to be familiar with continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing process unit operations, process model and PAT to full understand process control. Therefore, the training on process control was been provided at the end of training session. The training curriculum included 6 h of class room lecture and a half day of hands-on training.
Classroom Lecture
Five topics were covered in class room lecture: (1) introduction to process control, (2) design and evaluation of control system for continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing, (3) control infrastructure and real-time monitoring of critical control variables, (4) integration of unit operations with a centralized control platform and plant automation, and (5) implementation of control system and closed-loop operation.
In this training session, the concept of the control system was introduced, followed by an explanation of the advantages of closed-loop operation over open loop. Since the knowledge of process dynamics is essential for successfully design of efficient process control, detailed training on process dynamics was provided. Both feedback and feedforward control strategies were explained to trainees. Single loop and cascade control architectures were taught. Classical PID and advanced MPC algorithm were presented. Merits and demerits of each control strategy and algorithm were explained.
The concept of open-loop and closed-loop process is illustrated in Fig. 25 [ ]. If there are no variations in the raw material properties, and if there are no process disturbances, then one may be able to manufacture the product with the desired quality by running a steady process. The assumption that such an operation is possible is, in fact, one of the underlying assumptions, often inaccurate, of classic “process validation.” In this open-loop operational scenario, the product quality can be fitted, but cannot be guaranteed. In practice, there are always variations in raw material properties, as well as process disturbances. In some cases, these variations do not affect product quality significantly; however, in other cases, it is very difficult to achieve the desired product quality for open-loop operation, and one must take corrective action to achieve consistent quality. Fig. 25 Illustration of closed-loop and open-loop operation (adapted from [ ])
In closed-loop operation, on the other hand, accurate sensors for real-time monitoring of critical process variables are placed at appropriate locations, and appropriate controllers are added so that the critical process variables can be controlled automatically in real time. The goal is to achieve the desired product quality irrespective of variations in raw material properties and process disturbances. The control system is also useful to manufacture product safely, to satisfy flexible market demands, to reduce manufacturing expenses (e.g., labor cost), and to assure regulatory requirements.
At the end of the lecture, a set of questions were provided to trainees for performance evaluation. Most of the trainees could answer the questions accurately.
Design and Evaluation of Control System for Continuous Pharmaceutical Manufacturing
In this lecture, the methods and rules for design of an efficient control system was explained. This included identification of critical control variables, pairing of control variables with actuators, identification of suitable sensor for real-time monitoring, selection of control algorithm, implementation of control system into process model, and closed-loop performance evaluation.
The overall control architecture of a continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing process includes a local level control system and a supervisory control system. As mentioned, the local level control system (IPC) is unit operation centric, while the supervisory control system governs the overall plant in an integrated manner. The local level controllers are normally built into the unit operations, but their performance needs to be evaluated. A supervisory control system is externally added, and its function is more complex; therefore, more attention needs to be paid to its design and evaluation.
The control architecture needs to be designed carefully before implementing it into the manufacturing plant. The design of the control architecture involves the identification of critical control variables, pairing of control variables with suitable actuators, selection of a real-time monitoring tool for each control variable, selection of controllers and tuning of controller parameters, implementation of control loops into a process model, and performance evaluation of the control system [ ]. The different steps required for designing a control architecture are described in the following paragraphs.
The first step is to identify the critical process variables that need to be controlled. The critical control variables can be selected based on sensitivity analysis combined with process understanding. Sensitivity analysis can be used to analyze the sensitivity of CQAs to process variables. The process variables that have the most significant impact on CQAs should be controlled. The variables that are not self-regulating must be kept within the equipment and operating constraints. If a specific variable, or variables, significantly interact with controlled variables, then the former should also be controlled. The set points of control variables can be obtained from design space analysis. The design space can be generated through optimization.
The next step is to select an actuator for each control variable. The general criteria to select an actuator is that it should have a large effect on the corresponding controlled variable. The controlled variable should be most sensitive to the selected actuator with respect to other actuator candidates. The selected actuator should rapidly affect the controlled variable, and if possible, it should also affect the controlled variable directly, rather than indirectly, and there should be minimum delay time. The relative gain array (RGA) method can be used to pair the controlled variables with corresponding actuators [ ]. In the RGA method, first, the relative gain should be calculated for each pair of controlled variables and actuators and then a relative gain array matrix should be constructed. Relative gain is the ratio of open-loop gain and closed-loop gain. The open-loop gain can be obtained by partial differentiation of a control variable function, with respect to an actuator candidate, if other actuator candidates are constant. This calculation is virtually identical to performing sensitivity analysis. Similarly, the closed-loop gain can be calculated by partial differentiation of the control variable function, with respect to an actuator candidate, if all other controlled variables are constant. The elements of the relative gain array matrix are the relative gains. The values in the array describe the relationship between the inputs (actuators) and outputs (control variables). Negative values indicate an unstable relationship, while a value of zero indicates no relationship. A value of one indicates that the specific input variable is the only influence on that output variable. A value between zero and one indicates an interaction among the control loops.
Subsequently, the possibility of cascading the control loops needs to be investigated. In cascade arrangements, the inner and outer loops need to be integrated such that the outer loop provides the set point for the inner loop. The inner loop is called the slave loop while the outer loop is called the master loop. Cascade control loops can improve performance in many instances. For example, when a large time delay is involved and/or when disturbances affect a measurable intermediate that directly affects the controlled variable. The cascade control system however is more difficult to tune and requires a larger number of variables to be measured in real time. In cascade arrangement, the dynamics of the inner (slave) loops should be significantly faster than the outer (master) loop.
It is often desired to couple a feedback control system with feedforward control capabilities. The next step is to thus identify the feedforward control loops [ ]. The basic concept of a feedforward control is to measure important disturbance variables and take corrective action before the disturbances upset the process. The feedforward controller therefore takes into account the known and predictable effect of raw material variability and process disturbances proactively. The precise control of the quality of the pharmaceutical product requires corrective actions in the process/raw material variability before product quality can be influenced. The capability of using both feedforward and feedback control to respond to real-time disturbances throughout the multiple unit operations is one of the key advantages of continuous manufacturing [ ]. An illustrative example of combined feedforward/feedback control loops is shown in Fig. 26 . As shown in the figure, the measured disturbance is the input to a feedforward controller. The output of feedforward controller has been integrated with the feedback control loop. The feedforward controller is a mathematical model relating input (disturbance) with output (actuator). The feedforward control loops require additional sensors for real-time monitoring of process disturbances. Fig. 26 Combined feedforward/feedback control
The next step in the design of the control architecture is the selection of real-time monitoring tools for critical control variables, slave control variables, and feedforward variables. The selection of sensors is important in the design phase of the control architecture because the performance of various sensors could vary from manufacturer to manufacturer. These sensor specifications can have significant impact on control loops performance. Therefore, on changing the sensors, the control loops might need to be re-tuned. Furthermore, since sensors typically introduce both error and delays, sensor models need to be integrated with the process model before testing the control architecture. Different performance criteria (e.g., accuracy, precision, operating range, response time, resolution, sensitivity, drift) and cost need to be considered before selecting a sensor [ ]. Many pharmaceutical processes require the implementation of spectroscopic techniques to monitor different process variables [ ].
After identifying control variables, actuators, and sensors, the decision on the type of controllers to be used for each control loop needs to be made. There are two main classes of controllers available, proportional integral derivative (PID) controllers and model predictive controllers (MPC). Within the PID structure, P, I, and D can be used individually or in any combination as per requirement.
A PID controller is simpler, easier to implement, easier to use, and in most cases, works very well. The performance of PID controllers can be substantially limited by process nonlinearity, process dead time, process interactions, and process constraints. A dead time compensator (e.g., Smith predictor) might need to be integrated with PID controller if the process is dead time dominated.
MPC refers to a family of control algorithms that employ an explicit model to predict the future behavior of a given process over an extended prediction horizon [ ]. These algorithms are formulated as a performance objective function, which is defined as a combination of set point tracking performance and control effort. This objective function is minimized by computing a profile of controller output “moves” across a control horizon. The first controller output move is implemented, and then, the entire procedure is repeated at the next sampling instance [ ]. MPC has proven to be a very effective control strategy and has been widely used in oil refining and chemical manufacturing. There are several advantages of using MPC. For example, MPC is better than PID when handling multivariable control problems, process constraints (e.g., actuator limitations, constraints on controlled variable, system constraints), process delays, system disturbances, equipment (sensor/actuator) failure, and process variable interactions. It is important to note, both PID and MPC need to be tuned using appropriate methods. Of the two, MPC is easier to tune. The Ziegler and Nichols (1942) method can be used for the tuning of a PID controller [ ], while an optimization-based method (e.g., ITAE (integral of time absolute error)) can be employed to tune MPC [ ]. After designing the control architecture, it needs to be implemented into the process model for in silico performance evaluation before implementing it into the plant.
Control Infrastructure for Continuous Pharmaceutical Manufacturing
In this lecture, the development and maintenance of control infrastructure for continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing was introduced. The required control hardware and software components were explained. As shown in Fig. 27 , the following software packages are currently used for implementation of control system: DeltaV, SynTQ, SiPAT, PCS7, Process Pulse 1, Process Pulse 2, OLUPX (64 bits), Kepware, JDSU software, Bruker software, Raman software, PI, and MATLAB. Fig. 27 Combined feedforward/feedback control
Integration of Unit Operations with a Centralized Control Platform and Plant Automation
In this lecture, the integration of different continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing unit operations with a centralized control platform was explained. Three types of communication protocols commonly used in pharmaceutical industry were described: OPC (OLE process control), fieldbus, and serial ports. Feeders were integrated with control platform (DeltaV, PCS7) via field bus devices (profibus, DeviceNet). Blenders and Co-mill were integrated via serial ports. The tablet press was integrated with control platform (DeltaV, PCS7) via OPC.
Implementation of Control System and Closed-Loop Operation
In this lecture, the implementation of control system into continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing pilot plant was explained in detail. A detailed, step-by-step procedure to implement and verify the control architecture in an actual plant has been presented by Singh et al. [ ]. The key challenge is enabling communication between the real-time process monitoring sensors, their software, the data management tool, the control platform, and the plant actuators. Each component of the sensing and control framework communicates through its own language. Discussed below is a summary of the work required to enable these multilingual components to communicate accurately and efficiently, thereby enabling closed-loop control.
The physical sensor measures a material attribute (e.g., blend composition) or a process parameter (e.g., compression force) and creates a representative signal. In the case of spectroscopic sensors, the generated signal is multivariate in nature and thus needs to be regressed to an ordinary number. The regressed signal is sent to the data management software. The data management tool communicates this signal to the control system, typically through an OPC (OLE process control) protocol, in addition to performing several other functions. The control system assimilates this signal and decides on the necessary corrective actions. The process hardware or the actuators receive directions from the control system and implement the corrective action to the plant to bring the CQA/CPP back to its set point. Each of these communication steps, considerations during implementation of each step, and commonly available platform technologies to set up each communication junction have been briefly explained to trainees.
At the end of the lecture, the control and operation interface were explained so that the trainees can understand how to control the plant. The operating and control user interface for a direct compaction continuous tablet manufacturing pilot plant is shown in Fig. 28 . As shown in the figure, four feeders (one API feeder, two excipient feeders, one lubricant feeder), mill, blender, and tablet press are related to the control platform. Note that each unit operation can also be run individually, if deemed necessary. Operational parameters (e.g., set points and actual values) have been displayed in real time for each unit operation. Fig. 28 Plant operating and control user interface
Hands-On Exercises
After classroom training, hands-on training was provided. The trainees learned how to implement the basic PID as well as MPC configurations. The following topics were covered during hands-on training: (1) integration of control hardware and software, (2) real-time monitoring of critical control variables, (3) implementation of control loops into control platform, (4) tuning of PID controller, (5) development of MPC model, and (6) closed-loop operation.
Through the training on “pharmaceutical process control,” the trainees developed the ability to design and implement the control system into the pilot plant. The trainees should be able to quickly identify the critical control variables, corresponding actuators, suitable control architecture, and efficient control algorithm via virtual experimentations. Finally, the trainees develop awareness of control hardware and software integration, control loop implementation, and closed-loop plant operation.
Continuous Integrated Line
Once trainees have gone through the training on the unit operations (feeders and blenders) and PAT (NIRS), they were introduced to the integrated continuous manufacturing line. The advantage of exposing trainees to the continuous line is to demonstrate how the individual unit operations are integrated. Participants learned how process parameters from a unit op directly affects the subsequent process steps and were explained the importance of understanding the dynamics of the line. One example was the dynamic response of the line to a change the RPM of the continuous blender. If the RPM is decreased, the holdup of the blender increases. Therefore, the steady state bed height in the transition chute drops unless the turret speed of the tablet press is also decreased. All these changes affect residence time distributions [ ]. Ultimately attendees can see how changes in formulation can result in different dynamics throughout the line and could also affect quality attributes of the finished products.
At Rutgers University, the continuous line consists of three floors. In the top floor, up to four feeders can be placed. The blender and an additional feeder (for lubricant) are located on the second floor. The ground floor is where the PAT, tablet press, and controls are located. The continuous line was operated in an open-loop configuration. During open-loop operation, control tools are used to monitor operating parameters, i.e., feeder and tablet press data, and PAT, i.e., predicted API wt%; however, there is no instruction relayed to the unit operations. This allows the experimenter to observe the natural dynamics of the line without interference of the control system. The feeder and tablet press are operated manually by instructors on the third and ground floor, respectively. The blender speed was held constant.
The students were split into four groups. One group on each the third and second floors, one group with the tablet press, and the fourth group with the PAT and controls. Each group remained at each location for approximately 30 min and then was rotated between the other stations. This allowed the teams to experience each step of the process and interact with the trainers during that time. During each 30 min run, one step change in concentration was performed (Fig. 29 ). A step up was performed for groups 1 and 3, while a step down was performed for groups 2 and 4. Fig. 29 Weight percent of API for an RTD step down and step up
The experiment consisted of feeding, blending, and compressing a tertiary material blend, consisting of Compap L, Avicel 101, and magnesium stearate. The MgSt was fed from the second floor while the Avicel and Compap were fed from the top floor. A Bruker Matrix was fitted to the transfer chute between the blender and the tablet press to monitor real-time content uniformity of the Compap L. A schematic of the Rutgers University continuous manufacturing line appears in Fig. 30 . Fig. 30 Schematic of the Rutgers University continuous manufacturing line
Based on experiments performed in in the feeder training session, the optimal screw was used for the individual materials. Fine concave screws were used for MgSt and coarse concave screws for both the Avicel 101 and Compap L. Avicel 101 was fed using the B gearbox K-Tron KT20 feeder, and Compap L was fed using a C gearbox K-Tron KT20 Feeder. The continuous line was operated at a total throughput of 30 kg/h. For the low dose (45% API), Compap L is 45 wt% of the formulation, Avicel 101 is 54 wt% and, MgSt is 1 wt%. For the high dose (55% API), MgSt remains at 1 wt%, Compap L is 55 wt%, and Avicel 101 is 44 wt% of the formulation. The feed rates for the two doses appear in Table 16 . Table 16 Individual component feed rate (kg/h), for the two doses, based on an overall throughput of 30 kg/h Material Individual component feed rate (kg/h) 45 wt% API dose 55 wt% API dose Compap L 16.5 13.5 Avicel 101 13.5 16.2 MgSt 0.3 0.3
The PAT calibration model was created offline, prior to testing in preparation of the run. Trainees could see the how long it was required for the initial transition to start appearing in the chute and how much longer time for the system to stabilize at the final concentration.
Target tablet thickness and weight was determined previously offline. Prior to the step change, tablets were monitored to determine if they had reached a steady state. Once the step change reaches the press, trainees saw how press parameters were changing until they reached stabilized values.
Evaluation
After the classroom and hands-on exercises for each section, the instructors and students had an opportunity to review the knowledge gained in the training by conducting a brief evaluation. Students were given a quiz (attached in the Appendix ) with questions covering each major subject.
