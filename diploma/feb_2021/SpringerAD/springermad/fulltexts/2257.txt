Introduction
Wilson’s disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism caused by mutations in the ATPase copper transporting beta ( ATP7B ) gene, which encodes a copper-transporting P-type ATPase primarily expressed in liver and brain. A broad spectrum of mutations in ATP7B leads to toxic deposition of copper in liver and brain giving rise to a wide range of hepatic and neurological features, such as low plasma ceruloplasmin level, high urinary copper, dystonia, Parkinsonism, gait disturbances, and rigidity along with Kayser Fleischer ring (K–F ring) (Das and Ray ). A large number of mutations have been reported in ATP7B (Todorov et al. ). Interestingly significant phenotypic variation has been noticed between monozygotic twins with the same ATP7B mutation highlighting the potential involvement of modifier loci (Kegleyet al. ). Potential modifier genes, such as apolipoprotein E ( APOE ), human prion-related protein ( PRNP ), methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase ( MTHFR ), and divalent metal transporter 1 ( DMT1 ) have been proposed to be associated with the clinical course of the disease (Kieffer and Medici ).
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is essential for differentiation and survival of the neurons, modulating synaptic plasticity and synaptic transmission (Mizui et al. ). It regulates long-term potentiation and long-term depression functions in the hippocampal and cortical neurons, thus affecting learning and memory (Mizui et al. ). Metal ions may influence the BDNF activity and it is well known that the alteration of Cu 2+ homeostasis is a prominent factor in the development of neuropathologies (Travaglia et al. ). BDNF is initially synthesized as a precursor protein (i.e., prepro-BDNF) in the endoplasmic reticulum. Following cleavage of the signal peptide, pro-BDNF is converted to mature BDNF and BDNF pro-peptide. BDNF as dimer binds to two receptors of distinct classes: the type B tyrosine kinase receptor of the tropomyosin-related kinase family (TrkB) and the p75 receptor, which is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family (Mizui et al. ). Previous reports suggest that BDNF polymorphisms and reduced BDNF expression in human brains are closely related to the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders (Autry and Monteggia ).
A common single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in BDNF , rs6265 (c.G196A), which results in a change of valine to methionine amino acid at codon 66, presents in the pro-domain region of the BDNF pro-peptide serving as a bioactive molecule for neurons. This SNP has been associated with abnormalities in memory, learning, and neuropsychiatric functions (Mizui et al. , ). A functional promoter polymorphism, rs56164415 (c.C270T), of the BDNF gene has been extensively studied in schizophrenia and Alzheimer’s disease (Watanabe et al. ). Bioinformatics analysis revealed that C>T substitution causes loss of transcription factor binding, which may alter the transcriptional efficacy (Cartharius et al. ).
Dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) is encoded by the DRD2 gene, which is located on chromosome 11q22.2 in humans (Klein et al. ). Reduced striatal dopamine levels have been observed in WD patients (Nyberg et al. ). Animal studies have indicated decreased DRD2 expression during copper overloading (De Vries et al. ). Single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) studies have shown postsynaptic loss of dopamine D2 receptors in striatum of WD patients (Oder et al. ; Westermark et al. ). Interestingly, WD patients also exhibit reduced bindings of dopamine ligands to dopamine receptors on lymphocytes probably due to damaged dopamine receptors resulting from copper toxicity (Członkowska et al. ). DRD2 has been found to be associated with Parkinson’s disease, dystonia, addiction, and schizophrenia (Noble et al. ).
The Taq1A polymorphism (dbSNP rs1800497; A2/A1 or C/T), located ~ 9.5 kb downstream from DRD2 in exon 8 of ankyrin repeat and kinase domain containing 1 ( ANKK1) gene, has been investigated extensively (Blum et al. ) in neurological diseases. The A1 (T) allele of this polymorphism has been associated with reduced density of striatal dopamine D2 receptors and has been associated with increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease among African Americans (Blum et al. ). It is worth mentioning that the Hap-Map project revealed that the studied Taq1A polymorphism, although present in the exon 8 of ANKK1 gene, downstream of DRD2 locus, is in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with other DRD2 variants but not with any of the ANKK1 polymorphisms, and has therefore been considered to have regulatory implications for DRD2 expression (Munafo et al. ).
So far, about 150 ATP7B mutations have been identified in Indian WD patients ( http://www.igdd.iicb.res.in/IGDD/home.aspx ). Interestingly, a Copper metabolism MURR1 domain containing protein 1 (COMMD1) mutation has been associated with abnormally high urinary copper in one patient (Gupta et al. ). Again, we have found association of APOE and PRNP polymorphisms as modifiers of susceptibility and clinical features among Indian WD patients (Roy et al. ). However, all the variable clinical features of WD cannot be explained on the basis of these genes. The roles of BDNF and DRD2 polymorphisms have not been tested among Indian WD patients for their potential to modify the clinical course of WD. Hence, the objective of this study was to test the association between genetic variations in BDNF and DRD2 with the susceptibility and clinical features of WD in the Indian context.
Materials and Methods
BDNF and DRD2 Polymorphism
Genotyping of two polymorphisms in the BDNF gene, i.e., rs6265 (p.Val66Met/c.G196A) and rs56164415 (c.C270T), and rs1800497 (Taq1A; A2/A1or C/T) of the DRD2 / ANKK1 was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by restriction enzyme digestion. PCR was carried out in 20 µL reaction volume using 80 ng of total genomic DNA with Go Taq Green PCR master mix (Promega, India) using specific primers for BDNF and DRD2 / ANKK1 (Supplementary Table 1). All the PCR products were electrophoresed in 6% polyacrylamide gel; the amplicons were detected after ethidium bromide (EtBr) staining. The PCR amplicons for BDNF (rs6265 and rs56164415) and DRD2 / ANKK1 (rs1800497) were further subjected to restriction digestion using New England Biolab (NEB) enzymes incubating at optimum temperature for 3 h (Supplementary Table 1). The digested products were electrophoresed on 7% polyacrylamide gel. The genotypes for 25% of the samples were further confirmed using bidirectional Sanger sequencing (ABI3130XL; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The details of sequencing primers are available on request.
Study Subjects
A total of 164 symptomatic unrelated WD patients comprising 60 female and 104 male individuals participated in this study. Clinical and biochemical evaluations of the patients were performed at the Bangur Institute of Neurosciences, Kolkata; the National Medical College, Kolkata, West Bengal, India ( n = 142); and the King Edward Memorial Hospital, Pune, Maharashtra, India ( n = 22) as previously described (Mukherjee et al. ). A total of 270 healthy individuals (58 females and 212 males)lacking any personal or family history of neurological diseases, collected from general population from Kolkata, India served as controls. The controls and WD patients were mostly from the Indo-European linguistic group. Informed written consent was provided by all the participants. WD patients’ blood collection, DNA isolation, and screening of ATP7B were done previously as described (Mukherjee et al. ). The diagnosis of WD patients was done following Sternlieb’s criteria (Sternlieb ). Decreased serum ceruloplasmin level, elevated urinary copper, presence of K–F ring, abnormal hepatic functioning, motor and neuropsychiatric deficits were taken as the key features to identify a WD patient. Neurological features include the presence of dystonia, tremor, rigidity, gait disturbances, drooling, dysphagia, dysarthria, and psychiatric disturbances. Neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms were evaluated by our clinical collaborators using detailed questionnaires and performance-based tasks. The mean age ± standard deviation (SD) of the WD patients selected for our study was 11.68 ± 5.61 years, ranging from 1.5 to 30 years. Age at onset of symptoms of WD was documented based on patients’ history and available medical records. The median age ± SD of the control subjects was 46 ± 8.5 years, ranging from 21 to 76 years.
Statistical Analysis
Allele and genotype frequencies among patients and controls for the BDNF Val66Met and C270T polymorphisms and the DRD2 / ANKK1 Taq1A polymorphism were compared by 2 × 2 contingency Chi-square analysis (95% CI) using JAVASTAT ( http://statpages.info/ctab2x2.html ) and Quantpsy software ( http://www.quantpsy.org/chisq/chisq.htm ). The p value < 0.05 from Fisher Exact test was considered to be significant variation within the groups categorized on variable phenotypes of WD patients. A two tailed student’s t test has been performed to compare between the mean ages of the WD patients carrying at least one A (methionine) allele and GG (Val/Val) homozygous genotype for rs6265 (val66met) polymorphism of BDNF gene. In addition, logistic regression analysis was performed using Logistic regression calculating page (statpages.info/logistic.htm) to evaluate the possible association between independent variables ( BDNF and DRD2 genotypes, age, and sex) and age at onset of symptoms among WD patients and rigidity. Bonferroni corrections were applied to adjust for multiple testing.
Results
Comparing the allelic and genotypic distribution of BDNF and DRD2 polymorphisms among 164 WD patients and 270 controls revealed that the C allele [ p value: 0.027; OR (95% CI) 0.666 (0.489–0.907)] and CC genotype [ p value: 0.010; OR (95% CI) 0.533 (0.352–0.806)] of BDNF C270T polymorphism are likely to have protective role, being significantly overrepresented among controls. Our study also revealed a significant association of DRD2 Taq1A polymorphism, where A1A1 genotype [ p value: 0.018; OR (95% CI) 2.307 (1.236–4.317)] were significantly overrepresented among WD patients compared to controls thus posing risk. No association was found in case of BDNF Val66Met polymorphism (Table 1 ). None of the selected SNPs of BDNF and DRD2 showed deviation from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in the control population.

Our WD patient pool comprised 142 cases from eastern part of India (Kolkata) and 22 individuals from the western part of India (Pune). To rule out the possibility of population bias, we run the analyses including all subjects as well as without the smaller western Indian sub-sample, with essentially the same results, with one exception: the Bonferroni-corrected association between the minor BDNF C270T allele and WD was no longer significant in the pure eastern Indian sample (Table 1 ). To further rule out the possibility of a skewed genotype distribution, which may have influenced the overall association with respect to WD, random Bootstrap sampling was carried out within the total WD patient dataset for replicates using 82 samples each. At least eight of the ten replicates presented consistent associations for BDNF C270T and DRD2 Taq1A polymorphisms.
The WD patients included in our study had variable ages of onset ranging from 1.5 to 30 years. The patients also manifested various degrees and severity of hepatic and neurological features, such as serum ceruloplasmin level, urinary copper level, tremor, rigidity, dysarthria, cognitive impairment, and neuropsychiatric disturbances. Aiming to explain this heterogeneity, the BDNF and DRD2 allele and genotype distributions were analyzed within WD patients.
Our analysis revealed that the BDNF G allele encoding Valine [ p value: 0.003; OR (95% CI) 0.323 (0.517–0.657)] and GG (Val/Val) genotype [ p value: 0.012; OR (95% CI) 0.315 (0.134–0.734)] were significantly preponderant among WD patients with an age of onset ≥ 10 years (Table 2 ). The WD patients carrying at least one BDNF A (Methionine) allele had an earlier age of onset (10.16 ± 4.72 years) compared to GG (Val/Val) genotype carriers (12.45 ± 5.4 years) ( p = 0.015). In addition, the DRD2 Taq1A the A1 allele [ p value: 0.003; OR (95% CI) 2.226 (1.324–3.750)] and A1A1 genotype [ p value: 0.018; OR (95% CI) 3.500 (1.326–9.482)] were significantly more frequent among WD patients with rigidity compared to those without rigidity (Table 3 ). However, we did not find any significant difference in the age of onset between these two groups (11.84 ± 5.08 years vs. 10.94 ± 4.65 years; p = 0.317). To investigate whether the DRD2 Taq1A polymorphism is regulating the rigidity as an independent phenotype, we performed the analysis between WD patients with rigidity and WD patients without rigidity along with controls who did not have any personal or family history of neurological diseases. Interestingly the association also held true in this case (Supplementary Table 2).

It is worth mentioning that since we did not have complete records for all the parameters for all the 164 patients, studies of the mentioned endophenotypes were carried out on a subset of WD patients based on the available clinical data (Supplementary Table 3).
Except for the significant associations between BDNF Val66Met and age of onset and DRD2 Taq1A and rigidity, no significant differences in allele or genotype frequencies were found with respect to any of the other clinical phenotypes tested. We did not observe any significant association for the selected variants comparing the WD cases and control with respect to gender (Supplementary Table 4). We did not find any significant association of any allele or genotype of BDNF C270T polymorphism with any clinical endophenotype studied among WD patients (data not shown).
Logistic regression analysis was performed within the patient sample with different genetic models (additive, dominant, and recessive) while analyzing the association between the BDNF Val66Met and DRD2 Taq1A polymorphisms and age at onset of symptoms and rigidity, respectively. The analysis revealed BDNF Val66Met polymorphism [additive model p value: 0.002, OR (95% CI) 0.3530 (0.1817–0.6858), recessive model p value: 0.003, OR (95% CI) 0.3153 (0.1448–0.6864)] to be significantly associated with age of onset of the disease, while the DRD2 Taq1A polymorphism [additive model p value: 0.029, OR (95% CI) 1.6245 (1.0508–2.5115), recessive model p value: 0.0307, OR (95% CI) 2.4261 (1.0668–5.5178)] was significantly associated with rigidity among WD patients. The results of logistic regression analysis have been provided in Tables 4 and 5 .

Discussion
Polymorphic variants in the modifier genes are known to influence the phenotype of a disease. Even for monogenic diseases like, cystic fibrosis, Rett syndrome, and Wilson’s disease, a complex interaction between modifier genes has been reported to alter the expression, severity, and progression of the disease (Grillo et al. ; Gallati ). The clinical heterogeneity of WD has not been explained fully at its molecular level. Movement disorder phenotypes (tremor, rigidity, dystonia, and Parkinsonism) and neuropsychiatric disturbances (cognitive impairments, psychosis, aggressive behavior, etc.) in WD have been reported to occur due to basal ganglia dysfunctions and/or neurodegeneration in other related brain structures (Das and Ray ). Previous investigators have highlighted the involvement of BDNF in neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases (Mizui et al. ), implicating its potential involvement in WD. In the present study, we found that the C allele and CC genotype of BDNF C270T polymorphism play a protective function being significantly overrepresented among control individuals compared to WD patients. It is unlikely to get an overall association of BDNF C270T polymorphism with a monogenic disease. However, C270T polymorphism did not reveal any association with any endophenotype studied. Even the mean age does not vary significantly between the groups bearing different genotype of this polymorphism. This result is similar to our previous finding, where APOE variants showed an overall association with the disease (Roy et al. ). Besides, other studies have also reported the association of DMT1 variant with the susceptibility of the disease (Przybyłkowski et al. ). In this context, it is likely that C allele or CC genotype of C270T polymorphism may act as a protective factor towards developing hepatic and neurological symptoms among WD patients. Increasing evidence suggests BDNF controls glucose metabolism in liver regulating gluconeogenic enzymes (Genzer et al. ). This evidence further supports the involvement of BDNF function outside the brain. A previous report from in-silico analysis revealed that the T allele of C270T polymorphism of BDNF could alter binding of transcription factors, i.e., histone H4 transcription factor (HINFP) and Zic family member 3 (ZIC3) leading to deprived expression in the cortical region of brain (Cartharius et al. ). However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the observed association between BDNF C270T and WD is due to mutation in another gene located in the same chromosome as BDNF or has emerged by chance.
While studying the distribution of Val66Met polymorphism of BDNF , we found that G allele encoding Valine and GG (Val/Val) genotype were significantly more frequent among WD patients with an age of onset beyond 10 years. This possibly suggests that carriers of the G (Valine) allele and GG (Val/Val) genotype are less prone to develop WD symptoms at an earlier age. The Val66Met polymorphism is present in the pro-domain region of BDNF. BDNF pro-peptide acts through p75 neurotrophin receptor facilitating long-term depression inducing apoptosis (Mizui et al. ). This may underlie the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration in WD. Previously, it has been reported that the Val66Met polymorphism impairs intracellular trafficking losing its interaction with the sortilin receptor complex (Mizui et al. ). In-vitro cell-based studies revealed that substitution of the methionine residue at this position leads to decreased distribution to the dendrites and impaired secretion (Egan et al. ). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (f-MRI) studies have shown that Val/Val carriers have a significantly higher level of hippocampal activation compared to Val/Met carriers. The BDNF Met allele affects glucose metabolism in brain regions like the hippocampus and the temporal parietal and occipital cortex (Xu et al. ). In mammals, BDNF is highly expressed in hippocampus; hence, neurodegeneration and cognitive dysfunctions observed among WD patients may be attributed to methionine substitution at this position (Mizui et al. ). The molecular mechanism underlying the earlier onset of WD symptoms remains elusive. Proper BDNF signaling in hepatocytes may promote fatty acid oxidation and glycogen storage (Genzer et al. ). Considering these evidences, it is suggested that the presence of wild-type G (Val) allele or GG (Val/Val) genotype may delay the onset of symptoms among WD patients.
In this study, the minor allele A1 and A1A1 genotype of Taq1A polymorphism of DRD2 gene were significantly preponderant among WD patients compared to healthy controls. Further, analyzing the distribution of allele and genotype for Taq1A polymorphism of DRD2 within WD patients, we found that A1 allele and A1A1 genotypes act as a risk factor for developing rigidity. The present study is in accordance with previous reports suggesting that A1 allele and/or A1A1 genotype may serve as a risk factor for developing neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease (Noble et al. ). Similar positive associations between the Taq1A polymorphism and alcohol dependence, addiction, schizophrenia, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have been found (Noble ; Glatt et al. ; Rowe et al. ). In-vivo studies have also revealed association of the A1 allele with lower glucose metabolism in the dopaminergic neurons of the human brain (Rowe et al. ). The A1 allele of this polymorphism has been associated with lower dopamine D2 receptor expression in the striatum of post-mortem brain (Noble et al. ). Most of the movement disorders and neuropsychiatric presentations of WD possibly occur due to defects in basal ganglia and prefrontal cortex. Radiological evidence and studies with post-mortem brain revealed low dopamine D2 receptor expression in the striatum of WD patients (Oder et al. ). This leads us to hypothesize that decreased DRD2 expression in the striatum of the carriers of the DRD2 Taq1 A1 allele and A1A1 genotype among WD patients underlie the cause of poor dopaminergic transmission resulting in rigidity symptoms. The mean ages of WD patients with and without rigidity did not vary significantly, which excludes the possibility of a prominent age factor to be involved in the development of rigidity among patients age 30 or below.
Unavailability of clinical data for some of the patients restricted our analyses on smaller subsets of WD patients, which is a limitation of the study. Besides, we could not perform any further analysis based on association with the rarer clinical presentations, such as schizophrenia, depression, and impulsiveness among these WD patients due to lack of follow-up.
The patient pool included in this study contains heterogeneous mutation profiles including compound heterozygous conditions. Although the c.813C>A, Cys271X mutation in the ATP7B gene is common among our patient cohort, the number of patients was too low to compare the effect of BDNF and DRD2 polymorphisms solely on the mutational background. Apart from prognostic benefits of studying modifier genes, it also leads us to the understanding of the etiology of the disease, where a single gene alone may not play a major role. Rather, the varying clinical manifestations are likely the result of complex interactions between different genes connected to biochemical pathways involved with the pathogenesis of the disease triggered by a single gene ( ATP7B ) in a monogenic disease.
Conclusion
In conclusion, our findings suggest that the BDNF C270T C allele may be associated with the occurrence of WD, the BDNF Val66Met Val allele, and its homozygous genotype to serve as a protective factor delaying the age of onset. On the other hand in case of DRD2 Taq1A, A1 allele and its homozygous genotype may be a risk factor for developing rigidity among patients with WD. However, our hypotheses need to be independently replicated.
