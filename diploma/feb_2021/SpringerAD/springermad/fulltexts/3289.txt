INTRODUCTION
Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), a key category of nanosized structures, have shown great promise in a broad range of biomedical applications due to several distinctive features, such as high magnetic responsiveness and potential targeting ability ( , , , , , , , ). Among their diverse applications, MNPs can be successfully employed in medical diagnosis ( ), e.g., as contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in pharmacotherapy, as drug carriers for targeting tumor lesions ( ), and as cancer therapy by inducing hyperthermia ( ).
Magnetically controlled drug targeting currently represents one of the most exciting strategies in the drug delivery area. The successful use of MNPs in drug delivery is dependent on several factors including the physicochemical characteristics of the MNPs loaded with the therapeutic agent, the magnetic field strength and geometry, the depth of the tissue of interest under the skin, and the blood flow rate and supply in the site of action ( , , , , , , , ).
The magnetic particle, loaded with the drug, can be directed to and concentrated at the target site with the aid of an external magnetic field. The drug is then released at the desired area, thus reducing the needed therapeutic dose of the medication, and its side effects associated with unspecific systemic distribution of the drug are minimized ( ). However, magnetic particles are rapidly eliminated by cells of the phagocyte mononuclear system, mainly in the liver (60–90%) and spleen (3–10%), leading to short biological half-life ( ). To address this problem, a variety of polymers, such as chitosan ( , ), dextran ( ), poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) ( ), and poly(D-lactide- co -glycolide) (PLGA) ( ), have been employed as coatings for MNPs in core–shell structures. The protective coat can also enable controlled release of the encapsulated drug and may be provided with surface functionalities ( , ).
Among magnetic nanoparticles, magnetite has received increasing attention due to its properties and potential uses in the field ( ). Although more susceptible to oxidation than other magnetic substances, its superparamagnetic response for suitable diameters and the limited toxicity of the iron make magnetite an excellent candidate for biomedical applications ( , , ). Magnetite particles, normally with a diameter <100 nm ( ), have extensively been investigated in a variety of such applications including magnetic resonance imaging ( , ), bioseparation ( , ), drug targeting ( , , , , , , , ), and hyperthermia ( , , ).
These systems can be potentially used for drug targeting, and in addition, they can display selective toxicity for tumor cells in vivo , because they can be targeted by applying an external magnetic field to the tumor tissues, resulting in a greater accumulation of the magnetic nanoparticles and the drug ( ). There are several examples of magnetic nanoparticles that transport antitumor drugs to the tumor tissues by the application of an external magnetic field ( , , ). Examples include magnetic nanoparticles loaded with doxorubicin shown to have a higher antitumor effect in vivo as compared with DOX in liver cancer ( ) or MNPs loaded with cetuximab shown to have a good targeting and antitumor effect on mice ( ).
One successful strategy to produce polymer-protected magnetic composites involves coating the MNPs by means of in situ polymerization of the corresponding monomer at the surface of the particles. This has been used notably for the family of poly(alkylcyanoacrylates), one example of which is the one of interest in this work, poly(butylcyanoacrylate) (PBCA), a biodegradable polymer whose monomer is the tissue adhesive substance N -butyl-2-cyanoacrylate ( ). NPs formulated using PBCA have been extensively investigated as efficient carriers for the controlled delivery of pharmacologically active substances, mainly anticancer therapeutics ( , , ), and in fact, it has been recently stressed that it is one of the most widely used polymers from the poly(alkylcyanoacrylate) family due to its reduced toxicity and high biocompatibility ( ).
The drug incorporation into the composite core–shell particles can be carried out either by dissolving it in the aqueous phase containing the magnetic particles and then adding the organic phase as described or by dissolving it directly in the latter. In addition, a third approach would involve a surface loading on previously synthesized particles by treating them with a solution of the drug. The choice of one procedure or the other will depend on the solubility properties of the drug and its physicochemical compatibility with the polymer and the inorganic particles.
In the present study, magnetite (MAG) particles coated with PBCA were manufactured and characterized for their suitability as a platform for magnetically controlled drug delivery. Our aim is to describe the synthesis procedure and the characterization methods which can be used for assessing the applicability of the composite particles (PBCA-coated magnetite or MAG-PBCA) in the biomedical field. Attention is paid to the quantities that are likely to control the particle–drug and particle–cell membrane interactions, particularly size, surface charge, and hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance. Results concerning the magnetic properties of the composite particles will also be presented. Finally, the cytotoxicity of the composite particles against various tumoral and non-tumoral cell lines will be discussed.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
All chemicals used were of analytical quality and were purchased from Panreac, Spain, except for butylcyanoacrylate (gift from Henkel Loctite, Ireland), formamide (RPE, Carlo Erba, Italy), and diiodomethane (for synthesis, Merck, Germany). Water used in the experiments was deionized and filtered (Milli-Q Academic, Millipore, France), with a conductivity of 0.05 μS/cm.
Methods
Preparation of MAG, PBCA, and MAG-PBCA (Core–Shell) Nanoparticles
Magnetite nanoparticles were synthesized according to the co-precipitation method reported by Massart ( ). Briefly, at room temperature, 40 mL of an aqueous solution of 1 mol/L FeCl 3 and 10 mL of 2 mol/L FeCl 2 in 2 mol/L HCl solution were added to 500 mL of 0.7 mol/L aqueous ammonia solution. The precipitate obtained, separated from the supernatant by magnetic sedimentation using a permanent magnet with a magnetic field of 0.42 T, was redispersed in 500 mL of 2 M HClO 4 and let stand for 12 h. The aim of this procedure is to stabilize the MAG particles and prevent clot formation. After the synthesis, they were magnetically decanted and redispersed in water at neutral pH. This procedure was repeated several times until the conductivity of the supernatant reached a value below 2 μS/cm.
The PBCA nanoparticles were prepared by an emulsion polymerization method, in which droplets of the monomer, which is insoluble in water, were emulsified in the aqueous phase ( , , ). The monomer [0.5 g of 1% ( w / v )] was dissolved in 5 mL of acetone, and the solution was added dropwise, under mechanical stirring (1500 rpm), to 50 mL of the polymerization medium consisting of 0.5% ( w / v ) Pluronic ® F68 in 2 × 10 −3 N HCl. To ensure complete polymerization of the monomer, the reaction was continued for 3 h. A whitish suspension was obtained, which was then subjected to a cleaning procedure that included repeated cycles of centrifugation (20,000 rpm, Centrikon T-124 high-speed centrifuge, Kontron, France) and redispersion in Milli-Q water. In order to ensure that the suspension was sufficiently clean, the conductivity of the supernatant was measured as before.
Finally, the core–shell nanoparticles were prepared through a similar interfacial emulsion polymerization procedure. Polymerization of the monomer was performed using the same conditions described above, but in a polymerization medium containing the magnetite cores. In this way, the monomer is expected to polymerize on the surface of the magnetite particles resulting in a polymeric coat (shell). Specifically, the 1% ( w / v ) solution of the monomer in acetone was added dropwise, under the same mechanical agitation, to 50 mL of 0.75% ( w / v ) suspension of MAG nanoparticles (polymer/magnetite ratio, 4:3) in a solution of 2 × 10 −3 N HCl containing 0.5% ( w / v ) Pluronic ® F68. After the 3-h polymerization time, the produced particles were purified as described above. Purification was considered complete when the supernatant turned from white to clear (the white color is due to the non-magnetic polymer particles) and when its conductivity was less than 2 μS/cm, indicating that the suspension was free from any residual material.
Particle Characterization
Particle Size and Shape
The determination of the size and shape of the three types of synthesized particles was achieved through analysis of transmission or scanning electron microscopy images [TEM: Zeiss DSM 950 (Germany), HRTEM: Philips CM20 STEM (The Netherlands), and field-emission SEM: Leo Gemini 1530, Carl Zeiss (Germany)]. For the preparation of samples for observation, drops of the suspensions, diluted [approximately 0.1% ( w / v )] and sonicated for 5 min, were placed on copper grids with Formvar film. The grids were then dried at 25 ± 0.5°C in a convection oven. The metallization for SEM was carried out with carbon.
FTIR of the Particles
Characterization of the chemistry of the three particle types was carried out by means of Fourier transform infrared spectrometry data (Nicolet 20 SXB infrared spectrometer, USA) with a resolution of 2 cm −1 .
Surface Electrical Properties
In order to qualitatively ascertain the efficiency of the coating, the surface electrical properties of particle suspensions [0.1% ( w / v )] were analyzed by electrophoresis measurements as a function of both pH and NaCl concentration, using a Malvern Zetasizer 2000 (UK) electrophoresis device. Measurements were performed in triplicate at 25.0 ± 0.5°C, after incubation for 24 h at room temperature.
Magnetic Properties
The magnetic properties (hysteresis cycle) of MAG and MAG-PBCA were determined using a Quantum Design MPMS XL (USA) SQUID magnetometer at room temperature. A qualitative assessment was also performed by means of optical microscope visualization of a 0.5% ( w / v ) aqueous suspension under exposure to a 0.2-T permanent magnet, using a Nikon SMZ800 (Japan) stereoscopic zoom microscope.
Wettability
A surface thermodynamic analysis of the nanoparticles was carried out using the model developed by van Oss et al . ( ) and van Oss ( ). According to this, the total surface free energy of any material ( i ) is the sum of two contributions: the non-polar Lifshitz–van der Waals component ( \( {\gamma}_i^{\mathrm{LW}} \) ) and the acid–base component ( \( {\gamma}_i^{\mathrm{AB}} \) ) which is related to the electron donor ( \( {\gamma}_i^{-} \) ) and electron acceptor ( \( {\gamma}_i^{+} \) ) properties of the material. The resulting free energy reads $$ {\gamma}_i={\gamma}_i^{\mathrm{LW}}+{\gamma}_i^{\mathrm{AB}}={\gamma}_i^{\mathrm{LW}}+2\sqrt{\gamma_i^{+}{\gamma}_i^{-}} $$ (1)
Likewise, the interfacial solid–liquid free energy ( γ SL ) can be related to the corresponding components of the S and L phases. Specifically, if a drop of the liquid forms a contact angle ( θ ) on the solid, the relationship between the components of both materials and the contact angle can be written, using Young’s equation ( ) $$ 2\sqrt{\gamma_{\mathrm{S}}^{\mathrm{L}\mathrm{W}}{\gamma}_{\mathrm{L}}^{\mathrm{L}\mathrm{W}}}+2\sqrt{\gamma_{\mathrm{S}}^{+}{\gamma}_{\mathrm{L}}^{-}}+2\sqrt{\gamma_{\mathrm{S}}^{-}{\gamma}_{\mathrm{L}}^{+}}={\gamma}_{\mathrm{L}}\left(1+ \cos \theta \right) $$ (2)
The unknowns ( \( {\gamma}_{\mathrm{S}}^{\mathrm{LW}},\kern0.62em {\gamma}_{\mathrm{S}}^{+},\kern0.5em {\gamma}_{\mathrm{S}}^{-} \) ) can be calculated by solving the resulting system of three equations if the contact angles of three liquids of known components \( \left({\gamma}_{\mathrm{L}}^{\mathrm{L}\mathrm{W}},\kern1em {\gamma}_{\mathrm{L}}^{+},\kern1em {\gamma}_{\mathrm{L}}^{-}\right) \) are measured. In the current work, water ( \( {\gamma}_{\mathrm{L}}^{\mathrm{L}\mathrm{W}}=21.8{\ \mathrm{mJ}/\mathrm{m}}^2,\kern1em {\gamma}_{\mathrm{L}}^{+}={\gamma}_{\mathrm{L}}^{-}=25.5{\ \mathrm{mJ}/\mathrm{m}}^2 \) ), formamide ( \( {\gamma}_{\mathrm{L}}^{\mathrm{L}\mathrm{W}}=39{\ \mathrm{mJ}/\mathrm{m}}^2,\kern1em {\gamma}_{\mathrm{L}}^{+}=2.28{\ \mathrm{mJ}/\mathrm{m}}^2,\kern1em {\gamma}_{\mathrm{L}}^{-}=39.6{\ \mathrm{mJ}/\mathrm{m}}^2 \) ), and diiodomethane ( \( {\gamma}_{\mathrm{L}}^{\mathrm{L}\mathrm{W}}=50.8{\ \mathrm{mJ}/\mathrm{m}}^2,\kern1em {\gamma}_{\mathrm{L}}^{+}={\gamma}_{\mathrm{L}}^{-}=0 \) ) were used. All data were obtained from van Oss ( ). The contact angles of the three liquids were determined at 25 ± 0.5°C using a Ramé-Hart 100-00 goniometer (USA), modified for image acquisition of the deposited drops, using a PixeLink camera (Canada), provided with a 63,745 telecentric objective (Edmund Optics, UK). Measurements were performed on pellets (radius 1.3 cm) produced by compressing the dry powders in a Spepac (UK) hydraulic press set to 10 tons for 5 min.
X-ray Diffraction Analysis
X-ray powder diffraction analyses were performed using a D2 Phaser (Bruker AXS, Inc., Germany) at 45 kV and with monochromatized Cu Kα radiation ( λ = 1.54056 Å). The samples were scanned at ambient temperature in the continuous scan mode over the 100–800 2 θ range.
In Vitro Cytotoxicity Studies
MAG, PBCA, and MAG-PBCA nanoparticles were tested in human colon carcinoma T-84 and human colon fibroblast CCD-18 cell lines (obtained from the Scientific Instrumentation Centre, University of Granada, Spain) and in human breast cancer MCF-7 and human non-tumorigenic breast epithelial MCF-10A cell lines (obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, USA). T-84, CCD-18, and MCF-7 cell lines were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co., USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). MCF-10A cell line was maintained in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated horse serum, 0.5 μg/mL hydrocortisone, 10 μg/mL insulin, 20 ng/mL epidermal growth factor, and 100 ng/mL cholera toxin. All culture media were supplemented with 40 mg/mL gentamicin and 500 mg/mL ampicillin (Antibióticos S.A., Spain). All cells were maintained in monolayer culture at 37.0 ± 0.5°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 in air. Next, cells were seeded in 24-well plates (8 × 10 3 cells/well for T-84 and MCF-7 and 10 × 10 3 cells/well for CCD-18 and MCF-10A) in 300 μL of culture medium. After 24 h, cells were treated with dispersion of Fe 3 O 4 , NPs, and mixed particles at concentrations ranging from 50 to 10 5 ng/mL. Reported magnetic particle concentrations used in cytotoxicity studies fall within a wide range, which often include the values used in the present study. For example, Qu et al . ( ) used a dose of 100 μg/mL of PEG–chitosan-coated iron oxide nanoparticles in a toxicity study with the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2. In another study, a range of concentrations between 0 and 2 mg/mL was used to test magnetite and pullulan-coated magnetite nanoparticles ( ). In another study, the concentration used was 5 μg/μL of chitosan-coated MNPs in the K562 cell line of chronic myelogenous leukemia for a cytotoxicity study ( ). Finally, Yao et al . ( ) used a range of concentrations from 1 to 4 mg/mL of nanoparticles made of Gd-substituted zinc ferrite to test the toxicity in human vascular endothelial cells.
Cell cultures without treatment served as controls. Cells were incubated for 72 h, fixed with 300 μL of trichloroacetic acid (TCA, 10%) for 20 min at 4°C, and stained with 300 μL of sulforhodamine B (SRB, 0.4%) for 20 min at room temperature. Following three washes with acetic acid (1%), the dye was resuspended in 10 mM and pH 10.5 Trizma ® and a colorimetric assay was performed at 492 nm using a Titertek multiscan colorimeter (Flow, Irvine, CA). Cell viability (CV; percentage of surviving cells) was calculated, in terms of the sample and control absorbances, as follows: $$ \mathrm{CV}=\frac{A}{A_{\mathrm{control}}}\times 100 $$ (3)
The statistical analysis of the data was performed using the SPSS software package (v. 17; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). Student’s t test was used to compare results. Data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Differences were considered statistically significant for p values <0.05.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Particle Structure, Size, and Morphology
Figure 1 (top) shows TEM images of the approximately spherical MAG particles. Their average diameter was obtained by measurements on 100 particles in pictures like the one shown, and it was found to be 9.7 ± 1.9 nm. The PBCA particles were observed in dark-field HRTEM and FESEM, and representative pictures are provided in Fig. 1 (middle panel). The adhesive tendency of the PBCA particles to form bridges upon drying is clearly observed. Nevertheless, spherical individual particles are identified. The diameter in this sample was 230 ± 90 nm, in line with those reported in the literature for materials obtained by the same method of preparation ( , ). Fig. 1 Top TEM images of magnetite. Bar length = 50 nm. Middle FESEM ( a bar length = 1 μm) and HRTEM ( b bar length = 500 nm) pictures of PBCA NPs. Bottom FESEM ( a bar length = 200 nm) and HRTEM ( b bar length = 200 nm) pictures of magnetite/PBCA NPs
The microscopic examination of the coated particles using FESEM (Fig. 1 , bottom) allowed observing that the cores are coated with a thickness of few nanometers PBCA. The choice of the 4:3 ratio between the initial weights of the polymer and the magnetite was not random; preliminary studies, in fact, have shown that excess of polymer (4:1, 4:2) gives rise to a polymer matrix of large size (about 1 μm) with MAG particles dispersed in it, while an excess of magnetite (1:4, 2:4) results in poor coating of the nuclei and the formation of magnetic particles with a very thin polymer film, mainly located in regions of the contact between them. Following the same methodology described above for the magnetic core, we found that the average diameter of the MAG-PBCA nanoparticles was 140 ± 20 nm.
Figure 2 contains information about the X-ray diffractograms of the three kinds of particles. The magnetite diffraction pattern coincides with that of the ASTM standard, indicating a good crystallinity and purity of the particles. The peaks are of course also present in the coated particles, which also show the broad band and low-angle maximum characteristic of the polymer, a manifestation of the practically amorphous nature of the polymer. Shahbamadi et al . ( ) reported the formation of crystal structures during the synthesis of PBCA, mainly around pH 4 of the medium, which they attributed to rapid polymerization in such conditions. An XRD analysis of the same polymer particles performed by Bagad and Khan ( ) in an investigation of the loading of quercetin by PBCA showed a similar behavior as reported in the present work: a wide band at low angles indicating an essentially amorphous nature of the polymer.

FTIR of the Particles
The major transmittance bands in the infrared spectra of the investigated particles were identified ( ) (Fig. 3 ). The bands at 3000 cm −1 and at 1626 cm −1 correspond to the moisture content of the samples as a result of the processes of manipulation. The main groups identified are (A) C–H stretching at 2990 cm −1 , (B) C≡N stretching at 2251 cm −1 , (C) normal dimeric carboxylic C=O stretching at 1747 cm −1 , (D) C–H bending at 1471 cm −1 , C–CO–C stretching and bending at (E) 1255 cm −1 and (F) 1170 cm −1 , and (G) O–C–C bending of esters of primary alcohols at 858 cm −1 . As observed in Fig. 3 , the spectrum of MAG-PBCA includes all bands of PBCA, indicating that magnetite particles are coated with the polymer. The reduction in the band intensity of the core–shell spectrum can be due to the relatively small amount of polymer in these particles. Fig. 3 Infrared spectra of magnetite, PBCA, and core–shell nanoparticles (MAG-PBCA)
Electrokinetic Characterization
The electrophoretic mobility values ( μ e ) of the pure polymer, magnetite, and core–shell particles as a function of pH in the presence of 10 −3 M NaCl are plotted in Fig. 4 a. The characteristic, well-defined isoelectric point (pH of zero zeta potential) of magnetite at pH 7 is clearly observed ( , ). In contrast, PBCA and MAG-PBCA display a negative electrophoretic mobility over the whole pH range studied (Fig. 4 b) and show electrokinetic behaviors similar to each other. The negative charge is imparted in both cases by the free acrylic group ( ). The differences observed in electrical surface characteristics between magnetite and composite particles suggest that the latter are perfectly coated by PBCA, leading to an electrokinetic behavior that is similar to that of bare polymer particles. Fig. 4 Electrophoretic mobility ( μ e ) of magnetite PBCA particles and composite particles as a function of a pH and b NaCl concentration
The mobility of the three types of particles was also measured as a function of NaCl concentration at a constant pH = 5. The range of NaCl concentration was within 10 −1 –10 −5 M (Fig. 3 b). As before, PBCA and core–shell particles showed similar electrokinetic properties with a negative surface charge, whereas the magnetite nanoparticles displayed a stable positive surface charge over the whole ionic strength range studied. No specific effect of NaCl on the electrokinetics of either kind of particles was detected, and only the typical reduction of the mobility by double-layer compression was found.
The behavior described for the mobility of these particles is similar to that described for different poly(alkylcyanoacrylate) coatings. Arias et al . ( , , ) investigated the preparation of poly(ethylcyanoacrylate) or poly(butylcyanoacrylate) coating magnetic cores made of either magnetite or iron and demonstrated that in all cases, the changes in zeta potential can be used for probing the coating effectiveness. Also, electrokinetic evaluation proved to be useful as a qualitative follow-up of antitumor drug adsorption and release ( , , , , , ).
Magnetic Properties
Figure 5 demonstrates, in accordance with previous observations in nanoparticles with a magnetic core ( , , ), that composite nanoparticles show a similar magnetic behavior to that exhibited by magnetite, although magnetization is reduced as a result of the non-magnetic polymeric coat. The initial susceptibility was estimated from the linear portions (low field) of the curves in Fig. 5 and found to be χ i = 5.27 ± 0.04 and 0.53 ± 0.02 for MAG and MAG-PBCA, respectively. In addition, the saturation magnetization was reduced significantly from 409.0 ± 1.3 kA/m for MAG [close to the ideal bulk magnetization of about 450 kA/m; see, e.g., Ref. ( )] to 48.2 ± 0.3 kA/m for the polymer-coated magnetic particles. Despite this reduction in magnetic properties, the composite nanoparticles still exhibit a sufficient magnetic response to enable them to perform as magnetic-targeted drug carriers. Similar magnetizations have been reported by other authors for coated particles of interest in biomedical applications. Thus, Eslaminejad et al . ( ) found a saturation magnetization of about 20 kA/m for their pullulan–spermine-coated magnetite nanoparticles to be used in gene therapy. Effective magnetic targeting was demonstrated in Xu et al . ( ) using coated particles with just twice the magnetization of ours. Let us also mention that Wang et al . ( ) designed magnetite–chitosan composites with about 30 kA/m saturation suited for the delivery of doxorubicin. Fig. 5 Hysteresis cycles of magnetite and the magnetite/ PBCA nanoparticles
Surface Thermodynamics
The analysis of the surface free energy components of the examined particles can be employed to evaluate the efficiency of PBCA coating. As demonstrated in Table I , while the three probe liquids have similar contact angles on pellets of the polymer and the composite nanoparticles, these values are significantly different from the contact angles measured on magnetite pellets. Moreover, calculated surface free energy components displayed in Table I show a similar trend. The electron acceptor component ( \( {\gamma}_{\mathrm{S}}^{+} \) ) has small values that are unsuitable for comparison, and the magnetite particles show a slightly higher value for the Lifshitz–van der Waals component ( \( {\gamma}_{\mathrm{S}}^{\mathrm{LW}} \) ). Clearly, the differences are only significant in the case of the electron donor component ( \( {\gamma}_{\mathrm{S}}^{-} \) ). The essentially monopolar, electron donor character of magnetite manifests itself in its large \( {\gamma}_{\mathrm{S}}^{-} \) contribution to the surface energy, and in fact, this component is the best indicator of the coating, as it differs significantly from coated to uncoated particles, being in the former case very close to that of bare polymer. These findings are in good agreement with the electrokinetic data and confirm that the magnetic particles were sufficiently covered by the polymeric coat. The usefulness of surface thermodynamic evaluation for biomedical applications was already demonstrated in Refs. ( , , , , , , , , , ), and other authors have also mentioned the need of paying attention to such aspects when designing drug delivery vehicles. For instance, Huang et al . ( ) devised a procedure for attaching doxorubicin to sericin particles by the simple difference in hydrophobicity of the drug and the substrate. Also, in a thermodynamic analysis of the interaction between nanoparticles and cell membranes, Ginzburg and Balijepailli ( ) found that hydrophobic or low-charged particles can incorporate on the cell membrane by its swelling, in contrast with highly charged hydrophilic nanoparticles, capable of rupturing the phospholipid bilayer of the membrane. These examples show that the hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance of the coating may play a determinant role in the capabilities of the vehicles to bring their load into the cell, as desired.

In addition, the NP hydrophobicity may result in a modulation of the cell-type selectivity. For example, in a study of the hydrophobization of chitosan nanoparticles in tumor and non-tumor cells, a greater cell uptake of the hydrophobic chitosan nanoparticles in tumor cells compared to normal cells was observed. Furthermore, hydrophobic chitosan nanoparticles showed a higher cytotoxic effect on tumor cells than on normal cells, being in this case smaller than the non-hydrophobic chitosan nanoparticles ( ). However, the problems caused by the hydrophobicity of the nanoparticles are most evident in vivo , because hydrophobic nanoparticles are opsonized and eliminated more quickly from the bloodstream than hydrophilic nanoparticles, due to the greater capacity to adsorb plasma proteins on its surface ( ). In addition, Moyano et al . ( ) demonstrated the existence of a linear correlation between the increase of the immune activity and the increase of the hydrophobicity of the nanoparticles. Composite particles are often designed in such a way that the outermost layer incorporates a coating that reduces the hydrophobicity (PEG is an example), in order to reduce the interaction with plasma proteins and to increase the half-life in the blood circulation ( ).
Surface free energy changes are, hence, essential as a quantitative tool for the evaluation of the hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity properties of the investigated materials. Using the free energy of the interaction between the solid phases immersed in the liquid (without considering the electrostatic component; ΔG SLS ), one can determine if a material is hydrophobic or hydrophilic ( ). Accordingly, ΔG SLS is computed per unit area of interacting particles using the following equations, where all the quantities are known from Table I $$ \begin{array}{l}\varDelta {G}_{\mathrm{S}\mathrm{L}\mathrm{S}}=-2{\gamma}_{\mathrm{S}\mathrm{L}}\\ {}{\gamma}_{\mathrm{S}\mathrm{L}}={\gamma}_{\mathrm{S}\mathrm{L}}^{\mathrm{L}\mathrm{W}}+{\gamma}_{\mathrm{S}\mathrm{L}}^{\mathrm{AB}}\\ {}{\gamma}_{\mathrm{S}\mathrm{L}}^{\mathrm{L}\mathrm{W}}={\gamma}_{\mathrm{S}}^{\mathrm{L}\mathrm{W}}+{\gamma}_{\mathrm{L}}^{\mathrm{L}\mathrm{W}}-2\sqrt{\gamma_{\mathrm{S}}^{\mathrm{L}\mathrm{W}}{\gamma}_{\mathrm{L}}^{\mathrm{L}\mathrm{W}}}\\ {}{\gamma}_{\mathrm{S}\mathrm{L}}^{\mathrm{AB}}=2\left(\sqrt{\gamma_{\mathrm{S}}^{+}}-\sqrt{\gamma_{\mathrm{L}}^{+}}\right)\left(\sqrt{\gamma_{\mathrm{S}}^{-}}-\sqrt{\gamma_{\mathrm{L}}^{-}}\right)\end{array} $$ (4)
Recall that when ΔG SLS is negative, attraction of the particles to each other is favored and, thus, the material is considered hydrophobic. Conversely, ΔG SLS of hydrophilic materials displays positive values. Figure 6 clearly indicates that the coverage of magnetite with PBCA has imparted the hydrophilic magnetic material a hydrophobic nature similar to that of the free polymer. Fig. 6 Solid–liquid interfacial energy of interaction (Δ G SLS ) values and hydrophobic/hydrophilic properties of magnetite, PBCA, and composite (core–shell) nanoparticles
Mechanism of Polymer Coat Formation
All data provided above indicates that a polymer coat is formed on the surface of the magnetite nuclei resulting in core–shell nanoparticles. The mechanism of coat formation can be explained based on the possible interactions between the butylcyanoacrylate monomers and the surface of magnetite particles. In the acidic conditions of the synthesis, magnetite will be positively charged and, therefore, it will be electrostatically attracted to the negatively charged carboxylic group of the monomer. As a result of this electrostatic interaction, the monomer molecules will accumulate at the proximity of the magnetite surface forming a continuous layer as polymerization takes place. Another argument can be made based on the surface thermodynamic data. Using data in Table I , the Dupré equation ( , ) can be employed to calculate the free energy of interaction between magnetite (M) and polymer (P) in the aqueous solution (L) as follows: $$ \varDelta {G}_{\mathrm{ML}\mathrm{P}}={\gamma}_{\mathrm{MP}}-{\gamma}_{\mathrm{ML}}-{\gamma}_{\mathrm{PL}} $$ (5)
According to this equation, the free energy of interaction is computed using the interfacial free energies for each pair of interfaces involved. In the case of MAG-PBCA, in aqueous solution, ΔG MLP = − 12.8 ± 0.7 mJ/m 2 . The negative value indicates that this interaction is favored and occurs spontaneously. It can be concluded that the formation of the polymer coating is a result of thermodynamically favored interactions between magnetite and polymer, i.e., van der Waals and acid–base interactions, together with the electrostatic attraction between the positively charged magnetite particles and the negative cyanoacrylate groups.
Cytotoxicity Studies
Results from the cytotoxicity assay are displayed in Fig. 7 . Both PBCA and MAG-PBCA nanoparticles showed no cytotoxicity in any of the four cell lines in most of concentrations tested (from 50 to 10 4 ng/mL). Only at the highest concentrations (over 10 4 ng/mL) PBCA nanoparticles showed toxicity especially in MCF-7 and CCD-18 cells. Interestingly, at these concentrations, the association of Fe 3 O 4 to PBCA nanoparticles decreased the toxicity in both tumor and non-tumor cell lines. In fact, MAG-PBCA particles did not show cell toxicity against MCF-10A and T-84, even at the highest concentrations (10 5 ng/mL) (Fig. 7 ). Finally, bare magnetite did not produce cell toxicity. Fig. 7 In vitro cytotoxicity of magnetite, PBCA, and composite (magnetite/PBCA) nanoparticles in human colon and breast (tumoral and non-tumoral) cell lines. Data represents the mean value ± SD ( n = 4)
The physicochemical properties of nanoparticles such as size, shape, or surface coating are a crucial aspect in relation with their biocompatibility ( ). As observed, the combination of magnetite with a PBCA coating leads to a reduction of the already small toxicity produced by the polymer. Many studies refer to the good biocompatibility of polymer-coated magnetic nanoparticles. Polyvinyl alcohol-coated magnetic nanoparticles were tested in the mouse fibroblast cell line L929, and a reduction of the cell toxicity with the coated nanoparticles in comparison with no coated nanoparticles was observed ( ). Furthermore, magnetic nanoparticles coated with dextran, PEG, or polyampholyte also showed a better biocompatibility ( , , ).
Finally, the carrier of the drug should be non-toxic. It should be biodegradable and biocompatible, and the cytotoxicity specific for tumor cells should be provided only by the carried drug. Thus, from the toxicity study, we must choose a non-toxic dose of magnetic nanoparticles that allows the administration of the appropriate dose of the drug.
CONCLUSIONS
The current study has demonstrated that magnetite/poly(alkylcyanoacrylates) (core–shell) NPs, which can be potentially used for drug targeting, can be successfully produced by a relatively simple procedure. Surface (chemical, electrokinetic, and thermodynamic) properties of the composite particles are comparable to those of the pure poly(alkylcyanoacrylate) particles. Nonetheless, the magnetite-based particles retained the ability to get magnetized and, in contrast to the polymer, exhibited low or negligible cytotoxicity. These findings, as well as the ease of drug incorporation, suggest that the developed composite colloids are ideally suited as a platform for magnetically controlled drug delivery.
