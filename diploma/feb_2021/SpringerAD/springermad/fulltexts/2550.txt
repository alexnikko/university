Introduction
Epilepsy is a serious neurological disease affecting more than 50 million population worldwide (Behr et al. ), the incidences of epilepsy are significantly higher in the elderly population than other age groups (Hauser et al. ). Currently, many synthetic classes of anticonvulsant drugs are being used either alone or in combination for the treatment of epilepsy (Hernan and Holmes ). Moreover, recently many newer drugs like vigabatrin, levetiracetam, topiramate, lamotrigine, zonisamide, lacosamide, rufinamide, stiripentol have been developed for epilepsy treatment (Satinder and Suvasini ; Mula ; Marvin ). Nonetheless, all the currently available synthetic anticonvulsant drugs are prone to cause one or more side/adverse effects such as impotence, dizziness, mental slowing, ataxia, impaired concentration, mental confusion, sleep disturbance, anorexia, somnolence, aggression and so on (Mula ; Hamed ; Yang and Wang ). In this scenario, there is a tremendous scope for development of safe and potent drug for the management of epilepsy, in these lines plant based remedies are well known and got better edge over synthetic drugs, thus many researchers are extensively working on herbal remedies to discover better and safe medicine for epilepsy. In this perspective, many plant based medicines such as Carum carvi L. (Showraki et al. ), Kalanchoe pinnata Lam. (Mora and Hernandez ), Citrus sinensis (Citraro et al. ), Abies webbiana Lindl. (Parkash et al. ), Crocus sativus (Khazdair et al. ), Laggera aurita (Linn. F) (Malami et al. ), and Dodonaea viscosa (Linn) (Karim et al. ) have been scientifically proved to possess potent anticonvulsantactivity against experimental models of epilepsy. In view of this, Achyranthes aspera Linn., belongs to family Amaranthaceae, has been extensively used in the traditional system of medicine for the treatment of various ailments (Talukder et al. ). In line with its potential usage in folk medicine, various parts of the plant has been scientifically proved to possess anti-hypergycemic (Talukder et al. ), anticancer (Shagun ), diuretic (Saurabh et al. ), antiobesity (Rani et al. ), antimicrobial (Ndhlala et al. ), antineoplatic and immunomodulatory (Narayan and Kumar ), antiherpes (Mukherjee et al. ), antiarthritic (Kothavade et al. ), antioxidant and hepatoprotective activities (Khan et al. ), furthermore, Achyranthes aspera is scientifically proved to possess various biological activities related to central nervous system such as nootropic (Gawande and Goel ), antianxiety (Chandana et al. ), antidepressant (Barua et al. , ), CNS depressant (Bhosale et al. , b), and evidently various parts of the plant has been effectively used in the management of epilepsy by various folk medicine practicing communities in India (Sharma et al. ). Based on the available literature on antioxidant and neuroprotective properties of Achyranthes aspera and its current use in folk medicine for the management of epilepsy, the present study was undertaken to evaluate the anticonvulsant activity of various extracts of Achyranthes aspera aerial parts against experimental models of epilepsy.
Materials and methods
Drugs and chemicals
Phenytoin was purchased from Sun Pharma, (Mumbai, India), diazepam and flumazenil was procured from Ranbaxy (New Delhi, India), and pentylenetetrazole was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Bangalore, India). All the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS/MS) grade solvents used in this study were procured from Merck Ltd. (Mumbai, India). All other chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade and were purchased from HiMedia Laboratories Pvt. Ltd. (Mumbai, India).
Collection of plant material
The aerial parts of Achyranthes aspera was collected from Kengeri, Bangalore (Karnataka, India), in the month of June–July 2015, and it was identified and authenticated by Dr.K. Madhavachetty, Professor of Botany, Sri Venkateshwara University, Tirupati. A voucher specimen of the plant material is preserved in the department with Voucher specimen number 2184.
Plant material preparation
The aerial parts of Achyranthes aspera was shade dried, powdered, and subjected to extraction process with various solvents (petroleum ether, methanol and water) in the ascending order of their polarity. In brief, in a round bottom flask 100 g of the plant material was initially defatted with 1 l of petroleum ether for 24 h, at room temperature; the marc obtained was completely dried and extracted with 1 l of methanol at 60 o c for 48 h in Soxhlet apparatus, subsequently the marc obtained was extracted with 1 l of double distilled water in a round bottom flask at room temperature for 48 h. Extracts obtained were concentrated at room temperature under reduced pressure using Rota-evaporator (Rotavap-Remi instruments).
LC-MS/MS analysis of Achyranthes aspera methanol extract
The LC-MS/MS instrument used in our study comprised an high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) coupled with an API 4000 mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystem/MDS SCIEX, Canada) coupled with an electron-spray ionization source with an electron multiplier detector and a chromatographic system. Batch acquisition and data processing were controlled by using Analyst® Software Version 1.5 (Applied Biosystems/MDS Analytical Technologies, CA, USA).
The parameters of the mass spectrometer were optimized by using a 1-mg mL-1 sample solution of Achyranthes aspera methanol extract (MeAA) prepared in Double distilled mineral (DM) water. The sample was directly and continuously infused (flow injection analysis) into the electron spray-MS (ES-MS) by using a syringe pump. The intensity of the response was checked in both the positive and the negative ionization modes. A response with good intensity was obtained in the positive mode. Other parameters, such as the de-clustering potential (DP: 60–100 V), ion spray voltage (IS: 4500 V), pressures of the nebulizing gas (GS1 45 pounds per square inch (psi)) and the heater gas (GS2 = 55 psi), focusing potential (FP = − 400 V), entrance potential (EP = 10–15 V), source temperature (TEM = 450–500 °C) and EP 10–15 V, were optimized with respect to the ionization-intensity response.
The mobile phase consisting of water and 0.2% formic acid in pump A, and acetonitrile in pump B. The system was operated at 0.7 ml/min flow rate, injection volume 2–14 μL (linear gradient of 2 microleters) with total runtime of 4.5 min. The outcomes of LC-MS/MS analysis showed presence of gallic acid, kaempferol, quercetin and rutin as chief active ingredients, the LC-MS/MS chromatogram and compounds identified from methanolic extract of Achyranthes aspera aerial parts (MeAA) were given in Fig . 1 . Fig. 1 LC-MS/MS spectra of methanol extract of Achyrathes aspera aerial parts
Formulation of extracts for administration
Various concentrations of PeAA, MeAA, and AeAA were prepared in 3% tween 80 in distilled water. In short, required quantity of the extract was weighed and suspended in tween 80, and distilled water was slowly added with occasional stirring, and made up to the volume with distilled water, the concentration of tween 80 in the final formulation would be 3%. All the preparations were freshly prepared and administered by oral route at 10 ml/kg dose volume.
Experimental animals
Inbred Swiss albino mice (25–30 g) were used for the study. The animals were maintained in polypropylene cages at a temperature of 25 °C ± 1 °C and relative humidity of 45% to 55% in a clean environment under 12-h light/dark cycle. The animals had free access to standard rat/mice pellets (Pranav Agro Industry, Bangalore, India) and purified water ad libitum.
All the experimental protocols were approved by Institutional Animal Ethics Committee (IAEC) and were conducted according to the principles and guidelines of the Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision of Experimentation on Animals (CPCSEA), India.
Experimental protocol
Acute oral toxicity studies
Acute oral toxicity of extracts of Achyranthes aspera aerial parts were determined as per OECD guideline no. 425. In brief, nulliparous and non-pregnant female mice weighing between 25 and 30 g were fasted for 3 h and single dose of extract was administered by oral route, and the animals were observed for the toxic signs and mortality, initially for 48 h (short term toxicity), and the survived animals were further observed for 14 days (long term outcomes). LD 50 was calculated using AOT425 stat program (OECD guidelines no.425, ).
Six-hertz seizure test
This test was performed as per Brown et al., (Brown et al. ; Kaminski et al. ). In short, Swiss albino mice were randomized based on the body weight and they were pretreated with extracts (100 to 800 mg/kg, p.o.) for 3 days. On third day, sixty minutes after the last dose, tetracaine ophthalmic solution (0.5% tetracaine hydrochloride) was applied; after thirty minutes electrical stimulation was given to all the animals (3 s, 32-mA monopolar rectangular pulses at 6 Hz) through corneal electrodes using ECT Unit 5780 (Ugo Basile, Comerio, Italy) constant current device. In general, the electrical stimulation will induce a stunned posture, associated with rearing and automatic movements, which lasts from 60 to 120 s in control animals. After the seizures, animals will regain their normal exploratory behavior.
The end point is considered as protection against the seizures, and the animal gain its normal exploratory behavior within 10 s of electrical stimulation is considered as being protected (Magdalena et al. ). The percentage protection is calculated using the equation given below. $$ \%\mathrm{Protection}=100-\left[\left(\frac{\mathrm{No}.\mathrm{of}\ \mathrm{animal}\ \mathrm{s}\mathrm{howed}\ \mathrm{s}\mathrm{eizures}}{\mathrm{Total}\ \mathrm{no}.\mathrm{of}\ \mathrm{animal}\mathrm{s}\ \mathrm{used}}\right)\times 100\right] $$
Maximal electroshock-induced convulsions
In this method, in bred male Swiss albino mice (25–30 g weight) were randomized and assigned in to six groups, each group consisting of eight animals ( n = 8). Group 1 and group 2 were served as control and standard groups, received 3% tween 80 (10 ml/kg) and Phenytoin (25 mg/kg) respectively. While, group 3, 4, 5, and 6 received 100, 200, 400 and 800 mg/kg doses of MeAA respectively, all the treatments were given orally for three days. On day-3, sixty minutes after the drug administration, tetracaine ophthalmic solution (0.5% tetracaine hydrochloride) was applied to the cornea and corneal electrodes were applied to the cornea and electrical stimulation (60 mA of current for 0.2 s) was given for all the animals. Subsequently, all the animals were individually observed in a rectangular open top plastic cage for 30 min. The parameters like period of hind limb tonic flexion (HLTF), hind limb tonic extensor (HLTE), stupor, and death/survival were recorded, and the percentage protection was calculated using the survival rate (Chrościńska et al. ; Joshi et al. ; Mishra et al. ).
Pentylenetetrazole-induced convulsions
Similar to MES model, male Swiss albino mice (25–30 g) were divided into six (G-1 to G-6) groups ( n = 8). Group 1 and group 2 served as control and standard groups, received 3% tween 80 (10 ml/kg) and diazepam (5 mg/kg) respectively. While, group 3, 4, 5, and 6 received 100, 200, 400 and 800 mg/kg doses of MeAA respectively, all the treatments were given orally for a three days. On day-3, one hour after the assigned treatments, PTZ (80 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered intraperitoneally to all the animals, and they were individually observed in an open top plastic cage initially for 30 min, and later up to 24 h. During the observation period, the parameters such as onset of clonus, onset of tonic convulsions, and survival/death were recorded and expressed as percentage protection (Showraki et al. ).
Effect of MeAA on GABA levels in the brain
This test was performed to evaluate the effect of single dose (1 day) and multiple dose (3 days) administration of MeAA on GABA levels in the brain. In this model, male Swiss albino mice (25–30 g) were grouped and treated similar to PTZ model, in two different sets of experiments.
The first set (1 day treatment) and second set (3 days treatment) experimental animals were sacrificed on day-1 and day-3 respectively, 1 h after the last dose of MeAA. The brain tissue was collected and frozen, and the cerebellum and whole brain were separated using microtome blade. The whole brain was weighed and transferred to 10 ml of ice-cold 0.1 M Perchloric acid containing 15 μg/ml of Valine (internal standard). Under the ice-cold conditions, the contents were homogenized and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C; the supernatant was separated and subjected for GABA estimation as per Suher et al. (Suher et al. ).
Effect of flumazenil on anti-PTZ action of MeAA – to explore the GABAergic mechanism
Similar to PTZ model, male Swiss albino mice (25–30 g) were divided into seven groups (G-1 to G-7, n = 8). Group 1, group 2 and group 3 served as control, standard and MeAA alone treated groups, received 3% tween 80 (10 ml/kg), diazepam (5 mg/kg, p.o.) and MeAA (400 mg/kg, p.o.) respectively; while group 4, group 5, and group 6 received vehicle (3% tween 80) (10 ml/kg), diazepam (5 mg/kg, p.o.) and MeAA (400 mg/kg, p.o.,) respectively, in combination with the GABA A receptor antagonist flumazenil (3 mg/kg, i.p.); group 7 received diazepam (5 mg/kg, p.o.) along with MeAA (400 mg/kg, p.o.). Everyday, 15 min after the assigned treatments the animals of the group 4, 5, and 6 animals received flumazenil (3 mg/kg) intraperitoneally and other groups (group 1, 2, 3 and 7) received 1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in sterile water (5 ml/kg) intraperitoneally; all the treatments were given for three days. On day-3, one hour after the assigned treatments, PTZ (80 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered intraperitoneally to all the animals and observed similar to the PTZ model (Showraki et al. ; Ishola et al. ; Nogueira and Vassilieff ).
N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) -induced lethality test
Swiss albino mice were divided into six groups of 10 animals each, Group 1 and group 2 served as control and standard groups, received 3% tween 80 (10 ml/kg) and Promethazine (80 mg/kg) respectively. While, group 3, 4, 5, and 6 received 100, 200, 400 and 800 mg/kg doses of MeAA respectively, all the treatments were given orally for three days. On day-3, one hour after the last dose, all the animals were challenged with a lethal intraperitoneal dose (200 mg/kg) of NMDA. Subsequently, all the animals were observed for a period of 3 h for their survival, and the results were expressed as percentage protection against lethality (Moreau et al. ; Yamaguchi et al. ). $$ \mathrm{Percentage}\ \mathrm{protection}=\frac{Number\ of\ animals\ survived}{Total\ number\ of\ animals\ used}\times 100 $$
Actophotometer test
The actophotometer test was performed to evaluate the effect of MeAA on locomotor activity. In short, forty male swiss albino mice (25–30 g) were assigned into five groups ( n = 8), and they were treated similar to PTZ model.
To measure locomotor activity, all the animals were individually placed into actophotometer and photocell counts were recorded for 10 min, the locomotor activity was measured before and after the treatment (Viswanatha et al. ). The change in the locomotor activity was calculated using the following equation. $$ \%\mathrm{Reduction}\ \mathrm{in}\ \mathrm{locomotor}\ \mathrm{activity}=100-\left[\left(\frac{\mathrm{Photocell}\ \mathrm{counts}\ \mathrm{after}\ \mathrm{treatment}}{\mathrm{Photocell}\ \mathrm{counts}\ \mathrm{before}\kern0.5em \mathrm{treatment}}\right)\times 100\right] $$
Statistical analysis
In Siz-hertz-seizure test and NMDA - induced lethality test, the results were expressed as percentage protection. All other experimental findings were expressed as mean ± SEM. The outcomes of locomotor activity were statistically analyzed by paired t-test and the data of the remaining experiments were statistically analyzed by one way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparison test using GraphPad Prism version 5.0 for Windows, GraphPad Software, San Diego California USA. The minimum level of significance was fixed at p < 0.05.
Results
Extraction of plant material
The extractive values of petroleum ether (PeAA), methanol (MeAA) and aqueous (AeAA) extracts were found to be 0.33, 8.75, and 10.24% w/w (gram by gram) respectively.
Acute oral toxicity study
Acute oral toxicity study for the plant extracts were performed as per OECD guidelines no. 425 up and down procedure. The outcome of the study showed that the PeAA, MeAA and AeAA were safe up to 5000 mg/kg, p.o. Further, no signs of toxicity were observed during short term (48 h) and long term (14 days) observation period.
Anticonvulsant activity
Six-hertz (6 Hz) seizure test
In this test, various doses of PeAA (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg), MeAA (100, 200, 400 and 800 mg/kg) and AeAA (100, 200, 400 and 800 mg/kg) were evaluated for the possible anticonvulsant property. In the outcomes, except MeAA none of the extracts showed protection against six-hertz-induced seizures. Further, the effect of MeAA was found to be mild and dose dependent, and attained saturation effect after 400 mg/kg dose. Notably, the reference standard diazepam (5 mg/kg) has completely abolished six-hertz-induced Seizures. The results are given in Table 1 .

Maximal electroshock-induced convulsions
In six-hertz-seizure test, except MeAA none of the extracts showed protection, therefore only MeAA was shortlisted for further evaluation in MES and PTZ models. In this model, the MeAA (200, 400 and 800 mg/kg) has decreased the duration of MES-induced HLTE ( P < 0.05 and P < 0.01), HLTF ( P < 0.05 and P < 0.01) and stupor ( P > 0.05 and P < 0.01), and also increased the survival rate (25% and 50%) compared to control group. Further, the protective effect of MeAA was dose dependent in 200 and 400 mg/kg doses, however there was no significant difference between 400 and 800 mg doses in terms of anticonvulsant activity, it may be due to saturation/sealing effect. Noteworthy, the reference standard phenytoin (25 mg/kg) has completely abolished the MES-induced convulsions and mortality. The ED 50 value of MeAA was found to be 585.36 mg/kg (Fig. 2 ).

Pentylenetetrazole-induced convulsions
In continuation with MES model, MeAA (100, 200, 400 and 800 mg/kg) was evaluated against PTZ-induced seizures in mice. The animals of control group exhibited clonic and tonic convulsions, and all animals were found dead as a consequence of intraperitoneal PTZ (80 mg/kg) administration. Remarkably, MeAA at 200 and 400 mg/kg doses has dose dependently prolonged the onset of clonus ( P < 0.05 and P < 0.01), onset of tonus ( P > 0.05 and P < 0.05), and increased the survival rate (25% and 62.5%) compared to control group, further the anticonvulsant effect of MeAA at 800 mg was almost similar to 400 mg, which implies the sealing effect and there was no significant change in anticonvulsant activity upon increasing the dose beyond 400 mg, therefore for further studies 400 mg/kg dose of MeAA was used. Exceptionally, the reference standard diazepam (5 mg/kg) has ameliorated the PTZ-induced convulsions and completely inhibited the mortality rate. The ED 50 value of MeAA was found to be 428.65 mg/kg (Fig. 3 ). Fig. 3 Effect of MeAA on PTZ-induced convulsions in mice.

Effect of MeAA on GABA levels in the brain
The MeAA has evolved as a good anticonvulsant extract in all the anticonvultant tests (Six-hertz-seizure test, MES and PTZ models); Furthermore, to explore the mechanism behind the Anticonvulsant activity, 200 and 400 mg/kg doses of MeAA were evaluated for its effect on GABA levels in whole brain other than cerebellum. The results showed significant elevation of GABA levels in whole brain, upon multiple dose (3 days) ( P < 0.01) administration of MeAA compared to control. In similar lines, the reference standard diazepam (5 mg/kg) also showed significant elevation of GABA compared to control (Fig. 4 ). Fig. 4 Effect of MeAA on GABA levels in brain. Note- MeAA, Methanolic extract of Achyranthes aspera aerial parts ; ns , Not significant. The photocell counts are expressed as mean ± SEM ( n = 8). The basal values of the respective treatments were compared with post treatment values by paired t-test using Graph Pad version 5.0. * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01, *** P < 0.001 compared with control
Effect of flumazenil on anti-PTZ action of MeAA
In this test, MeAA (400 mg/kg) per se treatment showed significant anticonvulsant effect against PTZ-induced convulsions (anti-PTZ effect). In contrary, when MeAA (400 mg/kg, p.o.) was co-administered with flumazenil (5 mg/kg, i.p.), the anticonvulsant effect of MeAA was completely abolished, due to GABA A receptor antagonistic action of flumazenil. In support of this, the anticonvulsant effect of reference standard diazepam (5 mg/kg, p.o.) was also blocked when administered along with flumazenil, which further validated the method to confirm the GABAergic mechanism of MeAA. The results are given in Fig. 5 . Fig. 5 Effect of Flumazenil on anti-PTZ action of MeAA in mice.

N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) -induced lethality test
N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid-induced lethality test is a most commonly used test to explore the possible role of glutaminergic pathway in the anticonvulsant effect of the test drug. In the present study, none of the tested doses of MeAA (100, 200, 400 and 800 mg/kg) showed significant protection against NMDA-induced behavioral changes, and lethality, at high dose (800 mg/kg) MeAA showed 30% inhibition. However, the reference standard, promethazine (80 mg/kg) showed significant (90%) protection against NMDA-induced mortality in mice. The results are given in Tables 2 . Table 2 N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) -induced lethality test Sl.no Treatment No. of animals survived/Total animals used % Protection 1 Control (3% tween 80) 10/10 0% 2 Promethazine 80 mg/kg, p.o. 9/10 90% 6 MeAA 100 mg/kg, p.o. 0/10 0% 7 MeAA 200 mg/kg, p.o. 1/10 10% 8 MeAA 400 mg/kg, p.o. 2/10 20% 9 MeAA 800 mg/kg, p.o. 3/10 30% MeAA Methanol extract of Achyranthes aspera aerial parts ,
Actophotometer test
Since most of the currently available antiepileptic drugs possess the inherent character of inducing locomotor deficits, we thought to evaluate the effect of MeAA on normal locomotor activity of mice by actophotometer test; diazepam (5 mg/kg) was used as a reference standard. Interestingly, MeAA did not induce significant changes in locomotor activity in any of tested doses (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg) compared to basal locomotor activity. In contrary, the reference standard diazepam (5 mg/kg) has significantly decreased the photocell counts and thereby showed significant reduction in locomotor activity (78.34%) compared to its basal values recorded before treatment ( P < 0.001). Furthermore, the percentage reduction in locomotor activity in MeAA treatment was significantly less compared to diazepam. The results are illustrated in Fig. 6 .

Discussion
In present study various extracts of Achyranthes aspera aerial parts were evaluated for anticonvulsant activity in three different experimental models in Swiss albino mice.
Based on the recent recommendations of anticonvulsant discovery program, all the extracts (PeAA, MeAA and AeAA) were initially evaluated against six-hertz-seizure test in mice (Wojda et al. ). The six-hertz-seizure test mimics the drug-resistant epilepsy observed in humans, and it is considered as mild, effective, and economical model for the early identification of anticonvulsant property of test samples (Wolfgang ), and as per the guidelines, test drugs which fail in conventional models (MES, PTZ etc.) are strongly recommended to screen against Six-hertz- seizure test (Wojda et al. ;Jarogniew; Jarogniew et al. ). Indeed, six-hertz-seizure test resembles the clinical condition of partial or limbic epilepsy associated with a minimal clonic phase, followed by stereotyped and automatistic behaviors, in this model most of the currently available anticonvulsant drugs will fail to show protection, and hence called as drug-resistant epilepsies (Wolfgang ). Hence, this model is considered as highly useful in identifying even a very mild anticonvulsant drug, and thus valuable in avoiding false negatives. With the objective of identifying even a very mild anticonvulsant sample, all the extracts were initially evaluated against six-hertz-seizure test. However, in this test only MeAA (100, 200, 400 and 800 mg/kg) has shown potent anticonvulsant effect. Conversely, PeAA and AeAA were futile and only high dose of AeAA (400 and 800 mg/kg, p.o.) showed very minimal inhibition. Based on these observations, we thought to evaluate only MeAA against MES and PTZ-induced convulsion models.
Furthermore, MES-induced epilepsy is a conventional and most widely accepted model for screening the drugs against epilepsy, this model mimics the petit mal epilepsy observed in clinic (Carter et al. ). In principle, the electroshock delivered in MES model is well known to potentiate the sodium influx by opening of sodium channels, and also increases glutamate levels, glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter, and it binds to NMDA receptors and induces the symptoms that exactly mimic the petit mal epilepsy in humans (Carter et al. ). With the detailed understanding of underlying mechanism, it is stated and scientifically proved that, the agents which shows protection in this model will act either by blocking the voltage-dependent sodium channels (phenytoin, sodium valproate,) and/or by decreasing excitatory amino acid levels and/or by antagonizing their actions (e.g., felbamate) (Viswanatha et al. ).
Besides, PTZ is a potent antagonist at GABA receptor site, this model is equally old and widely used as MES model; however, this model mimics grand mal epilepsy in humans (Huang et al. ). In fact, PTZ binds to GABA A receptor and closes the chloride channel and thereby prevents the entry of chloride, and prevents the neurons from undergoing hyperpolarization, further PTZ is also known to decrease the GABA levels and density of GABA A receptors in various parts of the brain (Psarropoulou et al. ), all these changes together leads to continuous stimulation of cortical neurons, and results in convulsions similar to absence seizures/grand mal epilepsy observed in humans (Huang et al. ). Hence, it is thought that the agents which shows protection in this model would act either by acting as GABA A receptor agonists (like diazepam), and/or by enhancing GABA levels in brain, and/or through enhancing GABA A receptor density in the brain (Viswanatha et al. ).
In both MES and PTZ models, the MeAA (200 and 400 mg/kg) showed significant and dose dependent protection. However, further increase in the dose of MeAA to 800 mg/kg did not show significant increase in anticonvulsant activity, and it may be due to sealing effect, notably, in none of the tested doses the MeAA has showed complete inhibition of MES and PTZ-induced convulsions. Interestingly, the phenytoin (25 mg/kg) and diazepam (5 mg/Kg) were used as reference standards in MES and PTZ models respectively, have abolished the MES and PTZ-induced convulsions and mortality completely.
With the above finding it can be hypothesized that, the MeAA is eliciting potent anticonvulsant activity by increasing the inhibitory neurotransmitters (GABA) and/or, decreasing the excitatory neurotransmission and/or, by blocking the sodium channels and/or by neutralizing the PTZ binding site. To explore the possible mechanism of action, the effect of MeAA was evaluated for its influence on GABA levels in brain. Interestingly, pretreatment with MeAA (200 and 400 mg/kg) showed significant increase in GABA levels in whole brain other than cerebellum, upon multiple dose (3 days) administration, compared to control. Thus we can conclude that one of possible mechanism behind the anticonvulsant effect of MeAA may be through GABA mediated inhibition in brain. To confirm this hypothesis further, the anticonvulsant effect of MeAA was examined in presence of flumazenil, which is a GABA A receptor antagonist; in literature many researchers have used this test to confirm the GABA mediated mechanism behind the anticonvulsant, sedative and hypnotic activities (Shannon et al. ; Rundfeldt et al. ; John ; Li et al. ; Bruno et al. ). In these studies, researchers have used GABA A receptor agonist like benzodiazepine drugs (diazepam) along with GABA A receptor antagonists such as flumazenil, and reported that the GABA A receptor mediated activities such as anti-seizure, sedative, hypnotic and addiction properties of benzodiazepines were reversed in presence of flumazenil, and these results were further confirmed in receptor binding studies (Li et al. ; Sean et al. ;Christiaan et al. ). In addition, flumazenil is also used as a tool to identify the putative endogenous and exogenous ligands at benzodiazepine receptor sites (Uhlirova et al. ). Keeping this strong scientific literature, in present study we have evaluated the anticonvulsant effect of MeAA (400 mg/kg, p.o.) and diazepam (5 mg/kg, p.o.) in presence of flumazenil (5 mg/kg, i.p.) against PTZ-induced convulsions. Interestingly, the diazepam (5 mg/kg, p.o.) and MeAA (400 mg/kg, p.o.) alone treated groups showed significant anticonvulsant activity compared to control. However, the anticonvulsant effect of diazepam (5 mg/kg, p.o.) and MeAA (400 mg/kg, p.o.) was completely abolished when co-administered along with flumazenil. The blockade of anticonvulsant action of diazepam validates the test procedure, while blockade of MeAA anticonvulsant activity in presence of flumazenil (5 mg/kg, i.p.) confirmed the GABA A mediated mechanism behind the anticonvulsant effect of MeAA. Notably, the MeAA (400 mg/kg, p.o.) and diazepam (5 mg/kg, p.o.) combination showed synergistic effect against PTZ-induced convulsion, the anticonvulsant effect of the combination ( p < 0.001) was more compared to their per se treated groups (MeAA 400 mg/kg ( p < 0.05), diazepam 5 mg/kg ( p < 0.01)). Thus we can conclude that anticonvulsant effect of MeAA is mediating through GABAergic pathway.
In addition, to study the possible involvement of the excitatory neurotransmitter (glutamate), the MeAA (100, 200, 400 and 800 mg/kg) was evaluated against NMDA-induced lethality in mice, systemic administration of NMDA to mice showed variable effects such as scratching behavior, tile biting, tonic-clonic seizures and lethality. Since the behavioral effects and convulsions produced are not consistent with the animals, lethality was selected as a reliable end point (Leander et al. ). In this study, MeAA did not showed significant protection against NMDA-induced lethality, and thus confirmed the negligible role of glutaminergic pathway in the anticonvulsant effect of MeAA.
In addition, the effect of MeAA was evaluated for its possible locomotor deficits; however the MeAA did not show significant influence on locomotor activity.
In conclusion, all the findings in the present study are in mutual relation and supports that MeAA possess potent anticonvulsant activity and it could be a useful agent in treating both petit mal and grand mal epilepsy. Furthermore, In support of all these findings, the LC-MS/MS analysis of MeAA confirmed the presence of kaempferol, gallic acid, quercetin and rutin; and previously various phytoconstituents such as quercetin. Triterpenoid saponins (A&B), achyranthine, betaine, steroids and so on were isolated from Achyranthes aspera (Bhosale et al. ), and these phytoconstituents were earlier reported to be responsible for CNS depressant and anxiolytic activity of Achyranthes aspera (Bhosale et al. , ). In similar lines, the plant constituents identified in MeAA such as kaempferol (Calderón-Montaño et al. ), gallic acid (Maria et al. ), quercetin (Formica and Regelson ; Gregory ), rutin (Aditya and Ajay were scientifically well demonstrated to possess neurological properties such as anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, sedative, and CNS depressant and so on (Anandhan et al. ; Chakraborty et al. ; Barua et al. , ; Sasso et al. ). Furthermore, triterpenoid saponins are well known exhibit agonistic/facilitatory activities at GABA A receptor complex, which led to the hypothesis that they act similar to benzodiazepine-like molecules, which is supported by their behavioral effects in animal models of CNS depression and anxiety (Anandhan et al. ; Chakraborty et al. ; Barua et al. , ; Gatta et al. ). In conclusion, based on these observations we can declare that, the MeAA contains mixture of few neuroprotective phytoconstituents and the synergistic interaction of the phytoconstituents present in MeAA is eliciting anticonvulsant activity through GABA A receptor agonistic action by enhancing GABA levels in the brain.
Conclusion
These findings demonstrate that MeAA possess significant anticonvulsant property, interestingly the MeAA showed significant increase in brain GABA levels, and notably the anticonvulsant action of MeAA was abolished by flumazenil, thus confirmed the involvement of GABAergic pathway, and thus confirmed that one of the possible mechanism/s behind the anticonvulsant activity of MeAA may be mediating through GABAergic pathway. Furthermore, the MeAA has failed to inhibit the NMDA-induced lethality, and thus confirmed the negligible role of glutaminergic pathway. All these findings together strongly confirmed the possible mechanism of GABAergic pathway behind the anticonvulsant activity of MeAA. Indeed, there is scope for supplementary studies to isolate the component responsible for anticonvulsant activity of MeAA.
