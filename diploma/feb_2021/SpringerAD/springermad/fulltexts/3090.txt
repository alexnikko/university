Introduction
Uterine sarcomas (US) are rare tumor arising from the smooth muscles and connective tissue elements of the uterus. They are rare, accounting for 7–8% of all uterine cancers and less than 1% of all female genital tract cancers [ ]. They are truly heterogenous tumors, with a vast histopathological diversity, different clinical presentations, response to therapy and outcomes. Despite aggressive treatment even at early stage diseases, local recurrence and distant metastases are very common. However, outcomes do vary significantly based on specific histology. Overall survival is poor with 5-year survival rates of 50–70% for Stage 1 disease and dismal rates of 0–20% for remaining stages [ , ].
According to the 2003 World Health Organization (WHO) classification, uterine sarcoma is classified into mesenchymal tumors and mixed epithelial and mesenchymal tumors. Mesenchymal tumors are further classified into leiomyosarcoma (LMS),endometrial stromal sarcoma (ESS) and undifferentiated uterine sarcoma (US). Mixed tumors include carcinosarcoma (CS) and adenosarcoma (AS). In 2009, the classification of uterine sarcomas changed, modifying their staging and histologic classification, consequently their proportional distribution changed. The new staging system has two divisions, one for leiomyosarcoma and endometrial stromal sarcoma (ESS), and one for adenosarcoma. Carcinosarcoma is still staged using the endometrial carcinoma staging system [ ].
Surgery is a cornerstone in the treatment of a majority of soft tissue sarcoma including US. Addition of radiotherapy, chemotherapy or hormonal therapy depends on the stage of the disease. Due to its rarity, heterogeneity and aggressiveness, there is no consensus and scarce evidence regarding the optimal therapeutic approaches with considerable variation in the type of surgery and choice of adjuvant treatment. Furthermore, the recent change in their classification has given rise to the need for conducting new studies to evaluate the best treatment alternatives in this group of uterine tumors.
Our aim was to study the newly diagnosed cases of uterine sarcoma in terms of clinical and histopathological characteristics, prognostic factors, treatment outcome, and pattern of relapse and survival. It is based on the experience of a referral center during 13 years. This study contributes with relevant information on the result of initial treatment with or without adjuvant treatment in our milieu, reflecting our experience in the management of these tumors.
Materials and Methods
This is an observational retrospective study of all cases of histological proven uterine sarcoma (as per the 2003 WHO Classification) identified between January 2001 and December 2013 at the Department of Gynecologic Oncology, Gujarat Cancer and Research Institute, Ahmedabad. Out of total 70 cases operated at our institute, 57 were included in our study, whose complete medical records were available. The data regarding follow-up for these patients were collected till Dec 2016 and analyzed.
The data regarding the patients’ characteristics, tumor characteristics, various treatment modalities, operative details, follow-up and survival were reviewed and recorded. The stages of the disease were determined and adjusted retrospectively according to the FIGO staging 2009. The surgical procedures included one of the following procedures: hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (H+BSO), H+BSO+staging (pelvic lymphnode dissection, omentectomy) or H+BSO+debulking (cytoreductive surgery). Patients were given adjuvant therapy (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormonal therapy, alone or in combination) based on the patients’ performance status and final histopathological diagnosis.
Results
Patient’s Characteristics (Table 1)
Total 57 were included in our study, and majority of cases belonged to the age group 41–60 years. LMS was the most common presenting histopathological type (42%), followed by CS (40%), followed by ESS (12%), and the least was AS (6%) (Fig. 1 ). Mostly, the patients presented to the hospital with abnormal vaginal bleeding, lower abdominal pain, abnormal discharge per vaginum and abdominal distension. As observed in our study, most patients belonged to stage I (38), followed by stage III (9), stage II (7) and stage IV (3).

Surgery and Histopathology (Table 2)
All patients underwent total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. In addition, pelvic lymphadenectomy was done in 28 cases and omentectomy in 12 cases. Ovarian metastasis was identified in 5 cases (5/57); nodal metastasis in 6 patients (6/28) and omentum metastasis in 6 cases (6/12).

Surgical Challenges
Bladder was injured and repaired in 4 cases due to dense adhesions (2-LMS; 2-ESS). Bowel resection and anastomosis were needed in 3 cases to attain optimal debulking of the tumor (1 each LMS, CS, ESS). Frozen pelvis which was declared inoperable outside was operated here with surgical difficulty. Ureteric canal dissection and internal iliac artery ligation were required in a few cases.
Adjuvant Therapy (Table 3)
Twenty-four (24/57) cases were stage 1a and were kept on observation (11-CS, 10-LMS; 3-ESS). Adjuvant chemotherapy was given in 21% (12/57) in view of stage III/IV disease (6-LMS; 2 in each -CS, ESS, AS). Fourteen cases (17%0) received adjuvant external beam radiotherapy following hysterectomy (5-LMS, 8-CS and 1-AS). All these cases were in their early stage (stage Ib, II). Both chemotherapy and radiotherapy together as an adjuvant therapy were given in 5 cases (3-LMS and 2-CS). Chemotherapy along with hormonal therapy was given in one case and chemotherapy+radiotherapy+hormonal therapy in another case of ESS. One case of ESS received radiotherapy along with hormonal therapy as adjuvant therapy.

Recurrence (Table 4)
Almost 50% of the patients recurred during our study period. Maximum recurrences had occurred within first year of completion of treatment (8 cases within first 6 months and 9 cases recurred in next 6 months) and in CS (56.5%) and ESS (57%) cases. During first 5 years, 10 out of 24 (41.5%) cases of LMS recurred. Out of which, in 4 cases debulking surgery was done and they are alive and free of disease till date. Rest 6 cases had distant metastasis (abdomen, lung) for which combination chemotherapy was given (gemcitabine+docetaxel/ifosfamide+doxorubucin). Total 13 patients with CS recurred (56.6%). Two of them had pelvic recurrence for which pelvic mass removal was done and presently both of them are alive and free of disease. Rest 11 of the cases had distant metastasis (abdomen and lung) for which different chemotherapeutic agents were used (single agent carboplatin/carboplatin+paclitaxel/cisplatin+cyclophosamide/ifosfamide+doxorubicin). Four cases (57%) out of the seven ESS patients recurred within first 5 years. All of the four cases had abdominal recurrence. In two cases, debulking surgery was done and they were hormone receptor positive (ER+/PR+) and were started on hormonal therapy, and the rest 2 received chemotherapy (cisplatin+cyclophosphamide).

Survival (Table 5)
Overall 37/57 (64%) of the patients survived till 3 years and 23/43 (53%) of patients survived till 5 years of follow-up. Fifteen patients (26%) died within first year of completion of treatment. Different type of uterine sarcoma wise distribution of survival rate is given in Table 5 .

Discussion
Uterine sarcoma is one of the most aggressive and rare tumors affecting female genital tract. Over time, it has been difficult to study the characteristics of uterine sarcoma as it is a rare tumor with diverse histological features, and several changes have been made in its classification.
Staging is currently the most important prognostic factor among all histological types, and standard procedure for staging uterine sarcomas includes total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH) with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO), peritoneal cytology, and debulking of metastatic deposits and nodules. In our series, the surgical procedure was mostly total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.
The most debatable topic, however, is the role of optimal cytoreduction in advanced disease, the need for performing lymphadenectomy (LND), and that of preserving the ovaries as many women with uterine sarcomas are premenopausal at the time of initial diagnosis; therefore, concerns about fertility and premature menopause should be considered [ , , ]. Fertility-preserving options are extremely limited, but are possible in a few highly select cases.
The risk of overall lymph node metastasis in LMS is approximately 7%. However, the rate of occult lymph node metastasis is less than 3%. There is no clear benefit to routine lymphadenectomy in patients who present with uterine LMS confined to the uterus and/or clinically normal lymph nodes.
Carcinosarcomas have a higher rate of overall (27%) and occult (20%) lymph node metastasis. The role of lymphadenectomy beyond debulking of enlarged lymph nodes is still to be determined [ , , , ]. Nemani and colleagues suggested that there is a benefit to lymphadenectomy, irrespective of the use of RT. However, the current standard is that all patients, regardless of stage, receive adjuvant systemic chemotherapy (CT). It is quite possible that the therapeutic benefit of lymphadenectomy, if any, in patients with CS may be tempered by this. Nodal dissection in this setting is reasonable and is considered to be standard treatment.
The rate of overall and occult lymph node metastasis in ESS is 16% and 6%, respectively. Deep myometrial invasion and extensive lymph–vascular space invasion (LVSI) further increase the risk of occult metastasis. These features are often not obvious at the time of hysterectomy. There is no clear known survival advantage to routine lymphadenectomy in these patients. Nevertheless, it may be reasonable to consider lymphadenectomy at the time of hysterectomy, recognizing that the therapeutic, prognostic or predictive value of this in ESS is unknown [ ]. Reoperation to complete a lymphadenectomy is not likely to be of any benefit in ESS that does not exhibit deep stromal invasion or extensive LVSI [ , , ].
The rate of lymph node metastasis in adenosarcomas is approximately 3%. On the basis of very limited information, lymphadenectomy in patients with disease clinically confined to the uterus may not offer much benefit. In our study, almost 50% of our patients underwent pelvic lymphadenectomy (Table 2 ) and lymph node metastasis was present in 21.45% cases.
The risk of ovarian metastasis is very low in LMS. Routine oophorectomy, especially in premenopausal patients, provides no benefit. Even in our study the rate of ovarian metastasis was found to be 8.78% in US. A SEER analysis actually suggested worse survival in patients undergoing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO). It is not entirely clear why removal of the ovaries would lead to a worse prognosis, but at the very least these data support retention of the ovaries in premenopausal women who want to retain ovarian function. Occult ovarian metastasis can be seen in approximately 12% of CS. BSO should be recommended for these patients; fortunately, many are postmenopausal. Occult ovarian metastasis in ESS is rare. Ovarian preservation appears to be associated with a higher risk of recurrence; however, this has no impact on OS, and these patients do very well in general. BSO is recommended to reduce the risk of recurrence, but this should be carefully discussed with young premenopausal women. The risk of ovarian metastasis and therapeutic benefit is difficult to discern, because of a lack of large series addressing it in this and other rare uterine sarcomas [ , , ].
Currently no standard therapy has been recommended for patients with advanced and recurrent disease, and our patients underwent additional cytoreductive surgery (CRS) whenever feasible [ , , ]. CRS may be a reasonable consideration in highly select cases, in which complete resection of tumor is believed to be feasible without the need for extensive procedures such as exenteration. The potential benefit of surgery should be weighed against the potential risks, and these cases must be individually managed [ , ]. Complete surgical resection may be the best option for uterine sarcomas because the role of effective adjuvant treatment remains undetermined [ , ].
When it comes to adjuvant treatment, a wide variation has been observed in most centers including ours. The benefit of radiotherapy (RT) in the treatment of US, specially localized disease, is controversial. No prospective studies have detected survival value with postoperative radiation for patients with localized disease. Also, the role of adjuvant chemotherapy and hormonal therapy for the treatment of uterine sarcoma is still poorly defined [ , , ]. The role of adjuvant RT for patients with LMS is highly controversial, and it is often not generally indicated after complete resection of Stage I/II LMS because the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer trial 55,874 (a randomized study, level of evidence II) failed to show any benefit of postoperative adjuvant RT to treat Stage I and Stage II LMS [ , , , ]. Postoperative RT did not improve local (20% with RT vs. 24% without RT) or distant progression rates and did not have any impact on survival.
Management with systemic therapy in US currently has fallen in terms of its level of evidence; this is due to that the CS has been eliminated from the newest classification and has come to be treated as endometrial epithelial tumor, resulting in the low frequency of uterine sarcomas. Similar to adjuvant RT, the benefits of CT for patients who had complete resection for uterus-limited disease are also controversial. The first-line reasonable regimens include doxorubicin (19% of response rate), doxorubicin plus ifosfamide (17% of response rate for ifosfamide alone, and 30% of response rate for combination), gemcitabine (20% of response rate), and gemcitabine plus docetaxel (36% of response rate), and the second-line therapy includes pazopanib, trabectedin, dacarbazine, or temozolomide or fixed dose-rate gemcitabine plus docetaxel after doxorubicin-treated failure (27% of response rate). Hormonal therapy has a role in ESS with advanced and recurrent disease, if ER, PR receptor positive [ ]. Other series reported a variable percentage of patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy (50–60% for adjuvant chemotherapy and 5–30% for adjuvant radiotherapy) [ , , ].
Almost 50% of the patients recurred in our study. Majority of them recurred within the first year of completion of treatment and in CS and ESS. Owing to lack of definitive therapy, different surgical procedures and chemotherapeutic agents were used for treatment of recurrence. Other series reported an incidence of relapse between 30 and 37% [ , ]. Overall 64% of the patients survived till 3 years and 53% till 5 years of follow-up. Twenty-six percent of the cases died within first year of completion of treatment. The low mortality rate in our study may be attributed to the large number of cases being in early stage [ , , ].
Data are limited with respect to CRS of recurrent uterine sarcomas. However, CRS may be considered in many of these cases, especially if the patient has had a relatively long disease-free interval and the sites of recurrence appear amenable to a complete surgical resection. Surgery is often considered for recurrent ESS because of the relative indolence of these tumors, long disease-free intervals and lack of other effective treatments. Currently, the approach to carcinosarcoma is often extrapolated from data for endometrial carcinomas. Resection of recurrent LMS has been described. Surgery for other sarcomas is often considered, but there is no data regarding these very rare uterine sarcomas.
Several chemotherapeutic agents have been studied in the treatment of US but to a variable response. Recurrent LMS have been treated with variable response with doxorubicin, ifosfamide, paclitaxel and gemcitabine. Similarly, cisplatin, ifosfamide, paclitaxel and carboplatin have been evaluated in recurrent CS with poor response. Low grade endometrial sarcomas have a high frequency of progesterone receptors, making progestational agents reasonable in the management of recurrent ESS; however, limited success has also been achieved with ifosfamide and doxorubicin [ , , ].
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is often employed as an adjunct to morphology in uterine mesenchymal lesions, particularly in cases with equivocal features. The routine immunomarker panel used by most surgical pathologist to distinguish ESS from LMS consists of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), desmin, smooth muscle actin (SMA), h-caldesmon and CD10. Immunoprofiles such as ER+/PR+/desmin−/SMA−/h-caldesmon−/CD10+usually support the diagnosis of ESS and immunoprofiles showing desmin+/SMA+/h-Caldesmon+/vimentin+/CD10- support LMS [ ].
Several genetic alterations have been studied in uterine sarcomas. Loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 10 is present in up to 75% of LMS. Abnormalities of the retinoblastoma–cyclin D pathway and p16 (also known as cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of LMS. Studies addressing the potential role of targeted therapy in LMS have identified activation and overexpression of phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) as well as the companionate phospholipase D–phosphatidic acid (PLD-DA) pathway in LMS and STUMP (smooth muscle tumor of unknown malignant potential) but have shown modest results [ ].
Conclusion
Our data must be interpreted in the context of our retrospective study design; however, coming from a large tertiary care referral center, the data can be used to help in determining and studying treatment plans in US. There is a need for increased surgical expertise and a detailed anatomical knowledge for adequate treatment of the patients. Cytoreductive surgery can be helpful even in recurrent cases. The management of uterine sarcomas is challenging due to the rare occurrence, lack of consensus or guidelines and adequate literature. Adjuvant treatment should be individualized, especially hormonal therapy in ESS. Targeted therapy may hold a promising role in the near future. However, prospective, multicenter studies with larger number of patients are required to determine a standardized treatment protocols for uterine sarcomas.
