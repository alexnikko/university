Introduction
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) today is responsible for approximately one third of deaths worldwide and that figure will surely increase in both developing and developed countries as risk factors for the disease, primarily dyslipidemia, hypertension, obesity, diabetes, physical inactivity, poor diet, and smoking continue to increase [ ]. Although the present high burden of CVD deaths is in itself an adequate reason for attention, a greater cause for concern is the early age of CVD deaths in developing countries compared with developed countries. The need to contain the epidemic as well as combat its impact and minimize the CVD toll in terms of mortality and morbidity in the developing countries is, therefore, obvious and urgent [ ]. High blood pressure, obesity, diabetes, and elevated blood cholesterol are the most important predictors of CVD. High blood pressure contributes to around half of all cardiovascular disease [ ] and therefore require immediate intervention. In addition to lifestyle changes, effective medication is required to control high blood pressure.
Beta-blockers are effective as monotherapy in hypertensive patients [ ]. Metoprolol succinate (MS) is a selective beta-1 (cardioselective) adrenoreceptor blocking agent, useful in treatment of hyper tension, angina, and heart failure [ ]. It was first introduced as a tartrate salt and had pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties that necessitated twice- to thrice-daily dosing. MS has a relatively short half-life, is completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and exhibits a degree of ß-blockade that corresponds well with plasma concentrations, and this is particularly well suited to be formulated as a controlled release dosage form. A number of controlled release metoprolol formulations are currently available on the international market [ ]. The existing marketed formulation of MS is matrix based and their principle drug release mechanism is based on diffusion through the matrix system. The diffusion is altered by the pH of the medium, presence of food and hydrodynamic condition, and the body’s other physiological conditions. Therefore, a controlled release device able to deliver the drug at a constant zero-order rate independent of hydrodynamic condition of the body is highly desired.
Among controlled release devices, osmotically driven systems hold a prominent place because of their reliability and ability to deliver the contents at pre-determined zero-order rates for prolonged periods with drug release independent of physiological environment and pH [ , , , , , , ]. Moreover, the number of patents granted for the last few years and its strong market potential as evident from the marketed products justifies the worthy choice of osmotic pump [ ].
Although the design of osmotic pump is very ingenious, various shortcomings exist in the preparation of conventional osmotic pump by laser drilling techniques such as high cost, low yield, and tedious process. Thus the development of osmotic pump having simple structure, low difficulty in industrialized production, and low production cost is an important field of research [ ].
Based on such facts and requirements, an attempt was made to develop the controlled porosity osmotic pump (CPOP) tablet of MS. The coating composition of CPOP includes pore-forming agent, which generates pores in contact with aqueous media [ ], thereby circumventing the need for a laser or mechanical drilling [ ]. The CPOP has an advantage as the drug is released from the whole surface of the device rather than from a single hole which may reduce stomach irritation problem [ ].
In CPOP formulation, coating components such as semipermeable membrane, pore former, and plasticizer play a crucial role as the drug release is majorly governed by these factors. Thus a three-level three factorial Box–Behnken experimental design (BBD) was used to characterize and optimize formulation parameters, i.e., level of semipermeable membrane, pore former, and plasticizer. Box–Behnken design is having the maximum efficiency for an experiment involving three factors and three levels; further, the number of experiments conducted for this is much lesser compared to a central composite design. These designs do not have axial points and they ensure that all factors are never simultaneously set at their high levels. Therefore, all the design points fall within the safe operating zone [ , , ].
The present work aims at (1) fabrication of a simple, elegant, and cost-effective CPOP tablet of MS; (2) optimization of formulation by response surface methodology using BBD; (3) its comparison with marketed sustained release (SR) tablet; and (4) In vivo study of optimized CPOP tablet of MS in beagle dogs.
Materials and Methods
Materials
Metoprolol succinate (MS) was purchased from CTX Life Sciences Pvt. Ltd. (Surat, Gujarat, India). Microcrystalline cellulose was obtained from FMC Biopolymer, Ireland. Lactose monohydrate was a gift sample from DFE Pharma, Germany. Povidone (K30) was obtained from ISP, USA. Magnesium stearate was obtained from Avantor Performance Materials Inc., USA. Cellulose acetate (CA) was a gift sample from Eastman Chemical Ltd., USA. Mannitol was a gift sample from Roquette Pharma, France. Triethyl citrate (TEC) was obtained from Vertellus Performance Materials, USA. Commercial extended release (ER) tablets of MS (Toprol XL, 200 and 50 mg) were purchased from AstraZenica, DE, USA. All other chemicals and solvents used were of analytical grade.
Methods
Preparation of Core Tablets
For the preparation of MS core tablets, MS was blended with microcrystalline cellulose and lactose monohydrate in rapid mixer granulator (Sainath Boilers and Pneumatics, Mumbai, India) for 10 min. Binder solution was prepared by dissolving Povidone (K30) in required quantity of purified water. MS premix was granulated using Povidone binder solution. The granules were dried in rapid dryer at 60 °C (Retsch TG200, Germany). The dried granules were milled using quadro co-mill (Gansons Limited, Mumbai, India) fitted with 40G Screen. The milled granules were blended with magnesium stearate (60 sieve passed) for 5 min and compressed into tablets using a rotary tablet compression machine (Cadmach CMD4-16, India) fitted with 12.00 mm, round, standard concave punches under a pressure of 12–14 kp. To avoid batch-to-batch variation, a single batch of granules was prepared (Table 1 ). The compressed tablets were stored in well-closed containers prior to coating.

Screening of Coating Parameters and Their Levels
The major component of osmotic pump coat is semipermeable membrane. Cellulose acetate (CA) is one of the most commonly employed semi permeable rate-controlling membranes for osmotic drug delivery systems [ , ]. Water soluble pore formers are being used in the semipermeable membrane to modulate the release of the drug [ ]. Plasticizers are added to modify the physical properties and improve film-forming characteristics of polymers [ ]. CA along with a range of water-soluble pore formers (hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, mannitol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone) and plasticizers (dibutyl sebacate, triethyl citrate and polyethylene glycol 400) were evaluated during the screening study. Tablets were coated using stainless steel automated perforated pan (O’Hara Technologies Inc., LC-M, Canada) with Cellulose acetate dissolved in 90:10 ( w / w ) of acetone/water mixture containing pore former and plasticizer at various concentration under the following conditions: pan rotating rate was 18–20 rpm, spray rate was 5–7 g/min, drying was achieved by a heat gun, and the coat thickness was calculated as the coating weight gain. Afterward, the coated tablets were incubated at 50 °C for 2 h in an oven to remove the residual coating solvent and to complete the film formation. The formulation containing CA coat with mannitol as pore former and triethyl citrate (TEC) as plasticizer exhibits optimum drug release pattern; hence, this formulation was selected for further optimization of levels. The levels of these parameters vary widely in different researches of osmotic formulations. The minimum and maximum level of CA, mannitol, and TEC were chosen based on the outcomes of preliminary trials.
Coating Optimization as per Experimental Design
A three-factor, three-level Box–Behnken design was used for the optimization process using statistical software (Design Expert® 6.0.10, Stat-Ease Inc., Minneapolis, USA). Other variables such as tablet cores and coating conditions were kept constant. The independent variables (factors) and their respective levels investigated together with the dependent variables (responses) and their constraints are shown in Table 2 . These dependent variable constraints were used for obtaining a desirable drug release as described in literature [ , ]. These required constraints choice was based on USP specification criteria [ ] and zero-order release kinetic as below. Table 2 Factors and respective levels investigated in the Box–Behnken design together with the responses and their constraints Factors Levels investigated Low (−1) High (+) X 1 : Semipermeable polymer (mg) (cellulose acetate) 20 40 X 2 : Pore former (mg) (mannitol) 5 45 X 3 : Plasticizer (mg) (triethyl citrate) 2 8 Responses Constraints Y 1 : Cumulative % drug released in 1 h ( Q % 1h ) 0 % ≤ Y 1 ≤ 25 % Y 2 : Cumulative % drug released in 4 h ( Q % 4h ) 20 % ≤ Y 2 ≤ 40 % Y 3 : Cumulative % drug released in 8 h ( Q % 8h ) 40 % ≤ Y 3 ≤ 60 % Y 4 : Cumulative % drug released in 20 h ( Q % 20h ) 80 % ≤ Y 4 ≤ 100 % Y 5 : R 2 (regression coefficient of release data fitted to zero-order equation (RSQ zero )) Maximum (>0.9)
The constraints were set by giving a range for each response around its calculated value. The cumulative percentage of drug released was considered to be not more than 25 % at initial release period to assure against premature release, about 50 % release at around half the release period to have consistent profile and an ideal drug release of not less than 80 % at last time point to provide assertion of complete release. RSQ zero (which is the regression coefficient of release data fitted to zero-order release equation) was chosen to be maximized to ensure fitting of the release data to zero-order release kinetics.
The preparation of the tablets according to suggested trials as well as the release studies were done in random order. The proposed Box–Behnken design requires 17 runs for data acquisition and modeling the response surface. The trials listed in standard order are shown in Table 3 . Table 3 The composition and observed responses of the Box–Behnken design with trials listed in the standard order of this design Trial Factors Responses X 1 X 2 X 3 Y 1 ( Q % 1h ) Y 2 ( Q % 4h ) Y 3 ( Q % 8h ) Y 4 ( Q % 20h ) Y 5 (RSQ zero ) T 1 30 25 5 7 22 45 96 0.978 T 2 20 25 8 20 60 88 100 0.717 T 3 30 25 5 9 24 49 100 0.994 T 4 20 45 5 30 84 96 99 0.492 T 5 30 25 5 8 22 48 100 0.994 T 6 20 25 2 22 30 62 80 0.877 T 7 40 25 2 12 30 60 82 0.889 T 8 30 45 2 15 58 86 100 0.724 T 9 30 45 8 25 74 97 99 0.558 T 10 30 5 8 5 15 35 68 0.985 T 11 20 5 5 22 40 70 100 0.931 T 12 40 5 5 2 10 19 39 0.990 T 13 40 45 5 20 74 99 98 0.519 T 14 30 25 5 7 22 46 98 0.996 T 15 30 25 5 6 21 42 97 0.999 T 16 40 25 8 7 20 40 90 0.999 T 17 30 5 2 2 9 20 52 0.999 Where X 1 = cellulose acetate (mg), X 2 = mannitol (mg), X 3 = TEC (mg)
Optimization Data Analysis and Validation of Optimization Model
The response variables which were considered for systematic Design of Expert (DOE) optimization included Q % 1h , Q % 4h , Q % 8h , Q % 20h , and RSQ zero . For the studied design, the multiple linear regression analysis (MLRA) method was applied using Design Expert software to fit full second-order polynomial equation with added interaction terms to correlate the studied responses with the examined variables. The polynomial regression results were demonstrated for the studied responses. Finally, the optimum formulation was chosen using overlay plots, drawn using the Design Expert® software. The quality of the fitted model was expressed by the coefficient of determination ( R 2 ) and its statistical significance was checked by analysis of variance ( p test) [ ]. Validation of DOE optimization results were carried out by selecting five formulations ( T 1 , T 7 , T 12 , T 14 , and T 18 ) as the confirmatory checkpoints [ , , ].
In Vitro Drug Release Study
The developed formulations were subjected to in vitro drug release studies as per USP monograph for MS-ER tablet [ ], using the USP Type II dissolution test apparatus (Distek Evolution 6300, USA) at a paddle speed of 50 rpm. The dissolution medium was 500 ml of pH 6.8 phosphate buffer and the study was carried out for 20 h at 37 ± 0.5 °C. Ten milliliters was withdrawn and replaced by the same amount of fresh medium at 1, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 h. Samples were filtered using 0.45-μm polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) filter, suitably diluted, and the absorbance was measured at 275 nm using UV spectrophotometer (UV-2600, Shimadzu, Japan).
A comparative evaluation of optimized formulation has also been done with marketed ER tablets of MS (Toprol XL 200). Moore and Flanner proposed a model-independent mathematical approach to compare the dissolution profile using difference factor ( f 1 ) and a similarity factor ( f 2 ) [ ]; $$ {\mathrm{f}}_1=\left\{\left[{\sum_{\mathrm{t}=1}}^{\mathrm{n}}\left|{\mathrm{R}}_{\mathrm{t}}-{\mathrm{T}}_{\mathrm{t}}\right.\right]/\left[{\sum_{\mathrm{t}=1}}^{\mathrm{n}\ }{\mathrm{R}}_{\mathrm{t}}\right]\right\}\times 100 $$ (1) $$ {\mathrm{f}}_2=50\times \log \left\{{\left[1+\left(1/\mathrm{n}\right){\sum_{\mathrm{t}=1}}^{\mathrm{n}}{\left({\mathrm{R}}_{\mathrm{t}}-{\mathrm{T}}_{\mathrm{t}}\right)}^2\right]}^{-0.5} \times 100\right\} $$ (2) where n is the number of time points, R t is the dissolution value of the reference batch at time t , and T t is the dissolution value of the test batch at time t . The f 1 values up to 15 (0–15) and f 2 values greater than 50 (50–100) ensures sameness or equivalence of the two curves, and thus, of the performance of the test and reference products.
Kinetic Modeling
Dissolution data of the developed formulations were fitted into various mathematical models (zero-order, first-order, and Higuchi) in order to describe the kinetics of drug release after in situ formation of delivery pores. The coefficient of determination ( R 2 ) and the correlation coefficient ( r ) were used as criteria for choosing the most appropriate model [ ] .
Characterization of Optimized Formulation
Effect of pH
To study the effect of pH on the performance of the developed formulation, release studies of the optimized formulations were performed in media of different pH, such as pH 1.2, and 6.8 and pH change method [The dissolution media was 0.1 N HCl (pH 1.2) for the first 2 h, acetate buffer (pH 4.5) for the next 2 h, followed by phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) for the remaining period of 20 h] [ ]. Release studies were carried out in 500 ml of media using USP II dissolution apparatus at rotation speed of 50 rpm. The sampling was done at pre-determined intervals and analyzed after filtration through 0.45-μm PVDF filter using UV spectrophotometer at 275 nm.
Effect of Agitation Speed
To study the effect of agitational intensity of the release media, dissolution studies of the optimized formulations were conducted in pH 6.8 phosphate buffer using USP II (Paddle) apparatus at various rotational speeds (50, 75, and 100 rpm) [ ]. Sampling was done at pre-determined intervals and analyzed after filtration through 0.45-μm PVDF filter using UV spectrophotometer at 275 nm.
Effect of Osmotic Pressure
To confirm the major mechanism of drug release, release studies of the optimized formulations were carried out in media of different osmotic pressure [ ]. An osmotically effective solute (sodium chloride) was added in pH 6.8 phosphate buffer in order to increase the osmotic pressure of the media and osmotic pressure was measured (Advanced® Model 3320 Micro-Osmometer, USA) [ ]. Release studies were conducted in 500 ml of media using USP II dissolution apparatus at rotation speed of 50 rpm. Sampling was done at pre-determined intervals and analyzed after filtration through 0.45-μm PVDF filter using UV spectrophotometer at 275 nm.
Surface Morphology
The morphology and the porous structure of the developed tablet formulations before and after complete dissolution studies was examined using scanning electron microscope (JSM-6360, LV SEM, Jeol, Japan). Coating membrane from the exhausted shells was carefully cut after dissolution studies and dried at 50 °C for 12 h and stored between sheets of wax paper in dessicator until examination [ ].
Accelerated Stability Study
The optimized CPOP formulation of MS was packed in HDPE bottle and PVC blister packs and charged on ICH-specified accelerated stability condition of 40 °C and 75 % relative humidity (RH) for 6 months (Stability chamber, Thermolab Scientific equipment Pvt. Ltd, Mumbai, India) [ ]. The samples were withdrawn at specified time intervals and evaluated for drug content, hardness, burst strength, and release studies. Samples were withdrawn at pre-determined intervals and analyzed after filtration through 0.45-μm PVDF filter using UV spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 275 nm.
In Vivo Pharmacokinetic Study in Beagle Dogs
The optimized formulation along with the commercially available extended release marketed brand (Toprol XL) was subjected to in vivo evaluation in six healthy, male beagle dogs (8–10 kg). The study was designed as a single-dose fasting randomized crossover study. The animal study was approved and performed in accordance with Guideline for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animal (2011), Good Laboratory Practice, Amended version of Schedule Y (2013) of Drugs and Cosmetics Act and Guidelines for bioavailability and bioequivalence studies by CDSCO, India.
The dogs were fasted 12 h prior to drug administration. All the animals were allowed free access to water throughout the study. The test and reference formulations were orally administered separately in the two crossover experiments to beagle dogs. The dose of metoprolol for beagle dog was calculated as 47.5 mg/dog employing Eq. 3 , taking K m factor for human and dog as 37 and 20, respectively [ ]. $$ \mathrm{Animal}\;\mathrm{dose}=\mathrm{Human}\;\mathrm{dose}\times \left(\mathrm{Animal}\ {\mathrm{k}}_{\mathrm{m}}/\mathrm{Human}\;{\mathrm{K}}_{\mathrm{m}}\right) $$ (3)
Following drug administration, access to food and water was allowed ad libitum after 4 h. A washout period of 15 days after the last sampling was maintained in between each experiment.
Blood samples (3 mL) were collected from saphenous vein into heparinized tubes before administration (0 min) and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 h after administration. The blood samples were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min and the plasma were transferred and stored at −20 °C until analysis.
The content of metoprolol in plasma samples was extracted employing a previously reported procedure by Wang et al. [ ]. An aqueous solution of propranolol hydrochloride (1 μg/ml) was used as the internal standard. A total of 50 μl of this solution was pipetted into a 15-ml tube and evaporated to dryness at 60 °C under nitrogen flow. A 1.0-ml aliquot of dog plasma was added, and the samples were vortexed for 10 s. Next, 50 μl of NaOH (1 M) was added, and the sample was vortexed for another 10 s. Then, 3 ml of ether/dichloromethane (3:2, v / v ) was added to extract MS and propranolol hydrochloride. The mixture was vortexed for 2 min and then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min. The organic layer was transferred to a new tube and evaporated to dryness under nitrogen at 40 °C. The residue was dissolved in 100 ml of the mobile phase and vortexed, and 20 ml of this solution was injected onto the column for HPLC analysis.
MS plasma concentrations were determined using a validated high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) instrument (M/S Waters Corporation, WA, USA, Model: 2489) and a Waters Empower 2 software workstation. The HPLC system consisted of a Agilent Zorbax SB-C18 column (4.6 mm ID × 250 mm, 5-μm particle size) maintained at 25 °C with a mobile phase containing water/methanol/acetonitrile/phosphoric acid (60:25:15:0.05, v / v ) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. UV detection was performed at a wavelength of 220 nm.
Win NonLin software (Version 5.0, M/c Pharsight Corporation, CA, USA) was utilized to compute area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC), maximum drug concentration ( C max ), the time to reach maximum drug concentration ( T max ), and elimination half-life ( T 1/2 ). The pharmacokinetic parameters were presented as the mean ± SD.
Results
Formulation Development Using DOE
The results of Q % 1h , Q % 4h , Q % 8h , Q % 20h , and RSQ zero measured as response variables for 17 runs using statistical software (Design Expert® 6.0.10, Stat-Ease Inc., Minneapolis, USA) as per the experimental design are given in Table 3 .
Response Surface Analysis
The coefficients of the polynomial equation (Eq. 4 ), generated using MLRA for Q % 1h , Q % 4h , Q % 8h , Q % 20h , and RSQ zero formed excellent fits to the data, with the value of R 2 ranging between 0.975 and 0.999. $$ Y={\upbeta}_o+{\upbeta}_1{X}_1+{\upbeta}_2{X}_2+{\upbeta}_3{X}_1{X}_2+{\upbeta}_4{X_1}^2+{\upbeta}_5{X_2}^2+{\upbeta}_6{X}_1{X_2}^2+{\upbeta}_7{X}_2{X_1}^2 $$ (4) where, β o –β 7 depicts the various coefficients and X 1 and X 2 depict the independent variables. Y represents the response variable.
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to check the adequacy of the model for the responses in the experimentation. By applying ANOVA for the regression equations, all the resulting models were found to be significant ( p < 0.05) and thus useful in predicting the effects of the factors on the selected responses (Table 4 ) [ ]. Table 4 Probability value ( p value) for selected responses Response p value Y 1 <0.0001 Y 2 <0.0001 Y 3 <0.0001 Y 4 0.0006
Figure 1 depicts a steep decline in the values of Q % 1h with a decrease in the levels of mannitol at all levels of cellulose acetate, the decline being slightly more prominent at lower levels. However, cellulose acetate does not seem to exert that steep effect on the initial drug release. A distorted “U” type curve is observed with increasing the levels of cellulose acetate depicting an initial decline followed by rise in the values of Q % 1h with increasing the levels of cellulose acetate. Fig. 1 Response surface plot for the effect of cellulose acetate and mannitol on the value of Q % 1h of CPOP tablet of MS
Figure 2 depicts an inverted plateau-like trend in the values of Q % 4h with decreasing the levels of mannitol. The initial sharp decline gets converted to a linear trend with the values of Q % 4h not decreasing swiftly with further decrease in levels of mannitol. As observed in the case of Q % 1h , cellulose acetate does not seem to exert that prominent effect in regulating the values of Q % 4h . However, at lower levels of mannitol, the values of Q % 4h decrease with an increase in the levels of cellulose acetate. Cellulose acetate, being a hydrophobic polymer, imparts a water-repelling layer to the formulation, thus acting as a reservoir for the highly soluble active substance. Increase in semipermeable membrane thickness will lead to increase its resistance to imbibe the dissolution medium and lower the dissolving rate of the tablet core components which consequently reduces drug release rate from osmotic devices [ , ]. Fig. 2 Response surface plot for the effect of cellulose acetate and mannitol on the value of Q % 4h of CPOP tablet of MS
Figure 3 depicts a clear presence of some interaction between the two polymers as a sharp decrease in Q % 8h is observed with decreasing the levels of mannitol at higher levels of cellulose acetate, the effect being converted to a near linear trend at lower levels of cellulose acetate. Fig. 3 Response surface plot for the effect of cellulose acetate and mannitol on the value of Q % 8h of CPOP tablet of MS
Figure 4 depicts nearly complete release in all the formulations prepared as per the experimental design except in three formulations which contained very low levels of mannitol. This can be attributed to the reduced pore-forming capacity in the formulation which is imparted by mannitol [ ]. Fig. 4 Response surface plot for the effect of cellulose acetate and mannitol on the value of Q % 20h of CPOP tablet of MS
Elucidation of an Optimized Formulation and Validation of Optimization Model
The optimized formulation was selected by trading off the values of response variables (Fig. 5 ), adopting the USP optimization criteria to achieve the highest possible values of complete and controlled drug release with zero-order release kinetics. Fig. 5 Overlay contour plot showing the location of the desirable region for selection of optimized CPOP formulation of MS
The selected optimized formulation ( T 18 ) with coating composition of 31.17 mg of CA, 24.86 mg of mannitol, and 5 mg of TEC, exhibited Q % 1h of 6.85, Q % 4h of 21.96 %, Q % 8h of 45.67 %, and Q % 20h of 97.55 % and a zero-order release kinetic of 0.996, thus meeting the desired specification criteria.
Validation of model was carried out by comparing the observed and predicted responses from five check point formulations ( T 1 , T 7 , T 12 , T 14 , and T 18 ). Linear correlation plots between the predicted and observed responses demonstrated high values of r (~0.9 in all cases), indicating accuracy (fitness) of the model [ ].
In Vitro Drug Release Study
Figure 6 shows diverse dissolution profile of all the developed formulation as per the experimental design in pH 6.8 phosphate buffer. The optimized CPOP tablet of MS ( T 18 ) was compared with the extended release marketed brand, Toprol XL (Fig. 7 ). The value of difference factor ( f 1 ) equal to 7 and similarity factor ( f 2 ) equal to 67 clearly suggest the in vitro similarity between the prepared MS-CPOP tablets and marketed brand for the release of MS. Moreover, MS CPOP formulation is expected to have an extra-advantage because of its independent release of physiological factors such as gastric motility and pH and hence represents an effective therapy tool with less fluctuations in drug levels especially for patients suffering from some inflammatory bowel diseases characterized by low intestinal pH [ ] or in cases of variation in gastric emptying rate due to different physiological, pathological, or pharmacological factors [ ]. Fig. 6 In vitro drug release profile of different formulation trials as per DOE Fig. 7 Comparison of drug release profile of optimized CPOP formulation with marketed brand (Toprol XL)
Kinetic Modeling
Based on the best goodness of fit obtained from in vitro drug release data of the optimized formulation (Table 5 ), it was concluded that kinetics of optimized formulations fitted well into zero-order model with higher sum of correlation coefficient for zero-order compared to first-order and Higuchi model. The diffusion exponent of release profile (slope) has a value of ( n > 0.5 > 1), which indicates a zero-order release controlled by non Fickian diffusion (Anomalous Transport) [ ].

Characterization of Optimized Formulation
Effect of pH
To assure the consistent release of the drug irrespective of the pH of the dissolution media, release study of the optimized formulation was conducted in media of different pH. It is clearly evident from the data of Table 6 that the release profile is similar in all the media, demonstrating that the release of developed formulation is pH independent. Table 6 Effect of pH on release of MS from optimized formulation ( n = 6) Time (h) Cumulative % release ± SEM pH 6.8 pH 1.2 pH change 0 0.00 ± 0.00 0.00 ± 0.00 0.00 ± 0.00 1 7.00 ± 0.85 3.12 ± 1.54 12.10 ± 1.34 4 22.28 ± 2.47 19.10 ± 1.55 20.30 ± 2.32 8 46.10 ± 3.05 43.66 ± 2.20 46.30 ± 2.74 12 73.08 ± 3.11 70.81 ± 2.05 75.49 ± 3.65 16 84.09 ± 2.13 80.80 ± 2.40 82.68 ± 3.33 20 98.21 ± 1.87 92.05 ± 2.47 94.68 ± 1.86
Effect of Agitation Speed
To confirm the uniform release of drug independent of agitational intensity of the release media, release studies of the optimized formulation were carried out in dissolution medium at different agitation speed (50, 75, and 100 rpm). The dissolution data of Table 7 clearly indicated that release profile of optimized formulation is fairly independent of hydrodynamic condition of the body. Table 7 Effect of agitation intensity on release of MS from optimized formulation ( n = 6) Time (h) Cumulative % release ± SEM 50 rpm 75 rpm 100 rpm 0 0.00 ± 0.00 0.00 ± 0.00 0.00 ± 0.00 1 7.00 ± 0.85 8.01 ± 2.71 5.20 ± 1.52 4 22.28 ± 2.47 21.28 ± 1.74 21.21 ± 2.61 8 46.10 ± 3.05 44.10 ± 2.45 45.38 ± 1.73 12 73.08 ± 3.11 70.08 ± 2.87 75.49 ± 2.92 16 84.09 ± 2.13 86.09 ± 2.43 85.80 ± 2.97 20 98.21 ± 1.87 96.55 ± 2.77 98.85 ± 3.05
Effect of Osmotic Pressure
To study the effect of osmotic pressure on the drug release of optimized formulation, release studies of the optimized formulation was carried out in media of different osmotic pressure. The release profile of Table 8 prominently reflected the correlation between drug release and osmotic pressure. The drug release was found to decrease as the osmotic pressure of the media increased.

Surface Morphology
Figure 8 showed SEM micrographs of membrane surface of optimized formulations containing 40 % of mannitol before and after dissolution studies. The membrane before dissolution studies exhibits non-porous regions, which become porous after 16 h of dissolution owing to leaching of water soluble mannitol and generation of pores through which drug release takes place.

Accelerated Stability Studies
The stability samples of optimized formulation showed no significant changes in drug content and release profiles compared to the initial samples (Table 9 ). The burst strength of stability samples also exhibited no change compared to the initial samples.

Discussion
The present approach aimed to develop controlled release formulation of metoprolol succinate based on osmotic pump technology using hydrophilic pore formers instead of laser drilling and is devoid of disadvantages associated with matrix-based extended release marketed formulation. The tablet core were kept constant as the drug is freely water soluble and the diluents contain 30 % lactose, which together, create enough osmotic pressure for water entrance whereas the coating variables were evaluated for the optimization of drug release profile. The coating variables such as semipermeable polymer, pore former, and plasticizer content were optimized using response surface methodology by Box–Behnken Design employing Design Expert software.
Drug release was inversely related to the film former content in the membrane. This can be explained by the fact that the fluid had to penetrate the polymer coat of greater thickness as the polymer loading increases [ , ]. A linear correlation was observed between the drug release and the level of pore former attributable to more porous membrane structure at higher level of pore former, resulting in faster drug release [ , ]. Furthermore, a linear correlation was observed between the drug release and the level of plasticizer. Because of its hydrophilicity, plasticizer leaches easily and can create a porous structure, which increases membrane permeability and drug release rate [ ].
Response surface plots with various levels of semipermeable membrane and pore former at constant level of plasticizer (center point) are only depicted in 2D surfaces. The response surface analysis indicated that at low levels of mannitol, the value of Q % 1h decline at all levels of cellulose acetate. At lower levels of mannitol, the values of Q % 4h decrease with an increase in the levels of cellulose acetate. A sharp decrease in Q % 8h is observed with decreasing the levels of mannitol and increasing the levels of cellulose acetate reflecting an interaction between the two polymers. Complete drug release was observed at Q % 20h in all formulation containing higher levels of mannitol.
The result indicated that the impact of mannitol is more pronounced compared to CA at initial drug release whereas both mannitol and CA play a prominent role as the time progress and increase in CA content leads to decline in drug release. A synergistic role is played by two polymers at a constant level of plasticizer where increase in CA and mannitol does not hamper the drug release at time points where around 50 and 85 % drugs are released and near complete drug release was obtained in all formulations containing higher levels of mannitol.
The optimum formulation ( T 18 ) was elucidated out of DOE trials based on the desired USP specifications. The optimum formulation showed that zero order had the higher regression value compared to the first and Higuchi kinetics in the following order: R 0 2 (0.995), R 1 2 (0.859), R H 2 (0.884), which indicates that the release of MS from the prepared CPOP tablets predominantly follows zero-order kinetics with non fickian diffusion for 20 h.
The release of the drug from optimized formulation was unaffected by the environmental variables such as pH, extent of agitation, and drug release was controlled by osmotic pressure. The SEM showed microporous structure of the coating membrane before and after dissolution study. The surface of coated tablet was smooth and devoid of any distortion before coming into contact with the aqueous environment. After dissolution studies, coating was found to be intact with small pores in the membrane, which would possibly acted as delivery ports for the release of the drug in the aqueous environment.
Further, the comparison of release performance of the optimized formulation vis-à-vis the conventional marketed brand, Toprol XL indicated a comparable and sustained release performance of the optimized formulation with respect to marketed formulation with an added advantage of its independent release of physiological factors and less fluctuating drug levels.
The developed formulation was found to be robust and stable under ICH-specified stress condition of 40 °C/75 % RH for 6 months. The efficiency of the developed formulation was validated by in vivo performance. The CPOP formulation exhibited a C max of 40 ng/ml compared to 51 ng/ml for marketed SR formulation. Marked reduction in the value of C max , which is known to be a composite parameter indicative of both rate and extent of drug absorption was observed. This decline in the values of C max signifies a distinct reduction in the rate of drug absorption from optimized CPOP formulation, as the values of AUC tend to exhibit a rather ascending trend. This indicates a reduced rate of absorption and improved sustained release potential of optimized CPOP formulation. The same has also been supported by a significant increase in the values of T max . Moreover, significant reduction in the values of K el ( p < 0.001) points toward the tendency of large retention of drug in the body.
Conclusion
New design of osmotic pump tablet using water-soluble pore formers had been successfully prepared for extended delivery of MS. The combination of a water-insoluble semi permeable polymer with water-soluble pore formers and a plasticizer without the need of laser drilling represent a new and effective approach for the delivery of water-soluble MS, to be formulated in a simple and cost-effective method as CPOP tablet. In this study, the effect of each of the tablet coat component and its contribution to the release behavior were extensively optimized using BBD and the optimized formulation revealed that in order to have a good osmotic system; the level of semipermeable polymer, pore former, and plasticizer have to be carefully selected using response surface methodology. The optimized tablets showed satisfactory USP specification with high similarity to the marketed product Toprol XL and up to 98 % drug release at a rate of approximately zero order for up to 20 h, which indicate that the release pattern was independent of drug load. The in vivo study in beagle dog demonstrated the potential of developed CPOP as a preferred alternative to traditional oral ER formulations of MS. The results further verify the possibility of expanding the application field of this new CPOP tablets as platform technology for controlled drug delivery of other water-soluble drugs and water-insoluble drugs with the aid of solubility enhancers.
