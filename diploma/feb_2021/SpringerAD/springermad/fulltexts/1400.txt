Introduction
Ranjit Sagar Wetland is located in the district Gurdaspur (Punjab) is a man-made lacustrine wetland on the river Ravi with an area of 87.60 km 2 (Kumar et al. ). This wetland occupies three states, i.e., Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, and Jammu and Kashmir with the most acreage located in Himachal Pradesh (82%). The catchment area of this cold water wetland is estimated at 6086 km 2 , with reservoirs created by impoundments and serve as a significant fishery resource.
Myxozoans are microscopic, multicellular, spore-forming metazoan parasites belonging to the phylum Cnidaria. As primarily parasites of fish, they develop plasmodia/pseudocysts which can be either histozoic or coelozoic (Pote et al. ). Recent studies have shown that myxozoans evolved as an endoparasitic radiation of cnidarians exploiting invertebrate and vertebrate hosts (primarily fish) in fresh water and marine environments (Abdel-Ghaffar et al. , ). Currently, there are approximately 2200 nominal species classified into 67 genera and 17 families (Okamura and Gruhl ). The spore morphology has been the main criterion for myxozoan classification; however, molecular markers have revealed certain discrepancies between conventional myxospore identification and phylogenies based on 18S rRNA gene sequence (Morsy et al. , ).
The genus Thelohanellus (Myxobolidae) comprises a great diversity of species; as many as 108 nominal species have been described worldwide (Zhang et al. ). Recently, Kaur et al. ( ) gave a synopsis describing 52 nominal species of Thelohanellus parasitizing fishes in the Indian subcontinent. Certain Thelohanellus species cause emerging diseases and have been linked with environmental changes which impact wild and cultured populations of economically important fishes (Walker and Winton ; Singh and Kaur , , , , ; Kaur et al. , ; Singh and Kaur ; Kaur and Gupta ; Kaur et al. ; Kaur and Gupta , ; Gupta and Kaur , , , , ).
The present manuscript characterizes a new sp., Thelohanellus gabori , collected from the gills of a cyprinid fish Crossocheilus latius inhabiting Ranjit Sagar Wetland, Punjab (India).
Materials and methods
Live specimens ( n = 80) of Crossocheilus latius (mean length 10–15 cm) were procured from the various catchment sites of Ranjit Sagar Wetland. Fish were transported alive, with artificial aeration, to the Parasitology Laboratory of Punjabi University, Patiala. Prior to necroscopy, fish were euthanized with chloroform (60 mg/L). Gills and viscera were removed and examined by stereomicroscopy. The infected gill tissue samples were teased on a clean glass slide, and the fresh myxospores were photographed under phase contrast followed by Ziehl-Neelsen and iron-hematoxylin stains and were measured with a calibrated ocular micrometer.
For histopathological studies, the infected gills were fixed in Bouin’s fixative and dehydrated in ascending grades of ethanol (Molnar ). They were cleared in xylene followed by embedding in paraffin wax. The tissue samples were sectioned at 6–7 μm thickness and finally stained with Luna’s staining method with little modifications (Luna ). The sections were examined and photographed using a Leica Unit. The mean abundance was calculated using the gill plasmodial index (GPI) by counting the number of plasmodia present per gill visible under the stereo zoom trinocular microscope: 0–0 (no infection); 1–5 (light infection—1); 5–10 (moderate infection—2); 10–20 (heavy infection—3); 20–50 (severe infection—4) (Kaur and Attri ).
The parasite DNA was extracted from alcohol-fixed plasmodium in the gill tissue using Qiagen DNA mini kit. The quantity of DNA was checked in a NanoDrop spectrophotometer and was found to be 179 ng/μL. The 18S rDNA gene was amplified using specific primers, i.e., My1F (CTAATCCCGGTAACGAACGA) My10R (CGTCCTCGCAACAAACTGTA) which were standardized during the present study. The PCR was carried out, according to Andree et al. ( ) at the final volume of 25 μL using the specific primers which amplified the fragments of 833 bp fragments of the 18S rDNA gene. The amplification reactions were conducted with 3 μL DNA, 2.5 μL of 10X Taq buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), 1 μL of Taq polymerase (1 U; Sigma-Aldrich, USA), 3.4 μL of deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates, 0.9 μL of each primer, and 13.3 μL of water. During the process of amplification, initial denaturation was done at 95 °C for 3 min, then at 95 °C for 30 s (33 cycles) followed by annealing of primers at 58 °C for 30 s, extension at 68 °C for 1 min and 20 s followed by final extension of 68 °C for 10 min. The PCR product was run on a 2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide (0.5 μg/mL) in 1× Tris-acetate-EDTA (TAE) buffer. The base pair length was estimated using 100 bp Plus DNA Ladder. The sequencing of the amplified products was commercially done at Molecular Diagnostic & Research Laboratories (MDRL), Chandigarh (India), and the size was 833 base pairs. The edited nucleotide sequences obtained from the myxospores of T . gabori sp. nov. were deposited in GenBank under the accession number KX757025.
The nucleotide sequences obtained were edited and aligned using BioEdit software (Hall ).
The phylogenetic analysis of 18S rDNA sequence (KX757025) was done using BLAST (Altschul et al. ) which included 27 other sequences showing more than 84% sequence similarity. The outgroup Ceratomyxa auerbachi (EU616734) infecting Chone infundibuliformis was taken for analyses. Kimura two-parameter model (Kimura ) in MEGA6 software (Tamura et al. ) was used for genetic distance analyses. Sequence alignment was performed by Multiple Sequence Comparison by Log-Expectation (MUSCLE). The tree was generated using maximum likelihood having 1000 bootstrap values and was proportional to the number of substitutions per site.

Morphological comparison
The present species was compared to myxospores of other morphologically similar Thelohanellus spp. (Table 2 ). While some measurements overlap, there are several characters that aid in distinguishing T . gabori sp. nov. from other myxozoans. The myxospores of the present species were characterized in having pyriform shape with pointed at the anterior end, hence differed from T . wallagoi in having eccentrically placed polar capsule (aligned to one side of the myxospore body cavity). Furthermore, T . gabori differed from T . valeti in having curved and blunt polar capsule and from T . assambai wherein the polar capsule was truncated at the anterior end.

The myxospores of T . bifurcata (34.89 × 9.21 μm), T . jiroveci (35.0 × 13 μm), T . zahrahae (23.8 × 9.0 μm), T . filli (27.08 × 10.56 μm), T . neocyprini (34.0.8 × 9.05 μm), T . caudatus (13.8 × 8.9 μm), and T . habibpuri (13.9 × 8.5 μm) were much longer than the present species (8.56 μm). The present species differed from T . narasimhamurtius and T . endodermitis in which the polar capsule was lanceolate in former and pyriform but situated at the anterior tip in the later. Moreover, the present species lack parietal folds hence different from T . andhrae , T . chrysopomati , and T . potaili in which prominent parietal folds are present.
After the comparison, the present species was considered to be morphologically close to T . dykovae , T . gangeticus , and T . coeli in having pyriform-shaped myxospores. But absence of neck in the polar capsule makes it different from all the three mentioned as a distinct tubular neck was found to be present in them. Also, the LS/WS ratio of the present species was 2.33 as compared to T . dykovae (2.63), T . gangeticus (3.12), and T . coeli (1.79), hence differed from them. The present species was close to T . pathankotensis and T . boggoti in shape and morphology, but differed in LS/WS ratio (2.33 in T . gabori as compared to 1.87 in T . pathankotensis and 1.75 in T . boggoti ).
The comparisons made above have clearly demonstrated the unique morphology and morphometry of T . gabori sp. nov., therefore considered as a new species.
Histopathological analysis
The plasmodia of Thelohanellus gabori sp. nov. were cylindrical whitish pustules, 1.0–1.7 mm in size, located in the gill filament of Crossocheilus latius , consistent with the FE intrafilamental epithelial type described by Molnar ( ). Plasmodia contained approximately 500–700 myxospores and their location within the epithelial lining led to the distortion and loss of approximately 4–5 lamellae for each plasmodia. Histological sections revealed hypertrophy and hyperplasia of epithelial and vascular endothelial cells of the gill filament. Furthermore, the cavity of each plasmodium was filled with numerous fully mature myxospores, and many large-sized plasmodia were fused with each other and covered whole of the intrafilamental space (Fig. 4 ).

Phylogenetic analysis
18S rDNA gene of T. gabori sp. nov.
The 18S specific primer set amplified 833 bp fragments of the 18S rDNA gene from the present sample of Thelohanellus infecting gill filaments of Crossocheilus latius from Ranjit Sagar Wetland, Punjab, India. The edited nucleotide sequences obtained from the myxospores of T . gabori sp. nov. were deposited in GenBank under the accession number KX757025.
The BLAST analysis revealed that T . gabori sp. nov. was closely related to T . pathankotensis (KU516661) and T . boggoti (KU8884967) with 97% similarity infecting the gills and fins of L . dero from India respectively, T . sp. FCO (KR819273; 89% similarity) infecting the operculum and skin of Catla catla from India, T . caudatus (KM252684; 89% similarity) infecting anal fin of L . rohita , and T . habibpuri (KM252681; 88% similarity) infecting pelvic fin of L . rohita from India.
The phylogenetic tree based on the final edited alignment (833 bp) with maximum likelihood showed T . gabori in a separate clade with a bootstrap value of 72 comprising T . sp. FCO, T . habibpuri , M . auratus , and M . carnaticus infecting cyprinids carp from India. It formed sister taxa with T . pathankotensis and T . boggoti with a high bootstrap value of 100. The out-group Ceratomyxa auerbachi (EU616734) infecting intestine of Chone infundibuliformis from Denmark was phylogenetically clustered distinctly as a separate lineage (Fig. 5 ). Fig. 5 Phylogenetic tree reconstructed by maximum likelihood analysis of 18S rDNA showing the phylogenetic position of Thelohanellus gabori sp. nov. (KX757025) with other myxosporeans. GenBank accession numbers, organ, and country names are given, and number above nodes indicated bootstrap confidence values. Ceratomyxa auerbachi was taken as the out-group. Scale bar 0.05 mm
Moreover, estimates of evolutionary pairwise divergence among the sequences of T . pathankotensis , T . boggoti , T . sp. FCO, T . caudatus , M . auratus , T . habibpuri , and T . sp. KLT were 0.03, 0.00, 0.09, 0.10, 0.06, 0.06, and 0.10 respectively. Maximum transition was C → T 24.52 probability value followed by T → C 18.28 , A → G 12.52 , and G → A 11.85 . As for transversions T → G 4.47 , C → G 4.47 , T → A 4.23 , C → A 4.23 , G → T 4.42 , and G → C 3.30 , K2 + G was the best fit substitution model for reconstructing the phylogenetic tree having the lowest Bayesian score of 8633.563 followed by the Gamma distribution among five categories of 0.00, 0.00, 0.08, 0.56, and 4.36 substitutions per site. Tajima’s neutrality test for the nucleotide mutation was also done and D value was 0.058804; it means some of the alleles were present at high frequencies indicating high genetic diversity among myxosporeans.
Discussion
The phylogenetic tree obtained by maximum likelihood formed subclades with high bootstrap values consisting species from India, China, and Hungary. The tree showed species complex between the Thelohanellus species infecting gills of cyprinid carps from India. The phylogenetic tree formed three major clades comprising species from Thelohanellus , Myxobolus , and Henneguya . The present species T . gabori was present in the first clade comprising T . pathankotensis , T . boggoti , T . sp. FCO, T . caudatus , T . habibpuri , M . auratus , and M . carnaticus infecting cyprinid carps from India with a bootstrap value of 72. It formed sister taxa with T . pathankotensis and T . boggoti infecting gills and fins of cyprinid carps with a bootstrap value of 100. It was well supported by the evolutionary divergence values of 0.03 and 0.00 respectively as well as with 97% sequence similarity. The other subclade comprised M . dispar and other thelohanelloids including T . testudineus , T . wuhanensis , T . kitauei , and T . hovorkai with low bootstrap value from China and Hungary. The lower clade comprised species belonging to Myxobolus and Henneguya with a very high bootstrap value indicating a close relationship between them and showing their affinity towards tissue and host tropism. This was in accordance with the previous studies of Fiala ( ) and Gupta and Kaur ( ) which state that the tree depends upon the tissue location, geographical region, and specificity of the host (Kaur and Gupta ; Morsy et al. ; Szekely et al. ). The present phylogenetic analysis further demonstrates that all these species shows the polyphyletic relationship among them.
Molecular and phylogenetic tools allowed us to resolve cryptic species of Thelohanellus sp. and their host specificity in cyprinid carps. These observations were regarded to be in conformity with those of earlier studies, according to whom members of the genus Thelohanellus were characterized by strict tissue specificity in a strictly defined location within the gill apparatus (Molnar ; Gupta and Kaur , , , , ; Kaur and Gupta , ).
Species complexes may arise when closely related populations diverge and develop into newer forms. Hence, newer approaches are needed to reveal the strains, species complexes, and cryptic species within the same geographical locations, host, organ, and tissue location. We demonstrate that tissue tropism along with spore morphology and DNA analyses can be used to resolve cryptic myxozoan species.
During the present study, histological sections revealed hypertrophy and hyperplasia of epithelial and vascular endothelial cells of the gill filament. Similar type of infection was reported by Yuan et al. ( ) in gibel carp where the basal parts of the plasmodia were extended to the terminal end of the filaments leading to epithelial hyperplasia. It was also found that large plasmodia were formed by fusion of several neighbor extended plasmodia. Abdel-Baki et al. ( ) further studied the infection of Henneguya ghaffari as intrafilamental which caused epithelial hyperplasia and curling and atrophy of the respiratory lamellae causing deleterious effect on the host by decreasing the functional respiratory surface of the gills.
Application of new approaches such as different gene markers, myxozoan life cycle, host factors, and SSU sequences will not only facilitate classification but also design new diagnostics for myxozoan pathology.
