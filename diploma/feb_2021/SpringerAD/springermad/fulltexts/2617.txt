A survey on impacts of Humulus lupulus L. extract on blood factors in male rats
Humulus lupulus L. is a herbaceous climbing plant from cannabinaceac family cultivated in Iran as well as most regions all over the world (Milligan et al. ). Hops of this plant have long been used as preservative and flavoring agent in brewing industry (Milligan et al. ). Previous studies have suggested the plant hops to have powerful stimulating estrogenic trait (Milligan et al. ). In the course of the present survey, menstrual disturbances were also reported among female workers who were used to picking up the plant hops manually (Colborn et al. ; Milligan et al. ; Handelsman et al. ). Moreover, hop baths have been used in treatment of gynecological disorders (Milligan et al. ), and extracts of the plant have long been applied in reducing hot flushes in menopausal women (Colborn et al. ; Milligan et al. ; Bowe et al. ).
Previous studies were indicators of the point that treatment with estradiol reduces Hb, PCV, and total RBCs (Attia and Zayed ). Data extracted from one study showed decrease in RBC and hematocrit levels, though increased MCH and MCHC counts in (oral contraceptive agent) OCA users was observed (Frassinelli-Gunderson et al. ), while another study proved that androgen administration significantly induces higher Hb and Hct levels in human plasma (T'Sjoen et al. ). Additionally, some researchers have managed to know that 5β-H steroid metabolites, C18, C19, and C21 steroids can stimulate erythropoiesis via erythropoietin and ESF (erythropoiesis stimulating factor) production or through elevating the number of elytroid colonies (Gordon et al. ; Singer and Adamson ). Furthermore, Vanhees et al. ( ) demonstrated that prenatal exposure to genistein exerts erythropoiesis via gene expression and DNA methylation of hematopoietic cells, as well (Vanhees et al. ). In spite of the abovementioned studies, scientists have reported extreme use of lignin complex not to have adverse effects on human hematopoietic system (Prasad ).
On serum levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), some scientists have proved them to be reduced by oral estradiol (Rimoldi et al. ). Similarly, serum levels of testosterone are decreased by phytoestrogen (Weber et al. ), and β-estradiol may have the same effect (T'Sjoen et al. ). Moreover, some studies have proved that exposure to β-estradiol can reduce hemoglobin counts, as well as reduction in number of hematocrit and erythropoietic (Gonzales et al. ; T'Sjoen et al. ).
As to the curing effects of steroids, different investigations have indicated that phytoestrogens are useful in side-effect-free treatment of a great variety of anemiae, some of which prevalent in synthetic estrogens like uterus cancer or macrocytosis (Scott and Weir ; Colborn et al. ).
To the best of our knowledge, effects of Humulus lupulus L. hops (containing phytoestrogen) on blood picture have not yet been investigated. Therefore, the present study aimed at examining effects of hydroalcoholic extract of the plant hops on blood picture in male rats.
Methods
Statements on ethical approval
Protocols of the present study were approved by the due university ethics committee, and the study was conducted according to the University’s Principles for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
Preparation of Humulus lupulus. L extract
Hops of Humulus lupulus L. were obtained from Zarband Pharmacy Firm (Khakpoor et al. ). Then, collected hops were ground to powder, and hydroalcoholic extract was prepared through percolation method (Khakpoor et al. ; Sharp et al. ).
Seventy male Sprague-Dawley rats (22-day-old) were obtained from Animal Breeding Center (treated with 12 h light/12 h dark), and the investigation was performed in temperature (25 ± 1 °C) conditions with free-choice standard rat chow and tap water.
Experimental design
Rats were randomly assigned to seven groups ( n = 10 each). The first group was time control rats receiving no treatment. The second and third groups were control rats receiving 25% tween (as the hydroalcholic extract solvent) 80° solution (1 ml/kg/day) and olive oil (as the DES solvent, 1 ml/kg/day) for 7 weeks. The fourth, fifth, and sixth groups received hydroalcoholic extract of Humulus lupulus L. (H) at 50, 150, or 450 mg/kg/day, respectively. The seventh group received DES (100 μg/Kg BW) (Ohmori et al. ; Khakpoor et al. ; Raji et al. ). Time lapse of the protocol under the study was 7 weeks.
Experimental protocol
The animals’ weights were recorded and assigned as time control. Moreover, all the samples received daily administrations of vehicles, extracts, as well as oral Di ethyl stilbestrol for 7 weeks. Animals were weighted on a weekly basis, and the doses of treatments were adjusted accordingly. By the end of the seventh week, animals were anesthetized with ether and blood samples (5 ml) which were collected through cardiac puncture.
Laboratory assays
Blood samples were used to determine complete blood counts. Hematocrit levels (Hct) were determined by micro method through non-heparinized capillaries immediately after blood sample collection (13,000 rpm, 5 min, Haematokrit, HETTICH, model 20 H). Whole blood cellular analysis was performed besides EDTA analysis, and then the following measures were carried out: red blood cell count, hemoglobin concentration (Hb), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), and white blood count. In performing the present investigation, an “S” Model Coulter Counter was applied in Student Health Service Laboratory. Hematopoietic parameters were measured by the following formula.
Statistics
The data, presented as mean ± SEM, was analyzed through a one-way analysis of variance method. In cases of significant differences with these tests, comparisons were performed by LSD Post Hoc Test. P ≤ 0.05 were considered statistically as the significant.

There was no significant difference between the groups in WBC and RBC.
Discussion
It has recently been identified that 8-phenylninargenin is considered as potent phytoestrogen in Humulus lupulus L. (hop) plant, and it is reported that hop extracts can reduce hot flushes in postmenopausal women (Milligan et al. ).
In the present study, the researcher aimed at finding out possible mechanisms of 8-phenylninargenin’s action as a kind of phytoestrogen in hop on erythropoiesis activity.
Our study indicated significant decrease in body weight of animals treated by DES and phyto diet comparing to that of the control group. Additionally, at the end of the exposure period, it was proved that animals’ weight significantly changed by age at the end of the exposures, which is an indicator of normal growth during the experiment.
It has been shown that 8-prenylninargenin like other phytoesrogens had strong affinity to estrogen receptor- β (ER-β) as well as ER-α (2), mediating the typical effects of E 2 in the uterus, vagina, and mammary gland (Colborn et al. ; Rimoldi et al. ).
There is evidence that testosterone is able to increase erythropoietin (Gonzales et al. ); whereas, it may reduce estradiol level (Mukundan et al. ). Moreover, it is reported that phyto-fed animals had significantly lower plasma androgen levels comparing to that of the phyto-free animals (Weber et al. ). Another study showed that volume of absorbed iron, MCH, MCHC, and serum ferritin was higher, but RBC and hematocrit levels were lower for the oral contraceptive agents (OCA) users (Frassinelli-Gunderson et al. ). According to other researches performed in 2005, administration of oral ethinyloestradiol (EE) can significantly reduce testosterone, hemoglobin (Hb), RBC and hematocrite (Hct), and sTfR (as a marker of marrow erythrepoietic activity) levels in relation with the levels of IGF-1 and of sTfR (T'Sjoen et al. ). On the other hand, banzoat oesteradiol suppressed the bone marrow hematopoiesis in mice, but E 2 increased the erythroid precursors in the spleen (Nakada et al. ; Gear and Belcher ). Besides, other studies have shown that 17-βestradiol induces hematopoietic stem cell proliferation via increasing macrophage-granulocyte colonies in cultured mesenchymal stem cells in Sprague rats (in vitro) (Qiu et al. ).
Previous studies reported that OCA (oral contraceptive agents) users had significantly lower RBC and Hct levels, and no significant differences were observed for Hb, WBC, and MCV levels. MCH and MCHC parameters were higher for the OCA users (Frassinelli-Gunderson et al. ). Contrary to previous findings, our observation showed a significant increase of Hct, Hb, MCV, and MCH in sample animals (H450); however, in agreement with the previous findings, Hb and MCHC and MCV decreased significantly with DES. Possible interpretation of this observation could be the point that differences in plasma testosterone may trigger sex and species differences in values of hematopoietic indices. Such differences might also occur due to increasing effects of estrogen on IGF-1 production which mediates erythropoietic activity of testosterone. Reduction of MCHC could possibly be explained in relation with Hb. MCHC is an index of average hemoglobin content in the mass of circulating RBCs. Low MCHC values are indicators of deficiency in hemoglobin synthesis; therefore, the researcher came to the conclusion that DES induces decrease in MCHC by lacking Hb synthesis. Our study also proved that phytoestrogens and synthetic derivatives of esteroids play different roles. For example, chronic use of lignin complex had no adverse effects on the hemopoietic system (Prasad ). Nevertheless, same with treatment with phytoestrogens like genistein and biochainin A (BA), treatment with Daidzein (a kind of phytoestrogen) can also restore the damage in bone growth, induce maturation, repair morphological changes in growth plate, and recover adipogenesis. Carboxy-derivative of BA had almost no effect on bones in ovarectomized rats (Somjen et al. ). Supporting this idea, another study showed that structural differences had dramatic effects on the erythropoietic activity of different steroid compounds. For example, while testosterone and its 5α-H derivatives had little or no activity, many synthetic derivatives of testosterone were highly active in increasing erythroid colony growth. Moreover, certain C18, C19, C20 steroids of varying configurations significantly increased the number of erythroid colonies through production of erythropoietin or by directly stimulating hemoglobin and porphyrin-heme, as well as enhancing heme production by inducing formation of δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) synthetase activity in bone marrow cells synthesis (Gordon et al. ; Singer and Adamson ; Ohmori et al. ). Additionally, all 5β-H androstanes and estranges and one 5β-H pregnane were active, but estradiol had no effect (Singer and Adamson ). The extracted data implies a high degree of specificity of receptor sites and interaction between DES, besides extract and responsive cells in the bone marrow. Discrepancies between DES and phytoestrogen effects may be due to the difference in composition of phytoestrogens applied in treating the sample animals; Moreover, such differences could have more potent additive or suppressive effects on erythropoiesis. In conclusion, our study proved that contrary to that of the DES, higher doses of phytoestrogen can stimulate erythroid colonies.
