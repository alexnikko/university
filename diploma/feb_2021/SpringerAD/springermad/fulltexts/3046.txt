Introduction
Uterine carcinosarcoma (UCS), also known as a malignant mixed Müllerian tumor (MMMT) or malignant mixed mesodermal tumor, is a relatively rare neoplasm of the uterus. These tumors are composed of both epithelial and mesenchymal elements [ ]. The incidence is estimated to be <2/100,000 women each year [ ]. These are highly aggressive tumors and have poor survival rates. Although UCS accounts for <5% of all uterine malignancies, it is responsible for 15% of all deaths from uterine malignancies [ ]. Approximately half of them re-present at advanced stages [ ]. Patients with advanced stage UCS account for more than half of uterine cancer-related deaths.
The primary surgical treatment consists of total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, systematic lymphadenectomy, omentectomy and resection of all gross disease. Following surgery, adjuvant therapy should be considered for all stages of UCS. There are contradictory results with regard to the factors associated with survival. In addition to complete staging, the therapeutic effect of lymphadenectomy is suggested by several authors [ , , ]. Contrary to this, lymphadenectomy as part of the primary surgery was not found to affect outcome in a Swedish survival study [ ]. In advanced-stage UCS, cytoreductive surgery for no gross residual tumor is associated with improved overall survival (OS) [ , , ]. Despite these few studies regarding prognosis, the predictors of survival for UCS patients have not been determined clearly yet. Previously, several parameters such as stage, grade of epithelial component, performance status, CA-125 level, lymphovascular space invasion, myometrial invasion, pelvic lymphadenectomy, residual tumor, and adjuvant therapy were suggested to be associated with survival [ , , , , , , , ]. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible predictors of disease-free survival (DFS) and OS for UCS patients.
Materials and methods
In the present single-center retrospective cohort study, the data of all women with UCS who were treated surgically at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Ankara University School of Medicine from January 2008 to December 2014 were reviewed. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Ankara University School of Medicine (IRB Approval #5365, September 2014). Patients with other uterine malignancies were excluded.
Data were extracted from hospital records including demographic, surgical, pathologic, and outcome information. Age at diagnosis, grade, stage, myometrial invasion, lymphovascular space invasion, lymph node metastasis, residual tumor size, lymphadenectomy, adjuvant therapies, and recurrence status were the parameters recorded. Grading was performed according to the histologic type and the grade of the epithelial component. Grade 1 endometrioid type was accepted as grade 1; grade 2 endometrioid type was accepted as grade 2; and grade 3 endometrioid type and serous, clear cell, undifferentiated or mixed types were accepted as grade 3. Optimal cytoreductive surgery was defined as maximum residual tumor <1 cm. DFS was defined as the interval from the time of primary surgery to the recurrence if present or to the date of last follow-up. OS was defined as the interval from the time of primary surgery to the date of death or last follow-up.
Statistical analysis
The Kaplan–Meier method was used to calculate DFS and OS. The Cox regression model was used to determine the impact of selected factors on survival. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed for DFS and OS, and stepwise variable selection was performed for further analysis of prognostic factors ( = 0.05).
Results
A total of 88 UCS patients with a median age of 64.5 years (range 31−83) were included in the study. Forty-seven (53.4%) patients were diagnosed with stage III disease and seven (7.9%) with stage IV disease. The median follow-up time was 16 months. Among all patients, 60 (68.1%) underwent lymphadenectomy. Optimal cytoreductive surgery was achieved in 67 (76.1%) patients. Among the patients included, 40/83 (48.1%) received chemotherapy. A combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel was administered to 34 (85%) patients and ifosfamide was administered to 6 (15%) patients. The characteristics of the study population are summarized in Table 1 .

According to univariate Cox regression analysis including all patients, the presence of residual tumor, myometrial invasion ≥50%, lymphovascular space invasion, lymph node metastasis, recurrence and adjuvant chemotherapy had a significant impact on DFS and OS (Table 2 ). Stepwise variable selection Cox regression analysis showed that lymph node metastasis (LNM) was associated with poor DFS (hazard ratio 6.524; 95% CI 2.625–16.211; P < 0.001) and OS (hazard ratio 6.993; 95% CI 2.631–18.587; P < 0.001) (Table 2 ). The mean DFS was 84.5 ± 11.2 months (95% CI 62.5–106.5) for patients without LNM and 9.8 ± 1.9 months (95% CI 6.0–13.6) for patients with LNM ( P < 0.001) (Fig. 1 ). The mean OS was 87.5 ± 10.2 months (95% CI 67.5–107.7) for patients without LNM and 17.1 ± 2.7 months (95% CI 11.8–22.4) for patients with LNM ( P < 0.001) (Fig. 2 ).

In a further sub-group analysis, the prognostic factors were evaluated in patients with both early ( n = 34; 38.7%) and advanced-stage ( n = 54; 61.3%) diseases. According to univariate Cox regression analysis, none of the prognostic factors had a significant impact on DFS and OS in patients with early stage disease (Table 3 ). In addition, tumor grade had a significant impact on DFS in patients with advanced-stage disease (Table 4 ). However, multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed no significant impact of risk factors on survival in either group.

Discussion
UCS is a relatively rare tumor of the uterine body with an extremely unfavorable prognosis when compared to other types of uterine tumors. The 5-year OS rate was reported to be 30% and the recurrence-free survival rate was 27% [ ]. Despite progression in cancer screening and therapies over the past few decades, less progress has been made regarding UCS. The best treatment protocol for UCS is still lacking and the prognostic factors are not well known yet. The present single-center retrospective cohort study was conducted to assess the prognostic factors affecting survival of patients with UCS. The results revealed that LNM is significantly associated with DFS and OS and is the single most important prognostic factor.
Gross total resection of tumors should be the goal of primary cytoreductive surgery in patients with UCS. A multicenter study of 486 women with stage I–IV UCS found residual tumor size >1 cm to be associated with shorter OS [ ]. Furthermore, pelvic lymphadenectomy was found to be associated with improved DFS and OS [ ]. In a subgroup analysis of the same cohort, the authors evaluated the results of women diagnosed with stage III–IV UCS ( n = 225) and reported that optimal cytoreductive surgery and lymphadenectomy were associated with improved progression-free survival (PFS) and OS in patients with advanced disease [ ]. Similarly, Alagkiozidis et al. reported improved OS in advanced-stage UCS patients ( n = 168) with cytoreductive surgery [ ]. Improved OS with complete gross resection of advanced stage disease was also suggested in several previous studies [ , ]. Tanner et al. reported results of 44 patients with stage IIIC–IVB UCS and found that median OS was significantly longer in patients who received gross total resection [ ]. In a previous Gyncologic Oncology Group (GOG) study, the prognostic factors in early stage uterine sarcomas were evaluated in 301 patients with UCS [ ]. Among patients who were clinically suspected to have stage I−II diseases, 13.5% were upstaged after surgery. They found that adnexal spread, LNM, histologic cell type and grade were independent prognostic factors. Nemani et al. reported that 14% of patients with UCS had LNM [ ]. The median OS was 54 months when lymphadenectomy was performed and 25 months when lymphadenectomy was not performed.
On the contrary, one of the largest survival studies on UCS could not find an association between lymphadenectomy and outcome [ ]. Sorbe et al. reported results of 322 UCS patients who were followed up for at least 10 years; approximately 40% of the patients were stage III–IV. According to their results, the extent of surgery was not associated with tumor recurrence and radiotherapy was suggested to be the most important part of the treatment [ ]. Similar to their results, the present study could not find a statistically significant effect of optimal cytoreductive surgery or lympadenectomy on DFS and OS after multivariate analysis. The small sample size due to analysis of patients from a single center might be one reason for this result. Also, the low number of patients without optimal cytoreductive surgery ( n = 21) might be the reason for the insignificant results regarding DFS and OS. On the other hand, our results revealed that LNM was the most important prognostic factor for both DFS and OS.
The inverse relationship between myometrial invasion and OS has been reported in previous studies [ , ]. In the largest study evaluating prognostic factors in all stages of UCS, myometrial invasion ≥50% was associated with poor OS [ ]. However, the authors failed to show a significant association between myometrial invasion and DFS. When the advanced-stage UCS patients of the same cohort were evaluated separately, myometrial invasion was not associated with PFS and OS [ ]. Harano et al. reported a statistically significant effect of lymphovascular invasion on DFS but not on OS of UCS patients [ ]. However, in advanced-stage disease they could not find a significant impact of lymphovascular space invasion on survival [ ]. Park et al. reported that lymphovascular space invasion or LNM had significantly poorer DFS and OS [ ]. Although we found significant effects of myometrial invasion and lymphovascular space invasion on survival in univariate analysis, multivariate analysis revealed no impact of myometrial invasion or lymphovascular space invasion on survival in either early or advanced-stage diseases.
None of the aforementioned studies with a large number of subjects found a significant impact of adjuvant chemotherapy on DFS or OS [ , , ]. However, a recent multicenter study found adjuvant chemotherapy to be effective in controlling both local and distant recurrences in stage I UCS [ ]. We failed to show a positive impact of adjuvant chemotherapy on survival. The combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel has been shown to be effective in adjuvant and metastatic UCS [ , , ]. Toxicity associated with ifosfamide was the main reason for the low usage rate in our clinic.
The effect of adjuvant radiotherapy on survival in UCS remains controversial. Previously, Callister et al. investigated the effect of radiotherapy on the survival of 300 patients with MMMTs [ ]. The authors concluded that adjuvant pelvic radiotherapy decreased the risk of pelvic recurrence and may delay the appearance of distant metastases after hysterectomy. Postoperative radiotherapy was found to be most effective in the early stages. However, the survival rates remained poor because of high distant recurrence rates. Matsuo et al. reported that adding radiotherapy to chemotherapy might be effective in controlling local recurrence when the tumor exhibits multiple risk factors [ ]. The GOG 150 study and a phase III randomized trial by Reed et al. also did not find improved OS with radiotherapy [ , ]. Recently, Zwahlen et al. analyzed the data from 124 UCS patients and found a reduced relative risk for local relapse [ ]. In addition, their multivariate analysis revealed that external beam radiation therapy >50 Gy was an independent prognostic factor for better OS. Within our study population, 32/83 (38.6%) received radiotherapy. However, we again failed to show a beneficial effect of radiotherapy on survival.
There are several limitations to the present study. First, it was a retrospective study in a single center and the number of subjects was limited. The non-significant results regarding the effects of optimal cytoreductive surgery, lymphadenectomy, and adjuvant therapies may be due to the small size. Second, some parameters such as patient status, tumor markers, histologic subtype of the epithelial component, and perioperative morbidity were not available for most patients and could not evaluated. Third, the extent of surgery such as omentectomy, and para-aortic lymphadenectomy differed between the primary surgeons. Fourth, as there is still no consensus on the best adjuvant treatment for UCS, the adjuvant therapies were not unified in our study population. Despite the small sample size, the patients received different adjuvant therapies in a relatively short period according to the primary physician’s choice and this situation might affect the results regarding adjuvant therapies. However, the systematic exploration of the present parameters and the multivariate approach may add credence to our observations and the present data can be used in future meta-analysis.
In conclusion, LNM is the most significant prognostic factor associated with poor DFS and OS in UCS patients. Although previous studies in the literature predominantly reported better survival with total gross resection of the tumor for no residual disease and lymphadenectomy, the results obtained from our study reveal that none of these efforts prolong the survival of patients with UCS. However, future meta-analysis would help us to better understand the actual prognostic factors affecting survival and to find the best management strategy.
