Introduction
The CHA 2 DS 2 –VASc (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 years, diabetes mellitus, previous stroke or transient ischemic attack, vascular disease, age 65–74 years, sex category) score is a well-validated and clinically useful tool to assess the thromboembolic risk in patients with atrial fibrillation [ ]. Previous studies reported that CHA 2 DS 2 –VASc score is able to predict outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation and acute stroke [ , , ]. These data were recently confirmed by a large prospective multicenter study including 1029 consecutive patients from several stroke units throughout Europe and Asia [ ]. In addition, pre-stroke CHA 2 DS 2– VASc score predicted short- and long-term outcomes also in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) without atrial fibrillation [ , , ].
To date, only Cappellari et al. examined the response to intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) after stroke using the CHA 2 DS 2 –VASc score as predictive tool. In particular, the authors observed that low-risk level (CHA 2 DS 2 –VASc score = 0) was a predictor of effective response to IVT, whereas very high-risk level (CHA 2 DS 2 –VASc score ≥ 3) was a predictor of failed response within 3 months after stroke [ ]. However, this study was limited by its retrospective design. In addition, it is unknown if CHA 2 DS 2 –VASc score is useful for predicting the long-term outcome in ischemic stroke patients treated with IVT.
Our aim was to investigate if the pre-stroke CHA 2 DS 2 –VASc score is able to predict short- and long-term outcomes in AIS patients underwent IVT.
Methods
Patients
From January 2015 to March 2017 all consecutive patients admitted to the Udine University Hospital with AIS and underwent IVT were enrolled in this study. In accordance with the indication and contraindications of international guidelines, we treated patients showing symptoms onset within 4.5 h with alteplase at dosage of 0.9 mg/kg over 1 h [ , ].
The study was performed according to the guidelines of the local ethics committee. Informed consent was obtained from the patients or their representatives.
Data collection
Demographic data, vascular risk factors, laboratory findings, blood pressure, and pharmacological treatment at admission were collected. Vascular risk factors were defined as follows: (1) hypertension: use of antihypertensive agents or systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg; (2) diabetes mellitus: fasting glucose level ≥ 126 mg/dL preprandial or glucose level ≥ 200 mg/dL postprandial or HbA1c ≥ 6.5% or use of oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin; (3) hyperlipidemia: use of antihyperlipidemic agents; (4) current smoking of any degree; (5) ischemic heart disease: history of acute myocardial infarction or angina pectoris or coronary revascularization by either coronary artery bypass graft or percutaneous coronary intervention; (6) congestive heart failure: previously diagnosed by a clinician; (7) peripheral artery disease: previously diagnosed by a clinician or intermittent claudication of presumed atherosclerotic origin or history of intermittent claudication with previous leg amputation, reconstructive surgery or angioplasty; (8) atrial fibrillation: history of atrial fibrillation. Information on previous TIA or stroke was collected. The TOAST classification was used to determine AIS subtypes based on their etiology [ ]. Stroke severity was determined with the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) at admission and at discharge. Presence of ICH was detected. ICH was defined as any parenchymal hematoma based on the European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study (ECASS) morphologic definitions (ECASS PH-1 or PH-2) [ ]. Functional outcome was assessed by means of the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at admission based on pre-stroke disability, at discharge and 90-days after stroke. Moreover, we collected data on functional outcome and mortality 1-year after stroke in 165 patients (65%). The mRS score after discharge was recorded at the patients’ routine clinical visit or through telephone interview with patients or their immediate caregivers. The mRS score was dichotomized into a favorable outcome (0–2) and poor outcome (3–6).
The pre-stroke CHA 2 DS 2 –VASc score for each patient was calculated from the collected baseline data. Patients were classified into three groups according to their pre-stroke CHA 2 DS 2 –VASc score: a score of 0 of 1, a score of 2 or 3 and a score above 3.
Outcome measures
The primary efficacy endpoints were: rate of favorable outcome at 90-days and at 1-year. The primary safety endpoints were: mortality at 90-days and at 1-year. The secondary endpoints were: NIHSS score at discharge, rate of favorable outcome at discharge and presence of ICH. All the measures of outcome were prospectively collected.
Statistical analysis
Differences between the three groups were assessed by means of the Chi square test (Fisher’s exact test) for categorical variables, and one-way analysis of variance and the Mann–Whitney U test for continuous and ordinal variables, respectively. Binary logistic regression modeling was used to test the association of the pre-stroke CHA 2 DS 2 –VASc with primary outcome measures adjusting for the other variables with a probability value < 0.10 in univariate analysis and not included in the CHADS 2– VASc score. The utility of the pre-stroke CHA 2 DS 2 –VASc in estimating favorable outcome at 90-days and at 1 year, and mortality at 90-days and at 1-year was tested with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC).
Data are displayed in tables as means and standard deviations (SD), if not otherwise specified. All probability values are two-tailed. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis was carried out using the SPSS 22 software.
Results
The 256 patients included in our study had a mean age of 72.1 ± 13.4 years and consisted of 56.3% males. A CHA 2 DS 2 –VASc score 0–1 was found in 68 (26.6%) patients, 94 (36.7%) patients had a CHA 2 DS 2 –VASc score of 2–3, 94 (36.7%) had a score > 3.
Table 1 compares the baseline characteristics of patients according to their CHA 2 DS 2 –VASc score. As expected, patients with higher CHA 2 DS 2 –VASc scores were older and more frequently females. Rate of most coexisting vascular risk factors and cardiovascular conditions at baseline increased with a higher CHA 2 DS 2 –VASc score. Thus, patients with higher CHA 2 DS 2 –VASc scores were more likely to take antithrombotic drugs (Table 1 ). Not surprisingly, the severity of stroke at admission increased with higher CHA 2 DS 2 –VASc scores (Table 1 ). Based on TOAST classification, AIS due to other determined etiology was more common in the CHA 2 DS 2 –VASc score 0–1 group, while prevalence of cardioembolic stroke was higher in the other two groups (Table 1 ).

The primary efficacy and safety endpoints according to the CHA 2 DS 2 –VASc score are reported in Figs. 1 and 2 , respectively. At discharge, patients with CHA 2 DS 2 –VASc score 0–1 showed significantly lower NIHSS scores [median (IQR), 0–1: 0 (0–2.75) vs. 2–3: (0–4) vs. > 3: 2 (0-9.75), p = 0.05] and higher rate of favorable outcome (0–1: 72.1% vs. 2–3: 53.2% vs. > 3: 35.1%, p < 0.001) than subjects in the other two groups. Whereas patients in CHA 2 DS 2 –VASc 0–1 group did not suffer from any ICH after IVT, hemorrhagic complications occurred in patients with higher CHA 2 DS 2 –VASc scores (2–3:4.3%; > 3:4.3%, p = 0.2). Table 2 shows significant predictors of primary efficacy and safety endpoints among variables not included in the CHA 2 DS 2 –VASc score by univariate analyses.

Multivariable analyses for primary endpoints are shown in Table 3 . Using the group with CHA 2 DS 2 –VASc score 0–1 as the reference category, adjusted odds ratios for favorable outcome at 90-days and at 1-year decreased with higher CHA 2 DS 2 –VASc scores, whereas adjusted odds ratios increased with higher CHA 2 DS 2 –VASc scores when mortality at 90-days and at 1-year were used as dependent variables (Table 3 ).

Discussion
In recent years the treatment of AIS changed dramatically with the introduction of IVT for early cerebral reperfusion. Several scoring tools have been developed in order to predict clinical response after IVT in AIS. All these clinical scores require baseline NIHSS score and, in several cases, also radiological information for their calculation [ , , , ]. Thus, they are rarely used in routine clinical practice mainly due to their complexity. A more practical scoring tool for prediction of outcome in AIS patients treated with IVT would be useful in order to estimate the prognosis as soon as possible, in particular in non-neurologist physicians. Moreover, it would help for early identification of patients who have a very high likelihood for a poor outcome despite the fact that they are treated with IVT. The CHA 2 DS 2 –VASc score seems to possess these features. In fact, this tool is based only on demographic and clinical data and it does not require imaging modalities neither neurological assessment.
The CHA 2 DS 2 –VASc score has been recommended for the assessment of thromboembolic risk and guiding antithrombotic therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation [ ]. However, the CHAD 2 S 2 –VASc score can be considered also a useful tool to assess the risk of adverse events in patients with cardiovascular events. Recently, Rozenbaum et al. investigated a very large sample of patients with acute coronary syndrome. The authors observed that a higher CHA 2 DS 2 –VASc score was associated with a significant increase in 1-year mortality [ ]. Similar findings were reported in smaller studies on patients with acute coronary syndrome [ , , ]. Moreover, CHA 2 DS 2 –VASc score may predict first cardiovascular hospitalization in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter [ ] and major clinical events in heart failure patients candidates to cardiac resynchronization therapy [ ]. The individual components comprised in the CHA 2 DS 2 –VASc score have been associated with increased risk of stroke, and also with poor outcome after cerebrovascular event. Heart failure was shown to be associated with worse outcome in AIS patients [ ]. Hypertension is one of the significant predictors of recurrent stroke and cardiovascular event in patients with ischemic stroke [ ]. Previous stroke was shown to be associated with mortality in AIS patients [ , , , ]. Subjects with AIS had more frequently an unfavorable outcome if they were affected by diabetes [ , , ]. Thus, it is not surprising that our patients affected by AIS with higher pre-stroke CHA 2 DS 2 –VASc scores had worse outcomes after IVT. Prevalence of favorable outcome, as measured by mRS, decreased progressively across the three CHA 2 DS 2 –VASc score groups and three-quarter of patients with a CHA 2 DS 2 –VASc score above 3 was disabled in daily activities 1-year after AIS. After adjusting for several possible confounders, such as NIHSS at admission, and pre-stroke mRS, the CHA 2 DS 2 –VASc score confirmed to be an independent predictor of favorable outcome at 90-days and at 1-year after stroke in patients underwent IVT. In particular, this scoring tool seems to be very useful to predict long-term independence or disability in these patients (see the AUC-ROC analyses). However, in our sample the CHA 2 DS 2 –VASc score was also able to predict short-term response to IVT. In fact, stroke severity and its neurological disabilities were significantly less common in patients with a score of 0–1 than in those with CHA 2 DS 2 –VASc score 2–3 or > 3, already at discharge. Regarding safety endpoints, the CHA 2 DS 2 –VASc score showed an acceptable performance to predict short- and long-term mortality in AIS patients after IVT. In particular, mortality rate was very low in patients with CHA 2 DS 2 –VASc score 0–1, whereas the presence of one additional risk factor decreased significantly the percentage of stroke survivors. Based on our results, patients with CHA 2 DS 2 –VASc score 2–3 or > 3 would be at least four times more likely to die during the follow-up period compared to patients with a score of 0 or 1. Thus, patients with a CHA 2 DS 2 –VASc score > 1 had an insufficient response to IVT with alteplase. Other revascularization treatments in AIS might improve the clinical response in patients with high-risk level. New medical therapies with other thrombolytic agents or with adjuvant sonothrombolysis might be promising in this specific population.
To date, only a retrospective study investigated the possible role of pre-stroke CHA 2 DS 2 –VASc score as predictor of clinical response after IVT. Cappellari et al. evaluated short-term outcomes in 512 consecutive patients. The authors observed that a major neurological improvement at 24 h and an excellent functional outcome at 3 month were less common in patients with intermediate-risk level (CHA 2 DS 2 –VASc score = 1), moderately high-risk level (CHA 2 DS 2 –VASc score = 2) and very high-risk level (CHA 2 DS 2 –VASc score ≥ 3) compared with subjects with low-risk level (CHA 2 DS 2 –VASc score = 0). Failure measures (neurological deterioration or no improvement at 24 h and unfavorable functional outcome at 3 month) were more common in patients with very high-risk level compared with low-risk level [ ]. Although we did not distinguished between patients with a CHA 2 DS 2 –VASc score of 0 and 1, our results were perfectly in line with those of Cappellari et al. In addition, we extended the clinical observation up to 1 year after stroke in a large part of our sample.
Limitations of our study are because of the small sample size and derived from a single-center experience. Strengths are the longer follow-up with respect to the previous study and the prospective data acquisition.
Conclusions
This study demonstrated that pre-stroke CHA 2 DS 2 –VASc score represents a good predictor for short- and long-term outcomes in AIS patients treated with IVT. Based on our results, a large part of AIS patients with a pre-stroke CHA 2 DS 2 –VASc score of 0 or 1 will be functionally independent after 90-days and 1-year, whereas, despite IVT treatment, several patients with higher scores, in particular above 3, will be disabled or died during the same period of time. Further studies with a larger population are needed to confirm our findings.
