INTRODUCTION
Vitamin D 3 deficiency has been a worldwide public health issue since 1932 [ , ]. This hypovitaminosis is mostly caused by a poor dietary of vitamin D 3 and a decreased exposure to solar radiation [ ]. The first cause is justified since there are few food sources containing naturally vitamin D 3 , e.g. , cod liver oil, salmon, mackerel, sardines, tuna, and eggs. There are also some fortified foods with this vitamin, e.g. , milk, orange juice, yogurt, and cereals, but in some cases, the additional supplementation is still required [ ]. The second cause is because the synthesis of vitamin D 3 in the skin by UVB radiation is impaired by high latitude, skin pigmentation (melanin), clothes that cover the body (cultural habit), lifestyle indoors, and an excessive use of sunscreens; [ ]. Vitamin D 3 has important functions in the whole body. It is the major regulator of calcium homeostasis that is important for normal mineralization of bone and also acts at immune response modulation, muscle development, insulin secretion, and antithrombotic effects and decreases the cardiovascular risk. Besides, it is associated with decreased risk of cancer due to the regulation of cell cycle and inhibition of cell proliferation [ ].
Therefore, we should pay attention to this global tendency and prevent the vitamin D 3 deficiency with supplementation in foods, oral or transdermal way. Oral supplementation and fortified foods with vitamin D 3 are well established [ ]. However, the transdermal route has little use, and there is a few scientific literatures on the subject. This alternative route of permeation of vitamin D 3 may be interesting for people with fat malabsorption in the intestine, due to Crohn’s disease, gastric bypass, bile acid-binding medications, cystic fibrosis, and celiac disease [ , ].
In 2014, the transdermal route of vitamin D 3 was studied by Sadat-Ali et al. [ ] in a randomized control study made with 50 female medical students’ volunteers from Saudi Arabia. One group applied a topical formulation with aloe vera and vitamin D 3 , and another group applied formulation without vitamin D 3 . Serum levels before and after 3 months were evaluated. The results showed an increase in vitamin D 3 serum levels when compared to control group. Aromatic oils and glycerin were used as penetration enhancers. This route was safe, effective, and should be explored [ ]. At 2015, Alsaqr et al. [ ] investigated the capacity of vitamin D 3 transdermal delivery in porcine skin. The combination of chemical penetration enhancers (dodecylamine and ethanol) improved the permeation in the pre-treated porcine skin with 50% ethanol when compared with control. Then, the transdermal route could be effective [ ]. But, in 2017, Ramezanli et al. [ ] verified skin delivery of polymeric nanospheres with vitamin D 3 through human cadaver skin. The results did not justify transdermal route and suggested the topical use of polymeric nanospheres with vitamin D 3 .
A combination of chemical penetration enhancers was used to improve the permeation through the skin [ ]. The categories used were phospholipid (soybean lecithin), fatty acid ester (isopropyl palmitate), glycols (propylene glycol, ethoxydiglycol), and alcohol (cereal alcohol) [ ]. These categories have a different mechanism of action. Phospholipids can occlude the skin and consequently increase the hydration that could promote permeation [ ]. Fatty acid ester interacts with intercellular lipid from the stratum corneum that is a process named fluidization [ , ]. Glycols and alcohol have similar effect that can increase the solubility of active in the vehicle or skin and extract the lipids from the stratum corneum [ , ].
In this paper, we investigated the feasibleness of vitamin D 3 added into pharmaceutical forms (gel and cream) with some chemical penetration enhancers through human skin by an ex vivo skin retention and permeation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
Formulation materials were vitamin D 3 (Fagron, São Paulo, Brazil), butyl hydroxy toluene (BHT) (Biovital, São Carlos, Brazil), ethoxydiglycol (Brasquim, Porto Alegre, Brazil), ammonium acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP copolymer and disodium EDTA (Pharmaspecial, Itapevi, Brazil), soybean lecithin, isopropyl palmitate, phenoxyethanol, parabens, propylene glycol, and cereal alcohol (AllChemistry, São Paulo, Brazil). Skin permeation was used the phosphate buffer saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) prepared with salts: sodium chloride (Pharmaespecial, Itapevi, Brazil), potassium chloride (Galena, Campinas, Brazil), dibasic sodium phosphate dodecahydrate (Quirios, Barueri, Brazil), and potassium phosphate monobasic (Química Moderna, Barueri, Brazil). High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) used solvents ethanol, P.A. (Synth, Diadema, Brazil), and HPLC grade methanol (Merck, São Paulo, Brazil). Analytical validation used vitamin D 3 standard (purity > 98%) from Sigma-Aldrich®. All deionized water used was from Milli-Q system (Merck Millipore, São Paulo, Brazil).
Formulation
The preparation of the formulations consisted in separately weighing the components of the oil and aqueous phase. Vitamin D 3 was solubilized in cereal alcohol and added to the aqueous phase after the gel was formed. Each phase was transferred to syringes and connected to each other, and the extrusion method was performed in order to form the emulsion through a high pressure [ , ]. Formulation 1 (F1) was the gel control without the primary chemical penetration enhancers (soybean lecithin, isopropyl palmitate, and ethoxydiglycol), and formulation 2 (F2) was the complete formulation of a cream (Table I ).

HPLC Analysis
The high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system was solvent delivery units (LC-20AD/T), degassing units (DGU 20A5R), system controllers (CBM 20A), autosampler (SIL-20AHT), column oven (CTO-20A), photodiode array detector (SPD-M20A), and column (Shim-pack VP-ODS 250L × 4.6) all from Shimadzu®. The chromatogram conditions were methanol (HPLC grade), and water was the mobile phase (98:2), 1.2 mL/min of flux rate, injection 40 μL, column temperature 40°C, and absorption at 265 nm [ ]. Specificity, linearity, precision, accuracy, detection limit (DL), and quantification limit (QL) were evaluated [ ]. Determination of DL and QL was based on signal-to-noise approach, and the concentrations tested were 10, 20, 40, 60, and 80 ng/mL in triplicate [ ].
Vitamin D3 Solubility
The solubility of vitamin D 3 in receptor fluid was evaluated in order to maintain the sink condition during the experiment of skin permeation [ ]. Excess of vitamin D 3 (25 mg/mL) was solubilized in a mixture of PBS with ethanol (40 and 50%) and maintained for 24 h under stirring (100 rpm) at 35°C. During the experiment, aliquots at 0, 0.5, 1, 3, 4, 5, 22, and 24 h were collected and analyzed. The procedure to analyze were collected 3 mL of receptor fluid, transferred to a conical tube, and submitted to a centrifuge at 7000 rpm for 15 min [ ]. Aliquots of 1 mL were filtered in a 0.45-μm membrane and placed in vials for analysis at HPLC.
Membrane
Human skin extracted from a female abdomen surgery was the membrane used (“golden standard”) [ ]. The hypodermis was removed with a scalpel, and the skin remained with full thickness (1000 μm) to guarantee the evaluation of retention in layers of the skin [stratum corneum (SC), epidermis and dermis (E + D)] [ , ]. After that, the skin was cut into pieces and frozen (− 20°C). Ethical committees in humans of Universidade Federal de São Paulo (UNIFESP—no. 59667916.2.0000.5505) and University of São Paulo (USP—no. 59667916.2.3001.0067) approved this use in 2016.
Membrane Integrity Test by Transepidermal Water Loss
The barrier function efficiency of the skin was evaluated by a non-invasive method defined as transepidermal water loss (TEWL) that measurement the water vapor that skin eliminates [ ]. The equipment utilized was Tewameter® TM 210 (Courage & Khazaka), and the probe was applied at surface of skin before and after the experiments of skin retention and permeation. Basal values above 10 g/h/m 2 were discarded [ ].
Skin Retention and Permeation
Static Franz diffusion cells were used [ ]. Infinite dose, approximately 300 mg of formulations (300 IU), was applied at SC of human skin placed between donor chamber (1.17 cm 2 ) and receiver chamber (3.6 mL) [ , ]. Receptor fluid was placed carefully to avoid bubbles at receiver chamber, was constantly magnetically stirred (600 rpm), and maintained at 32°C [ ]. The experiment was evaluated individually at 1, 4, and 24 h. After every hour, the receptor fluid was collected and the skin retention was verified. The residual formulation, SC, and E + D were separately evaluated. Swabs were utilized to clean the skin of residual formulation and were placed at glass amber bottle with 20 mL of ethanol. Tape stripping was used to extract the SC by applying 15 tapes on the skin with a pressure of 225 g/cm 2 for 5 s, and all tapes were transferred to a glass amber bottle with 20 mL ethanol [ ]. E + D were cut into little pieces and conditioned in glass amber bottle with 20 mL of ethanol [ ]. The extraction method was vortexed (2500 rpm) for 5 min and sonicated for 15 min, filtered through a 0.45-μm membrane, and placed in vials for HPLC quantification [ ]. The light was avoided during this test to protect of vitamin D 3 photodegradation.
Statistical Analyses
Statistical analyses were performed at program Minitab® version 17. Two-sample t test for equal means evaluated differences between formulations (not paired) and between initial and final values (paired). The significance level was 0.05, and p values ( p < 0.05) were considered statistically different [ ]. Replicates of three or more were used for experiments, and the results were demonstrated with mean values and standard deviation (mean ± SD).
RESULTS
HPLC Analysis
Specificity was confirmed by analyzing chromatograms with or without vitamin D 3 at formulation (Fig. 1 ) and solvents [PBS with 50% of ethanol in contact to skin, ethanol with a swab, tape strips, epidermis, and dermis]. No signal was detected at retention time of vitamin D 3 (approximately 11 min). Linearity was evaluated in triplicate at six different concentrations in the range 0.1 to 2 μg/mL. The average curve was linear as shown in Fig. 2 . The R 2 was 0.9991, and regression equation was y = 90,909 x − 9.124 where the y is the peak area (AU) and x is the vitamin D 3 concentration (μg/mL). Fig. 1 Chromatogram of formulation 2 (F2) with and without vitamin D 3 to verify the specificity of HPLC method Fig. 2 The linearity of a method for vitamin D 3 quantification by HPLC
The mean intra-assay and intermediate precision of three concentrations (0.48, 1.00, and 1.50 μg/mL) were represented as relative deviation with values of 0.627, 0.519, and 0.268% and 1.962, 3.790, and 1.480%, respectively. Accuracy was evaluated with the same concentrations of precision and was obtained the recoveries values of 97.99, 100.29, and 103.59%. The DL and QL were 20 and 40 ng/mL, respectively.
Vitamin D3 Solubility
Sink condition was achieved at PBS with 50% of ethanol (PBS/ETOH 50%), and lower concentrations were found in PBS with 40% of ethanol (PBS/ETOH 40%). For example, at initial time ( t 0), the estimated value of PBS was as follows: for ETOH 50% was 184.73 ± 6.21 μg/mL and for PBS/ETOH 40% was 6.85 ± 2.10 μg/mL. The experiment was conducted with exposure to indirect daylight and was confirmed the degradation of vitamin D 3 along 24 h. To avoid degradation in 24 h, another test was evaluated with protective of daylight. This test was able to verify in 24 h the vitamin D 3 in receptor fluid with estimated values of 110.22 ± 3.02 μg/mL for PBS/ETOH 50% and 2.87 ± 0.89 μg/mL for PBS/ETOH 40% (Fig. 3 ). Fig. 3 Vitamin D 3 solubility of PBS with 40% of ethanol (PBS: ETOH 40%) and PBS with 50% of ethanol (PBS: ETOH 50%) along 24 h with a indirect daylight and b daylight protective (mean ± SD) ( n = 3)
Membrane Integrity Test by TEWL
The receptor fluid that had appropriate sink condition was PBS/ETOH 50%, and to verify the skin integrity, the TEWL of a human skin with the presence of receptor fluid was evaluated. Significant difference was not found between the initial and final time, 7.25 ± 0.51 and 7.10 ± 0.46 g/h/m 2 , respectively (Fig. 4 ). Fig. 4 Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) values at time 0 and 24 h to evaluate the integrity of a human skin with contact of receptor fluid (PBS with ethanol 50%) (mean ± SD) ( n = 15)
The integrity of human skin along the experiment of skin retention and permeation was tested before and after the test. Since this experiment was studied individually, each final times (1, 4, and 24 h) had the initial time ( t 0) as basal values for F1 and F2. The basal values for F1 at 1, 4, and 24 h were 7.92 ± 0.55, 6.77 ± 0.73, 7.06 ± 0.50 g/h/m 2 , respectively, and for F2 were 7.38 ± 0.20, 7.26 ± 0.30, and 7.82 ± 0.39 at same times, respectively. The final values were higher than initial time values. Significant statistical differences were found at 4 and 24 h for F1 and for F2 at 1 and 4 h. Most of the values with a statistical difference were above the limit of 10 g/h/m 2 except the value at 4 h for F2 with 9.27 ± 0.60 g/h/m 2 . Although the other values were close to the limit. For example at 1 h for F2, the value was 10.23 ± 0.94 g/h/m 2 , and for F1, it was 12.33 ± 0.77 g/h/m 2 for 4 h and 10.14 ± 0.18 g/h/m 2 for 24 h (Figs. 5 and 6 , respectively).

Asterisk indicates values statistically different from t 0 (basal value) ( p < 0.05)
Skin Retention and Permeation
Skin retention and permeation results are presented in Table II . Statistical difference between F1 and F2 was obtained at skin surface for the first hour. No permeation was detected for two formulations evaluated. Vitamin D 3 was detected at 1 and 4 h at SC and at E + D in 24 h for F1 and was retained at the skin surface for F2. The range of vitamin D 3 recovery for F1 at skin surface was 79.99 ± 3.36 to 88.11 ± 5.09% (Table III ) and for F2 was 90.98 ± 3.22 to 100.79 ± 8.76% (Table IV ). The high biological variation of the human skin and the low values detected may explain the high coefficient of variation for F1 in SC and E + D (Table III ).

DISCUSSION
Transdermal route of vitamin D 3 is an alternative to supplementation for people with fat malabsorption and other diseases, but there is a few scientific literatures about it. However, some websites already commercialize transdermal products with vitamin D 3 in patches, sprays, and creams [ , , , ]. The concern was the feasibleness of the transdermal route. This study investigated the vitamin D 3 skin retention and permeation through human skin in cream and gel with some chemical penetration enhancers (soybean lecithin, isopropyl palmitate, propylene glycol, ethoxydiglycol, and cereal alcohol).
To make this study viable, the validation of an HPLC method was developed. The HPLC method of vitamin D 3 quantification in foodstuffs, by Bilodeau et al. [ ], was adapted to create a new method for quantifying this compound in topical formulations and at the skin (retention and permeation test). The new limit of detection (LD) and retention time (RT) of vitamin D 3 was lower than the literature, with values of 20 ng/mL for LD and 11 min for RT. These facts are important to evaluate vitamin D 3 faster and detect lower concentrations (more sensible). The method was approved for specificity, linearity, precision, accuracy, and detection and quantification limits [ ].
Before starting the skin permeation experiment, there was a need to verify the sink condition of receptor fluid to guarantee the diffusion process. European Medicines Agency [ ] defined the sink condition as the maximum concentration of the active obtained in the skin permeation test that should not exceed 10–30% of the solubility of the active substance in receptor fluid. Vitamin D 3 solubility was tested at different concentrations of ethanol added in PBS. The concentrations of ethanol 20 and 30% did not solubilize the excess of vitamin D 3 in PBS, precipitating. PBS with ethanol at 40% was discarded since it showed a lower concentration of vitamin D 3 that did not maintain the sink conditions. Therefore, the chosen receptor fluid was PBS with 50% ethanol.
The receptor fluid must not compromise the skin; thus, the TEWL method was used to evaluate the integrity of the model membrane in the receptor fluid presence. Although ethanol is a well-known chemical penetration enhancer, scientific literature indicates that its addition at 50% into the receptor fluid in skin permeation experiments with lipophilic substances is indicated [ , ]. Human skin in contact with the chosen receptor fluid for 24 h had no damage in its integrity in the conditions of the test. TEWL method was also assessed throughout the test of skin retention and permeation.
Values above 10 g/h/m 2 indicate that cutaneous barrier was compromised [ ]. At 4 and 24 h of the experiment, the skin was compromised for F1 (gel), probably due to the action of chemical penetration enhancers (cereal alcohol and propylene glycol) that extracted lipids from the stratum corneum [ , ]. It is important to note that this effect was not demonstrated for the 1-h assessment which was close to the basal value. Therefore, it was suggested that this mechanism of action did not begin within the first hour of application, but appeared from 4 h of experiment and persisted within 24 h. The opposite result was shown for F2 (cream) with most TEWL values below the 10 g/h/m 2 limit, but at 1 h, the value was slightly higher (10.23 ± 0.94 g/h/m 2 ). Thus, what probably happened was that the chemical penetration enhancers especially isopropyl palmitate and ethoxydiglycol had a rapid action effect in 1 h which slightly compromised the integrity of the skin. However, this effect was reversed in 4 and 24 h with a decrease of the final values. This probably occurred due to the presence of soy lecithin that acts occluding the skin and consequently hydration occurred [ , ].
To verify the security and feasibleness of formulations, the skin retention and permeation were assessed. Alsaqr et al. [ ] used this test to evaluate the transdermal delivery of vitamin D 3 through porcine skin in 24 h. Ointments with oleic acid and dodecylamine as chemical penetration enhancers were evaluated. The results were retention at SC and epidermis for three formulations assessed (control, oleic acid, and dodecylamine). The formulation with dodecylamine had the higher amount of vitamin D 3 at receptor fluid, but it was not enough to achieve the diary dose values (400 UI). After a pre-treatment of porcine skin with 50% ethanol, the permeation was acceptable for supplementary diary dose. They concluded that combination of dodecylamine and ethanol favored the vitamin D 3 permeation and suggested that transdermal route could be effective. Nevertheless, is well known that porcine skin has a higher permeability due to the greater amount of hair follicle than human skin. Hence, human skin is a golden standard for skin retention and permeation test since it is more realistic [ ].
Ramezanli et al. [ ] investigated the skin retention and permeation of polymeric nanospheres with vitamin D 3 through human cadaver skin in 12 h. The vitamin D 3 solution with ethoxydiglycol was used to compare the results. The larger amount of vitamin D 3 was found in the epidermis, and no active was detected in the receptor fluid. Nanospheres had a higher topical delivery than the control. Therefore, they suggested that nanospheres can be used as a carrier for topical delivery of vitamin D 3 . The results of skin retention and permeation test with human skin from abdominal surgery present at this paper were similar to the findings of Ramezanli et al. [ ]. Vitamin D 3 presented in both formulations tested was not detected at receptor fluid and was not demonstrated permeation. However, F1 with cereal alcohol and propylene glycol as chemical penetration enhancers showed a potential vitamin D 3 passage through the SC reaching E + D in 24 h. The vitamin D 3 at F2 with soybean lecithin, isopropyl palmitate, propylene glycol, ethoxydiglycol, and cereal alcohol as chemical penetration enhancers was retained at skin surface and was not delivered from formulation. These findings corroborate with the results of the integrity of skin by TEWL. Although there is a greater amount of chemical penetration enhancers in F2, the skin was not compromised and passage through the skin was not favored. In contrast to F1 with two chemical penetration enhancers present (cereal alcohol and propylene glycol) that could demonstrate an effective function since it compromised the skin in 24 h, which facilitated the detection of vitamin D 3 in the skin. In addition, the vitamin D 3 high value of log p (10.24) could also justify these results [ ]. Vitamin D 3 had a higher affinity with the vehicle in the cream and a lower affinity with the gel probably due to its lipophilicity. This is probably why the vitamin D 3 was retained at skin surface for F2 (cream) and was detected in the skin layers for F1 (gel).
Overall, these findings suggested a topical use for vitamin D 3 , since the transdermal route was not feasible because no active was permeated by the human skin into the formulations evaluated. The most suitable pharmaceutical form for the topical administration of vitamin D 3 may be the gel form, since it was detected at E + D in 24 h. This is interesting for the topical treatment of psoriasis with vitamin D 3 , which was approved in 2009 by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [ ].
CONCLUSION
We concluded that 50% of ethanol into the receptor fluid did not compromise the skin, since rate of water vapor did not statistically change in 24 h under the test conditions; skin integrity was compromised by association of chemical penetration enhancers (cereal alcohol and propylene glycol) in gel which facilitated the detection of vitamin D 3 through the human skin; the combination of chemical penetration enhancers (soybean lecithin, isopropyl palmitate, propylene glycol, ethoxydiglycol, and cereal alcohol) in cream was not indicated to promote the skin retention and permeation; the affinity with the vehicle was influenced by the lipophilicity of vitamin D 3 which had more affinity with the cream than with the gel; the formulations tested were not permeated. Hence, the transdermal route of vitamin D 3 is not feasible according to these data. However, less lipophilic derivatives of vitamin D 3 and other combinations of penetration enhancers should be tested to evaluate the feasibility of transdermal route.
