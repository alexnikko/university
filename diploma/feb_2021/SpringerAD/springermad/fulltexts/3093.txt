Introduction
Cervical cancer and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are both significant public health problems in India. As per WHO 2018 figures, cervical cancer is the fourth most widespread cancer comprising of 6.6% of all female cancer, with an estimated of 570,000 new cases in 2018. Approximately 90% of deaths in low- and middle-income countries occurred from cervical cancer [ ]. Immunosuppressed HIV-infected women are at risk of developing cervical cytological abnormalities. HIV infection is associated with an increased risk of abnormalities in the cervix called cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions (SILs). In healthy women, the low-grade form of this type of abnormality often disappears on its own without treatment [ ]. Also, women who are HIV-positive are at an increased risk of infection with human papillomavirus (HPV), which are known to cause cervical cancer and its precursor lesions [ ].
Many studies that have been done worldwide and in India have shown that HPV is the main etiologic agent with one or more of the high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) types for the development of cervical cancer with known risk factors such as early age at first intercourse, history of multiple sexual partners, oral contraceptive use, lower socioeconomic status and immunosuppression [ , ]. The natural course of HPV infection is altered in people infected with the HIV, and there is an increased possibility of persistent HPV infections in this population [ ]. This persistent infection augments their risk of having cervical SILs. HIV-positive women especially those with severe immunosuppression are five times more chance than HIV seronegative women to have cervical SILs. High HPV viral load in HIV-positive women is associated with ten times increase risk of cervical SILs in severe immunosuppression [ ]. Interestingly, the average age of these dually infected women is 30–40 years, suggesting that HPV is more likely to be persistent in the setting of HIV infection, or that HPV viral reactivation may take place [ ].
Advanced HIV disease is associated with a high prevalence of cervical SILs and of infection with oncogenic HR-HPV genotypes (HPV-16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 45, 52b and 58). Around 20–35% of HIV-infected women without previous evidence of cervical disease will develop cervical SILs within 3 years [ , ]. Recent studies have shown that CD4+ cell counts are strong determinants of the ability to detect HPV, suggesting that as the immune system weakens, it facilitates the reactivation of the HPV and thus clarifies the increase rates of HPV infection in women with HIV [ , ]. Additionally, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) does not seem to impact this increased rate or persistent of HPV infections in this population [ ]. For many years, the focus of care for HIV seropositive patients was on immune system reconstitution using HAART. Patients receiving HAART die less frequently from opportunistic infections (OIs) but more now face morbidity from chronic medical diseases and other illnesses like malignancies, and one such disease is cervical cancer [ ]. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has greatly reduced the morbidity and mortality in HIV patients, but its effect on the evolution of cervical cytological changes in HIV-positive women is full of controversy [ , ].
Cervical cancer prevention programs in both developed and developing nations generally have relied on cytological testing using the Papanicolaou (PAP) smear [ ]. HIV-positive women are candidates for closer monitoring of cervical pathology. The high prevalence of HR-HPV and cervical cytology abnormalities demonstrates the need to screen and monitor HIV seropositive women and to implement preventative measures to decrease the numbers of females with HR-HPV infections. Most patients reported not having yearly PAP smears, and unfortunately, routine HR-HPV screening is also not conducted at the healthcare centers where most of these patients receive their PAP smears. Screening for HR-HPV infections in HIV seropositive females should be an integral component of their routine gynecological evaluation, and these patients should be encouraged and provisions be made for ease of access to having regular PAP smears and HR-HPV testing [ ]. While few studies from India are available showing cervical smear abnormalities in HIV-infected women regardless of treatment status, not much data are available correlating the same with CD4 counts and HR-HPV.
Methodology
This cross-sectional study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital for a period of 2 years. The study was cleared by the Institute Ethics Committee. Informed consent was obtained from all the patients. One hundred HIV-positive women > 18 years of age attending antiretroviral (ART) center were considered in this study. Women < 18 years, post-hysterectomy patients and pregnant women were excluded.
A detailed history was taken from all the patients, and a questionnaire included patient’s name, date of birth, date of diagnosis of HIV infection, intravenous drug abuse, smoking history, first day of last menstrual period, abnormally heavy bleeding, bleeding after intercourse, bleeding between periods, postmenopausal bleeding and vaginal discharge.
Pelvic examination was done; a PAP smear was taken using a cytobrush; and a cervical sample was also collected for HPV testing. The collected samples were sent to pathology laboratory and stored at − 20 °C maximum for 1 week until required. CD4 cell counts were extracted from records available at ART center. PAP smears were interpreted and classified according to modified The Bethesda System (TBS), 2014, for reporting cervical cytology. Women with cervical SILs were referred to the Department of Gynecology for colposcopy and/or cervical biopsy, and those with other abnormalities have been asked for repeat PAP smears as per the guidelines.
PCR for HPV 16/18 was performed using a commercially available kit (Genei HPV Detection Kit) in molecular pathology laboratory. PCR for HPV 16/18 was carried out after extraction of DNA from material obtained from cervical region after scraping with a cervical brush. Amplification Master Mix (containing reaction buffer with MgCl 2 , dNTP’s and oncogenic HPV-specific primers) was prepared. For each sample, 21.6 µl of HPV amplification mix was mixed with 0.4 µl of GeNei Hot Start Taq polymerase. The vial of master mix supplied with the kit was first thawed and then mixed well. Amplification master mix was added into each of the required number of labeled vials. Extracted DNA from each sample as well as control was added for amplification reaction as per program in thermocycler. Analysis of amplified products was done by gel electrophoresis; an amplified product of size between 230 and 270 bp was indicative of infection with oncogenic HPV.
Data analysis was done using the software Epi Info 6, and p value was calculated by Chi-square test and Fisher’s exact 2-tailed test. p value of < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
Results
A total of 100 HIV-positive women were included in the study. All women had an adequate PAP smear and cervical samples for HPV testing. The age of the study population ranges from 20 to 55 years with the mean age being 33.34 years. Majority of the population belongs to the reproductive age-group, that is, 20–40 years comprising 84% of the cases. Out of these, 47% were in the 20- to 30-year age-group.
62.08% of HIV-positive women had a CD4 cell count in the range of 201–500 cells/cumm. 25.22% cases had CD4 cell counts in the range of 50–200 cells/cumm and 6.79% cases had more than 501 cells/cumm. CD4 cell counts of 3 women were not available since they were newly diagnosed as HIV-positive at the time when cervical smear was taken and subsequently lost to follow-up.
PAP smear showing various SILs is shown in Fig. 1 . Out of 100 cases, 16 had a LSIL and 3 had a high-grade squamous intraepithelial neoplasm (HSIL); one of these cases was further labeled as carcinoma in situ cannot be excluded. Out of 100 cases, 1 was found to have atypical glandular cells (AGCs) and 2 cases could not be fit in low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion and therefore were labeled as atypical squamous cells of uncertain significance (ASCUS). Out of 100 cases, combined HR-HPV (16/18) was positive in 35/100 (35%) cases. Women with cervical SILs and positive HR-HPV were referred to for colposcopy and/or cervical biopsy as per the clinical protocol.

Age-wise distribution of cytological smear result and HR-HPV in 100 HIV-positive women is tabulated in Table 1 . Out of 47 cases in the age-group of 20–30 years, 9 cases had LSIL, 1 case each had HSIL, AGC and ASCUS, respectively. PAP smear results in 37 HIV-positive cases in age-group of 31–40 years showed 5 LSIL cases, 1 case each HSIL and ASCUS. In the age-group of 41–50, 2 cases had LSIL and 1 had HSIL out of 15 cases. Twenty-one cases had HR-HPV in the age-group of 20–30 years. Ten cases were positive for HR-HPV in the age-group of 31–40 years. Four had HR-HPV in the age-group of 41–50 years.

Table 2 shows the correlation between cytological findings with PAP smear results. Out of 16 LSIL-positive females, 10 had both koilocytosis and squamous metaplasia, while 1 had koilocytosis only and 2 had squamous metaplasia. Out of 16 LSIL cases, 3 did not have either koilocytosis or squamous metaplasia. In HSIL-positive women, 1/3 had koilocytosis only, while the other one did not have koilocytosis or squamous metaplasia. Out of 3 cases of HSIL, 1 showed koilocytosis with tumor diathesis and so it was reported out as carcinoma cervix that cannot be excluded. One case which was detected to have AGC had koilocytosis. Both the cases of ASCUS had koilocytosis.

Table 2 also shows the correlation between cytological findings with HR-HPV; out of 16 LSIL cases, 12 (75%) were positive for HR-HPV. Out of 3 HSIL women, 2 (66.67%) were detected to have HR-HPV. AGC had a single HR-HPV positive case. A strong correlation between SILs and HR-HPV infection was found with p value of < 0.005. Yates-corrected Chi-square ( x 2 ) test p value is 0.00074 (< 0.05) which shows that there is a significant association between LSIL and HR-HPV in HIV-positive women. Fisher’s exact 2-tailed test p value is 0.28 (> 0.05) which shows there is no significant association between HSIL and HR-HPV. However, since out of 3 patients diagnosed as HSIL, 2 were HR-HPV-positive (66.67%), showing that there is an increased chance of HR-HPV detection in cases with HSIL in HIV-positive women. Fisher’s exact 2-tailed test p values: 0.35 (> 0.05) and 0.12 (> 0.05) for AGC abnormality and ASCUS in PAP smear, respectively, have no significant association with HR-HPV infection.
A strong correlation between koilocytosis and HR-HPV, with 11/13 koilocytic cases, was positive for HR-HPV. Out of 12 cases that had both koilocytosis and squamous metaplasia, 9 were positive for HR-HPV. Out of 12 women with squamous metaplasia, 5 were positive for HR-HPV. One patient who was reported as HSIL, but had tumor diathesis and koilocytosis, showed positivity for HR-HPV. However, 6/55 women who did not have koilocytosis or squamous metaplasia were also positive for HR-HPV.
Figure 2 shows the correlation between CD4 count with HR-HPV and SILs in HIV-positive women. 18, 2 and 11 cases with HR-HPV positivity, HSIL and LSIL have < 200 cells/cumm, respectively. Similarly, 8, 24, 15 and 26 cases who do not have HR-HPV, HSIL, LSIL or ASCUS have < 200 cells/cumm, respectively. On applying statistical analysis for HPV and CD4 count < 200 cells/cumm, the Yates-corrected Chi-square test ( x 2 ) = 15.02 which have p value = 0.00010 (< 0.05), which is highly significant, i.e., there is a strong correlation between low CD4 count and HR-HPV. On applying statistical analysis for correlation between LSIL and a CD4 count, Fisher’s exact 2-tailed test p value = 0.00014 (< 0.05), which is highly significant, shows a strong correlation between LSIL and low CD4 count < 200 cells/cumm. Statistical analysis applied for HSIL and ASCUS in correlation with CD4 count had p value more than 0.5, which shows that there is no statistical correlation.

Discussion
In this study, 100 HIV-positive women attending the ART center in a tertiary care hospital were randomly selected. Their cervical samples were studied and simultaneously tested for HR-HPV. All the cases selected for this study were more than 18 years of age. However, we had a study population ranging from 20 to 55 years of age, the mean age being 33.34 years. Both cervical SILs and benign lesions were found as cervical abnormalities in the present study. LSIL, HSIL, ASCUS and AGC were the precancerous lesions found. None of the cases were found to have invasive carcinoma in the present study. However, one case which was diagnosed as HSIL had tumor diathesis and therefore was given as ‘carcinoma in situ cannot be excluded’. Women with cervical SILs in this study underwent colposcopic examination and/or cervical biopsy.
Table 3 compares the cervical SILs in this study with those found in the other international and Indian studies. Bagga et al. [ ] found 8 (5.9%) cases to have LSIL, 3 (2.2%) with HSIL and 2 (1.5%) with ASCUS out of 136 HIV-positive women studied. Similarly in a progression/regression analysis study done by Omar et al. [ ], LSIL was found in 20.4% of cases, HSIL was seen in 13.5% and ASCUS was seen in 3.1% of cases. Carlucci et al. [ ] found 8%, 6.2% and 1.8% of cases with LSIL, HSIL and ASCUS, respectively. Another study by McKenzie et al. showed that out of 267 HIV-positive women, abnormal cytology was found in 123 women (46%) with 70 (26%) had LSIL, 22 (8%) had HSIL, 30 (11%) had ASCUS and 1 (0.4%) had AGC [ ]. Table 3 Comparison of SILs in HIV-positive women with other studies Cervical smear cytology Other studies Present study Bagga et al. [ ] Omar et al. [ ] ( n = 2325) Carlucci et al. [ ] McKenzie et al. [ ] LSIL 8/136 (5.9%) 20.4% 8% 70/267 (26%) 16/100 (16%) HSIL 3/136 (2.2%) 13.5% 6.2% 22/267 (8%) 3/100 (3%) AGC – – – 1/267 (0.4%) 1/100 (1%) ASCUS 2/136 (1.5%) 3.1% 1.8% 30/267 (11%) 2/100 (2%)
These studies were comparable to the present study in which out of 100 HIV-positive women 16 (16%) were found to have LSIL, 3 (3%) had HSIL (3%) and ASCUS was seen in 2 (2%). The higher percentage of HSIL and ASCUS in the study done by Omar et al. and McKenzie KP et al. could be because of the larger number of cases included in their study.
In a study done by Hameed et al. [ ] 15/101 cases were found to have ASCUS. These cases were also positive for HR-HPV. In the present study, 2/100 cases were found to have ASCUS, and both the cases were positive for HR-HPV. Though the number of ASCUS cases in our study is small, the fact that both the smears were positive for HR-HPV correlates the recommendations of Hameed et al. [ ] that routine screening of cervical cytology should be accompanied by HPV subtype identification in HIV-positive women.
Table 4 shows a few international and Indian studies showing prevalence of HPV including our study. Studies done by Zarcone et al., Peedicayil et al., Sarkar et al. and Joshi et al. showed the prevalence of HPV in HIV-positive women to be 41%, 37.3%, 32.2% and 33%, respectively [ , , , ]. The present study showed a prevalence of HR-HPV in HIV-positive women to be 35%, which is comparable with the above studies. The prevalence of 35% of HR-HPV (16/18) in our study population directs toward the necessity of screening for HR-HPV in HIV-infected women in India. Women with positive HR-HPV in this study underwent colposcopic examination and/or cervical biopsy. However, we should also keep in mind that HR-HPV typing is not easily available and also is not cost-effective in Indian scenario. Table 4 Prevalence of human papillomavirus in HIV-positive women Study Number of cases with HR-HPV Prevalence (%) Zarcone et al. [ ] 10/24 41 Peedicayil et al. [ ] 28/75 37.3 Sarkar et al. [ ] 30/93 32.2 Joshi et al. [ ] 33/100 33 Present study 35/100 35
A strong correlation between cervical SILs and HR-HPV with p value of < 0.05 was found in the present study as seen in the study done by Dionne et al. [ ]. Out of 16 LSIL cases in our study, 12 (75%) were found to have HR-HPV (16/18) which showed a strong statistical significance with p value < 0.05. Out of 3 HSIL cases, 2 (66.6%) were positive for HR-HPV, which showed that there is an increased chance of HR-HPV detection in cases with HSIL in women infected with HIV. The prevalence of LSIL and HSIL with HR-HPV was higher in our study in comparison with the study done by Mogtomo et al. [ ] which showed the overall prevalence of LSIL and HSIL associated with HPV to be 24.3% (17/70) and 31.4% (22/70), respectively. Also, ICO/IARC Information Centre on HPV and Cancer (HPV Information Centre), 2017 on Human Papillomavirus and Related Diseases Report showed prevalence of LSIL to be 25.8% and HSIL to be 51.9% which has prevalence of LSIL and HSIL with HR-HPV to be lesser than our study [ ]. Both cases with ASCUS were positive for HR-HPV in our study. One case of AGC which was found in our study was also found to be HR-HPV positive. Also noted was koilocytic change in the cervical smears which were present in 26/100 cases (26%). Out of 26 cases showing koilocytic changes, 21 were positive for HR-HPV.
One of the important variables chosen for this study was CD4 cell counts. CD4 counts were available for 97 women. Out of 97 women, 26 had CD4 count < 200 cells/cumm, 18 were positive for HR-HPV, 2 showed HSIL and 11 had LSIL. A strong statistical correlation was seen in between low CD4 count to that of detection of HR-HPV along with LSIL ( p value of 0.00010 and 0.00014, respectively). However, there was no correlation between low CD4 count and HSIL ( p value = 0.17; > 0.05) in our study. The association between low CD4 count with HR-HPV and LSIL in our study correlates with other studies done by Mbulawa et al. [ ] showing that there is an increase in risk of acquiring HPV infection with a lowering of the CD4 count. According to the study done by Delmas et al. [ ] there was twofold increase in both prevalence and incidence of SILs in HIV-positive women with CD4 count < 200 cells/cumm. In the same study, it has been stated that lower CD4 count causes severe HIV-related immunodeficiency which strongly increases the risk of occurrence of SILs. This is also seen in our study that out of three HSIL cases two cases (66.67%) had CD4 < 200/mm 3 . Similarly, out of 16 cases of LSIL, 11 (68.75%) had CD4 count < 200 cells/cumm. These findings are similar to the study done by Delmas et al. A similar study done by Firnhaber et al. [ ] stated that lower CD4 counts were consistently associated with a higher risk of cervical lesions which is also corroborated by our study.
Therefore, our findings suggest that routine screening of cervical cytology by PAP smear should include HPV subtype identification in HIV-infected women. Since HPV subtype identification may be expensive, at least a screening PCR for HR-HPV (HPV 16/18) as has been done in our study should be included in the routine screening of HIV-infected women.
Conclusion
We observed that immunosuppression and HPV infection in HIV-positive women were predictive of cervical SILs. A strong correlation between cervical SILs and HR-HPV in our study suggests that routine screening of cervical cytology by PAP smear should include HPV subtype identification in HIV-infected women to pick up cases which are likely to progress to invasive carcinoma, and such patients should be considered for the follow-up and close monitoring as these women are enrolled for long-term care of their HIV infection.
