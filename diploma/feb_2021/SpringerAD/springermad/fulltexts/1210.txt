Introduction
Spontaneous abortion is the expulsion of the fetus from the mother’s womb before 20 weeks of gestation. It occurs in 10 to 15% of the clinically recognized pregnancies. Spontaneous abortion is one of the most common adverse reproductive complications that occur in the first trimester of pregnancy [ ]. It is caused by various genetic, endocrine, anatomical, immunological, inflammatory, environmental and infectious agents. The maternal immunoregulatory response is required for the successful pregnancy to overcome the fetal rejection. The immunological cytokines play a major role in the proper development of the fetus during pregnancy. Interleukin-10 is a functionally important immunoregulatory cytokine produced by cytotrophoblasts at the maternal-fetal interface during pregnancy for a successful outcome, thereby maintaining the balance between humoral and inflammatory responses [ , , ]. IL-10 is encoded by five exons and four introns and is located at the 1q31-32 position. It is a potent cytokine with pleiotropic effects in the process of inflammation and immunoregulation [ , ]. IL-10 production will have its initial effect on the immune system of the mother to accept the fetal allograft as self and to induce the vascular development of the fetus. At the feto-maternal interface, the production of cytokines such as IL-10, induce improved growth of the placenta and may thus promote fetal survival. In contrast, altered production may lead to reduced fetal growth associated with pregnancy failure [ ]. Thus, IL-10 has a vital role in protecting the fetus from immunological rejection at the materno-fetal interface during pregnancy.
Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified in the IL-10 gene promoter region which regulates the expression of IL-10. Among these SNPs located in the promoter region of the IL-10 gene, three single nucleotide polymorphisms (G/A at -1082, C/T at -819, and C/A at -592 positions) in the proximal region, are associated with an increased frequency of spontaneous abortions [ , , ]. The -1082, a G>A substitution, occur within a transcription factor-binding site; the -819, a C>T substitution, lies within a putative regulatory region; the -592, a C>A substitution, links within a STAT 3 binding site. Thus, IL-10 polymorphisms at positions -1082, -819, and -592 respectively are involved in the regulation of transcription and have been functionally important in influencing the production of IL-10 which then influences spontaneous miscarriages by varied expression [ ].
The present study is a family based triad study aimed to determine the association of IL-10 gene promoter polymorphisms (-1082G/A (rs1800896), -819C/T (rs1800871), -592C/A (rs1800872)) and the haplotypes susceptible to spontaneous abortions considering maternal, paternal, and fetal groups.
Materials and methods
Subjects
A total of 80 case triad group and 100 control triad group were included in the present study. All the samples included in the study were collected from the Department of Obstetrics Gynecology, Government Maternity Hospital, Hyderabad, Telangana state over a period of 3 years from Feb 2013–April 2016. This study includes a total of 80 spontaneously aborted fetal tissues along with their parents (80 + 160 = 240) and 100 medically terminated normal fetal tissues along with their parents (100 + 200 = 300). Medically terminated pregnancy refers to the termination of pregnancy with use of medication alone other than surgery. These terminations are not due to medical reasons, thus considered as control fetuses. Aborted fetal tissues (50 mg) were collected in the saline solution from the mothers with spontaneous abortions and medically terminated pregnancies. A total of 5 ml of peripheral blood was collected in EDTA vacutainers from all the case and control couples for genotyping of IL-10 gene promoter polymorphisms. Details of the demographic features such as maternal age, paternal age, gestational duration, the number of miscarriages, consanguinity, etc. were collected with the help of a standard pro forma. Detailed clinical information from all the participants was recorded before sample collection along with an informed consent from all the couples. All the cases with consecutive spontaneous abortions were uniformly evaluated for several known causes of abortions. These include investigation of toxoplasmosis, hepatitis B and C, cytomegalovirus, rubella, HIV, protein C, protein S, prolactin dosage, thyroid hormone levels, glucose levels, and antiphospholipid antibodies and found no complications throughout their gestational period. The uterine cavity was investigated by hysteroscopy, hysterosalpingography, serial ultrasound scan to identify polycystic ovaries, and transvaginal ultrasound was carried out to confirm the spontaneous abortion. The present study was approved by the Institutional Ethical Committee.
The inclusion criteria
The case couples with at least two consecutive spontaneous abortions in early pregnancy with an unexplained etiology before the 20th week of gestational age and lack of any successful pregnancy in the previous history were included in the study. The control couples of the same ethnic group with at least two normal pregnancies with no previous history of abortions, absence of infertility complications like pre-eclampsia, still births and ectopic pregnancy, lack of physiological abnormalities with no reproductive complications, and no known medical illnesses were included in the present study. Case and control fetuses within 20 weeks of gestational age were considered.
The exclusion criteria
The participants with a history of risk factors like chronic infections, thrombosis, autoimmune diseases, endocrinological disorders, or congenital anomalies were not included in the present study. Subjects using oral contraceptives and any other medications before or during the course of pregnancy were also excluded.
Determination of IL-10 gene promoter polymorphisms
Genomic DNA was extracted from fetal tissues and peripheral blood by modified phenol-chloroform method [ ]. The isolated DNA was then genotyped by amplification refractory mutation system–polymerase chain reaction method (ARMS-PCR) for the detection of IL-10 (-1082G/A, -819C/T,-592C/A) gene promoter polymorphisms using sequence specific primers. −1082—common reverse 5′ GTA AGC TTC TGT GGC TGG AGT C 3′, G- forward 5′ AAC ACT ACT AAG GCT TCT TTG GGT G 3′, A- forward 5′ AAC ACT ACT AAG GCT TCT TTG GGT A 3′ (161 bp); −819—common reverse 5′ AGG ATG TGT TCC AGG CTC CT 3′, C- forward 5′ CCC TTG TACAGG TGA TGT AAC 3′, T- forward 5′ ACC CTT GTA CAG GTG ATG TAA T 3′ (223 bp); −592—common reverse 5′ CAA GCC CCT GAT GTG TAG A 3′, C- forward 5′ CTG TGA CCC CGC CTG TC 3′, A- forward 5′ CTG TGA CCC CGC CTG TA 3′ (600 bp). The optimized reaction conditions for the amplification were performed in 10 μl with a 25–50 ηg DNA sample, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8·4), 50 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 0·2 mM each deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), 2 μM each specific/common primers, and 0·25 units of Taq DNA polymerase. The cycling conditions were as follows: an initial denaturation at 95 ° C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles at 95 ° C for 30 s, 64·2 °C for 50 s, and 72 °C for 1·5 min. The final extension step was at 72 ° C for 5 min. The PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on an agarose gel (2%) stained with ethidium bromide. The gel was visualized under ultraviolet light with a 100 base pairs (bp) ladder. All the collected samples were genotyped and the results were cross-checked with internal positive (796 bp of human leucocyte antigen (HLA) gene) and negative controls (Millipore water) [ ]. Ten percent of the samples were taken randomly and regenotyped for validation. The findings revealed 100% concordance with the genotype results.
Statistical analysis
Genotypic distribution and allele frequencies of case group (spontaneously aborted fetuses and their parents) and control group (medically terminated fetuses and their parents) were analyzed by chi-square test to assess the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. All the p values were determined by two-tailed Fisher’s exact test. To measure the strength of association between IL-10 gene promoter polymorphisms (-1082G/A, -819C/T,-592C/A) and spontaneous abortions, odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. A p value <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Statistical analysis between groups was determined by χ2 test using SNPstat [ ]. The coefficient (D’) of pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD), the non-random association between the SNPs was calculated using the haploview version 4·2 [ ].
Results
IL-10 promoter polymorphisms analysis
The present study was carried out in a total of 80 case triads and 100 control triads. Table 1 gives the demographic details of the controls and the case triad groups which are matched for maternal age, paternal age, consanguinity, the number of miscarriages, and gestational age. The demographic analysis of 80 case couples and 100 control couples revealed a statistically significant difference with respect to subsets of maternal age ( p = 0·0002), paternal age ( p = 0·004), consanguinity ( p = 0·00001), and gestational duration ( p = 0·001). The present study revealed a statistically significant difference in case couples with consanguinity particularly among subsets 20–25 and 26–30 years indicating that consanguineous marriages play a possible role to spontaneous abortions compared to that of non-consanguineous marriages. However, there was no variation observed with regard to number of miscarriages and parity.

Linkage disequilibrium analysis
Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis, defined by the delta coefficient (D′), was estimated in both case and control triad groups for the three SNPs of IL-10, G −1082A, C −819T, and C−592A. Linkage disequilibrium observed between the three SNPs of IL-10 polymorphism in case fetuses, maternal, and paternal groups are given in Figs. 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively. LD was observed between locus -1082 and at locus -819 (D’ = 0.5921), between locus -1082 and at locus -592 (D’ = 0.7059), and between locus -819 and at locus -592 (D’ = 0.942) in aborted fetuses. LD was also observed between locus -1082 and at locus -819 (D’ = 0.864), between locus -1082 and at locus -592 (D’ = 0.5757), and between allele T at locus -819 and allele A at locus -592 (D’ = 0.7114) in case mothers. No linkage disequilibrium was observed in case fathers. Linkage disequilibrium was not observed among control fetuses, maternal, and paternal groups with respect to the studied SNPs.

Discussion
IL-10 is an important anti-inflammatory cytokine produced mainly during embryonic development, plays an important role in the successful implantation and maintenance of embryo during pregnancy. It is a multifunctional cytokine with both anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive functions. Age-wise comparison of both mothers and fathers revealed higher percent of mothers in the age group of 26–30 years and fathers in the age group of 31–35 years. Case-control comparison revealed significant difference in all the age groups. Such an observation in support with the previous studies suggests that the incidence of miscarriages increases with increase in maternal age and paternal age [ ]. During early pregnancy, anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-10 levels are lowered in mothers with spontaneous abortions than in those with normal pregnancy [ ]. IL-10 is produced in higher levels by the placental tissue during first and second trimesters compared to the third trimester of pregnancy thereby suggesting an immunosuppressive role of IL-10 during gestation. IL-10 production is increased in a variety of hematopoietic cells like macrophages, natural killer cells and T cells at maternal-fetal interface in early and mid-pregnancy [ ]. IL-10 is produced abundantly by the maternal decidual T lymphocytes during normal pregnancy. In contrary, these cells showed reduced production of IL-10 which results in adverse pregnancy outcomes contributing to increased risk of spontaneous abortions. The Th2 type immune response to placental and trophoblastic antigens diminishes in miscarriages leading to lowered serum IL-10 levels. Thus, IL-10 is an important anti-inflammatory cytokine in maintaining the pregnancy outcome and its altered production results in reproductive complications leading to pregnancy loss [ , ]. Women with reduced IL-10 production are at an increased risk to several disorders of pregnancy, resulting in the poor placental development and an increased risk of spontaneous abortions [ ]. It has been reported that SNPs in the promoter region may control the regulation of IL-10 production [ ]. Thus, single nucleotide polymorphisms in the IL-10 promoter region are linked to variation in the IL-10 production and were correlated with spontaneous abortions. Hence, it is observed that IL-10 plays a crucial role during pregnancy by controlling the fetal tissue damage [ ]. It is secreted by cytotrophoblasts that are encoded by maternal and paternal genes. The present study was thus conducted in parents to determine the role of maternal and paternal IL-10 polymorphism along with its effect in spontaneously aborted fetuses.
In the present family based triad study, three promoter polymorphisms of the IL-10 gene (-G1082A, − C819T, and −C592A) were investigated in case fetuses and their parents along with control fetuses and their parents. Our results showed that there is a significant association of IL-10 -1082G/A ( p = .00002), -819C/T ( p = 0.000004), and -592 C/A ( p = 0.0000009) polymorphisms in case maternal and fetal groups compared with their respective control groups. No significant association among the three SNPs was observed in case fathers relative to control fathers. This study revealed that the genotype of the three IL-10 sites may act as independent prognostic risk genotypes/alleles to spontaneous abortions.
Several studies were carried out from different populations to determine the association of IL-10 gene polymorphisms in spontaneous abortions at the genotypic and the haplotypic level. Daher et al. (2003) showed no significant association of -1082A/G and -592 C/A SNPs with recurrent pregnancy loss [ ]. Zammiti et al. (2006) observed an association of IL-10 -592 A/C and IL-10 -819 C/T but not IL-10 -1082 A/G promoter polymorphisms in 350 Tunisian women with idiopathic recurrent miscarriages [ ]. Bahadori et al. (2014) also suggest that IL-10 promoter gene polymorphisms (-592 A/C and -819 C/T) were significantly higher in Iranian women with recurrent miscarriages [ ]. Kamali-Sarvestani et al. (2005) reported a significant association of -592C/A, but not -819C/T polymorphism and the occurrence of recurrent miscarriages in Iranian women [ ]. Camil Bohiltea et al. (2014) demonstrated a possible association between IL-10 -819 C/T promoter polymorphism and idiopathic recurrent spontaneous abortions among Romanian patients [ ]. Parveen et al. (2013) and Medica et al. (2009) independently observed an association between -1082G/A and 200 north Indian women with recurrent pregnancy loss [ , ]. Alkhuriji et al. (2013) found no significant differences in the distribution of IL-10 (-592C/A) genotype frequencies in Saudi females with recurrent spontaneous abortions [ ]. Sowmya et al. (2014) reported the IL-10 -819 C and -592 A allele frequencies to be increased significantly in pre-eclamptic women [ ]. In contrast, Prigoshin et al. (2004) and Babbage et al. (2001) studies demonstrated the lack of association of these SNPs with recurrent spontaneous abortions clearly pointing to gene pool variation and genetic diversity of Indian cohort [ , ].
Few haplotype studies indicated that the three common -1082 A/G, -819 T/C, and -592 A/C promoter polymorphisms of the IL-10 may affect the production of IL-10. The GCC haplotype is associated with increased IL-10 production and ATA haplotype with a lowered IL-10 production [ ]. IL-10 haplotype distribution of IL-10 (-1082 (rs1800896), -592 (rs1800872), and -819 (rs1800871)) in the present study demonstrated that the haplotypes A 1082 C 819 A 592 G 1082 C 819 A 592 showed a statistically significant association and increased prevalence among spontaneously aborted fetuses. G 1082 T 819 C 592 haplotype, G 1082 C 819 A 592 , A 1082 T 819 A 592, and A 1082 C 819 C 592 haplotypes in the maternal group were significantly associated with an increased risk to spontaneous abortions. A 1082 T 819 A 592 haplotype revealed a significant protective association in case fetuses compared with their respective controls. A 1082 T 819 A 592 and G 1082 C 819 A 592 haplotypes in paternal group showed protective role in spontaneous abortions. Association of haplotype frequencies in maternal and fetal group and not in paternal group rules out the possibility of co-segregation of alleles from the paternal side and the possible maternal genomic imprinting of IL-10 gene as the alternative hypothesis. Imprinting genes are normally involved in mammalian embryonic growth and development by highly regulating the expression of alleles with the parental origin [ ]. One possible mechanism for maternal and fetal association with IL-10 gene polymorphism but not with paternal group indicates genomic imprinting inherited from one parent with epigenetic modifications might result in monoallelic expression leading to the altered gene regulation. The presence of such imprinting changes the allelic expression that operates on parental haplotypes in the interaction through a random silencing process resulting in parent-of-origin dependent expression [ ]. The 3 SNPs at promoter regions -1082 G/A, -592 C/A, and -819 C/T are in complete linkage disequilibrium, with G-C-A, A-C-A haplotypes in fetuses and A-T-A, G-T-C, A-C-C, G-C-A haplotypes in mothers. In contrast with our results, D’Alfonso et al. (2000) studies reported strong LD between the -1082A/G, -819T/C, and -592A/C SNPs, with only three haplotypes (A-C-C, A-T-A, and G-C-C) being the most prevalent of the possible eight haplotypes [ ]. Crilly et al. (2003) and Costeas et al. (2004) showed that A-T-A haplotype is associated with reduced IL-10 transcription compared to the G-C-C or A-C-C haplotypes [ , ]. Thus, the discrepancies in the association of IL-10 haplotypes in different ethnic groups may be indicative of abortion-prone risk, which could be explained by ethnic differences of the study groups and the study subjects.
To the best of our knowledge, no studies have been reported on the association of IL-10 promoter polymorphisms and spontaneous abortions in maternal, paternal, and fetal groups. This is the first triad study reporting a significant correlation of the three promoter polymorphisms of IL-10 with spontaneous abortions from Telangana state of South India.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the present study reports a significant association of the genotype, allele, and haplotype frequencies of the three IL-10 promoter polymorphisms (-1082A/G, -819T/C, and -592A/C) in aborted fetuses along with paternal, maternal groups in comparison to medically terminated fetal, maternal and paternal groups. The promoter IL-10 polymorphisms were majorly associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortions in aborted fetuses and their mothers in comparison to their respective controls. There is no such significant association observed in case fathers compared to the control fathers. Further, IL-10 haplotype distribution also revealed an increased prevalence of the A 1082 C 819 A 592 haplotype among the fetal group and A 1082 T 819 A 592 haplotype among the maternal group. This study also showed a strong linkage disequilibrium of these three SNPs in spontaneously aborted fetuses and also in their mothers indicating that the interaction between the alleles expressed in mothers were transferred to offspring revealing the role of maternal imprinting effects. Finally, the present triad study clearly suggests that IL-10 gene polymorphisms at positions -1082, -819, and -592 could be a major genetic regulator in the etiology of spontaneous abortions.
