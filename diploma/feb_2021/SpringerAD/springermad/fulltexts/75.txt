Background
Infective endocarditis (IE) is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality, resulting from local damage to cardiac structures, metastatic infection, embolic phenomenon, or immune-mediated damage. With early mortality in IE ranging from 10% to 30% and 1-year mortality up to 40%, , prompt diagnosis and initiation of appropriate therapy is critical. Current practice guidelines use modified Duke criteria , for the diagnosis of IE which has around 80% sensitivity for the diagnosis of native valve endocarditis (NVE), and lower sensitivity for the diagnosis of culture-negative endocarditis. – Fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose ( 18 F-FDG) positron-emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) has demonstrated potential as an adjunctive diagnostic tool in the evaluation of IE, with high diagnostic accuracy reported in small studies. We therefore performed a meta-analysis of studies evaluating the use of 18 F-FDG PET/CT in the evaluation of possible IE to establish a more precise estimate of diagnostic accuracy.
Methods
Literature Search
PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library, CINAHL, Web of Knowledge, and www.clinicaltrials.gov were searched from January 1, 1990 to April 30, 2017 for studies evaluating the use of PET/CT for diagnosis of possible IE. The search strategy used a combination of search terms (e.g., “endocarditis,” “valve infection,” “valvular infection,” “valvular endocarditis,” “heart valve infection,” “positron-emission tomography,” “radionuclide imaging,” “PET”) as controlled vocabulary and keywords modified for the individual databases (detailed search strategy appears in appendix 1 of the supplement). Further pertinent studies were found via manual inspection of references of pertinent papers. To make our search as comprehensive as possible and include “gray literature” sources, we also included conference proceedings. If required, we attempted to contact corresponding authors for unpublished data. No language constraints were applied to the search. Search results were screened independently by 2 reviewers (MM and SF) based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria; discrepancies were resolved by a third reviewer (SA).
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
Studies were included if they assessed the diagnostic accuracy of PET/CT in the diagnosis of possible IE; provided detailed criteria of a reference standard for diagnosis of IE, and provided sufficient data to determine sensitivity and specificity of PET-CT. Studies were excluded if they were case reports, case series, animal studies, pediatric studies, duplicate reports, or if insufficient data were provided to calculate sensitivity and specificity values. The index test was PET/CT.
Data Extraction
Data were abstracted from the included studies using a standard form which included first author, publication year, geographical region, single-center or multicenter study, sample size, reference standard, PET/CT methods and analysis, PET-CT results, echocardiogram results, and blood and device culture results. The quality of each study was evaluated according to the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies 2 (QUADAS-2) tool by 2 independent investigators (MM and SA); any discrepancies were resolved by consensus after discussion. Review Manager Software (version 5.3, the Cochrane Collaboration) and Stata Metan package (Stata Statistical Software, Release 13; StataCorp LP, College Station, TX) were used to generate a graphical summary of the quality assessment. Accuracy of the data was verified by 2 independent reviewers (MM and SA), and any discrepancies in data extraction or quality assessment were resolved by consensus discussion with a third reviewer (SF).
Statistical Analysis
Accuracy data (true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative) were extracted from each study to calculate estimates of pooled sensitivity and specificity weighted based on the study population size. To calculate the overall performance of the diagnostic accuracy of PET/CT, summary receiver operating curve (SROC) and area under the curve (AUC) analysis were done. Heterogeneity was evaluated with the Cochrane Q test and I 2 test. Possible sources of heterogeneity were further explored by subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses. Threshold effect was assessed with the Spearman correlation. Meta-DiSc 1.4 software (Clinical Biostatistics Unit, Ramon y Cajal Hospital, Madrid, Spain) and Stata Metan package (Stata Statistical Software, Release 13; StataCorp LP, College Station, TX) were used to perform statistical analysis.
Results
A total of 529 articles were identified through the electronic database search; 388 articles remained after removal of duplicate records. After screening of the title and abstract, 49 full text articles were reviewed. Following full text screen, 13 studies involving 537 patients were included in the meta-analysis (Figure 1 ).

The most common organisms from blood cultures were Staphylococcus aureus ( N = 38), coagulase-negative S taphylococcus ( N = 27), Streptococcus species ( N = 26), and Enterococcus species ( N = 21). Most (138/184, 75%) patients received antibiotic therapy prior to PET/CT with median duration of antibiotic therapy prior to imaging ranging from 4 to 20 days. Findings of metastatic infection were found in 17% ( N = 34/198), with the most common reported sites being spinal vertebrae ( N = 12), spleen ( N = 11), and extremities ( N = 5). , – Two studies described the detection of malignancy or other sources of infection; these included colon cancer ( N = 2), pneumonia ( N = 5), and prostatitis ( N = 3). ,
Diagnostic Accuracy of PET-CT
The pooled sensitivity of PET/CT for diagnosis of IE was 76.8% (95% CI 71.8–81.4%; Q = 39.9, P < 0.01; I 2 = 69.9%) and the pooled specificity was 77.9% (95% CI 71.9–83.2%; Q = 44.42, P < 0.01; I 2 = 73.0%) (Figure 2 ). Summary receiver operating characteristic curve (SROC) analysis demonstrated moderate overall accuracy with an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.86 and Q * 0.79 (Figure 3 ). Figure 2 Pooled sensitivity and specificity of 18F-FDG PET/CT in evaluation of IE Figure 3 SROC curve of pooled sensitivity and specificity of 18F-FDG PET/CT in evaluation of IE
A sensitivity analysis of 8 studies involving only prosthetic valve endocarditis demonstrated pooled sensitivity of 80.5% (95% CI 74.1–86.0%; Q = 25.5, P < 0.01; I 2 = 72.5%) and specificity of 73.1% (95% CI 63.8–81.2%; Q = 32.1, P < 0.01; I 2 = 78.2%), with AUC of 0.88 and Q * of 0.81 on SROC analysis.
More recent studies published from 2015 to 2017 reported a higher pooled sensitivity of 81.3% (95% CI 74.3–87.0%; Q = 26.53, P < 0.01; I 2 = 77.4%) and specificity of 79.0% (95% CI 71.2–85.5%; Q = 40.88, P < 0.01; I 2 = 85.3%). Comparison studies published prior to 2015 reported sensitivity of 72.3% (95% CI 64.5–79.1%; Q = 9.81, P = 0.08; I 2 = 49.1%) and specificity of 76.2% (95% CI 65.7–84.8%; Q = 3.30, P = 0.65; I 2 = 0.0%). More of the recent studies published from 2015 to 2017 were prospective , , , and described using a low-carbohydrate, fat-allowed diet for at least 24 hours prior to imaging. , , , In addition, more of the recent studies described using a prolonged fast prior to imaging and used an intravenous heparin bolus prior to FDG administration. , ,
Additional sensitivity analysis of 9 studies that included a myocardial suppression protocol as part of the PET/CT methodology demonstrated a sensitivity of 76.7% (95% CI 70.9–81.9%; Q = 33.59, P < 0.01; I 2 = 76.2%) and specificity of 78.3% (95% CI 71.4–84.2%; Q = 42.39, P < 0.01; I 2 = 81.1%).
There was no significant difference in diagnostic accuracy among studies that blinded interpreting physicians. Overall, 6 of the 13 studies blinded clinical information from physicians interpreting PET/CT; in this group, sensitivity was 70.9% (95% CI 62.9–78.1%; Q = 8.57, P = 0.128; I 2 = 41.7%) and specificity was 85.3% (95% CI 77.6–91.2%; Q = 11.23, P = 0.04; I 2 = 55.5%). In comparison, the 7 studies that did not blind interpreting physicians had a sensitivity 80.9% (95% CI 73.8–86.8%; Q = 24.64, P < 0.01; I 2 = 75.6%) and specificity of 69.9% (95% CI 59.5–79.0%; Q = 28.51, P < 0.01; I 2 = 79.0%).
Threshold Effect and Heterogeneity
Visual inspection of forest plots and SROC curves, as well as Spearman’s correlation of 0.318 ( P = 0.289) suggested the presence of a threshold effect to some extent. The I 2 values and Cochran Q values of the pooled sensitivity and specificity also suggested the presence of heterogeneity between studies. Sensitivity analysis through omission of single studies demonstrated somewhat less heterogeneity with exclusion of Jimenez-Ballve ; pooled sensitivity was 73% (95% CI 67–78%; Q = 23.83, P = 0.013; I 2 = 53.8%) and specificity of 82% (95% CI 75–87%; Q = 13.64, P = 0.254; I 2 = 19.4%). The characteristics of included patients, methods, definition of infection, and described image interpretation in this study were not substantially different from the other included studies. It is possible that the heterogeneity noted in these results reflects threshold effect, a primary concern when pooling diagnostic test accuracy studies in a meta-analysis. Threshold effect occurs when different cut-off values are used to define a positive test result in different studies, affecting the reported sensitivity and specificity of the test. Interpretation of PET/CT involves assessing the degree and distribution of FDG uptake. As there are no specific diagnostic criteria for interpretation of PET/CT in the evaluation of endocarditis, it is possible that variability in interpreting PET/CT is contributing to heterogeneity. In addition, many studies did not blind radiologists to the clinical scenario, which may have affected the interpretation of the PET/CT findings. There is also a possibility of partial verification bias as the clinical providers were aware of the PET/CT results, which may have influenced their clinical decision making. Further potential sources of heterogeneity include the different settings or different variety of patients in the included studies. Meta-regression analyses demonstrated publication bias (Figure 4 ) without other significant findings. Figure 4 Deeks funnel plot—publication bias
Quality of Evidence
The QUADAS-2 summary plot (Figure 5 ) demonstrates the overall adequacy of the methodological quality of the included studies. Risk of bias was related to the lack of random sequence generation, and lack of blinding for imaging technique or outcome assessment in the majority of studies. Additionally the absence of a gold standard for diagnosis of IE was a consistent concern across all studies. Figure 5 Summary of quality assessment of individual studies
Discussion
In this meta-analysis of 13 studies involving 537 patients, PET/CT had a moderate sensitivity of 76.0% and specificity of 78.5% for the diagnosis of IE. In the evaluation of patients with suspected prosthetic valve endocarditis, the sensitivity improved to 80.5%. These data suggest that PET/CT has the potential for use as an adjunctive diagnostic modality in challenging cases of possible IE. The rapid turnaround time of around 2 hours combined with an excellent spatial resolution allows for precise definition of valvular infection and associated complications. It can provide information on the extent of cardiac infection, potentially before substantial damage to heart valves occurs, and detect indications for surgical intervention such as cardiac abscess or paravalvular extension of infection.
Whole body PET/CT is also a rapid means of assessing sites of extracardiac infection including clinically unsuspected distant foci, guiding more appropriate and timely intervention, as well as duration of antibiotic therapy. – Use of whole body PET/CT lead to treatment modification in up to 35% of patients with IE in one study and was associated with a lower risk of relapse of infection in another investigation. Use of PET/CT in the evaluation of gram positive bacteremia has reduced morbidity and mortality, as well as being cost effective. Moreover, PET/CT can detect alternative sources of infection or inflammation, avoiding unnecessary antibiotic therapy or surgical intervention for presumed IE.
Certain factors, such as prior antimicrobial therapy, small vegetation size, and elevated blood glucose may impact the sensitivity and specificity of PET/CT. False negative findings have been reported with prior administration of antimicrobial therapy. , In addition, it can be challenging to detect FDG uptake in small vegetations, below the spatial resolution of PET (less than 4–5 mm), particularly when there is high FDG uptake in the surrounding myocardium. Imaging performed shortly after cardiac procedures, such as valve replacement surgery or cardiac device implantation, can also be challenging to interpret, as some degree of inflammation will be present at cardiac prostheses or devices for weeks to months following a procedure. , Protocols to suppress physiologic myocardial FDG utilization have improved detection of cardiac foci of infection and inflammation. These myocardial suppression protocols include patient preparation with the use of a low-carbohydrate and fat-permissive diet, fasting for at least 6 hours, and use of heparin prior to imaging. Prolonged fasting and low-carbohydrate, high-fat diets lead to decreased blood glucose and insulin levels, and increased free fatty acid levels. These methods all lead to a relative decrease in myocardial glucose utilization and improved image quality. Heparin induces lipolysis and leads to an increase in free fatty acid levels; however, its utility in suppressing physiologic myocardial activity in clinical settings remains unclear. , Our findings indicate higher pooled sensitivity of 81.3% and specificity of 79.0% in studies published after 2015; these studies were more likely to include myocardial suppression methods such as prolonged fasting, administration of heparin, and use of a low-carbohydrate, fat-allowed diet. Our institution utilizes a PET/CT protocol that avoids physiologic myocardial uptake in the heart by using a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet for 24 hours prior to imaging, fasting for at least 6 hours before imaging and a blood glucose level of less than 200 mg/dL immediately prior to imaging.
Use of CT angiography for the cardiac portion, instead of routine CT, may also improve diagnostic accuracy, particularly in prosthetic valve endocarditis. , , Motion compensation methods, such as cardiac and respiratory gating, may also improve spatial resolution and diagnostic accuracy in the evaluation of small cardiac vegetations; however, these methods have not been adequately validated in the diagnosis of IE.
A previous meta-analysis on this topic included 6 studies with 246 patients with reported sensitivity of 61% and specificity of 88%. The methodology of this previous study does not elaborate specific inclusion and exclusion criteria; however it included fewer studies and patients than our meta-analysis. We believe our findings to be more accurate given our comprehensive search strategy and inclusion of more studies.
Limitations
Our results suggest that there is a moderate amount of heterogeneity between studies, which likely impacted on the pooled estimates of diagnostic accuracy. Imaging protocols, data acquisition processes, blinding of interpreting providers, and blinding of PET results to clinical providers were not consistent across studies, all of which may have contributed to heterogeneity. A threshold effect was also noted in our results which may have been due to non-blinded interpretation of images and the semi-qualitative nature of PET/CT. In this meta-analysis, 6 of the 13 included studies involved non-blinded interpretation of PET/CT, and only 1 of them included studies that blinded clinical providers to PET/CT results which may have influenced their clinical decision making. As there are no validated diagnostic criteria for the interpretation of PET/CT for IE, a combination of qualitative values such as the pattern and intensity of FDG uptake, as well as semi-quantitative values such as SUVmean, SUVmax, and SQR is utilized by interpreting providers. There are as yet insufficient data to establish a cut-off value for SUV or SQR that would confidently differentiate infection from inflammation. It is also unclear whether the sensitivity of PET/CT differs based on the pathogen; its utility in gram positive bacteremia has been demonstrated, however, it is unclear whether it will consistently have the same utility in the evaluation of more indolent pathogens. ,
Further uncertainty exists due to the impact of prior antibiotic treatment on the sensitivity of PET/CT for diagnosing IE. Timing and duration of prior antimicrobial therapy can affect the microbial burden at the infection site and reduce inflammatory response, leading to false negative PET/CT results. It is also unclear whether this can be a useful modality for monitoring response to therapy, particularly in challenging cases involving prosthetic valves and vascular graft material. Many of the included studies are small, single-center, retrospective series limiting their applicability to a broader setting. Larger, well-designed prospective studies, where the methodology involves consistent attempts at suppression of physiologic myocardial activity, are needed to define the role of PET/CT in the diagnosis of IE. Finally, our analysis also suggests the presence of publication bias where negative studies may not have been published.
Conclusion
Our findings support the utility of PET/CT as an adjunctive diagnostic tool in the evaluation of challenging cases of IE, particularly in patients with suspected prosthetic valve endocarditis. PET/CT has the potential to detect IE before structural cardiac damage occurs and can detect clinically relevant extracardiac foci of infection leading to more appropriate management interventions.
