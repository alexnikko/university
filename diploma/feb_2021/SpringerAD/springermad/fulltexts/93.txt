Introduction
Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) is an established non-invasive imaging modality with a key role in the diagnostic and prognostic work-up of patients with or at risk for coronary artery disease (CAD), also providing important insights for decision-making and to guide revascularization. , , , Most studies on MPI have however included relatively younger patients. , ,
Given the ever increasing age of patients in developed countries and the need to accurately diagnose and risk-stratify CAD especially in the elderly, it is pivotal to clarify the role of MPI in them. Several studies have already focused on the diagnostic or prognostic accuracy of MPI in the elderly, but they were typically limited by inclusion of relatively younger patients, small sample, focus only on diagnosis vs prognosis, or reliance on potentially obsolete methods for testing or analysis. , , , , , , , , , , ,
In order to provide a comprehensive, contemporary, and state-of-the art appraisal of the prognostic accuracy of MPI in octogenarians, we focused on this key issue exploiting our extensive institutional dataset.
Methods
This work was a retrospective analysis of our institutional database, which collects data from the busiest Italian MPI practice (OPCcardiopro, Etisan, Rome, Italy). Details on the dataset, our procedural, imaging methods, informed consent, and ethics committee approval have been provided elsewhere. , , ,
Briefly, patients undergoing MPI since 2004 were identified, excluding those aged < 18 years, recent revascularization (< 6 months before), or scintigraphic evidence of myocardial necrosis. Symptom-limited dynamic stress testing was performed on a bicycle ergometer according to a standard protocol. Subjects unable to exercise underwent pharmacologic stress testing with dipyridamole. 201 Tl (IBA Molecular Italy, Monza, Italy) and 99m Tc-methoxyisobutylisonitrile (Stamicis, IBA Molecular Italy) were used for peak and rest single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) according to standard protocols. A dual-head gamma camera (Millennium MG or Millennium MyoSIGHT, GE Healthcare, Milan, Italy), equipped with a low-energy, general-purpose collimator, was used. Seven regions were graphically obtained to quantify the degree of myocardial perfusion, stemming from the established yet more fragmented segmentation approaches, as follows: 1-apical, 2-antero-medio-distal, 3-antero-proximal, 4-septal, 5-postero-lateral, 6-lateral (which corresponds to the anatomic variability in coronary dominance), and 7-inferior (Figure 1S). Thereby, semiquantitative interpretation of stress/rest images was performed based on the above 7-region model by consensus of 2 experienced observers using both visual assessment of the color-coded tomographic images for the 3 axes and the standard deviation (SD) polar map of detectable tracer uptake, finally obtaining for each region a 5-point scoring system (Maximal Ischemia Score [MIS]). Finally, location and extent of vessel-related ischemia (VRI) at MPS were categorized as follows: VRI involving the left anterior descending (LAD) when the apical, antero-medio-distal, or antero-proximal regions were ischemic; VRI involving the left circumflex (LCX) territory when the postero-lateral or lateral regions were ischemic; and VRI involving the right coronary artery (RCA) when only the inferior region or both the lateral and inferior regions were ischemic.

P < 0.001 in both groups
Details on CAD were appraised using reports and angiographic images from invasive coronary angiography, performed at the referring physician’s discretion after MPI. A coronary lesion was deemed angiographically significant if yielding a diameter stenosis ≥ 70% (50% for unprotected left main). Clinical follow-up was systematically collected after the index MPI, by direct patient visit or phone contact. In case an adverse event was elicited, hard copies of the source documents (e.g., hospitalization records) were retrieved to enable event adjudication and minimize information bias. The primary outcome was the long-term (≥ 1 year) rate of death or myocardial infarction comparing those < 80 vs ≥ 80 years old. In addition, we adjudicated rates of death, cardiac death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), any revascularization, and cardiac death or myocardial infarction.
Continuous variables are reported as mean ± standard deviation. Categorical variables are reported as n (%). Bivariate analyses were performed using unpaired Student t-test for continuous variables, Fisher test for categorical variables, and Cox proportional hazard analysis for censored data (reporting hazard ratios [HR] with 95% confidence intervals). Survival curves were generated with the Kaplan-Meier method. In addition, for descriptive purposes, we appraised diagnostic accuracy of MPI in comparison to invasive coronary angiography computing sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating curve (ROC). Interaction testing was then performed to compare diagnostic and prognostic accuracy of MPI in patients < 80 vs ≥ 80 years old using the Z-test. In order to adjust for potential confounders, we then computed propensity scores and performed 1:1 matching, rerunning all analyses for diagnostic and prognostic accuracy in propensity-matched patients. Statistical significance was set at the 2-tailed 0.05, without multiplicity adjustment. Computations were performed with Stata 13 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).
Results
From a total of 13,254, we identified 12,737 (96.1%) patients < 80 years old and 517 (3.9%) ≥ 80 years old (Table 1 ). Several significant differences in baseline and procedural features were evident. Specifically, octogenarians had a higher prevalence of women, and a lower prevalence of family history of CAD, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertriglyceridemia (all P < 0.05). In addition, octogenarians were less likely to undergo exercise stress, and achieved lower peak workload, heart rate, and rate pressure product, reporting less commonly chest pain during stress (all P < 0.05). Maximal ischemia score was significantly worse in octogenarians, with moderate ischemia in 22.1% vs 13.1% and severe ischemia in 10.8% vs 6.2% ( P < 0.001). Accordingly, octogenarians had more extensive ischemia, with single-VRI involving LAD in 10.4% vs 5.5%, and multi-VRI involving LAD in 7.7% vs 3.1% ( P < 0.001).

Angiographic and outcome details are reported in Table 2 . Specifically, invasive coronary angiography was performed in 2338 patients after MPI, thus in 2269 (17.8%) subjects < 80 vs 69 (13.4%) ≥ 80 years old ( P = 0.008), highlighting a higher prevalence of diffuse CAD in octogenarians (e.g., three-vessel disease in 34.8% vs 30.7%, P = 0.012). Clinical outcomes were appraised 32.1 ± 21.0 months after MPI. Notably, octogenarians showed a higher incidence of death (9.1% vs 1.4%, P < 0.001), cardiac death (5.8% vs 0.8%, P < 0.001), death or myocardial infarction (11.0% vs 2.6%, P < 0.001), and death, myocardial infarction, or revascularization (27.5% vs 20.1%, P < 0.001).

Appraisal of diagnostic accuracy highlighted similar sensitivity, specificity, DOR, and AUC of MPI in octogenarians in comparison to younger patients (Table 3 ). For instance, the sensitivity of MPI in octogenarians for any CAD was 87.0% vs 87.9%, for two- or three-vessel disease 91.7% vs 89.5%, and for proximal LAD disease 88.5% vs 88.4%. The prognostic role of MPI was similar or higher in octogenarians for death (HR = 10.86 vs 2.72), myocardial infarction (1.06 vs 1.24), or their combination (4.93 vs 1.87, P = 0.046), whereas it was, while still significant, non-significantly lower for revascularization (3.71 vs 6.96, P = 0.068) (Table 4 ). This was confirmed by comparison of Kaplan-Meier curves for death or myocardial infarction (Figure 1 ).

An exploratory analysis distinguishing patients in four age groups (< 50 years vs 50 to 64 years vs 65 to 79 years vs ≥ 80 years) confirmed and expanded the above findings (Table 3S). Specifically, increasing age was significantly and progressively associated with an increased risk of death, cardiac death, the composite of death or myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass grafting, any revascularization, and the composite of death, myocardial infarction, or revascularization (all P < 0.001). Advanced age proved a significant predictor of adverse events with a consistent effect in patients with and without left ventricular systolic dysfunction (Table 4S). Similarly, no significant interaction was found between stress type and diagnostic accuracy features (Table 5S).
Propensity-matched analyses for diagnostic and prognostic accuracy, provided in Tables 1S and 2S, confirmed that MPI had similar or better diagnostic and prognostic features in octogenarians than in younger patients. Extensive multivariable analysis further corroborated the independent predictive role of age, highlighting that most of the incremental risk is due indeed to very elderly patients (Table 6S).
Discussion
The management of CAD has seen momentous changes in the last decades, and now it is possible to predict, diagnose, and treat CAD with substantial success rates. These favorable results have paradoxically increased the prevalence of CAD, as an aging population has lead to more patients at risk of developing or facing the complications of CAD. The key question in such scenario remains the appropriate care of such elderly subjects with or at risk of CAD.
Non-invasive testing is crucial to diagnose and risk-stratify CAD in the overall population, and represent a useful tool also in less younger patients. There is ongoing debate though on the most appropriate diagnostic and prognostic approach to old subjects, such as octogenarians. In this work, we aimed to compare the prognostic accuracy of an established non-invasive imaging modality such as MPI in elderly vs non-elderly patients. First, we confirmed that elderly patients had a six-fold higher risk of death in comparison to non-elderly patients (9.1% vs 1.4%, P < 0.001) as well as a four-fold higher risk of death or myocardial infarction (11.0% vs 2.6%, P < 0.001). Most importantly, we found that MPI has similar prognostic accuracy in octogenarians and in younger patients. Notably, propensity-adjusted analysis confirmed the overall analysis and actually suggested greater prognostic accuracy for the risk of death or myocardial infarction. Accordingly, our work supports the use of MPI for the prognostication of CAD in octogenarians.
Other studies have appraised the role of non-invasive imaging tests in elderly patients with or at risk of CAD. The pivotal contribution of Hachamovitch et al., included 5200 patients ≥ 75 years of age, followed for a mean of 2.8 ± 1.7 years. They found that MPI could aptly differentiate patients with a very low risk of adverse events during follow-up, whilst also highlighting the potential beneficial effects of early coronary revascularization in subjects with evidence of myocardial ischemia at MPI. This finding is indeed in keeping with our own and similar others, , , , , , which highlight the robust prognostic accuracy of MPI in patients undergoing non-invasive work-up of CAD. In particular, the landmark study by Nair and colleagues, including 1093 very elderly (≥ 80 years) subjects, 3369 elderly (65 to 79 years) ones, and 4402 middle-aged (50 to 64 years) persons, has shown that summed stress scores obtained at MPI were significantly and independently associated with an increased risk of cardiac death and myocardial infarction. Intriguingly, the addition of MPI results provided incremental prognostic value to clinical and stress details. The major differences between our own work and the previous one rest on its contemporary stance, the exploitation of a novel and clinically succinct segmentation model for MPI analysis, the concomitant appraisal of diagnostic and prognostic accuracy, and the simultaneous use of traditional multivariable analysis and propensity matching for statistical inference.
The relationship between angiographic CAD and abnormal MPI is not an obvious one, even if the main reason to perform MPI even in elderly subjects is to identify CAD amenable to revascularization. The diagnostic accuracy of MPI is clinically relevant, even if there is complex balance between the diagnostic threshold to define an abnormal MPI and ensuing sensitivity and specificity, as highlighted also in 322 relatively elderly subjects (72 ± 7 years) by Canepa and colleagues.
Notably, our population of patients highlights different competing patterns of CAD and corresponding adverse events in younger vs older patients. Younger patients had less extensive and severe CAD, and a more stable clinical status after MPI. Conversely, octogenarians had more extensive and severe CAD, faced more adverse clinical events during follow-up, and were less likely to receive coronary artery bypass grafting, whose incremental benefit over percutaneous coronary intervention in complex CAD has been clearly established. ,
A poignant issue has been the relative safety of stress testing in elderly subjects. Despite obvious differences in exercise tolerance and a greater likelihood of atrioventricular block with adenosine, Hashimoto and colleagues have shown in a study including as many as 616 patients ≥ 75 years of age that both exercise and pharmacologic stress for MPI were remarkably safe.
This work has several limitations, mainly due to the retrospective single-center setting, and the inherent selection and performance bias. In addition, the sample size of elderly patients who also underwent coronary angiography was limited and did not include any subject without CAD, thus limiting the scope of diagnostic accuracy analyses. This particularly impacted on specificity estimates, whose figures should be mainly viewed as exploratory. In addition, our focus on octogenarians may be at odds with other prior works focusing on elderly patients, which used different and potentially spurious cut-offs (e.g., 65 years of age in Roest et al and 75 years of age in Hachamovitch and colleagues). , Finally, the increased risk of death in the elderly could be simply due to their advanced age, thus posing a tautology threat.
In conclusion, use of MPI in octogenarians is associated with similar or better prognostic accuracy than in younger subjects, thus confirming the pivotal role of this non-invasive imaging modality in this patient subgroup.
