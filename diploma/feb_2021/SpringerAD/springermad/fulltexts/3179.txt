Introduction
Meloxicam is a potent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) belonging to the selective cyclo-oxygenase II (COX-2) inhibitors with the advantage of being more safe on the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) [ ]. The drug is effectively used for treatment of arthritis and osteo-arthritis; however, it has poor solubility in water [ ]. Meloxicam is classified according to the biopharmaceutics classification system as class II (poorly soluble and highly permeable), and the drug has high melting point and undergoes excessive degradation when admixed with excipients using fusion techniques such as hot melt extrusion [ ]. Solid dispersion (SD) of meloxicam was applied with many hydrophilic excipients such as polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyethylene glycol, skimmed milk, and poloxamers [ , , , , ] to enhance its dissolution properties. New techniques producing nanoparticles and nanocrystals such as solvent assisted co-grinding with polymeric solubilizers were also tried to enhance dissolution properties of meloxicam [ ]. Chitosan microparticles were also used for enhancing the drug properties and correlate the in vitro/in vivo data to its BCS classification [ ]. Amorphization of insoluble drug molecules using polymeric amorphous SD resulting in glass solutions with enhanced dissolution has been used extensively as reported in the literature [ ]. However, large bulk volumes of polymers are often needed for complete miscibility and stabilization of the drug into the resulting amorphous glass solutions [ , , ]. These systems often have hygroscopic nature which promotes phase separation and recrystallization of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) [ , ]. Binary amorphous SD composed of two low molecular weight components such as a drug with poor water solubility and highly soluble small molecules such as saccharin, nicotinamide, citric acid, and sugars are better alternatives to drug-polymer SD [ , , , ]. Stable amorphous SD system composed of pharmacologically related drugs through molecular interaction such as H-bonding or ionic interaction is a recent approach. These new systems have many advantages such as synergism of action in addition to the synchronized/enhanced solubility and dissolution rate [ ]. Numerous binary combinations such as indomethacin-naproxen [ ] and indomethacin-cimetidine [ ] with electron donor and acceptor sites in their chemical structures were successfully used for formation of amorphous SD. Paracetamol has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. It also has high solubility in water and low permeability therefore classified as a BCS class III drug [ ]. The presence of the free OH and the amide group makes it ideal for possible formation of SD through H-bonding interactions with similar drugs with electron donor or acceptor groups. The aim of this work included the improvement of meloxicam solubility and maximizing its pharmacological activity by forming binary solid dispersions with paracetamol.
Materials and Methods
Materials
Meloxicam was obtained as a gift from Heliopolis Chemicals Company, Egypt. Paracetamol was gifted from Al-Hikma pharmaceutical Company, Jordan. HPLC grade solvents (methanol and acetonitrile) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich, UK. Ethanol (96%) and acetone were purchased from Himedia laboratories (Mumbai, India).
Preparation of Meloxicam-Paracetamol Binary SD
Binary SD of meloxicam and paracetamol were prepared according to a previously reported method with modification [ ]. The weighed amounts of each drug according to the molar or mass ratios (see Table 1 ) were dissolved together in (20–30 mL) of the selected solvent (ethanol, water, acetone, or their binary mixtures of 70:30% v / v ) and sonicated for 10–20 min using ultra-probe sonication Model Sonifier 450/102C (Branson, Mexico). The mixtures were then subjected to fast drying either by hot evaporation using rotary evaporation model R-210/V700/B491 (Buchi, Switzerland) under vacuum at 45 °C or freeze drying (lyophilization) using Christ Alpha 2-4 LD plus, freeze dryer, Osterode, Germany). The dried SD were then collected and stored in desiccators until further characterization. Chemical structures of meloxicam and paracetamol are shown in Fig. 1 .

Scanning Electron Microscopy
The morphology of the prepared SD was examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Analytical Scanning Microscope, JEOL-JSM-6510LA, JEOL, Japan). Few specks from each formulation were placed on the carbon stubs and then coated using a gold sputter (SPI-Module Sputter Coater, SPI Supplies Inc., USA) followed by microscopical scanning.
Differential Scanning Calorimetry
Samples of pure meloxicam, paracetamol, and their physical mixtures (1:1) and the prepared co-amorphous SD formulations (5 mg each) were individually filled into aluminum flat bottomed pans and heated using a simultaneous thermogravimetric-differential scanning calorimeter model STA 449 F3 Jupiter (Netzsch, Germany) in an atmosphere of nitrogen. The heating temperature used for the crystalline components was set between 20 and 300 °C with a heating rate 10 °C min −1 .
Fourier Transform Infrared Analysis
Small samples (2–3 mg) of meloxicam, paracetamol, their physical mixtures (1:1) and prepared SD were individually mixed with 500 mg dry potassium bromide. The powder mixtures were compressed into discs under a pressure of 68.5–103.4 MPa using a hydrostatic press. The infrared spectrum was determined at a scanning range of 400–4000 cm −1 using a Fourier transform infrared instrument (IR Prestige-21, Shimadzu, Japan).
X-ray Powder Diffraction
Samples of meloxicam powder, paracetamol, their physical mixtures (1:1) as well as the SD formulations were subject to X-ray diffraction analysis. A Shimadzu XRD-6000 X-ray powder diffractometer (Shimadzu, Japan) coupled with a standard Cu sealed X-ray tube with voltage, current (40 kV and 40 mA), was used to characterize the amorphous or crystalline state of formulations [ ]. Data collection was performed at 2- theta of 5–60° in steps of 0.04 and scanning speed of 0.4° per step. Any change in the crystalline pattern of the prepared co-amorphous SD compared to those of the parent crystalline components was recorded and percentage crystallinity was calculated.
Drug Content and Saturation Solubility of the Prepared Solid Dispersion
Samples of the prepared amorphous SD equivalent to 5 mg meloxicam and calculated amounts of paracetamol according to ratios presented in Table 1 were dissolved in methanol and adjusted to volume using a standard 50-mL volumetric flask. Then, 2 mL were taken and diluted to 10 mL with mobile phase composed of methanol: water: acetic acid (55:40:5 v / v ). Drug content was then determined using a photodiode array automated HPLC analysis method [ ] with a HPLC Shimadzu apparatus (model DGU-20A3/LC-20AT/SIL-20A/CTO-20A/SPD-M20A, Shimadzu, Japan).
For saturation solubility, excess amounts of the prepared SD formulations and meloxicam were separately placed into 2-mL Eppendorf tubes and dispersed into 1000 μL distilled water. The SD systems were then placed on an orbital shaker model SSM (Stuart, UK) operated at a rate of 300 cycles per min. The process was continued for 1 week, the Eppendorf tubes were centrifuged at 14000 rpm, and 10 μL sample of supernatant was taken and diluted to 10 mL with methanol. The diluted sample solutions ( n = 3) were measured by HPLC analysis [ ].
Preparation of Meloxicam-Paracetamol Oral Tablets
In a porcelain mortar, a pre-weighed amount (79.50 mg) of the selected SD mixture (equivalent to 15 mg meloxicam and 64.50 mg paracetamol), 150 mg Avicel PH 102, and 10% sodium starch glycolate (as disintegrant) were added and mixed for about 10 min. For comparison, meloxicam (15 mg) and paracetamol (64.50 mg) were physically mixed with the same amounts of Avicel PH 102 and sodium starch glycolate. The prepared tablet formula mixtures were directly compressed on a 10-mm flat punch/die set using a manual single punch tableting machine (Erweka, Heusenstamm, Germany) after addition of 1% magnesium stearate (as lubricant). A batch of 50 tablets of each formula was prepared.
Pharmaceutical Characterization of the Prepared Tablets
The prepared tablet formulations were characterized for their hardness, friability, weight variation, drug content, and disintegration time according to the standardized pharmacopeia requirements.
In Vitro Dissolution Studies
The dissolution studies were carried out using isocratic RP-HPLC method for simultaneous determination of meloxicam and paracetamol as published previously with some modifications [ ]. Dissolution was conducted on the prepared SD tablets in comparison to physical mixture tablets and the generic marketed tablets of meloxicam (15 mg) and paracetamol (500 mg) using a full automated dissolution apparatus II (UDT-804 paddle dissolution apparatus, Logan, USA) in 900 mL phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) as dissolution medium at 50 rpm, the temperature was kept at 37 ± 0.5 °C. Samples were analyzed using RP-HPLC (Prominence HPLC, System Controller CBM-20A, Autosampler LC 20A, Sil 20A, UV–vis detector SPD-20A, Shimadzu, Japan). HPLC system was isocratic with a sample injection volume of 20 μl. The HPLC column was C18; 25 cm × 4.6 mm i.d, 5-μm particle. The mobile phase was a ternary mixture of ethyl acetate to methanol to water (2.5: 70: 28.5 v / v ) and pH was adjusted to 4.0 with acetic acid. The wavelength of detection was set at 234 nm. The flow rate was 1.0 ml/min. The temperature of measurement was at 25 °C [ ].
Comparative Pharmacological Evaluation
The SD mixture showing the highest solubility and dissolution rate was selected and subjected to further pharmacological study. Eddy’s hot plate technique [ ] was applied to test for the analgesic effect in mice ( n = 6) using UGO Basile Model 35,100 Hot/Cold plate (Comerio VA, Italy). The time at which the mouse starts licking the forepaws was noted. The anti-inflammatory effect was also investigated by measuring the changes in tail volume of induced edema [ ] using a plethysmometer Model 7140 (Comerio VA, Italy) 1 h after injecting each mouse with 0.3 mL of carrageenan solution (1%) in the tail. The plethysmometer was calibrated via dipping 0.1 ml calibrated volume in the volumetric flask before doing any measurement. Three groups of mice each composed of six representing a control group (received only water by oral route), test group-1 (received SD of the two reference drugs in water) and the test group-2 (received a SD of the selected solid formula in water).
Statistical Treatment
One-way ANOVA test was used for comparison using SPSS software. The difference was considered statistically significant when the probability value ( p value) was less than 0.05.
Results and Discussion
SEM Morphology
The obtained scanning electron micrographs for paracetamol-meloxicam physical mixture and their solid selected SD (F4) showed that the tabular appearance of the monoclinic crystals (larger particles) of paracetamol [ ] and the irregular shaped small meloxicam crystals (Fig. 2 a) was changed into large aggregates or sheets indicating the formation of a new SD (Fig. 2 b).

Solid State Characterization
Differential Scanning Calorimetry Thermograms
Differential scanning calorimetric thermograms of meloxicam, paracetamol, the physical mixture (1:1), and the prepared SD are shown in Figs. 3 and 4 and Table 2 . Meloxicam showed a characteristic sharp melting endothermic peak at 264.7 °C while paracetamol demonstrated its melting endotherm at 175.5 °C which were found to be comparable to the melting values reported in the literature [ , ]. The physical mixture of the two components at 1:1 weight ratio demonstrated a sharp peak at 169.3 °C representing paracetamol and a broad shifted peak at 269.7 °C representing meloxicam which may suggest interaction between meloxicam and paracetamol during sample heating. In Fig. 3 , the thermograms of the prepared SD prepared by freeze drying F2 (1:20 weight ratio), hot evaporation (F1 and F3) showed similar thermal behavior. A shift of paracetamol melting peak to a lower temperature (4–5 °C lower) and the disappearance of sharp melting of meloxicam were observed demonstrating a slightly different melting behavior compared to that of the physical mixture. In Fig. 4 , the SD F4 (1:10 M ratio) prepared by freeze drying also showed single sharp peaks at 166.2 °C (9 °C lower than that of paracetamol). The characteristic peak of meloxicam was not detected and instead a broad and shallow endotherm appeared at 277 °C. Since in the physical mixture crystalline paracetamol melted first during differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements followed by meloxicam based on the differences in melting points, meloxicam could have undergone complete interactions and dissolution into the melted paracetamol during DSC run, and thus, it could not be easy to detect the initial amorphization of meloxicam via this technique [ ]. SD prepared (F1–F7) showed different thermal behavior where melting events were observed at lower melting temperatures (Figs. 3 and 4 ). This behavior may suggest more interactions in SD compared to that of physical mixture leading probably to the formation of new polymorphic structures.

Fourier Transform Infrared Analysis Spectra
In the IR spectrum of meloxicam (Fig. 5 a), it appears that a characteristic peak of O–H stretching was noticed at 3291 cm −1 which could be augmented by the N–H and C–H stretching vibration bands [ ]. A characteristic band at 2900 cm −1 was also noticed for the CONH group [ ]. A band of C=O stretching appeared at 1619 cm −1 and a C=C stretching vibrations was also noticed between 1620 and 1420 cm −1 , C–N stretching band at 1550 cm −1 and finally the S=O stretching at 1176 cm −1 [ ]. The IR spectrum of paracetamol shown in Fig. 5 a indicated the characteristics peaks of N–H stretching at 3329 cm −1 and C=O stretching vibrations at 1650 cm −1 for the amidic group [ ]. It was also characterized by the C–N amide stretching peak at 1564 and 1516 cm −1 , C–C aromatic stretching peaks between 1600 and 1400 cm −1 and C–H aromatic stretching (1170–1110 cm −1 ) [ ]. The spectra of meloxicam and paracetamol physical mixtures were slightly different from the spectra of addition of the two components which could indicate slight interactions. The SD (Fig. 5b , c ) showed significant shortening of characteristic peaks of meloxicam and paracetamol which probably indicates H-bonding interaction between OH and NH groups of paracetamol with S=O, C=O, N–H, and OH groups of meloxicam. Such interactions may indicate the formation of a SD with relatively low degree of crystallinity.

X-ray Diffractograms
The XRD patterns of meloxicam shown in (Fig. 6 a ) indicated a highly crystalline compound with characteristic diffraction lines at 2θ 6.4, 11, 12.6, 14.5, 18.5, 19, 20.2, 21.8, 23, and 29° which correlate well with the reported values in the literature [ ]. Paracetamol also showed sharp diffraction lines at 2θ 11.6, 13.2, 15.2, 16.4, 17.6, 20, 23, 24 (forked), 26, 29, and 32.4° indicating a highly crystalline structure as reported previously [ ]. The diffractogram of the physical mixture showed slight shortened peaks of both meloxicam and paracetamol. This may be due to the grinding of the sample prior measurements which enhanced H-bonding interaction between the two drugs and resulted in some amorphousness. The X-ray diffractograms of SD F1–F4 in (Figs. 6b and 7 c) demonstrated also shortened peaks similar to those observed with physical mixture, where the maximum peak shortening of parent components occurred between 2θ of 10–20°. The SD (F3) also showed few low intensity peaks with exceptionally one sharp peak at 2θ of 24° which probably represent a shift of the forked peak characteristic of paracetamol. High reduction and shifting of various diffraction peaks may indicate higher degree of amorphousness and probably the presence of new crystal forms. In Fig. 6 c, the diffractograms F5-F7 also demonstrated relatively higher intensity of diffraction patterns compared to that of the physical mixture. The SD showed higher intensities and broader peaks and sometimes shifting of many peaks compared to physical mixture which could indicate existence of new polymorphic structures and high degree of crystallinity [ ]. These observations were supported by calculation of the relative degree of crystallinity as shown in Table 2 . Low degree of crystallinity (12.5–25%) was observed for SD F1–F4, while high degree of crystallinity (65.5–85.5%) was observed for F5–F7. These findings and the DSC results could indicate the appearance of new metastable crystal forms within the amorphous matrix [ ].

Saturation Solubility and Drug Content
The results of saturation solubility of the prepared binary SD showed more than sevenfold increase in solubility of meloxicam from the binary SD of F4 compared to the pure drug (Table 3 ). Formulations F1, F2, and F4 showed higher solubility of meloxicam being 12.3, 21.25, and 37.73 mg/mL, respectively, compared to pure meloxicam (5.19 mg/mL). Formulations of F5, F6, and F7 showed lower meloxicam solubility values 10.37, 8.07, and 8.81 mg/mL, respectively, compared to meloxicam solubility in formulations F1, F2, and F4. It is obvious that the SD with low degree of crystallinity (high amorphous content) showed higher solubility of meloxicam except for F3. All formulations were prepared using ethanol/water or ethanol, while F3 was prepared using acetone. The produced polymorphic crystals by acetone may be less soluble than the crystal forms produced via ethanol/water. In addition, it seems that even paracetamol in solution state could interact with meloxicam and it could act as a solubility enhancer.

Characterization of the Prepared Tablets
Tablets prepared from the amorphous SD and physical mixture. The tablets showed acceptable breaking strength and other mechanical properties. The values of hardness ranged from 69 to 62 N for both solid dosage forms with an acceptable percentage of weight loss not exceeding 0.67% which complies with the acceptable pharmacopeia limits of the friability test. The drug content was 98.8 and 98.1% in both solid dosage forms, respectively. The physical mixture containing tablets showed relatively shorter disintegration time (3.67 min) in comparison to 5.73 min for the SD containing tablets. Such difference is still within the acceptable range and could be attributed to higher compactability resulting in greater hardness of the amorphous SD compared to the crystalline physical mixture.
In Vitro Dissolution Studies
Comparative in vitro dissolution of meloxicam and paracetamol tablets of the SD (F4), generic meloxicam, generic paracetamol, and physical mixture tablets demonstrated higher percentage of meloxicam release from the SD compared to the other tablets (Fig. 7 a, b). Significantly different meloxicam release ( P < 0.05) was obtained for SD (F4) tablets where, more than 60% of meloxicam was released in 60 min compared to only 38.95% for generic meloxicam tablets and 38% for physical mixture tablets. Paracetamol release was almost the same for the three batches as it has good solubility and dissolution properties.
Pharmacological Properties
Analgesic Eddy’s Test (Time Before Licking Forepaws)
In this test, it was observed that the time (seconds) required for mice to start licking forepaws has significantly ( P < 0.05) changed between the three groups (control, physical mixture, and the SD). This time represented the ability of the animals to withstand the pain of the hot plate or anti-nociception ability [ ]. In this study, the time has increased by more than 28 and 64% with the SD compared to the physical mixture and the control group, respectively, (Table 4 and Fig. 8 ). Significant differences ( P < 0.05) in the analgesic effect represented by increase in time of licking forepaws to 7.92 s for the SD (F4) system compared to 6.15 and 4.82 s, for physical mixture and control groups were observed, respectively. It was observed that the determined time of licking forepaws of the physical mixture was insignificantly different compared to the control group. This result is in agreement with the fact that most NSAIDs has little or no effect on the hot-plate reaction time [ ] and most of the analgesic effect is due to paracetamol either in physical mixture or the SD.

Anti-inflammatory Effect
In this test, the anti-inflammatory effect of meloxicam in SD (F4) was evaluated and compared with the control and physical mixture groups. The change in the volume of carrageenan-induced tail edema was measured 1 h after injection and the data are shown in Table 5 and Fig. 9 . Meloxicam in the form of SD demonstrated 50% increase in the inhibition of edema compared to the physical mixture. This significant ( P < 0.05) increase in the anti-inflammatory effect may be due to the enhanced solubility of meloxicam and improved pharmacological activity brought about by the binary solid dispersion with paracetamol.

Conclusion
The binary SD technique employed between meloxicam and paracetamol proved to be effective in producing highly dissolving systems of meloxicam. Formulation F4 prepared by freeze drying using ethanol as a solvent in 1:10 M ratio of meloxicam to paracetamol produced a SD having the highest meloxicam solubility (>37 mg/mL) and dissolution rates (more than 65% in 60 min) compared to generic products or physical mixtures of meloxicam and paracetamol. The paw-licking time has increased by 28% using the binary SD system compared to that of the physical mixture. Such observation would indicate that the analgesic effect of meloxicam-paracetamol SD was enhanced. The changes in volume of tail edema in mice decreased by 50% using the binary SD system compared to that of the physical mixture which would indicate the enhancement of the anti-inflammatory effect. Therefore, formulating meloxicam as a binary SD with paracetamol could be a good choice for solving the unpredictable and erratic pharmacological properties of poorly water-soluble meloxicam.
