Introduction
According to the US-FDA, the definition of “Quality-by-Design (QbD)” adapted from ICH Q8, involves statistical tools and mathematical models to express the relationship between operational parameters (inputs) and critical quality attributes (outputs) [ , , , ], in which, the role of data-mining software(s) is highlighted for pharmaceutical research and development. When dealing with huge experimental data, artificial neural networks (ANNs) and related computing programs establish hidden layers constituted by several connected units or “nodes” in linking a factor to another (which was a simplified invented form of the biological synapse). These “invented biological synapses” then establish best-fit mathematical models as tools for predicting experimental results and optimal formulations [ , , , ]. Beside interpreting data, “design space,” another important factor in QbD, contains information on the multidimensional combination of process parameters and other input variables such as the number of experiments, varied input components, and/or running order. Therefore, in order to obtain as much information as possible from an affordable number of trials, design of experiments (DoE) was a concept to be considered. In several design models such as full-face and Box–Behnken, classical standard factorial designs are not only required for too many runs in the high number of resources or time allowed for the experiments but are also constrained due to the fact that several factor settings are not feasible or are impossible to run [ , , ]. D-optimal is a form designed by a computer algorithm in which, the experiment design is optional, and is established based on preliminary steps and a pre-specified model. Compared to others, D-optimal is a time-saving process as it minimizes the number of experiments. In this study, Modde 8.0 software was employed for D-optimal experiment design [ , , ], and the obtained data was analyzed with various computer tools and ANN softwares to characterize the effects of a polymer coating process on the physio-chemical properties of a nanoparticle (NP) system.
Paclitaxel is a natural or semisynthetic diterpene anti-neoplastic agent, extracted from the bark of the Western (Pacific) yew ( Taxus brevifolia ) or the needles and twigs of Taxus baccata . An important milestone in anti-cancer treatment was the application of paclitaxel (PTX) indicated for ovarian cancer, as an adjuvant for breast cancer [ , ], and recently for non-small cell lung cancer [ ]. However, a major challenge for the PTX dosage form is its low aqueous solubility. The marketed products of PTX (Onxol®, Taxol®, or Abraxane®) are formulations based on polyoxyethylene castor oil ethers (Cremophor® EL), or an albumin-bound nanoparticulate suspension; however, there have been several toxicity reports about these products [ , , ]. PTX was a suitable candidate to build a design space characterizing the impacts of a biodegradable polymer coating process. Poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA)-based NPs were selected due to their enhancement of cytotoxicity, and in vivo anti-tumor efficacy compared to the drug itself [ , , ]. Furthermore, an outer hydrophilic coating layer can prevent PLGA NPs from interacting with plasma components due to improved hydrophilic properties (stealth nanoparticles) [ , ]. Several studies have reported methods for adding hyaluronic acid (HA) or chitosan (CS) to their surface, and it is simply based on electrostatic interactions [ , , ]. Chitosan (CS), a natural polysaccharide comprising copolymers of β (1 → 4)-linked glucosamine and N-acetyl glucosamine, is a hydrophilic biopolymer that easily forms films, hydrogels, and scaffolds with PLGA NPs [ , , ]. Due to the hydrophilicity and electrostatic interactions of CS with PLGA NPs, this coating process does not negatively influence the particle properties [ , , ]. The purpose of this research is to characterize the effect of CS on the physio-chemical properties of NPs and this research hypothesized that CS improved PLGA particles by enhancing intra-cellular uptake, cytotoxicity, and apoptosis.
Materials and Methods
Paclitaxel (PTX) was purchased from Sinopharm (Beijing, China), PLGA (Lakeshore 50:50 DLG 2A) was purchased from Evonik (Darmstadt, Germany), low molecular weight chitosan was purchased from Sigma Aldrich (Palo alto, CA, USA). Dichloromethane and polysorbate 80 (Tween 80) were obtained from Xilong Scientific (Shanghai, China), acetonitrile or methanol was from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Ellipticine and camptothecin were from Merck (KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). All other chemicals were of reagent grade and were used without further purification.
Two cell lines: The Hela cell line (human cervix carcinoma) and the SK-LU-1 cell line (human lung adenocarcinoma) were originally purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas, VA, USA). Following recovery of master stocks, cells were routinely cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with fetal bovine serum (FBS) (GIBCO Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO 2 humid incubator. SK-LU-1 was grown in the culture media comprising DMEM with 2 mM L-glutamine, 10 mM HEPES, and 1.0 mM sodium pyruvate with 10% FBS (GIBCO) at 5% CO 2 .
Methods
Preparation of PTX-Loaded PLGA Nanoparticles (PLGA NPs)
The PLGA NPs were prepared using the solvent evaporation method from an oil-in-water emulsion as per previous studies [ , , ]. The oil phase, in which PTX (10 mg) and PLGA (40 mg) were dissolved in 5 mL dichloromethane (DCM), was dispersed into the external aqueous phase, prepared with 50 mL deionized water containing 1% polysorbate 80 ( w / v ). The oil phase was added dropwise to the water phase with a flow rate of 1 mL per min, and simultaneously homogenized at an ultrasonic power of 90 W and a frequency of 20 kHz using a high intensity probe ultrasonic processor Vibra-Cell (Sonics & Materials, Newtown, CT, USA), combined with magnetic stirring at 1000 rpm (Ika RCT basic IKAMAG, Germany) for 5.30 min in a cold ice water bath (4 to 10 °C). The DCM-water emulsion was then continuously stirred magnetically at 1000 rpm for the next 4 h to evaporate DCM. The emulsifier and free drugs were washed out thrice by ultrafiltration (MW 10,000, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) to obtain the final suspension of PTX-loaded PLGA NPs.
An original formulation was prepared and evaluated with ingredients and composition that were selected based on previously published works and preliminary experiments (data not shown). Formulations of experimental design are presented in the following Table 1 .

CS Coating on PLGA Nanoparticles (CS-PLGA NPs Preparation)
Preparation of CS in a working acid acetic solution (2 mg/mL): CS (0.1 g) was dissolved in 50 mL aqueous acetic acid solution (1% v / v ). The CS solution was diluted with a varied volume of 1% acetic acid to obtain different CS concentrations. Next, 25 mL of the obtained PLGA NPs suspension (~ 20 mg PLGA) was mixed with 25 mL CS working solution at different concentrations. The mixture was continuously stirred magnetically at 1000 rpm for 24 h to obtain the nanosuspension system of CS-PLGA NPs. Control PLGA particles (prepared in the same way with no chitosan) were also prepared for comparison [ , , ].
In order to evaluate the influence of pH on the characteristics of CS-PLGA NPs, 5 mL of different 1 M phosphate buffers at pH 3, 4, and 5 respectively were prepared and added to the mixing process of CS with PLGA NPs.
Mathematical Modeling and Optimization
In order to characterize the impacts of input factors on important physio-chemical properties, three following input factors were selected: CS/PLGA ratio ( w / w /), pH, and temperature. Meanwhile, the output-critical quality attributes were Z (nm), PDI, Zeta (mV), EE (%), and LC (%) values. The experiments were designed using a D-optimal model, using Modde 8.0 software (Umetrics AB, Malmö, Sweden). The order and experiment composition are listed in Table 1 . The obtained results were analyzed using Modde 8.0, and trained with artificial intelligence software(s): FormRules v2.0 and INForm v3.1 (Intelligensys, Chesire, UK) [ , , ]. The correlation coefficient ( R 2 ) was used as an indicator of the best fit of the models.
Characterization of Z, PDI, and ZP by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS)
The particle size (Z) and polydispersity index (PDI) of the obtained NPs were analyzed using a particle size analyzer (Zetasizer NanoZS90 Malvern, Worcestershire, UK). About 1 mL of NP suspension was diluted in 9 mL of deionized water. All data analysis was performed in the automatic mode. The measured size was presented from the average value of 15 to 20 runs, with triplicate measurements within each sample ( n = 3) [ , ].
The Zeta potentials (Zeta): Different formulations were prepared in the same way as for Z and PDI determination. Samples were then analyzed using the folded capillary cell (clear disposable zeta cell) [ , ].
Characterization of NP Morphology
The optimized PLGA NPs were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using a JEM 1010 (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). A small volume of each PLGA NP and CS-PLGA NP suspension was placed on a formvar-coated copper grid and allowed to dry at room temperature (25 °C ± 5 °C) before analysis [ , ].
Characterization of Surface Chemistry and Physical Interaction
The surface chemistry and physical interaction between polymers and drugs was determined from Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis, based on the KBr pellet method. Briefly, nanoparticle suspensions were lyophilized at a temperature of − 50 ± 5 °C and a vacuum pressure of 0.1 ± 0.02 mbar. The obtained powders were kept in a desiccator, mixed with potassium bromide (KBr), and then pressed into very thin tablets. Samples for FT-IR spectrometry were analyzed in the 400–5000 cm −1 range using a Jasco 6700 FT-IR Spectrometer (JASCO Deutschland, Pfungstadt, Germany) [ , ].
Encapsulation Efficiency (EE %), Loading Capacity (LC %)
The values of encapsulation efficiency (EE) and drug loading capacity (LC) of PLGA NPs were calculated from the total amount of the drug in 1 mL nanosuspension ( M total drug ) and the amount of the free drug dissolved in 1 mL suspension ( M free drug ).
To determine the M total drug , 1 mL PLGA NP or CS-PLGA NP suspensions was mixed with acetonitrile (ACN) at a 1:3 ratio to dissolve PTX. The obtained solution then was filtered through 0.45 μm membranes, diluted (if necessary), and quantified using a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system (Agilent 1260 Infinity LC system, Poroshell 120 SB-C18 column: 15 cm × 0.30 cm, 2.7 μm). The mobile phase was a mixture of ACN: pH 3.0 phosphate buffer (0.05 M) at the ratio of 52:48 ( v / v ), with a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. By injecting a volume of 50 μL separately, chromatograms were recorded at 250 nm. The method had an accuracy of 100.05% (RSD 1.23%) and linearity with R 2 of 0.9988.
To determine the M free drug , 1 mL suspension of PLGA NPs or CS-PLGA NP was placed in an Amicon ultrafiltration tube (MWCO 10000, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 60 min to collect the filtrate for analysis.
The EE and LC were calculated using the following equations: $$ EE\ \left(\%\right)=\left({M}_{\mathrm{total}\ \mathrm{drug}}-{M}_{\mathrm{free}\ \mathrm{drug}}\right)/{M}_{\mathrm{total}\ \mathrm{drug}}\times 100 $$ $$ LC\ \left(\%\right)=\left({M}_{\mathrm{total}\ \mathrm{drug}}-{M}_{\mathrm{free}\ \mathrm{drug}}\right)/{M}_{\mathrm{initial}\ \mathrm{weight}}\times 100 $$ where M initial weight is the weight of PTX and polymers which was weighed to prepare the NPs [ , , , ].
Characterization of Drug Release from PLGA NPs and CS-PLGA NPs
The in vitro release was performed using 3 mL of NP suspension (equivalent to about 3 mg PTX) transferred into a dialysis bag (MWCO, 10 kDa). The release medium was phosphate buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4 containing polysorbate 80 (1% v / v ). Polysorbate 80 was used due to the low solubility of PTX in water. The dialysis bag carrying NPs inside was immersed in 30 mL media in a capped 50-mL tube which was shaken gently at 100 rpm and a temperature of 37 °C (Shaker Incubator LSI-100B). At predetermined time points (2, 5, 7, 9, 12, 14, 24, 36, and 48 h), 1 mL of the incubation medium was collected and replaced with an equal volume of fresh media. The quantities of PTX released were analyzed using the HPLC method described above. The release experiments were performed in triplicate and the results were expressed as the mean ± SD [ , , ].
Cytotoxicity Assay
Two cell lines including the Hela cell line (human cervix carcinoma), and the SK-LU-1 cell line (human lung adenocarcinoma) were suitably grown under a maintenance condition (T-75 cm 2 flask) and an analysis condition (96-well plate, Corning, NY, USA). Established adherent cells were harvested using trypsin-EDTA.
A volume of 180 μL of the cell suspension (3 × 10 4 cells/mL) was transferred to each well of a 96-well, followed by 20 μL of testing samples. Samples of nanoparticle formulations and related references prepared at a high concentration were diluted with culture medium to obtain appropriate concentrations immediately before the tests. After incubation for 48 h, the cell layers were fixed with 10% ( w / v ) trichloroacetic acid (TCA), washed three times with acetic acid, and stained for 30 min with of sulforhodamine B reagent (SRB) at 37 °C. The cell density after drug treatment was then measured as an absorption value (OD at 515 nm) using an ELISA Plate Reader (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).
The control sample (Day 0) without drug treatment, was incubated for 1 h, and fixed with TCA. The negative reference sample was treated with 10% DMSO. Meanwhile, an ellipticine sample was used as a reference for the test. Cell viability was calculated using the following formulation [ , ]: $$ \mathrm{Cell}\ \mathrm{viability}\ \left(\%\right)=\left({\mathrm{OD}}_{\mathrm{Sample}}\hbox{--} {\mathrm{OD}}_{\mathrm{Day}0}\right)/\left({\mathrm{OD}}_{\mathrm{Negative}\ \mathrm{reference}}\hbox{--} {\mathrm{OD}}_{\mathrm{Day}0}\right)\ \mathrm{x}\ 100\ \left(\%\right) $$ $$ \mathrm{Inhibition}\ \left(\%\right)=100\hbox{--} \mathrm{Cell}\ \mathrm{viability}\ \left(\%\right). $$
IC50 values were calculated based on % inhibition using TableCurve 2Dv4 (System Software Inc., San Jose, CA, USA). According to the National Cancer Institute (NCI, USA), sample with IC50 less than 20 μg/mL or 5 μM were considered active (as a cytotoxicity agent) [ , , ].
Apoptosis
This study was conducted on the SK-LU-1 cell line (human lung carcinoma), and PLGA NPs and CS-PLGA NPs were used at a PTX concentration of 0.1 mg/mL.
Hoechst Staining for Nuclear Analysis
Morphological changes in the nucleus were observed microscopically based on the Hoechst method [ , , ]. SK-LU-1 cancer cells were seeded in 6-well plates (Corning, NY, USA) at a density of 1 × 10 5 cells/well. After pre-incubation for 24 h, the cells were treated with samples for 48 h. Camptothecin was used as a reference sample, and DMSO was used as a negative reference. The cells were washed twice with PBS, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 30 min before staining with Hoechst 33342 (0.5 μg/mL) for 10 min at room temperature in the dark (excitation/emission of 350/461 nm). Thereafter, the ratio of apoptotic cells per 400 cells was calculated under a microscope (Nikon Eclipse Ti).
Caspase-3 Assay
Cancer cells were seeded in 24-well plates (Corning, NY, USA) at a density of 2 × 10 5 cells/well for 24 h. Cells were then incubated with different samples including the NP samples, negative reference (DMSO 10%), and positive reference (camptothecin). After 24 h, cells were harvested and lysed in 50 μL cell lysis buffer for 10 min, and then centrifuged for 10 min (1000 rpm) to collect the cell mass. The obtained cell mass was diluted with cell lysis buffer to prepare a 50-μL solution of 1 μg/mL for each reaction: 50 μL 2X reaction buffer, 5 μL DEVD-pNA (200 μM) at 37 °C for 1 h. The results were recorded on a microplate reader at 450 nm (TECAN, Salzburg, Austria) [ , ].
Cell Cycle Analysis
SK-LU-1 cancer cells were seeded in 6-well plates (Corning, USA) at a density of 1 × 10 6 cells/well. Samples, DMSO (negative reference), and camptothecin 5 μM (positive reference) were incubated with cells for 24 h. After 24 h, the cells were harvested with trypsin, centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min. The cells were then fixed with 70% ethanol for 12 h and diluted with 0.45 mL PBS. Next, RNase A (1 mg/mL) was added and incubated 37 °C in 15 min, followed by 25 μL PI (1 mg/mL) for 1 h, and diluted with 500 μL PBS, the samples were then analyzed for apoptosis using flow cytometry on the Novocyte system (ACEA Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA) with data analysis and reporting by NovoExpress software (ACEA) [ , ].
Cellular Uptake Study
PLGA and CS-PLGA NPs were labeled with coumarin-6 at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL, and tested in SK-LU-1 cells (human lung carcinoma). The uptake properties of coumarin-labeled NPs in the cancer cells were characterized by flow cytometry analysis and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Cancer cells were seeded in 6-well plates (Corning Glass Works, Corning, NY, USA) at a density of 1 × 10 6 cells/well at 24 h before drug treatment.
Flow cytometry: The cells were treated with PLGA NPs and CS-PLGA NPs labeled with coumarin-6 for 1 h. The cells were then harvested using trypsin, washed with PBS, and analyzed for intracellular fluorescence using Novocyte flow cytometry followed by data analysis on NovoExpress software (ACEA Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA). Cell without treatment were used as controls.
Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy: Each coverslip kept in the 6-well plate was loaded with cancer cells at a density of 1 × 10 5 cells per well and incubated for 24 h for cell attachment. Different NPs labeled with coumarin-6 were added at a concentration of 5 μg/mL to the cells, incubated for 5 min, and washed with PBS. The cells were then fixed on cover slips in 1 mL 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min before staining with Hoechst 33342 (5 μg/mL). In each step, PBS was used to wash off the remaining previous solutions. The cover slips were then mounted on a glass slide for observation under a confocal laser scanning microscope (Axio microscope, Zeiss-Axio, Oberkochen, Germany).
Results
Preparation of PLGA and CS-PLGA NPs
Based on preliminary experiments, PLGA NPs were prepared with stable properties, then coated with CS (to obtain CS-PLGA NPs). Three input factors (with suitable ranges) were selected and listed as follows: CS/PLGA ratio ( w / w ) ranging from 0.1 to 0.6, pH ranging from 3 to 5, and a temperature range of 10 °C to 40 °C (Table 1 ).
Z, PDI, and Zeta
The Z and PDI are two typical specifications to access NPs. In this study, PDI values of all formulations in Table 1 were in the range of 0.228 to 0.365, indicating a narrow size distribution (PDI should be under 0.5, according to Malvern) [ , ]. Hence, all experimental formulations of PLGA NPs and CS-PLGA NPs had acceptable values for a NP system and data analysis. Table 1 shows that increasing the CS/PLGA ratio from 0.1 to 0.6 led to larger average size(s), wherein Z was in the range from 139.9 to 244.5 nm. Higher CS amounts led to thicker CS layers resulting in increased NP sizes. In addition, changing the pH from 3 to 5 led to an increase in Z values (Table 1 , formulation from number 1 to 5). On the other hand, although the changing Temperature caused Z to change, the trends of output responses were not clear.
Regarding Zeta, all the formulations in Table 1 are in a positive range of 30 to 55.6 mV due to the fact that CS is a polymer with amine groups [ , , ]. In contrast, PLGA NPs (before CS coating) were negatively charged (data not shown). This property of the negative Zeta is due to the presence of uncapped end carboxyl groups of the PLGA polymer which facilitated the coating process of CS (with amine functional groups) based on electrostatic interactions [ , ].
Entrapment Efficiency (EE%) and LC (%)
From Table 1 , all the formulation had an EE (%) with relatively high values (ranging from 86.22 to 98.99%), which is comparable to other reports [ , , ]. In addition, LC (%) was in the range of 14.02 to 19.20%. The highest level of EE (%) was obtained when CS was high (at the ratio of 0.6), or at a high pH (5). With an increasing amount of polymer, more drugs were entrapped into the nanoparticle core, which caused changes in the LC%. Notably, PLGA gave a high EE to PTX due to its hydrophobic property compared to other polymers, which was consistent with other reports about PLGA [ , ].
Mathematical Modeling
The data obtained in Table 1 was analyzed to draw the input impacts on outputs. To validate the predictability of a trained model, the nonlinear coefficient of determination R 2 was computed against the data set. R 2 values are in the range of 0 to 100%, and the closer R 2 to 100%, the better do the models fit and predict the response. Accordingly, R 2 values are listed in Table 2 for Z, PDI, Zeta, EE (%), and LC (%) to determine if this work was in a reliable model. Firstly, the R 2 of PDI calculated by INForm is relatively low (< 80%), and is close to the that by Modde (65.2%), suggesting that the PDI data was somehow fit for neither the ANN model nor the quadratic model. Table 2 Outputs of data analysis Output response Desirability Artificial network Quadratic model INForm FormRules Modde R 2 F-ratio X1* X2* X3* R 2 adjusted Q 2 p value p -lack-of-fit Y1 Z (nm) Min 98.73 21.02 + + + 94.2 0.779 0 11.675 Y2 PDI Min 77.73 0.91 + – – 65.2 0.212 0.022 0.190 Y3 Zeta (mV) Max 97.06 8.91 + + – 83.5 0.513 0.001 0.070 Y4 EE (%) Max 89.36 2.29 – + – 1.5 0 0.521 0.148 Y5 LC (%) Max 95.82 6.21 – + – 28.8 0.147 0.218 0.356 *(+): The input factor had a significant impact on the output ones (−): The input factor had an insignificant impact on the output ones
Besides, in INForm, the results of regression analysis for the model also depicted F-ratios, with a degree of freedom of (11, 3) for each output. The critical value of F (Fisher ratio) (0.05, 11, 3) is equal to 8.76 (DF = 11, 3), which is lower than the computed F-ratios of Z and Zeta, respectively. Hence, the trained mathematical model contributes significantly to predict the Z and Zeta without practical experiments. In contrast, when the F-ratio was relatively low along with high R 2 values, it suggested that the obtained data was fit to the model, but the trained model could not predict the experiments statistically [ ]. One reason is that the EE or LC values were varied in a relatively narrow range compared to the changing inputs. Hence, there are “noise” factors that might interfere with the prediction, even though INForm has established a model fit for these data.
In addition, FormRules was employed to determine which inputs were the most critical ones on quality properties (Table 2 ). Interestingly, while Z (nm) was influenced by all three input factors (symbolized as “+”), Zeta was determined by X1 (CS/PLGA ratio) and X2 (pH). Meanwhile, PDI, EE (%), and LC (%) were determined by only one factor as mentioned in Table 2 .
Furthermore, the data were also analyzed by Modde for comparison with INForm and FormRules, ANOVA for outputs was also calculated by Modde 8.0, presented in Table 2 , along with the R 2 (correlated coefficients), Q 2 (predicted multiple correlation coefficients), and p values of the final model ( p value and p value lack of fit). The Modde software showed that the quadratic model was not fit for %EE (Y4) and %LC (Y5) due to low R 2 values (1.5 and 28.8, respectively), neither were the predictions of Y4 and Y5 due to low Q 2 values. In addition, the mathematical equation for the 4D response of Y1, Y2, Y3, Y4, and Y5 in various conditions of X1, X2, and X3 was presented with values of coefficient (symbolized as “ b ”) and a constant ( b 0 ):
Y y = b 0 + b 1 X 1 + b 2 X 2 + b 3 X 3 + b 11 X 1 2 + b 22 X 2 2 + b 33 X 3 2 + b 12 X 1. X 2 + b 13 X 1. X 3 + b 23 X 2. X 3.
where Y y with y from 1 to 5, corresponds to Z, PDI, Zeta, EE, and LC (respectively). Constant and coefficients ( b) were calculated by the software (Modde 8.0) [ , ]. As mentioned, the above equation is suitable for the two outputs of Y1 (Z) and Y3 (Zeta) due to high R 2 values and acceptable Q 2 . When an input factor did not have a significant effect on an output factor, coefficient values were relatively low (close to 0) and/or with a p value > 0.05. The obtained results showed that X1 and X2 affected Y1 significantly and had the greatest impacts. In contrast, X3 (temperature) had a minor effect which was interacting with X1 and X2 (X1*X3 and X2*X3).
Similarly, in case of Y3 (Zeta mV), the coefficients had p < 0.05 were b 0 , b 1 , b 2 , and the absolute values of b 1 , b 12 , and b 2 were the three biggest values (data were not shown), respectively. These findings confirmed that the influence of X1 (CS/PLGA) and X2 (pH) on Zeta values as well as the impact of X3 was not significant. This finding was consistent with the results obtained from FormRules (mentioned above and Table 2 ).
Comparing INForm and Modde, despite different mathematical approaches, the results obtained from Modde were generally consistent with those from INForm. In detail, the R 2 values for Z and Zeta were high with acceptable p value and p lack-of-fit, whereas the PDI data were not suitable for modeling and prediction.
On the other hand, the predictions from both were not good at Y4 (EE) and Y5 (LC) with low Q 2 values or low F-ratios. However, as the R 2 values of EE and LC calculated by INFom (over 80%) were higher than those by Modde, it can be stated that INForm can establish a model fit for EE and LC whereas Modde could not find a suitable equation for these. In fact, while Modde 8.0 was designed in a quadratic model, INForm is based on hidden layers, nodes, and transfer type of Asymmetric Sigmoid [ , ]. Thus, ANN software(s) like INForm have more advantages than Modde in characterizing a “design space,” especially when the outputs have such narrow ranges that a mathematical equation is poor to fit.
Response Surface Plots
The following 3D graphs in Fig. 1 were plotted to exhibit further impacts of input factors on two outputs, which were Line 1 of Y1 (Z, nm) and Line 2 of Y3 (Zeta, mV). The input factors and their interactions were plotted in different columns—column 1: pH and CS/PLGA (at temperature of 40 °C); column 2: temperature and CS/PLGA (at pH of 3.5); and column 3: temperature and pH (at CS/PLGA of 0.4). Besides, Fig. 1 b was drawn for comparing the response surfaces analyzed by Modde, FormRules, and INForm. Generally, the 3D graphs in Fig. 1 a (drawn by Modde) and INForm have similar hypersurfaces and curves, which confirmed the same cause–effect relationships involved in nanoparticle preparation. Both the ANN (INForm) and quadratic models (Modde) predicted well for Z (Y1) and Zeta (Y3), but there were problems for Y2, Y4, and Y5. Therefore, the plots of the impacts on Y2, Y4, and Y5 outputs were not drawn. Fig. 1 a : Response surface graphs of Y1 (Z, nm) (row line 1) and Y3 (Zeta, mV) (row line 2) in various input conditions.

In Fig. 1 b, INForm had more curved points at the edge of the surface, while FormRules gave a stepwise direction. Compared to INForm, Modde showed similar general curves as INForm, except some at the edge of hypersurfaces. In order to prepare a design space for characterizing the impacts of input on output, Modde was used in this research. The reason is that the 3D graphs drawn by Modde have adequate information, and are easier to interpret than the more complicated ones by INForm.
Effect on Z
Z was influenced by all the three input factors (Table 2 ) and is presented in Fig. 1 a (Y1.1, Y1.2, and Y1.3), where Y1.1 clearly shows that Z values were increased with increasing CS/PLGA (from 0.1 to 0.6) or pH (from 3 to 5).
Besides, when the pH is 3.5 (Fig. 1 a Y1.2), varying the temperature from 40 to 10 at CS/PLGA of 0.6 (high level) increased the Z values. Nevertheless, changing the temperature did not influence Z at CS/PLGA of 0.3 (where, the plot of Fig. 1 a Y1.2 was close and parallel to the horizontal axis).
When X1 (CS/PLGA) was at 0.4 (Fig. 1 a Y1.3), Z values were correlated with X3 (temperature) (from 10 to 40 °C) at pH 5 (high level of X2), while the Z values were reversed-correlated with temperature at pH 3 (low level of X2). This was complied with the fact that X3 affected Z through interaction with X2 and X1.
Effect on Zeta
The effects of input factors on Zeta are presented in Table 2 and Fig. 1 a from Y3.1 to Y3.3, wherein, all the inputs had an influence on Zeta, except temperature. In Fig. 1 a Y3.1 and Y3.2, Zeta increase was correlated with growing CS amount; changing the CS/PLGA from low (0.1) to high (0.6) increased the Zeta from the lowest points (~ 30 mV) to the highest point (55.6 mV).
On the other hand, in Fig. 1 a Y3.2 and Y3.3, reducing the pH from 5 to 3 increased the Zeta values at relatively high CS/PLGA (from 0.4 to 0.6), whereas the impact of pH on Zeta was minor at low CS/PLGA (0.2). As the input factor of temperature (°C) did not affect Zeta, the plot for the relation between temperature and Zeta seemed to be a parallel line with the axis of temperature.
Optimization Process
Based on the information, the optimized formulation was predicted using INForm software [ , ]. The predicted optimized formulation and related characteristics are presented in Table 3 along with the experimental values (average of triplicate) for the output factors. As mentioned above, bias (%) for Z and Zeta was comparatively lower than that of PDI, EE, and LC. However, the predicted and experimental values generally showed a good agreement with good properties of small Z values (161.53 nm), low PDI (0.270), high Zeta (+ 41.87), and high EE (%) (98.59). Table 3 Optimization formulation: predicted and experimental data Inputs Outputs CS/PLGA pH Temp (°C) Z (nm) PDI Zeta EE (%) LC (%) Predicted data 0.42 3.41 40 165.01 0.300 42.75 95.60 17.73 Experimental data 0.4 3.5 40 161.53 ± 0.97 0.270 ± 0.007 41.87 ± 1.42 98.59 ± 0.22 14.60 ± 0.04 Bias (%) 2.1 10.0 2.1 3.1 17.6
Morphology Study by TEM Image
The morphology was studied using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and the images of CS-PLGA NPs and PLGA NPs prepared with the optimal formulation are shown in Figs. 2 and 3 (a and b). B shows that the nanoparticles are spherical in shape with sizes in the range of 160 nm (scale bar 500 nm) which is consistent with the DLS data. Fig. 2 TEM images of ( a ) PLGA NPs with a scale of 200 nm and ( b ) CS-PLGA NPs with a scale of 500 nm Fig. 3 FTIR spectra of CS-PLGA NPs (black), CS (blue), PLGA (green) and PTX (red)
FTIR Analysis
FTIR was conducted to verify the occurrence of chemical bonds between the drug and polymer: pure PTX, PLGA, CS, and NPs. The infrared spectrum of PTX is specialized by the bands of following specific functional groups:
Region of 3500 cm −1 : Amine (N-H) and hydroxide (O-H) bonds had conspicuous vibrations (3305, 3441, and 3499 cm −1 ) which formed a band of 3500 cm −1 , with NH and OH peaks convoluting each other in case of PTX due to interactions with other carbonyl groups (amide) and aromatic rings. In contrast, CS and PLGA have a round stretching band, with a smooth curve in this region.
Region of 3000 cm −1 : PTX had a rough band with the range of 2800 to 3100 cm −1 formed by several sharp peaks such as 2909, 2946, 3019 cm −1 of aromatic C-H and CH, that disturbed each other. Similarly, PLGA has a rough peak, contributed by CH bonds interacting with groups of carbonyl (-C=O) or carboxylate (COO-). However, CS has a low-intensity regular peak, which is the vibration of NH amine.
Region of 1700 cm −1 : C=O vibrations in carbonyl group exhibit a strong absorption band, which is observed in the region 1735, 1751 cm −1 in case of PTX (C=O linked with other hydrocarbon and C=O linked with other aromatic rings). PLGA has only one peak of C=O. However, it was not observed in the FTIR of CS.
Around 1200 cm −1 : PTX has a high-intensity band due to vibrations ( C-N) that are strong and located in the peak of 1248 cm −1 . In case of CS, this C-N band was lower and irregular at 1300 cm −1 .
When incorporating PTX in CS-PLGA NPs, the FTIR spectrum of the NP sample shows several peaks and bands such as 3500, 2925, 1730, 1251, and several peaks under 1000 cm −1 corresponding to PTX, although the intensity was lower (due to different concentration of drugs). The obtained spectra suggested that the chemical structure of the drug is maintained due to addition of the drug excipients.
On the other hand, the FTIR peaks of NPs have a similar shape with CS (raw materials). Thus, the fact that CS peaks overwhelmed these others confirmed the appearance of CS in the NPs, and CS was predicted to form a deep layer around the PLGA NPs. The NH band (around 3500 cm −1 ) of CS was changed slightly in case of CS-PLGA NPs, suggesting that CS interacts with PLGA NPs through NH bonds. These results were consistent with other reports that CS and PLGA interact electrostatically (between NH of CS and COO- of PLGA) [ , , ].
In Vitro Drug Release
Figure 4 shows the cumulative release curves of PTX from the NPs. After 48 h, about 60% of the loaded PTX was released from uncoated PLGA and 50% of PTX was released from CS-coated PLGA NPs. Fig. 4 In vitro drug release from PLGA NPs (blue) and CS-PLGA NPs (orange)
All the profiles were characterized by a period of rapid initial drug release followed by a continuous period of slow release after 12 h due to diffusion or erosion of the PLGA matrix. Especially, compared with the PLGA NPs, the CS-coated NPs delayed the initial burst release during the first 2 h. In detail, when the CS layers covered the outer layers of NPs, CS was precipitated at pH 7.4, which caused a delayed release property. The cumulative release percentages of PTX from the unmodified PLGA and CS-coated PLGA NPs were 31.41 ± 2.38 and 23.37 ± 4.13% at 12 h; and 62.72 ± 7.8 and 51.22 ± 2.5%, at 48 h, respectively. This implied that modification of the surface with CS had effectively changed the location of PTX on the surface of the PLGA NPs, and was considered as a physical barrier.
Cytotoxicity Characterization
The cytotoxic effect of PTX-loaded CS-PLGA NPs was studied compared to the one without CS (PLGA NPs), and the result is presented in Fig. 5 . The proliferation of tested cell lines after 48 h treatment with the nanoparticle formulations was assayed at concentrations equivalent to 0.078, 0.156, 0.312, 0.625, 1.25, and 2.5 μg/mL of PTX, respectively. Fig. 5 Cytotoxicity study of PLGA NPs and CS-PLGA NPs on ( a ) Hela cell line and ( b ) SK-LU-1 cell line
The blank CS-coated NPs had no significant influence on the viability of Hela and SK-LU-1 cells at 48 h after administration (more than 80%). In case of PLGA NPs and CS-PLGA NPs with the above concentrations, the growth of Hela and SK-LU-1 cells was significantly inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. Lower cancer cell viability was achieved at higher drug concentrations (1.25 and 2.5 μg/mL), which indicated highly significant cytotoxic activity.
Compared with PLGA NPs (uncoated NPs), the viability of the two cell lines was significantly reduced when treated with CS-coated NPs. This finding suggested that the CS-coated PLGA NPs delivered a higher level of cytotoxicity and especially showed significant toxicity. At relatively low concentrations (from 0.078 to 0.312 μg/mL), the difference between PLGA and CS-PLGA NPs was clearly observed, while this was not obvious at higher concentrations (from 1.25 to 2.5 μg/mL).
The IC 50 values of PLGA NPs were 0.88 ± 0.05 μg/mL, and 1.27 ± 0.08 μg/mL (for Hela and SK-LU-1, respectively), which were higher than those of CS-PLGA NPs (0.31 ± 0.02 and 0.88 μg/mL). Therefore, it can be concluded that CS-PLGA NPs exhibited higher levels of cytotoxicity towards cancer cells compared to PTX-loaded PLGA NPs ( p < 0.05).
These higher levels of cytotoxicity were attributed to the effect of NPs carrying the drug into the cells via endocytosis, and the increased cationic nature of CS-decorated NPs around a relatively acidic pH environment of cancer cells compared to the neutral pH of normal cells. These results suggest that the use of positive surface modified PLGA NPs as a carrier for PTX could be promising for better effects on cancer cells.
Apoptosis Study
This study was carried out on SK-LU-1 (human lung carcinoma), while Hela was used as reported before [ ].
Hoechst Staining for Nucleus Analysis
In case of the Hoechst method, microscopy revealed patterns of cell death based on Hoechst staining intensity. During the apoptosis process, the cell nuclei were shrunken, and were crescent or strip-shaped, which confirmed the apoptosis initiation. Besides, the nuclear condensation events resulting from stress are the most important indicators of cytotoxicity, which was clearly observed under a microscope after staining (Fig. 6 a). To determine the difference between samples, especially PLGA and CS-PLGA NPs at 2.5 μg/mL, a number of cells with apoptosis were counted for each experiment. The PTX solution was also used for further quantitative tests. The PLGA NPs showed about 12.37% cells in apoptosis, whereas 10.78% cells were in apoptosis with CS-PLGA NPs. This value was 13.72% for the PTX solution. Firstly, the difference between NPs and the control confirmed the effects of NPs. Secondly, the difference between these samples can be explained by the controlled release property of the PLGA polymer-based NPs as well as the role of CS in controlling the release rate from NPs. Fig. 6 Apoptosis study: ( a ) Hoechst nucleus staining and ( b ) caspace-3 induce assay
Caspace-3 Induction Analysis
Figure 6 b illustrates the caspase-3 induction activities of three samples: PLGA and CS-PLGA NPs and PTX solution, on SK-LU-1 at three concentrations. Generally, at low concentrations of treatment (around 2.5 μg/mL), cells underwent apoptosis by caspase activation: CS-PLGA NPs stimulated caspase-3 synthetase by ~ 2 times compared to PLGA NPs and 1.47 times compared to DMSO (negative sample). However, different mechanisms caused cell death at higher concentrations. Therefore, at high concentration of NPs (5 or 10 μg/mL), the apoptosis mechanisms were not related to caspase-3. This can be indicated by the fact that cells died before caspase-3 induction [ , ].
Cell Cycle Study
The cell cycle (in eukaryotes) which includes cell division and replication was divided into four phases: G1, S, G2 (interphase), and G0/M. The activation process of the later phase depends on the completion of the previous one. In general, all the samples inhibited the cells in G2 compared to the control samples. PTX and the positive reference camptothecin, arrested the cells in phase S (58.29%, Table 4 ) leading to a G2/M block, whereas CS-PLGA NPs arrested the cells in G1-S and S [ , ]. As reported, PTX induces tubulin polymerization and forms extremely stable and nonfunctional microtubules [ , ]; thus, cells were blocked in the G2/M phase upon exposure to PTX. In case of PTX CS-PLGA NPs, the cells arrested in S phase were at a lower percentage compared to those in the G1 phase. Generally, the treatment duration in this experiment was relatively lower (24 h), and CS-PLGA NPs release PTX in a delayed manner. Thus, CS-PLGA did not exhibit strong apoptosis activity similar to the PTX solution. This “delayed release property” was similar to that observed in the Hoechst experiment and in vitro release. Table 4 Cell cycle arrested study with PTX solution, CS-PLGA NPs, and the positive reference (camptothecine) Cell cyle PTX (100 nM) PTX + PLGA + CS (2.5 μg/mL) Camptothecine (5 μM) G1 30.52 47.07 33.72 S 58.29 41.73 57.53 G2/M 11.08 11.21 8.45
Intracellular Uptake Study
To evaluate the cellular uptake of CS-PLGA NPs and PLGA NPs, NPs were labeled with coumarin-6 as a florescent agent at a concentration of 5 μg/mL. Flow cytometry analysis and microscopic observation was carried out on the SK-LU-1 cell line.
Flow Cytometry
After incubation for 30 min, the higher intensity of FITC-H indicated that more NPs had permeated into the cells. Figure 7 a confirms that CS-PLGA and PLGA NPs were taken up into the cells, compared to the negative reference. Besides, the CS-PLGA NPs showed a better uptake property (FITC-H of 10 6 to 10 7 ) compared to that (10 6 ) of PLGA. Fig. 7 Cellular uptake study: ( a ) flow cytometry and ( b ) microscopical observation
Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy
The microscopic observation is shown in Fig. 7 b, clearly presenting the internalization of nanoparticles in cells. Both PLGA and CS-PLGA exhibited green coloration in the cytoplasm region with a diffused distribution, suggesting that CS-PLGA NPs were mainly distributed uniformly in the entire cell cytoplasm and not in the nucleus, which was also observed with PLGA-based NPs [ , ]. The high uptake property of CS-PLGA into SK-LU1 suggested a promising application for this formulation.
Discussion
The mentioned data-mining software(s) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) are tools for predicting future experimental results and optimized formulations based on mathematical connections where the neuro-fuzzy methology allows combining the data analysis ability of neural networks to express complex data simply as plots (design space) [ , , ].
Although there are differences in data handling between Modde, FormRules, and INForm, the relationship between inputs and outputs established by these software(s) was comparatively similar. However, FormRules2.0 was designed in a neuro-fuzzy logic where extraneous variables were omitted in the data analysis to develop a best-fit model [ , ]. In the same way, the quadratic equation established by Modde does not fit well with some “parsimonious” points near the edge of hypersurfaces (Fig. 1 b). Therefore, the INForm software is an appropriate tool to generate models and predict the optimal formulation. Actually, this research showed that the R 2 values established by INForm were higher than those of Modde, and results of % bias were relatively low between the predicted and real values (Table 3 ). These results confirmed the capacity of INForm for data analysis and optimization.
However, using INForm alone did not provide specific rules and relationships about the way inputs influence outputs (as FormRule) or levels of significance (Modde). FormRules can determine if an input is critical or the relationship between a particular input and output. Similar observations obtained by FormRules and Modde can lead to suggestion of using these to screen a series of factors that have a great variety of impacts on the output. These are foundations can generate understandable and reusable information [ , , ].
In order to improve the hydrophilic property and cytotoxicity activity, the hydrophobic surface of PLGA was modified by coating chitosan (CS) onto PLGA particles. The Zeta of prepared PLGA NPs (before coating) were in negative range, thus the positive Zeta values in Table 1 confirmed that CS was coated onto the surface of PLGA NPs [ , , ]. Further research on FTIR and in vitro PTX release profile of new NPs also supported the appearance of CS on the NPs surface. Moreover, results from the in vitro release suggested that CS-PLGA can control PTX release from NPs [ , , , ]. This is the first time by which the coating process, especially interactions between CS/PLGA, and temperature and pH were characterized by D-optimal design and ANN data analysis.
CS is a positively charged polysaccharide with the amino groups of CS showing a pKa of 6.5. Thus, CS is soluble in weakly acidic medium, and insoluble in neutral and alkaline media [ , , ]. Several preliminary experiments also showed that when pH was over 5 (around 6), CS became increasingly globular with a lower solubility, such that CS-PLGA NPs were not formed. This phenomenon explained why increasing the pH from 3 to 5, resulted in more CS adsorption to the surface of PLGA NPs (opposite charged) to increase the Z values of NPs. After locating the CS onto PLGA surface, CS-PLGA NPs were subjected to an in vitro release assay at pH 7.4 (PBS), where CS contributed to the lag-phase of drug release (Fig. 4 ).
After coating with various CS/PLGA ratios (corresponding to the different amount of CS), the optimized formulation had a Z of 160 nm, low PDI, high Zeta (high stable nanoparticle), and high EE%. In case of nanoparticles for cytotoxicity effects, NPs under 200 nm would be most appropriate, especially for cellular uptake [ ]. The potential use of these particles is to serve as carriers for PTX to lung cancer, in the clinical setting.
In this study, CS-surface-modified PLGA NPs could significantly enhance their uptake in these cancer cells compared to uncoated PLGA NPs. Several studies have shown that cancer cells have more significant surface charge density compared to normal cells [ ]. Negatively charged tumor vascular cells might have roles in targeting the delivery of drugs into cancer cells due to stronger electrostatic linking and affinity [ ]. On the other hand, in acidic conditions, the surface charges of CS-modified nanoparticles become more positive. As a result, CS (positive Zeta) plays a role in the highly invasive property of the NPs [ ]. In fact, CS-PLGA NPs showed better cellular uptake property than that of PLGA NPs.
For comparison between PLGA NP and CS-PLGA NPs, although the % apoptosis with CS-PLGA observed microscopically was slightly lower than that of PLGA NPs, caspase induction by CS-PLGA was higher than that by PLGA NP. This can be explained by the fact that PTX was released in a slow controlled manner from CS-PLGA NPs. Consequently, when conducting the Hoechst experiment in a short time, apoptosis by CS-PLGA NPs was observed to be induced later than the PTX solution or PLGA NPs. In contrast, in case of caspase-3 induction, the same duration was suitable for CS-PLGA to induce a larger amount of caspase-3, indicating a higher apoptosis-induction property compared to the other groups. The apoptosis and cell viability data clearly indicate that CS-PLGA improved the cytotoxic activity of NPs. First, these higher levels of cytotoxicity were attributed to the effect of NPs carrying the drug into cells via endocytosis. Secondly, the increased cationic nature of CS-decorated NPs was an important factor in the cytoplasmic environment of cancer cells which always has low pH conditions. Therefore, these results suggest that the use of CS-surface-modified PLGA NPs as carriers might be promising for better therapeutic effects on cervical cancer cells.
Conclusion
In conclusion, PLGA NPs and CS-PLGA NPs were successfully prepared with a suitable particle size and spherical shape. Moreover, the impacts and interactions of processing parameters by all three softwares, Modde, FormRules, and INForm, suggest similar patterns about the relationships of inputs on outputs. INForm software is an appropriate tool to be used alone to generate models and predict the optimal formulation; however, FormRules2.0 and Modde can be used to further evaluate the significant levels of factors.
The optimal CS-PLGA NPs had a Z of 161.53 ± 0.97 nm, PDI of 0.270 ± 0.007, Zeta of 41.87 ± 1.42 mV, and a high EE (%) (98.58 ± 0.22%). CS-PLGA NPs controlled drug release better than PLGA NPs. The in vitro cytotoxicity experiments indicated that CS-PLGA NPs enhanced in vitro anti-cancer activity compared to the PLGA NPs. Furthermore, CS was reported to improve the uptake and apoptotic property of CS-PLGA compared to the uncoated NPs. Our results suggest that CS-PLGA NPs could be a promising tool for PTX drug delivery to achieve therapeutic efficacy in both human lung cancer and cervical cancer cells.
