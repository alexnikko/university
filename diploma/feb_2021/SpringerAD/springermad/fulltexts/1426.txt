Background
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the 5th most common malignancy worldwide and the 3th most common cause of cancer-related death, with nearly 600,000 deaths occurring each year [ , ]. Potentially curative treatments for HCC include liver resection and liver transplant, but the 5-year post-operative survival rate is still low [ , ]. The poor prognosis of HCC is largely due to the occult metastatic rate and easy recurrence after operation [ ]. A slew of tumor-associated genes were discovered, but the underlying functionary mechanisms are not yet fully elucidated [ ].
Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) have been confirmed as a key player in various diseases and especially in tumors [ , ]. NcRNAs are RNA transcripts that do not encode any protein, which divided into two classes of different lengths: long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs). LncRNAs are described as more than 200 nucleotides highly conserved ncRNAs. Emerging evidences indicate that lncRNAs play roles in various biologic functions of HCC [ ], and therefore have been considered as new regulators in the HCC biological processes. MIR31HG (NCBI Accession No: NR_027054) is a newly discovered lncRNA with the length of 2166 nt. Existing report shows that MIR31HG expression levels were dysregulated in various cancers, such as breast cancer, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, colorectal cancer and gastric cancer [ , , , , ]. However, there was no report on the expression pattern and biological functions of MIR31HG in HCC, which need to be further study.
As a class of the ncRNAs, miRNAs by now have been widely researched and their function in the development of HCC has been confirmed [ , , ]. Recent study reported that there is fascinating reciprocally regulation between miRNAs and lncRNAs [ , ]. And lncRNA could function as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) in regulating the expression pattern and biological characteristic of miRNA [ , , ]. It is identified that MIR31HG harbors miR-575 binding sites by bioinformatics analysis. In addition, miR-575 was found to exhibit a high expression in non-small cell lung cancer and gastric cancer tissues [ , ]. However, the expression and biological function of miR-575 in HCC still remain unknown, and the miRNA sponge role of MIR31HG in HCC has not been investigated.
In present study, we identified that MIR31HG suppressed HCC proliferation and metastasis in vitro and in vivo, and explore the biological roles of miR-575 in HCC. Furthermore, mechanistic analysis revealed that MIR31HG functioned as a miRNA sponge to positively regulate the expression of suppression of ST7L through sponging miR-575. Together, our study elucidates the role of MIR31HG as regulations of HCC progression. Meanwhile, lncRNA-miRNA functional network in HCC and the mechanisms underlying its function in HCC cells were also revealed, which sheds new light on lncRNA-directed diagnostics and therapeutics in HCC.
Methods
Cell culture and human tissue samples
The HCC cell lines SMMC7721, HepG2, Huh7, SK-hep1; normal liver cell line L02 and Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) 293 T cells were obtained from the Academy of Sciences of China. And all cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, BI, ISR) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, BI, ISR) at 37 °C in a 5% humidified environment of CO 2 and 95% air. 42 pairs of HCC and tumor-adjacent tissues were resected from the patients during surgery at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University. All patients in present research met the following inclusion criteria: Resected samples were identified as HCC by pathological examination; no radiotherapy or chemotherapy was given before surgery. The protocols used in this study were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Chongqing Medical University and written informed consents were acquired before operations from all patients. Overall survival was defined as the interval between resection and death or the last follow-up visit. Curative resection was defined as the removal of all recognizable tumor tissue with a clear microscopic margin. All patients took positive preventive measures during the operation, which is also crucial for prolonging tumor free survival. Active comprehensive treatment was performed after operation and reoperation was performed on recurrent patients.
Plasmid construction and transfection
MIR31HG full length (pcDNA3.1-MIR31HG) plasmid and controls (pcDNA3.1), pre-miR-575 and controls (pre-NC), anti-miR-575 and controls (anti-NC) were synthesized (GenePharma, Shanghai, China). Two shRNAs targeting MIR31HG were cloned into pGreenPuro™ Vector (System Biosciences, CA, USA). The shRNAs sequences are shown as below: sh-MIR31HG-1: GCAGGUAGAGAUGGAUU CCUGGAAA, sh-MIR31HG-2: GGAGCGCUUUGUGUGAGAAGUUGAA. Then plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) as the transfection reagent according to the manufacturer’s manual. The applicable stably transfected cells of pcDNA3.1-MIR31HG and pcDNA3.1 were selected using G418 screening, while stable cells transfected with sh-MIR31HG and sh-NC were selected with puromycin (1 μg/ml).
RNA isolation and real-time PCR analysis
Total RNA were isolated by Trizol reagent (Life Technologies Corporation, Carlsbad, USA) followed by RNA concentration and quality were measured using a NanodropSpectrophotometer (ND-2000, Thermo, USA). The cDNA were generated using the PrimeScriptTM RT reagent Kit (Takara, Dalian, China), miRNA cDNA synthesis kit(CWBIO, Beijing, China)and gene-specific primers or random primers. qRT-PCR was using FastStart essential DNA Green Master (Roche, Indianapolis, USA) and miRNA qPCR Assay Kit (CWBIO, Beijing, China) and performed in iCycler iQ Real-Time Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, USA). Glyceraldehyde- 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and snRNA U6 were served as endogenous controls for lncRNA /mRNA and miRNA expressions, respectively. The relative expression was calculated using the delta-delta Ct method. And the Primer sequences are displayed in Additional file 1 : Table S1.
Western blotting analysis
Ice-cold RIPA lysis buffer (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) including protease inhibitors was used to extracted the total proteins from the cells and tissues, proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 12% polyacrylamide gel and then electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinyllidene fluoride membrane (Merck Millipore, MA, USA). Membranes were subsequently blocked with 5% non fat milk in TBST buffer for 2 h at room temperature, incubated overnight at 4 °C with the appropriate primary antibodies as follows: ST7L (1:1000, Proteintech, Wuhan, China), GAPDH (1:5000, Proteintech, Wuhan, China), then the membranes were incubated with correlated secondary antibodies (Proteintech, Wuhan, China) for 2 h at room temperature. Specific protein bands were detected using a ChampChemi imaging system (Beijing Sage Creation Science, Beijing, China).
Isolation of cytoplasmic and nuclear RNA
Cytoplasm and nuclear RNA of SMMC7721 or HepG2 cells were separated and extracted with the Cytoplasmic & Nuclear RNA Purification Kit (Norgen, Belmont, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Next, the expression proportions of specially designated RNA molecules between the cytoplasm and nucleus fractions were evaluated by qRT-PCR. And GAPDH served as the cytoplasm control, and U6 served as the nucleus control.
Cell proliferation assay
We conducted cell proliferation assays using the CellTiter 96® Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation kit (MTS, Promega, USA). 24 h post-transfection, cells were seeded at 1 × 10 3 cells/well in 96-well plates. At the end of each period, 20 μl MTS were added into each well and then incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The absorbance was read at 490 nm on a spectrophotometric plate reader (Synergy2, BioTek, USA).
Colony formation assay
After transfection, SMMC7721 or HepG2 cells were seeded into 6 well culture-plates at a density of 1 × 10 3 cells/well and maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS. After incubation at 37 °C for 14 days, plates were washed with ice-cold PBS, colonies were then fixed with methanol and stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 30 min and counted.
Wound-healing assay
After transfection, cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 5 × 10 5 cells/well. Wounds were produced by scratching cell layer using a sterile 200 μl plastic pipette tips. Cells were further cultured with medium containing 1% FBS and allowed to migrate into the denuded area for 36 h, images were acquired by microscope (Leica, Beijing, China) at 50 × magnification.
Cell migration and invasion assay
For the migration and invasion assays, we used 24-well chambers with 8 μm pore size (Corning, NY, USA). SMMC7721 or HepG2 cells (at a density of 5 × 10 4 cells/well in 100 μl of serum-free media) were seeded into the top chamber without or pre-coated with matrigel (BD, Franklin Lakes, USA) in migration or invasion analysis respectively, 600 μl medium containing 10% FBS was placed in the lower chamber. After incubation for 24 h, cells on the upper chambers were wiped off using a cotton swab, and the lower membrane surface was were fixed with methanol, stained with Giemsa, and then counted under a microscope (ZEISS, Germany) at 200 × magnification.
Dual luciferase reporter assay
Cells were seeded at 3 × 10 4 cells/well in 24-well plates and cultured overnight. The next day, SMMC7721 and 293 T cells were co-transfected with PGL3- MIR31HG-WT (or -MUT) or ST7L 3′-untranslated region (UTR) -WT (or -MUT) reporter plasmids and pre-miR-575 (or pre-NC). 48 h after transfection, the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was used to detect the relative luciferase activity.
RNA immunoprecipitation
Magna RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) kit (Millipore, Billerica, USA) was used for the RIP experiments following the manufacturer’s protocol. All the cell lysate were incubated with RIP immunoprecipitation buffer containing magnetic beads conjugated with Ago2 antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) and NC normal mouse IgG (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA). Then, Co-precipitated RNAs were obtained and analyzed by qRT-PCR analysis.
In vivo nude mouse models
All BALB/c nude mice (4–6 weeks old, male) were maintained under pathogen free conditions and all procedures for the vivo nude mouse study were approved by the Animal Care Committee of Chongqing Medical College. For the tumor xenografts experiments, stable SMMC7721 cells (1 × 10 7 , 200 μl) transfected with pcDNA3.1, pcDNA3.1-MIR31HG, sh-NC or sh-MIR31HG were subcutaneously injected into mice ( n = 4 per group). Tumor volume was measured every 7 days, and the volume was calculated by the formula: length × width 2 ×0.5. 35 days after injection, mice were euthanized, and the tumors were isolated, photographed and partially processed for qRT-PCR, Western blotting and partially fixed for immunohistochemical staining. For the tumor metastasis experiment, stable SMMC7721 cells (1 × 10 7 , 200 μl) transfected with pcDNA3.1, pcDNA3.1-MIR31HG, sh-NC or sh-MIR31HG were injected into the livers of 4 mice, which were euthanized 8 weeks after injection. Then, the livers and lungs were excised, photographed, fixed and stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H&E).
Immunohistochemistry study
Immunostaining was performed on the paraffin-embedded tumor tissues from nude mice. ST7L antibody (1:200, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and Ki67 antibody (1:500, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) were used in immunohistochemistry with the method of streptavidin-peroxidase conjugated. Sections were visualized under a microscope at 400 × or 200 × (ZEISS, Germany).
Statistical analysis
Data analysis was performed using SPSS 17.0 software (SPSS, Chicago, USA) and GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Data were represented as mean ± standard deviation based on at least three times. Group difference was assessed using Student’s t test. A P value < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
Results
MIR31HG were downregulated in HCC cell lines and tissues and was associated with the poor survival of patients, and was predominantly localized in the cell cytoplasm
Firstly, qRT-PCR analysis was used to investigate the MIR31HG expression in HCC cells. Result showed that MIR31HG expressions were remarkably decreased in HCC cells compared with that in L02 cells (Fig. 1a ). Moreover, the expression levels of MIR31HG were remarkably decreased in HCC tissues compared with their adjacent non-tumor tissues (Fig. 1b ). To further explore the clinical significance of MIR31HG expression in HCC, we divided all the patients into two groups according to MIR31HG expression: the MIR31HG high expression group (above the median MIR31HG expression, n = 21) and the MIR31HG low expression group (below the median MIR31HG expression, n = 21). The correlation between MIR31HG expression and clinical features was analyzed and summarized in Table 1 . There was no significant correlation between MIR31HG expression with patient’s age, gender, HBs antigen, HCV antigen, serum AFP, liver cirrhosis, differentiation and alcohol intake in 42 HCC cases. However, we observed that the expression level of MIR31HG was positively associated with tumor size ( P = 0.0268), tumor nodule number ( P = 0.0477), vascular invasion ( P = 0.0332), and TNM ( P = 0.0308) in HCC patients. To determine the potential relationship between MIR31HG expression and the patients’ prognosis, Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to evaluate the effects of MIR31HG expression on overall survival. The results indicated that patients with lower MIR31HG expression had a significantly poorer prognosis compared to patients with higher MIR31HG expression ( P = 0.0395) (Fig. 1c ). Subcellular fractionation and qRT-PCR analysis showed that MIR31HG was mainly located in the cytoplasm of SMMC7721 and HepG2 cells (Fig. 1d, e and f ). These results suggested that MIR31HG might be critically involved in the HCC development.

MIR31HG inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion of HCC
To evaluate the biological effect of MIR31HG on HCC development, plasmid expressing MIR31HG (pcDNA3.1-MIR31HG) and shRNA inhibiting MIR31HG (sh-MIR31HG) were constructed and their efficiencies were confirmed (Additional file 2 : Figure S1a). MTS assays showed that the overexpression of MIR31HG suppressed the proliferative capacities of SMMC7721 and HepG2 cells compared with the parallel cells containing empty vector, whereas an opposite result was found when MIR31HG expression was silenced (Fig. 2a ). Moreover, MIR31HG overexpression reduced the colony formation capacities of SMMC7721 and HepG2 cells, whereas knockdown of MIR31HG enhanced it (Fig. 2b ). Together, these data suggested that MIR31HG inhibited HCC cells proliferation. To determine whether MIR31HG regulated HCC cells migration and invasion, the wound-healing assay was performed. MIR31HG- overexpressing SMMC7721 and HepG2 cells underwent a slower closing of scratch wounds compared with the parallel cell lines containing the empty vector, whereas an opposite result was found when MIR31HG expression was silenced (Fig. 2c ). We then carried out experiments using transwell chambers without or with matrigel. As expected, a significantly decreased numbers of MIR31HG-overexpressing SMMC7721 and HepG2 cells were observed on the outside membranes of the transwell chamber without or with matrigel, compared with that of parallel cell lines containing the empty vector, whereas an opposite result was found when MIR31HG expression was silenced (Fig. 2d and e ). These data suggested that MIR31HG inhibited HCC cells migration and invasion. Overall, the above results demonstrated that MIR31HG inhibited HCC cells proliferation and metastasis in vitro. Fig. 2 MIR31HG inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion of HCC. a Proliferations of HCC cells were assessed by MTS assays after transfection with pcDNA3.1, pcDNA3.1-MIR31HG, sh-NC or sh-MIR31HG. b Clone formation assay of differently treated HCC cells. c The healing abilities of MIR31HG in SMMC7721 and HepG2 cells were determined with Wound healing assay (magnification, 50 ×; scale bar, 500 μm). d and e Quantification number of migration and invasion cells with different expression levels of MIR31HG (magnification, 200 ×; scale bar, 125 μm).

MIR31HG was a target of miR-575
As a newly described regulatory mechanism, lncRNA can function as a miRNA sponge in regulating the expression pattern and biological functions of miRNA [ ]. The potential targets of MIR31HG were predicted by the bioinformatics databases (DIANA-LncBase). We observed several potential miRNAs had putative binding sites with MIR31HG, such as miR-361-3p, miR-342-3p, miR-377-3p, miR-575 and so on (Table 2 ). And compared with other potential miRNAs, the expression level of miR-575 was the lowest in the HCC cells that MIR31HG overexpressed (Additional file 3 : Figure S2a). To quantify our prediction that miR-575 could target to MIR31HG, we firstly detected the expressions of miR-575 in SMMC7721 and HepG2 cells which were transfected with pcDNA3.1-MIR31HG or sh-MIR31HG respectively by qRT-PCR. And results showed that the expression of miR-575 was decreased in pcDNA3.1-MIR31HG group than in pcDNA3.1 group, whereas the expression of miR-575 was increased in sh-MIR31HG group compared with sh-NC group (Fig. 3a ). Furthermore, HCC cells were transfected with pre-miR-575 or anti-miR-575, and measured the expression of MIR31HG. Results showed that the expression level of MIR31HG was decreased in pre-miR-575 group than in pre-NC group, whereas that of anti-miR-575 group was increased compared with anti-NC group (Fig. 3b ).

Relative expression levels of MIR31HG and miR-575 were detected by qRT-PCR (* P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01 versus anti-normal IgG group of respective group, #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01 versus anti-Ago2 in control group)
Bioinformatics analysis of miRNA recognition sequences was conducted and the result revealed that miR-575-binding sites were presented in MIR31HG (Fig. 3c ). To explore the underlying mechanism of the lncRNA/miRNA regulatory function, dual-luciferase reporter assays were performed to determine the binding sites of MIR31HG and miR-575. The luciferase activity of MIR31HG-WT + pre-miR-575 group was remarkably attenuated compared with MIR31HG-WT + pre-NC group, but the luciferase activity of MIR31HG-MUT group was not impacted (Fig. 3d ).
To explore whether MIR31HG and miR-575 are in the same RNA induced silencing complex (RISC), we adapted RIP analysis. The expression levels of MIR31HG and miR-575 were both increased in anti-Ago2 group than in the control group. In the anti-miR-575 group, the expression levels of MIR31HG and miR-575 immunoprecipitated with Ago2 were both decreased compared with the anti-normal IgG group (Fig. 3e-h ). Taken together, the results indicated that MIR31HG could attenuate the expression of miR-575 in the manner of RISC, and there was the reciprocal inhibitory action between MIR31HG and miR-575.
MiR-575 was upregulated in HCC cell lines and tissues, and acted as an oncogene in HCC
The expressions of miR-575 in HCC cell lines and HCC tissues were measured by qRT-PCR (Fig. 4a ). MiR-575 was significantly increased in HCC cell lines than in L02 cells, and the MIR31HG levels were in opposite trend in HCC cell lines. In addition, miR-575 was upregulated in HCC tissues than the adjacent non-tumor tissues, resulting in a remarkably negative correlation between MIR31HG and miR-575 (Fig. 4b and c ). This implied miR-575 might act as an oncogene in HCC cells. Fig. 4 MiR-575 was upregulated in HCC cell lines and tissues, and acted as an oncogene in HCC. a qRT-PCR analysis of miR-575 expressions in L02 cells and four cell lines (** P < 0.01). b qRT-PCR analysis of miR-575 expressions in 42 pairs of HCC tissues and adjacent non-tumor tissues ( P < 0.01). c The expression of MIR31HG was negatively correlated with that of miR-575 ( r = − 0.6123, P < 0.01) in clinical specimens. d Growth curves of SMMC7721 and HepG2 cells after transfection with pre-miR-575 or anti-miR-575 were determined by MTS assays. e Clone formation assay of differently treated HCC cells. f The healing abilities of miR-575 in SMMC7721 and HepG2 cells were determined with Wound healing assay (magnification, 50 ×; scale bar, 500 μm). g and h Quantification number of migration and invasion cells with different expression levels of miR-575 (magnification, 200 ×; scale bar, 125 μm). (* P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01 versus pre-NC group; # P < 0.05, ## P < 0.01 versus anti-NC group)
To evaluate the biological effect of miR-575 on HCC development, plasmids expressing miR-575 (pre-miR-575) and inhibiting miR-575 (anti-miR-575) were constructed and their efficiencies were confirmed (Additional file 2 : Figure S1b). The MTS assay showed that overexpression of miR-575 promoted the proliferative capacities of SMMC7721 and HepG2 cells compared with pre-NC group (Fig. 4d ). Moreover, miR-575 overexpression enhanced the colony formation capacities of SMMC7721 and HepG2 cells, whereas inhibition of miR-575 reduced it (Fig. 4e ). The wound-healing assay showed that restoration of miR-575 increased the HCC cells migratory speed, whereas inhibition of miR-575 hindered the HCC cells migratory speed (Fig. 4f ). Furthermore, cell migration and invasion assay indicated that the migration and invasion SMMC7721 and HepG2 numbers were apparently increased in pre-miR-575 groups compared with pre-NC group, whereas an opposite result was found when miR-575 expression was decreased (Fig. 4g and h ). We surmised that miR-575, in contrast to MIR31HG, exerted oncogenic function in HCC.
MIR31HG increased the expression of an endogenous miR-575 target, ST7L
The above results showed that MIR31HG and miR-575 could regulate the biological characteristics of SMMC7721 and HepG2 cells, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. The bioinformatics methods (Targetscan and miRDB) predicted that some potential genes are downstream genes of miR-575 including NDEL1, WEE1, CHSY3, PIWIL4, and so on (Tables 3 and 4 ).

Among the targets of miR-575, we focused on ST7L, because the expression level of ST7L was the highest in the HCC cells that overexpressed MIR31HG (Additional file 3 : Figure S2b). We detected the effects of MIR31HG or miR-575 on mRNA and protein levels of ST7L by qRT-PCR and Western blot, and found ST7L expressions were apparently affected by MIR31HG and miR-575. The expression of ST7L mRNA and protein was increased in pcDNA3.1-MIR31HG group compared with the pcDNA3.1 group, whereas the expression of ST7L in sh-MIR31HG showed the contrary result, while MIR31HG-MUT had no effect on the expression levels of ST7L (Fig. 5a and b ). Besides, the expression of ST7L was decreased in pre-miR-575 group than that in pre-NC group, whereas the expression of ST7L in anti-miR-575 showed the contrary result (Fig. 5c and d ). The binding sites of miR-575 to ST7L 3’UTR were illustrated in Fig. 5e . To reveal whether ST7L was a functional target of miR-575, dual-luciferase gene reporter assays were performed to determine the binding sites of miR-575 and ST7L 3’UTR. The luciferase activity in ST7L-3’UTR-WT + pre-miR-575 group was obviously decreased compared with ST7L-3’UTR-WT + pre-NC group, whereas the luciferase activity in the ST7L-3’UTR-MUT group showed no significant difference (Fig. 5f ). Fig. 5 MIR31HG increased the expression of an endogenous miR-575 target, ST7L. a and b qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis for MIR31HG regulating ST7L expressions in SMMC7721 and HepG2 cells (** P < 0.01 versus pcDNA3.1 group; ## P < 0.01 versus sh-NC group). c and d qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis for miR-575 regulating ST7L expressions in SMMC7721 and HepG2 (** P < 0.01 versus pre-NC group; ## P < 0.01 versus anti-NC group). e The predicted miR-575 binding sites in ST7L 3’UTR (ST7L-3’UTR-WT) or and the designed mutant sequence (ST7L-3’UTR-MUT) were indicated. f Luciferase reporter assay of 293 T and SMMC7721 cells co-transfected with ST7L-3’UTR-WT or ST7L-3’UTR-MUT and pre-NC or pre-miR-575 (** P < 0.01 versus MIR31HG-WT + pre-NC group). g and h qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis of ST7L expressions in L02 cells and HCC cell lines (** P < 0.01). i qRT-PCR analysis of ST7L expressions in 42 pairs of HCC tissues and adjacent non-tumor tissues ( P < 0.01). j Western blot analysis of ST7L expressions in 4 pairs of HCC tissues (T) and adjacent non-tumor tissues (N). k The expression of MIR31HG was positively correlated with that of ST7L ( r = 0.6067, P < 0.01) in clinical specimens. l The expression of miR-575 was negatively correlated with that of ST7L ( r = − 0.6224, P < 0.01) in clinical specimens
We also detected the expressions of ST7L in HCC cell lines and L02 cells. The expressions of ST7L were lower in HCC cells versus that in L02 cells (Fig. 5g and h ). Moreover, the MIR31HG levels were in same trend in HCC cell lines, while the miR-575 levels were in opposite trend in HCC cell lines. Similarly data was found that, the expressions of ST7L were apparently downregulated in HCC tissues than in the adjacent non-tumor tissues (Fig. 5i and j ), resulting in a strong positive correlation between MIR31HG and ST7L, and a significant negative correlation between miR-575 and ST7L (Fig. 5k and l ). These data suggested that MIR31HG modulated the expression of ST7L at miR-575 mediated post-transcriptional level.
MiR-575 mediated the effects of MIR31HG on cell proliferation and metastasis
To investigate whether overexpression of miR-575 could rescue MIR31HG-regulated proliferation and metastasis on SMMC7721 and HepG2 cells, the combined transfections were conducted before the assessment of cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Because there was no difference in the expression of MIR31HG and miR-575 among pcDNA3.1 + pre-NC group, pcDNA3.1 + anti-NC group, sh-NC + anti-NC group and sh-NC + pre-NC group (Additional file 4 : Figure S3a and b), we chose pcDNA3.1+ pre-NC group as the control group. In MTS assay, the proliferation of SMMC7721 and HepG2 cells in pcDNA3.1-MIR31HG + anti-miR-575 group was remarkably decreased than that in pcDNA3.1-MIR31HG + pre-miR-575 group, whereas the HCC cells proliferation in sh-MIR31HG + pre-miR-575 group was apparently increased compared with sh-MIR31HG + anti-miR-575 group (Fig. 6a ). Moreover, the colony formation capacity of HCC cells in pcDNA3.1-MIR31HG + anti-miR-575 group was reduced than that in pcDNA3.1-MIR31HG + pre-miR-575 group, whereas knockdown of MIR31HG and overexpression of miR-575 significantly increased the colony formation capacity of HCC cells (Fig. 6b ). The wound-healing assay showed that cells transfected with pcDNA3.1-MIR31HG + anti-miR-575 decreased the HCC cells migratory speed, whereas transfected with sh-MIR31HG + pre-miR-575 increased the HCC cells migratory speed (Fig. 6c ). Transwell assays showed that overexpression of MIR31HG combined with knockdown of miR-575 in HCC cells exhibit apparently decreased migrating and invading cells compared with overexpression of MIR31HG combined with overexpression of miR-575, whereas transfected with sh-MIR31HG + pre-miR-575 increased the migrating and invading cells (Fig. 6d and e ). Fig. 6 MiR-575 mediated the effects of MIR31HG on cell proliferation and metastasis. a MTS assay was applied to evaluate the proliferation effect of MIR31HG and miR-575 on SMMC7721 and HepG2 cells. b Clone formation assay of SMMC7721 and HepG2 cells with the expression of MIR31HG and miR-575 changed. c Wound healing assay was used to evaluate the migratory ability of MIR31HG and miR-575 on SMMC7721 and HepG2 cells (magnification, 50 ×; scale bar, 500 μm). d and e Quantification of migration and invasion cells with the expression of MIR31HG and miR-575 changed (magnification, 200 ×; scale bar, 125 μm). f and g qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis for MIR31HG and miR-575 regulating the expression of ST7L. (** P < 0.01 versus pcDNA3.1-MIR31HG+ pre-miR-575 group; ## P < 0.01 versus sh-MIR31HG + anti-miR-575 group; ▲▲ P < 0.01 versus control group (pcDNA3.1 + pre-NC group))
To clarify the molecular mechanism that whether miR-575 was involved in the regulation of MIR31HG of the expression of ST7L, the combinations of transfection were performed prior to the assessment of ST7L expression. qRT-PCR and Western blot assay revealed that the expression of ST7L in pcDNA3.1-MIR31HG+ anti-miR-575 group was significantly upregulated, while the expression of ST7L in sh-MIR31HG + pre-miR-575 group was significantly downregulated (Fig. 6f and g ). These results illustrated that miR-575 played a crucial role in the effect of MIR31HG on cell proliferation and metastasis. Moreover, miR-575 was involved in the regulation of MIR31HG of the expression of ST7L.
MIR31HG suppressed HCC tumor growth and metastasis in vivo
To further determine the anti-tumorigenesis potential of MIR31HG in vivo, stable SMMC7721 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1, pcDNA3.1-MIR31HG, sh-NC or sh-MIR31HG were inoculated into male nude mice. MIR31HG injected mice showed a reduction in tumor volume and weight at the end of the experiment compared with the control groups, whereas an opposite result was found when MIR31HG-silenced SMMC7721 cells were injected (Fig. 7a, b and c ). Moreover, immunohistochemical staining revealed that Ki67 expression was decreased in the MIR31HG-overexpressing xenograft tumor tissues, whereas an opposite result was also found in the MIR31HG-silenced xenograft tumor tissues (Fig. 7d ). Furthermore, histologic analysis of resected tumor tissues suggested MIR31HG expression was negatively associated with miR-575 and positively correlated with ST7L (Fig. 7d, e, f and g ). Fig. 7 MIR31HG suppressed HCC tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. a The xenograft tumors from the nude mice were exhibited. Each group contained four nude mices. b and c Tumor weights and tumor growth curves were analyzed. d Immunohistochemistry analysis of Ki-67 and ST7L were obtained from tumors (magnification, 400 ×; scale bar, 50 μm). e The expression level of miR-575 in tumors was detected. f and g The mRNA and protein levels of ST7L in tumors were assessed. h The liver and lung collected from orthotopic tumor models were exhibited. Each group contained four nude mices. i and j Representative images of H&E reveal tumor metastases in the liver and lung of nude mice (magnification, 200 ×; scale bar, 125 μm). k The number of liver nodules was calculated. l The percentage of mice with presence (metastatic lesion ≥1) or absence (metastatic lesion = 0) of lung metastasis was detected. (* P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01 versus pcDNA3.1 group; # P < 0.05, ## P < 0.01 versus sh-NC group)
Next, we determined the effects of MIR31HG on the metastasis of HCC in orthotopic tumor models. Our results showed that the number of metastatic nodules was decreased in the liver tissues of nude mice injected with MIR31HG- overexpressed SMMC7721 cells compared with the vector control group, while more metastatic nodules were found in livers of sh-MIR31HG group compared with its control sh-NC group (Fig. 7h ). Moreover, inhibition of MIR31HG enhanced the percent of lung metastasis compared with the control group (Fig. 7i ). Furthermore, this difference was further confirmed by the histopathological analysis with H&E staining (Fig. 7j, k and l ).
These results further confirmed the role of MIR31HG in HCC proliferation and metastasis and provided more validation for therapeutic strategy targeting MIR31HG in HCC treatment.
Discussion
This study is the first direct investigation of the expression pattern and biological function of MIR31HG in HCC. In the present study, we found that MIR31HG were downregulated in HCC cell lines and tissues. Furthermore, MIR31HG suppressed cell proliferation and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Besides, miR-575 was upregulated in HCC cell lines and tissues, and acted as an oncogene in HCC. Mechanistically, MIR31HG functioned as a ceRNA by sponging miRNA-575 to modulate ST7L expression.
MIR31HG has been shown to act as either oncogenic factors or tumor suppressors, with their specific functions based on different biological processes. In breast cancer, knockdown of MIR31HG decreased cell proliferation, induced apoptosis and inhibited migration and invasion [ , ]. The oncogenic function has also been found in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma [ ]. However, in colorectal cancer and gastric cancer, decreased MIR31HG is correlated with poor prognosis and significantly promoted tumor cell proliferation [ , ]. However, the role of MIR31HG in HCC was unknown. In this study, we provided the first evidence that MIR31HG were significantly downregulated in HCC cell lines and tissues. We further identified the effects of MIR31HG on the biological behaviors of HCC cells, showing that MIR31HG inhibited HCC cells proliferation, migration and invasion. These results indicated that MIR31HG act as a tumor suppress in HCC. Moreover, the in vivo studies also confirmed that overexpression of MIR31HG suppressed tumor growth and metastasis in nude mice, while an opposite result was found when knockdown MIR31HG, suggesting that MIR31HG could be potentially applied in the treatment of HCC.
A wide range of existing research shows that there is a new regulatory pattern between lncRNAs and miRNAs. LncRNAs may involve in the ceRNAs regulatory network to negatively modulating the expression level of miRNA and function as endogenous miRNA sponges. To function as an effective miRNA sponge, the lncRNA should have a steady expression level, be mainly localized in the cytoplasm and accessible to the RISC effectively [ ]. For instance, lncRNA SPRY4-IT1 acted as an endogenous sponge to downregulate the miR-101-3p expression in bladder cancer [ ]. LncRNA MALAT1 could act as a ceRNA by directly binding to miR-200c and downregulating miR-200c expression in endometrioid endometrial carcinoma [ ]. The same negative correlation and regulatory and control mechanisms also present in other lncRNA/miRNA, such as H19/miR-29a [ ], SNHG6–003/miR-26a/b [ ], and Unigene56159/miR-140-5p [ ]. It was reported that MIR31HG was localized in the cytoplasm of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells [ ], and our subcellular fractionation and qRT-PCR assay also determined the similar result in HCC cells, suggesting that MIR31HG might play a role in posttranscriptional level. We supposed that MIR31HG may act as a ceRNA in HCC. To confirm this notion, bioinformatics method was conducted to investigate the potential targeted gene of MIR31HG. The results displayed that the overexpression of MIR31HG induced the downregulation of miR-575. Meanwhile miR-575 overexpression decreased the expression of MIR31HG, whereas the restoration of miR-575 increased the MIR31HG expression. The results of the dual luciferase reporter assay verified our supposition that miR-575 binds to MIR31HG in a sequence-specific manner. Furthermore, the RIP assays further confirmed the involvement of RISC in the reciprocal repression process. Consistent with the current studies, XIST exerts tumor-suppressive functions, and functioned as an endogenous sponge of miR-21 in glioblastoma [ ]. LncRNA taurine upregulated 1 and miRNA-299 both bind with Ago2 in the same RISC [ ]. LncRNA GAS5 was functioned as a tumor suppressor by repress the miR-21 expression in the same RISC [ ].
MiR-575 was located on human chromosome 4q21.22, and functioned as an oncogene in cancer, such as non-small cell lung cancer and gastric cancer [ , ]. To further explore the potential function of miR-575 in HCC, we determined overexpression and restoration of miR-575 on HCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. And our results showed overexpression of miR-575 promoted cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. These results indicated miR-575 plays as an oncogenic factor in HCC cells by promoting proliferation and metastasis, which may be a potential therapy target for HCC. However, the underlying mechanisms still need to be investigated.
This study further illustrated that overexpression of MIR31HG apparently increased the expression level of ST7L. ST7L gene was located at chromosome 1p13, and clustered with the WNT2B gene by a tail-to-tail manner in a chromosomal region [ ]. ST7L was homologous to the tumor-suppressor gene ST7 and has been characterized as an antioncogene. Published studies have shown that ST7L was downregulated in cancers such as glioma and cervical cancer, and suppress the biological function of cancer cells by inhibit β-catenin pathway [ , ]. Other studies also showed that ST7L exerted tumor suppressor role in HCC though inhibiting AKT/GSK3β/β-catenin signaling [ ]. Our results demonstrated that ST7L was the target gene of miR-575. Overexpression of miR-575 decreased the ST7L expression, whereas the restoration of miR-575 increased the ST7L expression. Furthermore, we also have revealed that miR-575 could directly target ST7L 3’UTR to repress ST7L expression at post-transcriptional level in HCC. Interestingly, MIR31HG and ST7L 3’UTR bind to the same binding sites on miR-575. To investigate whether miR-575 played a part in the MIR31HG-mediated expression of ST7L, the combinations of transfection were performed, and the results indicated that knockdown of MIR31HG combined with overexpression of miR-575 most apparently reduced ST7L expression, suggesting that ST7L could have an essential role in MIR31HG-mediated tumorigenesis.
Moreover, we researched whether miR-575 mediated the effects of MIR31HG on the proliferation and metastasis of HCC cells. The results revealed that decreased miR-575 could significantly enhance the effects which overexpression of MIR31HG exerted. Meanwhile, promoting miR-575 greatly enhanced the oncogenic effects of MIR31HG knockdown in HCC. Therefore, it would highlight the necessity and significance of the interaction between miRNAs and lncRNAs in tumor progression that MIR31HG suppressed HCC proliferation and metastasis mainly by inhibiting miR-575, which suggesting that MIR31HG/miR-575 reciprocal inhibition feedback loop could potentially be applied in HCC therapy.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we identified MIR31HG as a tumor suppressor, which play a key role in HCC proliferation and metastasis. Besides, our study confirmed that the interaction between MIR31HG and miRNA in HCC for the first time, and revealed that MIR31HG positively regulated post-transcriptional expression of ST7L by sponging miR-575 in HCC. This MIR31HG/miR-575/ST7L regulatory network may shed light on tumorigenesis in HCC and may be contribute to the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic methods for HCC.
