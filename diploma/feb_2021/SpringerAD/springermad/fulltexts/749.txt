Introduction
Primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) are a heterogeneous group of rare genetic disorders of the immune system. There are 354 distinct disorders with 344 different gene defects identified to date [ ]. New discovery and understanding of PIDs are improving through the use of multicenter studies and expert committees. In an update on the classification from the International Union of Immunological Societies (IUIS) Expert Committee for PIDs in 2017, new gene defects were reported in the 2 years since the previous version was released in 2015 [ , ]. The incidence of PIDs is estimated to be low, although the true incidence is not known. Among these, severe combined immune deficiency (SCID), the most severe PID, was reported as occurring in 1 in 58,000 live births in a newborn screening in the USA. Incidences of chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) were reported as 1 in 250,000 and 1 in 100,000 to 1,000,000 male subjects, respectively [ ]. In Korea, the true incidence of SCID is not known. However, the first pilot study for SCID screening by measuring the T cell receptor excision circle and B cell deficiency screening test by measuring the к-deleting recombination excision circle in neonates was recently reported by our group [ ], and a multicenter study is currently on-going.
Patients with PIDs are vulnerable to life-threatening infections, which can be fatal unless treated. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) has led to a great improvement in their survival since the first transplantation attempts in patients with SCID and WAS [ , ]. The allogeneic HCT has become the only treatment option for certain lethal PIDs [ , , ]. The numbers of allogeneic HCTs for PIDs and centers are rising [ ]. Transplantation using a genoidentical sibling donor was reported to result in survival of 90% of patients with SCID and 79% of patients with non-SCID from 2000 to 2005 in a large multicenter European study [ ]. Allogeneic HCT could be continuously provided as the first line treatment until it is replaced by gene therapy.
In Korea, the awareness on PID has been increasing, and more PID patients have opportunities to receive HCT for treatment. Therefore, more comprehensive data after HCT in PID patients are needed for outcome improvement. In this study, we aimed to report more detailed outcomes of allogeneic HCT recipients with PIDs from a single-center experience and to analyze the factors associated with survival.
Methods
Study Patients and Transplantations
A retrospective chart review was performed in children with PIDs who received allogeneic HCT at Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea from 2006 to 2016. In our pediatric stem cell transplant unit, we perform an average of 100 pediatric HCTs per year and recently, the number of HCTs in patients with non-malignant diseases including PID has accumulated. To explore changes in characteristics and outcomes in transplantations, patients were classified into two groups, as the first half period (from January 2006 to June 2011) and the second half period (from July 2011 to December 2016), according to when HCT was performed.
The human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling donor (MSD) was the first choice of donor. Patients who lacked an MSD received the transplantation from an unrelated donor (URD) including the adult donor or cord blood. Familial mismatched donor transplantation (FMMDT) was considered for patients without available MSD or URD. HLA compatibility was determined by high-resolution typing for HLA-A, -B, and -DRB1. HLA-C was evaluated by serotyping for MSD. In the case of URD, HLA-C was evaluated by serotyping until June of 2008 and by high-resolution typing thereafter. One mismatch was allowed in unrelated HCT. CBT grafts were matched with at least four of six HLA-A and -B at the antigen level and -DRB1 at the allele level to the recipient. Double unit CBT was performed when available if no suitable cord blood unit with nucleated cell counts > 3.0 × 10 7 /kg or CD34 + cell count > 1.7 × 10 5 /kg was available.
All recipients underwent busulfan-based myeloablative chemotherapy as a conditioning treatment before stem cell infusion. The graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was cyclosporine alone for transplantation from sibling bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) and cyclosporine combined with methotrexate for transplantation from unrelated BM or PBSC. CBT or FMMDT recipients were treated with cyclosporine with or without mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or methotrexate at the discretion of the pediatric transplant team according to their clinical situation. GVHD prophylaxis was continued for at least 6 months after HCT and was stopped if patients did not show significant GVHD-related symptoms. Rabbit antithymocyte globulin (ATG) was administered to patients who underwent unrelated PBSC transplantation, FMMDT, or CBT. Other GVHD prophylaxis including post-transplant cyclophosphamide or ex vivo T cell manipulation was not offered to recipients with FMMDT.
Definitions
To define the hematopoietic reconstitution, the neutrophil recovery was defined as the estimated time from transplantation to the first of 3 consecutive days when an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of at least 0.5 × 10 9 /L was obtained. The platelet recovery was defined as achievement of a platelet count of 20 × 10 9 /L without support of transfusions for 7 consecutive days. The engraftment failure was defined as the lack of donor-derived neutrophil recovery or the requirement for either a boost from the same donor or a second transplantation for lack of neutrophil recovery. The diagnosis and the grading of acute and chronic GVHD were based on the standard clinical criteria [ , ]. Only recipients who survived for at least 100 days with sustained engraftment were evaluated for chronic GVHD. The post-transplantation engraftment analysis was performed at 28, 56, 100, 180, and 365 days after transplantation with short tandem repeats (STRs)-based chimerism analysis. STRs-based chimerism analysis was studied using peripheral blood at 56 days and a BM sample at other time points. The complete donor chimerism was defined when more than 99% of DNA in a sample specimen of the recipient was derived from the donor. When between 1 and 99% recipient DNA was derived from the donor, mixed chimerism was considered [ ]. In the case of patients who experienced engraftment failure, post-transplantation engraftment analysis, and acute and chronic GVHD after the last transplantation were analyzed once engraftment was achieved.
Statistics
Clinical characteristics of the study population and outcomes were compared according to the period when HCT was performed using Fisher exact tests for categorical variables and the two-sample t test or Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables. OS was estimated from the date of first stem cell infusion to the death due to any cause with the Kaplan-Meier method and was compared according to characteristics of patients to find factors associated with survival using the log-rank. Multivariate analysis with the Cox proportional hazard regression model was performed using variables with a P value of 0.1 or less in univariate analysis to determine independent factors for survival.

Characteristics of Study Patients
Characteristics of the study patients are summarized in Table 1 . Only first HCT information was included and is presented in Table 1 for patients who received multiple HCTs. Among a total of 26 patients, nine received HCT during the first half period and 17 during the second half period. Male predominance (80.8%) was observed. CGD was most common in the entire study population (42.3%).

Missing data for CMV serostatus ( n = 3)
The proportions of unrelated HCT and FMMDT increased from 55.6 to 70.6% and from none to 23.5%, respectively, while the proportion of sibling transplantation decreased from 44.4 to 5.9% ( P = 0.034). ATG was increasingly used during the second half period (44.4 vs. 88.2%, P = 0.028). Methotrexate was added for GVHD prophylaxis more in the second period as well (22.2 vs. 64.7%).
Total nucleated cell (TNC) dose and CD34 cell dose were significantly increased in HCT using PBSC or BM over time ( P = 0.035 and 0.016, respectively). The busulfan-based conditioning regimen was used in most patients (24/26, 92.3%). Two X-linked SCID patients received transplantations without conditioning chemotherapy. Most recipients showed positive cytomegalovirus (CMV) serostatus (78.3%). Donor-recipient mismatch in CMV serostatus was observed in 10 of 23 (43.5%) patients.
Hematopoietic Recovery and Engraftment Failure
Outcomes of transplantation are summarized in Table 2 . One patient was excluded from the outcome analysis because she died 9 days after HCT. Among 25 patients, 20 patients successfully attained engraftment after the first HCT. Five patients experienced engraftment failure (two CGD, one congenital neutropenia, one SCID, one undefined PID); three were primary engraftment failure and two were secondary engraftment failure. All patients who experienced primary engraftment failure had received unrelated CBT. Three of five with engraftment failure (two primary and one secondary) accomplished engraftment after the second transplantation ( n = 2) and the stem cell boost ( n = 1), respectively. Two other patients eventually achieved successful engraftment after the third transplantation using the FMMD. Finally, all patients achieved successful engraftment. The median days (range) of ANC and platelet engraftment were 13 (9–31) and 27 (9–105) days after the transplantation, and there was no difference based on the transplantation period.

Graft-Versus-Host Disease and Cytomegalovirus Infection
Incidences of GVHD, CMV infection, and disease are described in Table 2 . About a quarter of patients experienced grade III or IV acute GVHD. The rate of extensive chronic GVHD was 34.8%. Incidences of acute and chronic GVHD were not statistically different in two periods. To search characteristics associated with GVHD, the incidences of GVHD were compared according to the donor type, HLA disparity, cell source, GVHD prophylaxis, and the number of infused TNC. Table 3 showed the results of the univariate analysis for grades II to IV acute GVHD. MSD recipients had lower incidence of grades II to IV acute GVHD than patients with URD or FMMD (40.0% vs. 87.5% vs. 100%, P = 0.038). There were no factors significantly associated with grades III to IV acute GVHD or extensive chronic GVHD. Among 20 patients with grades II to IV GVHD, all but one received systemic steroid therapy initially. For two patients who failed initial steroid treatment, infliximab was administered as part of treatment for steroid-refractory acute GVHD. While all eight patients with extensive chronic GVHD were initially treated with steroid, seven of them required at least one additional agent to control steroid-refractory chronic GVHD: MMF in four, infliximab in four, rituximab in three, tacrolimus in two, imatinib in two, and mesenchymal stromal cells in one. Half of the patients experienced CMV infection. Occurrence of CMV infection and disease was comparable in both periods.

Survival and Causes of Death
The 3-year probability of OS was 72.0% in the whole study population. Table 4 describes results of the univariate analysis for survival outcome according to characteristics. Compared to patients with sibling HCT or FMMDT, those who received unrelated HCT showed an inferior survival rate (100% vs. 58.8%, P = 0.042). The survival of patients who received a combination of CSA and methotrexate treatment for GVHD prophylaxis was significantly lower (47.5%) than that of patients administered other treatment (CSA only prophylaxis, CSA plus MMF combination prophylaxis, or no prophylaxis) (92.3%) ( P = 0.020). There were no differences in survival according to HCT period, age at HCT, stem cell source, donor-recipient CMV serostatus, or the use of ATG. In a multivariate analysis with donor types and GVHD prophylaxis as variables, neither showed statistically significant differences in survival. Figure 1 shows survival curves in the entire study population and according to donor types or GVHD prophylaxis. The 3-year OS of patients with CGD, the most common PID in our cohort, was 80.8%. To identify alleged negative effect of intractable infection before HCT on survival outcome in CGD patients, survival was compared according to the presence of infectious episodes within 3 months before HCT, which did not show significant difference.

Seven patients died, and the causes of death were bacterial sepsis ( n = 4), pneumonia ( n = 1), chronic GVHD ( n = 1), and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage ( n = 1). Their primary diseases were undefined PIDs ( n = 3), CGD ( n = 2), SCID ( n = 1), and WAS ( n = 1). Proven bacteria in four sepsis-related deaths were multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter baumanii / hemolyticus in two, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in one, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in one. A patient died of pneumonia that was probable invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and adenoviral infection. Four deaths were related to chronic GVHD (two patients with sepsis, one with pneumonia, and one with GVHD only). One CGD patient experienced extensive multi-organ involvement including the liver, lung, gut, and oral cavity, who eventually died of liver failure. The other CGD patient was treated with steroid, infliximab, and rituximab for chronic GVHD with lung, liver, gut, and ocular involvement that developed after the third transplantation, who eventually died of pneumonia. A WAS patient received steroid and infliximab for grade IV gut GVHD and rituximab for post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder and died of sepsis. A patient with undefined PID received long-term steroid therapy for extensive skin GVHD and died of sepsis. Among 22 patients who were assessed for chronic GVHD, the 3-year probability of OS was significantly different between patients with extensive chronic GVHD and those without (50.0% vs. 100%, P = 0.003) (Fig. 2 a). This difference in survival was shown between unrelated transplant recipients with extensive chronic GVHD and those without as well (42.9% vs. 100%, P = 0.022) (Fig. 2 b). Fig. 2 Overall survival according to the existence of extensive chronic GVHD in entire study population ( a ) and in unrelated transplant recipients ( b )
Donor Chimerism
STR results are shown in Fig. 3 . The probabilities of complete donor chimerism were 64.0, 71.4, 81.8, 72.7, and 85.0% at 28, 56, 100, 180, and 365 days after HCT, respectively. The probability of complete donor chimerism at 365 days after HCT was comparable in both transplant periods. The complete donor chimerism rates at 28, 56, 100, 180, and 365 days after HCT were compared according to the donor type, HLA disparity, cell source, and the number of infused TNC, all of which did not show significant association with complete donor chimerism at any time points.

Discussion
Allogeneic HCT for various PIDs has been gradually increasing globally. This is the first report in Korea with detailed HCT information with a focus on PID patients who received transplantation from various donor types to examine outcomes during 11 consecutive years. This study showed that the HCT numbers almost doubled from 9 to 17 HCTs in the second half period. More active HCTs were performed from URDs and FMMDs in the second half period (55.6% vs. 94.1%, P = 0.034), with accumulation of experience in recent years. Probability of 3-year OS in our center was observed as 72%, which is comparable to previous reports in other countries [ , , ].
Unrelated HCTs and FMMDTs increased for patients without an available MSD in this study. Along with these changes, administration of ATG and methotrexate has increased for helping with engraftment and preventing GVHD. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that the survival rate in the second half period was maintained. Because only a few children with PIDs have an available MSD, the HLA-matched URD is an important alternative. It is reported that the survival of children with alternative donors was inferior to those with sibling-donor HCT in PIDs [ , ]. However, the outcome after unrelated HCT has been improved by advances in rigorous HLA typing and supportive care for GVHD and post-transplant infections [ , , ]. Methotrexate has been widely used in conjunction with CSA to reduce GVHD for a long time [ ]. The effect of methotrexate on the incidence of GVHD compared with MMF is uncertain [ ]. There were no randomized comparative studies on the impact of methotrexate combination prophylaxis on survival of HCT recipients with PIDs. Poor survival rates in patients with methotrexate combination in this study might be influenced by the compounding factor because most patients with methotrexate combination received unrelated HCT or FMMDT. However, further studies need to examine the optimal GVHD prophylaxis in HCT for PIDs.
A considerable number of patients require other donors including cord blood or FMMDs. A retrospective study showed that CBT and FMMDT had similar outcomes for SCID patients [ ]. Researchers suggested CBT as a feasible therapeutic option for PID patients without an HLA-matched donor [ , , , ]. Previously, Korean Cord Blood Transplantation Working Party reported a summary of CBT outcomes for patients with non-malignant disorders who were transplanted from 1994 to 2008. The study described 87.0% of cumulative incidence of neutrophil recovery by day 42 and 56.0% of 5-year OS after unrelated CBT in 23 patients with PIDs and two patients with inherited metabolic disorders [ ]. Ten CBT recipients in our study showed 80.0% of OS, which is higher than the outcome in their report. This might have been affected by the difference of transplant period between two studies. In addition, consistent treatment strategy by the experienced transplant team in a single referred hospital could have led to an improved outcome. However, much care is necessary because CBT has several disadvantages including slow immune reconstitution, delayed engraftment, and lack of viral-specific cytotoxic T cells, which result in high incidences of engraftment failure and infectious disease. Donor recall is not possible in most recipients when needed. Three of 10 patients who initially received CBT experienced engraftment failure in this study.
All patients with FMMDT survived in this study. Outcomes of FMMDT have improved significantly over the past decade [ ] and have been reported to be comparable to unrelated HCT in patients with SCID [ ]. Recipients of T cell-depleted FMMDT showed the best survival among actively infected infants without an MSD in a multicenter study for SCID [ ]. FMMDT has advantages including its wide availability in almost all PID patients and usability in urgent situations that PID patients often face. Therefore, FMMDT should be considered for patients without an HLA-identical donor. FMMDT could be the best option, especially for SCID patients without an available MSD, because they are utilized in medical emergencies [ ].
Infection and GVHD were the most common causes of death. A Primary Immune Deficiency Treatment Consortium (PIDTC) study about transplantation for SCID reported that infections (39%) and pulmonary complications (37%) were the main causes of death [ ]. According to donor type, another study about SCID showed that the most causes of death were infection in MSD transplants and GVHD in URD transplants [ ]. Separated by post-HCT period, a Japanese group reported that the main causes of death were infectious diseases before day 100 and GVHD after day 100 [ ].
Compared to previous studies, the incidence of GVHD was higher in our study, which might be affected by the high proportion of PBSC and cord blood than BM and URDs or FMMDs than MSDs [ , , , , ]. Since GVHD is of no benefit for those with nonmalignant diseases, the very high rate of acute GVHD in our cohort with unrelated transplant or FMMDT is one of the major concerns and it may have led to the high incidence of chronic GVHD, which was associated with high mortality with extensive diseases in this study. Even those who survive with extensive chronic GVHD are still vulnerable to various infectious complications as long as it is ongoing. Therefore, strategies to reduce the incidence and severity of GVHD need always to be sought for these patients like PID. As shown in Table 1 , the HLA type was not fully matched in half of our URD-recipient pairs. We now consider only fully matched donor for nonmalignant diseases in an effort to reduce GVHD in URD transplants. Novel strategies to prevent severe acute or chronic GVHD are currently drawing attention especially in the absence of a matched familial donor. For example, GVHD prevention strategies, such as CD3 + TCR alpha/beta and CD19 + depletion, CD45RA depletion, and post-transplant cyclophosphamide, have been showing encouraging results in alternative donor transplants [ ]. Only ATG had been available for the GVHD prophylaxis before TCR alpha/beta depletion or post-transplant cyclophosphamide was applicable in FMMDT in Korea. Now that we have more options available for the prophylaxis of GVHD, the morbidity and mortality rates related to it are expected to be much lowered in recipients of alternative donor transplantation.
All of three patients with undefined PIDs died. Two of them had suffered from recurrent severe viral and bacterial infection and their T lymphocyte proliferation activities in response to mitogens (PHA and Con-A) were markedly decreased, which led to the diagnosis of undefined PID before HCT. The other one presented with bizarre skin lesions on her whole body with various types of maculopapular lesions, pustules, or necrotic lesions, which were refractory to steroid pulse therapy and IVIG. She was also diagnosed as undefined PID because a marked decrease in B- and T lymphocyte counts and a significantly decreased response to a mitogen were observed. Another single-center study also showed the poorest survival in undefined PID [ ]. Incomplete knowledge of pathophysiology could be associated with poor outcome after HCT.
CGD was the most common in this study. Even though HCT is a curative treatment option for CGD, there is still controversy about the best time for HCT in CGD. Three of 11 CGD patients in this study received HCT when they were 19 or older. Identical twins with CGD received FMMDT from their father at the ages of 19 and 20, respectively. Since they were diagnosed at 1 month after birth, they have suffered from infectious diseases such as fungal pneumonia, skin abscess, or suppurative lymphadenitis frequently. The other CGD patient was diagnosed at 5 years old and received HCT from his father at 26. All three patients are alive with successful engraftment. Considering the natural course of CGD patients with annual mortality of 2–5% per year and their increasingly poor quality of life, attempts for HCT in even relatively older patients also appear to be valuable.
With the exception of two SCID patients who received unconditioned HCT, the remaining 24 PID patients received myeloablative conditioning in this study. Myeloablative conditioning has been the standard regimen for many years because of the highly inflammatory nature of some PIDs. With concerns about excessive toxicity and long-term sequelae after myeloablation, there were reports of improved survival after reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) for PIDs [ , , ]. The studies were based on the suggestion that impaired immunity in recipients may make it difficult to reject grafts. However, there are still debates for mixed chimerism after transplantation in PID patients. In an international collaborative study about WAS, mixed chimerism was associated with an increased risk of incomplete reconstitution of lymphocyte count and post-HCT autoimmunity, and myeloid donor cell chimerism was associated with persistent thrombocytopenia [ ]. In addition, further studies about how much donor chimerism is sufficient to let patients become clinically stable in each PID are still required. A study about HCT in HLH demonstrated that over 20% of donor chimerism was associated with a stable and complete remission [ ]. Recently, treosulfan and fludarabine-based RIC regimen showed a good survival outcome with low toxicity in children with PID [ ]. This suggests that there is still room to overcome current limitations of RIC.
This study has several limitations. First, this is retrospective observation study with a small number of patients without any conclusive result. Because the composition of PIDs was heterogeneous, characteristics or outcomes of HCT in each particular PID could not be sufficiently covered. This is a single-center study. Our result could not be universally applicable because of the uniqueness of each transplant center. Nevertheless, this study presented meaningful comprehensive results about changes according to the period and transplant outcomes in PID patients who were treated with a consistent strategy in Korea.
In conclusion, PID patient candidates have been increasingly identified for allogeneic HCT in Korea, and the majority of them could be cured by HCT. A multicenter collaboration with a systematic PID registry in the Korean and Asian regions is also required for the improvement in outcomes of PID patients [ , , ].
