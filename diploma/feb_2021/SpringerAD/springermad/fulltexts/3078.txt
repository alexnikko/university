Introduction
Clear cell carcinoma ovarian cancer (CCOC) is a rare variant of epithelial ovarian cancers (EOCs). In Western literature, it is one of the most lethal malignancies of women [ ]. It comprises less than 5% of ovarian malignancies, and its incidence is in the range of 3.7–12.1% of all EOCs [ , , ]. Endometriosis is associated with large number of CCOC cases [ ]. Majority of them present at an early stage, but despite optimal surgery and chemotherapy, the long-term outcomes of the overall population are poor [ , , , ]. Most centres provide the same regimens for adjuvant treatment for these tumours. However, the outcome of advanced disease stays poor, due to poor response to chemotherapy [ , ]. Prospective trials looking at different regimens are rare. The utility of six cycles in early stage has also been shown to be doubtful [ ].
There is a paucity of data for clear cell carcinoma of ovary from Indian subcontinent. One publication has looked at the clinical characteristics, relapse patterns and treatment outcome from the Western part of the country. Here we present our data from the eastern part in this study.
Materials and Methods
All patients diagnosed with clear cell carcinoma of the ovary in our centre between 2011 and 2017 were analysed. Only those who had pathological confirmation in our hospital were included. Patients who had just one follow-up were excluded from the analysis of survival. We studied the clinical and pathological characteristics, disease distribution, sites of metastasis, treatment received as well as the outcome. Patients who were treated outside were staged according to the surgical details they provided as well as the histopathologic review. All but one patient who were deemed to receive chemotherapy were given paclitaxel 175 mg/m 2 with carboplatin AUC 5 every 3 weeks for six cycles as per institutional protocol. After completion of treatment, patients were followed by every 3 months with history, clinical examination, serum CA-125, with a CT scan when clinically indicated, for first 2 years, and then every 6 months for total 5 years. Survival analysis was done using Kaplan–Meier analysis, using SPSS version 23 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Log-rank test was used to compare survival rates of subgroups. Overall survival was calculated from the date of diagnosis to the date of death due to any causes. Recurrence-free survival was calculated from the date of diagnosis to the date of relapse/progression/death due to any causes.
Results
The baseline patient characteristics are shown in Table 1 . A total of 46 patients were included in the analysis. Median age at diagnosis was 51.6 years (range 29–69 years). The baseline ECOG performance status (PS) distribution was: PS 0: 47.8%, PS 1: 47.8%, PS 2: 4.3%. The baseline serum CA-125 was done in all patients, and the mean value was 541.52 U/ml (range 6–6137 U/ml).

Primary debulking surgery was performed in 37 out of 46 patients. Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy was given in seven patients of which five patients had unresectable and/or extra-abdominal disease. Two patients refused to undergo surgery.
The complete cytoreduction score was CC 0 in 50%, CC 1 in 17.4% and CC 2 in 2.2%. However, in 14 cases who had done surgery outside, the CC score was not available. Of the 31 cases where complexity score was calculated, the median complexity score was 3, with a range of 1–11.
Standard cytoreductive procedures included removal of uterus, bilateral adnexa and omentum.
Lymphadenectomy (pelvic and para-aortic) was performed in 20 (20/46 = 43%) patients. Extra procedures in the lower abdomen included pelvic peritonectomy and ureteric stenting.
In the upper abdomen, diaphragmatic peritoneal stripping was required in two patients, full thickness resection in one patient and excision of lesser sac deposits in two patients. Parietal peritonectomy was required in two patients.
The stage distribution of our patient after surgery was as follows (Table 2 ): FIGO stage I 63%, stage II 6.5%, stage III 24% and stage IV 6.5%. If we club stages I and II as early stage, then 69.5% of our patients presented at an early stage. Paclitaxel and carboplatin doublet regimen was given to 80% of patients. Out of nine patients (20%) who did not receive this doublet, two patients received single-agent platinum, one patient refused chemotherapy, one patient has poor performance status, four patients did not receive post-op adjuvant chemotherapy in view of early stage and one patient did not have chemotherapy data with us. Median follow-up of the study was 19.5 months (range 2–104 months).

Of the total 46 patients whose follow-up data were available, outcome data were available for 44 patients. Twenty out of 44 patients had recurred, and 15 out of 44 had died till the last follow-up. The median recurrence-free survival of the overall population (Fig. 1 ) was 31 months, and the median overall survival of the overall population (Fig. 2 ) was 71 months. The estimated median recurrence free survival for stage I+II combined was 79 months compared to 12 months for stage III+IV combined ( P = 0.0003 by Mantel-Cox Log Rank test). The estimated overall survival for stage I+II combined was 14 months compared to 11 months for stages III+IV combined ( P = 0.007) (Figs. 3 , 4 ) Fig. 1 Study population: recurrence free survival Fig. 2 Study population: overall survival Fig. 3 Recurrence free survival: early and advanced stage Fig. 4 Overall survival: early and advanced stage
Discussion
CCOC is a disease with different clinical characteristics, presenting features, stage at presentation, sensitivity to chemotherapy and distinct outcomes. The median age of our patients is 51.6 years, which correlates closely with the published literature from other authors from Indian and abroad [ , ]. Most of the patients (96%) had good performance status of 0 or 1. This is probably because of the fact that majority of these patients presented at an early stage. In our study, around 70% of patients had early-stage disease, which closely resembles the series from Kaur et al. of 66.6% cases in early stage. The study by Shu et al. from MSKCC showed stage I disease to be 62.2%. Another study from Taiwan showed the stage I and II rates to be 71.6% [ ]. The mean CA-125 level in our study was much higher than Kaur et al.’s (541 vs 71), although the exact reason for the same is unknown. The mean CA-125 value was higher, 1066.1 in another publication from China, which is more closely matched with our cohort [ ]. Primary cytoreduction was the most common primary treatment (78.3%), probably because most of these patients presented at an early stage. In our Western counterpart, primary surgery was more in number (96%) [ ]. This difference may be due to referral biases between the hospitals. In patients who have undergone cytoreductive surgery at our centre, we could achieve optimal cytoreduction (CC 0 and CC 1) in 67.4% cases. A majority (80%) of our patients received paclitaxel and carboplatin as adjuvant or neo-adjuvant. This practice is at par with the standard of care worldwide [ , ]. Almost half (45.5%) of our patients have recurred, and a third of the total (34%) have died. The recurrence rates by Kaur et al. were 35.2% and the death rate was 25%, which is similar to our study considering the smaller sample size in both. The estimated median recurrence-free survival in our series was 31 months, and the estimated median overall survival was 71 months. The higher overall survival in this worse subset of patients in our study is likely due to the large majority of early-stage disease and high rates of optimal cytoreduction. If we look at the individual survival rates based on early versus late subgroups, it clearly shows that the recurrence-free survival of early-stage group is 79 months, compared to just 12 months in advanced-stage group. Similarly, the overall survival is drastically different between the groups (14 months vs 11 months). This is consistent with the survival recorded in other studies. Kaur et al.’s series had overall survival of 80% for patients with early stage and 38% for advanced stage ( P = 0.01). In the series by Crozier et al., the overall 2- and 5-year survival rates were 49 and 43%, respectively. The median survival was 26 months [ ]. Stage-to-stage survival has shown that early-stage survival is more or less similar to serous counterparts. In studies by Ku and Sugiyama et al., higher stages of CCOC have worse outcomes compared to serous morphologies [ , ]. Probably resistance to platinum is the most common reason for such poor responses compared to serous carcinoma. Loss of methylation of HERV-K, HERV-E and LINE-1 has been shown to be the underlying mechanism [ ]. The above study and other studies similar to this prove that there is ample scope of improvement of survival with novel therapies. It is the time that we have to collaborate the trials nationwide for such rare histologies.
The limitation of this study is that it is a retrospective study, with a small sample size, although it should be acknowledged that it is difficult to get large numbers for such a rare histology. Since electronic database was used, there is no scope of recall bias.
