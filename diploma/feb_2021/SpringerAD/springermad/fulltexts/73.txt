Debates between complete coronary revascularization (CCR) and incomplete coronary revascularization (ICR) for patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) have lasted for several years. However, definitions of ICR were inconsistent. Diameters of target vessel were ambiguous, and the definition of significant stenosis was controversial yet in previous reports with heterogeneous results. , , , , , , , , , On the other hand, there is still no investigation comparing the long-term prognosis of patients treated by different strategies, including CCR, ICR, and no coronary revascularization (NCR, which means medical therapy only). As demonstrated in the ESC guideline, optimal selection of myocardial revascularization strategy is based on ischemic myocardium, rather than diseased vessels. Nevertheless, there is few evidence to approve the outcome of selection of complete or incomplete revascularization based on ischemic myocardium.
The therapeutic evaluation of patients with CAD was benefited from myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI), and we previously reported that, after the percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), patients without myocardial perfusion defect showed low risk for cardiac events. However, the substudy of COURAGE trial showing that patients with more than 5% reduction ischemic myocardium after PCI could not be benefited from revascularization therapy against medical therapy only. Thus, the impact of ischemia on outcomes was inconclusive.
Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to compare the outcomes of patients treated by CCR, ICR, or NCR by MPI criterion. Furthermore, we aimed to evaluate the impact of severity of myocardial ischemia on outcomes of CAD patients with these different treatment strategies.
Methods
The medical records of all consecutive patients seen from November 2007 and December 2009 for coronary artery disease, referred to Fuwai Hospital Outpatient Clinic were retrieved for analysis. Inclusion criteria were the following: (1) coronary angiography and stress-induced myocardial ischemia on SPECT MPI, and the interval between two tests was less than one month; (2) significant stenosis of the left main coronary artery (more than 50% stenosis) and/or stenosis of at least one major coronary artery; and at least one major epicardial coronary artery or a major branch with at least 70% stenosis of the luminal diameter. Patients with recent myocardial infarction (MI) (< 8 weeks), unstable angina, previous PCI and CABG, and rheumatic valvular disease were excluded.
Stress-rest SPECT-MPI imaging using 99m Tc-sestamibi was performed by our standard 2-day protocol with symptom-limited bicycle exercise or pharmacologic stress. Patients were required to discontinue β-blockers for 24 hours prior to stress testing. A dose (740-925 MBq) of 99m Tc-sestamibi was injected intravenously at peak stress. SPECT perfusion images were acquired over a 180° arc with a dual-head SPECT system (e.cam, Siemens Medical Systems) equipped with a low-energy, high-resolution, parallel-hole collimator 60 to 90 minutes later. Rest imaging was performed 24 to 72 hours later using the same dose of 99m Tc-sestamibi. Transaxial images were reconstructed using the Butterworth filtered back-projection method (order 5; cutoff frequency 0.40) and displayed as short axis and horizontal and vertical long-axis slices. Two experienced physicians, unaware of the clinical data, visually graded myocardial activity using the standard 17-segment model.
For each segment, myocardial perfusion was evaluated using the standard 5-point scoring system (0 = normal; 1 = mildly decreased; 2 = moderately decreased; 3 = severely decreased; and 4 = absent). Summed stress scores (SSS), summed rest scores (SRS), and summed difference scores (SDS) were calculated. The SDS reflects the degree and extent of stress-induced myocardial ischemia.
Myocardial ischemia was matched with coronary vascular territories using standard schematics—apex, anterior and anteroseptal segments: left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery territory; lateral wall segments: left circumflex (LCx) coronary artery territory; inferoseptal and inferior wall: right coronary artery (RCA) territory. Myocardial ischemia was defined as SDS equal to or greater than 2.
Selective coronary angiography was performed (using Judkins’ technique) on all patients within 3 months of MPI imaging studies. Two experienced observers unaware of the clinic and follow-up data visually assessed the angiograms and estimated the severity of luminal coronary artery stenosis. Significant stenosis was defined as at least 70% of the luminal narrowing in at least 1 major epicardial coronary artery or a major branch or at least 50% luminal narrowing of the left main coronary artery.
Patients treated by no coronary revascularization or by revascularization more than 3 months later after MPI test were defined as NCR group. Otherwise, patients treated by PCI or CABG within 3 months after MPI test were categorized into revascularization therapy group. As reported in our study, CCR or ICR was retrospectively determined by reviewing both coronary angiograms and SPECT images. ICR was defined only as partial ischemic segments, and partial diseased vessels were successfully treated. CCR was defined as all diseased vessels or all ischemic segments were successfully treated. If all ischemic segments were rescued, while partial diseased vessels were treated, and it should be recognized as CCR.
For example, a patient had ischemia in the LAD territory (Figure 1 ), with LAD proximal, diagonal proximal stenosis; LCx proximal, distal stenosis; RCA middle, PLA, PDA stenosis. Stents were just implanted in the LCx. The revascularization was treated as ICR. Figure 1 MPI showed severe myocardial ischemia in apex, apex-anterior, apex-septal, mid-anterior segments, involved the territory of left anterior descending coronary artery. In every set of images, the top row was the stress image, and the lower row was the rest image
Finally, all patients were divided into two subgroups of mild (SDS < 7) and moderate-severe ischemia (SDS ≥ 7) by the threshold of 10% ischemic myocardium [7/(4 × 17) ≈ 10%] for further analysis.
Follow-up was performed for at least 6 months by review of patients’ medical records, by telephone contact with patients or their relatives. The average follow-up time was 46 ± 21 months (median 46 months, range from 5 to 97 months). The primary endpoint of study was defined as all-cause death, and the secondary endpoint as MACE, including all-cause death, nonfatal infarction and repeat revascularization. All repeat revascularization was unplanned during follow-up period. Patients who suffered more than one event were censored at the date of the first one.
Continuous variables were presented as the mean ± standard division, and categorical variables as percentages. The mean values of continuous variables were evaluated using the Student t test or the Mann–Whitney rank sum test. Categorical variables were compared among groups using the χ 2 test or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate. Cumulative incidence of all-cause death and MACE was estimated by the Kaplan–Meier method and compared by the log-rank test. The Cox proportional hazards regression analysis model was used to identify independent predictors for all-cause death and MACE by univariate and multivariate analysis. All variables were first assessed by univariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Only variables with a statistically significant ( P < .05) association with cumulative incidence of all-cause death and MACE were included in the multivariate model (age, SDS, “≥ 10% ischemic myocardium” for all-cause death, SSS for MACE, and LVEF, CCR, SDS for both), which was performed by a forward stepwise method. All regression assumptions were evaluated. The normality was checked at first. Results were presented as hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). A P value < .05 was defined as significant. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software, version 15.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois).
Results
A total of 344 CAD patients were initially enrolled in the study. Patients were excluded who were concomitant with rheumatic valvular disease (N = 18), previous PCI or CABG (N = 6), unstable angina (N = 8), acute MI (N = 7). Nineteen patients (5.5%) were lost to follow-up (N = 19). Finally, the study population consisted of 286 patients (198 men; mean age 64 ± 10 years). Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics are summarized in Table 1 . Patients were assigned to no coronary revascularization therapy (NCR) or revascularization therapy by their clinicians. CCR was achieved on 112 patients (39.2%, 86 patients by PCI and 26 by CABG), and ICR on 90 patients (31.5%, 84 patients by PCI and 6 by CABG), and 84 patients (29.3%) were treated by NCR. Demographic and baseline clinical characteristics did not reveal any significant difference among three groups, except high SDS ( P = .03) was observed in ICR group. The details of endpoints observed by groups are shown in Table 2 .

As depicted in Figure 2 , cumulative incidence of all-cause death did not differ between revascularization group and NCR group (15.5% vs 15.5%; HR 1.68, 95% CI 0.81-3.49, P = .163). However, the cumulative rate of MACE in revascularization group was significantly lower than that in NCR group (22.1% vs 36.4%, HR 2.78, 95% CI 1.71-4.52, P < .001). Figure 2 Cumulative incidence of all-cause death ( A ) and MACE ( B ) in patients treated by revascularization and no coronary revascularization
Patients treated by PCI or CABG were subsequently categorized into CCR or ICR subgroups by MPI criteria. We observed superiority of therapeutic effect in CCR group by all predefined endpoints in comparison to ICR group and NCR group (mortality: HR 1.88, 95% CI 1.11-3.16, P = .018; and MACE rate: HR 2.10, 95% CI 1.50-2.94, P < .001). (Figure 3 ). Figure 3 Cumulative incidence of all-cause death ( A ) and MACE ( B ) among CCR, ICR, and NCR groups. CCR vs. ICR (all-cause death: log rank P = 0.006, MACE: log rank P = 0.004), CCR vs. NCR (all-cause death: log rank P = 0.012, MACE: log rank P < 0.001), ICR vs. NCR (all-cause death: log rank P = 0.921, MACE: log rank P = 0.034)
As depicted in Figure 4 , in patients with mild myocardium ischemia, the cumulative incidence of death ( P = .294) and MACE ( P = .054) did not significantly differ among CCR, ICR, and NCR groups. However, in patients with moderate-severe myocardial ischemia, CCR significantly reduced the cumulative incidence of death and MACE (mortality: HR 1.71, 95% CI 1.10-2.66, P = .017; and MACE rate: HR 2.08, 95% CI 1.52-2.84, P < .001). Figure 4 Cumulative incidence of all-cause death and MACE in patients with mild ( A for all-cause death, and B for MACE) and moderate-severe myocardial ischemia ( C for all-cause death, and D for MACE). There were no significant differences among CCR, ICR, and NCR in patients with mild ischemia, while the differences were significant when patients had severe ischemia
Univariate Cox analysis showed that SDS ( P = .001), ≥ 10% ischemic myocardium ( P = .009) and age ( P = .007) were independent predictors for all-cause death, while CCR ( P = .009) and LVEF ( P = .011) were independent negative predictors (Table 3 ). Multivariate Cox analysis identified that SDS (HR 1.09, 95% CI 1.03-1.15, P = .004) and age (HR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01-1.09, P = 0.027) were independent predictors for death, while CCR (HR 0.31, 95% CI 0.12-0.81, P = .017) was an independent negative factor.

Discussion
In the present study, we found that complete revascularization by MPI criteria could reduce the cumulative incidence of all-cause death and MACE in patients with coronary artery disease, compared with incomplete revascularization and no coronary revascularization, especially in patients with moderate-severe myocardium ischemia. In addition, SDS, used as a measure of the extent and severity of myocardium ischemia, was a negative predictor for long-term all-cause death and MACE.
In previous studies, it was considered that revascularization might not lead to a better outcome compared to medical therapy only. , However, the substudy of COURAGE trial showed that there were 15.8% patients remained more than 10% myocardial ischemia after PCI, and more than 5% residual ischemia was observed in 46.7% patients during the follow-up. It indicated that there were a lot of patients treated by ICR, not NCR, during the COURAGE trial. Meanwhile, it was generally accepted that ICR could lead to a worse outcome in the long-term follow-up. , , , , , ,
In all of the previous investigations, the criteria of ICR were defined according to the anatomic information but remain controversies. The diameter of target vessel was ≥ 1.5 mm, , ≥ 2.0 mm, , or ambiguous , , , , , ; the intervention threshold of stenosis was ≥ 50%, , , ≥ 70%, , , , or ambiguous. It might be one of the most important factors making heterogeneous results in previous different investigations. In this present study, complete and incomplete revascularization was defined according to measurement of ischemic myocardium by stress-rest SPECT MPI, rather than the severity of stenosis measured by coronary angiography. It was in concordance with the guidelines of myocardial revascularization, which emphasized that the protocol of revascularization therapy is closely related to the extent myocardial ischemia, not the severity of epicardial coronary disease.
In our current results, mortalities and rates of MACE did not differ significantly among groups CCR, ICR, and NCR. Furthermore, if NCR was considered as ICR (no coronary revascularization according to the criteria of angiography, or some extent of revascularization according to the criteria of MPI), advantages of CCR still remained (mortality: HR 0.28, 95% CI 0.11-0.72, P = .009; and MACE rate: HR 0.29, 95% CI 0.16-0.55, P < .001). These results were consistent with a previous investigation that MPI-guided revascularization reduced the risk of cardiac events in patients with multivessel coronary artery disease. As a result, SPECT MPI could be treated as an invasive imaging modality to guide revascularization in routine clinical practice.
It is important to use MPI to guide coronary revascularization, especially in CAD patients with severe ischemia. In the retrospective study of Moroi’s group, there were 316-pair patients (revascularization vs. no coronary revascularization) enrolled after the propensity score matching, and separated into three groups: mild, moderate, and severe ischemia, which corresponding to ≤ 5%, 6-10%, and > 10% ischemic myocardium. They found that, after 3 years of follow-up, patients with more than 10% ischemic myocardium had better outcomes if they received revascularization rather than treated by medical therapy only (cardiac events rate, 0% vs 12.3%, log rank P = .004). In contrast, patients with mild or moderate ischemia could not benefit from revascularization significantly (log rank P = .14, and log rank P = .43, respectively). This result might be different with the COURAGE trial to some extent. The COURAGE trial showed that, for patients with stable CAD, PCI might not lead to better outcomes compared with optimal medical therapy. However, the study population was consisted of a large part of patient with mild ischemia mixed with a small part of patients with severe ischemia. And it might weaken the clinic value of revascularization, because in CAD patients with minimal ischemia, found by Hachamovitch, survival was good even treated by medical therapy without early revascularization.
The results in our current study were consistent with the study reported by Moroi that patients with myocardial ischemia region over 10% treated by revascularization could have better outcomes than those received no coronary revascularization. In our prior study, we demonstrated that the presence of reversible defects was associated with the higher risk for cardiac events in comparison with irreversible defects. Our current study further compared the outcomes of patients treated by complete and incomplete revascularization. And we found that, in patients with more than 10% myocardial ischemia, CCR could significantly improve outcomes (including survival and MACE-free survival) in comparison with ICR. It emphasized again that CAD patients with more than 10% myocardial ischemia should be treated by CCR in order to improve the long-term outcomes, including PCI or CABG, while in patients with less than 10% myocardial ischemia, the cumulative incidence of death and MACE did not differ among CCR, ICR, and NCR groups and it indicated that medical therapy may be considered.
There might be a tiny difference between our and others’ study that some patients, excluded at first, were concomitant with valvular disease. This might be the regional feature. In the outcomes booklet released by our hospital, there were still 4,574 valvular surgeries (31.2% of 14,656 in general) held in 2016. However, the proportion was reduced in recent years.
Our study had several limitations. First, it was retrospective with a limited sample size and a potential selection bias, which may lead to the type I error. Second, CCR and ICR patients defined by MPI criterion showed similar clinical characteristics except imaging index (including SDS and diseased vessels). Third, the study population excluded those with acute coronary syndrome and these will need to be studied separately. Fourth, false positive SPECT MPI findings could not be avoided without proper attenuation correction, while attenuation correction caused some new problems in our current routine clinical practice with IQ-SPECT/CT system; it will need further investigation. Fifth, to be a retrospective study for years, it was not possible to identify the proportion of patients who were feasible anatomically but was not performed in CCR. Finally, neither MPI nor angiography was performed during follow-up period; therefore, the physiologic ischemic state and the anatomic state during follow-up were not very clear. These findings need further prospective or randomized controlled trials to confirm. ,
Conclusions
Our present study showed that the extent and severity of myocardium ischemia could impact the outcomes of CAD patients treated by different therapeutic strategies (complete, incomplete revascularization, and no coronary revascularization). Complete revascularization showed the best result against incomplete revascularization and no coronary revascularization, especially in patients with severe ischemia.
