INTRODUCTION
Pain is a frequent phenomenon in the postoperative period and may result in patient suffering and exposure to unnecessary risks ( ). Furthermore, acute postoperative pain may become chronic when poorly controlled. An estimated 40 million Americans who undergo surgery every year suffer from inadequate control of postoperative pain ( , ). Effective prevention and relief of pain in the perioperative period, especially acute postoperative pain, can improve clinical outcomes, avoid clinical complications, save resources, and improve quality of life ( , )⁠.
Local anesthetics (LA) have been used in the control of postoperative pain, despite their short duration of action (nerve block lasting 4–6 h) and systemic toxicity ( , ). For that, long-acting anesthetic drug delivery systems have been developed.
Bupivacaine (BPV) liposome injectable suspension (approved by FDA as EXPAREL®) ( ) is administered into the surgical site to produce postsurgical analgesia ( , , )⁠. In Brazil, BPV is commercially available as an injectable solution 0.5% for the same purpose ( ). This drug is an amine-amide with two optical isomers: levobupivacaine S (−) and dextrobupivacaine R (+), racemic mixture of 50% of two enantiomers. Regarding the more pronounced cardiotoxicity of the (R) enantiomer ( , , ), Shi et al. investigated the feasibility of development of in situ implant gel with levobupivacaine pure S (−) (LBP pure) as a safer alternative than its racemic parent. Besides this, a new LA with an excess of the S (−) enantiomeric form ( S = 75%, R = 25%) of bupivacaine is commercialized in Brazil as an injectable solution called Novabupi® (Cristalia Prod. Quim. Farm. Ltda).
This new drug (bupivacaine 75S/25R; levobupivacaine (LBPV)) with the different enantiomeric concentrations contributed to an increased residence time of the drug at the active site, without side effects, such as cardiotoxicity ( , ), and for that has attracted the attention of researchers in the development of prolonged release forms such as nanostructured lipid carriers ( ) and polymeric nanoparticles ( ).
In this same way and regardless of the administration route, the literature is replete with different examples using thermosensitive gel for sustained and prolonged drug delivery such as voriconazole ( ), simvastatin ( ), irinotecan ( ), and liraglutide ( ). This system is considered a “smart gel” and has been reported for various biomedical applications.
So, taking into consideration the information above, the aim of this study was to develop an injectable thermogel, to prolong the release of LBPV by applying into soft tissue surrounding the surgical site or into subcutaneous tissue, for the purpose of postoperative analgesia, mainly for the first 24–48 h after surgery procedure and reducing the use of other drugs.
MATERIALS AND METHOD
Poloxamer 407 (Pluronic F-127 ®) (molecular weight 98.4–146.0 g/mol), was purchased from BASF. Hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC) was obtained from Samsung Fine Chemicals (South Korea). LBPV hydrochloride was kindly provided by Cristália Indústria Química e Farmacêutica Ltda (Brazil). The ammonium bicarbonate salt (NH 4 HCO 3 ) and the potassium phosphate monobasic (KH 2 PO 4 ) were purchased from ISOFAR (Brazil). NaCl 0.9% solution was purchased from Halexlstar (Brazil). HPLC grade methanol was obtained from Merck (Germany). All solutions were prepared in purified water.
Methods
Gel Preparation
Monopolymer formulations containing 15 and 15.50% ( w / w ) P407 were prepared using the “cold method” ( )⁠, through dispersion of the required amount of P407 in saline solution (NaCl 0.9%) at 5°C, containing 0.5% of LBPV, under mild stirring. In addition, formulations containing the same P407 concentration with 0.1 and 0.2% ( w / w ) of hydroxyethylcellulose were also prepared using the method described above by Schmolka, and four more formulations were prepared containing 1.5% of LBPV, according to Table I .

Assay
There are no monographs in any pharmacopeia for LBPV including the Brazilian pharmacopeia 5th edition (Brazilian Pharmacopoeia, 2010). Thus, 2 mL of mobile phase was used to dilute each 100 μL of formulation. These samples were shaken for 5 min and vortexed for 5 s. Five hundred microliters of the solution was withdrawn, filtered, diluted, and analyzed by HPLC in previously validated methodology. The procedure was performed in triplicate.
Differential Scanning Calorimetry 0
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC; STA 449 F3–JUPITER, NETZSCH, Germany) was performed to assess the thermotropic properties and thermal behavior of LBPV, P407, and HEC, a physical mixture of LBPV/P407 (1:1), a physical mixture of LBPV/HEC (1:1), and a physical mixture of LBPV/P407/HEC (1:1:1). The samples (10–20 mg) were heated in aluminum pans with lid at a constant heating rate of 10°C/min, up to 300°C. Nitrogen was used as a purge gas through the DSC cell.
Sol-Gel Transition Temperature
The determination of the gelling temperature was performed by means of a rotational rheometer of concentric cylinders, Searle-type (Anton Paar MCR 500), with rotation of the internal cylinder, while the external cylinder remains at rest. Rheoplus ® software was used to describe the flow characteristics (v. 3.40, Anton Paar). The formulation was heated from 20 to 40°C, at a heating rate of 1°C per minute. The transition temperature was defined as the inflection point of the curve ( , , ). The storage modulus ( G ’) and the loss modulus ( G ”) were also assessed with the same apparatus. The sol/gel T was defined as the T at which the values of the storage modulus equal those of the loss modulus ( , , ) ⁠.
The gelation temperatures of the formulations were also determined by the “tube inversion method”, following Ur-Rehman et al . ( ) and Lin et al . ( )⁠. Flasks in triplicate, containing 2 mL of the formulation, were transferred to a water bath, and temperature was increased at a rate of 1°C/min from 20 to 50°C. The gelling transition was verified by inverting the flask horizontally for 2 min at the same temperature to allow the equilibrium. Gelling was considered complete when the sample no longer slid in the flask.
pH Determination
The pH of the formulations was determined by a pH meter model PG 1800 (GEHAKA®), at a temperature of 4°C, without dilution of the product.
Syringeability
The syringe work of the thermo-responsive systems was measured using a compression-mode texture analyzer (CT3 texture Analyzer, Brookfield). The formulations were carefully filled in identical plastic syringes of 1 mL, up to 30 mm in height, avoiding air bubbles. The syringe was placed vertically in a holder and the probe was lowered until the first contact with the plunger of the syringe. The probe was then lowered at a constant speed (2.0 mm/s) through a distance of 30 mm ( , , )⁠. The area under the resulting curve was used to determine the expulsion work. All evaluations were performed at 25°C with three replicates.
Texture Profile
Analysis of the texture profile of the formulations was performed using a texture analyzer (CT3 texture analyzer, Brookfield) in the texture analysis mode.
A sample of the formulation was placed in glass flasks, preventing the introduction of air bubbles. A polycarbonate analytical probe (10 mm diameter) was compressed twice inside the sample, in the APT mode, with a velocity of 2 mm/s, 15 mm depth, and a time window of 15 s between the end of the first and the beginning of the second compression. The analysis was performed for at least three replicates at temperatures of 25 and 37°C. The hardness (force required to achieve a given deformation), elasticity (ability the stretch and return to original size and shape), and adhesiveness (work required to overcome the forces of attraction between the surface of the sample and the surface of the test) were calculated from the plots of the force versus distance and force versus time ( , , ).⁠
Kinetics—In Vitro Release Study
The evaluation of the in vitro release profile of the drug from the formulations was performed by the membrane-free method ( , )⁠; 1 g of sample was transferred to a cryogenic tube and placed in a bath under heating at 37°C; after gelation, 2 mL of the receiving medium (phosphate buffer solution pH 5.0), also at 37°C, was carefully placed over the gel. 0.4-mL aliquots were withdrawn at predetermined time intervals (0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, and 120 h); the same volume was restored immediately after each collection. The quantification was performed by HPLC-UV.
In Vitro Permeation Study
These experiments on rats were approved by the Ethical Committee of the Federal University of Pernambuco (Registration no. 23076.007923/2017-61) and performed in automated Franz diffusion cells (Vision® Microette automated diffusion test system, Chatsworth, USA).
Wistar rat skin was obtained by excision, after euthanasia with a lethal isoflurane dose, and maintained in a bed with controlled temperature (37°C) during the subcutaneous application of 0.5 mL of the formulation. At the end, the skin was mounted between the donor and receptor chamber. The receiving compartment was filled with phosphate buffer + sodium azide 0.01 M, pH = 7.4, under heating with water circulation (37°C) and magnetic stirring (300 rpm). One-milliliter aliquots were collected (the percentage of LBPV was analyzed by HPLC-UV) at predetermined time intervals (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 h) and immediately replaced automatically, with an equal volume of the fresh receptor medium.
Chromatographic Conditions
A HPLC-UV-validated method was developed to determine the amount of drug in the samples. The analyses were performed in a system consisting of a Shimadzu chromatograph with CBM-20A controller, auto injector SIL-30AC, LC-30AD pump, and a SPD-M20A detector adjusted for a wavelength of 220 nm. The separation was performed by reverse-phase column Shimadzu® 150 × 4.60 mm C18 (5 μm) under a flow of 1.2 mL/min, calibrated with a 10–200 μg/mL curve. The mobile phase was comprised of methanol:ammonium bicarbonate solution, 20 mM (70:30, v / v ).
Data Analysis
The release profiles were analyzed against defined time intervals and the following models were applied according to the equations: zero order, first order, and Higuchi. The linear coefficient ( R ) was determined for each kinetic model through linear regression analysis. The model with the highest value of R was selected. The release rate value corresponds to the slope ( a ) of the linear portion of the selected kinetic model ( )⁠.
All values were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Statistical differences were determined through one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s post hoc test; differences were considered significant for p < 0.05.
Steady state flux (Jss) and lag time for each formulation were calculated; permeability coefficient (Kp) also was calculated using the following equation: Kp = Jss/C0, where C0 is the initial drug concentration.
The mathematical and statistical analyses were performed with the Calc (LibreOffice®) and Prism (GraphPad®) software.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
pH Determination and Drug Content
The ideal pH of a formulation is standardized according to the stability pH of the active components used, and the tolerance of the organism ( , , )⁠.
The values observed in Table II confirm that the formulations have a pH compatible with the characteristics of the drug, the formulations, and the organism ( , )⁠.

Differential Scanning Calorimetry
In order to verify the impact of the polymers on the thermal stability of the LBPV, possible changes in a physical mixture (melting point and decomposition of the drug) were analyzed, always supported by the DSC curves of the isolated components ( )⁠. The LBPV had two melting point peaks, at 75 and 100°C, the first being of lower intensity. The event at 250°C refers to the decomposition of the drug.
For the mixture P407-LBPV, low-intensity peaks at 75 and 100°C were observed, referring to the melting point temperature of the LBPV not solubilized in the polymer. At the same time, as there was no change in the decomposition temperature from binary mixture compared with the isolated drug, it was possible to confirm that there was no interference of the polymer.
For the HEC-LBPV mixture, the solubilization of the drug during the polymer fusion phenomenon was verified and the decomposition of this binary mixture at the 250°C was not observed. With this result, we can expect an improvement in the thermal stability of the drug in the sample analyzed, since there was no decomposition until the temperature used 300°C.
For sample with P407-HEC-LBPV, it can be stated that the thermal profile presented is a sum of the profiles of the polymers presented alone. It is clear that the polymers have no negative impact on the thermal stability of the drug (Fig. 1 ). Fig. 1 Impact of polymers on the thermal stability of the drug
Rheological Analysis
The values of the transition temperature of the sol-gel state obtained through the different methodologies are shown in Table III . Table III Formulations’ Viscosity Formulations Inflection point (°C) G ’ = G ” (°C) Inverted tube Viscosity at 37 °C (Pa.s) F1 32.9 32.82 33 194 F2 35.1 34.80 35 168 F3 34.8 35.43 37 138 F4 35.1 35.36 35 287 F5 34.6 34.45 37 416 F6 32.3 34.57 36 604 F7 33.3 33.22 38 134 F8 33.9 33.67 35 174 F9 35.1 35.09 36 214 F10 33.3 34.13 35 300
Figure 2 shows the viscosity versus temperature, where it is possible to determine the gelling temperature graphically, as the inflection point of the curve. This methodology allows observation of the increase of the viscosity as a function of temperature. Micelles organize during the heating until a maximum viscosity is reached, demonstrating the completeness of the process ( , )⁠. Fig. 2 The viscosity versus temperature
The increase in the concentration of P407 (15 to 15.5%) does not alter the transition temperature, similar to the HEC insertion, where only a mild increase in the transition temperature is observed. The presence of cellulose derivatives increases G ’ and the complex viscosity. This increase is due to inter-micellar interactions and the effect on the hydrophilic chain, as described by Dumortier ( )⁠.
Similar results were observed through a more simple methodology, as when using the tube inversion method (Table III ). The latter is a visual method and, therefore, subjective, although simple and easy to reproduce ( , )⁠. Gelation occurred slightly below the physiological temperature for all the gels. The latter is a required characteristic in order to allow the formulation to be administered through a syringe at room temperature, forming the gel after injection ( , ) ⁠.
An increase of the viscosity of the formulations was observed at 37°C, compared to the viscosity at refrigerated and room temperatures. This indicates that formation of the gel structure is induced by the temperature increase, acting on the poloxamer ( , )⁠. This mechanism of increase of viscosity is due to packing of micelles, as a result of PPO block dehydration ( )⁠.
Syringeability and Texture Profile
The syringeability is an important parameter with respect to the development of thermosensitive gels, since it probes the ease with which the formulation is expelled from the syringe, but not so low as to cause leakage of the storage material or application site ( , )⁠. The results of the test performed on a texture analyzer are shown in Table IV . No statistical difference between the formulations, regarding the expulsion force, was observed. The values obtained, namely, 9.51 N (lowest value) and 14.23 N (highest value), are within the range reported in the literature, showing that values up to 380 N are suitable for application ( , ) ⁠.

The mechanical properties (hardness, adhesiveness, and elasticity) of the formulations were also investigated and are exhibited in Table IV . These properties allow probing the formulations’ suitability as thermosensitive controlled release systems ( )⁠.
Hardness values were between 0.09–0.21 N (25°C) and 0.15–0.44 N (37°C); no statistical difference between the formulations was observed. The increase of P407 concentration and the addition of HEC did not influence hardness. The concentrations of the polymers and of the drug used in this study did not affect the mechanical properties, in contrast to other studies, where an increase of these values was observed when HEC concentrations above 3% were used ( )⁠. The relationships between the viscosity and mechanical strengths are not always directly proportional. In this context, it was verified that the hardness of the formulations F5 and F6 when measured at 25°C was identical, and because of that temperature, perhaps the systems are in the same level of structuring. However, when the hardness was evaluated at 37°, this parameter was slightly increased with the improvement of the poloxamer concentration. This result may indicate, although not statistically significant, a greater and more flexible disintegration of the preparation containing less polymer concentration.
Elasticity is the capacity to stretch and return to its original size and shape; the results showed low elasticity values, thus better characteristics, since the time required to create and structure a formulation will be less. Adhesiveness, the work required to overcome the attraction forces between sample and probe surfaces, can lead to major biological surface retention and therefore could improve clinical efficacy ( , , )⁠.
The addition of polymers caused an increase in viscosity, working as a matrix system through retention of the drug in the formulation, and causing adhesion to the tissues or organs to which it was applied. Furthermore, the greater or lower adhesiveness will be directly proportional to the concentration of mucin in the applied region ( , )⁠.
Kinetics—In Vitro Release Study
The membrane-free model used to study the in vitro release of the drug from thermosensitive gels allows the release medium to be in direct contact with the surface of the gel. The gels probably form a depot, resulting in controlled release by dissolution, increasing the duration of drug release. Due to the intended subcutaneous administration, this model is expected to be closest to in vivo conditions (being considered a biorelevant model), since the gel would come in direct contact with the extracellular fluid, mimicked in this study by a small amount of receptor solution ( , , )⁠.
Figure 3 shows the percentage of release as a function of time, for the studied formulations. Formulations F1, F2, F3, and F4 reached almost 100% LBPV release after 5 days; the same behavior was observed in more concentrated F7, F8, F9, and F10 formulations, while the other formulations containing 0.5% LBPV (F5 and F6 with 0.2% HEC) exhibited less than 40% drug release after that same period. According to Dumortier et al ., a relatively fast dissolution on P407 gels was addressed as their major advantage. The gelation procedure of this polymer can be attributed to the micellization procedure that becomes more important until the point when the micelles come into contact and no longer move ( , ). Thus, this swelling-controlled system probably functions by a process of continuous swelling of the polymer that is associated with simultaneous or subsequent dissolution of the polymer ( ). Fig. 3 Percentage of release as a function of time for the studied formulations
According to Kojarunchitt, adding macromolecules to a poloxamer gel the new polymer can reinforce the poloxamer network by scaffolding or the interaction between the micelles and the network ( ). Polymers derived from cellulose such as HPMC ((hydroxypropyl)methyl cellulose) and CMC (carboxymethyl cellulose) have demonstrated that prolonged subcutaneous release is feasible ( )⁠. Due to the drug release from P407 being controlled by microviscosity of water channels, the addition of another inert hydrophilic polymer as HEC would decrease the water amount in these channels, affecting the molecular orientation of the gel matrix ( ). This can explain the results for F5 and F6 formulations. In addition to the above and the tortuous structure formed by HEC, this polymer can form a cross-linked network gel as CMC. Because of its ionic nature, hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces between molecules of different polymers become extensive ( ).
In Vitro Permeation
Permeation studies are commonly used to evaluate the release (cutaneous transport) of drugs intended for skin application, in various dosage forms ( ). In vitro cutaneous permeation studies were performed to compare drug release in 10 different formulations. In vitro skin permeation was higher for the F1, F2, F3, F7, F8, F9, and F10 formulations, releasing over 50% of the drug in 12 h, and lower for the F4–F6 formulations, with less than 30%. When compared among formulations that contain 1.5% of the drug, all released more than 50% in 12 h (Fig. 4 ). The skin permeation profiles of F5 and F6 were significantly different when compared to the other formulations ( P < 0.05). The significant difference in the permeability of LBPV between the formulations is probably due to the higher concentration of HEC in the thermogels evaluated. The HEC drug release decreasing effect can be attributed to its ability to increase the overall viscosity of the product, as well as its ability to distort or “squeeze” the extra-micellar aqueous channels of poloxamer micelles, through which the drug diffuses, thus delaying the release process ( )⁠. These differences can be seen when the parameters of amount of LBPV permeated (Q 12h ) and the flux (J) after 12 h are compared (Table V ). Considering that the objective of this work is to obtain a formulation with a longer duration of effect at the site of application (subcutaneous tissue/areas around the surgery), the more slowly the drug permeation occurs, the better, except in the case where the drug does not leave the formulation as observed for F5 and F6. In view of this, the formulations of choice to take forward would be F10, F1, and F4 (with high, medium, and low release). Additional in vivo studies are needed to determine whether this amount and the permeation rate are pharmacologically effective.

Mathematical Modeling
The LBPV release mechanism was investigated through models of zero order, first order, and Higuchi (Table VI ). Analysis of the determination coefficients indicated the mode of release of the drug from the gels ( , , )⁠.

The release model proposed by Higuchi suggests that the release of the drug occurs through diffusion. Thus, it can be concluded that the rate-determining step of the LBPV release from the thermogel is the diffusion of the drug through the P407 micelles ( , )⁠, combined with the diffusion of the drug through the hydrogels until reaching the site of action ( ).⁠
Moreover, evidence has been found that P407 micelles work as a reservoir for the release of substances and are, therefore, useful for prolonged drug release in semisolid systems ( )⁠. In addition, more concentrated gels dissolve more slowly, due to the decrease of the water diffusion coefficient in the gel ( )⁠. However, the differences relative to the release of products with lower concentration are due to the presence of HEC ( , , )⁠.
CONCLUSION
Gel polymeric systems were developed using well-known polymers. DSC analysis indicated compatibility between the polymers and the drug. These gels were found to have a satisfactory gelling temperature, as well as syringeability and mechanical properties (hardness, elasticity, and adhesion). The rheological study of the formulations indicated that the gels exhibited pseudoplastic rheology, as shown by shear thinning and a decrease in viscosity at increased angular velocity. In vitro skin permeation studies, and release kinetics studies, indicated a Higuchi model to be the most suitable. Overall, it is concluded that it was possible to develop thermogels that can maintain the release of the drug for a long period of time, likely decreasing side effects and avoiding the need for supplementary analgesia by other routes; additional in vivo studies are of course needed to determine whether this amount and the permeation rate are pharmacologically effective.
