Introduction
Bacillary syndrome or shigellosis is mostly caused by Shigella species, a member of Enterobacteriaceae family, and identified as the etiologic agent since 1897 (Garza-Mayers et al. ; Jennison and Verma ; Jin et al. ). Shigella is a gram negative, facultative anaerobe, inordinately skillful enteric bacterial pathogens, mainly induced diarrhea by occupying and disseminating into the follicle linked membranous cells, through using the type III secretion system, which necessitates forking out virulence factor into infected cells (Garza-Mayers et al. ; Perdomo et al. ). Most of the common features and genetic relatedness found to the member of the genus Escherichia apparently indicate a subtype of E. coli (Jin et al. ). Contaminated water is the most common source of Shigella and a fecal–oral route is the ordinary path of contagion which is increased via unhygienic conditions (Hale and Keusch ; Jennison and Verma ). Estimation resulted that about 164.7 million people develop shigellosis per year throughout the world and approximately 1.1 million fallen into the deaths. In underdeveloped countries, approximately 163.2 million personnel are affected by shigellosis or bacillary dysentery per annum, of which most of them are children under the age of five estimating 69% (Kotloff et al. ).
Shigella flexneri, S. boydii, S. sonnei and S. dysenteriae are the four species of Shigella where higher death rate caused by S. flexneri in the majority of developing countries (Bennish and Wojtyniak ; Jennison and Verma ).
Each of the species also divided into several serotypes relies on the variations of biochemical test and O -antigen. S. flexneri possess—13 serotypes, S. dysentery —12, S. boydii —18 and S. Sonnei —1 serotype, respectively (Hale and Keusch ; Jennison and Verma ). S. flexneri has been the most commonly isolated species globally and accounts for 60% of cases in the unindustrialized countries (Kotloff et al. ). S. flexneri has the power to up-regulate acid resistance genes in the presence of low acidity which allows the low infectious dose to host. As a result, S. flexneri , especially subspecies S. flexneri 2a, is being more infectious than the other species where a few cells are able to induce disease in adult personnel. The estimated dose of S. flexneri to cause disease is 100 cells on an average (DuPont et al. ; Small et al. ).
When Shigella start to penetrate, replicate and spread into the mucosal epithelial cells after reaching the colon, the host innate immune system subsequently raises up an inflammatory response against that behavior, which leads to the destruction of the colonic epithelial layer. Shigellosis is the clinical feature of this phenomenon (Philpott et al. ). About 18.4% S. flexneri of the total Shigella isolates had been reported to CDC during the time period in between 1989 and 2002 (Gupta et al. ). Generally, 1b, 2a, 3a, 4a and 6 are the most common serotypes of S. flexneri in developing countries, whereas several enterotoxins producing 2a strains are prevalent serotype in industrialized countries (DuPont et al. ; Fasano et al. ; Kotloff et al. ). For both sporadic and endemic shigellosis, S. flexneri 2a is the primary felon in the US. According to the report of the National Communicable Disease Center, there is one-fourth of all Shigella isolates accounted for S. flexneri 2a from 1963 to 1966, whereas 11,405 isolates found in 1967 (US Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, Public Health Service, National Communicable Disease Center ; Eichner et al. ). In China, the principal causal agent of dysentery is S. flexneri serotype 2a, where 50–70% cases accounted for 2a of about 10 million affected peoples in every year (Mei et al. ). The genome of S. flexneri 2a (301) strain was sequenced in 2002. A chromosome of 4,607,203 bp and a virulence plasmid named pCP301 of 221,618 bp make up the whole genome of S. flexneri 2a (301) strain. About a sequence of ~ 3.9 Mb found similar to E. coli K12 and O157 strain. The genome contains 314 IS elements and 64 S-islands, where seven ipa H genes located in five large S-islands. For better understanding about its pathogenicity, some of the other virulence genes and their functions have been identified which are related to infections (Jin et al. ).
The treatment of Shigellosis largely depends on conventional antibiotic therapy, although the risk of shigellosis can be minimized by washing hands before handling foods. Conventional antibiotic treatment is allowed when infections reach to acute or chronic conditions. But in most cases, antibiotic treatment cannot satisfy the thrust of the therapeutic implications due to rising antibiotic resistance of Shigella species. It has been reported that Shigella spp. acclimatize resistance capability to mostly used antibiotics like ampicillin, tetracycline, streptomycin, nalidixic acid and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (Dutta et al. ). Ciprofloxacin, a third generation antibiotic is the no longer useful treatment for shigellosis in South Asian countries including Bangladesh (Talukder et al. , ). As there is no vaccine available that can provide adequate protection against this infectious agent and the current preventive treatment schemes are found to be inadequate, it strongly suggests that there is an urgent and continuing need to find new drugs and vaccine candidates to undertake this baneful agent.
A lot of novel scheme for the identification of bacterial drug targets has been pioneered by the available information of the bacterial genome sequences (Allsop ; Chan et al. ). As many drawbacks like time-consuming, costly are found in traditional drug discovery methods, advanced genome-based technology has opened an attractive choice to identify drug targets to the researchers. At the genome level, drug targets for any harmful infectious agent are currently easier due to the accessibility of each host and pathogen genome sequence information (Allsop ; Stumm et al. ). Nowadays, for the development of potential drug and vaccine targets against various infective pathogens, the most effective choice is computational based techniques (Amineni et al. ; Barh and Kumar ; Damte et al. ; Hasan et al. ; Oany et al. , ). The essential protein set for pathogen survival, however not in the host, can be identified by using subtractive and comparative genomics approach combined with metabolic pathway (Rahman et al. ). Identification of non-homologous essential genes for pathogens by subtraction from both host and pathogen metabolic pathway assures no interaction of drugs with host targets. On the other hand, the selection of conserved proteins can be emphasized by comparative genomics method among several species as the most prosperous targets (Galperin and Koonin ; Kobayashi et al. ; Koonin et al. ; Tatusov et al. ). Drug targets for many of the infectious agents can be designed by using advanced bioinformatics tools with the help of genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics.
In the present study, we have used the subtractive genomics approach to identify the potential therapeutic targets and its inhibitors through the analysis of the metabolic pathways of the pathogen S. flexneri 2a, for the identification of better treatment of shigellosis.
Materials and methods
The entire procedure for the identification of appropriate drug targets and prediction of inhibitor is shown in Fig. 1 through the schematic diagram. Fig. 1 Schematic diagram of the whole study
Pathway analysis of the host and pathogen
The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database (Kanehisa et al. , ) was explored for metabolic pathways for both human genomes and Shigella flexneri 2a (301). The identification numbers of all pathways from both organisms were listed. Thereafter, a manual comparison was made between the host and pathogen metabolic pathways. Those pathways that did not appear in the human genomes, but were present in the pathogen, according to the KEGG database annotations, were selected as unique to Shigella flexneri 2a.The remaining pathways were listed as common. Finally, amino acid sequences of proteins from common and unique pathways were retrieved from UniProtKB (Magrane ) database and stored as FASTA format.
Identification of non-homologous proteins from the pathogen
The proteins identified in unique and common pathways of the pathogen were subjected to Protein Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) analysis against the human proteome by NCBI-BLASTp program (Johnson et al. ). The hits output was filtered on the basis of expectation value (e-value) inclusion threshold being set to 0.003, and a minimum bit score of 100. Proteins, that did not have hits below the e-value inclusion threshold of 0.003, were selected as non-homologous proteins. The non-redundant and Swiss-Prot databases were used for the analysis (Oany et al. ).
Identification of essential proteins and their localization
For the identification of essential proteins of the pathogen, we used STRING ( http://string-db.org ), (Franceschini et al. ) a database of known and predicted protein interactions that work through physical and functional associations derived from genomic context, high-throughput experiments, co-expression and previous knowledge. We used STRING as an alternative to the Database of Essential Gene (DEG) due to unavailability of our target in the database. The subcellular localizations of all the essential proteins were predicted by CELLO v2.5 (Yu et al. ) and PSORTb (Gardy et al. ) server for cross-validation.
Novel target identification
Proteins located in the cytoplasm are the prioritized targets for the drug. We tried to find out novel targets from the essential proteins those are sorted initially, for better target identification. Therefore, the DrugBank (Wishart et al. ) database was used to identify the unique target. The BLASTp analysis with default parameters of the DrugBank database was used to identify the draggability as well as the unique targets. The hits were denoted as the common target and the non-hits were denoted as unique targets and used for prioritizing.
Drug target prioritization
The drug target prioritization of the novel targets was made through sequential molecular and structural criteria for evaluation of the suitability of each target for being potential drug targets (Agüero et al. ). This prioritization involved the calculation of molecular weight (MW) using computational tools available at Swiss-Prot database (Bairoch and Apweiler ). Physiological and chemical properties of the proteins are essential for considering protein as a suitable drug target, including; theoretical isoelectric point (pI), instability index, aliphatic index, and hydrophobicity (Oany et al. ). All these assessments were done with ProtParam tool of ExPASy (Gasteiger et al. ).
Determination of N -glycosylation sites in the protein is another important criterion for prioritizing drug target and linked to resistance to degradation, inferring that drug target proteins have an extended lifetime in vivo (Peter-Katalinic ). The N -glycosylation is assessed by NetNGlyc v1.0 Server ( http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNGlyc/ ). ModBase (Pieper et al. ) and Protein Data Bank (PDB) (Deshpande et al. ) were also assessed for the resolved three-dimensional structure of the targeted proteins for the further study. Finally, Supertarget ( http://insilico.charite.de/supertarget/ ) and Potential Drug Target Database (Gao et al. ) were assessed for securing the novel drug targets.
Homology modelling and model validation
Homology model of the top predicted targets were done by MODELLER v9 (Šali et al. ) and top scoring templates were selected for the model construction. Then the predicted models were employed for the validation through the PROCHECK (Laskowski et al. ) tools of the SWISS-MODEL Workspace (Arnold et al. ). Superposition between the template and the structure was also analyzed.
Electrostatic potential analysis and energy minimization
The electrostatic potential of the predicted model was built by APBS (Unni et al. ) server through transforming.pdb to.pqr file and the visualization was done by PyMOL molecular graphics system (Schrödinger ). For further securing the validation of the predicted model, the energy minimization was also done. The GROMOS 96 (Scott et al. ) force field was used for the minimization of the structure and validated by “Ramachandran Plot” statistic by using SWISS-MODEL Workspace (Arnold et al. ).
Active site analysis and virtual screening
The active site of the final proposed model was constructed by the computed atlas of surface topography of proteins (CASTp) server. This server builds a model through the pocket algorithm of the alpha shape theory (Dundas et al. ).
The virtual screening was done by a series of combinatorial approaches initiated with BindingDB (Liu et al. ) for getting insight about the potential inhibitors. Thereafter, Zinc (Irwin and Shoichet ) database which contains over 4.6 million compounds in ready-to-dock in 3D format was used for the screening purpose. Finally, PubChem (Bolton et al. ) database was also assessed for the screening compounds for further confirmation with bioactivities. The Autodock Vina (Trott and Olson ) was used for the screening based on the mother compound with a validated inhibition. All the ligands selected for the docking studies were converted into the .pdbqt format using Open Bable toolbox (O’Boyle et al. ). The grid generated for molecular docking at the center X: − 10.382, Y: 58.6496 and Z: − 29.0307. The dimensions (Angstrom) used for the docking analysis were X: 25.00, Y: 25.00 and Z: 25.00.
Ligand properties and ADMET analysis
Ligand structural and behavioral properties were analyzed for the cross-validation of the ligands as a suitable therapeutic candidate. Wide ranges of properties were analyzed including Lipinski’s Rule (Lipinski ), drug-likeness, enzymatic inhibition, molecular weight, and bioavailability. These parameters were assessed through various online server and tools including, Molinspiration ( http://www.molinspiration.com ), SEArch ( http://sea.bkslab.org/search/ ), Drug-likeness tool (Oprea ) and OSIRIS Property Explorer (Sander ).
The absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) were also assessed for the selected compounds. The ADME SARfari (Davies et al. ), admetSAR (Cheng et al. ), Swiss database (Wirth et al. ) and QikProp (Schrödinger ) were used for these assessments.
Results
Identification of unique and common pathways
After the initial analysis from the KEGG database, we found 27 common pathways of the host–pathogen and 39 unique pathways of the pathogen only. A total of 234 proteins from the host and a total of 170 proteins from the pathogen common pathways’ were retrieved from the UniProt database. On the other hand, a total of 234 proteins were retrieved from the pathogen unique pathways’ for further analysis. All these common and unique pathways with appropriate entry Ids are described in Table 1 . The genes for the pathogen unique pathways were also retrieved and described in the Table S1. The complete pathway distribution of the pathogen is depicted in the Figure S1.

Non-homologous essential protein identification and their localization
All pathogen pathway specific proteins were checked for the BLASTp analysis to identify the non-homologous proteins against the host. A total of 18 proteins from the common pathway and a total of 124 proteins of the unique pathways of the pathogen were detected as non-homologous.
STRING database retrieved the essential proteins from all the non-homologous proteins of the pathogen based on the highest confidence score of 0.9. All the experimental, co-expression and neighborhood data were selected for screening out the essential proteins. Well-isolated networks with lower seed were removed from the analysis for securing the best prediction. Finally, we got 13 essential proteins from the common pathways and 83 from the unique pathways. The interactive network is depicted in the Figure S2.
Both CELLO and PSORTb predicted the subcellular localizations of all the essential proteins including all the unique pathogen proteins (Fig. 2 ). The cytoplasmic region was the top most hit among them and finally, we found 7 membrane and 89 cytoplasmic essential proteins from both common and unique pathways. Fig. 2 Subcellular localization of the unique pathogen proteins of different pathways
Novel target identification and prioritization
The DrugBank database retrieved the novel targets through the BLASTp analysis with the default parameters. Finally, we found 70 unique proteins as a novel targets and went for further analysis. Distributions of these essential proteins in different metabolic pathways are visualized in Fig. 3 . Fig. 3 Distribution of all the essential proteins of the pathogen with percentage
In prioritization scheme, we employed several criteria to sort-out the best possible targets. These include several cutoff values comprising, molecular weight < 100 KDa; pI < 7.2; instability index < 40; aliphatic index in between 95 and 104; hydrophobicity > − 0.142. These assessment results are described in the Table S2. Through the physicochemical properties analysis, we found 32 sorted proteins for the N -glycosylation analysis (Table S3). The parameter for the N -glycosylation analysis was > 2 N -glycosylated amino acids (Galperin and Koonin ; Oany et al. ). Before the assessment of the super-target and potential therapeutic target databases, we secured 12 potential novel targets and to end with six targets (Table 2 ).

Homology modelling and validation
Homology models of the final six targets were constructed through MODELLER and are depicted in Fig. 4 . These models are visualized by PyMOL molecular graphics system. Validations of these models were checked by constructing the “Ramachandran Plot” and its statistics (Table S4) with appropriate templates’ information and identity. Finally, we selected the protein P0A9R1 for the further study based on the best target selection. The superposition between the template 1t4b_A and the modeled protein P0A9R1 was also analyzed as a part of the validation process with RMSD of 0.146 Å (Fig. 5 ). Fig. 4 Three-dimensional model of all the targeted proteins. Here, cyan, magenta, blue, yellow, orange and purple color denote the protein, P0A6L3, P0A9M9, Q83MD3, Q83IN8 Q83MH9 and P0A9R1, respectively Fig. 5 Superposition between the template and model. In this figure, template is shown as yellow and the predicted model is shown as blue color. The RMSD of the superposition is 0.146 Å
Electrostatic potentiality and energy minimization
The electrostatic potentiality of the template 1t4b_A and the modeled protein was analyzed for the identification of the energy distribution of the protein and showed in Fig. 6 . The comparative energy distribution revealed that the distribution is similar to the target and the model. For better model construction, we applied energy minimization process onto the modeled protein through the GROMOS 96 force field. The force-field energies of the whole structure before and after minimization were − 6404.763 and − 16,370.318 kJ/mol respectively. Fig. 6 Electrostatic potentiality of the proposed target POA9R1 (top structure) and the template 1T4B_A (bottom structure). In the energy distribution, blue color indicates higher energy and red indicates lower energy potentiality. White color indicates energy neutral state
Active site exploration and virtual screening
CASTp server predicted different active sites of our desired protein with different volume score and we picked the best large volume as the final active site (Fig. 7 ). The molecular surface area of the active site was 1940.291 Å. Fig. 7 Active site determination of the targeted protein with energy distribution view
For the virtual screening, we docked 26 compounds based on the initially targeted compound screened from the BindingBD (Table S5). The top six molecules of best binding energies along with the standard were investigated further for the identification of potential drug candidate (Table 3 ; Fig. 8 ). Docking poses with 0.0 RMSD were selected as the final binding energies and interacting amino acid residues are depicted in Fig. 9 . Table 3 Docking analysis of the screened compounds Compound no.

Discussion
This is the first comprehensive subtractive genomics analysis of different metabolic pathways of Shigella flexneri 2a for the identification of prospective drug targets through sequential approaches described schematically in Fig. 1 . Metabolic pathways are crucial for the survival of the bacteria and hence it serves as a prime target for the development of new therapeutics (Duffield et al. ). In this study, we have reinforced to find out new therapeutic targets that should be novel and potential for getting more striking outputs. As a part of this process, we have tried to figure out unique targets which solely exist in the pathogen only for avoiding any potential side effects.
Initial analysis revealed that the pathogen consists of a wide array of metabolic pathways which are unique to pathogen only and non-homolog as well. Interactive network analyses among the unique pathways’ proteins are used for the novel targets’ identification and cytoplasmic proteins are the topmost priority among them due to easier purification and assay (Guruprasad et al. ; Oany et al. ).
Based on the physiological and chemical properties we prioritized drug targets initially. The molecular weight of the drug targets should be < 100 KDa for securing the appropriate interactions with the therapeutic candidates and we considered this criterion for our selection. The lower theoretical isoelectric point (pI) and instability index are associated with the stability of the protein in in vitro condition. This is well applicable to the therapeutic target also and we had carefully chosen the targets according to these parameters (Bakheet and Doig ). Hydrophobicity of the therapeutic target is higher than the non-therapeutic candidates and that cause the lower polarity of the target (Lange et al. ). For this reason, those targets with hydrophobicity > − 0.142 were selected for the therapeutic targets. Finally, targets sorting with > 2 N -glycosylated amino acids further strengthen our prioritization through securing appropriate folding and assembly of the targets and cause less prone to degradation.
Later in the prioritization steps we found six therapeutic targets. Among them, proteins P0A6L3, P0A9R1and Q83IN8 encoded by the genes dapA , asd and lysC , respectively, are associated with lysine biosynthesis pathway. Protein Q83MD3 encoded by the gene dxr is associated with C5 isoprenoid biosynthesis and Q83MH9 ( thrB ) is responsible for threonine biosynthesis. All these targets are very much vital for the pathogen survival. We further performed an extended literature review and structural feature analysis for gathering insights about the feasibility of these targets and finally the proteins P0A9R1 and Q83MD3 were selected.
Enzyme 1-deoxy- d -xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR) is the second enzyme of the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) to isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway. The enzyme DXR converts 1-deoxy- d -xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) into the branched compound 2-C-methyl- d -erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) which requires isomerization and subsequently an NADPH-dependent reduction. This MEP pathway is unique in most of the pathogenic bacteria and apicomplexan parasite like Plasmodium falciparum and absent in human, therefore, becoming an attractive target for the development of novel antimalarial and antibacterial compounds (Sangari et al. ). Mevalonate (MVA) pathway, an alternative to the MEP, is usually used in many bacteria for the synthesis of isoprenoid and bacteria show a significant plasticity for this pathway through bypassing. As a consequence, resistance to antibiotics is rising (Sakamoto et al. ; Sangari et al. ).
Aspartate-β-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (ASD) was the second target of our analysis and another potential therapeutic target for the development of new drugs against the aspartate pathway. This enzyme is responsible for the production of many important amino acids as well as very much crucial for the growth and development of the organism (Gerdes et al. ; Kobayashi et al. ). The absence in the human and wide distribution in many bacteria and plants cause an extended focus for the researcher on this validated drug-target enzyme. For these reasons, we had selected this protein for the further investigation.
Homology model, based on the template 1t4b_A with the high sequence identity of 99.728% secured the model validity and furthermore, superposition RMSD of 0.146 Å is an indicator of the highly valid model. Energy minimization steps also prepare the model ready to dock organization on its large active site pocket.
Petrosamine B, a pyridoacridine alkaloid, isolated from the marine sponge has been used as an inhibitor of the enzyme ASD and works as a weak inhibitor (Carroll et al. ). Through focusing this point we had explored the virtual screening for the similar compounds to find-out more potential therapeutic candidates.
The compound 3 (PubChem CID: 11319750) with a binding energy of − 9.9 kcal/mol was found to be the most potent inhibitor of the ASD in comparison with the Petrosamine B and two other potent compounds 1 (PubChem CID: 24882646) and 2 (PubChem CID: 23425964) with a binding energy of − 7.6, − 10.1 and − 10.0 kcal/mol, respectively as the compound 3 possesses the highest enzyme inhibitory and drug-likeness score of 0.72 and 0.2, respectively. There is no violation of the Lipinski’s rules for all the compounds and retain the bioavailability of 0.55 as well.
The ADMET profile analysis of all the targeted compounds likewise revealed that the compound 3 was also a potent therapeutic candidate in comparison with others. The intestinal absorption of the compound 3 was 100% and highly water soluble. Blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability of the compound 3 was 0.2 and the highest permeability showed by the compound 5 of 0.413. The fraction of the unbound drug is higher for the compound 4 of 0.002 while the compound 3 had 0.143, indicating the high efficiency of the compounds. Total clearance was higher for the compound 3 of 0.708 and highest of 0.916 for the compound 5 and also showed no AMES toxicity and carcinogenicity.
Through the comparative analysis, finally, we concluded that the compound 3 would be the best possible candidate as an inhibitor of the ASD because of its relative higher ADMET profile as well as highest enzyme inhibitory and drug-likeness scores.
Conclusion
Shigellosis now has become a global concern for the developed as well as poor countries throughout the world and causes millions of deaths every year. Through the ever-rising resistance patterns of the pathogen, Shigella has become a major threat to us. So, the development of better targets and therapeutic candidates are inevitable for the upcoming centuries. Present comprehensive whole genomics and proteomics-based study of the metabolic pathways’ of the pathogenic strain S. flexneri 2a gives us a pedal stands to think about its potential therapeutics. Finally, we strongly believe that the identified therapeutic targets and its potential inhibitors would contribute to treating shigellosis in a proficient manner in in vitro and suggesting further study about its potency.
