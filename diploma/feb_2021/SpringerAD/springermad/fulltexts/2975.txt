Introduction
Intussusception is one of the few conditions in infancy and childhood for which urgent imaging-guided therapy is the standard of care [ , , , , ]. Several factors can influence the likelihood of successful non-operative reduction: symptom duration, identification of a pathological lead point or entrapped fluid, and intracolonic pressure, among other considerations, have all been examined for association with incomplete reduction after imaging-guided therapy [ , , , ]. In terms of liquid compared to air media, for multiple reasons air reduction has become the preferred method of choice for intussusception reduction, at least in the United States [ , , , ]. Because successful reduction depends on establishing an intracolonic pressure gradient sufficient to move the intussusceptum out of the intussuscipiens, prevention of an air leak is essential. Various methods to maintain an anal seal include the use of an external occlusion disc and tight taping or manual compression across the buttocks. Additionally, some practitioners use a Foley-type catheter balloon inflated within the rectum to act as an internal seal. The aim of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of air enema intussusception reduction attempted with or without use of a rectal balloon.
Materials and methods
After institutional review board approval, we retrospectively reviewed the hospital charts, radiology and pathology studies, and surgical notes of all children (799) who underwent attempted fluoroscopic-guided reduction of ultrasound-confirmed ileocolic or ileo-ileocolic intussusception documented in the radiology database of a large quaternary care academic children’s hospital from 01 January 2008 through 31 December 2015. We excluded from further analysis 196 hydrostatic attempts and 2 attempts with insufficient data to determine the reduction technique. We also excluded an additional 35 cases in which an intussusception was not confirmed at fluoroscopy.
Any of 39 pediatric imaging practitioners (26 diagnostic or interventional radiologists, 10 pediatric radiology fellows, and 3 radiology physician assistants) performed the reductions, and each chose whether to use external taping alone or a rectal balloon based on personal preference. The interventional radiologists were also fellowship-trained in pediatric radiology. The radiology physician assistants were trained in pediatric diagnostic and interventional fluoroscopy, and were grouped with the interventional radiology practitioners for the purposes of this study. Pediatric radiology fellows functioned without attending supervision and were designated as the responsible proceduralists only after training alongside an attending radiologist in at least three reduction attempts and obtaining subjective approval of competence by the fellowship program director. Practitioners of any type were considered to be less experienced if they had been practicing for fewer than 5 years.
At our institution children undergo continuous monitoring of heart rate, blood pressure and oxygen saturation during the procedure, but they are not sedated. We use an enema tube or 20- to 24-gauge Foley catheter (Bard Medical, Covington, GA) for insufflation. If the balloon is inflated, this occurs under fluoroscopy to ensure an appropriate degree of inflation in the rectal ampulla. We prefer air over water because the former is more easily visible. Inflation of the balloon up to 30 mL volume generally prevents balloon expulsion during Valsalva maneuvers, although we easily replace the balloon when this occurs. Once inflated, we carefully pull the balloon against the anorectal ring, and air is insufflated into the colon with the child supine or prone, or in both positions for some of the more difficult cases. We prevent air leak by gentle traction on the balloon catheter with the child in any position, although there is a greater tendency for the balloon to be expelled during Valsalva maneuvers when the child is prone. To prevent air leak, we might use manual compression in addition to either balloon inflation or external taping. We maintain the maximum resting sustained intraluminal pressure at less than 120 mmHg, noting that pressures during Valsalva maneuvers can be highly variable. Children in whom reductions are initially incomplete are rested, with subsequent reduction attempts within a few hours. As long as there is reduction progress, there is no limit on the number or duration of reduction attempts. Procedural failure (defined as ultimately incomplete reduction or bowel perforation during fluoroscopic-guided reduction) necessitates surgical intervention.
For each procedure we collected the patient’s gender, age in months (not corrected for prematurity), whether a rectal balloon was used, the subspecialty (interventional vs. diagnostic practitioner), practitioner experience (fellow vs. <5 years’ post-fellowship experience vs. ≥5 years’ post-fellowship experience), reduction success, bowel perforation, operative management (reduction with or without bowel resection), and operative and pathological findings (presence and sites of bowel necrosis or perforation, and lead point). When there were delayed attempts for the same encounter, we analyzed the collected data only for the final attempt, as per the suggestion of Bekdash et al. [ ].
We summarized categorical variables (gender, rectal balloon use, outcome, surgery, bowel resection, practitioner subspecialty, practitioner level of experience, patient age < vs. ≥ 1 year) as counts and percentages, and we summarized the continuous variable, patient age (in months), as a mean with standard deviation. We tested these variables’ associations to three outcomes — failed reduction, perforation and bowel resection — using the Fisher exact test for categorical variables and the Wilcoxon rank test for age. Additionally, we identified risk factors for bowel perforation and predictors of successful reduction using multivariate logistic regression analyses adjusting for other factors. We calculated odds ratios and generated risk-adjusted probability plots.
Results
We analyzed 566 cases, in which the male-to-female ratio was 3:2, the patient ages ranged from 2 months to 14 years (median age 19.6 months, with 13 children older than 5 years), and 244 children (43%) younger than 1 year of age. A rectal balloon was used in 292 (52%) reduction attempts. Attending radiologists and radiology physician assistants conducted 81% of attempts, similarly apportioned between those with greater than or less than 5 years’ experience, and fellows performed 19% of attempts. Interventional radiology practitioners performed 39% of the attempts (Table 1 ).

For the cohort of 566 children, the selective reduction rate (SRR), defined by Bekdash et al. [ ] as non-operative reductions/attempted non-operative reductions, was 91% (515/566) overall, 93% (271/292) with a rectal balloon and 89% (244/274) without a rectal balloon. The corrected selective reduction rate (CSRR), defined by Bekdash et al. [ ] as non-operative reductions/attempted non-operative reductions without resection, was 94% (515/545) overall, 96% (271/281) with a rectal balloon and 92% (244/264) without a rectal balloon . For comparison, the composite reduction rate is defined by Bekdash et al. [ ] as non-operative reductions/non-operative and operative reductions without resection, and the corrected selective reduction rate and composite reduction rate are equivalent in this study because there were no children with intussusceptions reduced in the operating room who bypassed an imaging-guided attempt at reduction.
Of the 566 attempted reductions, there were 51 failed reductions (9%) that went to surgery — 21 failures (including 8 perforations) from the group in which a balloon was used and 30 failures (1 perforation) from the group in which a balloon was not used. Of the 51 who went to surgery, 21 had bowel resections — 11 from the group in which a balloon was used (including 5 of the 8 with perforations) and 10 from the group in which a balloon was not used (including the case with perforation). Thirty intussusceptions were reduced surgically without bowel resection. Of the 21 with bowel resection, 13 had lead points (Meckel diverticulum in 7, lymphoid hyperplasia in 4, duplication cyst and B cell lymphoma in 1 each), 4 had necrotic bowel (2 with perforation), and 4 had perforation without necrosis.
Statistically significant associations with bowel perforation on univariate analysis of the 566 cases included rectal balloon use ( P =0.038), age younger than 1 year ( P <0.0001), and attending level of experience younger than 5 years ( P =0.043). Younger age was associated with both perforation ( P <0.0001) and failure ( P =0.001; Tables 2 and 3 ). After adjusting for other variables on multivariate analysis, age younger than 1 year was also associated ( P =0.0011) with perforation, as was balloon use ( P <0.035; Table 2 ). The risk-adjusted predicted probability of perforation steeply decreased with age, approaching zero by 10 months of age regardless of balloon use (Fig. 1 ).

We performed a separate analysis of 549 cases in which the 17 cases requiring surgical reduction were excluded to remove the potential confounder of cases not amenable to air enema reduction (Table 4 ). These include 13 cases that were technically irreducible (due to lead point), as well as 4 cases that were technically reducible but for which bowel resection was required because of necrosis (2 of these also had bowel perforation). Because balloon use showed no significant effect on failure for the overall population, we performed multivariate logistic regression analysis to test whether a rectal balloon benefitted older patients, after adjusting for other variables and excluding the surgically resected cases. The procedural failure rate did not change significantly with respect to age when a balloon was not employed ( P =0.83); however, the procedural failure rate decreased with respect to age with the use of a balloon ( P =0.013; Table 4 ). The risk-adjusted predicted probability of failure was much higher earlier in infancy and steeply decreased to approach zero by 30 months of age with balloon use, while the probability of failure stayed in a relatively narrow range of 3–12% regardless of age without a balloon (Fig. 2 ).

There were no anorectal complications in any of the cases in which a balloon was used. Bowel perforation occurred in nine children during attempted air enema reduction over the 8-year period, for a rate of 1.6% (9/566). The mean age of children with perforation was 4 months (range 2–8 months). Of the perforations, 8/9 (89%) occurred using a rectal balloon and 3/9 (33%) during a delayed re-attempt at reduction. Six of nine perforations occurred during reduction by an interventional practitioner, and 8/9 by a fellow or responsible practitioner with fewer than 5 years’ experience. Following perforation, 8/9 (89%) children were treated with immediate needle decompression to avoid the complications of potential tension pneumoperitoneum pending surgery. Perforation during attempted air enema reduction occurred at a site of transmural necrosis of the colonic hepatic flexure in one case; in eight, however, perforation occurred in non-necrotic bowel: three in the cecum/ascending colon (one identified only in the pathological resection specimen), three in the hepatic flexure/transverse colon, one in the sigmoid colon, and one in an unidentified location. In this last case, no bowel resection was performed despite the presence of serosal tears in the non-necrotic colon. All identifiable perforations occurred at the outer wall of the intussuscipiens and none occurred in a colonic segment distal to the presenting location of the intussusception. Extensive serosal tears of the right hemicolon along the outer wall of the intussuscipiens were noted intra-operatively in seven of the children with perforation. Perforations were treated by primary suture repair without bowel resection in two children, but resections were necessary in 6/9 (67%), including right ileocolectomies in four patients, a right ileocolectomy and sigmoid resection in one patient, and hepatic flexure resection in one patient. None of the nine cases with perforation had a lead point requiring resection identified either intra-operatively or on pathological inspection.
Of the 21 total bowel resections, 17 were necessitated by lead points or necrotic bowel, and 4 by bowel perforations without necrosis but not amenable to primary repair. The children requiring bowel resection for irreducible intussusceptions ranged in age from 3 months to 134 months. There was no statistically significant difference in mean age of the patient group requiring bowel resection compared to other patients (non-operative or operative reduction: mean 19.4±16.4 [standard deviation] months vs. surgically irreducible: mean 23.7±35.8 months, P= 0.1593).
Discussion
The medical literature scantly addresses the use of a rectal balloon as an aid to maintaining an anorectal seal during intussusception reduction attempts. The few reports mentioning the use of a balloon documented technical aspects of the procedure rather than efficacy [ , , ]. More recently, Betz et al. [ ] found that using a Foley catheter with an inflated balloon significantly increased the likelihood of successful reduction compared to buttock taping for liquid enemas in 62 pediatric intussusception cases over a 5-year period. In that study, reduction rates with air enema were high (90%), whether a Foley catheter with inflated balloon or a Shiels occlusion device (GRI Medical Products, Cave Creek, AZ) was used along with taping, although, notably, fluoroscopy time estimates were shorter when a balloon was used; this was attributed to the reliability of an airtight seal at the anus. The only perforation in the study cohort was noted intraoperatively in the sigmoid colon of a 6-month-old with an unsuccessful reduction by air enema using an inflated balloon catheter. The study was underpowered to identify a difference in reduction rates for air enema performed with or without a balloon.
Comparing the effectiveness of intussusception reduction techniques reported in different studies is challenging because of the variety of techniques as well as the lack of adherence to a standard definition of “reduction rate.” Some studies report the overall crude reduction rate, defined by Bekdash et al. [ ] as the number of non-operative reductions divided by the number of intussusceptions presenting over a certain time period. The denominator of this index includes cases that went directly to surgery without a non-operative reduction attempt. Most studies, however, including ours, report the selective reduction rate, defined as the number of successful non-operative reductions divided by the number of attempted non-operative reductions. The reported selective reduction rate for air enema varies widely, from as high as 98% to as low as 46% [ ]. However Bekdash et al. [ ] pointed out that there are better indices of comparison among non-operative treatment options, namely the corrected selective reduction rate and the composite reduction rate. Both of these indices exclude cases requiring bowel resection as a result of necrotic bowel or a pathological lead point, acknowledging that an index of successful non-operative treatment should reflect the proportion that could potentially be reduced safely without operative treatment. The composite reduction rate gives the proportion of potentially reducible intussusceptions that were reduced non-operatively and therefore is the index that gives the truest representation of successful non-operative treatment. The most commonly reported index, the selective reduction rate (but also the corrected selective reduction rate), measures the success of a radiology department in diverting intussusception patients — of those patients it is referred — from the operating room, and therefore is biased by patient selection for primary operative treatment. If used to compare institutional success, these indexes are misleading if some institutions routinely exclude cases up-front from non-operative attempts at reduction because of factors thought to make non-operative success unlikely. In our practice, all children with intussusception undergo an imaging-guided attempt at reduction after any necessary stabilization unless there is frank peritonitis or sepsis, previously estimated to occur in our population uncommonly [ ]. No imaging finding absolutely contraindicates an attempt at non-operative reduction except clear confirmation of pre-procedural perforation (which we have not seen). Even children with prospectively identified pathological lead points undergo attempted reduction, regardless of age, in order to convert an urgent surgical procedure to an elective surgical procedure.
Our overall selective reduction rate (91%) for air enema compares favorably to the reduction rate of 83% reported in a recent meta-analysis of 44 published studies [ ], but at the cost of a higher perforation rate (1.6% compared to 0.4%). When the cases of resection are removed, the corrected selective reduction rate as defined by Bekdash et al. [ ] for each of the balloon/no balloon groups becomes 96% and 92%, respectively. Use of a rectal balloon resulted in proportionately fewer operatively reduced cases compared to not using a balloon, although this trend (14/285 vs. 20/264) was too small to reach statistical significance. Figure 2 illustrates that while use of an inflated balloon is associated with a higher failure rate in children younger than 10 months (related to the incidence of perforation in this group), the failure rate with use of an inflated balloon steeply drops to near zero by the age of 30 months, while the failure rate using an air reduction technique without an inflated balloon remains relatively static between 3% and 12%.
Twenty-one (41%) of the 51 children who went to surgery after failed attempts at air enema reduction required a bowel resection. Of these 21, 15 underwent bowel resection to treat an intussusception that was not manually reducible intraoperatively, 4 underwent a bowel resection to treat an iatrogenic perforation that occurred during air enema not amenable to primary suture repair, and 2 underwent bowel resection to treat both. If the 4 children who had bowel resection because of iatrogenic perforation are excluded, then 17/47 (36%) of the cases sent to the operating room from radiology as an irreducible intussusception were also surgically irreducible and needed bowel resection. This proportion is very similar to that reported from earlier data from our institution [ ], and suggests a benchmark for comparison in subsequent studies.
We were unable to demonstrate a statistically significant difference in reduction failure or bowel resection based on the level of practitioner experience (fellow vs. <5 years’ experience vs. ≥5 years’ experience). However, differences might have gone undetected because the numbers in these subgroups are relatively small and the experience categories are arbitrarily defined. The association of perforation with <5 years’ experience showed statistical significance ( P =0.0433) for the whole cohort of 566 children on univariate analysis and a trend near statistical significance ( P =0.0532) on multivariate analysis (Table 2 ). Future research might clarify the association between perforation and lesser experience of the practitioner. Although this might be simply an artifact of having been unluckily favored with younger patients more prone to perforation, there might be, for example, a psychological effect in having enough determination to continue a difficult reduction but not quite enough experience to know when to quit.
Because practitioners with more interventional radiology experience might be more comfortable managing the potential complications of reduction, it could be argued that these practitioners are more likely to pursue aggressive reduction attempts. Although about 60% of all the reduction attempts and 6/9 (67%) of perforations occurred under supervision by an interventionalist, these providers were responsible for only 11/34 (32%) of potentially reducible unsuccessful air enema attempts. In the vast majority of interventionalist cases (205/222=92%), an inflated balloon was used. These data support the idea that interventionalists have a greater tolerance of higher risk for higher reward. However, we are unable to separate out factors that might be associated with aggressive reduction attempts (e.g., being an interventionalist or using an inflated balloon) in younger patients who are at higher risk of perforation. Previously published work [ ] suggests that a more aggressive up-front approach to intussusception reduction is a reasonable strategy if there is a detailed plan of action for management of complicating bowel perforation. At our institution, needle decompression of the abdomen is encouraged immediately after recognition of bowel perforation to avoid hemodynamic instability from tension pneumoperitoneum, and surgical support is available on site for definitive surgical management.
Nine bowel perforations occurred during attempted air enema reductions, all in children younger than 9 months, and 8 of 9 with use of a rectal balloon. Younger age as either a categorical or a continuous variable showed a statistically significant association with perforation on univariate and multivariate analysis. The probability of perforation rises progressively from near zero as the patient age drops younger than 10 months, especially with use of a rectal balloon (Fig. 1 ). These findings highlight what has been noted in other studies: the youngest children are at highest risk for bowel perforation [ , ]. The underlying pathophysiology of this observation is unclear, although it is possible that the thinner colonic wall in younger children [ ] results in greater wall tension for a given intraluminal pressure and tube radius, as per Laplace’s law, in which wall tension is proportional to the pressure and radius and inversely proportional to the wall thickness.
The extent of bowel injury observed at surgery and within resected specimens was notable in these infants with air enema reduction attempts complicated by perforation. Serosal tears consistent with shear injury were seen along the outer wall of the intussuscipiens in seven of the nine cases of perforation, and these required treatment with extensive bowel resection in many cases, despite the absence of transmural necrosis (Fig. 3 ). Daneman et al. [ ] also reported the tendency for air enema perforations in young infants to involve the outer wall of the intussuscipiens with bowel trauma rather than necrosis as a precipitant of the perforation, and the need for bowel resection given the injury extent. The proclivity for injury to the serosal outer wall of the intussuscipiens is consistent with the site of greatest wall tension according to Laplace’s law, and concordant with the finding by Shiels et al. [ ] of a greater size of perforations on the serosal surfaces compared to the mucosal surfaces of the colon in a piglet model of air enema perforations. For this reason, less aggressive attempts at air enema reduction might be warranted in younger infants, realizing that although an unsuccessful air enema reduction translates into a surgery, the intraoperative reduction might be less likely to necessitate a hemicolectomy or other bowel resection. Fig. 3 In this 5-month-old girl, ileocolic intussusception was manually reduced in the operating room, but a right ileocolectomy was required because of long serosal tears and extreme thinning of the wall of the ascending colon, shown here on pathological specimen
There has been concern that an overinflated rectal balloon catheter can damage the anal sphincter or perforate the rectum. While rectal perforation has been reported as a complication of using balloon catheters for treatment of neonatal meconium ileus [ ], we are not aware of publications reporting anorectal injury related to retention balloon use for intussusception reduction, and we have not seen this complication in our practice, despite some members' having used retention balloons with intussusception reductions for several decades. We do follow the counsel of Nelson et al. [ ] and Dodds et al. [ ] and inflate the balloon in the rectal ampulla above the level of the anal sphincter under fluoroscopy and then gently pull the inferior aspect of the inflated balloon against the anorectal ring, thus avoiding inflation at the level of the sphincteric muscle. Although buttock taping might be performed as an additional measure to secure the catheter, taping is not necessary if gentle traction is applied to maintain the balloon seal, and we agree with Betz et al. [ ] that if the rectal catheter needs to be repositioned during the procedure, the lack of tape across the buttocks makes this much more expedient.
Our study focused primarily on the safety and efficacy of the use of a rectal balloon for intussusception reduction by air enema. Limitations include the retrospective nature of the analysis and the unclear impact of certain patient-dependent and operator-dependent factors, such as the duration of the intussusception prior to attempted reduction and lack of intraluminal pressure recordings during reduction attempts. Despite the relatively large patient cohort, the study had limited statistical power because the frequency of events (such as perforation) is low and certain trends might only become statistically significant with the addition of more events. A prospective, randomized study of intussusception reduction with and without rectal balloon inflation could be performed to control for the variables present in this study and provide further evidence toward an optimal technique.
Conclusion
The likelihood of a successful intussusception reduction might be increased by using an inflated rectal balloon without significantly increasing the risk of complications in children older than 9 months. Use of a balloon in younger infants is associated with a higher risk of iatrogenic bowel injury resulting in perforations that require urgent surgery and resection of non-necrotic bowel. In general, risk of perforation is reduced by greater operator experience.
