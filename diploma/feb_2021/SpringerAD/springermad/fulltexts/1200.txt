Introduction
Human amylin (hA), also known as human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP), is an important neuroendocrine hormone secreted simultaneously with insulin by the adult pancreatic β cells [ , ]. As a neuroendocrine hormone, hA acts with insulin to maintain glucose homeostasis by suppressing glucagon secretion [ ], slowing gastric emptying rate and food transit from the stomach to the small intestine [ ] and reducing food intake [ ]. However, hA represents the predominant component of islet amyloid deposits related to the development of β cell dysfunction in many individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) [ , ]. Scientists have shown that hA forms cytotoxic oligomers and further transforms to amyloid fibrils that disrupt normal islet architecture [ ]. In our previous studies, we have originally demonstrated two morphologic classes of amyloid oligomers in pancreatic islets of T2D patients [ ]. We also have reported that hA is closely related to the pathological changes in pancreatic islets [ , , , , , , , , ]. Pancreatic islet β cells are damaged in Type 1 diabetes (T1D) with its pathological feature: autoimmune insulitis [ ], which led to the lack of insulin and amylin. Low plasma amylin concentration has been found in T1D/T2D patients and autoimmune disease model such as non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice [ , ]. An analog of hA, named “pramlintide,” is used for clinical therapies of both T1D and T2D as an adjunct with insulin [ , ].
Thus, amylin may regulate the inflammatory response and immune factor secretion [ , ]. Mouse amylin accumulation was reportedly involved in immune response in NOD mice [ ]. Previous studies proved that diabetes-inducing CD4 T cell clones isolated from non-obese diabetic mice could recognize hybrid insulin peptides which may explain the pathology of T1DM and how immune tolerance was broken in T1DM [ , ]. In this study, we evaluated the potential of hA in inducing CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Treg) in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs) and in ameliorating autoimmune diabetes in NOD mice with regard to their immune regulatory properties. Furthermore, we investigated the possible mechanism of amylin on immune modulation.
Materials and methods
Animals and cells
The NOD mice with 6~8 weeks old were bred under specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions. Only female mice were used for these studies. hPBMCs were obtained from the whole blood of healthy volunteers. The Medical Research Committee of the Guilin Medical University approved all the human and animal experimental protocols.
Preparation of human amylin
The mature hA 1–37 (KCNTATCATQRLANFLVHSSNNFGAILSSTNVGSNTY) peptide was synthesized by Keck Biotechnology Center of Yale University, (New haven, CT) with t-Boc chemistry, and the purification through reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) was up to 99.95%.
Lyophilized peptides were resuspended in 50% acetonitrile in water and re-lyophilized. One milligram of hA was incubated in 50 μL 1:1 trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)/hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) mixture for 20 min in 1.5-mL siliconized Eppendorf tubes, followed by exposure to a gentle stream of nitrogen for 5~10 min to evaporate the solvent. The TFA/HFIP-treated sample was dissolved in 0.5% HAc. The resulting hA concentration was 50 μM.
Human amylin treatment in hPBMCs
Human PBMCs were isolated from 300 mL EDTA-treated human whole blood sample by discontinuous density gradient centrifugation. Treated with hA (1~1000 nmol/L dose), the 5 × 10 6 cells/mL hPBMCs were cultured in 96-well plates with 5% CO 2 condition for 24, 48, and 72 h. RPMI medium 1640 alone was used as the negative control. Lymphocytes were counted post co-stimulation of phytohemagglutinin (1 μg/ml) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 2 μg/ml). The growth density and morphology of cells were observed by Axio Imager A2 microscope (ZEISS, Munich, Germany).
Human amylin treatment in autoimmune NOD mice
To study the immune inhibitory properties of hA, we used NOD mice with spontaneous autoimmune T1D [ ]. For each mouse, 1.5 μg hA suspended in 15 μl HAc was administrated by abdominal subcutaneous injection. Female NOD mice ( n = 25) from age 10 weeks were treated once a day. At the same time, a randomly selected control group of female NOD mice (n = 25) received HAc. Fasting blood glucose levels were determined once per month with an Accu-Chek Mobile glucometer (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). The mice were considered diabetic when fasting blood glucose levels were higher than 16.9 mmol/L for at least two individual determinations. All the mice were killed 7 months after the first hA administration for collection of spleen cells and tissue samples.
Flow cytometry assay for the detection of CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells
Ex vivo and in vivo studies were performed to investigate whether the treatment with synthesized human amylin would stimulate induction of CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells from the CD4+ cells. For fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis, suspensions of dissociated splenocytes were prepared as previously described [ ]. For immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometry, the hA-treated hPBMCs and mouse spleen cells were incubated with 2.4G2 to block FcRs and then incubated with an optimal concentration of fluorochrome-labeled monoclonal antibodies CD4 (FITC, Rat Anti-Mouse, Cat. No. 553650, BD, San Jose, US) of 5× dilution for 30 min at 4 °C in the dark, followed by a 10-min fixing with 50 times volume of Human Foxp3 Buffer Set (Cat. No. 560098, BD, San Jose, US) with Foxp3 mAb clone 259D/C7 (APC, Rat Anti-Mouse, Cat. No. 550874, BD, San Jose, US). Cells were washed three times and resuspended in PBS with 1% FCS. At least 10,000 cells were assayed using FASCalibur flow cytometry (BD, San Jose, US), and data were analyzed with CellQuest software (BD, San Jose, US). Lymphocytes were gated based on forward and side light scatter and expression of CD4. Then, gated lymphocytes were analyzed for expression of Foxp3. All cells were gated according to the expression of CD4. Mice and human IgG isotype antibodies were used as the background control signal.
Immunofluorescent microscopy
The monoclonal mouse anti-IAPP antibody (Catalog No. MCA1126) is purchased from AbD Serotec (Raleigh, NC) which reacts with IAPP in extracellular islet amyloid and intracellular amyloid, and stains the β cells of pancreatic islet. Thioflavin T (20 mmol/L, Catalog No. 88306; Anaspec, San Jose, Calif) was used to detect the amylin of pancreatic islets and immunostaining with the monoclonal anti-IAPP antibody was to confirm the diversity through light microscopy. Immunofluorescence was used to detect the corresponding secondary antibodies (1:200 dilutions) that conjugated with Alexa 488, and the cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (1:200 dilutions, Invitrogen, Calif), and that the specific process of immunofluorescent microscopy is followed by previous report [ ].
Western blot assays
Western blot assays were performed to detect protein expression of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β1, No. Ab92486), toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4, No. Ab47093), and the control β-actin (No. Ab8227) in the spleen. The anti-TGF-β1 antibody was used to detect the mature TGF-β1 (13 kD) which is cleaved from full-length, inactive TGF-β1 (44 kD). Fresh spleen tissues were homogenized in 0.15 M NaCL, 0.05 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% NP-40, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA plus complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Catalog No. 11697498001, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). After measuring protein concentrations with Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL), the extracts were boiled at 100 °C for 10 min, separated on SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and transferred to polyvinylidine difluoride membranes. Equal loading of proteins (50 μg) was confirmed by Coomassie staining and subsequent β-actin immunoblotting. Membranes were blocked in 10% non-fat milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween (TBST) and incubated with primary antibody diluted in TBST for 1 h at room temperature. After incubation with horseradish peroxidise-conjugated goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:10,000; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) for 1 h at room temperature, the protein bands were visualized using ECL chemiluminescence reagent from Amersham-Pharmacia (Piscataway, NJ).
Statistics
Data are expressed as mean ± standard error, absolute number, or percentage (%). Differences in means were compared using independent Student’s t tests (SPSS, Statistics Package for the Social Sciences 13.0). An association between two sets of parametric data was evaluated using the Pearson correlation coefficient. A two-tailed p value less than 0.05 was considered significant.
Results
Human amylin had no cytotoxic effect on hPBMCs
Freshly prepared hA solution of different concentrations (1, 10, 100, or 1000 nmol/L) were added to 96 wells of cells for 24~72 h. In 1~10 nmol/L hA incubation, hPBMCs still grew adhesively with regular cellular morphology and clear borderline, without obvious cell damage and death. Cell confluences in these two concentrations were maintained up to 70% more at 48 h post treatment, no significant difference with negative controls (Fig. 1 ). Fig. 1 Cultured hPBMCs with addition of hA. Treated with hA (1~1000 nmol/L dose), the 5 × 10 6 cells/mL hPBMCs were cultured in 96-well plates with 5% CO 2 condition for 48 h. 1640 medium alone was used in NC. The growth density and morphology of cells were observed by microscope
Human amylin induced Treg cells from hPBMCs ex vivo
To evaluate the stimulation of Treg cells, flow cytometry assay was used to count the Treg cells in hA-treated and un-treated hPBMCs. Flow cytometry result shows that an increase of CD4+Foxp3+ Treg was detected in hA-treated group, but none in control hPBMCs. Percentage of CD4+Foxp3+ Treg in CD4+ T cells was used to demonstrate the increase of Treg (Fig. 2A ). Though no significant difference, a slight growth of Treg cells can be observed in 1 nmol/L hA-treated group compared with control (2.54 ± 0.46% vs. 1.62 ± 0.40%, p > 0.05) (Fig. 2 a). Treatment with 5~100 nmol/L hA increased CD4+Foxp3+ Treg obviously in hPBMCs, and 10 nmol/L hA was the best dose with 2.9-fold CD4+Foxp3+ Treg increase (3.92 ± 0.46% vs. 1.36 ± 0.30%, p < 0.03) (Fig. 2 a, b). All flow cytometry data were averaged by six individual parallel tests. Fig. 2 Ex vivo and in vivo induction of CD4+Foxp3+ Treg determined by flow cytometry. a Percentage of CD4+Foxp3+ Treg in CD4+ T cells in hPBMCs treated with hA solution (black bars) in different concentrations (0, 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, or 100 nmol/L) were compared with saline control (white bars) determined by flow cytometry. b The percentage of CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells in hPBMCs from hA-treated (10 nmol/L) and un-treated NOD mice. c Flow cytometry was done to measure the frequency of CD4+Foxp3+ Treg, after treatment with hA or NS for 7 months. The splenocytes were isolated from hA-treated ( n = 25) and NS-treated (n = 25) NOD mice after 7 months of treatment. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean (SEM) calculated from six individual parallel tests. d The percentage of CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells in the spleen from hA-treated (10 nmol/L) and un-treated NOD mice
Human amylin inhibited the risk of autoimmune diabetes in NOD mice
Blood glucose level was monitored once a month in female NOD mice from age 10 weeks under non-fasting condition. 1.5 μg hA in 15 μL solvent 0.5% acetic acid solution (HAc) or the control group (0.5% HAc only) was injected intraperitoneally once a day into the NOD mice. It is important that the blood glucose level at initiation of treatment did not differ between groups ( p > 0.05). After a 7-month successive medication, the incidences and relative risk (RR) in two groups of NOD mice are shown in Table 1 . In the 6th month post treatment, the cumulative incidence of diabetes in the hA-treated group (40.00%) was obviously lower than that in the HAc control group (72.00%). Incidence of diabetes in hA-treated NOD mice decreased 44.44% ( p = 0.045, RR [95%CI] = 0.5556 [0.3241–0.9523]). Then, by the end of the 7th month, the diabetic cumulative incidence of HAc-treated mice consistently increased to 92.00%, while that of hA-treated mice was still 40.00% with no additional diabetes case. Incidence of diabetes in hA-treated NOD mice this month decreased 56.52% ( p = 0.0002, RR [95%CI] = 0.4348 [0.2653–0.7125]).

Human amylin induced Treg cells from NOD mice in vivo
Spleens of NOD mice were collected at the end of the 7th month post hA treatment, and were grinded into fresh single cell suspension of splenocytes. Analysis of flow cytometry in Fig. 2 c, d demonstrates that the ratio of CD4+Foxp3+ Treg/CD4+ T cells were significantly higher in hA-treated NOD mice (3.27 ± 0.44%) than the diabetes NOD mice without hA treatment (1.78 ± 0.31%, p = 0.0013). The flow cytometry data were averaged by six individual parallel tests.
Expression of amylin in spleens of hA-treated and controlled NOD mice
We used the double immunofluorescence staining to identify the amyloid oligomers in the tissue sections of pancreas islets of NOD mice, and the expression of IAPP was investigated through serial pancreatic sections which were labeled with anti-IAPP antibody (Fig. 3 ). The results displayed that the expression of IAPP was significant higher in the pancreas islet of hA-treated NOD mice (Fig. 3 a) than that in the control (Fig. 3 b). Fig. 3 The expressions of amylin in the pancreatic islets of NOD mice. The pancreatic islets of hA-treated NOD mice ( a ) and controls ( b ) were stained with anti-IAPP antibody (green) and nuclei DAPI (blue), respectively. The image shows that the expression of amylin is high in hA-treated NOD mice than controls. Original magnification, ×200
Human amylin stimulated expression of TGF-β and TLR-4 in vivo
Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), an immunosuppressive Th2 cytokine in the splenocytes were examined by Western blot (Fig. 4 a). The results showed that TGF-β protein expression in splenocytes was 50.5% higher in hA-treated mice than in HAc control group ( p = 0.002) (Fig. 4 b). The data suggest that an enhanced hA level stimulates TGF-β protein expression in the spleen and pancreas, thereby boosting the expansion of CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T lymphocytes in hA-treated mice. Fig. 4 Protein expression of spleen TGF-β and TLR-4. a Equal amounts of tissue lysates (50 μg) of the spleen from hA-treated mice (hA, n = 10) and NS-treated mice (NS, n = 10) after 7 months of treatment were subjected to SDS-PAGE to immunoblot for TGF-β and TLR-4. b, c) Pixel intensity was normalized with the protein expression of β-actin and a value of 1 was assigned to the TGF-β and TLR-4 expression in the NS group. Data are mean ± SD, * p < 0.05
Protein expression of the toll-like receptors 4 (TLR-4) detected by Western blot assays was significantly increased in hA-treated mice ( N = 10) compared with HAc control group ( N = 10) at 12 months of age ( p < 0.05) (Fig. 4 c).
Discussion
In the present study, we evaluated how human amylin (hA) as a neuroendocrine hormone could be better geared toward inhibiting advanced autoimmune disease, which is the clinically relevant situation. In particular, we hypothesized that hA could stimulate Treg to induce a larger magnitude of regulatory responses, which was considered to reduce the autoimmune response during autoimmune diabetes. The wild type hA 1–37 was first reported as an immune-regulating hormone through increasing of CD4+Foxp3+ Treg ex and in vivo. Then, we further showed the dramatic reduction of autoimmune diabetic risk in NOD mice by treating with hA for 7 months.
Despite the importance of autoimmunity and innate immunity in both T1D and T2D, amyloid formation is also a hallmark of T2D; the immunoregulatory role of hA has not been fully explored before. In this study and for the first time, in these NOD mice treated with hA, we observed (1) non-cytotoxicity of treated hA in the hPBMCs, (2) increased expression of CD4+Foxp3+ Treg, (3) decreased diabetic cumulative incidence, and (4) increased TGF-β and TLR-4 expression levels after hA treatment.
Islet β cell dysfunction is a hallmark of both T1D and T2D [ , ]. A lack of amylin secretion relative to insulin has been described in NOD mice with autoimmune destruction of islet β cells [ ]. Patients with T2D had undetectable amylin level [ ], while patients with T1D also show basal hypo-secretion of hA relative to in insulin [ ]. It was noticed that amylin deficiency and postprandial amylin response decrease were found in late-stage diabetes [ ]. In the field of T1D, there is explosive evidence on the existence and physiological significance of Treg-mediated immune suppression as a key mechanism of self-tolerance and immune regulation. The disequilibrium between Treg and effector T cells (Teff) is a reason of β cell destruction in T1D which results from breakdown of self-tolerance [ ]. Autoimmune disease [ ] and innate immune disease [ ] may be caused by deficiency or dysfunction of Treg. The balance between Treg and Teff plays a key role in maintaining a balance between tolerance to self or non-self antigens [ ]. Dysregulation of Treg cells is now considered as a primary cause of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases in humans and animal models [ ].
NOD mice treated with Treg cells showed to be more efficient than Treg-treated CD28−/−NOD mice and delayed the development of autoimmune diabetes [ ]. It was also evidenced that the isolated Treg from T cell receptor transgenic mice can prevent the spontaneous autoimmune diabetes in NOD mice [ ]. Previous studies displayed a role of regulatory cells in the control of autoimmune diabetes, and NOD mice lost their umbrella against peri-insulitis in murine autoimmune diabetes [ , ]. Protection from autoimmune diabetes by natural killer T cells also requires the activity of Treg cells [ ]. Islet-specific Treg cells inhibit the islet’s innate immune response and promote islet engraftment [ ], which has been proven to restore normoglycemia in diabetic NOD mice [ ]. Apart from limiting migration, proliferation, and accumulation of Teff cells, Treg cells may further modulate antigen presentation of Teff cell responses [ ].
Immunosuppressive function of Treg cells is associated with regulation of Th2 cytokine and toll-like receptors (TLRs). Cytokines regulate various immune reactions and inflammatory responses through autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine pathways. Previous work has proved that a group of amyloidogenic peptides constituted with six amino acids might be anti-inflammatory, capable of reducing the serological IL-6 level and attenuating paralysis in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis [ ]. TGF-β was proven to play a role in immune regulatory of Treg cells. Through the TGF-β-dependent pathway, Treg cells can maintain self-tolerance and suppress a wide array of targets [ ]. Furthermore, transient pulse of TGF-β delivered to the islets could regulate in vivo expansion of Foxp3-expressing Treg cells responsible for protection against diabetes [ ]. TGF-β and its receptor signaling pathways are key factors in the development of Foxp3+-induced Treg [ ]. The family of TLRs is also a major class of receptors expressed in immune cells [ ]. By activated signaling pathways to produce proinflammatory cytokines and upregulate co-stimulatory molecules, the TLR family plays dual role in innate and adaptive immune responses [ ]. Among the 13 known mammalian TLRs, TLR-4 plays a fundamental role in pathogen recognition and activation of innate immunity. TLR-4 may regulate the immunosuppressive function of CD4+CD25+ Treg cells in autoimmune diseases [ ]. In our study, the induction of Treg cells and activation of TGF-β and TLR-4 may be particularly relevant to the anti-autoimmune-diabetic actions of hA.
In summary, besides the significant role in neuroendocrine contribution to glucose homeostasis, we have confirmed the positive effects of human amylin on CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cell, in part through the increasing expression of TGF-β and TLR-4, to explain its protection to the NOD mice from autoimmune diabetes, which suggests a novel approach to improve autoimmunity conditions such as autoimmune diseases, allergic diseases, immune rejection of organ transplantation, and graft-versus-host reaction.
