Introduction
Children with hematologic diseases, such as acute leukemia, sometimes receive numerous packed red blood cell transfusions during therapy. Each transfusion contains approximately 200 mg ferrous ions, which is highly above normal nutritional intake [ ]. Iron overload from repeated transfusions can cause liver fibrosis and loss of liver function and can affect the heart and neuronal or endocrine organs [ , , ]. Therapy with chelating agents might be indicated in these children to reduce iron overload. Liver biopsy is the only reliable method to assess specific cellular liver iron concentration, which represents the amount of ferric ions per gram of dry liver tissue \( \left[\frac{mgFe^{2+}}{g}\right] \) , and the degree of liver damage. But this invasive procedure is not always feasible and recommendable, especially in children. Usually, iron levels are estimated by ferritin levels, but those increase in relation to an acute-phase reaction to leukemia or many other factors without increased iron intake [ , , , , , , ]. Thus, ferritin reveals low specificity for iron overload.
Former studies in people with repeated transfusions confirmed magnetic resonance (MR) relaxometry as a more reliable tool compared to serum ferritin [ , , , , ]. Gradient recalled echo sequences for determining T2* relaxation times are more sensitive in identifying (mild) iron overload than methods based on extracting T2* relaxation times with spin-echo sequences [ , , ]. Furthermore, the short acquisition time allows for data acquisition during breath-hold [ , , ]. Now, MR relaxometry utilizing the paramagnetic effect of iron [ , ] is accepted as a noninvasive gold standard for estimating liver iron concentration [ ]; a cut-off for increased liver iron load was reported to be T2*<10 ms [ ].
Ultrasound elastography with acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging is an established technique to assess liver stiffness and suspected fibrosis in adults [ ] and children [ , ]. The shear wave velocity is directly related to tissue stiffness [ ].
Toxic effects of iron can cause liver tissue damage and increase ARFI values secondarily. Our intention was to combine ARFI with serum parameters to better distinguish liver damage from other influencing factors; alteration of parenchyma should be detectable by monitoring serum parameters as well as increased ARFI.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the suitability of ultrasound elastography for assessing liver tissue damage in the context of iron overload complemented with clinical parameters, and correlate it with MR relaxometry as a reference.
Materials and methods
Study design and population
We included children and young adults who had undergone bone marrow transplantation from 2014 to 2017 if they routinely underwent MRI during their pre- and post-bone marrow transplantation examinations to screen for secondary lesions or neoplasm (age <18 years on first consultation). They were transplanted because of different hematological diseases, notably leukemia: n =20 had acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL); n= 10 had acute myeloid leukemia (AML); n =5 had myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS); n =2 had lymphoma; and n =8 had various other diseases (Ewing sarcoma, Fanconi anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, neuroblastoma, juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia).
A total of 45 patients (24 male) received liver T2* relaxometry and ARFI imaging in a prospective study design (see Table 1 for patient characteristics). Blood was sampled in parallel to determine transaminases, γ-glutamyltransferase, C-reactive protein, alkaline phosphatase, cholinesterase and direct bilirubin. The examinations were usually scheduled before bone marrow transplantation as well as on day 100 and 1 year after bone marrow transplantation. We included additional matching values of MRI, HepScore and ARFI in individual follow-up evaluation if available, enabling us to see more detailed trends, especially for ARFI, and sometimes even longer observation periods (up to 5 years for single patients). Table 1 Patient characteristics at the time of transplantation ( n =45; 24 boys, 21 girls) and complications Characteristics Mean value ± standard deviation Age (years) 9.7±6.4 Weight (kg) 35.5±20.1 Height (cm) 137.4±32.4 Body mass index in (kg/m 2 ) 17.7±3.1 Complications after transplantation Number of patients Relapse during follow-up 2/45 Veno-occlusive disease 2/45 Graft-versus-host disease 3/45 Further relevant incidents Infectious hepatitis (pre-existing, treated) 1/45
All patients, parents or persons responsible for care and custody of the child gave their informed consent prior to evaluation. This study was performed in accordance with the ethical standards of the institution and with the principles of the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its amendments; we received a local ethical approval (No. 4130–07/14).
Magnetic resonance (MR) relaxometry
No biopsies were performed to determine liver iron concentration, so we used MR relaxometry as the reference standard to calculate liver iron concentration from T2*. MRI was performed on a 1.5-T clinical MR scanner (Avanto; Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany) using the standard spine and body phased-array coils; between one and nine measurements per patient were included ( n =137 recorded values). Following standard imaging sequences, T2* acquisition was repeatedly performed during breath-hold with children lying supine in head-first orientation. Gradient sequences with three parameter sets were applied; the region of interest was placed in the right liver lobe (Fig. 1 ). The original MR protocol by Wood et al. [ ] was optimized toward estimating short T2* values, which is necessary to assess high liver iron concentration. Fig. 1 Region of interest is drawn for MRI in an 8-year-old boy during treatment for acute myeloid leukemia. T2*-weighted axial MRI (gradient recalled-echo sequence; T2*=5.6 ms) shows the liver parenchyma is hypointense after 22 transfusions
To be able to cover a wide range of T2* values during routine examinations, one of three MRI sequence protocols (Table 2 ) was chosen after T2* fitting with noise bias correction [ ]. They were better adapted to longer T2* in long-term monitoring of children after bone marrow transplantation, when iron load slowly decreases and liver T2* values become gradually longer. Table 2 Sequence parameters of the three MRI acquisitions performed for each child Sequence Repetition time (TR), ms Echo time (TE), ms Field of view (FOV), mm Matrix Flip angle, degrees Bandwidth, Hz/pixel Slice thickness, mm In-phase 48 4.75–34.20 238×380 160×256 20 279 4 ΔTE=4.8 Single-echo 17 2.25–8.97 238×380 160×256 20 1,628 4 ΔTE=1.12 Multi-echo 12 0.81–10.31 321×380 54×64 20 1,735 15 ΔTE=0.3
The liver iron concentration was estimated from T2* based on Wood’s conversion [ ] — subsequently called “MR-Fe 2+ ” — and is expressed in mg of Fe 2+ in g of dry liver tissue [ \( \frac{mgFe^{2+}}{gLP} \) ].
Ultrasound elastography
Ultrasound elastography was performed in the same study population (N total = 105 values; between 1 and maximal 11 measurements per patient) in a timely manner to MRI (±2 days). Not all examinations were recorded within this time frame, so the number of matching MR and ARFI assessments was less (51 pairs of MRI and ARFI) than the recorded number of both to matching HepScore values because blood was drawn nearly daily and was therefore available for every MRI and ARFI examination.
All examinations were carried out by an experienced pediatric radiologist, to avoid inter-observer variability, with an iU22 ultrasound system (Philips Healthcare, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) using a C5–1 curved-array probe with patients in supine position and right arm over the head. The region of interest (size 1 cm 2 ) was placed with sonographic B-mode control (transcostal view in mid-axillary line, Fig. 2 ) in the right liver lobe (segments VI or VII) and was further set with 3-cm distance from the capsule while taking care not to include large vasculature to avoid errors by impedance shifts from liquids or the fibrotic capsule. The regions analyzed with ARFI and MRI were comparable in each child. ARFI was repeated 10 times during breath-hold, and we used the median value, measured in kilopascals (kPa), for the final estimation of liver stiffness. When young patients were not capable of following instructions, such as performing breath-holds and remaining calm, they were not included in the study. ARFI was performed in infants while they “vocalized.” Fig. 2 Follow-up US in an 8-year-old boy during treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (same patient as in Fig. 1 , 1 year after bone marrow transplantation). Ultrasound illustrates the B-mode assisted placement of the region of interest for acoustic radiation force impulse imaging in segment VII. Liver stiffness was in the normal range (3.55 kPa)
Because fluid levels of the biliary tract are influencing liver stiffness [ , ], fasting might be required for more reliable results [ ] but was not feasible in all young patients . To minimize this impact and improve the image quality for bordering tissue regions, ARFI was performed in the morning before noon and intake of greater meals.
For children, age- and gender-dependent normal values between 4.4 kPa and 5.7 kPa have been reported [ , , , ]; ARFI values >5.5 kPa were considered as elevated in this study [ ]. We chose this limit, which implies slightly increased tissue stiffness, as a possible sign of beginning remodeling processes — in contrast to other studies where ARFI was applied for diagnostics of early fibrosis stages with higher limits [ ] — to increase the sensitivity in the context of early screening evaluation.
HepScore
Commonly used scores like APRI-index, Pohl-score, or Fora’s index include parameters, such as thrombocytes or albumin levels, that are known to be less significant in the context of hematopoietic disorders or reduced nutritional status [ , ]. The HepScore avoids these parameters but includes the following ones: alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, γ-glutamyltransferase, C-reactive protein, alkaline phosphatase, choline esterase and bilirubin. Each parameter is scored with 1 point when its value is increased up to twice the normal value, depending on the age of the patient, and each parameter is scored with two points if the value is higher (Table 3 ). Values within the age-dependent normal range are scored with 0 points. Because of the large increase in inflammatory reactions, C-reactive protein is scored with 1 point for up to 10 times the normal value (<75 mg/L) and with 2 points if higher. Bilirubin is only scored with 2 points if increased; values below are counted with 0 points because increases higher than the normal value range are associated with graver alteration of liver function and are not usually observed in early stages of parenchyma changes. Rating with 1 point for lower values would not increase the discrimination of the score because of this late manifestation. Overall, score values for our population ranged 0–14 points. Scores were derived from the blood samples drawn within ±2 days of each measurement date of ARFI.

Correlation analysis
Pearson’s r was calculated as a measure of the correlation between MR-Fe 2+ and ARFI as well as between MR-Fe 2+ and the HepScore. Further, correlation analysis between HepScore and liver stiffness was performed by Pearson’s r . We grouped data into two classes associated with increased liver stiffness (ARFI>5.5 kPa) and normal stiffness. We assessed the accuracy in diagnosing increased liver stiffness with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis of ARFI in relation to HepScore. A cut-off for elevated HepScore was calculated by Youden’s index. We grouped T2* with respect to normal or increased HepScore and performed unpaired t -tests to identify significantly different mean values between these groups. We used SPSS v23 (IBM, Armonk, NY) and Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) for statistical analyses and artwork creation; results are referred to in 95% confidence intervals (CI), with a 5% significance level.
Follow-up evaluation was performed if at least three related values had been registered for each parameter ( n =18 children). We plotted ARFI, HepScore and MRI values graphically together with the total number of administered red blood cell transfusions (minimal time of follow-up 1 year, maximum 5 years).
Results
We included 45 patients (mean age 9.7 years±6.4 years [standard deviation, or SD] at bone marrow transplantation; minimal age: 0.7 years; maximum: 23.4 years); the age pattern is specified in Fig. 3 ; the greatest proportion of children was younger than 4 years at bone marrow transplantation ( n =14) and another greater part was 13–19 years ( n =11). Four other patients were younger than 7 years, eight younger than 10 years and five younger than 13 years, and three were adults when they were transplanted. As listed in Table 1 , two of them showed a relapse during follow-up, another two revealed veno-occlusive disease. Graft-versus-host disease occurred in three patients and one was successfully treated for infectious hepatitis before bone marrow transplantation. Fig. 3 Number of included patients in different age groups on the basis of the patient’s age at the time of bone marrow transplantation (BMT). The classification corresponds to the age groups required for normal values of parameters to calculate the HepScore (see Table 3 )
Signs of iron accumulation were observed on MR images (T2*<10 ms [ ]) in 29/45 patients (64%) at least one time during follow-up, and increased liver tissue stiffness showed in ARFI (>5.5 kPa [ ]) imaging in 15/45 patients (33%) compared to their corresponding earlier measurements (Figs. 1 and 2 ). But these groups did not correspond sufficiently in ROC curve analysis (area under the curve [AUC]=0.50; 95%–CI: 0.32 – 0.67).
MR-Fe 2+ values ranged from 0.14 mg Fe 2+ / g to 22.82 mg Fe 2+ / g (mean [M] MR-Fe2+ = 5.58 mg Fe 2+ /g ± 5.02 mg Fe 2+ /g SD, n =137 values). The patients received a cumulated total of 22.2 transfusions on average (minimum 4 and maximum 49) between first transfusion before and 1 year after bone marrow transplantation.
ARFI values ranged 1.29–11.6 kPa (mean±SD: 4.87±1.84 kPa; n =105). Applying the reported cut-off value of >5.5 kPa [ ], overall 29/105 measurements were considered as being elevated. The mean value of these increased ARFI values (>5.5 kPa; mean±SD: 7.21±1.65 kPa; n =29) was significantly higher (standar d error [SE]=0.25; P <0.001) compared to the mean of the group with normal ARFI values (mean±SD: 3.98±0.87 kPa; n =76). We calculated the HepScore for these 105 measurements and then grouped them by increased and normal matched ARFI values.
There was no significant correlation between the findings of ARFI and MRI (Pearson’s r =−0.08, 95%−CI: –0.37 − 0.20; P =0.57; n =51 matched values). We observed a weak correlation between HepScore and MR relaxometry ( r =0.19, 95%−CI: 0.02 − 0.36; P =0.03; n =137), which was not strong enough to justify a direct influence of liver iron concentration to this score.
Receiver-operator curve analysis of the HepScore related to the associated ARFI values (Fig. 4 ) revealed good accuracy as reflected by an AUC of 0.72 (95% CI: 0.61, 0.93; n =105). A suitable cut-off for HepScore was found for values >5 by calculating Youden’s index (sensitivity=67%; specificity=68%). Values >5 were associated with increased liver stiffness. Because the parameters included in the score increase when pathological processes occur in the liver, they indicate impaired liver function. To analyze this screening approach, we formed two groups of data based on the applied threshold for ARFI (5.5 kPa): one group was related to likely normal liver parenchyma (ARFI≤5.5 kPa; n =76); the other was related to increased parenchyma stiffness (ARFI>5.5 kPa; n =29; Fig. 5 ). The group with increased parenchyma stiffness had a greater interquartile range and a greater variance than the other group, and the mean HepScore value was significantly higher in unpaired t -test analysis (M[HepScore] normal ARFI =3.64; 95% CI: 3.04, 4.24; n =76 vs. M[HepScore] increased ARFI =5.72; 95% CI: 4.57, 6.88; n =29 with P =0.002). The mean value in the latter group, associated with increased parenchyma stiffness, can be classified as increased regarding the limit (>5 points); contrarily, the mean HepScore was not increased in the first group. Fig. 4 Receiver operating characteristic analysis of HepScore related to increased elastography ( bold line ). The gray diagonal indicates an area under the curve of 0.5 as reference. There is a good accuracy between the methods concerning their sensitivity and specificity. The optimum cut-off for HepScore (>5 points) was determined in Youden’s index analysis of this curve Fig. 5 Boxplot for HepScore values grouped by ultrasound elastography (acoustic radiation force impulse [ARFI]): <5.5 kPa (mean value of related HepScore: 3.64; n =76) and >5.5 kPa (mean value of HepScore: 5.72; n =29). HepScore values associated with increased elastography values are higher than in the group with normal elastography, including a higher median ( bold line inside the boxes: 5 points vs. 3 points) but also show a greater variance (bigger interquartile range, displayed by the greater box). The whiskers display 1.5 times the range of 1st and 3rd quartiles; two outliers are not included in the left boxplot
In an example of the follow-up of a single child, Fig. 6 displays a trend of the recorded parameters after bone marrow transplantation. These values were registered during routine follow-up of a 7-year-old boy with ALL between March 2015 and August 2016; he had a stem cell transplant in July 2015. Fig. 6 Liver iron trend in a 7-year-old boy who had bone marrow transplantation in July 2015, as indicated by follow-up ultrasound elastography (acoustic radiation force impulse [ARFI]), HepScore, MR relaxometry and number of blood transfusions. The HepScore and elastography values rise simultaneously in the period after transplantation after administration of multiple transfusions (total: 11 transfusions) and normalize later. MRI indicates rising liver iron concentration (LIC) in this period
During his treatment, a total of 11 blood transfusions were administered. He received most of them after his bone marrow transplantation, and they increased leading up to September 2015. The liver iron concentration, estimated from MRI, consequently rose. There were only three MRI values available and no MRI was performed directly after bone marrow transplantation because of isolation. ARFI remained low until bone marrow transplantation and rose to its peak afterward, but normalized within the next months. The HepScore reproduced this trend during bone marrow transplantation, but showed higher values in March 2015, which might have been confounded by liver effects from the disease.
Discussion
MRI is a true alternative for needle biopsies in assessing liver iron concentration [ , ], but it is also a relatively costly modality. An assessment is practical in the context of routinely planned screening. We achieved satisfying image quality for lower liver-iron concentration levels when using the sequence parameters described (Table 2 ). T2* was therefore used to calculate liver iron concentration as reference.
Various studies recommend ARFI for noninvasive diagnostics of increasing parenchyma stiffness as part of remodeling processes [ , , , , , ]. It might be sufficient for early detection of tissue damage, but ARFI imaging is not applicable for primary prevention screening; rather, ARFI serves as surrogate marker if structural changes have already occurred. As we did not observe a significant correlation between the liver iron concentration measurement on MRI and the elasticity values, the ARFI values are probably not influenced by iron but by other factors related either to treatments or to complications in serious ontological pathologies.
The ARFI limits vary in the literature depending on the machines and probes used [ ], the specific cohort studied, and the associated pathologies [ ]. We applied the upper normal range as a limit in order to increase the sensitivity in the context of early diagnosis. Numerous influences on ARFI values could affect the diagnostic accuracy when applying a low limit. Higher limits, as reported for early fibrosis diagnostics [ ], might be more recommendable because they are more specific. But they are also less sensitive; therefore complementing ARFI with the HepScore might partly resolve this problem by increasing the specificity for liver damage. We could neither ensure concrete liver iron concentration estimated from MRI nor confirm suspected tissue changes in ARFI imaging histologically by biopsies because of the risk of infection, complications, and added stress such invasiveness can cause in children, especially in the context of hematological diseases. This is an essential limitation of this study, but estimating liver iron concentration by T2* provides sufficient information for clinical purposes [ ].
Accuracy of ROC curve analysis between HepScore and ARFI was good, and further t- test analysis demonstrated significantly different mean values of HepScore grouped by ARFI. Based on these results, we applied the new HepScore for classification of affected liver tissue (increased if >5 points). Increased ARFI values (>5.5 kPa) in combination with an elevated HepScore probably imply alteration of liver tissue by means other than increasing liver iron concentration: Remodeling processes would increase parenchyma stiffness and affect liver function, e.g., manifesting in increasing HepScore, and if there were a direct influence of liver iron concentration on elasticity without pathological remodeling, liver function as well as HepScore should remain unchanged.
Both ARFI and HepScore trends showed a transient effect of liver parenchyma by simultaneous peaks in follow-up evaluation. Solitary increases of HepScore were observed in periods of severe infections or immunological reactions as a complication of bone marrow transplantation, which indicates that this score should be used only as a complement to ARFI evaluation. Transaminases or acute-phase proteins, such as C-reactive protein, are included in this score, which could explain these interactions. Single ARFI measurements showed high variability in the charts; this could be the result of numerous influencing factors, such as patient compliance and intra-observer variability [ , , ]. Comparing ARFI values with preceding measurements or combining it with trends of clinical parameters, e.g., HepScore, can increase ARFI’s validity [ ].
Some other causes of increased ARFI values, i.e. prandial influences on the biliary tract, body mass index or intraobserver variability (i.e. region-of-interest placement), are not supposed to influence serum parameters of liver function [ ] and could therefore be excluded as confounders for simultaneous increases in ARFI values and HepScore. Bone marrow transplantation and increased liver iron concentration often occur together; distinguishing whether one or both components caused increasing liver parenchyma stiffness was not possible. But ARFI and HepScore normalized over time, so pathological changes from bone marrow transplantation or transfusion seem to be at least partly reversible.
Bone marrow transplantation itself is a severe intervention, often causing complications affecting liver parenchyma. Graft-versus-host disease and infections can cause (transient) increases of liver stiffness [ , , , ]. Graft-versus-host disease occurred in three of our patients; two of them showed increased values of ARFI and HepScore, but MR-Fe 2+ was only increased in one. The third patient showed neither increased ARFI nor liver function effects by increased HepScore; MRI values were increased (related to numerous transfusions). So graft-versus-host disease seems not to have always affected liver stiffness, but the number of cases was too low for significant statements.
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [ , ], infectious hepatitis [ ] and veno-occlusive disease [ , ] can cause tissue damage and therefore affect ARFI values and cause increased HepScore, e.g., because of increased transaminases. Overestimating the influence of liver iron concentration is a possible consequence. Veno-occlusive disease was diagnosed in two patients after bone marrow transplantation, but ARFI and HepScore values did not show a related increase. One other patient was treated for infectious hepatitis before bone marrow transplantation, but fibrosis was not probable for this patient because the latency after infection (>20 years [ ]) is usually longer than the patient’s age at examination. ARFI values were normal for this patient, whereas HepScore was partly increased.
Patients needing a stem cell transplant usually receive extensive treatments, including hepatotoxic drugs. Patients with lymphoma, Ewing sarcoma, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and neuroblastoma, specifically, received multiple chemotherapeutics, which are supposed to be at least partly hepatotoxic. The therapy of Hodgkin lymphoma was less toxic but included a high dose of steroids. Other patients only received transfusions until their transplantation, i.e. treatment of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), Fanconi anemia or myelodysplastic syndromes. Because of the many variable pathologies and comorbidities in this cohort, there are multiple factors influencing our results, making it difficult to reproduce their effects in detail. Nevertheless, our findings confirm those of other studies that bone marrow transplantation possibly affects liver parenchyma through iron load as well as other complications [ , ].
Conclusion
There is no direct significant correlation between estimated liver iron concentration from MRI and liver stiffness. ARFI imaging can nevertheless be applied for early diagnostics of remodeling processes in liver tissue after multiple blood transfusions. Complementing ARFI imaging with the HepScore can increase the specificity in diagnosis of liver parenchyma damage.
