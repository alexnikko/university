Introduction
In 2004, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) introduced two guidance documents on the twenty-first century current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) and the process analytical technology (PAT) with the motives of modernizing and enhancing the regulation of pharmaceutical manufacturing and product quality [ , , , , ]. Central to this regulatory modernization is FDA’s concept of quality by design (QbD) that espouses “quality cannot be tested into products; it should be built-in or should be by design” [ ], and encourages pharmaceutical manufacturers to make use of new tools and apply science-oriented cGMP in decision-making, establishment of specifications, and evaluation of manufacturing processes, so as to improve process efficiency and product quality. FDA believes that this scientific approach will be able to facilitate continuous improvement and innovation in the pharmaceutical industries alongside minimizing risks.
For many decades, the chemical engineering community has been working out frameworks and methods for process design, optimization, and improvement under the scope of process systems engineering (PSE). Such a process systems approach explores alternative solutions within complex process economic and performance interactions. It is not easy to identify optimal solution through intuitive reasoning or simple calculations. As such, computer-aided numerical analyses are often deployed [ , , ]. In conjunction, model-based engineering approach applies mathematical process models in combination with observed data from the laboratory, pilot or plant. The objective is to enable exploration of the process decision space as fully and effectively as possible, in order to support design and operating decisions with accurate and realistic process information. Such process models can be used to optimize design, operation, monitoring, and control, leading to enhanced throughput and quality, reduced capital, operating, and energy costs [ ].
The PAT initiative promoted by FDA to complement the QbD ideology and the twenty-first century cGMP paradigm shift is very much in line with aforesaid process systems and model-based approaches. FDA defined PAT as “a system for designing, analyzing, and controlling manufacturing through timely measurements of critical quality and performance attributes of raw and in-process materials and processes with the goal of ensuring final product quality,” which incorporates a wide range of disciplines including chemical, physical, microbiology, mathematical, and risk-analysis conducted in an integrated approach [ , ]. The many PAT tools available for enabling scientific, risk-managed pharmaceutical developments and quality assurance can be categorized into four categories: (i) multivariate data acquisition and analysis tools, (ii) modern process analyzer or process analytical tools, (iii) process and endpoint monitoring and control tools, and (iv) continuous improvement and knowledge management tools [ ]. These tools provide multifaceted and potentially voluminous process information that enables better understanding of the processes, and thus help in the development of robust process control strategies for superior product assurance [ ]. This PAT initiative from FDA was deemed to be an important milestone for integrating with PSE from chemical engineering community in furthering pharmaceutical process innovations [ ]. Further, for the process development of small API molecules, which was traditionally dominated by chemistry-focused approaches, the appropriate use of PAT/QbD allows for better data analyses and promotes process understanding [ ].
Beyond the conceptual and technological fronts of PAT/QbD, its commercial viability is critical for determining whether pharmaceutical industries are adopting this paradigm shift. In a survey by Kourti and Davis [ ], pharmaceutical companies, e.g., Abbott (USA), AstraZeneca (UK), Bristol Myers Squibb (UK and USA), GSK (USA), Eli Lilly (USA), Merck (USA and Ireland), and Pfizer (USA), have acknowledged the business benefits of QbD. Some of these benefits include (i) more robust processes, (ii) significant reduction of batch failures, (iii) better process development, (iv) fast technology transfer to manufacturing, and (v) improved manufacturing efficiency worldwide. Furthermore, the same survey reported the extensive use of numerical modeling in conjunction to PAT/QbD for direct prediction of critical process parameters (CPPs) and critical quality attributes (CQAs).
Compounding the above ideological, technological, quality, and business considerations is a growing responsibility expected from pharmaceutical companies in social and environmental sustainability matters through a greater awareness from the public. This leads to the “triple bottom line” that concerns three fundamental pillars of sustainable development: environmental protection, economic growth, and social equity. Sustainable corporate governance is now part of public expectation for pharmaceutical companies [ ]. It would be expedient, therefore, to include critical manufacturing, process operations, and product quality information within each company’s sustainable corporate governance and management system.
In this paper, an attempt is made to link the three-tier levels of business enterprise, operations management, and process units with sustainable corporate governance outlook through a computational (in silico) study for developing or improving a potential QbD-based process application. That is, process monitoring and control, continual improvement with process optimization, and business value (economic profit) were simulated and numerically optimized with considerations for “cross-level” objectives and environmental impact. Such cross-level links potentially complement the traditional practice that decouples the three aforesaid levels of activities in pharmaceutical process development and manufacturing. The high-level framework of such an approach is first described before showcasing the in silico study performed for a consecutive epoxidation reaction optimized in a semi-batch reactor setting.
Three-Tier Framework for Linking Pharmaceutical Product Value Chain
What undergirds the drive to develop QbD-based and PAT-enabled processes transcends boundaries of analytical, technological, computational, engineering, and business aspects. An intended QbD/PAT application is found successful when it delivers quality product with science-oriented efficient process according to FDA’s paradigm of twenty-first century cGMP. Translating such an ideological vision into practical steps that integrates the aforesaid aspects is critical, but this can be elusive due to the complex nature of pharmaceutical processes that requires bespoke process development.
Figure 1 provides a three-tier framework that guided the in silico study herein. The process development of a QbD/PAT process overlaps with three distinct levels throughout the value chain of the product. At the top level is the business and enterprise level, within which the market forces of demand forecast and supply chain changes, stage of product lifecycle, regulatory requirements, etc. influence the business decision and operations for product quality and production amounts. Corporate executives deciding on business operations and sustainable corporate governance issues exchange information directly with enterprise systems, like ERP, MES, and SAP at this level (indicated by black solid line). These enterprise systems next exchange information with the middle tier operations level (depicted by light blue dotted lines). This is the level in which shop floor information from various unit operations is datalogged and managed. This middle tier can be further divided into operations management segments comprising risk and knowledge management activities with continuous improvement of processes (green solid lines). The business-related information is feedback to the enterprise systems and knowledge management acquires data from the data handler (data communications and database system) that passes process critical information between the SCADA/DCS system, multivariate data analysis, and control software (red solid lines). The data handler interfaces with on-the-fly process data coming from the individual unit operations at the process level (dark blue dotted lines), which can handle a variety of data, ranging from typical univariate values to multidimensional arrays. The control strategy triggers process operation parameter changes based on the real-time model-based information generated from multivariate data analyses. The bottom process level comprises the unit operations that perform the PAT-enabled process according to its process design space [ ]. Fig. 1 Strategic framework for QbD application in the product value chain across process units, operations, business and enterprise levels
The process design space can be explored and optimized in silico using numerical simulations under different process conditions. This approach requires a priori estimates of various process information that describe the intrinsic reaction kinetics, mass, heat, and momentum transfer of the chosen unit operation. Such process understanding can be derived from first principles (causal) theories, empirical equations, or statistical (correlation) models, so as to adequately simulate the desired transformational process. For this study, the correlation modeling approach through statistical design of experiment (DoE) based on partial least squares (PLS) model is applied to the simulated process so as to arrive at an optimized design space that maximizes process profitability with sustainability considerations.
Case Study: Epoxidation Reaction
The chosen case study, at the process level, is the consecutive epoxidation reaction of 2,5-di- tert -butyl-1,4-benzoquinone and tert -butyl hydrogen peroxide using a semi-batch reactor system. Full kinetics and thermodynamic parameters for this epoxidation reaction is available in the literature [ ]. Attenuated total reflectance-infrared (ATR-IR) spectroscopic data was a suitable inline analytics for PAT monitoring of this semi-batch process [ ]. The entire process dynamics and spectroscopic data were simulated using MATLAB/Simulink platform (version 7.3, R2009a) [ ]. Design of experiment and PLS modeling were performed using the Umetrics MODDE software (version 10) [ ].
Epoxidation Reaction Semi-batch System
The consecutive epoxidation reaction of 2,5-di- tert -butyl-1,4-benzoquinone has been widely studied and published in literature due to its simplicity and easy detection of component-specific mid-IR absorbance intensities, thus making it a suitable reaction for online monitoring of reaction progress. In particular, Zogg et al. [ ] applied ATR-IR spectroscopy as well as calorimetric data to elucidate kinetics and thermodynamics parameters and made comparison to earlier literature values.
As shown in Fig. 2 , the consecutive epoxidation of 2,5-di- tert -butyl-1,4-benzoquinone ( A ) to its mono-epoxide ( B ) and subsequently to di-epoxide ( C ) follows a simple pseudo-first-order series reaction, when tert -butyl hydrogen peroxide ( HP ) is present in excess [ ]. Triton B ( TB ) is the catalyst for this reaction, and in this simulation study, its concentration is assumed constant throughout the reaction. The reaction scheme can be mathematically described by the following system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs): $$ \frac{\mathrm{d}{n}_{\mathrm{A}}}{\mathrm{d}t}=-{r}_1{V}_{\mathrm{R}}=-{k}_1{c}_{\mathrm{A}}{c}_{\mathrm{TB}}{c}_{\mathrm{HP}}{V}_{\mathrm{R}}=-{k}_1\frac{n_{\mathrm{A}}{n}_{\mathrm{TB}}{n}_{\mathrm{HP}}}{{V_{\mathrm{R}}}^2} $$ (1) $$ \frac{\mathrm{d}{n}_{\mathrm{B}}}{\mathrm{d}t}=\left({r}_1-{r}_2\right){V}_{\mathrm{R}}={k}_1\frac{n_{\mathrm{A}}{n}_{\mathrm{TB}}{n}_{\mathrm{HP}}}{{V_{\mathrm{R}}}^2}-{k}_2\frac{n_{\mathrm{B}}{n}_{\mathrm{TB}}{n}_{\mathrm{HP}}}{{V_{\mathrm{R}}}^2} $$ (2) $$ \frac{\mathrm{d}{n}_{\mathrm{C}}}{\mathrm{d}t}={r}_2{V}_{\mathrm{R}}={k}_2\frac{n_{\mathrm{B}}{n}_{\mathrm{TB}}{n}_{\mathrm{HP}}}{{V_{\mathrm{R}}}^2} $$ (3) $$ \frac{\mathrm{d}{n}_{\mathrm{HP}}}{\mathrm{d}t}=-{r}_1{V}_{\mathrm{R}}-{r}_2{V}_{\mathrm{R}}=-{k}_1\frac{n_{\mathrm{A}}{n}_{\mathrm{TB}}{n}_{\mathrm{HP}}}{{V_{\mathrm{R}}}^2}-{k}_2\frac{n_{\mathrm{B}}{n}_{\mathrm{TB}}{n}_{\mathrm{HP}}}{{V_{\mathrm{R}}}^2} $$ (4) where n A , n TB , n HP , n B , and n C are the number of moles of A, TB, HP, B, and C, respectively (mol); r 1 and r 2 are the reaction rate of reactions 1 and 2, respectively (mol/L/s); V R is the volume of the reaction mixture (L); c A , c TB , and c HP are the concentration of A, TB, and HP, respectively (mol/L); and k 1 and k 2 are the rate constant of reactions 1 and 2, respectively (L 2 /mol 2 /s). The concentration of the catalyst TB is assumed to be constant throughout the reaction; thus, \( \frac{\mathrm{d}{n}_{\mathrm{TB}}}{\mathrm{d}t}=0 \) . Fig. 2 Consecutive epoxidation of 2,5- tert -butyl-1,4-benzoquinone with tert -butyl hydrogen peroxide
The rate constants k 1 and k 2 follow the Arrhenius equation and are dependent on the temperature and the activation energy of the reaction, as described by: $$ {k}_{\mathrm{i}}={A}_0 \exp \left(\frac{-{E}_{\mathrm{A},\mathrm{i}}}{R_{\mathrm{g}}T}\right) $$ (5) where k i is the rate constant of reaction i (L 2 /mol 2 /s), A 0 is the pre-exponential factor (L 2 /mol 2 /s), E A,i is the activation energy of reaction i (J/mol), R g is the ideal gas constant (J/mol/K), and T is the reaction temperature (K). The activation energy, E A,i , and pre-exponential factor, A 0 , are highly correlated if the Arrhenius equation is written in its standard form (Eq. 5 ). In order to break the correlation, the Arrhenius expression (Eq. 5 ) is reformulated to an expression relative to a reference temperature (Eq. 6 ) to obtain more reliable estimates for the kinetic parameters. $$ {k}_{\mathrm{i}}={k}_{\mathrm{i},{T}_{\mathrm{ref}}} \exp \left(\frac{-{E}_{\mathrm{A},\mathrm{i}}}{R_{\mathrm{g}}}\left(\frac{1}{T}-\frac{1}{T_{\mathrm{ref}}}\right)\right) $$ (6) where \( {k}_{\mathrm{i},{T}_{\mathrm{ref}}} \) is the rate constant at the reference temperature T ref (L 2 /mol 2 /s).
The epoxidation reaction is carried out in a semi-batch system. Thus, there is additional information of a control strategy by introducing the dosage of A, TB, and HP as well as allowing an output flow at the desired set point. The above system of ODEs (Eqs. 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 ) is modified to include the dosing and discharge dynamics: $$ \frac{\mathrm{d}{n}_{\mathrm{A}}}{\mathrm{d}t}=-{k}_1\frac{n_{\mathrm{A}}{n}_{\mathrm{TB}}{n}_{\mathrm{HP}}}{{V_{\mathrm{R}}}^2}-{v}_{\mathrm{out}}\frac{n_{\mathrm{A}}}{V_{\mathrm{R}}}+{v}_{\mathrm{A},\mathrm{in}}{c}_{\mathrm{A},\mathrm{in}} $$ (7) $$ \frac{\mathrm{d}{n}_{\mathrm{B}}}{\mathrm{d}t}={k}_1\frac{n_{\mathrm{A}}{n}_{\mathrm{TB}}{n}_{\mathrm{HP}}}{{V_{\mathrm{R}}}^2}-{k}_2\frac{n_{\mathrm{B}}{n}_{\mathrm{TB}}{n}_{\mathrm{HP}}}{{V_{\mathrm{R}}}^2}-{v}_{\mathrm{out}}\frac{n_{\mathrm{B}}}{V_{\mathrm{R}}} $$ (8) $$ \frac{\mathrm{d}{n}_{\mathrm{C}}}{\mathrm{d}t}={k}_2\frac{n_{\mathrm{B}}{n}_{\mathrm{TB}}{n}_{\mathrm{HP}}}{{V_{\mathrm{R}}}^2}-{v}_{\mathrm{out}}\frac{n_{\mathrm{C}}}{V_{\mathrm{R}}} $$ (9) $$ \frac{\mathrm{d}{n}_{\mathrm{TB}}}{\mathrm{d}t}={v}_{\mathrm{TB},\mathrm{in}}{c}_{\mathrm{TB},\mathrm{in}}-{v}_{\mathrm{out}}\frac{n_{\mathrm{TB}}}{V_{\mathrm{R}}} $$ (10) $$ \frac{\mathrm{d}{n}_{\mathrm{HP}}}{\mathrm{d}t}=-{k}_1\frac{n_{\mathrm{A}}{n}_{\mathrm{TB}}{n}_{\mathrm{HP}}}{{V_{\mathrm{R}}}^2}-{k}_2\frac{n_{\mathrm{B}}{n}_{\mathrm{TB}}{n}_{\mathrm{HP}}}{{V_{\mathrm{R}}}^2}-{v}_{\mathrm{out}}\frac{n_{\mathrm{HP}}}{V_{\mathrm{R}}}+{v}_{\mathrm{HP},\mathrm{in}}{c}_{\mathrm{HP},\mathrm{in}} $$ (11) $$ \frac{\mathrm{d}{V}_{\mathrm{R}}}{\mathrm{d}t}={v}_{\mathrm{A},\mathrm{in}}+{v}_{\mathrm{TB},\mathrm{in}}+{v}_{\mathrm{HP},\mathrm{in}}+{v}_{\mathrm{Solvent},\mathrm{in}}-{v}_{\mathrm{out}} $$ (12) where v out is the output flow rate (L/min); v A,in , v TB,in , v HP,in , and v Solvent,in are the dosing flow rate of A, TB, HP, and solvent, respectively (L/min); and c A,in , c TB,in , and c HP,in are the dosing concentration of A, TB, and HP, respectively (mol/L). The dosing flow rate is calculated as $$ {v}_{\mathrm{j},\mathrm{in}}=\frac{V_{\mathrm{j},\mathrm{dose}}}{D_{\mathrm{dose}}} $$ (13) where V j,dose is the dosage volume of material j (L) and D dose is the duration of dosage (min). The output flow rate v out is calculated as $$ {v}_{\mathrm{out}}=\frac{V_{\mathrm{R},\mathrm{discharge}}}{D_{\mathrm{discharge}}} $$ (14) where V R,discharge is the volume of the reaction mixture at the time of discharge (L) and D discharge is the duration of discharge (min).
In this case study, we assume that the useful product is the mono-epoxide, the intermediate component (B), in the reaction. Therefore, it would be desirable for the amount of B in the reaction mixture to be as high as possible before discharge. The selectivity ratio of B is defined as $$ {\mathrm{Ratio}}_{\mathrm{B}}=\frac{n_{\mathrm{B}}}{n_{\mathrm{A}}+{n}_{\mathrm{C}}} $$ (15)
The reactor will discharge all the reaction mixture present once a desired discharge ratio, SetRatio B , is reached, i.e., Ratio B ≥ SetRatio B . After emptying the reactor, the next cycle of dosing a fresh set of reactants A, TB, and HP begins, and the process repeats.
There are several assumptions made in this semi-batch reaction model: 1. The kinetic parameters, k 1 and k 2 , are based on T ref = 17 °C. 2. The reaction mixture is assumed to be homogeneous and well mixed. 3. No mass transfer dynamics are involved, i.e., all dosed species are mixed homogenously once entering the reactor. 4. The reaction is performed in an isothermal environment.
The process parameter values used in this case study are listed in Table 1 . Figure 3a shows the typical simulation run result with molar quantity profiles of A, B, and C from the semi-batch reaction system. Reactant A is dosed together with HP and TB at the beginning of the cycle so the amount of A is the first to increase. As the consecutive epoxidation reaction progresses, A is consumed to produce B and concurrently B is consumed to produce C. As shown in Fig. 3a , initially, B increases at a faster rate and then slows down as its consumption rate gets closer to its production rate. Once the selectivity ratio of B, Ratio B , reaches the desired discharge ratio SetRatio B , discharge is triggered. After the reactor is emptied and the product is collected, the next cycle begins.

ATR-FTIR Spectra Simulation and OPC Communication Protocol
The ATR-FTIR spectra associated with the epoxidation reaction cycles of Fig. 3a were computationally generated using simulated component spectra of the individual species, in a similar fashion as that reported by Chew et al. [ ], to produce the spectra observed during the reaction described by the bilinear matrix equation: $$ {R}_{m\times v}={C}_{m\times s}\cdotp {r}_{s\times v} $$ (16) where R m × v is the ATR-FTIR spectra for all the species present in the reaction mixture with m the number of spectra and ν the spectroscopic channels, C m × s is the molar concentration of the s number of spectroscopically observed species present in the mixture, and r s × v is the component spectra for the individual species of given molar absorptivity at a measured spectroscopic wavenumber [ ]. Figure 3b shows the component species simulated spectra for A, B, and C used in this simulation. Pure reference spectra obtained via laboratory measurements can also be used. In such simulations, the bilinear matrix spectral relations would be the same whether simulated or real reference component spectra were used. Figure 3c shows the spectra data produced by the ATR-IR spectra simulations from t = 0 to 120 min for the above semi-batch system.
The use of object linking and embedding (OLE) for process control (OPC) communication protocol, which is an open connectivity architecture based on Microsoft technology [ ], is demonstrated herein as a communication platform enabling interoperability between process analytics, data sharing, control, and automation, so as to achieve real-time monitoring and control for better process understanding and achieving PAT’s goal of QbD in the manufactured products. This OPC protocol resides within the data handler module noted in Fig. 1 . With the help of the OPC server, the simulated spectra data from MATLAB/Simulink epoxidation kinetics simulation was analyzed using the appropriate chemometrics calculations (in the multivariate data analyses module in Fig. 1 ) to unravel the chemical information underlying in the multivariate spectroscopic data for real-time process monitoring and control. The OPC server used in this simulation was the free Matrikon OPC simulation server provided by Matrikon Inc. With the necessary chemical information, suitable process control strategy was then proposed to achieve the desired product output specifications through the control strategy module depicted in Fig. 1 .
In this in silico study, it was observed that the simulated spectra from Simulink and the read spectra after transferring through the Matrikon OPC server were exactly the same, that is, there were no information losses or modification through OPC protocol transference (see Fig. 4a ). However, it is important to note that a minimum time delay of 0.5 s is required for the writing of the values into the Matrikon OPC server tags before reading it to ensure proper exchange of data. This delay time is probably due to the lag time in writing the data by the OPC server. Even though there is a slight time delay, it does not affect the use of OPC in practical real-time data acquisition and on-the-fly calculations for most cases. In the event faster reaction kinetics was involved, this OPC time delay could become a concern. Fig. 4 a Comparison of spectra data from simulation and OPC transferred data at i t = 0 min, ii t = 9 min, and iii t = 70 min. b Comparison of molar quantity from simulation and OPC transferred data
In addition to the spectra data simulation, the molar data of the chemical species from the simulation and that transferred from the OPC server after chemometrics analysis were also compared. The estimated molar species present in the reactor based on the chemometrics analysis read from the OPC server were close, if not the same, to the simulation results, except for some minor numerical errors. The errors might be due to the computational inaccuracies caused by the chemometrics calculations, which is expected in any regression methods. Results from the OPC simulation without reactor discharge are shown in Fig. 4 . Figure 4a shows the comparison of the spectra data obtained from the simulated ATR-IR probes, shown by the solid lines, and the spectra data after passing through the OPC server, represented by cross markers, at three different times, t = 0, 9, and 70 min. This figure confirms the accuracy in the exchanging of data through the OPC server. Figure 4b shows the molar quantity profiles of the three components A, B, and C with respect to the reaction time, where the solid lines represent the simulated exact molar quantity present in the reactor, while the cross markers represent the estimated molar quantity based on the spectra data read from Matrikon OPC server and performing the necessary regression analysis to on-the-fly spectra data generated via MATLAB/Simulink. As such, in actual manufacturing situations, real-time multivariate data from CPPs and chemometrics calculations can be readily processed via OPC.
Linking Process Parameters and Optimization to QbD Concepts of Criticality, Design Space, and Control Strategy
The practical outworking of the FDA-proposed QbD ideology can be captured in manufactured product quality through the concepts of criticality, design space, and control strategy [ ], which are concepts introduced in the ICH Q8, Q9, Q10, and Q11 [ ]. Referring to Fig. 1 , criticality at the process level includes key measurable material attributes and process parameters that influence the desired product quality [ ]. The design space, according to ICH Q8 (R2), encompasses the “multidimensional combination and interaction of input variables and process parameters that have been demonstrated to provide assurance of quality” [ ]. With the measurable parameters defined, better process understanding that is bounded by the design space, it is next possible to specify and implement a control strategy at the operations level [ ], together with suitable PAT tools across both process and operations levels, for controlling critical control points that affects process efficiency via a distributed control system.
Beyond the immediate process and operational concerns, the three aforesaid concepts are also crucial for high-level decision-making and long-term continual improvements through knowledge management and risk management delineated in ICH Q10. Typically, during the process development phase, it is not possible to fully identify or define all CPPs given the information on CQA of the pharmaceutical product. Thus, continual investigations and improvements are to be made so as to gain knowledge and refine the process understanding throughout the product life cycle [ ]. Such a paradigm for improving criticality alongside control strategy refinements continually keep the design space robust and pave the way for an integration of process science, operational excellence, and enterprise risk management. This is depicted in our three-tier framework (Fig. 1 ) in which the exchanges from process and operational levels to the top business and enterprise level are interlinked through information processes and IT integration between enterprise systems, data handler, and SCADA/DCS via the intermediary layer for risk management, continuous improvement, and knowledge management. Furthermore, we highlighted the potential link of the varied knowledge repositories within enterprise systems (in databases) to integrate business operations with sustainable corporate governance at the top tier.
In our present in silico study, considerations for criticality comprise the selected value of SetRatio B for product B and associated semi-batch operation CPPs. These influenced the overall process efficiency of maximizing product (B) while minimizing other chemical species. The identification of CPPs was carried out through performing a DoE study from simulating a semi-batch reactor system for producing the product, given the known physicochemical information of the process. In conjunction with DoE is multivariate modeling (see “ Epoxidation Reaction Semi-batch System ” section) for identifying statistically robust CPPs that generate commercially viable operating conditions with due considerations for sustainability (see “ Linking Process Operations and Analytics to Process Economics and Sustainability ” section). Once CPPs are identified, the design space is systematically explored given the control strategy devised for optimizing operating conditions (see “ Epoxidation Reaction Semi-batch System ” and “ ATR-FTIR Spectra Simulation and OPC Communication Protocol ” sections).
Linking Process Operations and Analytics to Process Economics and Sustainability
The process and operations levels are ultimately linked to the business and enterprise level through the process economics, vis-à-vis profitability of the process unit. In this case study, we consider monetary profit as the only economic indicator, which can be easily calculated from simulation results. Profit is calculated as $$ \mathrm{Profit} = \mathrm{Revenue}\hbox{--} \mathrm{Raw}\ \mathrm{Material}\ \mathrm{Cost}\hbox{--} \mathrm{Purification}\ \mathrm{Cost}\hbox{--} \mathrm{Manpower}\ \mathrm{Cost} $$ (17) $$ \mathrm{Revenue} = {\varSigma}_{24\kern0.1em \mathrm{h}}{n}_{\mathrm{B}} \times \mathrm{Price}\ \mathrm{of}\ \mathrm{B} $$ (18) $$ \mathrm{Raw}\ \mathrm{Material}\ \mathrm{Cost} = \left({\varSigma}_{24\kern0.1em \mathrm{h}}{V}_{\mathrm{A},\mathrm{dose}} \times \mathrm{Cost}\ \mathrm{of}\ \mathrm{A}\right) + \left({\varSigma}_{24\kern0.1em \mathrm{h}}{V}_{\mathrm{HP},\mathrm{dose}} \times \mathrm{Cost}\ \mathrm{of}\ \mathrm{H}\mathrm{P}\right) $$ (19) where Σ 24 h n B , Σ 24 h V A,dose , and Σ 24 h V HP,dose is the amount of B produced (mol), and 24 h usage of A (L) and HP (L), respectively.
All economic factors in the above equations are calculated on a 24-h (or 1 day) basis using the variable costing method, that is, only manufacturing costs that vary with output are included as product costs; all other costs, such as overhead and all fixed costs, are neglected [ ]. Revenue is calculated based on the amount of B produced in 24 h. Raw material costs are calculated based on the amount of A and HP used in 24 h. The catalyst TB and solvent are assumed to be recyclable and reused at fixed costs, so their cost is excluded from profit calculation. More complicated catalyst degradation kinetics and recovery cost for solvent and catalyst can be included, if necessary, to enhance the simulation should these have significant impact on process profitability. Downstream purification cost is assumed to be a constant operational cost per batch (or cycle) and calculated based on the number of batches per day, i.e., 24 h divided by the cycle time. The purification process is conducted in a downstream unit that includes total removal and recycling of solvent and catalyst TB, and isolation of product B. Manpower cost is a charged operational cost per day. The economic parameter values used in this case study are given in Table 1 .
Process sustainability covers multiple aspects such as material consumption, energy consumption, waste generation, emissions, and health and safety considerations. In this case study, we focus on one aspect of sustainability, that is, waste generated in 24 h. Waste is considered to be the total amount of A and C generated downstream besides the collected product B. Solvent, catalyst TB, and unreacted HP are assumed to be recyclable and not wasted. More sophisticated process sustainability models can be formulated and incorporated into the calculations if necessary.
Process Optimization and Design Using Design of Experiment and Partial Least Squares Modeling
For this study, a statistical DoE and PLS model were applied to the simulated process so as to arrive at an optimized design space that maximizes process profitability in this epoxidation semi-batch case study. The Umetrics software MODDE was used to perform DoE and PLS modeling on process data from the aforesaid MATLAB simulation and chemometrics calculations.
Identifying Optimal Factors for a Specified Quality Target SetRatioB
Five operating parameters (factors) have been identified for DoE study, that is, dose volume of A, TB, HP, solvent (Sol), and temperature (Temp). The desired response (objective) is profit per day. The base case of 1 L A, 1.25 L TB, 0.8 L HP, 27.5 L solvent, and 30 °C temperature, denoted as {A, TB, HP, Sol, Temp} = {1, 1.25, 0.8, 27.5, 30}, is taken to be the center point in a full factorial DoE with ±20% taken to be the high/low level for each factor. Since there are five factors, the full factorial design consists of (2 5 + 1) = 33 sets of operating conditions, including the center point. The desired discharge ratio, SetRatio B , is fixed at 1.3 for all simulation runs. This SetRatio B is the basis by which quality is designed into the semi-batch epoxidation process.
The 33 simulated runs and profits are presented in Table 2 . Out of the 33 runs, four runs (18, 20, 26, and 28; italicized in Table 2 ) do not reach the required SetRatio B of 1.3, resulting in negative profit due to manpower cost. To find the operating parameters with maximum profit, a statistical regression analysis was performed using PLS modeling. The statistical software MODDE [ ] was used for building a statistical model that represents the relationship between the response (profits) and the five factors with data from the 33 simulated runs. The five independent factors and their interaction factors were used for the PLS modeling and yield a goodness of fit, R 2 = 0.922, and goodness of prediction, Q 2 = 0.672, at 95% confidence. Figure 5a shows the coefficients (scaled and centered) of this first PLS model. The large difference in R 2 and Q 2 values indicates that PLS model revision is necessary.

On further inspection of the first PLS model, regression terms with coefficient error bars spanning across both negative and positive ranges were removed, i.e., A * TB, A * Sol, A * Temp, TB * HP, TB * Sol, TB * Temp, and Sol * Temp. A revised PLS model was calculated with the remaining regression terms. Their estimated values and error bars were found to be more statistically robust compared to the first model (see Fig. 5b ). Though the revised R 2 value, 0.904, is slightly lower than that of the first PLS model since fewer factors were included, it is within the very good range above 0.9. The revised Q 2 value has greatly improved to 0.846 and is much closer to the corresponding R 2 value.
In this revised model, it is observed that all factors, besides solvent (Sol) and one remaining interaction factor with solvent, display positive correlation to profits. All five factors are critical, with HP being the most critical and having the most impact on profit, followed by A and Sol. We can also see that all three remaining interaction factors have HP as one of the factors, which supports the indication that HP is the most critical factor. Through the aforesaid DoE/PLS analyses, the criticality information is arrived at for generating commercially viable solutions within the design space based on the control strategy for the semi-batch reactor system designed for producing product B of desired discharge ratio SetRatio B that satisfy quality requirements.
Using this revised PLS model and the built-in optimizer in MODDE, the maximum profit conditions found from DoE/PLS modeling coincides with run 30 (Table 2 ; numbers in bold font), which has the highest profit of $47,059/day. We now extend the design space boundary to ±25, 30, 35, and 40% through MATLAB simulations, to see if further increase in profit can be achieved. That is, PLS factors that positively correlate with profits will increase while those inversely correlated shall decrease, both at the same percentage change from the base case. The results are presented in Table 3 . With ±25% boundary, the maximum profit increases to $58,203/day, and ±30% boundary increases the maximum profit further to $68,129/day. However, the reaction could not reach the required discharge ratio of SetRatio B = 1.3 at ±35 and ±40% operating conditions. This procedure of optimizing profit by extending the design space boundary is illustrated schematically in Fig. 6 . Through this in silico simulation, it was predicted that the setting at ±30% {1.3, 1.625, 1.04, 19.25, and 39} as the design set point would optimize profit for our semi-batch epoxidation reaction.

Evaluating the Effects of Changing Target SetRatioB
The above results were obtained using a discharge ratio of SetRatio B = 1.3. In a similar profit optimization approach, we now systematically look into the impact of varying SetRatio B . The entire 33 runs are resimulated with SetRatio B = 1.2 and 1.5. For SetRatio B = 1.2, all 33 runs are able to reach the required discharge ratio. Run 30 {1.2, 1.5, 0.96, 22, 36} again gives the highest profit, $41,696/day. The boundary can be extended as far as ±40% resulting in maximum profit increase to $78,757/day, and at ±45%, the reaction fails to reach the discharge ratio of 1.2. For SetRatio B = 1.5, 20 runs could not reach the required discharge ratio, including run 30. The highest profit of $29,321/day is obtained from run 29 operating parameters, which has the same dosage settings as run 30 except its temperature is 24 °C rather than 36 °C. The best results from these further optimizations are summarized in Table 4 .

Furthermore, Table 4 highlights a trade-off involved in the different discharge ratios. Reaching a lower discharge ratio takes less time, so more product can be discharged within the same 24-h production time and therefore higher profit. However, a lower discharge ratio also means lower conversion and more waste at the time of discharge, which is comparatively more detrimental to the environment. This trade-off between profit and waste highlights the intrinsic trade-off involved between the economic and environmental aspects of sustainability, which has to be considered during business decision-making. Other business considerations, such as risk management [ , ] and process safety, can be taken into account based on the design operating parameters obtained with the aforesaid strategic three-tier framework coupled with QbD principles and PAT tools.
For this in silico study, there were some assumptions made to the model to reduce the mathematical complexity involved. Exploring optimal operating conditions within the design space of this DoE study was set to be a uniform percentage around the center point (base case) for all five factors. More sophisticated optimization algorithms can be implemented by exploring the design space for each factor individually. If necessary, the mathematical models can include the mass transfer dynamics within the system as well as the heat lost to the surroundings into the simulation process, so as to better approximate practical situations. Moreover, degeneration of the catalyst may be included to make the whole simulation more realistic and a closer representation of experimental findings. Even without the abovementioned physicochemical considerations programmed into our present simulations, this in silico study demonstrates capabilities to simulate, predict, optimize, and design a reaction process according to QbD principles so as to generate Pareto-optimal solutions that highlights process profitability and sustainability. The model can be extended to include other sustainability aspects such as energy consumption, emissions, and other environmental impacts. Furthermore, it is possible to incorporate more sophisticated modeling linking multiple process units within the entire manufacturing line. Defining economic and sustainability performance for each process unit within a specific product line allows a systematic way of tracking overall triple bottom line scores across process, operations, and business/enterprise levels.
Conclusion
A strategic three-tier framework that facilitates product value chain understanding and in silico simulation in accordance to QbD principles and PAT guidelines was presented herein. Through the simulation of a consecutive semi-batch epoxidation process between 2,5-di- tert -butyl-1,4-benzoquinone and tert -butyl hydrogen peroxide, the feasibility of OPC was demonstrated for exchanging real-time data between the OPC server and the client computers without significant data losses or major inaccuracies. Enabled by this OPC platform, real-time data from process analytical instruments can be easily transferred from in situ spectroscopic techniques, such as infrared and Raman spectroscopy, at the process and operations levels. Multivariate spectroscopic data can then be analyzed immediately with the appropriate chemometrics methods to obtain the necessary chemical information at short time intervals, improving understanding of the process unit in real time. Such real-time understanding enables testing of process control strategies, allowing the achievement of better product quality and specifications, as seen in the successful in silico optimization of the proposed semi-batch process control strategy for an epoxidation reaction. At the business/enterprise level, such optimization simulations highlighted a set of Pareto-optimal process parameters that display the intrinsic trade-off between profit maximization and negative environmental impact. This information enables better decision-making for achieving more holistic sustainability goals with both business and environmental fronts considered. This overall approach that provides data and information linkages between a strategic framework via in silico simulations would greatly reduce the amount of time, resources, and money required in extensive postproduction investigations for optimizing product quality and process efficiency, and simultaneously achieve the goal of QbD recommended by the FDA PAT guidelines.
