INTRODUCTION
Malaria is an infectious disease caused by five species of protozoa of the genus Plasmodium ( falciparum , malariae , ovale , vivax , and knowlesi ) ( , ). Malaria was one of the worst health problems in the 2000s according to the World Health Organization (WHO), with approximately 200 million cases and an estimated 584,000 deaths from the disease. People living in the underdeveloped regions were the most vulnerable. In 2013, 90% of malaria deaths in the world occurred in Africa, and more than 430,000 African children died before age five ( , ).
Eliminating malaria in countries with high transmission rates is a long-term goal. The World Health Organization published in 2015 the “World Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016–2030” with the aim of reducing the incidence and mortality of malaria. Among the pillars to combat malaria, we must emphasize the importance of ensuring universal access to prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, limiting antimalarial drug resistance, improving efficacy, and implementing appropriate pharmacotherapy.
In 2015, Pharmacologist Youyou Tu received the Nobel Prize for discovering artemisinin ( ) which has saved the lives of millions of people, halving the mortality rate of malaria during the past 15 years. Some cases of resistance to this drug have been reported ( , ), indicating a need to constantly monitor the drug resistance to artemisinin in malaria-endemic countries. Other therapeutic options available for malaria are very limited, inadequate, and problematic ( ). Then, the research and development of new drugs and medicines for malaria to provide safer and more effective alternatives than those available today remains a necessity ( ).
Quinine (QN) is used in intravenous treatment in cases where there is resistance to chloroquine and other drugs. The great advantage of QN hydrochloride as an antimalarial drug lies in its appropriate solubility for intravenous formulations. Therefore, it is particularly relevant in the treatment of patients who do not tolerate oral medication, although the high dose required in intravenous administration can cause hypotension, cardiotoxicity, and hypoglycemia ( ). Although QN has been prepared by synthesis, the procedure is complex. Thus, QN is currently obtained only from natural sources. The use of natural compounds from biological sources remains an important alternative for the development of new commercial products, particularly for the treatment of neglected tropical diseases ( ).
Curcumin, a natural product, is an active ingredient extracted from the rhizomes of Curcuma aromatica Salisb. Linn. and the main curcuminoid present in saffron oil. It has low toxicity and a wide range of pharmacological activities, including anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antioxidant, and antiparasitic ( , , ). Some studies have shown that the mechanism of action of curcumin for its antiparasitic action can be varied; for example, it can inhibit histone acetyltransferase ( ), induce the production of reactive oxygen species ( ), and bind with hypoxanthine-guanine-xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase in P. falciparum ( ). The effect of curcumin in experimental cerebral malaria has been demonstrated ( , ) and is probably due to suppression of the Th1 cytokine response and induction of the Th2 cytokine response ( ). Some authors also suggest that its antiparasitic activity is associated with the presence in its structure of a β-dicarbonyl system, which consists of conjugated double bonds (diene) ( , ) . However, its clinical applications have been limited due to its low aqueous solubility. Curcumin is unstable at neutral and basic pH and is quite susceptible to photodegradation ( ).
Several strategies have been proposed to enhance the bioavailability and efficacy of drugs. One promising method to circumvent the problems of degradation, poor aqueous solubility, and low bioavailability is the association of drugs or natural products to colloidal carriers such as nanocapsules (NC) ( , ).
The formulation and evaluation of novel drug delivery systems is less expensive than developing new drugs, and therapeutic failure has often been attributed to adverse drug effects and to the noncompliance of patients due to inconvenient dosing schedules. Few studies have reported employing NC as carriers for antimalarial drugs, and all of them have used systems with negative zeta potentials. Halofantrine has been encapsulated in poly(ɛ-caprolactone) (PCL) ( ), polylactide acid (PLA), and PLA/PEG ( , ), and QN has been nanoencapsulated using PCL as the polymer ( ). In these studies, a system formed by PCL NC using an inert oil in the core (caprylic/capric triglyceride) proved to decrease the QN effective dosage after encapsulation by 30% in P. berghei -infected rats as well as to reduce the deleterious effects induced by the free drug. Thus, the aim of this study was to develop and characterize cationic and anionic NC containing QN with an oil-based core composed of Curcuma oil (CO) and to evaluate its physicochemical characterization, QN photostability, and in vivo efficacy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Material
Poloxamer 188 ® (P188), PCL, Eudragit ® RS100 (ERS), curcumin (76% purity), QN base, and QN hydrochloride were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Polysorbate 80 (P80) was obtained from Delaware (Porto Alegre, Brazil). Lecithin (Lipoid ® S45) was obtained from Lipoid AG (Germany). Curcuma aromatica oil (CO) was purchased from Mundo dos Oleos (Brazil). Milli-Q ® water was used for high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. Acetonitrile, acetone, and other reagents were of analytical grade.
Effect of Curcuma Oil on PCL or ERS Films
A PCL film and an ERS film were prepared using a polymer dissolved in acetone. After solvent evaporation, the films were put in contact with CO. After 60 days, the films were removed from the oil, dried with adsorbent paper, and weighed after 1 min. The study was performed in triplicate and aimed to evaluate if the oil could prevent the nanocapsules’ formation. The results were expressed as mass loss variation.
Chromatographic Profile of Curcuma Oil
The quantification of the curcuminoids in CO was performed on a Shimadzu LC system (Kyoto, Japan) which consisted of a LC-20AT pump, a SPD-M20A photodiode array (PDA) detector, a CBM-20A system controller, a DGU-20A 3 degasser, and a SiL-20A autosampler. Briefly, the mobile phase was composed of acetonitrile, methanol, and 1% triethylamine solution (pH 3) in a proportion of 52:3:45 ( v / v ). The flow rate was 1.0 mL/min, and detection was performed at 424 nm. The calibration curve of curcumin was prepared in acetonitrile in the range 0.5–9 μg/mL ( R 2 > 0.999). CO was dissolved in acetone/acetonitrile (50:50), filtered (0.45 μm), and injected into the HPLC (20 μL).
Factorial Design and Data Analysis
A four-factor, two-level design (2 ) was applied for the optimization of the nanoformulations. The independent factors and dependent variables used are listed in Table I . The formulations with different combinations of factors and levels were denominated from F1 to F16. Table I Independent Variables Evaluated on 2 4 Factorial Independent variables Levels Responses (− 1) (+ 1) CO (mg/mL) (X 1 ) 330 660 Particle size Polymer (X 2 ) PCL ERS Zeta potential Aqueous phase surfactant (X 3 ) P80 P188 pH QN (X 4 ) No Yes P188 poloxamer 188 ® , PCL poly(ɛ-caprolactone), ERS Eudragit ® RS100, QN Quinine, P80 Polysorbate 80, CO Curcuma aromatica oil
The responses evaluated were particle size, zeta potential, and pH. The effect of each variable and the interaction between variables that influenced the responses are shown in a Pareto chart. The variance analysis (ANOVA) provided the estimated effects and coefficients that were used for the construction of equations for each response. The equation generated by this experimental design was given as follows: $$ {Y}_0\kern0.5em =\kern0.5em {b}_0\kern0.5em +\kern0.5em {b}_1{X}_1\kern0.5em +\kern0.5em {b}_2{X}_2\kern0.5em +\kern0.5em {b}_3{X}_3\kern0.5em +\kern0.5em {b}_4{X}_4\kern0.5em +\kern0.5em {b}_{12}{X}_1{X}_2\kern0.5em +\kern0.5em {b}_{13}{X}_1{X}_3\kern0.5em +\kern0.5em {b}_{14}{X}_1{X}_4\kern0.5em +\kern0.5em {b}_{23}{X}_2{X}_3\kern0.5em +{b}_{24}{X}_2{X}_4\kern0.5em +\kern0.5em {b}_{34}{X}_3{X}_4\kern0.5em +\kern0.5em {b}_{123}{X}_1{X}_2{X}_3\kern0.5em +\kern0.5em {b}_{124}{X}_1{X}_2{X}_4\kern0.5em +\kern0.5em {b}_{234}{X}_2{X}_3{X}_4\kern0.5em +\kern0.5em {b}_{134}{X}_1{X}_3{X}_4\kern0.5em +{b}_{1234}{X}_1{X}_2{X}_3{X}_4 $$ where Y 0 was the dependent variable (response), b 0 was the intercept, b 1 to b 123 were the regression coefficients computed from the observed experimental values of Y , and X 1 , X 2 , X 3 , and X 4 were the coded levels of the independent variables.
The quality of the interactive fitted model was evaluated by the analysis of coefficient of determination ( R 2 , %). The adjusted R 2 accounted for the number of predictors in the model and was useful for comparisons with other models with different numbers of predictors. The software used was Minitab 14 (Minitab Inc., USA).
Preparation of Curcuma Oil/Quinine-Loaded Nanocapsules
QN-loaded nanocapsules were obtained by interfacial deposition of the polymer ( , ). Briefly, the organic phase contained the drug in its basic form (quinine base); CO, surfactant (Lipoid S45 ® ), polymer, and acetone were dissolved with stirring and moderate heating in a water bath. After complete solubilization, the organic phase was poured through a funnel into the aqueous phase with surfactant (P188 or P80) and adjusted to pH 4.0. Then, the solution was transferred to an evaporator flask and concentrated on a rotary evaporator to remove the organic solvent and to make the final adjustment of the QN concentration (2 mg/mL). The formulations were prepared in triplicate. The formulations were named from F1 to F16 as described in Table II .

Characterization of Nanocapsules Formulation
Particle Size
The particle size was measured by the technique of laser diffraction using a Mastersizer 2000 analyzer (Malvern Instruments, UK) to detect the presence of microparticles. The laser diffraction data obtained were evaluated using the D 4.3 value, which is the average particle size diameter based on the number of particles. The value of the span, which is an indication of the polydispersity of the system, was also used to characterize the formulations.
Zeta Potential
The zeta potential of the suspensions was determined using a Zetasizer® Nano ZS3600 (Malvern Instruments, Westborough, MA). The samples were diluted in a 1 mM solution of sodium chloride (previously filtered, 0.2 μm) and then analyzed using capillary cells (DTS1060). The zeta potential was expressed in millivolts (mV) ( n = 3).
Determination of pH
The pH of the suspensions was measured after their preparation with the aid of a potentiometer calibrated previously (Hanna Instruments, São Paulo, Brazil). The results represented the mean of three determinations.
Validation on Experimental Design
The regression model was validated through the preparation of a formulation with intermediate values for each factor evaluated. For this, one formulation (F17) containing 480 mg/mL CO ( X 1 ), PCL as the polymer ( X 2 ), P80 as the surfactant of the aqueous phase ( X 3 ), and without QN ( X 4 ) was prepared for the validation. The consequent experimental values of the responses were quantitatively compared to the predicted values.
Determination of Drug Content
For the determination of QN content, the suspensions were treated with acetonitrile, leading to the dissolution of the components and QN. Quantification was performed by HPLC, using a 45:35:20 ratio of acetonitrile/methanol/0.01% triethylamine as the mobile phase. The column used was Waters RP-18 column, and the wavelength of detection was 232 nm ( ). Experiments were performed in triplicate. The drug content (% w / w ) was calculated as shown in Eq. 1 . $$ \mathrm{Drug}\kern0.17em \mathrm{content}\kern0.5em =\kern0.5em \frac{\mathrm{mass}\kern0.17em \mathrm{of}\kern0.17em \mathrm{quinine}\kern0.17em \mathrm{in}\kern0.17em \mathrm{nanoparticles}\kern0.5em \times \kern0.5em 100}{\mathrm{mass}\kern0.17em \mathrm{of}\kern0.17em \mathrm{nanoparticles}\kern0.17em \mathrm{recovered}} $$ (1)
Evaluation of Encapsulation Efficiency
The QN encapsulation efficiency was determined by HPLC using the ultrafiltration–centrifugation technique ( ). The difference between the total concentration of QN (content, as described above) in the formulation and the amount present in the aqueous phase of the suspension (QN not associated) was the encapsulation efficiency. The determination of QN in the ultrafiltrate aqueous phase was performed by the centrifugation of the suspensions for 5 min at 5000 rpm using an ultrafiltration device (Ultrafree, Millipore ® ). The concentration of QN not associated was quantified in the ultrafiltrate.
Photostability Study
This experiment was carried out to investigate if the nanoparticulate structure can decrease the quinine degradation against UVA radiation. QN nanoformulations (F1, F5, F7, F9, F13, F15) were fractionated in 2-mL polystyrene cuvettes, placed in a mirror chamber for a period of 8 h, and exposed to degradation power (30 W) UVA light (352 nm) within the chamber (67 × 24.1 × 19.5 cm, H × L × W), with the light intensity of 165 lx. Samples were taken every hour (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 h) in triplicate. For the solution analysis pattern of QN, an aliquot of 1 mL was diluted in a volumetric flask of 10 mL of acetonitrile. A volume of 100 μL of each formulation was removed from each aliquot and diluted in acetonitrile following the method described for determining the QN content. All samples were quantified by HPLC, and the results were evaluated by the percent degradation ( ). Additionally, the mathematical modeling of the QN degradation profile was performed using Micromath Scientist (v.2.1) software to fit zero-order (Eq. 2 ), first-order (Eq. 3 ), or second-order (Eq. 4 ) kinetics. The best model was chosen based on which had the highest regression coefficient, on the model selection criteria, and on the best graphic adjustment. $$ C\kern0.5em =\kern0.5em Co\kern0.5em -\kern0.5em Kt $$ (2) $$ \ln C\kern0.5em =\kern0.5em \ln Co\kern0.5em -\kern0.5em Kt $$ (3) $$ \frac{1}{C}\kern0.5em =\kern0.5em \frac{1}{Co}\kern0.5em +\kern0.5em Kt $$ (4)
Atomic Force Microscopy
The morphology of the samples was examined by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Agilent Technologies 5500 equipment). AFM images were acquired at room temperature in non-contact mode using high-resolution SSS-NCL probes (Nanosensors, force constant = 48 N/m, resonance frequency = 154 kHz). Images were captured and analyzed using PicoView 1.14.4 software from the Molecular Imaging Corporation and were analyzed using PicoImage 5.1 software. For the analysis, the nanosuspensions were diluted in Milli-Q water (1:200) and were dropped onto a freshly cleaved mica substrate.
Antimalarial Efficacy in Plasmodium berghei-Infected Mice
All animal procedures were reviewed and approved by the Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee of the Federal University of Pampa (036/2014). Five-week-old female mice weighting 25–35 g were used for all procedures ( n = 6/group). On day 0, Swiss mice were infected by the i.p. route with 10 6 Plasmodium berghei -infected erythrocytes. The animals were treated from day 0 to the third day post-infection by the i.p route ( , ) with doses of QN every 12 h (40 mg/kg/day) as follows: QN hydrochloride, F9, F10, F13, F14, negative control group (saline), and positive control (chloroquine, 10 mg/kg/day). Regarding the negative controls, the volume administered was the same as the formulations with QN (around 0.25 mL). The parasitemia was analyzed on days 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19 after the infection. The percentage of infected erythrocytes was determined in blood films fixed with methanol and stained with Giemsa after at least 600 red cells were counted in five microscopic fields (oil immersion, ×1000 magnification). If the blood films were free of Plasmodium after at least 200 red cells were checked, they were considered cured but were kept under observation to monitor for eventual relapses. The average percent suppression of parasitemia was calculated on the fifth day ( ) (Eq. 5 ).
$$ \%\mathrm{Suppression}\kern0.5em =\kern0.5em 100\kern0.5em \times \kern0.5em \frac{\mathrm{Saline}\kern0.5em -\kern0.5em \mathrm{Test}}{\mathrm{Saline}} $$ (5) where Saline was the mean percent parasitemia in the control group and Test was the mean parasitemia in the treated group.
Statistical Analysis
The analysis of factorial results is described in the section “ Factorial Design and Data Analysis .” Statistically significant differences between formulations in the in vitro evaluations were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey test using the SigmaStat software. Statistical significance was set as p < 0.05. The in vivo results were evaluated using repeated measures one-way ANOVA (survival curve) with Bonferroni’s test or one-way ANOVA (parasitaemia and survival time).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Effect of Curcuma Oil on Polymer Films
It is fundamental to determine that the selected oil is a non-solvent for the polymer as previously demonstrated for PCL formulations containing caprylic/capric triglyceride instead of benzyl benzoate ( ). This is a simple evaluation based on a swelling or dissolution experiment carried out with PCL and ERS films immersed in the candidate oil for the formulation. After 60 days, the PCL showed less than 3% modification in relation to its initial bulk mass (1.8 ± 0.9 and 2.8 ± 0.7% after 15 and 60 days, respectively). For ERS, the variation was approximately 4.5%, with values of 3.6 ± 0.2 and 4.6 ± 0.2% after 15 and 60 days, respectively. Thus, the results indicated that this oil did not swell or dissolve the PCL/ERS films, thus making it suitable for use in the nanocapsule particle formulations ( , ).
Determination of Three Curcuminoids in Curcuma Oil
Curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, and bisdemethoxycurcumin are the pharmacologically significant curcuminoids present in Curcuma longa L. In this work, we used the Curcuma aromatica species; thus, the elucidation of the chromatographic profile of Curcuma oil was fundamental. Standard curcumin obtained from Sigma (C7386) was a mixture of curcuminoids containing at least 65% curcumin. In the case of our batch, this value was 76%. The chromatogram of standard curcumin is shown in Fig. 1 a. The elution sequence was bisdemethoxycurcumin, demethoxycurcumin, and curcumin with retention times of 8, 9, and 10.2, respectively. This order agrees with the literature reports that used reversed-phase chromatography for the curcuminoids separation ( , ). From the obtained peak areas (Fig. 1 b), the contents of curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, and bisdemethoxycurcumin were found to be 34.4 ± 1.4, 29.0 ± 1.3, and 36.3 ± 1.1%, respectively. The total content of curcuminoids in the CO was 0.675 mg/mL.

Effect of Variables on Particle Size
All results were analyzed using the Minitab 14 for Windows software. Sixteen experiments were carried out, and each of them was replicated three times. All possible combinations among the factors were evaluated, and the matrix was established according to the two levels represented by (+ 1) and (− 1) (Table I ). The effect of each factor ( X 1 , X 2 , X 3 , X 4 , and their interactions) on the particle-size response can be observed in the Pareto chart (Fig. 2 a). A vertical line (parallel to the y -axis) indicated that the main effect was significant (the control factor does influence the response) if the factor crosses beyond the red line. The greater the slope of the line, the stronger the effect produced. We will discuss the four factors/interactions most important in the determination of each response. Fig. 2 Pareto chart of the factors analyzed. a Particle size. b Zeta potential. c pH. For all charts, A (X 1 , CO), B (X 2 , polymer), C (X 3 , surfactant), D (X 4 , drug)
According to analysis of variance, the sum of the squares was used to estimate the factors’ effects on particle size. The results were analyzed using the software for a 95% confidence level ( α = 0.05), and main effects and interactions between factors were examined. Equation 6 showed that particle size was positively or negatively influenced by the factors, in agreement with Fig. 2 . The sum of the squares is an important factor for analyzing the suitability of the model, which should be closer to the unit. By analyzing the particle size response, R 2 values and R 2 (adjusted) were 94.14 and 91.09%, respectively.
The model proposed for particle size is as follows (Eq. 6 ): $$ \mathrm{Particle}\ \mathrm{size}\kern0.5em =\kern0.75em 420\kern0.5em +319.1\kern0.5em \times \kern0.5em {X}_1\kern0.5em +280.4\kern0.5em \times \kern0.5em {X}_2-293.3\kern0.5em \times \kern0.5em {X}_3\kern0.5em +87.5\kern0.5em \times \kern0.5em {X}_4\kern0.5em -\kern0.5em 26.8\kern0.5em \times \kern0.5em {X}_1{X}_2\kern0.5em +72.7\kern0.5em \times \kern0.5em {X}_1{X}_3\kern0.5em +\kern0.5em 140.7\kern0.5em \times \kern0.5em {X}_1{X}_4\kern0.5em +5.8\kern0.5em \times \kern0.5em {X}_2{X}_3\kern0.5em -\kern0.5em 166.7\kern0.5em \times \kern0.5em {X}_2{X}_4\kern0.5em +155.8\kern0.5em \times \kern0.5em {X}_3{X}_4\kern0.5em -\kern0.5em 68.7\kern0.5em \times \kern0.5em {X}_1{X}_2{X}_3\kern0.5em +110\kern0.5em \times \kern0.5em {X}_1{X}_2{X}_4\kern0.5em -\kern0.5em 187.2\kern0.5em \times \kern0.5em {X}_1{X}_3{X}_4 $$ (6)
In the nanoprecipitation method, factors such as the nature and concentration of the polymer in the organic phase, the polarity of the solvents, the nature and concentration of the surfactants, and the concentration and characteristics of the oil used are essential for determining the size of the nanoparticles ( , , ). The average particle size of the PCL nanocapsules varied from 194 ± 15 to 660 ± 78 nm, and that of the ERS nanocapsules from 198 ± 3 to 1064 ± 2 nm (Table II ). Similar particle sizes were observed with PCL nanocapsules ( , ). When X 1 , X 3 , and X 4 remained fixed and X 2 was changed from PCL to ERS, an increase in the particle diameter was observed for all formations, as observed for F1 ( X 2 = PCL, 348 ± 16 nm) and F5 ( X 2 = ERS, 722 ± 11 nm) or F12 ( X 2 = PCL, 194 ± 15 nm) and F16 ( X 2 = ERS, 299 ± 12 nm). Nanocapsules prepared with sorbitan monooleate ( ) or sorbitan monostearate ( ) showed higher diameters when used with PCL instead of ERS. This result can be attributed to the ability of ERS to act as surfactant because of its cationic characteristics ( ). In our work, nanocapsules were prepared using lecithin, sorbitan monostearate, and sorbitan monooleate as the organic-phase surfactant, but in all formulations the diameters were micrometric. Therefore, the formulations containing ERS were optimized without surfactant in the solvent phase. For all formulations, the SPAN values were below 2.5, thus being considered adequate for polymeric nanocapsule development.
The Pareto charts established that another factor responsible for the individual variations in diameter was the CO concentration ( X 1 ). Lower concentrations are generally used as the oil core for nanocapsule formulations ( ). Aiming to use an oil-based core with pharmacological activity, in this study we attempted to optimize the formulations with higher oil concentrations; thus, we assessed the concentration of 660 mg/mL. Formulations with a higher concentration of CO had diameters from 348 ± 16 to 1064 ± 2 nm (F1 and F8), while 194 ± 15 to 357 ± 38 nm were observed for F12 and F9, respectively, which were prepared with lower CO concentrations. As expected, increasing the concentration of CO resulted in a significant increase in the average size of the nanocapsules, as seen by comparing F10 to F2 (242 ± 16 and 660 ± 78 nm, respectively) or F12 to F4 (194 ± 15 and 530 ± 39 nm, respectively). The core composition has been an important factor that has influenced the particle size of nanoparticulate systems such as oil-core self-organized nanovesicles ( ), lipid-core nanocapsules ( ), solid-lipid nanoparticles ( ), and nanocapsules ( ). The concentration of turmeric oil was an important factor for obtaining nano-sized particles. Concentrations below 20 mg/mL were required to obtain chitosan-alginate nanocapsules with particle sizes < 300 nm ( ). According to the authors, the solubilization of the oil in P80 and ethanol, used as the organic solvent, was fundamental for the formation of droplets that contained a lower concentration of turmeric oil and relatively more ethanol. Then, ethanol diffused easily during the nanocapsule formation process, leading to particles with small sizes. In our study, nanoparticles < 300 nm were readily obtained with 330 mg/mL of CO regardless of the polymer and o/w surfactant used.
Factor X 3 also had an important influence on particle size. Surfactants used in the non-solvent phase had the role of reducing the interfacial tension between the phases, thus facilitating the diffusion of solvent into the aqueous phase ( ) and reducing the size of droplets ( ) as well as avoiding the formation of polymer flakes ( ). Consequently, the surfactants can influence the system characteristics, such as size, drug loading, and drug stability. High hydrophile–lipophile balance (HLB) surfactants were selected in this work: P80 and P188 (HLBs of 15.0 and 29.0, respectively). The nanocapsules prepared with P188 as the surfactant showed diameters of 194 ± 15 to 648 ± 22 nm, and those prepared with P80 showed diameters of 198 ± 3 to 1064 ± 2 nm. ERS/P188 nanocapules exhibited smaller particle sizes than those prepared with ERS/P80, as seen for F5 (722 ± 11 nm) and F7 (519 ± 26 nm) or F13 (216 ± 6 nm) and F15 (291 ± 9 nm). This result could be associated with the higher HLB of P188 which decreases the interfacial tension and consequently reduces the particle size. A slight difference was demonstrated in nanocapsules made with P188 and PCL (F2 versus F4 and F10 versus F12), except formulations prepared with PCL, P188, and QN (F3 and F11), which, independent of the CO concentration used, precipitated upon the evaporation of the organic phase. PCL nanocapsules prepared with both surfactants did not show significant differences in diameter values ( , ). On the other hand, most of the studies have demonstrated the influence of the hydrophilic surfactant. Some researchers showed a decrease in the particle size in PCL or PLGA nanocapsules prepared with P80 compared to the same nanocapsules prepared with P188 ( ).
Effect of Variables on Zeta Potential
The regression analysis for the zeta potential response suggested a linear model with sufficient design points to estimate the coefficients (Eq. 7 ). The R 2 and R 2 (adjusted) values were 99.36 and 99.06%, respectively. $$ \mathrm{Zeta}\ \mathrm{potential}\kern0.5em =\kern0.5em 3.19\kern0.5em -\kern0.5em 0.01275\kern0.5em \times \kern0.5em {X}_1\kern0.5em +\kern0.5em 22.6833\kern0.5em \times \kern0.5em {X}_2\kern0.5em +\kern0.5em 6.91667\kern0.5em \times \kern0.5em {X}_3\kern0.5em -\kern0.5em 0.06667\kern0.5em \times \kern0.5em {X}_4\kern0.5em +\kern0.5em 0.00755051\kern0.5em \times \kern0.5em {X}_1{X}_2\kern0.5em -\kern0.5em 0.00883838\kern0.5em \times \kern0.5em {X}_1{X}_3\kern0.5em -\kern0.5em 0.0030556\kern0.5em \times \kern0.5em {X}_1{X}_4\kern0.5em +\kern0.5em 8.225\kern0.5em \times \kern0.5em {X}_2{X}_3\kern0.5em -\kern0.5em 0.625\kern0.5em \times \kern0.5em {X}_2{X}_4\kern0.5em -\kern0.5em 0.925\kern0.5em \times \kern0.5em {X}_3{X}_4\kern0.5em -\kern0.5em 0.00575758\kern0.5em \times \kern0.5em {X}_1{X}_2{X}_3\kern0.5em -\kern0.5em 0.00199495\kern0.5em \times \kern0.5em {X}_1{X}_2{X}_4 $$ (7)
The factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed a significant effect of the type of polymer ( X 1 ) on the zeta potential (Fig. 2 b). The surface properties of nanocarriers are important determinants of cell interactions. PCL, an anionic polymer, has been shown to contribute to the modulation of the drug-release profile, the improvement of the photochemical stability, the control of the drug penetration/permeation into the skin, and the increase of the pharmacological response ( ). The cationic surface also has facilitated the binding with negatively charged cell membranes, which had increased the brain penetration ( ), cellular uptake of plasmid DNA ( ), and interaction with microorganisms ( ) and modulated the mucosal penetration ( , ). ERS has been specifically addressed in articles aiming to improving vaginal ( ), cutaneous ( ) and ophthalmic ( , ) delivery, antifungal activity ( ), and bioavailability ( ). However, no research has assessed the interaction of this cationic polymer with protozoa such as Plasmodium .
The average values were either positive, ranging from + 12.53 to + 41.15 mV, or negative, ranging from − 19.68 to − 42.22 mV (Table II ), if formulations were prepared with ERS or PCL, respectively. ERS is a copolymer of acrylic and methacrylic acid esters containing 4.5 and 8.8% of quaternary ammonium groups, respectively. Similar zeta potential values were observed in other studies using ERS and P80 ( , ) or ERS and P188 ( , ). On the other hand, the preparation of PCL nanoparticles by solvent displacement led to the dissociation of the carboxylic groups as soon as precipitation occurred. As a result, the polar groups in PCL were located on the particle surface, making the zeta potential negative ( , ).
The Pareto chart showed that the surfactant influenced the zeta potential (Fig. 2 b), either alone or in interactions ( X 2 – X 3 or X 3 – X 4 ). Keeping X 1 , X 2 , and X 4 fixed, the surfactant had impact on the zeta potential. In terms of the PCL nanocapsules, formulations with P80 are less negative than P188 suspensions, as can be observed by F4 versus F2 (− 40.63 ± 1.59 and − 25.43 ± 0.75 mV, respectively). In fact, PCL nanocapsules have been stabilized by P80-lecithin coatings (Bender et al. 2012) ( ), and the surface potential was a result of the PCL (as mentioned above) and the presence of lecithin and impurities that also contributed to the negative charge on the particle surface ( ). Lecithin is a heterogeneous mixture of phospholipids, such as phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylglycerol, and others ( ). The presence of P80 was enough to coat the surface area of the nanocapsules and prevent their coalescence due to steric stabilization effect ( ). When P188, a polyethylene and polypropylene oxide derivative, was used as a stabilizer, the anchoring of the surfactant on the surface of nanocapsules prepared by nanoprecipitation resulted in a low density of anchored P188 molecules and a high surface charge density of lecithin ( , ).
Formulations that had the same amount of oil/polymer/surfactant but that incorporated QN displayed an alteration of the zeta potential, becoming more negative (for PCL nanocapsules) or more positive (for ERS nanocapsules), which could be due to ionization of the drug molecule functional groups located on the surface of the particles, as discussed below.
Effect of Variables on pH
The pH was strongly influenced by the polymer ( X 2 ), drug presence ( X 4 ), stabilizer ( X 3 ), and interaction between the surfactant and quinine ( X 3 – X 4 ). The R 2 values and R 2 (adjusted) were 98.39 and 97.65%, respectively, and the mathematical model proposed by the 2 4 factorial design was (Eq. 8 ): $$ \mathrm{pH}\kern0.5em =\kern0.5em 5.91\kern0.5em +\kern0.5em 0.000573232\kern0.5em \times \kern0.5em {X}_1\kern0.5em +\kern0.5em 0.795\kern0.5em \times \kern0.5em {X}_2\kern0.5em -\kern0.5em 0.549333\kern0.5em \times \kern0.5em {X}_3\kern0.5em -\kern0.5em 0.502333\kern0.5em \times \kern0.5em {X}_4\kern0.5em -\kern0.5em 0.000590909\kern0.5em \times \kern0.5em {X}_1{X}_2\kern0.5em +\kern0.5em 0.000417172\kern0.5em \times \kern0.5em {X}_1{X}_3\kern0.5em +\kern0.5em 0.000143434\kern0.5em \times \kern0.5em {X}_1{X}_4\kern0.5em +\kern0.5em 0.534833\kern0.5em \times \kern0.5em {X}_2{X}_4\kern0.5em -\kern0.5em 0.0365\kern0.5em \times \kern0.5em {X}_3{X}_4\kern0.5em +\kern0.5em 0.000398485\kern0.5em \times \kern0.5em {X}_1{X}_2{X}_3\kern0.5em -\kern0.5em 0.0010399\kern0.5em \times \kern0.5em {X}_1{X}_2{X}_4\kern0.5em -\kern0.5em 0.00112374\kern0.5em \times \kern0.5em {X}_1{X}_3{X}_4 $$ (8)
Among the three studied factors, X 2 (the polymer) was the most important for pH (see Fig. 2 c). PCL and ERS nanocapsules exhibited pH ranges from 4.8 to 7.17 and 5.76 to 7.78, respectively. These results could be explained by the polymer chemical structure. Formulations prepared with PCL showed a more acidic pH values. PCL is a biocompatible and biodegradable polyester containing carboxylic groups that can be exposed, thus generating the acidic pH ( , ). On the other hand, ERS is a copolymer of ethyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, and a small amount of a methacrylic acid ester with quaternary ammonium groups (trimethylammonioethyl methacrylate chloride). These basic clusters justified the more basic pH values observed in the ERS formulations ( , , ).
The presence of the drug ( X 4 ) significantly changed the pH. QN, or (R)-[(1S,2S,4S,5R)-5-ethenyl-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-yl](6-methoxyquinolin-4-yl) methanol (the IUPAC name), is a basic alkaloid that increased the pH of the formulations containing it (Table II ) ( ). It was possible to relate these results to the zeta potential (Fig. 2 b). Quinine-loaded ERS nanocapsules showed zeta potentials that were more positive than their respective unloaded nanocapsules (for example, F5 = 16.7 ± 0.21 mV and F6 = 13.1 ± 0.75 mV). QN has a pK a = 8.7 (quinolone group) ( ) and, at a neutral to slightly basic pH, e.g. , 7.43 (F5), an increase in the molecule ionization occurs, generating an excess of positive charges on the surface. NC prepared using PCL as the polymer also exhibited a more basic pH when QN was encapsulated, and their zeta potentials were more negative. The zeta potential of nanoparticles also depends on the ionization of the stabilizer. In the case of this batch of nanocapsules, lecithin, an interfacial anionic surfactant, became ionized as the pH increased due to the presence of smaller quantities of lipidic acids, such as phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylglycerol. These phospholipids were ionized at pH 7.0, which induced a negative surface charge on the particles ( , ).
Validation of Experimental Design
With the aim of verifying whether the model could be applied to nanoparticles designed with specific characteristics, the F17 sample was prepared. The conditions for F17 were as follows: 480 mg/mL CO ( X 1 ), PCL ( X 2 ), P80 ( X 3 ), and without quinine (Table II ). The difference between the value calculated using the regression equation and the measured value was less than 10% for all responses. For example, the particle size found was 383 ± 16 nm, and the difference between this value and the value predicted by the equation was 2%. In the cases of the zeta potential and pH, the measured and calculated values differed 3.6 and 7%, respectively.
Drug Content and Encapsulation Rate
NC prepared by the solvent displacement process has been studied for the last 25 years. The drug content and encapsulation efficiency are particularly important characteristics that determine their in vitro and in vivo performance. These characteristics depend on the specific fabrication parameters, such as the formulation composition ( ), employed to prepare the particles in the system ( ). The drug content ranged from 0.8 to 1.0 (% w / w ). The results showed similar values in the formulations prepared with 660 mg/mL CO. These values were 0.87 ± 0.07, 0.82 ± 0.01, and 0.81 ± 0.01% w / w for F1, F5, and F7, respectively. The decrease in CO concentration resulted in 0.94 ± 0.06, 0.81 ± 0.06, and 0.87 ± 0.01% w / w (F9, F13, and F15, respectively).
The encapsulation efficiencies obtained in this study were 33.7, 61.4, 59.0, 68.0, 64.8, and 62.0% for F1, F5, F7, F9, F13, and F15, respectively. The solubility of QN in CO was determined to be 36 mg/mL. Briefly, the saturation concentration of CO was determined by saturating the oil with QN and submitting it to vortex mixing. After 24 h of storage and centrifuge separation, the supernatant oil was diluted with acetonitrile and analyzed by HPLC-UV. With this solubility value, it was not expected that QN encapsulation efficiencies could be higher than those obtained using concentrations greater than 1 mg/mL, as was used in this work (2 mg/mL).
Photostability Study
Quinine is a standard drug used to calibrate UV radiation intensity from light sources used in light stability tests of pharmaceutical products ( ) due to its photoinstability ( ). To elucidate whether the nanocapsules could similarly improve the photostability of the encapsulated QN, three replicates were performed for each QN-loaded nanocapsule formulation (F1, F5, F7, F9, F13, and F15). In these studies, the QN base solubilized in acetonitrile was exposed to an incandescent lamp (UVA radiation, 352 nm) to investigate the degradation kinetics. The results of the photodegradation of QN in different systems are summarized in Table III . The free QN residual content versus time was plotted and adjusted by a biexponential-order kinetic model. The apparent degradation rate constant was 0.00059/h, and the half-life of degradation ( t 1/2 ) was 1180.93 ± 12.32 h. In relation to nanoencapsulated QN, the results showed that all formulations followed the biexponential model (MSC ranged from 1.81 to 2.87), except F15. For the bicompartmental kinetic order, the quinine t 1/2 from nanocapsules was significantly higher than the free drug. Among the nanoformulations, F13 showed the slowest degradation of the drug, which was approximately 5.5 times higher than free QN.

According to the results, nanocapsules were able to protect QN from UVA light exposure when compared to QN in the solution (Table III ). The free drug demonstrated almost 30% degradation after 8 h. All formulations presented improvement in terms of photodegradation, from 1.38 (F15) to 5.5 times (F13). Thus, the photodegradation (%) was QN free > F15 > F5 > F7 > F9 > F1 > F13. All PCL formulations (F1, F7, and F9) showed a decrease of at least three times in degradation (values less than 10%). It was evident that the degradation of QN was markedly suppressed by its encapsulation. The improvement described above in the stability of the antimalarial drug within the nanocapsules could be attributed to physical protection due to the presence of the polymeric wall. This physical barrier isolated the drug from light, reducing the photosensitive character of the drug, as demonstrated by the protective effects of PCL nanocapsules on quinine ( , ), clobetasol ( ), tretinoin ( ), benzophenone ( ), curcumin ( ), resveratrol ( ), betamethasone dipropionate ( ), QN ( ), and dithranol ( ). ERS has also demonstrated a similar photoprotective effect for clotrimazole ( ). The polymeric protection exhibited in this study could be due to the characteristics of the PCL and ERS, which are semicrystalline and facilitate light reflection, thus preventing the direct contact of the light with the encapsulated drug ( ). Curcumin can also protect other drugs from degradation induced by light due to its antioxidant character ( ), while it is also a photosensitive molecule. However, we did not assess the effect of nanoencapsulation on the curcumin photoprotection in this experiment or the possible QN degradation protection induced by the phenolic compound.
AFM Analysis
To confirm the size measurement results, AFM served as an additional method to demonstrate that the prepared nanocapsules could be classified as potential nanoscale drug delivery systems. In addition to delivering a general size overview, AFM allowed the characterization of the shape and surface structure of the investigated samples. The AFM images for F9, F10, F13, and F14, along with the corresponding analysis by laser diffraction, are shown in Fig. 3 . Fig. 3 AFM images ( first column ) and laser diffractometry distribution ( second column ) of F9 , F10 , F13 , and F14
The analysis of these images showed that the nanoparticles were spherical and that the surface structure featured no significant phenomena, indicating that a smooth surface, in addition to a homogenous size distribution, could be assumed—results that were consistent with the SPAN values obtained from the nanoparticles. The mean sizes of the nanoparticles revealed by AFM (approximately 300 nm for F9, 250 nm for F10, 200 nm for F13, and 180 nm for F14) were in good agreement with the results obtained by laser diffraction.
Antimalarial Activity
Considering the results mentioned above, the QN-loaded ERS and P80 nanocapsules showed nanometric particle size (216 ± 6 nm), positive zeta potential (+ 13.6 ± 0.52 mV), neutral pH (7.78 ± 0.0), high drug content (0.81 ± 0.06% w / w ) and encapsulation rate (64.8%), and photoprotection to QN (5.1 ± 0.13%); thus, this formulation was selected for the additional in vivo tests. Another formulation that stood out among the presented results was F9, consisting of PCL/P80 nanocapsules. In addition to these, F10 and F14 were also analyzed as formulations without QN.
Aiming to show the suitability of the CO- and CO/QN-loaded nanocapsules for antiplasmodial treatment, the in vivo efficacy was tested regarding the survival and parasitemia progression in a mouse model of the disease. P. berghei -infected mice treated with CO, QN, CO plus QN, F9, F10, F13, and F14 nanocapsules (40 mg/kg/day), as well as control groups showed different profiles of parasitemia and survival. The results are summarized in Fig. 4 and Table IV . The statistical differences are shown in relation to the negative (saline) and positive (chloroquine) groups. Fig. 4 Survival curves of the Plasmodium berghei -infected Swiss mice ( n = 6 per group). The dose was established on 40 mg/kg/day (QN) and 10 mg/kg/day (chloroquine, CQ) Table IV Percentage of Suppression, Mean Parasitemia, and Mean Survival Time in P. berghei -Infected Mice ( n = 6/group) Group % Suppression Mean parasitemia (%)* Mean survival time (days)* Mean survival curve** Saline – 5.76 ± 2.06 b 10.3 ± 1.0 b b CO 23 8.18 ± 4.96 b 13.7 ± 2.0 ab – Free quinine 41 4.88 ± 2.31 13.0 ± 1.8 b b CO+quinine 33 7.31 ± 5.12 11.5 ± 3.0 b b F9 51 5.78 ± 3.60 15.3 ± 2.0 a a F10 9 8.04 ± 4.48 b 11.0 ± 3.2 b b F13 61 8.49 ± 5.67 b 14.3 ± 3.3 ab a F14 60 4.76 ± 3.46 14.9 ± 5.6 ab b Chloroquine 88 0.37 ± 0.51 19.7 ± 1.6 a a ***One-way ANOVA ( p < 0.05); repeated measures one-way ANOVA ( p < 0.05) a Difference in relation to saline b Difference in relation to chloroquine
The negative control group showed higher and progressive parasitemia and 100% mortality approximately 10 days after infection with similar parasitemia levels, as have been reported in the literature for this model ( , ). Parasitemia was not significantly reduced after successive administrations of QN, and it was slightly increased after 4 days of treatment ( ). Chloroquine was used as positive control group and showed low levels of parasitemia throughout the experiment, with healing of 100% of the animals in 13 days (Table IV ). On the other hand, F10 and F14 (unloaded nanocapsules groups) showed comparable results to the saline group (% mean parasitaemia, % survival expressed in % and days; Table IV ; Fig. 4 ) suggesting no toxicity to formulations.
The parasitemia (%) on the fifth day was used as indicative to % suppression (Table IV ). Comparing QN and saline, the % parasitaemia of the free drug was almost half of the saline group (3.5 versus 6% for QN and saline, respectively, median values) and became comparable to saline only 11 days after the infection. QN showed a % suppression higher than free CO (41 and 23%, respectively). The CO/QN-loaded nanocapsules demonstrated superior efficacy in relation to the control groups. F9 was a PCL nanocapsule with an oil-based core encapsulating CO and QN. This combination has synergistic effect when compared with F10, free QN, and CO. F14 showed a high suppression value (60%), which could be attributed to the fact that this methodology uses only the mean parasitemia value of the groups, not the individual values. A similar system (QN-loaded PCL nanocapsules) showed an almost 30% reduction compared to the effective dose of free QN in P. berghei -infected rats, which could be attributed to the increase in the erythrocyte partition coefficient provided by the nanocarrier ( ).
At the end of the 19-day experiment, all animals had died, except the animals in F9 (1/6), F14 (2/6), and chloroquine (6/6) group, resulting in 16.6, 33.3, and 100% of survival (Fig. 4 ) up to 19 days. Then we analyzed progress of survival (Fig. 4 ) using repeated measures ANOVA. Both F9 and F10 showed a significant difference in relation to all other groups ( p < 0.001) but not between them.
Curcuminoids have shown antimalarial activity in both in vitro and in vivo tests against distinct species of Plasmodium ( , ). Curcumin was combined with other antimalarials in experimental therapy, as curcumin/piperine/chloroquine ( ) and β-arteether and curcuminoid-loaded liposomes ( ), with positive results. Therefore, the effects of combining curcumin/curcuminoids and QN is not yet known. Our study showed that the synergistic effect of this association is only with nanoencapsulation (Saline × F9, p < 0.001; Saline × F13, p < 0.001). In relation to chloroquine, F9 and F13 showed no difference in the survival curve.
PCL nanocapsules have been reported to increase the efficacy of drugs used for the treatment of parasitic diseases, such as QN ( ), lychnopholide ( ), halofantrine ( ), amphotericin B ( ), and curcumin ( ). Until now, the effect of positively charged nanocapsules on malaria has not been described in the literature, only cationic nanoemulsion/antisense oligonucleotide complexes (without drugs) ( , ). The membrane of the erythrocytes infected by P. falciparum have appeared to become more negative than the non-infected erythrocytes ( ). In fact, antimalarial drugs such as chloroquine, QN, and primaquine are positively ionized at physiological pH, thus facilitating their interactions with the malaria parasite-infected red cells. Our results showed that nanoencapsulation could provide a synergistic effect of the curcuminoids combined with antimalarial drugs. The observed effect could be related to an increase on QN penetration ( ). However, further studies are necessary to investigate the influence of surface characteristics of nanocapsules on malaria disease.
A factorial 2 4 was performed to optimize the polymeric nanocapsules co-encapsulating CO plus QN. Formulations F9 and F13 presented adequate physicochemical characteristics and were able to confer photoprotection to the QN. When the mice were infected with P. berguei and treated with these formulations, the animals had suppression of parasitemia (%) superior to free quinine, mean parasitemia (%) like the other groups, and mean time survival expressed in days higher than the saline group. In relation to % survival, these groups were superior to free quinine. The results suggested that this dosage formulation conferred superior effectiveness compared to the controls.
CONCLUSIONS
This paper presents the first report of nanocapsules prepared with Curcuma oil and QN as the oil-based core and using PCL or ERS as the polymer. The optimization showed that the concentration of CO and the type of polymer and aqueous surfactant were decisive factors to the obtained particle size. The charge characteristics for each polymer and each interaction between the polymer and surfactant and between the surfactant and QN were important to predict the zeta potential. The formulations F9 and F13 showed adequate physicochemical characteristics and encapsulation efficiency with improved photostability of QN. In vivo experiments showed that the nanoencapsulation improved the efficacy of QN when co-encapsulated with Curcuma oil, independent of the surface charge. Considering the results obtained and the importance of QN in the treatment of malaria, the nanocapsules developed in this work could be considered as promising systems for developing novel formulations containing QN and Curcuma oil. Further studies are needed to elucidate the influence of surface architecture of polymeric nanocapsules on Plasmodium -infected erythrocytes as well as nanotoxicology.
