Introduction
Differences in individual body sizes have not yet been well considered when analyzing the survival of patients with malignant tumors. Among many physical parameters, body mass index (BMI) has received the most attention in survival analyses of solid tumors, including lung cancer, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer [ , , , , , ]. However, to date, no published study has conducted a survival analysis after lung cancer surgery using other physical parameters such as height, weight, and body surface area (BSA).
Our clinical question is simply whether there is any difference in the prognosis between smaller patients and larger patients with the same-sized non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after surgical resection. Even if a small patient and a large patient have the same-sized lung cancer, the tumor itself would be relatively larger in the smaller patient. Similarly, the prognosis of a 150 cm/55 kg patient with a 2.5-cm NSCLC might be similar to that of a 180 cm/66 kg patient with a 3-cm NSCLC.
We hypothesized that the physique-adjusted tumor size (described below) was a better prognostic factor for estimating NSCLC prognosis than the non-adjusted tumor size. We therefore investigated the utility of physique-adjusted tumor size and non-adjusted tumor size in predicting the prognosis using the data of 842 NSCLC patients who underwent surgical resection at a single institution in Japan.
Patients and methods
Patients
The study was conducted with the approval of the Institutional Review Board of Nagoya University Hospital. We extracted the patients from the medical records of patients who underwent R0 resection for pathological stage IA−IIIA NSCLC without preoperative therapy at Nagoya University Hospital between 2005 and 2012. As a result, 842 patients with full clinical information were enrolled in this study. The pathological tumor size after formalin fixation was evaluated as the tumor size.
The physique-adjusted tumor size was defined as follows: $$x - {\text{adjusted tumor size}} = {\text{tumor size}} \times {\text{mean value of }}x / {\text{individual value of }}x \, \left( {x = {\text{height}},{\text{ weight, BSA, or BMI}}} \right)$$ $${\text{sex}} - {\text{height}} - {\text{adjusted tumor size }} = {\text{tumor size}} \times 152.4 \, \left( {\text{in females}} \right){\text{ or }}164.8 \, \left( {\text{in males}} \right) / {\text{individual value of height,}}$$ where the mean value was defined as the mean value of the current study cohort and BSA and BMI were defined as follows: $${\text{BSA }}\left( {{\text{m}}^{ 2} } \right) = {\text{weight }}\left( {\text{kg}} \right)^{ 0. 4 2 5} \times{\text{ height }}\left( {\text{cm}} \right)^{ 0. 7 2 5} \times{\text{ 0}} . 0 0 7 1 8 4$$ $${\text{BMI }}\left( {{\text{kg/m}}^{ 2} } \right) {\text{ = weight }}\left( {\text{kg}} \right) /\left[ {{\text{height }}\left( {\text{cm}} \right)\; \times 0. 0 1} \right]^{ 2} .$$
The 7th edition of the TNM classification [ ] was applied in this cohort. Thus, the tumor size categories were ≤2, 2–3, 3–5, 5–7, and >7 cm. The pathological diagnosis of the tumor was made based on the definition of the World Health Organization classification [ ].
Statistical analysis
Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from surgery to death due to any cause. Disease-free survival (DFS) was defined as the time from surgery to relapse or death due to any cause. The Kaplan–Meier method was used to estimate OS, and the log-rank test was used to compare the survival curves. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for OS.
To evaluate the prognostic significance of each of the physical parameters, age, sex, smoking status, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1.0 ), diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DL CO ), tumor size, pathological N status, and histological type were adjusted in the multivariate analysis. All of these covariates had been found to be significant prognostic factors for OS in univariate analysis ( P < 0.05). The separation index (SEP) proposed by Sauerbrei et al. [ ], which is the weighted mean of the absolute value of estimated regression coefficients over the subgroups with respect to a baseline reference group, was used to evaluate the degree of separation of the survival curves among the five groups determined on the basis of tumor size and physique-adjusted tumor size. A higher SEP indicates a better degree of separation.
Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05. All analyses were conducted using the JMP software program (version 13.0.0, SAS institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) and the SAS software program (version 9.3; SAS Institute Inc.).
Results
Clinicopathological characteristics
The clinicopathological characteristics of the 842 patients enrolled are shown in Table 1 . The mean values of height, weight, BSA, and BMI in the cohort were 160.7 cm, 57.6 kg, 1.59 m 2 , and 22.2 kg/m 2 , respectively. The mean age was 68.1 years. Five hundred and sixty-two patients were male, and 596 had a smoking history. The mean and median tumor sizes were 3.0 and 2.6 cm, respectively. Sixty hundred and ninety-nine patients underwent major lung resection. The cohort consisted of 565 adenocarcinomas, 206 squamous cell carcinomas, and 71 other histological types. Three hundred and twenty-two tumors were classified as pathological stage IA disease, 266 as stage IB disease, 101 as stage IIA disease, 62 as stage IIB disease, and 91 as stage IIIA disease.

OS curves
The median follow-up period of all patients was 48 months. Figure 1 shows the OS curves classified by each of the physique-adjusted models. The number of patients classified in the ≤2 cm category of each of physique-adjusted tumor size models was smaller than that of the non-adjusted tumor size model. The 5-year survival rates of this category in each of the physique-adjusted tumor size models were higher than that of the non-adjusted tumor size model (90–91 vs 88%). In contrast, the number of patients classified in the >7 cm category of each of the physique-adjusted tumor size models was larger than that of the non-adjusted tumor size model. The 5-year survival rates of this category in each of the physique-adjusted tumor size models were lower than the non-adjusted tumor size model (51–57 vs 59%) (Fig. 1 and Table 2 ). Given these findings, the OS curves in each of the physique-adjusted tumor size models seemed to be better separated and extended than those in the non-adjusted tumor size model.

SEPs for OS
Table 2 includes a summary of HRs, 95% CI, regression coefficient, SEPs, and the 5-year survival rates of the physique-adjusted and non-adjusted tumor size group models. The highest SEP of 2.236 was observed in the height-adjusted tumor size model, and the second highest SEP of 2.169 was observed in the BMI-adjusted tumor size model, while the lowest SEP of 1.937 was observed in the non-adjusted tumor size model. Generally, mean height is significantly different between males and females. Since mean height would strongly influence our height-adjusted model, an analysis using a sex-height-adjusted tumor size model was additionally performed. The SEP in the sex-height-adjusted tumor size model was slightly lower than that in the height-adjusted tumor size model (2.125 vs 2.236, Table 2 ).
SEPs for OS in 677 pN0 patients
After limiting the cohort to the 677 patients with pN0 NSCLC, the highest and lowest SEPs were observed in the BMI-adjusted and non-adjusted tumor size models, respectively. The SEPs in the non-adjusted, height-adjusted, weight-adjusted, BSA-adjusted, BMI-adjusted, and sex-height-adjusted tumor size models were 1.646, 1.891, 1.947, 1.818, 2.035, and 1.780, respectively (Fig. 2 and Table 3 ).

SEPs for DFS
In all 842 patients, the SEP for DFS was similarly analyzed. The highest and lowest SEPs were observed in the height-adjusted and non-adjusted tumor size models, respectively. The SEPs for DFS in the non-adjusted, height-adjusted, weight-adjusted, BSA-adjusted, BMI-adjusted, and sex-height-adjusted tumor size models were 1.872, 2.065, 2.007, 1.943, 2.001, and 2.059, respectively.

On limiting the analysis to the 677 pN0 patients, the highest and lowest SEPs for DFS were observed in the BMI-adjusted and non-adjusted tumor size models, respectively. The SEPs for DFS in the non-adjusted, height-adjusted, weight-adjusted, BSA-adjusted, BMI-adjusted, and sex-height-adjusted tumor size models were 1.562, 1.680, 1.820, 1.667, 1.846, and 1.677, respectively.
HRs and 95% CIs of the physical parameters
Table 4 shows the results of the multivariable Cox regression analysis of height for OS. After adjusting for the age, sex, smoking status, FEV 1.0 , DL CO , tumor size, pathological N status, and histological type, we found a significant inverse effect of height on survival. Table 5 shows the results of the multivariable Cox regression analysis of the BMI. The BMI also had a significant influence on OS. Similarly, a 1-SD increase in the weight (HR 0.75; 95% CI 0.63–0.90; P = 0.0016) and a 1-SD increase in the BSA (HR 0.71; 95% CI 0.59–0.86; P = 0.0005) were found to have a significant influence on OS.

Discussion
This study is an exploratory study designed to compare the survival of NSCLC patients using non-adjusted tumor size (actual tumor size) and physique-adjusted tumor size. The SEP is now recognized as the only surrogate parameter that evaluates the degree of separation of the survival curves. Each calculated SEP in the physique-adjusted tumor sizes (height-, weight-, BSA-, and BMI-adjusted) in NSCLC patients was superior to that of the non-adjusted tumor size (actual tumor size). Moreover, height, weight, BSA, and BMI were also found to be significant factors in the Cox multivariate regression analysis. These results suggest that our hypothesis might be correct, i.e., the physique-adjusted tumor size was a better prognostic factor for survival than the non-adjusted tumor size. As previous studies have indicated, sex, DL CO , tumor size, and pathological N status were strong prognostic factors for predicting OS [ , ]. Physique-adjusted tumor size might also help to contribute to the development of a future TNM staging system and/or international comparison.
The cell number and cell size of organs are known to vary according to several parameters, including age, sex, weight, pathology, and evolutionary adaptations. Taking this into consideration, in 2013, the total number of cells in the human body was estimated to be 3.72 × 10 13 for a 30-year-old male weighing 70 kg and 1.72 m tall, based on bibliographical and/or mathematical approaches [ ]. Since the physique-adjusted tumor size is based on the individual body size, it reflects the ratio of the number of lung cancer cells to the total number of cells in the body. Therefore, while this is only a hypothesis, our results suggest that the ratio of the number of lung cancer cells to the total number of cells in the body is a more useful prognostic factor than the number of lung cancer cells itself.
The association between height and lung cancer mortality has been examined epidemiologically in several studies [ , , ]. In a meta-analysis with 1085,949 participants (Asia 7%; Europe 60%; North America 33%) in 121 studies, the HRs per 1-SD increase in height were 0.97 (95% CI 0.96–0.99) for death from any cause, 1.04 (1.03–1.06) for all cancer deaths, and 1.04 (1.02–1.06) for lung cancer deaths [ ]. In another meta-analysis, with 408,381 Asian participants, the HRs for lung cancer death per 1-SD increase in height were 1.13 (0.98–1.30) for females and 1.09 (1.01–1.17) for males [ ]. To our knowledge, however, no study has clarified the prognostic impact of height after lung cancer surgery, and the adjusted HRs per 1-SD increase in height were 0.77 (0.62–0.96) in the present study. The reason for the discrepancy between our results after surgical resection and the previous epidemiological studies should be clarified. Because a larger person has a greater number of organ cells at risk of malignant transformation and/or proliferation, a larger body size has been proposed to be associated with a greater susceptibility to cancer [ ]. However, as mentioned above, the better prognosis of a larger person with lung cancer than a smaller one might be due to the larger person having a smaller ratio of the number of lung cancer cells to the total number of cells in the lung and body.
Several reports regarding the association between BMI and lung cancer have been published previously [ , , , , , ]. Regarding surgical outcomes, Attaran et al. found that the survival rate of the group with BMI ≥30 was significantly higher after lung resection than among those with BMI <30 [ ]. Dhakal et al. found no marked difference regarding survival after lung resection between patients with BMI ≥25 and those with BMI <25 [ ]. We found a significantly better effect on survival in patients with a high BMI, as the HR per 1-SD increase in BMI was 0.82 (0.70–0.96) (Table 4 ). As previous studies have suggested, we believe that this was mainly because the BMI is highly associated with the nutritional condition [ , , , , , ].
As a higher SEP indicates a better degree of separation, the height-adjusted tumor size separated the survival of NSCLC patients the best among the examined physical parameters. However, it remained unclear why the SEP for OS and DFS in the height-adjusted tumor size model was the highest among all of the models. One reason for this might be that height is well acknowledged to have a significant correlation with lung volume (e.g., total lung capacity, vital capacity) [ ] as well as the number of cells in the lung. Nevertheless, because weight and BSA along with height are highly associated with the total volume in the body as well as the total number of cells in the body, we believe that all of these parameters have the potential to be interpreted as the best parameter for adjusting the tumor size. Indeed, after limiting the cohort to the 677 patients with pN0 NSCLC, the SEP for OS and DFS in the height-adjusted tumor size model was no longer the highest. We therefore regard it as significant that each calculated SEP in the physique-adjusted tumor sizes was superior to that of the non-adjusted tumor size.
Several limitations associated with the present study warrant mention. First, this study was retrospective in nature. Second, because the original TNM classification is so well structured, the difference in the OS curves between the physique-adjusted tumor size models and the non-adjusted tumor size model was visually not very outstanding. Third, the follow-up period was relatively short. Fourth, because the mean value of the physical parameters varies among countries and regions, it is necessary to modify the concept of physique-adjusted tumor size in international studies. Finally, as mentioned above, it remained unclear which physique-adjusted model is the best for adjusting the tumor size.
Conclusions
This study only focused on the concept of adjusting tumor size using physical parameters. In conclusion, despite the fact that the current study included an exploratory challenge with several limitations, we believe it contains important information about tumor size from a unique perspective. These results suggest that the physique-adjusted tumor size can separate the survival better than the actual tumor size. Considering the differences among patients in physical parameters can be helpful in better understanding their prognosis.
