Introduction
Axillary lymph node metastasis in early stage breast cancer patients is still a major prognostic factor for disease-free (DFS) and overall (OS) survival, so it has a great influence on the decisions about treatment strategy [ ]. Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), which is used to assess axillary nodal status, has a risk of complications such as lymphedema and neuropathy. Therefore, it has been replaced by sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND), which is a less invasive staging method and has widely spread as a means of axillary management for patients with node-negative breast cancer [ ]. Patients without clinical axillary lymph node metastases should undergo SLND, and no additional lymph node surgery is performed when the sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) do not have metastases [ ].
The American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z0011 trial demonstrated that in clinically node-negative women with T1 or T2 invasive breast cancer, who underwent breast-conserving surgery (BCT) with whole breast irradiation (WBRT), had excellent local control and survival with SLND alone, even if metastases were found in 1 or 2 SLNs [ ]. At the median follow-up of 6.3 years, the results of the Z0011 trial demonstrated that patients allocated to SLND alone had no worse a prognosis than those allocated to ALND, with a non-inferiority hazard ratio. It was also found that nodal recurrence was less than 1% in patients receiving SLND alone [ ]. A serious criticism of this initial study was that the follow-up time was relatively short. Taking into consideration that hormone receptor–positive breast cancer is a slow-growing disease and has a potential risk of loco-regional and systemic recurrences after 5 years [ ], late recurrence and death may have not been detected.
Recently, the long-term follow-up data of the Z0011 study were reported, which demonstrated that the 10-year OS for patients receiving SLND alone was not inferior to that for those receiving ALND [ ]. Furthermore, loco-regional control was achieved, with excellent outcomes in patients with SLND alone, WBRT, and adjuvant systemic therapy [ ].
This breakthrough result of the Z0011 study led to a change in clinical practice regarding the standard management of axillary lymph nodes in patients with breast cancer [ ]. Several retrospective and prospective validation studies showing the utility of the Z0011 strategy have been reported [ , , ]. However, these validation data have been generated in Western populations. As the socio-economic profile, life style and culture of Asian are substantially different from those of Western, and genetic backgrounds vary to some extent [ ], it remains unclear whether results similar to those of the Z0011 study could be achieved in a Japanese breast cancer population. In the present study, we prospectively applied the Z0011 eligibility criteria to Japanese patients with clinically node-negative breast cancer undergoing BCT, with planned WBRT. This is the first report to estimate the clinicopathological relevance of the Z0011 findings for Japanese patients with breast cancer, and to verify the feasibility of using the Z0011 criteria to avoid ALND after positive SLN findings.
Patients and methods
Patient population
We conducted a prospective single-arm study, which was approved by the institutional review board. According to the Z0011 eligibility criteria [ ], we enrolled patients with clinically node-negative breast cancer who had T1 or T2 tumors and who underwent BCT with planned WBRT at the Osaka International Cancer Institute. Patients were enrolled from April 2012 to December 2016. All patients who had T1 or T2 invasive breast cancer, did not receive neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy, and who planed to undergo BCT with WBRT were informed of the results of the Z0011 study, and those who pre-operatively provided written informed consent for no further ALND in case of positive SLNs were enrolled. Patients undergoing additional mastectomy due to positive surgical margins, those receiving ALND due to 3 or more positive SLNs, and those with negative SLNs or isolated tumor cells in SLNs detected by post-operative detailed immunohistochemistry were excluded from further analyses.
Surgery, examination of SLNs, and assessment
We assessed the axillary nodal status of all patients pre-operatively using ultrasound. Fine-needle aspiration cytology was conducted for suspicious lymph nodes. BCT was performed in all eligible patients according to current surgical protocols. SLNs were detected using indocyanine green and technetium (99Tc) tin colloids [ ]. SLNs were freshly sliced into 2-mm thick sections, and intra-operative imprint cytology from the cut surfaces was performed [ ]. The final pathological status of SLN metastasis was diagnosed in conformity with the 7th edition of the International Union Against Cancer Tumor Lymph Node Metastasis (TNM) Classification of Malignant Tumors [ ]. Patients were followed up according to standard clinical practice. Medical interviews and physical examinations were performed every 3 months for the first 24 months then every 6 months thereafter. Annual assessments by mammography and ultrasound were also carried out.
Clinicopathological characteristics
We prospectively collected clinicopathological data including age, clinical T stage, pathological T stage, tumor histology, nuclear grade, lymphovascular invasion, hormone status, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), total number of SLNs removed, number of positive SLNs, size of SLN metastasis, SLN extranodal extension, breast reconstruction, adjuvant chemotherapy, adjuvant endocrine therapy, WBRT, high axillary tangent (WBRT including axillary level I), loco-regional recurrence, distant recurrence, and follow-up time.
Statistical analysis
Categorical variables of patient characteristics were compared between eligible patients in the current study and those in the Z0011 SLND-alone cohort [ , , ] by Fisher’s exact test. The cumulative incidence of loco-regional recurrence and distant DFS were analyzed using the Kaplan–Meier method. All statistical tests were 2-sided, and a p value of 0.05 or less was considered statistically significant. JMP pro statistical software (Version 12.2.0, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) was used for statistical analyses on a dataset locked on October 31, 2017.
Results
The patient flow chart of our study is shown in Fig. 1 . A total of 881 patients were enrolled at the Osaka International Cancer Institute from April 2012 to December 2016. After exclusion of 692 non-eligible patients who had negative lymph nodes or isolated tumor cells or who underwent ALND due to 3 or more positive SLNs or mastectomy due to positive margins, 189 eligible patients remained in the subsequent analysis.

Baseline characteristics of the 189 eligible patients are shown in Table 1 . The median age of patients was 52 (range 30–85) years, and 144 (76.2%) had clinical T1. One hundred and seventy-eight patients (94.2%) had invasive ductal carcinoma and 6 (3.1%) had invasive lobular carcinoma. One hundred and seventy-three tumors (91.6%) were hormone receptor-positive, and 10 (5.3%) were TNBC. The median number of removed SLNs and histopathologically positive SLNs was 2 (range 1–7) and 1 (range 1–4), respectively. Of the 189 patients, 131 (69.3%) had macrometastases and 58 (30.7%) had micrometastases in the SLNs. Adjuvant chemotherapy was given to 113 patients (59.8%) and adjuvant hormone therapy to 170 (89.9%). Of these patients, 183 (96.8%) received WBRT and 163 (86.2%) patients received high tangent irradiation.

Table 2 shows the clinicopathological relevance between the eligible patients in the current study ( n = 189) and those in the Z0011 SLND-alone cohort ( n = 436) [ ]. The factors showing statistically significant differences between groups were tumor histology ( p = 0.004), lymphovascular invasion ( p < 0.0001), hormone status ( p = 0.01), size of the SLN metastasis ( p = 0.001), and adjuvant endocrine therapy ( p < 0.0001). In particular, patients having tumors with lymphovascular invasion and sentinel node macrometastases and receiving adjuvant endocrine therapy were more frequent in our study than in the Z0011 study population.

The median length of follow-up was 36 months (range 10–64 months) in our study. Loco-regional recurrence occurred in 2 of 189 patients (1.1%) and distant recurrence in 8 of 189 (4.2%). One of two patients with loco-regional recurrence showed axillary nodal involvement 20 months after the initial operation, and the other had ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence 22 months after the operation. The former patient had TNBC and received high tangent irradiation and adjuvant systemic chemotherapy, while the latter had hormone receptor-positive breast cancer and did not receive WBRT. The cumulative incidence of loco-regional recurrence in the eligible patients in the current study and those in the Z0011 SLND-alone cohort is shown in Table 3 . The 5-year cumulative rates of loco-regional recurrences were 1.3 and 3.3% [ ], respectively. The 3-year loco-regional recurrence-free survival and distant DFS rate was 98.7% (95% CI 96.9–100%) and 96.8% (95% CI 94.0–99.6%), respectively (Fig. 2 ). The median time to distant recurrence was 27.5 months ( n = 8, range 5–50 months) in the current study.

Discussion
The ACOSOG Z0011 trial is an epoch-making randomized trial showing that patients with early breast cancer who have positive SLNs and who received SLND alone had equivalent loco-regional recurrence risk and survival rates as those treated with ALND [ , ]. This trial defined eligible patients for safely omitting ALND as those fulfilling the criteria of clinical T1 or T2, N0, M0 breast cancer, with 1 or 2 positive SLNs, BCT, planned WBRT, and adjuvant systemic therapy. According to the Z0011 eligibility criteria, several validation studies [ , , ] have been conducted and have shown no significant differences in loco-regional recurrence rates in patients who had SLND alone compared with the ALND cohort. Consequently, this clinical strategy of omitting ALND in patients with early stage breast cancer is recommended by the American Society of Clinical Oncology [ ] and National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines [ ].
In the present study, we prospectively investigated the feasibility of applying the Z0011 criteria to Japanese patients with breast cancer. Our findings demonstrate a low risk of loco-regional recurrence and a good prognosis in patients with positive SLNs who were treated with SLND alone as was reported in the Z0011 study. Of note, the percentages of tumors with lymphovascular invasion and macrometastases in our study were relatively higher than those of patients in the Z0011 trial, which are likely to be risk factors for loco-regional recurrence [ , ]. Nevertheless, we had an excellent result, with an extremely low loco-regional recurrence rate (1.1%).
The reasons for the low loco-regional recurrence rate might be application of high tangent irradiation to all eligible patients, and administration of adjuvant systemic therapy to most patients. Several clinical trials and systematic reviews revealed that WBRT and adjuvant systemic therapy are effective for loco-regional control. For example, the IBCSG 23-01 trial [ ] comparing outcomes in patients with sentinel micrometastases treated with ALND vs no ALND showed no significant differences between groups for the 5-year DFS rate (87.8 vs 84.4%). In this trial, most patients (95–97%) received WBRT and/or adjuvant systemic chemotherapy. The AMAROS trial [ ] showed the importance of radiation therapy (RT) to the supraclavicular region (nodal RT). This trial demonstrated that patients with 1 or 2 SLN metastases who were randomized to nodal RT vs ALND had no differences in loco-regional recurrence (1.19 vs 0.43%) or 5-year OS (93.3 vs 92.5%). Jagsi et al. [ ] revealed that in the Z0011 study, 19% of patients with complete clinical records received nodal RT, and that high tangent irradiation was performed in 52.6% of patients assigned to SLND, with sufficient records to evaluate tangent height. Additionally, patients receiving nodal RT in the Z0011 study had greater nodal involvement than those who did not. Although it is not necessary to use nodal RT for all patients with positive SLNs, nodal RT and high tangent irradiation could be an important option for some high-risk patients who are more likely to have metastases than those with negative SLNs.
On the other hand, regarding adjuvant systemic therapy, the Early Breast Cancer Trialists’ Collaborative Group (EBCTCG) overview [ ] showed that adjuvant hormone therapy decreases loco-regional recurrence by about 50% compared to placebo. Cytotoxic chemotherapy and targeted anti-HER2 therapy also play an important role in improving loco-regional control in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer [ , ].
We are aware that there are some limitations in the present study. The first limitation is that the median follow-up time of 36 months is still short. In the ACOSOG Z0011 trial, the median time to loco-regional node recurrence was 3.1 years and only a single nodal recurrence was observed after 76 months [ ]. Furthermore, taking into consideration that the percentages of hormone receptor–positive breast cancer in our study (91.6%) were relatively higher than those of patients in the Z0011 (75.2%), there might be a few cases that have loco-regional recurrence in future, and long-term follow-up is necessary to confirm the reliability of our data.
The second limitation is that our study included a small number of patients with TNBC. The only patient with axillary nodal recurrence in the current study had TNBC. Chung et al. [ ] demonstrated the applicability of the Z0011 eligibility criteria to a large proportion of patients with high-risk factors such as TNBC, HER2-positive breast cancer, and young age at diagnosis. However, careful follow-up is considered to be required for high-risk patients with TNBC.
To our knowledge, this is the first prospective study applying the ACOSOG Z0011 criteria to Japanese patients with early stage breast cancer. The results demonstrated an extremely low rate of loco-regional recurrence. We believe that the excellent loco-regional control in our study will have a great impact on clinical practice in Japan for treating patients with breast cancer.
