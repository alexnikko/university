Introduction
Animal models with spontaneous development of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus share many features typical for human type 1 diabetes (T1D) and have been extremely helpful in identifying etiological and pathophysiological aspects of autoimmune diabetes. The LEW.1AR1- iddm rat is one such rat model of human type 1 diabetes (T1D), which arose through a spontaneous mutation in the background LEW.1AR1 strain [ ]. This model shows an immune cell infiltration of the pancreatic islets releasing proinflammatory cytokines leading to apoptotic ß-cell death [ , ]. Other endocrine cell types in the islets are not affected. Using adoptive transfer experiments, autoimmune characteristics of the diabetes development in this rat model have been identified [ , ], which follows an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance with a diabetes incidence of about 60% within the colony [ ].
Few specific MHC haplotypes are generally accepted as diabetes predisposing loci in humans and animals. In all rat models with spontaneous autoimmune diabetes development [Biobreeding diabetes prone (BB-DP), Komeda diabetes prone (KDP), LEW.1AR1- iddm (IDDM) and LEW.1WR1], the MHC class II RT1-B/D u haplotype permits penetration of the disease [ , ]. In addition, each rat model with a diabetes incidence more than 2% has its own specific mutation mediating the autoimmune diabetes [ , , , , ]. The diabetes incidence in the BB-DP rat was colony specific ranging from 30 to 80% whereas for the KDP rat, it has been described with an incidence of 80%.
The mutation in the LEW.1AR1- iddm rat has an influence on the immune system, which is described as a ‘variable CD3 + T cell frequency in peripheral blood’ [ ]. This variable CD3 + T cell frequency affects all rats of the LEW.1AR1- iddm colony independent from the development of autoimmune diabetes and is characteristic for this strain. Moreover, each LEW.1AR1- iddm rat shows unique changes of the T cell frequency during the course of its life. The frequencies in the coisogenic background strain LEW.1AR1 ( RT1-A a , RT1-B/D u , RT1-C u ) and the MHC congenic strains LEW.1WR1 ( RT1-A u , RT1-B/D u , RT1-C a ) and LEW ( RT1-A l , RT1-B/D l , RT1 l -C l ) are stable but strain specific [ ]. The immune status of primary and secondary lymphatic organs of the LEW.1AR1- iddm rat has not been investigated to date.
The frequency of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood does not necessarily reflect the situation in other organs, especially in primary and secondary lymphatic organs. The composition and frequency of immune cells are organ specific and balanced under healthy conditions [ ]. Many factors influence the amount of lymphocytes in peripheral blood and other compartments such as their migratory behaviour, age, as well as metabolic and stress factors.
The aims of this study were (a) to evaluate whether the frequency of immune cells in primary and secondary lymphatic organs of LEW.1AR1- iddm rats at day 40 and day 60 of life is specific either for each individual rat independent of diabetes manifestation and (b) to compare the findings with the background strain LEW.1AR1 as well as the LEW.1WR1 and the LEW strains.
Materials and methods
Animals
All rats were kept in the Central Animal Facility of Hannover Medical School in type 4S cages (1370 cm 2 ) under controlled standardised conditions: temperature 21 ± 2 °C, relative humidity 50 ± 5% and artificial light (14-h light, 10-h dark). Sterilised commercial softwood granulate bedding was used (Lignocel, Altromin; Lage, Germany). Autoclaved commercial pellet diet (Altromin 1314) and autoclaved water were provided ad libitum.
The microbiological status was examined as recommended by FELASA [ ]. The genetic authenticity of rats was regularly tested [ , ]. All experiments were conducted in accordance with the principles of laboratory care approved by the Local Institutional Animal Care and Research Advisory Committee of Hannover Medical School and the Lower Saxony State Office (AZ: 2014/56).
Ten animals of each group from the rat strains were analysed at two different time points of life (at day 40 before any signs of islet infiltration and day 60, the average time point of diabetes manifestation with peripheral blood immune cell changes in the LEW.1AR1- iddm rat): LEW.1AR1- iddm , LEW.1AR1, LEW.1WR1 and LEW. Blood glucose concentrations were measured (Glucometer Elite TM , Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany). All rats were normoglycaemic (LEW.1AR1- iddm 5.2 ± 0.2 mmol/L at day 40, 5.4 ± 0.2 mmol/L at day 60; LEW.1AR1 4.8 ± 0.1 mmol/L at day 40, 4.5 ± 0.2 mmol/L at day 60; LEW.1WR1 5.2 ± 0.1 mmol/L at day 40, 5.0 ± 0.1 mmol/L at day 60; LEW 4.7 ± 0.1 mmol/L at day 40, 4.6 ± 0.2 mmol/L at day 60; n = 10 animals in each strain and time point) and showed no signs of islets infiltration in the pancreas.
Sample preparation
Blood, lymph nodes, spleen and thymus were collected. The organs were immediately disrupted in RPMI medium by the use of two forceps. Both peripheral and mesenteric lymph node cells were collected and pooled. The cell suspensions were prepared by 2–3× lysis in 2 ml lysis buffer (160 mmol/L NH 4 , 0.1 mmol/L EDTA, 12 mmol/L NaHCO 3 ) and centrifuged (200× g ) for 4 min each. Then, the cell pellet was washed twice with FACS buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.03% sodium azide, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) and centrifuged again. Thereafter, cells were prepared for flow cytometry [ ].
Flow cytometry
In order to determine the different immune cell subpopulations in the thymus, lymph nodes, spleen and peripheral blood by flow cytometric analyses were performed as described before [ , ]. The following labelled rat-specific monoclonal antibodies were used: CD4 (OX-38) FITC, CD3 (G4.18) PE (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany); CD8 (OX-8) FITC, CD8 (OX-8) PE, CD45RA (OX-33) FITC and CD161 (10/78) FITC (all from Bio-Rad, Munich, Germany).
Calculations of the analysed parameters
For each time point (day 40 and day 60), a mean value (given in [%]) was calculated from all animals of each strain and for each immune cell subpopulation.
Statistical analyses
Means ± standard error of the mean (SEM), after showing the normal distribution of the values ANOVA plus Tukey’s post-test, and coefficient of variation (CV) were calculated using the GraphPad Prism 5 software (La Jolla, CA, USA).
Results
In this study, we analysed the immune cell frequency in the primary and two different secondary lymphatic organs of the LEW.1AR1- iddm rats and other MHC congenic LEW inbred strains at two different time points of life (day 40 and day 60). Peripheral blood was measured from all animals, but the results are only shown in the supporting information material to confirm our data from the previous study [ ] and to compare these data to the primary and secondary lymphatic organs (all means ± SEM and CVs are listed in the supporting information, Table S1 ).
T cell frequencies in the thymus of different rat strains at days 40 and 60 of life
In the thymus, the minority of T cells were single positive for CD4 and CD8 (approx. 10%, Fig. 1 a–c) compared to the majority of double-positive T cells (approx. 90%, Fig. 1 d). There were no remarkable differences in mean values between the different strains at days 40 and 60 of life. The variance (coefficient of variation (CV)) was relatively high for each analysed single-positive and double-positive T cell population in the thymus of all examined strains at both time points without any differences (Fig. 1 a–d; all means ± SEM and CVs were listed in the supporting information, Table S2 ). Fig. 1 T cell frequencies in the thymus in different rat strains at days 40 and 60 of life. A mean was calculated for the a CD3 + T cell frequency, b CD4 + T cell frequency, c CD8 + T cell frequency and d CD4/CD8 double-positive T cell frequency. Means were expressed in %. IDDM, LEW.1AR1- iddm ; 1AR1, LEW.1AR1; 1WR1, LEW.1WR1 ( n = 10) for each rat strain
T cell frequencies in the lymph nodes of different rat strains at days 40 and 60 of life
The mean of the CD3 + T cell frequency at day 40 (64.4 ± 2.7%) and at day 60 (49.3 ± 1.6%) within the LEW.1AR1- iddm cohort compared to all other strains was significantly reduced ( P < 0.01 compared to LEW.1AR1 78.5 ± 1.4%, LEW.1WR1 72.5 ± 1.0%, LEW 76.4 ± 0.8% at day 40; P < 0.001 compared to LEW.1AR1 72.1 ± 1.5% day 60, LEW.1WR1 65.3 ± 2.3%, LEW 68.0 ± 0.7% at day 60) (Fig. 2 a). Remarkably, within the LEW.1AR1- iddm cohort, the CD3 + T cell frequency at day 60 of life was significantly reduced by approximately 15% compared to that at day 40 of life ( P < 0.01). Fig. 2 T cell frequencies in lymph nodes in different rat strains at days 40 and 60 of life. A mean was calculated for the a CD3 + T cell frequency, b CD4 + T cell frequency, c CD8 + T cell frequency and d the CD4 + :CD8 + T cell ratio. Means were expressed in % with the exception of the mean of the CD4 + :CD8 + T cell ratio. IDDM, LEW.1AR1- iddm ; 1AR1, LEW.1AR1; 1WR1, LEW.1WR1 ( n = 10) for each rat strain. Significances according to the ANOVA plus Tukey’s post-test with *** P < 0.001/** P < 0.01 IDDM vs 1AR1, 1WR1 and LEW; ### P < 0.001/ # P < 0.05 day 40 vs day 60; ++ P < 0.01 IDDM vs 1AR1
This applied also to a minor extent for the LEW cohort ( P < 0.05) while the LEW.1AR1 and LEW.1WR1 cohorts showed no significant differences. The variance of the CD3 + T cell frequency in the lymph nodes of the LEW.1AR1- iddm cohort was higher than that of the LEW.1AR1 and LEW (Fig. 2 a). Only, a notable variance was also observed in LEW.1WR1 rats at day 60 of life.
The CD4 + T cell frequency in the lymph nodes at both analysed time points was significantly reduced within the LEW.1AR1- iddm cohort compared to all other strains (LEW.1AR1- iddm 39.4 ± 2.6% at day 40, P < 0.01 compared to LEW.1AR1 52.0 ± 1.4%, LEW.1WR1 50.9 ± 0.9% and LEW 55.2 ± 0.8%; LEW.1AR1- iddm 31.8 ± 3.9% at day 60, P < 0.001 compared to LEW.1AR1 47.5 ± 1.2%, LEW.1WR1 44.9 ± 1.9% and LEW 48.9 ± 1.7%) (Fig. 2 b). The variance of the CD4 + T cell frequency was higher in the LEW.1AR1- iddm cohort compared to all other analysed strains in particular at day 60 of life (Fig. 2 b).
Significant differences in the CD8 + T cell frequency in lymph nodes could only be detected between the LEW.1AR1- iddm cohort and LEW.1AR1 at day 60 of life (LEW.1AR1- iddm 25.1 ± 0.6%, P < 0.01 compared to LEW.1AR1 49.3 ± 1.6%). At day 40 of life, no differences were observed between all analysed four strains. The variance of the CD8 + T cell frequency was obviously higher in the LEW.1AR1- iddm cohort compared to the other analysed LEW strains (Fig. 2 c).
Although LEW.1AR1- iddm rats differed clearly in their T cell frequencies in lymph nodes compared to all other analysed strains, no remarkable differences could be detected in the mean values of the CD4 + :CD8 + T cell ratio neither at day 40 nor at day 60 of life (Fig. 2 d). The variation of the ratio was clearly higher in the LEW.1AR1- iddm cohort than in the other strains (Fig. 2 d).
T cell frequencies in the spleen of different rat strains at days 40 and 60 of life
The CD3 + T cell frequency in the spleen within the LEW.1AR1- iddm cohort increased significantly from day 40 to day 60 of life (LEW.1AR1- iddm 32.5 ± 1.4% (day 40), P < 0.05 compared to LEW.1AR1- iddm 39.9 ± 2.1% (day 60)). This time-dependent increase also applied to LEW.1AR1 rats (LEW.1AR1 50.4 ± 2.0% (day 40), P < 0.001 compared to LEW.1AR1 62.5 ± 2.0% (day 60)), but not found in the LEW.1WR1 and LEW strains. The mean of the CD3 + T cell frequency within the LEW.1AR1- iddm cohort at day 40 was significantly lower than in all other strains ( P < 0.001 compared to LEW.1AR1 50.4 ± 2.0%, LEW.1WR1 42.7 ± 0.8%, LEW 49.6 ± 1.4%). The CD3 + T cell frequency within the LEW.1AR1- iddm cohort at day 60, however, was significantly reduced, but only compared to LEW.1AR1 and LEW rats ( P < 0.001 compared to LEW.1AR1 62.5 ± 2.0% (day 60), LEW 52.4 ± 1.2%). In addition, the CD3 + T cell frequency within the LEW.1AR1 cohort at day 60 was significantly increased compared to LEW.1WR1 and LEW rats ( P < 0.001) (Fig. 3 a). The variance of the CD3 + T cell frequency in the spleen of the LEW.1AR1- iddm cohort at day 40 was higher than that of the other strains and increased considerably at day 60 of life. It was also relatively high in the LEW.1WR1 cohort at day 60 of life (Fig. 3 a). Fig. 3 T cell frequencies in spleen in different rat strains at days 40 and 60 of life. A mean was calculated for the a CD3 + T cell frequency, b CD4 + T cell frequency, c CD8 + T cell frequency and d the CD4 + :CD8 + T cell ratio. Means were expressed in % with the exception of the mean of the CD4 + :CD8 + T cell ratio. IDDM, LEW.1AR1- iddm ; 1AR1, LEW.1AR1; 1WR1, LEW.1WR1 ( n = 10) for each rat strain. Significances according to the ANOVA plus Tukey’s post-test with *** P < 0.001 IDDM vs 1AR1, 1WR1 and LEW; ### P < 0.001/ # P < 0.05 d40 vs d60; $$$ P < 0.001 IDDM vs 1AR1 and LEW; ^^^ P < 0.001 1AR1 vs 1WR1; §§§ P < 0.001 1AR1 vs 1WR1 and LEW
The CD4 + T cell frequency in the spleen within the LEW.1AR1- iddm cohort at day 40 was significantly lower compared to day 60 of life (LEW.1AR1- iddm 20.8 ± 1.8% (day 40), P < 0.05 compared to LEW.1AR1- iddm 28.7 ± 2.1% (day 60)). This time-dependent decrease also applied to LEW.1AR1 (LEW.1AR1 30.3 ± 1.2% (day 40), P < 0.05 compared to LEW.1AR1 39.7 ± 1.9% (day 60)). The CD4 + T cell frequency in the spleen at day 40 of life was significantly reduced within the LEW.1AR1- iddm cohort compared to the LEW.1AR1 and LEW cohorts ( P < 0.001 compared to LEW.1AR1 30.3 ± 1.2% and LEW 33.5 ± 1.2%). A significantly higher value at day 60 was found only in the LEW.1AR1 cohort compared to the LEW.1WR1 cohort (LEW.1AR1 39.7 ± 1.9%, P < 0.001 compared to LEW.1WR1 27.3 ± 1.6%) (Fig. 3 b). The variance of the CD4 + T cell frequency was obviously higher in the LEW.1AR1- iddm cohort compared to the other analysed strains in particular at day 40 of life (Fig. 3 b).
The CD8 + T cell frequency in the spleen within the LEW.1AR1- iddm cohort at day 40 was significantly lower compared to the other strains (LEW.1AR1- iddm 7.9 ± 0.8%, P < 0.001 compared to LEW.1AR1 19.8 ± 0.9%, LEW.1WR1 16.9 ± 0.5% and LEW 15.3 ± 0.4%). This reduced frequency remained within the LEW.1AR1- iddm cohort at day 60 (LEW.1AR1- iddm 10.2 ± 1.9%, P < 0.001 compared to LEW.1AR1 22.1 ± 0.3%, LEW.1WR1 16.2 ± 0.4% and LEW 17.5 ± 0.3%). In addition, the CD8 + T cell frequency in the spleen at day 60 of life was significantly increased within the LEW.1AR1 cohort compared to the LEW.1WR1 and LEW cohorts ( P < 0.001) (Fig. 3 c). The variance of the CD8 + T cell frequency was obviously higher in the LEW.1AR1- iddm cohort compared to the other analysed strains especially at day 60 of life (Fig. 3 c).
The mean value of the CD4 + :CD8 + T cell ratio at day 60 of life was significantly increased only in the LEW.1AR1- iddm cohort compared to the other strains (LEW.1AR1- iddm 2.9 ± 0.6, P < 0.001 compared to LEW.1AR1 1.8 ± 0.1, LEW.1WR1 1.7 ± 0.1 and LEW 2.0 ± 0.1) (Fig. 3 d). The variation of the CD4 + :CD8 + T cell ratio in the spleen was obviously higher in the LEW.1AR1- iddm strain compared to the other strains (Fig. 3 d).
B cell frequency in primary and secondary lymphatic organs of different rat strains at days 40 and 60 of life
In keeping with our expectations in all analysed strains, nearly no B cells (< 1%) were present in the thymus (means ± SEM and CVs were listed in the supporting information, Table S3 ).
The B cell frequency in the lymph nodes within the LEW.1AR1- iddm cohort at day 40 of life was significantly increased compared to the other analysed strains (LEW.1AR1- iddm 36.3 ± 4.4%, P < 0.001 compared to LEW.1AR1 19.6 ± 1.6%, LEW.1WR1 24.5 ± 0.7% and LEW 20.5 ± 0.9%). The same applied to the LEW.1AR1- iddm cohort at day 60 of life (LEW.1AR1- iddm 44.4 ± 1.7%, P < 0.001 compared to LEW.1AR1 25.1 ± 1.4%, LEW.1WR1 30.3 ± 1.8% and LEW 27.6 ± 1.2%) (Fig. 4 a). The variance was relatively high for each analysed cohort in the lymph nodes at both time points and no remarkable differences were detectable (Fig. 4 a). Fig. 4 The B and NK cell frequencies in secondary lymphatic organs in different rat strains at days 40 and 60 of life. The mean of the B cell frequency was calculated for a lymph nodes and b spleen. The mean of the NK cell frequency was calculated for c lymph nodes and d spleen. Means were expressed in %. IDDM, LEW.1AR1- iddm ; 1AR1, LEW.1AR1; 1WR1, LEW.1WR1 ( n = 10) for each rat strain. Significances according to the ANOVA plus Tukey’s post-test with *** P < 0.001 IDDM vs 1AR1, 1WR1 and LEW
There were no remarkable differences in the B cell frequencies in the spleen between the different strains at days 40 and 60 of life. The variance was higher in the LEW.1AR1- iddm cohort at day 60 (Fig. 4 b).
In summary, the frequency changes of CD3 + T cells were more pronounced in the range of 10% than for B cells in the lymph nodes as well as in the spleen.
NK cell frequency in primary and secondary lymphatic organs of different rat strains at days 40 and 60 of life
In all analysed strains, nearly no NK cells (< 1%) were present in the thymus (means ± SEM and CVs were listed in the supporting information, Table S3 ).
There were no remarkable differences in the NK cell frequencies in the lymph nodes between the different strains at day 40 and day 60 of life (Fig. 4 c). The variance was relatively high for each analysed cohort in the lymph nodes at both time points (Fig. 4 c).
The NK cell frequency in the spleen within the LEW.1AR1- iddm cohort at day 40 of life compared to the other analysed strains was significantly decreased (LEW.1AR1- iddm 3.7 ± 0.1%, P < 0.001 compared to LEW.1AR1 6.7 ± 0.3%, LEW.1WR1 7.4 ± 0.3% and LEW 7.8 ± 0.3%). At day 60 of life, the reduction in number was the same for the LEW.1AR1- iddm cohort (LEW.1AR1- iddm 3.5 ± 0.3%, P < 0.001 compared to LEW.1AR1 5.7 ± 0.4%, LEW.1WR1 7.7 ± 0.6% and LEW 7.1 ± 0.5%) (Fig. 4 d). The variance was relatively high for each analysed cohort in the spleen at both time points and no remarkable differences were detectable (Fig. 4 d).
Discussion
This study presents an analysis of the immune cell frequencies in primary and secondary lymphatic organs of the LEW.1AR1- iddm rat at two distinct time points during life. At day 40, no signs of pancreas infiltration were detectable in LEW.1AR1- iddm rats while day 60 represented the average time point of diabetes manifestation [ ]. But in this study, only normoglycaemic rats from different LEW strains were used including two spontaneous rat models of T1D, the LEW.1AR1- iddm rat and the LEW.1WR1 rat. All pancreata showed no signs of islet infiltration or changes in the endocrine cell composition and distribution in the islets (data not shown). Our findings clearly confirmed that alterations of the immune cell frequency in the LEW.1AR1- iddm rat are not restricted to the peripheral blood as shown in previous studies [ , ]. Secondary lymphatic organs such as lymph nodes and spleen were also affected by a deregulated immune system especially at day 60. More strongly affected was the frequency of CD3 + T cells, in particular CD4 + T cells, and of the B cells in the analysed lymph nodes compared to the changes in the spleen.
The rat inbred strain LEW.1AR1- iddm is an animal model of T1D with a diabetes incidence of 60% [ ]. In addition, all LEW.1AR1- iddm rats were characterised by a high variability of the immune cell frequency in peripheral blood during the course of their life independent from diabetes development [ , ]. The average frequency of CD3 + T cells was significantly reduced, while the frequency of B cells and NK cells was increased in the peripheral blood compared to the diabetes-resistant control strain LEW.1AR1 [ , ]. Thereby, the ratio of CD4 + :CD8 + T cells was specific for each rat strain as shown previously and also confirmed in the BB rat [ , ]. The findings in the present study disclosed a comparable situation in secondary lymphatic organs to that found in the peripheral blood of LEW.1AR1- iddm rats. The lymph nodes were more strongly affected than the spleen. A strong reduction of CD3 + T cells had already been found in mesenteric lymph nodes in the LEW.1AR1- iddm rat as compared to normoglycaemic rats after diabetes manifestation [ ]. The thymus was apparently unaffected with regard to the number of single- and double-positive T cells (supporting information, Table S2 ). It became also apparent that a decreased number of immune cells in the blood did not correlate with an increase of immune cells in the secondary lymphatic organs. In the human situation, the immune cell frequency of the peripheral blood is dependent on several factors, but this does not reflect the situation in lymphatic and other organs. Rather, the secondary lymphatic organs retain their specific and stable immune cell content [ ]. Our study showed that the immune cell composition remained relatively constant also in secondary lymphatic organs of other MHC congenic LEW strains. However, only in LEW.1AR1- iddm rats but not in the other MHC congenic strains the frequency of immune cells was changed. Particularly evident was the high variability in the reduced T cell frequency and the increased B cell frequency in the lymph nodes. Obviously, the changes in immune cell frequencies in the secondary lymphatic organs of the LEW.1AR1- iddm rat were not a consequence of changes in the blood. It is more likely that the alterations in the secondary lymphatic organs are caused by the mutation. These alterations were also independent from diabetes development.
Recently, we discovered a mutation in the LEW.1AR1- iddm rat within the guanine exchange factor (GEF) Dock8 [ ]. This mutation went along with the autoimmune diabetes development in the LEW.1AR1- iddm rat and led to significant changes in the immune cell frequency in the peripheral blood. The present study revealed that the mutation in Dock8 also affected the immune cell frequency in the secondary lymphatic organs.
In the human situation, mutations in DOCK8 were often associated with a similarly decreased frequency of CD3 + T cells in the peripheral blood, in particular CD4 + T cells, while effects on the immune cell distribution in secondary lymphatic organs have not been described so far [ , ].
Dock8 interacts with the GTPase Cdc42 [ , , ]. A proper activation of Cdc42 by Dock8 is important for the number and function of T cells, B cells, NK cells, NKT cells and dendritic cells [ , , , , , ]. In different genetically modified mouse models, the functional deficiencies of the interaction between Dock8 and Cdc42 resulted in a deregulated immune system as evidenced by (a) an impaired migration of these cells, and (b) in a disturbed interaction of immune cells with their environment, for example with reticulum or endothelial cells in the secondary lymphatic organs [ , , , , , , , ]. For dendritic cells, it was shown that the migration time in the periphery was normal whereas the retention time inside the different lymphatic organs was increased [ ]. Changes in the migration behaviour of the other immune cell populations and changes of their retention time in the secondary lymphatic organs might be responsible for the high variability in T cells and B cells observed in the present study in the LEW.1AR1- iddm rat.
Deficiencies or malfunctions of GTPases can lead to pathological changes of the immune system [ ]. The BB-DP rat—another animal model of T1D—has a mutation in the GTPase Gimap5, a member of the GTPase immunity-associated protein (Gimap) family [ ]. This mutation leads to functional changes in the enzyme itself and goes along with a strong reduction of T cells, resulting in lymphocytopenia as well as in accompanying changes in secondary lymphatic organs [ , , ]. Gimap5-deficient mice also showed a lymphocytopenia and a significantly reduced T cell number in spleen and lymph nodes [ , ]. Although the BB-DP rat and the LEW.1AR1- iddm rat are strains with mutations in different genes, both mutations have an effect on the GTPase pathway resulting in changes in the immune system, in our case on the immune cell frequency. In rat models, the loss of GTPases or the alteration of GTPase modulators such as GEFs can lead to autoimmune diabetes when a permitting MHC haplotype on a certain genetic background is given. In this context, the LEW.1WR1 rat has been described as an animal model of T1D with a low incidence of the disease (< 2%) [ ]. A mutation with an influence on GTPases is not known in this model. The immune status in the peripheral blood as well as in the secondary lymphatic organs appears not to be affected, as shown in the present study. In conclusion, the Dock8 mutation was responsible for changes in immune cell frequencies causing immune imbalances and together with the RT1B/D haplotype leading to the development of autoimmune diabetes.
Therefore, the LEW.1AR1- iddm rat provides a valuable animal model to elucidate the relationships between an incompletely operational immune system and the development of autoimmune diabetes.
