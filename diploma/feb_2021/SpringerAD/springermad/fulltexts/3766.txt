Introduction
Schizophrenia (SZ) is one of the most disabling psychiatric disorders with a prevalence of 1% affecting over 50 million people globally [ ]. The pathophysiology of this psychiatric disorder is unknown [ , ]; however, it is characterised by recurrent relapses, cognitive dysfunction and emotional and functional decline [ ]. It involves positive (hallucinations, delusions) and negative (emotional blunting, apathy) symptoms and cognitive impairment, with the two latter symptoms prone to resistance to antipsychotic medication [ ]. Schizophrenic patients generally have a lower quality of life due to factors such as psychotic symptoms, depression and anxiety [ ]. A defective antioxidant (AOX) system could be important in SZ, and increased oxidative stress enhances membrane defects, abnormal lipid parameters, immune system disturbances and pathologies affecting several neurochemical pathways; dopaminergic, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), serotoninergic, acetyl cholinergic (Ach), noradrenalinergic (NA) and glutamatergic systems [ ]. Glutathione (GSH), a non-enzymatic AOX, could be important in the pathogenesis of SZ, and evidence indicates lower levels in blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the prefrontal cortex in schizophrenic patients [ , ]. Previous studies reported significant reductions in GSH [ , ] and reduced levels in drug-naive first-episodic schizophrenic patients [ ]. However, the mechanisms related to the negative symptom score of cognitive disturbance remain unknown [ ]. Despite the availability of several antipsychotics, negative symptoms and cognitive disturbance are problematic to treat. Some evidence indicates the ineffectiveness of antipsychotic treatment, and there are several health problems associated with their use [ ].
Administration of new pharmacological agents in the treatment of SZ has been suggested [ , ], including AOX supplementation [ , ]. NAC, an acetylated isolate of amino acid L-cysteine, is a GSH precursor with AOX, neurotropic and anti-inflammatory effects, and it modulates the dopaminergic and glutamatergic pathways [ , , ]. Furthermore, NAC regulates the synthesis of cysteine, releasing glutamate and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor in patients with SZ [ , ]. Evidence from experimental studies has also shown the ability of NAC to reverse oxidative stress related to mitochondrial disturbance [ ], possibly due to its immunomodulatory ability [ , ]. NAC could therefore be important as an adjunct to existing treatment via its AOX and free radical scavenging capacity [ ]. Recent evidence suggests that NAC could improve aspects of cognitive performance in psychosis, especially working memory [ ]. However, there is insufficient evidence regarding efficacy, dosage, pharmacological strategies (monotherapy versus augmentation) and long-term risks of NAC [ , ]. Therefore, the aim of the present meta-analysis was to determine the effect of NAC supplementation on PANSS in SZ populations.
Materials and methods
The present meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis) [ ].
Search strategy and selection
Three databases, including PsycNET™, PsycLIT™, PubMed/MEDLINE™, Google Scholar™ and Scopus™, were used to identify related publications. Published RCTs were searched from inception to May 2018. Reference lists from retrieved studies were also manually searched for additional relevant publications. Two groups of medical subject headings (MeSH) and (non-MeSH) were used. The following keywords were considered: “NAC”, “N-acetylcysteine”, “Acetylcysteine”, “N-Acetyl-L-cysteine”, “N-acetyl cysteine”; group 2: “schizophrenia”, “psychosis”, “psychotic disorder”, “schizoaffective”, “dementia praecox”. The wild-card term “*” was also used for improving the sensitivity of the search strategy. Studies were included if they followed an RCT study design (i.e. parallel and cross-over) and were placebo-controlled. Studies were also included if they were published in English and/or Persian; studies with patient diagnoses confirmed as schizophrenic, and/or those presenting with schizoaffective disorder in accordance with DSM-5 criteria in the diagnosis and classification of SZ and other mental disorders [ ].
In addition, studies reporting mean changes with their standard deviations of endpoint, symptomatic improvement assessed with the total, general, positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS), or data for calculating these indices were included [ ]. Studies were excluded if they reported on NAC for patients with a different disorder, involved different treatments, did not report required data for analysis, were unavailable in English and/or Persian language, did not provide additional relevant data for calculating indices, and were not original articles (i.e. reviews, letters or editorials). Additionally, duplicate papers were excluded in the meta-analysis based on the screening of titles and abstracts.
Data extraction
Data was extracted from published studies independently by two reviewers. Any disagreements were resolved by consensus among the team researchers using the standardised extraction forms to guarantee accuracy and consistency. The following key data were extracted: year of publication, study design, country where the study was conducted, demographic characteristics, sample size of both the intervention and control groups and clinical setting of participants (including inpatient and/or outpatient). Inclusion and exclusion criteria included the following: formulation and dosage of NAC supplementation (milligramme per day); co-supplementation and/or drugs; PANSS scores including total, general, positive and negative; side effects of NAC supplementation; quality indices; trial duration and significant outcomes.
The literature searches of electronic databases identified 87 relevant articles, of which 59 total abstracts were excluded due to being review articles ( n = 6), non-English ( n = 6), duplicate studies ( n = 44) or trial protocols ( n = 3). Out of the 28 studies, 23 were excluded because they were case studies ( n = 2); studies containing insufficient reporting of clinical data and primary/secondary outcomes other than SZ indices ( n = 11), studies with inadequate design or characterisation of the patients ( n = 6) or studies with no placebo ( n = 4). A rigorous meta-analysis of the resultant trials ( n = 7) meeting specific inclusion and exclusion criteria was performed.
Quality assessment
The Jadad scale was used to assess the methodological quality of the included trials. The score ranges from 0 (very low) to 5 (very high). The Jadad scale assesses the quality of published clinical trials based on the following three parameters: randomisation, blinding and follow-up. The description of the Jadad scale system is as follows: for randomisation or blinding, 1 point if randomisation/blinding is mentioned, 1 additional point if the method of randomisation/blinding is appropriate and deduction of 1 point if the method of randomisation/blinding is inappropriate; for follow-up, 1 point if the fate of all subjects is known [ , , , ].
Statistical analysis
The statistical analyses were performed using Review Manager Software (RevMan 5.3; Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, England). The standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to assess the effects of NAC on PANSS indices. The statistical heterogeneity was measured using χ 2 and I 2 statistics, with P < 0.05 for χ 2 and ≥ 50% for I 2 indicating an inconsistency between the studies and significant heterogeneity. A random effects model was used if I 2 > 50% and P < 0.1; additionally, we conducted sensitivity and pre-specified subgroup analyses stratified by duration of studies, NAC dosage, duration of illness and quality of study according to the Cochrane guidelines to evaluate possible sources of heterogeneity within the included trials [ ]. The funnel plot test was used to examine the existence of publication bias, which shows asymmetry if publication bias exists. A P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Search results and study selection
A flow chart depicting the process of selection and literature search is presented in Fig. 1 . The literature searches of electronic databases identified 53 relevant articles, of which 25 total abstracts were excluded due to being review articles ( n = 4), non-English ( n = 6), duplicate studies ( n = 12) or trial protocols ( n = 3). Out of the 28 studies, 23 were excluded because they were case studies ( n = 2), studies containing insufficient reporting of clinical data and primary/secondary outcomes other than SZ indices ( n = 11), studies with inadequate design or characterisation of the patients ( n = 6) or studies with no placebo ( n = 4). Rapado-Castro et al. included three different treatment arms [ ], and therefore, based on the Cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of interventions [ ], each group was considered separately in the analysis. Finally, a total of 5 studies with 7 trials met the selection criteria for the meta-analysis [ , , , , ]. Fig. 1 Meta-analysis flow diagram
Description of included studies, treatments, patients and quality assessment
The general characteristics of the included studies are shown in Table 1 . Data were pooled from 7 trials comprising n = 447 participants ( n = 221 in the NAC group and n = 226 in the placebo group). Included studies were published between 2008 and 2018, of which 2 studies were conducted in Iran [ , ] and three performed in the United States and Australia [ , , ]. The clinical trials used different doses of NAC that ranged from 1200 to 3600 mg/day, and the average age of participants was 33.3 and 34.0 years in the NAC-treated and placebo groups, respectively. Duration of treatment ranged from 8 to 52 weeks, and duration of illness varied between 83 days and more than 20 years. All trials used NAC as the main treatment, with exception to one study which used risperidone as the antipsychotic drug and NAC as an augmentation agent [ ]. All studies used PANSS (including total, general, positive and negative syndrome scale) as a measure of SZ symptomatology. Of the 7 trials, six included participants with chronic SZ and one remaining trial was carried out in patients with acute phase of schizophrenic illness. The quality of included trials is presented in Table 2 according to Jadad scale for assessing risk of bias. Five trials were classified as high-quality studies with Jadad score of ≥ 3 [ , , ] and two trials as low-quality studies with Jadad score of < 3 [ , ].

Outpatients 12 weeks NAC; 1200 mg/day NAC-treated patients showed significantly improvement in the positive and negative PANSS subscale. Also, the general and total PANSS scores of NAC group declined over times. Regarding cognitive functions, improvement was observed in some explored areas, such as attention, short-term and working memory, executive functioning and speed of processing. There was no significant difference between the 2 groups in the frequency of adverse effects.

The meta-analysis of outcomes
Meta-analysis of total scores of PANSS showed a significant improvement in the efficacy of NAC treatment compared with the placebo group (SMD = − 0.96; 95% CI = [− 1.69, − 0.24]; P = 0.009). Moreover, the NAC treatment group had lower endpoint scores compared to placebo in PANSS General score (SMD = − 1.04; 95% CI = [− 1.80, − 0.27]; P = 0.008) and PANSS Negative score (SMD = − 0.73; 95% CI = [− 1.29, − 0.17]; P = 0.01) (Fig. 2 ). Due to a high level of statistical heterogeneity in the meta-analysis of all PANSS scores, the random effects model was performed for synthesis of the data. To clarify the sources of observed heterogeneity, subgroup analysis was performed. They revealed significant superiority of NAC over placebo groups in the improvement of the PANSS scores influenced by certain characteristics of the groups; duration of NAC supplementation, NAC dosage, duration of illness, and quality of study.

Effect of duration of NAC supplementation
A subgroup analyses based on the duration of treatment showed that the heterogeneity of all PANSS scores decreased significantly in subgroup analysis by less than 24 weeks of NAC. The result on PANSS Total, General, and Negative scores showed a considerably large effect size in favour of NAC (PANSS Total SMD = − 0.83; PANSS General SMD = − 0.67; PANSS Negative SMD = − 1.09) in line with overall analysis (Table 3 ).

Effect of supplementation dosage
Studies with lower doses of NAC (i.e. ≤ 2000 mg/day) showed a relatively medium effect size of PANSS Total (SMD = − 0.49), General (SMD = − 0.48) and Negative (SMD = − 0.49). The results of all PANSS scores in the lower dose subgroup were consistent with overall analysis (Table 3 ).
Effect of illness duration
Subgroup analysis by illness duration of ≤ 10 years indicated a desirable effect of large size for Total (SMD = − 1.9), General (SMD = − 2.1) and Negative (SMD = − 1.21) symptoms. Compared to the overall results, the heterogeneity of all PANSS scores decreased significantly in subgroup analysis by illness duration of > 10 years. However, contrary with the overall results, the pooled estimate indicated a small effect size of NAC supplementation for nearly all PANSS scores including Total (SMD = − 0.31), General (SMD = − 0.32), Positive (SMD = − 0.06) and Negative (SMD = − 0.39) scores in subgroup analysis by illness duration of > 10 years (Table 3 ).
Effect of study quality
In final subgroup analysis by quality assessment, high-quality studies showed a statistically significant effect size in favour of NAC supplementation in PANSS Total (SMD = − 0.60), General (SMD = − 0.60) and Negative (SMD = − 0.69) scores, which are in line with the overall results. The heterogeneity of all PANSS scores decreased significantly after subgroup analysis by high-quality studies suggesting the quality of studies as one of the potential sources of heterogeneity (Table 3 ).
Sensitivity analysis
In addition to subgroup analysis, we further performed a sensitivity analysis, in which the meta-analysis is repeated, each time omitting one of the studies, and the effect size was re-calculated to examine its influence on the overall effect size [ ]. None of the included trials substantially influenced the pooled effect size ranging from − 0.49 mg/L (95% CI − 0.83, − 0.14) after omitting the trial by Breier et al. [ ], to − 1.14 (95% CI − 1.96, − 0.33), and removal of the trial of Rapado-Castro et al. [ ]. There was no evidence of decreased heterogeneity across the studies after sensitivity analysis, suggesting that single trials were not the main sources of heterogeneity.
Publication bias
The funnel plot test was conducted to evaluate potential publication bias of the present meta-analysis. Symmetrical funnel plots indicated no publication bias in PANSS Total, Positive, General and Negative scores (Fig. 3 ).

Discussion
The present meta-analysis included a total of 447 schizophrenic adults from seven RCTs. Despite considerable heterogeneity among the trials, our findings suggest improvement in Total, General and Negative PANSS following NAC supplementation with no detectable changes observed in the placebo group. These findings were consistent across five of the seven individual RCTs assessed in this study [ , , , , ]. Moreover, as the majority of the trials (six of the seven trials) were performed in patients with chronic SZ, we can imply that the beneficial effect of NAC could be confined to stable chronic patients. However, due to the limited availability of RCTs, which have included acute-phase patients, conclusions cannot be easily drawn. Therefore, it is uncertain whether the efficacy of NAC is confined only to stable chronic patients.
A recent Cochrane review of 22 included trials with over 2000 participants evaluated the effect of several AOXs (including NAC) in their ability as an adjunct treatment for SZ with standard antipsychotic medication [ ]. Although the study showed some improvements by psychotic symptoms (assessed by PANSS) in those supplemented with an AOX compared with those taking antipsychotic treatment alone [ ], the results of their subgroup analysis did not show any significant difference between adjunctive NAC and placebo, which is in contrary with the present meta-analysis [ ]. However, its conclusion regarding to NAC was limited by the short follow-up period of included trials (i.e. ≤ 8 weeks), small number and small sample size of included studies (two trials with 182 participants). They also did not provide data on the most clinically meaningful outcomes, rating scale scores only without consideration of quality of life and acceptability, important factors in the interpretation of the effect of an adjunct treatment (i.e. AOX) alongside standard antipsychotic medication.
NAC is used in the treatment of acetaminophen toxicity and can prevent hepatotoxicity [ ]. It is generally considered to be safe and well-tolerated when administered orally [ ]. There were no adverse effects reported from the seven trials examined, and our findings are similar to those of previous studies [ , ], suggesting their potential ability to act as natural adjuncts in the treatment of SZ. NAC has been reported to improve self-care, motivation, volition, psychomotor stability, stabilization of mood and social interaction [ ], and it may reduce side effects associated with certain second-generation antipsychotic medications commonly used in the treatment of SZ, including neurological [ ] and metabolic side effects, some of which have long-term consequences for cardiovascular disease (CVD) [ ].
The potential use of an amino acid supplement which is safe and relatively inexpensive is important, and it could be a useful adjunct to standard treatment in the management of SZ symptoms, particularly in those affected by clozapine-resistant SZ, and could also improve aspects of cognitive performance in psychosis, especially working memory [ ]. A significant proportion of schizophrenic patients does not respond effectively to clozapine with 40–60% exhibiting residual negative and cognitive symptoms or presenting with intolerable side effects which limit the option of increasing clozapine dosage and adversely compromise quality of life [ , ]. NAC has also been shown to improve a range of other psychiatric disorders, including depression, bipolar and obsessive-compulsive disorders [ ], and few adverse effects have been reported [ , ].
Subgroup analysis confirmed significant heterogeneity among trials, and subgroup analysis showed significant reductions in studies ≤ 24 weeks, with a considerable effect size on Total, General and Negative scores (Total SMD = − 0.83; General SMD = − 0.67; Negative SMD = − 1.09) following NAC supplementation. Similarly, lower doses (≤ 2000 mg/day) reported greater improvements in Total, General and Negative PANSS with acceptable homogeneity. Similarly, patients with a duration of illness (≤ 10 years) also experienced greater improvements in clinical outcomes, indicating the possibility that NAC might be more effective in SZ at medium term of illness duration. PANSS scores did not decrease significantly in subgroup analysis by illness duration of > 10 years, and it is possible that the efficacy of NAC could potentially be reduced with time. The reasons for this are unclear at present, and further research is important to understand the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics of NAC.
Although the potential mechanism(s) of action of NAC are not yet fully understood, evidence from preclinical studies indicates its role in multiple processes; oxidative stress, neurogenesis, apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation and dysregulation of neurotransmitter systems [ ]. These factors are thought to be important in the underlying pathophysiology of SZ (and other psychiatric disorders). NAC is also a GSH precursor, and it may be important in the regulation of dopamine and glutamate neurochemical systems (important pathways in the onset of positive and negative symptoms and cognitive function). NAC could therefore improve negative symptoms during the early stages of SZ via indirect modulation of these pathways through changes in glutamatergic function [ ]. More research is essential to determine its precise role; nonetheless, the current evidence indicates its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, where it may act via glutamatergic, neurotropic and inflammatory pathways.
In the present study, quantitative analysis was performed for all studies, and all were placebo-controlled. Most of the studies reported beneficial effects of NAC on PANSS and were more effective in studies with duration of ≤ 24 weeks, lower doses (≤ 2000 mg/day) and duration of illness ≤ 10 years. There was also some evidence to suggest that it could be important as a co-adjuvant in the treatment of SZ. Oral NAC was generally well-accepted, tolerated and considered to be safe [ , ], with no reports of any adverse events or withdrawals in the included trials.
Although the effective dosage of NAC was not established from the trials analysed, administration of lower doses appeared to be more beneficial. Our subgroup analysis indicates that doses of ≤ 2000 mg/day were associated with greater improvements in Total, General and Negative PANSS with appropriate homogeneity. NAC dosage ranged from 1200 to 3600 mg/day, and sub-group analysis for dosage indicated a greater improvement in symptoms with lower doses (i.e. ≤ 2000 mg/day). Previous studies used higher doses of NAC in the range 3000–4800 mg/day, for conditions including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) with no clear association of greater efficacy at higher doses [ ]. In fact, one study indicated possible neutropenia with higher doses up to 6000 mg/day that was reversed on lowering the dose to 2400 mg/day [ ]. Based on the safety profile and evidence from previous trials, positive responses with NAC dosage in the range of 2000–2400 mg/day seem to be well-tolerated and the most effective.
There were several limitations in the present study including the relatively small sample size and the significant heterogeneity of the included trials. We excluded studies that did not meet the specific criteria and information necessary to conduct a rigorous meta-analysis (as described in the “ Data extraction ” section of the “ Materials and methods ” section). Other limitations included not controlling for confounding factors which may have influenced our results. We recommend that future trials are conducted in accordance with CONSORT guidelines, to include high-quality studies with larger sample sizes. Despite these limitations, there were several strengths to this study. Firstly, it is to our knowledge, the first time a systematic review and meta-analysis has been performed in the evaluation of NAC treatment on PANSS in SZ. We have combined and pooled the existing data from the most recent RCTs in this subject area, adopted rigid criteria and considered the efficacy of NAC over a longer duration (i.e. 8 to 52 weeks); a random effects model was used for assessing heterogeneity between studies; and RCTs were assessed using subgroup analysis based on clinical condition and quality assessment.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the findings from this present meta-analysis suggest some improvement in PANSS in SZ following NAC supplementation. However, due to the limited availability of high-quality studies with SZ patients and relatively small sample sizes of the included RCTs, well-designed trials with adequate sample sizes are recommended. Nonetheless, our data suggest a potential role of NAC especially in early to mid-stages of SZ, and further clinical studies are warranted to determine the precise role of NAC as an anti-psychotic agent.
