Introduction
Circulating concentrations of estrogen and progesterone have been well-documented for the estrus cycle of dairy cows. Just before the onset of behavioral estrus, there is a sudden rise in plasma estradiol concentration. There is plasma estradiol concentration peak at the beginning of heat and a decrease to basal concentrations at the time of ovulation. During the rest of the cycle, there are fluctuations in concentrations although there is a discrete peak around day 6 of the cycle (Glencross et al. ) that may be related to the first wave of follicular growth (Roche and Ireland ). When progesterone concentrations decrease to the basal levels, the anterior pituitary block is removed, then, suddenly, the gonadotrophins are released (Noakes et al. ). The changes in the progesterone plasma level follow closely the physical changes of the corpus luteum (CL). In a number of cows, there is evidence of a delay in progesterone production or secretion by the CL (Lamming et al. ), which does not appear to affect the fertility of the individual adversely. The progesterone peak is at days 7 and 8 after ovulation, and it decreases fairly quickly from day 18. There is a lower peak before the progesterone concentration becomes maximal (Glencross and Pope ; Glencross et al. ). Moreover, Schams et al. ( ) reported a third peak around day 11, but its levels were about tenfold higher than those of others (Schams et al. ).
Cortisol modulates the production and action of cytokines and prostaglandins required for ovulation, luteolysis, embryo implantation, fetal growth, and placental development (Andersen ). It is synthesized from cholesterol in the adrenal cortex and is locally regulated by 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (Duong et al. ). Cortisol concentration was determined just in heifers because possible changes during the estrus cycle in cows may be covered by the milking stimulus effects (Karg and Schams ; Wagner and Oxenreider ). Increased levels of cortisol (Adeyemo et al. ; Swanson et al. ) around estrus were not found in the research done by Dieleman and Blankestein ( ), even when low-frequency sampling was considered in the patterns analysis (Dieleman and Blankenstein ). The cortisol level fluctuated throughout the estrus cycle; its overall mean has been 17.1 ± 2 nmol/l and cortisol concentration has not been related to the stage of estrus cycle (Dieleman et al. ).
Some ultrasound characteristics of ovaries and uterus, such as the CL diameter and its echotexture, the diameter of follicle, and the uterine shape and echotexture, can be used for the assessment of estrus cycle in cows (Baez et al. ). By ultrasound, accumulation of fluids can be visualized in uterine lumen. The appearance of estrus secretions and fetal fluids in ultrasound images is anechoic (Sajjan ). There are several studies on various aspects of the ultrasonic characteristic of the uterus (Pierson and Ginther ).
Changes in steroid hormone concentrations influenced the reproductive tract (Ginther ). Some researchers indicated notable ultrasound variations in the uterus close to ovulation time in Holstein heifers (Gilbert et al. ). Endometrial thickness (Baez et al.) increased at the time of normal luteolysis and reached maximum thickness on the day before ovulation (Ferguson et al. ). After ovulation, endometrial thickness and variations in endometrial echotexture decreased, likely due to the rise of progesterone (P4) values (Ferguson et al. ; Sajjan ; Souza et al. ).
In Ginther’s study, values for all ultrasound scores of uterus increased before ovulation, reached a peak immediately before or immediately after ovulation, and then declined gradually. Thus, the uterus showed heterogeneous edematous characteristics during estrus and, by approximately day 5 or 6, returned to diestrus with a homogeneous appearance. The pattern of development seemed comparable to the periovulatory profile of serum estrogen concentration. The results indicated that the uterine ultrasonic characteristics could be used as a general biologic indicator of estrogen to progesterone ratio in cattle, similar to those of mares (Ginther ).
Also, for the evaluation of the presence and severity of inflammatory changes of the uterine wall, the diameter of the uterine horn and cervix, and the amount and type of fluid in the uterine lumen should be considered (Kasimanickam et al. ). In the conditions without any fluid accumulation, it is difficult to determine the pathological changes by using ultrasound, but it is an important technique for the diagnosis of endometritis (Barlund et al. ; Kähn ).
Lüttgenau et al. ( ) concluded that ultrasound examination of cows gave in artificial insemination, promoted rule out from insemination of proestrus and diestrus cows, and decreased estrus detection errors (Lüttgenau et al. ). As mentioned before, there were structural changes in uterus and ovarian structures related to phases of the estrus cycle. Also, the same association has been revealed between estrogen and progesterone concentration and estrus and diestrus phases. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the relationship between ultrasound findings from structural changes in ovarian and uterus and serum estradiol, progesterone, and cortisol concentrations in heat dairy cows.
Materials and methods
Statement of animal rights
The experiment was performed under the approval of the state committee on animal ethics, Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran (IACUC no. 4687/63). Also, the recommendations of the European Council Directive (86/609/EC) of November 24, 1986, regarding the protection of animals used for experimental purposes were considered.
Animals
This cross-sectional study was performed on 89 heat primi and pluriparous Holstein dairy cows with various DIM in a large commercial dairy herd in Shiraz, Fars, Iran, from August 2014 to January 2015. Reproduction and production data for 89 lactating dairy cows were collected for the study. The geographical area had a warm climate with four distinct seasons, with peak summer temperatures about 40 °C, and a winter with temperatures reaching below freezing. Cows were housed in a free-stall with sand for bedding. Cows were fed a TMR diet based on NRC recommendations. The cows were machine-milked three times daily. Reproductive cycles of animals were non-seasonal with year-round calves. The average peak milk yield (9 weeks postpartum) of the cows was 52 kg. The voluntary waiting period was 55 days. As a routine managerial program, BCS was evaluated on the day of AI (Ferguson et al. ). Estrus detection has been performed by trained personnel and when the standing heat was detected, the cows were inseminated based on a.m./p.m. rule. The clean test was performed between days 27 and 32 postpartum.
Transrectal ultrasonography
The heat cows were restrained in stanchions for the examination and the rectum was evacuated of feces. Ultrasound examination was conducted by one person and using a portable ultrasound machine (Easi-Scan®, BCF, UK), fitted with a 5-MHz linear transducer. Ovaries and cervix were localized and all parts of the reproductive tract were examined. The follicle diameters were measured and the cows were grouped accordingly (1 = small size (< 14 mm); 2 = medium size (15–19 mm); 3 = large size (≥ 20 m). Also, ovaries were checked for the presence of corpus luteum (Gilbert et al.) and grouped (0 = without CL; 1 = with CL). Thickness of the uterus was measured and grouped (1 = <2 cm; 2 = ≥ 2 cm). Folding and edema of the uterus were scored (1 = minimum; 2 = medium; 3 = maximum). Also, lumen of the uterus was scored (0 = none; 1 = minimum; 2 = medium; 3 = maximum) (Ginther ).
Hormone assays
At the insemination day, blood samples were collected from the coccygeal vein of 89 Holstein dairy cows at 6–8 a.m. for the assay of progesterone, estrogen, and cortisol concentrations. Blood samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Serum was separated and stored at − 20 °C until (less than 6 months) hormonal assay by ELISA progesterone (DiaMetra, S.r.l., Italy), estrogen (Monobind Inc., Lake Forest, CA92630, USA), and cortisol kits (DiaMetra, S.r.l., Italy). All ELISA kits for analysis of steroid hormones have been validated for bovine serum samples. The sensitivity of progesterone, estrogen, and cortisol kits was 0.05 ng/ml, 6.50 pg/ml, and 2.44 ng/ml, respectively. The intra-assay precision and inter-assay precision of progesterone, estrogen, and cortisol kits were CV < 10% and CV < 12%, respectively.
Statistical analyses
The data were analyzed using SPSS software version 16 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) computer program. Descriptive data were presented as mean and standard error of mean (SEM). For each uterine or ovarian characteristic, means of steroid hormones were compared between categories by analysis of variance (ANOVA). The association of ultrasound findings and steroid hormones was investigated using non-parametric Spearman’s correlations (Spearman’s rho). In all analyses, P value less than 0.05 was considered significant.
Results
The mean ± SEM progesterone, estrogen, and cortisol concentrations in accordance with ultrasound characteristics of uterus and ovaries are presented in Table 1 . No significant differences were observed in steroid hormones between categories of each uterine or ovarian characteristic. There was no correlation between steroid hormone (progesterone, estradiol, and cortisol) concentrations and uterine ultrasonic parameters including edema score, folding score, uterine thickness, and contractility score ( P > 0.05, Table 2 ). However, among ovarian characteristics, there was a significant negative association between CL existence and estradiol concentration ( r = − 0.218, P = 0.041; Table 3 ). The corresponding measures for P4 and cortisol were 0.044 and − 0.034, respectively ( P > 0.05).

Discussion
We could not find any relationship between ultrasound characteristics of uterus and ovarian structures, and steroid hormone levels in heat dairy cows. There were not any significant differences in progesterone levels of estrus cows with or without CL on ovaries. Diameter of ovulatory follicle did not affect estradiol concentration at the time of estrus.
The ultrasonographic imaging of the reproductive system provides a rapid and safe diagnosis of ovarian and uterine conditions. Several methods, such as ultrasonography, uterine cytology, and biopsy, have been used to evaluate fertility in many species (Baerwald and Pierson ). Several researchers indicated notable ultrasound changes in the uterus and endometrium close to ovulation time in Holstein heifers (Pierson and Ginther ). The endometrium (Baez et al. 2016) was thicker at the time of normal luteolysis and the thickest on the day before ovulation (Pierson and Ginther ) and it decreased after ovulation. Our results indicated no correlation between serum progesterone, estradiol and cortisol concentrations, and endometrial thickness in heat dairy cows. Ultrasonographic examination of endometrial thickness (Baez et al. 2016) has been used for more than two decades to estimate endometrial receptivity during assisted reproduction techniques (ART) for humans (Baerwald and Pierson ). In our earlier study, pregnancy rate was higher in heat cows with uterine diameter less than 2 cm than that of other groups, but it was not significant (submitted manuscript, p > 0.05). We believe that many of the cows with uterine diameter more than 2 cm were multiparous cows and parity may affect uterine diameter as reported previously (Baez et al. ).
Changes in P4, E2, and cortisol concentrations were not statistically significant during estrus; therefore, there was not a significant correlation between steroid hormone levels and thickness of uterus in estrus cows. Sajjan et al. (2014) found there was no correlation between serum progesterone levels and endometrial thickness, whereas Souza et al. ( ) revealed a negative correlation between ET and serum P4 concentrations ( r = − 0.28, P = 0.05). When progesterone concentration is increased, there would be a decrease in endometrial thickness (Sajjan ; Souza et al. ).
Some significant changes of the tubular parts of the reproductive tract that are visible by ultrasonography include accumulations of mucus, evidence of increased vascularity and edema, and thickness of the uterine body (Pierson and Ginther ; Pierson and Ginther ). The proestrus and estrus phases from days − 4 to − 1 (day 0 = ovulation) are characterized by (1) luminal fluid accumulation in the uterus followed by fluid in the cervix and vagina, (2) increasing uterine body thickness, and (3) at least loop of the uterine horns. But, diestrus phase between days 3–16 is characterized by minimal luminal fluid and thickness, and maximal loop to the uterine horns (Pierson and Ginther ).
There is minimum progesterone concentration in estrus day of non-pregnant cows, and high estradiol level was found about 31 h before the LH surge. We studied the estrus cows at the time in which they were expected to have minimal progesterone concentration, maximal concentration of estrogen, and hence minimum folding of uterus. There are temporal associations between increased circulating estradiol and increased uterine unfolding (Ginther ). Our result indicated that there was no correlation between serum estradiol and cortisol concentration, and the folding score of uterus in heat dairy cows. The scores of uterine edema began to increase around the time of ovulation. Scores were at their highest during the period in which maximal progesterone secretion occurred and decreased before the estrus and ovulation (Ginther ). In our study, there was no correlation between serum estradiol and cortisol concentration, and the uterine edema score in our animal study.
The changes in uterine ultrasonic characteristics in heifers have been similar to those in mares (Ginther ). The pattern of development seemed comparable to the periovulatory profile of serum estrogen concentrations. Increasing edema and luminal fluids of uterus are both closely related to increasing E2 levels, but the decreasing edema occurs gradually after the estradiol peak compared to the loss of luminal fluids (Pierson and Ginther ). This seems reasonable because the loss of luminal fluids can occur rapidly through the cervix whereas loss of the tissue fluids requires time-consuming resorption or passage into the lumen (Pierson and Ginther ). The passage of endometrial fluid through the labia occurs on about day 1 of estrus cycle in most cows as indicated by the blood-tinged mucus (Ginther ). This phenomenon may be related to the decreased volume of uterine luminal fluid observed in the ultrasound studies on day 1 (Ginther ). Although circulating concentrations of cortisol in cows with lumen scores 2 and 3 were higher than those in cows with lumen scores 0 and 1 (lumen score 0 = 36.8 ± 11.2 vs lumen score 3 = 36.8 ± 11.2), no conclusion was drawn due to presence of few cows with lumens 2 and 3.
Others found that pregnancy rates in cows with follicles 13.5–17.5 mm in diameter were more than those in cows with other follicle sizes ( P < 0.01) (Keskin et al. ). Embryonic death was lower ( P < 0.01) in heat cows with follicles 13.5–16.5 mm in diameter. Breed, milk production, parity, and season could influence follicle size (Keskin et al. ). Estrus cows with larger ovulatory follicles had greater pregnancy per AI (Keskin et al. ). Previously, it was indicated that larger ovulatory follicles in heat time were related to higher E2 and P4 concentrations, and a larger CL. Higher estradiol concentrations facilitate sperm and oocyte transport in the reproductive tract and improve uterine lumen for early embryonic growth (Keskin et al. ). Furthermore, the CL, which is formed following ovulation from larger follicle, is large and produces high progesterone level. One of the important factors in early embryonic growth in dairy cows is high P4 concentration (Keskin et al. ). There was no correlation between serum progesterone, estradiol and cortisol concentration, and follicle size in estrus cows.
We studied the estrus cows at the time in which it was expected that they would have minimal progesterone (< 0.5 ng/ml) concentration and maximal concentration of estrogen. In this study, cows with CL had minimum progesterone concentration. It may indicate that CL on the ovary of estrus cows has been unfunctional and inactive. There was no correlation between serum progesterone and cortisol concentrations, and the presence of CL in heat cows, but there was a negative relationship between heat cows with Cl existence and estradiol concentration ( r = − 0.21).
Conclusions
In conclusion, estrus cows had a high level of estradiol and low concentration of progesterone at the time of AI, but there were not any significant changes and no correlation was found between ultrasonic parameters of uterus and ovarian structures, and hormonal changes related to estrus in Holstein dairy cows.
