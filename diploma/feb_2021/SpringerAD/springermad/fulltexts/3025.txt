Background
Gastric cancer is most common malignancy [ ] and is the third leading of death, accounting for 46,679 confirmed death annually in Japan [ ]. Bleeding and obstruction are common localized symptoms in patients with unresectable gastric cancer. These can cause a significant impact on a patient’s quality of life. Therapeutic options to control symptom of local disease progression such as bleeding and obstruction include palliative surgical technique [ , , ] and endoscopic techniques [ , ].
Responses to radiotherapy (RT) are not as immediate as with endoscopic techniques or surgical palliation, but RT are less intensive than them. Mantel et al. reported, in 1982, that 13 of 17 patients who had gastric cancer obstruction were responsible for RT [ ]. Kim reported, in 2007, that response rate of patients who has bleeding and obstruction was 70% (14/20) for bleeding and 81% (13/16) for obstruction [ ]. Tey reported, in 2007, that response rate was 54% (13/24) with bleeding by RT [ ]. Kenji reported, in 2009, that 13 of 19 patients (68.8%) were in response and time to event free was 1.5 months [ ]. There are no controlled studies and only few retrospective analysis [ , ] about palliative RT for patients with unresectable gastric cancer, and predictors for therapeutic success are unknown.
Methods
Patients
Information was obtained from the patient’s medical and RT records. Clinical factors reviewed included patient demographics [age, gender, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG-PS)] [ ], clinical stage, metastatic site, endoscopic classification of primary site [ ], chemotherapy regimen with (pre-, post-, and concurrent RT), and RT parameters (dose fractionation regimens and total dose). We obtained clinical data of 23 patients with unresectable advanced gastric cancer demonstrating local bleeding and/or obstruction in our institute retrospectively. Patients were received RT or CRT as a palliative intent for gastric bleeding or obstruction in our hospital between April 2006 and March 2014. Eligible patients were as follows: patients with biopsy-proven gastric cancer, they had no prior RT against local upper intestinal and they were older than 20 years. Patients with symptom of either localized bleeding who needs blood transfusion within 1 month before palliative RT were 18. Patients with symptom of upper gastric obstruction who could not take orally within 1 month before palliative RT were 10.
Treatment
All the patients received external beam RT 5 days a week. Radiation was delivered to the whole stomach in all patients with photons of 10 MV (megavoltage) from a linear accelerator. Median dose (range) of RT was 42 Gy (30–60 Gy) and median fraction (range) was 20 Fr (10–30 Fr). However, patients with incompletion of RT were two cases (18 Gy/9 Fr, 34 Gy/17 Fr). Fraction size (1.8/2/2.5/3) was 7/8/6/2 and fields arrangements (2/3/4) were 5/8/9 (Table 2 ). All patients were computed tomography (CT) planed and planning target volume was the stomach with a 2-cm margin. The organs of interest that were contoured included the liver, kidney, and spinal cord.
Procedures and response
We defined response of RT for bleeding as no need for blood transfusion for over 1 month from the beginning of RT. The response of RT for obstruction was defined as capable of oral intake again and maintain over 1 month from the beginning of RT in those with obstruction. We calculated the response rate of RT as therapeutic successes depending on whether of each response on the above criterion for each bleeding and obstruction. We defined event-free survival as the interval from the start of RT to the first day of an event including blood transfusion, oral intake impossible, or any cause of death. Overall survival was the interval from diagnosis to any cause of death. We definitely completed the planned dose of RT as completion. Treatment toxicity was retrospectively scored using the Common Terminology Criteria version 3.0 [ ].
Endpoints
The primary endpoint was risk response rate of RT or CRT and the time to event free for bleeding and obstruction of local symptom by primary gastric cancer. The secondary was treatment toxicity and therapeutic success against gastric local symptom.
Statistical analysis
analysis of the time to event distribution was performed using the Kaplan–Meier plots and log-rank tests. Analysis and calculation of the risk for response were performed using Cox’s proportional hazard models. All analyses were performed using the JMP 9 software for Windows (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).
Ethical considerations
The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki. The institutional review board approved this study. All measurements and treatments were performed within routine clinical practice. We used an opt-out method, rather than acquiring written or oral informed consent.

Therapeutic intervention
The median (range) total dose and fraction of RT were 42 (18–60) Gy and 20 (9–30) Fr, respectively. Combination chemotherapy was administered to 43.5%. Completion of RT was 91.3%. Details in chemotherapy regimen with concurrent, pre-, and post-RT were as follows: 5-fluorouracil/cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil/methotrexate and tegafur, gimeracil and oteracil (S-1) were 8, 1, and 1 with concurrent RT, cisplatin-based/paclitaxel-based/irinotecan-based were 5/6/4 with pre-RT, and cisplatin-based/paclitaxel-based/irinotecan based were 3/3/2 with post -RT (Table 2 ).

Response, time of event-free survival, and adverse event
The response rates were 88.8% (bleeding) and 80% (obstruction). The median event-free survival times of the bleeding and obstruction groups from the start of radiation were 103 and 104 days, respectively.
The median survival time from the start of radiation and overall survival were 119 and 519 days, respectively. Almost patients (75% in bleeding, 75% in obstruction) in response almost did not need required blood transfusion or oral take impossible again from the start of RT to death.
Adverse events with RT and CRT were grade 2 nausea ( n = 4), grade 2 esophagitis ( n = 3), and grade 2 neutropenia ( n = 3). There were no other hematological and organ toxicity include kidney and liver (Table 3 ). There was no need to decrease dose of RT for patients because of hematological and organ toxicity.

Discussion
We obtained data patients with advanced gastric cancer who received palliative RT. Palliative radiation therapy for gastric bleeding and obstruction in patients with unresectable gastric cancer was safe and efficacious: response rate was 88.8% for bleeding and 80% for obstruction; no severe adverse events were observed. Almost patients in response almost did not need required blood transfusion or oral take impossible again from the start of RT to death. Predictive factors for non-response were the completion of therapy ( p = 0.001), and location of antrum ( p = 0.063) and peritoneum metastasis ( p = 0.054) was in trend.
The most important findings were that therapeutic success has an association with the primary site and metastatic regions. It was poor response for patients with peritoneal dissemination whether therapeutic successes or not. We supposed that the widespread of obstruction and bleeding could disturb response of RT as local treatment, because invasion of peritoneal dissemination is not localized progress but diffuses progress for each abdominal organ.
Kenji reported that therapeutic success has association with biological effective dose, which is over 50Gy 10 . It assumed radiotherapeutic success which depends on frequency and amount of irradiation. We may be tending to other choices for treatment of symptoms such as bleeding and obstruction, because therapeutic response needs frequency and duration. However, physician could decide predicting therapeutic success before initiation of therapy from our results depending on the primary site and metastatic regions.
The second important findings were that response rate was like the past reports [ , , , ]. There were a few reports which increase of adverse event about palliative radiation for gastric cancer depending on amount of radiation dose. Kenji reported that they underwent irradiation for bleeding, but there were only two cases of grade 3 white blood cell decrease and four cases of grade 3 nausea of their study [ ]. We have an experience of one patient’s death during RT; this was not treatment-related death but by primary reason. We have experienced only four cases of grade 2 nausea and three cases of grade 2 esophagitis in this study. Radio-therapeutic technique is effective and well-tolerated modality for the local palliation of gastric cancer.
This study has some limitations. First, this study was retrospective analysis in single center institute and subjected to reviewer bias. Because the criteria of effect have not been previously prepared in this study due to measure clinical factor retrospectively, so it could be ambiguous, arbitrary, and non-reproducible. Second, our dose fractionation regimens were heterogeneous, including different fractionation regimens. Prospective trials are warranted to delineate the most appropriate fractionation schedules for effective and durable symptom palliation. Third, we have no data about efficacy of RT for other symptoms such as abdominal pain. The strengths of the present study were including the information of concurrent chemotherapy. In the past report, concurrent chemotherapy was including 55% for bleeding and 75% for obstruction [ ]. However, there were no reports about difference between simple RT and CRT as a palliative intervention for gastric cancer. The decision whether there is a combination of chemotherapy did not influence on the therapeutic success from our result.
Conclusion
We reported the efficacy of palliative radiation for unresectable gastric cancer. Radio-therapeutic technique is effective and well-tolerated modality for the local palliation of gastric cancer.
