Introduction
Isoflurane [2-chloro-2-(difluoromethoxy)-1,1,1-trifluoro-ethane] is a halogenated ether used for inhalational anesthesia [ ]. Among various anesthesia, it is one of the most widely used volatile anesthetics in clinical practice for providing unconsciousness [ ]. Because of its relative low metabolic rate and solubility, isoflurane leads to reduced anesthesia induction during surgery as well as shortened recovery time after surgery with the benefits in a wide range of medical situations [ ]. Moreover, isoflurane can be applied to stroke victims by reducing the amount of ischemic injury during the event of stroke and delaying the development of brain injury [ ]. Isoflurane involves in renal protection against ischemia–reperfusion (I/R) injury through reducing plasma creatinine [ ]. It has been reported that volatile anesthetics such as isoflurane could protect the heart against ischemia–reperfusion injury [ ]. One recent study has demonstrated that isoflurane preconditioning could reduce infarct size during ischemia/reperfusion through attenuating the LDH release [ ], suggesting a protected role of isoflurane on the heart during I/R injury through regulating cardiomyocytes death. Increased evidence supports that administration of inhaled anesthetics could reduce the degree of ischemia and reperfusion injury to the heart through multiple mechanisms: regulation of the potassium ATP (KATP) channel, mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production [ ]. Moreover, PI3 K, Akt and extracellular signal kinase (ERK) pathways were known to involve in the protection of heart during ischemia and reperfusion injury by volatile anesthetics [ ]. However, the precise mechanisms are still under investigation.
Oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of cardiovascular disease, including ischemic heart injury and cardiomyocytes dysfunction [ , ]. Moreover, persistent exposure to oxidative stress such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) is associated with dysfunction of myocardium cardiomyocyte, leading to apoptotic cell death [ ].
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short 18–22 single-strand nucleotide, which suppress their target proteins expression through degradation of messenger RNAs [ ]. It is widely studied that miRNAs have been linked to the cardiomyocyte functions in both physiological and pathological conditions (ischemic reperfusion, hypoxia and heat shock) [ ]. It has been reported that overexpression of miR-21 significantly decreased infarct size after acute myocardial infarction [ ]. Recent studies have demonstrated that isoflurane as well as other anesthetics could influence microRNA expression profiles in the liver and in neurons [ , , ], suggesting that isoflurane exposure may influence microRNA in cardiomyocyte as well. Moreover, the roles of miR-21 in isoflurane-induced cardioprotection have been revealed by two groups [ , ]. They showed that isoflurane protects mouse hearts from ischemia–reperfusion injury by a microRNA-21-dependent mechanism. Recent studies have reported that miR-23a promotes apoptosis induced by oxidative stress [ ] or ischemic/reperfusion [ ], suggesting that inhibition of miR-23a could protect the oxidative stress-induced cardiomyocyte. However, whether miR-23 plays essential roles during the isoflurane-mediated cardioprotection against oxidative stress has not been illustrated. Therefore, it is important to delineate underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms contributing to the recovery of cardiomyocyte dysfunction through miRNAs under oxidative stress. In this study, we will use an in vitro rat cardiomyocyte model to investigate, for the first time, the roles of miR-23 in isoflurane-mediated cardiomyocyte protection against oxidative stress. The new pathways which involve in the miR-23-modulated cardioprotective effects by isoflurane will be identified.
Methods
Cell Culture
The rat myocardial cell line (H9c2) was obtained from the Chinese Academy of Sciences Cell Bank (Shanghai, China). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) containing 1500 mg/L NaHCO 2 , supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin. Cells were cultured in an incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 supply.
Animals
All experiments involving the use of rats were approved by the Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee of West China Hospital, Sichuan University. Animals were housed with free access to food and water. One- to two-day-old Sprague–Dawley rat pups were used for the cardiomyocyte isolation.
Neonatal Cardiomyocytes Isolation and Cultures
Neonatal cardiomyocytes were isolated and cultured according to previous reports [ , ]. Briefly, left ventricles were dissected from 1- to 2-day-old Sprague–Dawley rat pups and ventricular myocardium was incubated in ADS buffer (116 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES, 1 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 5.5 mM glucose, 5.4 mM KCl, 0.8 mM MgSO 4 , 0.6 ml/l phenol red, pH 7.35) with 0.15 mg/ml collagenase (Sigma Aldrich, Shanghai, China) and 0.52 mg/ml pancreatin (Sigma Aldrich, Shanghai, China) for 30 min at 37 °C with gently shaking. The supernatant which contains cells was collected and centrifuged. The cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml newborn calf serum and maintained at 37 °C. Procedures were repeated three times until all tissue was digested. The cells were then resuspended in Dulbecco’s modified essential medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.5% penicillin–streptomycin and 20 mM HEPES at pH 7.2 and preplated for 2 h on cell culture dishes to separate ventricular myocytes from other myofibrolast cells. The ventricular myocytes which did not attached were collected and plated on 0.1% gelatin-coated dishes for the downstream experiments.
Exposure of Neonatal Rat Cardiomyocyte Culture to Isoflurane
The pooled neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were randomly separated to the isoflurane-exposed or control group. 2 × 10 5 cells were plated into each well of 12-well plate 1 day for experiments. Isoflurane exposure was performed in a sealed chamber placed in a 37 °C incubator with treatment of isoflurane at a concentration of 0.5 mM in stock solution dissolved in DMSO for 30 min in cell culture medium. Isoflurane-exposed cells were removed from the sealed chamber and incubated in normal cell culture condition for 15 min for deletion of the volatile anesthetic before downstream experiments.
GSH/GSSG Ratio Detection
The detection of reduced glutathione was performed using the GSH/GSSG Ratio Detection Assay Kit (ab138881, Abcam) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, 2 × 10 5 H9c2 cells or primary cardiomyocytes were transfected with control miRNA or miR-23 mimic and lysed by treating with 100 μl of ice cold lysis buffer (supplied by the manufacturer). Cells were homogenized quickly followed by centrifugation for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was collected and then was treated to remove proteins by a Deproteinizing Sample Kit-TCA (ab204708). Fifty microliters of GSH assay mixture (GAM) was prepared and added into each GSH samples to detect GSH only. 50 µl of total GSH assay mixture (TGAM) was added into each GSSG samples to detect total GSH + GSSG (reduced and oxidized). Plate was incubated at room temperature for 30 min protected from light. Fluorescence was measured with excitation at 490 nm and emission at 520 nm. Then, the GSH/GSSG was calculated by GSH/total GSH. The relative glutathione amount was calculated with the normalization of protein amount of each sample. The protein concentration was determined using the “DC Protein Assay Reagents Package Kit” (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) [ ]. Experiments were performed in triplicate.
qRT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated using the miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) according to the manufactory’s instruction. Samples were washed twice in buffer, and total RNA was eluted using RNase-free water. cDNA was synthesized using qScript microRNA cDNA Synthesis Kit (Quanta bio, Beverly, MA, USA) after the treatments of RNA samples for the deletion of genomic DNA. One microgram of RNA was added to a mixture of qScript reverse transcriptase, microRNA cDNA reaction mix and poly (A) tailing reaction. The mixture was incubated at 42 °C for 20 min, then at 85 °C for 5 min for conversion of RNA to cDNA. PCR was performed to analyze the expression of miR-23 by using a mirVana qRT-PCR miRNA detection kit and mirVana qRT-PCR Primer Sets (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s protocols. Human U6 served as an internal control. RT-PCR analysis was performed using Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-Time PCR System. The \(2^{{ - {\Delta \Delta }C_{\text{T}} }}\) method was performed to analyze the miRNA expressions.
Mimic miR-23, Anti-miR-23 and Control miRNAs Transfection
Mimic miR-23 (5′-AUCACAUUGCCAGGGAUUUCC-3′), anti-miR-23 and control miRNAs transfection were performed at 50 nM using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagents according to the manufactory’s instruction. Briefly, 1.5 × 10 5 cells were plated into 12-well plate for overnight. The next day, the miRNA-lipid complexes were formed by mixing 50 nM miRNA mimic/inhibitor/control with 3 μl Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. The complexes were incubated at room temperature for 20 min and then added into cell culture medium. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were collected for the downstream experiments.
Cell Viability Assay
1 × 10 4 cells were seeded in a 96-well plate for overnight incubation. Cells were then treated with various concentrations of H 2 O 2 with or without exposure to isoflurane. Cell viability was measured by MTT assay (Sigma Diagnostics, Inc., St Louis, MO): MTT was dissolved in 1X sterile PBS at 5 mg/ml concentration. Ten microliters of MTT solution was added into each well of cell culture plate and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. After centrifugation at 450× g for 5 min at room temperature, medium was removed. DMSO was added to each well to solubilize the crystals, and the plates were read at 540 nm using a microplate reader. Relative cell viability was calculated from the absorbance at 540 nm of treated cells/the absorbance at 540 nm of untreated cells. Experiments were repeated three times.
Caspase-3 Activity Assay
Caspase-3 activity was measured using the caspase-3 colorimetric assay kits (R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocols. Briefly, cells were plated on a 6-well plate for overnight. 5 × 10 4 cells with or without treatments were lysed in lysis buffer from the kit. The cell lysates (30 μg proteins) were incubated with caspase-3 specific substrates provided from this kit (Ac-DEVD-pNA and Ac-LEHD-pNA) at 37 °C for 1 h. Caspase activity and absorbance were measured using an immunosorbent assay reader at OD 405 nm. Experiments were performed in triplicate.
TUNEL Assay
To measure the double-stranded cleavage of DNA, TUNEL assay was performed using an in situ cell death detection kit (11684795910 ROCHE, Basel, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, cells were transfected with control or anti-miR-23 followed by H 2 O 2 treatments. Cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. After washing, the cells were permeabilized by 0.1% Triton on ice. The cells were then incubated with the TUNEL reaction mixture for 1 h. Cells were stained with DAPI for 5 min. After complete washing, stained cells were examined by a fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Tokyo, Japan), and images were analyzed by ImageJ software.
Detection of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)
Intracellular ROS generation was determined by using the total ROS/Superoxide Detection Kit (Enzo Life Sciences). Briefly, cells were plated on cover glass for overnight. 2 × 10 5 cells in a 12-well plate with or without treatments for the induction of ROS were incubated with oxidative stress detection reagent for 1 h at regular cell culture condition and then washed three times with wash buffer. Cells were overlaid on glass slides and analyzed under fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Melville, NY, USA). Captured fluorescence images were analyzed with ImageJ software [ ].
Statistical Analysis
All experiments were performed in triplicate. Student’s t tests and 2-way ANOVA were performed using Prism 5.0 software to assess the statistical significance between control/treatment groups. P values with less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.
Results
Isoflurane Suppresses miR-23 Expressions in Cardiomyocyte
Previous studies have shown that the isoflurane treatments could modulate miRNAs expressions in cardiomyocyte [ ], suggesting that miRNAs might regulate the effects of isoflurane on heart. We started to measure the expressions of multiple miRNAs in response to isoflurane treatments in rat cardiomyoblast cell line, H9c2. Our results demonstrated that miR-18a, miR-23 and miR-24 were significantly downregulated and miR-27, miR-99a and miR-29b were significantly upregulated by isoflurane (Fig. 1 a). It has been reported that miR-23 involves in the oxidative stress in brain [ ] and eye disease [ ]. Therefore, we tested the expressions of miR-23 under treatments of gradient concentrations of isoflurane in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes. Consistent with the H9c2 cells, rat cardiomyocytes showed downregulated miR-23 expression under 500, 100 and 200 μM isoflurane exposures (Fig. 1 b). Fig. 1 miR-23 is downregulated in rat cardiomyocytes a MiRNAs expressions were compared in H9c2 cells without or with isoflurane treatments at 100 µM by qRT-PCR. b miR-23 expressions were measured in rat cardiomyocytes with control or isoflurane treatments at 50, 100 or 200 µM. U6 was used as an internal control. Experiments were performed at triplicate. Results are expressed as mean ± SEM. Student’s t test was used for individual comparisons. *: p < 0.05; **: p < 0.01; ***: p < 0.001
Inhibition of miR-23 Protects Cardiomyocyte from Oxidative Stress-Induced Cell Death
It is known that increased oxidative stress contributes to cardiomyocyte dysfunction [ ]. To investigate the roles of miR-23 during the oxidative stress-induced cardiomyocyte death, we transfected anti-miR-23 into H9c2 cells and cardiomyocytes to inhibit the endogenous miR-23 expression (Fig. 2 a). We observed inhibition of miR-23 significantly protected H9c2 cells and cardiomyocytes from H 2 O 2 -induced cell death (Fig. 2 b). The IC50 of H 2 O 2 in H9c2 control anti-miRNAs transfection cells was 63.2 µM, which is much lower than that of the anti-miR-23-transfected cells, 116.3 µM. Similarly, the IC50 of H 2 O 2 in control cardiomyocytes was lower than miR-23-transfected cells. In addition, cell death induced by exposure of H 2 O 2 in cardiomyocyte demonstrated less morphological changes and decreased caspase-3 activity in anti-miR-23-transfected cells (Fig. 2 c, d). Furthermore, we found obvious numbers of TUNEL-positive cells in control rat cardiomyocytes under H 2 O 2 treatment. In contrast, cells with anti-miR-23 transfection displayed little TUNEL-positive staining under H 2 O 2 treatment (Fig. 2 e, f). Taken together, these results demonstrated inhibiting miR-23 protects H 2 O 2 -induced cardiomyocyte death through suppression of apoptosis pathway. Fig. 2 Inhibition of miR-23 protects cardiomyocyte against oxidative stress-induced cell death a Anti-miR-23 or control antisense miRNA was transfected into H9c2 (left) and rat cardiomyocytes (right) for 48 h, followed by the detection of miR-23 by qRT-PCR. b Anti-miR-23 or control antisense miRNA was transfected into H9c2 (left) and rat cardiomyocytes (right) for 48 h. Cells were treated with H 2 O 2 at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90 or 120 µM for 2 h, and then cells were cultured with fresh medium for 24 h. Cell viability was measured by MTT assay. c Rat cardiomyocytes were transfected with control antisense or anti-miR-23 for 48 h, and then cells were treated with or without H 2 O 2 . Morphological changes between control or anti-miR-23-transfected cells were compared using microscope. d Anti-miR-23 or control antisense miRNA was transfected into rat cardiomyocytes for 48 h. Cells were treated with H 2 O 2 at 0, 30, 60 or 90 µM for 2 h, and then cells were cultured with fresh medium for 24 h. Caspase-3 activity was compared between control and anti-miR-23-transfected cells. Experiments were performed at triplicate. e Rat cardiomyocytes with or without anti-miR-23 transfection were treated with H 2 O 2 at 0 or 60 µM for 2 h, and then cells were cultured with fresh medium for 24 h.

Induction of ROS by miR-23 Through Suppression of GSH
Our above results revealed the protection effects of miR-23 inhibition in cardiomyocyte; we next explored the mechanisms for the miR-23-mediated cardiomyocyte H 2 O 2 sensitivity. The miR-23 mimic was transfected into H9c2 and cardiomyocytes to overexpress miR-23 (Fig. 3 a). As we expected, the ROS levels in H9c2 cells and cardiomyocytes were significantly induced by miR-23 (Fig. 3 b), suggesting the miR-23-mediated oxidative stress sensitivity might occur through the increased ROS. To investigate the targets of miR-23, we detected the ratio of reduced glutathione (GSH) to oxidized glutathione (GSSG) in miR-23 overexpressing H9c2 cells and cardiomyocytes. Consistently, we observed that GSH/GSSG ratio was suppressed by overexpression of miR-23 in both H9c2 cells and primary cardiomyocytes (Fig. 3 c), suggesting that miR-23 induces the ROS level through inhibition of the reduced glutathione. Fig. 3 Overexpression of miR-23 induces ROS and suppresses GSH a miR-23 mimic or control mimic miRNA was transfected into H9c2 (left) and rat cardiomyocytes (right) for 48 h, followed by the detection of miR-23 by qRT-PCR. b miR-23 mimic or control mimic miRNA was transfected into H9c2 (upper) and rat cardiomyocytes (lower) for 48 h, followed by the detection of ROS and c the intracellular GSH/GSSG ratio. Experiments were performed in triplicate. Results are expressed as mean ± SEM. Student’s t test was used for individual comparisons. **: p < 0.01; ***: p < 0.001
Overexpression of miR-23 Sensitizes Cardiomyocyte to H2O2 Through Inhibition of GSH
Consistent with the above results in Fig. 2 b, we observed overexpression of miR-23-sensitized cardiomyocyte to H 2 O 2 (Fig. 4 a). To investigate whether the miR-23-mediated cardiomyocyte sensitization to H 2 O 2 was through the inhibition of GSH, we treated cardiomyocytes with GSH solution in miR-23 overexpressing cells (Fig. 4 b). As we expected, restoration of GSH in miR-23 overexpressing cells protected cardiomyocyte from the H 2 O 2 -induced cell death (Fig. 4 c). Fig. 4 Restoration of GSH abolishes the miR-23-promoted sensitivity to H 2 O 2 a Rat cardiomyocytes were transfected with control mimic or miR-23 mimic for 48 h. Cells were treated with H 2 O 2 at 0, 10, 20, 30, 40 or 50 µM for 2 h, and then cells were cultured with fresh medium for 24 h. Cell viabilities were measured by MTT assay. b Rat cardiomyocytes were transfected with miR-23 mimic alone or with miR-23 mimic plus soluble GSH treatments for 48 h. The amount of GSH was detected. c Rat cardiomyocytes were transfected with miR-23 mimic alone or with miR-23 mimic plus GSH treatments for 48 h. Cells were treated with H 2 O 2 at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90 or 120 µM for 2 h, and then cells were cultured with fresh medium for 24 h. Cell viabilities were measured by MTT assay. Experiments were performed in triplicate. Results are expressed as mean ± SEM. Student’s t test was used for individual comparisons. *: p < 0.05; **: p < 0.01; ***: p < 0.001
Isoflurane Protects Cardiomyocyte from Oxidative Stress Through Inhibition of miR-23
Our above results demonstrated the correlation between isoflurane treatments and endogenous miR-23 expression: Isoflurane treatments suppressed endogenous miR-23 expression in H9c2 cells and primary cardiomyocyte (Fig. 1 a, b). Moreover, we showed overexpression of miR-23-induced ROS, resulting in cardiomyocyte sensitized to oxidative stress (Fig. 3 b). It is known that isoflurane exposure could protect cardiomyocyte by reducing myocardial infarct size following ischemia reperfusion injury [ ]. Therefore, we investigated whether miR-23 directly participated in the protective effects of isoflurane on cardiomyocyte. We tested whether isoflurane protects the cardiomyocyte from oxidative stress-induced cell death. Treatments with isoflurane significantly suppressed cell death under oxidative stress (Fig. 5 a). In the meanwhile, isoflurane suppressed endogenous miR-23 expression under oxidative stress (Fig. 5 b), indicating that isoflurane might protect cardiomyocyte from oxidative stress-induced cell death through inhibition of miR-23. To verify this, we measured the cell viability of miR-23-transfected or un-transfected cardiomyocytes with isoflurane treatment under oxidative stress. Interestingly, our data showed that overexpression of miR-23 contradicted the protected effects of isoflurane on cardiomyocyte under oxidative stress (Fig. 5 c), suggesting that miR-23 is an important regulator in the isoflurane-mediated protection of cardiomyocyte. Fig. 5 Isoflurane protects cardiomyocyte through suppression of miR-23 a Rat cardiomyocytes were exposed under isoflurane and treated with H 2 O 2 at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90 or 120 µM for 2 h, and then cells were cultured with fresh medium for 24 h. Cell viabilities were measured by MTT assay. b Rat cardiomyocytes were exposed under isoflurane and treated with H 2 O 2 at 0, 10, 20, 30, 40 or 50 µM for 2 h, and then cells were cultured with fresh medium for 24 h. miR-23 expressions were measured by qRT-PCR. U6 was used as an internal control. c Rat cardiomyocytes with or without miR-23 overexpression were exposed under isoflurane and treated with H 2 O 2 at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90 or 120 µM for 2 h, and then cells were cultured with fresh medium for 24 h. Cell viabilities were measured by MTT assay. Experiments were performed in triplicate. Results are expressed as mean ± SEM. Student’s t test was used for individual comparisons. *: p < 0.05; **: p < 0.01; ***: p < 0.001
Discussion
In this study, we investigated the roles of miR-23 during the isoflurane exposure to cardiomyocyte. It has been known that miRNAs are important regulators in isoflurane-mediated cardiomyocyte protection [ ]. Recently, roles of miR-21 during the isoflurane exposure have been investigated by two research groups [ , ]. miR-21 was induced by isoflurane in both in vivo and in vitro rat models, which mediates protection to cardiomyocyte [ ]. Moreover, isoflurane application during ischemia can reduce ischemic cardiomyocyte injury [ ]. Our results showed that miR-23 is suppressed by isoflurane exposure, suggesting that inhibition of miR-23 might contribute to therapeutic application.
Volatile anesthetics including isoflurane have a long history in the clinical management of anesthesia. Amounting evidence demonstrates that volatile anesthetics protect the myocardium when applied before ischemic events. The mechanisms underlying the protective effects of volatile anesthetics are involved in the activation of extracellular regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), phosphoinositide 3-kinase, mitochondrial KATP channels and endothelial ROS (eNOS) [ ]. However, the precise molecular mechanism responsible for isoflurane-mediated cardioprotection remains undefined.
Recently, studies have reported that increased oxidative stress contributes to cardiomyocyte dysfunction [ , ]. In addition, the effects of volatile anesthetics such as isoflurane and sevoflurane on oxidative stress and inflammation have been reviewed [ ]. We observed inhibition of miR-23 renders cardiomyocyte resistant to oxidative stress, intriguing us to explore whether miR-23 involves in the isoflurane-mediated cardiomyocyte protection under oxidative stress. Inhibition of miR-23 rendered cardiomyocyte resistant to H 2 O 2 ; in the meanwhile, overexpression of miR-23 sensitized cardiomyocyte to H 2 O 2 , suggesting that miR-23 might target antioxidant pathway in cardiomyocyte. Subsequently, we demonstrated that miR-23 could suppress production of GSH, which is an important antioxidant against oxidative stress [ ], indicating that overexpression of miR-23 could induce cardiomyocyte through inhibiting the antioxidant pathway. However, the precise mechanisms have not been completely elucidated. Therefore, it is important to delineate underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms contributing to heart muscle cell (cardiomyocyte) injury following ischemia–reperfusion (I/R).
The mechanism for the protective functions by exposure to volatile anesthetics such as isoflurane has not been fully understood. It has been reported that anesthetic preconditioning is an effective strategy to reduce myocardial injury through inhibition of mitochondrial apoptosis pathway [ ], providing a putative mechanism for the isoflurane-mediated cardioprotection. In addition, one study reported that isoflurane preconditioning contributes to cardioprotection through activation of the ALDH2-mitochondrial PKCε pathway [ ]. Moreover, it has been known that volatile anesthetics protect cardiac tissues through manipulation of the potassium ATP (KATP) channel, mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and activation of Akt and extracellular signal kinases (ERK) pathways [ ]. In this study, we checked caspase-3 activity (Fig. 2 d), which indicated that inhibiting miR-23 protects H 2 O 2 -induced cardiomyocyte death through suppression of apoptosis pathway. Moreover, multiple studies reported H 2 O 2 /other oxidative stress-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis [ , , ]. Taken together, our data demonstrated that isoflurane regulates the H 2 O 2 -induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis pathway through suppression of miR-23.
This study demonstrated an isoflurane-miR-23-GSH axis which describes a putative mechanism for the protection of cardiomyocyte against oxidative stress. One study reported that isoflurane differentially modulates mitochondrial ROS levels which mediate the effects of anesthetic precondition to protect against ischemia and reperfusion injury [ ]. In addition, miR-23 can be induced by oxidative stress [ ] and our results described overexpression of miR-23 could induce ROS generation. We demonstrated that cardiomyocyte with isoflurane exposure was resistant to H 2 O 2 treatment in vitro, suggesting a correlation between the isoflurane-inhibited miR-23 and H 2 O 2 sensitivity. Moreover, with isoflurane exposure, overexpression of miR-23 rendered cardiomyocyte sensitive to H 2 O 2 , supporting the above results that the isoflurane-mediated protection of cardiomyocyte under oxidative stress was through inhibition of miR-23. However, our study limits to in vitro and ex vivo results, which may not reflect the in vivo condition. We are currently establishing a rat anesthetic drug inhalation model. In future study, we will focus on the roles of miRNAs on cardioprotection using animal model.
Conclusion
In summary, this study provides an aspect for the miRNAs-modulated cardiomyocytes sensitivity to oxidative stress, contributing to the development of clinical therapeutic agents.
