Introduction
Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common female pelvic malignancy and the fourth most common cancer in women after breast, colon, and lung cancers with more than 40,000 cases in the USA diagnosed annually. The majority of patients are diagnosed with stage I or II disease, giving better prognosis, with 5-year survival rate of 84%. Patients who are diagnosed with advanced-stage disease (III or IV) have a poor prognosis, with 5-year survival rates of approximately 40% [ ]. There are many factors influencing the prognosis of EC, which are mainly associated with the FIGO stage, histology type, and myometrial invasion and lymphovascular invasion. Women with papillary serous or clear cell histology are at high risk of distant spread and recurrence of the disease, even in early-stage and absence of myometrial invasion [ ].
Most endometrial cancers arise following progression of histologically distinguishable hyperplastic lesions. In fact, endometrial hyperplasia is the only known direct precursor of invasive disease [ ]. Only atypical endometrial hyperplasia is clearly associated with the subsequent development of adenocarcinoma [ ]. It must be taken into account a baseline rate 42.6% of EC among women who have a diagnosis of atypical endometrial hyperplasia as found by Trimble et al. [ ]. Because of the risk of concomitant endometrial carcinoma in women with atypical endometrial hyperplasia, women should be carefully evaluated for the possibility of more advanced disease prior to surgery [ , ]. As mentioned earlier, 30–40% of EC diagnosed in advanced stages, with certain high-risk groups, e.g., Lynch syndrome, Cowden syndrome, breast cancer patients on tamoxifen, would benefit from the use of a reliable noninvasive serum marker to aid early diagnosis. These noninvasive means for detection of EC may improve diagnosis, detection of recurrence, and monitoring the response to therapy. It might provide preoperative prognostic value to help guide the extent of surgical staging needed [ , ].
Similar to the value of CA125 tumor marker employed in ovarian cancer, a marker for endometrial cancer that is useful in the early detection of recurrent disease or for the evaluation of response to treatment is critical [ ]. CA125 has been reported to be elevated in 19–40% of EC patients [ ]. But there is no defined prognostic cutoff value for it in EC [ ]. HE4 has been considered to be a promising biomarker for EC. HE4 revealed an elevated diagnostic power with a sensibility of 78% and a specificity of 100% [ , ]. The encouraging results are insufficient to accept this oncological biomarker in the common clinical practice. It is important to find a new valuable serum tumor marker for EC in improving early diagnostic rate and decreasing mortality.
YKL-40, also known as human cartilage glycoprotein 39 or chitinase-3-like-1, is a member of “mammalian chitinase-like proteins” [ ]. The gene for YKL-40 (CHI3L1) is located on chromosome 1q31–1q32 [ ]. This protein does not have the chitinase activity (hydrolytic enzymes that break down glycosidic bonds in chitin which is a component of the cell walls) because of the mutation of a glutamic acid to leucine in the chitinase-3-like catalytic domain [ ]. Several lines of evidence support that YKL-40 is expressed by some types of malignant cells, such as breast, lung, ovary, uterine, and kidney tumor cells. YKL-40 is also expressed by benign cells, such as myelocyte–metamyelocyte of normal bone marrow [ ] and macrophages during late stages of differentiation [ ] and differentiated vascular smooth muscle cells [ ]. The exact function of YKL-40 is yet to be determined.
Recent studies showed that serum YKL-40 may be a useful marker with diagnostic and prognostic value in cancer. Elevations of serum YKL-40 are correlated with the clinical outcome of gastric cancer [ ], glioblastoma [ ], breast cancer [ ], and small cell lung cancer [ ]. Plasma YKL-40 level is related to the prognosis of ovarian cancer, and its elevation is associated with a shorter survival [ ]. The role of YKL-40 and its contribution to carcinogenesis have not been well delineated to date, but it has been suggested that YKL-40 may play a role in extracellular matrix degradation, stimulation of angiogenesis, and cellular survival. In vivo, YKL-40 is expressed and secreted by activated neutrophils and macrophages and is increased in conditions of inflammation, suggesting that YKL-40 may play a role in tissue remodeling, contributing to cancer growth and metastasis [ , ].
Since endometrial cancer shares histological subtypes and common risk factors with ovarian and breast cancer, these pathological similarities suggest that YKL-40 may have a potential role in endometrial cancer. In fact, it has been shown that a high serum level of YKL-40 has a diagnostic and prognostic role in endometrial cancer in some recent studies [ , , ]. However, the role of YKL-40 protein levels in predicting and diagnosing endometrial hyperplasia and tumorigenesis has to be more investigated.
In the study, we evaluated the diagnostic potential of serum YKL-40. We examined the frequency of its serum elevation in patients with postmenopausal bleeding and thickened endometrium for its possible use in assessment of endometrial pathologies as atypical hyperplasia and malignancy.
Materials and Methods
The study was conducted on 93 women: 62 of them were admitted to El Shatby Maternity University Hospital, Gyne-Oncology specialized unit and 31 were normal control who agreed to participate in the study voluntarily. According to this, the groups of our study were categorized as follows:
Group (I) included 62 women undergoing hysterectomy after being diagnosed with either atypical endometrial hyperplasia or endometrial cancer. Group (A), 31 women with endometrial atypical hyperplasia. Group (B), 31 women with endometrial cancer.
Group (II) The control group included 31 healthy postmenopausal non-complaining volunteers, physically examined and investigated postmenstrual by trans-vaginal ultrasound to ensure endometrial thickness is within normal range (< 5 mm), free from any gynecological disease and no prior history of arthritis, hepatic fibrosis, osteoarthritis, or any other medical conditions.
The study was approved by the National Ethics Committee of the Egyptian Ministry of Health and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonisation Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. Informed consent was obtained from all eligible women before starting the study.
After approval of local ethics committee, a written informed consent was obtained from each patient and selected patients were subjected to:
Full history taking thorough clinical examination includes general, abdominal, pelvic examination, and BMI estimation. Routine preoperative work-up including, e.g., full blood count, liver functions, renal functions, fasting blood sugar, coagulation profile, was done. Trans-vaginal ultrasound scanning to assess uterine size, endometrial thickness and morphology was done. CT abdomen and pelvis (for cancer group B) was done. Total Abdominal Hysterectomy with Bilateral Salpingo-Oophorectomy was done to study group (group A) ± lymphadenectomy (group B). All specimens had histopathological examination as usual.
Serum samples were collected before surgery, allowed to clot for 10–20 min at room temperature. They were centrifuged at 2000–3000 RPM for 20 min and collected samples were stored at − 80 °C. Determination of serum YKL-40 level is done by using Human Chitinase-3-like protein 1 ELISA kit (Bioassay technology laboratory, China). The assay principle according to the manufacturer’s protocol: YKL-40/CHI3L1 is added to the well pre-coated with YKL-40/CHI3L1 monoclonal antibodies. After incubation, a biotin-conjugated antihuman YKL-40/CHI3L1 antibody is added and binds to human YKL-40/CHI3L1. After incubation, unbound biotin-conjugated antihuman YKL-40/CHI3L1 antibody is washed away during a washing step. Streptavidin-HRP is added and binds to the biotin-conjugated antihuman YKL-40/CHI3L1 antibody. After incubation, unbound streptavidin-HRP is washed away during a washing step. Substrate solution is then added, and color develops in proportion to the amount of human YKL-40/CHI3L1. The reaction is terminated by addition of acidic stop solution, and absorbance is measured at 450 nm using the Bio-Rad Benchmark Microplate Reader.
Statistical Analysis
Data were fed to the computer and analyzed using IBM SPSS software package version 20.0. (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp). Qualitative data were described using number and percent. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was used to verify the normality of distribution. Quantitative data were described using range (minimum and maximum), mean, standard deviation, and median. Significance of the obtained results was judged at the 5% level. The used tests were Chi-square test, Fisher’s Exact or Monte Carlo correction (correction for Chi-square when more than 20% of the cells have expected count less than 5); F-test (ANOVA) and post hoc test (LSD) for pairwise comparisons; Mann–Whitney test for abnormally distributed quantitative variables to compare between two studied groups; Kruskal–Wallis test for abnormally distributed quantitative variables to compare between more than two studied groups; and post hoc (Dunn’s multiple comparisons test) for pairwise comparisons.
Results
In our study, we compared the three studied groups according to demographic data. There was no statistical significant difference between the three studied groups according to age, gravidity, and duration of menopause, while there was a statistical significant difference between them regarding BMI ( P < 0.05). BMI in group IA ranged from 27 to 46 with mean value 33.90 ± 5.51, in group IB ranged from 25 to 40 with mean value 34.77 ± 3.90 and in control group ranged from 22 to 36 with mean value 31.39 ± 4.31.
Comparison between the three studied groups according to medical history showed a statistical significant difference between the three studied groups according to medical history of diabetes. Diabetes in group IA was present in 13 (41.9%) cases, 19 (61.3%) cases in group IB, and 5 cases (16.1%) in control group. This was reflected as a statistical significant difference between the three studied groups regarding serum glucose level ( P < 0.05). Glucose at group IA ranged from 78 to 400 mg/dl with mean value 145.94 ± 77.07, at group IB ranged from 56 to 331 mg/dl with mean value 146.84 ± 70.26, and at control group ranged from 71 to 140 mg/dl with mean value 93.45 ± 17.28. There was no statistical significant difference between them regarding medical history of hypertension and anemia.
Endometrial thickness at group IA ranged from 5 to 25 mm with mean value 13.58 ± 5.54 and at group IB ranged from 5.80 to 30 mm with mean value 20.38 ± 7.38 mm. Both are much higher than the control group (ranging from 0.5 to 3.5 mm with mean value 1.24 ± 0.82). There was a statistical significant difference between the three studied groups according to endometrial thickness by ultrasound ( P < 0.001).
There was no statistical significant difference between the three studied groups regarding full blood count, kidney function, while there was a statistical significant difference regarding liver functions of AST and ALT and albumin. This significance could not reach a sufficient level of confidence as a predictor or risk factors for EC. It may be attributed to the prevalence of fatty liver in obese cancer patients. Further multicenter studies with larger sample size may be important to detect these parameters and other confounding factors.
Frequency of histopathological types of endometrial cancer, grade, and stage in group IB is shown in Table 1 .

There was a statistical significant relation between the three studied groups according to serum YKL-40 level ( P < 0.05), with its level being statistically higher in cancer group compared to atypical hyperplasia cases and control group. Again, the level was higher in atypical hyperplasia compared to the control, as seen in Table 2 and Fig. 1 .

There was a statistical significant correlation between histopathological type and serum YKL-40 level in group IB ( P > 0.005). YKL-40 level was statistically significantly higher in papillary serous endometrial cancer compared to endometrioid endometrial carcinoma, as in Table 3 .

There was a statistical significant correlation between tumor grade and serum YKL-40 level. The levels were statistically significantly higher with higher grade tumor, as in Table 4 .

There was a statistical significant difference in level of serum YKL-40 in different cancer stages, being higher in advanced-stage disease compared to stage I, as in Table 5 . Three risk categories for EC are identified: low risk: stage IA (G1 and G2) with endometrioid type; intermediate risk: stage IA G3 with endometrioid type and stage IB (G1 and G2) with endometrioid type; and high risk: stage IB G3 with endometrioid types and all stages with non-endometrioid type. There was a statistical significant difference between the three risk groups according to serum YKL-40 level ( P < 0.05). YKL-40 level was statistically higher in high-risk group, compared to intermediate-risk and low-risk patients, as in Table 6 .

Discussion
In our study, the statistical significant difference between the three studied groups regarding BMI was in concordance to Kemik et al. [ ] who found that BMI was significantly higher in the study group (50 patients, diagnosed with endometrial cancer) than the control group (50 volunteers who had a normal endometrial histology proven by biopsy). The mean and median of gravidity and parity which are known as protective factors from endometrial cancer were generally higher in the control group.
In the present study, the statistical significant difference between the three studied groups according to diabetes was expected in obese cancer patients. This contradicted Kemik et al. [ ] who found no statistical significant difference between study and control groups regarding medical history of diabetes. Higher levels of glucose levels seen with the atypical hyperplasia and cancer patients compared to control cases made a statistical significant difference between the three studied groups, and it was due to impaired glucose tolerance observed in group I caused by diabetes and obesity.
Endometrioid adenocarcinoma was the prevalent type in our cancer patients included in the study, present in 28 (90.3%) of them, while papillary serous adenocarcinoma was present in 3 patients (9.7%) only. According to risk assessment, 21 patients (67.7%) were at low risk, 4 (12.9%) were intermediate, and 6 (19.4%) were at high risk. The myometrium was invaded in 14 patients of group IB (45.2%).
Considering serum YKL-40 level, there was a statistical significant difference between the three studied groups, being higher in group IB than in group IA and group II ( P < 0.001*). In agreement with our study, Kemik et al. [ ], Diefenbach et al. [ ], Kotowicz et al. [ ], and Cheng et al. [ ] found that preoperative YKL-40 levels in the endometrial cancer patients were significantly higher than the normal controls.
Studied YKL-40 results relation to histopathological type showed a statistical significant difference between histopathological type and serum YKL-40 level in group IB. The mean YKL-40 level in papillary serous adenocarcinoma patients was 249.45 ± 22.12 compared to 90.51 ± 88.77 mean value in endometrioid adenocarcinoma patients. However, the significance here may be due to small number of cases in papillary serous type in our study.
This observation contradicted results seen with Diefenbach et al. [ ] and Liao et al. [ ] who found no statistical significant association between YKL-40 elevation and tumor histology, but was in concordance to Kemik et al. [ ] study which showed significant higher preoperative serum levels of YKL-40 in non-endometrioid-type cancer patients than the endometrioid type ones.
There was a statistical significant difference between YKL-40 result and tumor clinic-pathological features of stage and FIGO grade. The mean serum level of the YKL-40 was about 3 times higher in stage III than in stage I ( P = 0.006*) and highest levels were reached in grade III ( P = 0.004*) compared to grade I and II results. However, a drop in serum marker levels was noted in grade II which is most probably caused by the largest number of cases presented in this grade with subsequent wider range of serum marker levels collected.
Our results were in agreement with Peng et al. [ ] and Liao et al. [ ]. However, these findings contradicted Kemik et al. [ ], Diefenbach et al. [ ] and Fan et al. [ ] who found no statistical significant association between YKL-40 elevation and tumor stage and grade.
YKL-40 result when was correlated with the risk groups, there was a statistical significant difference between the three risk groups being highest in high-risk group than intermediate-risk group and higher than low-risk group ( P < 0.001*).
In our study, the cutoff point used for YKL-40 as a concentration threshold to discriminate between patients with atypical hyperplasia and healthy controls was above > 35 ng/mL (sensitivity 77.42%; specificity 83.87; 95% CI 0.745–0.952; P < 0.001*) and was above 39.2 ng/mL (sensitivity 80.65%; specificity 90.32%; 95% CI 0.839–0.992; P < 0.001*) for discrimination between patients with endometrial carcinoma and healthy control. However, determined YKL-40 concentration cutoff point of above > 35.43 ng/mL (sensitivity 90.32%; specificity 83.87%; 95% CI 0.839–0.992; P < 0.001*) was able to accurately differentiate between healthy individuals and cancer patients in the early stages of the disease. Importantly, we demonstrated that the increase in YKL-40 marker was already present in patients with low FIGO stages IA and IB, indicating their potential usefulness as early diagnostic markers for EC. Unfortunately, the obtained YKL-40 results of atypical endometrial hyperplasia patients were fluctuating minimally around cutoff level which means that this marker did not exhibit the same usefulness for the precancerous condition of endometrial atypical hyperplasia included in our study.
Similarly, Kotowicz et al. [ ] determined a cutoff point for YKL-40 as above 39.1 ng/mL (sensitivity 62.2%; specificity 88%; 95% CI 0.726–0.900; P < 0.0001*) to discriminate between patients with endometrial cancer and healthy controls and a cutoff point of above 35.5 ng/mL (sensitivity 68.9%; specificity 80%; 95% CI 0.702–0.907; P < 0.0001) to differentiate between healthy individuals and patients in the early stages of the disease. These results determined the concentration of YKL-40 that can be used to accurately differentiate between endometrial cancer patients and healthy controls for the entire group of patients as well as for those in low stages of the disease.
Diefenbach et al. [ ] found that elevation in preoperative serum YKL-40 levels (> 61 ng/mL) reliably differentiated endometrial cancer from normal. At the established upper limit of normal value of 61 ng/mL, YKL-40 has a sensitivity of 76% and a specificity of 89% for the detection of endometrial cancer in this small study.
Liao et al. [ ] in a study conducted on 34 patients found that at the value of 106.6 µg/L, which was defined as the normal value, serum YKL-40 has a sensitivity of 73.5%, a specificity of 81.6%, positive predictive value of 69.4%, a negative predictive value of 84.4%, and a false negative rate of 26.5% for the diagnosis of EC. Regarding the pre- and postoperative serum YKL-40 values, there was a significant difference between serum YKL-40 values before and 7 days after surgery for 22 EC patients, which is 165.12 ± 96.9 and 120.91 ± 92.77 µg/L, respectively. In addition, the relationship between serum YKL-40 level and the prognosis of EC patients demonstrated that significantly poorer survival for EC patients with serum YKL-40 levels = or > 106.6 µg/L compared with patients with serum YKL-40 levels < 106.6 µg/L.
Cheng et al. [ ] results indicated that the pooled sensitivity and pooled specificity of YKL-40 were 0.74 and 0.87 for diagnosis of EC. This means that 74% of the EC patients had elevated levels of YKL-40, and 87% of non-EC patients have decreased levels of serum YKL-40. Although the sensitivity is compromised, YKL-40 has a good specificity. The mean DOR was 19.14, which means that YKL-40 could be a useful biomarker in diagnosing EC.
Peng et al. [ ] investigated the immunoreactivity of YKL-40 in normal, hyperplastic, and neoplastic endometrium and concluded that EC showed the strongest immunoreactivity for YKL-40 compared with endometrial hyperplasia and normal endometrium. He also found that tumors that were highly immunoreactive for YKL-40 were associated with several aggressive clinical variables, including advanced stage, poor differentiation, lymph node metastasis, and lymphovascular invasion and were also significantly associated with poor prognosis in endometrial cancer.
Fan et al. [ ] also showed that serum YKL-40 may represent some worse biologic characteristics of EC patients so that YKL-40 could be effective in diagnosis and follow-up of endometrial cancer. The authors pointed out the discordance in YKL-40 patient’s serum concentrations and its tissue expression, indicating that the elevated serum levels of YKL-40 in endometrial cancer patients might not be directly related to its tumor expression.
Several studies demonstrated the clinical usefulness of YKL-40 using different cutoff points in comparison with CA125 and found that YKL-40 has a higher sensitivity than CA 125 in diagnosing EC even in earlier stages, so in this respect it might be clinically more useful [ , , ]. Preoperative serum YKL-40 elevation does not only appear to be a tool for risk stratification of newly diagnosed endometrial cancer patients, but also have a role in the long-term monitoring of patients for the detection of relapse [ , ].
In summary, despite the limitation mentioned above, the meta-analysis provides evidence that circulating YKL-40 may be a valuable tumor marker in the diagnosis of EC. Elevated preoperative serum YKL-40 level is related to tumor histopathology, FIGO stage, and tumor grade. Due to the small sample size of this study of both study and control groups, larger prospective studies are still needed to investigate the exact function of YKL-40 protein in endometrial cancer. In the future, large-scale and well-designed studies should be performed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of YKL-40 and determine whether it could provide additional value beyond that of other widely used biomarkers.
