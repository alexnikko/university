Introduction
Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a widely prevalent sexually transmitted virus [ , ]. Although the majority of infection are benign and transient, persistent infection is associated with the development of cervical and other anogenital cancers [ , ]. In India, about 1,00,000 women develop cervical cancer each year [ ]. HPV infection is typically asymptomatic to begin with [ ]. The transmission occurs prior to any clinically detected expression of the virus. HPV infects basal cells of the epithelium [ ]. The virus assembles in the nucleus and is subsequently shed from keratocytes. There is proliferation of all epithelial layers, except the basal. The virus has an incubation period of 3–4 months [ ]. It clinically manifests as hyperplastic, hyperkeratotic warts or dysplastic lesions that may undergo neoplastic transformation [ ]. Based on the epidemiological classification of HPV types by Munoz et al. [ ], the high-risk types are 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 68, 73 and 82 and low-risk types are 6, 11, 40, 42, 43, 44, 54, 61, 70, 72, 81 and CP 6108.
It is now universally accepted that nearly all the invasive cervical cancers and high-risk intraepithelial neoplasias are associated with high-risk HPV types (HR-HPV). Owing to the strong association, it has been suggested that high-risk HPV detection might be used as a tool to identify women at risk for the subsequent development of cervical cancer. Guidelines need to be formulated for HPV testing in cervical cancer screening and for vaccination. With this aim, we undertook the present study, to estimate the prevalence of high-risk HPV using highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
Materials and Methods
Patients and Cervical Smear
Papanicolaou (Pap) smear cell samples were obtained randomly from new patients attending the gynecology outpatient clinic of SMGS Hospital, Government Medical College, Jammu, for varied complaints. Pregnant women and women with a history of hysterectomy or conization were excluded. Relevant data, viz. age, parity, chief complaints, clinical diagnosis and examination findings, were recorded on a pro forma.
Since it was a 1-year time-bound hospital-based study, the calculation of sample size as in a field study was not done. It was predecided that on OPD day (once a week—Monday) every 20th patient satisfying the inclusion criteria would be included in the study. Also, every fifth Sunday used to be the OPD of the candidate. The daily OPD attendance used to be around 100. Hence, on an average, five patients per OPD were selected and, during 1-year (52 + 11) OPD days, 300 patients would be included in the study.
Cervical exfoliated cells were collected for Pap smear and sent to Pathology Department, Government Medical College, Jammu, for papanicolaou staining and cytology. Pap smear reporting was done according to Bethesda system of classification—2001.
For HPV DNA testing, cervical exfoliated cells were collected by endocervical brush in tubes and were transported under strict aseptic condition to Molecular Cytogenetic Laboratory of the Human Genetic Research cum Counseling Centre, Jammu University, for further processing. Since PCR was the only method available in Jammu University for HPV DNA detection, it was used for the same purpose.
DNA was isolated using phenol chloroform method (organic method). The quantity of DNA was estimated spectrophotometrically. PCR for β-actin gene was also performed for each sample, as an internal control. The DNA samples which did not show PCR product with the same were excluded.
PCR for HPV
PCR was performed on extracted DNA using primer for consensus sequence. The electrophoresis of the amplified product was done in 1.5 % agarose gel. The gel was stained with ethidium bromide, to visualize the amplified PCR product. A 526–594 base pair (BP) band was visualized in the positive samples for HPV on a UV transilluminator.
Type-Specific PCR for HPV 16 and 18
The positive samples were subjected to type-specific PCR for HPV types 16 and 18 using type-specific primer for HPV 16 and HPV 18. The generated fragments were of 109 and 334 bp for HPV 16 and 18, respectively, and were visualized on 2 % agarose gels.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis has been performed using Chi-square test, and Chi-square test for linear trends P valve less than or equal to 0.05 is taken as significant.
Results
Out of the 300 patients enrolled, maximum patients were in the age group of 30–40 years (57 %). In total, 113 (37.6 %) women tested positive for HPV DNA by PCR, using consensus primers. Twenty-three (7.66 %) of the entire sample tested positive for high-risk HPV types (16 + 18). HPV 16 was present in 5 (1.66 %) (Fig. 1 ), and HPV 18 was present in 18 (6 %) women (Fig. 2 ).

The various complaints with which patients presented to OPD were vaginal discharge (25.33 %), pain lower abdomen (21.33 %), intermenstrual bleeding (6.33 %), postmenopausal bleeding (6 %), postcoital bleeding (1.7 %), warts (0.33 %), and 39 % patients presented with none of these complaints. The prevalence of HPV DNA according to age, socioeconomic status, literacy and residence is given in Table 1 . Table 2 shows HPV-positive women in relation to cervical cytology.

Discussion
HPV infection is recognized as a public health problem for its role as a critical factor in pathogenesis of various cancers. Cervical cancer is a preventable disease [ ]. It develops the following progression of uncleared HPV infection to high grade and eventually to invasive disease [ ]. Women with normal cervical cytology, who are infected with high-risk HPV, have an approximately 100-fold increased risk of developing CIN 3, compared with uninfected women. With the advent of molecular techniques, particularly PCR, it is possible to detect very low quantities of HPV and to subtype the commonly occurring HPV in cervical scrape smears. The cytological features for HPV on Pap smear are non-specific.
The conventional Pap smear has restricted value in identifying women, destined to develop cervical neoplasia [ ]. The atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance—low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion triage study (ALTS) aimed at resolving the issue of management of low-grade cervical lesions. They concluded that women with less than cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 (CIN 2) status at initial colposcopy remain at risk for the subsequent development of CIN 2/CIN 3. Follow-up HPV testing is significantly more sensitive than cytology ( P = 0.015) for detecting missed prevalent cases. In the same study, few cases of CIN 3 had a negative HPV test, reinforcing that even the most sensitive test cannot provide perfect assurance. Thus, HPV testing should be used as an adjunct to Pap smears [ ]. There are ample data on prevalence of HPV in women with cervical cancer; however, data on HPV prevalence in women with clinically normal cervix from India are sparse. The prevalence of HPV using consensus primers for HPV DNA among women in the index study was 37.66 %. High-risk HPV types 16 and 18 were detected in 7.66 % of the entire sample. The prevalence of HPV 16/18 in the index study is consistent with that reported by Duttagupta et al. [ ] and Aggarwal et al. [ ].
Women who were illiterate or had less than 6 years of education had a significantly higher rate of HPV infection ( P = 0.02) in the index study. HPV was more common in rural than in the urban women, and the difference was statistically significant ( P = 0.02). Women belonging to low socioeconomic status had a higher prevalence of HPV infection than those from medium or high socioeconomic group, and the difference was statistically significant ( P = 0.007). Franceschi et al. [ ] has recognized low socioeconomic status as a risk factor for cervical carcinoma as well.
More number of women (45.45 %) with four or more children tested positive for HPV as compared to those with less than three children (29.77 %). The difference was, however, not statistically significant. Duttagupta et al. [ ] and Lazcano et al. [ ] too did not observe any significant association of HPV infection with parity.
The sociocultural stigma of the conservative Indian society plays an important role in the reporting of promiscuity. Hence, due to the possibility of underestimation of this sensitive parameter, age at first intercourse was not elicited and age at marriage was recorded. HPV prevalence decreases with the increase in age at marriage. But this difference was not statistically significant with P value of 0.08. Aggarwal et al. [ ] and Duttagupta et al. [ ] also reported no significant difference of HPV distribution with age at marriage.
In the index study, two types of high-risk HPV for subtyping have been included, as they are more prevalent in this part of the world (Table 3 ). Types of HPV in primary screening depend on the population being screened, due to the difference in prevalence of HPV types. Clifford et al. [ ] have suggested that cost-effective test could include subset of high-risk HPV, which are most likely to progress to cancer. We observed high-risk HPV DNA in 7.66 % of women. The figure reported is low as compared to previous studies reported from India [ , ] (Table 3 ). But prevalence of HPV 16/18 in the present study is consistent with that reported by Dutta et al. [ ] and Aggarwal et al. [ ]. This can plausibly be attributed to the fact that previous researches have targeted women in the high-risk group, viz. women from rural background or those from low socioeconomic background.

In the index study, it was seen that prevalence of HPV infection increases with increasing grade of abnormality in cervical cytology. It was 18.91 % in women with normal cervical cytology, 31.11 % in women with inflammatory smear, 32.14 % in women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS), 54.16 % in women with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), 77.77 % in women with high-grade squamous intraepithelial (HSIL) and 100 % in women with cancer cervix. This is consistent with Khanna et al. [ ] and Varghese [ ] who also reported that HPV positivity increases with the increase in abnormality in cervical cytology.
In our study prevalence of HPV 16/18 was 1.35 % among controls (women with normal cytology) as compared to 20.63 % among cases (women with LSIL, HSIL and cancer cervix). This is in accordance with Schifman et al. [ ] who concluded that the prevalence of HPV 16/18 was 2.9 % among controls (women with normal cytology) and 33.5 % among cases (women with CIN) in a case–control study from USA.
The limitation of the index study is that, being an hospital-based study, the women enrolled were not truly healthy, as they visited the hospital with varied ailments and thus were not a true representation of the community. In addition, prevalence of high-risk HPV, other than HPV 16/18, was not evaluated.
Conclusions
Cervical cancer screening practices are inconsistent in India. Use of Pap smear, as a sole indicator for screening, has limitations. The cytological interpretation becomes faulty if the smear is inflammatory, situation not infrequent among women from low socioeconomic background. In a scenario of infrequent screening, screening with a test of high sensitivity provides greater reassurance that potential disease has not been missed in women who screened negative. It is an irony that middle and high socioeconomic women, who can afford HPV screening by molecular techniques, require it the least, owing to the low prevalence. High-risk HPV DNA screening appears to be a valid option in mass cervical screening programs in developed countries. In a resource-poor country, it is not feasible to offer universal molecular testing for high-risk HPV, till HPV screening is made cheaper. Identification of population at risk will enable focused screening, with a greater cost-effective utilization of resources. Index study has identified illiterate women and those from rural and low socioeconomic background to be at a greater risk of HPV. Screening can preferentially be directed to the target population for optimal utilization of resources.
