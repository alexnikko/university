Introduction
Cerebral palsy (CP) is a permanent neurological disability that affects movement and posture and has a prevalence in children of approximately 0.2 % worldwide (Jan ; MacLennan et al. ; Nelson and Blair ). The disease is caused by non-progressive brain injury and is often associated with disturbances in communication, sensation, and perception as well as mental retardation and epilepsy (Rosenbaum et al. ). Environmental factors, particularly premature birth, anoxia, and infection, were once thought to be the main cause of cerebral palsy (Nelson and Grether ), but recent studies have demonstrated the importance of genetic factors in the occurrence of the disease. Two large-sample, long-term research studies found familial aggregation of CP, and an analysis of the Swedish national database estimated that genetic contributions were behind approximately 40 % of all cases of CP (Costeff ). Furthermore, data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway suggested a 1.5-fold to 15.6-fold increase in the genetic risk of CP that depends on the relatedness of patients (Tollanes et al. ). The genetic mechanisms underlying CP can be explained by complex genetic effect and a single major gene effect. To date, only nine CP genes have been identified in Mendelian CP families, and these associations suggest that CP might follow a multifactorial inheritance model in which the individual effects of several minor genes influence susceptibility to CP in response to environmental factors (MacLennan et al. ; Nelson and Blair ).
Osteopontin (OPN), also known as SPP1, is a widely expressed multifunctional protein that plays a role in numerous biochemical pathways. One of its most important functions is to act as a pro-inflammatory cytokine secreted from activated macrophages and T-lymphocytes. OPN is expressed soon after macrophage activation by pathogens (Brown ) and promotes the production of pro-inflammatory interleukin 12 (IL-12) as well as the suppression of anti-inflammatory interleukin 10 (IL-10) (Ashkar et al. ). Inflammation is a balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory processes, and can be beneficial or harmful depending on other inputs the cell is receiving. Alternatively, OPN in some contexts may function in the brain in a protective capacity, through an ability to promote cell survival. After spinal cord injury, OPN -deficient mice suffer from greater tissue damage and impaired locomotor recovery, suggesting that OPN plays an important role in adult neurological repair (Hashimoto et al. ). Furthermore, OPN can reduce the severity of brain injury caused by hypoxia-ischemia in neonatal rats. A recent study showed that 9-day-old wild-type mice whose brains were injured by hypoxia-ischemia had significant increases in the expression of OPN within the first 7 days after injury. Another study found that hypoxic-ischemic injury in OPN -deficient mice resulted in increased loss of gray and white matter in the brain, as well as in more pronounced sensorimotor deficits in comparison with their wild-type littermates (van Velthoven et al. ). However, other studies using OPN peptides or OPN -deficient mice did not demonstrate a protective effect of OPN in immature brain injury, suggesting that the discrepancy between the proposed roles of OPN in central nervous system injury could be age related and animal model related (Albertsson et al. ; Bonestroo et al. ).
One of the main causes of CP is neonatal encephalopathy, a clinical syndrome of disordered neurological function, and occurs as a consequence of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), and periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), among others. Among these, HIE is an important cause of permanent damage to central nervous system cells and accounts for approximately 10 % of CP cases (Jan ; Girard et al. ). Inflammation is also thought to be a risk factor for CP (Nelson and Grether ; Girard et al. ; Nelson and Willoughby ; Dammann ), and pro-inflammatory cytokines are thought to be major mediators of brain injury in neonates suffering from perinatal asphyxia, bacterial infection, or both (Girard et al. ). By considering these clinical features of CP, researchers focused on genes central to inflammation and neurological development and repair, and detected several such associated genes, including interleukin-6, apolipoprotein E, and AP4 complex (Chen et al. ; Wang et al. ; Gibson et al. ; Wu et al. ). Similarly, because OPN acts as a cytokine in the immune system in addition to being neuroprotective and inhibiting cell death, we hypothesized that OPN gene polymorphisms might be associated with CP. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are a common and important form of genetic variation that can lead to functional gene changes and are often used in detecting candidate genes for diseases.
Materials and Methods
All CP patients and controls were genetically unrelated ethnic Han Chinese recruited from the Third Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou Children’s Hospital, and the First Affiliated Hospital of Henan Traditional Chinese Medical College from 2011 to 2014. There were 715 CP cases (496 boys and 219 girls) with an average age of 18.3 ± 15.1 months. The control group consisted of 658 healthy infants (438 boys and 220 girls) with an average age of 19.5 ± 17.1 months. The case group and the control group were matched by age, gender, and place of residence. CP patients were diagnosed according to guidelines proposed by the network for the Surveillance of Cerebral Palsy in Europe and Child Rehabilitation Committee of Chinese Rehabilitation Medical Association and further classified into spastic, dyskinetic, atonic, and ataxic subtypes. The mixed CP patient was defined as a patient with features of at least two CP types (Surveillance of Cerebral Palsy in Europe ; The Child Rehabilitation Committee of Chinese Rehabilitation Medical Association ). Controls that presented with any neurological condition (central nervous system infection, developmental delay, seizure disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, or migraine headache) or predefined medical conditions (juvenile diabetes mellitus or growth retardation) were excluded from the study. Their detailed information is presented in Table 1 . Informed consent forms were obtained from the parents of all participants, and our research protocol was approved by the Zhengzhou University Ethics Committee.

Five SNPs—rs2853744, rs2853749, rs11728697, rs4754, and rs1126616—were selected from the International HapMap Project (HapMap Data PhaseIII/Rel#2, Feb09, on NCBI B36 assembly, dbSNP b126). SNPs rs11728697 and rs4754 are tag SNPs. rs2853744 is located upstream of OPN , and rs2853749, rs11728697, rs4754, and rs1126616 are located in intron 1, exon 4, exon 7, and exon 8, respectively. All five SNPS have a minor allele frequency higher than 0.05 in the Chinese Han population. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood white cells using the Qiamp mini DNA kit (Qiagen, USA), and SNPs were genotyped using the MassArray platform (Sequenom, USA). Primers were designed using the Sequenom online tool ( https://www.mysequenom.com ), and sequences are available upon request. We used SHEsis online software ( http://analysis.bio-x.cn/myAnalysis.php ) to test for Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, compare allele/genotype frequencies, estimate pairwise linkage disequilibrium, analyze haplotype associations, and calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI) (Shi and He ; Li et al. ). Multiple testing on each SNP was corrected by Bonferroni correction.
Results
Allele/genotype frequencies of the five investigated SNPs are listed in Table 2 . Genotype frequencies of these polymorphisms showed no significant deviations from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium in controls. Linkage disequilibrium of the five SNPs is shown in Table 3 . The rs4754/rs1126616 SNP pair exhibited strong linkage disequilibrium ( D ′ > 0.8, r 2 > 0.8), but the D ′ value of rs1126616 with each of the other SNPs was less than 0.8.

Among all cases and controls, rs1126616 reached statistical significance with an allelic P value of 0.000129 (corrected P = 0.000645, OR = 0.694, 95 % CI 0.575–0.837) and a genotypic P value of 0.000211 (corrected P = 0.00111). The C-allele frequency of rs1126616 was lower in cases (24.3 %) than in controls (31.6 %). Analyzing by sex, the association between CP and rs1126616 remained significant in males (allelic P = 0.00192, genotypic P = 0.00191), but was marginal in females (allelic P = 0.0384, genotypic P > 0.05). After performing stratified analysis based on CP subtype, significant discrepancies were found between allele and genotype frequencies of rs1126616 in spastic CP versus controls (allelic P = 0.000363, genotypic P = 0.000156) and atonic CP versus controls (allelic P = 0.00495, genotypic P = 0.0252). There were no significant differences in allele or genotype frequencies for any of the other SNPs. Furthermore, the subgroup analysis was done based on the complications with different types of neonatal encephalopathy, such as HIE. The CP + HIE subgroup ( n = 65) was not found to be associated with any of the five SNPs; this lack of association is likely due to the small sample size (Table 4 ).

Owing to the strong linkage disequilibrium between rs4754 and rs1126616, haplotype analysis was performed between these two SNPs (Table 5 ). The results indicated that the estimated haplotype frequencies with different combinations of rs4754 and rs1126616 were significantly different in CP cases compared with controls ( P = 1.38 × 10 −5 ). Specifically, the frequency of haplotype TC ( P = 8.96 × 10 −5 , OR = 0.679, 95 % CI 0.559–0.824) was higher in controls than in CP cases.

Discussion
In our study, the OPN gene polymorphism rs1126616 was associated with total CP. We had 715 cases and 658 controls and obtained original P values of less than 0.0005 in both the allele and genotype frequencies, indicating that the association was unlikely to be due to chance. The positive association remained statistically significant after applying the Bonferroni correction (corrected allelic P = 0.000645, genotypic P = 0.00111). We also assessed the association between the other SNPs and CP subgroups. Only SNP rs1126616 was found to be associated with certain subgroups, indicating that rs1126616 might be implicated in the development of the disease via a shared pathological mechanism underlying those subtypes of CP.
Clinically, CP consists of a range of non-progressive syndromes resulting from injury to the developing central nervous system. CP is the main cause of dyskinesia in childhood, and sequelae can persist throughout an individual’s lifetime. The complex pathogenesis of CP remains poorly understood, but recent findings demonstrate that inflammation is involved in CP. In maternal infections, about 14 % of spastic tetraparesis cases are associated with chorioamnionitis, and the OR of chorioamnionitis for CP was higher in children with hypoxic-ischemic brain injury than among others (OR = 17.2 [95 % CI 3.3–88] vs. OR = 3.2 [95 % CI 1.2–8.1]; P = 0.04) (Wu et al. ).
Repeated studies demonstrated that the fetal inflammatory response is linked with CP risk (Wu et al. ; Fleiss and Gressens ). The aberrant proinflammatory effects might persist for months or years after the initiating event. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a proinflammatory cytokine that is produced in response to pathogens to promote immunologic and inflammatory responses. Our previous study found that plasma IL-6 was higher in the CP patients than in the controls (Bi et al. ), which indicated that excessive amount of IL-6 was produced and released persistently and suggested an altered inflammatory response in CP cases.
Because inflammation is one of the risk factors for CP, we believe that the association between OPN gene polymorphisms and CP is at least partly due to the role that OPN plays in inflammation. In our study, although the rs1126616 SNP was significantly associated with total CP, the association disappeared in the CP + HIE subgroup. The proportion of CP + HIE patients in our study was 9 %, which matches the estimated average of approximately 10 % in global CP patients (Costeff ). Because the neuroprotective function of OPN was implied in previous studies, our detected lack of association between rs1126616 and CP + HIE is likely explained by the following three reasons. The first explanation is that severe asphyxia at birth can lead to CP, but this is not a common cause of CP and it is not easy to identify when asphyxia occurred. Thus, it may be more efficient to focus on the CP with neonatal encephalopathy than CP + HIE to estimate the relationship between OPN variants and the susceptibility to CP. The second explanation involves OPN pleiotropy. In addition to being a neuroprotective polypeptide, OPN can also serve as either a pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory cytokine during the early stage of macrophage activation by regulating other important cytokines such as IL-12 (pro-inflammatory) and IL-10 (anti-inflammatory) (Brown ; Ashkar et al. ). The third explanation is that the sample size of CP + HIE patients ( n = 65) is too small to generate sufficient power to detect a potential association between OPN polymorphisms and the CP + HIE subgroup.
The rs1126616 is a common SNP of OPN and has been studied in other diseases, including glioma, pelvic inflammatory disease, urolithiasis, Crohn’s disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, and colorectal carcinoma (Wang et al. ; Tugcu et al. ; Safarinejad et al. ; Glas et al. ; Forton et al. ; Fan et al. ; Arjomandi et al. ). Although this SNP is a synonymous variant (Ala250Ala) and likely non-functional, it is still implicated in some of the diseases listed above and is most likely in linkage disequilibrium with other functional variants. Furthermore, the association between haplotype rs4754 (T)–rs1126616 (C) and CP has a significant P value of 8.96 × 10 −5 . Therefore, we believe that this variation (rs1126616) or the haplotype rs4754 (T)–rs1126616 (C) is non-randomly associated with susceptibility to CP.
In conclusion, our study is the first to find a SNP, rs1126616, in the OPN gene is associated with total CP in a relatively large Chinese Han population. Our results support the hypotheses that genetic factors serve as risk factors for CP and that the OPN gene affects the pathology of CP via inflammatory processes. Although our CP + HIE subgroup analysis does not show a positive association with rs1126616, we still believe that OPN’s role in repairing the neurological damage caused by neonatal encephalopathy influences the development of CP based on the positive association previously seen in rat models and in our relatively large sample power analysis. Some limitations of this study must be noted. Linkage disequilibrium among the five SNPs was not very strong, suggesting some important linkage disequilibrium blocks may have been overlooked. Furthermore, brain injury usually occurs in the prenatal and perinatal period, whereas our study builds on results from recent studies involving postnatally induced animal models. Thus, we suspect that further experiments focusing on gene function during the prenatal period will allow us to determine the relationship between the OPN gene and CP.
Conclusion
In this study, a significant association between the OPN gene SNP rs1126616 and CP was observed in a relatively large Chinese Han population. The association corresponds to results of previous studies on the neuroprotective effect of OPN in animal models. Our results indicate that the OPN gene may be a susceptibility factor for CP and might be useful in uncovering the molecular pathogenesis of CP.
