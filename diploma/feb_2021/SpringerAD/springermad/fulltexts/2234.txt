Introduction
Oxidative stress, which is associated with various neurodegenerative diseases such as brain ischemia and trauma, initiates a cascade of events leading to cell death [ , ]. At the molecular level, oxidative stress leads to an increase in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and free radicals, i.e., hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), hydroxyl radical (OH°), and superoxide anions (O 2 °− ), which are responsible for oxidative damages of cellular biomolecules [ , , , , , ]. In parallel, excessive ROS production overwhelms the endogenous protection afforded by antioxidant enzymes and molecules, such as superoxide dismutases (SOD), catalase and glutathione peroxidase, and reduced glutathione (GSH) [ , , , ]. Compared to neurons, astroglial cells possess more efficient protective mechanisms against ROS damages, and secrete an array of antioxidant and neurotrophic factors [ , , , ] playing a prominent role in the defense of neighboring neurons against oxidative stress and cell death. Therefore, endogenous molecules that could rescue astroglial cells from oxidative injuries are emerging as research targets to prevent or reduce cerebral injuries involving oxidative neurodegeneration [ , , ].
Astrocytes synthesize and release endozepines, a family of regulatory peptides, including the diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI) and its processing fragments such as the octadecaneuropeptide ODN [ ]. It was initially reported that DBI and ODN interact with central-type benzodiazepine receptors (CBR) [ ]. Subsequently, it has been shown that ODN can activate a G protein-coupled receptor positively coupled either to phospholipase C [ , ] or adenylyl cyclase [ , ]. Some studies have clearly established that DBI and its derived products regulate various biological functions in the brain such as food intake [ , ], behavior activities [ ], and energy metabolism [ ]. Interestingly, a role of ODN in the control of proliferation and/or survival of neuronal cells has been demonstrated under physiopathological conditions. Indeed, through activation of CBR, ODN stimulates astrocyte and neuroblast proliferation [ , , ], and via activation of a metabotropic receptor, ODN protects neurons and glial cells from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis [ , ]. Moreover, through the stimulation of its metabotropic receptor, ODN prevents the inhibition of endogenous antioxidant systems and damages of biomolecules, i.e., the formation of lipid oxidation products, malondialdehyde and conjugated diene, and protein carbonyl compounds provoked by oxidative stress [ , ]. Altogether, these data suggest that ODN could act as an endogenous protector against the deleterious action of oxidative stress.
There is evidence that endozepine production is induced during injuries involving oxidative neurodegeneration such as inflammation and neurodegenerative diseases [ , , ]. In addition, in vitro studies have revealed that the exposure of cultured astrocytes to beta-amyloid peptide stimulates the expression of DBI and the release of ODN-like immunoreactive peptide [ , ]. Because of the antioxidant and antiapoptotic properties of ODN, we hypothesized that this gliopeptide could be upregulated by oxidative stress and might exert a protective action on both glial cells and neurons, at least during initial oxidative assault and/or during moderate oxidative stress.
Thus, the aim of this study is to test a possible glioprotective effect of endogenous ODN on cultured astrocytes or neurons subjected to a moderate oxidative stress induced by H 2 O 2 .

Cell Culture
Secondary Cultures of rat Cortical Astrocytes
Secondary cultures of rat cortical astrocytes were prepared from 1- or 2-day-old Wistar rats of both sexes as previously described [ ]. Briefly, cerebral hemispheres were collected in DMEM/F12 (2:1; v / v ) culture medium supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 1‰ insulin, 5 mM HEPES, 0.4% glucose, and 1% of the antibiotic-antimycotic solution. After removal of the meninges, tissues were scattered mechanically with a syringe equipped with a 1-mm gauge needle and filtered through a 100-μm sieve (Falcon, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Dissociated cells were resuspended in culture medium supplemented with 10% FBS, plated in 75-cm 2 flasks (Greiner Bio-One GmbH, Frickenhausen, Germany) at a density of 17 × 10 6 cells/ml and incubated at 37 °C in humid atmosphere (5% CO 2 /95% air). When astrocytes were confluent, they were isolated by shaking overnight the flasks on an orbital agitator. Adherent cells were detached by trypsination and pre-plated for 5 min to discard contaminating microglial cells. Then, the non-adherent astrocytes were harvested and plated at a density of 0.3 × 10 6 cells/ml in 24-well plates to measure ROS levels, in 35-mm Petri dishes to measure DBI expression, ODN-like immunoreactivity (ODN-LI) released, and macrobiomolecules oxidation products, or in 75-cm 2 flasks to analyze ODN-LI. All experiments were performed on 5- to 7-day-old secondary cultures, and more than 98% of the cells were labeled with antibodies against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) [ ].
Cerebellar Granule Neuron Primary Culture
Primary cultures of cerebellar granule neurons (CGN) were prepared from cerebellums of 8-day-old rats, as previously described [ ]. Neurons were cultured in DMEM/F12 (3:1, v / v ) culture medium supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 25 mM KCl, 1% of antibiotic-antimycotic solution, and 10% FBS. β-ARAC (10 μM) was added 24 h after plating to prevent proliferation of non-neuronal cells. Granule neurons were incubated at 37 °C in humid atmosphere (5% CO 2 /95% air) for 5–7 days.
Measurement of Cell Survival
The number of surviving cultured cells was quantified by measuring FDA fluorescence. Cells were incubated at 37 °C with fresh serum-free culture medium in the absence or presence of the test substances. At the end of the experiments, cells were incubated at 37 °C in the dark with FDA-AM (12 μg/ml; 8 min), rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 0.1 M, pH 7.4), and lysed with a Tris-HCl solution containing 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Fluorescence intensity was measured with excitation at 485 nm and emission at 538 nm using a fluorescence microplate reader FL800TBI (Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, VT, USA). Pilot experiments have shown that the fluorescence intensity is proportional to the number of cells (in the range of 75 × 10 4 to 10 6 cells/ml).
Measurement of Cell Cytotoxicity
Cultured cells were incubated at 37 °C with fresh serum-free medium in the absence or presence of test substances. At the end of the incubation, the cytotoxicity of H 2 O 2 (25 μM to 200 μM) was determined by measuring the activity of LDH released into the culture medium, resulting from the disruption of the membrane integrity, using a cytotoxicity detection kit (MAK066, Sigma-Aldrich) and according to the manufacturer’s instructions. LDH activity was measured at 450 nm with a spectrophotometric microplate reader (FlexStation 3, Molecular Devices Sunnyvale, CA, USA).
Electron Microscopy
Cultured astrocytes were fixed with 3% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) for 30 min at 4 °C, washed with cacodylate buffer, and post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide. The cells were dehydrated by increasing concentrations of ethanol (70 to 100%) and then embedded in Epoxy embedding medium (Fluka 45359). Ultra-thin sections (60–70 nm) were cut using a Leica UCT ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems, Vienna, Austria), contrasted using uranyl acetate in combination with lead citrate, and observed on a JEM 1010 transmission electron microscope (JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).
Measurement of Markers of Cellular Oxidative Stress
The induction of oxidative stress and cellular ROS formation in 50 μM H 2 O 2 -treated astrocytes were assessed by using ROS sensor fluorescent probes DHR123, DHE, and 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) [ ].
Measurement of Intracellular Peroxide Accumulation
H 2 O 2 was quantified by staining cells with DHR123, which is a cell-permeable, non-fluorescent compound that is oxidized by cellular peroxides to fluorescent rhodamine 123 (Rh 123). Astrocytes were incubated at 37 °C with fresh serum-free medium in the absence or presence of H 2 O 2 . At the end of the incubation, the cultures were washed twice with PBS, to prevent oxidation of DHR123 by H 2 O 2 in the medium, and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min in fresh medium containing 2 μM DHR and then washed twice with PBS. Rh 123 fluorescence (λ excitation = 505 nm and λ emission = 529 nm) was measured with a microplate reader (BioTek FL800TBI).
Measurement of Intracellular Superoxide Anion Production
O 2 ° − levels were detected by measuring the fluorescence of ethidium which derived from the oxidation of the non-fluorescent compound DHE. Astrocytes were incubated at 37 °C with fresh serum-free medium in the absence or presence of H 2 O 2 . At the end of the incubation, the cells were incubated for 20 min in fresh medium containing 2 μM DHE at 37 °C and then washed twice with PBS. Ethidium fluorescence (λ excitation = 520 nm and λ emission = 610 nm) was measured with a microplate reader (BioTek FL800TBI).
Measurement of Intracellular ROS Formation
ROS, i.e., hydroxyl radical (OH°), peroxyl radical (ROO°), and H 2 O 2 , were detected by measuring the fluorescence of DCF which derived from the hydrolysis and oxidation of the non-fluorescent compound DCFH 2 -DA. Cells seeded into 24-well plates were first incubated at 37 °C with fresh serum-free medium in the absence or presence of H 2 O 2 , and at the end of incubation cells were exposed to fresh medium containing 10 μM DCFH 2 -DA for 30 min. Thereafter, cells were washed three times with PBS. Fluorescence was measured with excitation at 485 nm and emission at 535 nm, using a microplate reader.
Measurement of Biomacromolecules Oxidative Products
Cultured cells were incubated at 37 °C with fresh serum-free medium in the absence or presence of H 2 O 2 . At the end of the incubation, cells were washed twice with PBS and total cellular proteins were extracted by using a lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8), 10 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM phenylmethyl-sulfonylfluoride, and 1% Triton X-100. The homogenate was centrifuged (16,000× g , 20 min, 4 °C), and the supernatant was stored at −20 °C until determination of biomacromolecule oxidative damage.
Malondialdehyde Measurement
Malondialdehyde (MDA) content was determined according to the heating method of Drapper and Hadley [ ]. Samples, prepared as described above, were mixed with a solution containing 20% TCA and 0.67% TBA. The mixture was immediately heated for 30 min at 95 °C and then cooled. After adding n-butanol, mixtures were mixed and centrifuged (3000× g , 10 min, 4 °C). Supernatant was collected, and the absorbance was measured at 532 nm with a Bio-Rad spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Philadelphia, PA, USA). MDA levels were determined by using the extinction coefficient of MDA-TBA complex of 1.56 × 10 5 M −1 cm −1 .
Protein Carbonyl Measurement
Oxidative damages of proteins were evaluated by measuring protein carbonylation levels. Proteins contained in the sample were precipitated by addition of a 20% TCA and 10 mM DNPH mixture. After centrifugation (11,000× g , 3 min, 4 °C), the pellet was washed three times with an ethanol-ethylacetate solution ( v / v ) and then resuspended in 500 μl of 6 M guanidine hydrochloride. The absorbance was measured at 370 nm with a Bio-Rad spectrophotometer, and protein carbonylation levels were determined by using the extinction coefficient of 22,000 M −1 cm −1 .
Measurement of Antioxidant Enzyme Activities
Cells were incubated at 37 °C with fresh serum-free medium. At the end of the incubation, cells were rinsed twice with PBS, rubber scraped, and centrifuged at 3000× g for 15 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of ice-cold lysing buffer containing 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8), 10 mM EDTA, 100 μM phenylmethyl-sulfonylfluoride, and 1% Triton X-100. The homogenate was centrifuged (16,000 ×g , 4 °C, 20 min), and the supernatant was conserved at −20 °C until antioxidant enzyme activity determination assay.
SOD activity was assessed using a spectrophotometric assay, which consists of measuring epinephrine oxidation induced by superoxide anions, as previously described [ ]. Samples were incubated with a mixture containing bovine catalase (0.4 U/μl), dl -epinephrine (5 mg/ml), and Na 2 CO 3 /NaHCO 3 buffer (62.5 mM, pH 10.2). The oxidation of epinephrine was measured at 480 nm for 5 min at 1-min intervals by using a Bio-Rad spectrophotometer.
Catalase activity was determined on the basis of the disappearance of H 2 O 2 . Samples, prepared as described above, were mixed with 30 mM H 2 O 2 in PBS. The decrease of H 2 O 2 was followed at a wavelength of 240 nm for 3 min at 30-s intervals. Catalase activity was expressed using the extinction coefficient of 40 mM −1 cm −1 for H 2 O 2 .
Measurement of ODN-LI in Culture Media by Radioimmunoassay
Astrocytes were incubated for 1, 3, and 6 h at 37 °C with fresh serum-free medium in the absence or presence of H 2 O 2 (50 μM). Astrocyte-conditioned media were collected, centrifuged at 200× g for 10 min, desalted, and concentrated using a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA). Bound material was eluted with 50% ( v / v ) acetonitrile/water containing 0.1% TFA ( v / v ), freeze-dried, and kept at 4 °C until analysis by radioimmunoassay (RIA). The concentration of ODN-LI was measured using an antiserum raised against synthetic rat ODN [ ]. [Tyr°]-ODN was iodinated using the chloramine-T procedure [ ] and purified on a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge. The ODN antiserum exhibited also 100% cross-reactivity with the DBI [ , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ], TQPTDEEMLFIYSHFKQATVGDVNTDRPGLLDLK, sequence. Dried samples were resuspended in phosphate buffer (0.1 M; pH 8) containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Final dilution of the ODN antiserum was 1:30,000, and the total amount of iodinated [Tyr°]-ODN was 6000 cpm/tube. After 2 days of incubation at 4 °C, the antibody-bound ODN fraction was precipitated by addition of bovine gamma globulin (1%, w / v ) and polyethylene glycol 8000 (20%, w / v ). After centrifugation (5000× g , 4 °C, 30 min), the supernatant was removed and the pellet containing the bound fraction was counted in a gamma counter (LKB Wallac, Mt. Waverley, Australia).
Characterization and Measurement of ODN in Culture Media by Mass Spectrometry
Cells were incubated at 37 °C with fresh serum-free medium in the absence or presence of H 2 O 2 (50 μM). At the end of the incubation, culture media from three 75-cm 2 culture flasks were collected and then centrifuged at 200× g for 10 min. The supernatants and standard ODN (5 to 1000 fmol) solutions in serum-free culture medium were desalted and concentrated using a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge. Bound material was eluted with 70% ( v / v ) acetonitrile/water containing 0.1% TFA ( v / v ), the solvent was evaporated by vacuum centrifugation, and the sample was reconstituted in 10 μl of acetonitrile/water (97:3, v / v ) containing 0.1% formic acid (FA) ( v / v ). The fraction was submitted on a UPLC coupled to a 6490 Triple Quadrupole mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Les Ulis, France). Peptides were eluted from the analytical column (Zorbax SB-C18 RRHD 2.1 × 50 mm, 1.8 μm) by using a linear gradient (50% over 2 min) of acetonitrile/water/FA (89.95:9.95:0.1, v / v / v ) at a flow rate of 6 ml/min. The ESI(+) Triple Quad mass spectrometer was operated using MassHunter Data Acquisition B.06.00 (Agilent Technologies). Optimized ionization parameters used were as follows: capillary voltage, 3500 V; drying gas flow rate, 15 l/min; drying temperature, 200 °C. MS data acquisition was performed in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode with a major transition and eight secondary transitions. Data were analyzed using MassHunter Qualitative and Quantitative B.06.00 (Agilent Technologies).
Quantitative PCR Analysis
At the end of experiments, cells were washed once with PBS, and total RNA harvested with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and then purified using the NucleoSpin kit (Macherey-Nagel, Hoerdt, France). Contaminating genomic DNA was eliminated by treatment with DNAse I (Promega, Charbonnières, France), and complementary DNA (cDNA) were synthesized from 1 μg of RNA using ImProm-II Promega kit (Promega). PCR amplifications were performed with an ABI PRISM 7500 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Courtaboeuf, France) using 15 ng cDNA, 1× Fast SYBR Green universal PCR Mastermix (Applied Biosystems), and 300 nM forward (5′-TGGACAAACCTGAGCCCTAA-3′) and reverse (5′-GACCCAAAGTCACG CTTGA TA-3′) SOD2 primers, GenBank accession no. NM_013671 , or forward (5′-CCA CAGTCGCTGGAGAGTCA-3′) and reverse (5′-GTTTCCCACAAGGTCCCAGTT-3′) catalase primers, GenBank accession no. NM_009804 , (Proligo, Evry, France), or forward (5′-TGCTCCCGCGCTTTCA-3′) and reverse (5′-CTGAGTCTTGAGGCGC TTCAC-3′) DBI primers, GenBank accession no . NM_001037999 (Eurofins Biosciences, Courtaboeuf, France), under standard running conditions as suggested by the manufacturer. The amount of cDNA in each sample was calculated by the comparative threshold cycle (Ct) method and expressed as 2 exp(−ΔΔCt) using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as an internal control.
Transfection with DBI Small Interfering RNA
Astrocyte transient transfections were performed using the Amaxa® Cell Line Nucleofector® Kit V (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer’s protocol (program T-020). Cells (3 × 10 6 ) were electroporated with a pool of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) directed against DBI mRNA (DBI siRNA, 5′-UA UGUUAGGGCCAGAGUUA-3′, 5′-GGACAUAAUGCCUUGGUGU-3′, 5′-UGGAACAAGCUGAAAGGAA-3′, 5′-CUACUGUGGGCGAUGUAAA-3′; PrimerBank NM_007830 , Dharmacon, Velizy-Villacoublay, France) or a non-targeting siRNA (Nt siRNA, 5′-AUGUAUUGGCCUGUAUUAG-3′; Dharmacon). The results obtained with Nt siRNA were similar to those obtained with untransfected cells, excluding non-specific effects due to the transfection procedure or siRNA toxicity. DBI mRNA levels were evaluated by QPCR and ODN-related peptide expression by immunocytochemistry, 24 to 72 and 72 h after the transfection, respectively.
Immunocytochemistry
Cells were fixed with 4% PFA in PBS for 20 min, and incubated for 1 h in a blocking solution containing 1/50 normal donkey serum, 10% FBS, and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS. Cells were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies against GFAP (astrocytes labeling, 1/500; Dako, Les Ulis, France) or rat ODN (1/100; [ ]). Subsequently, cells were incubated with secondary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature, i.e., Alexa 488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1/400; Invitrogen, Boulogne-Billancourt, France). Cell nuclei were stained with the nuclear marker DAPI (1 μg/ml, 10 min at room temperature), and finally, cells were cover slipped with Mowiol®. Immunofluorescence was observed under an Eclipse E600 microscope (Nikon Instruments, Champigny-sur-Marne, France).
Statistical Analysis
Data are presented as the mean ± SEM from at least three independent experiments performed in quadruplicate or triplicate. The statistical analysis of the data was performed by using ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni’s test with the GraphPad software system for Windows (La Jolla, CA, USA). A p value of 0.05 or less was considered as statistically significant.
Results
Assessment of the Optimal Parameters for H2O2 Treatment to Induce Moderate Stress in Cultured Astrocytes
We have first evaluated the optimal dose and treatment duration that induced the most representative outcomes in terms of cell oxidative status, without inducing cell death. Graded concentrations of H 2 O 2 ranging from 25 to 200 μM were administrated to cultured astrocytes for 6 h and induced a dose-dependent gliotoxic effect. The effect of H 2 O 2 on the decrease of the proportion of surviving cells was significant at a dose up to 50 μM (Fig. 1 a). The exposure of cultured astrocytes to 50 μM H 2 O 2 induced a transient inhibition of cell survival 3 h after the administration of H 2 O 2 (Fig. 1 b). Thereafter, 50 μM H 2 O 2 -treated astrocytes exhibited cell death only for an incubation period higher than 12 h. Time course experiments showed that 50 μM H 2 O 2 provoked a mirror effect on astrocyte survival and cell LDH leakage (Fig. 1 b). The examination of cells by phase-contrast microscopy revealed that 50 μM H 2 O 2 induces some morphological changes characterized by the appearance of long thin processes, but cells displayed a flat polygonal aspect similar to that of untreated astrocytes (Fig. 1 c). To further explore possible ultrastructural changes in the cell body of cultured astrocytes induced by H 2 O 2 , we have examined cells under transmission electron microscopy. Electron microscopy revealed that H 2 O 2 treatment induced formation of swollen smooth endoplasmic reticulum vacuoles; mitochondria are swollen with a clear matrix and disoriented cristae. However, plasma membrane integrity was preserved (Fig. 1 d). Fig. 1 Effect of H 2 O 2 on cell death in cultured rat astrocytes. a Cells were incubated for 6 h with medium alone ( open square ) or with graded concentrations of H 2 O 2 (25–200 μM; filled square ). Cell survival was quantified by measuring FDA fluorescence intensity. b Cells were incubated in the absence or presence of H 2 O 2 (50 μM) for the indicated time. Cell survival was quantified by measuring FDA fluorescence intensity ( full line ), and membrane integrity was assessed by measuring lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in culture media ( dotted line ). Results are expressed as percentages of controls. Each value is the mean (± SEM) from at least six different wells from three independent cultures. ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s test: * p < 0.05; *** p < 0.001; NS, not statistically different vs. control. c Typical phase-contrast images illustrating the effect of H 2 O 2 on the morphology of cultured rat astrocytes. Scale bars 50 μm. d Representative electron microscopy images from control and H 2 O 2 -treated cultured astrocytes. Scale bars 500 nm. ER = smooth endoplasmic reticulum; Mb : plasma membrane; N = nucleus; V = vacuole
To ascertain that 50 μM H 2 O 2 induces moderate oxidative stress, levels of markers of cell oxidation, i.e., H 2 O 2 , O 2 °− , and ROS, have been measured by using probes DHR123, DHE, and CM-H2DCFDA, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2 a, the exposure of cultured astrocytes to 50 μM H 2 O 2 induced a significant increase of intracellular H 2 O 2 levels (+134%; p < 0.001) and a concomitant decrease of extracellular H 2 O 2 levels within 3 h. Thereafter, intracellular levels of H 2 O 2 rapidly declined (Fig. 2 a). In addition, 50 μM H 2 O 2 provoked an increase of O 2 °− level (+18%; p < 0.05) and of ROS accumulation (+56%; p < 0.001) after 6 h of treatment (Fig. 2 b, c). Fig. 2 Effects of H 2 O 2 on reactive oxygen species levels and biomolecule damages in cultured rat astrocytes. a–c Cells were incubated in the absence or presence of 50 μM H 2 O 2 for the indicated time. Intracellular ( full line ) and extracellular ( dotted line ) H 2 O 2 levels, O 2 °− , level and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation were quantified by measuring of the fluorescence of oxidized dihydrhodamine (DHR)123, dihydroethidium (DHE), and 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF), respectively. Cells were incubated for 3 or 6 h with medium alone ( open square ) or with 50 μM H 2 O 2 ( filled square ). Lipid peroxidation ( d ) and protein oxidation ( e ) were quantified by measuring malondialdehyde (MDA) content and protein carbonylation, respectively. Results are expressed as percentages of controls. Each value is the mean (± SEM) of at least six different wells from three independent experiments. ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s test: * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001; NS , not statistically different vs. control
Considering the deleterious effects of ROS on biomolecules, lipids, and proteins, their levels of oxidation were also examined. The exposure of astrocytes to 50 μM H 2 O 2 for 3 or 6 h enhanced lipid peroxidation (+82%; p < 0.01) and protein carbonylation (+238%; p < 0.01) (Fig. 2 d, e).
A concentration of 50 μM H 2 O 2 administrated during 6 h, considered as a moderate stress in astrocytes, was used in all subsequent experiments in order to evaluate the beneficial effect of endogenous ODN.
Effect of Moderate Oxidative Stress on the Expression of DBI and the Release of ODN in Cultured Astrocytes
Time-course experiments revealed that exposure of cultured astrocytes to 50 μM H 2 O 2 provoked a transient inhibition of DBI expression (−39%, p < 0.05). Thereafter, the level of DBI mRNA (+72%; p < 0.001), as well as that of ODN-LI in culture media (+88%; p < 0.05), was enhanced after 6 h of incubation (Fig. 3 a, b). Fig. 3 Effects of H 2 O 2 on DBI mRNA levels and ODN release in cultured rat astrocytes. a Cells were incubated in the absence or presence of 50 μM H 2 O 2 for the indicated time, and DBI mRNA levels were measured by quantitative RT-PCR. Data were corrected using the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase signal as an internal control, and the results are expressed as percentages of controls. Each value is the mean (± SEM) of at least four different wells from three independent experiments. b Cells were incubated in the absence ( open square ) or in the presence of 50 μM H 2 O 2 ( filled square ) for 6 h, and ODN-like immunoreactivity (ODN-LI) released in media was measured by radioimunoassay. Results are expressed as percentages of control. Each value is the mean (± SEM) of at least three different wells from two independent experiments. c Representative total ion current chromatograms, in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, of media from astrocytes incubated for 6 h without (control) or with 50 μM H 2 O 2 , or culture medium containing standard ODN (20 fmol). The peaks correspond to the major transition of ODN ( m / z 638.01 → 756.80). d Quantification of ODN in culture media from astrocytes incubated without ( open square ) or with 50 μM H 2 O 2 ( filled square ) was evaluated as the area under the peaks, shown in c . Values are the mean of at least three samples and expressed as a percentage of the control value ± SEM. ANOVA followed by Bonferroni test: * p < 0.05; *** p < 0.001; NS , not statistically different vs. control
Culture media from astrocytes incubated for 6 h without or with H 2 O 2 (50 μM) were then analyzed on a UPLC system coupled to a 6490 ESI(+)-triple quad mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies). A quantitative measurement of ODN was evaluated in the MRM mode following majority transitions: ODN ( m / z 638.01 → 756.90). Data were analyzed using MassHunter Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis softwares B.06 (Agilent Technologies) (Fig. 3 c). The quantity of authentic ODN in culture media from H 2 O 2 -treated astrocytes was significantly higher than that detected in culture media from control astrocytes (+ 87%; p < 0.001) (Fig. 3 d).
To further explore the implication of endogenous ODN in the mechanisms of cell defense to prevent oxidative damage, the expression and the activity of SOD and catalase were investigated. Time-course experiments revealed that H 2 O 2 -treated astrocytes exhibited an upregulation of both SOD (+226%; p < 0.001) and catalase mRNA levels (+70%; p < 0.001) with a maximum effect reached after 6 and 3 h of incubation, respectively (Fig. 4 a, b). Interestingly, we detected in H 2 O 2 -treated astrocytes a significant increase in both SOD (+63% ± 2.08; p < 0.001) and catalase (+114% ± 2.07; p < 0.001) activities with maximal effect at 6 h for SOD and 1 h for catalase (insets: Fig. 4 a, b), suggesting that the release of ODN in the medium could be accounted for the self-protective response of astrocytes to moderate oxidative stress. Fig. 4 Effects of H 2 O 2 on SOD and catalase expression and activities in cultured rat astrocytes. Cells were incubated in the absence or presence of 50 μM H 2 O 2 for the indicated time. SOD 2 ( a ) and catalase (CAT, b ) mRNA levels were measured by quantitative RT-PCR. Data were corrected using the GAPDH signal as an internal control, and the results are expressed as a percentage of controls. Insets , the activity of SOD was evaluated by measuring epinephrine autoxidation induced by the superoxide anion ( inset a ), and CAT by measuring the decomposition of H 2 O 2 ( inset b ). Results are expressed as percentages of controls. Each value is the mean (± SEM) of at least five different dishes from three independent experiments.

Protective Effect of Endogenous ODN in H2O2-Treated Astrocytes
Since the mechanism of ODN-LI release is regulated by the adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A (PKA) transduction pathway [ ], we have examined the effect of the inhibition of ODN secretion on the resistance of astrocytes to H 2 O 2 damages. As shown in Fig. 5 a, the incubation of H 2 O 2 -treated cells with the PKA inhibitor H89 significantly decreased cell viability (−38%, p < 0.05). We have previously reported that ODN, through the activation of its metabotropic receptor, protects glial cells against oxidative stress-induced apoptosis [ ]. Thus, to determine if endogenous ODN plays a crucial role in protecting astrocytes from death induced by H 2 O 2 , we have next tested the effect of a selective ODN metabotropic receptor antagonist, the cyclo 1–8 [DLeu 5 ]OP (cDOP). Pre-incubation of cultured astrocytes for 30 min with graded concentration (1 pM–1 μM) of cDOP revealed a sensitization of astrocytes to H 2 O 2 , leading to cell death (−39%; p < 0.01) (Fig. 5 b). Fig. 5 Effect of pharmacological blockage of ODN release and activity in cultured rat astrocytes. Cells were pre-treated for 30 min in the absence or presence of the PKA inhibitor H89 (20 μM; a ) or graded concentrations of the metabotropic receptor antagonist cyclo 1–8 [Dleu 5 ] OP (0.001–1000 nM, cDOP; b ) and then incubated for 6 h without ( hatched histograms ) or with 50 μM H 2 O 2 ( filled square ). Cell survival was quantified by measuring FDA fluorescence intensity, and the results are expressed as percentage of controls. Each value is the mean (± SEM) of at least four different wells from three independent experiments.

To corroborate the importance of ODN production in astrocyte resistance to H 2 O 2 , we knocked down the ODN precursor DBI by using siRNA. As illustrated in Fig. 6 a, we confirmed by QPCR that DBI siRNA strongly reduced DBI mRNA level in cultured astrocytes over a period of 72 h. Furthermore, immunocytochemical study showed that the intensity of the labeling of astrocytes with antibodies against ODN was weak compared to astrocytes transfected with non-targeting (Nt) siRNA, and numerous apoptotic cores were observed in pictures from DBI siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 6 b). In contrast, DBI siRNAs have no effect on GFAP labeling. Next, we assayed the capacity of DBI knocked-down astrocytes to survive to a moderate stress induced by 50 μM H 2 O 2 . Within 6 h following the transfection of DBI siRNA, the cell viability was decreased by 16%, compared to astrocytes transfected with Nt siRNA. The exposure of astrocytes to 50 μM H 2 O 2 for 6 h provoked a significant reduction of cell survival (−26%) and an increase in LDH leakage only in DBI siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 6 c, d). Furthermore, the addition of ODN (1 nM) to the culture media completely rescued DBI siRNA-transfected astrocytes from the deleterious effect of 50 μM H 2 O 2 . In agreement with the role of ODN in the regulation of sensitivity to oxidative stress, we have shown that knockdown of DBI resulted in decreased expression of antioxidant enzyme SOD; however, catalase gene transcription was not affected (data not shown).

Protective Effect of Endogenous ODN Released from Astrocytes on H2O2-Treated Neurons
We next examined whether ODN released by astrocytes during a moderate stress could also protect neurons from death induced by H 2 O 2 . As previously shown [ , ], the incubation of cultured cerebellar granule neurons with 50 μM H 2 O 2 for 1 h provoked a decrease (−30%) in the proportion of surviving cells (Fig. 7 ). The treatment of neurons for 1 h with conditioned medium (CM) from 50 μM H 2 O 2 -treated astrocytes rescued neurons from cell death induced by H 2 O 2 . In contrast, CM collected from untreated astrocytes was unable to protect neurons from oxidative damage. To confirm the contribution of endogenous ODN, released from astrocytes, in the protection of neurons, we have used the selective ODN metabotropic receptor antagonist cDOP. Pre-treatment of neurons with cDOP (1 μM), which had no effect by itself on cerebellar granule cell survival, significantly attenuated the protective action of CM from 50 μM H 2 O 2 -exposed astrocytes (Fig. 7 ). Fig. 7 Effects of astrocyte-conditioned media on the resistance of cultured rat cerebellar granule neurons to oxidative stress. Cerebellar granule cells were pre-incubated for 30 min in the absence or in the presence of the metabotropic receptor antagonist cyclo 1–8 [DLeu 5 ] OP (cDOP, 1 μM). Then, neurons were incubated for 1 h with neuron culture medium (NCM), culture media from untreated astrocytes (S1) or from H 2 O 2 -treated astrocytes (S2; 50 μM, 6 h) without ( open square ) or with addition of 50 μM H 2 O 2 ( filled square ).

Discussion
Astroglial cells are critical for brain metabolism and neuron protection against oxidative stress in diverse neuropathological disorders [ , ]. Therefore, the approaches that improve astrocyte survival in cerebral injuries involving oxidative neurodegeneration appear essential to maintain brain functions, and are beneficial to neuronal survival. We have previously reported that the gliopeptide ODN is a potent protective factor against H 2 O 2 -induced oxidative damages, and it promotes cell survival. Here, we showed that endogenous production of ODN, as well as expression of its precursor DBI, were dynamically upregulated in mildly stressed astrocytes, and that ODN acting as an auto/paracrine factor protected astrocytes from oxidative damages, as well as neurons. These data imply that release of ODN could be an endogenous compensatory or protective mechanism in response to the oxidative insults preventing cell death (Fig. 8 ). Fig. 8 Schematic representation of autocrine (glioprotective) and paracrine (neuroprotective) mechanism of octadecaneuropeptide (ODN) against hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) induces astroglial and neuronal oxidative stress. Administration of H 2 O 2 induces intracellular accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS: superoxide anion, O °− 2 ,hydroxyl radical, OH ° ), stimulation of the expression and activity of enzymatic antioxidant systems (superoxide dismutase, SOD; catalase, CAT), and induction of expression of diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI), the precursor of ODN. ODN released by astrocytes in a PKA-dependent manner exerts its glioprotective and neuroprotective activities through activation of the metabotropic receptor (ODN-R).

Despite the absence of effect of 50 μM H 2 O 2 on astrocyte death, we found that the disappearance of H 2 O 2 from the culture medium was associated with a significant increase in intracellular H 2 O 2 . Thereafter, the fall in intracellular H 2 O 2 was immediately followed by a slight increase in superoxides and reactive species. In addition, 50 μM H 2 O 2 increased lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation and induced the dilatation of smooth endoplasmic reticulum and swollen mitochondria, which was consistent with the fact that even at this low concentration, H 2 O 2 induced the hallmarks of an oxidative stress in astrocytes. In addition, these data suggest that astrocytes produce protective factor(s) to rescue cells from this insult. It is well established that activated astrocytes release a variety of neuroprotective and antioxidative molecules as well as neurotrophic factors [ , ]. In particular, numerous data indicate that cultured astrocytes produce DBI-related peptides [ , , ] and we have previously demonstrated that the DBI-fragment ODN is able to protect astrocytes against H 2 O 2 -induced severe oxidative stress [ , ]. Here, by using the SMS approach, we showed that authentic ODN was present in media from cultured astrocytes. Moreover, moderate stress (50 μM H 2 O 2 ) stimulated both DBI expression and ODN release. That increase in DBI mRNA level and ODN release could be responsive to the stimulation of antioxidative defenses in astrocytes is in agreement with the data indicating that (i) the inhibition of DBI gene transcription in H 2 O 2 -treated HEK293 cells is associated with a strong increase in ROS production [ ], (ii) ODN emerges as a potential cytoprotective actor preventing the deleterious action of oxidative stress by blunting intracellular ROS accumulation [ , , ], and (iii) the levels of endozepines, ODN as well as DBI, increase in the plasma or cerebrospinal fluid of patients suffering from pathological disorders related to oxidative stress such as systemic inflammation, hepatic encephalopathy, and neurodegenerative diseases [ , , ].
It has been shown that in response to H 2 O 2 -provoked ROS surproduction, mRNA levels of MnSOD, CuZnSOD, and catalase are increased in cultured cortical astrocytes [ ] leading to a better resistance of cells to oxidative stress. Concurrently, we have observed an increase in levels of antioxidative defenses in H 2 O 2 -treated astrocytes, i.e., H 2 O 2 -induced moderate stress time-dependently enhanced both mRNA levels and activities of SOD and catalase, which coincided with an increase in DBI mRNA level and ODN release. Previous data have indicated that ODN exerts powerful antioxidative effects by stimulating SOD and catalase activities [ ] in normal condition, and by preventing the alteration of gene expression, and activities of enzymatic antioxidant system under strong oxidative stress [ ]. Thus, it appears that upregulation of DBI expression and ODN production induced by moderate stress could enhance the activity of endogenous antioxidative system as a way of defense.
The mechanism by which moderate oxidative stress stimulates the expression of endozepines in astrocytes is currently unknown. In mammalian cells, multiple H 2 O 2 sensors and pathways are involved in the regulation of transcription factors [ ]. In particular, H 2 O 2 increases the translation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus of the transcription factor specificity protein 1 (Sp1), and it has been shown that DBI, SOD, and catalase promoters contain putative sequence for this regulatory element [ , , ]. In addition, the knockdown of Sp1 results in a decrease in DBI , SOD , and catalase expressions, associated with an increase in ROS production, and in H 2 O 2 -induced apoptosis in HEK293 and SNU-C4 cells [ ]. All these data comfort the notion that H 2 O 2 -induced moderate oxidative stress stimulates DBI expression, and as a consequence the production of ODN, in astrocytes.
In order to reinforce the idea that endogenous ODN is involved in the resistance of astrocytes to moderate oxidative stress, ODN release, ODN targeting, or DBI expression has been pharmacologically blocked. Previous studies indicate that induced release of endozepines from astroglial cells is regulated by neuromediators acting through the adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase (PKA) signaling pathway [ , , ]. Moreover, it has been shown that endozepines are released via an unconventional secretory pathway involving the autophagosome [ ], and that this process is PKA-dependent [ ]. The present data indicate that inhibition of PKA activity strengthens the gliotoxic action of H 2 O 2 . Similarly, the administration of the ODN metabotropic receptor antagonist cyclo 1–8 [DLeu 5 ]OP, known to block the glioprotective effect of ODN [ , ], dose-dependently decreased the number of surviving glial cells in conditions of moderate oxidative stress. Finally, we assessed the impact of DBI silencing on the vulnerability of astrocytes to mild oxidative assault. The dramatic decrease of DBI mRNA levels induced by transfection of astrocytes with DBI siRNA coincided with an increase in cell death which paralleled the release of LDH, indicating that the downregulation of the DBI gene led to an increased sensitivity of cells to H 2 O 2 . The cytotoxic effect of 50 μM H 2 O 2 could be due to a decrease in ODN level in the culture medium. In accordance with this hypothesis, we have previously shown that DBI, devoid of peptide signal, and its related peptides are free in the cytoplasm [ ], which implies that the pool of releasable endozepines might be largely dependent on the rate of DBI synthesis. Since astroglial cells’ response to injury in vitro can be sex-specific [ , ], further investigations using sex-specific cell cultures are needed to determine whether the glioprotective effect of ODN on cultured astrocyte may be gender neutral.
A variety of neuroprotective and antioxidative molecules, and neurotrophic factors, released by astroglial cells, exert beneficial effects on neurons and contribute to a decrease in tissue damage [ , , , ]. In fact, we have observed that culture medium from moderately stressed astrocytes, but not from naive astrocytes, promoted neuron survival under oxidative injury. Since the administration of ODN in cultured CGN protected neurons against 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis [ ], we assumed that the peptide ODN, produced by astrocytes during a mild oxidative stress, was at least in part responsible for the neuroprotective effect of astrocyte-conditioned media. In agreement with this notion, the present data show that ODN metabotropic receptor antagonist cyclo 1–8 [DLeu 5 ]OP significantly attenuated the protective action of stressed astrocyte-conditioned medium on granule neurons. The results are also in agreement with data showing that (i) cyclo 1–8 [DLeu 5 ]OP totally abolishes the protective effect of ODN in neurons [ ] and (ii) the concentration of authentic ODN detected in stressed astrocyte media (quantitative SMS experiment) was in the same range (∼ subnanomolar) as that needed to rescue neurons and astrocytes from oxidative injuries [ , ].
In conclusion, this study indicates that the endozepine ODN can be considered as an endogenous protective molecule against oxidative insults. By promoting the tolerance of astrocytes against moderate oxidative stress, ODN may increase the proportion of healthy astrocytes, which possess various neuroprotective properties such as the production of antioxidative and neuroprotective molecules, and thus, it may act directly and indirectly to promote neuron survival. The development of pharmacological agents that can specifically target the activation of the metabotropic ODN receptor could provide a promising therapeutic strategy to protect neurons from oxidative stress and slow down the degenerative process.
