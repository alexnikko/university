Introduction
Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is a heterogeneous group of immunodeficiency disorders united by the laboratory finding of impaired immunoglobulin production [ ]. CVID is characterized by low serum levels of IgG with low serum levels of IgA or low IgM and poor to absent specific antibody production. Although CVID is rare, with a prevalence of 1:25,000 to 1:50,000, it is the most common treatable primary immunodeficiency [ , ]. In cohorts of primarily adult patients at referral centers, approximately half have a phenotype characterized by infections and normal life expectancy and half have autoimmune, inflammatory, or lymphoproliferative complications with major influences on rates of mortality [ , ]. Early descriptions of pediatric CVID emphasized that children may represent a distinct clinical subgroup with poor outcomes and high rates of autoimmunity [ , ]. More recent studies have identified an early-onset peak of CVID diagnosis, suggesting that some monogenic primary immunodeficiencies have been included in these CVID cohorts [ , ]. Monogenic forms of CVID have been largely identified in multiplex kindreds and consanguinous families. A recent study found monogenic defects in 10% of patients with autoimmunity, inflammation, or low B cells and CVID [ ]. It is increasingly important to identify patients with monogenic defects, as potentially disease modifying treatment options are available for this subset of CVID patients. Bone marrow transplantation has been performed in some of the sickest patients with CVID with limited success [ ]. Substantial end organ damage was a major limitation. If pediatric CVID patients will ultimately have serious complications, transplantation might be appropriate and is likely to be more successful before end organ damage occurs. Thus, the severity and phenotype of pediatric CVID are critically important to define.
In 2014, the largest study of CVID to date was published, including data from 2212 patients from the European Society for Immunodeficiencies (ESID) [ ]. The findings suggested that males with early-onset CVID (<10 years) were more susceptible to pneumonia, whereas autoimmune disease and tumors were more associated with later onset disease. These clinical subsets have important prognostic implications, and our current inability to predict outcomes hampers optimal therapy. Therefore, there has been a major effort to identify biomarkers of severe disease. The EUROclass trial associated low switched memory and expanded CD21 low B cell counts with splenomegaly and granulomatous disease [ ]. The DEFI group found infection-only patients to have low switched memory B cell counts, whereas decreased naive CD4+ T cell counts and increased CD4+ CD95+ cell numbers were associated with lymphoproliferation, autoimmune cytopenias, or chronic enteropathy [ ]. Furthermore, the increased CD21 low cell population and decreased T regulatory cells were associated with lymphoproliferation and autoimmune cytopenias. These biomarker studies have had limited validation in pediatric cohorts [ ], thus leaving open the question of early identification of patients with a poor prognosis.
We sought to find similarities and/or disparities across age groups in CVID. Previous studies from European cohorts have found different phenotypes and complications between countries, supporting the need for a specific study of North American patients.
Methods
The United States Immunodeficiency Network (USIDNET) was used to identify individuals with CVID. Patients were enrolled into USIDNET under Institutional Review Board-approved protocols with full patient consent. As of January 2014, 688 registered individuals were identified as having a diagnosis of CVID. The original query was resubmitted to the USIDNET in November 2016. We identified 688 registered individuals with a diagnosis of CVID. We verified with USIDNET that an age of diagnosis of CVID (or other primary immunodeficiency) was recorded for only 497/688 individuals. Therefore, 191 individuals were excluded from analysis. An additional 12 patients had a CVID diagnosis prior to age 2 and were also excluded from initial analysis. At least one infection (e.g., bronchitis, sinusitis, and pneumonia) or medical condition (e.g., asthma, eczema, and lymphoma) was recorded for 635/688 patients. It was unclear whether the 53 individuals without listed infections or medical conditions had no co-morbidities versus no available data; therefore, these individuals were excluded from analysis of infections and conditions versus age. In total, 231 individuals were excluded based on the preceding criteria (Fig. 1 a). For the remaining 457 individuals, we defined four groups according to age of diagnosis, as reported in the registry. Pediatric-onset was defined as a diagnosis occurring in the registry prior to 18 years of age. Early-onset was defined as a diagnosis of CVID at between ages 2 and 10 years. Adolescent-onset was defined as a diagnosis at 11–17 years old, and adult-onset was defined as a diagnosis of CVID occurring at ≥18 years of age. A histogram showing age of diagnosis can be seen in Fig. 1b, for which the Shimazaki method was used to determine optimal bin size [ ]. We performed Chi-squared tests to analyze differences in the presence of additional medical conditions based upon age at diagnosis. In addition, we compared differences in immunoglobulin levels based on age. Fig. 1 a Patient characteristics of the cohort 457 patients with CVID meeting inclusion criteria. Top panel : inclusion and exclusion criteria. Bottom panel : age and gender data for patients with diagnosed conditions and ≥2 years old at time of diagnosis. b Histogram showing distribution of reported age of diagnosis in USIDNET patients with CVID. Patients with diagnosis at age <2 years old were excluded from analysis. The Shimazaki method was used to determine the optimal bin size for this cohort [ ]
Immunoglobulin, lymphocyte, and lymphocyte subset counts were not normally distributed, so either log or square-root transformations were utilized depending on which transformation produced a more normal distribution, in order to facilitate comparison of groups. While each of the transformations provided improvement in approaching the normal distribution, some variables were still slightly skewed after transformation. We then used t tests to compare levels of immunoglobulins, lymphocytes, and lymphocyte subsets by age. For t tests comparing groups with unequal variances, Satterthwaite’s approximation formula was used using Stata’s “unequal” option. All variances were performed using Stata version 13.1. Using the Bonferonni method to adjust for multiple comparisons, statistical significance was set at p < 0.000417 for comparisons of conditions by age, and significance was set at p < 0.00714 for comparisons of immunoglobulin and lymphocyte levels.
Results
A total of 688 individuals had a diagnosis of CVID in USIDNET at the time of our initial query. Age at the time of data entry into USIDNET ranged from 3 to 91 years old. Children with diagnosis at <2 years of age and patients with incomplete data were excluded for a cohort of 457 patients. Age of diagnosis ranged from 2 to 76.9 years. In our cohort, 110 (24.1%) had a diagnosis at 2–10 years old (early onset), 83 (18.2%) had a diagnosis between 11 and 17 years old (adolescent onset), and the majority, 264 patients (57.8%), had a diagnosis at age 18 or older (adult onset) (Fig. 1 a). Fifty-eight percent of patients ( n = 267) were female. Of those diagnosed with early onset CVID, slightly more than half were male patients ( n = 58 or 52.7%) (Fig. 1 b). More female patients were diagnosed with adult onset CVID ( n = 172 or 65.2%). These data may suggest undiagnosed X-linked conditions in the early onset cohort.
Known monogenic defects were reported in 22 patients, including 5 patients (4 female, 1 male) with early onset CVID diagnoses. These monogenic defects included mutations in TACI ( n = 15), NKFB2 ( n = 3), CD19 ( n = 1), chromosomal abnormality ( n = 1), ICOS ( n = 1), and KRAS causing Noonan Syndrome ( n = 1). One patient had a diagnosis of transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy with multiple heterozygous variants of unknown significance. Four additional patients also had other listed diagnoses, but without a confirmed genetic mutation.
Infections
Sinopulmonary infections (sinusitis/rhinosinusitis, pneumonia, and otitis media) were the most commonly reported infections in both pediatric and adult onset CVID patients (Table 1 ). Over half of all patients reported sinusitis and pneumonia. Less common but potentially devastating infections such as CNS infections and sepsis were reported in <10% of patients. The prevalence of otitis media was enriched, as expected, in pediatric onset CVID compared with adult onset CVID (60.6 versus 33.3%, p < 0.0004), while sinusitis was more frequently diagnosed in adult onset CVID (81.4 versus 73.6%, p = 0.045, not statistically significant). Bronchitis was significantly more common in adult onset patients compared with pediatric onset patients (38.6 versus 21.2%, p < 0.0004). Viral respiratory infections, infectious diarrhea, and viral gastroenteritis were common infectious diagnoses in CVID. Central line associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) were only reported in two individuals: an infection of an implanted port and a peripherally inserted central catheter. The circumstances around central line placement (i.e., reason for placement or duration of use) in these individuals were not available.

When considering just the early onset patients vs the rest of the CVID patients, only viral infections were selectively enriched above what was seen for the total pediatric cohort (﻿Supplementary Table 1 ).
Allergy
There were no significant differences between the frequency of allergic diagnoses of asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, or eosinophilic disorders, but some diagnoses tended to be more frequently reported in pediatric onset CVID than adult onset CVID (Table 2 ). Asthma or reactive airway disease was reported slightly more frequently in early onset and adolescent pediatric groups (51 and 46%, respectively) compared with 34% in adult onset CVID. Pulmonary function testing data was not available to further characterize diagnoses of asthma or reactive airway disease in our cohort. In this cohort, pediatric onset CVID patients were more frequently reported to have a documented diagnosis of allergic rhinitis (11 versus 6%, p = 0.062, not statistically significant). Results of skin prick testing or serum specific IgE testing were not available in the USIDNET database to confirm diagnoses of allergic rhinitis, environmental allergies, or food allergies. Allergic rhinitis was most commonly reported in early onset CVID. Eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders (eosinophilic esophagitis, gastritis, and enteritis) were most frequently reported in the early onset CVID population without reaching statistical significance (6.56 versus 2.28%, p = 0.011).

Autoimmunity
Autoimmunity, a major feature of CVID, has been reported as frequently as 25–30% [ , ], even as a first manifestation of CVID [ ] (Table 2 ). Overall, there were no statistically significant differences in reported autoimmune conditions or lymphoproliferation between pediatric and adult onset CVID patients. However, there were trends. Markers of polyclonal lymphocytic infiltration (defined by ESID as unexplained granulomas, splenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy) were all more frequently reported in adult onset CVID than in pediatric onset CVID, but these did not reach statistical significance: splenomegaly (20 versus 10%, p = 0.005), granulomas (9.9 versus 6.2%, p = 0.165), and lymphadenopathy (17.4 versus 11.9%, p = 0.104).
With the exception of thrombocytopenia, cytopenias were reported in both pediatric and adult onset CVID in generally similar frequencies (Table 2 ). Thrombocytopenia was reported slightly more frequently in adult onset CVID patients, without reaching statistical significance. Of note, the absence of autoantibody data prevented us from evaluating each autoimmune cytopenia as a discrete group. Therefore, all diagnoses of anemia (except iron deficiency anemia), neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia were evaluated as individual groups, which likely overestimates the prevalence of autoimmune cytopenias. All types of cytopenias were comparable between patient groups.
Other autoimmune comorbidities had a higher prevalence in the adult onset CVID population (22.7 versus 11.4%, p = 0.006), although these differences were not statistically significant (Table 3 ). The more frequently reported autoimmune disorders included alopecia, psoriasis, sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), celiac disease, vitiligo, uveitis, and Sjogren’s disease. Thyroid disease, including hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and thyroiditis, was reported in 16.3% of adult onset patients, compared with only 6.7% of pediatric onset patients.

In individuals with diagnosis <18 years old, leukemia was the most commonly reported malignancy. In individuals with diagnosis ≥18 years old, the most commonly reported malignancies were basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, thyroid carcinoma, and breast cancer
Colitis and enteritis were reported at similar frequencies between pediatric and adult onset CVID patients. Chronic diarrhea, a potentially overlapping diagnosis with colitis and enteritis, was present in 30% of adult onset CVID patients and nearly 25% of pediatric onset CVID patients.
Lymphoma and Malignancies
Malignancy is a major cause of death in adult onset CVID [ ]. Non-hematologic malignancies were more common in adult onset CVID than pediatric onset CVID (11.4 versus 3.6%, p = 0.003, not statistically significant). Lymphoma was the most commonly reported hematologic malignancy and was more frequently reported in adults (6.8 versus 1.6%, p = 0.008, not statistically significant). Of these, non-Hodgkin B cell lymphomas were the most common. Malignancies in pediatric onset CVID included leukemia, basal cell carcinoma, and melanoma. Reported non-hematologic malignancies in adult onset CVID included skin cancers (basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma), thyroid carcinomas, breast cancer, and unspecified solid tumors (Table 3 ).
Lung Disease
Bronchiectasis was the most commonly reported pulmonary diagnosis in both pediatric onset and adult onset CVID (Table 3 ). It was more commonly reported in adult onset CVID (9.9 vs 4.15%, p = 0.022, not statistically significant), likely reflecting the nature of bronchiectasis as a consequence of long-standing chronic inflammation. Interstitial and restrictive lung diseases were reported in 10% of adult onset CVID patients; lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia was an independent diagnosis in 2.3% of adult onset CVID patients. Twelve patients had a diagnosis of pulmonary nodules; this diagnosis was concomitant with interstitial or restrictive lung disease in 5 of these 12 patients.
Other Sequelae
Failure to thrive and unintentional weight loss were significantly more commonly reported in pediatric onset patients compared with adult onset patients (16.6 versus 5.3%, p < 0.0004). Abdominal pain was a common complaint in both pediatric onset and adult onset patients. Malabsorption was reported in both cohorts and was co-morbid with diagnoses of chronic or non-infectious diarrhea, colitis/enteritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and even eosinophilic esophagitis in two cases (data not shown).
Developmental and psychosocial sequalae were commonly reported (Table 3 ). Developmental delay was reported in significantly more pediatric CVID patients than adults (15 versus 1.0%, p < 0.0004) and included diagnoses of delayed developmental milestones, learning disability, speech delay, and autism. Depression was reported in both pediatric onset and adult onset groups but was far more common in adult onset patients (25 versus 9.8%, p < 0.0001). As previously documented in patients with chronic disease [ ], the subjective symptoms of fatigue, aches, and arthralgia (Table 3 ) were frequently reported but predominantly in the adult onset population.
Immunoglobulin Levels and Lymphocyte Profiles
We evaluated immunoglobulin (Ig) levels and lymphocyte phenotypes in an attempt to better stratify early onset CVID versus pediatric or adult onset CVID. Of note, some patients in our cohort did not have complete laboratory data. A subset of our patients had laboratory values from multiple visits. Serum IgG, IgA, and IgM (mg/dL) and absolute lymphocyte, CD4 T cell, CD8 T cell, and CD19 B cell counts were analyzed from the earliest visit available (Table 4 ).
As expected in CVID, for early onset, pediatric onset, and adult onset groups, mean IgG, IgA, and IgM values were low (reference ranges are available in Supplemental Table 5 ) [ , , ]. The adult onset CVID patients had lower mean IgG, IgA, and IgM compared with the pediatric group; however, this difference was not statistically significant. Of note, the majority of these patients were receiving immunoglobulin (Ig) replacement therapy. We did not evaluate whether the patients were already on Ig therapy at the time of data collection.

For both pediatric onset and adult onset groups, mean B and T lymphocyte counts were largely within the expected range for age. Mean CD4 T cell, CD8 T cell, and CD19 B cell counts were significantly lower in the >11-year-old group, which may reflect expected age-related differences (Table S5 ). To account for age-related differences, we evaluated the number of individuals whose absolute lymphocyte count and absolute T and B cell counts fell below the lower end of normal for age (Table S4 ). We found that a percentage of both pediatric onset and adult onset patients had absolute T and B cell lymphopenia for age (Table S5 ). Compared against each other, the percentage of individuals with lymphopenia in early onset versus pediatric onset and adult onset CVID groups was not statistically significantly different, except in one case: in early onset CVID, the number of individuals with CD4 T cell lymphopenia was significantly less than in the >11-year-old group. Mean CD4 T cell count was significantly higher in early onset CVID compared with the >11-year-old group, reflecting known age effects.
A small subset of patients had significant absolute T cell lymphopenia, which may be representative of a previously undiagnosed combined immunodeficiency. Previous studies have identified a subset of CVID patients with a probable T cell immune defect combined with hypogammaglobulinemia (LOCID, or late onset combined immunodeficiency), manifested by a history of opportunistic infections and/or CD4+ T cell count of <200 × 10 6 [ , ]. In our cohort, we identified 15 patients, ranging in age of diagnosis from 2 to 71 years of age, with a CD4+ T cell count <200 (3.2% of cohort) at the time of data entry. Two patients had a history of opportunistic infection ( Aspergillus brain abscess and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia). One additional patient had a history of opportunistic infection with normal CD4+ T cell count.
Discussion
Previous reports have suggested that age of onset may phenotypically stratify CVID. Using USIDNET data from 457 patients with CVID, we found some differences between adult onset and pediatric onset CVID, some of which did not concur with prior reports [ , , ]. Contrary to prior data, we did not find children and adolescents diagnosed before age 18 to be more affected by infectious or autoimmune complications of CVID than adults. In our cohort, patients with early onset CVID did not have significantly different immunoglobulin or lymphocyte profiles compared with either adolescent onset patients (Supplemental Tables S1 , S2 , S3 ) or the adult onset group. These conclusions, however, must be interpreted cautiously, as this is a cross-sectional study and does not identify early onset or pediatric onset patients who may develop infectious, autoimmune, and/or other comorbidities associated with CVID later in their course of illness.
We identified few statistical differences between pediatric onset and adult onset CVID patients. We did identify trends in differences between pediatric and adult onset CVID patients. Pediatric onset CVID patients were more likely to carry diagnoses more commonly treated in the general pediatric population: otitis media, infectious diarrhea and viral gastroenteritis, viral respiratory infections, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis. Adults with CVID had a higher prevalence of diagnoses that more commonly manifest in older patients: infections with bronchitis and sinusitis, complications of bronchiectasis, splenomegaly, and granulomas, and co-morbid conditions of malignancy, arthritis, arthralgia, depression, and fatigue. Some of these diagnoses may reflect the long-term consequences of subacute, repeated, or chronic infections (bronchiectasis, splenomegaly, and granulomas), underscoring the importance of continued research on immunoglobulin replacement and adjunctive treatments. While differences were identified in different age strata, the overwhelming finding was that the clinical features in early onset, pediatric onset, and adult onset groups were largely comparable. These data do not suggest that early onset diagnosis confers a distinct phenotype. Our data supports the concept that generally, pediatric onset CVID and adult onset CVID are the same condition, representing ends of the age-of-onset spectrum. There are data suggesting that more needs to be done to identify monogeneic conditions within the CVID cohort; the excess of males in the early onset group suggests that there may be X-linked disorders contributing to the early onset phenotype. Additionally, we found a subset of patients with low T cells, suggesting that combined immunodeficiencies or LOCID should be separately considered. In spite of the subset with possible monogenic conditions, these data are reassuring that pediatric onset CVID does not have the feared outcomes distinct from that of adult onset CVID. Nevertheless, there is a need for longitudinal follow-up to define the effects of years of disease burden.
This study also endeavored to characterize the frequency of conditions not typically evaluated in CVID cohort studies, but which are common diagnoses in chronic diseases. For example, “aches” and arthralgia were very common diagnoses reported by adult onset CVID patients. Gene expression studies have identified an immunologic signature of fatigue and fibromyalgia [ , ] with pain and fatigue correlating with poor outcomes in CVID [ ]. This suggests that additional studies on the mechanism of pain and fatigue in CVID are necessary to rationally target interventions. This study highlights the prevalence of depression and anxiety in CVID; depression was reported in nearly one-quarter of adults with CVID and nearly 10% of children and adolescents. This number may be underestimated; in a recent quality-of-life study focused on individuals with CVID, Tabolli et al. suggested that up to one third of patients aged 15–86 were at risk for anxiety/depression at any time during their study observation [ ]. This group also found the risk of anxiety/depression to increase with declining physical health as objectively reflected by decreasing quality-of-life scores [ , ]. In light of this, routine screening for anxiety and depression should be strongly considered in routine health assessments in CVID, especially in adults with multiple co-morbidities, and appropriate referrals to mental health providers and supports should be made.
We did not compare prevalence rates of all diagnoses of infections and conditions reported in our CVID cohort to the general US population, which represents a limitation of this study. Future directions could include comparing the prevalence of common diagnoses in pediatric onset and adult onset CVID with prevalence data for the general population in the USA; potentially, more conditions specific to CVID could be identified and addressed as part of comprehensive CVID care. For example, in our cohort, developmental delay was reported in approximately 17% of children aged 0–10 years, which approximates the prevalence of developmental delay in the USA (14%, [ ]). In our patients, a range of developmental delay phenotypes was reported, including learning disability, speech delay, and autism, but the chronic diagnosis of CVID may further set these patients apart from those without CVID. This would underscore the need for close follow-up with pediatric primary care and supportive therapies.
Other limitations of this study include its cross-sectional nature. Although USIDNET collects data longitudinally, this analysis utilized a cross-sectional approach. Diagnoses were entered by physicians, but no effort was made to validate the diagnoses in this study. Although this represents the largest study of pediatric CVID to date, there were small numbers of patients in certain subgroups, thus limiting the statistical power. Confirming the age of diagnosis and determining an “age of onset” of symptoms can be difficult, especially in a retrospective data analysis such as ours. It is well known that age of diagnosis in CVID commonly lags behind age of onset [ ], so this analysis may underestimate the number of individuals in our cohort with early onset or pediatric onset CVID. In spite of these limitations, this study provides an important perspective on pediatric CVID.
Conclusion
We identified several differences in the USIDNET cohort in the frequency of infectious, autoimmune, and other complications between pediatric and adult onset CVID patients. Nevertheless, the overall landscape of CVID appeared to be similar in children and adults. The enormous diversity and frequency with which allergic, autoimmune, infectious, and malignant conditions and their associated complications are reported in both pediatric and adult patients in this cohort are a sobering demonstration of the protean manifestations of CVID and highlights their impact on quality of life.
Further longitudinal and prospective studies on patients diagnosed in the pediatric years are warranted to better understand the natural history of CVID in these patients and improve our ability to predict disease manifestations and severity.
