Introduction
Multiple sclerosis (MS), the most common demyelinating disease of the central nervous system affecting young adults, is manifested by various combinations of neurological symptoms including motor, sensory, coordination, visual and cognitive impairments (Achiron et al. ; Compston and Coles ; Confavreux and Vukusic ). In the current study, we present an innovative concept based on the knowledge that enhancing naturally occurring biological mechanisms is effective in preventing neuronal damage and maintaining low disease activity in about 15% of MS patients that present the benign pattern of MS (Glad et al. ; Hawkins and McDonnell ; Pittock and Rodriguez ; Poser et al. ; Ramsaransing and De Keyser ).
Recently, we have demonstrated that the blood gene expression profile of low disease activity MS patients is associated with significant down-modulation of RNA polymerase 1 (POL1) molecular pathway and especially its three associated transcripts RNA polymerase I transcription factor 3 (RRN3), RNA polymerase I polypeptide D (POLR1D) and leucine-rich PPR motif-containing protein (LRPPRC). We have demonstrated that RRN3, LRPPRC and POLR1D genes play a key role in the regulation of apoptosis in MS, and their down-expression is associated with suppression of inflammation by down-regulation of NFkB and activation of p53-dependent apoptotic mechanism (Achiron et al. ). Our preliminary data correlate POL1 machinery with MS pathogenesis and propose POL1 pathway as a potential target for therapeutic interventions. Besides, we have demonstrated that administration of specific POL1 inhibitor suppressed experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) induction and reduced disease severity (Achiron et al. , ). To further establish the role of POL1 mechanism in MS pathogenesis, we aimed to affect POL1 pathway-associated molecules by silencing of RRN3, POLR1D and LRPPRC in MOG-specific T lymphocytes and assess their ability to induce EAE by passive transfer.
We investigated the effect of silencing of POL1 pathway-related molecules on viability and apoptosis of murine MOG35-55-primed lymph node cells (LNCs), as well as on cytokine profile and Treg proportion. The potential efficacy of POL1 targeting in MOG-primed LNCs was evaluated in a model of passively induced EAE.
The results support a basis for direct targeting of POL1 transcription pathway as a strategy for selective suppression of inflammation in the animal model of MS and consequently pave the way for innovative and targeted MS therapeutics strategy that is based on naturally existing biological mechanism.
Materials and Methods
Mice
Mice maintenance and experimental protocols were performed in compliance with the Israeli Council for Animal Care guidelines. All studies involving animals are reported in accordance with the ARRIVE guidelines for reporting experiments involving animals. All applicable international, national and/or institutional guidelines for the care and use of animals were followed. All efforts were made to minimize the suffering of animals and the number of animals needed to obtain reliable results. Mice were kept in a pathogen-free environment, maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle at a constant environmental temperature with free access to food and water in their home cages. The study was approved by Sheba IRB Committee for animal experiments.
Silencing Procedure
C57BL/6 J mice were immunized subcutaneously (s.c) with 50 µg of MOG35-55 in complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA). LNCs were isolated from lymph nodes 10 days after immunization and plated at 500,000 cells/well in 96-well plate in stimulation medium [RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 mM pen/strep, 200 nM Glutamax, 100 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 mM nonessential amino acids and β-Me (all from Life Technologies), containing 5 µg/ml MOG35-55 peptide (Hy-labs, Rehovot, Israel] and transfected with siRNA for POLR1D, RRN3 or LRPPRC (100 nM) as compared with appropriate siRNA negative control low GC duplex (Invitrogen, USA. catalog no. 45-2002). For RRN3 and LRPPRC, transfection was done with a mix (1:1:1) of three silencers (see supplementary table 1 for siRNA ID’s and sequences, Invitrogen, USA). The complex of siRNA and the transfection reagent were prepared as described by the manufacturer’s protocol (RNAiMAX, Invitrogen, USA) and added immediately to the wells.
Cells were subjected for lysis and RNA extraction after 72 h. Reverse-transcribed RNA was then subjected for quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) relative to housekeeping gene (actin).
RNA Extraction, cDNA Preparation and RT-PCR
Cells were subjected for total RNA extraction with the ABI 6100 Nucleic Acid PrepStation (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Reverse transcription of RNA was performed with MultiScribe reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to manufacturer’s instruction. A quantitative PCR analysis was performed with a LightCycler 480 thermocycler (Roche, Basel, Switzerland).
Monitoring Cell Viability by XTT
Cell viability was monitored using an XTT cell viability assay kit (Biological Industries Israel Beit-Haemek Ltd., Kibbutz Beit-Haemek, Israel) following the protocols described by the manufacturer. After culturing for 2 or 4 h at 37 °C and then agitating plates gently for 5 min, the absorbance was read at 450 nm using a 96-well plate reader (Tecan Sunrise absorbance reader; Tecan UK).
Flow Cytometric Analysis for Apoptosis, Treg and Cytokines
Murine LNCs were prepared and silenced as described above. Following 72 h of incubation, cells were washed twice with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) buffer (0.1% bovine serum albumin/ in 1 × PBS) and incubated on ice for 30 min. Then, cells were stained with CD4 Ab (APC-conjugated) and with Annexin V (MBL, Medical & Biological Laboratories Co) and propidium iodide (PI) kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Proportions of apoptosis (Annexin V + /PI + ) and live cells were demonstrated as percentage of CD4 + population as compared with siControl-treated cultures. The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined with the FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany) apparatus, and data were analyzed by using CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson). A total of 1 × 10 5 events were collected for each sample.
The fluorochrome-labeled monoclonal antibodies were purchased from BioLegend (San Diego, CA, USA) and used according to the manufacturer’s protocols using the fix/perm set from BioLegend: APC-conjugated anti-CD4, PE-conjugated anti-CD25, PerCP-conjugated anti-IL-4, PE-conjugated anti-IL-10, Alexa488-conjugated anti-IL-17A and PE-conjugated anti-TNFa. Isotype controls were routinely used in all the experiments. In case of intracellular cytokine staining, LNCs were incubated in the presence of 10 µg/ml Brefeldin A (Sigma, Rehovot, Israel) to stop the transport of the cytokine product in the Golgi apparatus for the last 5 h before harvesting.
Intracellular staining for Foxp3 was performed using the Foxp3 Staining Set (BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Passive Transfer of Silenced MOG35-55 LNCs
Female C57Bl/6 J mice were immunized with 50 µg MOG35-55 s.c., and ten days later, lymph nodes were isolated and stimulated with MOG35-55 (20 µg/ml) in the presence of the indicated siRNA duplexes (as described under the silencing procedure section) using the Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent according to the manufacturer’s protocol (125 pmol of specific duplex/well of six-well plate containing 20 × 10 6 LNCs). Si-negative control duplex served as control. After 72-h incubation, LNCs were collected and counted and were injected to tail vein (14 × 10 6 cells/mouse). Mice received 300 ng of pertussis toxin (Sigma, Rehovot, Israel) in 500 µl of PBS per mouse at the day of immunization and 48 h after immunization. Each group includes five mice. Mice were scored daily.

Results are average of three experiments and data presented as mean ± SEM. Analysis was performed using repeated measures ANOVA (two-way ANOVA) implemented in Partek software ( www.partek.com ). For the post hoc analysis, direct comparisons were performed by Student’s two-tailed t -test, p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Results
Silencing of POL1 Genes in MOG35-55-Primed LNCs
After silencing of POLR1D, RRN3 and LRPPRC genes, their expression level decreased by 13.5% ( p = 0.03), 35% ( p = 0.02) and 33.8%, respectively (Fig. 1 a–c) as compared with siControl. In accordance, silencing of POLR1D, RRN3 and LRPPRC genes decreased the expression of downstream pre-rRNA gene by 25.5% ( p = 0.04), 56.3% ( p = 0.007) and 49.1% ( p = 0.007), respectively (Fig. 1 d). Fig. 1 Silencing of POL1 genes in MOG35-55-primed LNCs reduces the transcriptional level of POLR1D ( a ), RRN3 ( b ), LRPPRC ( c ) and pre-rRNA expression ( d ). * p = 0.03, ** p = 0.02, *** p = 0.04 and # p = 0.007
Silencing of POL1 genes decreased the viability of MOG35-55-primed LNCs. As shown in Fig. 2 , viability was significantly decreased by 36% ( p = 0.008) by siPOLR1D, 36% ( p = 0.04) by siRRN3 and by 39% ( p = 0.03) by siLRPPRC. Fig. 2 Silencing of POL1 genes reduced viability of MOG35-55-primed LNCs. Viability of LNCs monitored 72 h following transfection with siRNA for POLR1D, RRN3 and LRPPRC by XTT assay and compared with LNC treated with control siRNA. * p = 0.008, ** p = 0.04 and *** p = 0.03
The effect of POL1-gene silencing on apoptosis was demonstrated by significant increase in the proportion of CD4 + /Annexin V + /PI + apoptotic cells by 30% ( p = 0.04) after siPOLR1D, 46% ( p = 0.02) after siRRN3 and 43% ( p = 0.03) after siLRPPRC (Fig. 3 ). Fig. 3 Silencing of POL1 genes induced apoptosis in MOG35-55-primed CD4 + LNCs.

Apoptotic cells were quantified 72 h following silencing. * p = 0.02, ** p = 0.03 and *** p = 0.04
Lack of POL1 expression affects expression of IL-4, IL-10, IL-17 and TNFa cytokines by CD4 + lymphocytes. Silencing of POLR1D, RRN3 and LRPPRC significantly decreased the proportion of CD4 + IL17 + lymphocytes by 63.5, 72.2 and 68.5%, respectively, as compared with siControl ( p ≤ 0.03, Fig. 4 a). Inversely, the proportions of CD4 + IL10 + lymphocytes were significantly increased by 74.2, 69.6 and 64.7% after siPOLR1D, siRRN3 ( p < 0.03) and siLRPPRC ( p = 0.05) as compared with siControl (Fig. 4 b). The proportions of CD4 + TNFa + lymphocytes were also increased by 51.7, 45.8 and 56% after siPOLR1D ( p = 0.05), siRRN3 ( p < 0.03) and siLRPPRC ( p < 0.03) as compared with siControl (Fig. 4 c). Silencing of POL1 genes did not affect the proportions of CD4 + IL4 + lymphocytes (Fig. 4 d). Fig. 4 Silencing of POL1 genes modulate cytokine expression in MOG35-55 CD4 + LNCs. MOG35-55 LNCs from siPOLR1D, siRRN3, siLRPPRC or control siRNA-transfected cultures were analyzed by flow cytometry. Cells were stained for CD4 and intracellularly with IL-17 ( a ), IL-10 ( b ), TNFa ( c ) or IL-4 ( d ). * p ≤ 0.05 and ** p ≤ 0.03
The increased proportion of IL10 and decreased proportion of IL-17A-expressing CD4 + lymphocytes occurred simultaneously with modulation in Treg CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 + cells. The proportions of CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 + lymphocytes were increased by 21.3, 25.1 and 25.0% after siPOLR1D ( p < 0.02), siRRN3 ( p < 0.05) and siLRPPRC ( p < 0.05) as compared with siControl (Fig. 5 ).

Cells were stained for CD4, CD25 and intracellular with FoxP3. * p < 0.02 and ** p < 0.05
Passive Transfer of MOG35-55-Primed LNCs After POL1-gene Silencing Suppressed EAE Development in Mice
Onset of passive EAE was delayed in mice administered with MOG35-55-primed LNCs silenced by POLR1D, RRN3 or LRPPRC genes by 5.5 days ( p = 0.0009), 9.5 days (1.6 × 10 −5 ) and 7.0 days ( p = 0.0003) after transfer as compared with control mice administered siControl-treated LNCs (Table 1 ). Peak of EAE was significantly delayed by siRRN3 (mean day 19.8 ± 1.4; p = 0.004) and siLRPPRC (mean day 18.3 ± 1.1; p = 0.01) as compared with mean day 14.7 ± 0.6 in control mice. POL1-gene silencing decreased EAE clinical severity as shown by significantly lower maximal clinical score of 1.3 ± 0.2, 0.6 ± 0.2 and 1.3 ± 0.3 after siPOLR1D, siRRN3 and siLRPPRC, respectively, as compared with maximal score of 2.9 ± 0.2 ( p < 1.0 × 10 −5 ) in the siControl-treated group. In accordance, lower cumulative disease score was observed after siPOLR1D (7.7 ± 1.4, p = 1.8 × 10 −6 ), siRRN3 (4.3 ± 1.3, p = 2.4 × 10 −8 ) and siLRPPRC (7.5 ± 1.7, p = 7.8 × 10 −6 ), as compared with the cumulative disease score of 21.5 ± 2.0 in control group (Fig. 6 ).

Discussion
In the current study, we have demonstrated that silencing of specific POL1 pathway-related genes in MOG35-55-primed LNCs inhibited the development of EAE following LNCs passive transfer. These results prove the significant role of POL1 expression machinery and associated ribosomal biogenesis in MS disease development and suggest the suppression of POL1 genes as a strategy to modify disease activity. POL1 is essential factor for supplying the rRNA for ribosomal biogenesis that requires large quantities of genes and takes place mainly within the nucleoli of eukaryotes (Goodfellow and Zomerdijk ). The role of inhibition of RNA POL1 pathway in the regulation of the ongoing disease activity in MS by suppression of inflammation and enhancement of apoptosis of autoreactive lymphocytes has been recently uncovered (Achiron et al. ). In our previous studies, we challenged these findings and assessed the efficacy of inhibition of RNA POL1 pathway in alleviating EAE (Achiron et al. , ). We showed that a potent and selective inhibitor of RNA POL1 mechanism significantly suppressed the development of EAE and ameliorated the ongoing disease. However, EAE treatment based on systemic (oral or IV) administration of POL1 inhibitors could lead to uncontrolled suppression of POL1 mechanism in non-disease-involved cells. Therefore, here we have applied an advantageous approach enabling a focused suppression of POL1-related genes in pathogenic MOG35-55-primed LNCs that render the disease without affecting ribosomal biogenesis in other cells.
Because LNCs were MOG35-55 primed and silenced for POL1-related genes before transfer, the model of passive EAE presented an effector stage of disease in which primed but siRNA-modified LNCs were unable to induce EAE. This model better resembles clinical practice, whereby MS patients are subjected to treatment only after immune activation stage.
Silencing of RRN3, POLR1D and LRPPRC genes was investigated in primed MOG35-55 LNCs as a mean to down-regulate the proliferative response of reactive lymphocytes and preferentially induce these activated cells to undergo apoptosis. As expected, the in vitro experiments demonstrated that silencing of POL1 genes was efficient and resulted in reduced expression of the targeted genes as well as reduced viability of the silenced LNCs via increased apoptosis. These results are in line with our previous study that showed activation of apoptosis of CD4 + cells after RRN3 silencing in PBMC of RRMS patients (Achiron et al. ).
Activation of p53-dependent apoptosis associated with suppression of ribosome biogenesis as a result of rRNA inhibition following the knockout of TIF-1A (RRN3) (Yuan et al. ) or the transient knockdown of RNA POL1 catalytic subunit POLR1A (Donati et al. ) was previously reported (Golomb et al. ).
We have found that under-expression of POL1 genes resulted in Th1/Th2 cytokines modulation with prevalence of Th2 cytokine expression associated with increased presence of Tregs. Assuming that silencing of POL1-related genes mainly targets the rapidly proliferating and encephalitogenic cells to undergo apoptosis, this shifted cytokine profile is likely attribute to the remaining non-encephalitogenic CD4 + population resulting in ameliorating EAE.
While both pathogenic and protective functions were described for TNFa in neuroinflammation (protective in lymphoid organs and pathogenic in CNS) and particularly disease exacerbation in TNF knockout mice (Kruglov et al. ), the overexpression of TNFa with the simultaneous overexpression of IL-10 as well as the observed amelioration of disease severity in the present study suggests that TNFa is likely to counteract the ongoing inflammatory response (Kruglov et al. ). Intriguingly, defects in ribosomal biogenesis associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress have been reported to elicit inflammatory cytokines as in various ribosomopathies (Moon ); however, by siRNA targeting of specific subpopulation of immune cells before adoptive transfer we bypassed such outcome.
The effect of RRN3 gene silencing on EAE development was superior over that of POLR1D and LRPPRC as reflected by longer delay in disease onset, and lower maximal and cumulative disease scores. RRN3 is a RNA POL1-associated transcription factor that is essential for ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transcription (Stepanchick et al. ). RRN3 bridges between RNA POL1 and the transcription factors bound to the committed template (Stepanchick et al. ) and accordingly mediates an interaction between the RRN3-POL1 complex and SL1, the rDNA transcription factor that binds to the core promoter element of the rDNA. Randomization or deletion of the amino acids in this region in RRN3, amino acids 382–400, abrogated its ability to bind DNA, indicating that this domain is an important contributor to DNA binding by RRN3 (Stepanchick et al. ). The finding that of the three silenced POL1 genes, RRN3 is the only one with DNA binding region, explains its crucial role in ribosomal biogenesis and therefore its efficacy in inhibiting EAE. Yet, our results suggest that silencing of each RRN3, POLR1D or LRPPRC gene can suppress full-blown EAE.
To conclude, suppression of EAE by POL1 silencing approach in MOG35-55 LNCs before passive transfer implicated the therapeutic value of POL1 pathway targeting to ameliorate MS and suggest prospective therapy based on suppression of specific POL1 activity.
