Introduction
Advanced epithelial ovarian cancers constitute more than 60% of ovarian cancers with a 5-year survival rate of 29.2% [ ]. More than 75% of patients who achieve remission after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and cytoreduction ultimately relapse. Residual disease after cytoreduction is the most important survival determinant [ , , ]. In addition, FIGO Stage, histological type, sensitivity to platinum are independent risk factors for relapse [ ]. Strategies to improve survival include addition of intraperitoneal chemotherapy and targeted therapy to optimal cytoreduction in stage III ovarian cancers [ ]. Our study aims to find out the progression-free survival and overall survival of advanced ovarian cancers after standard therapy in a South Indian population.
Materials and Methods
We retrospectively collected data from April 2015 till August 2018 (40 months) through medical records, case sheets, histopathology reports, outpatient follow-up records. All patients who underwent surgery for ovarian cancers staged III/IV were included in the study. Demographic data, pathological variables, neoadjuvant treatment details, treatment response, type of surgery, pattern of relapse, and survival status were collected. Patients with stage III/IV were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy paclitaxel (175 mg/m 2 ) and carboplatin (AUC 4 to 6) for three to four cycles, and response was assessed based on RECIST and GCIG criteria [ ]. Patients with a clinical response after three to four cycles proceeded to cytoreductive surgery. Patients with suboptimal response as deemed by the surgical team received further cycles of same or second-line chemotherapy. In this study, optimal cytoreduction was defined as leaving behind no residual disease at surgery. The progression-free survival was calculated based on GCIG criteria, and overall survival was calculated from date of diagnosis to death. All patients were followed up with CA 125 levels, CT imaging every three months, and were treated with second-line chemotherapy with or without secondary cytoreductive surgery at the time of relapse.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were calculated using SPSS version 25 software. Chi-squared tests were used for categorical variable. Independent t tests were used to compare means. Kaplan–Meier curves were used for survival analysis between two groups, Cox regression proportional hazards for hazard ratios, and Wilcoxon and log-rank tests for significance.
Results
A total of 111 patients were operated in our department with a median age of 53 years at presentation. Six patients were lost to follow-up. The majority were staged as IIIC (82%), presented with ascites (71.1%) and the predominant histology being serous carcinoma (67%); 107 patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, half received three to four cycles of chemotherapy, and the remaining received six cycles or more prior to cytoreductive surgery. The median pre- and post-chemotherapy CA 125 level was 694 IU/L and 33.5 IU/L, respectively, with an inter-quartile range of 931 IU/L and 61 IU/L, respectively. Clinically and radiologically, response to chemotherapy was seen in 88 patients (82%) in which 50 patients received 3–4 cycles and 38 patients in 6 cycles or more. Progression on chemotherapy was noted in 19 patients (18%) with 8 patients in 3 to 4 cycles group and 11 patients in 6 cycles or more group.
Intraoperatively, 43 patients (39%) had residue in both ovaries, pelvic deposits in 29 patients (26.1%), peritoneal with omental deposits in 17 patients (15.8%), and no residual disease in 12 patients (11.2%). Optimal cytoreduction was achieved in 87.6% of patients and suboptimal cytoreduction in 12.4%. Two patients had to undergo bowel resections to achieve optimal cytoreduction. Two patients received intraperitoneal chemotherapy following optimal cytoreduction using injection cisplatin 100 mg/m 2 through Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy machine from Boston Ivy Healthcare.
In ten patients, pelvic lymphadenectomy was omitted as there were no significant nodes at optimal interval cytoreduction. Mean nodal harvest was 10 nodes (6 on left side and 4 on right side). Major histological type was serous in 71% and endometrioid in 16%. Pathological complete response was confirmed in 13% of patients. Eight patients (7.2%) had microscopic nodal disease during histopathological evaluation. Four patients had primary debulking surgery and achieved optimal cytoreduction.

At a median follow-up of 24 months, relapse was noted in 31 patients (29.5%). Relapse occurred in 26% (24 patients) in optimally cytoreduced patients and 53% (seven patients) in suboptimally cytoreduced ( P0 .04). There was no statistically significant difference in recurrence with regard to stage III or IV, number of chemotherapeutic cycles, whether or not pelvic lymphadenectomy was done. In patients where pelvic lymphadenectomy is omitted, three out of ten (30%) patients had pelvic nodal recurrence. Patients who underwent optimal cytoreduction had lower recurrence rates with P 0.04, and high-grade serous histology had increased recurrence rates P 0.04. Analysis of recurrence patterns is shown in Table 2 .

The median progression-free survival was 30 months (95% CI: 26.5–34.5; Hazard ratio 0.6) in optimally cytoreduced versus 13 months (95% CI: 10.3–15.4; Hazard ratio 1.2) in suboptimal cytoreduced patients ( P 0.005). Kaplan–Meier curve for progression-free survival is shown in Fig. 1 . Fig. 1 Kaplan–Meier curve showing progression-free survival benefit in optimally cytoreduced patients
A total of 30 patients had succumbed to disease (24 patients in optimally cytoreduced and 6 in suboptimally cytoreduced group) with a mortality rate of 28.5%. The median overall survival was 36 months (95% CI: 32–39; hazard ratio 0.70) in the optimally cytoreduced versus 19 months (95% CI: 17.6–20.3; hazard ratio 1.35) in the suboptimal cytoreduced patients ( P 0.001).

Discussion
In this study, disease onset was noted at younger age of 54 years compared to 63 years worldwide. Optimal cytoreduction were achieved in 87.6% patients, with improved progression-free survival and overall survival noted in the optimally cytoreduced than suboptimally cytoreduced patients.
Worldwide, the median age at diagnosis of ovarian cancer was 63 years and median age at death was 70 years with a 5-year overall ovarian cancer survival of 47.4% [ ]. The median age at diagnosis in our study patients was 53 years which reflects early onset in Indian population as being mentioned in various Indian studies [ , , ]. In our study, the majority of patients were able to complete the planned cycles of chemotherapy without major toxicities and the response to chemotherapy either partial or complete was noted in 88% of patients. 12% of patients had progressive disease to paclitaxel and carboplatin requiring second-line drugs. This high response rate perhaps translated to better optimal cytoreduction rate of 87.6% of patients than observed in the published literature [ ].
During surgery, bilateral pelvic nodal dissection was done as part of interval cytoreduction considering risk of microscopic nodal positivity in 56% from larger studies [ ]. Our present study has lower nodal positivity rate of 7.2% possibly due to better response to chemotherapy or pathological sampling errors. With the evidence from our previous pilot study with a microscopic nodal positivity of 3% following interval cytoreductive surgery, we omitted pelvic nodal dissection in ten patients who had no grossly abnormal nodes at surgery [ ]. However three out of ten patients (30%) developed pelvic nodal recurrence on followup which was high compared to LION trial by Harter et al. Consequent to these findings we reinstated pelvic nodal dissection as a part procedure during interval cytoreductive surgery.
Our study population had a relapse rate of 29.5% at a median follow-up of 24 months with significantly higher relapse rates in patients who were suboptimally cytoreduced ( P 0.005). The majority of our patients were in the platinum-sensitive disease during relapse reflecting lower platinum refractory disease in South India. Relapse rates were higher for higher-staged FIGO cancers, high-grade histology, and suboptimal cytoreduced patients as per various Indian studies [ , ].
The overall median progression-free survival of 15 months was considered equivalent to progression-free survival in larger international and apex cancer institutes from India [ , , ]. Two patients required secondary optimal cytoreduction as complete resection has longer overall survival in platinum-sensitive and refractory relapse [ ]. The median overall survival was statistically significantly higher in patients with optimal cytoreduction than suboptimal cytoreduction with overall median survival of 22 months as against 30 months in larger trials [ ]. Patients who underwent primary cytoreductive surgery were alive, and no recurrent disease was noted during follow-up. However, only four patients underwent primary cytoreductive surgery; hence, larger and equal distribution of samples needed to prove progression-free and overall survival benefit compared to interval cytoreduction.
Conclusion
Patients achieving optimal cytoreduction after neoadjuvant chemotherapy have significantly lower recurrence rates, higher progression-free survival, and overall survival rates than who are suboptimally cytoreduced. Results from our centre are equivalent to apex centres in India.
