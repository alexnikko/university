Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second most common primary hepatic malignancy in children after hepatoblastoma and the most common primary hepatic malignancy in children older than 5 years [ , ]. HCC in children may present with clinical symptoms, such as a palpable mass or abdominal pain, or may be detected during screening of an at-risk population [ ]. Pediatric HCC differs from adult-type HCC in several important ways [ , ]. First, while cirrhosis is the most common risk factor for HCC in adults, preexisting liver disease is present in only about 25–40% of children with HCC [ ]. Indeed, fibrolamellar HCC, a relatively rare subtype, occurs almost exclusively in adolescents and young adults without underlying chronic liver disease [ ]. Second, the spectrum of risk factors predisposing to HCC in children is different from that in adults. Such risk factors include chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV), particularly within endemic regions; inherited metabolic disorders (e.g., tyrosinemia), cholestatic liver disease (e.g., biliary atresia, Alagille syndrome, progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis) and cardiac cirrhosis (e.g., secondary to congenital heart disease) [ ].
Among adults, HCC can be accurately diagnosed on imaging due to its characteristic appearance on multiphasic computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [ ]. Accordingly, the Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) was developed by the American College of Radiology (ACR) to standardize the imaging diagnosis of HCC in adults with established risk factors for HCC, specifically cirrhosis or chronic HBV [ , ]. However, the LI-RADS algorithm has not been validated in a pediatric population and, therefore, no guidelines exist to standardize the diagnosis of HCC in pediatric patients [ ]. Furthermore, children have a higher percentage of cirrhosis secondary to vascular disorders (e.g., cardiac cirrhosis) than adults. These etiologies of cirrhosis are associated with the formation of benign hyperplastic nodules that can mimic HCC on imaging [ ]. Finally, HCC in patients without cirrhosis, as is more common among children than adults, may be more likely to have atypical imaging features compared to HCC in patients with cirrhosis [ , ].
Thus, the aim of our study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and inter-rater reliability of LI-RADS version 2017 (v2017) for the diagnosis of HCC in a pediatric cohort. A secondary aim was to determine whether the diagnostic accuracy of LI-RADS is improved in children with risk factors for focal liver lesion(s), and/or in children older than 5 years given the rarity of HCC in the first 5 years of life.
Materials and methods
Study cohort
This retrospective study was performed in compliance with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and received a waiver of informed consent by our institutional review board. Two authors not involved in the LI-RADS assessment (E.R., a third-year medical student, and E.K.R., a fourth-year radiology resident) conducted a retrospective search of the radiology information system (RIS) at a tertiary-care pediatric hospital to identify all radiology studies that reported a focal liver lesion on a liver protocol CT or MRI examination. Results were limited to a 10-year period (September 2006 to August 2016). Inclusion and exclusion criteria are detailed in Table 1 . Notably, in order to focus our study on primary hepatic lesions, patients were excluded if they had a known or strongly suspected active extrahepatic malignancy at the time of imaging acquisition. In patients with more than one lesion, a single lesion was selected for inclusion using a random number generator to avoid bias related to the greater tendency of certain types of lesions (e.g., focal nodular hyperplasia) to exist in multiplicity. Table 1 Inclusion and exclusion criteria Inclusion criteria • All radiology reports associated with DCE abdominal CT or MRI examination codes from September 2006 through August 2016. • At least one space-occupying liver lesion described in report. • DCE abdominal CT or MRI adequate for LI-RADS assessment. • Acceptable standard of reference for lesion diagnosis: - Pathology specimen deemed sufficient for interpretation. - Follow-up imaging study obtained at least 1 year after study used for LI-RADS assessment showing stable or decreased size of lesion (used to classify lesions as benign only). • Age ≤18 years at the time of examination eligible for LI-RADS assessment. Exclusion criteria • Known or strongly suspected active extrahepatic primary malignancy (i.e. liver metastasis strongly suspected at the time of imaging acquisition)*. • Studies available for LI-RADS assessment not performed before initiation of treatment for the liver lesion. • No clear radiologic correlate for lesion described on pathology. * Patients with remote histories of malignancy were eligible for inclusion on a case-by-case basis, depending on the degree of clinical suspicion for recurrent disease. Notably, liver metastases were eligible for inclusion if the patient was not thought to have a primary malignancy outside of the liver at the time of tissue submission to pathology. However, there were no such patients/lesions in our cohort CT computed tomography, DCE dynamic contrast-enhanced, LI-RADS Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System, MRI magnetic resonance imaging
Reference standard
Histopathology was used as the reference standard for lesions that underwent surgical resection or percutaneous biopsy. All histological evaluation was performed by an institutional pediatric or liver pathologist as part of routine clinical care. For cases without tissue sampling, a lesion was considered benign if it was unchanged or decreased in size on follow-up imaging for ≥12 months. Otherwise, cases without tissue sampling were excluded. If a patient had multiple observations on imaging, only those lesions with dedicated pathology available or ≥12 months imaging stability were eligible for inclusion in the study cohort. In other words, no inferences were made regarding the etiology of an unsampled lesion on the basis of the histological results for a sampled lesion.
Image acquisition & study selection
Liver protocol dynamic contrast-enhanced CT and MRI were performed according to the parameters detailed in Table 2 . Images were obtained in the hepatobiliary phase using gadobenate dimeglumine (MultiHance; Bracco Diagnostics, Inc., Monroe Township, NJ) or gadoxetate (Eovist; Bayer HealthCare, LLC, Whippany, NJ) in 17 of 38 (45%) of the MRI examinations. In cases for which pathology served as the reference standard, the dynamic contrast-enhanced study performed immediately before surgical sampling was selected for LI-RADS assessment. However, in cases for which imaging follow-up served as the reference standard, the earliest dynamic contrast-enhanced study capturing the lesion of interest was selected for LI-RADS assessment to allow for the longest period of follow-up.

LI-RADS assessment
One fellowship-trained abdominal radiologist and one fellowship-trained pediatric radiologist (K.E.F. and G.K., with 7 and 14 years of post-training experience, respectively, and initials withheld for blinding) served as Reader 1 and Reader 2, respectively. Both readers performed image interpretation independently and were blinded to all clinical information other than patient age and gender. Readers had access to the immediate prior imaging study (when available) for threshold growth assessment. Readers were asked to evaluate only the observation of interest and did not score additional observations. Readers were directed to the observation of interest using the series/image number, liver segment and additional spatial information if multiple observations were present. Each observation was assessed according to LI-RADS v2017, with scoring of all major, LR-M (LI-RADS likely Malignant [not specific for HCC]), and ancillary features and assignment of an overall LI-RADS category. Tie-breaking rules and category adjustments were made according to LI-RADS methodology. For reference, the LI-RADS categories are defined in Fig. 1 . Fig. 1 LI-RADS (Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System) categories with interpretations. HCC hepatocellular carcinoma
Risk stratification
Risk factors for chronic liver disease were collected via review of the clinical chart by an author (E.K.R.) uninvolved in LI-RADS assessment. Risk status was based on the presence versus absence of known risk factors for any liver lesion (i.e. not specifically HCC) [ , ]. Note that this risk stratification approach differs from the approach focused solely on HCC risk factors described by LI-RADS v2017 for adults. Our modified approach was selected on the basis of the very low frequency of these LI-RADS v2017 risk factors in our patient population. During imaging review, readers also assessed each patient for radiologic evidence of underlying chronic liver disease, including hepatic steatosis (drop in liver signal on opposed-phase imaging), fibrosis/cirrhosis (nodular contour of the liver or signs of segmental atrophy/hypertrophy) and portal hypertension (imaging evidence of varices or splenomegaly). However, this information was not used for risk stratification due to the lack of a validated methodology for imaging-based risk factor assessment among pediatric patients.
Statistical analysis
Cohen’s κ test was used to assess the inter-rater reliability for categorical variables such as LI-RADS score, whereas intraclass correlation coefficient was used to assess the inter-rater absolute agreement for continuous variables such as maximum diameter. A weighted κ was used to calculate agreement for overall LI-RADS category using the Fleiss-Cohen method [ ]. All other κ results are not weighted. Agreement was scored as poor (κ<0.00), slight (=0.00–0.20), fair (κ=0.21–0.40), moderate (κ=0.41–0.60), substantial (κ=0.61–0.80) or almost perfect (κ=0.81–1.00) [ ]. Confidence intervals (CI) for sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated according to the methods in Mercaldo et al. [ ]. Subgroup analysis was performed for patients who were deemed to be at risk for the development of focal liver lesions, as described above. Subgroup analysis was also performed for patients >5 years of age, as HCC very rarely occurs among patients ≤5 years of age. All statistical analyses were performed using R Studio (version 1.1.456; R Development Core Team, New Zealand).
Results
Study cohort
The cohort included 41 patients (Table 3 ). A slight majority was female ( n =26, 63.4%), and the mean age was 9.3±6.6 years (range: 0–17 years). Of the 41 patients, 20 (49%) had risk factors for focal liver lesions. According to clinical history, cirrhosis was present in 3 of 41 (7%) patients. However, Reader 1 and Reader 2 both scored 8 of 41 (20%) patients as having cirrhosis by imaging. After random exclusion of all but one lesion for patients with multiple liver lesions satisfying our inclusion criteria ( n =17), there were 41 liver lesions among these 41 patients (Fig. 2 ). Notably, for all patients with multiple lesions, the excluded lesion(s) had the same diagnosis as the randomly selected included lesion, based on our reference standard. Table 4 shows the number of included lesions with each diagnosis, stratified by their standard of reference. Of the included lesions, 27 of 41 (66%) had an acceptable pathological reference standard, whereas 14 of 41 (37%) had acceptable imaging follow-up to establish benignity. HCC constituted 3 of 41 (7%) liver lesions; 2 were fibrolamellar HCC and 1 was classic HCC. Non-HCC malignancy comprised 8 of 41 (20%) liver lesions, most frequently hepatoblastoma (7 of 8, 88%). Benign lesions comprised 30 of 41 (73%) total lesions, most commonly focal nodular hyperplasia or probable focal nodular hyperplasia (9 of 30, 30%). Of the imaging studies used for LI-RADS assessment, the majority were MRI (38 of 41, 93%).

Inter-rater reliability of LI-RADS assessment
Table 5 illustrates the inter-rater reliability of the LI-RADS categories for the two readers. Agreement for the overall LI-RADS category was substantial (weighted κ=0.62). Similarly, agreement for categorizing a lesion as LR-5 (LI-RADS definitely HCC [100% certainty]), LR-M or LR-TIV (LI-RADS definite tumor in vein [not specific for HCC]) (i.e. likely or definitely malignant, but not necessarily HCC) versus the other LI-RADS categories was substantial (κ=0.66). For categorizing a lesion as LR-5 or LR-TIV (definitely due to HCC) (i.e. definite HCC, with or without associated TIV) versus the other LI-RADS categories, agreement was moderate (κ=0.55). Finally, for categorizing a lesion as LR-4 (LI-RADS likely HCC), LR-5, LR-M or LR-TIV (i.e. likely or definitely malignant, but not necessarily HCC) versus the other LI-RADS categories, agreement was also moderate (κ=0.57).

Diagnostic performance of LI-RADS assessment
Figure 3 shows the number of observations assigned to each LI-RADS category by Reader 1 and Reader 2 (stratified by diagnosis according to the reference standard). Table 6 shows the diagnostic performance of LI-RADS for the prediction of HCC. Specificity of LR-5 or LR-TIV (definitely due to HCC) as a predictor of HCC was high (84% and 97% for Reader 1 and Reader 2, respectively). However, given the low prevalence of HCC, PPV was only 33% and 75% for Reader 1 and Reader 2, respectively. Reader 1 had six false-positive observations, two of which were non-HCC malignancies (both hepatoblastoma) and four of which were benign lesions (nodular cirrhosis, macroregenerative nodule, focal nodular hyperplasia and hepatocellular adenoma). Reader 2 had only one false-positive observation, a benign lesion (hepatocellular adenoma). All HCCs were categorized as LR-5 or LR-TIV (definitely due to HCC) by both readers, corresponding to a sensitivity of 100% and an NPV of 100%. Figure 4 shows a fibrolamellar HCC scored as LR-5 by both reviewers, whereas Fig. 5 shows a benign lesion (hepatocellular adenoma) scored as LR-5 by both reviewers. Fig. 3 Frequencies of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), non-HCC malignancy and benign lesions by LI-RADS (Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System) category. The numbers of lesions assigned by Reader 1 (R1) and Reader 2 (R2) to each LI-RADS category are shown. The horizontal bars, which are normalized to 100%, display the relative frequencies of HCC, non-HCC malignancy and benign masses within each LI-RADS category.

The patient is a 17-year-old girl with no risk factors for liver lesions in general or for HCC. T2-weighted ( a ), pre-contrast T1-weighted vibe (volumetric interpolated breath-hold examination) ( b ), arterial phase T1-weighted vibe ( c ) and portal venous phase T1-weighted vibe ( d ) MR images demonstrate an observation encompassing a large portion of the right hemiliver ( arrows ), scored by both readers as having non-rim arterial phase hyperenhancement, washout and an enhancing capsule Fig. 5 Example benign lesion scored as LR-5 (definitely HCC [100% certainty]) by both reviewers. The patient is a 15-year-old girl without risk factors for liver lesions in general or for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Pre-contrast T1-weighted VIBE (volumetric interpolated breath-hold examination) ( a ), arterial phase T1-weighted VIBE ( b ) and delayed phase T1-weighted VIBE ( c ) MR images demonstrate an observation ( arrows ) in segment 3 with non-rim arterial phase hyperenhancement and washout. Reader 2 appreciated an enhancing capsule, whereas Reader 1 believed the capsule was non-enhancing. In-phase ( d ) and opposed-phase ( e ) images demonstrate signal loss on the opposed-phase, consistent with microscopic fat. Both readers scored this observation as LR-5; however, resection demonstrated an HNF-1α (hepatocyte nuclear factor – 1 alpha) mutated hepatocellular adenoma. Notably, hepatocellular adenomas, particularly those of this particular subtype, are known to exhibit many of the same imaging features as HCC. In adults, the distinction between these two diagnoses depends primarily on pre-test probability, as hepatocellular adenomas are much less common than HCCs in the LI-RADS (Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System) target population (e.g., patients with cirrhosis). This approach may be less effective in a general pediatric population given the high incidence of hepatocellular adenomas relative to HCCs
The sensitivity of LR-M or LR-TIV (possibly due to non-HCC malignancy) for predicting non-HCC malignancy was moderately high (75% and 86% for Reader 1 and Reader 2, respectively). Specificity of LR-M or LR-TIV (possibly due to non-HCC malignancy) for predicting non-HCC malignancy was similarly high (81% and 91% for Reader 1 and Reader 2, respectively). However, categorization as LR-5, LR-M or LR-TIV (i.e. likely or definitely malignant, but not necessarily HCC) for predicting any malignancy had sensitivity of 100% and 90% for Reader 1 and Reader 2, respectively, and an NPV of 100% and 96% for Reader 1 and Reader 2, respectively; specificity was 67% and 87% for Reader 1 and Reader 2, respectively. Figure 6 shows a representative hepatoblastoma scored as LR-M by both readers. On the other hand, categorization of an observation as LR-1 (LI-RADS definitely benign [100% certainty]), LR-2 (LI-RADS likely benign) or LR-3 (LI-RADS intermediate likelihood of HCC) was highly specific for benignity (100% and 90% for Reader 1 and Reader 2, respectively). One malignant rhabdoid tumor was scored by Reader 2 as LR-2 due to its marked T2-hyperintensity (Fig. 7 ). Fig. 6 Representative hepatoblastoma scored as LR-M (likely malignant) by both reviewers. The patient is a 14-year-old boy with no risk factors for liver lesions in general or for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). T2-weighted ( a ), pre-contrast T1-weighted VIBE (volumetric interpolated breath-hold examination) ( b ), arterial phase T1-weighted VIBE ( c ) and portal venous phase T1-weighted VIBE ( d ) MR images demonstrate a large observation in the left hemiliver ( arrows ). Reader 1 scored this observation as having no specific LR-M features but reported that the observation was suspicious for hepatoblastoma. Note that LI-RADS (Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System) permits non-listed features that suggest non-HCC malignancy in the judgment of the interpreting radiologist to be used to classify a lesion as LR-M. Reader 2 appreciated a targetoid appearance and rim arterial phase hyperenhancement. Both readers scored this observation as LR-M Fig. 7 Malignant rhabdoid tumor scored as LR-M (likely malignant) and LR-2 (likely benign). The patient is a 10-month-old boy with no risk factors for liver lesions in general or for hepatocellular carcinoma. T2-weighted ( a ), pre-contrast T1-weighted VIBE (volumetric interpolated breath-hold examination) ( b ), arterial phase T1-weighted VIBE ( c ) and delayed phase T1-weighted VIBE ( d ) MR images demonstrate a large observation in the right hemiliver ( arrows ). Reader 1 scored multiple LR-M criteria as present, including targetoid appearance, rim arterial phase hyperenhancement and delayed central enhancement. Reader 2 scored no LR-M criteria as present and appreciated marked T2 hyperintensity, an ancillary feature of benignity. Final LI-RADS (Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System) scores were LR-M and LR-2 for Reader 1 and Reader 2, respectively
Diagnostic performance of LI-RADS: Subgroup analysis
Table 7 shows the diagnostic performance of LI-RADS assessment for predicting HCC, among only patients at risk for focal liver lesion and among only patients older than 5 years. Performance of LI-RADS was overall similar when patients were subcategorized by risk status or age, when compared to all patients in aggregate. For reference, Table A1 list all lesions, with the LI-RADS scores for each reader, organized by risk status.

Frequency and inter-rater reliability of LI-RADS major and ancillary features
The frequencies of major features and findings of chronic liver disease by reader among HCC, non-HCC malignancy and benign lesions, with inter-rater reliability analysis, are shown in Table 8 . Agreement for non-rim arterial phase hyperenhancement was substantial (κ:0.62; 95% CI: 0.41–0.84), whereas agreement for washout and capsule appearance was moderate (κ: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.19–0.90 and κ: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.00–0.90, respectively). There was poor agreement for tumor in vein (κ: -0.03; 95% CI: -0.06-0.01); however, only one lesion was scored as having tumor in vein for each reviewer. Agreement for maximum diameter was near perfect (κ:0.99; 95% CI: 0.98–1.00). Additionally, agreement was substantial with respect to the apparent presence of any chronic liver disease and perfect with respect to the apparent presence of cirrhosis (κ:1.00; 95% CI: 1.00–1.00). Table A2 demonstrates the frequencies of the ancillary and LR-M features used in the LI-RADS algorithm, along with an inter-rater reliability analysis.

Discussion
Our study demonstrates the diagnostic performance of LI-RADS v2017 for diagnosing HCC in a pediatric cohort. Importantly, the specificity of LR-5 or LR-TIV (definitely due to HCC) as a predictor of HCC was high (84% and 97% for Reader 1 and Reader 2, respectively), similar to values reported in other studies [ , ]. However, PPV was low (33% and 75% for Reader 1 and Reader 2, respectively), given the low prevalence of HCC in this heterogeneous population.
HCC is one of the few malignancies in adults in which the imaging features are considered sufficient for directing management, and the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) policy on allocation specifies that an imaging diagnosis can be sufficient (depending on the stage of disease) to qualify for HCC model for end-stage liver disease exception points [ ]. These exception points confer priority on the liver transplantation waiting list and often obviates the role of percutaneous biopsy for diagnostic confirmation [ ]. However, despite being the second most common primary hepatic malignancy in children, HCC remains quite rare in pediatric patients [ ]. Even for children in whom HCC is strongly suspected based on imaging findings, biopsy is usually recommended before therapy due to the relatively low PPV of an imaging diagnosis [ ]. Our study supports this approach.
Despite the low PPV of LI-RADS v2017 for HCC in our study, this standardized algorithmic approach may still hold value in the pediatric population. The categorization of an observation as LR-5, LR-M or LR-TIV (i.e. likely or definitely malignant, but not necessarily HCC) as a predictor for any malignancy had sensitivity of 100% and 90% for Reader 1 and Reader 2, respectively, equating to an NPV of 100% for Reader 1 and 96% for Reader 2. The apparent ability of LI-RADS v2017 to differentiate malignant from benign entities may aid in the selection of pediatric patients with liver lesions for biopsy to establish a definitive diagnosis. For example, given the high sensitivity and NPV of a LR-5, LR-M or LR-TIV categorization for malignancy of any sort in the pediatric population, this designation may serve to identify patients whose liver lesion would be optimally managed by biopsy rather than follow-up imaging. LI-RADS also provides standardized definitions of imaging descriptors for liver lesions, with the intention of ensuring that terms like washout and arterial phase hyperenhancement are used appropriately. Consistency in the use of standardized descriptors can help stratify liver lesions and identify suspicious versus benign patterns.
Agreement for overall LI-RADS category was substantial (weighted κ=0.62) and similar to previously reported values from studies of adults [ , ], as was agreement for categorization of lesions as LR-5, LR-M or LR-TIV (i.e. likely or definitely malignant, but not necessarily HCC) versus the other LI-RADS categories (κ=0.66). The substantial agreement for overall LI-RADS category highlights the robust standardization inherent in the LI-RADS diagnostic algorithm. Additionally, substantial agreement for the categorization of lesions as LR-5, LR-M or LR-TIV versus the other LI-RADS categories supports the notion that an imaging designation of a pediatric liver lesion as malignant may be both diagnostically accurate and reproducible.
Our secondary aim was to determine whether the diagnostic accuracy of LI-RADS improves among children with risk factors for any focal liver lesion and/or in children older than 5 years. Performance of LI-RADS was similar when patients were subcategorized by risk status or age, relative to when all patients were analyzed in aggregate. However, this analysis was limited by the small numbers of patients within each subgroup, resulting in wide confidence intervals. Given the rarity of HCC in the pediatric population, a multicenter study is likely necessary to address the impact of risk factors and age on the diagnostic performance of LI-RADS.
Our study had several limitations. First, the study design was retrospective; however, the rarity of HCC in the pediatric population required a retrospective design to facilitate inclusion of a sufficient number of cases. Second, pathology was not available for many of the lesions defined as benign by our imaging follow-up reference standard. However, the spectrum of observations included in our study using this approach may better reflect the population of pediatric liver lesions encountered in clinical practice, as many lesions deemed benign by imaging are never biopsied. Third, one of our inclusion criteria was the need for a multiphase CT or MRI. Most benign hepatic lesions are typically evaluated with a single-phase CT; hence, this inclusion criterion created a slight selection bias toward suspicious hepatic lesions. Finally, subgroup analysis was performed in patients at risk for any liver lesion, rather than in patients specifically at risk for HCC. Only three patients in our cohort had one of the risk factors mandated by LI-RADS v2017 for utilization of the algorithm (cirrhosis, n =3; chronic hepatitis B, n =0), though one of these patients had a vascular etiology of cirrhosis (i.e. cardiac cirrhosis) and would have consequently been ineligible for LI-RADS assessment. It is likely that utilizing LI-RADS in a pediatric population would mandate the development of a new approach to defining risk status, an endeavor that needs further investigation and would likely require a multicenter effort.
Conclusion
Categorization of a lesion as LR-5, LR-M or LR-TIV had high sensitivity and high NPV for hepatic malignancy of any type. The PPV of LI-RADS v2017 for diagnosing HCC was limited by the low frequency of HCC among pediatric patients. Given the substantial agreement between readers with respect to this designation (i.e. as likely or definitely malignant but not necessarily HCC), LI-RADS in its current state may be useful in the pediatric population with respect to selecting lesions for biopsy.
