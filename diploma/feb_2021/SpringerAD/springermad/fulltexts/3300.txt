INTRODUCTION
In order to permeate the biological membranes and further reach its potential sites of action, drugs need first to be soluble in the gastrointestinal fluids. The solubilization of a solid dosage form comprises two important steps, known as disintegration and dissolution. Disintegration can be defined as a mechanical process in which the drug is liberated from the formulation matrix and transformed into granules and latter into smaller particles, by the action of biological fluids and physiological movements of the gastrointestinal tract. At this stage, the particles are prone to dissolution, which is intrinsically related to the physicochemical properties of the drug, such as its solubility ( ).
Dissolution is a mass transfer phenomenon that involves the movement of particles from a solid into a solvent (medium), allowing them to go into solution. Dissolution therefore depicts a kinetic process, and its rate signifies the amount of drug released over a specified time and under certain dissolution conditions (apparatus, rotation speed, dissolution medium, temperature), which is indicative of its performance ( ).
Emphasis has been placed on dissolution testing by the pharmaceutical industry and regulatory authorities, due to its importance to assess lot-to-lot quality of a drug product, both during the development of new formulations and in the assurance of product quality and performance after formulation or manufacturing changes ( , , , ). For drugs whose absorption is limited by their dissolution, as Class II compounds in the Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS), the dissolution profile must be quite definite and highly reproducible. The development of an expressive dissolution procedure for drug products with limited water solubility has been a challenge, since the ability to discriminate between formulations with different bioavailability is dependent on the design of in vitro dissolution tests ( , , ).
The use of a certain dissolution apparatus is a very important factor regarding the development of a dissolution test. This is mainly due to the different hydrodynamics provided by distinct apparatuses, which can simulate more or less likely to the physiological movements. In vitro drug release behavior from solid oral dosage forms is usually evaluated using the official basket or paddle dissolution apparatus: the US Pharmacopeia (USP) apparatuses 1 and 2, respectively. The basket and paddle apparatuses were the first ones to be introduced into official compendia and are extensively recommended in USP individual monographs for dissolution testing of various kinds of dosage forms. The tests prescribed in these monographs primarily address the quality control (QC) of the respective drug products ( , ).
The reciprocating cylinder apparatus (type 3) was introduced much later than the basket (type 1) and the paddle (type 2) apparatuses into the USP (1990) and has yet to establish itself as a QC method, with only a few USP individual monographs recommending this apparatus. That said, the reciprocating cylinder apparatus offers some attractive features, especially in terms of assessing the dissolution performance of dosage forms with modified-release characteristics ( ).
The performance of a dissolution test depends on the type of release from the dosage form. Regarding prolonged-release formulations, the development of an adequate dissolution method should include a minimum of three points as specification of quality and performance. An early time point of around 20–30% dissolved is used to exclude dose dumping and/or to determine the initial dose, around 50% dissolved is applied to verify the compliance with the shape of the dissolution profile, and more than 85% dissolved is the time point selected to ensure that the majority of the drug has been released. Besides, prolonged-release dosage forms should be tested using different conditions, which include media, pH (normally from 1 to 7.5), apparatuses, agitation, and sampling time ( ).
Gliclazide is a second-generation sulphonylurea that is used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. It is an example of a BCS Class II compound, showing poor water solubility (55 μg/ml) and dissolution properties. Moreover, being a weak acid (pKa 5.8), gliclazide presents lower solubility in acidic medium ( , , , ).This hypoglycemic agent is formulated both as immediate release and as modified-release formulations; the severity of glycemia will determine the dosage and the kind of formulation, requiring adjustment to obtain the optimal response at the lowest dosage ( ).
Gliclazide MR is a modified-release formulation, based on hypromellose hydrophilic matrix. The tablets show high bioavailability and absorption profile unaffected by co-administration with food. Patients with type 2 diabetes treated once daily (30–120 mg) with gliclazide MR tablets have mean plasma glucose levels significantly reduced over a 24-h period, in both fasting and postprandial states. Besides, it is as effective as the conventional twice-daily administration (80–320 mg), but with fewer side effects ( ).
In the absence of an official dissolution method for gliclazide MR and considering its frequent use for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes, the development of an adequate dissolution method is necessary to verify its quality and performance. Priya and Murthy investigated the effect of different dissolution media and agitation speed on the release of gliclazide from MR tablets, using apparatus 1. A discriminatory method was developed, using 0.1 M HCl as dissolution medium, but the effect of different apparatuses was not tested ( ). Similar report was described by Mandal and coworkers, who investigated the in vitro / in vivo correlation of two brands of gliclazide MR tablets administered to 18 healthy volunteers. The best correlation was observed with a dissolution method consisting of 0.1 M HCl as dissolution medium, rotated at 50 rpm by apparatus 2. Again, the impact of different apparatuses was not investigated ( ).
In this context, this work provides a complete investigation of the dissolution behavior of gliclazide modified-release tablets. The standard apparatuses 1 and 2 were, for the first time, compared to apparatus 3 (ideal for prolonged-release evaluation) for gliclazide modified-release tablets. In addition, different dissolution media, including biorelevant, and rotation speeds were investigated. The developed method aims to be applied as a QC test for gliclazide modified-release tablets, and two different brands were tested and compared.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
Gliclazide raw material was acquired from Les Laboratoires Servier (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; batch number 20150968). The investigated modified-release tablets were Azukon MR ® (Torrent Pharma, São Paulo, Brazil; batch number BM20A077) and Diamicron MR ® (Les Laboratoires Servier, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; batch number 3004787), both containing 30 mg of gliclazide.
Biorelevant medium (fasted-state simulated intestinal fluid (FaSSIF), fed-state simulated intestinal fluid (FeSSIF), and fasted-state simulated gastric fluid (FaSSGF) Powder ® ) was acquired from Phares Drug Delivery AG (Muttenz, Switzerland; batch number 01-1502004NP) and prepared as half FaSSIF according to Jantratid and coworkers ( ). All other chemicals were of pharmaceutical grade. Ultrapure water was obtained using a Milli-Q Gradient System (Millipore, Bedford, MA).
Solubility Studies
In order to assure sink conditions for all the dissolution tests, the equilibrium solubility of gliclazide was determined. An excess of the drug was added to 50-mM phosphate buffer solutions at different pH values (4.5, 5.5, 6.0, 6.4, 6.8, and 7.0) and to biorelevant medium (half FaSSIF pH 6.8). The samples were kept under stirring, for 48 h, at room temperature. Aliquots were withdrawn at 6, 12, 24, and 48 h and filtered through quantitative paper filters (22-μm pore size), and the same volume of dissolution medium was immediately replaced. The endpoint of the experiment was determined when the concentration values obtained did not vary more than 5% from the previous data point, reaching a plateau. All experiments were performed in triplicate.
The content of gliclazide in the samples composed of phosphate buffer was measured through UV/vis spectrophotometer (Cary 50 Bio, Varian, USA), at 235 nm. For this technique, a standard calibration curve (UV absorption vs. known concentration) was developed by using standard solutions (5–25 μg/ml) prepared by diluting the stock standard solution (500 μg/ml of gliclazide in methanol) with the respective dissolution medium. Linearity was confirmed through linear regression analysis ( R 2 of 0.999), and sensitivity was accomplished based on the low limits of quantification and detection (0.26 and 0.09 μg/ml, respectively).
The quantitative measurements performed in samples with FaSSIF pH 6.8 were carried out by HPLC, using a Shimadzu LC-10A system (Kyoto, Japan) equipped with an LC-10AD pump, a DGU-14A degasser, a SPD-10AV variable wavelength detector (set at 235 nm), and an SCL-10AVP system controller unit. A reversed-phase Phenomenex (Torrance, CA) Luna C18 column (250 × 4.6-mm internal diameter (i.d.), 5 μm) was used, and a security guard holder (C18, 4.0 × 3.0-mm i.d.) was employed to protect the column. The mobile phase was set in isocratic mode, composed of methanol/10 mM ammonium acetate buffer pH 3.5 (70:30 v / v ), with a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min, at 25°C. The samples were filtered through a 0.45-μm Millipore ® membrane filter, and a volume of 20 μl was injected. Data acquisition was performed using CLASS-VP software. The linearity of the method was achieved in a concentration range of 1–150 μg/ml ( R 2 of 0.999), by diluting the stock solution (500 μg/ml of gliclazide in methanol) with purified water. Limits of detection and quantification were 0.21 and 0.62 μg/ml, respectively.
Solubility enhancement (SE) in FaSSIF medium was calculated through Eq. 1 , proposed by Ottaviani and coworkers ( ), which refers to the ratio of solubility ( S ) achieved in FaSSIF and in aqueous buffers. $$ \mathrm{S}\mathrm{E} = \frac{S_{\mathrm{FaSSIF}}}{S_{\mathrm{aqueous}\ \mathrm{buffers}}} $$ (1)
USP Apparatus 1: Basket
Dissolution experiments using USP apparatus 1 were performed using the dissolution device Varian VK 7000. The dissolution profiles of the modified-release tablets were investigated at different rotation speeds (50 and 100 rpm), using 1000 ml of 50 mM phosphate buffer at different pH values (4.5, 6.4, and 6.8), prepared according to the recommendations of international standards ( ). The experiments were conducted at 37.0 ± 0.5°C. Five milliliters of samples were withdrawn at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 24 h, and the same volume of fresh dissolution medium was immediately replaced. The correction of the cumulative dilution was calculated by the software DD Solver ® . Filtration was performed using quantitative paper filters (22-μm pore size). All experiments were performed in triplicate.
USP Apparatus 2: Paddle
The dissolution profile of gliclazide modified-release tablets in USP apparatus 2 was carried out in the dissolution device Varian VK 7000. The dissolution studies were performed in different rotation speeds (50 and 100 rpm) and using different dissolution media (1000 ml of 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 4.5, 6.4, or 6.8 or half FaSSIF). The additional experimental conditions were the same as the ones previously described for USP apparatus 1.
USP Apparatus 3: Reciprocating Cylinder
Dissolution studies with USP apparatus 3 were carried out in the dissolution device Erweka RRT10 (Heusenstamm, Germany), using 250 ml of dissolution medium, kept at 37 ± 0.5°C. The selected mesh sizes for both top and bottom were 420 μm, and the agitation speed was set at 10 dpm. In order to investigate the impact of the pH in the dissolution profile of gliclazide modified-release tablets, the dissolution medium consisted of a pH gradient with 50 mM phosphate buffer, as described in Table I , mimicking the physiological pH range and residence time ( ). Another assay was performed with 50 mM phosphate buffer set at pH 6.8 aiming to establish an adequate comparison with the other apparatuses tested. At predetermined time intervals (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 24 h), 5 ml of samples were withdrawn, filtered through quantitative paper filters (22-μm pore size), and immediately replaced by fresh dissolution medium. The correction of the cumulative dilution was calculated by the software DD Solver ® . All experiments were performed in triplicate.

Mathematical Methods for Comparison of the Dissolution Data
Dissolution Efficiency
The dissolution efficiency (DE) was obtained from the ratio between the area under the gliclazide dissolution curve up to time t (24 h), in relation to the total area of the rectangle, which refers to 100% dissolution in the same timeframe. The DE values were expressed in percentage through the software DD Solver ® . The obtained results were submitted to statistical analysis by t test, in which significant results presented a probability of less than 5% ( p ≤ 0.05 with 95% confidence interval, n = 3). The statistical analysis was carried out in Microsoft Office Excel ® software.
Similarity Factor (f2)
The similarity factor, which indicates the closeness between the two profiles, was calculated according to Eq. 2 , by the software DD Solver ® . $$ f2=50\times \log \left\{{\left[1 + \frac{1}{n}\ {\displaystyle {\sum}_{t=1}^n{{\left({R}_t-T\right)}_t}^2}\right]}^{-0.5} \times 100\right\}, $$ (2) where n corresponds to the number of time points and R t and T t refer to the dissolution value of the reference and test product at time t , respectively.
Adopting the standards from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and from the European Medicines Agency (EMA), values of f 2 between 50 and 100 indicated the sameness of the two dissolution profiles.
Dissolution Kinetics
In order to investigate the dissolution kinetics of the gliclazide modified-release tablets, the in vitro profiles were also investigated by means of model-dependent methods. The dissolution data were tested to fit zero order, first order, Higuchi, and Korsmeyer-Peppas (Table II ). The selection of the model-dependent method was based on the best fit, represented by the best correlation coefficient. From the selected method, the dissolution rate ( k ), the time necessary to release 50 and 90% of the drug ( t 50% and t 90% , respectively), was also calculated. All the parameters were determined using the software DD Solver ® .

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Dissolution studies are considered mandatory to investigate the in vitro performance of immediate or modified-release dosage forms during development, stability studies, scale-up, and post-approval changes ( , ). Recently, in order to provide complete information about standard dissolution procedures for dosage forms, the FDA developed the Dissolution Method Database ( ), in which the dissolution conditions, including apparatus, media, agitation speed, and sampling times, are specified. Although many dosage forms are covered by this database, no standard dissolution method has been reported for extended-release tablets of gliclazide.
In order to develop a standard dissolution test for a certain dosage form, it is important to ensure that it is discriminatory for products with relevant variations and/or from different batches, besides being capable of testing batch-to-batch consistency, and determine the stability of the drug and dosage form over the proposed shelf life and storage conditions ( ). Hence, ideally and especially for modified-release dosage forms, different dissolution conditions such as media, pH (normally ranging from 1 to 7.5), apparatus, agitation, and sampling times should be investigated and the most discriminatory test should be selected.
Based on that, different apparatuses and dissolution conditions were tested with the commercial dosage form Azukon MR ® , containing 30 mg of gliclazide. The different dissolution conditions included variations in pH values, apparatus, rotation speed, and use of buffer solutions or biorelevant medium. Another parameter that presents an important influence is the solubility of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) in the dissolution medium. Ideally, sink conditions, which comprise a volume of dissolution medium at least three times higher than the volume required to have a saturated solution of the API ( ), should be accomplished. For this reason, equilibrium solubility measurements of gliclazide were performed in buffer solutions at different pH values and in biorelevant medium. The results are shown in Table III . Table III Equilibrium Solubility Data of Gliclazide Raw Material in Different Buffer Solutions and Biorelevant Medium Condition Equilibrium solubility (μg/ml) ± SD Volume of dissolution medium required to reach sink conditions (ml) Acetate buffer pH 4.5 33.7 ± 2.9 2667.5 Phosphate buffer pH 5.5 43.3 ± 2.9 2076.7 Phosphate buffer pH 6.0 61.9 ± 1.5 1453.0 Phosphate buffer pH 6.4 113.3 ± 1.9 794.4 Phosphate buffer pH 6.8 216.5 ± 3.8 415.8 Phosphate buffer pH 7.0 264.6 ± 7.8 340.1 Biorelevant medium pH 6.8 277.4 ± 2.6 324.4 SD standard deviation
Equilibrium solubility data of gliclazide in different solutions show that its solubility is pH mediated and increases in direct proportion to the pH values (pH 4.5 < 5.5 < 6.0 < 6.4 < 6.8 < 7.0). This is due to the weakly acidic nature of gliclazide, which presents a pKa of 5.8. Thus, in higher pH values, the API will be ionized and its solubility will be higher. Based on these data, it is expected that the dissolution in buffer solutions with different pH values will lead to different release profiles.
Also, regarding the data presented in Table III , it is possible to observe that sink conditions are only maintained at pH values of 6.4, 6.8, and 7.0 and in half FaSSIF. For the other dissolution media, the equilibrium solubility is lower. However, at the dissolution volume selected, gliclazide is completely soluble in all buffer solutions, in a way that no precipitation should be obtained, from saturation of the medium.
Applying Eq. 1 proposed by Ottaviani and coworkers ( ), which shows the SE between biorelevant medium and buffer solutions, the value obtained is 1.28 times, corresponding to a limited SE in biorelevant medium. These data are in accordance with the equilibrium solubility measurements obtained in buffer solution pH 6.8 and biorelevant medium, considered statistically similar. These results possibly suggest that dissolution profiles in buffer solution pH 6.8 could represent a biorelevant condition.
Regarding the dissolution profiles obtained in different dissolution conditions, the results are shown according to the apparatus tested and, later, a comparison among the three apparatuses is also performed. Finally, based on the previous results, one dissolution condition was selected and a second commercial dosage form (Diamicron MR ® ) was tested, in order to compare the dissolution performance of tablets derived from different manufacturers.
USP Apparatus 1: Basket
The dissolution profiles performed in apparatus 1 and obtained in different pH values and rotation speeds are depicted in Fig. 1 . Fig. 1 Dissolution profiles of Azukon MR ® 30 mg in apparatus 1, at different pH values and at a 50 and b 100 rpm
Basically, a similar trend is observed between the two rotation speeds, demonstrating that the pH values do not seem to have an influence on the drug release, although slightly lower dissolution profiles were observed at pH 4.5. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test, and all the dissolution profiles are considered similar ( p ≥ 0.05, n = 3). This result is unexpected, since gliclazide presented its solubility mediated by pH changes. Thus, we can assume that in this case, the drug release has been formulation mediated.
Considering different rotation speeds, at a certain pH, a higher drug release is observed for the dissolution profiles performed at 100 rpm. One hundred-percent drug release was observed at pH 6.4 and 6.8 at 100 rpm for 24 h. For 50 rpm, the release reaches up to 67.1 ± 2.5% at pH 6.8 for 24 h. The detailed dissolution data are shown in Table IV . The DE values also show a better performance at 100 rpm, pH 6.4 and 6.8. Statistical analysis was applied using t test, and differences regarding the DE were only observed between pH 4.5 and 6.8 at 100 rpm and between the same pH values, but at different rotation speeds ( p ≤ 0.05, n = 3). Table IV Drug Release (%) from Azukon MR ® at 24-h Dissolution at Apparatus 1, Under Different pH Values and Rotation Speed, and DE Data Dissolution medium Drug release in 24 h (% ± SD) DE (% ± SD) 50 rpm pH 4.5 54.2 ± 9.3 26.8 ± 2.7 pH 6.4 63.9 ± 4.1 33.8 ± 2.9 pH 6.8 67.1 ± 2.5 34.2 ± 0.9 100 rpm pH 4.5 75.7 ± 9.5 45.6 ± 5.6 pH 6.4 104.8 ± 6.5 56.5 ± 3.1 pH 6.8 99.6 ± 17.5 54.3 ± 4.1 DE dissolution efficiency, SD standard deviation
In order to have a complete comparison among the dissolution profiles, the similarity factor f 2 was also applied. f 2 values higher than 50 were observed for all the comparisons among different pH values, indicating that the pH does not affect the dissolution of gliclazide from Azukon MR ® . However, the rotation speed seems to have an important role; similarity factors of 39.4, 37.3, and 39.3 were obtained for the comparison between 50 and 100 rpm, at pH 4.5, 6.4, and 6.8, respectively. Priya and Murthy ( ) also tested gliclazide extended-release tablets under different rotation speeds (50, 75, and 100 rpm) and dissolution medium (0.1 M HCl pH 1.2, acetate buffer pH 4.5, water pH 7.0, and phosphate buffer pH 7.4) in apparatus 1. However, the authors report similarities among dissolution profiles performed in different rotation speeds.
USP Apparatus 2: Paddle
The dissolution profiles obtained in apparatus 2 (Fig. 2 ) show similar trends to the ones observed for apparatus 1. Firstly, at the same rotation speed, no differences among the different pH values were observed. However, it is important to note that in this apparatus, the differences among dissolution profiles obtained in different pH values are even less pronounced, since the dissolution profiles are almost exactly superimposed. This demonstrates that the release of gliclazide from the tablets in apparatus 2 is also formulation mediated. Fig. 2 Dissolution profiles of Azukon MR ® 30 mg in apparatus 2, at different pH values and at a 50 and b 100 rpm
The detailed dissolution data after 24 h are presented in Table V . As observed in apparatus 1, the drug release was higher at 100 rpm, releasing around 100% in 24 h. As a consequence, the DE values are also higher in this condition. However, they are statistically similar at different pH values, using the same rotation speed ( p ≥ 0.05, n = 3). Table V Drug Release (%) from Azukon MR ® at 24-h Dissolution at Apparatus 2, Under Different pH Values and Rotation Speed, and DE Data Dissolution medium Drug release in 24 h (% ± SD) DE (% ± SD) 50 rpm pH 4.5 63.69 ± 4.9 39.33 ± 2.0 pH 6.4 71.60 ± 3.4 43.88 ± 2.8 pH 6.8 74.97 ± 2.3 44.19 ± 0.4 100 rpm pH 4.5 100.62 ± 13.2 61.64 ± 4.0 pH 6.4 101.34 ± 3.1 62.37 ± 0.9 pH 6.8 98.56 ± 4.2 60.12 ± 1.3 DE dissolution efficiency, SD standard deviation
The comparison among the dissolution profiles obtained in apparatus 2 was performed by the similarity factor ( f 2). The results follow the same trend presented in apparatus 1. No differences were observed between dissolution profiles at different pH values, but similar rotation speeds, providing f 2 values higher than 50. On the other hand, significant differences were between 50 and 100 rpm, when a certain pH value is analyzed (36.4, 42.1, and 46.5 f 2 values for pH 4.5, 6.4, and 6.8, respectively). Certainly, the hydrodynamics play an important role on the dissolution release of gliclazide modified-release tablets.
USP Apparatus 3: Reciprocating Cylinder
USP apparatus 3 is known to mimic the changes in physiological conditions, especially concerning pH values, as well as the mechanical forces encountered by the dosage forms in the gastrointestinal tract. This is especially important for modified-release formulations, although its application to immediate-release dosage form dissolution studies has also been proved ( ). In this sense, the dissolution profile of gliclazide modified-release tablets was also investigated in this apparatus and the results are shown in Fig. 3 . For this apparatus, the conditions tested included a constant dissolution medium composed of phosphate buffer pH 6.8 and a pH gradient comprising the physiological conditions of the gastrointestinal tract ( ). These conditions were selected in order to investigate if the similar dissolution profiles obtained in different pH values at the previous apparatuses would also be present in this case. Fig. 3 Dissolution profiles of Azukon MR ® 30 mg in apparatus 3, at pH 6.8 and pH gradient, mimicking the physiological conditions
As it can be observed, the use of a pH gradient did not affect the dissolution release of the studied gliclazide modified-release tablets. The total release after 24 h was 73.0 ± 5.0 for the pH gradient and 72.1 ± 0.7 for the dissolution kept at pH 6.8. As a consequence, the DE was also similar: 35.4 ± 0.3 and 35.9 ± 1.8 for the pH gradient and pH 6.8, respectively ( p ≥ 0.05, n = 3). According to the analysis performed by the similarity factor ( f 2 ) , both dissolution profiles were considered similar. These results emphasize that for the studied gliclazide modified-release tablets, the dissolution is formulation and not pH mediated.
Impact of the Different Apparatuses on the Release of Gliclazide from Modified-Release Tablets
Due to the different equipment settings and hydrodynamics, the comparison among different apparatuses becomes important, especially when in vitro / in vivo correlation is desired. This topic has become the target of investigation in the pharmaceutical field, and in some cases, significant differences have been reported ( , , , , ). For this reason, a comparison among the three apparatuses investigated in this research was performed.
Firstly, since no difference was observed among the dissolution profiles obtained in different pH values ( p ≥ 0.05, n = 3), pH 6.8 was selected to provide a comparison among the three different apparatuses tested.
First of all, a comparison between apparatuses 1 and 2 is shown in Fig. 4 , at 50 and 100 rpm. At 50 rpm, a slightly higher drug release is observed at apparatus 2 (75.0 ± 2.3%) in comparison to apparatus 1 (67.1 ± 2.5%). In some cases, the excipients of a dosage form can get stuck at the mesh sieve of the basket, prejudicing the drug release, which could possibly explain the lower release at apparatus 1. However, when the similarity factor was applied, the two dissolution profiles were considered similar ( f 2 = 50.0). For the rotation speed of 100 rpm, the differences were less notable and they were also considered similar ( f 2 = 59.9). Fig. 4 Comparison of the dissolution profiles of Azukon MR ® 30 mg in apparatuses 1 and 2, at pH 6.8, a 50 rpm and b 100 rpm
According to Kostewicz and coworkers ( ), agitation speeds of 100 rpm for apparatus 1, 50 rpm for apparatus 2, and 10 dpm for apparatus 3 are considered similar. Based on that, this comparison was performed and the data are shown in Fig. 5 . Fig. 5 Comparison of the dissolution profiles of Azukon MR ® 30 mg in apparatuses 1, 2, and 3, at 100 rpm, 50 rpm, and 10 dpm, respectively
As it is possible to observe, the dissolution profile of gliclazide modified-release tablets was higher when performed at apparatus 1. Statistical data comparing their DE and the calculation of the similarity factor proved that apparatuses 2 and 3 are similar ( p ≥ 0.05, n = 3) but different from apparatus 1 ( p ≤ 0.05, n = 3). Most papers comparing different apparatuses to apparatus 3 show a higher release for the last one ( , , ). However, in most cases, the agitation speeds differ too much, not following the statement reported by Kostewicz and coworkers ( ). It is mostly expected that if the agitation speed of apparatus 3 is higher than the others, the release profile will also be higher, since the vertical movements provided by this dissolution apparatus are more drastic and reflect better the gastrointestinal hydrodynamics.
In our case, the dissolution profile performed at apparatus 2, pH 6.8 and 100 rpm, provided a complete drug release at 24 h. Apparatus 2 is known to be robust and easy to operate, and due to its availability almost worldwide, it is well recognized by companies and regulatory units ( ). For this reason, it has been selected to perform the next steps of this research, which include its application to a QC test, performed with Diamicron MR ® (gliclazide 30 mg), and the impact of using a biorelevant medium, instead of the conventional buffer solutions.
Impact of the Biorelevant Medium on the Dissolution Rate of Gliclazide Modified-Release Tablets
The use of biorelevant medium has demonstrated its potential as a more reliable condition to mimic as close as possible the composition of human gastric and intestinal fluids, in fasted and fed state ( , , ). This is due to the fact that biorelevant media present similar osmolality, ionic strength, viscosity, surface tension, pH, and composition compared to the human fluids. This is very important since it can generate reliable in vitro data, which could more easily correlate to the in vivo situation, saving time and costs associated with pharmacokinetic studies in human volunteers ( ).
For this reason, although the SE in biorelevant medium was only of 1.3 times for gliclazide, the dissolution in this condition was tested. The dissolution profiles comparing the buffer solution pH 6.8 and the biorelevant medium at the same pH value are shown in Fig. 6 . Fig. 6 Comparison of the dissolution profiles of gliclazide modified-release tablets in biorelevant medium and phosphate buffer pH 6.8
As it can be observed, the dissolution profiles in the two different conditions are very similar. The percentage releases at 24 h are 84.0% and 98.5% for the biorelevant medium and the phosphate buffer pH 6.8, respectively. As a consequence, their DE values are similar: 51.5% (biorelevant medium) and 60.1% (phosphate buffer) ( p ≥ 0.05, n = 3). These results are positive, demonstrating that in this condition, the phosphate buffer pH 6.8 could represent a biorelevant condition. For this reason, this condition was selected to be applied in a QC test of gliclazide modified-release tablets.
Application of the Dissolution Test in the QC of Gliclazide Modified-Release Tablets
The comparison between dissolution profiles of same dosage forms is a prerequisite to select the ideal formulation in development stage, stability studies, scale-up, postapproval changes, and bioequivalence studies. According to the “Guideline on quality of oral modified-release products” provided by EMA, dissolution profiles of modified-release dosage forms should be compared by means of model-independent or model-dependent methods, such as linear regression of the percentage dissolved at specific time points, statistical comparison of the parameters of the Weibull function, or calculation of the similarity factor ( ). The last method was selected to compare the dissolution profiles. In this case, values equal or higher than 50 correspond to similar dissolution profiles ( , ).
In this context, the dissolution profiles of Azukon MR ® and Diamicron MR ® were submitted to the same dissolution conditions (apparatus 2, phosphate buffer pH 6.8, 100 rpm, 37.0 ± 0.5°C) and their respective dissolution profiles were compared (Fig. 7 ). Fig. 7 Dissolution profiles of Azukon MR ® and Diamicron MR ® in apparatus 2, phosphate buffer pH 6.8, 100 rpm, and 37.0 ± 0.5°C
From Fig. 7 , it is possible to see that both profiles are quite similar, although Azukon MR ® presents a higher dissolution profile from 9 h onward, releasing around 98% in 24 h, in comparison to 74% of Diamicron MR ® . The similarity factor calculated for this comparison is 51.8, indicating that both profiles are considered similar.
As a final approach, mathematical models were applied to explain the kinetic release of both dissolution profiles. The data are summarized in Table VI .

From the r values, it is possible to conclude that both dissolution profiles follow a first-order kinetics. This means that the amount of drug released in function of time is dependent on the amount of drug remaining in the formulation. In this way, the amount of drug released by time tends to diminish ( ). Based on this model, it was possible to calculate the constant release (0.064 for Diamicron MR ® and 0.070 h −1 for Azukon MR ® ) and the time necessary to release 50% (10.8 and 9.9 h for Diamicron MR ® and Azukon MR ® , respectively) and 90% of drug (35.8 h for Diamicron MR ® and 32.9 h for Azukon MR ® ).
CONCLUSIONS
The absence of official dissolution methods for modified-release tablets of gliclazide provided for the first time the investigation of different dissolution conditions and apparatuses aiming to develop an adequate dissolution assay. From all the conditions tested, the apparatuses and their agitation speed showed the greatest influence on gliclazide release. In pH 6.8, around 100% was released at 100 rpm, against 71% at 50 rpm in apparatus 2. In addition, when the three apparatuses were tested at pH 6.8, apparatus 1 at 100 rpm showed the fastest release (100% in 24 h), in comparison to 75% (apparatus 2, 50 rpm) and 72.1% (apparatus 3, 10 dpm). Complete drug release was also achieved with apparatus 2 at 100 rpm, pH 6.8, during 24 h. Compared to apparatus 1, the paddle provides important advantages, especially concerning the possibility of excipients from the formulation getting stuck in the mesh from the basket. For this reason, the dissolution method developed and proposed for the evaluation of modified-release tablets of gliclazide consisted of apparatus 2 (paddle), at 100 rpm, using phosphate buffer pH 6.8 as dissolution medium. Importantly, half FaSSIF pH 6.8, which presents a more biorelevant composition, showed similar results to those obtained with phosphate buffer pH 6.8 (DE of 51.5 and 60.1% for biorelevant medium and phosphate buffer, respectively). Besides, when used as a QC test, it demonstrated similar results between two different brands of modified-release tablets ( f 2 = 51.8). In this context, this research provides a promising dissolution method for application at QC and research and development routines of modified-release tablets composed of gliclazide.
