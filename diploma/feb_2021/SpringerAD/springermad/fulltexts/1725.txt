Introduction
Emotional intelligence has been defined as the “accurate appraisal and expression of emotions in oneself and others and the regulation of emotion in a way that enhances living” [ ]. It includes a set of complex and linked abilities that go from self-awareness to social skills, and that allow both production and recognition of emotions.
Expression of emotions is a crucial skill for social life that allows the development of relationships, a functional understanding of and the ability to empathize with others’ mind, as well as an exhibition of own internal states in both verbal and non-verbal modalities. Facial expression is the most immediate way to produce or perceive emotions. Some studies show how people tend to read emotions from facial expressions more than from verbal or non-verbal cues (body movements or voice tones) [ ]. Thus, during paradoxical communication, more attention is paid to facial expressions than to verbal content [ ].
Developmental psychology showed how the quality of non-verbal communications between infants and their caregivers can influence, among others, the development of emotion understanding [ ], attachment relationships [ ], and emotion regulation [ ].
Clinical studies before, and neuroimaging after, suggest that frontotemporal networks and dopaminergic systems are involved in both face processing and facial expression recognition. Higher atrophy has been correlated to impaired emotional competence in frontotemporal dementia [ ] and Alzheimer’s disease [ , ]. In the same way, Huntington’s Disease shows a correlation between negative emotion processing (anger, fear), and periamygdalar and pyriform regions atrophy [ ].
Psychiatric syndromes such as schizophrenia and major depressive disorder are characterized by emotional incompetence, due to a hypo activity of both prefrontal regions [ , ] and amygdalae [ , ]. Even dopaminergic systems seem to co-participate in decreasing facial expression recognition ability [ ], as patients with Parkinson’s disease [ ] and schizophrenia [ ] are at high risk for this condition [ ].
The idea that the cerebellum is in some way involved in the regulation of human behavior is not entirely new. In fact, cases of cerebellar cognitive affective disorder (CCAS) and posterior fossa syndrome (PFS) are well described. CCAS is characterized by deficits in executive function, visual-spatial domains, language production, and behavioral-emotional alterations not explainable by cerebellar-associated motor deficits alone [ ]. PFS follows resection of cerebellar tumors and is characterized by language and speech production deficits as well as emotional lability and depressed affect [ , , ].
Recent studies suggested a possible role of the cerebellum in computing facial expressions. It is still not clear if the cerebellum is involved in processing different facial expressions [ ] or it is particularly activated for specific emotions like anger [ ] or fear [ ]. Therefore, emotional and/or social abilities in patients with cerebellar diseases should be better characterized.
In Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA), an autosomal recessive ataxia caused by the expansion of a GAA triplet in the frataxin ( FXN ) gene, emotional state has been poorly explored. Most of the studies focused on the investigation of depression [ , , , ], while few authors used different tests to explore emotional abilities of FRDA [ , , ]. Mantovan et al. found that half of FRDA patients scored outside the normal range on some Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) subscales, showing increased irritability, impulsiveness, and blunting of affect. Interestingly, Dogan et al. first explored social cognition in FRDA, with particular attention to the theory of mind, finding overall poor performances on Faux-Pas test, supposing a certain involvement of the cerebellum as previously demonstrated [ , ].
The aim of our study was to measure the ability of FRDA patients to process dynamic facial expressions and to correlate this ability with psychological, neuropsychological, and neurological measures of the disease.
Patients and Methods
Patients and Ethics
The study was approved by the local Ethics Committee (n. 47/15), and was performed in accordance to the Declaration of Helsinki, European guidelines CPMP/ICH/135/95, and Italian law D.M.15/07/1997. All patients and healthy controls (HC) gave written informed consent before any activity linked to the clinical trial. Patients were recruited at our outpatient clinic for movement disorders, and HC through patient’s relatives and university personnel.
Study Procedures
We included patients if they had a molecular diagnosis of FRDA [ ], that we assessed as previously reported [ ]. We recorded the following baseline data: age, age at onset, disease duration, sex, education, GAA triplet repeat expansion in minor (GAA1) and major allele (GAA2), the score at the Scale for the Assessment, and Rating of Ataxias. HC were selected and matched based on age, sex, and education. We tested patients and HC with a full neuropsychological battery, with disability correction of timed neuropsychological tests. This procedure considers patient’s disability, as measured with the PATA rate test and the 9-hole pegboard test, and integrated these measures in the final score or in the available time for each timed test. The method has been recently validated in FRDA patients [ ].
Global functioning was assessed with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) [ ]; verbal working memory with the Digit Span [ ], spatial short, and long-term memory with 10/36 Spatial Recall Test Immediate and Delayed (SPART/SPART-D) [ ]; verbal short and long-term memory with the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test Immediate and Delayed Recall (RAVLT/RAVLT-D) [ ]; executive functions/attention with the Trail Making Test (TMT-A/-B) [ ], Stroop Test Time Interference Index [ ], Semantic and Phonemic Fluency [ ]; and faces recognition with the Physiognomic Decision Test [ ]. The latter investigates the ability to recognize faces, requiring subjects to judge if the 18 stimuli are faces or not. A score lower than 16 is diagnostic for prosopagnosia.
During the same day, we administered the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, State Trait Anxiety Inventory, Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders II, and the Geneva Emotion Recognition Test.
Patient Health Questionnaire-9
Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) is a scale used for the diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) based on DSM-IV criteria. Diagnostic validity has been confirmed in two very large studies [ , ]. The scale comprises nine items (each can have a score between 0–“not at all” and 3–“nearly every day”) can have a final score between 0 and 27, and shows specificity and sensitivity that are comparable to larger and more time-consuming scales. The scale can also be used to rate the severity of MDD: scores between 5 and 9 indicate minimal symptoms, 10 to 14 minor depression/dysthymia/major depression–mild, 15 to 19 major depression–moderately severe, 20 and over major depression–severe.
State Trait Anxiety Inventory
State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) is a self-administered likert scale for the evaluation of anxiety [ ]. The scale consists of 20 questions that deal with state anxiety (STAI-S) and 20 with trait anxiety (STAI-T). The questionnaire does not have any time limit, but usual completion time is approximately 15 min. STAI-S is always administered before the STAI-T because it is more sensitive to the emotional status that could be easily induced by the STAI-T.
Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders II
Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders II (SCID-II) was created in order to diagnose axis II disorders and follows the diagnostic criteria for DSM-IV [ ]. The following personalities are considered in the SCID-II interview: avoidant, dependent, obsessive-compulsive, paranoid, passive-aggressive, schizotypal, schizoid, histrionic, narcissistic, borderline, and antisocial. The scale was administered following standard procedures.
Geneva Emotion Recognition Test
Geneva Emotion Recognition Test (GERT) is an emotion recognition test that contains a large number of emotions, both positive (joy, amusement, pride, pleasure, relief, interest) and negative (anger, fear, despair, irritation, anxiety, sadness, disgust, surprise). This reduces the probability, as compared to other emotion recognition tests, that patients may guess test results by guessing the correct response. The GERT is computer-based and consists of 83 video clips taken form the Geneva Multimodal Emotion Portrayals database [ ] where actors simulate 14 different emotions, using non-verbal hints (facial expressions, prosody, and non-existing language). This produces a very realistic situation and increases the ecological validity of the test. Other available tests usually focus on single modalities like pictures, audio only, and video only stimuli. The entire test takes approximately 20 min and has been validated in several studies showing a high internal consistency [ , ]. Similar to other emotion recognition tests, women and younger subjects usually score better. A sample of the GERT procedure is available at the following link: http://www.affective-sciences.org/en/emotional-competence/research-tools/gert/ .
In this study, test procedures were performed in the same way for all patients and HC, and were implemented as follows in order to avoid influence of motor incoordination on reaction time. Videos were shown on a computer screen with patients sitting in a quiet and comfortable room. After watching the video, patients or HC gave orally their interpretation of the correct emotion based on a screen-printed list of 14 different emotions. A neuropsychologist would then mouse click on the correct response activating an automated rating and reaction time calculation.
The Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia
The Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) consisting of eight different items and can score from 0 to 40, with 40 being the worst condition. The different items rate gait, stance, sitting abilities, speech disturbance, finger chase, nose-finger test, fast alternating hand movements, and heel-shin slide. These items assess the main consequences of ataxia including gait impairment, dysarthria, dysmetria, and dysdiadochokinesia. The scale has been used to score ataxia in several neurological conditions, including FRDA [ , , ].
Statistical Analysis
Normality was tested with the Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test and showed a normal distribution for most variables supporting the use of parametric tests. These included demographics, GERT correct answers, and GERT reaction times. The majority of neuropsychological test results were not normally distributed and the difference between FRDA and HC was analyzed with the Mann Whitney test. Group difference in demographic variables between controls and FRDA patients (age, education, gender) was analyzed with the Student’s t test and chi-square test as appropriate. Difference in single emotion recognition ability at the GERT, and in the sum of recognized emotions, GERT reaction times, STAI, and PHQ-9 were analyzed with an unpaired t test. Effect size was estimated with Cohen’s d . The same procedure was used for GERT reaction times, STAI, and PHQ-9. The distribution of different PHQ-9 categories across groups was tested with the chi-square test.
We performed a linear regression analysis, using a stepwise method, to test the effect of age, age at onset, disease duration, sex, education, GAA1, GAA2, SARA, and all neuropsychological test results on the sum of recognized emotions at the GERT.
Independent variables significantly associated with GERT response (STAI-T, MOCA, SPART, RAVLT-D), were transformed in categorical variables based on their median value (e.g., STAI-T high and low), and were used to analyze the difference in the number of correct recognized emotions at the GERT using the Fisher’s exact test.
P values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA) version 23.0.0.1 running on macOS 10.11.6.
Results
Patients
We enrolled 20 FRDA patients and 20 HC that underwent the extensive psychological, emotional, and neuropsychological procedures. Demographics and clinical data are shown in Table 1 . FRDA and HC were similar for age, gender distribution and education. All FRDA patients were homozygous for a GAA expansion in the pathological range. None of FRDA patients were taking psychiatric medications at the time of the test.

Neuropsychology
The global cognitive assessment at the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) showed a significant difference between FRDA and HC, with the first group performing worst (Table 2 ). Spatial memory was also impaired with significant differences between FRDA and HC at the SPART. In contrast, verbal memories were all preserved (Digit Span, RAVLT, RAVLT-D).

Performances on all executive functions tests were significantly worst in FRDA compared to HC. Finally, no prosopagnosic deficit emerged in both groups.
Psychological Tests
Results of the STAI-S, STAI-T, and complete PHQ-9 interviews are shown in Table 3 . STAI-S showed lower scores in FRDA patients, indicating lower state anxiety, whereas STAI-T showed comparable levels between groups.

Values less than 0.05 are shown in bold characters STAI-S State Trait Anxiety Inventory– State, STAI-T State Trait Anxiety Inventory–Trait, PHQ-9 Patient’s Health Questionnaire, SD standard deviation
PHQ-9 showed overall similar scores between groups, although patients showed worst scores in questions 4 and 8 (Table 3 ).
The distribution of the number of subjects classified in different PHQ-9 severity categories (normal, minimal symptoms, minor depression, major depression—moderately severe, severe) was similar between patients and controls ( p = 0.308). No patients were diagnosed with major depressive disorder or other axis I disorders.
Using the SCID-II, we identified personality disorders in three FRDA patients: antisocial, avoidant, and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder.
Geneva Emotion Recognition Test
We found significant difference between FRDA patients and HC in the number of correct answers at the GERT (Fig. 1 ). Patients scored worst at the recognition of amusement ( p = 0.033), sadness ( p = 0.001), interest ( p = 0.002), and pleasure ( p = 0.006). The total number of recognized emotions was also lower in patients with 29% lower mean recognition rate as compared to HC (95% CI − 44.8%, − 12.6%; p = 0.001; Cohen’s d = 1.2). Fig. 1 Mean number of correctly recognized emotions. Three tests, in a random order, are administered for each emotion. Significance values are for an unpaired t test performed at the single patient level, considering the mean number of correct emotions recognition. GERT Geneva Emotion Recognition Test; FRDA Friedreich Ataxia
Patients had higher reaction time for the recognition of surprise, disgust, despair, anxiety, relief, interest, and pleasure (Table 4 ). Mean reaction time for all emotions was 42% higher in patients as compared to healthy controls ( p = 0.002). Table 4 GERT reaction time in FRDA and controls Emotion FRDA (SD) n = 20 Controls (SD) n = 20 p Amusement 10,660 (8421) 6861 (3762) 0.057 Joy 10,930 (5218) 8595 (7034) 0.222 Surprise 13,306 (5119) 9364 (4966) 0.013 Disgust 12,811 (6993) 8270 (4771) 0.015 Sadness 12,676 (4789) 11,801 (13129) 0.775 Despair 12,542 (5825) 8983 (5134) 0.037 Anger 11,174 (4691) 9316 (5070) 0.215 Anxiety 20,887 (19578) 11,420 (6496) 0.034 Relief 14,113 (5560) 9844 (5619) 0.015 Interest 19,113 (8863) 11,338 (6378) 0.002 Irritation 17,706 (6803) 13,674 (9305) 0.111 Fear 13,871 (7189) 10,279 (6441) 0.088 Pleasure 11,989 (6621) 6236 (3784) 0.001 Pride 13,536 (7890) 10,579 (5886) 0.164 All emotions 14,204 (4346) 9977 (4250) 0.002 Reaction time is shown in as mean reaction time of three trials with standard deviation in parenthesis.

Values less than 0.05 are shown in bold characters GERT Geneva Emotion Recognition Test, FRDA Friedreich Ataxia, SD standard deviation
We then tried to identify which factor could be able to predict the total number of correctly identified emotions in FRDA patients, and found that the SPART, the STAI-T, the RAVLT-D, and the MOCA were all independent predictors ( R 2 = 0.906; n = 20; F = 24.077; intercept 30.630; p < 0.001; Table 5 ). For controls, the only predictor was the result of the SPART ( R 2 = 0.304; n = 20; f = 10.590; p = 0.004; intercept =8.106; coefficient = 1.852). Table 5 Linear regression model for GERT Variable Coefficient p SPART − 0.424 < 0.001 STAI-T − 0.439 < 0.001 RAVLT-D 0.399 0.004 MOCA 0.368 0.047 STAI-T State Trait Anxiety Inventory–Trait part, MOCA Montreal Cognitive Assessment, RAVLT-D Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test Delayed Recall, SPART 10/36 Spatial Recall Test Immediate Recall
We then analyzed the distribution of the recognition of single emotions in patients with low and high values of each predictive factor (i.e., MOCA, SPART, RAVLT-D, STAI-T). We found that patients with high STAI-T had lower recognition of irritation ( p = 0.032) and pride ( p = 0.027). Lower scores of MOCA were associated with lower recognition of amusement ( p = 0.018), higher scores at the SPART with lower recognition of interest ( p = 0.01), and higher scores at the RAVLT-D with higher recognition of anxiety ( p = 0.009).
Discussion
This is the first study to investigate emotion recognition in FRDA using visual and non-verbal auditory hints. FRDA patients showed an overall deficit in correctly identifying emotions compared to HC, as well as increased reaction times. The latters could not be imputed to slower movements as patients responded orally to the test. It is still possible that dysarthria slowed patient’s response as compared to HC, but it is improbable that this could explain an increase of 42% in mean reaction times. Nevertheless, reaction times should be interpreted prudently and the number of correctly recognized emotions should be preferentially used as an indicator of emotion recognition abilities.
Most erroneously identified emotions were sadness, interest, amusement, and pleasure. This impairment was not due to prosopagnosic deficits, since patients and HC did not differ on prosopagnosic test performances.
Our results are in line with D’Agata et al. (2011), in which Spinocerebellar Ataxia (SCA) patients showed a significant overall difficulty in the recognition of all emotions compared to healthy controls [ ]. SCA patients failed to recognize sadness as a basic emotion but showed a greater impairment in social emotions identification. Similarly, FRDA patients failed in the recognition of sadness and three social emotions (pleasure, amusement, and interest).
The disproportion between basic and social emotions impairment could rely on the filogenetic and ontogenetic meaning of the former ones, as they are biologically determined and have a universal value across cultures. On the contrary, social or secondary emotions arise from a combination of basic emotions and develop with the individual’s growth and social interaction.
Usual FRDA onset is during adolescence that is a crucial life period in which the person undergoes biological, psychological, and social changes. It is possible that pathogenetic changes deriving from FRDA leave kids unable to integrate social emotions and develop normal emotion recognition abilities.
In addition to this, an involvement of the cerebellum in complex motor, emotional, and cognitive tasks is well known and may contribute substantially to the observed emotional recognition deficit. Recently, Harding et al. found that patients with FRDA have deficits in brain activation in both the lateral cerebellar hemispheres and the prefrontal cortex, with reduced functional connectivity. [ ] Dogan et al. also found a reduced connectivity in FRDA patients compared to controls between right cerebellar lobule VI and left BA44/insula during phonemic verbal fluency. [ ]
Lesion and neuroimaging studies provided proof about the link between the cerebellum and emotion regulation [ , , , ]. Vermis and paravermal lesions may cause a deficit in manipulation and emotion integration like blunted affect, impulsivity, irritability, and apathy. Neuroimaging studies on both pathological and healthy cohorts seem to confirm these results as the cerebellum is bidirectionally connected with those areas computing emotional and social information.
In addition to altered functional connectivity, we identified four independent predictors of GERT accuracy based on neuropsychological findings: SPART, STAI-T, RAVLT-D, and the MOCA. SPART was the only predictor in HC.
SPART measures immediate visuospatial memory and learning, a complex function that manipulates spatial information and cues, including social and emotional ones. Visuospatial learning impacts social function, as interactions require a rapid and online detection of changes in facial expressions or body movements, such as the selection of the most congruent responses and adherence to social norms. Reduced visuospatial learning slows the elaboration of visual complex stimuli and could reduce emotion recognition by impacting the ability of capturing facial movements as a whole. Nevertheless, a piece-by-piece approach hinders connections among parts, and may cause a loss of important links and information. This kind of cognitive processing style has been called the “weak central coherence” [ ], and has been used to explain the facial expression recognition deficit of autism spectrum disorder [ ]. It is possible that the impairment in visuospatial learning that is found in FRDA patients could cause a piecemeal approach for faces, ignoring some elements of face configuration and focusing on some other features that convey more emotional content, like the eye region. This may be a possible explanation for both reduced emotion recognition and reaction times.
Another important predictive factor was the RAVLT-D, which measures verbal long-term memory. It is difficult to discuss how a larger verbal retention corresponds to a greater performance on GERT. It is possible that when visuospatial strategies appear misleading, this is the case of low SPART, FRDA patients could have in part relayed on verbal information to identify emotions through prosody. For this reason, an increase in verbal memory abilities could be considered as a compensatory mechanism. To support this theory, RAVLT and RAVLT-D are both not impaired in FRDA as compared to HC and could indeed be used as a compensatory mechanism. In addition, a higher ability to recall the list of answers (i.e., the list of 14 possible emotions) may have helped patients during the emotion recognition process. We speculate that it is easier to recognize emotions correctly if probands remember most of the possible answers, which is itself a verbal learning task.
Finally, the influence of the MOCA test on GERT can be seen as a general impairment of cognitive functions in FRDA that involve the complex computation that is needed for emotion recognition.
Interestingly, we found no relation between measures of ataxia and emotion recognition. The clinical scale used in this study, the SARA, measures only ataxic symptoms that are usually the consequence of disease specific lesions. In FRDA, there is a predominant degeneration of dorsal root ganglions (DRGs), and a mild atrophy in late stages of the disease [ , ]. The result is that, in FRDA, SARA is measuring the clinical consequences of DRGs pathology, and not cerebellar atrophy. This supports the role of cognitive impairment in reducing emotion recognition in FRDA patients, and its greater impact as compared to measurable ataxic signs through clinical scales.
When planning this study, we also considered that the psychological burden of the disease could determine impairment in emotion recognition. For this reason, we administered depression, anxiety, and personality disorder tests in order to investigate psychological and behavioral features of the disease. Depression was measured using the PHQ-9 test that refers to DSM-IV criteria for depressive disorder, while anxiety was tested using STAI-S and STAI-T. Our results showed no differences in depression as compared with HC in line with some studies [ , , ] but in contrast with others [ , , ]. A recent large observational trial reported the prevalence of depression and anxiety in 43% of patients [ ], but rated this with the EQ-5D, a brief tool assessing general quality of life on five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. This last item is self-rated and allows three possible answers: (a) “I am not anxious or depressed,” (b) “I am moderately anxious or depressed,” and (c) “I am severely anxious or depressed”. This leads to the consideration that anxiety and depression should be rated with specific and validated scales that should give detailed information on the nature and the level of the disorder before considering depression as a hallmark of the disease.
Despite FRDA showed no pathological anxiety, STAI-T negatively influenced GERT scores. In support to this, pride and irritation were less recognized in patients with higher trait anxiety. Previous studies on the influence of anxiety on facial emotion recognition gave contrasting results. Surcinelli et al. found that high trait anxiety persons were more accurate in recognizing fearful expressions, when stimuli were shown for 10 s [ ] On the contrary, Montagne et al. found that patients suffering from social anxiety disorder were less accurate in recognizing low intensity expression of negative emotions like anger and disgust [ ]. In addition to cognitively normal subjects, FRDA showed cognitive impairment in several areas that may have interacted with high trait anxiety impacting on emotion recognition.
Finally, three patients (two females, one man) were identified with a personality disorder. It is possible that having such a disabling disease may have compromised their psychological development, favoring the onset of a personality disorder. Future longitudinal disorders may help understand if the development of personality disorders takes place after the onset of the disease, i.e., secondary to disability, or if it is a pre-existing condition.
In conclusion, FRDA patients showed impaired emotion recognition that may be secondary to neuropsychological impairment. The impact of the disease on psychological measures is minimal, except for the onset of personality disorders, and should not be considered as part of the clinical picture of FRDA. These findings should be taken into account when approaching patients both in clinical routine practice, as well as psychological counseling and support.
