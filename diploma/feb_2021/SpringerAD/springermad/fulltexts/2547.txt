Introduction
Menkes disease (MD; MIM#309400) is a rare fatal X-linked neurodegenerative disorder resulting from copper deficiency caused by mutations in a copper-transporting P-type adenosine triphosphatase, type A ( ATP7A ). First described in 1962, MD is characterized by kinky hair, epilepsy, neurodegeneration and connective tissue abnormalities clinically.(Danks et al. ; Chelly et al. ; Mercer et al. ; Vulpe et al. ; Menkes et al. ) The morbidity rate is estimated to be 1 in 100,000 births and no data has previously been reported on the Chinese population.(Kaler et al. ) Low serum Cu and ceruloplasmin levels are detected in most MD patients and they often died before the third year of life.(Verrotti et al. ) Hypomyelination, brain atrophy, subdural collections and tortuous intracerebral arteries are all classic image features of MD.(Faerber et al. ; Johnsen et al. ) Copper histidine or a combination of it and disulfiram therapy, are the only treatments available for this disease.(Danks et al. ; Nomura et al. ) However, copper histidine was unavailable in mainland China at time of this research. MD diagnosis was based on characteristic clinical features and laboratory tests—such as serum Cu and ceruloplasmin level—and ATP7A mutation analysis was used to confirm the diagnosis.
ATP7A , located on Xq21.1, is the only disease-causing gene.(Chelly et al. ; Mercer et al. ; Vulpe et al. ; Kaler et al. ) ATP7A was important in the mammalian copper transport pathway, and predicted to supply copper to copper-dependent enzymes. Six copper-binding sites were detected in the N-amino terminus binding domain (NMBD), followed by 8 transmembrane segments (TM) and a C-terminus chain. TM4, TM5 and TM6 were essential for copper binding.(Inesi et al. ) Mutations in ATP7A lead to damage in the activity of these enzymes, such as cytochrome c oxidase and dopamine β-hydroxylase.(Schlief et al. ; Schlief and Gitlin ; Tumer and Moller ) To date, approximately 331 different mutations have been detected in ATP7A worldwide (HGMD® Professional 2015.4), only seven of which were reported in Chinese patients.(Wang et al. ) Prenatal diagnosis, important for MD families with genetic diagnosis, has been useful in primary and secondary prevention. In this study, 24 MD patients—the largest sample ever studied in the Chinese population—were analyzed and 12 novel mutations of ATP7A were identified. Prenatal diagnosis was achieved successfully in five unrelated MD families (Pt5, Pt7, Pt 9, Pt10 and Pt14).
Materials and methods
Patients
Twenty-four male patients (Pt1-Pt24) from 24 unrelated families were enrolled at the Department of Pediatric Neurology, Peking University First Hospital between June 2006 and November 2015, based on the clinical characteristics of MD. Ages ranged from 2.5mo (months old) to 15mo, with a median age of 6mo. Clinical data of patients was collected, such as age, skin and hair abnormalities, epilepsy, serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels, cranial MRI/MRA ,etc.
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Peking University First Hospital, and written informed consent was obtained from each patient or their legal guardians.
Genetic analysis
DNA was extracted from peripheral blood using the salting out method, and amplifications and sequencings of ATP7A were performed for Pt1-Pt24 (Primers were ready for inquiry). ATP7A dosage analysis was held by multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) with P104 kit (MRC-Holland, Amsterdam, and the Netherlands) for patients (Pt20-Pt24) without abnormal sequences.
Samples from fetuses in five MD families (Pt5, Pt7, Pt 9, Pt10, and Pt14) were obtained by chorionic villi biopsy (CVS) or amniocentesis. Genomic DNA was extracted using a Promega Wizard® Genomic DNA Purification Kit (A1120). Three microsatellite markers (DX6797, DX6807, and AR) and SRY were analyzed to exclude maternal cell contamination (MCC).

Development delay manifested in all 24 patients (Pt1-Pt24, 100%). All patients frequently were unable to control their head at 3mo, and none achieved the ability to sit or walk independently. Out of 24, 22 (Pt1-Pt8, Pt10-Pt15, Pt17-Pt24, 91.7%) patients developed epilepsy (EP), while 2(Pt9, Pt16, 8.3%) were free of seizures. In a total 20 patients, seizures-onset age was ranged from 3ds to 7mo, with a median of 3mo. Focal seizures (FS) were the onset type for 17 patients (Pt1-Pt2, Pt4, Pt6-Pt8, Pt10-Pt15, Pt17-Pt19,Pt21-Pt22, 85%), generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) and tonic seizures (TS) occurred in two patients (Pt3, Pt5, 10%) and one patients (Pt20, 5%), respectively. Two patients (Pt3, Pt7, 9.5%) suffered status epilepticus (SE) during the early stage. Epileptic seizure types changed as the disease progressed, and myoclonic (MC), infantile spasms (IS), and multifocal seizures (MFS) appeared. Corresponding abnormal features of 17 patients (Pt1-Pt2, Pt4-Pt8, Pt10-Pt15, Pt17-Pt18, Pt21-Pt22) in electroencephalogram (EEG) were described with ictal rhythms, focal regions with localized sharp/spike wave, slow background, hypsarrhythmia, multifocal epileptic activity, and the EEG of three patients (Pt3, Pt19-Pt20) were spared. Fourteen patients were treated with various antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in monotherapy including TPM, VPA, PB, OXC, LEV or a combination of different drugs. Only four patients (Pt6 with PB, Pt7 with TPM and CZP, Pt14 with LEV, Pt15 with VPA) were partially controlled, and EP management of the remaining eight patients was unclear. Seizure and EEG details of two patients (Pt23-Pt24) were unclear.
None of the 24 patients received copper histidine treatment. Hypopigmentation, skin laxity, and kinky coarse hair were found in all 24 (Pt1-Pt24, 100%). Dystonia was observed in 24 patients (100%) and hypotonia and hypertonia were found in 21 (Pt1-Pt5, Pt8, Pt10-Pt24, 87.5%) and 3 (Pt6-Pt7, Pt9, 12.5%) patients, respectively. Hernia, pectus excavatum, vaulted arch, feeding difficulty, congenital atrial septal defect and ventricular septal defect, hepatomegaly and abnormal palm print were identified in six (Pt1, Pt3, Pt6, Pt8, Pt12, Pt18, 25%), four (Pt2, Pt17, Pt21, 16.7%), two (Pt1, Pt3, 8.3%), five (Pt1, Pt3, Pt5, Pt6, Pt16, 20.8%), two (Pt3, Pt5, 8.3%), two (Pt10, Pt11, 8.3%), and one (Pt12, 4.2%) patient, respectively. Serum ceruloplasmin and/or copper level was low in 19 patients, while the remaining five (Pt6, Pt10, Pt18-Pt19, Pt22) did not undergo the tests (Table 1 , Clinical features of 24 MD patients).
Nineteen patients underwent cranial CT/MRI/MRA, and hypomyelination with abnormal signal in basal ganglia, brain atrophy and tortuous intracranial vessels were detected (Fig. 1 , Cranial MRI and MRA of Pt16 at 6mo). Five patients (Pt5, Pt7, Pt8, Pt12, Pt15) in this study accepted karyotype analysis in which 47, XXY/46, XY mosaic karyotype was found in Pt5, and the other four were 46, XY. Premature delivery and asphyxia at delivery was found in 10 patients (Pt1-Pt3, Pt5, Pt8, Pt12, Pt14-Pt15, Pt20-Pt21, 41.7%). Their parents were not consanguineous; siblings or maternal male relatives with similar phenotypes were described in seven families (Pt5, Pt7, Pt12-Pt14, Pt20, Pt22, 29.2%). Eleven patients (Pt1, Pt3-Pt6, Pt10-Pt11, Pt19-Pt20, Pt23-Pt24, 45.8%) died at ages ranging from 6mo to 4.5yo, with a median of 1yo. The survival age of the rest was unclear. All enrolled 24 patients were clinically diagnosed with classic MD. Fig. 1 Cranial MRI and MRA of Pt16 at 6mo. (A-B) Brain atrophy especially cerebellum atrophy, abnormal signals in basal ganglia (arrows) and hypomyelination were detected in cranial MRI. (C) Tortuous intracranial vessels were found in MRA
Genetic findings
Genetic analysis was performed in 24 patients (Table 2 , Genotypes in ATP7A of 24 patients with Menkes Disease). Twenty-two patients (Pt1-Pt22, 91.7%) were genetically diagnosed, while neither point mutation nor dosage abnormality was found in the remaining two (Pt23-Pt24, 8.3%).

ATP7A mutations were identified in 22 patients (Pt1-Pt22, 91.7%). Hemizygous mutations consisting of 12 novel mutations including four small deletion/insertion(c.2589_2612delinsCACAG; c.1642_1643insA; c.1027_1028insT; IVS20-7_IVS20-3delTTCTT), one missense mutations (c.3028A > C), two nonsense mutations (c.1642G > T; c.2922C > A), two splicing-site mutations (IVS18 + 1G > A; IVS10 + 1G > A), three gross deletion (IVS9-346_IVS10 + 1203del; c.1-?_1708 + ?del; c.3112-? + 3112 + ?del) (Fig. 2 , Genetic analysis results of Pt19; Figure3, The genogram and genetic analysis results of Pt22), and five reported mutations(c.3045delT, c.2179G > A, IVS20 + 1G > A, c.3905G > A, c.121-?_4227 + ?del) were found. A reported missense mutation (c.2179G > A) was found in five patients (Pt5, Pt7, Pt12, Pt15-Pt16). Mutations in eight patients (Pt3-Pt4, Pt8-Pt10, Pt12, Pt16-Pt17, 36.4%) were de novo, and the remaining 14 were inherited from their mothers. No signals and reduced single of Exon16 was detected in Pt22 and his mother, respectively. Reasons for single abnormal signal in one exon were including exon deletion or point mutation of sites ligated with MLPA primers. Sequence analysis of Exon16 performed for them illustrated Exon16 deletion was responsible for it (Fig. 3 . The genogram and genetic analysis results of Pt22) Fig. 2 Genetic analysis results of Pt19. Sequencing results for Pt19 indicated hemizygous IVS9-346_IVS10 + 1203deletion, and heterozygous deletion was identified in his mother. a Sequence results of Pt19, IVS9-346_IVS10 + 1203 was deleted. b Same primers of Pt19 indicated IVS9-346_IVS10 + 1203 deletion was found in his mother, too. The wild allele was too long to amplify. c Sequencing results of his mother with primers of Exon 10 showed normal Exon 10 sequences (in dotted box) Fig. 3 The genogram and genetic analysis results of Pt22. a Genogram of Pt22 family. Exon16 deletion was detected in Pt22, and heterozygous deletion was found in his mother. Seizures, development delay, hypotonia and kinky coarse hair were described in Pt22’s elder brother, who was deceased.

No production of Exon16 in ATP7A was found in II 4 (in dotted box). c Sequences of ligated with primers of Exon16 in Kit104 of I 2 were wild type (in dotted box), indicating no point mutation affecting the ligation between primers and template which leaded to false copy number results was found
Prenatal diagnosis was performed for five unrelated MD families (Pt5, Pt7, Pt9, Pt10, Pt14) (Table 3 , Prenatal diagnosis of 5 MD families), in which three mothers (Pt5, Pt7, Pt14) were heterozygous carriers and two (Pt9-Pt10) with wild type. Of a total of five fetuses, four (Pt5, Pt7, Pt10, Pt14) were male, and one (Pt10) was female; four (Pt5, Pt7, Pt9, Pt10) were wild type and unfortunately one (Pt14) had a hemizygous mutation.

Discussion
Menkes disease is an X-linked multisystem disease of copper metabolism, caused by mutations in ATP7A gene, leading to the partial or complete loss of activity of cooper-dependent enzymes.(Chelly et al. ; Mercer et al. ; Vulpe et al. ; Menkes et al. ; Tumer and Moller ) Classic MD patients are characterized with kinky coarse hair, epilepsy, neurodegeneration and connective tissue abnormalities, and often died before three years of age.(Verrotti et al. ; Verrotti et al. ) In this study, 24 patients (Pt1-Pt24) met the criteria of classic MD with typical clinical features similar to those in previous reports (Table 1 , Clinical features of 24 MD patients).
For all 24 MD patients in this study, the median age of onset was 3mo, and symptoms including seizures and development delay were found in 75% patients younger than 3mo, which was similar to previous reports.(Tumer and Moller ; Horn et al. ) Serious development delay, hypopigmentation, skin laxity, and kinky coarse hair were common manifestations in MD patients,(Chelly et al. ; Mercer et al. ; Vulpe et al. ; Menkes et al. ; Tumer and Moller ) and they were found in 24 (100%) patients in this study. Survival age of 11 patients was ranged from 6mo to 4.5yo, with a median of 1yo, lower than in previous report.(Verrotti et al. ; Verrotti et al. ) Unavailable of copper histidine treatment might be responsible for their earlier death. Serum ceruloplasmin and/or copper level were important laboratory tests.(Chelly et al. ; Mercer et al. ; Vulpe et al. ; Menkes et al. ; Tumer and Moller ) The serum ceruloplasmin of 19 patients (100%) and serum Cu of 7 patients (100%) in this study were low, suggesting that serum ceruloplasmin/Cu testing is a useful method for diagnosing Chinese males with MD.
Cerebral atrophy, delayed myelination with abnormal basal ganglia signal, and subdural effusion were detected in nine (37.5%), ten (41.7%), and four (16.7%) patients, respectively, while tortuosity of intracranial vessels were found in a total nine patients (100%) using MRA (Fig. 1 , Cranial MRI and MRA of Pt16 at 6mo). These findings indicate that delayed myelination and abnormal intracranial vessels were common features in classic Chinese patients.
Premature delivery and asphyxia were detected in 41.7% of the patients, suggesting that MD patients easily suffer perinatal period abnormalities. Epilepsy (EP) was one of the most common and important feature in MD patients, and it was the onset symptom in most patients.(Tumer and Moller ; Horn et al. ) Twenty-two patients (91.7%) in this study suffered from EP. Two patients (Pt9, Pt16, 8%) were still seizures free at 9-10mo; we speculated later-onset EP would develop and determined that further follow-up study was needed to confirm the outcome. Most patients developed seizures around 2-3mo.(Tumer and Moller ; Horn et al. ) In this study, seizures occurred in 18 patients (75%) before 3mo including three whose corrected age was under 3mo. Epileptic types including MC, GTCS, IS, MFC and status epilepticus (SE) have been reported in MD patients.(Bindu et al. ; Sfaello et al. ; Bahi-Buisson et al. ) The history of epilepsy was characterized by three stages: FS and SE appeared at the early stage—from 2 to 3 months—with ictal rhythms, focal regions with localized sharp waves in EEG; IS occurred at the intermediate stage—3 to 9 months—with high-voltage slow wave superimposed by a burst of fast rhythms in EEG; finally MFC, MC and TS developed at the late stage—from 20 to 25 months—with multifocal activity mixed with irregular slow waves.(Verrotti et al. ; Prasad et al. ; Friedman et al. ) Nine patients (Pt1, Pt8, Pt10, Pt12-Pt14, Pt17-Pt19, 45%) grew into intermediate stage or late stage, where IS, MC, MFC appeared; however, no alternative epileptic type was described in 10 patients (Pt2-Pt4, Pt6-Pt7, Pt11, Pt15, Pt20-Pt22, 50%) after 3mo in which MC and TS manifested in Pt15 and Pt20, respectively, and one patient (Pt5, 5%) was too young to be in intermediate stage or late stage. EEG features of 17 patients in this study were similar to those in previous report, where patients in the early stage with FS showed focal localized sharp waves; hypsarrhythmia occurred to five patients with IS, and multifocal activities were appeared in four patients with MFS. The epilepsy was drug-resistant, and PB, TPM, CZP, LEV, VPA might be partially effective.
In this study, all MD patients were male. Premature delivery and asphyxia occurred in half the patients. Onset often occurred in most patients with FS before 3mo. Development delay, kinky coarse hair, skin laxity and hypopigmentation were common. Epileptic type progress was found in half patients. Corresponding features of EEG with focal sharp/spike waves, hypsarrhythmia, and multifocal epileptic activity were found. The epilepsy was difficult to manage. Serum Cu/ceruloplasmin was useful in diagnosing classic MD patients, and delayed myelination and abnormal intracranial vessels were detected in most of the Chinses patients. Survival age of 11 patients was lower than previously reported. No patient in this study obtained copper histidine treatment, nor was therapy efficacy found in this study.
ATP7A was the disease-causing gene for MD. Point mutations were identified in about 75% of patients, and gross deletion/duplication in 25% of patients. Sequencing of ATP7A was performed first for the 24 MD patients and dosage analysis was applied for five patients (Pt20-Pt24) without point mutations in this study. Seventeen point variations were detected in 18 patients (75%) and four gross deletions in four patients (16.7%). Neither point mutations nor deletion/duplication was found in two patients (8.3%). As we know, about 331 mutations were reported in ATP7A with only 7 mutations in 14 Chinese patients.(Wang et al. ) In this study, twelve novel mutations including four small deletion/insertion (c.2589_2612delinsCACAG; c.1642_1643insA; c.1027_1028insT; IVS20-7_IVS20-3delTTCTT), one missense mutations (c.3028A > C), two nonsense mutations (c.1642G > T; c.2922C > A), two splicing-site mutations(IVS18 + 1G > A; IVS10 + 1G > A), three gross deletion(IVS9-346_IVS10 + 1203del; c.1-?_1708 + ?del; c.3112-? + 3112 + ?del) (Fig. 2 ), and five reported mutations(c.3045delT, c.2179G > A, IVS20 + 1G > A, c.3905G > A, E3-E23deletion) were found. They were not detected in 100 normal control alleles. An N-terminal tail with six metal-binding sites, right transmembrane domains, an ATP-binding domain, and A-domain and a C-terminal tail were detected in ATP7A that delivered copper to copper-dependent enzymes.(Leon-Garcia et al. ) All mutations spread the whole gene.
Novel mutations either altered the chemical properties of residues from hydroxy (T) to imino acid (P) for mutation p.Thr1010Pro, or resulted in early termination for mutation p.Ile863Ilefs*20, p.Glu548*, p.Leu549Thrfs*12, p.Tyr343Leufs*2 and p.Tyr974*, or lead to gross deletion of amino acids for IVS9-347_IVS10 + 1023del, c.1-?_1708 + ?del; c.3112-? + 3112 + ?del. What’s more, novel missense mutation c.3028A > C (p.Thr1010Pro) was occurred in a highly conserved region, and they were predicted “probably damaging” by PolyPhen-2 and “disease causing” by Mutations T@sting. The splicing mutations of IVS10 + 1G > A and IVS18 + 1G > A changed the donor-site sequence of intron 10 and intron 18, respectively, which might lead to intron inclusion, pseudo-exons into the processed mRNA, leaky splicing or introduction of exon skipping, or crytic splicing.(Caminsky et al. ) No signals in a single exon might be caused by point mutations at the sites ligated with MLPA primers or exon deletion. Agarose gel electrophoresis of PCR production and DNA sequencing were important for distinguishing them.
In Pt22, neither the production of exon16 of Pt22 nor the point mutation in Exon16 of Pt22’s mother was detected (Fig. 3 , The genogram and genetic analysis results of Pt22), testifying that it was deletion not point mutation that was identified in Pt22. IVS20-7_IVS20-3delTTCTT, near to the acceptor site-AG of IVS20, was identified in Pt6 with classic MD features and typical laboratory tests, so we considered it responsible for Pt6. c.2179G > A was a reported mutation and detected in five patients (Pt5, Pt7, Pt12, Pt15-Pt16, 22.7%) in this study and four in the previous research,(Tang et al. ) and might be a hot-spot mutation in MD patients. Mosaic karyotype of 47, XXY/46, XY in peripheral blood was found in Pt5 at about 2mo. Unfortunately, we failed to analyze the percentage of 47, XXY or make other tissue biopsy since he died at 8.5 mo. A positive family history was described in seven families, and heterozygous mutations were identified in 15 mothers. Development delay, hypotonia and seizures were described in Pt12’s maternal elder cousin and he died at 2yo. However, no heterozygous mutation was detected in Pt12’s mother or Pt12’s maternal aunt. We suspected other genetic factors to be responsible for Pt12’s maternal elder cousin. In a total of 22 patients with genetic diagnoses, amino acids missense, protein truncated including nonsense and small deletion/insertion, splicing mutation and gross deletion were identified in seven (31.8%), six (27.3%), five (22.7%) and four (18.2%) patients, respectively. No difference in symptoms—including seizures, development delay, connective tissue abnormalities, laboratory tests and survival—was found in these groups. No correlation between phenotype and genotype was found in this study.
Prenatal diagnosis was important for MD families with ATP7A mutations. Three different ways were applied in prenatal diagnosis for MD families, including amniocyte/villus DNA mutation analysis, analysis of the 64Cu uptake into cultures from the fetus, and determining Cu in samples of chorionic villi from the fetus by means of radiochemical neutron activation analysis.(Horn ; Heydorn et al. ; Das et al. ) However, false negatives and false positives were reported in the second and the third methods. DNA mutation analysis turned out to be the most popular and precise method, and we adopted DNA analysis for five MD families in this study. Heterozygous mutations were detected in three mothers (Pt5, Pt7, Pt14), and mutations of Pt9-Pt10 were predicted de novo. There was 25% risk of recurrence and 25% risk of female carrier in the three MD families (Pt5, Pt7, Pt14) with regular X-linked recessive inheritance. For Pt9’s and Pt10’s family, it was much lower since de novo was a rare event, but mosaic was another possibility in their mothers.
Prenatal diagnosis was important for both Pt5, Pt7, Pt14 and Pt9-Pt10 families. MCC was the most common factor to affect the precision of DNA analysis in the prenatal molecular diagnosis. Different ratios of MCC were reported in different centers, with different identification methods.(Bryndorf et al. ; Schrijver et al. ; Stojilkovic-Mikic et al. ) Microsatellite analysis turned out to be more effective in detecting MCC. DX6797, DX6807, and AR were applied in this study. In this study, no abnormal signals indicating MCC were found. DNA sequences of five fetuses indicated that four were wild type, and unfortunately one was a hemizygous mutation at the corresponding sites (Table 3 , Prenatal diagnosis of 5 MD families).
Conclusion
In summary, 24 male MD patients—forming the largest to date sample from the Chinese population—were analyzed clinically and genetically, and prenatal diagnosis was performed for five MD families. Development delay, skin laxity, kinky coarse hair, and seizures were classic phenotypes in Chinese MD patients. Serum ceruloplasmin testing was useful in diagnosing classic male MD. Delayed myelination and abnormal intracranial vessels were common. We first made analysis of seizures in Chinese MD patients, discovering similar characteristics with previous reports. Survival age was lower than for other ethnics due to copper histidine unavailability. Premature delivery and asphyxia were common in these Chinese MD patients. 91.7% patients were genetically diagnosed. Twelve novel mutations in ATP7A were identified, expanding the spectrum of mutations. c.2179G > A in ATP7A might be a hot-spot mutation in MD patients. Agarose gel electrophoresis of PCR production and DNA sequencing were important for distinguishing point mutations at the sites ligated with MLPA primers from exon deletion in patients with no signals in a single exon. Prenatal diagnosis was accomplished in five MD families. Application of microsatellite markers on chromosome X was useful and necessary for excluding MCC.
