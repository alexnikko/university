Introduction
Neuroendocrine neoplasias (NENs) consist of a spectrum of tumors which can originate throughout the body, behave in a variety of different ways but are characterized by a similar histological appearance.[ ] They are thought to originate form enterochromaffin cells however recent genetic studies have postulated, particularly in the case of high grade neuroendocrine carcinomas (NEC) they may be a transformation of poorly differentiated carcinomas.[ ] They are of a group of “small blue cell tumors,” consisting of uniform cells which have a round to oval stippled nucleus and scant, pink granular cytoplasm. The cells may align variously in islands, glands or sheets and high power examination shows bland cytopathology. They are characterized immunohistochemically by staining for chromogranins & synaptophysin.[ ] The cells of NEN often contain special secretory granules which produce biogenic amines and polypeptide hormones. This leads to these tumors being associated with symptoms corresponding to the secretory amines & hormones. [ ]
The most common site for NEN is the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas (GEP). Grossly GEP NENs are often small, yellow or tan masses, frequently located in the submucosa or more deeply intramurally. They can be very firm due to an accompanying intense desmoplastic reaction. As they are often located intramurally, the overlying mucosa may be either intact or ulcerated. GEP NENs are classically divided along the embryological origins of the GI tract, foregut, midgut and hindgut; corresponding to the arterial supply to the respective portion of the GI tract. For the purposes of this review we will concentrate on hindgut neuroendocrine neoplasia which includes tumors located in the left colon, rectum and anus.
Classification & Staging
GEP NEN classification and staging has changed significantly in the past decade. The traditionally used terms such as carcinoid, atypical carcinoid and small/large cell carcinoma have been superseded by the terms well differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NET) and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NEC). This differentiates between the slow growing neuroendocrine tumors (previously called carcinoids) with the more aggressive neuroendocrine cancers (small or large cell carcinomas). The cut off between the 2 tumor types has been defined by both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society. This has been identified as a Ki 67 staining on immunohistochemistry of greater than 20 % or a mitotic index within the tumor of 20 mitoses per 10 high powered fields (HPF). Within the well differentiated NET, there is a sub-classification between low grade NET (Ki67 index <3 % or 2 mitoses per 10 HPF) and intermediated grade NET (Ki76 index 3–20 or 2–20 mitoses per 10 HPF).[ , ] (Fig. 1 ) Fig. 1 Pathological classification of hindgut neuroendocrine neoplasia
As WDNET and HGNEC behave differently there are staged as difference diseases. The more common WDNET can be staged with the TNM system however there are 2 widely used classifications that can be used the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society staging systems. They only differ slightly and have been shown to demonstrate no difference with respect to prognostic value.[ ] (Table 1 ) As HGNECs behave in a more aggressive fashion they are staged according to the AJCC staging system for colorectal cancer. Unfortunately HGNEC generally presents with metastatic disease.[ ] As WDNET and HGNEC behave in very different ways with differing prognosis and treatment they will be dealt with separately for purposes of this paper.

Hind Gut Well Differentiated Neuroendocrine Tumors (WDNET)
Diagnosis
The majority of hindgut WDNETs are diagnosed incidentally on colonoscopy and are located mainly in the rectum. With the increasing use of screaming colonoscopy the incidence is also increasing. Along with HGNEC they account for approximately 1 % of hindgut tumors. They tend to be small at presentation. Generally located submucosally, they can ulcerate and present with rectal bleeding or hematochezia. Potentially if the tumor becomes large they may develop symptoms of mass effect such as tenesmus or altered bowel habits. Hindgut WDNET tend not to secrete amines or hormones and as such do not present with paraneoplastic effects. As the majority of hindgut tumors present incidentally they tend to be small with less than 10 % having metastatic disease.[ ]
Once a diagnosis of WDNET has been made pathologically, local staging of rectal can be achieved using EndoRectal Ultrasound (ERUS) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the pelvis. The purpose of these investigations is to identify the size of the tumor and to assess regional lymph nodes. Distant staging can be obtained by Computerized Tomography (CT) of the abdomen, pelvis and chest. Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (octreotide scanning) has been described to look for distant disease however a good quality CT or MRI scanning with contrast is just as beneficial in identifying metastatic disease. [ ] As lymph node and metastatic disease for rectal WDNET less than 1 cm is rare distant staging is often not necessary. For left colon WDNET local staging with MRI pelvis or ERUS is not beneficial and CT is the most beneficial staging investigation. All patients should have chromogranin A levels checked at baseline as these can be used as a tumor marker for response to treatment and as a marker for recurrence. Hindgut WDNETs rarely secrete serotonin and as such assessment of Urine 5-HIAA can be considered but is not necessary.[ ]
Management
The primary treatment for localized rectal WDNETs is resection with negative margins. When the tumor is less than 1 cm in diameter the incidence of lymph node metastases is rare and local excision of the tumor with negative margins is acceptable. This can be achieved endoscopically either by polypectomy, endosciopic mucosal resection or endoscopic submucosal dissection.[ ] If this is not possible the tumors can be removed surgically via the anal canal either by Trans-Anal Excision (TAE), Transanal Endoscopic MicroSurgery (TEMS) of Trans-Anal Minimally Invasive Surgery (TAMIS). For tumors that are greater than 2 cm patients should undergo a rectal resection with a Total Mesorectal Excision (TME) either by anterior resection or abdomino-perineal resection. Tumors between 1 and 2 cms have been traditionally treated by local excision, however recent evidence suggest that tumor size greater than 1 cm along with lympho-vascular invasion and involvement of the muscularis propria is associated with tumor metastases and recurrence.[ , ] Consideration for rectal resection with TME should therefore be given for tumors between 1–2 cms, particularly if other adverse features such as LVI, muscularis involvement or intermediate NET are present.[ ]
For left colon WDNET, as these tumors are rare, there is little evidence to identify patients that are LN negative and therefore could be excised endoscopically. Again if the tumor can be removed by polypectomy or EMR with negative margins and is less than 1 cm this would seem a reasonable treatment option. If the margins are positive, the tumor is greater than 1 cm or there are high risk features such as intermediate grade NET or LVI, a standard left hemi-colectomy should be performed according to oncologic principles.[ ]
Patients with hingut WDNET rarely present distant metastatic disease with series reporting the incidence ranging between 5 and 10 %. (Table 2 ) The size of the tumor is the greatest factor associated with metastatic disease.[ ] As metastatic hindgut WNET tumors are rare treatment is extrapolated from metastatic disease of the more common midgut and forgut metastatic WDNET. The most common site of metastatic disease is the liver with other sites including the lung and retroperitoneal lymph nodes.[ ] Surgical resection can be considered for sites of respectable disease however recurrence rates are high.[ ] The mainstay of systemic treatment is somatostatin analogues such as octreotide both for limiting progression of disease and in the management of the symptoms of carcinoid syndrome. Surgical debulking of metastatic disease can also be considered for cases of severe carcinoid syndrome. Other liver directed therapies such as radio-frequency ablation and hepatic arterial embolization of the blood supply to the tumor may also offer some treatment benefit. Systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy has not shown to be of any benefit in metastatic WDNET outside of pancreatic WDNETs.[ ] Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy using radiolabeled somatostatin analogs has shown some benefit in metastatic unresectible WDNET however is not currently offered in the US outside of clinical trials.[ ] Table 2 Published reports of Hindgut WDNETs Paper Percentage Rectal WDNET Number of cases LN positive <10 mm LN positive 1–2 cm LN positive >2 cm Percentage Stage 1 on presentation 5 year Survival Lee et al.

Prognosis & Follow up
As most hindgut WDNET present as localized disease the prognosis is excellent with 5 year survival rates over 90 %. (Table 3 ) As recurrence are infrequent, particularly in tumors less than 1 cm in diameter an argument can be made for no follow up at all.[ ] For those lesions greater than 1 cm follow up can consist of yearly cross sectional imaging with either CT or MRI. Colonoscopy 1 year after resection with a further colonoscopy 4 years later would also seem to be a reasonable follow up protocol. Checking chromogranin A levels can be considered particularly if they were elevated pre-operatively. [ ] Table 3 Published reports of hindgut HGNECs Study Percentage Rectal HGNEC Number of cases Percentage metastatic disease Median survival Aytac et al. [ ] 64 % 25 36 % 15 months Smith et al. [ ] 48 % 128 67 % 13.2 months Shafqat et al. [ ] 27 % 1367 58 % 7.1 months
The prognosis for patients presenting with metastatic hindgut WDNETs is better than that for metastatic hindgut adenocarcinoma. Although rarely curable WDNET are slow growing and as such patients often live with the disease for some time. The reported 5 year survival rates for metastatic disease range from 17 to 20 %.[ , ]
High Grade Neuroendocrine Carcinomas
Compared to WDNET, HGNEC is essentially an entirely different disease. It is occurs much less frequently however behaves much more aggressively much more like the pulmonary equivalent, small cell carcinoma.[ ] It more commonly presents as metastatic disease particularly in the colon as local symptoms are not as apparent. Hindgut HGNECs present in the same manner as adenocarcinomas with rectal bleeding, change of bowel habit and tenesmus being the most common symptoms.[ ] Diagnosis is again made by colonoscopy and biopsy. Often HGNEC can occur in conjunction with colorectal adenocarcinomas. Where <1/3 of the tumor is adenocarcinoma, this is considered a HGNEC, where <1/3 is neuroendocrine it is considered and adenocarcinoma and where there are similar amounts of both histological variants they are classified as a collision tumor.[ ] There is some evidence that collision tumors, particularly if localized have an improved prognosis.[ ] Histologically HGNEC can also be either the small cell type or large cell type with some reports that large cell HGNEC may have a better prognosis.[ ]
Staging for localized and metastatic disease is the same as that for colorectal adenocarcinoma. CT chest abdomen and pelvis should be performed for distant staging. The most common sites of metastases are liver and lung. Local staging of rectal HGNEC can be performed using pelvic MRI or endorectal ultrasound. There is no role for octreotide scanning or checking for serum chromogranin A levels in HGNEC. HGNEC are PET avid however this modality may only offer benefit over CT scanning for indeterminate lesions.[ ]
Management
The management of HGNEC follows more closely that of adenocarcinoma rather than that of HGNEC. For localized disease, even with radical surgical resection, recurrence is common and as such adjuvant or neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy should be used. For localized colon HGNEC surgical resection followed by adjuvant chemotherapy should be performed. For rectal HGNEC, similar to rectal adenocarcinomas, management should start with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy as HGNEC appear to radiosensitive.[ ] As these tumors have a high systemic recurrence consideration should be given to follow on with systemic chemotherapy without surgery, particularly if there is a good response to radiotherapy. The reason for this is surgery; particularly major surgery like a rectal resection may delay systemic treatment, which is the patients’ best way of preventing systemic recurrence. In fact although the numbers are small in the largest series of colorectal HGNEC, resection of colorectal HGNEC did not appear to influence survival.[ ]
As hindgut HGNEC are uncommon with evidence limited to case series, chemotherapeutic treatment are derived from the management of the more frequent pulmonary HGNEC. Platinum based chemotherapy is therefore the treatment of choice. Published regimens include cisplatin with etopisoid or irinotecan.[ ] The most significant prognostic feature for localized disease appears to be an adenocarcinoma component included with the tumor (collision tumor). In this scenario the standard adjuvant treatment for colorectal cancer, 5-flourouracil with oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) can be used as oxaliplatin has been shown to have a response in HGNEC also.[ ]
For metastatic disease, unlike in adenocarcinoma, surgical resection does not appear to offer any survival benefit.[ ] Surgical management should therefore be reserved for emergency situations such as obstruction or bleeding. The optimal surgical option should be one which leads to the patient starting systemic chemotherapy as soon as possible, such as a diverting ostomy or colonic stent in the case of obstruction. Response to chemotherapy has been shown to be the most significant prognostic factor in this disease. Again platinum based chemotherapy is the treatment of choice.[ ]
Prognosis
The prognosis for patients with HGNEC is extremely poor in both localized and metastatic disease. The median survival has been reported as 10 months for metastatic disease and 27 months for localized disease. The most significant prognostic factor in metastatic disease is response to chemotherapy and the presence of a collision tumor. [ ]
Follow up for patients with localized disease after resection and adjuvant treatment again is the same as that for adenocarcinoma and consists of yearly CTs with a colonoscopy at 1 year.
Conclusion
Hindgut neuroendocrine neoplasia consists of a spectrum of diseases from the benign acting rectal WDNET to the highly aggressive rapidly fatal metastatic HGNEC. Tumor grade is the key distinguishing factor with management and prognosis dependent on this.
