Introduction
Women experience a range of signs and symptoms in their breasts during life time, more prominently in reproductive period. The major concern of any female with breast complaint is cancer. Breast cancer is the leading malignancy among the women throughout the world [ ]. According to WHO report, about 519,000 deaths associated with breast cancer occur annually [ ]. How those complaints relate to the subject of breast cancer is a matter of importance to patients and physicians. The primary goal of any health care system is detection of breast cancer, preferably at an early stage. Breast cancer has become the focus of a large number of research activities in recent decades. The introduction of “Breast Clinic” has remarkably changed our practice. Breast clinics can play a major role in early diagnosis and treatment of malignant breast disease, as well as ruling out malignancy and reassuring those without it [ , ]. Breast clinic also enhances the experience and expertise of the surgeons while gathering a large amount of data which provides an opportunity for further study and research. The final outcome is presumably an increase in the knowledge and improvement in the quality of care for patients with breast disease.
Although the main tool for detecting breast cancer is imaging, one principal question is which patient should have further investigation and follow-up based on initial clinical presentation. The answer may be found in the data collected from breast clinic.
The breast clinic also provides information about the magnitude of breast complaints and differential diagnosis and their share in the total number of patients.
The aim of this study was to find the distribution of presenting complaints among patients coming to a referral teaching hospital breast clinic and their relation to presence of benign vs. malignant disease.
Material and Method
This is a prospective study carried out at a breast clinic in a teaching hospital affiliated to a major university. We collected and analyzed the data from female patients presenting to breast clinic from February 25, 2012 to July 15, 2016. The collected data for each patient includes date of visit, age, chief complaint (including mastalgia, painful mass, painless mass, nipple discharge, nipple areola complex (NAC) deformity, mammographic (MMG) finding, and ultrasonographic (U/S) finding), and diagnosis (including benign disease, malignant disease, and undetermined). Patients who came or were referred for consult about their screening MMG or U/S finding were registered with chief complaint of MMG or U/S finding. If they had a clinical complaint that led to imaging, they were registered under the title of their clinical complaint. All the patients diagnosed as malignant have tissue diagnosis of malignancy. Many patients diagnosed as benign have tissue diagnosis but most of them are those with gross benign finding who were followed for at least 3 months. As a rule, any finding suggesting the least possibility of malignancy resulted in further imaging and tissue sampling in this group of patients. Those patients with equivocal finding at presentation, those who failed to come for a follow up visit, or to do imaging, or tissue sampling were classified as undetermined diagnosis and were excluded; however, their data is presented in a table.
Data analysis is based on descriptive purpose. Quantitative data are presented as mean ± standard deviation. Correlation between the clinical presentation and radiologic findings is analyzed in relation with the final pathology. Sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), and positive predictive value (PPV) are also calculated for each clinical presentation in terms of final diagnosis.
Results
Total number of visited patients was 1350, mean age 42.0578 ± 11.53464 years; min. 11 and max. 80. The number of undetermined cases was 120; these are excluded but their general data is shown in Table 4 . So the total number of patients included in the study is 1230 (100%).
Mastalgia was the most common presenting chief complaint. The number of patients with mastalgia was 675 (54.8%), mean age 40.7408 ± 10.57690 years; min. 16 and max. 72.
Painless mass was the second most common presenting chief complaint. Two hundred nine (16.9%) patients presented with painless mass, mean age 42.8514 ± 13.09942 years; min. 19 and max. 76.
Other presenting complaints in order of prevalence were as follows:
One hunded fifty-four (12.5%) patients presented with MMG finding, mean age 51.0635 ± 7.98244 years; min. 28 and max. 80.
One hundred twenty-seven (10.3%) patients presented with painful mass, mean age 36.2403 ± 10.25942 years; min. 17 and max. 65.
Thirty-six (2.9%) patients presented with nipple discharge, mean age 37.5135 ± 11.34466 years; min. 11 and max. 65.
Twenty-five (2%) patients presented with U/S finding, mean age 41.8611 ± 11.18456 years; min. 24 and max. 61.
Four (0.3%) patients presented with NAC deformity, mean age 53.0000 ± 11.17139 years; min. 38 and max. 68.
Table 1 shows chief complaints, their incidence, and mean age in patients with benign breast disease. The number of benign cases was 1079 (79.92%); mean age 41.0195 ± 11.36919 years; min. 11 and max. 80. In patients with benign disease, 1079 (100%), the most common clinical chief complaint was mastalgia 675 (62.55%), followed by painful mass 123 (11.39%), and painless mass 69 (6.39%) (Table 1 ).

The highest numbers of patients with benign disease were between 40 and 50; followed by those between 30 and 40. Near to 60% (59.49%) of patients with benign disease were between 30 and 50.
There was no malignant case in patients younger than 20. The highest numbers of patients with malignant disease were again between 40 and 50; followed by those between 30 and 40. More than 50% (51.64%) of patients with malignant disease were between 30 and 50.
Table 4 shows the data of patients with undetermined diagnosis. Total number of undetermined cases was 120 (8.88%); mean age 46.0167 ± 10.15922 years; min. 20 and max. 76. This included painless mass 40, MMG finding 35, painful mass 27, U/S finding 11, mastalgia 4, NAC deformity 2, and nipple discharge 1 patient.

Table 5 compares the incidence of different chief complaints between benign and malignant cases. No patient presenting with mastalgia had malignant disease. Strangely, none of the 4 patients with NAC deformity had malignancy. Malignant disease was rarely seen in patients presenting with MMG finding (3.3%), U/S finding (4%), painful mass (3.2%), and nipple discharge (2.8%). Two third (66.9%) of patients with painless mass had malignant disease.

Table 6 compares the mean age of patients with different chief complaints between benign and malignant groups. Only the age of patients with painless mass was significantly different between the 2 groups ( P value <0.0001).

The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for common clinical chief complaints in benign breast disease were calculated (Table 7 ). Noticeable findings are that mastalgia, painful mass, and nipple discharge all show high specificity and PPV for benign breast disease.

The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for common clinical chief complaints in malignant breast disease were calculated (Table 8 ). Notably, painless mass has high sensitivity, specificity, and NPV for malignant breast disease. In return, mastalgia, painful mass, and nipple discharge have very low sensitivity and PPV for malignant breast disease.

Discussion
The majority of patients presenting to outpatient breast clinic are young, and breast pain is the most common presenting symptom [ , ]. Patients with mastalgia are usually worried about cancer. This fear may disrupt their normal life style. Thus, reassurance plays a crucial role in these patients [ ]. Patients with mastalgia generally suffer from fibrocystic disorder. US breast study can diagnose cysts that maybe aspirated at the same time [ , ]. Fibrocystic disorder of breast can be managed with vitamin E, primrose extract, NSAIDS, and anti-estrogen therapies [ , , ]. As a rule, any mass in the breast should be considered for tissue diagnosis, whether painful or painless [ , ]. Tissue sample in a hardly palpable mass is best achieved under the guide of imaging, generally US. Imaging findings suggestive of malignancy with no palpable mass are best sampled by stereotactic technique or excised after wire localization. There are still a number of patients with breast cancer who are being misled [ ]. Patients with breast complaint may present to a nurse clinician, midwife, general practitioner, family physician, internist, and gynecologist, before finally visiting a general/breast surgeon. The public and the physicians should be informed and reminded again and again about the importance of “Breast Mass”. Everyone should know that a female with breast mass must promptly visit a general/breast surgeon or a breast clinic.
In this study, 1230 patients with breast complaints who presented to an outpatient breast clinic in a referral teaching hospital were studied. About 80% had benign disease. The mean age of patients with malignant disease was higher than that with benign disease ( p < .0001). More than half of patients (54.8%) presented with mastalgia. Mastalgia was near 3 times more common than the second most common presenting chief complaint. All the patients with mastalgia had benign disease. Among patients with benign breast disease, more than 62% presented with mastalgia. These observations underline the significance of mastalgia as an epidemiologically major complaint among female population. Mastalgia is a chronic and relapsing ailment; and is the source of anxiety and fear from breast cancer more than any other symptom. Considering its prevalence and psychological burden, mastalgia deserves more attention from physicians and researchers.
Painless mass was second to mastalgia as the most common presenting chief complaint (16.9%). Approximately, 1 out of every 6 patients came to the breast clinic because of a painless mass in breast. Almost 1 out of every 3 (33.1%) patients presenting with painless mass had benign disease; almost all of them were fibroadenoma. Although painless mass was the most common presenting chief complaint (92.71%) in patients with malignant disease, only 66.9% of patients with painless mass as their chief complaint had malignant disease. The mean age of patients with painless mass who have benign disease is 33.30 ± 11.41; while the mean age of patients with painless mass who have malignant disease is 46.35 ± 12.15. The difference is significant, p value <0.0001. Therefore, painless mass in younger age, below 35, is associated with benign disease while in a decade later, above 45, is associated with malignant disease. Painless mass is not always associated with malignancy and other factors including age and specifications of the mass decide for its benign vs. malignant nature.
The most common age period for both benign and malignant breast disease was between 30 and 50 years. So age cannot be used to discriminate benign from malignant disease in middle ages. However, near to one third of malignant cases were between 50 and 70 years compared to about one fifth of benign cases. This means that malignancy happens more frequently than benign disease between 50 and 70. There is a significant decrease in number of patients with benign disease after 60. After 70 years, the incidence of both benign and malignant breast disease drops and approaches to nil. Averagely, age distribution was more even in malignant cases. This may be related to the multi-factorial etiology of malignant breast disease; while benign breast diseases is mainly related to female reproductive hormone-receptor disorder and almost ablates after establishment of menopause.
The ratio of benign to malignant breast disease, while approaching extreme, below 20, because of no malignant case, slowly decreases from about 10 to 1 between 20 and 30 years to less than 1 to 1 above 70 years of age. This means that with increasing age, relatively more malignant disease happens. This is in accordance with the conventional viewpoint that malignant disease happens more with increasing age, although this may be a relative event.
Comparing incidence of chief complaints between benign and malignant cases, all the patients presenting with mastalgia, which is the most common presenting chief complaint and about 97% of patients with painful breast mass and nipple discharge had benign disease. It may be concluded that patients with mastalgia, painful breast mass, and nipple discharge can be strongly assured about the benign origin of their disease. Patients seeking advice for MMG and U/S finding rarely ended up in malignant disease. 96.7% of patients with MMG finding and 96% of those with U/S finding had benign disease. This is in concordance with recent statistical evidence underscoring the role of screening MMG in finding early breast cancer.
When the incidence of different chief complaints was compared, between benign and malignant cases, only painless mass was >2 times more common in malignant cases. Other presenting chief complaints were overwhelmingly more common in benign cases. Therefore, among clinical breast complaints, only painless mass is considered as suggestive for malignancy.
The sensitivity of mastalgia for benign breast disease is 62.6%. This is to say 62.6% of patients with benign breast disease have mastalgia, as their chief complaint. The specificity of mastalgia for benign breast disease is 100%. This is to say 100% of patients who present with mastalgia, as their chief complaint, have benign breast disease. The positive predictive value (PPV) of mastalgia for benign breast disease is 100%. This to say 100% of patients with mastalgia have benign breast disease.
The specificity and PPV for painful mass and nipple discharge are close to 100%, which means that almost all the patients with these chief complaints have benign breast disease.
The specificity of painless mass for malignancy is 93.6%. Therefore, when a patient presents with a painless breast mass, the probability of malignancy is 93.6%. The negative predictive value of painless mass for malignancy is 98.92%. This is to say if a patient does not have painless mass, the probability of not having malignant disease is 98.92%.
Near to 9% of total number of patients visited fell in the undetermined diagnosis group, which is a relatively high number. Since this data collection is continuing, we should decrease this percentage. When patients were distributed into subgroups, sometimes their number decreased below the level that could be analyzed statistically. We plan to continue this study and find more statistically meaningful differences among subgroups when the number of our cases has increased significantly.
Conclusion
Mastalgia is equal to benign disease, but it is a major cause of malaise and concern in women. Mastalgia requires more attention by health service. Painless mass is highly suggestive of malignancy but not the sine qua non for it. Our practice of requesting MMG and breast U/S contributes little to early detection of breast cancer.
