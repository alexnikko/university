Introduction
Compared to conventional solid dosage form, such as tablet and capsules, fast-dissolving tablets (FDTs) offer an ease of administration and patient compliance for geriatric, uncooperative, and pediatric patients who experience difficulty in swallowing conventional tablets [ ]. Moreover, patients traveling with little or no access to water limit utility of oral conventional tablets or capsules [ ]. The fast disintegration of tablets inside the mouth may improve the dissolution and absorption of drugs having acceptable salivary solubility throughout the buccal, esophagus, and stomach mucosa, resulting in rapid onset of action.
The masking of bitter taste and the good mouth feel of FDTs are critical factors in ensuring patient compliance. In addition, development of FDTs, in which taste is masked and drug dissolution is improved, is a major challenge especially in case of extremely bitter high-dose drugs with poor water solubility [ , ].
Aceclofenac is a potent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), used in inflammatory and painful conditions of rheumatic and nonrheumatic origin. Because it is used in acute painful conditions where prompt and quick action is required, aceclofenac is considered as an ideal drug to be formulated as FDT. However, the formulation of aceclofenac into FDT poses great challenge due to the following reasons: (1) aceclofenac suffers from low aqueous solubility leading to poor dissolution and insufficient oral bioavailability especially in acidic pH of stomach (21.93 ± 0.257 μg/ml at 25 °C) [ ]. Aceclofenac is an example of BCS class II compound (highly permeable and low soluble); its oral bioavailability is determined by dissolution rate at the absorption site [ ]. (2) Aceclofenac is extremely bitter drug with high dose (100 mg).
Complexing drugs with cyclodextrin is able to increase solubility, improve dissolution rate, mask bitter taste, enhance stability, decrease tissue irritation upon dosing, and enhance drug bioavailability [ , ]. However, the efficiency of cyclodextrin to mask the bitter taste and increase drug solubility is limited by the high dose of the drug. Recently, numerous scientific articles describe the complexation of aceclofenac with β-cyclodextrins and its characterization [ , ]. To our knowledge, no reported trials were so far adopted to solve all the challenge problems related to the administration of aceclofenac as FDTs using β-cyclodextrin. The 1:2 M ratio of aceclofenac-β-cyclodextrin complex prepared by Dua et al. showed only 66.5 % of drug dissolved in phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 after 2 h, and 60.2 % in 0.1 N HCl, pH 1.2 after 2 h, which is not sufficient enough for the quick analgesic action required from aceclofenac FDTs [ ]. The ability of water-soluble excipients to enhance the solubilizing effect of β-cyclodextrins has been demonstrated [ ]. Literature lacks any data about the role of the combined use of mannitol and citric acid to improve taste masking and solubilizing properties of β-cyclodextrin.
The goal of our work was to study the combined use of citric acid, mannitol, and β-cyclodextrin to prepare acid soluble taste masked granules of aceclofenac (ASTMGA). FDTs containing ASTMGA using certain sugar/cellulose-based directly compressible diluents and different tablet superdisintegrants were developed. General factorial design was applied to optimize formulation having optimum disintegration and able to completely mask the extremely bitter taste of the high-dose drug and enhance its dissolution in simulated gastric fluid required for the quick action of aceclofenac. In vivo oral study for determination of in vivo disintegration and taste evaluation of the prepared FDTs was performed using healthy human volunteers.

Phase Solubility Study to Study the Effect of Citric Acid on the Solubility of Aceclofenac β-Cyclodextrin Mixture
An excess of aceclofenac-β-cyclodextrin mixture (1:1.5 molar ratio) was added to screw-capped glass vials containing 10-ml aqueous solution containing 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 % citric acid. Bottles were mechanically shaken at 37 ± 0.5 °C for 24 h. The supernatant was filtered through a Millipore filter (pore size 0.45 μm). The filtrate was immediately analyzed spectrophotometrically at λ max 274 nm after appropriate dilutions. All experiments were conducted in duplicate.
Phase Solubility Study to Study the Effect of Mannitol on the Solubility of Aceclofenac-β-Cyclodextrin-Citric Acid Triple Mixture
Aceclofenac-β-cyclodextrin mixture (1:1.5 molar ratio) equivalent to 100-mg drug was physically mixed in glass mortar with 25 mg citric acid for 5 min. An excess of the triple mixture was added to screw-capped glass vials containing 10-ml aqueous solution of 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 % mannitol. Bottles were mechanically shaken at 37 ± 0.5 °C for 24 h. The supernatant was filtered through a Millipore filter (pore size 0.45 μm).The filtrate was immediately analyzed spectrophotometrically at λ max 274 nm after appropriate dilutions.

The mixture was levigated in a glass mortar with sufficient amount of 50 % ethyl alcohol solution for 20 min. The resulting mixture was dried at room temperature for 24 h and sieved through a 40-mesh sieve and stored in desiccators at room temperature for 48 h. The dried mixture was mixed with the weighed amount of mannitol (150 mg) in a mortar to form ASTMGA.
Evaluation of the Prepared ASTMGA
Taste Masking Properties of the Prepared ASTMGA
ASTMGA containing different amount of β-cyclodextrin (1 kg) were prepared under good manufacturing practices (GMP) and studied in three healthy male volunteers. The volunteers were selected based on their ability to discriminate and rank the bitterness of several dilutions of aceclofenac solution, and their taste threshold should be the same. The volunteers were informed of the purpose and protocol of the study. The protocol was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo University. It was conducted according to specifications of the Declaration of Helsinki (1964). An amount of ASTMGA equivalent to 100 mg aceclofenac was placed on the tongue of volunteers without water. Taste evaluation was based on the extent of bitterness after 1 min where the volunteers were asked to record the level of bitterness. The mouth was rinsed after each measurement. The wash out period between testing samples was 30 min. A numerical scale was used with the following values: 0 = tasteless, 1 = slightly bitter, 2 = moderately bitter, 3 = bitter, and 4 = strongly bitter.
Saturation Solubility of Aceclofenac and the Prepared ASTMGA in Distilled Water, 0.1 N HCl, pH 1.2, and Phosphate Buffer, pH 6.8
A known excess amount of aceclofenac and the prepared ASTMGA was shaken with either 50 ml distilled water, 0.1 N HCl, pH 1.2, or phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, in screw-capped glass vials then left in a thermostatically controlled shaking water bath set at 37 ± 0.5 °C for 24 h. The supernatant was filtered through a Millipore filter (pore size 0.45 μm). The filtrate was immediately analyzed spectrophotometrically at λ max 274 nm after appropriate dilutions. All experiments were conducted in duplicate.
Flow Properties of the Prepared ASTMGA
The flow properties of the prepared ASTMGA were estimated by determining Carrs index and Hausner’s ratio [ ]. The bulk density and tap densities were determined for the calculation of Hausner’s ratio and Carr’s index.
Differential Scanning Calorimetry
Differential scanning calorimetry was performed using Shimadzu differential scanning calorimeter. Samples (3–4 mg) were placed in aluminum pan and heated in the rate of 10 °C/min, to a temperature of 330 °C. The instrument was calibrated with indium, and dry nitrogen was used as a carrier gas with a flow rate of 25 ml/min. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) studies were performed for the drug, β-cyclodextrin, ASTMGA, and physical mixtures of drug, β-cyclodextrin and citric acid.
Formulation Optimization of FDTs Containing ASTMGA and Sugar/Cellulose-Based Excipients Using General Factorial Experimental Design
General factorial design was proposed for optimization of FDTs containing ASTMGA. The type of sugar/cellulose-based directly compressible diluents, X 1 (GalenIQ® and Prosolv®), superdisintegrant type, X 2 (Crospovidone®, Glycolys®, and Ac-Di-Sol®), and superdisintegrant concentration, X 3 (10 and 20 %) were selected as independent variables. The dependent variables (responses) were in vitro disintegration time and initial dissolution rate (IDR). The statistical analysis was performed using Minitab® computer software.
Compression of FDTs Containing ASTMGA
All of the formulation components other than the lubricant (Pruv®) and glidant (Aerosil®) were accurately weighed and mixed with the previously prepared ASTMGA (containing 1:1.15 M ratio) in a mortar for 5 min. The obtained blend was mixed with Aerosil® and lubricated with Pruv® for another 5 min and then compressed into 17 mm FDTs using a single punch machine. The amount of all the tablet components other than superdisintegrants and diluent were kept constant. Batches of 100 flat tablets (1,100 mg each), containing 100 mg of aceclofenac per tablet, were prepared and exposed to further investigation. The composition of FDTs containing ASTMGA is presented in Table 1 .

Evaluation of FDTs Containing ASTMGA
Physical Characterization
FDTs were evaluated by carrying out tests for friability, hardness, and content uniformity. All the tests were carried out in triplicate and according to the compendial specifications (British Pharmacopeia, 2013).
In Vitro Disintegration Study
The in vitro disintegration test was carried out on six tablets in phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, at 37 ° C using the USP disintegration apparatus (Logan Instruments Incorporation, NJ, USA).
Determination of Wetting Time
Wetting time test mimics the action of saliva in contact with tablet in buccal cavity to measure the capillarity and porosity of the FDTs [ ]. Wetting time of aceclofenac FDTs was determined by placing five circular tissue papers in a Petri dish of 10-cm diameter. Ten milliliters of water containing a water-soluble red dye was added to the Petri dish. The dye solution was used to identify complete wetting of the tablet surface. Aceclofenac FDT was carefully placed on the surface of the tissue paper in the Petri dish at ambient temperature. The time required for water to reach the upper surface of the tablets and to completely wet them was noted as the wetting time [ , , ]. These measurements were carried out in replicates of three. Wetting time was recorded using a stopwatch.
In Vitro Dissolution Study of Aceclofenac FDT
In vitro dissolution of aceclofenac in phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) was performed to study the extent of drug dissolution enhancement. The dissolution of aceclofenac from its FDTs was performed in 900 ml phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) and 0.1 N HCl, pH 1.2, maintained at 37 ± 0.5 °C using the USP Dissolution Tester Apparatus II (VK 700, Vankel, USA), at a rotation speed of 50 rpm [ ]. Aliquots from the dissolution medium were withdrawn at 5-, 10-, 15-, 20-, 30-, 45-, and 60-min time intervals. The samples were replaced with fresh dissolution medium of same quantity in order to maintain the volume in the vessel constant. Samples were filtered using 0.45-μm Millipore filter and properly diluted prior to measuring their absorbance spectrophotometrically for aceclofenac content at λ max (274 nm) against phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) as a blank.
In Vivo Oral Study of FDTs
In vivo oral study was carried out in three healthy volunteers (two men and one woman) who were selected as previously mentioned in taste masking properties of the prepared ASTMGA. The volunteers were informed of the purpose and protocol of the study. The protocol was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo University, Egypt. The volunteers were asked to rinse their mouth with 200 ml water. FDTs used in this study (1,000 tablets) were prepared under GMP. The FDT was placed on the tongue and immediately a stopwatch was started as soon as the tablet contacts the tongue. The volunteers were instructed to gently move the tablet against the upper part of the mouth with their tongue and to cause a gentle tumbling action on the tablet [ ]. The time until the volunteers felt that the tablet had disappeared in their mouths was recorded as in vivo disintegration time. Taste evaluation was based on the mouth feel and the extent of bitterness. The bitterness of aceclofenac FDTs were described as strongly bitter, bitter, moderately bitter, slightly bitter, and no bitterness.
Stability Study of the Selected Aceclofenac FDT in Different Packaging Materials
The selected FDT was packed in aluminum/aluminum (Al/Al) blisters and glass bottles. The accelerated stability study was carried out according to ICH guidelines at 40 ± 2 °C/75 ± 5% RH for 6 months. Samples were withdrawn at 1, 3, and 6 months and analyzed for drug content, hardness, and disintegration time. A validated stability indicating reverse-phase HPLC method was used for quantitative determination of aceclofenac over the period of 6 months [ ].
Results and Discussion
Phase Solubility Studies
Saturation solubility of the pure drug and the prepared ASTMGA in distilled water is shown in Table 2 . Aceclofenac is almost insoluble in water, with saturation solubility of 60.49 ± 1.3 μg/ml. Figure 1a shows the phase solubility diagram of aceclofenac-β-cyclodextrin mixture (1:1.5 M ratio) in the presence of citric acid. The solubility of aceclofenac-β-cyclodextrin binary mixture in the absence of citric acid was 385.6 ± 14.5 μg/ml which means that mixing β-cyclodextrin with aceclofenac increased its solubility by 6.37 times. Addition of citric acid increased the solubility of the drug where maximum solubility (467.79 ± 3.9 μg/ml) was obtained at 0.25 % citric acid solution (corresponding to 25 mg citric for each 100 mg drug and 481 mg β-cyclodextrin). The solubility of aceclofenac was increased in water by more than 7.7 times. Pokharkar et al. found that the addition of citric acid along with β-cyclodextrin resulted in an increase in solubility of carvedilol to a much greater extent compared to complexation of the drug with β-cyclodextrin alone. This may be attributed to the fact that organic hydroxy organic acids such as citric acid are able to increase the stability constant of the complex [ ]. Moreover, it was found that hydroxy organic acids such as citric, tartaric, and ascorbic acid strongly enhance the aqueous solubility of β-cyclodextrin. Aqueous solution of citric acid (140 mg/ml) can solubilize large amount of β-cyclodextrin (up to 200 mg/ml) [ , ]. The increase of the solubility of β-cyclodextrin leads to increase of the solubility of molecular inclusion complex and consequently, the solubility of the drug. Figure 1b shows the phase solubility diagram of aceclofenac-β-cyclodextrin-citric acid triple mixture in presence of mannitol. The solubility of triple mixture in absence of mannitol was 467.79 ± 3.9 μg/ml. Addition of mannitol increased the solubility of aceclofenac where maximum solubility (565.50 ± 14.1 μg/ml) was obtained at 1.5 % mannitol solution (corresponding to 150 mg mannitol for each 100 mg drug, 481 mg β-cyclodextrin, and 25 mg citric acid). The solubility of aceclofenac in water was increased by more than 9.3 times due to the synergistic action of mannitol and citric acid on the solubilizing properties of β-cyclodextrin.

To test the effect of method of preparation, ASTMGA containing 150 mg mannitol, 25 mg citric acid, drug, and β-cyclodextrin were prepared by kneading aceclofenac and β-cyclodextrin in different molar ratios with 50 % ethyl alcohol solution. The hydroalcoholic solvent was used to allow the partial solubility of both drug and β-cyclodextrin to facilitate the formation of molecular inclusion complex between them. As shown in Table 2 , ASTMGA containing drug β-cyclodextrin in molar ratio of 1:1.5 and 1:2 shows a remarkable increase in solubility of drug (12- and 14-fold, respectively) in distilled water. This remarkable increase of drug solubility confirms that the method of preparation (kneading with alcohol) enhanced the formation of water-soluble inclusion complex of the drug with β-cyclodextrin in addition to the solubilizing effect of citric acid and mannitol on the drug β-cyclodextrin complex [ ].
The synergistic effect of citric acid, mannitol, and β-cyclodextrin on the solubility of aceclofenac was also observed in other media such as 0.1 N HCl and phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, where the solubility of pure drug was 16.07 ± 2.1 and 4,292.32 ± 22.7 μg/ml, respectively. ASTMGA containing drug β-cyclodextrin in molar ratio of 1:1.5 shows a remarkable increase in solubility of drug in 0.1 N HCl which was found to be 316.06 ± 12.7 μg/ml. Moreover, ASTMGA containing drug β-cyclodextrin in molar ratio of 1:1.5 shows a remarkable increase in solubility of drug in phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, which was found to be 6,445.55 ± 54.6 μg/ml.
Taste Masking Properties of ASTMGA
The results of the taste masking test are listed in Table 2 . ASTMGA of molar ratios 1:0.5 and 1:1 showed average bitterness scores of 4 and 3, respectively, indicating that the amount of β-cyclodextrin was not sufficient to alleviate the bitterness of aceclofenac. The smallest taste scores obtained by ASTMGA of drug β-cyclodextrin molar ratio of 1:1.5 and 1:2 indicated that the amount of β-cyclodextrin in these molar ratios is sufficient to suppress the bitterness of the drug. The suppressive effect of β-cyclodextrin on bitterness could be ascribed to the formation of inclusion complex with the drug [ , ]. Citric acid imparted more masking properties to the prepared ASTMGA due to its self-flavored taste and ability to enhance the inclusion of the drug in the three-dimensional structure of β-cyclodextrin. Aceclofenac can be held in two molecular inclusion complexes with β-cyclodextrin. It can be associated, due to the H-bond, as well as the hydrophobic interactions, more tightly in dimeric β-cyclodextrin than the monomeric form, in which the H-bond was found to be absent [ ]. Citric acid may facilitate the association of aceclofenac with β-cyclodextrin through reducing its ionization and increasing its hydrophobic properties. Moreover, the sweet taste of mannitol aids in masking the bitter taste of aceclofenac. ASTMGA of drug β-cyclodextrin molar ratio of 1:1.5 rather than 1:2 molar ratio was used for further studies as it had lower amount of β-cyclodextrin, and consequently, the weight of ASTMGA is more suitable to be incorporated into FDT.
Flow Properties of ASTMGA
The powder flowability of ASTMGA was determined using Hausner’s ratio and Carr’s index. Hausner’s ratio (HR) was related to the interparticle friction; granules with a low interparticle friction had a ratio of approximately 1.25, indicating a good flow. All ASTMGA showed acceptable Hausner’s ratio. Powders with Carr’s index (CI) below 25 % have acceptable flowability while powders with CI below 18 % are considered very flowing [ ]. All ASTMGA had CI ranged from 15.5 to 18.3 % which means that all ASTMGA have acceptable flow.
Differential scanning calorimetry
DSC is useful in the investigation of solid-state interactions. The DSC analysis of pure aceclofenac showed a sharp endothermic peak at 152.9 °C corresponding to its melting point (Fig. 2 ). The thermogram of β-cyclodextrin exhibited a very broad endothermic peak between 60 and 120 °C (maximum at 116 °C) corresponding to release of water molecules [ ]. The DSC thermogram of physical mixture show peaks of both β-cyclodextrin and aceclofenac. The DSC thermogram of ASTMGA shows significant reduction in the endothermic peak of drug. The reduction of this peak may be probably due to the formation of inclusion complexes between drug and β-cyclodextrin and the presence of most of the drug in an amorphous state. Fig. 2 The DSC thermograms of aceclofenac, Kleptose®, ASTMGA, and physical mixtures
Formulation Optimization of FDTs Containing ASTMGA
In order to rapidly obtain the optimal FDTs, general factorial design was applied in this study. The type of diluent, X 1 (Galen IQ® and Prosolv®), superdisintegrant type, X 2 (Crospovidone®, Glycolys®, and Ac-Di-Sol®), and superdisintegrant concentration, X 3 (10 and 20 %) were selected as independent variables. The dependent variables (responses) were in vitro disintegration time (s) and IDR.
The optimum FDT of this study is selected to have optimum disintegration (<30 s), acceptable taste, and enhanced drug dissolution. Thus, different sugar/cellulose-based excipients were used to optimize disintegration, dissolution, and organoleptic properties of FDTs. GalenIQ™ 721 is a high-soluble agglomerated spherical isomalt for direct compression applications. It has pleasant sugar-like, natural sweet taste profile with very low hygroscopic properties [ ]. Prosolv® SMCC is silicified microcrystalline cellulose, a patented combination of 98 % microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) and 2 % colloidal silicon dioxide. Prosolv® SMCC imparts both optimum compaction and flow to drug formulations [ ]. Pearlitol®, a granulated mannitol, is white, odorless, slightly sweet tasting, crystalline powder. It is an excellent excipient for direct compression. It dissolves very rapidly because of its porous crystalline particles [ ].
Physical Characterization of FDTs
Aceclofenac content in all FDTs lied within the range of 98.1 ± 0.4 to 101.7 ± 1.0 %. All FDTs showed good mechanical strength with friability less than 1 % (within the Pharmacopoeia limit). The prepared FDTs had good mechanical strength with appropriate hardness in the range of 4.7 ± 0.1 to 5.7 ± 0.3 kg/cm 2 which indicates good mechanical strength with an ability to counter physical and mechanical stress conditions while handling [ ].
Wetting Time of Aceclofenac FDTs
The wetting time of the prepared aceclofenac FDTs are presented in Table 1 . FDTs containing Galen as a diluents and Glycolys® as disintegrant (FDT 3 and FDT 4) showed the longest wetting time which was 112.38 and 97.55 s, respectively. This could be due to the excellent compressible properties of Galen and the consequent reduction of porosity in the tablet structure. Moreover, Glycolys® formed a compact gel with Galen on contact with water preventing further penetration of water into the matrix of FDTs. It was also observed that FDTs containing Prosolv and Crospovidone® (FDT 9 and FDT 10) had the least wetting time (18.29 and 23.33, respectively). Faster wetting of FDTs containing Crospovidone® might be due to its porous particle structure that enables them to rapidly absorb liquids into the tablet by capillary action and to generate rapid volume expansion and hydrostatic pressures that result in tablet disintegration [ ].
Analysis of the Factorial Design
General factorial experimental design was designed to evaluate main effects and interactions of the three chosen variables that may affect the disintegration time and dissolution rate of drug from FDTs.
Effect of Formulation Excipients on the In Vitro Disintegration Time of the Prepared FDTs
In vitro disintegration time is the most important parameter that needs to be optimized in the development of FDTs. The in vitro disintegration times of the prepared FDTs are exhibited in Table 1 . The shortest disintegration time was observed with FDT-10 which contains Prosolv® as diluent and Crospovidone® as a disintegrant in concentration of 20 %. Figure 3 illustrates graphically the mean effect plots (Fig. 3 a) and the interaction plots (Fig. 3 b) for in vitro disintegration time of aceclofenac FDTs at different levels of each factor. The disintegration time of FDTs containing Crospovidone® is significantly lower than that containing Ac-Di-Sol® and Glycolys® D ( p < 0.0001). It was reported by many authors that Crospovidone® had a superior effect on decreasing the disintegration time than Ac-Di-Sol® or Glycolys® [ , , ]. This is due to small particle size and rapid capillary effect of Crospovidone®. Moreover, disintegration properties of Crospovidone® are not affected by pH and consequently not bind to ionic drug molecules. Finally, it does not form a gel at higher concentrations unlike other superdisintegrants [ ]. It was reported that increasing Crospovidone® concentration optimizes tablet friability due to production of mechanically strong tablets [ ]. Unlike Glycolys® and Ac-Di-Sol® which depend principally on swelling for disintegration, Crospovidone® use a combination of swelling and wicking[ ]. Fig. 3 The mean effect plots ( a ) and the interaction plots ( b ) for in vitro DT of aceclofenac FDTs at different levels of each factor
As shown in Fig. 3 , FDTs containing Prosolv® showed significantly shorter disintegration time compared to that containing Galen® ( p < 0.0001) whereas the superdisintegrant concentration had a nonsignificant effect on in vitro disintegration time ( p = 0.623). Figure 3b shows the interaction plot between the different factors on mean disintegration time of FDTs. The effect of superdisintegrant concentration on the disintegration time of aceclofenac FDTs depends on the type of both superdisintegrant and diluents. Increasing the concentration of superdisintegrant in aceclofenac FDTs containing Crospovidone® or Ac-Di-Sol® slightly decreased the disintegration time whereas the reverse occurred in FDTs containing Glycolys®. The observation is obvious in FDT containing Galen® as a diluent and Glycolys® as a disintegrant whereas increasing the concentration of Glycolys® from 10 % (FDT 3) to 20 % (FDT 4) increased the disintegration time of FDTs from 73.50 to 86.28 s. This could be attributed to the viscous gel layer formed by Glycolys® especially in the presence of Galen®. That gel layer blocked the tablet pores and prevented further penetration of water into the inner layers of the tablet leading to increased disintegration time and normally decreased drug release [ , ]. This observation correlates well with the results of wetting time.
FDT 9 and FDT 10 formulated with Prosolv® as a diluents and Crospovidone® as a disintegrant (10 or 20 %, respectively) had significantly lower mean disintegration time (18.66 and 18.18 s, respectively) than that formulated with Galen® as a diluent and Glycolys® as a disintegrant. FDTs containing Crospovidone® quickly wicks water into the tablet to generate hydrostatic pressure necessary to provide rapid disintegration.
Effect of Formulation Excipients on the In Vitro IDR of Aceclofenac from the Prepared FDTs
The in vitro dissolution data of the prepared FDTs are shown in Table 1 . FDT 9 and FDT 10, composed of Prosolv® and Crospovidone®, gave the highest values of IDR, 18.091 and 18.010 %/min, respectively. The higher IDR values could be due to the lowest values of disintegration time of FDT 9 and FDT 10 (18.66 and 18.18 s, respectively). FDT 3 and FDT 4, composed of Galen® and Glycolys®, gave the lowest values of IDR and highest values of disintegration time, 4.63 and 4.55 %/min and 73.50 and 86.28 s, respectively. It is worthy to note that the shorter the disintegration time, the faster the drug dissolution from the prepared FDTs.
Figure 4 illustrates graphically the mean effect plots (Fig. 4 a) and the interaction plots (Fig. 4 b) for IDR of aceclofenac FDTs at different levels of each factor. As shown, aceclofenac FDTs formulated with Crospovidone® as a disintegrant had the highest IDR. FDTs containing Prosolv® showed significantly higher IDR compared to that containing Galen® ( p < 0.0001) whereas the superdisintegrant concentration had a nonsignificant effect on in vitro IDR ( p = 0.484). Figure 4b shows the interaction plot between the different factors on mean IDR of FDTs. The effect of concentration of superdisintegrant on the IDR of aceclofenac FDTs depends on the type of superdisintegrant. Although increasing the concentration of superdisintegrant in aceclofenac FDTs containing Crospovidone® or Ac-Di-Sol® slightly increased IDR from FDTs, it decreased the dissolution rate of drug from FDTs containing Glycolys®. The results of IDR correlates well with the in vitro disintegration time as confirmed by the good correlation coefficient ( r = 0.9630) between IDR and disintegration time.

The presence of citric acid, mannitol, and β-cyclodextrin in the formula of FDT plays an important role in increasing the dissolution rate of aceclofenac. Figure 5 shows the dissolution profiles of pure aceclofenac and FDT 9 (composed of 756 mg ASTMGA, 110 mg Crospovidone, 157 mg Prosolv®, 11 mg Pruv®, 11 mg Aerosil®, 22 mg mint flavor, and 33 mg aspartame) in 900 ml phosphate buffer, pH 6.8. FDT 9 released up to 90 % of the drug in 5 min, whereas aceclofenac exhibited the dissolution of 18.7 ± 3.7 % after 5 min and about 35.1 ± 3.8 % after 60 min under the same conditions. The increase in the dissolution rate is due to the formation of water-soluble inclusion complexes with β-cyclodextrin. The water molecules in the cavities of β-cyclodextrin are in an energetically unfavored state because of the nonpolar nature of the cavity. Thus, replacement of high-energy water molecules in the cavity with a hydrophobic guest (aceclofenac) is the driving force for the formation of water-soluble inclusion complex in an aqueous solution [ ]. The interactions between the hydrophobic part of the guest and the apolar cavity cause dehydration of the hydrophobic guest molecule, thereby increasing the affinity toward water and hence increasing the dissolution [ ]. Surfactant-like properties of β-cyclodextrin can reduce the interfacial tension between the solid particles of drug and water, leading to a greater rate of dissolution [ ]. Fig. 5 The dissolution profiles of pure aceclofenac and FDT 9 in 900 ml phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, and 0.1 N HCl, pH 1.2
The great and remarkable increase (about 5-fold) in aceclofenac dissolution rate in phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, cannot be explained only based on the formation of water-soluble molecular inclusion complex with β-cyclodextrin. Dua et al. used higher amount of β-cyclodextrin and found that the 1:2 molar ratio of aceclofenac-β-cyclodextrin complex showed only 66.5 % of drug dissolved in phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, after 2 h and 60.2 % in 0.1 N HCl, pH 1.2, after 2 h [ ]. Thus, the other excipients must have an important role in enhancing dissolution rate of the drug. Citric acid, as previously mentioned, may facilitate the association of aceclofenac with β-cyclodextrin through reducing its ionization and increasing its hydrophobic properties. Moreover, it can strongly enhance the aqueous solubility of β-cyclodextrin leading to enhancement of solubility and dissolution of aceclofenac associated in the inclusion complex. Mannitol can partially enhance the dissolution of aceclofenac through wetting of the hydrophobic surface of aceclofenac. The synergistic effect of mannitol, β-cyclodextrin, and citric acid on enhancement of aceclofenac dissolution is more obvious in 0.1 N HCl, pH 1.2. Figure 5 shows the dissolution profiles of pure aceclofenac and FDT 9 (equivalent to 100 mg drug) in 900-ml 0.1 N HCl. Aceclofenac exhibited the dissolution of 3.4 ± 3.4 % after 5 min and about 11.6 ± 4.8 % after 60 min, whereas FDT 9 released up to 64.7 ± 4.2 % of the drug in 5 min (19-fold increase in dissolution). Aceclofenac and FDT 9 showed better dissolution profiles in phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, in comparison to 0.1 N HCl, pH 1.2. This may be due to the weakly acidic nature of aceclofenac [ ].
The combination of mannitol, citric acid, and β-cyclodextrin in aceclofenac FDT was able to enhance the dissolution of the drug in simulated gastric fluid with greater extent than the conventional aceclofenac-β-cyclodextrin inclusion complex which ensure rapid onset of action of the prepared FDT.
In Vivo Oral Study of FDTs
The in vivo disintegration time of the prepared FDTs is exhibited in Table 1 . FDT 9 and FDT 10 formulated with Prosolv® and Crospovidone® showed the least in vivo disintegration time (17.54 and 21.87 s). As shown in Fig. 6 , there is a very good correlation between the in vivo disintegration time and in vitro disintegration time as confirmed by the good correlation coefficient ( r = 0.9806). Moreover, there is a very good correlation between the in vivo disintegration time and IDR ( r = 0.9447). All FDTs had a good and acceptable mouth feel and acceptable taste. The combination of mint flavor, aspartame, and other sugar-based excipients with ASTMGA attributed to better palatability of FDTs. The in vivo oral study demonstrates the applicability of the formulation of FDT 9 for potential commercial use Fig. 6 The correlation profiles between in vitro disintegration time (DT), in vivo DT, and IDR
FDT 9 and FDT 10 had similar disintegration and dissolution rates and comparable ability to mask the bitter taste of the drug. FDT 9 was selected (due to its lower content of Crospovidone®) to study its physical and chemical stability under stress conditions.
Stability Study of the Selected Aceclofenac FDT in Different Packaging Materials
From Table 3 , it is clear evident that the selected aceclofenac FDT was stable in Al/Al blisters and glass bottles as indicated by the high assay values of the drug. Moreover, no remarkable change in hardness and dissolution rate was observed. Slight increase of the in vitro disintegration time was observed over the period of 6 months at 40 °C/75 % RH which still within the acceptable range.

Conclusions
In this study, the combination of citric acid, mannitol, and β-cyclodextrin in ASTMGA improved the bitter taste masking ability of β-cyclodextrin and increased the solubility of aceclofenac not only through facilitating the entrapment of the drug within β-cyclodextrin structure but also by increasing the water solubility of the inclusion complex. General factorial design was applied in order to rapidly obtain the optimal formulations of FDT containing ASTMGA so to have rapid disintegration, acceptable taste, and enhanced drug dissolution in both simulated salivary fluid and simulated gastric fluid. The selected FDT 9 formulation composed of 756 mg ASTMGA, 110 mg Crospovidone, 157 mg Prosolv®, 11 mg Pruv®, 11 mg Aerosil®, 22 mg mint flavor, and 33 mg aspartame. The stability of the FDT 9 in different package materials was retained after storage at 40 °C/75 % RH for 6 months. Contrary to FDT containing the conventional aceclofenac-β-cyclodextrin inclusion complex, the selected FDT 9 containing ASTMGA showed the highest dissolution rate in both simulated salivary fluid (90 % of the drug in 5 min) and simulated gastric fluid (64.7 % of the drug in 5 min) and the excellent ability to mask the bitterness of aceclofenac. The combination of Prosolv® as diluent and Crospovidone® as disintegrant in the formulation of FDT 9 gave the least in vivo disintegration time (17.54 s) and in vitro disintegration time (18.66 s). The excellent ability to mask the extremely bitter taste of aceclofenac and the enhancement of its dissolution in pH 1.2 and 6.8 from the developed FDT propose that the combination of citric acid, mannitol, and β-cyclodextrin could be promising to improve taste masking and solubilizing properties of β-cyclodextrin.
