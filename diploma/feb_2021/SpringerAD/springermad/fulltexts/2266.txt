Background
Ischemic stroke is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in the world (Writing Group Members et al. ). In the core of ischemic region, clinically defined as > 80% of acute reduction or cessation of cerebral blood flow, severe death of neurons occurs rapidly due to a cascade of biochemical changes, including glutamate excitotoxicity (Lai et al. ), free radical oxidative injury (Allen and Bayraktutan ), mitochondrial dysfunction (Galluzzi et al. ), apoptosis (Sairanen et al. ) and neuronal axonal injury (Ueno et al. ). Despite significant advances in exploring the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke, the only US FDA-approved agent for treatment of ischemic stroke is tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) (Hacke et al. ). However, only 2–3% of patients can actually benefit from the use of t-PA due to the short therapeutic time window (within 3 h of post-stroke) and the risk of hemorrhage (Hacke et al. ). In addition, even blood flow is restored, the complex pathological processes such as excitotoxicity, calcium overload and free radical overproduction triggered by blood reperfusion are still challenging for the survival of neurons (Moskowitz et al. ). Over 1000 therapeutic agents for treating ischemic stroke have failed in clinical trials over the past few decades (Minnerup et al. ). Thus, a drug with diverse biological properties might produce significant advantages over single-target agents in ischemic stroke therapy (Savitz and Fisher ).
Two-[[(1,1-dimethylethyl)oxidoimino]-methyl]-3,5,6-trimethylpyrazine (TBN), a derivative of the clinically used anti-stroke agent tetramethylpyrazine, has significant activity in scavenging free radicals in cell-free chemical reaction system and MPP(+)-induced SH-SY5Y cell lines. In addition, TBN readily penetrates the blood–brain barrier (BBB), a preferred property for treating ischemic stroke (Sun et al. ; Guo et al. ; Zhang et al. , ). TBN administrated by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection showed significant therapeutic effect in reducing the brain infarct size and ameliorating the neurological deficits in a rat model of ischemic stroke (Sun et al. ). In chronic cerebral hypoperfusion rat model, TBN improved the learning and memory abilities of rats by enhancing axonal outgrowth through regulation of the PI3K/Akt/GSK3β signaling pathway (Zhang et al. ). In the present study, we further examined the therapeutic effect of TBN and its possible mechanisms underlying its protective effects in vitro and in vivo.
Materials and Methods
Chemicals
TBN (purity 100.1%), NXY-059 (purity 98.9%) and memantine (purity 99%) were synthesized in our laboratory. Edaravone was purchased from J&K Scientific Ltd. (Beijing, China) and TMP from Henan Furen Huaiqingtang Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. (Henan, China). Neurobasal medium, DMEM medium, Glutemax B27 supplements, Fluo-3/AM, DHE, HFP and DHR123 were purchased from Invitrogen. Polyvinylidene fluoride membranes were from Millipore. Primary antibodies against Bcl-2, Bax, Akt, p-Akt, GSK-3β, β-actin, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology. Other reagents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich unless otherwise noted.
Primary Cortical Neuron Cultures
The primary cortical neurons were prepared from E16-18 Sprague–Dawley (SD) rat embryos as previously described (Vogiatzi et al. ). Cortical neurons were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 1.5 × 10 4 cells/well and cultured at 37 °C in a humidified incubator (5% CO 2 ). After 4–6 h of incubation, unattached cells and debris were removed by replacing the initial medium with fresh neurobasal medium containing 2% B27 supplements and 1% Glutemax. Subsequent partial medium replacement was carried out twice a week until use (11 days). Experimental protocol for animal studies was approved by the Ethics Committee of Laboratory Animal Science at Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.
In Vitro Neuroprotection Assay
Protective Effects Against Glutamate Injury
TBN (30, 100 and 300 μM), TMP (300 μM), NXY-059 (300 μM), edaravone (5 μM) and memantine (5 μM) dissolved in culture medium were added to the cortical neuron cultures for 2 h before exposure to glutamate (200 μM in culture medium). After the cells were incubated for another 24 h, cell viability was determined by the MTT assay (Sun et al. ). The results were expressed as a percentage of cells without glutamate exposure.
Protective Effects Against Oxygen–Glucose–Deprivation (OGD) Injury
Cortical neurons were pre-incubated with TBN (30, 100 and 300 μM), TMP (300 μM), NXY-059 (300 μM), edaravone (5 μM) and memantine (5 μM) or complete medium for 2 h, respectively. The medium was then replaced with DMEM (without glucose in OGD condition). Cells were then incubated in an anaerobic chamber (containing 100% nitrogen and 0% oxygen) for 1 h, followed by incubation in normal condition for another 23 h. Cell viability was evaluated by the MTT method. Cell survival was expressed as the percentage of cells in the normal condition (Domin et al. ). In the inhibitor-blocking experiment, cortical neurons were firstly pretreated with PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (5 μM) or MK2206 (10 μM) for 30 min, respectively.
FDA/PI and Hoechst Staining in Glutamate-Induced Neuronal Damage
Primary cortical neurons were pretreated with TBN (30, 100 and 300 μM), memantine (5 μM) for 2 h and then exposed to 200 μM glutamate (in complete medium) in an incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO 2 and 95% O 2 for 24 h. For the viable/dead cells detection, cells were co-stained with 10 µg/mL FDA and 5 µg/mL PI for 15 min at room temperature. Cortical neurons in all groups were examined and photographed by a fluorescence microscope (Olympus) at 200× magnification.
To observe nuclear changes in neuronal apoptosis, cortical neurons were stained with 10 μg/mL Hoechst 33342 at room temperature in the dark for 10 min. Samples were observed and photographed under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus) at 200× magnification. Cell counts were performed by an investigator who was blinded to drug treatment. At least 200 neurons were counted per sample. Data were expressed as a percentage of the number of nuclei with condensed chromatin to the number of the total nuclei (Zhou et al. ).
Measurement of Intracellular Calcium Concentration
Cortical neurons, seeded on cover slips, were stained with the calcium indicator Fluo-3 acetoxymethyl ester (10 μM) and 0.1% F-127 in Hank’s buffer for 30 min. Cortical neurons were pretreated with TBN (30, 100 and 300 μM) or other positive agents for 5 min, followed by exposure to 1 mM glutamate to induce extracellular calcium influx. Then, neurons were visualized with real-time laser scanning confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 710, Germany). Image data acquisition was started 5 min before application of the drugs and glutamate stimulation. Fluorescence change was expressed as the ratio F max / F 0 . F 0 and F max represent the fluorescence intensities measured at the baseline and the peak response to glutamate, respectively.
Electrophysiological Recording
Whole-cell recording was used to record membrane currents of cortical neurons as previously described (Long et al. ). Briefly, patch clamp electrodes were pulled by a two-step puller (PC-10, WPI Inc, USA) and were filled with pipette solution having a tip resistance of 2–4 MΩ. External solution consisted of (in mmol/L): choline-Cl 130, CaCl 2 2, MgCl 2 2, CsCl 4, HEPES 10 and glucose 10 (pH 7.4). The pipette solution contained (in mmol/L): CsCl 120, MgCl 2 2, CaCl 2 1, Na 2 ATP 5, EGTA 11 and HEPES 10. TTX was added to inhibit I Na (pH 7.4). For the steady state activation protocol, currents were elicited by a 200-ms depolarization pulse applied at 0.2 Hz from a holding potential of − 40 mV, in 10 mV increments between − 40 and + 30 mV.
After the whole-cell configuration was achieved, electrical signals were recorded with a patch amplifier (List-medical L/M-EPC7, Germany), digitized (Digidata 1440A) and displayed. Current and voltage protocol generation, data acquisition and analysis were performed with the P-clamp software (pCLAMP 10). The I – V relationship of I Ca was obtained by plotting the peak current amplitude versus potential.
Measurement of Free Radicals in Cortical Neurons
Primary cortical neurons were pretreated with TBN (30, 100 and 300 μM), TMP (300 μM), NXY-059 (300 μM), edaravone (5 μM) and memantine (5 μM) for 2 h. Cells were then incubated with 5 μM DHE (an O 2 ·− indicator), HFP (an · OH indicator) and DHR123 (an ONOO − indicator), respectively, for 30 min before exposure to glutamate (200 μM) for another 6 h. The fluorescence was evaluated by using a microplate reader (Bio-TeK). The results were calculated as the relative fluorescence of each treatment group compared to that of the untreated group (Zhou et al. ).
Mitochondria Isolation
Brain mitochondria were separated from normal rat cortex as described previously (Tian et al. ). Briefly, SD rats (weight 250–300 g) were euthanized and the brain cortical tissue was rapidly dissociated in ice-cold isolation buffer. The cortex was homogenized using a tight pestle on ice. The homogenate was subjected to centrifuge at 1000 g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then collected and was centrifuged at 5000 g for 10 min at 4 °C to obtain mitochondrial (deposition) fractions. Mitochondrial protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). The experimental protocols were approved by the Ethics Committee of Laboratory Animal Science at Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.
Measurement of Free Radical Scavenging in Mitochondria
The free radical-scavenging effects of TBN in mitochondria were measured using the fluorescent probe DCFH 2 -DA. Mitochondria were pretreated with TBN (30, 100 and 300 μM), TMP (300 μM), NXY-059 (300 μM), edaravone (5 μM) and memantine (5 μM) for 5 min, followed by addition of antimycin (10 μM). Ten μM DCFH 2 -DA and 5 U/mL horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were added. The changes in DCFH 2 -DA fluorescence were monitored every minute for 40 min at 37 °C with a microplate reader (Bio-TeK) using 485-nm excitation and 520-nm emission filters. To detect ONOO − , mitochondria were incubated with TBN and other compounds for 5 min, and then 5 μM DHR 123 was added at 37 °C. Fluorescence was determined using a fluorescence microplate reader (485 nm for excitation and 530 nm for emission) after 5 min of the addition of antimycin A (10 μM). Fluorescence of the buffer without mitochondria (background) was subtracted from the results (Visavadiya et al. ).
Measurement of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (Δψ m)
The lipophilic cationic probe JC-1 was used to measure Δ ψ m according to the instruction with minor modifications (Zhou et al. ). Mitochondria (0.2 mg/mL) were pretreated with TBN (30, 100 and 300 μM), TMP (300 μM), NXY-059 (300 μM), edaravone (5 μM) and memantine (5 μM) for 5 min before antimycin (10 μM) was added. After incubation for 10 min, mitochondria were washed and then stained with 2 μM JC-1 for 30 min. Fluorescence intensity was measured with a microplate reader using 488-nm excitation and 530/590-nm dual emissions. Mitochondrial depolarization was specifically indicated by a decrease in the red/green fluorescence intensity ratio.
CaCl2-Induced Mitochondrial Swelling
Mitochondria swelling was induced by CaCl 2 according to a published method (Ye et al. ). First, the isolated mitochondria were washed and resuspended in an assay buffer. Swelling was induced by adding 200 μM CaCl 2 and was determined by light scattering as monitoring spectrophotometrically at 540 nm for 20 min at 25 °C. TBN (10, 30, 100 and 300 μM) was added in the mitochondrial (0.2 mg/mL) suspension for 5 min before CaCl 2 exposure in the treatment groups. Light transmission was calibrated using an assay buffer.
Measurement of Lipid Peroxidation
Mitochondria (0.2 mg/mL) were pretreated with TBN or other compounds for 5 min and were then incubated in a hydroxyl radical generating system (50 μM FeCl 3 and 100 μM ascorbic acid). The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and was stopped by adding 10% trichloroacetic acid. Subsequently, after addition of 0.67% TBA, mitochondria were placed in boiling water for 20 min and were centrifuged at 3000 g for 10 min. The malondialdehyde (MDA)-TBA complex in the supernatant was measured at 532 nm.
Animals
Sprague–Dawley rats (obtained from Guangdong Medical Laboratory Animal Center) weighting 290 ± 10 g were used for the p-MCAo model. All experimental protocols were performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines (NIH, USA) and Stroke Treatment Academic Industry Roundtable (STAIR) recommendations. Since the animal experiments were conducted in the SPF Animal Care Center of Sun Yat-Sen University, all experiments in the p-MCAo model rats were approved by the Ethics Committee of Animal Care Center of Sun Yat-Sen University.
p-MCAo Rat Model
Before the surgery, all animals were fasted for 8 h. SD rats were anesthetized with 2.0–2.5% (vol./vol.) isoflurane gas. Briefly, the left common carotid artery (CCA), external carotid artery (ECA) and internal carotid artery (ICA) were carefully isolated. A silicone-coated nylon suture (0.34–0.36 mm diameter) was inserted into the ECA and was then advanced retrogradely to the bifurcation of the CCA from where it was advanced a distance of approximately 18–22 mm into the ICA. Relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) above the core of the middle cerebral artery territory (AP +2.0 mm, ML − 4.0 mm) was monitored by a laser Doppler blood flowmeter (PeriMed). Body temperature was maintained at 37 ± 0.5 °C throughout the surgery with a heating blanket and feedback system (RWD Life Science). After the operations, the rats were then returned to their cages and the room temperature kept at 23 ± 1 °C. Saline (sham and model groups), TBN (10, 30 and 90 mg/kg), TMP (85 mg/kg) or NXY-059 (50 mg/kg) was administrated by i.v. through tail vein at 3 and 6 h after p-MCAo in rats. Neurobehavioral assessments and quantitative analysis for cerebral infarction were performed by investigators blinded to the experimental grouping and drug treatment.
Behavioral Tests
Baseline values were generated by averaging 3 trials before surgery. Neurological severity score (NSS) was used to evaluate the neurologic deficit at 3 and 24 h after stroke (Chen et al. ), which is a composite of motor, sensory, reflex tests and beam balance. NSS was graded from 0 to 18 (normal score = 0, maximal deficit score = 18).
2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium Chloride (TTC) Staining
TTC staining at the end of the experiment at 24 h was based on the methods as described previously (Sun et al. ; Lin et al. ). The areas of infarction were quantified by using Image J (National Institutes of Health). The infarct area in TTC staining in each slice was obtained by subtracting the normal ipsilateral area from that of the contralateral hemisphere to reduce overestimation of infarct area resulting from edema in the acute stage of ischemia. Total infarct areas were calculated by summing the infarct areas of the 7 slices and were presented as a percentage of the total areas of the contralateral hemisphere.
Western Blot Analysis
Protein was extracted from the ischemic penumbra and was quantified by the BCA protein assay kit. Generally, 40 mg per lane of protein was loaded in 12% SDS-PAGE for separation and were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. Membranes were incubated for 2 h with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (0.1% Tween 20 in TBS) at room temperature. The blots were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit monoclonal anti-Bcl-2 (1:1000 dilutions), rabbit polyclonal anti-Bax (1:1000 dilutions), rabbit polyclonal anti-Akt (1:1000 dilutions), rabbit monoclonal anti-p-Akt (1:1000 dilutions) and rabbit monoclonal anti-GSK-3β (1:1000 dilutions), followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:2000 dilutions) or goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:2000 dilutions). Immunoreactivity was detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents. Finally, the Carestream MI SE system was used to perform the quantitative analysis.
Data Analysis
All data were expressed as mean ± SEM and were analyzed using the Prism 6.0 (GraphPad Software) and SPSS 13.0 statistic software. One-way ANOVA followed by the Turkey’s post hoc test for multiple comparisons of measurement data was used to assess statistically significant differences ( p < 0.05). The Kruskal–Wallis test followed by Dunn’s multiple comparisons test was used to assay the statistically significant differences for the neurological score ( p < 0.05).
Results
TBN Protected Against Glutamate- and OGD-Induced Neurotoxicity in Cortical Neurons
The effect of TBN against glutamate- and OGD-induced neurotoxicity was first evaluated in cortical neurons by the MTT assay. As shown in Fig. 1 a, b, TBN at the tested concentrations (30, 100 and 300 μM) significantly increased cell viability both in the glutamate- and OGD-treated neurons compared with the vehicle-treated group. The positive controls, TMP (300 μM), NXY-059 (300 μM) and edaravone (5 μM) also showed significant effects on the OGD-induced toxicity, whereas they had no effect on the glutamate-induced toxicity. However, as predicted, the NMDAR antagonist memantine (5 μM) was notably effective in reducing glutamate-induced toxicity. Fig. 1 Effect of TBN against glutamate- and OGD-induced neurotoxicity in cortical neurons. Primary cortical neurons were pretreated with TBN (30, 100 and 300 μM) for 2 h and were then exposed to glutamate (200 μM) for 24 h, or exposed to 1 h OGD. The clinical relevant concentrations of TMP (300 μM), NXY-059 (059, 300 μM), edaravone (5 μM) and memantine (5 μM) were used as positive controls. Cell viability was determined by the MTT test (A and B). a TBN protected against glutamate-induced neuronal death. b TBN protected against OGD-induced neuronal death. c Representative images of cultured neurons under phase contrast, FDA/PI and Hoechst 33342 staining.

The percentage of viable/dead cells and apoptotic nuclei were evaluated by counting 200 cells per culture dish. The values were expressed as percentage of untreated cells (control, Ctrl). The results were mean ± SEM ( n = 3). ### p < 0.001 versus ctrl; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 versus glutamate or OGD alone
Next, we studied the effect of TBN against glutamate-induced neuronal necrosis and apoptosis observed under phase contrast, FDA/PI and Hoechst 33342 staining. Treatment with TBN (30, 100 and 300 μM) significantly increased the numbers of viable neurons (Fig. 1 c, d) and decreased cell apoptosis (Fig. 1 c, e), compared with the glutamate alone treatment group. TBN (100 μM) and memantine (5 μM) offered equal protection (Fig. 1 a, d, e). Importantly, the concentration of TBN in the CSF was reached at 176 μM when given i.v. at an effective therapeutic dose of 30 mg/kg in monkey (Zhang et al. ). The maximum serum level of memantine in human was 0.529 μM with a daily dose of 30 mg (Kornhuber and Quack ).
TBN Inhibited Glutamate-Induced Ca2+ Overload and Calcium Current (I Ca) in Primary Cortical Neurons
Our previous study has demonstrated that TBN significantly reduced Ca 2+ entry into cells induced by KCl (Sun et al. ). Since glutamate-induced Ca 2+ overload is more closely related to neuronal death under ischemic condition, we ask if TBN is also able to inhibit Ca 2+ overload in such a condition. As shown in Fig. 2 a, TBN concentration-dependently (30, 100 and 300 μM) prevented increases of Ca 2+ concentration in cells treated with glutamate. Treatment with memantine (300 μM), the L-type Ca 2+ channel inhibitor nicardipine (100 μM) and TMP (300 μM) also exhibited significant inhibitory effect on Ca 2+ overload. It has been reported that L-type voltage-gated Ca 2+ channels are involved in glutamate-induced Ca 2+ influx (Oyama et al. ). Fig. 2 Effect of TBN on glutamate-induced Ca 2+ overload and I Ca 2+ in primary cortical neurons. a Ca 2+ influx inhibition. b I Ca was elicited by a 200-ms depolarizing pulse from a holding potential of − 40 to + 30 mV according to the steady state activation protocol. c , d Current voltage ( I – V ) curve of I Ca 2+ was obtained with or without of TMP ( c ) and TBN ( d ). The results were mean ± SEM ( n = 3). * p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001 versus glutamate alone group
Whole-cell patch clamp technique was used to further examine the effect of TBN on the current of the voltage-gated Ca 2+ channels in primary cortical neurons. As shown in Fig. 2 b–d, both TMP (300 μM) and TBN (300 μM) significantly reduced the I Ca changes compared with the control group.
TBN Scavenged Glutamate-Induced Overproduction of Intracellular Free Radicals in Cortical Neurons
It is widely accepted that free radicals, including reactive oxygen species such as superoxide anion (O 2 ·− ), hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) and hydroxyl radical ( · OH) and reactive nitrogen species such as peroxynitrite (ONOO − ) and nitric oxide (NO), are important mediators of ischemic brain injury. We have previously found that TBN was highly effective in scavenging free radicals including O 2 ·− , · OH and ONOO − in a cell-free assay (Sun et al. ). In this study, TBN (30, 100 and 300 μM) treatment significantly quenched the overproduction of intracellular free radicals, including O 2 ·− (Fig. 3 a), · OH (Fig. 3 b) and ONOO − (Fig. 3 c), compared with the control group. TBN at the concentration of 100 μM exhibited higher activity (31.8% O 2 ·− ; 31.4% · OH; 29.5% ONOO − ) in scavenging the overproduction of free radicals than TMP (300 μM, 19.6% O 2 ·− ; 20.7% · OH; 18.9% ONOO − ), NXY-059 (300 μM, 26.7% O 2 ·− ; 23.8% · OH; 19.2% ONOO − ) and edaravone (5 μM, 16.8% O 2 ·− ; 26.1% · OH; 17.5% ONOO − ) at the tested concentrations, respectively. Fig. 3 Effect of TBN on glutamate-induced overproduction of intracellular free radicals in primary cortical neurons. Cortical neurons were pretreated with TBN (10, 30, 100 and 300 μM), TMP (300 μM), 059 (300 μM) or edaravone (5 μM) for 2 h before adding 5 μM of DHE (a O 2 ·− indicator), HFP (a · OH indicator) and DHR123 (a ONOO − indicator), respectively. Then, cells were exposed to glutamate (200 μM) for another 6 h. a Effect on scavenging O 2 ·− . b Effect on scavenging · OH. c Effect on scavenging ONOO − . Results are the mean ± SEM ( n = 3). # p < 0.05 versus ctrl group. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 versus glutamate alone group
Effect of TBN on Free Radical Production, Lipid Oxidation, Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (Δψ m) Decrease and Mitochondrial Swelling in Isolated Cortical Mitochondria
Free radicals are mainly generated from the respiratory chain of mitochondria during ischemia. The effect of TBN on isolated mitochondria was further investigated. TBN concentration-dependently inhibited glutamate-induced ROS/RNS (Fig. 4 a) and ONOO − levels (Fig. 4 b) and decreased the levels of MDA in the FeCl 3 -ascorbate system (Fig. 4 c). In addition, TBN remarkably prevented the decrease in antimycin A-induced membrane potential (Δ ψ ) (Fig. 4 d) and inhibited the CaCl 2 -induced mitochondrial swelling (Fig. 4 e) in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, TBN at 300 μM showed equal effect in inhibiting the mitochondrial swelling as CsA (1 μM), an inhibitor of mitochondrial permeability transition pores. In contrast, TMP (300 μM) and NXY-059 (300 μM) had no effect (Fig. 4 e). Fig. 4 Effect of TBN on free radical production, lipid oxidation, membrane potential level and mitochondrial swelling in isolated cortex mitochondria. a Scavenging total ROS/RNS in glutamate-induced mitochondrial model. b Scavenging ONOO − in glutamate-induced mitochondrial model. c Inhibiting lipid oxidation in FeCl 3 -ascorbate reaction system. d Effect on antimycin-induced decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential. e Inhibitory effect on CaCl 2 -induced mitochondrial swelling.

TBN Reduced Cerebral Infarction and Improved Neurological Functions in Rats After Ischemic Stroke
We evaluated the dose response of TBN administrated by i.v. in reducing brain infarction in the p-MCAo model. TBN at 30 and 90 mg/kg significantly reduced the brain infarction (Fig. 5 a, b). In accordance, TBN treatment significantly ameliorated the neurological severity score 24 h after ischemic stroke (Fig. 5 c). Fig. 5 Effect of TBN on brain infarction and neurological severity score in p-MCAo rats. Rats were subjected to p-MCAo and were treated with TBN (i.v.) or saline (sham and model) at 3 and 6 h after stroke. Neurological severity score was assessed at 3 and 24 h post-ischemia, and brain infarct size was examined 24 h post-ischemia. a Dose response of TBN in reducing brain infarct size. b TBN at 10–90 mg/kg significantly attenuated neurological severity score. c Comparison of TBN, NXY-059 and TMP in reducing brain infarct size. d Comparison of TBN, NXY-059 and TMP in attenuating neurological severity score. All data were expressed as mean ± SEM. The sample size was indicated in the legend of bar chart. * p < 0.05, * p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001 versus model group
Next, we further compared the efficacy of TBN, NXY-059 and TMP. TBN (30 mg/kg), NXY-059 (50 mg/kg, equal molar dose to 30 mg/kg TBN) and TMP (85 mg/kg, equal molar dose to 90 mg/kg TBN) reduced brain infarction by 18.2, 20.8 and 16.3%, respectively (Fig. 5 d, e). However, 24 h after ischemic stroke, TBN, but not NXY-059 and TMP, significantly ameliorated the neurological severity score (Fig. 5 f).
TBN Reversed the Altered Expressions of Bcl-2 and Bax in the Penumbra of p-MCAo Rats
Oxidative damage to the mitochondria of neurons can increase Bax expression, but decrease Bcl-2 expression, prompting neuronal mitochondrial apoptosis following ischemic stroke (Galluzzi et al. ). In this study, TBN treatment significantly reduced the expression level of Bax and increased the level of Bcl-2 (Fig. 6 a–c). Moreover, TBN treatment significantly reversed the altered Bcl-2/Bax ratio compared with the vehicle-treated model group (Fig. 6 d). These results suggested that TBN prevents neuronal apoptosis through the regulation of Bcl-2/Bax pathway. Fig. 6 Effect of TBN on the protein expression of Bax and Bcl-2 in the penumbra of p-MCAo rats. Rats were subjected to p-MCAo and were treated with TBN (90 mg/kg) or saline (sham and model) at 3 and 6 h after stroke. Proteins were extracted from the rat cerebral penumbra at 24 h after p-MCAo. a Representative blots of Bax and Bcl-2. b – d Quantitative analysis of protein expression of Bax, Bcl-2 and Bcl-2/Bax ratio. β-Actin was used as an internal control.

TBN Activated PI3K/Akt/p-GSK-3β Pathway in the Penumbra of p-MCAo Rats
The PI3K/Akt/p-GSK3β signal pathway takes part in regulating a series of cellular processes, such as apoptosis, neurogenesis, axonal outgrowth and controlling microtubular cytoskeleton dynamics (Hur and Zhou ; Seira and Del Rio ). We investigated the effect of TBN on the PI3K/Akt/p-GSK3β pathway in the penumbra cortex of the p-MCAo rats. As shown in Fig. 7 a–c, TBN treatment significantly increased the levels of p-Akt and p-GSK-3β compared to the vehicle-treated model group. Fig. 7 TBN activated PI3K/Akt/p-GSK-3β in the penumbra of p-MCAo rats. Saline (sham and model group) or TBN (90 mg/kg) were administrated at 3 and 6 h after p-MCAo in rats. Proteins were extracted from the cortical penumbra of rats at 24 h after p-MCAo. a Representative blots of protein expression of p-Akt, Akt, p-GSK-3β, GSK-3β. b , c Quantitative analysis of protein expression of p-Akt/Akt, p-GSK-3β/GSK-3β. β-Actin was used as an internal control. The results were presented as mean ± SEM ( n = 6 rats/group). # p < 0.05 versus sham group. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 versus model group. d . LY-294002 (a PI3K inhibitor) and MK2206 (an Akt inhibitor) significantly blocked the protective effect of TBN against OGD-induced cortical neurons death.

To further verify that the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway participates in the neuroprotective effect of TBN against ischemia, LY294022 (5 μM, a PI3K inhibitor) and MK-2206 (10 μM, an Akt inhibitor) were applied on primary cortical neurons subjected to OGD. Both LY294022 and MK-2206 pre-treatment significantly blocked the protective effect of TBN against OGD-induced neuronal damage. These results indicated that the protective effect of TBN against OGD is possibly mediated by activation of the PI3K and Akt pathway.
Discussion
Ischemic stroke can induce glutamate accumulation (Chamorro et al. ) and further intricate Ca 2+ overload and free radical overproduction, which are crucial factors in ischemic neuronal cell death (Lai et al. ; Allen and Bayraktutan ; Galluzzi et al. ; Sairanen et al. ). Agents aimed blocking these processes, especially the Ca 2+ influx blockers and free radical scavengers, can be used as potential therapeutics for ischemic stroke (Allen and Bayraktutan ; Chamorro et al. ; Margaill et al. ). In the present study, we showed that TBN can inhibit I Ca 2+ in cortical neurons. The results implied that TBN maintained the Ca 2+ -blocking effect of TMP, which is widely used in China for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases (Zhao et al. ). In addition, we have demonstrated that TBN blocked extracellular Ca 2+ influx and scavenged excessive free radicals preventing primary neurons from glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. These results are consistent with what we have previously found in the KCl-induced SH-SY5Y cells and in cell-free chemical reaction solutions (Sun et al. ).
Several major free radicals including O 2 ·− , · OH and ONOO − , which are produced during redox process and considered as messengers in intracellular signaling cascades (Rhee ; Stone and Yang ), can cause lipid peroxidation and DNA damage leading to apoptosis (Aruoma et al. ; Park et al. ). Therefore, an agent that can effectively neutralize all of these three free radicals will be beneficial in stroke therapy. We previously reported that TBN directly scavenged O 2 ·− , · OH and ONOO − in chemical reaction solutions (Sun et al. , ). In the current studies, we demonstrated that TBN significantly decreased the levels of these free radicals in primary cortical neurons and in isolated cortical mitochondria, increased the mitochondrial membrane potential and decreased mitochondrial swelling. Thus, TBN’s unique abilities to lower the levels of free radicals will undoubtedly contribute to its neuroprotective effect against ischemic stroke.
Our previous data showed that TBN, administrated by i.p. injection 2 h after the onset of reperfusion, exhibited remarkable therapeutic effects in the t- and p-MCAo rat models of stroke (Sun et al. ). However, the effect of TBN given by i.v. administration, a clinically relevant approach in the treatment of ischemic stroke (Fisher et al. ), still needs to be investigated. The present data revealed that TBN given by i.v. administration initially at 3 h post-ischemia dose-dependently reduced brain infarction and neurological deficit in the p-MCAo model. In addition, we found that equal molar dose of TBN (30 mg/kg) and NXY-059 (50 mg/kg) produced the similar therapeutic efficacy and was more effective than those of TMP was gave at a dose of threefold higher (85 mg/kg). NXY-059 is one of the most extensively studied free radical scavengers which showed positive results when evaluated in various animal stroke models, but failed in its second phase III clinical trial (Lees et al. ; Shuaib et al. ). The cause of this failure is multifactorial, including poorly designed preclinical and clinical studies (Feuerstein et al. ) and poor ability penetrating the blood–brain barrier (BBB) (Ginsberg ; Kuroda et al. ). To effectively deliver the free radical-scavenging nitrone moiety into brain tissues, TBN was designed using TMP as a carrier. TMP’s superior ability penetrating the brain was implied as early as 500 years ago in the Compendium of Materia Medica (Bencao Gangmu). In our recently published pharmacokinetic analysis in monkeys, we demonstrated that TBN readily penetrated the BBB and reached therapeutic concentrations in targeted cerebral tissues (Zhang et al. ). This feature of TBN is pivotally important accounting for its high therapeutic efficacy.
As most stroke patients without suffering from reperfusion, the STAIR recommendations endorse the testing of agents in permanent models of stroke (Fisher et al. ). In agreement with our previous report where TBN was given by i.p. (Sun et al. ), TBN given by i.v. also significantly reduced brain infarction and improved neurological behavioral functions in the p-MCAo model. Most importantly, the present data indicate that TBN has higher therapeutic effects than that of TMP and NXY-059 in the p-MCAo model. One of the key elements for a stroke agent is its therapeutic time window. We have demonstrated the therapeutic time window of TBN is at least 6 h in the monkey t-MCAo model (Zhang et al. ). In the rat t-MCAo model, its time window is even up to 8 h (Sun et al. ), which is 2 times longer than that of NXY-059 (Aruoma et al. ). Taken together, these data indicate that TBN is superior to TMP and NXY-059 for the treatment of ischemic stroke.
Others have reported that excessive free radicals stimulate the production of 8-OHdG and 4-HNE, which are produced by lipid peroxidation of cell membranes and DNA damage in neuronal cells (McCracken et al. ; Raz et al. ; Zhao et al. ; Beckman ). Recently, we demonstrated that TBN decreased the number of 8-OHdG and 4-HNE positive cells in rats of traumatic brain injury (Zhang et al. ). Membrane lipid peroxidation and DNA damage consequently induce apoptotic neuronal death (Oyama et al. ; Hur and Zhou ). In the current study, we demonstrated that TBN treatment reversed the altered expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and pro-apoptotic Bax in the cortical penumbra of stroke rats. Moreover, previous studies provide strong evidence that altering the expression of Bcl-2 family proteins, including down-regulation of Bcl-2 and up-regulation of Bax, can affect the intrinsic apoptosis pathway (Loncarevic-Vasiljkovic et al. ). These results provide further support that TBN exerts neuroprotective effect in ischemic stroke by inhibiting free radicals-mediated neuronal apoptosis.
The PI3K/Akt/p-GSK-3β signal pathway takes part in regulating neuronal survival (Hur and Zhou ). PI3K activates its downstream kinase Akt and then phosphorylates GSK-3β, which regulates a series of cellular processes, such as apoptosis, neurogenesis, axonal outgrowth and controlling microtubular cytoskeleton dynamics (Seira and Del Rio ). TMP, the parent of TBN, has been reported to protect cell damage through activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway (Zhao et al. ). In our previous research, we showed that TBN enhanced axonal outgrowth through regulation of the PI3K/Akt/GSK3β signaling pathway, leading to improvement in the learning and memory abilities in chronic cerebral hypoperfusion rats (Zhang et al. ). As predicted, in the present study, TBN was found to significantly increase the expressions of p-Akt and p-GSK3β in the cortical penumbra of acute ischemic rat brain. The involvement of PI3K and Akt to neuroprotection was further confirmed by experiment using the specific PI3K and Akt inhibitors.
In summary, TBN protected against glutamate- and OGD-induced cortical neuronal damage in vitro, and reduced cerebral infarction and improved neurobehavioral deficits in p-MCAO rats. Multifunctional mechanisms as depicted in Fig. 8 , including scavenging free radicals, blocking calcium overload, maintaining mitochondrial function and activating the PI3K/Akt/p-GSK3β cell survival pathway, were possibly involved in the neuroprotective effects of TBN, making it a promising clinical candidate for the treatment of ischemic stroke.
