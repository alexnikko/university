Introduction
The stability of biochemical parameter in serum and plasma is the capability of these samples to retain its original property of the analyzed parameter for a period of time within specified limits when the sample is stored under defined conditions (Singh et al. ). The samples are expected to still give correct results that are the same with the normal concentration or activity range value for a given animal species (Singh et al. ). Analyses of serum, plasma, whole blood, and other body fluids are routinely carried out to identify applications of diagnostic and therapeutic importance (Subramanian ). Clinical chemistry tests measures the stability of wide variety of laboratory parameters that reflect many different organ systems and diseases of importance in veterinary practice. The measurement of these biochemistry parameters in body fluids have aided in ascertaining the period of time and condition to which important veterinary diagnostic parameters are suitable for accurate diagnosis of veterinary diseases (Sidney ). Veterinary clinical pathology tests are performed for different reasons. Some tests help diagnose a disease, others monitor the course of the disease progression or effectiveness of therapy, and still others are used to screen for risk of developing a disease (Luthra ).
However, the integrity of the findings obtained after clinical chemistry test evaluations not only depends on the analytical instrument and equipment utilized, but also on the pre-analytical steps of collection, handling and storage of samples (Subramanian ; Heins et al. ; Zhang et al. ). Blood samples obtained from animals for laboratory analyses often needs preservation owing to various technical constraints leading to delay in analysis from sampling time, thus subjecting samples to different period of storage (Cray et al. ). Delay in analysis of samples in ambulatory equine practice arises due to collection of blood samples from these animals at remote farms or farm settlements where power supply, refrigerators, and standard laboratory facilities may either be unavailable or nonfunctional, and blood samples will need to be transported unrefrigerated for hours before reaching the laboratory (Ihedioha and Onwubuche ).
At times, collection of samples from large numbers of animals may contribute to delay in transportation of the samples to the laboratory, in which upon arrival at the laboratory analysis may be further delayed, especially in absence of automated analyzer, thus resulting to use of manual procedures for analysis of the large number of samples (Ihedioha and Onwubuche ; Rendle et al. ). Although frozen serum or plasma is frequently used in retrospective studies, interpretation and clinical analysis depends upon numerous critical factors of which stability of parameters happens to be the most important (Thoresen et al. ). There are several studies of clinical importance using human samples which reported stability of certain biochemical parameters in serum or plasma samples for a specified period of time (Heins et al. ; Zhang et al. ; Gulati et al. ; Clark et al. ; Yue et al. ). Reports of stability involving plasma or serum obtained from various animal species include pigs (Fonda et al. ), dogs (Thoresen et al. ; Medaille et al. ), camels (Marjani ), birds (Hawkins et al. ), goats (Divya and Jayavardhanan ), dairy cows (Ehsani et al. ), and laboratory rats (Cray et al. ; Peng et al. 2010). Few studies have reported the effects of temperature and duration on clinical biochemistry parameters and hematological variables of horses (Clarke et al. ; Rendle et al. ; Sharif et al. ). Therefore, studies on the stability of parameters for clinical biochemistry evaluation of horse blood samples stored at different duration and temperatures is scanty, except for that ascertained for room temperature (Rendle et al. ). It is important to determine the stability of various biochemical parameters in stored horse plasma and serum sample for extended duration stored at different temperatures.
Therefore, the present study was designed to determine the effect of storage time at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h and storage temperature (room and refrigerator) on the stability of and/or changes in the total plasma/serum values of sodium, calcium, potassium, uric acid, malondialdehyde, and glucose in stored plasma and serum samples obtained from apparently healthy horses.
Materials and methods
Animals for the study
Blood samples were collected from 17 adult horses (10 males and 7 females). These 17 horses are the only apparently healthy horses out of 21 horses presented for sale on the day of visit. These horses are meant for sale at Obollo-Afor horse lairage, Udenu Local Government Area, Enugu State, Nigeria. Obollo Afor, Udenu Local Government Aream Enugu State is located between latitude 6° 54′ 56″ north and longitude 7° 30′ 55″ east. They were subjected to comprehensive physical examination involving examination of the head, body condition, hair coat, mucous membranes, composure, posture, gait, and perineum (Radostits et al. ; Ugochukwu ). The horses were also aged based on tooth eruption and wear (Ensminger 1969). The aging was based on the presence or absence of deciduous incisor teeth, dental cups, dental star, 7th and 11th year hook, and the appearance of the Galvayne’s groove. The horses sampled were between the ages of 5 and 12 years.
Blood sample collection
Six milliliters of blood was collected from the jugular vein of each of the apparently healthy horses in the morning hours of 6.30 am into blood sample bottles containing appropriate EDTA (1 mg/ml of blood) and sample bottles without EDTA. Two milliliters of the blood were dispensed into a sample bottles containing ethylenediaminetetracetic acid (1 mg) while the remaining 4 ml were dispensed into a clean plain test tubes to clot. Blood samples were preserved in coolers containing ice packs (temperature of 2–8 °C) during transportation to the clinical laboratory.
Upon arrival to the clinical laboratory, the blood samples containing EDTA were immediately centrifuged within 30 min of blood collection at 3000 g for 10 min using a clinical table centrifuge (Ajmer, India), to obtain plasma and the non-EDTA blood samples were allowed to clot and centrifuged within 1 h of blood collection to obtain sera. The test parameters: sodium, calcium, potassium, and uric acid were analyzed immediately using the serum obtained while malondialdehyde and glucose were analyzed immediately using plasma obtained, and the results of this determination served as the baseline values (hour 0). Thereafter, the 17 serum and plasma samples were shared into two equal parts. One part was stored under room temperature [22–28 °C; average of 25 °C), while the second part was stored under refrigerator temperature (average of 4 °C). Further analysis on the serum and plasma samples were carried out on 24 hourly interval for up to 72 h (3 days) of storage and compared with the baseline value (hour 0).
Serum biochemistry
All serum biochemistry tests were done using Randox UK, Quimica Clinica Aplicada (QCA) Spain and Spinreact Spain test kits and read with an autocolorimeter (Labtech, India). Serum sodium was determined by magnesium-uranylacetate method (Young ) using Spinreact test kit while serum calcium was determined by the O-cresolphthalein method (Biggs and Moorehead ) using QCA test kit. Serum potassium was determined by sodium tetraphenylboron method (Young ) using Spinreact test kit while serum uric acid was determined by uricase-POD method (Trinder ) using Randox test kit. Plasma malondialdehyde was determined by modified thiobarbituric acid method (Todorova et al. ) while plasma glucose was determined by the glucose oxidase method (Sacks ), using glucometer (Accu-check Active) (Roche Diagnostics, Gmbh, Mannheim Germany) and glucose test strips (Accu-chek).
Statistical analysis
Data obtained at the 0, 24, 48, and 72 h of sample storage were analyzed using one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the means were separated using least significance difference (LSD) method and Duncan range test. The results were expressed as means ± standard error.

Significant ( P < 0.05) decreases were recorded from hour 48 (Table 1 ). At refrigerator temperature, there was no significant ( P > 0.05) difference in the mean plasma glucose concentration 24, 48, and 72 h post sample collection (Table 2 ).

Discussion
Plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) was only stable for 48 h at both 4 and 25 °C post sample collection and increased significantly after 48 h at both 4 and 25 °C post sample collection. The significant increase in plasma MDA at the 72nd hour stored at refrigerator temperature could be attributed to the cold temperature which favors the water–solute hydrogen binding that resulted in the increase in MDA level as reported in humans (Deepanwita ). Serum uric acid concentration was only stable less than 24 h post collection of sample at both and 25 °C. A linear increase was recorded from 24 up to 72 h post sample collection at both 4 and 25 °C. This result is in disagreement with Marjani ( ) that recorded stability in serum uric acid at both 4 and 25 °C up to 72 h post sample collection in humans and Cuhadar et al. ( ) that reported stability of serum uric acid up to 30 h under refrigerator temperature of 4 °C in humans. Increased changes in serum uric acid concentration are clinically significant with higher storage temperature at 25 °C when compared with results at 4 °C (Dirar et al. ).
Serum sodium concentration was only stable at 4 °C for up to 72 h post sample collection. This stability at 4 °C is in agreement with Thoresen et al. ( ) in dogs where he recorded stability of serum sodium for 24 h at 4 °C and with Cray et al. ( ) in rats where sodium remained stable at 4 °C for 7 days. However, serum sodium concentration has been reported to be stable for 2 weeks at 15–25 and 2–8 °C in human serum (Eclinpath ) which contradicts our result. Serum potassium concentration was stable less than 24 h post sample collection at both 4 and 25 °C. This obtained result is in concurrence with the work of Heins et al. ( ) where potassium was reported unstable after 24 h at both 9 and 25 °C in whole blood sample in human. However, serum potassium has been reported to be stable for 2 weeks at 25 and 4 °C in human serum (Eclinpath ). Thoresen et al. ( ) reported stability of potassium for 72 h at 4 °C in dog serum which is contrary to the result obtained in this present study. Plasma glucose concentration was stable at 4 °C all through 72 h. This stability could be due to the fact that plasma deterioration and glycolysis occurring in white blood cells that might have filtered into plasma during decantation were inhibited or slowed by the cold temperature (Aba et al. ). Thoresen et al. ( ) also reported stability of serum and plasma glucose at 4 °C for 72 h in dogs. Instability of plasma glucose was observed at 25 °C all through 72 h post sample collection. This decrease could be attributed to deterioration of plasma and local metabolism of glucose by the white blood cells that may have filtered into the plasma in the course of decantation (Aba et al. ). The instability of plasma glucose at 25 °C is in agreement with the work of Rendle et al. ( ), where plasma glucose was unstable at 25 °C all through 72 h post sample collection in the horse.
Serum calcium concentration was stable less than 24 h post sample collection at both 4 and 25 °C. Thoresen et al. ( ) reported a contradictory result where calcium was stable at 4 °C for 24 h, in dog serum. Also, Saeed et al. ( ) who worked on camel serum reported that calcium did not change over 9 days when stored at 4–5 °C and was also stable at 23–25 °C over 72 h post sample collection. In humans, serum calcium is reported to be stable for 7 days post sample collection at 25 °C and 3 weeks post sample collection at 4 °C.
Conclusion
From the results of this study, it was concluded that plasma MDA was stable for 48 h at both 4 and 25 °C. Serum uric acid, potassium, and calcium were stable, less than 24 h post sample collection, at both 4 and 25 °C. Serum sodium and plasma glucose were only stable at 4 °C for up to 72 h. It is therefore recommended that samples should be analyzed in the laboratory within 24 h of collection to ensure valid results. Also, further studies should be done to determine the percentage change (increase or decrease) in the concentration of these biochemical parameters with time.
