Background
Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a distinct clinical disease that can progress to heart failure independent of coronary artery disease and atherosclerosis. Ventricular diastolic dysfunction occurs in the early stages of diabetic cardiomyopathy. According to previous research, intracellular calcium (Ca 2+ ) homeostasis is crucial for excitation-contraction coupling, and diabetes is associated with impaired cardiac contractility and myocardial relaxation due to altered Ca 2+ homeostasis [ ].
Sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ ATPase (SERCA2a), a main regulator of intracellular Ca 2+ levels, regulates the majority of Ca 2+ during cardiomyocyte relaxation. Based on the results from recent experimental studies, SERCA2a expression decreased in diabetic rats with cardiac dysfunction [ ], and the SERCA2a protein levels have been shown to decrease during diabetic cardiomyopathy, impairing Ca 2+ reuptake in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) [ , ]. However, the mechanisms through which Ca 2+ cycling in the SR is impaired during diabetic cardiomyopathy have not been fully elucidated. Furthermore, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress plays a crucial role in SERCA2a expression in subjects with diabetes; ER stress reduced the expression of SERCA2a protein by increasing SERCA2a ubiquitination and degradation, leading to cardiac dysfunction in diabetic rats [ ].
Several experimental studies revealed that the haematopoietic cytokine erythropoietin (EPO) has numerous tissue protective effects in addition to its actions in erythropoiesis. As shown in our previous study, EPO attenuates cardiac dysfunction in diabetic rats, but the mechanisms through which EPO improves cardiac function in diabetic cardiomyopathy have not been elucidated. Based on accumulating data from many experimental studies, EPO improves heart function by inhibiting ER stress [ ]. Furthermore, low-dose EPO treatment administered via the middle cerebral artery provides neuroprotection following acute ischaemic stroke by inhibiting the ER stress response [ ]. As shown in the study conducted by Kong et al. [ ], EPO inhibits cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) through a possible mechanism involving the activation of phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and the inhibition of ER stress-mediated apoptosis. Based on the findings of our previous study showing that EPO attenuates cardiac dysfunction in diabetic rats, we hypothesised that EPO treatment might improve cardiac function following high glucose (HG)-induced injury by suppressing ER stress.
Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to verify whether EPO attenuates cardiac dysfunction by suppressing ER stress, normalizing SERCA2a expression and altering Ca 2+ homeostasis in diabetic rats.
Materials and Methods
Animal Treatment
Experiments were performed in compliance with the ARRIVE guidelines for animal research [ ]. Forty male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats weighing 220–250 g were randomly allocated into four groups ( n = 10): (1) control group, (2) EPO-treated control group, (3) vehicle-treated diabetic group, and (4) EPO-treated diabetic group. Diabetes mellitus (DM) was induced in the rats via an intraperitoneal injection of 50 mg/kg streptozotocin (STZ; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) after an overnight fast. The diabetic state was confirmed 72 h later by measuring blood glucose concentrations ≥16.7 mmol/L. We conducted preliminary dose-response experiments to select an appropriate dose of EPO. In these experiments, rats were subcutaneously injected with three different doses of EPO (500, 1000 or 2000 U/kg) once per week for 12 weeks. According to the serial echocardiography results measuring the left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic diameter and ejection fraction (EF %), 1000 and 2000 U/kg EPO were appropriate doses that induced cardioprotection. Considering the increased erythrocyte levels achieved by administering 2000 U/kg EPO compared with 1000 U/kg EPO, we selected 1000 U/kg EPO for the final study. In the EPO-treated control and diabetic groups, recombinant human EPO (rhEPO; 3SBIO Company, China) was administered via subcutaneous injection (1000 U/kg, once per week) for 12 weeks. Similarly, the control and vehicle-treated diabetic groups received equal volumes of physiological saline via subcutaneous injections. These rats were housed for 12 weeks, observed daily and provided free access to food and water. After 12 weeks of treatment and echocardiography measurements, the animals were weighed and then sacrificed using a lethal dose of sodium pentobarbital (60 mg/kg intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection), and blood samples were collected for the erythrocyte assay and glucose measurements. The heart was then removed and weighed, and the LV was dissected. Some parts of the LV were snap-frozen and stored at −80 °C for subsequent RT-PCR and Western blot assays. The remaining tissue was fixed with 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin for histological or immunohistochemical assessments.
Echocardiography
After 12 weeks, rats that had been anaesthetized with pentobarbital (40 mg/kg i.p.) underwent transthoracic echocardiography using a commercial system (VisualSonics Vevo 770, Visual Sonics, CA, USA) equipped with a 12-MHz linear-array transducer. Measurements were made offline by an observer who was blinded to the group of each animal. Both two-dimensional (2D) images from the parasternal long-axis and short-axis views and 2D-guided M-mode tracings were obtained. Short-axis views were recorded at the mid-papillary muscle level. All measurements were obtained according to the recommendations of the American Society of Echocardiography [ ]. The LV end-diastolic dimension (LVDd) and LV end-systolic dimension (LVDs) were measured through M-mode echocardiography. Three representative cardiac cycles were analysed and averaged for each measurement. The LV EF % was calculated using the Teichholz method [ ].
Red Blood Cell Assay
Peripheral blood was isolated from venous blood, and the number of red blood cells was counted using standard laboratory methods (BC-5800 Haematology Analyser, Mindray Bio-Med, Ltd., China) at baseline and the end-point.
Real Time RT-PCR
Tissue samples obtained from the free LV wall were minced, and total RNA was extracted from the samples using the TRIzol reagent, according to the manufacturer’s guidelines (Invitrogen, USA). For RT-PCR, complementary DNA (cDNA) samples were synthesized in a 20-μL reaction volume containing 3 μg of total RNA (RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit, Fermentas), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The expression of the GRP78 and EPOR genes was analysed by RT-PCR using a Bio-Rad MJ MiniOpticon Real-Time PCR System. To control for variations in the amount of DNA, the expression of the target gene was normalized to an endogenous control, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Primers for GRP78, SERCA2a, EPOR and GAPDH were constructed with the help of GenScript Biotech Co. (Nanjing, China). The primer sequences used for real-time PCR were GRP78, 5′-GTGCAGCAGGACATCAAGTT-3′ and 5′-ACAGTCACAACTGCATGGGT-3′, 194 bp; SERCA2a, 5′-CAGCTCACTGTGTGATGTGG-3′ and 5′-AGACTTGGCTGATGGCTTCT-3′, 188 bp; EPOR, 5′-CAGCTCGAAGGTGAATCAAG-3′ and 5′-GCGTCCAGGAGCACTACTTCATTG-3′, 196 bp; and GAPDH, 5′-TGTTGCCATCAACGACCCCTT-3′ and 5′-CTCCACGACATACTCAGCA-3′, 202 bp. The levels of the GRP78, SERCA2a, EPOR and GAPDH messenger RNAs (mRNAs) were quantified based on standard curves (Bio-Rad CFX Manager). The results are expressed relative to the control values, which were arbitrarily assigned a value of 1. The means and standard errors of the means (SEM) were calculated using data from three independent experiments.
For cell culture experiments, the TRIzol reagent was used to isolate the total RNA from cells according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen, USA). First-strand cDNAs were obtained by reverse transcription using a cDNA synthesis kit (Fermentas, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The cDNA samples were stored at −20 °C until use. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was performed using the primers and methods described above. The relative gene expression levels were calculated after normalization to GAPDH expression.
Western Blotting
Proteins were extracted from the cardiac tissues obtained from five animals of each experimental group using a previously described protocol [ ]. Then, 40 μg of proteins was electrophoresed through a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore, USA). The membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk powder dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before an overnight incubation with polyclonal rabbit anti-rat GRP78 antibodies (1:400), polyclonal rabbit anti-rat SERCA2a antibodies (1:400), polyclonal rabbit anti-rat β-actin antibodies (1:400) and polyclonal rabbit anti-rat EPOR antibodies (1:400) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA). The membranes were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:5000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA) prior to addition of an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Western Blotting Chemiluminescence Luminol Reagent; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA) and exposure to Canon EOS 60D film (USA). The proteins were quantified using the ImageTool 3.0 analysis system. A densitometric analysis of the GRP78, SERCA2a and EPOR bands, which were normalized to the endogenous control β-actin, was performed to express the results. The means and SEM were calculated using data from three independent experiments.
For the cell culture experiments, Western blotting was performed as described below. Equal amounts of cell lysate (20 μg protein) were denatured in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and electrophoresed on 10% polyacrylamide gels for 3 h at 20 mA. The separated proteins were then transferred to PVDF membranes and blocked using Tris-buffered saline containing Tween-20 (TBST; 10 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl and 0.05% Tween-20) and 5% non-fat dry milk for 4 h at room temperature. Subsequently, protein expression was quantified through scanning densitometry using a previously described method.
Immunohistochemistry
Serial, paraffin-embedded, 4-μm-thick LV sections were stained with polyclonal rabbit anti-rat EPOR antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA, 1:100). The staining was visualized using the 3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB; Sigma Chemical Co., USA, 1:20) reaction. The specimens were then lightly counterstained with Mayer’s haematoxylin, dehydrated and mounted under glass coverslips using xylene-based mounting medium. Brown-coloured sites were quantified at a final magnification of ×400 using a microscope connected to a video camera. The positively stained areas from ten fields selected across the wall thickness in the septum and the free wall were averaged. Negative controls were treated as described above, but a solution of PBS replaced the primary antibody. All images were viewed under a light microscope (Scope.A1; Zeiss, Germany) by an independent pathologist. Computer-assisted morphometry was performed using Image-Pro Plus 6.0.
TUNEL Staining
DNA fragmentation in 4-μm-thick paraffin-embedded sections was assessed using a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labelling (TUNEL) assay. The procedure was performed using an in situ cell death detection kit (Fluorescein, Roche, Mannheim, Germany), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. TUNEL-positive cardiomyocytes in the ischaemic myocardium were carefully distinguished from TUNEL-positive non-cardiomyocytes by observing the morphology of each cell through phase-contrast microscopy. An experienced investigator who was blinded to the treatment groups evaluated all of the sections, and the data are expressed as the ratio of TUNEL-positive cardiomyocytes to the total number of cardiomyocytes.
Isolation of Neonatal Rat Cardiomyocytes
Our experiments using neonatal rat pups were conducted in strict accordance with the ARRIVE guidelines on animal research [ ]. Our protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee (IAEC) of Southeast University, Nanjing, China. Cardiomyocytes were isolated from the hearts of 2–3-day-old SD rats. The ventricles were cut into 0.5–1-mm 3 square pieces and digested enzymatically through multiple rounds of treatment with 0.05% pancreatin (Sigma) and 84 units/mL collagenase (Sigma) in a balanced salt solution. The cells were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, resuspended in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium with F-12 (DMEM/F-12, Gibco) and plated with a selective agent for 2 h to remove contaminating non-myocytes. The enriched cardiomyocyte fractions were then cultured in DMEM/F12 with 10% foetal bovine serum. These cells were confirmed to be of cardiomyocyte origin by immunocytochemical staining with an antibody against α-actinin (sarcomeric) (Sigma). Beating neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NCMs) were video-recorded at 72 h using a Canon EOS 60D camera.
Detection of Neonatal Rat Cardiomyocyte Apoptosis
NCMs were cultured to 70–80% confluence and allowed to grow in serum-free DMEM/F12 for 24 h. NCMs were randomly allocated into the following six experimental groups: (1) normal glucose group (NG, 5.5 mmol/L glucose), (2) high glucose group (HG, 25 mmol/L glucose) and (3–6) HG + EPO-treated groups (25 mmol/L glucose + different concentrations of EPO: 1.0, 5.0, 10.0 or 20.0 U/mL EPO). NCMs were incubated with glucose and/or EPO for 48 h. The percentage of apoptotic NCMs in the different treatment groups was determined using an Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide (PI) apoptosis detection kit (Biouniquer Technology Co., Hangzhou, China), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Fluorescence was detected through flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences); apoptotic cells were stained with Annexin V, necrotic cells displayed positive propidium iodide (PI) staining and were negative for Annexin V and live cells were unstained.
NCMs were cultured to 70–80% confluence and then allowed to grow in serum-free DMEM + 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 72 h. NCMs were then randomly assigned to the following five experimental groups: (1) normal glucose group (NG, 5.5 mmol/L glucose), (2) high glucose group (HG, 25 mmol/L glucose), (3) HG + ER stress inhibitor 4-PBA (Sigma) group (25 mmol/L glucose + 5 μmol/L 4-PBA), (4) NG + EPO group (5.5 mmol/L glucose + 20.0 U/mL EPO) and (5) HG + EPO group (25 mmol/L glucose + 20.0 U/mL EPO).
The NCMs were incubated with the different conditioned media for 48 h. The percentage of apoptotic NCMs in each group was determined through Annexin V/PI staining and analysed by flow cytometry.
Intracellular Calcium Measurement
NCMs were cultured to 70–80% confluence and then allowed to grow in serum-free DMEM + 0.1% BSA for 72 h. NCMs were randomly allocated into the following five experimental groups: (1) normal glucose group (NG, 5.5 mmol/L glucose), (2) high glucose group (HG, 25 mmol/L glucose), (3) HG + ER stress inhibitor 4-PBA (Sigma) group (25 mmol/L glucose + 5 μmol/L 4-PBA), (4) NG + EPO group (5.5 mmol/L glucose + 20.0 U/mL EPO) and (5) HG + EPO group (25 mmol/L glucose + 20.0 U/mL EPO). The NCMs were incubated with glucose and/or EPO and 4-PBA for 48 h, and the intracellular calcium levels were then measured through confocal microscopy in conjunction with the calcium indicator Fluo-3-AM (Molecular Probes). Briefly, NCMs were gently washed three times with Ca 2+ -free Hank’s solution, loaded with 5 μmol/L Fluo-3-AM (Life Technology) in 0.1% Pluronic F-127 (Sigma) for 40 min at 37 °C and gently washed twice. The fluorescence was visualized using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope equipped with an argon laser (488 nm) and a ×40 1.3NA oil immersion objective. The digital images were analysed with IDL image processing software (ver 5.4). The average fluorescence intensity of the intracellular areas was measured to index the calcium level. The data were normalized to the fluorescence intensity before treatment (control) for statistical analysis.
Statistical Analysis
The data are expressed as the means ± SE. The statistical analyses were performed using SPSS statistical software (version 17.0, SPSS). Between-group comparisons of the means were performed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s post hoc test. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Recovery of Cardiac Function in Rats with DCM After EPO Administration
Three rats, two in the vehicle-treated diabetic group and one in the EPO-treated diabetic group, died during the treatment period. The metabolic and haemodynamic parameters for all of the animal groups are presented in Table 1 . As shown in Table 1 and Fig. 1 , the LVDd and LVDs were noticeably increased in the diabetic group compared with the control group. EF % was significantly decreased in the vehicle-treated diabetic rats compared with the control group, indicating that LV systolic function was significantly damaged in diabetic rats. Compared with the vehicle-treated diabetic rats, the EPO-treated diabetic rats displayed a significantly increased EF % and noticeably decreased LVDd and LVDs, indicating that the EPO treatment attenuated LV dilatation and dysfunction. EPO administration reduced the HW/tibial length ratio in diabetic rats. Blood glucose levels were significantly increased and remained consistently elevated in diabetic rats.

EPO Decreased GRP78 Expression But Increased the Expression of the SERCA2a and EPOR mRNAs and Proteins in Diabetic Myocardial Tissues
As shown in Fig. 2 a, the relative levels of the GRP78 mRNA were significantly increased in diabetic rats compared with control rats (GRP78 mRNA 1.34 ± 0.06 vs. 0.98 ± 0.05, P < 0.01), and the levels of the GRP78 mRNA were significantly decreased in the EPO-treated diabetic rats compared with the vehicle-treated diabetic rats (GRP78 mRNA 0.96 ± 0.05 vs.1.34 ± 0.06, P < 0.01). However, the levels of SERCA2a and EPOR mRNAs were significantly decreased in the diabetic rats compared with the control rats (SERCA2a mRNA 0.59 ± 0.09 vs. 1.00 ± 0.06, P < 0.01; EPOR mRNA 0.58 ± 0.09 vs. 1.00 ± 0.05, P < 0.01), and the SERCA2a and EPOR mRNA levels were significantly increased in EPO-treated diabetic rats compared with vehicle-treated diabetic rats (SERCA2a mRNA 1.33 ± 0.08 vs. 0.59 ± 0.09, P < 0.01; EPOR mRNA 1.39 ± 0.16 vs. 0.58 ± 0.09, P < 0.01).

As shown in Fig. 6 , the cell apoptosis rate was increased by the 48-h HG treatment, (apoptosis rate 15.6 ± 0.78 vs. 37.9 ± 1.59%, P < 0.01). A reduction in the apoptosis rate was observed for cardiomyocytes treated with 20 U/mL EPO compared with cardiomyocytes cultured under HG conditions (apoptosis rate 18.9 ± 1.94 vs. 37.9 ± 1.59%, P < 0.01). Furthermore, the ER stress inhibitor 4-PBA protected the cardiomyocytes from HG-induced apoptosis (apoptosis rate 20.58 ± 2.58 vs. 37.9 ± 1.59%, P < 0.01) to the same extent as EPO.

EPO Decreased the HG-Induced Increase in the Intracellular Calcium Concentration in Rat Neonatal Ventricular Cardiomyocytes
As shown in Fig. 7 , the 48-h HG treatment increased the fluorescence intensity compared to the baseline.

EPO Decreased GRP78 Expression But Increased the Expression of the SERCA2a and EPOR mRNAs and Proteins in HG-Treated Rat Neonatal Ventricular Cardiomyocytes
As shown in Fig. 8 a, after the 48-h treatment with 20 U/mL EPO, cardiomyocytes cultured under HG conditions showed a reduction in GRP78 mRNA levels compared with the baseline (GRP78 mRNA 4.51 ± 1.08 vs. 6.52 ± 0.52, P < 0.01). Moreover, after HG-induced cardiomyocytes were treated with the ER stress inhibitor 4-PBA, the GRP78 mRNA level decreased to a similar extent as that observed in cells treated with EPO (GRP78 mRNA 4.45 ± 0.71 vs. 6.52 ± 0.52, P < 0.01). Fig. 8 EPO decreased GRP78 expression but increased SERCA2a and EPOR mRNA expression in rat neonatal ventricular cardiomyocytes. a – c Real-time PCR analysis of GRP78, SERCA2a and EPOR mRNA expression.

However, the relative levels of SERCA2a and EPOR mRNAs were significantly increased in the EPO + HG group compared with the HG group (SERCA2a mRNA 0.71 ± 0.17 vs. 0.36 ± 0.06, P < 0.01; EPOR mRNA 0.70 ± 0.14 vs. 0.42 ± 0.11, P < 0.01). After HG-induced cardiomyocytes were treated with the ER stress inhibitor 4-PBA, the SERCA2a and EPOR mRNA levels increased to a similar extent as the levels observed in cells treated with EPO (SERCA2a mRNA 0.82 ± 0.14 vs. 0.36 ± 0.06, P < 0.01; EPOR mRNA 0.63 ± 0.14 vs. 0.42 ± 0.11, P < 0.01).
As shown in Fig. 9 b, after a 48-h treatment with 20 U/mL EPO, HG-induced cardiomyocytes showed reduced levels of the GRP78 protein (GRP78 protein 0.43 ± 0.17 vs. 1.00 ± 0.12, P < 0.01). After HG-induced cardiomyocytes were treated with the ER stress inhibitor 4-PBA, the levels of the GRP78 protein decreased to a similar extent as the levels observed in cells treated with EPO (GRP78 protein 0.45 ± 0.09 vs. 1.00 ± 0.12, P < 0.01).

The relative levels of the SERCA2a and EPOR proteins were significantly increased in the EPO + HG group compared with the HG group (SERCA2a protein 0.86 ± 0.08 vs. 0.62 ± 0.06, P < 0.01; EPOR protein 0.71 ± 0.08 vs. 0.39 ± 0.04, P < 0.01). After HG-induced cardiomyocytes were treated with the ER stress inhibitor 4-PBA, the relative levels of the SERCA2a and EPOR proteins were increased to a similar extent as the levels observed in cells treated with EPO (SERCA2a protein 0.87 ± 0.06 vs. 0.36 ± 0.06, P < 0.01; EPOR protein 0.63 ± 0.14 vs. 0.42 ± 0.11, P < 0.01).
Discussion
Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a specific form of cardiomyopathy in patients with diabetes that might contribute to myocardial dysfunction in the absence of coronary artery atheroma. However, the exact pathophysiological mechanisms that lead to DCM remain a mystery. In our study, we documented increased myocardial expression of the ER stress marker GRP78 and decreased myocardial expression of SERCA2a and EPOR in diabetic rats. Our results provide the first demonstration that EPO administration prevents the increase in GRP78 expression, increases SERCA2a and EPOR expression, reduces myocardial apoptosis and attenuates cardiac dysfunction in diabetic rats. Furthermore, our in vitro study confirmed our in vivo results. We documented an increased apoptotic rate and an increased intensity of calcium fluorescence in HG-treated cardiomyocytes. EPO protected against HG-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. EPO decreased GRP78 expression, increased SERCA2a and EPOR expression and decreased the intensity of calcium fluorescence in HG-stimulated cardiomyocytes.
EPO Inhibits ER Stress and Increases SERCA2a Expression in Diabetic Rats
ER stress has been reported to be a potential contributing factor in the pathogenesis of DCM. GRP78 is a well-established marker of ER stress [ ]. Hyperglycaemia has been consistently shown to increase the GRP78 levels and enhance ER stress, which play important roles in the pathophysiology of DCM [ , ]. In this study, increased GRP78 expression was observed in the diabetic myocardium, suggesting that excessive ER stress is involved in the pathology of DCM. Furthermore, we documented a decrease in SERCA2a expression in diabetic rats. According to Shi et al., changes in the levels of calcium-handling proteins are directly related to ER stress [ ]. The ER stress inhibitor 4-PBA reversed the HG-induced decrease in SERCA2a in cardiomyocytes in our study. Therefore, we hypothesised that decreased expression of the calcium-handling protein SERCA2a predisposed the heart to cardiac insufficiency due to ER stress in the myocardium.
DCM has been reported to manifest as enhanced ER stress and decreased expression of calcium-handling proteins in the myocardium [ , ], and we observed similar findings in cardiomyocytes incubated with HG. Multiple pathological stimuli, including ischaemia, oxidative stress, hypoxia, hyperglycaemia and hyperlipidaemia, are known to cause ER stress. However, exposure to HG appears to be the central mechanism underlying ER stress. The ER plays a crucial role in cellular homeostasis. Consistent with the in vivo results, increased GRP78 expression and decreased SERCA2a mRNA and protein levels were observed in cardiomyocytes cultured under HG conditions. We also documented an increase in the intensity of calcium fluorescence in HG-treated cardiomyocytes. SERCA2a is important in calcium reuptake in the ER. Decreased SERCA2a expression is critically involved in the elevation of the cytosolic calcium concentration, resulting in disturbed calcium homeostasis and cardiac insufficiency. The observation of an increase in the intensity of calcium fluorescence indicated that calcium homoeostasis was impaired in HG-stimulated cardiomyocytes.
Studies investigating the myocardioprotective effects of EPO have mainly focused on hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, acute myocardial infarction and myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion. EPO is reported to have cardioprotective effects on animal models by activating anti-apoptotic, anti-oxidant, and anti-inflammatory pathways, as well as by stimulating angiogenic and anti-fibrotic processes. Few studies have described an effect of EPO treatment on diabetic cardiac tissue. Our previous study investigated the effect of EPO on diabetic myocardial damages and showed that the administration of EPO improves cardiac function and reverses cardiac remodelling in rats with DCM by enhancing angiogenesis and attenuating interstitial fibrosis [ ]. However, the mechanisms underlying the cardioprotective effects of EPO on subjects with DCM are less clear. EPO has been suggested to improve heart function by inhibiting ER stress in many experimental models [ , ]. As shown in the study conducted by Zhao et al. [ ], EPO suppresses the expression of the ER stress signalling proteins GRP78, activating transcription factor (ATF) 6α and CCAAT enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) in brain microvessels and decreases the number of CHOP-positive apoptotic neurons. The present study provides the first evidence that EPO exerts a protective effect against diabetic cardiac damage through attenuating ER stress. ER stress was examined in diabetic rats and HG-stimulated cardiomyocytes to obtain insights into the mechanism underlying the beneficial effects of the EPO treatment on DCM. In response to the EPO treatment, GRP78 expression was decreased in diabetic rats and HG-treated cardiomyocytes, suggesting that EPO antagonizes the ER stress response elicited by HG. EPO administration increased SERCA2a expression in both diabetic rats and HG-treated cardiomyocytes. In addition, the EPO treatment decreased the intracellular calcium levels in cardiomyocytes incubated with HG. Therefore, EPO treatment normalized the abnormalities in calcium-handling proteins and impaired calcium homeostasis in the ER. EPO has potential as a new therapeutic agent in managing diabetic cardiac complications in patients. EPO treatment significantly increased SERCA2a and EPOR expression and significantly normalized impaired calcium homeostasis. Notably, EPO behaves similarly to the ER stress inhibitor 4-PBA in attenuating HG-mediated injury.
EPO Reduces Apoptosis in Diabetic Rats
In our study, we observed increased apoptosis in the myocardial tissue from diabetic rats. Excessive or prolonged ER stress eventually triggers cell apoptosis [ , ]. HG-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis is considered an important mechanism of DCM; accordingly, we documented an enhanced rate of apoptosis in HG-treated cardiomyocytes. ER stress is one of the upstream lesions that induces cell apoptosis and is critically implicated in the pathogenesis of DCM. Apoptotic changes occurring subsequent to ER stress should be targeted to alleviate cardiac insufficiency in the heart of patients with diabetes. EPO treatment attenuated diabetic myocardial injury and decreased cardiomyocyte apoptosis. In addition, EPO treatment decreased the rate of cardiomyocyte apoptosis following treatment with HG. Based on these findings, the cardioprotective effect of EPO might be mediated by the inhibition of ER stress-induced apoptosis.
EPO Improves Cardiac Function
DCM is characterized by impaired LV systolic or diastolic function. In the current study, LV systolic function was significantly decreased in the rats with DCM, and the LVDd and LVDs were significantly increased, indicating impaired cardiac performance. However, the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of DCM have not been completely elucidated. Based on our results, the attenuation of ER stress and reduction of apoptosis might contribute to the myocardial protection conferred by EPO.
However, EPO might exert adverse effects that involve the vasculature system and unchecked cellular proliferation. According to Skali et al., EPO administration to patients with DM and renal disease results in a twofold increase in stroke [ ]. As shown in the study by Frietsch et al., blood viscosity is increased in mice that overexpress EPO, and this is accompanied by a reduction in cerebral blood flow. Consequently, EPO might increase the risk for stroke by increasing blood viscosity [ ]. In our preliminary experiment, rats were subcutaneously injected with three different doses of EPO (500, 1000 or 2000 U/kg) once per week for 12 weeks. The 1000- and 2000-U/kg doses of EPO exerted an appropriate level of cardioprotection. Considering the increased erythrocyte levels achieved by 2000 U/kg EPO compared with 1000 U/kg EPO, we chose 1000 U/kg EPO for the final study. In our follow-up experiment, we will measure the blood viscosity.
Conclusions
The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of EPO on DCM and to investigate whether the cardioprotective effects of EPO were mediated by inhibiting ER stress-induced apoptosis. The key findings from this study are that EPO treatment is associated with attenuated ER stress, increased SERCA2a expression, improved abnormal calcium homoeostasis, decreased myocardial cell apoptosis and improved cardiac function parameters. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism of action of EPO in the management of DCM.
