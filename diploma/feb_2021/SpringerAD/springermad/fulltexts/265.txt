Introduction
Postthrombotic syndrome (PTS) is one of the troublesome complication of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) [ ], which can result in chronic calf swelling, which might lead to brownish skin pigmentation of the lateral malleolus medialis and, in extreme circumstances, to venous ulceration of the skin [ ]. PTS impairs quality of life significantly and is associated with considerable economic burden on society [ , ]. Up till now, therapeutic options for PTS are very limited [ ] and prevention is therefore of major importance.
It has been reported that there are approximately 20–50% of all patients with an iliofemoral vein thrombosis treated by anticoagulation and compression stockings will subsequently develop PTS [ , , , , ]. Thrombolysis, especially catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT), could restore the blood flow which may reduce long term venous occlusion and valve damage, and further diminish the sequelae of PTS [ , , , ]. Despite this, about 30.3 and 41.1% DVT patients also suffered PTS at 6 months and 24 months, respectively [ ]. This may account for most iliofemoral vein thrombosis combined with iliac vein compression syndrome (IVCS), or named May-Thurner syndrome [ , , , ].
For patients with IVCS, angioplasty and intraluminal stenting has proven to be the most efficacious for iliac vein obstruction with acute ipsilateral DVT [ , ]. It contributes to provide durable patency and symptom relief [ , ], and may further prevent PTS. Thus this study included a set of DVT patients with IVCS to evaluate the role of stent implantation in prevention of PTS. In the present study, we retrospectively reviewed DVT patients combined with IVCS and compared the PTS morbidity between CDT and CDT combined with stenting to find out the optimal treatment to prevent PTS.
Methods
Ethics
This was a retrospective case series. The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University, Nantong, China. All patients provided written informed consent for the procedure and follow-up.
Patients
All patients with an unprovoked episode of iliofemoral vein thrombosis combined with IVCS admitted to our hospital during January 2011 and January 2015 were enrolled in this study. The diagnosis of iliofemoral vein thrombosis was established based on color Doppler ultrasonography and confirmed by venography. All these patients were performed CDT under the protection of IVC filter. IVCS was diagnosed via venography after CDT. Stent implantation and/or IVC filter withdrawal was performed according to patients’ will. Stent size was determined by measuring the diameter of the patent distal common iliac vein (CIV). 10–20% oversized stent diameter as compared with normal patent CIV was selected. Anticoagulation, with low molecular weight heparin for 5 days and warfarin which was started from the next day and continued for at least 6 months with a target international normalized ratio (INR) range between 2.0 and 3.0, were taken in all the enrolled cases. These data included: demographic data, clinical manifestations, surgical records, laboratory test results. Status of patency of the iliac vein and the IVC assessed via venogram and/or ultrasonography during the follow-up period were also included. Patients were excluded (1) older than 75 years, (2) active cancer, (3) chronic right ventricular dysfunction, (4) recurrent DVT, (5) isolated distal DVT.
Degree of IVCS
A qualitative estimate of iliac vein compression was estimated by asking vascular surgeons to rate the level of CIV compression based on previously published measurement [ ]. Patients with IVCS were categorized into four classes as follows: none: 0–25%; mild: 25–50%; moderate: 50–75%; and severe: >75%. Patients with moderate and severe classes of IVCS were enrolled into our study.
Procedures
All interventional radiologic procedures were performed by experienced interventional radiologists. Venography was performed in all the patients to document the location and extent of thrombosis. A retrievable IVC filter (Optease, Cordis, Roden, The Netherlands) was implanted into the infrarenal IVC. Then, CDT was performed. A unifuse thrombolytic catheter (AngioDynamics, Queensbury, NY, USA) with 20 cm-length side-hole was placed into the thrombus through the ipsilateral popliteal vein. Urokinase, in a loading dose of 100,000–300,000 IU/h for 1 h followed by infusion of 16,000–25,000 IU/h [ , , , ], was infused continuously via the thrombolytic catheter. Low molecular weight heparin was administered. Fibrinogen was subsequently checked at 12 h intervals. The thrombolytic process was monitored by venography every 24 h. When no or minimal residual thrombus remained, CDT was terminated and the IVC filter was withdrawn. In the group of stent implantation, a self-expanding stent (Wallstent, Boston Scientific) was inserted in the obstructive iliac vein after balloon dilatation.
Follow-up
All patients were followed up every 3 months for the first year after treatment, and then every 6 months thereafter. Warfarin, with a target INR of 2.0–3.0, was applied at least 6 months. Elastic compression stockings (class II, 30–40 mm Hg) were recommended as daily use for all the patients at least 12 months. Duplex scan or venography was performed every 6 months. Villalta scale was scored to verify the diagnosis of PTS for every patient during the period of follow-up.
Definition of PTS
At each of the follow-up visits, the presence and severity of postthrombotic signs and symptoms in the ipsilateral leg were scored by physicians using Villalta scale system [ , , ]. Villalta scale was assessed according to the five patient-rated symptoms and seven clinical signs including ulceration, ranging from 0 (absent) to 3 (severe). Besides, the presence or absence of ulceration of the leg was assessed. A total score of 5 or more was defined as PTS, while a total score of 15 or more or the presence of a venous ulcer indicated severe PTS.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 21.0 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA). Continuous data presented are expressed as means ± standard deviation. Categorical data presented are expressed as counts and percentage. Student’s t test and the χ2 test were employed to compare continuous and categorical data, respectively. All statistical tests performed were two-tailed. Independent predictors of survival and prevention from PTS were calculated using a Cox regression model. Cumulative rates of prevention from PTS were calculated using Kaplan–Meier curves. A two-tailed P value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Result
Patient characteristics
This study included 303 patients who had been diagnosed as iliofemoral vein thrombosis combined with IVCS and 56 patients were excluded. Among the excluded patients, nine patients suffered with recurrent DVT, 13 patients carried active cancer, 20 patients were more than 75 years old and 14 patients were lost to follow-up (Fig. 1 ). Thus, 247 patients were included, who had been treated with CDT under the protection of filter in IVC. Stent implantation was performed in 116 patients and 25 cases developed into PTS during the follow-up period. While among the 131 patients without a stent implantation, 49 patients suffered PTS. Characteristics of these patients were listed in Table 1 .

Stent implantation can prevent the occurrence of PTS
Comparisons of baseline characteristics between patients with DVT combined with IVCS who developed into PTS and did not develop into PTS are listed in Table 1 . According to the data, the location of DVT, stent placement and IVC filter withdrawal were distinctly different between the two groups of patients. But when Cox regression (method: Backward stepwise, conditional LR) was performed, it was found that stent implantation was a preventive measure to avoid PTS (OR 0.541, 95% CI 0.334–0.876, p = 0.012). Filter withdrawal and location of thrombosis did not play a role in prevention of PTS (Table 2 ). The Kaplan–Meier curve was performed to compare PTS occurrence between stenting and non-stenting. It was found that patients with stenting, compared without a stent implantation, had a less ratio of PTS occurrence (P = 0.008). The ratios of PTS occurrence in patients with and without stenting at 12 months follow-up were 9.1 and 30.1% respectively (Fig. 2 a).

Stent implantation can prevent PTS even the filter stays in IVC
To avoid the error caused by IVC filter withdrawal, a new analysis was performed in 120 patients whose filters were not withdrawn from IVC. Among these patients, 47 patients, including 18 males, 30 with degree of iliac vein compression >75%, 41 and six primary thrombosis located in the left and bilateral lower extremity respectively, 15 underwent stent implantation, were suffered with PTS (Table 3 ). Cox regression (method: Backward stepwise, conditional LR) found that stent implantation could prevent PTS occurrence in patients with filter in IVC. (OR 0.477, 95% CI 0.258–0.884, p = 0.046). The Kaplan–Meier curve was further performed to verify the role of stent implantation in PTS prevention. It was found that patients with stent implantation had a less ratio of PTS occurrence (P = 0.032). The ratios of PTS occurrence in patients with stent implantation and without a stent implantation at 12 months follow-up were 8.0 and 37.1% respectively (Fig. 2 b).

Discussion
PTS is a frequent and burdensome complication of iliofemoral vein thrombosis, even among patients maintained on long-term oral anticoagulation [ ]. Thus, the goal of treatment of acute DVT should not only be prevention of early and fatal pulmonary embolism but also be restoration of blood flow to diminish the sequelae of PTS [ ]. According to previous studies, there were some risks factors which facilitated to PTS and may be independent of the presentation of thrombosis, including location of DVT, patients’ age, sex, body mass index, thrombophilia and D-dimer levels [ , , , , , , , ]. While most iliofemoral vein thrombosis combined with IVCS was not well taken into considered in these studies. In the present study, we retrospectively reviewed a set of DVT patients combined with IVCS, finding that, compared with the morbidity of PTS between CDT and CDT combined with stenting, additional stenting could avert PTS significantly.
The pathogenesis of IVCS is mostly considered as compression of the left common iliac vein by the right common iliac artery leads to intraluminal spurs and subsequent venous obstruction, which create the potential for venous stasis and subsequent thrombosis [ ]. This mechanical nature of the obstruction contributes to a poor respondence to conservative therapy. IVCS prevents recanalization in 70–80% of DVT patients and up to 40% will have continued clot propagation [ ]. Besides, it would be up to 73% patients who might suffer recurrent thrombosis even thrombi were removed completely if the obstructive iliac vein was not handled [ ]. Recurrent ipsilateral DVT is considered as the only clearly identified risk factor for PTS [ , , ]. It may lead to further damage of venous valves and vein wall, which may cause as much as sixfold increased risk of PTS [ ].
CDT could yield a positive result for a first episode of acute iliofemoral vein thrombosis [ ]. It could restore the blood flow and further diminish the sequelae of PTS [ , , , ]. But it cannot resolve the problem of residual venous outflow obstruction or stenosis. On the other hand, the residual venous outflow obstruction may lead to venous thrombosis recurrence because of venous stasis. According to a previous study, there were about 30.3 and 41.1% DVT patients who were performed CDT and suffered PTS at 6 months and 24 months, respectively [ ]. Thus, residual venous outflow obstruction caused by IVCS should be dealt with after CDT.
Stent implantation might also help to displace any undissolved residual thrombus material from the vein lumen [ ]. Meanwhile, it could obtain an unobstructed venous outflow channel [ ] and prevent the recurrent thrombosis [ ]. Patel et al. found that stent placement for the underlying iliac vein lesion after CDT had a favorable short-term result in DVT patients combined with IVCS [ ]. Futhermore, a meta analysis also found that venous stent implantation had a low complication rate of <1% for bleeding, PE, and mortality [ ]. In the present study, we conducted a cox regression analysis between the risk factors and PTS occurrence, finding that stenting of iliac vein obstruction following CDT in patients with lower extremity DVT and IVCS might increase the patency of the deep vein, and subsequently prevent the incidence of PTS. Compared with patients without a stent implantation, patients with stent implantation had a significant reduction in PTS incidence (Fig. 2 ).
In our country, for preventing embolization during CDT, it always performed under the protection of IVC filter. The latter may entrap emboli or develop thrombosis and further cause the recurrence of thrombosis and increase the risk for development of PTS [ , , ]. However, according to an 8-year randomized study, IVC filter did not increase the risk of PTS even it could increase the occurrence of DVT in the lower limbs [ ]. In our study, Kaplan–Meier curve was also carried out to compare PTS occurrence between IVC filter withdrawal and IVC filter stay in situ. It was found that patients with filter withdrawal had a less ratio of PTS occurrence.
There are also some limitations in the present study. First, this study is a single-center retrospective study other than double blind random controlled trial, which can bring patients selection bias. Second, PTS is caused by valvular reflux, venous outflow obstruction, or the combination of both mechanisms. Valvular reflux could be included in this retrospective cohort.
In conclusion, in the population of DVT patients with IVCS, stent implantation to solve the residual obstruction after CDT, could prevent recurrent ipsilateral DVT, and subsequently might play an important role in preventing PTS. IVC filter withdrawal also played a role in PTS prevention.
