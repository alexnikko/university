Introduction
Metabolic syndrome (MetS) has previously been defined as a clustering of several cardiovascular risk factors including increased blood pressure, low high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, hypertriglyceridemia and hyperinsulinemia (Reaven ). There is a strong association between the presence of MetS and subsequent cardiovascular disease (CVD) and CVD mortality. The control of these risk factors may reduce the CVD burden globally (Galassi et al. ). There are several criteria used for defining MetS: these include the World Health Organization ( ), International Diabetic Federation (IDF) (Alberti et al. ), and Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults, 2001 ( ). MetS has also been given several descriptions, such as “insulin resistance syndrome” (DeFronzo and Ferrannini ), and “syndrome X” (Reaven ).
Azizi et al. have reported a high frequency of the MetS in Iranian adults (Azizi et al. ), and Ghergherechi et al. have shown that the prevalence of MetS among children and adolescents was 31.9%. A direct relationship between the prevalence of MetS and weight has been reported, with the prevalence of MetS being reported to be 6.3 and 40.8% in overweight and obese subjects, respectively (Ghergherechi and Razaghi ). Recently, Alizadeh et al. have reported that the prevalence of MetS in Tabriz in persons aged 18–40 years old is 11.5%, based on ATPIII criteria. The prevalence of MetS has been reported to be 14.0% in subjects with a positive parental history of ischemic heart disease (Alizadeh et al. ). There is a direct association between a family history of CVD and low educational attainment with MetS (Lee et al. ). A high serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (Hs-CRP) can also predict the presence of the MetS, and is associated with augmented CVD risk as an inflammatory marker (Haffner ). It has been suggested that if serum Hs-CRP was a component of the MetS definition, the CVD prediction could be improved (Haffner ). Moreover, it has been reported that there is a significant association between increased serum Hs-CRP and the presence of metabolic syndrome among individuals without a history of cardiovascular disease in an Iranian population (Kazemi-Bajestani et al. ).
Worachartcheewan et al. have previously identified some of the associated risk factors of MetS using a decision tree approach. They have reported that fasted serum triglycerides (TG) was the most important associated risk factor of metabolic syndrome and the combination of TG, fasting blood glucose (FBG) and blood pressure were strongly associated risk factors in their study (Worachartcheewan and Nantasenamat ). Worachartcheewan et al. also used a random forest (RF) algorithm for identifying the associated risk factors of metabolic syndrome, and concluded that the prevalence of the components of MetS in men, including waist circumference, TG, FBG and blood pressure was greater than in women, while in women, the prevalence of a low HDL-C was higher than in men (Worachartcheewan et al. ). Miller and Fridline derived decision tree models for MetS classification in a gender-specific way. In the model for women, only age was significant as an associated risk factor of metabolic syndrome, while in the model for men, all MetS components were significant associated risk factors (Miller and Fridline ). Moreover, there are several reports showing a relationship between cell blood count (CBC) parameters with the presence of MetS. Sánchez-Chaparro et al. have reported that there are potential associations between high levels of erythrocyte distribution width (RDW) and MetS (Sánchez-Chaparro et al. ). It has been reported that there is an independent association between several components of the MetS with white blood cell (WBC) count (Nagasawa et al. ).
In current study, we aimed to determine which of the IDF criteria is suitable for Iranian population to identify patients with and without MetS (model I). In model II, we wanted to investigate whether there were any new components for metabolic syndrome such as CBC parameters and Hs-CRP (Haffner ; Sánchez-Chaparro et al. ; Nagasawa et al. ). These risk factors would need further investigation.
Materials and methods
Subjects
A total of 6578 individuals were recruited as part of a cross-sectional study conducted by Mashhad University of Medical Sciences (MUMS). The Mashhad Stroke and Heart Atherosclerotic Disorders Study (MASHAD study) was initiated in 2010 and will be concluded in 2020. The population of Mashhad was assessed in a national Iranian census in 2006. Individuals were chosen from three regions in Mashhad, located in north-eastern Iran, using a stratified cluster random sampling technique. Each region was divided into nine sites centered upon Mashhad Healthcare Center divisions. The details of the study have been described previously (Ghayour-Mobarhan et al. ). The protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of MUMS and all subjects gave informed written consent to participate in the study.
Demographic characteristics of subjects [age, gender, marital status, education level, cigarette smoking status, physical activity level (PAL)] were determined by questionnaire. Anthropometric information including weight, height, waist and hip circumferences were obtained. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were measured as described previously (Ghayour-Mobarhan et al. ). Serum biochemical parameters included fasted serum triglycerides (TGs), total cholesterol (TC), HDL-C and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), fasting blood glucose (FBG), hs-CRP and uric acid and all blood count parameters were measured as previously described (Ghayour-Mobarhan et al. ). Subjects were classified as having the metabolic syndrome by using IDF (International Diabetic Federation) criteria.
These 6578 were over-weight, or obese individuals according to the first IDF criteria, in which body mass index (BMI) cut off considered as BMI >= 25 kg/m 2 (Worachartcheewan and Nantasenamat ). Individuals who were overweight, obese and had two or more of the following criteria were identified as having metabolic syndrome: blood pressure >= 130/85 mmHg, FBG >= 100 mg/dL, TG >= 150 mg/dL, HDL-C < 40 mg/dL in males and HDL-C < 50 mg/dL in females.
The decision tree
Decision tree algorithms are popular and efficient supervised classification techniques of data mining (Chae et al. ). Decision tree is a non-linear discriminant method which splits the dataset progressively into smaller subgroups by using independent variables (Ture et al. ). The decision tree procedure creates a tree-based classification. At each branch of a tree, decision tree algorithm selects the independent variable that has the highest association with the dependent (target) variable according to specific criteria (Michael and Gordon ). More information about these criteria has been described previously (Tayefi et al. ). The main purpose of decision tree is to make a tree-based model for the dependent variable based on independent variables. The most significant variable which has more information regarding the dependent variable is termed the root node. Other variables are placed in lower branches of a tree according to their importance. Finally the leaves of the tree determine the classification results. This technique has been used in many clinical studies, as its results are easy to interpret. After obtaining the root node, intermediate nodes are defined, and then the leaves; it is possible to follow the process of assembling a decision tree, and is one of the methods that has been previously used to investigate the associated risk factors of MetS, as the method can identify the most important risk factors for MetS. Classification and regression tree (CART) is one of several decision tree algorithms. CART is constructed by splitting subsets of the data set using all independent variables. Using this process, all branches of the tree are created in an iterative process (Han et al. ).
It is common in data mining methods to divide the data set into two parts: a training data set, and the testing dataset. The model is constructed using the training dataset and it is tested using the testing dataset.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were carried out using R version 3.0.2
The training dataset included 70% of this subset ( n = 4539) that was randomly chosen to construct the decision tree. The testing dataset, comprised the remaining 30% ( n = 2039), and were used to evaluate the performance of the decision tree. A confusion matrix was used to validate the performance of the decision tree for presence of MetS. The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were determined for this comparison. The classification accuracy measures the rate of correctly classifying each subject. Sensitivity measures the fraction of positive subjects (subjects suffer from the disease) that are classified correctly positive. Specificity measures the fraction of negative subjects (subjects do not suffer from the disease) that are classified as negative truly (Lavrač ) such as the following: Accuracy = (TP + TN)/(TP + FP + TN + FN) Sensitivity = TP/(TP + FN) Specificity = TN/(FP + TN)
Where TP, TN, FP and FN are true positive, true negative, false positive and false negative, respectively.
Results
Of the 6578 subjects, 3211 subjects were classified as having the metabolic syndrome and 3367 subjects did not, using the IDF criteria. Demographic parameters such as sex, age, biochemical markers such as components of metabolic syndrome, Hs-CRP and blood count parameters between these two groups were compared using chi-square tests, independent samples T test and Man-Whitney test were shown in Table 1 . Two models were investigated in this study. In model I, 14 variables were significantly different between the two groups were considered as input variables and one target variable, were used to build a tree. Input variables were, age, sex, educational level, marriage and job status, TG, HDL-C, cholesterol, uric acid, FBG, Hs-CRP, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), physical activity level (PAL). The target variable was considered as two classes, the presence of MetS or not. The CART algorithm used the Gini index for selecting variables, and the final tree was pruned. The variables, TG, sex, SBP, HDL-C, FBG, DBP remained in this model. The final decision tree in model I, with size 25, 13 leaves and 6 layers is shown in Fig 1 . The if-then rules created by model I shown in Table 2 . The evaluation of the model I was done by using confusion matrix on a testing dataset and shown in Table 3 . As seen in this table, the constructed decision tree could classify the subjects to metabolic syndrome group and non-metabolic syndrome group with an accuracy of 97%. Of the 1045 cases without MetS in the testing dataset, 988 cases were classified correctly with a specificity rate of 94%. For the 994 cases with MetS in the testing dataset, the algorithm classified 982 individuals accurately, with a sensitivity of 99%. The ROC curve obtained by applying decision tree on testing dataset for evaluating the model I is shown in Fig. 2 . In this graph the area under the Roc curve (AUC) measured as 0.972.

The tree obtained in model I showed that triglyceride was the most informative and important associated risk factor. The decision tree in model I suggests that if TG < 160 mg/dL, SBP < 130 mmHg, FBG < 100 mg/dL and DBP < 88 mmHg, the probability of a non-occurrence of MetS was 99%. In a subgroup with TG < 160, SBP >= 130, HDL-C < 49, and female gender, the probability of occurrence of MetS is 95%. In a same subgroup, 82% of men with FBG > 100 will have MetS. In the other subgroup with TG >= 160, in women the probability of presence of MetS was 83%. In subgroup with TG >= 160, sex is male, HDL-C >= 39, if SBP >= 126, then the probability of occurrence of MetS was 81% (Table 2 ). The decision tree rules showed the similarity criteria for classifying metabolic syndrome subjects to IDF criteria. It should be considered as the robustness of the decision tree algorithm for identifying the associated risk factors to metabolic syndrome.
The tree of model II showed that in a subgroup with age < 46 and Hs-CRP < 2.1, probability of not having MetS was 68%. If age < 46, Hs-CRP > = 2.1, and MCV > =80, 70% was the probability of non-occurrence of MetS. If age < 42, MCV < 80, and RDW < 36, then the probability of occurrence of metabolic syndrome is 82%. In a subgroup with age > =46, Hs-CRP > =1.5, among women with a probability of 69% of having MetS. If age > =46, Hs-CRP < 1.5, RDW < 45, WBC < 5, 71% of men will have MetS. In a similar subgroup, women which have HGB < 13, with the probability of 73% will not have MetS. For subgroup age > =46 and Hs-CRP > =6.9, 62% of men were identified as not having MetS. In a subgroup with age > =46, Hs-CRP between1.5 to 6.9, WBC < 5.4 and MCV < 84, the probability of presence of MetS was 70% (Table 4 ).
Table 6 shows the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and AUC values for model I as 98%, 89%, 94% and 0.972 and for model II as 74%, 84%, 79% and 0.812, respectively.

Discussion
In this study, we have constructed a decision tree based on data from a cross-sectional study to investigate the factors associated with metabolic syndrome in our population from northeastern Iran. The models were derived using a CART algorithm. In model I, the 14 variables were considered as input variables which were similar to other studies (Worachartcheewan and Nantasenamat ; Worachartcheewan et al. ; Miller and Fridline ).
Worachartcheewan et al. applied a decision tree to identify the associated risk factors for MetS. Serum TG was the most important associated risk factor of metabolic syndrome followed by sex, SBP, DBP, FBG and HDL-C. They also suggested that the combinations of (TG and BP) or (FBG and BP) or (TG, BP and FBG) were stronger associated risk factors of MetS than other combinations (Worachartcheewan and Nantasenamat ).
Furthermore, Worachartcheewan et al. used a random forest (RF) algorithm to distinguish of important health parameters surrounding the metabolic syndrome disorder. Based on RF, they concluded that serum fasted TG was the most important parameter and SBP, DBP, FBG and HDL-C were the other associated risk factors. He claimed the prevalence of metabolic syndrome was higher in males than females and it was age-dependent (Worachartcheewan et al. ).
Miller and Fridline compared and validated the sex-specific decision tree algorithms for classifying metabolic syndrome. Their results showed that only age was a significant risk factor in female model. According to their results, in male model, all components of metabolic syndrome were significant risk factors (Miller and Fridline ).
In the present study, we have investigated the associated risk factors of metabolic syndrome in an Iranian population. In model I, we applied all demographic and biochemical markers which were significantly different between two groups as input variables. It can be seen from the results of model I that the variables remained in the tree are consistent with the other studies mentioned above, and is also consistent with the IDF criteria of the MetS in the Iranian population.
Model I showed that serum fasted TG was the most important associated risk factor of metabolic syndrome. It can be seen only TG with sex-specification (female) was a significantly associated risk factor for the MetS. In the male group TG + HDL-C and TG + SBP are another group of risk factors. If serum fasted TG was not greater than the risk threshold, the other parameter combinations would be considered. The combination of SBP and HDL-C in the female group was stronger than the other combinations such as SBP + HDL-C + Male + FBG, FBG + HDL-C and DBP + HDL-C, respectively. These results confirm the robustness of using a decision tree for making the rules for classification of such disorders.
It has previously been reported that there is an association between MetS and blood count parameters, as inflammatory markers (Lohsoonthorn et al. ; Nagasawa et al. ). Therefore, in model II, age, sex, Hs-CRP and blood count parameters which were significantly different between two groups were considered as input variables which have not been considered in any other studies (Worachartcheewan and Nantasenamat ; Worachartcheewan et al. ; Miller and Fridline ) related to classification of metabolic syndrome until yet. Serum Hs-CRP has been proposed as a risk factor of metabolic syndrome. The reference range for serum Hs-CRP is differs by gender, and is higher in men. For women who were > 46 years, if serum Hs-CRP is > 1.5 mg/l, this combination is a significant risk factor combination, while in men with a serum Hs-CRP between 1.5 and 6.9 mg/l, WBC and MCV would be added to this combination. Only age and serum Hs-CRP greater than 6.9 mg/L were associated with associated with MetS features in men. If the age is < 42 years, serum Hs-CRP, MCV and RDW would be associated risk factors. Without considering high Hs-CRP, variables, RDW and WBC would be added to age; this combination is sufficient for men but in women HGB would be added.
Decision trees can easily be translated to if-then rules. Programs based on these rules can be established and applied on personal computers for decision analyses, which can be available easily for physicians and health care personnel to use (Wang et al. ; Podgorelec et al. ; Musen et al. ; Ramezankhani et al. ).
A major strength of the present study is that it was based on a large sample size. It provides an application of the decision tree methodology for identifying associated risk factors of metabolic syndrome in the Iranian population. Using this approach, serum Hs-CRP and blood count parameters were used as input variables, in addition to age and sex. We aimed to investigate the factors associated with metabolic which not considered before. One of the limitations of this study is cross sectional design, supporting further investigation of the association of emerging factor in a prospective study. Subjects who were taking any medication were excluded from this study, but this criterion was based on self-reporting, which may not be completely robust, and is one of the limitations of the study.
Conclusion
The decision tree analysis was carried out on two models. In model I, demographic and biochemical markers, were used as input variables in a large Iranian population and we determined the factors associated to metabolic syndrome. They were equivalent with IDF criteria with high accuracy. In model II, age, sex and Hs-CRP along with blood count parameters were considered as factors related to metabolic syndrome as a new idea. This study provides an easy to use classification rules for identifying risk factors associated with metabolic syndrome that may be useful to develop programs for metabolic syndrome management. We suggest more investigating studies on evaluating the clinical applicability of these models to modify this new idea and evaluation of new risk factors.
