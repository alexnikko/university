Introduction
Helicobacter pylori is a causative agent of gastritis and gastric ulcer diseases, which leads to the development of gastric cancer. Hence, it is classified as class I carcinogen by the World Health Organization [ , ]. More than 50 % of the world population is colonized by H. pylori , but few of them suffer from active disease because of different factors such as age, gender, crowding, hyperacidity, smoking habit and poor socioeconomic status. Developing countries had a prevalence rate of (80–90 %) as compared to developed countries (20–50 %) [ ].
H. pylori carries several virulence factors, such as urease, flagella, vacuolating cytotoxin A (VacA), cytotoxin associated gene A (CagA), and sialic acid–binding adhesin (SabA) proteins that play an important role in invasion, colonization, and cell proliferation [ , ]. CagA is one of the most important virulence factor produced by H. pylori [ ] that enters the host cell through the type IV secretion system, gets phosphorylated and interrupts various cellular cascades, resulting in epithelial damage [ , ]. It is identified as the first bacterial oncoprotein, which associated with gastric cancer by inducing abnormal cell proliferation, inflammation, apoptosis, metastasis and poor prognosis [ , , ].
Glycosylation is essential in many of the physiological and pathological processes [ , ]. Bacterial infections induce alterations in the host cancer cells glycosylation [ ]. Fucosylation is one of the most frequently reported types of glycosylation in carcinogenesis. It is a process of fucose transferred to the precursor oligosaccharide by the catalyzation of fucosyltransferases (FUTs) [ , ]. High expression of FUT4 promotes cell proliferation through augmenting the synthesis of LeY. LeY is difucosylated oligosaccharide that belongs to A, B, H and Lewis blood group family with the chemical structure [Fucα1 → 2Galβ1 → 4(Fucα1 → 3) GlcNAcβ1 → R]. The α1, 3- fucosylation of LeY is catalyzed by FUT4 [ ]. LeY is type 2 blood group Lewis antigens, which expressed at high level in the pathological and physiological process such as bacterial infection, tumor invasion, fertilization, embryo implantation, inflammation and cancer metastasis [ , , , ].
H. pylori CagA plays a significant role in the progression of gastric cancer but their effect on fucosylation to develop gastric cancer is still unknown. The effect of CagA on fucosylation with potential role of LeY antigen through epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation has not been studied. In this study, we examined the potential correlation of CagA, p-EGFR, FUT4 and LeY in human gastric patient’s tissues and blood samples by IHC and ELISA. In addition, we evaluated the correlation between the cagA status of H. pylori with the expression of FUT4, LeY and p-EGFR. This study indicates significant correlation of H. pylori CagA with FUT4, LeY overexpression through EGFR activation in gastric cancer tissues and serum samples.

Anti-mouse p-EGFR antibodies were obtained from Transduction Laboratories, US. Mouse anti-CagA antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Dallas, TX, USA). HRP-conjugated anti-mouse and rabbit IgM, IgG were purchased from Proteintech group, USA. Commercial ELISA kits of p-EGFR were purchased from Abcam, (Cambridge, US) while CagA and FUT4 ELISA Kits were purchased from (Cusabio, US). Immunocytochemical avidin-biotin peroxidase complex kit was obtained from ZSGB-BIO, Beijing, China and DAPI was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Dallas, TX, USA).
Gastric Tissue and Blood Samples Collection
This study involved a total of 625 human tissue and 650 blood samples from gastric patients (2011 to 2013), which were characterized as non-neoplastic gastric epithelium of chronic gastritis (GIs), chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG), gastric ulcer (GU), intestinal metaplasia (IM), gastric epithelial dysplasia (GED) and gastric cancer (GC). The paraffin-embedded human gastric tissues were selected after histological review. Sample collection from the patients and all research protocols were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Dalian Medical University and were in accordance with the established guidelines.
Immunohistochemistry
Paraffin-embedded gastric tissues were analyzed for the expression of CagA, p-EGFR, FUT4, and LeY by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Serial sections (4–6 mm each) were prepared from paraffin-embedded tissues. The sections were heated at 60 °C for 1 h, deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in a graded alcohol. Slides were microwaved for 20–40 min in citrate buffer to expose antigen and were washed with PBS. Slides were then incubated in 3 % H 2 O 2 for 10 min at room temperature to block endogenous peroxidase activity. After washing in PBS, sections were blocked with goat serum at room temperature for 30 min to eliminate non-specific binding and then incubate overnight at 4 °C with mouse IgM LeY (1:100), mouse IgG CagA (1:100), mouse IgG p-EGFR (1:50) and rabbit IgG FUT4 (1:100). Next day, sections were rinsed with PBS and subsequently incubated with their respected secondary antibody for 30 min at room temperature. The signal was visualized with peroxidase-labeled streptavidin-complexes DAB and the sections were briefly counterstained with hematoxylin. Yellowish-brown stain indicated a positive result. The negative control was generated by replacing the primary antibody with isotype IgM or IgG. Slides were mounted and visualized at ×10 magnifications on an inverted microscope (Nikon Ti-DS, Japan). Immunostaining intensity was evaluated by using a semi-quantitative method. The immunohistochemical staining was evaluated and scored by at least two independent pathologists. Each sample was given a score according to the intensity of the staining as follows, none staining =0; low staining =1; medium staining =2; strong staining =3. The data was statistically analyzed. The immunohistochemical localization pattern was also recorded by digital imaging.
Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay
Serological assessment of H. pylori CagA, p-EGFR, FUT4 and LeY were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Commercial ELISA kits were used to analyze serological values of CagA, p-EGFR and FUT4 according to manufacturer’s instructions. LeY serological assessment was detected by in-house ELISA as; 96-well plates (Costar, US) were coated with mouse anti-LeY monoclonal antibody (1:500, 100 μl/well) for 36 h at 4 °C. Plates were blocked with 3 % bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing, 100 μl (1:100) of patient serum was added into consecutive wells along with negative and positive controls, and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. HRP-labeled Ulex europaeus (UEA) lectins (2.5 μg/ml) were added and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. 100 μl of substrate (Xiamen Technology Co., Ltd.) was added and placed in dark place for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.3 M H 2 SO 4 and color intensity was measured at 450 nm. A431 cell lysates (1:50) were used as positive control of LeY. A standard curve was constructed and analysis by using antibody concentration in the range of 1000–15.625 ng/ml. ELISA results for CagA, p-EGFR and FUT4 were calculated and analyzed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Results were analyzed by constructed a standard curve by plotting mean absorbance for each standard on the Y-axis against the concentration on the X-axis, and a best fit curve drawn for the regression analysis.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical differences between test groups were analysed by paired Student’s t- test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by (post hoc) Newman-Keuls multiple comparison tests. Linearity of correlation was calculated by the Pearson’s coefficient correlation method. P < 0.05 and P < 0.01 were considered as significant. The statistical software GraphPad prism 5.03 was used for analyzing the data.

Comparative Analysis of H. pylori CagA, p-EGFR, FUT4 and LeY Expression Level in Gastric Tissues and Blood Samples
Gastric tissue collected from patients of GIs, GU and GC were showed different level of immunoreactivity for CagA, p-EGFR, FUT4 and LeY. GC tissues were showed high expression level of CagA (1.790 ± 0.18), p-EGFR (1.533 ± 0.22). FUT4 (2.146 ± 0.08) and LeY (1.695 ± 0.16) ( P < 0.0001) as compared to expression level in GIs and GU tissue samples of CagA (0.644 ± 0.12 & 1.145 ± 0.16), p-EGFR (0.856 ± 0.11 & 0.678 ± 0.15), FUT4 (0.949 ± 0.14, 1.197 ± 0.13) and LeY (0.687 ± 0.07 & 1.008 ± 0.13), respectively ( P < 0.0001) (Fig. 1 and Table 2 ). Moreover, ELISA was used to determine serological titer of CagA, p-EGFR, FUT4 and LeY in gastric tissues of GIs, GU and GC. Among 650 gastric serum samples, GIs showed significant weak expression of CagA (0.821 ± 0.060), p-EGFR (0.673 ± 0.070), FUT4 (0.680 ± 0.026) and LeY (0.717 ± 0.084) ( P < 0.0001) by Newman-Keuls multiple test (ANOVA). However, GC showed significantly high expression levels of CagA (1.660 ± 0.100), p-EGFR (1.587 ± 0.070), FUT4 (1.662 ± 0.087) and LeY (1.610 ± 0.094) ( P < 0.0001) as compared to GIs and GU blood samples (Fig. 1 and Table 2 ).

Discussion
This is consecutive study from Northeast China on molecular characterization and correlation of H. pylori CagA with different host factors, which play an important role in the development of gastric cancer [ , ]. China has high prevalence of gastric cancer and alone accounts 42 % of all gastric cancer cases worldwide [ , ]. H. pylori CagA positive H. pylori strains are more virulent causing higher levels of gastric mucosal inflammation in gastritis and gastric cancer [ , ]. In this study, we found significant high expression of CagA in the gastric cancer (83.28 %) as compared to chronic atrophic gastritis (60.49 %), intestinal metaplasia (51.72 %), gastric epithelial dysplasia (61.11 %) and gastric ulcer tissues (66.81 %) by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 1 and Table 1 ). Furthermore, the serological results of CagA by ELISA were consistent as gastric cancer showed high titer (85.82 %) compared to chronic atrophic gastritis (60.68 %), intestinal metaplasia (51.35 %), gastric epithelial dysplasia (63.163 %) and gastric ulcer (73.33 %) (Table. 1 ). Our results showed comparable prevalence rates, with those from other reported data; [Figueroa et al. ( )] reported high CagA prevalence of 100 % in gastric cancer, 96 % for ulcer and 82 % for gastritis in Chile [ ]. Adnan et al. (2013) reported higher expression of CagA in gastric cancers (80 %) compared to ulcer (74 %) and gastritis (48 %) in Pakistan [ ] . Recently (2014), we also analyzed cagA and vacA genotyping among gastric patients and reported higher level of cagA gene expression in gastric cancers (63 %) compared to gastric ulcer (50 %), chronic gastritis (41 %) and normal (11 %) tissues sample in Northeast China [ ]. These results suggest that H. pylori CagA expression may have potential application as a marker for the prognosis of CagA associated gastric cancer.
Gastric cancer’s diagnostic and treatment are carried out by targeting a specific biological gastric marker protein, which plays an important role in the progression of gastric cancer, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) [ , ]. H. pylori CagA could regulate the process of gastric cell proliferation with EGFR activation [ , ]. In our study, we found significantly high EGFR activation in gastric cancer as compared to chronic gastritis and gastric ulcer tissues and blood samples by immunohistochemistry and ELISA, respectively (Fig. 1 and Table 2 ). Moreover, p-EGFR showed significant correlation with H. pylori CagA in gastric cancer samples (Table 3 ). Previously reported data from our lab showed that EGFR activation mediated cancer cell proliferation [ ]. Hence, we suggested that CagA develops the gastric cancer by enhancing activation of EGFR.
H. pylori infection alters the host’s glycosylation with the stimulation of specific glycosyltransferases and the sugar antigens, such as Lewis blood group antigen [ ]. The host fucosylated blood group antigens facilitate the H. pylori to adhere with human gastric epithelial cells [ ]. In this study, we found high expression of FUT4 in the gastric cancer tissues and blood samples (Fig. 1 and Table 2 ) among the gastritis and ulcer, which indicate a close relationship between CagA and FUT4 fucosylation. High expression of FUT4 was reported in different type of cancers in reported data. Kudo et al. reported the high FUT4 expression in colorectal cancer [ , ], pancreatic [ ], and lung cancer [ ]. Recently (2015), we also reported significant high expression of FUT4 in breast cancer as compared to normal tissues and serum samples [ ]. These results indicate a close linkage between FUT4 overexpression with H. pylori CagA.
Human Lewis antigens represent terminal modifications on the glycans. In human stomach, the LeY blood antigen is predominately expressed by the mucous, chief and parietal cells of gastric glands [ ]. In our study, we found strong staining for LeY in gastric cancer by immunohistochemistry while gastric ulcer and the chronic gastritis showed low level (Fig. 1 and Table 2 ). Previous studies reported that LeY expressions were high in gastric cancer in the range of 15–85 % [ , , ]. Escrevente et al. reported high expression of LeY and LeX in ovarian cancer with the elevation and progression of ovarian cancer cell proliferation [ ]. These results indicate a role of CagA in promoting gastric cancer with the correlation of LeY. Our results indicate that H. pylori CagA can modify the intensity of the gastric Lewis antigen expression in gastric cancer. According to Wirth et al., high expression level of host Lewis antigen might be particularly adaptive in CagA strain of H. pylori [ ] .
Biomarkers such as sLeA (CA19–9), STn (CA724) or mucin glycoprotein such as MUC1 (CA15–3) and MUC16 (CA125) used as the source of potential prognostic biomarkers in gastric cancer [ , , ]. Now the approach has shifted towards the discovery of group of biomarkers directly related to disease processes. In conclusion, our findings suggest that infection with H. pylori cagA +ve strains results in abnormal FUT4 fucosylation, which leads to the development of gastric cancer. FUT4/LeY overexpression may serve as potential correlative biomarkers for the prognosis of H. pylori CagA associated gastric cancer.
