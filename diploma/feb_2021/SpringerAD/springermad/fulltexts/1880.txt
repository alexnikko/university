1 Introduction
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common sleep disorder of the middle-aged population [ ]. Obesity predisposes to OSA by increasing the amount of adipose tissue in para-pharyngeal area, thereby reducing the caliber of upper-airway [ ]. During sleep pharyngeal muscles lose their tone and tongue falls back in oro-pharynx due to effect of gravity. This further compromises the upper airway caliber and obstructive sleep apnea develops in obese subjects who already have small caliber of upper airway due to fat deposition, as mentioned earlier [ ]. In addition, obesity is also known to reduce the activity of corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) neurons in hypothalamus, that in turn compromises ventilation and precipitates OSA [ ].
Besides contributing to OSA, obesity is also a known factor for the development cardio-vascular problems [ ]. However, present understanding makes it difficult to ascertain whether the cardio-vascular problems are caused either by obesity or by OSA or lastly, by the combination of both. Patients with OSA experience recurrent hypoxemia and they breathe against collapsed upper airway. Recurrent hypoxemia induces systemic inflammation, dyslipidemia and insulin resistance [ ]. Effort to breath against collapsed upper airway increases negativity of intra-thoracic pressure, and changes mechanics of cardio-respiratory apparatus [ ]. Having these effects, OSA can alter hemodynamics and can lead to metabolic syndrome. However, contradictory view was proposed by Vgontzas et al. [ ] who considered that OSA, excessive daytime sleepiness, systemic inflammation and insulin resistance all were manifestations of metabolic syndrome. These factors can act in feed forward manner and finally lead to the cardio-vascular illnesses [ ]. Thus, we have two different sets of literature—one suggests that OSA leads to cardiovascular, hemodynamic and metabolic changes and other which suggests that metabolic syndrome leads to OSA and cardiovascular alterations.
OSA is also associated with systemic hypertension and it has been found that a number of subjects with resistant hypertension have OSA [ ]. Patients with OSA have over-activation of sympathetic system and systemic hypertension can lead to atherosclerosis; through these mechanisms, OSA can lead to re-modeling of cardiovascular system [ , , ]. These changes induce a variety of the effects, e.g., right ventricular dysfunction, pulmonary artery hypertension, increase in left atrial volume index and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction [ , , ].
Previous studies that have assessed the cardio-vascular re-modeling among OSA patients adopted different approaches. These studies differed with regard to inclusion criteria, size of the groups, selection of control group and OSA subjects with varying severity were included in the study group [ , ]. Because of these inconsistencies, they reported different results. Present study was planned to assess the effect of OSA on remodeling of pulmonary vasculature and left-sided chambers of heart. We compared the mean pulmonary artery pressure, left atrial end-diastolic size index, left ventricular end-systolic size index and post-wall thickness of left ventricle between subjects with severe OSA and control group.
2 Materials and Methods
This study was conducted in the sleep clinic of a teaching institute after obtaining permission from institutional ethics committee. All the subjects were explained regarding the rationale and objectives of the study. Written informed consent was obtained.
All the subjects who attended sleep clinic between April 2012 and June 2013 were requested to participate in this study. They were screened for the presence of OSA with help of a validated questionnaire—STOP-Bang [ ]. However, as reported in Indian studies, body mass index (BMI) of 25 kg/m 2 was considered cut-off for obesity [ ]. Cut-off score of 3 on STOP-Bang divided all subjects in two groups—“high risk for OSA” and “low risk for OSA”. Subjects in the former group were included as ‘OSA cases’ while the subjects of the latter group were considered as ‘controls’.
Subjects below age of 18 years, above 70 years and pregnant females were excluded from the study. In addition, subjects with any of the following conditions congestive heart failure; those having uncontrolled hypertension; those having hypothyroidism measured through biochemical parameters; those who had cardiac arrhythmias; those having stroke; subjects abusing alcohol or opioids; subjects having chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or interstitial lung disease were also excluded from the study. Similarly, those with neuro-degenerative disorders, having conspicuous cranio-facial deformity or naso-pharyngeal pathology (spur of nasal septum, intranasal polyp, enlarged tonsils, etc.) were also not included in the study. Subjects having stroke or those who had history of stroke were excluded from the study. Information regarding exclusion criteria was gathered through medical history, physical examination, laboratory investigations and previous medical records (Fig. 1 ). Fig. 1 Working with the subjects included in the study
30 consecutive subjects with “low risk for OSA” constituted the control group. Subjects with “high risk for OSA” were requested to undergo whole night attended video-polysomnography (Cadwell Inc., USA) to ascertain the diagnosis and to assess severity of OSA. 30 subjects with severe OSA (AHI > 30/h) were included in this study as cases while those with mild (AHI 5–15/h) to moderately severe OSA (AHI 16–30/h) were excluded (Fig. 1 ).
Demographic data and anthropometric measurements of all the subjects included in this study were recorded. Height was measured in standing position after removing the footwears using a standard stadiometer and weight was measured using an electronic scale. Neck circumference was measured at the level of cricothyroid using a non-elastic measuring tape. Body surface area was calculated using Boyd’s formula [ ].
Their medical history was also recorded. Hypertension was defined when three blood pressure recordings taken at different times were above 140/90 mmHg, or where medical records depicted prescription of anti-hypertensive medications. Diabetes mellitus was defined as fasting blood sugar higher than 120 mg% at the time of inclusion in the study or in previous medical record. Subjects who have been taking oral hypoglycaemic agents or insulin at the time of presentation were also considered as having diabetes mellitus.
2.1 Laboratory Investigations
Fasting blood sample was drawn under aseptic conditions to measure hemoglobin, serum creatinine, blood sugar, serum low density lipoprotein (LDL), serum very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and serum triglycerides.
2.2 Polysomnography
Whole night attended video-polysomnography was done (Cadwell Inc, USA). Six channels of electro-encephalogram (frontal, central and occipital of both sides) which were referenced to the opposite mastoid electrode (M1 and M2) were used. Two channels of electro-oculogram (PG1 and PG2) were recorded for tracing eye movements. Submentalis electro-myogram and lead I of electro-cardiogram was also recorded. Movements were judged by right and left anterior tibialis myograms. Airflow was recorded using thermocouple and a pressure transducer. Chest and abdominal movements were recorded simultaneously. Continuous pulse oximetry was also recorded. AASM guidelines were followed for the placement of electrodes and scoring of data [ ]. Scoring of the data was done manually by a certified sleep-physician (RG) after dividing the data into 30-s epochs for sleep-staging and 120-s epochs for assessment of respiratory parameters. Hypopnea was defined as 30% or more reduction in the pressure-transducer airflow signals for continuous 10 s along with 4% oxygen desaturation or an arousal. Obstructive apnea was defined as cessation of airflow in nasal airflow channels (thermocouple and pressure transducer) in the presence of thoracic and abdominal movements.
2.3 2-D Echocardiography
Their echocardiography was done to assess the pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), left atrial (LA) size, left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV), left ventricular end diastolic volume (LVEDV) and posterior wall thickness of left ventricle (PWT).
All images were acquired using an ultrasound machine (Philips HD11XE) with a 3.5-MHz phased array probe. According to American Society of echocardiography guidelines, a standard M-mode, 2-dimensional and Doppler echocardiographic studies were performed [ ]. Parameters were measured from > 3 cardiac cycles. All studies were performed by one investigator who was blinded to the group to which the subject belonged (AR).
Diameter of left atrium was measured using M mode. It was defined as distance between anterior and posterior walls of left atrium (LA) at the end of systole. Left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV) and left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) were measured using Simpson’s rule [ ]. Left ventricular posterior wall thickness (PWT) was measured using M mode in the parasternal long axis view and LV ejection fraction was calculated by the modified biplane Simpson method. Mean pulmonary artery systolic pressure (SPAP) was estimated using tricuspid regurgitation jet.
2.4 Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was done using SPSS v. 21.0 (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 21.0. Armonk, NY, USA: IBM Corp.). Descriptive statistics was calculated. Chi-square test was used to compare categorical variables. Independent sample t test was used to compare means between severe OSA and control groups. An index was calculated to control the effect of body surface area for left atrium size, left ventricular end diastolic and end-systolic volumes as body surface area is known to influence these parameters. Other factors that could influence variables under investigations were age, gender, systemic hypertension and body mass index. Analysis of co-variance was used to compare study groups with regard to anatomy of left-sided chambers of heart and mean pulmonary artery pressure after controlling these confounders.
3 Results
In this study, male predominance was observed in OSA group (83% males in cases vs. 63% in controls; χ 2 = 3.06; P = 0.08). Similarly, body mass index was higher in OSA group (25.2 ± 3.3 controls vs. 32 ± 4.1 cases; t = 6.97; P < 0.001) and their neck circumference was larger compared to control group (42.2 ± 3 cm in cases vs 35.9 ± 2.5 cm in controls; t = 8.9; P < 0.001). Systemic hypertension was more common among subjects with OSA (40% cases vs. 7% controls, χ 2 = 9.31; P = 0.002). Prevalence of diabetes mellitus was almost comparable between two groups (3 subjects in control group vs 2 subjects in OSA group). Two subjects in OSA group had diagnosis of hypothyroidism that was clinically and biochemically controlled. None of the subjects in either group ever had myocardial infarction.
General characteristics of the groups are depicted in Table 1 . None of the biochemical or hematological parameters had clinically significant difference. Table 2 shows the comparison of groups with regard to anatomy of left-sided cardiac chambers and mean pulmonary artery pressure after controlling for confounders like age, gender, obesity and systemic hypertension. It must be noted that only left ventricular end-systolic volume index reached statistical significance when these values were controlled for body surface area. Prevalence of pulmonary artery hypertension (estimated pulmonary artery pressure > 20 mmHg) was higher in OSA group (33.3%) compared to control group (6.7%) ( χ 2 = 6.67; P = 0.01).

4 Discussion
This study had shown that subjects with severe OSA had anatomical differences of the left-side chambers of the heart, which was characterized by larger left atrium, larger left ventricular end-systolic volume and thickened posterior left ventricular wall. These subjects also had higher mean pulmonary artery pressure and higher ratio of posterior left ventricular wall to left ventricular end-diastolic volume. These findings were seen even when all the subjects were free of pulmonary, valvular or systemic pathology and these variables were controlled for potential confounders.
Higher mean pulmonary artery pressure was observed among OSA patients in this study with pulmonary artery hypertension among OSA subjects has been reported in earlier studies as well, though the proportion ranged between as low as 20% to as high as 86% [ , , , ]. Among these studies, O’Hearn et al. [ ] had a sampling bias as they included only those subjects who had pretibial edema that could have resulted in an unusually high frequency (86%) of pulmonary artery hypertension. PAH is common in OSA patients even in absence of pulmonary pathologies [ , , , ]. In present study also, none of the subjects had other cardio-pulmonary disorders which are known to induce PAH, yet it was seen. OSA-related recurrent hypoxia can induce recurrent pulmonary vaso-constriction, thereby inducing remodeling of pulmonary vasculature. This, in turn could increase pulmonary artery pressure, at least theoretically. However, it has been found insufficient to induce daytime PAH in one study [ ]. Moreover, PAH has not been found to be correlated with apnea–hypopnea index rather with the daytime hypoxemia and hypercapnia among subjects with obstructive sleep apnea [ , , , ]. These reports contradict the findings of present study where none of the subject in either groups had either daytime hypoxemia or hypercapnia yet PAH was seen. However, due to methodological limitations of present study, we are not able to comment on the effect of apnea–hypopnea index on pulmonary artery pressure in this study group. These findings remained valid even after controlling for potential confounders like body mass index and age [ , ]. In essence, findings of present study suggest that OSA itself could lead to pulmonary hypertension. Earlier reports that have shown reversal of pulmonary artery hypertension after positive airway pressure therapy among subjects with OSA support findings of present study [ , , ].
A number of factors known to affect diameter of left atrium that include left ventricular diastolic dysfunction [ , ], arterial stiffness [ ], apnea–hypopnea index [ ], severity of OSA [ ], diastolic blood pressure and use of positive airway pressure devices [ ]. In present study, we found that left atrial diameter was higher among the OSA patients as compared to control group even after controlling for potential confounders like age, gender, obesity and systemic hypertension, which supports finding of earlier studies [ , , ]. However, none of these studies have controlled the left atrial diameter for body surface area. Left atrial diameter has been found to vary with body surface area and literature suggests that left atrial diameter should be adjusted for body surface area to avoid erroneous conclusions [ ]. Results show that left atrium index (left atrial diameter/body surface area) was comparable between groups after adjusting for other confounders as mentioned above. However, small sample size of the groups does not allow us to comment on this issue and it requires reexamining in a larger sample.
In the present study, OSA subjects had higher left ventricular end-systolic volume compared to control group even after controlling for potential confounders. It remained significant even after controlling for the body surface area. In non-obese subjects, two factors—male gender and myocardial infarction have been found to be associated with left ventricular end-systolic volume index [ ]. In present study, none of the subjects ever had myocardial infarction. Thus higher left ventricular end-systolic volume index could be related to predominance of male subjects as well as increment of left ventricular afterload seen in obstructive sleep apnea. [ ].
In this study, we found that left ventricular posterior wall thickness was higher in the OSA group compared to control group. This has been reported earlier also and suggests higher left ventricular afterload consequent to obstructive sleep apnea [ , ]. Left ventricular hypertrophy, which is commonly seen in patients with systemic hypertension has been reported in subjects with obstructive sleep apnea even in absence of systemic hypertension [ ]. Apparently, both conditions produce left ventricular hypertrophy secondary to increased afterload and could have an additive effect, when they co-exist [ ].
Thus, present study showed significant remodeling of pulmonary vasculature and cardiac chambers in adult subjects with severe obstructive sleep apnea. Notably, these effects are not limited to the adults, but they are also seen among children having obstructive sleep apnea [ ]. On the other hand, treatment of obstructive sleep apnea has been found to reverse these abnormalities [ ]. All these facts suggest that severe obstructive sleep apnea is associated with remodeling of cardio-pulmonary vasculature.
However, like all scientific investigations, this study also had few methodological limitations. First, the sample size was small. Second, polysomnography data could not be recorded for control group. It leaves the window for assessment error in control group leading to inclusion of subjects with obstructive sleep apnea. However, the STOP-Bang questionnaire is a reliable instrument for diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea [ ]. A cut-off score of 3 has been found to have sensitivity of 90% and positive predictive value of 85% for the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea [ ]. Thirdly, owing to the cross-sectional design of the study, the duration of OSA could not be determined, which could have an effect on cardio-vascular remodeling. We propose that in future, longitudinal prospective studies should be conducted in future so that further information regarding the mechanism and incidence of cardio-vascular effects of OSA could be gathered. Fourth, strict exclusion criteria, while on one hand improve the methodological power of this study, on the other hand, interfere with the generalization of results of this study. Thus, results of present study may not represent subjects seen in clinical practice which have other medical comorbidities.
In conclusion, severe obstructive sleep apnea is associated with remodeling of cardio-pulmonary vasculature and left-sided cardiac chambers even after controlling for potential confounders.
