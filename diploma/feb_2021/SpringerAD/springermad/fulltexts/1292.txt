Introduction
Lung cancer has the highest mortality rate of all cancers, and its incidence is gradually increasing [ ]. Lung adenocarcinoma (LAD) is the most common type of lung cancer (about 40 %) and more prone to women and non-smokers, also found in smoking patients. In recent years, a growing proportion of lung adenocarcinoma is attributable to causes such as passive smoking, environmental pollution, diet, hormone levels and genetic predisposition and so on. However, the mechanisms underlying LAD development has not been elucidated; thus, the study of LAD remains extremely important.
Wnt signaling pathway plays an important role in cancer and in embryonic development and regulate cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Therefore Wnt signaling pathway has been recognized as an important anti-cancer and drug intervention targets [ , ]. Studies have shown that the expression of Wnt signaling pathway was significantly increased and very important to invasion, lymph node metastasis and drug in lung adenocarcinoma [ , , ].
LncRNAs have been shown to be involved in the development and progression of LAD [ , ]. Some studies confirmed lncRNAs can regulate the expression of key molecules of Wnt signaling pathway in some cancers [ , , , , , ]. However, Wnt pathway related lncRNAs are not systematically analyzed and detected in lung adenocarcinoma. We will use a high-throughput lncPathTM human Wnt pathway array to obtain Wnt pathway related lncRNAs expression profiles in lung adenocarcinoma and several candidate Wnt pathway related lncRNAs were verified by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis in tissue samples of LAD.
Materials and Methods
Patient Samples
The LAD tissue samples and corresponding NT samples were prospectively collected from 33 patients of the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, China, from April 2013 to August 2015. Of these patients, three (the basic medical records see Table 1 ) were used for lncPathTM human Wnt pathway array and 30 were used for clinical validation. The diagnosis of LAD was confirmed by histopathology. The LAD and matched NT samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after resection. This study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Review Board of the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, and all patients provided written informed consent for this study.

RNA Extraction
According to the manufacturer’s protocol, total RNA come from tissue samples and cell lines of LAD was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The integrity of the RNA was assessed by denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis. A NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer was used for evaluating RNA concentration (OD 260 ), protein contamination (OD 260 /OD 280 ratio), and organic compound contamination (OD 260 /OD 230 ratio).
Microarray and Computational Analysis
For microarray analysis, Agilent Array platform was employed. The sample preparation and microarray hybridization were performed based on the manufacturer’s standard protocols. Briefly, total RNA from each sample was amplified and transcribed into fluorescent cRNA with using Arraystar Flash RNA Labeling protocol (Arraystar). The labeled cRNAs were hybridized onto the LncPathTM Human Wnt Pathway Array (6x7K, Arraystar). After having washed the slides, the arrays were scanned by the Agilent Scanner G2505C.Agilent Feature Extraction software (version 11.0.1.1) was used to analyze acquired array images. Quantile normalization and subsequent data processing were performed using the R software package. Differentially expressed LncRNAs with statistical significance between two groups were identified through Volcano Plot filtering. Differentially expressed LncRNAs between two samples were identified through Fold Change filtering. Hierarchical Clustering was performed to show the distinguishable LncRNAs expression pattern among samples. The microarray work was performed by KangChen Bio-tech, Shanghai, and People’s Republic of China.
Quantitative PCR
Total RNA was extracted from frozen LAD tissues by using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and then reverse-transcribed using an RT Reagent Kit (Thermo Scientific), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. LncRNA expression in LAD tissues was measured by quantitative PCR by using SYBR Premix Ex Taq and an ABI 7000 instrument. Some candidate lncRNAs were validated by SYBRP PCR, these gene primers in the study for Q-PCR see Table 2 . Total RNA (2 mg) was transcribed to cDNA. PCR was performed in a total reaction volume of 20 μl, including 10 μl of SYBR Premix (2×), 2 μl of cDNA template, 1 μl of PCR forward primer (10 mM), 1 μl of PCR reverse primer (10 mM), and 6 μl of double-distilled water. The quantitative real-time PCR reaction included an initial denaturation step of 10 min at 95 °C; 40 cycles of 5 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 60 °C; and a final extension step of 5 min at 72 °C. All experiments were performed in triplicate, and all samples were normalized to GAPDH. The median in each triplicate was used to calculate relative lncRNA concentrations (△Ct = Ct median lncRNA-Ct median GAPDH), and the fold changes in expression were calculated [ ].

Statistical Methods
Statistical analysis was performed for the comparison of two groups in the microarray, and analysis of variance for multiple comparisons was performed using the Student’s t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. Differences with P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant in both cases. The fold change and the Student’s t -test were used to analyze the statistical significance of the microarray results. The false discovery rate (FDR) was calculated to correct the P -value. The threshold value used to designate differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs was a fold change of ≥2.0 or ≤0.5 ( P < 0.05).

Overview of lncRNA Profiles
We obtained the Wnt pathway related lncRNA expression profiles in human LAD through microarray analysis (Figs. 1 a, c and 2 ). The expression profiles of 232 lncRNAs indicated that they were differentially expressed (fold change ≥2.0 or ≤0.5; P < 0.05) between LAD and normal lung samples. Among these, 152 lncRNAs were found to be upregulated more than two-fold in the LAD group compared to the normal lung group, while 80 lncRNAs were downregulated more than two-fold ( P < 0.05; Table 4 ). Oherwise, we found that wnt pathway related lncRNAs were predicted_regulation of mRNA gene in LAD (Table 5 ).

Real-Time Quantitative PCR Validation
According to fold difference, gene locus, nearby encoding gene, and so on. We initially identified a number of interesting candidate lncRNAs (including RP11-50B3.2, XLOC_003,147, RP11-89 K21.1, RP13-39P12.2, RP11-60H5.1, RP11-94C24.10, LOC390483, RP11-305O4.1, RP11-680F20.5, RP11-982 M15.2, RP11-44I10.5, RP11-181G12.2, XLOC_002680), and verified the expression of lncRNAs by real-time quantitative RT-PCR with GAPDH as reference gene, by calculating the 2 -△△CT . We found that multiple lncRNAs of microarray are consistent to results of RT-PCR, see Fig. 4 . The RP11-181G12.2 and RP11-89 K21.1 was most significantly changed lncRNA of these candidate lncRNAs from 30 LAD and normal lung tissue. According to Fig. 5 , RP11-181G12.2 expression of LAD was significantly higher than the adjacent tissues (Mann-Whitney U = 189.87, P = 0.005), while RP11-89 K21.1 expression of LAD was significantly lower than the adjacent tissues (Mann-Whitney U = 193.12, P = 0.0013).

Discussion
Some studies confirmed lncRNAs can regulate the expression of key molecules of Wnt signaling pathway in liver cancer [ ], bladder cancer [ ], and so on. These lncRNAs played an important role in these cancers. While there is no reports about Wnt pathway related lncRNAs in LAD. Our study found that 232 lncRNAs and 100 mRNAs of Wnt pathway by microassay and were obviously expressed in lung adenocarcinoma samples and NT, hinting that many Wnt pathway related lncRNAs were aberrantly upregulated or downregulated in lung adenocarcinoma. So these lncRNAs might regulate the expression of key molecules of Wnt signaling pathway and play an important role in development of LAD.
We also found that 13 candidate Wnt pathway related lncRNAs were aberrantly expressed in lung adenocarcinoma compared with matched histologically normal lung tissues by qPCR and these lncRNAs are key molecules to regulate members of Wnt pathway. Among these lncRNAs, RP11-181G12.2 was the most significantly upregulated and RP11-89 K21.1 was the most significantly downregulated. This result suggests that RP11-181G12.2 and RP11-89 K21.1 might contribute to the development of lung adenocarcinoma; further study of the biological function of RP11-181G12.2 and RP11-89 K21.1 will be required to confirm this notion.
To summarize, our study revealed a set of Wnt pathway related lncRNAs in lung adenocarcinoma by microarray. The results revealed that many Wnt pathway related lncRNAs were differentially expressed in lung adenocarcinoma tissues and NT, suggesting that they may play a key role in tumor development. Moreover, we found that RP11-181G12.2 and RP11-89 K21.1 might contribute to the development of lung adenocarcinoma; further study of the biological function of the two lncRNAs will be required to confirm this notion.
