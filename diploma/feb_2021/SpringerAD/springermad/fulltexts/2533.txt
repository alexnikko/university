Introduction
In recent years, the prevalence of obesity has reached an epidemic stage. World Health Organization (WHO) points out that about 300 million people are obese (body mass index [BMI], >30.0 kg/m 2 ) and 1 billion people are overweight (BMI, 25–30 kg/m 2 ) in the world. However, obesity does not limit itself to a change in visual appearance, but being a metabolic disorder it has number of severe consequences such as diabetes mellitus (Picu et al. ), cardiovascular (Murphy and Loria ) & sleep and breathing (Chang et al. ) disorders along with certain forms of mental disorders, especially depression (Chiu and Freund ; Moon et al. ). Depression itself is found to cause metabolic disorders which include obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus and insulin resistance (Anderson et al. ; Dunbar et al. ; Skilton et al. ).
The relationship between obesity and depression has been largely studied and a strong reciprocal association has been suggested. A meta-analysis of more than 58,700 subjects showed that obesity increased the risk of developing depression by 55% compared to subjects with normal BMI (18.5–25 kg/m 2 ) (Luppino et al. ). Further, depression was found to be associated with weight gain with an increased risk of becoming obese by 58% (Luppino et al. ). Emerging evidence from animal studies indicates that, over exposure to dietary fat can also have negative influences on emotional reactivity and cognitive function. Previously, obesity-associated brain-based disorders were thought to be a outcome of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and, as with T2D-linked cognitive decline, take significant time to manifest often blending with age-related neurodegeneration (Arvanitakis et al. ). In adult or old animals, a long term (12, 24 or 32 weeks) HFD exposure was found to promote/enhance negative emotional states and depression-like symptoms (Dunbar et al. ). But, short term exposure (8 weeks) to HFD was found to have no effects on hippocampal function (Boitard et al. ).
Childhood and adolescent age are particularly crucial for some of brain structures, such as hippocampus, which are necessary for shaping cognitive function and mood regulation (Spear ). Now-a-days, obesity is increasing at an alarming rate in children and adolescents. Recent studies found that short-term HFD feeding of juvenile mice can impair mood and learning/memory (Kaczmarczyk et al. ). These findings were able to reveal vulnerability of juvenile to the effects of HFD. In adolescent mice exposure to HFD was found to impair hippocampal-dependent learning and memory processes and reveals that adolescence as a period particularly sensitive to HFD in terms of hippocampal function (Boitard et al. ; Boitard et al. ).These effects were found to last even in adult age which is not reversed by further caloric restriction or loss in body weight (Valladolid-Acebes et al. ). A careful analysis of HFD feeding in juvenile and adolescent mice is necessary to identify the dynamic development of neurobehavioral changes in them. Additionally, development of inflammation is a key phenomenon in HFD induced obesity and prevalent in white adipose tissue and liver. Peripheral inflammation is capable of signaling the brain, via various routes of communication (Zheng et al. ). It can mediate sickness symptoms, memory deficits and depression through the brain cytokine system, which can diffusely impact the neuronal circuits and neurotransmitters that control behavioral functions (Dantzer et al. ). These reports reveal, that adverse behavioral changes can be identified by the development of obesity and associated neuroinflammatory changes (Sobesky et al. ).
From the above reports it is clear that obesity is a metabolic disorder, along with other complication it causes learning/memory impairment, anxiety and depression-like behaviors in young animals. On the other hand, HFD was found to cause inflammation of peripheral tissues which is capable of signaling the brain-based disorders (Zheng et al. ). In the current study, we aimed to observe the neurobehavioral and neuroimmunological changes that are associated with obesity after 3, 4 and 6 weeks of HFD feeding in adolescent mice (6~7 weeks-old). Further, we are intended to explore possible molecular mechanism related short-term HFD-induced depression-like behavior by analyzing key metabolic parameters i.e., depression-like behavior, structure, neuron growth and neuroinflammatory response in hippocampus which are affected by HFD. Histological and immunocytochemical methods were used to assess structure and neuron survival. Q-PCR was conducted to detect HFD induced alterations in the expression of key inflammatory factors in hippocampus. By analyzing the above results, we are expecting to identify neurobehavioral alterations and the possible underlying mechanisms that will play a key role in inducing obesity and depression like behavior in short time, HFD fed adolescent mice.
Materials and methods
Animals
Male C57BL/6 mice( n = 20, 5–6 weeks old)were purchased from the Laboratory Animal Service Center of Yangzhou University. All animals were acclimated for one week under the following conditions, the room temperature was 23 ± 1 °C and humidity was 50 ± 5% with a 12 h light/dark cycle (lights on at 7:00 a.m. and off at 7:00 p.m.) and food and water were provided ad libitum . They were then randomly divided into two groups, namely normal diet group (ND, n = 10) which was fed with standard laboratory food and high-fat diet group (HFD, n = 10) which was fed with fat-rich diet containing 88% standard laboratory food plus 2% cholesterol and 10% lard. All the behavioral tests were performed on the same animals. All animal experimental protocols were carried out according to the standards of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved according to the Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee of the China Pharmaceutical University.
ND and HFD were provided by the Jiangsu Xietong Medical and Biological Corporation (Nanjing, China). The HFD contains 506.8 kcal/100 g (23.7% fat, 23.0% protein and 53.3% carbohydrate). The normal diet contains 360 kcal/100 g (13.3 g/100 g from main saturated fat, 26.2 g/100 g from protein, and 60.5 g/100 g from carbohydrate).
Experimental design
Body weight was recorded throughout the experiment. Animal’s metabolic state was assessed by intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT). Behavioral state was evaluated by using open field test (OFT), forced swimming test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST). Then, we performed structure, neuron survival and neuroinflammation analysis in hippocampus at the end of 6th week. The general design for the experiment was shown in Fig. 1 . Fig. 1 An overview of the design for the experiment. Animals were acclimated for 1 week before the experiments and randomly distributed into the following experimental groups: (1) a normal diet group (ND, n = 10), fed standard laboratory food and (2) a high-fat diet group (HFD, n = 10), fed a fat-rich diet containing 88% standard laboratory food plus 2% cholesterol and 10% lard. After three weeks of high-fat feeding, the animals’ metabolic state was indicated by intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT), while behavioral state was assessed using an open field test (OFT), forced swimming test (FST), and tail suspension test (TST). These tests were repeated at the forth and sixth week of HFD feeding
Intraperitoneal Glucose Tolerance Test (IPGTT)
In the 3rd week of starting HFD, the animals were subjected to IPGTT over a 2 h time window and after a 3 h fasting (Cano et al. ) and was repeated on the same animals at the end of 4th and 6th week. D-glucose (supplier Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was administered (2 g/kg BW) intraperitoneally as an aqueous solution (2% w / v ) and blood glucose levels were determined with a glucometer (TRUEresult®, Nipro Diagnostics, Fort Lauderdale, FL) by serial tail bleeds at 0, 15, 30, 60 and 120 min after administration. The area under the blood glucose concentration-time curve for 2 h after D-glucose loading (AUC, 0–2 h) was used to evaluate the glucose tolerance.
Behavioral tests
Mice were placed in the testing room 30 min before tests. Behavioral tests were prolonged for 4 days in the sequence of OFT, TST, pre-FST and FST. Mice on pre-FST day were not subjected to any detection, so as to avoid the effect of stressful stimuli TST on the following FST testing. All tests were conducted between 8:00 and 11:30 a.m. in a dimly lit room. After each test, mice were returned to their home cages.
Open Field Test (OFT)
According to Budni et al ., (Budni et al. ) the OFT was usually performed to measure spontaneous activity in mice. The apparatus was a square, walled arena (40 cm × 40 cm × 22 cm) with white Plexiglas and floor. The floor was marked into 16 equal squares and the central four squares were defined as the center area. Mice were placed in the center area of the open-field and allowed to explore freely for 6 min. The crossing, rearing and grooming frequencies were manually counted. The number of crossings represents the locomotion activity, rearings represents explorative activity and grooming represents emotional status. After each test the arena was cleaned with a 10% ethanol solution.
Tail Suspension Test (TST)
TST was performed as per previous report (Cunha et al. ). In brief, an adhesive tape was fixed to the mouse tail (at a distance of 1 cm from the tip of the tail) and hooked to a horizontal ring stand bar placed 50 cm above the floor. All animals were suspended for 6 min in a visually isolated area. The test sessions were video-taped for scoring. Mice with several escape attempts interspersed with immobility periods during which they hung passively and completely motionless. The immobility time was recorded by observers who are unaware of the treatment conditions. The scores were expressed as percentages of time.
Forced-Swim Test (FST)
FST was carried out as per reports with slight modifications (Porsolt et al. ). Animals were placed individually into glass cylinders (height 50 cm, diameter 20 cm) containing water to a height of 30 cm at 23–25 °C. Animals were allowed to swim for a total of 6 min. The total duration of immobility was recorded during the last 4 min of the test leaving the initial 2 min of vigorous activity unrecorded. Mice were considered immobile when they stopped struggling, remained floating passively, made no attempts to escape and showed only slow limb movements necessary to keep its head above the water. The posture of immobility in the context of the FST was originally termed as ‘Behavioral despair’ by Porsolt. The immobility time was recorded by a trained observer with the help of cumulative stopwatches and the cylinder was cleaned after each test.
Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE), Nissl and Immunohistochemical Staining of Brain Sections
Subset of the mice ( n = 6 per treatment group) were perfused with saline and fixed with a freshly prepared solution consisting of 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Their brains were dissected and stored overnight in the same fixative solution. The tissues were then transferred to a 30% sucrose solution for cryoprotection. The fixed brain tissues were embedded in paraffin and were sectioned coronally into 4-μm slices for HE and immunohistochemical stainings respectively. The sectioned brain slices were used for Nissl-staining with 0.25% Cresyl Violet-acetate in distilled water and 1% acetic acid (with a maximum of 6 sections per animal). For immunohistochemical staining of the 5-HT 1A receptor, the brain sections were pre-treated using heat mediated antigen retrieval with sodium citrate buffer for 20 min. Then sections were blocked in 5% normal goat serum diluted in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) with 0.25% Tween 20. The rabbit polyclonal antibody in PBS was used against 5-HT 1A (1:200, ab85615, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) for 15 mins at room temperature and detected using an Horse radish Peroxidase (HRP) conjugated compact polymer system (Wu et al. ). Diaminobenzidine (DAB) was used as the chromogen and the stained sections were analysed using bright field microscopy under an Olympus-BX53 biological microscope.
Western Blotting analysis
After scarifying the animal, its hippocampus was quickly dissected out and lysed in 400 μL RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate and 0.1% SDS). After centrifugation at 12,000 RPM for 20 min at 4 °C, 20 μg of total protein of each sample was loaded into a 12% SDS-PAGE gel and then transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore). The membrane was blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in TBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 (TBS-T) for 1 h and incubated with primary antibodies against cleaved caspase-3 (1:1000, Product number #9664, Cell Signaling Technology Inc., MA, USA), BDNF (1:1000, Product number ab108319, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), p-CREB (1:1000, Product number #9198, Cell Signaling Technology Inc., MA, USA), CREB (1:1000, Product number #9197, Cell Signaling Technology Inc., MA, USA) and mouse monoclonal antibodies against β-actin (1:1000, Product number #3700, Cell Signaling Technology Inc., MA, USA). After reaction with the corresponding second antibodies, proteins were visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Millipore Corporation, Lot No. 1627002). Densitometric analysis was again carried out by using the Quantity One (Bio-Rad) to scan the signals. Western blot results were representative of at least 3 independent experiments.
Q-PCR
RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and first-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using Advantage RT-for-PCR (TaKaRa, China). Expression of interleukin (IL) 1β, IL6, IL2, IL17A, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interferon (IFN)-γ, IL10, IL4, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 was assessed by using quantitative PCR. Primers for these nine genes were as follows: IL1β (forward, 5 –ATT GTG GCT GTG GAG AAG-3, and reverse, 5- AAG ATG AAG GAA AAG AAG GTG-3), IL2 (forward, 5 –GTG GAC TTT CTG AGG AGA TG-3, and reverse, 5-TTA TTG AGG GCT TGT TGA G-3), IL4, (forward, 5 –TCA TCC TGC TCT TCT TTC TC -3, and reverse, 5- CTC TCT GTG GTG TTC TTC GT -3), IL6, (forward, 5 –GCC TTC CCT ACT TCA CAA-3, and reverse, 5- CAA CTC TTT TCT CAT TTC CAC -3,), IL10, (forward, 5 –CAT ACT GCT AAC CGA CTC CT -3, and reverse, 5-AAT GCT CCT TGA TTT CTG G-3,), IL17A, (forward, 5 –TCT CTG ATG CTG TTG CTG-3, and reverse, 5- GTT GAC CTT CAC ATT CTG G-3,), TNF-α, (forward, 5 –CCC AAA GGG ATG AGA AGT -3, and reverse, 5- TTG TGA GTG TGA GGG TCTG -3,), TGF-β1, (forward, 5 –CTG AGT GGC TGT CTT TTGA -3, and reverse, 5- TGG AGT TTG TTA TCT TTG CTG -3,), IFN-γ, (forward, 5 –AAC TGG CAA AAG GAT GGT -3, and reverse, 5- GAA GAA GGT AGT AAT CAG GTG TG -3,). Transcripts were all amplified by 40 cycles of the following: 95 °C for 30 s (denaturation), 60 °C for 30 s (annealing) and 72 °C for 30 s (extension). For quantitative PCR, cDNA was amplified using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (TaKaRa, China) in an MJ Research Chromo4 System (Bio-Rad Laboratories). All reactions were performed in triplicate.
cytokine protein measurment
Hippocampal tissues were homogenized with protease inhibior cocktail (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Shanghai, China). The homogenates were then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C for 20 min, the supernatants were collected and the total protein concentration was determined using the BCA Protein Assay kit (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Shanghai, China). IL1β, TNF-α and IL10 protein levels in the hippocampal homogenates were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (ExCell Biotech (Taicang, China) Co., Ltd) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Statistical Analysis
All results are represented as the mean ± SEM. The significance of the difference between groups was evaluated using Student’s t- test. The statistics were analysed using GraphPad 5 statistical Prism software (La Jolla, CA). Differences with P -values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Results
Effect of HFD on Food intake, Body Weight and Blood Glucose control in C57BL/6 mice
Even though, animals under HFD consumed less food than their ND counter parts (Fig. 2A ) their daily calorie intake was higher their ND counter parts (with few exceptions) (Fig. 2B ) and weighed heavier from day 1 of HFD feeding. At the end of the 3rd, 4th and 6th weeks, they weighed 13.24%, 14.98% and 12.37% respectively (Fig. 2C ). Sensitivity to glucose tolerance can be used as a predictor of metabolic disorders (Schreyer et al. ). In HFD fed mice, the integrated area under the curve (AUC) for GTT showed a steady increase i.e., 1387, 1475 and 1939 mmol/L × min for the 3, 4 and 6 week respectively (Fig. 2D ) but was stood at a standard level (1286 mmol/L × min) in ND fed mice which is considerably low. This suggests that HFD fed mice have developed impaired glucose tolerance. The heavier body weight and impaired glucose tolerance clearly indicates that a HFD induced obese model was successfully established in the 3rd week and was fully developed in the 4th week.

Effect of HFD on Behavioral Performance in C57BL/6 mice
OFT is one of the most frequently used methods to examine locomotor and explorative activity in rodents (Budni et al. ). Similarly FST and TST are effective in predicting for behavioral despair (Cunha et al. ; Porsolt et al. ). In HFD fed mice, behavioral changes began in the 3rd week, a time point when the difference in body weight was considerable and impaired glucose tolerance was developed, and the results were in comparable with the literature (Winzell and Ahren ).
In HFD fed mice, the number of crossings were increased drastically in the 3rd week but decreased in the 4th week and in the 6th week they were lower than that of ND mice (Fig. 3A ). The number of rearings were increased in the 3rd and 4th weeks and decreased in 6th week, but were always higher than that of ND mice for the corresponding week (Fig. 3B ). Further HFD feeding may have brought the number of rearings to a level lower than that of ND mice (7th or 8th week). However, the number of groomings was found to decline from 3rd week itself while it was increased in the ND mice in the 4th week (Fig. 3C ). Fig. 3 Effect of HFD on the behavioral performance in C57BL/6 mice. The effect of a high-fat diet on the numbers of crossings (A), rearings (B) and groomings (C) in the open field test, respectively. (D) the effect of a high-fat diet on the immobility time in the tail suspension test. (E) the effect of a high-fat diet on the immobility time in the forced swim test. Each column represents the mean ± SEM. * P <0.05; ** P <0.01; *** P <0.001 compared with the normal diet (ND) group
In TST, the percentage of immobility time for HFD mice was drastically increased in the 3rd and 4th weeks and decreased in a similar manner during 6th week (Fig. 3D ). In ND mice they have shown a steady increase in every week and was always lower than that of HFD mice (Fig. 3D ). However, in FST, the percentage of immobility time for HFD mice was very low and comparable to that of ND mice, but was increased drastically in the 4th week followed by a decrease in the 6th week (Fig. 3E ). In ND mice it has increased steadily with each week and was always lower than that of HFD mice (Fig. 3E ).
These results suggest that in HFD fed mice, depression-like behavior started developing in the 3rd week (Decrease in number of groomings in OFT, increase in percentage of immobility time in TST) and was developed fully in the 4th week (decrease in number of crossings in OFT, drastic increase in percentage if immobility time in FST), and was in accordance to the maximum difference in percentage of weight between HFD and ND mice. Interestingly, another important indication of exploratory activity i.e., number of rearings decreased in the 6th week instead of 4th week, but was still higher than that of ND mice for the corresponding week. Further HFD feeding may have decreased them.
Effect of HFD on morphology and neuron injury of the hippocampus in C57BL/6 mice
The hippocampus is sensitive and vulnerable to HFD. The hippocampus can be grossly divided into four subfields namely the dentate gyrus (DG), CA1, CA3 and CA4. Structurally, HE staining revealed that in ND group, the pyramidal cell layers in both CA1, CA3 subregions and the granular cell layer in DG subregion were densely, closely and regularly arranged (Fig. 4A & 4B ), whereas in HFD group, the intercellular spaces within the pyramidal cell layers were slightly widened and irregularly arranged (Fig. 4A & 4B ). When compared to ND fed mice, the neuronal loss in DG, CA1 and CA3 regions of HFD fed mice was found to be 14.5%, 22.6% and 30.3% (Fig. 4C ) which clearly proves that hippocampal neuronal loss was induced by HFD. Similarly, Nissl staining also revealed a remarkable neuronal loss of 39.1%, 51.15% and 79.7% in DG, CA1 and CA3 subregions of HFD mice compared to ND mice (Fig. 5 ).

Effect of HFD on 5-HT1A receptor expression, neuronal growth and synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus of C57BL/6 mice
In our experiments, immunohistochemical staining of hippocampus revealed that compared to ND fed mice, expression of 5-HT 1A receptor in DG, CA1 and CA3 regions of HFD fed mice was reduced by 18.52%, 28.57% and 43.48% respectively (Fig. 6A & 6B ). Thus, to explore the possible molecular mechanisms involved in the HFD-induced morphological changes in hippocampus and depressive-like behaviors, the plasticity-related pathway BDNF/CREB and cleaved caspase-3 were compared between ND mice and HFD mice (Fig. 7A and Fig. 7B ). Western Blot analysis of hippocampus showed BDNF and p-CREB expressions were down-regulated by 28.8% and 38.6% respectively (Fig. 7A ). These results are in accordance with decrease in neuronal density of CA1 region observed in both HE (Fig. 4C ) and Nissl (Fig. 5B ) staining and expression of 5-HT 1A receptors in CA1 (Fig. 6B ). Moreover, expression of cleaved caspase-3 was found to be up-regulated by 61.2% (Fig. 7B ). These results suggest, neuronal apoptosis was increased in HFD fed mice and hippocampal plasticity was rather influenced.

Effect of HFD on the expression of inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus of C57BL/6 mice
In order to determine the influence of HFD in hippocampal inflammatory response, a comprehensive analysis of cytokine gene was performed. The pro-inflammatory factors IL1β, IL2, IL6, IL17A, TNF-α, IFN-γ and anti-inflammatory factors IL4, IL10 and TGF-β1 were analyzed using Q-PCR. The data revealed that among the pro-inflammatory factors the mRNA expression of IL1β (155.15%), IL2 (164.03%), IL6 (164.42%), and IL17A (747%) transcript levels were significantly up-regulated where as that of TNF-α (31.63%) and IFN-γ (12.01%) was slightly down-regulated (Fig. 8A ). Among the anti-inflammatory factors, the mRNA expression of IL4 (9.19%) and IL10 (73.95%) transcript levels were significantly down-regulated where as that of TGF-β1 (21.61%) was slightly up-regulated (Fig. 8B ). Similarly, compared with the ND fed mice, hippocampal protein expression of IL1β (145.17%) and TNF-α (165.45%) was significantly increased and IL10 (45.55%) was significantly decreased in the HFD fed mice (Fig. 8C ) and the results are in accordance with IL1β, TNF-α and IL10 mRNA expression. Our results suggest that 6-week HFD intake in young male mice resulted in neuroinflammatory changes in brain.

Discussion
The prevalence of childhood obesity has risen dramatically (Karnik and Kanekar ) and coincident with this upsurge is an increase in adverse childhood psychological factors most notably impulsivity, depression and anxiety (Puder and Munsch ). Due to the myriad of confounds that exist when determining causality of human psychological disorders, controversy remains as to whether overnutrition and/or childhood obesity is important to adverse behaviors (van Egmond-Frohlich et al. ). Therefore, we examined young HFD fed mice to determine whether biobehaviors were impacted. To detect these changes, we fed young male C57BL/6 mice with HFD for 6 weeks, during this period their body weight, glucose tolerance and behavioral changes were monitored continuously as per standard protocols. With few exceptions, the amount of food consumed by HFD fed mice was always less than that of ND fed mice (Fig. 2A ), but the calorie intake was found to be higher than that of ND fed mice (Fig. 2B ). From week 1, HFD fed mice were found to be heavier than ND fed mice and at the end of 3rd week, HFD fed mice weighed 13.24% heavier than their ND counter parts and by the end of 4th week, they reached their maximum weight difference of 14.98% (Fig. 2C ). Further HFD feeding, didn’t cause much gain in weight and by the end of 6th week the difference in weight was decreased to 12.37% (Fig. 2C ). Besides being heavier, glucose intolerance was observed in HFD fed mice as early as 3 weeks and was consistently increased each week (Fig. 2D ). So we can say that a HFD induced obese model was clearly observed in 3rd week and was fully developed in the 4th week.
In ND fed mice, the number of crossings, rearings and groomings showed a steady increase up to the 4th week and started decreasing at the 6th week (Fig. 3A, B & 3C ). However in HFD fed mice, during the first three weeks where the weight gain is substantial, the number of crossings were increased drastically and showed a drastic decrease in the 4th week itself (Fig. 3A ). Similarly, the number of rearings showed an increase up to 4th week and showed a decrease in the 6th week (Fig. 3B ). The biphasic effect (initial increase in OFT activity and further following an opposite trend) of HFD consumption is in agreement with previous reports (Krishna et al. ). Finally, the number of groomings started decreasing from the 3rd week itself (Fig. 3C ) which indicated emotional status change in 3rd week itself. In TST, the percentage of immobility time in HFD mice increased during the 3rd and 4th week, but showed a decrease in 6th week, but was always higher than that of in ND mice (Fig. 3D ). In FST, the percentage of immobility time was almost the same in the 3rd week for both the ND and HFD mice, but in the 4th week it was increased drastically in HFD mice and decreased in the 6th week (Fig. 3E ). Whereas, it was increased steadily in the ND mice and the results were consistent with previous reports (Lavin et al. ). These results demonstrate the development of depression model in the 4th week.
While carefully analyzing the results from FST and TST, we observed few anomalies. They are, a) In HFD fed mice, during 3rd week while there is an increase in the percentage of immobility time in TST. But in FST, it was equal to that of ND fed mice. Why? b) Why the percentage of immobility time is decreased from 4th week to 6th week? To answer the question ‘a’, we must first understand the nature of these tests. In TST, it can only causes some stress in the mice but it’s not life threatening. So, once it felt tired it can stay passive. But, FST is not just about stress, it is also about its life. The experimental animals know it very well and tried to swim as much as possible to float until they can’t swim any more. So in FST the immobility time in HFD mice was very low and comparable to that of ND mice in the 3rd week but was very high in the 4th week. This clearly suggests that the depression model was fully developed in the 4th week of HFD and at a time when HFD induced obese model was fully developed. When it comes to the question ‘b’, in both FST and TST, the percentage of immobility time was decreased in the 6th week, compared to that in the 4th week. Considering that HFD induced obese and depression models were fully developed in 4th week, this “may be” due to body’s self repair mechanisms to overcome such issues. However, further research is necessary to identify the reasons behind this anomaly.
In parallel with the behavioral alterations, our experiments revealed that just 6 weeks of HFD feeding can develop visual changes in their hippocampus which can be observed by moderate cytoarchitectural abnormalities i.e., widened intercellular spaces, loosely and irregularly arranged cells (Fig. 4A & 4B ) with a decrease in cell number (Fig. 4C ) in DG, CA1 and CA3 subregions. Further Nissl staining revealed that compared to ND fed mice the density of hippocampal neurons in CA1, CA3 and DG subregions were decreased in HFD fed mice (Fig. 5 ). Previous studies indicate that HFD consumption is able to decrease the different steps of adult hippocampal neurogenesis such as proliferation of neural progenitor cells, neuronal differentiation, and survival of newborn cells (Hwang et al. ; Lindqvist et al. ), but didn’t found any effects on cell proliferation in the DG region (Rivera et al. ). In another study, exposure to HFD resulted in hippocampal-dependent memory deficits (assessed in radial-arm maze or morris water maze) and a significant decrease in hippocampal neurogenesis when HFD feeding started at weaning (3~4 weeks) age and last at least 2~3 months but not when it starts at adulthood i.e., after 8 weeks of age (Boitard et al. ). In our experiments, we were able to identify hippocampal neuronal loss in HFD induced obese mice models as short as 6 weeks of feeding where behavioral changes were observed in the 3rd week of HFD itself. Combining the previous reports with ours, we may suggest that early life period is particularly sensitive to the deleterious effects of HFD on hippocampal neurogenesis and mood regulation.
Apart from the morphological changes, hippocampal 5-HT 1A receptor expression was examined through immunohistochemical analysis of CA3, CA1 and DG subregions of hippocampus and its expression was found to be significantly reduced to 43.48%, 28.57% and 18.52% respectively (Fig. 6 ) suggesting that, HFD played a key role in decreasing the 5-HT 1A receptors in these regions of HFD fed young mice. 5-HT signaling is known as critical mediator of brain neuronal growth and regeneration (Enge et al. ). The subtypes of 5-HT receptors are expressed early in embryonic life, and their expression and/or localization changes during pre- and post-natal development which suggests that they play a critical role during development and maturity stages of central nervous system (Rojas et al. ). Mice with lower levels of 5-HT 1A autoreceptors were found to be more susceptible to stress and showed a subchronic response to antidepression therapy with SSRIs (Richardson-Jones et al. ; Samuels et al. ). Further, chronic antidepressant treatment with antidepressants (SSRIs) which was found to increase hippocampal neurogenesis and modulation of behavioral effects (Malberg et al. ) failed to increase hippocampal neurogenesis in mice that are germline deficient for 5-HT 1A receptors (Santarelli et al. ). These reports suggest, that HFD can cause depression-like behaviors by decreasing 5-HT 1A receptors in CA3, CA1 and DG subregions of hippocampus.
In hippocampus, BDNF is expressed in hippocampal dendrites and the pro-depressive effects of HFD intake were found to be associated with diverse biochemical mechanisms such as decrease in BDNF/p-CREB in the striatum (Sharma and Fulton ) and enhanced proinflammatory cytokine expression in the hippocampus and hypothalamus (Yamada et al. ). BDNF was found to mediate diverse brain functions such as neuronal survival, neurite morphology, and synaptic plasticity (Cohen-Cory et al. ; Huang and Reichardt ). For example, it regulates local dendritic growth and branching growth and branching in pyramidal neurons of hippocampus (Horch and Katz ; McAllister et al. ; McAllister et al. ), granule cells in the DG (Gao et al. ; Tolwani et al. ). BDNF mRNA transcripts were also found to impact structural and functional plasticity of CA1 neurons (An et al. ). CREB is a transcription factor associated with the BDNF gene expression (Finkbeiner ). Further BDNF is known to block the activation of caspase-3 (Han et al. ). So a decrease in BDNF is supposed to activate the caspase-3 i.e., increases the cleaved caspase-3 expression in hippocampus and was found to be associated with development of depression (Chen et al. ). Along with the decreases in adult hippocampal neurogenesis, the decreased level in BDNF was found to be involved in the pathophysiology of depression, and that their restoration was found to be critical for the therapeutic efficacy of antidepressant treatment (Castren ; Duman and Li ; Duman and Monteggia ). However, specific removal of 5-HT 1A receptors from dentate gyrus (DG) of hippocampus was found to attenuate the effects of antidepressents (SSRIs) on adult neurogenesis and hippocampal neurotrophic factor expression (BDNF) (Samuels et al. ). These results suggest that BDNF along with 5-HT 1A receptors plays a key role in regulating multiple functions in brain, especially in hippocampus. Further, they are susceptible to HFD which causes a decrease in their expression. Their decrease was associated with the development of behavioral disorders through multiple pathways and their restoration was crucial in treating these disorders. So we screened the expression of BDNF and CREB along with cleaved caspase-3 expression to identify the effect of HFD on these factors in our HFD fed mice. Western blotting analysis of hippocampus revealed a significant decrease in protein levels of BDNF and CREB (phosphorylated) (Fig. 7A ), suggesting an inhibition in the plasticity signaling transduction. Further, hippocampus revealed apoptosis in neuronal cells (increase in cleaved caspase-3 expression) in adolescence mice (Fig. 7B ) and is consistent with the structural alterations we observed in above HE and Nissl staining (Fig. 4A, B, C & Fig. 5 ). These results suggest, that HFD feeding decreased the hippocampal neurogenesis, BDNF, p-CREB and increased the expression of cleaved caspase-3, which correlate with the development of behavioral changes obtained from OFT, TST and FST.
Changes in pro-inflammatory cytokines was known to alter hippocampal-dependent learning (Marin and Kipnis ). Low levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in hippocampus were found to facilitate learning whereas their high levels, in particular IL1β (including gene expression, protein overexpression and signaling) was found to specifically impair memories relying on the hippocampal formation even in adult non-obese rodents (Goshen et al. ; Hein et al. ). Physiological IL1β expression was found to be important for memory, whereas high cytokine expression can rapidly be deleterious. HFD was found to increase production of cytokines such as IFN-γ, IL2 and IL4 (Abildgaard et al. ). Significant higher concentrations of the proinflammatory cytokines i.e., TNF-α and IL6 were found in depressed models than that of in normal models (Dowlati et al. ). Identification of mRNA using RT-qPCR is regularly used to detect the cytokine levels in several brain areas such as cerebral cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus etc. (Suss et al. ; Turrin et al. ) and were successfully used for the identification of multiple cytokines IL1β, IL6, TNF-α, TGF-β1 in hippocampus. Based upon these factors, we intended to identify the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL1β, IL2, IL6, IL17A, TNF-α, IFN-γ and anti-inflammatory cytokines IL4, IL10, TGF-β1. All the pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, except TNF-α (decreased by 31.63%) were found to be considerably upregulated (Fig. 8A ) and the anti-inflammatory cytokine levels except TGF-β1 (increased by 21.61%) were found to be considerably down regulated (Fig. 8B ). These results suggest that HFD played a key role in altering these cytokine levels which are able to cause behavioral changes and alter memory and learning. To further confirm these reports we screened the protein levels of hippocampal pro-inflammatory cytokines IL1β, TNF-α and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10. Protein levels in IL1β, TNF-α were found to be increased and that of in IL10 was found to be decreased (Fig. 8C ). These results are in accordance with changes in the mRNA levels of the respective cytokines suggesting that along with mRNA, HFD is able to alter the protein levels too which is capable of causing behavioral changes. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to evaluate a causal link between the cytokine pattern and the behavioural changes.
The above results, i.e., a decrease in the number of crossings, rearings and grooming in OFT and an increase in the immobility period in FST and TST indicates the neurobehavioral alterations induced by obesity and the possible underlying mechanisms i.e., cytoarchitectural abnormalities, neuron loss, decreased 5-HT 1A receptor expression, up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and down-regulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines in hippocampus that will play a key role in inducing obesity and depression-like behavior in HFD fed young mice, in the present case physical and behavioral changes as early as 3 weeks of HFD and immunohistological changes as early as 6 weeks of HFD exposure. Therefore, we have demonstrated that short-term HFD intake in adolescent animals is harmful enough to evoke biochemical changes compatible with inflammatory processes in hippocampus.
Conclusion
In summary, our present study suggests that in HFD fed young male C57BL/6 mice neurobehavioral changes were observed as early as 3 weeks and were fully developed in just 4 weeks. Neuroimmunological alterations were clearly observed in the 6 week. While this work answered few interesting questions about effect of HFD feeding in young mice, it raised multiple questions to answer. They are, a) Regulation of food intake is a complex phenomenon, so how the HFD fed mice always consumed low quantity of food (Fig. 2A ). If the body is able to control the food intake, why it is always allowing the body to consume high calories than the ND fed mice (Fig. 2B )? From 4th week to 6th week, how the HFD fed mice are able to reduce their difference in percentage of weight with ND fed mice. Is there any specific reason behind increase of number of crossings in the 3rd which started decreasing from the 4th week, while the number of crossings started decreasing from the 4th week, the number of rearings were further increased in the 4th week. The percentage of immobility time for ND fed mice was steadily increasing in both TST and FST, which increased drastically in the 4th week and decreased rapidly in the 6th week for HFD fed young mice. What are the factors that are influencing these differences in behavioral changes and how they are able to do so? Even though these observations looks simple, a clear understanding of the mechanisms underlying these dynamic alterations may open-up new ways to develop anti-obesity interventions based on these mechanisms. Moreover, a better understanding will help us to prevent the potentially strong behavioral impairment in the now-a-days growing population of obese children and adolescents which may contribute into long-lasting behavioral disability.
