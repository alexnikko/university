Introduction
Schizophrenia is a heterogenous syndrome characterized by perturbation of language, perception, social activity, affection and volition. Schizophrenia is a major psychotic disorder that frequently has devastating effects on various aspects of the patient’s life and carries a high risk of suicide and other life-threatening behaviours. Schizophrenia is a severe form of mental illness affecting about seven per thousand of the adult population, mostly in the age group 15–35 years. Though the incidence is low, the prevalence is high due to chronicity [ , , ]. Antipsychotic drugs (APDs), especially the atypical antipsychotic agents, are the keystones for the treatment of both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia [ ]. Quetiapine fumarate (QF) is a novel antipsychotic agent with broad efficacy, which elicits response in both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. QF is a BCS Class II drug which is poorly water soluble and may show dissolution-limited absorption. Its solubility is decreasing as the pH is increasing; therefore, low absorption is expected at higher pH environment [ ]. Its plasma half-life is of 6 h and oral bioavailability is only 9 % [ , ]. However, the clinical usefulness of QF is limited by its high first-pass metabolism effect and poor entry through blood–brain barrier. Therefore, it is required to make an alternative route of direction for QF to improve its therapeutic effects.
Earlier studies [ , ] have demonstrated that intranasal administration offers a practical, non-invasive and an alternative route of administration for rapid drug delivery to the brain. In recent years, systemic drug delivery through nasal route has received a lot of attention, because it offers some advantages including avoidance of hepatic first-pass metabolism and the preferential drug delivery to the brain via the olfactory region. Direct transport of drugs to the brain circumventing the brain barriers following intranasal administration provides a unique feature and better option to target drugs to the brain [ ]. However, few formulation factors need to be addressed while designing drug delivery systems for intranasal administration [ ]. The formulation should be designed in such a way that it targets the drug to the olfactory region of nasal cavity to provide rapid transport across nasal mucosa. The nasal mucociliary clearance is the challenge for nasal formulation, which can be avoided by mucoadhesion phenomenon through longer residence time in the posterior nasal cavity [ , , ]. Presently, QF is available on the market in conventional tablet forms which cannot increase the oral bioavailability and brain uptake. Therefore, the nasal route to the brain may provide a better alternative to oral administration of QF.
Microemulsion is a thermodynamically stable, isotropically clear product that has a droplet size <0.15 μm. Microemulsions by virtue of their lipophilic nature and low globule size are widely explored as a delivery system to enhance uptake across nasal mucosa, and the addition of mucoadhesive agents such as polyelectrolyte polymer helps in the longer retention of the formulation in the nasal mucosa [ ]. In situ nasal gels have many advantages over conventional modes of drug administration like extended nasal retention time, reduction in frequency of drug administration and improvement of patient compliance. Gelrite-based in situ gelling nasal formulations have been developed for many drugs such as fluorescein dextran [ ], mometasone furoate and gastrodin [ ]. Pluronic ® F-127 was used as an in situ gel forming polymer along with mucoadhesive polymers such as Carbopol 934 and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose to provide long residence time at the application site [ ]. Chitosan is obtained from chitin by deacetylation reaction usually carried out in alkaline medium, a natural component of shrimp and crab shell. Because of its mucoadhesive properties, the chitosan has been investigated in nasal dosage forms for the enhancement of intranasal bioavailability [ ].
Enhancement of drug solubility is necessary for the intranasal delivery of QF. Because its aqueous solubility is only 3.29 mg/ml, a microemulsion system may be an effective strategy to overcome this low aqueous solubility. The advantages of microemulsion as a drug delivery system are the enhancement of drug solubilization and absorption across mucosal membranes [ ]. Here, we report the development of in situ nasal gelling systems for QF-loaded mucoadhesive microemulsion for intranasal delivery and characterization of its physicochemical properties. Its permeation-enhancing effect and improved bioavailability were also evaluated ex vivo in excised sheep nasal mucosa and in vivo in an animal model.
Materials and Methods
Materials
Quetiapine fumarate (QF) was obtained as free sample from CTX Life Sciences, Surat. Glyceryl monooleate, lemon oil, coconut oil, lenoloic acid, olive oil, oleic acid and castrol oil were procured from Mohini Organics Private Limited, Mumbai, Vasu Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Baroda, Acme Chem Pvt Ltd, Mumbai, and Loba Chemical, Mumbai. Tween 20, 60 and 80 were purchased from SDFCL, Mumbai. Cremophor RH40 and EL, Acrysol K140 and EL 135 and Solutol HS15 were procured as a free sample from BASF, Mumbai, and Corel Pharma, Ahmedabad. Transcutol P (highly purified diethylene glycol monoethyl ether EP/NF) was purchased from Merck Ltd., India. Pluronic F127 and chitosan were procured from Sigma-Aldrich, India. Double-distilled water was used throughout the study. All other chemicals and solvents were of analytical reagent grade and used as received without further purification.
Methods
Solubility Studies [21]
The solubility of QF was determined in various oils, surfactants and cosurfactants such as Peceol; castor oil; lemon oil; oleic acid; linoleic acid; isopropyl myristate; Acrysol K40; Solutol HS15; Tween 20, 60 and 80; poloxamer 124; PEG 200 and 400; Transcutol P; isopropyl alcohol; isobutyl alcohol; and PG. An excess amount of QF was added to these oils, surfactants and cosurfactants. After shaking at 25 °C for 24 h, the samples were centrifuged (16,100× g , 10 min). The supernatant was diluted with methanol and filtered through 0.45-μm membrane filter. The concentration of QF was then determined using ultraviolet (UV)–visible spectroscopy at 209 nm [ ]. The solubility of QF in quetiapine fumarate microemulsion (QFME) is enhanced using different excipients used for the microemulsion formulation and that is also confirmed by performing solubility studies.
Selection of Oil, Surfactant and Cosurfactant [23]
Based on the solubility data of QF in various oils, surfactants and cosurfactants, Peceol, Tween 20 and Transcutol P were selected as oil, surfactant and cosurfactant, respectively.
Construction of Pseudoternary Phase Diagrams
Pseudoternary phase diagrams were constructed using CHEMIX School 3.51 software. The surfactant and cosurfactant used were Tween 20 and Transcutol P, having lipophilic nature. The pseudoternary phase diagrams of oil, surfactant, cosurfactant and water were constructed using water titration method to obtain the components and their concentration ranges that can result in large existence area of microemulsion. Surfactant was blended with cosurfactant in fixed weight ratios (1:1, 2:1, 3:1 and 4:1). Aliquots of each surfactant and cosurfactant mixture ( S mix ) were then mixed with oil at room temperature. For each phase diagram, the ratios of oil to S mix were varied as 9:1, 8:2, 7:3, 6:4, 5:5, 4:6, 3:7, 2:8 and 1:9 ( w / w ). Water was added dropwise to each mixture under vigorous stirring by using a magnetic stirrer. As more and more water was added, the colour changed from transparent to opaque. By drawing the colour change points, the boundaries of phases formed were obtained in the phase diagrams. All samples exhibiting a transparent and homogeneous state were assigned to a microemulsion region, a monophasic area, in the phase diagram. After acquiring the microemulsion region in the phase diagrams, the desired component ratio was determined [ , , ].
Screening of Mucoadhesive and Gelling Excipients [27]
Various mucoadhesive and gelling excipients were screened to ascertain thermoresponsive behaviour of gelling and mucoadhesive excipients. Pluronic F127 and Pluronic F68 were screened as gelling agents while Carbopol 934 P, chitosan, sodium alginate and sodium CMC were screened as mucoadhesive agents. Thermoreversible gels of Pluronic F127 and Pluronic F68 were prepared by a cold method in which Pluronic was solubilized in distilled water and phosphate buffer (pH 6.7 and 7.4, individually) at 4 °C. The solutions were kept at 4 °C until they became clear. The temperature was increased gradually from 15 to 40 °C to assess gelling behaviour, visually. The gelling nature was evaluated on a small volume of sample (500 μl). Similarly, the dispersions were prepared with varying concentrations of mucoadhesive agents. Samples were weighed accurately, soaked in water and kept aside at room temperature overnight. The resulting samples were then examined visually for gelling behaviour at room temperature.
Preparation of Quetiapine Fumarate Microemulsion
After the identification of microemulsion region in the phase diagram, the microemulsion formulations were selected at desired component ratios. The preparation of selected microemulsion was simply performed by adding the weighed components together and stirring to form a clear microemulsion. QF-loaded microemulsions were prepared by dissolving QF into the microemulsion system. The optimization of conc. of oil and S mix was done using % transparency of microemulsion. Based on % transparency data, batch M9 was considered as optimized batch.
Preparation of In Situ Gelling System of Mucoadhesive Microemulsions
The in situ gelling mucoadhesive microemulsion was prepared by dissolving QF in oil, followed by addition of surfactant– cosurfactant ( S mix ) mixture. Then, a defined proportion of water was added and stirred to produce clear Quetiapine fumarate microemulsion (QFME). The in situ gelling system of QF mucoadhesive microemulsions (QFMME) was prepared by initially preparing QFME using minimum volume of external phase and then adding the required volume of polymer solution of Pluronic F127 and chitosan (1 % v / v glacial acetic acid solution) so that the final concentration of polymers in the QFMME remains as shown in Table 1 . After the addition of polymer solution, the QFMME was allowed to homogenize for 1 h. The pH was adjusted to 6.8 ± 0.25 using triethanolamine and stored at refrigerated temperature (4 °C) for further studies.

Evaluation of Formulation
Physicochemical Evaluation
Globule Size Determination
Particle size analyzer (Zetatrac, Microtrac, Germany) was used to determine the mean particle size (PCS diameter) and size distribution (polydispersity index (PDI)). One millilitre of microemulsion was diluted to 100 ml and was agitated for 5 min. The globule size was determined by light scattering based on laser diffraction using particle size analyzer.
Zeta Potential
The measurement of zeta potential has become inextricably connected with the characterization of colloidal dispersions, as this parameter is highly useful for the assessment of the physical stability of colloidal dispersions. Zeta potential was measured using Malvern particle size analyzer (Zetatrac, Microtrac, Germany).
Rheological Studies and pH Measurement
Viscosity of the prepared formulations was measured by using Brookfield LVDV-E Viscometer (Brookfield Inc., USA). The suitable spindle was lowered perpendicularly into the fixed volume of gel which was to be measured. The spindle was rotated at varying speeds, and the suitable speed was selected. The temperature was increased initially above 40 °C, and then, the viscosity was measured as the system was allowed to cool gradually. Different shear rates and shear stresses were applied on the test samples, and the resulting rheogram was constructed to determine the rheological behaviour and viscosities of the test samples. The pH of each batch was measured using digital pH meter which was calibrated using buffers of pH 4 and pH 7 before the measurements. pH determinations were made in triplicate.
Percentage Transmittance
The prepared formulation was diluted ten times with continuous media and acetate buffer, and the effect of dilution on globule size, percentage transmittance and phase separation was checked. The percentage transmittance (% T ) of the developed formulation was measured at 650 nm using UV–visible spectrophotometer keeping distilled water as a blank.
Determination of Drug Content
One millilitre of microemulsion was taken and was appropriately diluted with phosphate buffer pH 7.4, and the drug content per millilitre of the formulation was determined using UV–visible spectrophotometer at 209 nm using phosphate buffer 7.4 as blank.
Transmission Electron Microscopy
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to characterize the microstructure of QF-loaded ME. QFME was placed on a carbon-coated copper grid (Taab Laboratories Equipment Ltd, UK), and then, a drop of 1 % phosphotungstic acid was covered on ME. The superfluous phosphotungstic acid on ME was wiped off by a filter paper. The TEM images were obtained using a Tecnai G220 TEM (Philips, Holland).
Gel Strength Determination
A sample of 50 g of the nasal gel was put in a 100-ml graduated cylinder and gelled in a thermostatically controlled water bath at 37 °C. A weight of 35 g was placed onto the gelled solution. The gel strength, which is an indication for the viscosity of the nasal gel at physiological temperature, was determined by the time in seconds required by the weight to penetrate 5 cm into the gel.
Estimation of Mucoadhesive Strength
The mucoadhesive strength was determined for the QF formulation using Brookfield texture analyzer-QTS where one end of texture analyzer was connected to a 34-mm probe, to which 907.46 mm 2 goat nasal mucosa (obtained from local slaughter house) was appended [ , ]. The other end contained 40 ml of in situ gelling mucoadhesive microemulsion. Nasal mucosa was exposed to formulation for about 30 s and then allowed to detach to obtain load versus time behaviour of the formulation.
In Vitro Drug Diffusion Study of QF Formulations
In vitro diffusion study of QF formulations was carried out by Franz diffusion cell having 2.0-cm diameter and 16-ml capacity. Dialysis membrane (Himedia) having molecular weight cut-off range 12,000–14,000 kDa was used as diffusion membrane. Pieces of dialysis membrane were soaked in phosphate buffer (PB) pH 7.4 for 24 h prior to experiment. The donor compartment consisted of QF formulations equivalent to 1.1 mg of QF. The acceptor compartment was filled with PB pH 7.4, and the permeation was carried out for 4 h. At an interval of half an hour, 5 ml aliquots from acceptor compartment were withdrawn and appropriately diluted if required. After each withdrawal, the volume of receptor compartment was compensated by 5 ml of fresh PB pH 7.4. The temperature of assembly was kept constant at 37 °C, and the volume of receiver compartment was constantly stirred using a magnetic stirrer. The concentration of drug in the withdrawn samples was assayed by a UV–visible spectrophotometer at 209 nm.
Ex Vivo Permeation Study [30]
The freshly excised sheep nasal mucosa, except for the septum part, was collected from a slaughter house in phosphate buffer saline (PBS), pH 7.4. The membrane was kept in PBS pH 7.4 for 15 min to equilibrate. The superior nasal conche was identified and separated from the nasal membrane. The excised superior nasal membrane was then mounted on Franz diffusion cells. The tissue was stabilized using PB pH 5.0 in both the compartments and allowed to stir for 15 min on a magnetic stirrer. After 15 min, solution from both the compartments was removed and fresh PB (pH 5.0) was filled in the receptor compartment. The mounting of the nasal membrane was done using glue at the brim of the donor compartment to avoid leakage of the test sample and supported with thread crossing over the cell.
The Franz diffusion cells used for in vitro diffusion studies had a diameter of 10 mm and mucosa thickness 0.2 ± 0.1 mm. The temperature of the receiver chamber containing 25 ml of diffusion media (PB, pH 5.0) was controlled at 37 °C ± 1 using a circulating equibath (Model 8506, Medica Instrument Mfg. CO, Mumbai, India). Diffusion media were continuously stirred with a Teflon-coated magnetic bar at a constant rate, in a way that the nasal membrane surface just flushes the diffusion fluid.
A volume of 1 ml of QFMME was placed in the donor compartment of the Franz diffusion cell. Samples from the receptor compartment were withdrawn at predetermined time intervals and analyzed using a UV–visible spectrophotometer at 209 nm. Each sample removed was replaced by an equal volume of diffusion media. Each study was carried for a period of 12.0 h, during which the drug in receiver chamber (g/ml) across the sheep nasal membrane was calculated at each sampling point. The formulations were studied in triplicate for diffusion studies, and the mean cumulative values for % drug diffused versus time were plotted against time. The slopes of the graphs were used to calculate the diffusion coefficients.
Nasal Cilia Toxicity [30]
Freshly excised sheep nasal mucosa, except for the septum, was collected from the slaughter house in saline PB pH 6.4. Four sheep nasal mucosa pieces (S1, S2, S3 and S4) with uniform thickness were selected and mounted on Franz diffusion cells. S1 was without any treatment, S2 was treated with 0.5 ml of PBS pH 6.4 (negative control), S3 was treated with 0.5 ml QFMME-4 for 1 h and S4 with 0.5 ml 1 % of isopropyl alcohol (positive control), and after 1 h, the mucosa was rinsed with PBS pH 6.4 and subjected to histological studies to evaluate the toxicities of ME and photographed by microscope.
In Vivo Pharmacokinetic Study
Male Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats (body weight, 250–300 g) were used in this study. Rats were maintained in a light-controlled room kept at a temperature of 22 ± 2 °C and relative humidity of 55 ± 5 % (Animal House, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Saurashtra University, Rajkot). The experimental protocols for the animal study were approved by the animal ethics committee of the department. The femoral artery was cannulated with a polyethylene tube under anaesthesia, and blood was collected from the cannula. Optimized batch- QFMME-4 (10 mg/ml) was instilled into both nostrils of the rat at a dose of 0.80 mg/kg for the intranasal pharmacokinetic study. Blood samples were collected at predetermined times (1, 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, 180, 240, 360, 480 min) after intranasal administration. After each sampling, heparinized blood samples were centrifuged (16,100× g , 5 min). Then, the plasma samples were collected and stored at −70 °C until analyzed. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated. The QF concentration in rat plasma was analyzed by a previously reported method by HPLC [ ]. The analysis was carried out on a C8 (150/4.6 mm i.d., 5 mm) reversed-phase column, using a mixture of acetonitrile, methanol and pH 1.9 PB as the mobile phase.
Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
The infrared spectra of alone QF and QFMME were obtained on Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer (Bruker, VERTEX FT-IR, UK) in order to detect the existence of interaction between drug and polymer. The sample was dispersed in KBr to prepare 10 % of mixture and ground generally in a mortar-pestle with KBr before being compressed into pellets. This pellet was placed in light path, and spectrum was recorded at a resolution of 2 cm −1 over a frequency range of 4000 to 400 cm −1 . The background spectrum of KBr was used as blank for determination.
Differential Scanning Calorimetric
Differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) was performed using PerkinElmer instruments (PerkinElmer DSC-7, Norway, USA.) to study the thermal behaviour of QF and QFMME. The instrument composed of calorimeter (DSC-60), flow controller (FCL-60), thermal analyzer (TA-60) and operating software (TA-60). The samples were heated in hermetically sealed flat-bottomed aluminium pans under nitrogen flow (20 ml/min) at a scanning rate of 10 °C/min from 25 to 400 °C. Empty aluminium pan was used as the reference standard.
Release Kinetic Modelling [32]
The data of ex vivo QF permeation from QFMME through nasal mucosa were evaluated kinetically using various mathematical models like zero-order, first-order, Higuchi, Hixson–Crowell and Korsmeyer–Peppas model equations. Zero-order kinetics: F = K o t , where F represents the fraction of drug released in time t and K o is the zero-order release constant. First-order kinetics: ln (1 − F ) = − K 1 t , where F represents the fraction of drug released in time t and K 1 is the first-order release constant. Higuchi model: F = K H t 1/2 , where F represents the fraction of drug released in time t and K H is the Higuchi dissolution constant. Hixson–Crowell model: W 0 1/3 − W t 1/3 = κ t , where W 0 is the initial amount of drug in the pharmaceutical dosage form, W t is the remaining amount of drug in the pharmaceutical dosage form at time t , and κ (kappa) is a constant incorporating the surface volume relation. Korsmeyer–Peppas model: F = K p t n , where F represents the fraction of drug released in time t , K p is the Korsmeyer–Peppas release rate constant, and n is the diffusion exponent [ ].
Stability Studies
Stability of the developed microemulsion was carried according to ICH guideline. Both QFME and QFMME were stored at three different temperature ranges for 6 months, i.e. refrigerator condition (2–8 °C), room temperature and elevated temperature (50 ± 2 °C). The shelf life of the stored samples was evaluated by visual inspection (phase separation), % transmittance, particle size and % assay.
Results and Discussion
Solubility Study of QF
Determining the optimized microemulsion composition is necessary to achieve maximum QF solubility. Several kinds of oils, surfactants and cosurfactants for the development of intranasal microemulsion systems such as Peceol (glycerol monooleates (type 40)), isopropyl myristate, castor oil, oleic acid, linoleic acid, Acrysol K40, Acrysol EL135, Solutol HS15, Tween 20, Tween 80, Poloxamer 124 and Transcutol P, PEG 200, PEG 400, isopropyl alcohol and PG have been reported. Solubility of QF in these oils, surfactants and cosurfactants is presented in Table 2 . The solubility of QF was highest in Peceol (glycerol monooleates (type 40)) (16.40 ± 0.293 mg/ml), which was previously used as the oil phase for self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDS) of artemether [ ]. Peceol is a bioavailability enhancer, and it may increase oral bioavailability because of the long-chain fatty acids present in its composition, and selective absorption of highly lipophilic active pharmaceutical ingredients by the lymphatic transport system reduces hepatic first-pass metabolism [ ]. Thus, Peceol was selected as the oil phase for the development of the formulation. The solubility of QF in Tween 20 was 27.09 ± 0.566 mg/ml, and it has been used as a surfactant in various reports and also exhibits a permeation-enhancing effect in nasal drug delivery; its hydrophilic–lipophilic balance (HLB) value is 16.7; thus, it was selected as a surfactant. Transcutol P, the commercial name for highly purified diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, associated with improved drug penetration and permeation was also added as a cosurfactant because it exhibited the highest solubility for QF (10.20 ± 0.726 mg/ml). The comparison of solubility of the microemulsion formulation with that of the individual excipients is shown in Fig. 1 . From the graph, it is clear that QF has the highest solubility (42.5 ± 0.324) in the formulation as compared to the individual excipients. Table 2 Solubility of QF in various solvents Sr no.

Optimization of (S/Co-s) Ratio from Pseudoternary Phase Diagram
From the pseudoternary phase diagrams for microemulsions, the ratios of surfactant and cosurfactant as 1:1, 2:1, 3:1 and 4:1 are shown in Fig. 2 . The change in the area of microemulsion region can be very well seen in the ternary phase diagram, as the ratio of surfactant to cosurfactant was changed from 1:1 to 4:1. The phase diagram at 4:1 (S/Co-s) weight ratio had obtained the highest area of emulsification, and so, it was selected for further optimization [ ]. It has been reported that a cosurfactant can reduce the bending stress at an interface and make the interfacial film sufficiently flexible to form nano-sized droplets from different curvatures. An optically transparent monophasic microemulsion was formed in a broad region. This area could be separated further into w/o or o/w microemulsion phases by simply considering the composition, that is, whether it was oil rich or water rich. Tween 20, polyoxyethylene derivative of sorbitan monolaurate non-ionic surfactant with a high HLB value 16.7, may contribute to the formation of an o/w microemulsion. The other region of phase diagram is the turbid emulsion region, which is not monophasic. Based on the results in Fig. 1 , a microemulsion was developed successfully regardless of the difference in the weight ratio between surfactant and cosurfactant [ ]. Fig. 2 Pseudo-ternary phase diagrams for microemulsions composed of oil (Peceol), surfactant (S, Tween 20), cosurfactant (Co-S, Transcutol P) and water. Dark area represents microemulsion region (Km 1 = 1:1, Km 2 = 2:1, Km 3 = 3:1 and Km 4 = 4:1, surfactant/cosurfactant)
Preliminary Trial Batches for Optimization of Oil and S mix Concentration Range
By trial and error method, the concentration range of oil and S mix was determined based on water uptake in the formulation and the % transparency which was found in the range of 52.14 ± 1.27 to 99.9 ± 2.14 (Table 3 ). The batch M9 was selected as an optimized batch, as it contains maximum % transparency of nearly 100 %. This may be due to the fewer amounts of oil concentration and maximum amount of S mix ratio. The high proportion of S mix decreases the bending stress of interface and allows the interfacial film sufficient flexibility to take up different curvatures required to form ME over a wide range of composition. It may be due to the presence of low-molecular-weight surfactant being able to influence the formation of microemulsions by both interfacial and bulk effects. Their short hydrophobic chain and terminal OH group permit them to relate with surfactant monolayer at the interface, thus affecting their packing which is in turn can affect the curvature of the interface and interfacial energy. The low-molecular-weight cosurfactant also enables them to distribute between the aqueous and oil phase, thereby altering the relative hydro/lipophilicity. These two properties render them useful for the preparation of microemulsions [ ].

Screening of Mucoadhesive and Gelling Excipients
Various mucoadhesive and gelling excipients were selected for their use in development of in situ gelling microemulsions. Thermoresponsive behaviour was observed for Pluronics. Based on visual observations, gelling characteristics of Pluronic F 127 was more satisfactory than Pluronic F 68. Gelling properties of various concentrations of Carbopol 934 P and chitosan were assessed similar. Carbopol 934 P with 0.1 % ( w/v ) showed gelling, but it has very less viscosity, and with 0.5 % ( w / v ), excessive gelling and turbid formulation were observed. Chitosan 0.1 % and 0.2 % w / v show good gelling behaviour with optimum fluidity and were selected as mucoadhesive excipient in the formulation. Table 4 shows gelling behaviour of polymers at varying pH and temperatures.

Characterization of Microemulsion
The % transparency of all batches is shown in Table 3 . The optimized batch M9 is diluted 10 and 100 times and % transparency found to be 99.64 ± 0.27 and 100.01 ± 0.72 % (mean ± SD) ( n = 3). The sufficient transparency of the formulation is attributed to the formation of micelles at a concentration greater than the critical micelle concentration (CMC). The prepared microemulsion was diluted with distilled water. It was kept as it is for 24 h to see any sign of separation. Formulation showed no signs of separation after 24 h (Fig. 3 ). Fig. 3 Dilution tests: a microemulsion formulation, b 10× dilution with distilled water and c 100× dilution with distilled water—no sign of separation after 24 h
Characterization data of all microemusions are tabulated in Table 5 . The pH of the optimized formulation should be 4.5 to 6.5 in order to avoid irritation of the nasal mucosa after administration of the formulation. Moreover, the lysozyme in the nasal cavity gets inactivated at alkaline pH, and hence, pH of the formulation should be slightly acidic. The pH of the all the optimized formulation was found to be in the range of 5.56 ± 0.12 to 6.01 ± 1.07 (mean ± SD) ( n = 3). This value suggested that the formulation would not irritate the nasal mucosal surface. Table 5 Characterization parameters of optimized QFME and QFMME Formulation pH Drug content (%) Globule size (nm) ± SD PDI ± SD Zeta potential (mV) ± SD Viscosity (cps) QFME 5.56 ± 0.12 100.03 ± 0.45 131.50 ± 2.15 0.304 ± 0.055 −17.56 ± 0.65 28.5 ± 3.5 QFMME-1 5.62 ± 0.04 99.92 ± 0.18 138.80 ± 1.30 0.357 ± 0.24 16.59 ± 0.95 34.68 ± 0.35 QFMME-2 5.86 ± 0.09 99.54 ± 1.24 141.18 ± 0.85 0.427 ± 1.04 19.95 ± 1.52 38.85 ± 1.07 QFMME-3 5.76 ± 1.14 98.74 ± 1.06 145.27 ± 0.78 0.397 ± 0.17 29.51 ± 1.20 36.27 ± 0.57 QFMME-4 6.01 ± 1.07 99.90 ± 1.12 148.80 ± 1.30 0.460 ± 0.04 32.5 ± 0.51 40.7 ± 1.36 Data are expressed as mean ± SD, n = 6
The droplet size is a crucial factor in microemulsion performance, as it determines the rate and extent of the drug release. Also, zeta potential governs the stability of the microemulsion systems, and hence, it should be measured to check the stability profile of the system. The globule size of microemulsion should be less than 150 nm. Nano-sized globules loaded with drugs show drug release at appropriate rate and dose at specific sites in the brain for a certain time to realize the accurate nasal delivery, which enhances the therapeutic effect, reduces the toxicity and side effect and decreases the dose and frequency of dosing and perhaps even the cost of the therapy [ ]. The narrow globule size range of 131.50 ± 2.15 and 148.80 ± 1.30 nm and PDI of 0.304 and 0.460 for QFME and QFMME, respectively, indicated that the ME approached a monodispersed stable system and could deliver the drug effectively owing to larger surface area.
The zeta potential is a key indicator of the stability of colloidal dispersions. The magnitude of the zeta potential indicates the degree of electrostatic repulsion between adjacent, similarly charged particles in a dispersion. For molecules and particles that are small enough, a high zeta potential will confer stability; i.e. the solution or dispersion will resist aggregation. When the potential is small, attractive forces may exceed this repulsion and the dispersion may break and flocculate. So, colloids with high zeta potential (negative or positive) are electrically stabilized while colloids with low zeta potentials tend to coagulate or flocculate [ ]. The presence of zeta potential to the tune of −17.56 ± 0.65 and 32.5 ± 0.51 mV on the globules of QFME and QFMME, respectively, conferred physical stability to the system (Fig. 4 ). QFME showed net negative charge, and addition of mucoadhesive agent converted the system to the positive charge, as chitosan is being positively charged. Surfactant ions may be specifically adsorbed on the surface of a particle, leading, in the case of cationic surfactants, to a positively charged surface. This may be attributed to the fact that the increase in surfactant level resulted in a decrease in surface tension and surface free energy of the formed micelles. Therefore, high positive charge (cationic) of the mucoadhesive ME contributed to the good stability of the system. The formulations have low viscosity and thus make it pourable for nasal administration. Fig. 4 Zeta potential of QFMME-4
Rheological Studies
Viscosity and rheological behaviours are among the most important and noteworthy characteristics of any vehicle used for topical application within the hygienic/cosmetic field. The formulation of QFMME-4’s viscosities was measured using Brookfield stainless steel cone/plate viscometer. The rheogram of the selected formulation has been shown in Fig. 5 . As it can be seen, based on the obtained rheogram, the curve begins at the origin consequently and no part of the curve is linear, which shows non-Newtonian behaviour. Since, the viscosity decreases with increasing rate of shear (shear-thinning system), selected formulation QFMME-4 shows the pseudoplastic rheological behaviour. This is a desirable behaviour for nasal drug delivery systems, since the formulation could remain stable following the preparation and packaging within the container and then could break down as a result of shearing stresses instilled during exit from the container and spreading on the nasal surface [ ]. Fig. 5 Rheogram of the formulation QFMME-4, showing the presence of a pseudoplastic behaviour
Transmission Electron Microscopy
The TEM images revealed that globule size was in nanometric range and that the globules had nearly spherical morphology (Fig. 6 ). A percentage transmittance of 99.9 ± 2.14 for QFME indicated clear dispersion, whereas for QFMME, it was slight hazy due to the presence of mucoadhesive polymer component in the formulation. Fig. 6 TEM image of optimized microemulsion (QMME-4)
Gelation Study and Gel Strength
It is the temperature at which the liquid phase makes a transition to gel. A gelation temperature range suitable for thermoreversible nasal gel would be 30–36 °C. Gelation point was considered as the temperature where formulations would not flow when test tubes were tilted to 90° angle, as the temperature was gradually increased. Table 6 shows the results of gelation study. Batch QFMME-4 shows good gelation which also remains for extended period of time because it contains more amount of Pluronic F127. In the selection of the concentration of the gelling polymer, a compromise is sought between satisfactory gel strength for use as a delivery vehicle and an acceptable viscosity for ease of spraying. The batch QFMME-4 has both the criteria in satisfactory range. All the formulations, either in solution or in gel, showed pseudo plastic behaviour [ , ].

Estimation of Mucoadhesive Strength
The adhesiveness of the QF developed formulations is summarized in Table 7 . It was observed that the mucoadhesive strength of the final formulation QFMME-4 was more than all the remaining QF formulations because of the presence of more percentage of mucoadhesive polymer chitosan and gelling polymer Pluronic. These results indicate that the formulation possessed sufficient mucoadhesiveness and to adhere to nasal mucosa upon administration. QFMME-4 was able to increase residence time of the formulation on nasal mucosal surface which was attributing due to 0.3 % Pluronic F127 and 0.2 % of chitosan. Chitosan is indeed a well-recognized and widely used mucoadhesive polymer, known for its mucoadhesion properties. It interacts with mucus and biological surfaces through hydrogen bonding of the ionized carbonyl functionalities. Because of their mucoadhesive properties, the chitosan has been investigated in nasal dosage forms for the enhancement of intranasal bioavailability [ ].

In Vitro Drug Diffusion Study
Figure 7 shows the in vitro diffusion of QF from different formulation through the dialysis membrane. In this figure, QF released from formulations QFMME, QFME and QF Sol was compared. It can be seen that drugs released from different formulations are not same. As can be seen in this figure, nearly 42 % of the drug content of the QFMME was released in 4 h. On the contrary, formulation QFME and QF Sol shows almost 100 % drug released within 4 and 1.5 h, respectively. Statistical analysis of the release profiles obtained among formulations shows significant difference between the results obtained ( p ˂ 0.05). Therefore, among all the formulations, only QFMME formulation could control the drug for extended period of time due to the presence of mucoadhesive polymer chitosan. Fig. 7 In vitro diffusion study of QF formulations
Ex Vivo Permeation Study
The results of ex vivo permeation study suggested that almost 100 % of the drug was permeated at the end of 10 h (Fig. 8 ) which indicated a very high amount of drug reaching the brain and a potential improvement in the bioavailability of QF. Initially, a higher amount of drug was released because the drug was not entrapped within the globules and may be localized at the interface between oil globules and the aqueous portion. The highest diffusion of QF was observed because it contains highest concentration of mucoadhesive polymer chitosan. Because of mucoadhesion, the residence time inside the nasal cavity was increased and also increased the drug absorption. The QFMME-4 exhibited higher diffusion due to the presence of mucoadhesive agent that, probably due to its intrinsic character, tends to adhere to mucosa, thereby causing increased contact and, hence, increased diffusion. The present results suggest that anionic polyelectrolytic polymer chitosan enhances the action of the lipophilic permeation enhancer Peceol and that the combination of Peceol and chitosan as a coenhancer can be a useful tool to improve the membrane permeability in the nasal delivery of lipophilic drugs using ME as drug delivery system [ , ].

Nasal Cilia Toxicity
Mucociliary clearance contributes to the body’s primary non-specific defence mechanism by propelling potentially hazardous substances such as dust, microorganisms, allergens and carcinogens towards the pharynx where they are swallowed or expectorated. If the normal mucociliary clearance was inhibited, patients would suffer extensively from chronic respiratory infections. These consequences emphasize that the constituents of preparations intended for nasal delivery should not adversely affect the clearance system, especially in the chronic therapy. Therefore, a requirement in formulation development is no nasal mucosal irritation from the microemulsion. Optical microscopic results show that the nasal mucosa treated with PBS (pH 6.4, negative control) showed no sign of inflammation, erosion and nasociliary damage and the nasal membrane remained intact, whereas an extensive damage to nasal mucosa coupled with loss of nasal cilia could be observed with positive control. There were a great number of cilia with fast rate beating on the edge of mucosa that was treated with QFMME-4 for 1 h (Fig. 9 ), and the same phenomenon was observed when the contact time was extended up to 4 h, indicating that QFMME- 4 had no obvious effect on the cilia movement, which substantiating the safety of the excipients used in the formulation. Thus, formulation components can be considered to be biocompatible and do not induce serious histological changes in the nasal mucosa [ , ]. Fig. 9 Optical microscopic images of a cilia on nasal mucosa without any treatment, b negative control (phosphate buffer saline pH 6.4, cilia on the mucosa was intact, dense and beat actively 1 h after treatment), c QFMME-4 (similar phenomenon with that of saline was visualized 1 h after treatment) and d positive control (1 % isopropyl alcohol solution, no cilia on the mucosa was observed but a few exfoliated cilia 5 min after treatment). Cilia are indicated by a rrow (10× 40 magnification, n = 4–5)
In Vivo Pharmacokinetic Studies
In vivo pharmacokinetic studies were performed in rats that remained conscious during the experiment. This conscious state may support the maintenance of functional mucociliary clearance during the whole process. The pharmacokinetic profile after intranasal administration of QFMME-4 was compared with intravenous, oral and intranasal (solution) administration. The corresponding pharmacokinetic parameters and bioavailability values of QF are presented in Table 8 . After dose normalization, the bioavailability of QFMME-4 (89.54 %) was higher than those of oral (9.0 %) or intranasal (solution type, 26.65 %) administration. The T max of QFMME-4 (2 min) was comparable to that of the intranasal solution group (2 min) and shorter than that for oral administration (35 min). The microemulsion system developed demonstrated enhanced bioavailability compared with the oral and intranasal (solution) groups and significantly rapid onset compared with the oral administration group. The low bioavailability of QF after oral administration may be associated with hepatic and/or intestinal first-pass effects, not an absorption problem in the intestinal tract. Intranasal administration can avoid these first-pass effects and guarantee improved bioavailability compared with oral administration. Moreover, the microemulsion formulation (QFMME-4) for intranasal delivery achieved a higher bioavailability of QF than did a solution, coinciding with the result of in vitro permeation. It can be concluded that drug absorption-enhancing effect of the microemulsion led to improvement in bioavailability. In particular, the microemulsion system developed provided rapid onset of action and improved bioavailability. This QF-loaded microemulsion system may be an effective intranasal dosage form for patients suffering from schizophrenia and bipolar disorder [ ].

Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra of QF and QFMME are shown in Fig. 10 . An FTIR spectrum of pure QF shows principal peaks at wave numbers 3400.21, 2300.27 and 1591.07 cm −1 . The FTIR spectra of the QFMME had all the characteristic peak and band values of pure QF that all the functional groups of QF are well preserved. This study clearly indicates absence of any chemical interaction between the drug (QF) and the polymers (Pluronic F127 and chitosan) in final formulation, thus confirming that the drug is compatible with all the polymers used in the present investigation [ ]. Fig. 10 Infrared spectra of a quetiapine fumarate (QF) and b drug-loaded mucoadhesive microemulsion (QFMME-4)
Differential Scanning Calorimetry
DSC thermograms of pure QF and QFMME are shown in Fig. 11 . The DSC thermogram of QF exhibited a single sharp endothermic peak at 177.06 °C corresponding to its melting point. The melting endothermic peak of QF is shifted to 173.91 °C in the QFMME. The presence of polymer affects the peak shape, and intensity of the drugs leads to lowering of purity. Hence, the minor changes observed in peak values of drugs are not indication of any potential incompatibility.

Release Kinetic Modelling
In order to predict and correlate the ex vivo QF permeation behaviour from QFMME through nasal mucosal membrane, the permeation data were evaluated kinetically using various mathematical models. The results of the curve fitting into these above-mentioned models are described in the Table 9 . In this selected microemulsion formulation, the calculated regression coefficients for zero-order, first-order, Higuchi models, Hixson–Crowell and Korsmeyer–Peppas model were 0.768, 0.897, 0.928, 0.965 and 0.997, respectively. When respective correlation coefficients were compared, it was found that it followed the Korsmeyer–Peppas model ( R 2 = 0.997), over a period of 10 h, as a best fit amongst all other models investigated. Again, the Korsmeyer–Peppas model was employed in the Ex vivo QF permeation behaviour analysis of this formulation to find out permeation mechanisms: Fickian (non-steady) diffusional release when n ≤ 0.5, case-II transport (zero-order) when n ≥ 1 and non-Fickian “anomalous” release when the value of n is between 0.5 and 1 [ ]. The determined value of diffusion exponent ( n ) is 0.693. These results indicated that the drug permeation from QFMME followed the non-Fickian, anomalous mechanism.

Stability Studies
In stability studies, the ME exhibited no precipitation of drug, creaming, phase separation and flocculation on visual observation and was found to be stable after centrifugation. The results of stability studies (Table 10 ) showed that there are negligible changes ( P > 0.05) in the parameters such as pH, viscosity, globule size, assay, % transmittance and zeta potential of QFMME-4 after 6 months of storage, thus substantiating the stability of ME for 6 months.

Conclusion
Microemulsion systems consisting of Peceol, Tween 20, Transcutol P and water showed high solubilization capacities for QF. The development of optimized in situ nasal gelling systems of mucoadhesive microemulsion formulations containing Pluronic F127, chitosan and QF was confirmed in pseudo-ternary phase diagrams, and their physicochemical properties were characterized. The formulation was found to be physically stable for 6 months at ambient conditions. In vitro and ex vivo studies showed the drug release up to 10 h with a burst release at 30 min. The burst release was due to incorporation of Pluronics, and the prolonged release up to 10 h was attributed to the mucoadhesives used in the formulation. In vivo pharmacokinetic studies in rats showed higher plasma concentrations of QF from in situ gelling mucoadhesive microemulsion as compared to other formulation with increase in bioavailability. Hence, this can be viewed as a viable alternative to conventional nasal drops by virtue of its ability to enhance nasal residence time and thereby intranasal bioavailability. The ease of administration coupled with its ability to provide sustained release could probably result in less-frequent administration, thus enhancing patient compliance. It can be concluded from this study that this formulation strategy may be tried for effective targeting of other therapeutic entities to CNS which are reported to have low bioavailability and poor brain penetration.
