Highlights
Atrial fibrillation (AF) patients with thrombocytopenia requiring anticoagulation are often undertreated due to bleeding concerns. Patients with thrombocytopenia were excluded from major clinical trials that investigated non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) for stroke prevention in AF. Clinical data on the use of NOACs for stroke prevention in AF patients with thrombocytopenia are scarce. In AF patients with thrombocytopenia, NOAC therapy provided a trend toward better safety and equivalent effectiveness compared with warfarin therapy. Further studies comparing safety and effectiveness between NOAC and warfarin therapies in AF patients with other clinical situations associated with increased bleeding risks are needed.
Introduction
The need for anticoagulant therapy in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients with thrombocytopenia is increasing in our aging society [ , ]. Thrombocytopenia is associated with an increased risk of bleeding, but is not associated with a lower risk of thromboembolism [ , , , , , ]. There are clinical scenarios in which physicians have to make decisions on anticoagulant therapy in thrombocytopenic patients at high thromboembolic risks such as AF patients with a high CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score. The use of anticoagulant in treating these patients represents a major challenge in clinical practice.
Non-vitamin-K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC) represents a major advance in stroke prevention for patients with AF, offering an equally effective and safer treatment compared with warfarin [ , , , ]. The NOACs are generally more convenient for adjusting the dosing regimen due to less variation across individuals, fewer drug–drug and drug–food interactions compared with warfarin [ ]. However, major trials of the four NOACs have excluded patients with moderate thrombocytopenia [ , , , , ]. In addition, according to present treatment guidelines, there is no recommendation for anticoagulation in AF patients with thrombocytopenia [ , , ]. Hence, the aim of the present study was to compare the effectiveness and safety of NOAC therapy versus warfarin therapy in preventing stroke in AF patients with thrombocytopenia.
Methods
Data source
In this retrospective cohort study, patient data were obtained from Chang Gung Medical Foundation (CGMF), which comprises three major teaching hospitals and four tertiary-care medical centers in Taiwan. The CGMH has more than 10,000 beds and admits more than 280,000 patients each year. In 2015, outpatient department visits and emergency department visits to CGMF exceeded 8,500,000 and 500,000, respectively, approximately 1/10 of the Taiwanese medical service annually [ ]. The hospital identification number of each patient was encrypted and de-identified to protect their privacy. Therefore informed consent was waived for this study. The diagnoses and laboratory data could be linked and continuously monitored using consistent data encryption. The institutional review board of CGMF approved the study protocol.
Study population
From 2010 to 2017, 50,035 patients diagnosed with AF (ICD-9 427.31 or ICD-10 I48.0, I48.1, I48.2, I48.91) were identified. Among these patients, 25,076 patients had at least one prescription filled for oral anticoagulation therapy following AF diagnosis. Anticoagulation therapy was defined as using warfarin or NOACs (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban). The index date was defined as the first date of prescribing NOAC or warfarin. Patients were allowed to use warfarin before initiating treatment with NOACs. Patients were excluded if they had deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism within the 6 months before the index day (n = 1040), received joint (n = 254) or a heart-valve replacement (n = 653) within the 6 months before the index date, had end-stage renal disease before the index date (n = 2331), had ischemic stroke (IS), systemic embolism (SE), or death within the 7 days after the index date (n = 3799), were under 65 years of age (n = 5444), or did not have data on platelet count within the 2 years before the index date (n = 3316). Finally, 8239 patients were eligible for this study and were divided into two subgroups: patients with a normal platelet count (n = 7872, 95.5%) and those with thrombocytopenia (n = 367, 4.5%), which was defined as a platelet count less than 100 × 10 3 /µL [ , , , ]. The study design flowchart and patient enrollment are shown in Fig. 1 . The risks of IS/SE, major bleeding, and death were compared between NOAC therapy and warfarin therapy in anticoagulated AF patients with a normal platelet count and those with thrombocytopenia, respectively.

Covariates
Baseline comorbidities of the study cohort include hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic liver disease, chronic kidney disease, cancer, and past history of heart failure, myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack, IS, SE, bleeding, coronary bypass, and percutaneous coronary intervention. Laboratory data include serum hemoglobin, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), liver function tests, and lipid profiles. Baseline medications were identified from medical records within 180 days of initiating oral anticoagulants, including anti-platelets, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, statins, amiodarone, digoxin, and proton pump inhibitors.
Clinical outcomes
The efficacy endpoint was the occurrence of IS/SE. The safety endpoint was the occurrence of major bleeding or death. Major bleeding was defined as clinically overt bleeding associated with a greater than 2 g/dL fall in hemoglobin or requiring a transfusion of more than two units of packed red blood cells or whole blood, fatal bleeding, or intracranial hemorrhage during the period of drug use or within the 14 days after the last day of drug use. The follow-up period was defined as the period from the index date until the first occurrence of any study outcome or the end date of the study period (December 31, 2017), whichever came first. Patients who changed oral anticoagulants were censored 14 days following their switch in treatment. If an event or death occurred within the 14 days following a switch, the event and time were ascribed to the initial therapy. The diagnostic codes used to identify the study outcomes and the baseline covariates are summarized in Online Supplement Table 1.
Statistical analysis
Data were presented as the mean and standard deviation, or median and interquartile range for continuous variables, and proportions for categorical variables. Differences between continuous values were assessed using Wilcoxon’s rank-sum test. Differences between nominal variables were compared with a Chi square test. We calculated crude incidence as the number of events divided by 100 person-years. A Cox proportional hazard regression with time-dependent covariates was used to compare event rates between NOAC and warfarin therapies in patients with a normal platelet count and those with thrombocytopenia, respectively. To compare risks of IS/SE, major bleeding, and death between NOAC and warfarin therapies, the analyses were adjusted for age, sex, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, cancer, history of myocardial infarction, history of ischemic heart disease, history of SE, history of peripheral vascular disease, history of transient ischemic attack, history of stroke, history of heart failure, statins, amiodarone, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, anti-platelets, digoxin, and proton pump inhibitors. All analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina).
Sensitivity analysis
First, we compared the outcomes of switching drugs using 7 days as a censoring window. We performed this analysis to assess whether the primary findings would be affected by differential censoring windows between drug switches. Second, due to the high mortality risk in AF patients with thrombocytopenia, we reanalyzed the data accounting for the competing risk of death.
Results
Patient characteristics
The baseline characteristics of patients with a normal platelet count and patients with thrombocytopenia are shown in Table 1 . There was a total of 7872 patients with a normal platelet count enrolled, with a mean age of 76.9 ± 7.3 years, mean CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score of 3.9 ± 1.7, and mean HAS-BLED score of 3.1 ± 1.1. In addition, a total of 367 patients with thrombocytopenia were enrolled, with a mean age of 78.6 ± 7.5 years, mean CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score of 3.8 ± 1.6, and mean HAS-BLED score of 3.5 ± 0.9. Patients with thrombocytopenia were significantly older ( p < 0.001), had a lower hemoglobin count ( p < 0.001) and eGFR ( p = 0.015), a higher HAS-BLED score ( p < 0.001), aspartate aminotransferase ( p < 0.001), alanine aminotransferase ( p < 0.001), and total bilirubin ( p < 0.001), as well as a higher proportion of comorbidities than patients with a normal platelet count. There was, however, no significant difference in CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score between the two groups ( p = 0.38).

Patients with a normal platelet count
Table 2 (upper panel) shows the event rate per 100 person-years with the 95% confidence interval (CI) of outcomes associated with types of oral anticoagulants in AF patients with a normal platelet count. In these patients, the event rates per 100 person-years were 3.16 and 3.94 for IS/SE, 4.10 and 8.26 for major bleeding, and 3.41 and 3.12 for death, in the NOAC and warfarin groups, respectively. NOAC therapy (n = 4904) versus warfarin therapy (n = 2968) was associated with a significantly lower risk of major bleeding (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.54, 95% CI 0.44–0.67; p < 0.001), and there was no significant difference in the risk of IS/SE (aHR 0.88, 95% CI 0.71–1.08; p = 0.23) or death (aHR 1.08, 95% CI 0.90–1.29; p = 0.43).

Patients with thrombocytopenia
Table 2 (lower panel) shows the event rate per 100 person-years of adverse outcomes associated with oral anticoagulant type in AF patients with thrombocytopenia. In these patients, the event rates per 100 person-years were 3.44 and 3.04 for IS/SE, 4.72 and 11.62 for major bleeding, and 5.79 and 4.63 for death, in the NOAC and warfarin groups, respectively. Compared with warfarin therapy (n = 186), NOAC therapy (n = 181) was associated with a lower tendency for major bleeding (aHR 0.45, 95% CI 0.16–1.14; p = 0.14) with similar risks for IS/SE (aHR 0.94, 95% CI 0.29–2.91; p = 0.91), and death (aHR 0.95, 95% CI 0.46–1.95; p = 0.90). The results were similar for IS/SE and major bleeding when death was treated as a competing risk factor in the Cox model (Table 2 ). We reanalyzed the data by using 7 days as a censoring window for drug switches and found similar results as using 14 days as a censoring window for drug switches (Online Supplement Table 2).
Discussion
This is the largest study comparing the outcomes between NOAC and warfarin users in AF patients with thrombocytopenia. Our study showed that in these patients, NOAC therapy was associated with a lower tendency for major bleeding without any difference in IS/SE and death compared with warfarin therapy.
Thrombocytopenic patients with AF requiring anticoagulation are often undertreated due to bleeding concerns [ ]. Recommendations from the guidelines on anticoagulant therapy for thrombocytopenic patients are currently lacking due to limited data on the safety and efficacy of anticoagulation in these patients. The protective effect of warfarin against thrombotic events has been shown in a retrospective study of 137 thrombocytopenic patients [ ]. Warfarin therapy in such patients was associated with an increased risk of minor bleeding, but no difference in major bleeding compared to those without thrombocytopenia [ ].
Clinical data on the use of NOACs in patients with thrombocytopenia are scarce. Patients have been largely excluded from randomized controlled trials of NOACs if moderate thrombocytopenia was present. The ROCKET AF trial excluded patients with a platelet count less than 90 × 10 3 /µL [ ]. RE-LY, ARISTOTLE, ENGAGE AF, AVERROES, and AMPLIFY trials excluded patients with a platelet equal or less than 100 × 10 3 /µL, which was used as the criteria for thrombocytopenia in the present study [ , , , , ]. Since these major NOAC trials excluded patients with thrombocytopenia, data regarding NOAC therapy in patients with thrombocytopenia are restricted to small cohort studies or case reports [ , , ]. Rivaroxaban has been used to treat a thrombogenic condition in 22 patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and appears to effectively prevent recurrent or new thrombosis; further, it is safe, with only one in 22 patients (4.5%) experiencing major bleeding [ ]. Similar outcomes in smaller numbers of patients were also observed with apixaban (n = 12) and dabigatran (n = 11) [ ]. A recent study compared the safety and efficacy associated with NOAC therapy between 62 thrombocytopenic patients and 62 age- and sex-matched patients without thrombocytopenia [ ]. No significant differences in the risks of major bleeding, IS or transient ischemic attack, and death were observed between the two groups [ ]. The favorable experiences with NOACs in these studies support our findings in AF patients with thrombocytopenia. For stroke prevention in AF patients with thrombocytopenia, our results suggest that NOAC therapy may be an equally effective and probably safer alternative oral anticoagulant than warfarin therapy.
The strengths of our study include using a well-defined large population sample, available baseline hemoglobin, platelet count, liver function, and renal function prior to initiating anticoagulant therapy, and a direct comparison of NOAC and warfarin therapies in patients with a normal platelet count and those with thrombocytopenia. To our knowledge, this is the largest study to date evaluating the use of NOACs versus warfarin in AF patients with thrombocytopenia.
Limitations
This study had several limitations. First, miscoding and misclassification are potential biases in an established database that relies on physician-reported diagnoses. However, such miscoding and misclassification is highly unlikely to differ systematically between patients with a normal platelet count and those with thrombocytopenia. The finding of equally effective and safer profiles for NOAC versus warfarin in patients with a normal platelet count was comparable to the results of meta-analyses and real-world data [ , , , , ]. Second, since this study was a retrospective data analysis rather than a randomized trial, the bias and unmeasured confounders were possible despite the statistical adjustment. Third, the chance of discontinuation or absence of anticoagulant therapy secondary to bleeding events and a low platelet count could affect our study results. Fourth, our study results were derived from uniform ethnicity in Taiwan. Further studies are required to generalize the current findings to other populations.
Conclusion
In AF patients with thrombocytopenia, NOAC therapy provides a trend toward better safety and equivalent efficacy profiles compared with warfarin therapy.
