Introduction
Coronary heart disease (CHD) and diabetes mellitus (DM) are major causes of mortality and morbidity in the world, also are serious threat to human health [ ]. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have a two- to four-fold increase in the risk of CHD [ , ]. Platelets of CHD and T2DM patients exhibited a higher tendency to aggregate when stimulated with agonists, and were more likely to occur thrombosis during pathological progress compared to healthy individuals. The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines recommend dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) for the prevention of atherothrombotic events (2016) [ ]. There are still partial patients suffered from thrombosis, and some even bleeding even if antiplatelet agents are used to inhibit platelet reactivity.
Activation and aggregation of platelets play a critical role in thrombosis [ ]. Platelet surface is covered with abundant glycoproteins, like GPIb/IX/V, the integrin GPIIb/IIIa, which are associated with binding to von Willebrand factor (vWF) and fibrinogen, respectively. Platelet carbohydrate contains the form of N- and O-glycosidically linked carbohydrate chains, such as 60% sugar in extracellular domain of GPIb [ ]. However, the importance of glycosylation to platelet functions is still poorly understood. Carew et al. [ ] constructed particular Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells by transfecting to obtain recombinant vWF specifically lacking O-linked glycan. They exhibited that vWF deficient in O-linked glycosylation was able to interaction with platelets in the presence of heparin and collagen and botrocetin, but decreased capacity to GPIb, in the presence of moderate amounts of ristocetin. Schulte et al. [ ] also supported the concept that human vWF-A1 domains with T705A mutation (O-linked glycosylation sites of vWF-A1-domains) probably shielded or fluctuated the binding site for GPIb, thereby losing their potentiality of aggregatory. Abnormal glycosylation of vWF affects the interaction with GPIb, and may also occur in platelet. Recent study used Cosmc -disrupted mice with expressing truncated O-glycan to evaluated the biogenesis and function of platelet with deficient O-glycosylation, which exhibited reduced interaction of vWF with GPIb and limited ability to activated integrin αIIbβ3 by agonist binding to fibrinogen [ ]. Desialylation may be the major cause which leads an increased for thrombosis and enhance platelet reactivity in patients with PMM2-CDG, a disease of congenital disorder of N-glycosylation [ ]. These evidences show unequivocally that carbohydrate may have a significant effect on platelet morphology and function.
Platelets have an increasingly well-defined critical role in cardiovascular diseases, and may also play a role in the pathogenesis of the underlying atherosclerotic process [ ]. However, few studies have been published on the relationship between platelets glycosylation and vascular disease. Therefore, the aim of this study is to detect the patterns and levels of platelet glycosylation in patients with CHD or T2DM and healthy controls using lectin-based assay by flow cytometry and to investigate the alternation of platelet glycosylation in vascular disease.

Platelet glycosylation assay
In this study, the detection method of platelet glycosylation was modified based on Gupta’s study [ ] to applicable our laboratory. Washed platelets were obtained from whole blood as the following steps. Firstly, Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) were isolated by centrifugation at 230× g for 7 min at RT in a BY 320A centrifuge (Hebei, China) and then added 4% PFA to PRP in order to fix platelets at a final concentration of 1%. Secondly, PRP was washed for twice at 300 × g for 5 min at RT. Finally, Platelet pellet was resuspended in 2 ml PBS buffer (Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ , pH 7.4) and final concentration was adjusted to ~ 1 × 10 5 cells/μl. To avoid platelet activation caused by centrifugation and washing steps in vitro, 1% paraformaldehyde (final concentration) was used to fix platelets, and platelet activation levels (P-Selectin and activated integrin GPIIb/IIIa) were evaluated by flow cytometry. Platelets were used in lectin-binding experiments only if CD62P and PAC-1 levels were 0–3 and 0–8%, respectively, that indicated washing did not activated platelet in vitro and the level of glycan was consistent with that in vivo [ ].
Aliquots of 45 μl washed platelets were incubated with 5 μl of CD61-PerCP and 5 μl of FITC-conjugated lectin (final concentration 20 μg/ml) for 20 min at RT in dark without agitation. Then the sample was added with 0.5 ml PBS buffer to stop the reaction. The patterns and levels of platelet glycosylation were measured on freshly washed platelets by flow cytometry (FACS Calibur, Becton Dickson, USA). The forward and side scatter light signal on platelets were used to set gate. The levels of binding lectin are analyzed after collecting 10,000 platelets and reported as the geometric mean fluorescence intensity (GMFI) of lectin subtracted the GMFI of isotype.
Platelet activation
The activation was detected in resting and stimulated platelets. For resting platelet activation, 5 μl whole blood were incubated with 5 μl CD61-PerCP, CD62P-PE and PAC-1-FITC. For stimulated platelet, platelets activation was measured by 5 μl CD62P-PE and PAC-1-FITC and added with 10 μl of ADP (final concentration, 10 μg/ml) and 70 μl PBS buffer containing 1 mM Calcium buffer. Platelets were identified by labeling samples with anti-CD61. All samples were incubated in dark for 20 min at RT and then added with 0.5 ml PBS buffer with or without 1 mM Calcium buffer, as required, and analyzed on flow cytometry. The levels of platelets activation were expressed as the percentage of CD62P or PAC-1 positive platelets.
Platelet aggregation assay
Platelet aggregation was measured on PRP by light transmission aggregometry (LTA) in a PRECIL LBY-NJ4 (Beijing, China). Aliquots of 0.3 ml PRP (~ 3 × 10 5 /μl) added into the cuvette and stirred with a magnetic bead with induction by adenosine diphosphate (ADP, 3 μg/ml) or arachidonic acid (AA, 5 μM). The maximal amplitude (%) was monitored for up to 5 min in response to agonists and which was as equal as ADP- or AA-induced maximal aggregation [ ].
Statistical analysis
The data was performed using SPSS 20.0 statistics package software (IBM, New York, USA) for statistical analysis. Quantitative data were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) for normal contribution data, or median and quartiles for non-normal contribution data. Data for homogeneity of variance are compared by ANOVE test. Data for non-homogeneity of variance and non-normal contribution are compared by Kruskal–Wall Test. Spearman correlation test was used to evaluate the correlation between different indicators. The level of significance was set at P value < 0.05 using two-tailed tests.

Totally 157 participants were enrolled in the study and characteristics of the patient groups was shown in Table 2 . The healthy controls comprised 23 males and 32 females aged 20–53 years. Levels of platelet counts were similar among CHD patients, T2DM patients and controls, but lower in CHD + T2DM. The patients group had a higher level of glucose, triglycerides and a lower level of HDL-cholesterol than the controls group.

Patterns and levels of platelet glycosylation
Patterns and levels of platelet glycosylation were shown in Fig. 1 and Table 3 . The binding to platelets of RCAI and SNA, specific for β-galactose (β-Gal) and 2,6-sialic acid respectively, were significantly decreased in patient subgroups compared with healthy controls. In CHD group, SWGA showed a significant increase in binding to platelets β- N -acetylglucosamine (β-GlcNAc) compared with the control group. In T2DM group, the binding of AAL and DSL, specific for α1,6-fucose and GlcNAc respectively, significantly increased and ConA, a lectin specific for α-mannose, showed a significant decrease. There were observed an increase significantly in the levels of AAL, DSL, ECL (specific for Gal), SWGA and decrease significantly in the binding of ConA in CHD + T2DM group. The binding of DBA, specific for N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), showed negative among patient subgroups, so did the healthy control. The above results suggested that there were differences of platelet glycosylation patterns in physiological and pathological conditions.

Platelet activation
Compared with healthy controls, there were significantly decreased in expression of CD62P and PAC-1 on ADP-stimulated platelets of CHD patients and CHD + T2DM patients, while no significant differences on resting platelet. The treatment of antiplatelet agents provides a reasonable explanation for the change. In addition, the expression of CD62P and PAC-1 in T2DM patient were higher than healthy controls, but no significant differences on resting platelets, consistent with literature reports. For stimulating, no significant differences were observed between T2DM group and healthy controls in the levels of CD62P and PAC-1 on ADP-stimulated platelets (Fig. 2 a; Table 4 ).

Platelets aggregation
Platelet aggregation data was depicted as in Fig. 2 b and Table 4 . ADP- and AA-induced platelet aggregation were significantly decreased in CHD group and CHD + T2DM group compared with healthy controls. The most likely explanation is the application of antiplatelet drugs, which conforms with the effect of antiplatelet therapy. However, no significant differences were observed between T2DM group and control group with regard to ADP- and AA-induced platelet aggregation. There were significant differences in ADP- and AA-induced platelet aggregation between CHD group and T2DM group, so did between T2DM group and CHD + T2DM group.
Correlation between platelet glycosylation and function
To further evaluated the relationship of platelet glycosylation and other markers, including activation markers CD62P and PAC-1, HbA1c and glucose, the correlation was analyzed. A representative scatter plot of correlation analysis showed as in Fig. 3 . In the control group, there were significant negative correlation among four lectins and platelet activation markers on resting platelets, including CD62P with ECL (r = − 0.532, p < 0.000), RCAI (r = − 0.546, p < 0.001), ConA (r = − 0.471, p < 0.001), SWAG (r = − 0.401, p = 0.002), and PAC-1 with ECL (r = − 0.483, p < 0.001), RCAI (r = − 0.503, p < 0.001), ConA (r = − 0.401, p = 0.002), SWAG (r = − 0.370, p = 0.005). In the CHD group, there was a negative correlation between CD62P and ECL (r = − 0.500, p = 0.029). In the T2DM group, there were significant correlation among PAC-1 and ECL (r = − 0.487, p = 0.009), SNA (r = 0.475, p = 0.012), ConA (r = 0.432, p = 0.042).

Discussion
Glycosylation is one of the important processes for post-translational modification and plays a fundamental role in protein function, cell physiology, intra- and intercellular signaling [ ]. Some researches demonstrated that abnormal glycosylation is related to some disorders. Increased galactosylation and sialylation in IgG is related to enhance inflammatory properties, so did fucosylation decreased or deficient [ ]. Recent researches also revealed that there were significantly related between glycosylation changes and platelet features in thrombocytopenia [ , ]. The researcher analyzed platelet surface glycosylation and found that platelet glycosylation patterns are agonist-specific. The findings suggested that the mechanism underlying agonist-induced platelet surface glycosylation changes and might be caused by different signaling pathways through which various agonists activate [ ]. Our study characterized the patterns and levels of platelet glycosylation in patients with CHD or T2DM based on the property of lectin binding to specific carbohydrates, which might be a plausible explanation for the abnormal platelet reactivity in pathological and high-risk thrombosis, contributing to application of antiplatelet drugs and prevention of thrombosis.
In the following, we relate platelet glycosylation changes to platelet reactivity in vascular disease such as CHD and T2DM. Platelet are covered with a coat of carbohydrates that combined with particular lectins could be as specific as the interaction between those of antigen and antibody. There are nine mainly mono-saccharides, including galactose (Gal), mannose (Man), fucose (Fuc), sialic acid (SA), glucose (Glc), N -acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), N -acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), glucuronic acid (GlcA) and xylose (Xyl) that can be assembled to hundreds of different glycan structures in the Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum [ ]. According to oligosaccharide structures and literatures, eight fluorescently labelled lectins with known specificities, as shown in Table 1 , were used to profile changes in platelet surface glycosylation [ , ]. We found that platelet surface weakly expressed β-Gal and 2,6-sialic acid in patients with CHD. Abnormal sialylation has been found to be one of critical roles in tumors and thrombocytopenia [ ]. Endothelial dysfunction is responsible for the formation of atherosclerosis and is a common feature of CHD and T2DM [ ]. Moreover, platelet adhesion and activation are highly related with vascular endothelial cell injury. In addition, galactose and sialic acid might affect the binding to FcγR and thus affect immune response [ ]. Actually, desialylation could accelerate the clearance ratio of platelet from circulation [ ], while covered β-GlcNAc and increase galacosylation of platelet could slow down or hinder the clearance ratio [ ]. It was reported that platelet contain lower level of sialic acid in patients with CHD compared to controls, which could represent a contributing factor for the higher reactivity of these platelets, and may also be a prognostic marker in CHD patients [ ]. We speculated that vascular endothelial dysfunction might highly relate to the expression of platelet surface 2,6-sialic acid, and abnormal sialylation and galacosylation may participate in inflammatory response of CHD and T2DM patient.
We also observed that there was strongly expressed β- GlcNAc in CHD patients. Several studies have suggested that O -GlcNAcylation induced by endothelin-1 may interfere with vascular processes and vascular reactivity [ ], and O-GlcNAcylation plays a complex role in the normal regulation of the cardiovascular system, an aspect of increased O-GlcNAc link to diabetic complications and the other aspect of cardioprotective in acute activation of O-GlcNAcylation [ ]. These data provide a support for the idea that platelet glycosylation of GlcNAc have a close relation with vascular disease and regulate vascular processes in patients with CHD.
The observation of lectins binding to platelet of β-Gal, 2,6-sialic acid were decreased in patients with T2DM, consistent with the observation in CHD patients. In addition, the levels of α1,6-fucose and GlcNAc were increased compared with healthy controls. Fucose could directly regulates antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity, growth factor receptor and adhesion molecule activity [ ], while decreased or absence of fucose enhanced inflammatory properties [ ]. However, we detected the level of fucose in platelet surface was elevated in T2DM patients. Inflammatory response does play a critical role in the progression of T2DM. Consequently, alternation in level of fucose on platelet surface cannot be simply interpreted as either good or bad in vascular disease. There may be required more research and data to explain this problem.
Moreover, the expression of platelet surface α-mannose was greatly reduced in T2DM patients. Recent findings proposed core mannose is important in glycolimmunological processes [ ]. Mannose expressed on the surfaces of pathogenic micro-organism could be recognized by a liver-derived serum protein, mannose binding lectin (MBL), then activated the MBL pathway in complement activation and cleared of apoptotic cells. We found it curious about the correlation between PAC-1 and the level of ConA (specific for α-mannose) that there was positive correlation in T2DM patients, while negative correlation in healthy control. The reasons of this result might be that decreased mannose on platelet surface may lead to a weakened MBL pathway, and that may be associated with increasing risk of thrombosis in T2DM patients. Simultaneously, the expression of active conformation of integrin GPIIb/IIIa had a higher level in T2DM group than control group. Recent clinical studies have suggested a close association between MBL deficiency, thrombosis and antiphospholipid antibodies [ ]. The prevalence of cardiovascular disease in SLE patients carrying MBL-deficient genotypes was 3.3 times higher than in patients with non-deficient genotypes meanwhile [ ]. It remains unclear whether the effect of mannose-meditated MBL decrease in vascular disease is regulated through this possible thrombotic mechanism, or whether platelet glycosylation is also involved in the process. Further studies are clearly warranted.
It is interesting that the patterns and levels of platelet glycosylation in CHD + T2DM patients are a combination of both CHD patients and T2DM patients, in addition, the level of ECL highly elevated (specific for β-Gal). Lectins of RCAI and ECL are used to label galactose in many reports, unfortunately the change trend of these two lectins are not conform to the expectation in our study. It may be due to various affinity of RCAI and ECL with monovalent or multivalent glycan and also to the difference in specificity for galacose. There might be more evidence to explain this discrepancy. We also found that the level of ConA also related with HbA1c in CHD + T2DM patients without antiplatelet therapy. The reason for this observation may be explained with the above-mentioned speculation. Combined with the above observations, we conclude that abnormal platelet reactivity in vascular disease may be due in part to the changes of carbohydrates of platelet surface, and also to the patterns of platelet glycosylation.
This study is the first time to evaluate the glycosylation patterns and levels of platelet in vascular disease. The above data suggest that there is the alteration of platelet glycosylation in CHD and T2DM patients, and decrease in sialylation, mannosylation and galactosylation, while increase in fucosylation and GlcNAcylation. It is possible to explain the abnormal platelet reactivity in disorder. Moreover, some studies suggested that glycosylation site is a possible therapeutic target for disease [ , , , ]. Removal of sialic acid on the surface of breast cancer cells makes it easier to recognize and destroy by innate immune, offering a novel strategy for cancer immunotherapy [ ]. Therefore, further large cohort clinical and experimental studies are required to investigate the influence of glycosylation on platelet function and the mechanism in platelets glycosylation in vascular diseases, thus providing a support for platelet glycosylation site as a potential therapeutic target for CHD and T2DM.
Limitation
One hundred fifty-seven study population were enrolled, the sample size of patient subgroup and the conclusions were limited by young healthy individuals. A genetic epidemiology program performed by Knežević et al. [ ] indicated that glycosylation of human plasma N-glycans changes with aging were especially evident in females, mostly in association with the transition from pre-menopausal to post-menopausal age. But the relationship between glycosylation of human platelet and age is not yet clear. Due to the normal platelet life span in humans is ~ 7 days, alternation of platelet glycosylation may not be the same as human plasma glycans. In our study, age of patient population is higher compared to healthy controls, so that the results for glycosylation assay was therefore arbitrary may be some influences on results.
We did not evaluate platelet functions in CHD patients who not treated with aspirin. There are two reasons for this: firstly, the main purpose of this study is to explore whether the platelet glycosylation is abnormal changes in vascular disease, and there is no mention that antiplatelet agents such as aspirin and clopidogrel could affect platelet glycosylation in the documents. Secondly, it was a certain degree difficult to collect patients not on aspirin because CHD patients presented in hospital who are generally with a previous history or patients in critical condition couldn’t wait for study assessments to use antiplatelet drugs. But we know this is a very important issue, and perhaps could provide more information about glycosylation in no treatment patients. Expanded sample size and matched age among subgroups are the further works to investigate the influence of human platelet glycosylation.
