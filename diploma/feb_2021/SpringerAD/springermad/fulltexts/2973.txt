Introduction
Huntington disease is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by psychiatric, cognitive and motor dysfunction. The typical age of onset is during adulthood while juvenile Huntington disease (defined by an onset before age 21) is estimated to represent 5 to 7% of all Huntington disease cases [ ]. Infantile forms of juvenile Huntington disease, occurring before the age of 10, represent less than 1% of all cases. Huntington disease is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait and is due to CAG trinucleotide repeat expansions in the huntingtin gene. Larger CAG repeat sizes are associated with an earlier age at onset, with fully penetrant alleles being larger than 39 CAG repeats and juvenile Huntington presentations often associated with alleles larger than 60 repeats [ ]. The most frequently observed presenting clinical features of juvenile Huntington disease include rigidity, oral motor dysfunction, behavioral disturbance, cognitive impairment, cerebellar dysfunction, tremor and seizures [ ]. Of them, cerebellar syndrome and epilepsy are considered particularly atypical symptoms when compared to the adult-onset form.
Whereas numerous imaging studies are gradually increasing our knowledge on morphological cerebral and cerebellar changes in adult-onset Huntington disease, the juvenile form [ ] has not received as much attention, most probably because of its rarity. Prior neuroimaging studies have determined cerebral features in juvenile Huntington disease similar to those observed in adults [ , ]. The status of the cerebellum remains controversial.
As Huntington disease is a multifocal degenerative process, any imaging analysis limited to the study of a small number of structures may fail to accurately characterize the distribution and temporal course of the pathology. However, cerebral and cerebellar morphometric analyses are lacking in Huntington disease, especially in the juvenile form, despite signs of possible cerebellar dysfunction including motor incoordination and impaired gait [ , , ]. This is partly because accurate segmentation of the adult and juvenile cerebellums is challenging due to the complex anatomy [ , ]. Manual segmentation by an expert is time-consuming and may be questioned due to intra- and inter-variability biases. The use of an automatic and reliable segmentation method is preferred to analyze the cerebrum and cerebellum changes in Huntington disease [ ].
We previously reported the case of a child with an extremely early presentation of juvenile Huntington with the first symptoms noticed around age 18 months [ ]. Now we report the clinical course of this child as well as the cases of his two sisters who were subsequently diagnosed with juvenile Huntington disease with similar dramatic expansion of CAG repeats. All three children presented with ataxia with reduced cerebellar volume on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We conducted a morphometric analysis of structural MRI of these three juvenile Huntington disease patients to determine whether quantitative cerebral and cerebellar morphological metrics could provide patterns that may be of diagnostic interest.
Materials and methods
Informed written consent was obtained from legal representatives for genetic analyses in a diagnostic setting. Formal consent is not required for this type of study.
Imaging
MRI was performed on a 1.5-T unit (General Electric Signa, Boston, MA) using conventional sagittal scout images followed by contiguous coronal 3-D T1-weighted inversion recovery spoiled gradient echo pulse sequence (repetition time: 9.3 ms, echo time: 4.2 ms, flip angle: 20 ° , acquisition matrix: 240 × 240, pixel bandwidth: 122, slice thickness: 1 mm).
We performed MRI on all three affected children and 30 normal controls divided into 3 age categories (10 2-year-old male controls, 10 4-year-old female controls and 10 6-year-old female controls). These controls were randomly selected from our emergency pediatric MRI database based on age and gender. These normal controls underwent MRI for various reasons, including trauma, vomiting and headaches, and presented with normal structural brain MRI.
Image processing
Automatic segmentation of the cerebrum and cerebellum was performed with volBrain (IBIME, Valencia, Spain) and Ceres (IBIME, Valencia, Spain) online volumetry segmentation software [ , ]. Brain volume data were generated by a fully automatic process divided into a preprocessing phase to set the input images in the same geometric and intensity space as the template library and an actual segmentation phase that ended up in an accurate estimation of cerebrum and cerebellar volumes at different scales. The segmentation process has been described previously [ , ] and is made of several steps, including rough inhomogeneity corrections, affine registrations to the Montreal Neurological Institute MNI Space Fine Statistical Parametric Mapping [ ] inhomogeneity corrections, intensity normalizations, non-local intracranial cavity extractions [ ], tissue classifications, non-local hemisphere segmentations [ ], non-local subcortical structure segmentations and labelling of the different regions of interest.
Regions of interest for cerebral segmentation included cortical gray matter, subcortical white matter, caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, cerebellar cortex and brainstem. Regions of interest for cerebellar segmentation included whole cerebellar volume, cerebellar lobules: I-II, III, IV, V, VI, Crus I, Crus II, VIIb, VIIIa, VIIIb, IX and X, and cerebellar cortical thickness.
Finally, related regions of interest volumes for each patient and each control case as well as label maps were provided (Figs. 1 and 2 ). The relative structure volumes of each were defined as percent of the normal mean of the adequate age category as follows: volume of juvenile Huntington disease patient divided by the mean volume of the age-controlled normal group. The three relative volumes for each structure were then averaged to allow global comparison. Fig. 1 Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) segmentation maps in a 6-year-old girl with juvenile Huntington disease (patient 3) and in a healthy 6-year-old girl. a – c T1-weighted images (TR/TE 500/10 ms) of the patient in axial ( a ), coronal ( b ) and sagittal ( c ) planes demonstrate volume reduction of several cerebral structures. d – f T1-weighted images (TR/TE 500/10 ms) of the healthy girl in axial ( d ), coronal ( e ) and sagittal ( f ) planes demonstrate normal anatomy for comparison Fig. 2 Cerebellar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) segmentation map in a 6-year-old girl with juvenile Huntington disease (patient 3) and in healthy 6-year-old girl. a – c T1-weighted images (TR/TE 500/10 ms) of the patient in axial ( a ), coronal ( b ) and sagittal ( c ) planes demonstrate volume reduction in several cerebellar lobules. d – f T1-weighted images (TR/TE 500/10 ms) of the healthy girl in axial ( d ), coronal ( e ) and sagittal ( f ) planes demonstrate normal anatomy for comparison
Statistics
Juvenile Huntington disease segmented volumes were compared to those of age-matched controls by using a z-score and were defined as a percent of the normal mean values. The probability of normal distribution was checked by the mean of a Shapiro-Wilk test.
Results
For detailed clinical description, see supplementary information .
Proband (patient 1)
We previously described the case of a young boy with an infantile presentation of juvenile Huntington [ ]. Briefly, he presented progressive motor impairment from the age of 18 months, with ataxia and tetrapyramidal signs at the forefront. He was never able to pronounce any word. From the age of 4 years, he was bedridden with severe spasticity of all four limbs and dystonia. In addition, he presented as failure to thrive from the age of 6 months and underwent gastrostomia followed by anti-reflux surgery at the age of 5 years. He died at the age of 6½ years.
Patient 2
The younger sister of the proband presented a normal early development, including walking from the age of 14 months. Her motor skills deteriorated with ataxia and global hypotonia from the age of 24 months. Language was limited to a few words. She exhibited feeding difficulties from the age of 36 months. Her neurological condition progressively worsened with the loss of her language skills, increased ataxia and tetrapyramidal syndrome with spasticity and tendinous retractions, truncal dystonia and increased feeding difficulties requiring anti-reflux surgery and gastrostomia at the age of 6 years. From the age of 5 years, she had recurrent seizures, including two episodes of status epilepticus, the last one leading to her death at the age of 8¾ years.
Patient 3
The younger sister of patient 1 and patient 2 presented with normal early development, including walking from the age of 12 months. She developed better language skills as compared to her sister and brother. She presented with a deterioration in walking with ataxia and her first falls were noticed around the age of 24 months, as well as fluctuating dystonia. Her speech started to worsen with decreased vocabulary and dysarthria. Upon examination at the age of 6 years, dystonia was present in all four limbs, she presented with severe cerebellar ataxia and she could not walk. Her language was very limited, but she could still call her close relatives by their first names. Failure to thrive was noticed from the age of 11 months. Feeding difficulties progressively worsened and she underwent a gastrostomia at the age of 6½ years. She presented with epilepsy from the age of 5½ years. She died at the age of 7 years while bedridden, with tremor and myoclonic movements in all four limbs; epilepsy was still active despite antiepileptic drugs.
Father
The father of patients 1, 2 and 3 was diagnosed with Huntington disease at the age of 47 years. His case was also described previously [ ]. Briefly, he presented behavioral and mood changes first noticed at the age of 43 years. He presented with progressive cognitive decline leading to dementia and discrete choreic movements. Upon follow-up, he presented with a progressive cognitive decline leading to dementia and discrete choreic movements. Upon his last examination at the age of 56, he presented with discrete choreic movements and his Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale motor score was 59. He presented with rare seizures triggered by alcoholic intoxication.
Genetics
Molecular genetic analyses were performed with written informed consent from the unaffected mother. Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood using standard techniques [ , ]. The size of CAG repeats was determined as previously described [ ].
We previously reported that the father carried 43 CAG repeats as well as a normal allele with 16 CAG repeats in the huntingtin gene, and that patient 1 carried a very large heterogeneous CAG expansion (210–250), with a second allele containing 35 triplets. In patients 2 and 3, we identified a very large and heterogeneous expansion (175–200, patient 2; 120–150, patient 3) along with the same 35-CAG maternal allele (patient 2) and the other maternal allele (patient 3, 23 repeats).
Morphometric analysis of magnetic resonance imaging
We compared cerebral and cerebellar structural volumes of juvenile Huntington patients and normal controls (Tables 1 and 2 ). Three cerebral substructures (caudate nucleus, putamen and globus pallidus) demonstrated major and significant atrophy ( P <0.001 for each substructure in the three patients) using morphometric analysis, although it was not salient for patient 2 at clinical reading and was not reported. Cerebellar lobule volumes were also significantly lower in comparison to normal controls. The atrophy of cerebellum lobules, cerebellum grey matter and cerebellum cortex was significant ( P <0.001 for each substructure in the three patients) and particularly marked in lobule VIIIA and lobule VIIIB. On average, the anterior lobules (I, II, III, IV, V) were less affected than the posterior lobules (VIIA, VIIIA,VIIIB) and the flocculonodular lobe (lobule X) was the least atrophic. The relative volume of the patients’ cerebral and cerebellar structures in comparison with control subjects of the same age category are illustrated in Figs. 3 and 4 .

Discussion
We report the case of three siblings with juvenile Huntington disease, an extreme form of this disease related to a dramatic expansion in the number of CAG trinucleotides. Although CAG expansions in the huntingtin gene are commonly observed in the context of male transmissions [ ], such a large expansion, from 43 CAG to more than 100, remains exceptional [ ]. In addition, to our knowledge, recurrence of this phenomenon among three siblings has never been reported.
From a clinical point of view, the presentation of juvenile Huntington is different from the typical adult onset [ , ]. In particular, cases with an age of onset before 10 years more frequently exhibit deterioration of school performance, unsteadiness and/or falls, or behavioral changes [ ]. Speech delay may precede motor symptoms [ ]. Here, motor signs were at the forefront in all three siblings, including ataxia, which is in line with the cerebellar atrophy observed on MRI. In addition, speech delay and the deterioration of the low level of language that could be acquired were also prominent clinical features. A remarkable feature is that severe and early epilepsy was noticed in two of the three children. Seizures are considered to be rare in typical adult-onset Huntington disease, especially during the first years following initial symptoms. On the contrary, epilepsy has been reported as a possible presenting phenotype in juvenile Huntington disease [ ]. Remarkably, the first objective sign was a failure to thrive in all three children. This clinical feature has already been observed in adult-onset forms and was associated with larger CAG repeat expansions [ ]. However, it is rarely noticed as a presenting sign, although nonspecific.
Given the striking reduced cerebellar volume in all three siblings, we aimed to apply an objective method to quantify and compare the volume of both cerebral and cerebellar substructures on MRI. Manual segmentation is time-consuming and may be unreliable when analyzing small and complex structures. Semiautomatic methods offering brain structure segmentation have been developed. These methods intend to reduce the time required by a human rater while keeping the manual delineation. The choice of the segmentation algorithm needs to be done carefully, particularly when considering segmenting the cerebellum. For instance, conventional whole-brain voxel-based morphometry methods are commonly used to assess the brain structure [ ] but have been shown to be suboptimal for cerebellar imaging [ ]. Cerebellar segmentation may be particularly vulnerable to inaccurate normalization, given the considerable cerebellar variability between individuals and the relatively small sizes of cerebellar subdivisions [ , ]. The CERES algorithm used in our study has been proven to be reliable for cerebellum segmentation [ ].
On the cerebral level, almost all structures found were significantly smaller in the juvenile Huntington series. This is of particular interest since the reduced volume of cerebral structures is not always salient, as it was the case for patient 2 in our study. As expected, the largest reductions in volumes were in the caudate and putamen nuclei, the structures known to be the most affected in adult-onset Huntington disease, which was consistent with neuropathological and neuroimaging studies [ , ]. The globus pallidus was significantly smaller in our patients in comparison to normal controls (approximately 60% smaller). The thalamus, which is a structure that has experienced only minor attention in neuropathological Huntington disease reports, was slightly reduced by an average 20% in our three patients compared to the normal mean. The amygdala, hippocampus and brainstem were slightly smaller in our patients but not markedly reduced. Atrophy of these structures may result in clinical symptoms, such as an alteration of emotional function [ , ] for the amygdala, cognitive alteration for the hippocampus [ , ] and abnormal extraocular movements or sleep disturbance for the brainstem [ , ]. Assessing significant differences between juvenile Huntington disease patients and normal groups will require larger cohorts.
The cerebellum is among the extrastriatal brain sites whose involvement in Huntington disease and its relevance for the clinical picture is still controversial [ , , , , , ]. The cerebellum has received limited attention in Huntington disease, despite signs of possible cerebellar dysfunction, including motor incoordination and impaired gait, which are currently attributed to basal ganglia atrophy and disrupted fronto-striatal circuits.
Although a few voxel-based morphometry studies are available for adult Huntington disease [ , ], this study is, to our knowledge, the first quantitative imaging investigation of both cerebral and cerebellar changes in juvenile Huntington disease. This investigation is of particular interest since cerebellar atrophy is more likely to occur in individuals with a juvenile onset, although the exact mechanisms underlying it are still not well understood.
Quantitative data regarding cerebellar atrophy in juvenile Huntington disease are rare. Only a few examples have been thoroughly described [ , , , ]. We previously reported a review of six patients whose disease onset was before the age of 10 years [ ], with morphologically proven reduced cerebellar volumes and very large CAG expansions (more than 100 repeats) [ , , , , , ]. Two patients showed a reduction of the cerebellar volume on control imaging following an initial normal MRI [ , ].
Our findings describe cerebellar atrophy with a global quantitative approach. The atrophy was diffuse and present in all cerebellar lobules. It was particularly salient in the posterior lobe lobules (VI, VII, VIII, IX, Crus I and II). On average, the anterior lobules (I, II, III, IV, V) were less affected than the posterior lobules and the flocculonodular lobe (lobule X) was the least atrophic. Our approach only shows a distribution pattern. The differences between lobules were not significant since our study lacks statistical power.
There is little neuropathological data regarding the distribution of cerebellar damage in Huntington disease. Some studies have shown that cerebellar atrophy may have a disease-specific pattern with uneven involvement of anterior, superior and inferior lobes [ ]. In chronic epilepsy, the pattern of cerebellar atrophy may vary depending on the etiology of a previous patient’s cerebral damage: Posterior lobe atrophy is more often associated with fronto-temporal contusions and may be post traumatic rather than a result of excitotoxic damage mediated via cerebro-cerebellar pathways [ , ]. Studies on dementia also showed that the vulnerability of the human cerebellum may depend on the type of pathology and that preferred atrophied regions share robust and selective intrinsic connectivity with atrophied region in the cerebral cortex [ ]. The specific cerebellar pattern atrophy seen in our patients could hypothetically be linked to the pattern of atrophic cerebral regions. Testing this hypothesis will require an analysis of a larger number of subjects.
The origin of cerebellar atrophy in Huntington disease remains controversial. Several hypotheses of neurotoxic processes leading to atrophy suggest the role of abnormal cerebellar/brainstem-thalamic-frontal-striatal connections [ , ]. Seizure activity itself, which can be a symptom of juvenile Huntington, and antiepileptic medication like phenytoin or valproate has been associated with cerebellar atrophy in adults and children. Of note, ataxia was clinically observed before the first seizures in our patients and patient 1 never experienced epilepsy.
The functional consequences of the cerebellar atrophy observed in patients with juvenile Huntington disease also remain unknown. Quantitative morphological studies are needed to determine whether the cerebellum is a site of primary degeneration and how cerebellar lesions evolve during the course of the pathology. Our study was limited by the number of patients. This is explained by the rarity of juvenile Huntington disease, especially those with a very early onset. However, we could perform an intrafamilial study that allow sfor lower interindividual genetic heterogeneity.
Conclusion
Our study sheds light on atrophic cerebral and cerebellar structures in juvenile Huntington disease. Automatic segmentations of the cerebellum provide patterns of preferred posterior lobe atrophy that may be of diagnostic interest in this disease. This work may lead to further studies with more patients and with higher spatial resolution MRI sequences for better and sharper cerebellar segmentation.
