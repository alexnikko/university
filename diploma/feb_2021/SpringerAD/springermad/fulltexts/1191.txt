Introduction
Anti-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibodies were discovered in 1957 and since then have been well recognized as diagnostic markers of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Their detection is still ubiquitously used to help diagnose and manage SLE, correlating with disease activity and nephritis [ , ]. Anti-dsDNA antibodies are included in the SLE classification criteria established by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) [ , ] which were recently revised by the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics classification criteria (SLICC) [ ].
DNA is found in all prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells of all species. It can act as antigen may be either dsDNA or single stranded (ssDNA), but in vivo mainly works in the structure of the nucleosome. Because the epitopes situated on DNA are mainly based on the repetitive negative charge of the molecule, synthetic polynucleotides are often also recognized by anti-DNA antibodies. Additionally, the ribonucleic acid (RNA) can also constitute an antigen in SLE condition and its corresponding antibody reactivity can be linked to epitopes shared with DNA or not form a separate entity [ , ].
Until few years ago, anti-dsDNA antibodies were generally detected by commercially available kits for enzymatic immunoassay (EIA), Crithidia luciliae indirect immunofluorescence assay (CLIFT), and the Farr radioimmunoassay (RIA). Although, RIA is still widely considered as the gold standard due to the high-affinity autoantibodies’ detection with results that can be correlated with global SLE activity, vasculitis, and renal involvement, it has been replaced by non-radioisotopic-automated techniques. In the last decades, new fully automated technologies have become largely used in diagnostic laboratories worldwide such as chemiluminescent immunoassay (CIA) [ , ], fluorescence enzyme immunoassay (FEIA) [ , ], and a multiplex fluorescent immunoassay (MFI) [ , ]. The use of these fully automated new technologies could represent a great potential in diagnostic application as viable screening and follow-up alternatives, as supported by a growing sound literature [ , , , ]. The different combination of methods used in the modern autoimmune laboratory scenario is still without a specific international consensus on exclusive methods [ , , ], and the assays are different in term of class, avidity, affinity, complement fixing ability, antigenic specificity, substrate differences, and cross-reactive pattern of the antibodies detected [ , ]. Good correlation coefficients among anti-dsDNA methods were globally reported when studies were focused on SLE cohort; instead, the results have been discrepant when the test was used to screen the SLE disease from a non-SLE disease [ ]. For the SLE diagnosis, the anti-DNA antibodies test should be highly specific, since high level of anti-dsDNA antibodies not related to SLE can be detected in other autoimmune diseases as well in healthy individuals. Therefore, it is recommended that positive results obtained with any screening method should be verified by the Farr method or CLIFT [ ]. Anti-dsDNA autoantibodies’ production can be transient or maintained as they can be produced in the context of infections or drugs and the differences might be attributed to variations in the immune response to native DNA [ ]. Anti-dsDNA antibodies have been specifically reported following treatment of inflammatory arthritis (IA) with biological therapies [ , , , ]. Considering the current use of the biological drugs as therapeutic strategies, the development of anti-dsDNA antibodies is often encountered in IA, affecting the post-test probability for a given disease, limiting the specificity of the test [ ].
The main aim of the present study was to compare the diagnostic performance in SLE disease of six assays evaluating the analytical variability in the determination of anti-dsDNA antibodies, using both old and new tests. We tried to identify the most efficient strategy for determining anti-dsDNA antibodies considering each method as single or combined. The second aim was to understand how much biological treatments can affect the different anti-dsDNA assays, so we analyzed a control group including IA patients under biological drugs.
Material and methods
Sera
The study included 246 samples from patients suffering from SLE ( n = 70) as well as a control group ( n = 176), including 96 patients with IA [ ], 40 patients with autoimmune thyroiditis, and 40 samples from apparently healthy blood donors. The IA patients were under treatment with different biological agents and they did not develop a clinical drug-induced lupus (DIL) in a follow-up of at least 5 years according to Borchers et al.’s proposed diagnostic criteria [ ]. The SLE diagnosis was established in agreement with the ACR classification criteria [ ]. This study meets and is in compliance with all ethical standards in medicine, and informed consent was obtained from all patients according to the Declaration of Helsinki and to Italian legislation (Authorization of the Privacy Guarantor No. 9, December 12, 2013). The institutional review board, the Health Director of San Giovanni di Dio Hospital in Florence, reviewed and approved this study and the use of clinical and laboratory data of common clinical practice, with respect to privacy law, for clinical and scientific studies and publications.
BioPlex®2200
BioPlex® 2200 System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) is an automated analyzer that uses multiplex bead technology (Luminex, Austin, TX, USA) to simultaneously detect antibodies to several antigens in a single tube. The BioPlex® 2200 ANA Screen kit is intended for the qualitative screening of anti-nuclear antibodies (ANAs), the quantitative detection of antibodies to dsDNA, and the semi-quantitative detection of 12 separate antibodies (Chromatin, Ribosomal P, SS-A 52kD, SS-A 60kD, SS-B, Sm, SmRNP, RNP A, RNP 68, Scl-70, Jo-1, and Centromere B) in human serum and/or EDTA or heparinized plasma [ ]. Thirteen populations of different dyed magnetic particles are coated with 13 antigens mentioned above. Three additional populations of dyed magnetic particle are present in the reagent to verify the detector response (ISB), the correct sample addition in the reaction vessel (SVB), and to exclude the presence of significant interference substances in the sample (RBB). The reporter fluorophore is B-phycoerythrin (PE) and the analyte concentration is proportional to the fluorescence intensity. Results are expressed in IU/mL for anti-dsDNA and the result interpretation established by the manufacturer is 5–9 IU/mL (indeterminate) and ≥ 10 IU/mL (positive). Characteristics of this assay as well as of all the others presented in the following “QUANTA Flash dsDNA,” “Kallestad TM anti-dsDNA microplate EIA,” and “ Crithidia luciliae immunofluorescence test (CLIFT) assay” sections are summarized in Table 1 .

QUANTA Flash dsDNA
The QUANTA Flash dsDNA (Inova Diagnostics Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) assay is a novel CIA that is used on the BIO-FLASH instrument (Biokit s.a., Barcelona, Spain). The QUANTA Flash assay for this study was developed using synthetic dsDNA (Table 1 ) coupled to the surface of paramagnetic beads. The principle of the BIO-FLASH system has recently been described [ , , , ]. Briefly, the relative light units (RLUs) on the BIO-FLASH are proportional to the amount of isoluminol conjugate that is bound to the anti-human IgG, which in turn is proportional to the amount of anti-dsDNA antibodies bound to the antigen on the beads. Using a standard curve, all RLU values are converted into calculated units (CU).
Kallestad™ anti-dsDNA Microplate EIA
The Kallestad™ anti-dsDNA Microplate EIA (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules CA) is an indirect enzyme immunoassay for the quantitative or qualitative detection of total autoantibodies (IgG/IgM) to dsDNA in human serum or plasma. The microwells, method solid phase, are coated with a preparation of purified calf thymus DNA, while the conjugate is an alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat polyclonal antibody to human IgG and IgM in Tris buffer with bovine serum albumin and < 0.1% sodium azide.
In the quantitative protocol, the concentration of anti-dsDNA antibody in an unknown sample is estimated by interpolation from a dose-response curve based on 5 calibrators (from 0 to 300 IU/ml) standardized against WHO Reference Preparation Wo/80. Results are reported as international units (IU) per milliliter (Table 1 ).
Crithidia luciliae immunofluorescence test (CLIFT) assay
The CLIFT assay was performed with three commercially available methods: Euroimmun CLIFT (Euroimmun AG, Luebeck, Germany), NOVA Lite CLIFT (Inova Diagnostics Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), and Kallestad TM Crithidia luciliae (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules CA). The screening sample dilution was 1/10. System and reagent quality was monitored on each run by adding two controls, one positive (anti-dsDNA) and one negative. The sample was considered as positive when the kinetoplast was stained with a defined fluorescence. Characteristics of the assay are summarized in Table 1 .
Statistical analysis
The statistical analysis of the data aimed to evaluate and to compare the detection performances of dsDNA methods. Data were processed and analyzed using our in-house software tool coded in MATLAB (Mathworks Inc., MA, USA).
The performance parameters (overall agreement, sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio [LR+], negative likelihood ratio [LR−], positive predictive value [PPV] and negative predictive value [NPV], odds ratio) were calculated using the manufacturers’ cut-off values for each assay, and the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn up. The performances were first measured using all the samples and, in a second step, excluding the 96 sera with IA. We measured the Cohen’s kappa to analyze the agreement between methods. Although the k value varies from a lower bound of − 1 to an upper bound of 1, the usual region of interest is k > 0. In the literature, the following guidelines for interpreting kappa values are used: 0 ≤ k < 0.2 implies slight agreement; 0.2 ≤ k < 0.4 implies fair agreement; 0.4 ≤ k < 0.6 implies moderate agreement; 0.6 ≤ k < 0.8 implies substantial agreement, and 0.8 ≤ k ≤ 1 implies almost perfect agreement. Finally, we ran a supervised cluster analysis to map the distribution of the agreements for every assay between each sample, which is graphically represented in Fig. 1 . Fig. 1 Supervised cluster analysis, where the round angle of each circle is divided into 246 parts, and each circle sector corresponds to a sample. The most inner circle represents the diagnosis whereas the others represent the reactivity of each method. The positive tests are colored in blue, whereas the negative tests are colored in red. In case of EIA, 37 samples (depicted in black) have been not tested for the lack of available volume
Results
The pairwise agreement between methods expressed in terms of Cohen’s kappa and values ranged from 0.47 of EIA vs. CLIFT C to 0.68 of EIA vs. MFI (Table 2 ). In some cases, the majority of SLE patients had multiple positive results, while in other cases, the anti-dsDNA methods showed positive results in the control groups. EIA, MFI, and CIA provide clusters closest to the diagnosis of SLE (Fig. 1 ). The clinical performance of each method is first computed considering all the samples included in the study and then excluding the 96 IA sera from the study (Table 3 ). Turning our attention to results measured when we consider all the samples (column Ω ) , we observe that the clinical sensitivities at the recommended cut-off ranged from 5.7% (95% confidence interval, CI 2.8–8.6) by CLIFT A up to 33.3% (95% CI 24.7%–35.7%) provided by EIA while the clinical specificities at the recommended cut-off varied significantly from 89.8 to 98.9%. All the NPV values are higher than 0.70, whereas the average PPV value is equal to 0.68, and in particular, the PPV provided by MFI, EIA, and CLIFT is lower than the average. The odds ratio (LR+/LR−) for anti-dsDNA methods varied between 3.49 (CLIFT A) and 16.20 (CLIFT C). The comparative ROC curve analysis for anti-dsDNA antibody assays showed different AUC values (Fig. 2 , Table 3 ), where the highest AUC value was equal to 0.690 and it was obtained by EIA and the lowest AUC value was equal to 0.585 and it was achieved by CIA. With respect to the results achieved when the sample cohort does not include IA patients, we observe that specificity, PPV, LR+, and the odds ratio improved. For instance, the average improvement was equal to 2% in case of specificity and to 29.7% for PPV.

Discussion
The diagnosis of SLE is still a great challenge for the heterogeneity in clinical manifestations, especially at the early stage of the disease. SLICC revised and validated the ACR SLE classification criteria to better adhere to rigorous requisites and gain further awareness about the SLE disease [ ]. In the old immunologic criterion, anti-dsDNA antibodies, anti-Sm antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, and anti-cardiolipin antibodies were combined [ ]. The SLICC classification criteria have split these features into separate criteria, so that each may contribute to classification [ ]. Therefore, the immunologic criterion became more consistent with advancing concepts in SLE serologic tests as well as concerns about the wider use of EIA and multiplex assays. Nevertheless, the new anti-dsDNA antibody criterion remained unsatisfactory from a laboratory point of view, mostly due to a lack of a stricter cut-off for the ELISA assay and the poor consideration of the new widespread technologies, such as FEIA, CIA, and MFI methods [ ]. Anti-dsDNA antibody levels above laboratory reference range (or twofold the reference range if tested by EIA), as SLICC criteria states, is in fact too vague and imprecise [ ].
In a modern laboratory scenario, the origin of routine samples requiring anti-dsDNA testing has changed as it is used both for ANA-associated rheumatic diseases (AARD) and non-ANA-associated rheumatic diseases (non-AARD) conditions, i.e., during the monitoring of biological treatment in IA. Indeed, a broader range of clinical specialists (i.e., gynecologists, cardiologists, oncologists, neurologists) order anti-dsDNA test, much like the ongoing change in ANA test referral patterns [ ]. Moving away from the traditional meaning of the anti-dsDNA test and considering that non-AARDs may also be associated with anti-dsDNA antibodies, it is clear how important it is nowadays to manage the anti-dsDNA test and its new technologies, to get the best clinical specificity and PPV of the test. In spite of the significant advances in the anti-dsDNA determination, the current choice of method still varies widely from laboratory to laboratory [ ]. In “real life” laboratories, the Farr technique is going to be totally replaced by new fully automated technologies thanks to the fact that they are less time-consuming and did not require radioactive use, as well as their high-throughput diagnostic performances, and fewer labor costs. As an assay should be rapid, easy to perform, reliable, and inexpensive, the new technologies can be considered the most appropriate tools for determining anti-dsDNA antibodies in today’s autoimmunity laboratory, but they also need to be strengthened for governing laboratory tests. Our previous study assessed the overall agreement of CLIFT, CIA, MFI, and EIA and the results showed good correlation (77–89.4%), partially consistent with the results of the current study. The present discordance rate, ranging from 84 to 93%, may be explained in part by the source of the antigen and isotype detection. Moreover, in the present study, the specificities’ performance was similar while the sensitivities were lower than in our previous study and in other reported studies, probably due to the fact that most of the patients were in clinical remission [ , , ]. Despite this, all SLE patients had positive anti-nuclear antibodies test by immunofluorescence on HEp2 cells at a ≥ 1:80 dilution. The EIA and MFI methods yielded the highest sensitivity suggesting its potential use as first assay for the SLE screening while CLIFT showed the highest specificity of the anti-dsDNA antibodies in the SLE disease. Hence, according to the existing literature [ , , ], the current study confirmed that CLIFT is a confirmatory test to detect anti-dsDNA antibodies in SLE patients and that it cannot be used as a screening method for this condition. In fact, MFI, CIA, and EIA were more sensitive but less specific than CLIFT because they also detect low-affinity antibodies but there was no significant difference in specificity comparing CIA and CLIFT.
Even if the recently introduced assays have often reflected biochemical innovations, data well show that substantial differences exist among the 6 immunoassays (MFI, EIA, CIA, CLIFT A, CLIFT B, and CLIFT C) as well as among the 3 different CLIFT tested (A, B, and C). All this means that the anti-dsDNA assays detect different anti-dsDNA antibodies and overlap only partially. This is due to the source of antigen (eukaryotic or prokaryotic, dsDNA or ssDNA), the antigen presentation to the antibody (in solution, coated to the plastic support, intact in cells such as CLIFT), and reaction conditions. The different aspects of the polyclonal autoimmune response to native DNA in SLE patients may contribute to discrepant results among different assays making it difficult to draw up a unique laboratory strategy for the anti-dsDNA antibodies’ detection. Anti-dsDNA testing may have different purposes but the main objective is still to help the clinician to diagnose SLE. For this reason, we need a very sensitive screening test including high- and low-avidity anti-dsDNA antibodies followed by a specific confirmation test detecting the high-avidity anti-dsDNA antibodies.
Nevertheless, even if the present data strongly suggest using more than one method when anti-dsDNA antibodies are present, if a laboratory chooses to use only one method because of problems inherent to the economic and personnel resources, the test used should be one that comprises the best combination of sensitivity and specificity. However, it is highly recommended to comment an anti-dsDNA result, providing the sensitivity and specificity of the method used and suggesting follow-up tests, if needed.
From the above observations, it is advisable that each laboratory selects the right assay giving the best diagnostic performances on its own population studied. A limitation of the study was that we cannot discuss its performance compared to the gold standard test, the Farr assay, as we were unable to test it due to technical difficulties inherent to the method, and to other current methods largely used such as FEIA due to insufficient serum volumes. A second limitation of this study was that no external blinding of samples was done. For this reason and since the small number of SLE patients investigated, we are aware that the findings of this study will be confirmed in a larger series of SLE patients. In view of the new technologies, it will be an interesting point to investigate also the correlation of the different tests with the disease activity status.
Even if new anti-dsDNA methods are continuously being developed, the laboratory routine setting is far from being standardized. Diagnostic performances and the discordance rate are dependent on analytical variability and the population studied. Clinicians should be aware of the diagnostic performances of the currently available assays to better interpret the reported results and to better achieve a SLE diagnosis. Further improvement in the serological SLE criteria is strongly suggested taking into account the development of anti-dsDNA methods used in autoimmune laboratories.
