Introduction
Etelcalcetide (AMG 416) is a synthetic d -amino acid peptide that binds to the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) in the parathyroid gland. It is being developed as an intravenous calcimimetic for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT), a condition characterized by elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations, disturbances in mineral metabolism, and increased risk for complications and death that are common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) [ ]. Etelcalcetide lowers PTH concentrations by enhancing the sensitivity of the CaSR to calcium through allosteric activation [ ]. The d -amino acid peptide backbone in etelcalcetide is novel, and literature describing the drug disposition properties of this class of peptides is limited.
Etelcalcetide led to clinically meaningful reductions of PTH in two placebo-controlled phase 3 studies in patients with CKD and sHPT on hemodialysis; 75% of patients who received etelcalcetide experienced >30% PTH reduction from baseline compared with 9% of patients who received placebo [ ].
In rats with intact renal function, etelcalcetide was predominantly eliminated in urine [ ]. Following etelcalcetide administration, biotransformation was rapid, leading to disulfide exchange of the l -cysteine with thiols in blood, primarily with serum albumin (Fig. 1 ) [ , ]. Mathematical modeling of in vitro biotransformation kinetics in human whole blood showed that the rate constant of albumin conjugation was approximately 18-fold faster than that of deconjugation [ ].

To quantitatively evaluate the time-course of biotransformation, distribution, and elimination by intermittent hemodialysis and renal and fecal excretions of etelcalcetide in patients, a drug-disposition model (DDM) was developed using data from a single radioactive dose study (NCT02054572) conducted in patients with CKD on hemodialysis [ , ].
Methods
Clinical data
Data were extracted from a phase 1, open-label, single-dose study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, biotransformation, and excretion of [ 14 C]etelcalcetide [ ]. The study was conducted in compliance with the International Conference on Harmonisation Tripartite Guideline on Good Clinical Practice and was approved by the local institutional review board, with written informed consent provided by all patients. Briefly, six adults with CKD received a single intravenous dose of [ 14 C]etelcalcetide (10 mg; 710 nCi) at the end of hemodialysis on study day 1. Intensively sampled data were collected in multiple matrices, including etelcalcetide in plasma and total [ 14 C]etelcalcetide-derived radioactivity (C-14) in plasma, dialysate, urine, and feces. A summary of the sampling schema and available number of data points for each sampled matrix is provided in Fig. 2 and Table 1 .

Visits 4, 5, and 6 are three consecutive hemodialysis sessions approximately 1 month later, between study days 157 and 176
Blood samples were collected from predialyzer and postdialyzer (arterial and venous) lines during the hemodialysis session on study day 4 and after completion of hemodialysis to characterize the rebound phase of etelcalcetide pharmacokinetics [ ]. Urine and fecal samples were collected daily for 10 days. Blood and dialysate samples were collected at specified times for approximately 40 days, with four patients returning for two extended pharmacokinetic collection periods with three consecutive hemodialysis sessions/collection periods in each that began approximately 1 month apart (collection period 1: study days 129–148; collection period 2: study days 157–176).
Data analysis
Analysis was performed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling software NONMEM ® version 7.2 (ICON Development Solutions, Ellicott City, MD, on the NONMEM HPC system [ ]). A first-order conditional estimation with interaction (FOCEI) method was used. Data below the quantification limit (BQL; <2 ng/mL for plasma etelcalcetide) were excluded from the analysis. Exploratory analyses, descriptive summaries, and graphical visualization were generated using Tibco Spotfire ® S+8.2.0 (TIBCO Software Inc., Palo Alto, CA).
Concentration–time profiles from all matrices were plotted in semilogarithmic scale to inform structural model development and identify potential outliers. Because of the small clinical sample size (N = 6), no exploration of covariates effects was performed. Outlier identification was based on visual inspection of concentration–time profiles. Two data points that substantially deviated from adjacent points in the concentration–time profiles or from the range of values in other patients at the scheduled visit were excluded from the analysis.
Model development
Structural model
Following intravenous administration of etelcalcetide, multi-phasic disposition was observed. The initial sharp decrease in etelcalcetide concentration is likely largely due to covalent binding with albumin in blood and not due to tissue distribution. The pharmacokinetics of etelcalcetide in plasma were described previously using a three-compartment model [ ]. The model was extended to account for the different sampled matrices collected in this study. Schematic representation of the DDM structure is shown in Fig. 3 . Following intravenous administration of etelcalcetide, there is rapid biotransformation wherein the l -cysteine in etelcalcetide is exchanged with endogenous plasma thiols such as albumin (Fig. 1 ) to form disulfide conjugates. The area under the total C-14 curve in plasma, the first dialytic period (0–68 h postdose) consisted of 17% etelcalcetide, 73% albumin-bound etelcalcetide, and other smaller biotransformation products [ ]. A single term (BTx) was used to describe the biotransformed products. Fig. 3 Drug disposition model structure for etelcalcetide. Definitions of symbols are included in Table 2
The disulfide exchange to form BTx and the reverse reaction to form etelcalcetide are described by rate constants, k c and k dc . The BTx formed was assumed to distribute to two distinct peripheral compartments, described by rate constants k pt and k pt2 (transfer from plasma to peripheral), and k tp and k tp2 (transfer from peripheral to central). Etelcalcetide and BTx have independent volumes of distribution in the central compartment ( Vd1 and Vd2 ).
The majority of BTx is albumin-bound drug with the molecular weight of approximately 67 kDa. Because the dialyzer semipermeable membrane (Optiflux ® F180NR; Fresenius Medical Care, Waltham, MA) used in hemodialysis has a molecular weight cutoff of 10 kDa, the majority of BTx is not dialyzed. Thus, the main species removed by hemodialysis was assumed to be etelcalcetide. However, from an in vitro incubation study, a small fraction of BTx has a molecular weight ranging from 1 to 2 kDa (denoted as BTx* in Fig. 3 ), which can be dialyzed, and therefore a fraction term ( SF ) was included in the model to account for the fraction excreted as BTx in urine and dialysate. The relative amount of etelcalcetide removed by dialysis was estimated by computing the extraction ratio value E of etelcalcetide using the noncompartmental analysis (average E = 0.385 [ ]) and plasma flow rate during hemodialysis ( Q ). E was calculated as the following: $$ E = (AUC_{A} - AUC_{V} ) / AUC_{A} $$ (1) where AUC A was the etelcalcetide area under the arterial plasma concentration–time curve obtained during hemodialysis session on day 4, and AUC V was the etelcalcetide area under the venous plasma concentration–time curve obtained from the same hemodialysis session. In the model, the extraction ratios were fixed to the individual calculated values based on study day 4 data.
Q was calculated as the following: $$ Q = Q_{B} \cdot (1 - HCT) $$ (2) where Q B was the blood flow rate through the dialyzer during the hemodialysis session; HCT was the hematocrit obtained 1 day before dose administration (average Q = 333 mL/min). The cumulative radioactivity removed by intermittent dialysis was modeled as the summation of input of Q / Vd1 · E from etelcalcetide and input of Q/Vd2 · E · SF from BTx. The intermittent dialysis was implemented in NONMEM using a SWITCH variable that NONMEM interpreted as next observation carried backward: The start of dialysis events were noted using a dummy record, with TIME = start time, EVID = 2, DV = 0, MDV = 1, CMT = 4, and SWITCH = 0 The end of dialysis events were noted using an observation record, with TIME = stop time, EVID = 0, DV = dialysate C-14 in ng, MDV = 0, CMT = 4, and SWITCH = 1 Then the compartment was turned off using a dummy record, with TIME = stop time, EVID = 2, DV = 0, MDV = 1, CMT = −4, and SWITCH = 0
Urine and feces were collected every 24 h and were modeled using rate constant k u as the sum of input of k u from etelcalcetide and input of k u · SF from BTx. The 24-h intervals were implemented in NONMEM using a compartment reset approach: Observation was recorded using EVID = 0, DV = urine or feces C-14 in ng, MDV = 0, and CMT = 5 or 6 The compartment was turned off using a dummy record, with EVID = 2, DV = 0, MDV = 1, and CMT = −5 or −6 Then the compartment was turned back on using a dummy record, with EVID = 2, DV = 0, MDV = 1, and CMT = 5 or 6
Because the biotransformation process is rapid, is not readily reversible, and accounts for the majority of the species, the model assumed BTx is the main species excreted in feces. Furthermore, Jimenez et al. [ ] describes how albumin is mostly eliminated in feces in patients with nephrosis. Excretion in feces was described using rate constant k f with input from BTx. An additional elimination rate constant ( k el ) with input from etelcalcetide was added to account for nonspecific loss not captured by the study design.
The set of differential equations was as follows: $$ dA_{e } /dt = k_{dc} \cdot A_{BTx} - \left( {k_{c} + k_{u} + k_{el} } \right) \cdot A_{e } - SWITCH \cdot (Q/Vd1) \cdot E \cdot A_{e} $$ (3) $$ dA_{BTx} /dt = k_{c} \cdot A_{e} - (k_{dc} + k_{pt} + k_{pt2} + k_{f} + SWITCH \cdot (Q/Vd2) \cdot E \cdot SF + (CL_{u} /Vd2) \cdot SF) \cdot A_{BTx} + k_{tp} \cdot A_{p1} + k_{tp2} \cdot A_{p2} $$ (4) $$ dA_{p1} /dt = k_{pt} \cdot A_{BTx} - k_{tp} \cdot A_{p1} $$ (5) $$ dA_{p2} /dt = k_{pt2} \cdot A_{BTx} - k_{tp2} \cdot A_{p2} $$ (6) $$ dA_{d} /dt = SWITCH \cdot (Q/Vd1) \cdot E \cdot A_{e} + SWITCH \cdot (Q/Vd2) \cdot E \cdot SF \cdot A_{BTx} $$ (7) $$ dA_{u} /dt = k_{u} \cdot A_{e} + (CL_{u} /Vd2) \cdot SF \cdot A_{BTx} $$ (8) $$ dA_{f} /dt = k_{f} \cdot A_{BTx} $$ (9) $$ A_{e} \left( 0 \right) = 0; A_{BTx} \left( 0 \right) = 0; A_{p1} \left( 0 \right) = 0; A_{p2} \left( 0 \right) = 0; A_{d} \left( 0 \right) = 0; A_{u} \left( 0 \right) = 0; A_{f} \left( 0 \right) = 0 $$ (10) $$ k_{u} = \frac{{CL_{u} }}{Vd1};k_{el} = \frac{{CL_{n} }}{Vd1};k_{f} = \frac{{CL_{f} }}{Vd2};k_{pt} = \frac{{Q_{p1} }}{Vd2};k_{tp} = \frac{{Q_{p1} }}{Vp1}; k_{pt2} = \frac{{Q_{p2} }}{Vd2};k_{tp2} = \frac{{Q_{p2} }}{Vp2} $$ (11) where A e is the amount of etelcalcetide in plasma, A BTx is the amount of biotransformed products in plasma, A p1 is the amount in peripheral compartment 1, A p2 is the amount in peripheral compartment 2, A d is the amount of C-14 in dialysate, A u is the amount of C-14 in urine, and A f is the amount of C-14 in feces.
The observed etelcalcetide plasma concentration was modeled as A etelcalcetide / Vd1 , C-14 in plasma was modeled as A etelcalcetide / Vd1 + A BTx / Vd2 , and the eliminated C-14 in dialysate, urine, and feces were modeled as A dialysate , A urine , and A feces . A SWITCH variable was incorporated (Eqs. 3 , 4 , and 7 ) to describe the time frame where intermittent elimination occurs via hemodialysis.
Statistical model
Between subjects (interindividual, IIV ) variability in a model parameter, P , was included in the model and was assumed to be log-normally distributed (Eq. 12 ): $$ P_{j} = P \cdot { \exp }(\eta_{j} ) $$ (12) where P j is the pharmacokinetic parameter for the j-th individual; P is the population typical value for the pharmacokinetic parameter; η j is a random interindividual effect, assumed to be a random Gaussian variable with zero mean and variance ω 2 that distinguished the j-th individual’s pharmacokinetic parameter from the population typical value, P . The magnitude of IIV in the pharmacokinetic parameters is reported as a coefficient of variation ( %CV ).
Residual variability was evaluated using an exponential error model (Eq. 13 ): $$ C_{obs} = C_{pred} \cdot \exp (\varepsilon) $$ (13) where C obs is the observed analyte concentrations; C pred is the corresponding model predicted analyte concentrations; and ε was assumed to follow an independent Gaussian distribution with mean zero and variances σ 2 .
Model evaluation and simulation
Goodness-of-fit plots were used to evaluate the model fit. A visual predictive check was performed based on 100 replicates. The final model was also used to simulate concentration–time profiles of etelcalcetide and C-14 in plasma and C-14 in dialysate, urine, and feces following a single dose of 10 mg etelcalcetide in a patient on hemodialysis three times per week for 52 weeks to calculate the predicted recovery of the total dose of etelcalcetide.
Results
Exploratory analysis
The DDM for etelcalcetide was developed based on data collected from six patients with CKD and sHPT on hemodialysis [ ]. A total of 180 etelcalcetide plasma, 180 C-14 plasma, 117 C-14 dialysate, 54 C-14 urine, and 42 C-14 feces samples were included in the modeling after excluding 1 dialysate and 1 feces sample that were deemed outliers (i.e., values appeared >10-fold higher or lower than the majority of the data for the respective analyte amount). The individual time profiles of each analyte are shown in Supplementary Figure S1.
Model development
The population parameter estimates and relative standard errors from the etelcalcetide DDM are shown in Table 2 . The plasma- and excretion-predicted profiles from the model described the observation data of etelcalcetide and C-14 in all matrices (Supplementary Figure S2). Goodness-of-fit plots (Fig. 4 ) and visual predictive check plots (Fig. 5 ) indicated that there was an absence of systematic bias between the observed and predicted time profiles for etelcalcetide in plasma and total C-14 in plasma, dialysate, urine, and feces. The central volume of etelcalcetide was 14.6 L and was smaller than that of BTx (21.1 L). The model-predicted ratio of typical values of conjugation–deconjugation rate constants between etelcalcetide and BTx was 11.3. After fixing the extraction ratio of etelcalcetide to values previously estimated by noncompartmental analysis, the remaining dialyzable BTx* ( SF term) was estimated to be 8.71%. The standard errors were reasonable (<60%) for all parameters. In addition, the interindividual variances for CL u , CL n , Vd1, and Vd2 were 159, 20.8, 26 and 14.3%, respectively).

Model-based simulation
The simulated concentration–time profile, with three dialysis sessions per week for 52 weeks (364 days), accounted for 60.1% of the total administered dose of etelcalcetide. For the same duration, urine and feces accounted for 2.5 and 5.7% of the total dose. The nonspecific elimination contributed to 31.2% of the total elimination. The terminal half-life of total C-14 in plasma was approximately 56 days, as determined from the slope of the simulated total C-14 concentration in plasma between 168 and 364 days.
Discussion
Etelcalcetide consists of a unique construct of eight synthetic D-amino acids. In reviewing the literature, there is currently no other approved drug with similar structure or published absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties in patients. Etelcalcetide is being developed for treatment of sHPT in patients with CKD on hemodialysis. In particular, the intermittent hemodialysis, typically three times per week, complicates the characterization of pharmacokinetic properties. The traditional noncompartmental analysis (NCA) methods cannot be employed to calculate clearance and volume due to the intermittent clearance by hemodialysis. Furthermore, a reversible biotransformation process that mainly occurred by forming disulfide exchange with albumin in plasma warrants a more complicated quantitation method than NCA. Hence, we developed the DDM for etelcalcetide using patient data. Following a single etelcalcetide intravenous dose to patients with CKD on hemodialysis, the majority of radioactivity (67% of dose) was eliminated by hemodialysis in 176 days [ ]. Etelcalcetide cysteine disulfide bond undergoes biotransformation to form conjugates by disulfide exchange with thiols in blood [ , , ]. Most of the circulating etelcalcetide-related biotransformed moieties existed as albumin-bound etelcalcetide [ , , ]. Etelcalcetide and its biotransformation products (BTx in Fig. 1 ) exist in equilibrium. The DDM simultaneously described the time-course of plasma etelcalcetide; formation and reversal of BTx; distribution to two peripheral compartments; excretion to urine, feces, and dialysate; and nonspecific elimination in patients with CKD and sHPT on hemodialysis. Distribution to peripheral tissues from etelcalcetide was not included in the final model structure but was tested during model development. Imposing distribution to peripheral compartment from etelcalcetide only, or in addition to those of BTx, did not result in better fitting, or resulted in parameters not being identifiable. This was also supported by an in vitro investigation [ ] that noted that etelcalcetide readily binds to albumin in blood upon administration. At any given time, the bound species is more abundant, such that the free etelcalcetide would be bound to albumin before having the opportunity to distribute to the peripheral compartment. Also, as shown in Rothschild et al. [ ], albumin has a biphasic disposition profile and is largely distributed to muscle and skin.
The model provided valuable insight into the disposition of this novel class of synthetic d -amino acid peptides and revealed that the distribution volume of BTx (21.1 L) was larger than that of etelcalcetide (14.6 L). The difference in these volumes of distribution indicates the unique disposition of etelcalcetide, where it readily conjugates with the large pool of albumin. The conversion kinetics is determined by the physicochemical properties such as the acid dissociation constant ( pKa ) of cysteine in serum albumin. Notably, the conjugation rate constant was 11.3-fold higher than the deconjugation rate constant, which was comparable to the ratio of 18 observed in in vitro human whole blood incubation experiments [ ]. Model-based simulations revealed that hemodialysis three times per week accounted for 60.1% of the total elimination of the administered single etelcalcetide dose. Only minimal amounts were eliminated in urine (2.5%) and feces (5.7%), whereas nonspecific elimination accounted for 31.2% of the total elimination. The exact mechanism of nonspecific elimination is currently unknown. For a different d -amino acid peptide, RD2, degradation after prolonged in vivo exposure could not be ruled out, although the peptide was stable for at least 24 h in plasma and tissue homogenates [ ]. Etelcalcetide does not penetrate red blood cells [ ], and typical nonspecific catabolism by proteases was not observed [ , ]. The trial overcame the challenges of conducting a radiolabeled mass balance study in patients on hemodialysis three times per week for over 170 days; however, it was not ideal for estimating intersubject variability and residual errors due to the small sample size (N = 6 patients).
Although the majority of the BTx species are not dialyzable because their size exceeds the 10-kDa molecular weight cutoff of the hemodialysis membrane [ ], the model predicted a small fraction of BTx with low molecular weight was subjected to dialysis (approximately 8.7% and consistent with previous observations) [ ]. Based on simulations for 52 weeks, the terminal half-life of C-14 was predicted to be approximately 56 days. As reviewed by Roffey et al., a longer drug half-life often leads to lower total drug recovery due to practical challenges [ ]. Such challenges were experienced in this study for etelcalcetide, in which total recovery was only approximately 70% [ ].
Measurements of C-14 in plasma, dialysate, urine, and feces in this study provided valuable insight of etelcalcetide disposition. This could not be accomplished using the traditional NCA approach, as plasma data would yield inaccurate estimates of clearance and volume of distribution due to lack of accurate description of the intermittent clearance by hemodialysis and the biotransformation processes. The previously reported population pharmacokinetic (PPK) analysis estimated the parameters based on measurement of etelcalcetide in plasma alone [ ]. Because biotransformation processes were not part of the PPK model, the volume of distribution estimates became artificially inflated, showing the volume of distribution at steady-state of approximately 624 L in the PPK analysis versus 159 L in the DDM. In addition, the hemodialysis clearance (CL HD ) estimated by the PPK analysis was 22.2 L/h, whereas in this DDM, in which the CL HD is blood flow to dialysis ( Q ) multiplied by the extraction ratio ( E ), the DDM estimate was very different. In the DDM, individual-specific values for E were estimated based on observed AUC using samples collected at day 4 from predialyzer and postdialyzer (arterial and venous) lines. The mean and standard deviation of E were 0.385 and 0.0679, respectively, with a %CV of 17.6%. The individual values of E were 0.439, 0.367, 0.421, 0.256, 0.406 and 0.421 respectively. The hemodialysis clearance estimate was approximately 7.69 L/h (based on average values, E = 0.385, Q = 333 mL/min) [ ], which is substantially lower than the estimates by PPK analysis (22.2 L/h). This is not considered a discrepancy per se, given the differences in model structures, matrices analyzed, and species measured. In essence, the hemodialysis clearance estimated from the human ADME study that incorporates the biotransformation process is the most physiologically relevant, and thus, the most clinically relevant.
In an earlier phase 2 trial, the terminal half-life of etelcalcetide was reported to be 18–20 h [ ]. However, the pharmacokinetics samples were only collected for 65 h (before the next hemodialysis) [ ], which in turn hampered a better description of terminal phases. The DDM model described the temporary clearance of etelcalcetide in plasma during hemodialysis and a partial recovery due to deconjugation from albumin after hemodialysis. When this unique phenomenon is incorporated in the DDM, the terminal half-life was estimated to be 56 days. This estimate is comparable to that of the PPK estimates (data not yet published). It would be important to acknowledge that although etelcalcetide concentrations remain measureable for a long time, this is not essentially driving any meaningful pharmacological activity. This is also observed for other drugs such as meldonium and gentamicin [ , ]. While the small sample size from the human ADME study does not warrant covariate analysis, the population PK/PD analysis using phase 1, 2, and 3 data did not reveal significant covariates that could impact either the PK or PD parameters.
In conclusion, there is limited information in the literature on the ADME properties of synthetic d -amino acids. This DDM provided a quantitative approach to describe biotransformation, distribution, and elimination of etelcalcetide, a unique peptide with a backbone of seven d -amino acids, in the relevant patient population.
