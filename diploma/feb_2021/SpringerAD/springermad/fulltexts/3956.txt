Introduction
Mathematical modeling of cancer began during the first half of the 19th century with Gompertz describing the “Human law of mortality” in which he showed that over the lifespan of human adults, mortality rates related to age increased in an exponential manner [ ]. Such early mathematical models focused on the dynamics of tumor growth and characterizing the overall temporal phenomenon of cancer progression [ ]. The increasing interest for mathematical modeling of the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of anticancer drugs has favored the building of mechanism-based and systems models able to provide experimentalists and oncologists with valuable tools in designing methodological preclinical (i.e., in vitro and in vivo) experiments for testing hypotheses and refining fundamental mechanisms involved in cancer progression, and contributing in planning clinical trials and improving clinical outcomes by selecting optimal drug dosing, scheduling, and combinatorial regimens [ ].
A general scheme portraying the basic components of PK/PD models for anti-cancer agents is shown in Fig. 1 . The drug PK as depicted by the time-course of plasma concentrations (C P ) in the central compartment is in equilibrium with its concentrations at an effect compartment (C e ). Depending on the speed of this process (i,e., value of k eo , first-order rate constant between C p and C e ), biological systems can be either time-independent or time-dependent. For the former, equilibrium takes place soon after anticancer drug administration (i.e., large k eo relative to turnover processes). Conceptually, this translates to a straightforward relationship for C P as a driving function for the response (R). In contrast, for time-dependent biological systems, the kinetics of R is slow relative to changes in C p (i.e., small k eo values), thus inclusion of a link compartment can accommodate for such a time-delay. In general, anti-cancer drugs exert their effects through mechanisms of action that are cytostatic (i.e., cycle-arrest) and/or cytolytic (i.e., cell-killing). In the PD model diagram (Fig. 1 ), the former converts to an inhibition of cell growth, whereas the latter translates to a stimulation of natural cell death. Whereas cytostatic drugs exhibit reversible effects, with possible restart of the cell-cycle and re-amplification of resistant cells (R r ) soon after the anticancer agent is removed from the biological system, cytolytic agents exhibit irreversible effects, in which sensitive cells die following drug exposure. These mechanisms usually occur in a temporal cascade, adding further delays to drug effects with regard to their dosing. The incorporation of a mean transit time ( \(\tau\) ) between the intermediate compartments in the chain of signal transduction can accommodate such delays. Fig. 1 The PK of the anti-cancer drug is represented by its plasma concentration (C P ) in the central compartment, which (assuming steady-state conditions) is in equilibrium with its concentrations at the effect compartment (C e ). The parameter k eo represents a first-order rate constant between C p and C e , and its value informs the rate of equilibration between the two compartments. Cytotoxic effects of anticancer agents can be cytostatic (i.e., cycle-arresting) inhibiting the proliferation of cancer cells and/or cytolytic (i.e., cell-killing) stimulating the natural death of cancer cells. Cytostatic drugs may have reversible effects when drug is cleared from the biological system. The cell-cycle restarts, and the cycling cells may acquire features of chemoresistance. Cytolytic agents have irreversible effects with death of the affected cells. Both mechanisms of action occur in time, which consequently result in temporal delays to the cytotoxic effects. These delays can be successfully described by adding a mean transit time ( \(\tau\) ) between the intermediate compartments in a series of signal transduction and/or cell differentiation
In this review, classes of relevant mechanism-based and systems PK/PD models for anti-cancer agents are presented. The aim is to highlight features of such models that facilitate the effective integration of different experimental platforms, from in silico screening of drug candidates to preclinical and clinical learning and confirming, thus providing a useful framework for translational research in oncology.
Empirical models
For many anti-cancer agents, the area under the concentration–time curve (AUC), the steady-state drug concentration (C ss ), and the time above a threshold concentration (C T ) have been successfully used as predictors of efficacy and/or safety. Empirical PD models that assume a direct relationship between drug exposure and the peak (maximum) or nadir (minimum) response (or toxicity) have been used to describe the pharmacological effects of anti-cancer drugs. Although these empirical models have shown limited scientific interest, they are the most common type reported in the clinical literature. For instance, high concentrations over a short time-interval, or low concentrations during a long period, may result in similar AUC measurements and lead to comparable exposure driven effects. Additionally, when time above C T is the driving component for the cytotoxic effect, the response is either all or none. Typically, these empirical PD models use linear, log-linear, exponential, maximal effect (E max ), Hill, or spline mathematical functions. As examples: (i) a linear relationship was identified between the AUC of a paclitaxel/carboplatin combination and the associated platelet nadir [ ], (ii) an exponential model well fitted the survival fraction of leukocytes under etoposide treatment [ ], and (iii) the relationship between drug AUC and the decrease in neutrophil and platelet counts from their baselines to their nadir was approximated with an E max model [ ]. The shape of the exposure–response curve can be modified by adding a Hill exponent to the E max model as exemplified by the joint effect of 5-fluorouracil and epirubicin on leukocyte toxicity [ ]. Inclusion of several empirical models or so-called “combined models” [ ] and the use of cubic mathematical functions or “spline models” [ ] offer the opportunity to describe the entire temporal profile of the anti-neoplastic effect.
The mathematical formulations used in these empirical PD models to link the PK of the anti-cancer drug to its PD lack a mechanistic description of underlying physiological processes. Aside from combined and spline models, a majority of empirical models are unable to describe the entire exposure–response time profile. This is because the drug killing effect is driven by a static metric or a value that is characterized at a specific time point, such as AUC 24h , C ss , and C T . One way to address these deficiencies is to include a time variable in the model and to account for time-delays between the exposure of the drug and time-dependent pharmacological effects of the anti-cancer drug.
Time-dependent pharmacological models
A common feature to many anti-cancer agents is a characteristic lag-time between drug exposure and its subsequent cytotoxic effect. This typical property is usually identifiable through a temporal shift (or hysteresis) in the graphics of the effect versus concentrations. Diverse underlying pharmacological and/or physiological phenomena may lead to this temporal dissociation between PK and PD. Three types of basic mathematical PD models have been commonly employed to capture these delays: (1) the link or biophase models, (2) the indirect-response models, and (3) the transit compartment models.
The biophase model was pioneered by Sheiner et al. [ ]. Basically, a hypothetical effect-compartment is added to account for the observed time-delay between the drug plasma concentration time-course and its effect. The underlying assumption in this model is based upon the slow equilibration of drug concentrations between the plasma and the effect compartment. The time to peak response of the drug being independent of the dose and occurring shortly after the peak plasma concentration is a key trait for biophase models. As an example, Tham et al. [ ] successfully captured tumor size shrinkage over the exposure time course to gemcitabine and its metabolite gemcitabine triphosphate in Non-Small-Cell Lung cancer (NSCLC) using the link model.
The formal indirect-response models were initiated by Daneyka et al. [ ], and four basic indirect response models (IDR I, II, III, and IV) were proposed. All models are based upon indirect mechanisms of drug action, in which either stimulation (IDR III and IV) or inhibition (IDR I and II) functions affect the zero-order production rate (K in ) or first-order removal rate constant (K out ) of the response variable. The dose-dependency of the time to peak effect and its shift towards later times at large doses are signature profiles for these IDR models. As an example, an IDR I with paclitaxel-driven inhibitory action on the medullary production of leukocytes was published by Minami et al. [ ].
The transit compartment models are by far the most popular in PD modeling of anti-cancer drug effects. They were first introduced in 1998 by Sun and Jusko [ ], who proposed to use one or more intermediate compartments to account for the time-delay in the dynamical response. The passage from one compartment to the next is accomplished through a first-order process in which identical rate constant (k tr ) covers the chain of compartments. The succession of these compartments is physiologically interpreted as intracellular signaling pathways or stages of cell maturation under pharmacological effects of compounds. The simplest model comprises one intermediate compartment, and such a model was applied by Zomboni et al. [ ] for their modeling of topotecan-induced neutropenia. Although signal transduction models are semi-mechanistically based, all the elements in the chain are not entirely known, which without experimental measures, may evidence parameter unidentifiability. The use of transit compartment models in oncology will be more exemplified further in this review.
Unperturbed tumor growth models
Most cancers are diagnosed once the tumor has already reached a “critical” tumor mass, which often occurs two to three decades passed the first oncogenic event. Modeling the development of metastases from primary and locally recurring tumors has been investigated [ ], but based on the assumption that tumor growth follows a Gompertz model [ ]. Guiot et al. [ ] suggested a more general growth equation for neoplastic cell growth based on the universal law for the ontogenic growth proposed by West et al. [ ]. Briefly, the growth law equation (Eq. 1 ) was derived from an application of the first law of thermodynamics and allometric scaling of cell metabolic rates, which fractal exponent ( p ) is assumed to be constant ( p = 0.25) for all living organisms. In their proposed dynamic evolution model, Guiot et al. [ ] removed this assumption and hypothesized that p varies through the different phases of tumor progression (e.g., nonvascular, angiogenesis, invasive, and metastasis), thus modeling tumor growth returns to modeling common cell growth: $$\left( {{m \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {m M}} \right. \kern-0pt} M}} \right)^{0.25} = 1 - \left[ {1 - \left( {{{m_{0} } \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{m_{0} } M}} \right. \kern-0pt} M}} \right)^{0.25} } \right] \cdot \exp \left( {{{ - a \cdot t} \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{ - a \cdot t} {4M}}} \right. \kern-0pt} {4M}}} \right)^{0.25}$$ (1) with m being the total mass of an organism, which can be determined from the mass of an individual cell and the number of cells, M is the asymptotic maximum body size, m 0 is the mass of the organism at birth, a is a model parameter (which is roughly constant within a species and proportional to the organism metabolic rate across species), and t is time. The values of a , m 0 and M are reported for many different species. The West model for growth only applies to organisms growing in unrestricted dietary conditions. Therefore, only fully replenished tumors will follow this ontogenic growth pattern, whereas differences in growth rates and capacity sizes were found in tumors with different oxygen levels and glucose concentrations [ ]. Thus, deviations from this growth law will depend on environmental conditions.
It is commonly accepted that cancer cells grow in an exponential [ ], logistic (Gompertz) [ ], or nonlinear (Michaelis–Menten) [ ] manner. The growth kinetics of malignant cells can therefore be described mathematically with an empirical “growth function”, the form of which may vary depending on the type of tumor cells and experimental conditions (e.g., sampling times). The growth function g(R) describes the dynamics of cancer cell proliferation in the absence of any anti-neoplastic drug: Exponential growth $$g(R) = {{dR} \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{dR} {dt}}} \right. \kern-0pt} {dt}} = k_{ng} \cdot R\,\;{\text{with}}\,\;k_{ng} = k_{g} - k_{d}$$ (2) with the response ( R ) as the number of malignant cells, ( k ng ) is a first-order rate constant of the net growth, and ( k g ) and ( k d ) are the first-order growth and death rate constants. Logistic (Gompertz) growth When cell-growth reaches a plateau at a maximum cell number ( R ss ), a logistic model is more appropriate for describing g ( R ): $$g(R) = {{dR} \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{dR} {dt}}} \right. \kern-0pt} {dt}} = k_{ng} \cdot R \cdot \left( {1 - {R \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {R {R_{ss} }}} \right. \kern-0pt} {R_{ss} }}} \right)\,\;{\text{where}}\,\;\left\{ \begin{array}{ll} R \approx 0\;,\;\;\;\left( {1 - {R \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {R {R_{ss} }}} \right. \kern-0pt} {R_{ss} }}} \right) \approx 1\;and\quad g(R) \to k_{ng} \cdot R \hfill \\ R \approx R_{ss} ,\;\left( {1 - {R \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {R {R_{ss} }}} \right. \kern-0pt} {R_{ss} }}} \right) \approx 0\;and\quad g(R) \to 0 \hfill \\ \end{array} \right.\;\quad$$ (3) Nonlinear (Michaelis–Menten) growth When cell-growth is saturable, a Michaelis–Menten equation can be applied: $$g(R) = {{dR} \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{dR} {dt}}} \right. \kern-0pt} {dt}} = \left( {{{K_{g,\hbox{max} } \cdot R} \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{K_{g,\hbox{max} } \cdot R} {(R_{50} + R)}}} \right. \kern-0pt} {(R_{50} + R)}}} \right) - k_{d} \cdot R$$ (4) with K g,max as the maximum growth rate for tumor cells, and R 50 is the value of R when the growth rate equals \(\left( {{{K_{g,\hbox{max} } } \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{K_{g,\hbox{max} } } 2}} \right. \kern-0pt} 2}} \right)\) .
Simple growth inhibition models
The simplest PD model describing the cytostatic effects of a therapeutic compound on a cell was developed in the anti-infective therapeutic area by Garrett et al. [ ] for modeling the antibacterial effect of lincomycin (Fig. 2 a). The inhibitory effect of lincomycin on bacterial growth was modeled using a Hill inhibitory function. Wang et al. [ ] integrated this model into a more complex hybrid physiologically-based PK/PD/tumor growth inhibition model for the anti-cancer effects of gefitinib.

Rs malignant cells that are sensitive to the anti-cancer drug, Rr malignant cells that are resistant to the anti-cancer drug
Cell-cycle nonspecific models
In 1971, Jusko published a “simple cell-kill model” for anti-cancer drugs exhibiting mechanisms of action that are not specific to a particular phase of the cell cycle [ ]. This model simultaneously accounts for the killing action of the drug, via interaction with a cell or receptor, and the natural growth of cells. The primary model successfully described the surviving chimera of splenic and osteosarcoma cells following injection of cyclophosphamide to mice. The original and modified versions of this model continue to show utility in characterizing the cytotoxic effects of anti-cancer drugs eliciting cell death. Graphical representations for the simple cell-killing model without and with cell turnover along with their corresponding equations and are shown in Fig. 2 b, c.
A more general equation for the cell-cycle nonspecific model and cellular growth can be written as: $$\frac{dR}{dt} = g(R) - f(C) \cdot R$$ (5)
The form of the growth function g ( R ) used in this model was defined according to Eq. ( 2 ). \(f(C)\) is the plasma or effect compartment concentration driving function responsible for the irreversible cell-killing effect. Depending on the mechanism of action of the anti-cancer drug, \(f(C)\) can be linear or sigmoidal (saturable): $$f(C) = k \cdot C\,\;{\text{or}}\;\,\left( {{{K_{\hbox{max} } \cdot C} \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{K_{\hbox{max} } \cdot C} {\left( {KC_{50} + C} \right)}}} \right. \kern-0pt} {\left( {KC_{50} + C} \right)}}} \right)$$ (6) where k and K max are second-order cell-kill rate constants, and the KC 50 is the drug concentration producing 50 % of K max [ ].
Cell survival curves induced by anti-cancer agents with irreversible killing effects are commonly biphasic. The first phase delineates cell-killing (i.e., death). During this phase, the logarithmic fraction of surviving cells (log S F ) over time can be captured by a linear decay with \(slope = - k \cdot C\) . The log S F declines linearly with escalating doses and predicts AUC as major PK determinant of total response. The second phase represents the re-proliferation of malignant cells. It can be described by a positive linear slope, which occurs soon after the drug is removed from the body (i.e., C < KC 50 ). This particular biphasic trend is due to the combined bimolecular action of these compounds with malignant cells, and cell growth dynamics.
Cell-cycle specific models
In 1973, Jusko described the effect of some anti-cancer drugs that inactivate specific elements during distinct phases in the cell-cycle [ ]. Thus, the overall cell population in the tumor site will be composed of proliferating cells ( R s ) and non-proliferating or quiescent cells ( R r ). Only R s are sensitive to the cytolytic effect of the anti-cancer agent, with the cell-kill effect described with the following differential equations: $${{dR_{s} } \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{dR_{s} } {dt}}} \right. \kern-0pt} {dt}} = g(R_{s} ) - f(C) \cdot R_{s} - k_{sr} \cdot R_{s} + k_{rs} \cdot R_{r}$$ (7) $${{dR_{r} } \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{dR_{r} } {dt}}} \right. \kern-0pt} {dt}} = k_{sr} \cdot R_{s} - k_{rs} \cdot R_{r}$$ (8)
The parameters k sr and k rs are first-order rate constants and represent the inter-conversion between the two types of population cells. The model (Fig. 2 d) well captured vincristine and vinblastine effects on hematopoietic and lymphoma cells in mice. The dynamic growth of sensitive cells is often effectively captured using the logistic growth model as presented in Eq. 3 . This was well exemplified by Yano et al. [ ] for the bactericidal effects of a number of antibiotics.
The duration of drug exposure within the cell is a crucial factor determining the shape of the dose–response curve for cell-specific anti-cancer drugs. Gardner et al. [ ] proposed an exponential kill model, which was applied to in vitro data and extrapolated to clinical conditions. This model predicted the curvature of the dose–response profile based upon four elements: the cell-cycle phase specificity of the drug, the cell cycle time, the duration of exposure, and the concentration of the drug at its site of action. It also predicted the level of drug resistance through a scaling factor.
Hamed et al. [ ] proposed a more mechanistic approach to modeling the cell cycle arrest and apoptotic effects of gemcitabine in three pancreatic cancer cell lines. The mammillary compartmental model integrated several compartments, each representing a stage of distribution of cells in the cell cycle (i.e., G1, S, and G2/M), with first-order rate processes for the transition of cells among consecutive phases. Whereas the cell cycle arrest effect of gemcitabine in each of the phases is modeled as the activation of phase checkpoints that inhibit transitions among phases, the apoptotic effects of gemcitabine on cells in G1 and G2/M phases is modeled as a second-order process. However, since the model was developed for in vitro experimental data, some simplifying assumptions were made, such as cancer cell homogeneity and the lack of drug perfusion limitations. Additional considerations will be needed to extend such a model to in vivo conditions.
Transit compartment models
Transit compartment models [ ] have been widely employed for anti-cancer drugs. These models successfully describe the deferred response to drug exposure [ ], which relates time-dependent biological phenomena (e.g., intracellular signaling pathways, transduction signals, or cell maturation or differentiation processes). In transit compartment models, a single compartment may represent different cell stages or signaling events in the biological system. Therefore, the use of such models is appealing in cancer systems. Depending on the number of intermediate compartments in the model, the curvatures of the effect or the distribution of the signal can be adjusted. An increased number of transit compartments will spread out the effect of the drug on cell dynamics. Consequently, the exposure–response curve is flattened; the magnitude of the peak response is lower and shifted towards later times. In contrast, a more parsimonious number of intermediate compartments can yield greater peaks and narrower time window responses. Figure 3 shows a graphical illustration of these models.

Chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression models
Several physiologically-based models have been developed for myelosuppression secondary to anti-cancer treatments. These models share three common features: first, their structure is based on a series of transit compartments (Fig. 4 a), second, the drug exposure is the driving force for the cell-killing effect, and third, the cell survival fraction is the PD endpoint. The first chemotherapeutic-induced leukopenia model was developed by Manami et al. [ ]. The model endpoint was leukocyte survival, and the anti-cancer drug was paclitaxel. The model is comprised of two compartments, with one representing leukocytes in bone marrow and the other for circulating leukocytes in blood. The surviving cells pass from the bone marrow to the blood compartment following a first-order process. Under the effect of paclitaxel, myeloid cell synthesis in bone marrow is inhibited. In this model, the AUC is used as an indicator of drug exposure.

Friberg et al. [ ] captured the time-course of neutropenia following 12 different schedules of DMDC (2′-deoxy-2′-methylidenecytidine) using a transit compartment model with a progenitor compartment, nine transit proliferative compartments (i.e., sensitive to DMDC), and five non-proliferative compartments. According to this model, DMDC hematotoxicity was shown to be dependent on the dosing scheme, with the twice daily regimen being more leukopenic than once daily). The transit rate constants between single compartments of sensitive and non-sensitive cells were different. A comparable, but reduced version of this model was developed to capture the hematotoxicity of 5-fluorouracil employing two sensitive and two non-sensitive compartments [ ]. This model was found applicable for different doses and schedules of 5-fluorouracil. Additionally, the rebound phenomenon of the circulating leukocytes was captured through a negative feedback loop from circulating cells on their own medullary production [ ]. The same negative feedback regulation mechanism, expressed as \(\left( {{{Baseline} \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{Baseline} {Circulating\;cells}}} \right. \kern-0pt} {Circulating\;cells}}} \right)^{\gamma }\) , was implemented in a more simplified model [ ], which is comprised of a proliferating compartment (including stem and progenitor cells), three transit compartments representing maturing cells, and a compartment of circulating cells. The drug was assumed to slow the proliferation of the progenitor cells. The delayed response with respect to the dosing event of the cytolytic drug was described using several transit compartments ( n ) and a first-order transit rate constant ( k tr ). The mean maturation time for these cells can be derived as \(\tau = {{(n + 1)} \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{(n + 1)} {k_{tr} }}} \right. \kern-0pt} {k_{tr} }}\) . The full model allowed for the estimation of interpretable system-related parameters applied across several anti-cancer treatments such as docetaxel, paclitaxel, etoposide, irinotecan, and vinflunine.
Signal distribution models
The signal distribution model (SDM), depicted in Fig. 4 b, was initially developed by Lobo and Balthasar [ ] to describe the dose-dependent killing effect of methotrexate on in vitro sarcoma cells. In this model, the anti-neoplastic drug binds to its target and initiates a cascade of steps involved in the transduction of the cell-killing signal. The rate of death of the proliferating cells depends upon the intensity of the propagated signal, the magnitude of which is related to the drug concentration. Therefore, the killing effect is governed by the dispersion of the signal through the successive steps rather than the direct effect of the anti-cancer compound on the amplifying cells. Mathematically this model translates as follows: $${{dR} \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{dR} {dt}}} \right. \kern-0pt} {dt}} = g(R) - M_{4} \cdot R\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;R(0) = w(0)$$ (9) $${{dM_{1} } \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{dM_{1} } {dt}}} \right. \kern-0pt} {dt}} = {1 \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {1 \tau }} \right. \kern-0pt} \tau } \cdot \left( {{{(k_{\hbox{max} } \cdot C} \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{(k_{\hbox{max} } \cdot C} {(IC_{50} + C}}} \right. \kern-0pt} {(IC_{50} + C}})) - M_{1} } \right)\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;M_{1} (0) = 0$$ (10) $${{dM_{2} } \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{dM_{2} } {dt}}} \right. \kern-0pt} {dt}} = {1 \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {1 \tau }} \right. \kern-0pt} \tau } \cdot (M_{1} - M_{2} )\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;M_{2} (0) = 0$$ (11) $${{dM_{3} } \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{dM_{3} } {dt}}} \right. \kern-0pt} {dt}} = {1 \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {1 \tau }} \right. \kern-0pt} \tau } \cdot (M_{2} - M_{3} )\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;M_{3} (0) = 0$$ (12) $${{dM_{4} } \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{dM_{4} } {dt}}} \right. \kern-0pt} {dt}} = {1 \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {1 \tau }} \right. \kern-0pt} \tau } \cdot (M_{3} - M_{4} )\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;M_{4} (0) = 0$$ (13) where M 1 – M 4 are four transit compartments, τ is the mean transit time in any one compartment, and ( R ) represents cell count. The initial condition for R is the initial number of cancer cells w (0).
Cell distribution models
The cell distribution model, more commonly known as tumor growth inhibition (TGI), model was introduced by Simeoni et al. [ ]. It represents one of the first applications of transit compartment models in describing the time-course of tumor volumes. The TGI model as depicted in Fig. 4 c is broadly utilized in describing the delayed action of anti-neoplastic agents on the shrinkage of solid tumors. In this dynamical system, the input is the drug plasma concentration C ( t ), and the output is the tumor mass or its volume W ( t ). The model includes four transit compartments ( M 1 – M 4 ) and assumes that tumor cells are of two types: proliferating and non-proliferating. Whereas the former cell type can produce new cells by mitosis, the cells in the latter type cannot proliferate as they have been damaged and are committed to cell death. The second-order killing rate constant ( k 2 ) represents the efficacy of the anti-cancer agent to reduce the tumor growth rate and acts in association with plasma drug concentration. The measured output, W ( t ), is the net sum of both proliferating and non-proliferating cells that are not yet removed from the tumor mass. The TGI model is defined with the following differential equations and their corresponding initial conditions: $${{dM_{1} } \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{dM_{1} } {dt}}} \right. \kern-0pt} {dt}} = g\left[ {M_{1} ,W(t)} \right] - k_{2} \cdot C \cdot M_{1}\;\; M_{1} (0) = W(0)$$ (14) $${{dM_{2} } \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{dM_{2} } {dt}}} \right. \kern-0pt} {dt}} = k_{2} \cdot C \cdot M_{1} - {{M_{2} } \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{M_{2} } \tau }} \right. \kern-0pt} \tau }\;\;M_{2} (0) = 0$$ (15) $${{dM_{3} } \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{dM_{3} } {dt}}} \right. \kern-0pt} {dt}} = {1 \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {1 \tau }} \right. \kern-0pt} \tau } \cdot (M_{2} - M_{3} )\;\;M_{3} (0) = 0$$ (16) $${{dM_{4} } \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{dM_{4} } {dt}}} \right. \kern-0pt} {dt}} = {1 \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {1 \tau }} \right. \kern-0pt} \tau } \cdot (M_{3} - M_{4} )\;\;M_{4} (0) = 0$$ (17) with M 1 as the proliferating cell pool, and ( M 2 – M 4 ) refer to cell compartments committed to cell death. The tumor size is the sum of all transit compartments \(W(t) = \sum {M_{i} }\) . The \(g\left[ {M_{1} ,W(t)} \right]\) expression is the growth function for the viable dividing cells, often called “the unperturbed growth model” or “control model”: $$g\left[ {M_{1} ,W(t)} \right] = \frac{{k_{ng} \cdot M_{1} }}{{\left[ {1 + \left( {{{k_{ng} } \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{k_{ng} } {k_{ngo} }}} \right. \kern-0pt} {k_{ngo} }} \cdot W(t)} \right)^{\varPsi } } \right]^{{{1 \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {1 \psi }} \right. \kern-0pt} \psi }}} }}$$ (18) with k ngo as a zero-order growth rate constant, and \(\psi\) is fixed to large value (i.e., 20) to permit the switch of the system at a threshold tumor mass ( w th ) from first-order (exponential tumor growth) to zero-order (linear tumor growth) kinetics. The control growth function has two characteristics: $$\left\{ \begin{aligned} W(t) \approx 0\quad \quad and\quad {{k_{ng} } \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{k_{ng} } {k_{ngo} }}} \right. \kern-0pt} {k_{ngo} }} \cdot W(t) \approx 0\quad \quad Then\quad g\left[ {M_{1} ,W(t)} \right] \to k_{ng} \cdot M_{1} \quad ({\text{exponential growth}}) \hfill \\ W(t) > w_{th} \quad and\quad {{k_{ng} } \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{k_{ng} } {k_{ng0} }}} \right. \kern-0pt} {k_{ng0} }} \cdot W(t) > > > 1\quad Then\quad g\left[ {M_{1} ,W(t)} \right] \to k_{ngo} \quad \quad \;\;({\text{linear growth}}) \hfill \\ \end{aligned} \right.$$
Although the signal and cell distribution models look similar in structure (Fig. 4 b, c), these models are not always interchangeable and have unique temporal features [ ]. The cell distribution model allows for the derivation of two secondary parameters that are biologically meaningful: the time efficacy index ( TEI ) and the threshold concentration for tumor eradication ( C T ). The TEI is interpreted as the time interval required to achieve a predefined tumor weight in xenograft mice during linear growth. This delay is the time-shift of the linear growth curve of treated animals comparing to untreated animals, and the TEI can be experimentally measured [ ]. It is dependent on the AUC as calculated by the following formula: \(TEI = {{k_{2} } \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{k_{2} } {k_{ngo} }}} \right. \kern-0pt} {k_{ngo} }} \cdot AUC\) The C T is the drug plasma concentration above which the anti-neoplastic agent shows significant activity in the decrease of the tumor size. In clinical practice, C T may be considered as a therapeutic target or a reference C ss to be achieved using a certain therapy schedule. C T can be derived at C ( t ) = C ss , where \(C_{T} = {{k_{ngo} } \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{k_{ngo} } {k_{2} }}} \right. \kern-0pt} {k_{2} }}\) , if \(C_{T} > C_{ss}\) and the tumor mass reaches a steady-state value of \(W_{ss} = {{k_{ng} } \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{k_{ng} } {k_{2} }}} \right. \kern-0pt} {k_{2} }} \cdot C_{ss}\) . If \(C_{T} < C_{ss}\) , the model predicts tumor eradication independently of its initial mass. The C T can also be computed by only measuring TEI and AUC such as: \(C_{T} = {{AUC} \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{AUC} {TEI}}} \right. \kern-0pt} {TEI}}\) . These mathematical derivations and the secondary parameters are published for single and combination therapy of anti-cancer drugs [ , ].
Magni et al. [ ] developed a minimal TGI modeling approach, which includes three probabilistic assumptions at the cellular level that are modeled as independent Poisson events. These assumptions consider the time for the birth of the cell, the damage induced by the drug, and the delay between drug action and cell death. This minimal TGI modeling strategy allows for an effective translation from the characterization of the PD effect on single cancer cells to a stochastic cell population model and tumor xenograft model.
Rochetti et al. [ ] applied the TGI model to several marketed anti-cancer drugs from different therapeutic classes whose mechanisms of action are known. The potencies and C T were estimated for all the compounds. Two linear relationships with strong correlation coefficients were identified from two log–log scale plots. First, clinical systemic exposures, derived as \(AUC = {{Dose} \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{Dose} {CL_{h} }}} \right. \kern-0pt} {CL_{h} }}\) , were highly correlated with estimated preclinical potencies ( k 2 ) (r = 0.927). Dose is the midpoint dose in the range of “active clinical doses”, which were defined as cumulative doses administered during one cycle of chemotherapy, and CL h is the plasma human clearance. Second, the Dose and the product CL h × C T were also highly correlated (r = 0.939). These findings demonstrate that potencies of anti-cancer drugs in causing cell damage are directly related to the magnitude of their exposure, but independent of their mechanism of action (for the selected compounds). The authors suggest an approach whereby exploring potential relationships between TGI model parameters and drug exposure (AUC or Dose ) may provide a potential strategy for early selection of active doses for new drug candidates in humans. The parameter C T can also be utilized for scaling efficacy from preclinical studies to humans.
Physiologically-based models
Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models are useful in predicting tissue-specific exposure of anti-cancer agents in different organs including the tumor tissue. [ ]. Only few reports exist for PBPK/PD models in clinical oncology [ ]. A lack of human data, such as tissue drug concentrations, obviously limits the qualification of such models and often restricts their direct applicability to clinical studies. An integrated PBPK/PD model was constructed by Xu et al. [ ] to examine the tissue distribution and hepatic disposition characteristics of a parent drug and its active metabolite in nude mice bearing human breast tumor xenografts. The model performed well at capturing these processes and predicted higher cancer cell concentrations at steady-state than in the systemic circulation. The PD endpoints following the exposure to both parent drug and metabolite were quantified by measuring oncoprotein depletion (Raf-1 and p185 erB2 ) and heat-shock protein auto-regulation (HSP90 and HSP70). The parent and metabolite tumor drug concentrations predicted from the whole-body PBPK model were used to drive the PD. Time-dependent response variables were captured using an indirect response model for oncoprotein depletion and a molecular mechanism-based model for heat-shock protein auto-regulation. Time-dependent transduction systems were adopted to capture the time-delay in gene expression and signaling of these transcriptional factors. The model was used to estimate in vivo endogenous protein turnover of Raf-1, p185 erB2 , HSP90, and HSP70, which were comparable to in vitro measurements.
Another PBPK/PD model was developped in a xenograft mouse model of glioblastoma [ ]. The model integrated data generated through a novel brain tumor sectioning protocol, which included serial samples of gefitinib intratumor concentrations, phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK), and immunohistochemistry in four different regions of the tumor that account for the variability of the intratumor concentrations of gefitinib. A predictive PBPK/PD model was constructed and used to examine alternate dosing strategies to attain therapeutically relevant concentration and PD effects throughout the tumor. Pawaskar et al. [ ] investigated the potential beneficial pharmacological interaction of everolimus combined with sorafenib in pancreatic patient derived xenograft (PDx) mice through the use of PBPK/PD modeling. The developed model predicted a significant inhibition of cancer growth when the two agents are given alone and a complete eradication of cancer growth when given in combination. This model was the first to utilize PDx xenograft tumors in a PBPK/PD model. It opened new venues for promising drug combinations in low-passage, PDx tumors, which may serve as a better predictive tool in developing more effective treatment regimens. PDx models mostly retain the principal histological and genetic characteristics of their human donor tumor and remain stable across passages. These models have been shown to be predictive of clinical outcomes and are being used for preclinical drug evaluation, biomarker identification, biological studies, and personalized medicine strategies [ ].
Combination chemotherapy models
Combination of multiple anti-cancer drugs is of common practice in clinical oncology. Anti-cancer agents are often more effective given simultaneously or in sequence than administered alone. The objective is to induce greater targeted therapeutic responses with lower risk of undesirable effects. The main challenges and tasks with combinatorial strategies are to assess, along with the disease progression, (i) the nature of anti-cancer agents in the combination, (ii) the intensity and time-course of exposure, and (iii) the desired effect from the drug–drug interaction. Assessments of combinations are further complicated by the definition of terms that describe pharmacological interactions, such as “Loewe additivity” [ ], synergy, additivity, and antagonism, which are extensively argued and controversial.
The TGI model was successfully modified by Koch et al. to characterize the anti-cancer effect of combination therapy using time-dependent data [ ] (Fig. 4 d). This model uses a nonlinear growth function for a smoother transition from exponential to linear tumor growth in the unperturbed growth component of the model. An additional interaction term (ψ) was introduced on the signal transduction chain to describe the effect of joint therapy. Such an interaction term was previously suggested by Chakraborty and Jusko [ ] and applied to an in vitro pharmacodynamic interaction with interleukin-10 and prednisolone. As with the Loewe additivity equation [ ], the ψ parameter implies that the partial effects contributed by single agents are additive. This metric can be utilized to identify the nature and intensity of the drug–drug interaction. Depending on its value, the interaction could be either synergistic (ψ > 1), antagonistic (ψ < 1), or no interaction (ψ = 1). The potency parameters ( \(k_{2}^{a}\) and \(k_{2}^{b}\) ) obtained for single drugs (a and b) can be utilized as constants for the estimation of ψ. This estimate describes the total influence, TI ( t ), of a drug combination on tumor growth as given by the following relationship: \(TI(t) = \left( {k_{2}^{a} \cdot C_{a} (t) + k_{2}^{b} \cdot C_{b} (t) \cdot \varPsi } \right)\) , which could be easily generalized to a combination therapy of more than two drugs. The applicability of this proposed PD model may be restricted to only drugs with similar tumor cell death rates and acting with similar mechanisms of action.
The mechanistic cellular model by Zhu et al. [ ] is an exciting advancement in modeling anti-cancer drug combinations. A semi-mechanistic PD model was first constructed to evaluate the in vitro combination of gemcitabine and birinapant in pancreatic cancer cells. The model interaction parameter suggested that the drug interaction was synergistic in nature (ψ < 1). Interestingly, a second, more mechanistic model based on cell-cycle effects found that the interaction parameter approached 1, suggesting that the mechanisms of synergy were now well characterized. The analysis also identified that the optimal exposure regimen was sequential, with 24-h gemcitabine pre-treatment prior to birinapant exposure providing the best inhibition of cell proliferation.
Based on the assumption of a null pharmacodynamic interaction between drugs, Rocchetti et al. [ ] proposed another methodology for assessing the additive effect of anti-cancer agents. Derived from the initial TGI model, the proposed additive TGI model (TGI add ) assumes that at time (t), cells in the tumor site might be altered either by either or both of the administered drugs simultaneously and/or sequentially. The killing effect of drugs (a) and (b) is described by \(k_{2}^{a}\) and \(k_{b}^{2}\) . Two separate grids of transit compartments, with one for each drug, characterize the mortality chain. A total of 15 transit compartments were necessary to describe all possibilities of cell damage by the two drugs. The constants \(k_{1}^{a}\) and \(k_{1}^{b}\) are the transit rate constants through the mortality chain for each drug. Both parameters determine the time to death of the affected cells for each anti-cancer drug. However, when cells are affected by the two compounds simultaneously, time to death is governed by the greater potency of the two drugs. Assessing the additive effect of anti-cancer drugs is based on a prior determination of PK profiles (C a (t) and C b (t)) and PD parameters (w th , k ng , k ng0 , \(k_{1}^{a}\) , \(k_{1}^{b}\) , \(k_{2}^{a}\) , \(k_{2}^{b}\) ) individually for each drug. Together, PK and PD parameters are used as inputs to the TGI add model in order to compute the predicted tumor growth curve (PTGC) of the combination therapy, but assuming no interaction between the two drugs. By plotting the tumor weights versus the PTGC, a first visual inspection allows the evaluation of the nature of the interaction. Tumor weights less than the PTGC indicate a synergistic effect and tumor weights above the PTGC suggest an antagonistic interaction. There is no interaction when tumor weights are close to PTGC. A statistical evaluation based on a \(\chi^{2}\) test may be performed to determine the relevance of the additivity. This approach is flexible and offers an advantage to consider combinations of more than two agents. Using a grid of transit compartments, as introduced in the TGI add model, is fundamental for modeling the collective action of drugs with different rates for tumor cell death ( \(k_{1}^{a} \ne k_{1}^{b}\) ). The TGI add model can also serve as basis to develop a panel of drug–drug interaction models, either by including interaction factors in the equation or assuming changes in the values of drug potencies when given alone or in combination.
Translational and multiscale systems pharmacology models
Quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) is a bourgeoning modeling area. It bridges between systems biology models with more parsimonious PK/PD models, and comprises a wide variety of molecular (-omics), cellular, tissue, and whole body models [ ]. It also addresses multiple challenges in oncology drug development, such as: (i) predicting accurately the anti-cancer drug efficacy during the early stages of drug development and providing rational for treatment designs, (ii) understanding the mechanisms behind the toxicities of anti-cancer drugs, or their off-target effects, which in the majority of cases induces severe dose-limiting toxicities, and (iii) optimizing the clinical development with dose selection, identification of optimal combination dosing regimens, prediction of clinical outcomes, and selection of responsive patients as well as personalized treatments [ ].
A limited number of studies have linked QSP models to traditional PK/PD concepts and applied them to anti-cancer drugs. Owing to space limitations, we selected three examples of QSP models for this review [ , , ]. A quantitative systems approach was adopted to analyze the efficacy of the sequential combinatorial effects of paclitaxel (PAC) with a sterically stabilized liposome formulation of doxorubicin (SSL)-DXR [ ]. Using data extracted from diverse literature sources, a hybrid-physiological, well-stirred model with partition coefficients captured intra-tumor concentrations of each drug. Paclitaxel-induced apoptosis was modeled with nonlinear, time-dependent transduction functions, which served as a driving function for tumor priming. The tumor growth model used net first-order growth and death rate constants, two transit compartments captured the temporal displacement of tumor exposure versus effect, and apoptotic signals from each agent were used to drive cytotoxic effects of the combination. The final model captured plasma and intra-tumor PK data, apoptosis induction profiles, and tumor growth for all treatments and their sequences. A feedback loop representing PAC-induced apoptosis on the partition coefficients of SSL-DXR (Kp_DXR) enabled the model to capture tumor-priming, in which pacliatxel pre-treatment enhances the deposition of SSL-DXR. Simulations to explore time- and sequence-dependent effects of priming suggested that a time window of 24 h of paclitaxel administration prior to SSL-DXR could increase efficacy 2.5-fold over experimentally reported results.
In a second example, an integrated QSP model for CD20 signaling in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma was developed that integrates critical factors determining antitumor efficacy of rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, alone and in combination with fenretinide or recombinant human Apo2 ligand (rhApo2L) [ ]. The model incorporated key regulatory mechanisms induced by the CD20 occupancy, such as: (i) the target-mediated disposition of rituximab, (ii) the regulation of apoptosis through the CD20 intracellular signaling, and (iii) the relative efficacy of death receptor isoforms. The tumor responses from each agent were linked to their mechanisms of action, and the pharmacodynamic temporal changes of some critical proteins, such as Bcl-xL and Fas, were linked to in vivo responses to explain the apparent synergy of these drugs. Model predictions of tumor progression profiles using the final multiscale model agreed well with cell-based data and tumor growth profiles in mice bearing xenograft tumors. The synergistic anti-tumor responses of these agents were predicted well, and this approach may provide a mechanism-based platform for exploring new regimens with CD20 agonists. The use of reduced signaling networks as a bridge between drug exposure and tumor growth profiles is a promising approach to building multiscale models of anti-cancer agents [ ].
One promise of QSP modeling is that these more complete models of drug action may provide a framework for understanding and predicting clinical outcomes in patients exhibiting complex phenotypes. In a proof of concept study, Iyengar et al. [ ] built a multiscale systems model that integrates a reduced signaling network for EGFR with cell- and tissue-level phenomena. The so-called enhanced pharmacodynamic (ePD) model incorporated biochemical reactions linked to cell proliferation and tumor size trajectories. Four sources of genomic and epigenomic variability among subjects were specified, and model simulations of drug efficacy (i.e., tumor shrinkage over time) were performed to assess the impact of the genomic covariates on clinical outcomes. The model showed that combinations of the patient characteristics influenced therapy, manifesting as complete, partial, and non-responders. It is questionable whether a traditional population-based modeling approach could be used to identify the complex relationships between patient characteristics and the variability in model parameters. Coupling QSP models with molecular sources of variability is a promising approach to achieving precision and/or personalized medicine. Although a relatively small study, Lindner et al. suggest that QSP models and feedback measurements of critical protein expression from patient tumors can be used to understand individual responses to chemotherapy in colorectal cancer patients [ ].
Survival models
Analysis of cancer survival data and related outcomes is necessary to assess cancer treatment efficacy. In a study by Wang et al. [ ], a relationship between the percentage tumor-size reduction from baseline at week 8 (PTR wk8 ) and the survival of patients suffering from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was established. The authors concluded that the PTR wk8 metric might be useful as an early biomarker for the prediction of overall survival to assist in early drug development decisions. A relatively similar approach by Claret et al. [ ] identified the change in tumor size from baseline at week 7 as a predictor of overall survival in colorectal cancer patients. The authors also conducted a comparison analysis on the performance of two metrics as predictors of overall survival, namely: the tumor size reduction at week 6 and the time to tumor growth (TTG) in patients with colorectal cancer [ ]. The TTG metric was shown to be the superior predictor. However, non-linear mixed effect model-based simulations by Ribba et al. [ ] demonstrated that using either metrics (i.e., tumor size reduction from baseline at a defined time point or TTG) could be problematic in making appropriate drug development decisions due to the type I error rate. These findings were challenged by Claret et al. [ ], via model-based simulations investigating five senarios with different survival variables to test the validity of TTG as a superior predictor of overall patient survival, which has been further confirmed [ , , , ].
Prospectus
Screening and identifying promising new candidates are primary goals in drug discovery; however, the success rate in the development of new drugs in oncology is the lowest compared to other therapeutic areas. The inherent complex nature of tumor cell biology and the limited translation of mouse-bearing tumor systems are major factors contributing to the disappointing outcomes of anti-cancer lead compounds. However, given the growing knowledge in tumor systems biology, genetics, and disease predictive endpoints, merging QSP models with PK/ePD models provides a powerful tool to integrate all available multiscale and multiplatform information throughout the process of anti-cancer drug development and to predict drug toxicities and drug effects on cancer systems. Here, we summarized the utility and applicability of such complex mathematical models at leveraging the understanding of pharmacological and toxicological effects of anti-cancer drugs and their interplay with cancer biology.
Mathematical models can be used to guide the selection of the first-in-human (FIH) dose, determination of biologically active dose, the subsequent escalating dose levels, dosing schedules, maximal tolerated doses (MTD), and dose selections for drug combination trials. The usefulness of integrated QSP/PK/e PD models rests in establishing the link between anti-cancer drug exposure and the ensuing efficacy, tolerability, and toxicity through mathematical expressions that account for both drug characteristics, such as efficacy and potency, and tumor properties, such as rates of cancer cell growth and death. As an example, scaling laws for extrapolating plasma concentrations and tolerable doses from animals to humans, and even among populations of the same species of different sizes, are established [ ]. These scaling laws effectively predicted the PK time-course of capecitabine and zebularine in monkeys from mouse experiments, as well as bevacizumab in combination with capecitabine [ ]. A comprehensive PK/PD model quantifying the effect of serdemetan on QT interval in a FIH study indicated that twice-daily dosing increased the safety margin for QT c effects, as compared to once-daily or less frequent dosing for the suggested therapeutic range [ ]. Furthermore, based upon model predicted exposure and potency, the MTD for vinflurine was determined at 300 mg/m 2 [ ]. Consequently, the FIH dose for the phase I trial was about 30 mg/m 2 , and after ascending the doses up to the MTD, the latter reached 400 mg/m 2 , which was similar to the recommended dose (350 mg/m 2 ). The model-based predictions of AUC and terminal half-life for vinflurine were in agreement with values from observed measurements. In this clinical trial, the PK/PD model-based dose-ascension approach assisted in designing a single escalating dose study. Furthermore, a stochastic modeling approach was established as an alternative strategy to the classical Fibonacci method for dose escalation in chemotherapeutic trials [ ], and a model-based approach to determine the MTD for dose-toxicity relationships [ ] allowed for the identification of an optimal dosing schedule, escalation, and study design.
PK/PD modeling and simulation has been regularly used to support the selection of combination regimens for better optimization of the therapeutic response. As reviewed, modeling has been a reliable means for assessing the nature of drug–drug interactions: synergistic, additive, or antagonistic effects [ ]. Numerous approaches have been used to qualify and quantify in vitro cytotoxic effects, such as the Drewinko score method [ ] and combination index isobolograms [ ]. However, these methods may be strongly influenced by experimental conditions and endpoints, constraining the translation of the estimated metrics across different study designs [ ]. Alternatively, Greco et al. [ ] suggested a “Universal Response Surface” (URS) approach that allows a full parametric characterization of the drug interaction describing the response surface in a detailed manner, and the URS has been used to characterize PD interactions. Nevertheless, concerns have been overcome with PK/PD models that incorporate temporal information, such as the Koch et al. model [ ], which yields an estimate of an interaction parameter (ψ) relating the nature of the chemotherapeutic interactions. Because this metric relates on drug exposure, it permits the optimization of therapeutic schemes and extends the applicability of this model to more than dual anti-cancer combinations. Similarly, combination regimens of anti-cancer drugs with modulators that promote the antitumor effect at the site of action have assisted in optimizing the dosing regimen of malphalan and buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), where the latter enhances the efficacy of the former. The PD modeling demonstrated greater antitumor effect of a 12 h time interval for six doses of BSO [ ].
Modeling can be used to anticipate active biological doses (ABD) in humans from tumor xenograft experiments [ ]. The ABD can be predicted based on correlations between drug-specific metrics, such as ( TEI ) and ( C T ) [ ], with the administered doses of anti-cancer agents and their systemic exposures. This approach allowed close predictions of ABD comparing known values for various anti-cancer compounds, such as: etoposide, 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan, paclitaxel, gemcitabine, cisplatin, docetaxel, doxorubicin, vinblastin, and vincristine. This method could be extended to a wider range of oncology drug candidates and help improve drug discovery and development processes, and the predicted ABD can support decisions of crossing to subsequent phases of development. Importantly, non-promising anti-cancer drugs can be discarded earlier during the clinical development process, which length could be shortened and costs considerably reduced.
In their cancer progression model, Wang et al. [ ] identified the change of tumor size at 8 weeks as a significant and sensitive predictor of time to death for NSCLC patients under first-line therapy. Whereas this model closely predicted known estimates of median survival times for various anti-cancer drugs, it under predicted the relative survival benefit. Similarly, Swanson et al. [ ] identified the size and the gradient of concentrations of glioblastoma cells by MR imaging as predictors of the outcome of individual patients with glioblastoma. The superimposed simulated and observed survival curves from patients subjected to biopsy, subtotal resection, or gross total resection were close. Claret et al. [ , ] identified the TTG as a superior metric in predicting patient overall survival over the change in tumor size at any given time during the course of disease. These findings support the use of longitudinal tumor size and TTG as endpoints in early clinical oncology studies.
Pharmacological responses to anti-cancer drugs frequently exhibit large variability partly caused by patient-related and/or drug-related factors (i.e., covariates). The search for influential covariates over the phases of drug development is essential for guiding drug development, labeling, and ultimate clinical use. For example, a PD model that differentiated between system-specific and drug-specific parameters [ ] showed an agreement in the covariate relationships for docetaxel, paclitaxel, and etoposide, in which baseline neutrophils were lower for women, and neutrophil mean maturation times were similar in both genders. This valuable information can be useful in individualizing and guiding adjusted dosing regimens for these compounds, as compared to the conventional administration of anti-cancer agents based upon patient body surface area. Other covariates that can be considered for optimal dosage of anti-cancer drugs that maximize anti-cancer drug effect and minimize treatment related toxicity are: age, race, renal and hepatic functions, total plasma protein concentrations, genetic polymorphisms, and concomitant medications. In assessing the impact of genetic polymorphisms of cytotoxic drug transporters and metabolizing enzymes on PK and PD parameters, a pharmacogenetic evaluation of indisulam revealed an attenuation of its clearance with mutations on CYP2C9*3, CYP2C19*2, and CYP2C19*3 genes [ ]. Accordingly, a pharmacogenetically guided dosing adjustment was suggested based upon simulations evaluating the relative risk of indisulam dose-limiting neutropenia [ ]. A review by Joerger et al. [ ] lists several population covariate models and discuss their clinical relevance and potential implications in the oncology therapeutic area.
The emergence of clinical resistance to anti-neoplastic therapies is one of the major concerns in cancer treatment. Such resistance, reversible or irreversible, can be either intrinsic to tumor cells regardless of the treatment, or acquired, triggered by the anti-cancer agent itself. Various alterations such as genetic, cytological, pharmacokinetic, or biochemical processes are commonly responsible for drug resistance [ ]. Empirical PD models describing in vitro cytotoxic effects of anti-cancer drugs showed that it is possible to modulate drug resistance [ ]. An integrated PD model of antimicrobial drugs, with two bacterial subpopulation dynamics (i.e., susceptible and resistant) quantified through the estimate of their killing and growth rate constants, predicted the onset of resistance to antibiotics such as β-lactames [ ]. Mechanism-based models that differentiate tumor cell subpopulations with different drug susceptibilities ought to be developed. Such models would be appropriate to oncologic targets showing chemoresistance properties [ ].
Computational multiscale systems PK/ePD models that account for molecular and cellular mechanisms of tumor progression are emerging. Challenges include the complexity of processes in cancer systems biology, such as: intracellular signal transduction networks, feedback loops, and growth patterns, which for most systems are not fully known and lack experimental measurements. However, when available, QSP/PK/ePD models can improve understanding of the disease as a whole [ ]. For example, flexible signaling network models developed for cytokine-induced apoptosis, more particularly for Fas type I and II signaling pathways [ ], correlated the effect of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein levels with the switch of cascade signaling from type II (sensitive to Bcl-2 up-regulation) to type I (insensitive to Bcl-2 up-regulation). Other network models, such as for IFN ß [ ] signaling pathways activated by oncolytic viruses, have been developed along with models describing the dynamics of cancer cells under oncolytic virotherapy [ ]. Moreover, an integrated PD model incorporating gene-dependent cell-cycle regulation has been reported for the P53 protein signaling network [ ]. Whereas contemporary anti-cancer drugs often specifically target isolated proteins, proteomic methods have shown that proteins function in complex networks. Furthermore, anti-cancer drugs interact with a wide range of unexpected proteins, leading to pleiotropic effects on multi-complex protein networks. Subsequently, the individual efficacy/response and patient therapeutic outcomes may be affected. In addition, the intricate cross talk among signaling pathways of various system networks allow for connections between different types of cells, such as the tumor site, the surrounding angiogenic micro-environment, and the extracellular matrix. Hence, modeling of cancer dynamics using network-based approaches can contribute to drug development and scheduling adjustments by generating biologically-based and testable hypotheses. Advances in sensitive and reliable measurement techniques such as mass spectroscopy, flow cytometry, and imaging, have made low protein level quantification possible, and thus systems biology and pharmacology modeling has become feasible, leading to a better understanding of cell signaling networks and possibly a framework for scaling preclinical tumor-based models translating results to the clinic [ ].
