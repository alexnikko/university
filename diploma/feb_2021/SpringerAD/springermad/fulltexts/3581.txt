Introduction
Skin cancer is a major health problem worldwide. It is the most common malignant tumour affecting humans and among those most costly to healthcare systems [ , ]. In recent decades, the incidence of skin cancer has tripled, mainly as a consequence of recreational sun exposure habits among the white population, but also due to the progressive ageing of the population and the depletion of the ozone layer [ ].
The Costa del Sol, on the southern coast of Spain, is a popular destination for sun and beach tourism. With over 300 days of sunshine per year and a residential population that is 30 % of foreign origin (mainly from the UK, Germany and Scandinavia) [ ], the Costa del Sol is also a fertile ground for skin cancer. Indeed, the incidence of melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer in this geographic area is one of the highest in the country [ , ], and consequently, the healthcare costs of skin cancer are a major burden on the public health system [ ]. In recent years, various healthcare interventions in the Costa del Sol have targeted high-risk groups such as beachgoers [ ], those who work or play on golf courses [ ], and adolescents [ ], in order to raise awareness of the risk of skin cancer and to promote healthy sun exposure habits.
Educating the population to adopt healthy sun exposure habits is the best strategy for the prevention of skin cancer. In this respect, healthcare professionals play an essential role, as educators, as a model to society of health-related behaviour [ ] and in developing prevention strategies in the community [ ].
This paper describes attitudes and habits with respect to sun exposure among public-sector healthcare personnel working in the Costa del Sol, with a twofold aim: to identify the main risk factors for sunburn and to plan future interventions aimed at this population group to promote the prevention of skin cancer in our community.
Material and Method
As part of the sun exposure and skin cancer prevention campaign “Enjoy the Sun” promoted by the Costa del Sol healthcare agency and the Costa del Sol healthcare district, a cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted in the Costa del Sol healthcare area during the period May–September 2012, focused on sun exposure practices and habits and on attitudes to tanning and sun protection. The study was carried out using a self-administered questionnaire, distributed to healthcare professionals working at various levels and in different institutions.
This previously validated “Beach Questionnaire” inquired into demographic variables (age, sex, marital status, having children aged under 12 years, educational qualifications), phototype (I–IV), sun exposure habits, practices and attitudes and sunburn events. The respondents were also asked about their workplace situation, occupation and previous collaboration with sun exposure campaigns [ ].
All the data compiled were recorded anonymously, in strict accordance with the laws and rules on data protection currently in force (Act 41/2002 of 14 November; Act 15/1999 of 15 December).
The questionnaire items concerning practices and attitudes (grouped by four underlying dimensions) were used to calculate base-100 standardised scores (in a positive sense regarding implementation or motivation).
Statistical Analysis
A descriptive analysis was performed, using measures of central tendency and dispersion for the quantitative variables and of frequency distribution for the qualitative ones. The segmentation variables analysed were, on one hand, the occupational groups (nurses and physicians) and the workplace situation (hospitals and primary healthcare clinics), and on the other, the remaining variables included in the study, using the chi-square test for the qualitative variables and the Student t test for the quantitative ones. Finally, a multivariate logistic regression model was constructed, taking as the outcome variable, the presence of at least one sunburn event during the previous summer, and including the variables found to be unbalanced in previous divariate analysis. For this forward stepwise model, an input criterion of 0.05 and an output criterion of 0.1 were applied. The odds ratio (OR) was determined, for a 95 % confidence interval. The goodness of fit of the model was assessed by Nagelkerke’s R 2 , and its classification accuracy was determined.
Results
During the 2012 sun protection campaign, a questionnaire was completed by 643 workers in primary or in specialised healthcare centres in the Costa del Sol. Of these respondents, 450 were medical staff, of whom 52.9 % were assigned to the Costa del Sol primary healthcare district, and the remaining 47.1 % to hospitals administered by the Costa del Sol health agency.
A total of 308 (68 %) of the medical personnel (MP) were female, with a mean age of 42.2 (9.1) years. The majority were married or in a civil partnership (66.3 %), and 42.1 % of respondents had non-adult children (Table 1 ).

A total of 63 % of MP had a skin phototype III or IV. Regarding sun exposure habits, 101 (23.1 %) had spent at least 30 days at the beach during the previous summer, and 121 (27 %) had been exposed to three or more hours of sunshine during the midday hours. One hundred eighty-one (40.8 %) had suffered at least one sunburn event during the previous summer.
The sun protection practices most commonly used were sunscreen creams (84.2 %), sunglasses (72.9 %) and the use of shade or a sun umbrella. The average score for sun protection practices was 61.7 (SD 17.1) points. With respect to the four scales for attitudes, the highest score was obtained for attitude to sun protection practices, with a mean score of 78.6 (SD 18.3), followed by the attitude to the use of sunscreen creams (mean score 71.8, SD 23.1).
Among the healthcare personnel questioned, 226 (50.2 %) were nurses or nursing auxiliary staff, and the remaining 224 were doctors. The comparison of occupational groups revealed differences by sex ( p < 0.001): 83.2 % of the nurses were female, compared with 52.7 % of the doctors. The mean age of the nurses (43.4; SD 8.8) was higher than that of the doctors (41; SD 9.2). There were also differences in sun exposure habits at the beach: 15.3 % of the doctors went to the beach at least 30 days a year, while 30.9 % of the nurses did so ( p < 0.001) (Table 2 ).

With respect to the place of work, MP in hospitals (MP-H) were younger (mean 38.1; SD 8.2) than those working in primary care (MP-P), who had a mean age of 45.9 years (SD 8.1). Marked differences in population distribution by marital status were also found; 75.3 % of MP-P were married, compared to 57.3 % of MP-H ( p < 0.001). There were also differences between the two groups as regards sun exposure habits at the beach ( p = 0.019); among MP-H, 28.3 % went to the beach more than 30 days each summer, compared to 18.5 % of MP-P. With respect to sunburn events experienced by these population groups, there were significant differences ( p < 0.001) between MP-H (52.4 %) and MP-P (30.4 %). Finally, there were differences in the respective attitudes toward the use of sunscreen creams ( p = 0.014), in which respect the average score of MP-P (74.4; SD 22.5) was higher than that of MP-H (69; SD 23.5) (Table 3 ).

In the multivariate logistic regression analysis conducted to assess the risk of having suffered one or more sunburn events during the previous summer, the following variables were included in the multivariate model: workplace situation (MP-H OR 2.8; 95 % CI 1.7–4.6); phototype (I–II OR 1.6; 95 % CI 1.74–4.6); the practice of avoiding sun exposure during midday hours (non-habitual, OR 2.4; 95 % CI 1.5–3.9); the practice of wearing a sun hat (non-habitual, OR 1.8; 95 % CI 1.1–2.9); and the attitude toward the use of sunscreen creams, in which respect a positive attitude was associated with a reduced risk ( β = −0.011) (Table 4 ). The model obtained a goodness of fit of 0.184 and correctly classified 65.8 % of the individuals (75.4 % for the absence of sunburn and 53.1 % for its presence).

Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study at a national or international level to reflect differences in sun exposure and protection practices and attitudes among healthcare personnel in the field of primary and specialised care and to determine the factors that influence risk behaviours in this target population.
Both groups are essential to health promotion and their role as health educators could be of crucial importance in primary prevention campaigns focused on sun protection [ , ]. Our study highlights the existence of clinically relevant differences between the two main areas in which public healthcare is provided and also in the occupational categories of the medical personnel involved.
Our study shows that nurses spend longer exposure to the sun, but they also use better sunscreen practices than doctors. We corroborate the findings of previous research that nurses are insufficiently aware of the importance of sun exposure in the development of skin cancer and that their sun exposure habits remain strongly rooted [ , ]. However, our study is the first to compare the two occupational groups using a sufficiently representative sample and using the same tool (the Beach Questionnaire); this approach led us to conclude that doctors have healthier sun exposure habits [ ].
We also observed that healthcare personnel in primary care have healthier sun exposure habits, with less sun exposure in the summer, fewer sunburn events and a positive attitude towards the use of sun protection creams than those working in specialised care.
Previous studies have shown that although doctors, especially those who work in the field of primary care, are well aware of sun protection recommendations, their sun protection practices continue to be inadequate, and therefore, campaigns conducted during the initial stage of medical training are needed to further promote awareness of this question [ , ].
The following major risk factors, predictive of sunburn, were observed in healthcare professionals: working in a hospital, rather than in primary healthcare; not avoiding sun exposure in the midday hours; not wearing a sun hat; having a light-skinned phototype; and having a negative attitude toward the use of sunscreen cream. These results enable us to reliably describe the profile of healthcare personnel more likely to suffer sunburn. This subgroup of MP could be targeted for future intervention strategies in healthcare settings, aimed at reinforcing healthy attitudes toward sun protection practices and at improving sun exposure habits [ ].
MP-P have the advantage of access to a large client population at which to address health promotion measures, including those specifically aimed at preventing the development of skin cancer through the adoption of healthy sun protection practices. Thus, MP-P dedicate much of their daily activity to the application of positive, direct measures to reinforce awareness and understanding of primary prevention among the population served daily at public health centres. Their own good practices regarding sun exposure make them well placed to participate in campaigns to promote sun protection and prevent skin cancer among the population.
However, it has been shown that it is not just a higher level of knowledge and training among medical personnel, but their adoption of healthy habits and practices in general that increases patients’ perceptions and acceptance from MP of the message of necessary sun protection [ , ].
Few studies have been made of the habits and practices of healthcare personnel with respect to sun protection [ , ], and most of those we have consulted focus on the populations most at risk, such as adolescents [ ], outdoor workers [ ] and athletes who train and perform outdoors. All of these groups present higher rates of sunburn and riskier sun exposure and protection practices [ ].
Guile et al. [ ] carried out a cross-sectional study using self-administered, anonymous questionnaires completed by members of different social groups in the healthcare field, including cancer nurses and medical students. It was found that these subjects, despite their better understanding of the importance of appropriate sun protection measures and their awareness of the habits that favour the development of skin cancer, were not significantly different from the general population as regards their sun exposure habits and attitudes.
Darling et al. [ ] described sun exposure habits in three distinct social groups: 28 primary care physicians, 28 nurses and 52 patients. These authors observed that despite the importance of health promotion and secondary prevention, the nurses and young doctors did not differ from the patients with respect to rates of sunburn or positive attitudes to sun exposure. The greater awareness of skin cancer and of sun protection measures among healthcare personnel than among other population groups does not seem to be enough for them to change behaviour patterns or to convey the right message to the people attended in the framework of health promotion [ , ]. Accordingly, future sun protection campaigns should be directed at medical staff, especially in the early years of their training, in order to change attitudes and thus future behaviour [ , ].
In conclusion, by making use of a validated instrument such as the Beach Questionnaire, applied to a representative and varied sample of healthcare workers, we show that medical staff in primary healthcare attention (MP-P) are key targets for future public health strategies, while hospital staff (MP-H) constitute a subgroup that is more liable to suffer sunburn, and therefore, strategies should be devised and applied to encourage a change in their attitudes, sun exposure habits and sun protection practices [ , , , ].
Among other limitations, the present study is subject to possible selection bias, as we recruited healthcare personnel in a geographic area, the Costa del Sol, which presents specific climate and epidemiologic characteristics that make it difficult to extrapolate and compare the results obtained with those for healthcare populations elsewhere. Furthermore, this study is based on behaviour patterns, which are known to be affected by social desirability, and thus are variable. Nevertheless, despite the lack of precise data on the sun protection knowledge of the persons taking part in this study, the information obtained about their attitudes is of great importance and allows us to identify the basis for future action to achieve healthier behaviour patterns among medical staff with respect to sun exposure.
These findings highlight the importance of examining and understanding sun protection and exposure habits, practices and attitudes among healthcare personnel in order to target those who could best take part in future sun protection campaigns, as key agents in health promotion interventions in the community.
