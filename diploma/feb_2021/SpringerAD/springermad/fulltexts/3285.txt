INTRODUCTION
The twentieth century was marked by great advances in the treatment of infectious diseases leading to tremendous reduction of mortality and morbidity rate associated with these diseases. These advances occurred due to the large-scale production of antimicrobial agents and new formulation strategies that increased the therapeutic efficacy of the antimicrobials ( ). However, antimicrobial resistance has grown dramatically, and pressure was mounted on the discovery of new and more effective antimicrobials to fight resistant strains of microbes. The use of the term “post-antibiotic era” is no longer a prognosis, but a prosaic reality frequently verified in the hospital environment, leading to the longer hospital stay of patients and higher medical cost involved ( ).
Nanotechnology appears to be a promising tool to overcome these limitations, which can contribute in different ways to the development of more effective and less toxic antimicrobials. Furthermore, nanocarriers are promising that increase drug delivery time at the site of action, thereby reducing (increasing the interval of administration between doses) administration time between doses and promoting drug adherence.
Silver has been widely used since antiquity as a therapeutic agent for many diseases. In fact, even before the start of antibiotic therapy, silver was used because of its antiseptic activity, specifically for the treatment of open wounds and burns. Nanosilver, in the form of silver nanoparticles (AgNps), has demonstrated remarkable antimicrobial properties against various pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi. The mechanism of antimicrobial activity demonstrated by AgNps is still partially understood. However, it is believed that AgNps act on biological membranes and damage DNA, which are among the main reasons ( ).
Curcumin (CUR) extracted from the roots of Curcuma longa is an active component. Curcumin was first isolated in 1815, while its chemical structure was determined in 1973 by Roughley and Whiting ( ). The curcuminoids present in curcumin are natural agents with a variety of bioactivities such as anticancer, antiinflammatory, antioxidant, and antibacterial ( ). Curcumin is a pleiotropic substance and the molecule is capable of interacting with multiple targets involved in the inflammatory reaction such as tumor, necrosis factor α (TNFα), and interleukins (ILs). Curcumin has also demonstrated in vitro activity against a wide range of pathogenic microorganisms including fungi, Gram-positive, and Gram-negative bacteria ( ). Curcumin is able to restore bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics, inhibiting biofilm formation and making microorganisms more sensitive to antibiotics ( ). Thus, it has been found that its antibacterial action is synergistic when it is associated with other antibiotics, such as cefixime, vancomycin, and tetracyclines ( , ). Despite the huge therapeutic potential, the low aqueous solubility of curcumin affects its biodiponability, and therefore, solid dispersions is a novel strategy to enhance its solubility in water.
Combinations of curcumin with other antimicrobials have shown to be effective against multidrug resistant bacteria (MDR) such as A. baumannii ( ). Recently, curcumin combination therapy with other antimicrobials has been proposed for the treatment of cutaneous infections caused by MDR bacteria. Using combination therapy, efficacy of antibiotics such as polymyxins could be enhanced ( ).
Curcumin exhibits strong antioxidant activity comparable to vitamins C and E. It has proven antiinflammatory as well as a potent absorbing effect of reactive oxygen species including superoxide anionic and hydroxyl radicals ( ).
Gel-forming thermosensitive formulations are good controlled drug delivery system. They are of great interest because of their biocompatible properties and their solution-gel transition (Tsol-gel) at physiological temperature. Poloxamer (P407) is non-ionic triblock copolymers composed of central hydrophobic chain of PPO (polyoxypropylene (poly-propylene oxide) flanked by two hydrophilic chains of PEO (polyoxyethylene (poly-ethylene oxide) ( ). PEO/PPO ratio of 2:1 by weight is able to reach the maximum peak in viscosity between 30 and 50°C depending on polymer concentration. The P407 in the sol state at low temperature allows drug molecules or drug nanoparticles disperse and remain stabilized sufficiently. Another important aspect is the possibility to solubilize hydrophobic drugs with amphiphilic nature. In a recent study, Sezgin et al . ( ) reported the solubilization behavior of three poorly water soluble anticancer agents in some poloxamers and suggested that these systems are effective new drug carriers.
The objective of this work was to develop a formulation composed of a thermoresponsive gel with antimicrobial and antioxidant properties promoted by the combination of AgNps with curcumin.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), and sodium citrate (Cit) were used for the synthesis /stabilization of AgNps (Sigma-Aldrich). Silver Nitrate (AgNO 3 ) (Synth from Brazil) was chosen as the initial silver precursor. Citric acid (Sigma-Aldrich, Brazil) was used as a reducing agent for all processes, and also has a stabilizing action of AgNps. Curcumin (Sigma-Aldrich) and poloxamer 407 (Sigma-Aldrich) was chosen due to its biopharmaceutical properties; Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) culture medium was also purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Brazil.
Methods
CUR Solid Dispersion Preparation
Solid dispersion (SD) was prepared by co-precipitation as described by Alves ( ). To obtain the SD by the co-precipitation process, suitable amounts of CUR and poloxamer P407 (P 407) were weighed and dispersed separately in 95% ethanol. The ethanolic dispersions were mixed for a ratio of 1:1, 1:2, and 2:1 m / m for CUR/P407. The solvent was evaporated under pressure of (−650 mmHg) at the temperature of 50 ± 2°C using rotary evaporator (TE-211, TECNAL, Piracicaba, Brazil). The SD was kept at room temperature for cooling. Later, SD was sprayed and standardized in 60 mesh (250 mm) sieves. The SD obtained was stored in a desiccator, set with silica, and kept under the light at room temperature for further use.
The Formulations of the Hydrogels
Hydrogel containing 2 g of P407 was prepared as described by Schomolka ( ) and was dispersed in citrate and phosphate buffer pH 4.5 and maintained at 4°C in a thermostat bath (Brookfield-TC 550, Massachusetts, USA) until a clear solution (10 mL) was obtained. Subsequently, 3 mL of AgNps solution (0.024 mg/mL) stabilized by different polymers were combined with the gel in the presence of 4 mg CUR-SD (400 μg/mL of CUR) to a final volume of 13 mL.
Synthesis of Silver Nanoparticles
In the jacketed reactor, 250 mL of deionized water was taken, and heated at 80°C. Under stirring and controlled temperature, 45 mg of silver nitrate (AgNO 3 ) and 135 mg of polymer mass were added, which according to the process was PVA or PVP. In the aqueous solution, silver nitrate was subjected to reduction using 1% aqueous sodium citrate solution (volume added to the reactor equal to 10 mL using peristaltic pump) under constant heating and stirring (0.5 M ratio of silver nitrate to 0.34 M sodium citrate). After 50 min of reaction, the process was terminated and the particles were removed as described by Santos et al . ( ).
Determination of Minimum Inhibitory Concentration
The antimicrobial efficacy of AgNps combined with CUR SD was assessed by the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) method. The antimicrobial efficacy was tested against the final concentration of 10 6 UFC/mL of the microorganisms (MO) (USPXXXII) ( ). The MIC is expressed as a function of the dilution percentage of the formulations studied. All assays were performed in triplicate.
Bacterial Strains
The test bacteria Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9721 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 10390 were grown in TSB. Culture medium (30 mL) was added in 250-mL Erlenmeyer flasks incubated in a shaker at 100 rpm and 37°C for 24 h. The medium was prepared by using distilled water, and sterilized at 121°C for 20 min.
Sample Preparation
A sample of each formulation (1 μL) was added to a 96-well plate containing 1 mL of TSB culture medium and 100 μL of MO at 10 6 UFC/mL concentration. Successive dilutions (Fig. 1 ) of the AgNps were performed in 10 wells (containing 1 mL of culture medium and 100 μL of 10 6 UFC/mL concentration) in descending order of concentration. Two control wells were also maintained: one corresponding to the positive control (culture medium + MO, in the absence of CUR SD/AgNps) and a negative control (culture medium + CUR SD/AgNps) (Fig. 1 ). The similar procedure was performed for AGNPs and for PVA, PVP polymers, individually, to assess their inhibitory effect on MO, if any.

Characterization
Silver nanoparticles added into formulation showed medium size of 52 nm and zeta potential −20 MeV.
Antioxidant Activity
The methodology is based on the reaction between the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH) and the compounds under study, producing a decrease in absorbance at 515 nm, which indicates the antioxidant activity of the substance.
Based on the MIC results, aliquots of 250 μL of each formulation (Table I ) were added to 750 μL of ethanolic solution (70% v / v ) of 0.1 mM DPPH. The absorbance at 515 nm was measured at times zero, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min. As a control, 250 μL of 70% ethanol was added to 750 μL of DPPH solution. The experiment was carried out in triplicate. Table I Formulations Made with Poloxamers (P407), Curcumin (CUR), Nanopartículas de Prata (AgNps), Polivinil Álcool (PVA), and Polivinilpirrolidona (PVP) Formulations Study combinations 1 P407 + CURSD + AgNps-citrate 2 P407 + AgNps citrate 3 P407 + AgNps PVP 4 P407 + AgNps PVA 5 P407 + CURSD + AgNp-PVA 6 P407 7 P407 + CURSD + AgNps-PVP
The ability of the substance to sequester the DPPH moiety is expressed as percent inhibition, calculated according to the following equation: $$ \%\mathrm{Inhibition}=\frac{{\mathrm{Abs}}^1-{\mathrm{Abs}}^2}{{\mathrm{Abs}}^1} $$
Where, Abs 1 control absorbance Abs 2 sample absorbance
An antioxidant standard was also evaluated for comparative purpose. Reduced glutathione (GSH), the body’s main antioxidant, was tested as DPPH scavenger at a concentration of 0.150 mg/mL. Data are reported as mean ± standard deviation ( n = 3). The results were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey test to identify differences among the formulations. Differences with a value of <0.05 were considered to be significant. The results were analyzed using Statistica version 8.0 (Dell, Round Rock, TX, USA) and GraphPad Prism version 6.0 (San Diego, CA, USA).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Minimum Inhibitory Concentration Determination
When antimicrobial efficacy of the formulations (Table II ) against the Gram-negative P. aeruginosa was evaluated, the maximum inhibition was demonstrated by formulation P407 + AgNps_PVA; while the formulations P407 + AgNps_PVP and P407 + AgNps_PVA showed higher activity against E. coli . For the Gram-positive S. aureus , the formulations showed the least efficacy. The best performance was observed for P407 + CURSD + AgNps_Citrate. The obtained result in the presence of CUR-SD + AgNps combination showed resemblance with the findings of Vimla et al . ( ), who reported the fabrication of film containing curcumin-chitosan silver nanoparticles. It was found that antimicrobial activity of curcumin-silver nanoparticles film was more effective against Gram-negative bacteria as compared to Gram-positive bacteria. Linh et al . ( ) also formulated silver nanoparticles embedded curcumin agar film and reported significant antibacterial activity of film against both Gram-negative ( Escherichia coli ) and Gram-positive bacteria ( Staphylococcus aureus ). El Khoury et al . ( ) reported conjugation of curcumin with silver nanoparticles and claimed potential antibacterial activity of curcumin-silver conjugate. The variation in antimicrobial activity of AgNps-CUR-SD might be due to the difference in the membrane structure and composition of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria possess less peptidoglycan layer as compared to Gram-positive bacteria. Due to less peptidoglycan content, AgNp-CUR SD can easily weaken and break bacterial cell wall ( ). In our previous study, we also observed a better antimicrobial activity of AgNps against Gram-negative bacteria, the fact that was observed in this study in presence of curcumin ( ).

Curcumin inhibited the assembly of FtsZ protofilaments, which plays critical role in bacterial cytokinesis, and also increased the GTPase activity of FtsZ. GTPase activity of FtsZ is lethal to bacteria and suggests that curcumin inhibits bacterial cell proliferation by inhibiting the assembly dynamics of FtsZ in the Z-ring ( ). The mechanism of antibacterial action of curcumin nanoparticles seems to be related with the fact that nanoparticles enter inside the bacterial cell, break the cell wall, and finally lead to cell death ( ).
Hypothetical mechanism of antimicrobial activity of AgNp-CUR SD Has been provided in Fig. 1 .
Although addition of curcumin, compared to the formulations, did not show significant activity in the formulation P407 + CURSD+ AgNps_PVP for both Gram-negative bacteria, the MIC values for curcumin presented better results when compared to the literature. Gunes et al. ( ) reported curcumin MIC values of 175 ug/mL for P. aeruginosa and 163 ug/mL for E. coli . Our results for formulation P407 + CURSD+ AgNps_PVP showed MIC values for curcumin in 50 ug/mL for P. aeruginosa and 25 ug/mL for E. coli . These findings provide evidence that when curcumin is combined with AgNps, better inhibition was noted than without AgNps. We suggest that AgNps are able to improve antimicrobial efficacy of curcumin. The addition of curcumin associated with other antibiotics has been described by Kali et al. ( ), who reported the synergistic effect of curcumin with antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin, amikacin, gentamicin, and cefepime. The maximum synergy was observed with ciprofloxacin among Gram-positive and amikacin, gentamicin, and cefepime among Gram-negative bacteria. They also reported that curcumin has a beneficial role in supplementing antibiotics therapy.
Negi et al . ( ) studied the effect of curcumin as efflux pump inhibitor compared with another standard compound in isolates of P. aeruginosa . Authors claimed that curcumin strengthens the effect of antimicrobial compounds (Figs. 2 and 3 ). Fig. 2 Results of the antioxidant activity of the formulations evaluated over a 60-min period. The data show that antioxidant activity of thermoresponsive hydrogel (P407) was superior to the samples containing only AgNp (PVP, Cit, or PVA) Fig. 3 Curcumin chemical structure
However, the profile of the curves is ascending which suggests activity, although slower, it can be more prolonged. The profile curves of curcumin-AgNp containing samples (P407 + CUR + AgNps_PVA, P407 + CUR + AgNps_PVP, and P407 + CUR + AgNps_Cit) show an initial burst of antioxidant activity, which can be attributed to the release of the molecularly dispersed curcumin in P407. However, the support of the antioxidant activity presented from the time 15 min can be attributed to the release of Ag from the NPs and diffusion by the thermoresponsive gel. The data obtained were statistically evaluated for comparison of the results. The P407 + CUR + AgNps_PVA formulation (1:4) showed significantly higher antioxidant activity at zero times ( p = 0.002), 15 ( p = 0.001), and 30 min.( p = 0.008). At 45 and 60 min, the antioxidant activity of the formulation P407 + CUR + AgNps_PVA (1:4) was similar ( p = 0.09 and p = 0.44, respectively) to the control (GSH). The formulation P407 + CUR + AgNps_ diluted 1:8 showed the same antioxidant capacity of the control for all time ( p > 0.05). The formulation P407 + CUR + AgNps_Cit demonstrated antioxidant activity similar to the control at zero times and 15 min ( p > 0.6). However, at time 30 ( p = 0.03), 45 ( p = 0.002), and 60 min ( p = 0.001), the activity was significantly lower than the control. In these cases, it is important to consider that the curcumin and citrate formulations were also diluted (1:8). The results suggest that the combination of curcumin with stabilized PVP, citrate, or PVA stabilized silver nanoparticles results in better antioxidant activity than the control (GSH) (Tables III and IV ).

CONCLUSION
The CUR in solid dispersion with P407 showed an improved solubility of about ×1000 (data not shown). The hydrogel of P407, AgNps and CUR demonstrated transition temperature (Tsol-gel) (30 ± 2°C), which makes this hydrogel ideal for application in body cavities. A remarkable antioxidant activity was shown by AgNp-CUR SD. The initial burst of antioxidant activity can be attributed to the release of the molecularly dispersed CUR in SD with P407. The antimicrobial activity of curcumin in the presence of AgNps was improved and hence can be recommended for the use as antimicrobial hydrogel after extensive experimental trials in animals.
