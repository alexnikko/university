Introduction
Over the past decades, academia, industry, and regulatory authorities have made significant efforts to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of toxicity in order to reduce drug-related cardiac safety risks, and to improve the success rate of novel biopharmaceutical therapies [ ]. One example of how mechanistic insights have reduced cardiotoxicity is the use of drug-induced hERG channel inhibition or QT/QTc prolongation as a surrogate biomarker of torsades de pointes (TdP) [ , ], which were subsequently incorporated into regulatory guidance documents, such as ICH E14 and S7B [ , , ]. Tachycardia, or abnormally increased heart rates, can reduce cardiac output as a result of reduced ventricular filling time, and in severe scenarios can lead to myocardial ischemia [ , ]. Drug-induced tachycardia and QT prolongation are therefore a major cardiac safety concern that must be identified and addressed in the early stages of drug development. The implementation of the aforementioned regulatory guidance in industrial practice has greatly reduced post-market withdrawals due to drug-induced QT/QTc prolongations [ , ]. In comparison, the mechanisms of drug-induced tachycardia remain incompletely understood and the related risk assessment usually relies on preclinical safety experiments with the aid of modeling. Therefore, it is necessary to develop computational models to account for complex nonlinear TK–TD relationships along with considerable inter-subject variabilities often observed from preclinical safety studies, which are further applied to better guide preclinical or clinical studies.
Although a significant body of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic or toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic (PK–PD or TK–TD) modeling has been reported on cardiovascular variables (such as QT, QTc, etc.) [ , , , ], the modeling efforts on drug-induced tachycardia (or abnormal heart rate increase) are reported but relatively limited [ , , , ]. More importantly, in order to reveal direct drug effects on QT interval, it is necessary to dissociate QT changes from heart rate or RR changes with appropriate correction [ , ]. Although a number of QT correction methods have been reported in the field, it remains challenging to characterize the nonlinear rate-dependency over a wide range of RR intervals [ , ].
In this study, an integrated TK–TD modeling approach is presented to characterize concurrent drug effects on heart rate and QT interval, which was applied to a recently conducted preclinical safety study on a Novartis internal compound (NVS001) in beagle dogs. For drugs (such as NVS001) that cause concurrent QT and heart rate changes, complexity may arise in separating direct drug-induced QT changes (e.g. via hERG inhibition) from indirect drug-induced QT changes (e.g., those physiologically associated with drug-induced heart rate or RR changes). This integrated TK–TD model allows for quantifying the drug effects on QT from the different mechanisms with the model parameters estimated from the experimental TK and TD (heart rate and QT interval) profiles. Further analyses were conducted using the developed model to reveal dose-exposure–response relationships and drug effects on the heart rate and QT changes. For brevity, TK and TD are used interchangeably for PK and PD in the remaining text.

Animals
Male beagle dogs (9–24 months, 7–12 kg, n = 3) were obtained from Marshall BioResources (North Rose, New York). The dogs were kept in animal rooms maintained at a temperature of 20–24 °C, with a relative humidity of 30–70%. Fluorescent light was used to approximate 12-h light/12-h dark cycle. Certified Canine Diet 5007 (PMI Feeds, Richmond, Indiana) and water from the animal drinking supply were provided ad libitum for at least 2 h each day (but no more than 4 h). Treats (i.e., Bioserve ® certified Beefy Bites) may also have been given after handling/manipulations. Animals were single-housed during the feed presentation period. During the dosing period, animals were fed immediately following the conclusion of the day’s dosing session on a routine basis, and food was removed following post-dose clinical signs. The same amount of food was provided to all animals in both water- and drug-treated groups within similar feeding time. Food effects on the cardiovascular variables were expected to be minimized in this controlled manner.
Experimental design
Toxicokinetics
Three male beagle dogs received a single dose of NVS001 at 15, 50, 150 and 450 mg/kg via oral gavage on Days 1, 5, 8 and 12, respectively, and 450 mg/kg twice a day (6 h apart) on Day 15. The QD dose (or first dose for BID) was given around 8 AM. During the pretest period the dogs were dosed with 20 mL of drinking water from the animal drinking water supply. Blood samples were collected from dogs at 0.5, 1, 3, 7 and 24 h after each dose (or post first dose for the BID dosing). Additional blood samples were collected at 1 h post second dose for the BID dosing. Blood samples were collected into tubes containing EDTA and processed to plasma.
Toxicodynamics
Electrocardiography (non-invasive jacket telemetry) was obtained from the dogs during the pretest and dosing periods. Animals were shaved to enhance skin contact of the ECG electrodes. On the dosing days, the animals wore the telemetry jackets for up to 26 h (2 h baseline and 24 h post-dose). Telemetry ECG recordings were made with the animal in its home cage in the animal room. Each jacket was equipped with a digital ECG transmitter box (TLE-E04). The ECG signals were recorded using the emka ECG system (Study Designer, IOX, and ECG-Auto). Lead II and V1 (rv2) ECG was recorded. ECG intervals were measured from lead II ECG. For ECG intervals, the last (fourth) 15-min period of every hour was reported for each dose (to minimize the influence of TK blood sampling procedures on animals) and for pretest. The heart rate and ECG intervals (RR, PR, QRS and QT intervals) were analyzed by the emka ECG system according to standard operating procedure (SOP). Fifteen-minute averages were reported for telemetry data.
Bioanalytical methods
Samples were completely thawed under ambient conditions and briefly vortex-mixed. A 50 µL volume of blank plasma (for control samples and zero samples), calibration standards, quality controls (QCs) and unknown samples was added to the appropriate well of a 96 well assay plate. A 25 µL volume of internal standard solution (500 ng/mL of tolbutamide in acetonitrile) was added to each well, with the exception of wells that contained blanks, to which a 25 µL aliquot of acetonitrile was added. Samples were briefly vortex-mixed. Protein precipitation was performed using 400 µL of acetonitrile. The plate was sealed, vortex mixed for approximately 3 min, and centrifuged for approximately 10 min at 3500 RPM. A 150 µL aliquot of the supernatant was transferred into a second 96-well plate that contained 150 µL of water in each well. The samples were vortex-mixed for 1 min. A 10 µL aliquot of solution was injected onto the LC MS/MS system, which consists of a Shimadzu (Columbia, MD) LC-20AD pump, a Shimadzu SIL-20AC auto sampler, and a Sciex API4000 mass spectrometer (Concord, ON, Canada).
Regulatory compliance
This nonclinical laboratory study was conducted in accordance with the Novartis Animal Care and Use Committee-approved generic protocol no. TX 4039, with this protocol and with facility standard operating procedures (SOPs). Since this study was not intended to support a research or marketing permit, compliance with all provisions of GLPs was not required.
Model development
The experimentally observed TK (i.e., plasma concentration of NVS001) and TD (i.e., heart rate and QT interval) data were captured by an integrated population TK-TD model, which accounted for both structural effects, inter-individual, and intra-individual variability. The model parameters were estimated using the first-order conditional estimation methods with extended least squares (FOCE ELS) or Lindstrom-Bates algorithm (FOCE L-B) provided in Phoenix NLME (Version 1.3, Certara, Princeton, NJ). For visual inspection, the simulated percentiles were generated using the simulation/check function provided in Phoenix NLME.
The final TK–TD model is shown in Fig. 1 . The structural models and inclusion of random effect parameters were selected based on the Akaike Information Criterion [ ]. The selection of random-effect model and error model was based on goodness of fitting determined from both visual inspection and likelihood [ ]. The corresponding hierarchical NLME model was described in Supplemental Information S1. Fig. 1 A diagram illustrating the integrated TK–TD model for NVS001-induced concurrent changes in heart rate and QT interval in the beagle dogs
Toxicokinetic model
The structural model of the TK component was determined to be the one-compartment TK model as described by the following mathematical equations: $$\frac{dAa}{dt} = - ka \cdot Aa$$ (1) $$\frac{dA1}{dt} = ka \cdot Aa_{eff} - CL \cdot C\begin{array}{*{20}c} {} & {} & {C = \frac{A1}{V}} \\ \end{array}$$ (2) with $$Aa_{eff} = \frac{Aa}{{1 + \left( {\frac{Aa}{Aa50}} \right)^{nAa} }}$$ (3) where A1 denotes the amount of NVS001 in the central compartment; Aa and Aa eff denote the total drug amount in the absorption compartment and that available for absorption, respectively; ka denotes the first order absorption rate constant; Aa50 denotes absorption amount at which Aa eff is reduced to 50% of the baseline value; nAa is an exponent coefficient; C denotes NVS001 concentrations in plasma compartment, respectively; CL denotes the systemic clearance of NVS001; V denotes the volume of distribution of NVS001 in the central peripheral compartment.
Circadian model
The circadian variable, circ, is time-dependent and consists of two cosine functions: $$circ = Ra \cdot \cos \left( {\frac{t - ta}{24} \cdot 2\pi } \right) + Rb \cdot \cos \left( {\frac{t - tb}{12} \cdot 2\pi } \right)$$ (4) where t denotes the time; Ra and Rb denote the amplitudes; ta and tb denote acrophase parameters. The acrophase parameters, ta and tb can be obtained from the experimental ECG data of the control group using the equations shown below: $$\frac{dE}{dt} = kincon \cdot \left( {1 + circ} \right) - koutcon \cdot E$$ (5) with $$\left. E \right|_{t = 0} = \frac{kincon}{koutcon} \cdot \left( {1 + \left. {circ} \right|_{t = 0} } \right)$$ (6) where E refers to heart rate or QT interval, kincon denotes the zero order rate constant for production of the response in the control group; koutcon denotes the first order rate constant for loss of the response in the control group.
Toxicodynamic model
For the TD component of heart rate, the structural model was characterized using an indirect response (IDR) model with the NVS001 concentration-dependent stimulation effect on the input parameter (kin) along with a modulator compartment account for potential feedback tolerance, as described below: $$\frac{{dHR}}{{dt}} = ki{n_{HR}} \cdot \left( {1 + cir{c_{HR}} + {s_{HR}} \cdot C} \right) - kou{t_{HR}} \cdot HR \cdot {M_{HR}}^{{\gamma _{HR}}}$$ (7) $$\frac{{dM_{HR} }}{dt} = ktol_{HR} \cdot \left( {\frac{HR}{{HR_{baseline} }} - M_{HR} } \right)$$ (8) with $$\left. {HR} \right|_{t = 0} = HR0 = \frac{{kin_{HR} }}{{kout_{HR} }} \cdot \left( {1 + \left. {circ_{HR} } \right|_{t = 0} } \right)$$ (9) $$\left. {M_{HR} } \right|_{t = 0} = 1$$ (10) where variable or subscript HR denotes the heart rate; kin denotes the zero order rate constant for production of the response (heart rate); kout denotes the first order rate constant for loss of the response (heart rate); s denotes the slope or the linear stimulation effect of NVS001 plasma concentration; M denotes the modulator variable; ktol denotes the rate constant of tolerance development; and circ denotes the circadian rhythm effect.
For the TD component of QT interval, the structural model was characterized using an indirect response (IDR) model with the concentration-dependent stimulation effects on the input parameter (kin) along with a modulator variable accounting for rate-dependency, as described below: $$\frac{dQT}{dt} = kin_{QT} \cdot H_{RR} \cdot \left( {1 + \frac{{E\max_{QT} \cdot C}}{{EC50_{QT} + C}}} \right) - kout_{QT} \cdot QT$$ (11) with $$H_{RR} = \frac{{RR^{{\gamma_{RR} }} }}{{RR50^{{\gamma_{RR} }} + RR^{{\gamma_{RR} }} }}$$ (12) $$RR = 60/HR$$ (13) $$RR0 = 60/HR0 ,$$ (14) $$\left. {QT} \right|_{t = 0} = QT0 = \frac{{kin_{QT} }}{{kout_{QT} }} \cdot \frac{{RR0_{{}}^{{\gamma_{RR} }} }}{{RR50_{{}}^{{\gamma_{RR} }} + RR0_{{}}^{{\gamma_{RR} }} }} ,$$ (15) where variable or subscript QT denotes the QT interval; kin denotes the zero order rate constant for production of the response (QT); kout denotes the first-order rate constant for loss of the response (QT); Emax and EC50 denote the maximal stimulation effect of NVS001 plasma concentration and the half maximal effect concentration, respectively; RR is defined as 60/HR, γ RR denotes the Hill coefficient, RR50 denotes the RR value achieving the half maximal effect on the production rate, and H RR denotes the modulation of RR on the kin rate of QT. The circadian rhythm effects and tolerance modulation were not included in the QT component as a model selection result (see Results and discussion ).
Model identification and parameterization
To account for potential TK accumulation and PD carryover effects resulting from the sequential ascending dose design, TK and TD data from all dosing groups were integrated into a continuous time scale for each animal according to the actual experimental protocol. A step-wise strategy was applied to parameterize the integrated TK–TD model. First, the population TK model was constructed and parameterized using the TK data. Second, the circadian variations of heart rate and QT in beagle dogs were characterized based on the ECG measurement from the control group. Then the TD heart rate component model was integrated with the TK model and parameterized while freezing TK fixed-effect and random-effect parameters. Finally, the TD QT component model was integrated with all the other components and parameterized while freezing fixed-effect and random-effect parameters previously determined of the TK and heart rate model components.
The detailed model selection procedure is described in Supplemental Information S1 with objective function value (−2LL) and AIC values listed for key candidate models. During initial parameter estimation, random-effect parameters were included for all model parameters then the poorly estimated random effects were removed in a serial manner [ ]. In the final model, the random-effect parameters are included for ka, V, CL, kincon HR , ta HR , kincon QT , ta QT , kin HR , s HR , kin QT , and Emax QT , which are reported as between-subject variability (BSV) in Table 2 . The inter-occasional variability was not considered in the current model.

TK–TD-model-derived QT correction (QTc) method
Following model parameterization, a new correction formulation is suggested to be: $$QTcS = \frac{{{{QT} \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{QT} {\left( {RR50^{{\gamma_{RR} }} + 1} \right)}}} \right. \kern-0pt} {\left( {RR50^{{\gamma_{RR} }} + 1} \right)}}}}{{{{RR^{{\gamma_{RR} }} } \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{RR^{{\gamma_{RR} }} } {\left( {RR50^{{\gamma_{RR} }} + RR^{{\gamma_{RR} }} } \right)}}} \right. \kern-0pt} {\left( {RR50^{{\gamma_{RR} }} + RR^{{\gamma_{RR} }} } \right)}}}}$$ (16) which ensures QTcS = QT given RR = 1 s or HR = 60 beat/min in alignment with other conventional correction equations. For the purpose of comparison, the QTc intervals were also calculated using the Van de Water’s formula, $$QTcVW = QT - 0.087 \cdot \left( {RR - 1} \right)$$ (17) which has been suggested as one of the best QT correction methods for dogs [ ].
Modeling tools
The population TK–TD model was implemented in Phoenix NLME (Version 1.3, Certara, Princeton). Scripts for data processing, post-analysis, and graphic illustrations were implemented in MATLAB (Version 2015a, MathWorks, Natick). The model component diagram was created in PowerPoint (Version 2010, Microsoft, Seattle). Modeling was conducted on a personal computer (Intel ® Core i7-4600 M, 2.9 GHz) equipped with Windows 7 64-bit operating system. The corresponding Phoenix NLME codes are provided in Supplemental Information S2.
Results
The integrated TK–TD model successfully captured the experimentally observed TK–TD profiles of NVS001 and consequent heart rate changes. The final model parameters are summarized in Table 2 . The population and individual model fits, along with goodness-of-fit plots are available in Supplemental Information S3 and S4, respectively.
Toxicokinetic model
The population toxicokinetics (or pharmacokinetic) model was constructed as described in the Methods Section. As shown in Fig. 2 , a satisfactory agreement was achieved between model simulations and experimental TK data. Although the study was designed as single ascending dosing with 3- or 4-day washout periods between adjacent doses, residual concentrations were present in the high-dosing group, as suggested by high initial concentrations at the first TK sampling time points (i.e., 0.5 h postdose). To account for the associated TK accumulation, the TK data were modeled with all sampling time points starting from the 1st dose for each animal. For example, time post 1st dose = 0 h denotes t = 0 h in Day 1, and time post 1st dose = 264 h denotes t = 0 h in Day 12. Visual inspection plot of the TK model fitting is included in Fig. 2 , showing comparison between experimental TK data and model-simulated quantiles, with 5, 50, and 95% percentiles represented by dotted, solid, and dashed lines, respectively. Dosing information is also indicated in Fig. 2 accordingly. Fig. 2 Comparison between experimental TK data and model-simulated quantiles versus time post the first dose. Experimental observations are represented by solid dots , while 5, 50, and 95% percentiles represented by dotted , solid , and dashed lines , respectively
Modeling circadian variations
The circadian variation models for heart rate and QT interval were parameterized using the ECG data obtained from the control group during the pretest period. As shown in Fig. 3 , model fittings agree well with experimental observations on heart rate and QT interval from the control group, indicating the proposed circadian model (Eqs. 4 – 6 ) is sufficient to capture the experimentally daily changes in heart rate due to physiological circadian rhythms. Fig. 3 Comparison between experimentally observed and model-simulated heart rate (subplot a ) and QT interval (subplot b ) with circadian variations. Experimental observations are represented by solid dots , while 5, 50, and 95% percentiles represented by dotted , solid , and dashed lines , respectively
Across all three dogs, the circadian variation demonstrated similar patterns, with heart rate reaching the maximal value during the morning (i.e., t = ~0 to 4 h or 6 AM to 10 AM) and decreasing to the minimum values during the night (i.e., t = ~16 to 24 h or 10 PM to 6 AM). The observed circadian variations in beagle dogs from this study were consistent with other literature-reported observations [ ]. Compared with heart rate, circadian variations of QT are relatively small (see Table 2 ) and the direct circadian component on QT was not included into the final model to reduce parameter uncertainty and increase model robustness. Instead the indirect circadian effect on QT was incorporated through the RR term (see Eq. 11 and 12 ).
Toxicodynamic model
As shown in Figs. 4 and 5 , reasonable agreement was achieved between the experimental observations and model simulations for both heart rate and QT interval, respectively, with the majority of the observations falling between the simulated 5 and 95% percentiles. Following the simulation strategy used for modeling the TK data, all TD data (including those of the control group) were simultaneously modeled with all sampling time points starting from pretest period for each animal. Overall, observations and simulations indicate heart rate increases as oral doses increase, while QT gradually increases as oral doses increase from 0 to 150 mg/kg and then decreases as oral doses further increase.

Discussion
The integrated TK–TD modeling results and further analyses are discussed below.
Toxicokinetics of NVS001 in dogs
As revealed from Fig. 2 and Supplemental Information (S3, TK model), the model-simulated TK profiles largely agree with the experimental observations. It is also noticed that some deviations between the observations and simulations are observed at certain time points, including data at 24 h from all three animals, at 168.5 h from #1002, and at 96.5 and168.5 h from #1003, respectively. Among these data points, the deviation in model prediction at 24 h may be associated with under-predicted systemic clearance at the low oral dose (i.e., 10 mg/kg), while the deviation in model predictions at 96.5 and 168.5 h are possibly due to rapid increase in plasma concentrations (C plasma ) immediately following dosing when the measured C plasma values are sensitive to the actual blood sampling time.
Since NVS001 was identified as a BCS-2 compound with solubility <0.1 mg/mL at pH 6.8 (internal data), it was expected that saturated absorption may occur at high doses [ ], thus limiting bioavailability at high doses in beagle dogs. To account for the saturated absorption effect, an empirical nonlinear term was introduced as described in the Methods Section. Following the model selection process, the one-compartment oral absorption model with the dose-limited absorption term was selected as the final model based on the objective functional value (OFV or −2LL) and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) (see Supplemental Information S1).Overall, a satisfactory agreement between the model-simulated and experimentally-observed TK profiles indicates that the current TK model is able to capture the potential saturated absorption effects in beagle dogs with high-dose administration of NVS001.
Circadian variations of heart rate and QT intervals
Circadian variations of physiological variables are present in most animals. Consistent with the experimental observations on beagle dogs in this study, cardiovascular variables (including RR and QT interval) in dogs reach minimums in the morning and increase to maximums at midnight [ ].
As a widely applied empirical approach, a single or multiple cosine or sine functions can be used to quantitatively capture the circadian variations of physiological variables [ , ]. One of the common formats is: $$circ = Ra \cdot \cos \left( {\frac{t - ta}{24} \cdot 2\pi } \right) + Rb \cdot \cos \left( {\frac{t - tb}{12} \cdot 2\pi } \right) + Rc \cdot \cos \left( {\frac{t - tc}{6} \cdot 2\pi } \right)$$ (18,) where Ra, Rb, and Rc denote amplitude parameters and ta, tb, and tc denote acrophase parameters. The general circadian descriptor shown above was reduced to two cosine components for heart rate and one cosine component for QT interval, respectively, by following the model selection procedure based on likelihood and AIC using the control group data (see Methods and Supplemental Information S1).
Mammalian heart rates are generally regulated by sympathetic and parasympathetic pathways, with the former accelerating heartbeat via the chain of sympathetic ganglia, and the latter slowing heartbeats via the vagus nerve [ , ]. Therefore, an indirect response (IDR) model becomes a natural candidate to model autonomic regulation of heartbeat, with kin (inflow rate) representing sympathetic actions and kout (outflow rate) representing parasympathetic actions [ ]. The IDR model of physiological heart rate regulation serves as a basis for the related drug effect model as discussed in the Methods Section.
The agreement between observations and simulations on QT interval in the control group also suggests that the IDR model can be a good candidate model for characterizing drug effects. Although the QT circadian variation is not included into the final model for this dog study due to the relatively minor variation amplitude (Table 2 ) the same structural model is adopted to characterize drug effects on QT interval with addition of rate-dependency components.
Drug-induced tachycardia
Heart rate can be elevated via either a hormonal mechanism or nervous mechanism [ ]. Under a hormonal mechanism, heart rate is increased by local concentrations of epinephrine, norepinephrine, or other similar chemicals [ ]. For example, nicotine increases flow of adrenaline by binding to nicotine receptors in the adrenal medulla [ ]. In comparison, under a nervous mechanism, blood signals (CO 2 , plasma pH, blood pressure, etc.) detected by chemoreceptors in the carotid arteries, aorta and the brain are translated into nervous signals that trigger an increase in heart rate [ ]. For example, cocaine is a nonspecific voltage gated sodium channel blocker, which inhibits serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake and thus causes heart rate elevation by stimulating the nervous system [ ]. Another example is nifedipine, which is an L-Type calcium channel blocker, triggering vasodilation and lowering blood pressure, and consequently leading to an increase in heart rate as a homeostatic response [ , ].
The toxicological mechanisms underlying NVS001-induced tachycardia (or an abnormal heart rate increase) are unclear. The drug-induced tachycardia potential was not detected from internal in vitro screen studies. Thus, the observed drug effects were incorporated into the baseline IDR model of heart rate using a semi-empirical approach. Following the model development procedure described in the Methods Section, a linear model was selected to capture the drug effect (see Eq. 7 ). Besides, a modulator compartment was included to account for potential resistance of heart rate increase to NVS001 [ ]. For a further demonstration, simulations were also conducted with the modulator variable clamped at 1, i.e., ignoring any resistance to drug effects. By comparing the simulation results with the experimental data (see Fig. 6 a), it was suggested that drug-related tolerance or resistance was required to capture the observed NVS001-induced tachycardia profiles, especially given high oral doses of NVS001. The observed acute drug tolerance phenomena were also reported with other compounds including nitroglycerin [ ], nicotine [ ], remifentanil [ ], caffeine [ ], and cocaine [ ], etc. Fig. 6 Model-simulated temporal profiles of heart rate (subplot a ) and QT interval (subplot b ) in comparison with experimental observations.

The model simulation ignoring rate-dependency of QT interval is plotted as a dashed curve in Subplot b . Mean experimental observations are plotted as solid symbols with standard deviation (SD) represented by error bars
NVS001-induced tachycardia was further investigated by simulating TK and heart rate profiles given single oral doses at 50 and 450 mg/kg. Since heart rates are subject to impacts of circadian rhythms, the heart rate change from baseline (∆HR) was computed by using the following formula to reveal the actual drug effects: $$\Delta HR(t) = HR(t) - HR_{control} (t)$$ (19)
The temporal profiles of heart rate change (∆HR) and plasma concentration (Cp) of NVS001 are as shown in Fig. 7 a and b. The relationship between ∆HR and Cp of NVS001 was derived from the model-simulated TK and HR profiles at paired sampling time points as plotted in Fig. 8 a. As revealed from the Cp-∆HR relationship, mixed clockwise and counterclockwise hysteresis is observed in dogs given oral doses of NVS001. As dose increases to a high level (e.g., 450 mg/kg), such mixed-type hysteresis becomes especially obvious, implying that a resistance or tolerance factor significantly modulates the drug effects as the heart rate reaches or passes a certain level and then tolerance gradually diminishes as Cp decreases to relative low levels [ , ]. A further illustration and discussion of tolerance development was provided in Supplemental Information (S7). Overall, the maximal HR change (∆HR, max) increases approximately linearly with the maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) over the tested dosing range, i.e., ~10 μg/mL increase of Cmax results in ~10 beat/min of heart rate elevation in beagle dogs given single oral doses.

It is well known that QT/QTc change can be induced by compounds inhibiting single or multiple cardiac ion channels, including the hERG channel that is often used as surrogate biomarker indicating QT/QTc prolongation or TdP potentials [ , ]. Since in-house in vitro screening studies indicate that 50% inhibition of hERG channel can be achieved at ~20 μM incubation concentration of NVS001, drug-induced QT/QTc prolongation is expected as NVS001 plasma concentration increases to sufficiently high levels. Meanwhile, the drug-induced tachycardia may lead to shortening of QT interval due to the inherent rate-dependency of QT interval [ , ].
In order to reveal direct drug effects on QT interval, it is necessary to dissociate QT changes from heart rate or RR changes with appropriate correction [ , ], which remains challenging despite of a number of existing correction methods. Malfatto et al. [ , ] proposed a sigmoid function to characterize the nonlinear rate-dependency of QT interval as follows: $$QT = \frac{{QT\hbox{max} \cdot RR^{{\gamma_{RR} }} }}{{RR50^{{\gamma_{RR} }} + RR^{{\gamma_{RR} }} }}$$ (20) where QTmax denotes the maximal QT value independent of rate, and RR50 and γ RR are two parameters characterizing rate-dependency of QT interval. The QT–RR relationship proposed by Malfatto et al. was derived from observations on cell-level rate-dependency of action potential duration, and associated with a clear physiological basis [ , ]. Therefore, it was incorporated into the TK–TD model to account for the nonlinear rate-dependency of QT interval with the QTmax parameter replaced with IDR parameters of kin and kout.
Complex interplay between drug-induced tachycardia and rate-dependency of QT interval may lead to interesting dose–response profiles as observed in beagle dogs orally dosed with NVS001. As shown in Figs. 5 and 6 b, the observed QT levels increase as dosing strengh increases until it reaches 150 mg/kg and QT levels start to decrease despite further dose elevation. When rate-dependency of QT interval is excluded from the model simulations by fixing the RR interval to 1 s, a monotonic increase in QT is predicted instead. As a further investigation, dynamic profiles of QT were simulated for dogs given single oral doses of 50 and 450 mg/kg, respectively. As shown in Fig. 7 c, the drug-induced QT prolongation initially appears as plasma concentration begins to increase, and then becomes flat or reversed as a result of significant RR shortening around Tmax, when both maximal NVS001 plasma concentration (Cp) and heart rate are achieved. As Cp and heart rate start to decrease at later time points, the rate-dependency becomes less significant and drug-induced QT prolongation becomes evident again. In comparison, when the RR interval is clamped at 1 s during the single-dose simulations, the temporal profile of QT approximately follows dynamic changes of Cp (see Fig. 7 d). In these simulations, the QT change from baseline (QT) was computed as follows: $$\Delta QT\left( t \right) = QT\left( t \right) - QT_{control} \left( t \right).$$ (21)
For NVS001, the delayed drug effects on QT are masked by rate-dependency, circadian effects, and carry-over drug effects, and thus not obvious from the direct experimental observation. When model simulations are plotted on a Cp-QT plane with RR clamped at 1 s (see Fig. 8 b), a delayed drug effect on QT is demonstrated by the counterclockwise hysteresis at different oral doses. Overall, the maximal QT change (∆QT,max) increases approximately linearly with the maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) over the low concentration range, e.g., <10 μg/mL, with a saturated drug effect on ∆QT predicted at higher concentrations, which is consistent with the in vitro observation (hERG IC50 = ~20 μM free buffer concentration or ~15 μg/mL equivalent total plasma concentration, see Table 1 ).
As revealed by the simulations discussed above, the integrated TK-TD model within a NLME modeling framework can be used to identify direct drug effects on QT interval from complex QT profiles as a result of collective contributions from rate-dependency, circadian variations, and intersubject variability, which are challenging to be captured using conventional two-step QTc analysis methods [ , , ].
Steady-state analysis of drug effects on heart rate and QT intervals
In repeated toxicity studies or potential clinical studies, drugs are usually administered to animals or humans on a regular basis over a long period, during which steady states of exposures and TD/PD responses may be achieved. Thus it is of interest to understand steady-state drug effects or associated toxicity. Following some mathematical derivations (see details in Supplemental Information S5), steady-state heart rate and QT in beagle dogs orally dosed with NVS001 can be described as follows: $$HRss = \frac{{kin_{HR} }}{{kout_{HR} }} \cdot \left( {\left( {1 + circ_{HR} + s_{HR} \cdot C_{ss} } \right) \cdot \left( {1 + \left. {circ_{HR} } \right|_{t = 0} } \right)^{{\gamma_{HR} }} } \right)^{{1/(\gamma_{HR} + 1)}}$$ (22) $$QTss = \frac{{kin_{QT} }}{{kout_{QT} }} \cdot \frac{{RR_{ss}^{{\gamma_{RR} }} }}{{RR50^{{\gamma_{RR} }} + RR_{ss}^{{\gamma_{RR} }} }} \cdot \left( {1 + \frac{{Emax_{QT} \cdot C_{ss} }}{{EC50_{QT} + C_{ss} }}} \right) .$$ (23) where ss denotes steady state. Substituting the model parameters (listed in Table 2 ) into Eqs. ( 22 ) and ( 23 ), HRss and QTss are computed with Css varying from 0 to 60 μg/mL and Time varying from 0 to 24 h. Here Time at 0 h corresponds to 6 AM. The results are illustrated as surface and contour plots as shown in Fig. 9 . As revealed from the steady-state profiles, HRss and QTss are functions of both steady-state concentration (Css) and time. The functional dependency on Css results from the drug effects on both cardiovascular variables, and the time dependency arise from circadian rhythms. Overall HRss increases as Css increases but the surface plot of HRss featured by a nadir zone at Time from ~8 to ~20 h, i.e., 2 PM to 2 AM. In comparison, peak values of QTss are predicted at Css = ~15 μg/mL and Time = 14 h or 8 PM. The steady-state analysis implies that caution is needed to interpret experimental toxicity study findings for drugs inducing concurrent changes in heart rate and QT which are impacted by both circadian rhythms and drug exposure.

TK–TD-model-derived QT correction method
As previously discussed, the nonlinear rate-dependence of QT interval can be well captured by the sigmoid function with rate-dependency parameters estimated within the TK–TD modeling framework. The comparative analysis for NVS001 in the beagle dogs was conducted on relationships between plasma concentration (C plasma or Cp) of NVS001 and QTc derived from the new correction formula and the conventional Van de Water formula. As shown in Fig. 10 a, QTcS increases as plasma concentration of NVS001 increases and reaches a plateau at high plasma concentration (>~40 μg/mL). In comparison, the bell-like relationship is found between C plasma and QTcVW (see Fig. 10 b), which decreases as C plasma further increases beyond ~40 μg/mL, implying inadequate dissociation of heart rate effect on the QT interval in the high-dose groups. The new QT correction formula (QTcS) proposed in this work may represent an alternative effective correction method, which will be subject to further examination in independent studies.

Conclusion and future work
In the present study, an integrated TK–TD model for a Novartis compound (NVS001) was developed within a NLME modeling framework to capture the experimentally observed TK (total plasma concentration) and TD (heart rate and QT interval) profiles from a single-ascending jacket telemetry study conducted in beagle dogs. Despite the complex TK and TD profiles, the integrated TK–TD is capable of identifying the drug effects on both heart rate and QT interval by simultaneously accounting for saturated absorption, circadian variations, tolerance to drug effects, and nonlinear rate dependency of QT interval. Reasonable agreement between model-simulations and experimental observations suggest that the TK–TD model proposed in the present study may provide a novel, powerful modeling framework for capturing drug-induced concurrent tachycardia and QT changes and thus facilitating preclinical safety studies. Since the current model was developed for one compound (NVS001) tested in a limited number of beagle dogs, it may be subject to further modifications or improvement based on future extensive investigations on other compounds. In addition, similarities in cardiovascular physiology have been observed between canine models and humans, e.g., in circadian rhythms [ , ] and nonlinear rate-dependency of QT interval [ , ]. Although a possible disconnect may exist between drug effects in canine models and humans, the modeling framework and strategy can be potentially extended to clinical safety applications for compounds affecting both heart rate and QT interval. With the aid of computational modeling, we expect to continuously improve our understanding of drug-induced cardiotoxicity including tachycardia and QT prolongation, move towards refinement, replacement, and reduction (3R) in animal usage, and deliver better medicines to our community.
