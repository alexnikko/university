Introduction
Intense research has been conducted in order to provide clinical guidance for the use of adjuvant analgesics such as gabapentinoids, NSAIDs, acetaminophen and glucorticoids in combinations with opioids for postoperative pain management [ , , ]. Reduction in opioid consumption may be used as a primary endpoint for opioid sparing efficacy in trials of adjuvant analgesics in conjunction with endpoints on pain intensity and side effects [ ]. Despite promising clinical results, the value of adjuvant analgesia remains uncertain due to the heterogeneity in trial design and statistical analysis of opioid consumption [ , , , ].
Designing trials with sufficient statistical power to detect differences in opioid consumption between groups is a challenge since postoperative pain and opioid consumption is highly variable between individuals and ways of optimal statistical analysis remain unresolved [ , , ]. Traditional statistical tests include cross-sectional parametric tests such as the t-test or ANOVA [ , ] and non-parametric tests such as the Mann–Whitney rank sum test [ , ]. Cross-sectional opioid consumption have been reported at various times in trials, including at 2 h [ , , ], 4 h [ , , , ], 24 h [ , , , , ] and 48 h [ , ] after surgery. However, all traditional cross-sectional statistical tests in postoperative pain trials involve violation of statistical assumptions when applied to opioid consumption data [ ]. Alternatively survival and time-to-event (TTE) analysis have been used to study time to first rescue medication [ , ]. A limitation with such analyses is that patients will dropout after first event, resulting in a loss of information. Informative dropout can also be problematic if dropouts are related to pain intensity [ ]. Finally, concerns have been raised that results on opioid consumption may be influenced by multiple factors that can potentially skew the apparent analgesic efficacy [ , ]. These factors include the effects of the opioid rescue medication on subsequent opioid consumption as well as side effects of both opioids and adjuvant analgesic, that may be non-linear in time and not easily handled in traditional tests [ , ].
Recently, a repeated time to event (RTTE) modeling approach has been presented to study opioid consumption which overcome the problems of traditional TTE analysis [ , , ]. With the RTTE methodology, it is possible to study non-linear effects such as the opioid effects on subsequent opioid consumption as has been presented in recent analyses [ , ].
The aim of this study was to compare the power to detect opioid sparing efficacy of a hypothetical adjuvant analgesic using RTTE modeling to a parametric statistical test (t-test), a non-parametric test (Mann–Whitney rank sum) and an analysis of time to first re-medication (using TTE modeling) in clinical trial simulations. Furthermore we sought to investigate the possibility to optimize trials with different trial durations and to evaluate the potential benefit in power and precision of efficacy estimates by accounting for the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK–PD) relationships and time-varying covariates using RTTE modeling.
Methods
Clinical trial simulation strategy
Clinical trials were simulated to investigate the opioid sparing effect of a hypothetical adjuvant analgesic (drug X) administered daily in combination with morphine on request for postoperative pain in a population of patients undergoing hip surgery, as observed by Juul et al. [ , ]. All trials were simulated with two arms, an active arm with drug X plus morphine on request and a control arm with morphine on request but without drug X. Drug X was designed with an assumed efficacy giving approximately 35% reduction in opioid consumption after a dose of 10 mg.
Firstly; the power to detect significant opioid sparing effects of drug X in a dose of 10 mg was compared between RTTE modeling, t-test, Mann–Whitney and TTE modeling. Clinical trials with lengths of 24, 48, 72 and 96 h were simulated to investigate potential optimization of trial duration.
Secondly; the importance of modeling time-varying covariates (including time-varying PK) when estimating opioid sparing effects was addressed. Simulations were repeated in a dose range of 2.5–40 mg in a 24 h trial with 200 subjects using RTTE modeling in order to explore sensitivity of potency estimates to different effect sizes.
Simulation strategy for morphine dosing on request
Morphine on request was defined as 10 mg immediate release tablets. Timing of morphine requests was simulated using NONMEM (version 7.3, ICON Development Solutions) [ ] and PsN (version 4.4.5, Uppsala, Sweden) [ ] with a RTTE model previously published for the probability of morphine dosing events in hip fracture [ ], with parameters in Table 1 . The hazard model for the probability of events in time was a Gompertz function describing a decline in hazard over time. Table 1 Parameters for the RTTE model used for simulation and parameters (median [95% CI]) with 500 simulations and re-estimations for the true model (using Eq. 2 ) in trials with 100 subjects in the control group and 100 subjects receiving 10 mg of drug X Units Simulation Estimates true model λ day −1 2.74 2.71 [1.96:3.70] γ day −1 −0.154 −0.148 [−0.501:0.217] Cov Night % 26.2 26.1 [19.8:34.1] EC 50, mor ng/mL 1.92 1.92 (fixed) E max, mor % 77.6 77.6 (fixed) Hill mor – 5.74 5.74 (fixed) EC 50, drugX mg/L 1.20 1.20 [0.70:2.55] Frailty %CV 176.0 169.3 [125.4:231.5] λ: Baseline hazard of the Gompertz distribution, γ: Shape parameter of the Gompertz distribution, Cov Day : Proportional hazard describing the risk ratio between night (11pm–7am) relative to day (7am–11pm), EC 50, morphine : Effective concentration of morphine giving a 50% reduction in hazard, E max, morphine : Maximum potential reduction in hazard for morphine, Hill morphine : Hill coefficient of the sigmoidal relationship between concentration and hazard, EC 50, drugX : Effective concentration of drug X giving a 50% reduction in hazard, Frailty: Interindividual variability in hazard $$ h_{0} = \lambda \cdot e^{\gamma \cdot t} $$ (1) where h 0 is the base hazard model, λ is the baseline, γ is the shape and t is the time since surgery.
Simulations were performed with a log-normal random effect (frailty) describing the inter-individual variability in morphine consumption, a proportional PK–PD model for the effect of morphine and drug X on the probability of subsequent analgesic events as well as a covariate describing reduction in probability at night (11pm–7 am) described by $$ h = h_{0} \cdot E_{drugX} \cdot E_{morphine} \cdot e^{{\beta \cdot {\text{Night}}}} \cdot e^{\eta } $$ (2) where h is the hazard, h 0 is the base hazard model, E drugX is the PK–PD model for drug X, E morphine is the PK–PD model for morphine, β is a covariate for the hazard at night (11pm–7am, Night = 1) versus day (7am–11pm, Night = 0) and η is the random effect (frailty) describing the inter-individual variability in h . Patients were randomly assigned a surgery time between 7 am and 4pm.
Simulation strategy for morphine and drug X PK and PD
Morphine PK was simulated according to a PK model published for oral immediate release morphine with dosing times simulated according to the RTTE model as described by Juul et al. [ ]. Morphine PD following dosing on request was modeled using the corresponding PK–PD model [ ] $$ E_{{morphine}} = \left( {1 - \frac{{{E_{{\max ,mor}}} {^{{Hill}}} \cdot {C_{{mor}}} {^{{Hill}}} }}{{EC_{{50,mor}} + {C_{{mor}}} {^{{Hill}}} }}} \right) $$ (3) where E max,mor is the maximum reduction in opioid consumption (restrained between 0 and 1) due to morphine pharmacodynamics, C mor is the plasma concentration of morphine, EC 50 , mor is the concentration giving 50% of maximum reduction in morphine consumption and Hill is the shape of the sigmoidal PK–PD relationship between morphine plasma concentrations and morphine consumption.
Drug X PK was assumed to follow a 1 compartment pharmacokinetic profile with first order absorption and elimination with parameters, K a = 1.067 h −1 , CL/F = 320 L/h and V/F = 1600 L. The effect of Drug X on the probability of analgesic events was assumed proportional to the hazard with an Emax PK–PD relationship to the concentration of Drug X with an EC 50 of 1.2 mg/L and an E max fixed to 100% (meaning complete reduction of hazard at infinite concentration) (Eq 4 ). $$ E_{drugX} = \left( {1 - \frac{{C_{drugX} }}{{EC_{50,drugX} + C_{drugX} }}} \right) $$ (4) where C drugX is the plasma concentration of the hypothetical adjuvant analgesic and EC 50,drugX is the concentration giving 50% reduction in morphine consumption (as maximum effect was assumed to be complete reduction). An additive inter-individual variability of 30% coefficient of variation was simulated on the EC 50,drugX .
The PD of morphine and drug X were simultaneously modeled from simulated pharmacokinetics (PK) of each drug. The effect size of drug X in doses of 2.5–40 mg on morphine consumption was calculated as the reduction in total morphine consumption in a dosing interval (24 h) between the active arm and control arm.
Methods for statistical power calculation
The Monte-Carlo Mapped Power (MCMP) method was used to estimate the relationship between sample size in the trial and the power to reject the null hypothesis (H 0 ) that drug X had no opioid sparing effect at a significance level of p = 0.05. For TTE and RTTE modeling, H 0 was defined as no PK–PD relationship between drug X and hazard and the alternative hypothesis H 1 was defined as a PK–PD relationship with a structural E max model according to the simulation model (Eqs. 2 , 3 , 4 ). Two competing models were constructed; a full model, identical in structure to the simulation model, with both morphine and drug X PK–PD relationships and the time-of-night covariate corresponding to H 1 (Eq. 2 ) and a reduced model assuming no effect of drug X corresponding to H 0 (Eq. 5 ): $$ h_{reduced} = h_{0} \cdot E_{morphine} \cdot e^{{\beta \cdot {\text{Night}}}} \cdot e^{\eta } $$ (5)
The two competing models differed by 1 degree of freedom (by the parameter EC 50,drugX ).
A single large dataset was simulated with 4000 patients (2000 in control arm and 2000 in active arm). Both the full (Eq. 2 ) and the reduced model (Eq. 5 ) were fitted to data with the Laplacian estimation method [ ]. For speed and stability the parameters related to morphine PD (E max,mor , EC 50,mor , Hill mor ) were not reestimated, but were fixed to their true values. The power for a range of sample sizes was determined according to the MCMP procedure [ ]. The likelihood ratio between the full and the reduced model is given by difference in sum of individual OFVs in the tested sample [ ]. For each tested sampling size, the number of individuals was sampled 10,000 times from the large dataset. The proportion of 10,000 samples where the ΔOFV was greater than 3.84 (1 degree of freedom) was considered as power for the sample size. The procedure was repeated with all samples necessary to obtain the full power curve. Repeated time to event modeling was performed in NONMEM [ ] and the MCMP procedure was performed in PsN [ ]. Analysis of time to first re-medication (TTE modeling) was performed as described for RTTE modeling, but only using the first simulated event as input for the model and with η fixed to 0 as appropriate [ ].
Additionally, t-tests and Mann–Whitney rank sum tests were performed to compare amount of consumed morphine between the active arm and control arm. Amount of consumed morphine was measured as the sum of simulated morphine doses (10 mg each) at end of trial (24, 48, 72 or 96 h). Both t-test and Mann–Whitney rank sum with continuity correction was performed in R (version 3.1.1, The R Foundation for Statistical Computing) [ ]. The power of t-tests and Mann–Whitney were calculated, with the H 0 of no significant change in morphine consumption between active and control arms. Each sample size was simulated and analyzed using t-test and Mann–Whitney 10,000 times. The power with each sample size was considered equivalent to the proportion of times the test rejected the null hypothesis at a significance level of 0.05. Automated random sampling of data and analysis by t-test and Mann–Whitney was performed in R [ ].
Evaluation of PK–PD relationships and time-varying covariates
A model was used for simulation that took into account the effect of morphine on subsequent opioid consumption (Eq. 2 ). The value of including time-varying covariates in RTTE models was investigated on the power and the estimate of apparent efficacy of drug X. Three alternatives to the full model (Eq. 2 ) were used to evaluate this; model A (Eq. 6 ), without morphine effect; model B (Eq. 7 ) also without covariate day/night; and model C (Eq. 8 ), where drug effect was modeled as a proportional hazard instead of a PK–PD relationship, i.e. as would be appropriate if no PK was available for drug X. $$ h_{A} = h_{0} \cdot E_{drugX} \cdot e^{{\beta \cdot {\text{Night}}}} \cdot e^{\eta } $$ (6) $$ h_{B} = h_{0} \cdot E_{drugX} \cdot e^{\eta } $$ (7) $$ h_{C} = h_{0} \cdot e^{{\beta \cdot {\text{drugX}}}} \cdot e^{\eta } $$ (8)
Power estimates for the full model, model A, model B and model C was performed as described above. Drug X efficacy (EC 50,drugX ) median and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were obtained for the full model, model A and model B by estimating parameters in 500 simulated trials with 200 subjects (100 in each arm) with parametric Monte Carlo simulations and re-estimations [ ]. Model C did not include the efficacy estimate (EC 50,drugX ). Trials with doses of 2.5–40 mg of the hypothetical drug X were simulated in order to evaluate scenarios with different opioid sparing effect sizes of the adjuvant analgesic.
Results
Simulations of morphine consumption in control arm and active arm with the hypothetical drug X was successfully performed using parameters seen in Table 1 . The effect sizes for doses of drug X used for simulation were 16% (dose of 2.5 mg), 24% (dose of 5 mg), 35% (dose of 10 mg), 47% (dose of 20 mg) and 60% (dose of 40 mg) reduction in morphine consumption, given as the percentage reduction between total consumption in active and control arm. The dose–response relationship of the drug X on morphine consumption is shown in Fig. 1 . Fig. 1 Dose-response relationship for the hypothetical drug on 24 h morphine consumption. Morphine consumption is calculated as the proportional difference in total morphine consumption between active and control arm in simulations with 2000 subjects in each arm
Simulated morphine consumption in the control arm was in median (25th–75th percentile): 20 mg (10–30) over 24 h, 30 mg (10–60) over 48 h, 40 mg (20–80) over 72 h and 50 mg (20–110) over 96 h. The distribution of 24–96 h morphine consumption for each simulated individual in the control arm and the active arm receiving daily doses of 10 mg of drug X in clinical trial simulations is shown in Fig. 2 . The relationship between sample size and the power to detect significant opioid sparing effects of the hypothetical drug in a dose of 10 mg using RTTE modeling, TTE modeling, t-test and Mann–Whitney is shown in Fig. 3 . A total sample size of 50 subjects (25 in active arm + 25 in control arm) were needed to demonstrate opioid sparing efficacy with a power of at least 80% in 24 h trials using RTTE modeling, whereas 76 subjects were needed using TTE modeling, 200 were needed using the Mann–Whitney and 180 were needed using the t-test. Fig. 2 Distribution of subject-level total morphine consumption in simulated trials with 2000 subjects in the active arm ( black ) and 2000 subjects in the control arm ( white ) with trial duration of 24, 48, 72 and 96 h. Plot is truncated at 150 mg for visual purposes Fig. 3 Power plots for the relationship between the number of trial subjects (N) and power to detect a significant difference (p < 0.05) in opioid consumption using RTTE modeling, t-test, TTE modeling and Mann–Whitney rank sum test in trials of duration 24–96 h. The total number of subjects was divided equally into the active and the control arm
The impact of increasing trial duration from 24 to 48, 72 and 96 h can also be seen from Fig. 3 . Marked increase in power of RTTE modeling could be obtained by increasing trial duration. Extending a 24 trial to 96 h trial led to a 3.1 fold reduction in required number of trial subjects (16 subjects needed) to detect opioid sparing efficacy of drug X (dose 10 mg) with a power of 80% with RTTE modeling. Only marginal benefits of increasing trial duration from 24 h to 96 h were observed with the traditional tests, resulting in a reduction in sample size needed to demonstrate efficacy at 80% power of 140 subject for t-test (1.3 fold reduction), 150 Mann–Whitney rank sum test (1.3 fold reduction) and 70 subjects for TTE modeling (1.1 fold reduction).
Quantification of drug X effects without accounting for morphine PK–PD (model A) and time-varying covariates including morphine PK–PD (model B) was associated with decreased study power as seen in Fig. 4 . Most significantly, the power was reduced if PK–PD relationship of drug X could not be established (model C), in which case the power was equivalent to a Mann–Whitney rank sum test, and sample size would need increase by 2.6 times to obtain the power of model B and 3.7 fold to obtain power of the full model. Parameter estimates and precision of the full model trial with 200 individuals is seen in Table 1 . The precision of the potency estimate of drug X (EC 50,drugX ) decreased with omission of morphine PK–PD (model A) and time-varying covariates including morphine PK–PD (model B) as seen in Fig. 5 , most notably at high doses, where most precise estimates could be obtained for the full model. Fig. 4 Power plots for the relationship between the number of trial subjects (N) and power to detect a significant difference (p < 0.05) in opioid consumption using a full RTTE model \( (h = h_{0} \cdot E_{drugX} \cdot E_{morphine} \cdot e^{{\beta \cdot {\text{Night}}}} \cdot e^{\eta } ) \) , model A ignoring morphine effects ( purple ) \( (h = h_{0} \cdot E_{drugX} \cdot e^{{\beta \cdot {\text{Night}}}} \cdot e^{\eta } ) \) , model B with no time-varying covariates ( green ) \( (h = h_{0} \cdot E_{drugX} \cdot e^{\eta } ) \) and model C with a proportional hazard effect instead of a PK–PD relationship for drug X ( blue ) \( (h_{C} = h_{0} \cdot e^{{\beta \cdot {\text{drugX}}}} \cdot e^{\eta } ) \) . The power of Mann–Whitney rank sum test is added for comparison (Color figure online) Fig. 5 Precision of potency estimates for drug X in a 24 h trials with 200 subjects (100 in active and 100 in control arm) and doses of drug X between 2.5 and 40 mg. Medians and 95% confidence intervals of the EC 50,drugX parameter are derived from the full model with both morphine and drug X PD ( black ) \( (h = h_{0} \cdot E_{drugX} \cdot E_{morphine} \cdot e^{{\beta \cdot {\text{Night}}}} \cdot e^{\eta } ) \) , model A ignoring morphine effects ( purple ) \( (h = h_{0} \cdot E_{drugX} \cdot e^{{\beta \cdot {\text{Night}}}} \cdot e^{\eta } ) \) and model B with no time-varying covariates ( green ) \( (h = h_{0} \cdot E_{drugX} \cdot e^{\eta } ) \) . In each case median and CI are derived from 500 simulations. The grey vertical line illustrates the true value of EC 50,drugX used for simulations (Color figure online)
Discussion
In this study, we investigated four different ways of analyzing opioid consumption data in a simulated clinical trial with a hypothetical opioid sparing adjuvant analgesic. We found RTTE modeling to be superior to TTE modeling, t-test and Mann–Whitney rank sum test for detecting opioid sparing efficacy. Furthermore the power of RTTE modeling analysis was markedly improved when trial duration was increased, whereas little benefit was obtained when analyzing cross-sectional data (t-test and Mann–Whitney rank sum test) or time to first re-medication (TTE modeling). The superiority of RTTE modeling was found to be related to the ability to study PK–PD relationships and time-varying covariates. In particular the PK–PD relationship of the investigated drug was important, demonstrating the value of collecting PK. Finally, it was demonstrated how time-varying covariates and PK–PD relationship potentially can lead to skewed estimates of the potency of the investigated drug if not accounted for.
The primary assumption in the study was that the model provided relevant simulations of morphine consumption. The RTTE model for postoperative morphine consumption was developed in a relative small clinical population of 63 patients undergoing hip surgery [ , ]. However, simulations align well with reports from larger populations and the simulated 24 h oral morphine consumption in the non-intervention group (mean 24 mg, standard deviation 31 mg) was in accordance with oral morphine equivalents reported for 4208 patients undergoing hip joint replacement (mean 26 mg, standard deviation 36 mg) [ ]. Furthermore it was assumed for simulation that all time-varying factors, except those included in the model, did not influence morphine consumption. We did not include pain intensity or side-effects in this study, despite these are known to influence morphine consumption [ , , ]. In this work the time-varying day/night covariate principally represents any time-varying covariate and illustrates the impact that time-varying factors such as pain intensity and side effects could have on trial results. The RTTE modeling approach allows the study of more than one time-varying factor.
The PK and PK–PD relationship of drug X were hypothetical and set to values giving a clinically relevant morphine reduction within 24 h in a dose-range. It was assumed that drug X did not lead to any influential side-effects and without any effect delay. This may be unlikely for true candidate adjuvant analgesics, but in this setting, drug X served a tool to study the relative performance of the four analysis approaches. This is similar to hypothetical drugs in other model-based analyses of trial design and power for PK studies [ ] and PK–PD studies such as proof-of-concept trials in HIV-1 [ ], stroke and diabetes [ ].
It was assumed that PK of both drug X and morphine was accurately known. To obtain individual PK profiles blood samples (of drug X and morphine) would be required. Lack of accuracy of PK profile estimates would be expected to reduce the power of models relying on estimation of PK–PD relationships. Thus the power obtained by such models represents the ideal scenario where PK profiles have been obtained. How to accurately obtain PK profiles by optimal sampling of blood in postoperative pain studies was out of scope for this work and the reader is referred to research on optimal design of PK studies [ , ].
Finally, it was assumed that the model structure for RTTE and TTE was identifiable through model development. Since the true models were known a priory, no model development was performed for this analysis. In an analysis on real data the model selection procedure should be carefully considered as it may influence both power and significance level of the analysis. Furthermore, the strategy of fixing known parameters is only appropriate when there is confidence in the model. In this study the morphine model was fixed as if it was known in advance. The power calculations derived in this study, thereby represents the ideal scenario where the study design allows for estimation of morphine PK–PD, or where the drug properties are well known in advance. These factors, including PK, puts emphasis on the importance of appropriate study design; this work demonstrates the potential benefit in power and reduction in sample size that can be obtained with high quality data.
The results of this work show that a smaller sample size may be needed to obtain the same study power when using RTTE modeling rather than t-test, Mann–Whitney and TTE analysis for demonstrating effect on opioid consumption in postoperative pain. These findings confirm that cross-sectional and TTE analysis approaches are less optimal for the study of opioid consumption data [ ]. The benefits of the RTTE modeling approach seem obtained by optimal utilization of consecutive event data in a non-linear mixed effects modeling framework that allows the integration of covariates on a subject level. As demonstrated, the RTTE model that took into account time-varying covariates held better power than models without covariates and led to more accurate results. The parametric t-test performed and the non-parametric Mann–Whitney rank sum test performed similarly in these simulations and generally worse than the model-based analyses utilizing PK–PD relationships and time-varying covariates. Dexter also compared the t-test and Mann–Whitney rank sum test in a simulation study [ ] and found Mann–Whitney slightly better, however with both methods violating statistical assumptions. Neither of these cross-sectional tests utilized the information about opioid consumption in time to the same degree as RTTE modeling as evident by the great increase in power that could be obtained by extending trial duration with RTTE modeling, whereas only marginal benefits were obtained with t-test and Mann–Whitney test.
The improved study power between RTTE and TTE modeling is natural, as RTTE modeling is an extension to TTE modeling. Both the RTTE and TTE models were non-linear mixed effects models accounting for the same covariates, but the RTTE approach, utilizing information beyond the first analgesic event, allowed more data to support the analysis of drug efficacy. As many postoperative pain patients in the simulated setting had one or more events already before 24 h, extending trial duration beyond 24 h did not add much new information for the TTE modeling analysis whereas the power of RTTE modeling analysis increased with trial duration. Improvement in study power between RTTE and TTE modeling have also been found in other clinical settings such as in functional disability [ ].
The use of opioid consumption as an endpoint in postoperative pain trials have been much debated in the literature, due to the number of potential confounders for drug effect [ , ]. This study confirms that correctly evaluating time-varying factors and covariates, including PK–PD relationships are important for both the power and accuracy of the analysis. Ignoring time-varying covariates and morphine PK–PD when time-varying covariates and morphine PK–PD effects were present led to consistent under-prediction of opioid sparing potency of the hypothetical drug. The precision of efficacy estimates were most uncertain with doses of low effect size, and in with low efficacy drugs it may be difficult to practically separate results from models with and without PK–PD models of morphine. The demonstrated importance of accounting for PK–PD relationships and time-varying covariates can be extrapolated to any factor influencing opioid consumption. In this simple scenario several clinically important factors were omitted, including pain intensity and side-effects of opioids or adjuvant analgesics. Ignoring any such factors in future studies might skew results in a similar manner as the night/day covariate in this illustration. It remains a challenge how these factors are objectively quantified and controlled for. However if such high-quality data is available, RTTE modeling is an ideal analysis approach that can be used to account for opioid effects [ , ], include models of e.g. opioid related side-effects [ ] and pain intensity [ ] using non-linear mixed effects modeling.
Conclusions
In this study RTTE modeling proved superior to t-test, Mann–Whitney rank sum test and TTE modeling for demonstrating opioid sparing efficacy of adjuvant analgesics in postoperative pain trials. A smaller sample size was required related to the ability to take into account time-varying factors (including time-varying PK). Trials aiming to demonstrate opioid sparing efficacy benefit from long trial duration, but only if analysis methods such as RTTE modeling are used to utilize the increased information. For powerful and accurate analysis of adjuvant analgesic drugs it proved important to account for underlying factors such as PK–PD relationships and time-varying covariates. This can be done using RTTE modeling, which is a powerful approach for future postoperative pain trials.
