Introduction
Wilms tumor, or nephroblastoma, is an embryonal tumor of the kidney and the most frequently occurring solid tumor of childhood, excluding brain tumors [ , , ]. In the Caucasian population, age-standardized annual incidence rates of 6 to 9 per million have been reported for Wilms tumor [ ]. In Taiwan, the average annual incidence rate is 2.9 per million children under 15 years of age [ ]. Data obtained from the Childhood Cancer Foundation in Taiwan indicate that 7 to 18 new cases of Wilms tumor are diagnosed each year (1992 to 2000) [ ].
Several genes and chromosomal areas have been shown to be associated with tumor formation, including WT1 at chromosome 11p13, WT2 at 11p15, FWT1 ( WT4 ) at 17q12–21, and FWT2 at 19q13.33–13.41 [ , ]. More recently, CTNNB1 at 3p22.1, WTX at Xq11.1, and TP53 at 17p13 have been added to this list [ ]. WT1 was the first and most important gene to be isolated [ ]. Other loci, including 1p, 2q, 7p, 9q, 12q, 14q, 16q, 17p, and 22, have also been implicated in the etiology of Wilms tumor [ , ]. The risk of Wilms tumor conferred by mutations and epigenetic changes associated with these loci has been poorly characterized in Taiwan. From our previous studies, most DNA samples from peripheral blood lymphocytes and paraffin-embedded tumor specimens of Wilms tumors test negative for both constitutional mutations and somatic mutations in the WT1 gene [ ].
Over the past decade, few array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) analyses of Wilms tumors using human whole-genome bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) microarrays at 1-Mb resolution have been conducted [ , ]. With the advent of oligonucleotide arrays for CGH analysis, higher resolution mapping of DNA copy number changes has become available for clinical samples [ ]. The aim of the present study is to analyze the histological appearance and copy number aberrations using aCGH technology of six Wilms tumors from Taiwanese patients, to elucidate the molecular pathogenesis of this tumor.
Materials and Methods
Study Subjects
Six paraffin-embedded tumor tissue samples (W7 to W12, 4 males and 2 females) from Wilms tumor patients were provided by the Department of Pediatrics of National Taiwan University Hospital. None of the patients in this study were diagnosed with Denys-Drash syndrome, Frasier syndrome or Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. The study procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Chung Shan Medical University Hospital.
Histological Examination
The tumor tissues embedded in paraffin were sectioned at a thickness of 5 μm. Then, the sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and reviewed by two of the authors (T-C Hou and C-Y Kuo). Histologically, Wilms tumor is comprised of varying proportions of blastemal, stromal, and epithelial cellular components [ , ]. Wilms tumors made up of more than two-thirds epithelial components are designated as epithelial, whereas Wilms tumors made up of more than two-thirds stromal elements are categorized as stromal [ ]. If neither of these components is predominant, the tumor is designated as mixed [ ].
DNA Extraction
Genomic DNA was extracted from the sections with the QIAamp Tissue Kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer’s instructions and finally dissolved in 100 μl of TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mM EDTA). DNA concentration of each sample was measured using NanoDrop UV-VIS Spectrophotometer. These DNA samples from peripheral blood lymphocytes and paraffin-embedded tumor specimens of Wilms tumors test negative for both constitutional mutations and somatic mutations in the WT1 gene in our previous studies [ ].
Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) Analysis
Samples were screened on 60-K oligonucleotide CGH analysis at 0.1-Mb resolution, with SurePrint G3 ISCA V2 CGH Microarray Kit (Agilent). Random primed labeling sample and reference genomic DNAs (Promega) were prepared with Genomic DNA Enzymatic Labeling Kit (Agilent). Purification was carried out according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Labeled sample DNA (400 ng) was co-precipitated with an equal volume of labeled reference DNA (Promega) and 2.5 μg/μl human COT-1 DNA. The samples were hybridized to the microarray at 65 °C for 40 h. Scanning and image acquisition were carried out on Agilent Microarray Scanner D (Agilent). Data analysis was performed with Feature Extraction software v10.5 (Agilent). Copy number was determined by a conservative log2 ratio threshold. Amp refers to amplification (gain ≥0.25) and Del refers to deletion (loss ≤ −0.25). Profile deviations consisting of 10 or more neighboring oligonucleotides were considered genomic aberrations.
Results
Typing of Wilms Tumor by Pathologic Features
Microscopically, the blastemal component, the least differentiated cellular element, was predominant in W7 (hematoxylin and eosin staining, 400X in Fig. 1 a). W8 showed epithelial predominance with a range of differentiation (Fig. 1 b). W9 revealed mixed pattern of the three types of cellular components. However, more than two-thirds were blastemal and epithelial (Fig. 1 c). The stromal component, composed of undifferentiated mesenchymal cells, was predominant in W10 and W11 (Fig. 1 d and e). W12 was of mixed pattern with blastemal and epithelial cellular components (Fig. 1 f). Fig. 1 Histological cross-sections after hematoxylin and eosin staining show the Wilms tumor components: blastemal, stromal, and epithelial. W7 ( a ) is blastemal. W8 ( b ) is epithelial. W9 ( c ) is mixed with stromal, blastemal, and epithelial. W10 ( d ) and W11 ( e ) are stromal. W12 ( f ) is mixed blastemal and epithelial
Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) Analysis
Microarray comprised of 60,000 oligonucleotide probes, with a genome-wide resolution of approximately 0.1 Mb and high sensitivity, was used in this study. Derivative log ratio spreads (DLRs) for W7, W8, and W11 were 0.179, 0.319, and 0.262 respectively. We performed analysis twice for W9 and W10 and thrice for W12 to achieve DLRs of 0.750, 0.747, and 0.434 respectively. Many chromosomal aberrations on aCGH analysis (Fig. 2 ) revealed that the genetics of Wilms tumors are extremely complex. Amplifications of large DNA fragments were observed, for example 1q24.2-q44 in W7 and W10, 8q12.1-q24.22 and 12q12-q24.31 in W10 and W12 (Fig. 2 ). There was deletion of large DNA fragment 11p15-p12 in W8. Moreover, in W12, there were deletions of large DNA fragments 16q22.1-q24.3, Xp11.1-p22.3 and Xq11.1-q27.3.

Chromosomal aberrations present in more than three Wilms tumors are shown more detail in an additional file [see Additional file 1 ]. The most common chromosomal aberrations were amplifications. For example, amplifications (average log2 ratio 0.935, 1.088, 0.875, 1.341, 1.242, 0.781, and 0.615, respectively) of NDUFV1 at 11q13.2, ZIC2 at 13q32.3, SIX1 at 14q23.1, NR2F2-AS1, NR2F2 and MIR1469 at 15q26.2, SOX9 at 17q24.3, JAG1 and MIR6870 at 20p12.2, and GNAS at 20q13.32 were observed in all six Wilms tumors (Fig. 3 a, Additional file 2 ). In addition, amplifications (average 0.519, 1.545, and 0.695, respectively) of SOX2-OT and SOX2 at 3q26.32, GMDS at 6p25.3, and PLAGL1 and HYMAI at 6q24.2 were present in W9, W10, and W11 (Fig. 3 b, Additional file 2 ).

Moreover, amplifications (average 0.772, 0.869, 0.633, 1.110, 0.869, and 1.190, respectively) of SPEN, MIR5096, ZBTB17, C1orf64 , and HSPB7 at 1p36.21-p36.1, MYCNOS at 2p24.3, ZNF608 at 5q23.2, CPA5, CPA1, TSGA14, MEST, MESTIT1 , and MIR335 at 7q32.2, EYA1 at 8q13.3 and HNF1B at 17q12 in the FWT1 region and deletions (average − 0.634, −0.449, −0.528, −0.678, −0.753, −0.679, −0.472. −0.492, and − 0.609, respectively) of MIR4417, MIR4689, NPHP4, KCNAB2, and CHD5 at 1p36.32-p36.31, COL5A1 and more than 100 genes at 9q34.3, TDRD9 and over 40 genes at 14q32.33, CDH13, MIR3182, LOC102724163, and HSBP1 at 16q23.3, ANKRD26P1 and 21 genes at 16q11.2-q12.1, JPH3 and more than 50 genes at 16q24.2-q24.3, IZUMO2 and more than 300 genes at 19q13.33-q13.43, CASK, PPP1R2P9, LOC101927501, MAOA, MAOB, and NDP at Xp11.4-p11.3, and DMD and 11 genes at Xp21.1 were identified in W8, W9, and W12 (Fig. 3 c, Additional file 2 ).
In the WT2 neighboring H19DMR (differentially methylated region) region at 11p15.5, amplifications (average 1.190) of HOTS, H19, and MIR675 region were observed in W9 to W12 and amplifications (average 0.753) of H19, INS-IGF2, and IGF2 were observed in W9, W10, and W12 (Fig. 3 d, Additional file 2 ). Finally, amplifications (average 1.159) of KCNQ1 and KCNQ1OT1 neighboring KvDMR region were found in W9, W10, and W12 (Fig. 3 d, Additional file 2 ).
Discussion
Cytogenetic abnormalities are common to Wilms tumor [ ]. Kullendorff et al. demonstrated that 1q partial gains and trisomy 8 and 12 are associated with Wilms tumor [ ]. Gain of 1q is associated with poor outcome [ ], while 11p and 16q partial losses are associated with Wilms tumor [ , ]. The results of this study regarding amplifications of 1q24.2-q44 in W7, 1q21.1-q44 and 7q11.23-q36.3 in W10, and 7q11.21-q36.3 in W12 are consistent with the findings of several previous studies [ , , ]. Our results demonstrated partly or completely missing X chromosome in W12 (Fig. 2 ), suggesting that W12 is a Wilms tumor in Turner syndrome. A similar case was reported by Say et al. [ ]. Genomic imbalances identified at chromosome 2p24.3 were consistent with the results of previous aCGH studies, which reveal unbalanced gain in the MYCN region in Wilms tumors (Additional file 1 ) [ , ]. Our results pointed to the candidate genes, including DLX1 and DLX2 at 2q31.1, SIX1 at 14q23.1, and SALL1 at 16q12.1, consistent with the findings of Ruteshouser et al. which implicate 2q, 14q, and 16q in the etiology of Wilms tumor (Additional file 1 ) [ , ]. Moreover, 11p15 loss of heterozygosity is uniformly an early event in Wilms tumor development [ ]. Deletions of ASCL2 , C11orf21 , TSPAN32 , CD81, TSSC4, TRPM5, KCNQ1, and KCNQ1OT1 in the WT2 region at 11p15.5 were confirmed by the deletion of a large region of maternal 11p15.5 (2,239,763 - 42,771,741) in W8 (Fig. 2 , and Additional file 1 and 2 ). These results were consistent with those of Al-Hussain et al. in which deletion in WT2 is associated with epithelial or blastemal predominant Wilms tumor [ ].
Wilms tumor is genetically heterogeneous. Amplification is defined as the presence of a certain number of extra gene copies, as with neuroblastoma (e.g., MYCN ) [ ]. This phenomenon can be explained by hyperdiploidy with additions of single chromosomes or portions thereof. Our findings of amplifications of SIX1 at 14q23.1, MYCN at 2p24.3, and SALL1 at 16q12.1 are consistent with the results of Gadd et al. [ ]. Amplifications of NDUFV1 at 11q13.2, ZIC2 at 13q32.3, SIX1 at 14q23.1, NR2F2 and MIR1469 at 15q26.2, SOX9 at 17q24.3, JAG1 and MIR6870 at 20p12.2, and GNAS at 20q13.32 in all six Wilms tumors (Fig. 3 a, and Additional file 1 and 2 ) indicated that these genes are candidate and, therefore, important to tumorigenesis. Overexpression of SIX1 is a prognostic marker for colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, and gastric tumors [ , , ]. NR2F2 gene encodes nuclear hormone receptor (nuclear receptor subfamily 2, group F, member 2), which plays a critical role in controlling the development of a number of tissues [ , ] and regulates metastasis of colorectal adenocarcinoma cells [ ]. Our hypothesis is that amplifications of these genes may be involved in the essential events leading to tumorigenesis of Wilms tumor.
Molecular genetic classification of Wilms tumors remains to be clarified due to lack of molecular information. However, we can compare the genetic heterogeneity of inter-patient variability and histological appearances for further stratification. Histologically, W7 was classified as blastemal type, W8 as epithelial type, W10 and W11 as stromal type, and W9 and W12 as mixed pattern with varying proportions of two or three types of cellular components (Fig. 1 ). The mixed type may be the heterogeneous group that can be classified using these genetic results. Amplifications of SOX2-OT and SOX3 at 3q26.32, GMDS at 6p25.3, and PLAGL1 and HYMAI at 6q24.2 were observed in the three Wilms tumors of stromal type, W9, W10, and W11 (Fig. 3 b, Additional file 2 ). The stromal type Wilms tumor may be identified using anti-SOX3 or anti-PLAGL. Amplifications of MYCNOS at 2p24.3, EYA1 at 8q13.3, HNF1B at 17q12 were observed in the three Wilms tumors of epithelial type, W8, W9, and W12, and losses of 1p36.32 - p36.31, 9p24.3, 14q32.33, 16q 23.3, 16q11.2 - q12.1, 19q13.33 - q13.43, Xp11.4 - p11.3, and Xp21.1 were observed in the three Wilms tumors of stromal type, W9, W10, and W11 (Fig. 3 c, Additional file 2 ). The epithelial type Wilms tumors may be a unique and isolated subgroup that can be identified with antibodies such as anti-MYCNOS, anti-EYA1, or anti-HNF-1beta (hepatocyte nuclear factor-1beta) immunohistochemistry.
Molecular analysis may inform clinical and therapeutic management of these tumors. MIR1469 and MIR6870 have the highest number of potential targets and may play a significant role in Wilms tumors. Up-regulated miR-1469 is associated with lymphangiogenesis in human gastric cancer [ ], clear cell renal cell carcinoma [ ], and chronic myeloid leukemia [ ]. MiR-6870 has been detected in NUT midline carcinoma [ ]. Amplifications of MIR5096 and MIR335 were observed in the three Wilms tumors of epithelial type, W8, W9, and W12 (Fig. 3 b). MiR-5096 has been detected in glioma cells and elimination of miR-5096 in astrocytes has been found to decrease glioma invasion [ ]. In addition, Yan et al. identified miR-335 as a prognostic signature in gastric cancer [ ].
There are several limitations to this study. First, some samples were not within acceptable quality control limits. Despite this, DLR is not the only assessment of microarray probe data quality. DNA from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues may have been highly degraded leading to increased noise in microarray data and false copy number gains/amplifications and losses. However, it is improbable for noisy data to repeatedly recur. Second, the size limit of detectable copy number abnormalities using this array was an issue. The effective resolution of the microarray comprised of 60,000 oligonucleotide probes was approximately 100 Kb. This array can potentially detect abnormalities down to ~15–20 Kb, provided there are sufficient probes in the region, but at <10 Kb it may be not reliable. Even so, there were six probes for detecting the narrow region of 589 bp of MYCN at 2p24.3. Third, our samples were all from Taiwanese patients. Therefore, a population-based effect, such as founder effect, could not be excluded. Additional studies based on a larger number of cases, preferably international, are necessary to confirm our conclusions regarding tumorigenesis and pathognomonic findings.
Conclusions
In summary, our results indicated that amplifications of NDUFV1 , ZIC2 , SIX1 , NR2F2, MIR1469 , JAG1 , MIR6870, SOX9 , and GNAS may be the essential events in the tumorigenesis of Wilms tumor. Stromal type Wilms tumors may be specifically associated with amplifications of five genes and epithelial type Wilms tumors may be specifically associated with amplifications of at least 10 genes. Mixed type Wilms tumors with either epithelial or stromal component can be identified using these genetic technologies, which will help to further refine the molecular classification of Wilms tumors. The epithelial components of Wilms tumors may present a unique subgroup and should be isolated from the mixed or undifferentiated type. However, larger sample size is required to provide new insight into the molecular pathogenesis of Wilms tumor. We will continue to work to clarify the role of these chromosomal aberrations in the renal tumorigenesis of Wilms tumor.
