Introduction
Arterial thrombosis is a blood clot that develops in an artery. As a result of arterial thrombosis, flow of blood to major organs such as heart, brain and muscles can be obstructed. Arterial thrombosis of the brain arteries, which is named ischemic stroke, is associated with increased mortality risk, severe disability and life quality impairment. A considerable evidence of genetic background for ischemic stroke has been reported in twins and families (Flobmann et al. ). Also, some studies mentioned the strong association between the two most common gene mutations (FV c.1691G>A (Leiden), FII g.20210G>A) and ischemic stroke (Garcia et al. ; Ye et al. ; Herrmann et al. ). In terms of MTHFR mutations, the hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor for ischemic strokes (Linnebank et al. ). The 4G/4G and 5G/5G polymorphisms of PAI-1 have been reported as risk factor for ischemic strokes in many studies in adults from different populations (Cao et al. ; Kucukarabaci et al. ; Supanc et al. ). Polymorphisms of the beta fibrinogen gene have been shown to affect plasma fibrinogen levels and the risk of ischemic stroke (Wilhelmsen et al. ). Epidemiological studies have evaluated the association between Factor XIIIA (V34L) polymorphism and risk of ischemic stroke, but the results remain inconclusive (Corral et al. ). Platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIa, a membrane receptor for fibrinogen and Von Willebrand factor, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of acute coronary syndromes but has not been determined as a risk factor for ischemic stroke (Wagner et al. ). Otherwise the effects of other parameters of genetic thrombophilia panel, which were performed in this study, are not as strong as Factor II g.20210G>A and Factor V Leiden.
Factor V is a large single-chain glycoprotein, used in coagulation cascade and controlled by activated protein C. The most common Factor V variation (c.1691G>A), which causes to a p.Arg506Gln amino acid exchange, leads to Factor V resistance to activated protein (Kalafatis et al. ; Koster et al. ). Factor II converts fibrinogen into fibrin with its vitamin K-dependent glycoprotein structure. The most common variation of Factor II (g.20210G>A) leads to increased plasma prothrombin levels (Salem-Berrabah et al. ).
Platelet parameters have an important role in the pathogenesis of vascular diseases (Ross ). One of the most important platelet parameters, platelet count (PLT), was increased in stroke patients compared with healthy controls (O’malley et al. ). In this sense mean platelet volume (MPV) is a parameter of platelet function, and a positive indicator for platelet activity (Martin and Bath ), which is determined by producing more thromboxane A2, platelet factor 4 and thromboglobulin (Jakubowski et al. ; Martin and Bath ). Platelet volume and density are formed by the bone marrow megakaryocyte, which is progenitor cell of platelet at thrombopoiesis. Size of platelets does not change in blood circulation (Martin and Penington ; Thompson et al. ). Relationship between increasing values of MPV, acute cerebral ischemia (D’erasmo et al. ; Tohgi et al. ) and transient ischemic attack (D’Erasmo et al. ) have been reported. Platelet volume has a relationship with increased platelet synthesis (Bick and Hoppensteadt ).
In this study, we analyzed MPV, PLT values, Factor II g.20210G>A, Factor V Leiden, MTHFR (C677T, A1298C), PAI-1, β-fibrinogen, Factor XIIIA (V34L) and glycoprotein IIIa (L33P) polymorphisms of patients who have ischemic stroke history and searched the relationship between genetic thrombophilia markers and platelet parameters in ischemic strokes.
Materials and methods
A retrospective, clinical trial was performed by reviewing the ischemic stroke history (except cryptogenic events) of 599 patients, referred to Ataturk University Medical Faculty, Medical Genetics Department, Erzurum, Turkey, from January 2014 to May 2015. Our control group included 100 age-matched healthy patients who have not coagulative disease history. All patients provided written informed consent before participating in the study, which was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Ataturk University (decision number; 8/14). The choosing criteria of the study group were between 18 and 55 years, a history of one or more ischemic stroke with no other systemic or autoimmune diseases. All of the patients are chosen after undergoing a complete neurological examination. Diagnosis of stroke was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computerized tomographic (CT) scans of the brain. MPV and PLT values of patient group, which were analyzed before ischemic stroke event, were recorded from Ataturk University Medical Faculty archive system. We chose the subjects, who did not use medications affecting platelet functions such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, oral contraceptives, hormonal medications, anti-platelet and anti-coagulant medications.
Blood samples were collected into EDTA tubes. DNA of patients was extracted by QIAGEN ® , EZ1 ® Advanced XL (Veltek Associates, Inc.) system. The PCRs were performed in 50 µl reaction mixture containing 18.5 µl PCR master mix (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany), 2 µl of each primer, 0.5 µl Taq DNA polymerase, 17 µl H 2 O and 10 µl DNA in a thermal cycler (SensoQuest Labcycler, GmbH, Hilden, Germany) under the following conditions: 95 °C for 15 min (initial denaturation) followed by 32 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min (denaturation), 56 °C for 1 min (annealing), 72 °C for 80 s (extension) and a final extension at 72 °C for 15 min. Factor II g.20210G>A, Factor V Leiden, MTHFR (C677T, A1298C), PAI-1, β-fibrinogen, Factor XIIIA (V34L) and glycoprotein IIIa (L33P) polymorphisms were sequenced by QIAGEN ® , Pyromark Q24 System with the specific primers. Results were analyzed with PyroMark Q24 Advanced Software (Fig. 1 ). The results of the thrombophilia panel were used to classify the study group and control group into low and high risk for thrombophilia groups. The high-risk group included patients homozygous/heterozygous for Factor II g.20210G>A or Factor V Leiden mutations with/without any other polymorphism. The low-risk group included patients heterozygous or homozygous for MTHFR (C677T, A1298C), PAI-1, β-fibrinogen, Factor XIIIA (V34L) and glycoprotein IIIa (L33P) polymorphisms or negative in terms of both mutations and polymorphisms. Other thrombotic risk factors such as activated protein C resistance, protein C or S deficiency, homocysteine levels, anti-cardiolipin antibodies or lupus anticoagulant causes were eliminated as causative factors.

For patient group (before ischemic stroke event) and control group, two MPV and PLT had been recorded by 3 months, from Ataturk University Medical Faculty archive system; then average of two values were calculated for two groups. The platelet parameters (MPV, PLT) were determined using automated hematology analyzer (LXP50; Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). Patients were instructed not to take alcohol or cigarette or engage in heavy exercise for 24 h.
Statistical Analysis
All analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS version 15.0), and the statistical significance level was defined as p < 0.05. The data were given as mean ± SD and frequency.
Comparisons of the groups for MPV and PLT were carried out via Kruskal–Wallis test depending on the type of variables. The evaluation of genetic parameters (Factor II g.20210G>A, Factor V Leiden, etc.) and genetic score between two groups were performed via the Mann–Whitney U test. Genetic score between patients and control group for each polymorphism were also performed via the Mann–Whitney U test.
Results
Five hundred and ninety-nine patients who have ischemic stroke history and genetic thrombophilia factors were compared with 100 participants in control group who had not experienced arterial thrombotic event. The median age of patient group was 36.2, and the median age of control group was 33.5.
Thrombophilia risk groups were separated into high- and low-risk groups according to the review of American Heart Association (Voetsch and Loscalzo ), with mean MPV and mean PLT values in Table 1 . Of the 599 patients, 139 (23.2 %) of them, who were determined as a high-risk group, had Factor II g.20210G>A or Factor V Leiden homozygous/heterozygous mutations with/without any other polymorphism. Four hundred and fifty-seven (76.2 %) of them, who were determined as low-risk group, had heterozygous or homozygous polymorphisms of MTHFR (C677T, A1298C), PAI-1, β-fibrinogen, Factor XIIIA (V34L), glycoprotein IIIa (L33P) with no Factor II g.20210G>A and/or Factor V Leiden mutation, and 3 (0.5 %) had not any mutation and polymorphism. Of the 100 controls, 10 (10 %) of them who were determined as high-risk group had Factor II g.20210G>A or Factor V Leiden homozygous or heterozygous mutations. Eighty-nine (89 %) of them who were determined as low-risk group had heterozygous or homozygous polymorphisms of MTHFR (C677T, A1298C), PAI-1, β-fibrinogen, Factor XIIIA (V34L), glycoprotein IIIa (L33P) with no Factor II g.20210G>A and/or Factor V Leiden mutation, and 1 (1 %) had not any mutation and polymorphism. According to the results, there was a significant difference in Factor II g.20210G>A and Factor V Leiden mutation rates between patient group and control group. Prevalence of Factor V Leiden mutation was 16.6 % in ischemic stroke group and 8 % in control group ( p < 0.001), and also prevalence of Factor II g.20210G>A mutation was 7.8 % in ischemic stroke group and 2.5 % in control group ( p < 0.001).

In low-risk groups of patient and control groups, we accepted heterozygous polymorphisms as 1 point and homozygous polymorphisms for 2 points in scoring. There was not a significant difference between total polymorphism scores of control group and patient group ( p = 0.275). Moreover, in terms of evaluation of the polymorphisms scores between patient group and control group one by one, there was not a significant difference (MTHFR C677T ( p = 0.301), MTHFR A1298C ( p = 0.542), PAI-1 ( p = 0.421), β-fibrinogen ( p = 0.636), Factor XIIIA (V34L) ( p = 0.231), glycoprotein IIIa (L33P) ( p = 0.240) (Table 2 ).

Although there was a significant difference between MPV ( p < 0.001) and PLT (0.014) values of ischemic stroke and control group values, there was not significant difference between low-risk group patients and high-risk group patients, in terms of MPV ( p = 0.365) and PLT ( p = 0.392) values.
Discussion
Ischemic stroke is known as a type of arterial thrombosis which leads to mortality and morbidity. Arterial thrombosis is a complex and multifactorial event, and environmental interactions such as smoking and obesity are important for its pathogenesis (Voetsch and Loscalzo ). The most frequent genetic thrombophilia risk factor is Factor V Leiden mutation (Lindqvist and Dahlback ). Rosendaal et al. ( ) reported that the risk of venous thrombosis is increased 7–10 times with heterozygous mutation of Factor V Leiden and about 100 times higher risk with homozygous mutation of Factor V Leiden. Effect of Factor II g.20210G>A and Factor V Leiden mutations on venous thromboembolism is widely accepted, but their effect on arterial thrombosis is still controversial and not well explained (Kim and Becker ; Mueller et al. ). Factor V Leiden mutation prevalence was reported between 5 and 8 % in USA (Dahlbäck ), and its prevalence in Turkey is approximately 10 % (Akar et al. ). In the present study, we found prevalence of Factor V Leiden mutation 16.6 % in ischemic stroke group and 8 % in control group. Although prevalence rate of Factor II g.20210G>A mutation in Turkey is 2.6 % (Akar et al. ), we found prevalence of Factor II g.20210G>A mutation 7.8 % in ischemic stroke group and 2 % in control group. These results showed us that Factor II g.20210G>A and Factor V Leiden mutations are important risk factors for a type of arterial thrombosis, ischemic stroke. Also in an investigation in Saudi Arabia, which is a Middle East country like Turkey, new-born patients with stroke had higher frequencies of Factor V Leiden heterozygous or Factor II g.20210G>A heterozygous mutations than controls (Gawish ). However, a lot of conflicting results in meta-analysis studies have been published about the effect of Factor II g.20210G>A and Factor V Leiden on arterial thromboembolism (Samett and Khan ; Foley et al. ; Emmerich et al. ). According to Kim et al. (Kim and Becker ), reason for these conflicting results is by several limitations, including size, matching methods and identifying the study and control groups.
Association of the low-risk group polymorphisms in the present study (MTHFR (C677T, A1298C), PAI-1, β-fibrinogen, Factor XIIIA (V34L) and glycoprotein IIIa (L33P)) with ischemic stroke is not as clear as Factor II g.20210G>A and Factor V Leiden (Lane and Grant ). Therefore, in the present study, polymorphisms were scored for each of the low-risk group patients, to understand the effect of these polymorphisms in ischemic stroke. Homozygous polymorphisms were appreciated as 2 points; heterozygous polymorphisms were appreciated as 1 point. As a result, there was not a significant difference between polymorphism score of control group and ischemic stroke group.
MPV is an important platelet parameter, because larger platelets are more reactive and more prone to aggregation than the smaller platelets (Arévalo-Lorido et al. ). Previous studies showed that PLT value, which is the other platelet parameter of present study, reduced in stroke patients compared with healthy controls (O’malley et al. ). We also demonstrated that the MPV and PLT levels of ischemic stroke patients were higher than normal controls in our study.
Previously, relationship with platelet parameters and thrombophilia mutations was investigated in recurrent pregnancy loss (Aynıoglu et al. ). In this research (Aynıoglu et al. ), MPV and PLT values were higher than the control group, but the more important result was that MPV and PLT values of the patients, who have thrombophilia mutations, were higher than the patients, who do not have thrombophilia mutation. In the present study, an arterial thromboembolic disease, ischemic stroke was selected for investigating the association between platelet parameters and thrombophilia mutations. We have separated thrombophilia mutations into two groups: High-risk group included the severe thrombophilia mutations (Factor II g.20210G>A and Factor V Leiden) with/without any other polymorphism, and the low-risk group included the polymorphisms [MTHFR (C677T, A1298C), PAI-1, β-fibrinogen, Factor XIIIA (V34L), glycoprotein IIIa (L33P)] related with thromboembolism. MPV and PLT values of high-risk group and low-risk group were not significantly different from each other.
In conclusion, Factor II g.20210G>A and Factor V Leiden mutations are important risk factors for a type of arterial thrombosis, ischemic stroke, but MTHFR (C677T, A1298C), PAI-1, β-fibrinogen, Factor XIIIA (V34L) and glycoprotein IIIa (L33P) polymorphisms are not significant. The other important finding is although there was a significant difference between MPV and PLT values of ischemic stroke and control group, thrombophilia mutations and polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on MPV and PLT values in ischemic stroke patients.
