Introduction
Iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms represent the standard in qualitative PET imaging, due to their favorable noise properties, higher contrast, and better spatial resolution in comparison to filtered back projection. IR algorithms for oncologic PET have been recently largely improved with the introduction of time of flight (TOF) and resolution modeling (RM) of the PET systems.
In particular, TOF improves the signal-to-noise ratio, particularly in cancer studies with more challenging operating conditions, such as low counts, larger patients, low uptake, smaller lesions, and incomplete data sampling.
The RM recovers the loss of resolution and thus reduces the associated partial volume effect. The partial volume correction algorithms available on the last generation of PET systems belong to the RM techniques which incorporate the point spread function (PSF) into the system matrix used for forward and back projection. This can be done through an analytical approach, via Monte Carlo simulations , or by measured datasets. The software SharpIR (General Electric Healthcare) is based on Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the system response function. Another software, TrueX or High Definition (Siemens Medical Solutions) is based on measured datasets method, since the system response function of a 68 Ge point source is measured in different positions within the field of view of the PET system.
Today, all manufacturers have implemented a version of TOF and/or RM algorithms into conventional software for IR. However, no studies compared the improvement of TOF and RM on overall image quality of cardiac PET images acquired with different commercial scanner models.
The aim of this study was to characterize the performances of the TOF and PSF algorithms under controlled conditions simulating a typical 18 F-FDG myocardial viability study, using an anthropomorphic phantom and selected physical figures of merit for image evaluation. The performances of different scanner/software combinations were also studied. A multivariable analysis was used to take into account at the same time the relative effect of the different factors (reconstruction protocols, scanner/software combinations) on the specific figures of merit, considered as dependent variables.
Methods
PET/CT Scanners
Three nuclear medicine centers participated to this multi-center study allowing the use of the following PET/CT scanners: Gemini_TF (Philips), Biograph_mCT (Siemens), and Discovery_690 (General Electric). The scanner characteristics and the acquisition protocols are detailed in Table 1 . Table 1 Details of the PET scanners, acquisition protocols, and reconstruction algorithms with manufacturer default parameters Center N.1 N.2 N.3 PET Scanner Gemini_TF (Philips) Biograph_mCT (Siemens) Discovery_690 (General Electric) Crystal material LYSO LSO LYSO Acquisition protocol Voxel size (mm) 4.0 × 4.0 × 3.0 3.2 × 3.2 × 3.0 3.3 × 3.3 × 3.3 Axial field of view (cm) 18.0 21.6 15.7 Transaxial filed of view (cm) 57.6 70 70 Axial sampling interval (mm) 2.0 2 3.27 Emission scan duration (min) 10 10 10 Reconstruction algorithm Standard reconstruction TF-MLEM 3D-OSEM 3D-OSEM VUE-Point HD TOF Kernel 14.1 cm TOF VUE-point FX PSF – TrueX SharpIR Manufacturer default parameters Iterations 3 2 3 Subsets 33 24 18 Gaussian filter amplitude (mm) Relax = 1* 5 6 *Relax = Relaxation parameter controls the magnitude of change that each iteration makes to the image in the TF-MLEM algorithm
The Gemini_TF system uses, as the standard PET reconstruction, the TF-MLEM algorithm. The reconstruction protocol contain three modifiable parameters that can be set to adjust the image quality: (1) the total number of iterations (3 iterations 20 subset or 3 iterations 33 subset), (2) the so-called relaxation parameter that can be set between 1, 0.7, and 0.5 and controls the magnitude of change that each iteration makes to the image, and 3) the kernel width of the TOF, which can be set by the user at two levels. For the Gemini_TF system, the RM modeling is not available.
The Biograph_mCT and the Discovery_690 system use, as the standard PET reconstruction, a fully 3D-OSEM algorithm with all corrections (scatter, random, dead time, attenuation and normalization) incorporated into the IR scheme. In these systems, the user can independently specify the number of iterations and subsets and the amount of the transaxial post-reconstruction Gaussian smoothing, through the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the filter expressed in mm. Furthermore, the TOF information and/or a 3D model of the PSF can be added. It is important to note that the activation of TOF and/or PSF does not require the setting of any new parameter compared to those used with the 3D OSEM algorithm.
Image quality evaluation and statistical analysis were performed at an independent laboratory.
Anthropomorphic Phantom Preparation
A chest anthropomorphic phantom, with inserts simulating lungs, liver, left ventricle (LV) wall, LV chamber, and a transmural defect (TD), was used (Torso Phantom™ and Cardiac Insert™, Data Spectrum Corporation).
A prior multi-center analysis was performed in order to create a reference clinical database of 30 PET cardiac studies coming from the different centers in order to estimate the average ratio of radioactivity concentrations for the different inserts in the phantom study (Table 2 ). A PET cardiac study was included in the reference database if the standard procedures (manufacturers’ recommended acquisition and reconstruction protocol) were adopted for a normal-weight patient, independently of the clinical outcome of the PET cardiac study.

The TD insert (annular sector with a central angle of 45°, thickness of 1 cm, and height of 2.3 cm) was filled with non-radioactive water and located in mid septal position in the LV wall. The lung chambers were filled with Styrofoam™ beads and 18 F-FDG diluted in water to simulate lung tissue with density of about 0.3 g/cm 3 . The activity concentration in the lung chambers was obtained by dividing the activity in the lung inserts by their volumes, without taking into consideration the small voids created by the beads.
In each center, the phantom chambers were filled with 18 F-FDG solutions of different radioactivity concentrations: 14.0 ± 4.0 kBq/ml for LV wall, 4.4 ± 0.8 kBq/ml for liver, 3.8 ± 0.7 kBq/ml for LV chamber, 2.9 ± 0.6 kBq/ml for chest, and 0.9 ± 0.3 for lungs. All compartment contents were well mixed to avoid artifacts caused by inhomogeneous activity. The same phantom was used in all centers.
Phantom Acquisitions and Reconstruction
The accurate positioning of the phantom was secured by a flat portion of the phantom which allowed a reproducible positioning on the imaging bed and by marking the position of the first acquisition. In each center, two scan sets (with and without TD) were acquired with an emission scan duration of 10 minutes per bed. For each acquisition of Biograph_mCT and Discovery_690, four sets of images were then reconstructed with (1) IR; (2) IR + PSF; (3) IR + TOF, and 4) IR +PSF +TOF available at the different centers (default manufacturer’s parameter). For Gemini_TF acquisitions, only two sets of acquisitions were reconstructed: (1) IR and (2) IR +TOF. The settings of the IR algorithms used in this study are summarized in Table 1 .
Image Quality Evaluation
The reconstructed image sets were sent to an independent laboratory for processing using four physical figures of merit, associated to images quality in 18 F-FDG cardiac PET: (a) LV wall thickness; (b) Contrast between LV wall and inner chamber; (c) TD contrast with LV wall; and (d) FWHM of TD;
The first two indexes were evaluated using the image sets without TD insert in the LV wall. Measurements were repeated at least fourfold for each index, by using ImageJ software, to provide an estimate of the measurement errors.
LV wall thickness
The LV wall thickness was evaluated as FWHM of the myocardial signal in the mid-ventricular sections of the LV short axis. Twelve count profiles were obtained in 3 non-consecutive short-axis sections by drawing a line through the anterior, septal, inferior, and lateral walls. These profiles were fitted with Gaussian functions. The coefficients of determination r 2 of the fits were always >0.99. The FWHMs of each individual fit were averaged. The true wall thickness of the LV phantom insert is 10 mm.
Contrast between LV wall and inner chamber
Two ROIs were drawn on the mid-ventricular short-axis images in order to estimate \( \overline{{\eta_{\text{LV}} }} \) and \( \overline{{\eta_{\text{IC}} }} \) as the mean concentration activity per voxel for LV wall and inner cavity, respectively. The percent contrast between LV wall and inner cavity ( C IC ) was defined as the ratio between measured contrast ( C M ) and the true one ( C T ) as $${C_{{\rm{IC}}}} = \frac{{{C_{\rm{M}}}}}{{{C_{\rm{T}}}}} \times {\rm{ }}100,$$ where C M and C T were calculated using $$ C_{\text{M}} = \frac{{\overline{{\eta_{\text{LV}} }} - \overline{{\eta_{\text{IC}} }} }}{{\overline{{\eta_{\text{LV}} }} + \overline{{\eta_{\text{IC}} }} }}, $$ $$ C_{\text{T}} = \frac{{\overline{{c_{\text{LV}} }} - \overline{{c_{\text{IC}} }} }}{{\overline{{c_{\text{LV}} }} + \overline{{c_{\text{IC}} }} }}, $$ where \( \overline{{C_{\text{LV}} }} \) and \( \overline{{C_{\text{IC}} }} \) are the true activity concentrations in the inserts simulating the left ventricle and the inner chamber, respectively. The ideal value for C IC is 100% for all center acquisitions.
TD contrast in LV Wall
TD contrast in LV wall was evaluated both in LV short-axis and in horizontal long-axis images. ROIs were drawn on the central short-axis and horizontal long-axis images of the phantom acquisitions TD defect in order to estimate \( \overline{{\eta_{\text{LV}} }} \) and \( \overline{{\eta_{\text{TD}} }} \) as the mean counts per voxel for the LV wall and TD, respectively. The TD contrast in LV wall ( \( C_{\text{TD}} \) ) was defined as the percent difference between \( \overline{{\eta_{\text{LV}} }} \) and \( \overline{{\eta_{\text{TD}} }} \) as $$ {C_{{\rm{TD}}}}(\% ) = \frac{{\overline {{\eta _{{\rm{LV}}}}} - \overline {{\eta _{{\rm{TD}}}}} }}{{\overline {{\eta _{{\rm{LV}}}}} }} \times 100.$$
The ideal \( C_{\text{TD}} (\% ) \) is 100% for all center acquisitions.
FWHMTD
Due to the size of the cold defect insert (true dimension 23 mm), the FWHM was estimated using three consecutive long-axis section with a methodology similar to the one used for estimating the LV wall thickness but interpolating separately the two transition zones of the count profile (increasing and decreasing areas).
Statistical Analysis
The impact of the reconstruction protocols and scanner/software combinations on each of the image quality indexes was assessed by a two-way ANOVA. Reconstruction protocols and scanner/software combinations were considered as independent variables (factors) and image quality indices as dependent variables.
A post hoc test (Scheffé F test) was performed to identify the main sources of variability. If a significant F value was found for one independent variable, then this was referred as a main effect. When a main effect was found, then a post hoc test (Scheffé test) was performed to compare the dependent variable upon the levels of the factor 2 × 2, thus identifying the main sources of variability. Analysis was performed with Statistica version 6.0 (StatSoft Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA) using a two-sided type I error rate of P = 0.05. Values are reported and shown as least square averages ± standard errors of the means. Least squares averages are the best undistorted estimates of the marginal means of ANOVA plans with missing cells, while standard errors of the means quantifies how precisely we know the true mean for different reconstruction methods and scanner/software combinations, taking into account both the values of the standard deviation and the sample size.
Results
Clinical Studies
The mean injected activity in the 30 patients used for estimating the average ratio of radioactivity concentrations for the different inserts in the phantom study was 373 ± 28 MBq without significant differences among the different centers ( P = 0.26). The mean time delay between injection and acquisition was of 85 ± 28 minutes without significant differences among the different centers ( P = 0.06).

Discussion
A number of numerical and/or human observer studies have been performed in oncological PET imaging with RM and/or TOF to investigate lesion detectability. - The conclusions of these studies are generally consistent: RM and TOF result in improved observer performance, particularly in the detection of small and faint lesions. The use of both RM and TOF provides a cumulative benefit in lesion-detection performance, outperforming either RM or TOF alone.
Other investigators evaluated the performance of TOF and RM in the presence of “cold” defects as typically observed in 18 F-FDG PET studies for myocardial viability assessment. , With the clinical reconstruction protocols, TOF improved defect detectability, while both TOF and RM showed potential to improve observer performance. In simultaneous PET and magnetic resonance studies, the incorporation of RM within the framework of motion compensation improved defect detectability. Le Meunier et al , demonstrated, both in phantom and cardiac studies, that RM improves image contrast, defect definition, and contrast-to-noise ratio.
Although TOF and RM have been documented to increase the detection of myocardial defects in 18 F-FDG PET, their impact on quantitative tasks in cardiac PET images still requires thorough investigation. It has been suggested that the noise propagation associated with RM is more complex than what simplistic metrics are able to adequately characterize. Enhanced quantification does not necessarily translate into enhanced defect detection, and therefore, each has to be studied on its own.
In this study, we evaluated the effects of PSF, TOF, and combined TOF + PSF on cardiac PET/CT image quality as assessed by physical figures of merit in a phantom study. We also evaluated the impact of different scanner/software combinations on the same figures of merit.
Carefully controlled conditions of phantom preparation together with cross checking the actual activity concentrations determined using dose calibrators with the ones measured on PET images reduced the systematic errors, if present, to a minimum. A different way to cope with systematic errors has been proposed in a work by Sunderland and Christian on quantitative PET/CT scanner characterization in oncological trials.
Our results show that the combination of PSF and TOF improved the determination of LV wall thickness, the contrast between LV wall and inner chamber, and the transmural contrast in LV wall. Images reconstructed with PSF had smaller FWHM than those reconstructed without PSF, while no further decrease in FWHM was observed when applying TOF correction or a combined PSF + TOF correction. This finding suggests not only that the PSF and TOF corrections improve the FWHM of a similar amount, but also that the joint application of PSF and TOF is not able to provide an additional improvement in FWHM.
Images reconstructed with PSF had a superior C IC to those reconstructed without the PSF and similar to those with TOF. The C TD of images reconstructed with PSF were similar to those reconstructed with IR but inferior to those with the TOF. Differently from the FWHM, the joint application of PSF and TOF increased both C IC and C TD in comparison to images reconstructed with the PSF or TOF alone; moreover, images reconstructed with TOF improved the resolution characteristics of cold areas as measured by FWHM TD .
A combination of the PSF and TOF algorithm provided the overall best image quality among the reconstruction algorithms using either PSF or TOF or those using conventional IR alone. ,
In our study, the FWHM of the post-reconstruction gaussian filter was fixed at the optimized level for algorithms without PSF, for both the Biograph_mCT and the Discovery_690 scanners. Increasing the FWHM of the gaussian filter generally decreases the noise, and the contrast is also decreased. The degree of improvement in image quality by both PSF and TOF with a smaller FWHM gaussian filter should then be further improved.
The manufacturers’ recommended reconstruction parameters vary widely between systems making their comparisons a critical task since they impact on image quality. For instance, it is known that increasing the number of updates will improve the resolution but at the expenses of an increased noise. Likewise, the use of a post-filter reduces the noise in the reconstructed images but worsen the resolution. None of the IRs was “run to convergence,” that is, the iterations were stopped early in each case. A fine tuning of these parameters is performed by the manufacturers which produce software packages with default parameters adjusted for specific tasks. To avoid the introduction of misleading factors, we evaluated the performance of the PSF and TOF algorithms using the manufacturers’ recommendations for IR algorithms. However, the clinically optimal FWHM of the gaussian filter for both PSF and TOF must be assessed for each scanner to optimize the quality of PET images.
The differences between the different scanner/software combinations were more pronounced than those arising from the applications of different modalities of image reconstruction.
Regarding the impact of scanner/software combinations, using the default manufacturer’s protocols, the Gemini_TF had the largest LV wall thickness (12.7 mm) and the lower contrast between LV wall and inner chamber (64.8%), while showing similar values of TD contrast with LV wall (71.5%) to those of the Biograph_mCT (72.3%). The Biograph_mCT had intermediate values of LV wall thickness (11.9 mm) and contrast between LV wall and inner chamber (72.8%). The Discovery_690 had the smallest values of LV wall thickness (11.0 mm) and the highest C IC (75.2%) and C TD (76.8%).
The inferior performances of the Gemini_TF scanner may be partially ascribed to the greater voxel size and partially to the absence of a PSF algorithm in this scanner model. As commented before, the introduction of the PSF provides better values of LV FWHM, while the combined use of PSF and TOF provides better values of C IC and C TD.
One disadvantage of PSF modeling in IR is that it tends to slow convergence, so that the full benefit of PSF modeling is not achieved at clinical noise levels. The different behaviors of the two PSF modeling in Biograph_mCT and Discovery_690 could be explained by differences in the rate of convergence of the two algorithms. Indeed, when the exact same parameters for iterations (2) subset (24) and Gaussian filter (5 mm) used for Biograph_mCT image reconstruction were adopted for the reconstruction of images obtained with the Discovery_690, a further significant reduction in the FWHM of the LV wall thickness was obtained (from 11.4 ± 0.8 to 10.5 ± 0.8 mm; P < 0.001), as well as an increase in C TD (from 76.6 ± 2.4% to 84.0 ± 2.6%; P < 0.001).
One of the limitations of our study is that the results were obtained with an anthropomorphic torso phantom: whether the differences between the different scanner/software combinations and reconstruction methods observed in our phantom study might affect the clinical interpretation (e.g., affecting cardiac viability assessment) will require confirmation with dedicated clinical studies. Nevertheless, the analysis of C IC and C TD suggests that IR + TOF + PSF as well as Discovery_690 might improve the detection of residual viable myocardium using the normalized FDG uptake with the common cut-off value >50% of the maximum myocardial uptake. Moreover, the impact of the different resolutions in the calculation of LV volume cannot be neglected: the true volume of the LV cavity in the anthropomorphic phantom is 62 cm 3 and the real wall thickness of the simulated myocardial wall is 10 mm. Assuming a LV wall thickness of 11, 12, and 13 mm (as coarsely measured with Discovery_690, Biograph_mCT and Gemini_TF), we would obtain with a corresponding LV volume reduction of 14%, 26%, and 37%, respectively.
The phantom used in this study only allows the evaluation of ungated images; it is possible that LV activity in our acquisitions is lower than in clinical scans, since activity in LV myocardium derived from ungated images can be underestimated due to partial volume effects and motion blur. However, this underestimation should not exceed 20–30% and should be regarded as a second-order effect, being the LV myocardium activity concentration three-fold higher the one in the LV cavity (Table 2 ). Finally, only 18 F was investigated; thus, our results do not necessarily apply to other isotopes used to assess myocardial perfusion, e.g., 82 Rb rubidium or 15 O-water, with different positron energy and tissue penetration. However, present data could be of interest in consideration of the fore coming new perfusion tracers labeled with 18 F.
Conclusions
The introduction of both TOF and RM significantly increases the overall image quality in cardiac 18 F-FDG PET. The scanner/software combinations exhibit different performances in terms of image quality. These differences were more pronounced than those arising from the applications of different modalities of image reconstruction.
New Knowledge Gained
In nuclear cardiology, many scanners and methods are available, and they are all effective; but by some measures, there are differences between them, so we have to be careful when using cross comparisons. Nuclear cardiologists should understand the differences, especially when they build reference databases.
