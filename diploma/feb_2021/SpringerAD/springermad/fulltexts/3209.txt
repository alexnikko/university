Introduction
Achieving maximum profit by optimal use of resources is a common goal of any manufacturing industry in order to be sustainable in a highly competitive environment (rendered by the current market fluctuations and uncertainty, globalization, price regulations, etc.). The pharmaceutical companies in particular are facing enormous challenges due to high cost and lengthy time-to-market involved in new drug discovery and development (approx. $1.2 billion; 10–15 years), reduced effective patent life (about 12 years for a brand name medicine) [ ], higher regulatory constraints, and relatively inefficient quality by testing (QBT)-based batch product manufacturing [ , , ]. The strict rules and regulations mandated by the regulatory authorities (e.g., Food and Drug Administration (FDA), USA) on the pharmaceutical product attributes and processing schemes have increased the time-to-market for drugs along with a sharp increase in the total expenses of the pharmaceutical industries for introducing new drugs to the market [ ]. The competitive nature among the generics manufacturers has also resulted in a considerable increase in the research and development (R&D) cost [ ]. It has been estimated that the R&D cost of the pharmaceutical industries is much higher compared to other industries [ ]. Therefore, the relative proportion of the profit reinvested in R&D is also higher [ , ]. For example, in 2012, the US pharmaceutical industry alone invested approximately 16.4 % of global sales in R&D [ ]. It has been reported that only two out of ten marketed drugs are able to return revenues that match or exceed R&D costs [ ]. For a non-monopoly generic drug, the maximization of the profit margin is even a more challenging task because it is difficult for the manufacturer to decide the product cost due to globalized market competitions. Another challenge faced by the pharmaceutical companies is high fluctuations in product demand, which is often unpredictable and thus results in significant revenue losses. Therefore, in order to be profitable and sustainable, the pharmaceutical industry needs to be more operationally efficient. Because of several inherent advantages (e.g., reduced footprint, lesser manpower and resources, better quality control, flexible production rate, easier scale-up/number-up), continuous manufacturing has emerged as an alternative manufacturing strategy from traditional batch manufacturing [ , ]. However, real-time optimization of continuous tablet manufacturing process is still a challenging task and an open area of research.
Real-time optimization (RTO) combined with model predictive control (MPC) approach has been very successful in several manufacturing industries including oil and chemical industries [ , , , , , , , , ]. As mentioned in Darby et al. [ ], until 2011, there were 250–300 implementations of RTO technique utilizing commercially available rigorous flow sheet packages based on open-equation modeling techniques. As a consequence, manufacturing industries have been significantly benefitted through RTO-MPC techniques by maximizing the profit and improving the overall production process [ ]. However, as a result of different levels of complexities (e.g., solid handling, irregular powder flow), the real-time optimization coupled with MPC technique has not been applied yet for pharmaceutical tablet manufacturing. Therefore, a novel continuous manufacturing strategy integrated with inline/online monitoring tools (process analytical technology (PAT)) coupled with hybrid MPC-PID (proportional integral derivative)-based automatic feedback control system and moving horizon-based real-time optimization (MH-RTO) is needed. Through this approach, the overall profit can be maximized by optimal use of available resources and efficiently satisfying the flexible market demands with minimum rejections and manufacturing costs.
Revenue in the pharmaceutical industry depends on various factors, such as capital cost, operating cost, market fluctuations, product inventory, product quality assurance strategy, regulatory constraints, and product rejection. With increase in production rate, the total cost increases. However, if a robust production strategy is followed, product rejection, operating, and inventory cost can be significantly reduced, which are the important factors in increasing the total revenue, and once the break-even point is reached, a considerable amount of profit can be realized. Similarly, it is also important to track and analyze market demand in order to avoid production-demand mismatch and therefore result in a product surplus or deficiency scenario making a significant loss in terms of product inventory management and sales. Moreover, the product deficiency scenario in which the market demand cannot be fulfilled may lead to loss of regular customers giving an unrecoverable long-term loss. Therefore, the optimization strategy needs to be based on moving horizon-based technique.
With all these constraints present, it is highly desired that the pharmaceutical industries adapt efficient R&D and production strategies in order to be profitable and sustainable. Several investigations are being conducted for the case of continuous processing schemes for pharmaceutical industries. The benefits of continuous pharmaceutical processing have been illustrated in literature by few authors with examples of continuous downstream tablet manufacturing operation [ , ] and continuous active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) purification/processing operation [ ]. Quality by design (QbD) and PAT and real-time dynamic optimization-based continuous product manufacturing will lead to higher yield and less product rejection. Therefore, a transition towards continuous processing scheme will benefit the pharmaceutical industries in enhancing the product quality.
Because of complexities associated with powder flow, an efficient optimal operation of a continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing processing is still a challenging task. In an optimal manufacturing approach proposed in this work, the integrated moving horizon-based RTO can be used at the supervisory level and provides the operational set points for the control system in real time. The hybrid MPC-PID control system developed in previous work then ensures that the required product is produced with desired quality with minimum usage of resources and time [ ]. MPC has proven to be a very effective control strategy over the last 30 years and has been widely used in process industries such as oil refining, bulk chemical production, and aerodynamics [ ]. However, in comparison to PID control, MPC is more complex to implement in practice and is computationally more expensive. Singh et al. have previously proposed a hybrid MPC-PID control strategy in which the advantages of both MPC and PID have been integrated, and it has been demonstrated that the hybrid approach is the best approach to control the continuous pharmaceutical tablet manufacturing process [ ].
In this manuscript, a novel moving horizon-based real-time optimization scheme has been developed and integrated with the hybrid MPC-PID-based automatic feedback control system through which the overall profits can be maximized by optimal use of available resources. The control- and optimization-relevant process models have been developed. The performance of the integrated moving horizon-based RTO and advanced hybrid MPC-PID control system has been demonstrated through simulation-based virtual experimentation of continuous tablet manufacturing process. The developed framework however is generic and can be applied for any other processes.
Background
In the last decade, few economic analyses of continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing have been performed [ ]. Several discussions have been provided by authors in the literature which highlight the challenges faced by the pharmaceutical industries and the steps that can be followed to increase the profit and reduce the health care cost [ , , , ]. Schaber et al. have provided an economic analysis of integrated continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing and demonstrated that the continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing is more economical than batch pharmaceutical manufacturing [ ]. Basu et al. have analyzed the manufacturing costs in pharmaceutical companies based on the economic data reported by some leading pharmaceutical companies [ ]. However, a more detailed study on optimization of pharmaceutical manufacturing processes is necessary since the pharmaceutical industries are transitioning towards an efficient continuous processing framework. Sen et al. have performed an optimization study on a continuous API purification process to obtain optimal processing conditions [ ]. Gao et al. have optimized the continuous blending process to obtain the optimal operating conditions [ ].
Few attempts have also been made towards the design and implementation of a control system for the tablet manufacturing process so that the process can be operated at optimal conditions and products with desired critical quality attributes (CQAs) can be obtained [ ]. Few researchers have reported model-based control system design (using PID only or a hybrid MPC-PID controller strategy) of continuous pharmaceutical processing frameworks including continuous downstream tablet manufacturing operation [ , , ]. Plant-wide control schemes (studies conducted on a pilot plant) describing continuous synthesis and processing of API have been reported as well [ ]. Singh et al. [ ] have proposed a systematic framework for implementation of the control system into continuous tablet manufacturing pilot plant and experimentally demonstrated that hybrid MPC-PID control scheme performs better than PID-only-based regulatory control scheme [ ].
The advantages and recent developments in real-time optimization of chemical processes (with the illustration of a batch polymerization process) have been provided by Francois et al. [ ]. Boss et al. have reported real-time optimization of a pharmaceutical freeze-drying process [ ]. Giridhar et al. have discussed a real-time process management system which is similar to an automatic control system that can be employed in a pharmaceutical production plant for maintaining the process at the desired trajectory [ ]. Yang et al. have discussed the implementation of a real-time updated MPC strategy in case of batch processes [ ]. However, there is no work reported in the literature on real-time optimization with efficient control strategies in order to improve the overall system performance.
Materials and Methods
Open-loop experiments have been performed to generate the step response data needed to develop the transfer function model. Closed-loop experiments have been also performed to practically demonstrate the performance of hybrid MPC-PID control system prior to integrating the MH-RTO [ ]. The experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1 . Acetyl-para-aminophenol (APAP) is used as an API, silicified microcrystalline cellulose (SMCC) is used as an excipient, and magnesium stearate (MgSt) is used as a lubricant. API and lubricant compositions have been fixed to 15 and 1 %, respectively. A cylindrical chute is used to interface with the NIR for real-time data collection (see Fig. 1 , bottom). MicroNIR™ 1700 Spectrometer (JDSU) has been used to measure the API composition at blender outlet. This is an ultracompact, lightweight NIR tool that relies on a variable linear filter (VLF) as the dispersing element and uses advanced coating design and manufacturing technology. The wavelength range of this NIR sensor is 950–1650 nm, typical measurement time is 0.5 s, minimum integration time is 10 μs, and the optimum sample distance from detector is 3 mm. Integration time 40,000 μs, the number of samples averaged per scan 50, and measurement time 1 s have been used for this study. IRSE (JDSU) software is used to operate the MicroNIR; 100 % reference is set by placing MicroNIR in contact with spectralon (99 % reflectance), and zero reference is set by pointing it away from the light. Normalized reflectance values are computed from the dark, raw 100 % reference, and raw sample scans as follows: Normalized = (Sample–Dark)/(Reference–Dark). Data are automatically imported to “Process Pulse (CAMO)” chemometric software for real-time prediction. A partial least square (PLS)-based model developed in UnscramblerX and a prediction engine (OLUPX) are used for real-time NIR prediction. The validation of the PLS NIR prediction model is reported by Singh et al. Software synTQ (Optimal) has been used as a PAT data management tool. OLE process control (OPC) has been used as data communication protocols. DeltaV (Emerson) has been used as a control platform where the control loops have been implemented. The actuator signal from the control platform has been sent to the plant using fieldbus devices. The blender is connected with the control hardware via serial ports, and feeders are connected via DeviceNet. A system identification toolbox (MathWorks) has been used to develop the transfer function model. An MPC toolbox (MathWorks) has been used to design the MPC, and Simulink (MathWorks) has been used to simulate the process. fminsearch function has been used to perform the optimization. This function uses the Nelder-Mead method (a direct search algorithm) to perform the optimization [ ]. Fig. 1 Experimental setup for real-time monitoring and control of continuous tablet manufacturing process
Continuous Tablet Manufacturing Process
Process and Pilot Plant
A continuous direct compaction tablet manufacturing pilot plant has been installed and situated at C-SOPS located at Rutgers University, NJ, USA. A snapshot of the pilot plant is shown in Fig. 21 (see Appendix A ). The pilot plant is built in three levels at different heights to take advantage of gravitational material flow. The top level is used for feeder placement and powder storage, the middle level is used for de-lumping and blending, and the bottom level is used for compaction. There are three gravimetric feeders (K-Tron)—with the capability of adding more—that feed the various formulation components (API, excipient, etc.). A co-mill (Glatt) is also integrated after the feeder hopper primarily for de-lumping the powders and creating contact between components. The co-mill eliminates any large, soft lumps within the powder. The lubricant feeder is added after the mill to prevent over-lubrication of the formulation in the mill. These feed streams are then connected to a continuous blender (Glatt) within which a homogeneous powder mixture of all the ingredients is generated. Subsequently, the outlet from the blender is fed to the tablet press (Fette) via a rotary feed frame. The powder blend fills a die and is subsequently compressed to create a tablet. Details of the pilot plant have been previously reported [ ], and the open-loop [ , , ] as well as the closed-loop [ , , ] operation has been extensively studied.
Optimization and Control-Relevant Transfer Function-Based Process Flow Sheet Model
The control-relevant process model involving transfer functions has been developed for this process in Simulink (MathWorks) through dynamic step change response analysis. The step response data for transfer function models have been generated from the detailed process flow sheet models simulated in gPROMS (Process System Enterprise) augmented with experiments and detailed particle level discrete element method (DEM) simulation [ , ]. The details of the DEM simulation and the fitting of the transfer function model from experimental data are given in Appendix A . The integrated flow sheet model for direct compaction continuous tablet manufacturing process has been previously reported [ , ]. The detailed developments of these models are reported elsewhere and summarized here. The mathematical model for powder blending, an important but complex unit operation, has been previously developed [ ]. The model for the tablet compression process is previously reported in Singh et al. [ ]. This model is based on the Kawakita powder compression model [ ] and the tablet hardness model described in Kuentz and Leuenberger [ ]. The dissolution model has been adapted from Kimber et al. [ ]. The models for the different unit operations have been developed and included in gPROMS library to facilitate the integrated flow sheet modeling. The model of each unit operation and corresponding references related to model development and validation are given in Table 7 . Table 8 summarizes the inputs and outputs of the transfer function models along with the data sources that have been used to generate the step response data needed to build the transfer function model.
Systematic Framework for Integration of Moving Horizon-Based Real-Time Optimization with Advanced Hybrid MPC-PID Control System
Moving Horizon-Based Real-Time Optimization
A moving horizon-based RTO technique has been developed and applied for the optimization of the continuous tablet manufacturing process. In moving horizon-based RTO, the optimization algorithm takes into account the inventory accumulated during past operation and future demands within a horizon for maximization of the profit in an operating interval. The considered time horizon is flexible and needs to be specified by the user. The moving horizon-based optimization technique takes into consideration future time steps that are changing moving ahead during operation. The moving horizon-based RTO scheme is shown in Fig. 2 . As shown in the figure, the product demand is specified by the user as the input for optimization. The future production rate set point is then generated within the moving horizon using RTO. The achieved profile for future production rate is generated using the process model. The achieved production rate profile is then compared with the demand profile, and the future product deficiency is calculated within the moving horizon by subtracting the production from demand. The past accumulative inventory has been calculated by subtracting the past production rates from past demands. The process is then optimized incorporating the forecasted product deficiency and past accumulative inventory, and the final production rate set point is then generated (see “ Optimization Model ”). The generated production rate set point is implemented into the process. The inventory generated in the current step is then added to the past accumulated inventory, and the procedure is repeated to generate the next production rate set point. The process together with the hybrid MPC-PID control system is simulated in Simulink, and the optimization module is developed in MATLAB using the Nelder-Mead (fminsearch function in MATLAB) optimization method [ ]. Fig. 2 Moving horizon based real-time optimization scheme
Hybrid MPC-PID Control Architecture
In a hybrid control scheme, the model predictive controller is placed at the supervisory level under which the PID-based regulatory controllers are integrated in a cascade scheme. The MPC provides the set point for the slave PID controller. A combination of MPC and the PID is used for the control strategy since MPC is better at handling process delays and process variable interactions. For direct compaction tablet manufacturing process, the control variables are the blend concentration, the blender holdup, the powder level in the instrumented hopper, and the tablet weight and hardness which are inputs to a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) MPC that generates corresponding actuators in the case of single loop and the set points for the slave PID controller in the case of the cascade loop [ ]. Actuators for blend concentration, blender holdup, powder level in the instrumented hopper, tablet weight, and tablet hardness are ratio set point, weir height, rotary valve speed, main compression force set point, and punch displacement, respectively. Main compression force is controlled through a slave PID controller by manipulating the fill depth.
Systematic Methodology to Integrate Moving Horizon-Based Real-Time Optimization with Advanced Hybrid MPC-PID Control Architecture
The integration of the MH-RTO with the hybrid MPC-PID control system involves eight hierarchical steps as shown in Fig. 3 . The starting point is to define the problem in terms of process and cost specifications. Then the control-relevant transfer function process model needs to be developed through step response analysis. The step response data can be generated either through simulation of fundamental process models or through a series of step change experiments (steps 1–2). Commercially available tools, for example the system identification toolbox of MATLAB (MathWorks), can be used to develop the transfer function model based on the acquired data. The next step is to design the hybrid MPC-PID control system (step 3). The design of the hybrid MPC-PID control system involves identification of control variables, pairing of control variables with corresponding manipulating variables, identification of the control variables for which MPC is needed and for which PID is sufficient [ ]. Subsequently, the PID and MPC controllers need to be implemented in steps 4 and 5, respectively. Economic and cost data are collected in step 6 and economic analysis is performed. The MH-RTO module is then integrated with the hybrid MPC-PID control architecture for real-time optimization and advanced control (step 7). The performance of the integrated MH-RTO and hybrid MPC-PID control system is evaluated based on process simulation. Steps 1–7 need to be repeated until satisfactory performance is achieved. If the critical process parameters are controlled within control limits (e.g., -2 % to +2 % of the set point), the desired critical quality attributes (specified by regulatory authority) has been achieved, and the maximum possible profit (i.e., global maxima) has been obtained, then the performance can be considered as satisfactory. After obtaining a satisfactory response, the integrated MH-RTO and hybrid MPC-PID system can then be implemented into the plant using any commercial control platform (e.g., DeltaV (Emerson)), physical sensors (e.g., near-infrared (NIR)), PAT data management tool (synTQ), control software and hardware, optimization and simulation tool (e.g., MATLAB and Simulink), and OPC communication protocol. For implementation, the controller inputs and outputs need to be integrated with the sensors and plant, respectively, in operational mode, and it should remain connected with the process model in the optimization mode. Fig. 3 Systematic procedure to integrate MH-RTO with the hybrid MPC-PID control architecture
Integration of MH-RTO and Hybrid MPC-PID Control System into Continuous Tablet Manufacturing Process
The integrated MH-RTO and hybrid MPC-PID control architecture is shown in Fig. 4 . As shown in the figure, the MH-RTO provides the optimized production rate to the hybrid MPC-PID control system. The total powder flow rate set point is calculated based on the optimized tablet production rate and desired tablet weight set point ( F set = r opt × W _set). The tablet press operating parameter (turret speed) is calculated based on the optimized production rate and tablet press specifications \( \left(\mathrm{Turret}\kern0.5em \mathrm{speed}=\frac{r_{\mathrm{opt}}}{\mathrm{No}.\kern0.5em \mathrm{of}\kern0.5em \mathrm{stations}}\right) \) . The hybrid MPC-PID control system then ensures that the control variables are maintained within the control limits. Fig. 4 Direct compaction tablet manufacturing process integrated with MH-DRTO and hybrid MPC-PID control system
The control architecture consists of the closed loops for blend composition, blender holdup, powder level of instrumented hopper, tablet weight, and hardness. As shown in Fig. 4 , set points and achieved signals of these control variables are the inputs of the MPC block. The MPC outputs (ratio set point, weir height, rotary valve speed, main compression force set point, punch displacement) are the manipulating variables. MPC tuning parameters and other constraints such as limits of control variables and actuators can be also directly provided as the inputs to the MPC block. The first control variable is the blend composition. An NIR sensor was placed at the blender outlet for blend content uniformity measurement. This is the input for the master model predictive controller, which generates the feeder ratio set point. Based on this ratio set point and the total powder flow rate, the individual flow rate set points for API, excipients, and lubricant feeders are calculated and then controlled by manipulating the respective feeder RPMs using built-in feeder controllers based on PID logic. The second control variable, blender holdup, is controlled by manipulating the weir height placed at continuous blender outlet. The third control variable, instrumented hopper level placed in between blender and tablet press, is controlled by manipulating the rotary valve speed. Instrumented hopper level is desired to be controlled because a powder layer needs to be always present in front of NIR sensor and it could also affect the final tablet properties. The instrumented hopper level is monitored by a webcam, which takes the image of powder level in real time and passes it to a MATLAB image analysis toolbox, which converts the picture to a univariate signal. This is then compared against two calibration points. One point is the value when there is no powder in the instrumented hopper (chute) and one when the chute is full with powder. The first value is 0 % level and the second is 100 % level. The point where the live value falls between the two calibration points is the calculated level. The level set point is 50 %. The tablet weight is the fourth control variable. The tablet weight is controlled through a cascade control arrangement using master and slave loop. Master loop provide the set point for the slave controller, which controls the main compression force by manipulating the fill depth. The fifth control variable, tablet hardness, is controlled by manipulating the punch displacement. Note that the hardness control loop is typically activated only when the measured hardness deviates by a certain percentage (e.g., 2 % of set point) from the desired set point. This is the standard approach implemented in commercial tablet compaction to control tablet weight and hardness [ ]. The Checkmaster (Fette) hardware is used for tablet weight and hardness measurement in real time [ ]. The implementation of the control system into the pilot plant has been previously reported [ ]. The control of blend content uniformity has been previously experimentally demonstrated [ ].
As shown in Fig. 4 , the achieved critical quality attribute signals (tablet weight, hardness, API composition, RSD) are sent to a tablet screening module in real time where the obtained CQAs have been compared with the specified acceptable limits. The tablets that satisfy the desired CQAs are collected while the tablets that are not accepted are rejected automatically. The rate of production of qualified tablet and rejection rates are used as the inputs for optimization module to maximize the profit. The achieved tablet weight is also used as the input for optimization module to calculate the rejection losses. The other inputs are cost specifications, process specifications, production specifications, and product demand. The cost specifications depend on various factors including suppliers, plant location, and current market scenario and have been discussed in detail in “ Cost Analysis of the Direct Compaction Continuous Tablet Manufacturing Process .” The process specifications include the operational conditions and limitations of each unit operation as well as the specifications of raw materials. Product specifications include the acceptable limits of CQAs and depend on the current regulations. Product demand can change based on the market fluctuations. Optimization module then generates the optimized production rate by minimizing the total cost as an objective function.
Cost Analysis of the Direct Compaction Continuous Tablet Manufacturing Process
A new dedicated plant is considered as a case study for the cost analysis. A 335-day working year is considered, with 30 days dedicated for maintenance, cleaning, and startup/shutdown [ ]. One production line per plant was assumed. The various costs that have been considered in the optimization of the process are discussed in the following sections. It should be noted that the costs depend on various factors (e.g., specifications, suppliers, site location, country, taxation rules, shipping methods, etc.) and are also time dependent. An approximated cost has been used in this manuscript for the demonstration of the integrated moving horizon-based RTO and hybrid MPC-PID methodology.
Capital Expenditures (CapEx)
The capital expenditure includes all costs associated with a company for procuring or enhancing its physical assets (i.e., processing equipment, buildings, other industrial structures, etc.) [ ]. The following are the components of capital expenditure: Free on board cost This is the cost of all processing equipments excluding any ancillary equipment, delivery, electrical, engineering, or piping expenses. Details of the main equipments required for direct compaction tablet manufacturing process along with their prices are given in Table 1 .

Delivered equipment cost The delivered equipment cost is the summation of FOB and delivery cost. Installation cost This includes the automation, electrical, piping, and engineering expenses for installation of all equipment and also includes any ancillary equipment cost. The installation cost can be calculated from Eq. ( 1 ). $$ \mathrm{Installation}\kern0.5em \mathrm{cost}=\left(\mathrm{Wroth}\kern0.5em \mathrm{factor}-1\right)\times \left(\mathrm{Delivered}\kern0.5em \mathrm{equipment}\kern0.5em \mathrm{cost}\right) $$ (1) The average wroth factor 3.5 has been taken from Schaber et al. [ ]. The delivered equipment cost can be calculated as follows: $$ \mathrm{Delivered}\kern0.5em \mathrm{equipment}\kern0.5em \mathrm{cost}=\mathrm{F}\mathrm{O}\mathrm{B}+\mathrm{Delivery}\kern0.5em \mathrm{cost} $$ Battery limits installation costs The total cost of installation of battery of processing units along with their utilities and services can be grouped under battery limits installation costs (BLIC). Equation ( 2 ) gives BLIC. $$ \mathrm{BLIC}=\mathrm{F}\mathrm{O}\mathrm{B}+\mathrm{Delivery}\kern0.5em \mathrm{cost}+\mathrm{Installation}\kern0.5em \mathrm{cost} $$ (2) Buildings, structures, and contingency This comprises 40 % of BLIC. Service facilities This comprises 20 % of BLIC. Instrumentation and software Table 2 lists the various instrumentation and software required and their cost.

The total capital expenditure is the summation of all the items listed from 5 to 9 in Table 3 . The detail of the capital expenditure is given in Table 3 . The total capital expenditure is US$12.1892 million. The distribution of the total capital expenditure is shown in Fig. 5 . As shown in the figure, the 57.74 % of the total capital expenditure is invested for battery limits installation which includes delivered equipment cost as well as installation cost; 23.09 % of the total capital expenditure is invested for building, structure, and contingency. The service facilities require 11.55 % and instrumentation and software requires 5.98 % of total expenditure; 1.64 % of the total expenditure can be used for other miscellaneous expenses not included here.

Operating Expenditures
These include all costs associated with the plant operation. The continuous plant representation has not been commercialized yet to best of our knowledge, so the values for labor, materials handling, and QA/QC savings represent our best estimates at this time. For example, OpEx savings are expected in QA/QC since some manual sampling and analysis can be replaced by online analysis and feedback control. The various components of the operating expenditure are as follows: Labor cost Table 4 lists the type of operator required in this plant and the cost involved for each operator. Note that only the minimum required number of employees directly associated with the plant is listed. The employees from the other departments might also need to be get involved in order to get the product finalized. Table 4 Labor cost Labor Number Salary ($/(person-year) Total salary ($/year) Control engineer 1 140,000 140,000 PAT expert 1 140,000 140,000 Plant operator 2 100,000 200,000 Helper 2 80,000 160,000 Quality assurance and product approval persons 1 130,000 130,000 Sales person 1 110,000 110,000 Manager 1 180,000 180,000 Total 1,060,000 Materials handling and storage The material handling and storage cost depends on various factors and can be optimized by decreasing the number of times employees must touch the material, reducing the time and distance it travels, paring equipment costs, avoiding damage, and boosting storage capacity. Ultimately, controlling material handling costs increases productivity and brings a company more profit [ ]. The material handling and storage cost is assumed to be $100,000/year. Quality assurance and control This includes the additional costs associated with quality management through good manufacturing practice (GMP)-based product manufacturing. The quality assurance and control cost have been considered to be $150,000/year. Utilities Utility cost depends on the total amount of the material used. It has been considered to be $1.5/kg material input [ ]. Raw material cost The raw materials used in this process have been listed in Table 5 along with their price. Note that, the raw material cost is based on current market price and USA-based supplier. The given APAP and MCC price are for minimum order of 100 kg. Table 5 Raw material price Raw materials Bulk price ($/kg) APAP 12.40 MCC 13.15 MgSt 47.00 Working capital Gross working capital is equal to a company’s current asset. Net working capital can be defined as the difference between current assets and current liabilities. A positive working capital is highly desired to ensure that the company is able to pay its current short-term debts. In this study, the working capital has been considered to be 3.5 % of the material cost as suggested in Schaber et al. [ ]. Depreciation cost The depreciation cost is calculated as follows: $$ \mathrm{Annual}\kern0.5em \mathrm{depreciation}\kern0.5em \mathrm{cost}=\frac{\mathrm{Cost}\kern0.5em \mathrm{of}\kern0.5em \mathrm{fixed}\kern0.5em \mathrm{asset}-\mathrm{Residual}\kern0.5em \mathrm{value}}{\mathrm{Useful}\kern0.5em \mathrm{life}\kern0.5em \mathrm{of}\kern0.5em \mathrm{asset}\kern0.4em \left(\mathrm{years}\right)} $$
Other Cost Items
Other cost items include the following: Rejection cost On rejection of product, the additional cost incurred is for waste disposal. Waste disposal has been considered to be $4/kg of waste materials or products. Inventory cost The additional cost is associated for maintenance of the inventory. The inventory cost considered for this study is $0.11/tablet. Sale price of pharmaceutical tablet The price of the product is $0.2/tablet. This is based on the cost of APAP-based tablets available in the market.

In this section, the optimization model for direct compaction tablet manufacturing process is described.
The profit is calculated as follows: $$ \mathrm{Profit}={\displaystyle \underset{0}{\overset{t_{\mathrm{h}}}{\int }}\left(\mathrm{Sales}\times \mathrm{Price}-\mathrm{Rejection}\kern0.5em \mathrm{cost}-\mathrm{Total}\kern0.5em \mathrm{operating}\kern0.5em \mathrm{cost}-\mathrm{Inventory}\kern0.5em \mathrm{cost}\right)\mathrm{d}\mathrm{t}} $$
where t h is the operational time for one optimization interval which corresponds to the time of the moving horizon considered. The objective function represents the profit maximization.
Process Optimization
The result of this optimization is the optimum production rate. As shown in Fig. 6 , the product rejection and the inventory strongly depend on production and demand rates. The rejection rate is higher at a very low production rate as well as at a very high production rate. Because of equipment operational limits and control failures, the product does not meet the quality constraints in these production rates and therefore needs to be rejected. As shown in Fig. 6 , on increasing the production rate, the tablets that meet the quality constraints also increase, but there is an optimum rate beyond which the rejection rate starts to increase. Inventory starts to increase when the number of accepted tablets exceeds the demand. Fig. 6 Change of the cost components as a function of production rate
The total revenue and cost as a function of production rate are shown in Fig. 7 . The revenue has been calculated by multiplying the sales with the price of a pharmaceutical tablet. It can be observed that the operating cost first decreases and then increases. The cost incurred because of product rejection (e.g., due to quality failure) follows the trend of rejection rate shown in Fig. 7 . The inventory cost only occurs when the demand rate is less than the rate of production of accepted tablets. As shown in Fig. 7 , the revenue curve follows the profile of the tablets that are sold. First, the revenue increases as the tablet production rate increases, then it becomes constant because of demand limitations, and finally starts decreasing because the production rate of good tablets decreases as a result of an increasing rejection rate. At 100 % rejection, the revenue becomes zero because no acceptable tablets are produced. The profit strongly depends on sales. At the startup phase, the profit is negative because the total cost is more than the revenue. On increasing the production rate further, the profit first increases until the point where the production rate of acceptable tablets matches the demand rate and then starts to slightly decrease until the point where inventory starts to decrease. The minima point (at the top) of the profit curve is because of the nature of inventory curve. After that, the profit decreases sharply until the point of total rejection. At that point, the profit curve becomes slightly flat with small decrease because of zero sales. The profit is negative when the total cost exceeds the sales. Fig. 7 Revenue and cost as a function of tablet production rate
The cumulative revenue and cost is shown in Fig. 8 . The cumulative revenue has been calculated by integrating the revenue with respect to time. The production rate increases linearly from 0 to 120,000 tablets/h. As shown in the figure, in the startup phase, the revenue is zero due to 100 % rejection of tablets. The cumulative revenue increases with time and becomes constant at the point where the production rate reaches the equipment operating constraint. Similarly, the cumulative profit first decreases until the point where total revenue is less than the total expenses and then increases and passes through maxima. After this point the profit decreases, indicating that the total expenses are more than the total revenue. This result shows that the profitable reason is in between minima and maxima, and beyond this range, it is no longer profitable to operate the plant. The operation, rejection, and inventory cost are also shown in Fig. 8 . Fig. 8 Cumulative revenue and cost
Results and Discussions
In this section, the performance of moving horizon-based real-time optimization (MH-RTO) integrated with the hybrid MPC-PID control system is analyzed. The developed process model—a powerful virtual experimentation tool—is used to evaluate the performance of integrated system prior to implementation into the pilot plant.
Performance of Moving Horizon-Based RTO
The demand of the final product (tablets) has been varied from 30,000 to 80,000 tablets/h and from 80,000 to 30,000 tablets/h as shown in Fig. 9 . The assumed demand range is a reasonable number based on the specification of a commercial tablet press. For example, the production capacity of Libra2 08362L2JZ, Kikusui Rotary Tablet Press is 21,600–86,400 tablets/h (user manual, Kikusui Seisakusho ltd.). There are six optimization intervals. The moving horizon for MH-RTO is chosen to be four. The number of intervals is flexible and can be changed if needed. The inventory accumulated until the previous steps as well as the demand of the three future intervals have been considered in each moving optimization cycle. For each optimization cycle, the MH-RTO maximizes the profit and provides the production rate set point as shown in Fig. 9 . The obtained production rate set point is used as the input to the process. The actual tablet production rate is then achieved utilizing the implemented hybrid MPC-PID control scheme. The oscillation in the production rate can be seen in Fig. 9 during the startup phase. There are also oscillations at the points where step changes have been made. However, the process overall is stable and the production rate follows the set point obtained via the optimization. It should be noted that at very low and very high production rates, there are more rejections; therefore, in these regions, the production rate set point obtained through optimization is more than the demand. Due to equipment operational limitations, the desired range of CQAs was not achieved at very low and at very high production rates. At very low and at very high production rate, the steady-state operation is difficult to achieve. For example, if the production rate is too low, then the desired feed flow rates of API, excipient and lubricant, blend composition, and RSD will be difficult to achieve because of limitations associated with feeding and blending capacities of feeders and blender, respectively. Similarly, if the production rate is too high, then the feeding of tablet die will be fluctuating because of feed frame limitations and that will lead to fluctuation in tablet weight, hardness, and dissolution. The amount of tablets produced that satisfies the desired CQA range matches with the demand from 1000 to 4000 s and exceeds the demand from 4000 to 6000 s because the high demand of 80,000 tablets/h cannot be produced in the interval of 6000–7000 s. The inventory stored in 4000–6000 s range is then used in the interval of 6000–7000 s. Therefore, the moving horizon-based RTO can be efficiently used to manage the future demands and past inventory in order to satisfy the fluctuating market demands with maximum profit. Fig. 9 Production rate and demand under MH-RTO scheme. (Cumulative production = 1.3151 e + 008 tablets; cumulative good tablets = 1.2585 e + 008 tablets; cumulative demand = 1.22 e + 008 tablets; cumulative sales = 1.2106 e + 008 tablets; cumulative rejection = 4.3 % of product; cumulative sales = 92.05 % of cumulative product; cumulative inventory = 3.65 % of cumulative product)
The revenue and cost are shown in Fig. 10 . As shown in the figure, the revenue follows the trend of production rate and demand. Because of the moving horizon-based RTO and efficient management of inventory and demand, a sufficient return of revenue and profit is achieved from the 6000–7000 s interval, although in this interval the demand was quite higher than the production capacity. During the interval of 4000–6000 s, the profit is reduced due to inventory cost but the maximum overall profit has been achieved. The RTO maintains the inventory, operating, as well as rejection cost at the minimum possible value. In all cost, revenue, and profit plots, the cumulative value of 1000 s operation has been considered. Fig. 10 Revenue and cost under MH-RTO scheme. (Cumulative revenue = $6.7253 e + 006; cumulative profit = $4.4513 e + 006 (66.19 % of cumulative revenue); cumulative operating cost = $2.0757 e + 006 (30.86 % of cumulative revenue); cumulative rejection cost = $5.1947 e + 004 (0.77 % of cumulative revenue); cumulative inventory cost = $1.4635 e + 005 (2.18 % of cumulative revenue))
In another scenario, the process is run without any optimization where the production rate is set equal to demand. The two scenarios are compared in Fig. 11 . As shown in the figure, the feed rate is either equal or more under the moving horizon-based RTO scheme in each interval except in 6000–7000 s. In the interval of 6000–7000 s, the production rate under the moving horizon-based RTO scheme is lower than that of the scenario without optimization in order to maximize the profit. The difference of the feed rates in both scenarios in the intervals of 4000–6000 s is because the moving horizon-based RTO suggests producing inventory in order to manage the higher demand in the next time interval. The total powder flow rate at the blender outlet is controlled through the hybrid MPC-PID control scheme. The flow rate from the individual feeders is controlled through the built-in classical PID-based controller while the total flow rate at the blender outlet is controlled through the MPC via a cascade scheme. It can be seen in the figure that the flow rate is controlled at the set point very well, with a small oscillation during the startup and at the point where the step change in the set point has been made. As desired for good controller performance, the rise time is small and the decay ratio is quite high. A relatively large overshoot can be seen at startup of the manufacturing process. Some overshoot can be also seen at the points where the step changes in the production rates have been made. Overshoot can be reduced by further fine tuning of controller parameters, but there is a trade-off between overshoot and rice time. The results reported here is the best estimation obtained from controller tuners. Fig. 11 Comparison of feed flow rates in continuous tablet manufacturing process achieved under MH-RTO, RTO, and without optimization (production rate = demand) schemes
The return of revenue under the moving horizon-based RTO and the scenario without optimization (production rate set point = demand) are shown in Fig. 12 . As shown in the figure, the revenue under the moving horizon-based RTO scheme gives more return of revenue in comparison to that without optimization-based operational scheme. The maximum difference in revenue can be seen in the 6000–7000 s interval where the demand was higher than the production capacity. This is due to the advantage of the moving horizon-based RTO approach that can account for future demands and past inventories. The difference in revenue is also significant at very low production rates where the rejection rate is higher because of the equipment and control system limitations. Under the moving horizon-based RTO, 7.85 % more revenue is achieved. Fig. 12 Comparison of revenue earned under MH-RTO scheme and without optimization (production rate = demand). (Cumulative revenue under MH-DRTO = $3.3627 e + 7; cumulative revenue without optimization = 3.1178 e + 7; increase in revenue = 7.85 %)
The profit earned under the moving horizon-based RTO and without optimization is compared in Fig. 13 . As shown in the figure, the moving horizon-based RTO results in higher profit in all the optimization intervals except the interval of 4000–6000 s. In the interval 4000–6000 s, the profit is reduced because of the inventory cost. It should be noted that the inventory is needed in this interval to satisfy the higher demand in the next interval, which could not be produced because of equipment and control system limitations. The overall earned profit is 7.14 % higher under the moving horizon-based RTO scheme in comparison to that without optimization scenario. If the plant will be running only for the demand range of 50,000–80,000 tablet/h, then the profit margin will be relatively less because in this range the inventory cost will be relatively higher. The additional advantage of the moving horizon-based RTO is that it guarantees satisfying the future market demands irrespective of any market fluctuations within a feasible plant capacity while maintaining the maximum profit. Fig. 13 Comparison of profit earned under MH-RTO scheme and without optimization (production rate set point = demand). (Cumulative profit under MH-RTO = $2.2257 e + 7; cumulative profit without optimization = $2.0774 e + 7; increase in profit = 7.14 %)
The process runs under MH-RTO scheme for 12,000 s and the profiles of sales, rejection, and inventory are obtained. Then using the trapezoidal rule, the cumulative values of sales, rejection, and inventory are calculated from which the percentages are calculated. Similarly, the distribution of revenue has been calculated based on the cumulative values. The average distribution of the production rate and revenue for moving horizon-based RTO are shown in Fig. 14a, b , respectively. As shown in Fig. 14a , 4.3 % of the total tablet produced is rejected, 92.05 % of the total production is sold, and the remaining 3.65 % of the total production is stored as inventory. The distribution of the revenue earned is shown in Fig. 14b . As shown in the figure, 66.19 % of the profit margin is achieved; 30.86 % of total revenue is invested in terms of operating cost, 0.77 % for waste disposal, and 2.18 % for inventory management. Fig. 14 Distribution of production ( a ) and revenue ( b ) (based on cumulative value) under MH-RTO scheme
Comparison of MH-RTO with RTO
A realistic but arbitrary tablet demand rate has been assumed as shown in Fig. 15 . Intermediate, low, and high demands have been considered specifically to take into account all extreme scenarios. The rejection rate is less at intermediate production rate while it is higher at a low and high production rate. The continuous tablet manufacturing process integrated with hybrid MPC-PID control scheme has been run under three scenarios. In the first scenario, no optimization has been used and the production rate is set equal to the demand rate. In the second scenario, a RTO is integrated with the hybrid MPC-PID control scheme and the production rate is obtained from RTO. This approach is based on the optimization of an objective function in a current operational interval taking into account all the current expenses, inventory, and demand. Note that this method does not take into account the past inventory and future demands. In the third scenario, the proposed MH-RTO and hybrid MPC-PID are integrated with the process that incorporates past inventory and future demands during optimization. Fig. 15 Comparison of production rates achieved under MH-RTO, RTO, and without optimization (production rate = demand) schemes. (Cumulative demand = 1.32 e + 8 tablets; cumulative production without optimization = 1.1715 e + 8 (11.25 % less than cumulative demand); cumulative production with RTO = 1.2295 e + 8 (6.86 % less than cumulative demand); cumulative production with MH-RTO = 1.384 e + 11 (4.85 % more than cumulative demand))
The production rate for all these three scenarios is shown in Fig. 15 . As shown in the figure, the change in demand is not fulfilled without optimization. In this case, the production rate is significantly less than the demand. Overall, 11.25 % of less production rate has been observed during the operational period. Under the RTO scheme, the higher demand is not possible to achieve because this demand is higher than the production limit. However, the lower rate of demand is achieved successfully. Overall, 6.86 % of total product deficiency has been found in the operational period. In case of moving horizon-based RTO, the demand is satisfied throughout the period by efficient management of past inventory and future demands. The inventory is generated in the previous step to fulfill the higher rate of demand which is not possible to produce in the next interval. For example, in the interval of 1000–2000 s, the inventory is produced to satisfy the high demand in the 2000–3000 s intervals. The shift in the MH-RTO profile in the interval of 9000–10,000 s is because the demand in the next interval (10,000–11,000 s) is lower in comparison to the previous interval (8000–9000 s) and it can be produced in that interval. It means that, MH-RTO knows in advance that in the next step the demand will be less, and therefore, in the interval of 9000–10,000 s, no extra tablets needs to be produced. Therefore, production rate in the interval of 9000–10,000 s is smaller than the production rate of interval 7000–8000 s. Overall, an increase of 4.85 % of tablets from demand has been produced under MH-RTO scheme. It is a good practice to store some inventory to avoid product deficiency situation. Thus, it is found that the moving horizon-based RTO leads to the best operational scheme. In order to achieve the maximum benefits of using MH-RTO, there should be a good prediction of future market demands. In case if the future demands are not available accurately, even then the MH-RTO can provide more profit in comparison to RTO-only and optimization-free scheme by efficient management of inventory. For example, if the market demand for the next step is overpredicted, then the stored inventory after next step will be incorporated into consecutive steps.
The powder flow rate in cases of MH-RTO and RTO is shown in Fig. 16 . As shown in the figure, in both cases, the controller tracks the flow rate set point very well. There is an oscillation at startup and at the point where step change in the production rate set point has been made, but the oscillation duration is very small. The powder flow rate in case of MH-RTO is more in the intervals where inventory needs to be produced in order to satisfy the future demands. The powder flow rate in case of without optimization scheme follows a similar trend. Fig. 16 Powder flow rate achieved under MH-RTO and RTO schemes
The revenue earned under the without optimization scheme, with conventional RTO and with moving horizon-based RTO, is shown in Fig. 17 . As shown in the figure, the moving horizon-based RTO yields the maximum revenue followed by conventional RTO and without optimization schemes. At a high demand rate, the conventional RTO yields slightly less revenue in comparison to the without optimization scheme. The moving horizon-based RTO gives 11.6 % more revenue in comparison to without optimization scheme, while conventional RTO gives only 4.75 % more revenue which is a significant improvement in terms of revenue. Fig. 17 Comparison of revenues achieved under MH-RTO, RTO, and without optimization (production rate set point = demand) schemes. (Cumulative revenue without optimization = $6.4780 e + 006; cumulative revenue with RTO = 6.7860 e + 006 (4.75 % more); cumulative revenue with MH-RTO = 7.2297 e + 006 (11.6 % more))
The profit earned under all these three scenarios is shown in Fig. 18 . As shown in the figure, the moving horizon-based RTO gives the maximum profit followed by conventional RTO and without optimization scheme. The moving horizon-based RTO yields 12.67 % more profit in comparison to that without optimization scheme, while the conventional RTO gives only 8.43 % more profit. In case of MH-RTO, the profit in the intervals where the inventory has been stored is relatively less because of inventory and additional operating cost. For example, in the interval of 3000–4000 s, the profit earned under moving horizon-based RTO is less than the conventional RTO because in this interval the additional tablets have been produced to satisfy the high demand of the next interval. Therefore, in this interval, the inventory as well as the operating cost was higher. Fig. 18 Comparison of profit obtained under MH-RTO, RTO, and without optimization (production rate = demand) schemes. (Cumulative profit without optimization = $4.2226 e + 006; cumulative profit with RTO = 4.5785 e + 006 (8.43 % more); cumulative profit with MH-RTO = 4.7578 e + 006 (12.67 % more))
In summary, the comparison between the three production strategies is shown in Fig. 19 . As shown in the figure, the production rate without optimization, with conventional RTO and with moving horizon-based RTO, are 88.75, 93.14, and 104.85 % of the demand, respectively, meaning that only moving horizon-based RTO can fulfill the required product demand. The revenue in the case of conventional RTO and moving horizon-based RTO are 104.75 and 111.6 % of without optimization scheme, respectively, that indicates that the moving horizon-based RTO can help to increase revenue. The profit in the case of conventional RTO and moving horizon-based RTO are 108.43 and 112.67 % of the without optimization scheme, respectively. Therefore, the moving horizon-based RTO is the most profitable technique despite the slightly more expenses. More expenses are because of higher production rate and inventory cost. The comparison data are given in Table 6 . Fig. 19 Performance evaluation of MH-RTO (based on cumulative values) Table 6 Performance evaluation of moving horizon-based RTO Cases Production (% of demand) Revenue (% of base case) Profit (% of base case) Expenses (% of base case) Without optimization 88.75 100.00 100.00 100.00 RTO 93.14 104.75 108.43 98.024 MH-RTO 104.85 111.6 112.67 109.76
The distribution of total revenue in terms of profit and expenses is given in Fig. 20 . It has been calculated based on the operation of 11,000 s. As shown in Fig. 20a , in the case of the moving horizon-based RTO, 29.01 % of revenue is invested as an operating cost, 3.49 % of revenue is invested in inventory cost, and 0.69 % of revenue is used for disposal of waste products (rejection cost). As shown in Fig. 20b , in case of conventional RTO, higher percentage of revenue is invested for operation and waste disposal and less percentage of revenue is invested as an inventory cost, in comparison to moving horizon-based RTO. For the scenario of without optimization scheme, the percentage of revenue invested in terms of operating cost and waste disposal is higher in comparison to the RTO as well as moving horizon-based RTO schemes, but the inventory cost is least (see Fig. 20c ). Fig. 20 Distribution of total revenue in terms of profit and expenses (based on cumulative values; a MH-RTO, b RTO, c without optimization)
Conclusions
A new moving horizon-based real-time optimization (MH-RTO) scheme together with a hybrid control system has been proposed for the efficient management of inventory and demands and thereby the ability to maximize the profit and minimize the usage of resources. The MH-RTO has been integrated with a hybrid MPC-PID control system of continuous tablet manufacturing process. The control and optimization-relevant process model involving transfer function for direct compaction continuous tablet manufacturing process has also been developed. The performance of MH-RTO has been demonstrated through a continuous tablet manufacturing process that represents a realistic pilot plant facility of the same. The moving horizon-based RTO provides more profit in comparison to an optimization-free scheme. The performance of the MH-RTO has been also compared with a conventional RTO and found to be better in terms of earned revenue and profit. The moving horizon-based real-time optimization technique is generic and should thus have a wide range of applications in continuous chemical and pharmaceutical manufacturing processes. The purpose of this case study was to demonstrate the concept of MH-RTO optimization scheme, and some unexpected events that could happen during plant operation have not been considered. The future work includes the consideration of more plant operational scenarios such as unexpected delays and shutdown and implementation of the proposed integrated moving horizon-based RTO and hybrid MPC-PID control system to the pilot plant.
