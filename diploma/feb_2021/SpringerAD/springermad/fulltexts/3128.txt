Introduction
Ovarian cancer, which is the seventh most common cancer in women worldwide, remains to be the most lethal gynecologic malignancy due to the fact that the disease is generally asymptomatic in the early stages and there have been no reliable screening tests with high sensitivity and specificity, and standard tests for differential diagnosis of benign and malignant adnexal masses yet [ , , ]. In order to improve the accuracy of ovarian cancer prediction, various tests and models have been improved including; OVA1 (uses CA-125, beta 2-microglobulin, apolipoprotein A1, transthyretin and transferrin), the Risk of Malignancy Index (RMI—uses ultrasound findings, menopausal status and CA-125), the Risk of Ovarian Malignancy Algorithm (ROMA—uses CA-125, human epididymis protein-4 and menopausal status), ultrasound prediction model developed by International Tumor Analysis (IOTA) and recently Rajavithi-ovarian cancer predictive score (R-OPS) [ , , , , ]. However, despite all efforts in this field, there is no standard preoperative diagnostic test to currently recommend for identifying adnexal masses owing to controversial results of studies comparing the efficacy of the above markers and methods [ , , , , , ].
Among all studied markers, human epididymis protein-4 (HE4) which is a glycoprotein and was found to be associated with cancer cell adhesion, migration and tumor growth and overexpressed in epithelial ovarian cancer, has been proposed as an emerging marker for discrimination between benign and malignant masses and early detection of ovarian cancer [ , , , , ]. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of HE4 for ovarian cancer and differentiation value for discrimination between benign and malignant adnexal masses in premenopausal and postmenopausal patients.
Materials and Methods
Study Design and Population
Between November 2014 and March 2015, 85 patients who attended to Ondokuz Mayis University gynecology polyclinic and were diagnosed with pelvic mass by vaginal examination and ultrasonographic imaging and scheduled for surgical intervention were included in this prospective study. Institutional Ethics Committee approved the study, and informed consent from all subjects was obtained. Patients with pregnancy, chronic liver disease, renal failure, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, previous unilateral or bilateral oophorectomy and/or ovarian cancer surgery and pelvic surgery in the last 6 months prior to the study were excluded. Postmenopausal status was defined as 1 year past the last menstrual period for the study group.
All participants underwent surgery for diagnosed pelvic masses. Frozen section procedure was performed for all removed tissues and evaluated by pathology, and the patients with diagnosed borderline or malignant masses were completely staged. Clinicopathologic evaluation of masses including grade, histopathologic type/subtype and stage was done according to the Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) standards.
Sample Processing and HE4 and CA-125 Immunoassays
All fasting venous blood samples of 5 cc to two separate tubes for HE4 and CA-125 were obtained and collected in vacutainer biochemistry tubes without any anticoagulant prior to surgery. Serum samples were centrifuged at 5000 g for 5 min and stored at −41 °C until assayed. HE4 was measured using ELISA assay (Sunred, China), according to manufacturer’s instructions. CA-125 was measured by chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) (Elecsys CA-125 II kit, Cobas E170, Roche, USA), according to manufacturer’s instructions. The analytical evaluations met the quality control criteria of the laboratories. Cutoff values were 35 U/mL for CA-125 and 150 pmol/L for HE4.
ROMA Algorithm
The ROMA was calculated using the following equations as suggested by Jacobs and Moore, respectively [ ]: $$\begin{aligned} {\text{Premenopausal predictive index}}\,\left( {{\text{PI}}} \right) & = - 12.0 + 2.38*\ln \left( {{\text{HE4}}} \right) + 0.0626*\ln \left( {{\text{CA-}}125} \right){\text{ }}\left( {{\text{PI}}} \right) \\ & = - {\text{Postmenopausal predictive index }}\left( {{\text{PI}}} \right) = 8.09 + 1.04*\ln \left( {{\text{HE4}}} \right) \\ & \quad + 0.732*\ln \left( {{\text{CA-}}125} \right)\,{\text{Predicted proabability }}\left( {{\text{ROMA}}\% } \right) \\ & = \exp \left( {{\text{PI}}} \right)/\left[ {1 + \exp \left( {{\text{PI}}} \right)} \right]*100 \\ \end{aligned}$$
According to the ROMA index, an index ≥7.4 % and ≥25.3 % indicates a high risk for the presence of epithelial ovarian cancer in premenopausal and postmenopausal women, respectively.
Statistical Analysis
Data analysis was performed by using SPSS for Windows, version 11.5 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Whether the distributions of continuous variables were normally or not was determined by Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Data were shown as mean ± SD, median (min–max), or case number and % where applicable. The differences between the groups’ ages were compared by Student’s t test, while Mann–Whitney U test was applied for comparisons of the median values of HE4, CA-125 and ROMA. Nominal data were analyzed by Pearson’s Chi-square. The diagnostic performance of HE4, CA-125 and ROMA was evaluated by using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves and calculating sensitivity, specificity and area under curve (AUC). Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were also calculated at the best cutoff points. A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
The study group included 85 patients, the mean age for benign cases was 44.0 ± 14.5 and for malignant cases was 54.3 ± 11.4. Forty-seven of patients were premenopausal (39 were diagnosed with benign diseases and eight with malignant diseases), 38 of the study group were postmenopausal women (23 were diagnosed with benign diseases and 15 were diagnosed with malignant diseases). In the study group, 23 women had malignant diseases (17 serous ovarian cancer and six non-serous types) and 62 had benign diseases (20 were serous cystadenoma, 10 endometrioma, 10 myoma and 22 other types). Among malignant diseases, 16 were advanced cases (stage 3–4) and seven were early stage diseases.
The distribution of all serum markers including CA-125, ROMA and HE4 was studied for premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Median CA-125 level was found to be significantly higher in malignant premenopausal patients when compared to that in benign group, whereas there were no significant differences in median ROMA and HE4 levels, respectively ( p < 0.001, p = 0.813, p = 0.923). However, in postmenopausal patients, CA-125 and ROMA median levels were significantly higher in patients with ovarian cancer when compared to those in the benign group, while there was no statistically significant difference in HE4 levels in both groups, respectively ( p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p = 0.359).
When all serum markers in discriminating premenopausal patients with malignancies from those with benign diseases were evaluated, CA-125 was significantly increased in the malignant group, whereas there were no differences in the levels of ROMA and HE4 in both premenopausal groups according to the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis (Table 1 ; Fig. 1 ). When CA-125 was assessed in order to find the best cutoff value in differentiation of the benign and malignant premenopausal groups, malignant cases were found to increase over the value of 95.5 with 100 % sensitivity and 92.3 % specificity (Table 1 ).

When studied serum markers in discriminating postmenopausal patients with malignancies from those with benign diseases were evaluated, CA-125 and ROMA levels were found to be significantly higher in the malign group, whereas there was no difference in the level of HE4 in both postmenopausal groups according to ROC analysis (Table 2 ; Fig. 2 ). When CA-125 was assessed in order to find the best cutoff value in differentiation of the benign and malign postmenopausal groups, malign cases were found to increase over the value of 58.15 with 100 % sensitivity and 82.6 % specificity; best cutoff value for ROMA in differentiation malignant cases from benign ones was 28.91 with 100 % sensitivity and 73.9 % specificity (Table 2 ).

Discussion
In the last few decades, several tumor markers have been studied in order to discriminate malignant pelvic masses, particularly ovarian cancer, from benign ones, as a result of which CA-125 has been found to have significantly increased levels in malignant cases [ , ]. However, due to reduced sensitivity and specificity of CA-125, researchers have moved onto novel markers and algorithms with higher specificity such as HE4 and ROMA.
Diagnostic performance of HE4, both alone and in combination with other markers, in distinguishing malignant pelvic masses from benign masses has been evaluated in many investigations. In one of the studies, HE4 alone was found to be less elevated in women with benign adnexal masses when compared to CA-125 [ ]. In addition, some researchers pointed the effect of detecting method for HE4 and suggested that HE4 had higher accuracy than CA-125 when detected by chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) in differential diagnosis of malignant adnexal masses [ ]. In contrast, we did not find significant difference in premenopausal and postmenopausal patients although we used CLIA for detecting HE4 levels (Tables 1 , 2 ). Furthermore, it has been suggested that tissue CA125 and HE4 gene expression levels have better efficacy in discriminating benign from malignant pelvic masses in one of the recent studies [ ]. However, HE4 was most commonly assessed in combination with other markers. For instance, ROMA, which uses CA-125, HE4 and menopausal status, has been widely studied and proposed to be better detection marker for malignant ovarian masses when compared to CA-125 and HE4 individually [ , , , ]. Moreover, HE4 combined with CA-125 was reported as a new marker for evaluation of endometrial cancer [ ]. In the line with these studies, ROMA and CA-125 had better diagnostic performance in discrimination of malignant masses which included both serous and non-serous ovarian cancers from benign ones in postmenopausal women; however, ROMA was not found statistically significant in premenopausal women (Tables 1 , 2 ). Despite small number of cases in the present study, we think that these markers—ROMA and CA-125—may have the same diagnostic values in differentiation of benign masses from malignant ones in pre–post menopausal women in larger populations.
Apart from the above combinations, HE4 has been evaluated in a multi-marker model including progesterone and estradiol (E2) for distinguishing benign from malignant pelvic masses in postmenopausal women, and the model of HE4, CA125 and E2 was suggested as an effective potential differentiation method when compared to single parameter HE4 or CA125 and ROMA [ ]. In the present study, E2 was not studied in combination with HE4, so that we have no comment on the potential effectiveness.
Besides the diagnostic performance of HE4 for malignant ovarian masses, HE4 has been proposed to be a good indicator for clinical response to treatment in terms of particularly chemotherapy strategies, and recurrence follow-up as HE4 level was shown to elevate 5–8 months earlier than CA125 level increase [ , , ]. Additionally, researchers studied not only the role of HE4 in differential diagnosis of malignant masses from benign diseases but also they investigated its efficacy in ovarian cancer types, as a result of which it has been mentioned that HE4 would be an effective marker to distinguish type II epithelial ovarian cancer from borderline tumors and benign masses [ ]. In our study, owing to our small number of malignant cases we could not evaluate these effects of HE4.
Recently, new methods have been proposed in order to improve the detection of malignant pelvic masses and diagnose and treat ovarian cancer in early stages. One of them has been suggested as Rajavithi-ovarian cancer predictive score (R-OPS) which is based on menopausal status, ultrasound findings, serum CA125 and HE4 [ ]. It has been indicated that R-OPS scoring system shows good discrimination between benign lesions and ovarian cancer. A similar algorithm including menopausal status, CA125, HE4 and ultrasound findings has been suggested to have better sensitivity than ROMA but less specificity while both this algorithm and ROMA have better performance than CA125 alone [ ]. ROMA was found to be effective marker in differential diagnosis of malignant cases in postmenopausal women with CA125, while CA125 had better performance than both ROMA and HE4 in premenopausal patients in our study.
The present study has several limitations. Firstly, the study population including pre–post menopausal women was too small and premenopausal group was larger than postmenopausal one; however, the proportion of malignant cases in postmenopausal group was higher than that in premenopausal group, so we could comment on the tests which were found to be valuable in discriminating malignant cases from benign ones in postmenopausal women. Secondly, great part of malignant cases were diagnosed as stage 3–4 diseases, so we had to compare the test results of benign cases with advanced stage malignant cases, and therefore we could not comment on the comparison of levels of markers between benign and early stage malignant diseases. However, it has long been known that prediction and early diagnosis of ovarian cancer remains to be the major problem as previously mentioned.
In conclusion, combination of markers seems to have more efficient in discrimination of malignant pelvic masses from benign ones than traditionally used markers alone. Adding imaging findings and menopausal status are suggested to improve the diagnostic performance. HE4, which is included in all of these combinations and scoring systems, may play important role in differential diagnosis of malignant pelvic masses from non-malignant ones.
