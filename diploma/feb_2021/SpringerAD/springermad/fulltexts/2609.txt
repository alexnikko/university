Introduction
Nowadays, the use of antibiotics for eliminating pathogenic bacteria is common in animal and human communities. On the other hand, it is specified that use of these particles brings resistance to animals and human body against pathogenic microorganism. Therefore, researchers are finding some substitutions to use in replacement with antibiotics for eliminating harmful microorganisms or alteration of beneficial microbial populations without any oppositional effect or resistibility. Among all of the substitutions that identified so far, essential oils are extensively approved by scientists. These oily, volatile essences achieved from plants by several methods like distillation (direct distillation, water steam distillation, water and steam distillation), solvent extraction (solvent extraction, maceration with solvent, boiling with water, extraction with cold fat, extraction with hot fat), cold compression which is the usual method for the natural oil industry and non-conventional extraction techniques include superficial fluid extraction, turbo extraction, extraction by electrical energy, and ultrasonically assisted extraction (Vinatoru ; Lahlou ).
Mentha pulegium (pennyroyal) is a species of medical herbs from Lamiaceae family that has grown in Europe, Asia, and North Africa. (R)-(+)-pulegone is the main constituent of Mentha pulegium essential oil (MPE) that ranges up to 80–90% of this plant. MPE is sometimes used in human food additives and also is a traditional medicine for abortifacient (Baser and Buchbauer ). MPE’s beneficial effects have been evaluated in a lot of studies and the following advantages have been reported: acaricidal, hepato toxicity, anti-hepatic, antibacterial, antioxidant, anti-myometrium, anti-spasmodic, anti-genotoxic, relaxant, and insecticidal activity (Rim and Jee ; Gordon et al. ; Bakerink et al. ; Sadeghi et al. ; Gulluce et al. ; Falowo et al. ; Cherrat et al. ; Soares et al. ; de Sousa et al. ; Alpsoy et al. ; Soares et al. ; Zekri et al. ). These properties refer to the essential oil and its constituents that may be variable in different environmental conditions. However, a review study assessed the nature of essential oils and stated that essential oils and their components have hydrophobic properties which let them enter in the lipids of the bacterial cell membrane and mitochondria thus, destroyed the inner structures and increased permeability. Therefore, ions and other cell contents link with each other and finally, extensive loss of cell contents or the exit of critical molecules and ions will lead to death (Burt ).
Antioxidants are artificial or natural substances that reduce damages caused by oxygen, such as that causes by free radicals. All living organisms sustain a reducing environment inside their cells, and contain complex systems of antioxidants to inhibit chemical damage to the cell components by oxidation. In current years, there has been a plenty of attention toward the field of natural antioxidants. Plant phenols are major natural antioxidants that divided into four general groups: phenolic acids (gallic, protochatechuic, caffeic, and rosmarinic acids), phenolic diterpenes (carnosoland carnosic acid), flavonoids (quercetin and catechin), and volatile oils (eugenol, carvacrol, thymol, and menthol) (Shan et al. ). Because of their benefits as inhibiting cancer cells in human (Huang et al. ), active food packaging (Sanches-Silva et al. ), feed additives for swine and poultry (Windisch et al. ), and against lipid–protein oxidative deterioration in meat and meat products (Falowo et al. ), Identifying a herbal antioxidant to use instead of synthetic one is a new field of study that researchers are following in the last years.
Therefore, the objectives of this study were (1) to identify an organic agent in replacement with antibiotics for eliminating pathogenic bacteria. (2) Analyzing Mentha pulegium essential oil as an herbal agent along with assessing antibacterial and antioxidant properties of it. (3) Comparing some dosages of consumption for removing harmful microorganism and scavenging free radicals.
Material and methods
Preparing of Mentha pulegium essential oil
At present study, we used hydro-distillated type of Mentha pulegium essential oil. We prepared this pure essential oil from Barij essence pharmaceutical company in Iran. The essential oil protected in a closed dark glass bottle at 4 °C temperature until its use.
GC–MS analyze of essential oil
A sample of essential oil was diluted in methanol and exposed to gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC–MS) (Varian BV, model CP3800). The following states were used: capillary column: DB-5 (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm); gun: 240 °C; detector: 230 °C; electron impact: 70 eV; carrier gas: He; flow rate: 1.0 mL/min; split: 1/20; temperature program: 60–240 °C, 3 °C/min; injection volume: 1 μL. The ingredients were identified by comparison of their mass spectra with the database of the GC–MS system (Nist 62 lib.) and Kovats retention index (Adams ).
Antioxidant assay
The DPPH assay provided an easy and fast way to determine the antioxidant activity of most of the substances. In this technique, transferring electrons produces a violet solution in methanol (Huang et al. ). For this experiment, we used DPPH (2, 2-diphenyl-picryl-hydrazyl) as free radical to test antioxidant activity of MPE. It is a black to green crystalline powder, violet in solution, formula: C 18 H 12 N 5 O 6 , molar mass: 394.32 g/mol, and density: 1.4 g/cm 3 . This powder is composed of stable free-radical molecules, which has revitalized by the elements or hydrogen electron donor (antioxidant compounds) and turns to yellow phenyl pykryl hydrazyl. Practical DPPH in this test provided from Sigma-Aldrich Company and the potency of MPE to give hydrogen atoms or electrons measured by light absorbance of DPPH in methanol solution.
Essential oil concentrations
Different concentrations of essential oil in DPPH solution prepared by adding 1700 mL oils to 10 mL methanol and prepared serial dilutions of the w / v in methanol. Then, 0.004% DPPH solution was prepared by adding 0.006 g DPPH in 150 mL methanol. Continuously, we added 50 μL of essential oil serial dilutions to 2.5 mL DPPH solution to get final concentrations of essential oil (2.94, 1.47, 0.735, 0.367, 0.183, 0.09, 0.045, 0.022 μL). Finally, test tubes placed in the dark, lab temperature for 30 min and light absorbance was read by spectrophotometer at 517 nm.
Positive control (BHT) as an artificial antioxidant
Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) or 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenolis is the most commonly used artificial antioxidant. This antioxidant is generally known as a safe substance for sustaining foods containing fats and using in other industries like pharmacy, petroleum, rubber, and oil (Yehye et al. ). We obtained BHT of Sigma-Aldrich Company for comparing its antioxidant activity with MPE.
Three concentrations of 10, 20, and 30 μg/mL BHT were used for positive control test. For preparing these concentrations, at first 0.03 g BHT powder was dissolved in 1000 mL of methanol. Then, 10 μL of the above solution added to 9990 mL methanol to get 30 μg/ mL BHT. Subsequently, the concentrations of 10 and 20 μg/mL were prepared by diluting 30 μg/ mL BHT. Similar to essential oil, 50 μL of each BHT concentration was mixed with 2.5 mL of DPPH solution, placed in the dark place for 30 min and finally light absorbance was read against blank at 517 nm.
Equation for getting antioxidant capacity: $$ \mathrm{I}\%=\mathrm{A}\ \mathrm{blank}-\mathrm{A}\ \mathrm{Sample}/\mathrm{A}\ \mathrm{blank}\times 100 $$ where I%, is the percentage of inhibition, A blank is DPPH with methanol absorbance at 517 nm and A sample is the absorbance of test compound in 517 nm.
The IC50 value is defined as the concentration of the antioxidant required for the 50% inhibition of the DPPH activity. Here, the IC50 value was determined through graph plotting, by considering the percentage of remaining DPPH against EO concentrations and all the tests were carried out in triplicate.
Microorganisms and antibacterial experiments
The microorganisms used for microbial tests, including Gram negative bacteria Escherichia coli ( Ecoli ATCC 25922), Salmonella typhimurium ( Salmonella typhimurium ATCC 14028), and Gram positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus ( Stsphylococcus aureus PTCC 1337) and Bacillus cereus ( Bacillus cereus PTCC 1015). Pathogenic bacteria transferred from − 20 °C to MHB medium (Mueller Hinton Broth) and were renewed after 24 h of incubation at 37 °C. The inoculums density was set to 0.5 McFarland of each bacterium.
Disk diffusion method
Agar disk-diffusion technique is a routine method used in many clinical microbiology laboratories for determining antimicrobial susceptibility. For this test, the required equipment was disinfected by autoclave (test tubes, flasks containing medium built and blank disk). Then, the MHA medium was poured into the sterile plates and we put them in the refrigerator. The plates containing the medium, oil, and type of bacteria was named by essence concentrations (oil concentrations was 5, 10, 50, and 100 μL) and antibiotic plates as control contained ceftriaxone and tetracycline. The 0.5 McFarland suspension of each bacterium incubated on culture media by swab (bacteria covered the entire medium). Then, sterile blank disks were placed on medium and 5 and 10 μL oil was put on them. Moreover, for 50 and 100 concentrations, we made wells in the agar and poured oil in wells. Finally, after drying of the oil wells and the blank disks, we put the plates in 37 °C incubator for 18 h and bacteria inhibition zone diameter was measured with a ruler in millimeter. This experiment was repeated three times for each strain and the mean values of the diameter inhibition zone were recorded as the final result (Jorgensen and Turnidge ).
Designation of minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration
In this experiment, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is the lowest concentration of MPE or antibiotics that will inhibit the visible growth of microorganisms after nocturnal incubation and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) is the lowest concentration of MPE or antibiotics that will prevent the growth of an organism after sub-culturing on to a medium with no antibiotic.
For this experiment, at first, oil was diluted in 300 μL DMSO and 1200 μL MHB (1728 mg of oil in 1500 μL based on the w / v ) in sterile glass tubes. After that, 100 μL of the above sample was mixed with 100 μL sterile MHB in 96-well plates (two-fold) and then 100 μL of 0.5 McFarland bacterial suspension was added to them. The final concentration of essential oil for the first dilution was desired 288 mg/mL that diluted for 11 times. Each antibiotics, tetracycline and ceftriaxone were dissolved in 50 mL of distilled water and were added to wells which contained 100 μL MHB (in this case, the first concentration of antibiotics was 64 μg per milliliter). Finally, plates were read by ELISA and after 24 h incubating at 37 °C, plates were read again. Eventually, MBC data was evaluated by streaking method (Balouiri et al. ).
Results
The chemical composition of MPE was evaluated by GC/MS instrument, in which the relative retention times and the mass spectra of oil components comprised with data library as shown in Table 1 . According to these data, 29 constituents identified by GC/MS which organized 99.6% of total essential oil so that cis-pulegone oxide (45.676%), (E)-p-mentha-2-en-1-ol (12.157%), and 3,3′-dimenthol (18.859%) were the main components of the oil. In our study, we have investigated the free radical scavenging activity of MPE in vitro by DPPH method and compared it with an artificial antioxidant, BHT. Table 2 shows IC50 values for MPE and BHT. The free radical scavenging activity of essential oil was 1.027 mg/mL while IC50 of BHT was 20.280 μg/ mL. In addition, the free radical scavenging increased by increasing essential oil concentration as seen in Fig. 1 . The antimicrobial activities of MPE against two Gram positive and two Gram negative bacteria summarized in Tables 3 , 4 and 5 by disk diffusion, MIC, and MBC methods. The data of disk diffusion indicated that by presence of essential oil, the diameter of inhibition zone increased so that this inhibition was clearer in gram positive bacteria ( S. aureus and B. cereus ). Also, in higher concentrations of essential oil (44 and 88 mg/well) the diameter of inhibition zone increased apparently in all microorganisms. Data of MIC and MBC confirmed the results of disk diffusion method. The lowest concentration of MPE required to kill salmonella was more than 288 mg/mL for bacillus, 18 mg/mL for staphylococcus, and 72 mg/mL for E. coli .

Discussion
Studies on plants active compounds have shown that the MPE compounds are characterized mainly by flavonoid, terpenoid, and phenolic mixtures confirming the analysis of Kamkar et al. about MPE components by having pulegone (40.5%), menthone (35.4%), and piperitone (5.2%) (Kamkar et al. ). Some other studies also evaluated the composition of MPE so that the results of them are so variable (Mahboubi and Haghi ; Teixeira et al. ; Cherrat et al. ; Lawrence ; Kumar et al. ; Hajlaoui et al. ). However, in the majority of them, different isomers of pulegone and menthone are the main components of MPE which confirm accuracy of our GC/MS analysis. Anyway, these differences are common because of the plant growing environment conditions and the season of sample collecting (Boukhebti et al. ).
Several studies evaluated antioxidant properties of Mentha pulegium in the form of essential oil, water extract, and ethanol extract that in all of them MPE was greatly active as an antioxidant substance; however the different extracts of Mentha pulegium were stronger in this case and revealed more antioxidant activity rather than essential oil (Kamkar et al. ; Teixeira et al. ; Cherrat et al. ). Moreover, in our research MPE could show an acceptable antioxidant property which was comparable with BHT antioxidant strength.
Our results of disk diffusion have been confirmed in several literatures in which they stated Gram positive bacteria were more sensitive to essential oils than Gram negative bacteria (Cosentino et al. ; Karaman et al. ; Sahin et al. ). Nevertheless, in another study that conducted on Mentha longifolia ssp. longifolia (a species in the genus Mentha), researchers explained that essential oil of Mentha longifolia ssp. longifolia did not have selective antimicrobial function on the basis of the cell well diversity of bacterial microorganisms, because of its components (Gulluce et al. ). In comparing with antibiotics, at least 10 μL MPE could compete with tetracycline, cephtriaxone, and chloramphenicol to remove B. cereus . However, antibiotics were stronger than MPE to eliminate Gram negative bacteria in disk diffusion method. In comparing with antibiotics, the dosage of MPE for killing the bacteria was more than the dosage of antibiotics to do this purpose. However, MPE could compete with antibiotics to remove the pathogens. Therefore, MPE in high concentration has great potential for antibacterial activities against selected bacteria and could be used instead of antibiotics for removing pathogenic microorganisms. Several literatures evaluated antimicrobial characteristics of Mentha pulegium essential oil against a lot of microorganisms (Cherrat et al. ; Mahboubi and Haghi ; Teixeira et al. ; Ait-Ouazzou et al. ; Sadeghi et al. ; Miraj and Kiani ). In all of these studies, MPE showed the antibacterial properties that are in accordance with our results. In contrast, in another study Brahmi et al. ( ) tested MPE against six bacterial strains and stated that The MPE exhibited weak inhibitory effects toward most tested bacteria. However, these differences are due to plant origins and the season of harvesting that causes different compositions in the essential oil.
Conclusion
In this paper, antioxidant and antibacterial effects and phytochemicals of Mentha pulegium essential oil were evaluated in vitro. Results showed consistent evidence that Mentha pulegium essential oil is an important repository of biologically active compounds with antiradical activity and antibacterial capacity so that it might be used in a prophylactic way or in a combined pharmaceutical and antibiotic therapy against pathogenic bacteria.
