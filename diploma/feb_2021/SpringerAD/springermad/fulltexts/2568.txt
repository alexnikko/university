Introduction
Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is conceptually defined as the co-occurrence of at least three out of the following metabolic disturbances: central/visceral obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia and hypertension (Alberti et al. ). While precise mechanisms underlying the development of its clustered comorbidities are not completely understood, MetS has rapidly reached epidemic proportions worldwide in a straight relationship with the access to sugar-rich foods and beverages, as well as less physical activity (Bray et al. ). Additionally, accumulating data have suggested that metabolic (re)programming processes subsequent to early-life insults, i.e. during pregnancy, infancy or childhood, may lead to long-term development of chronic non-communicable diseases, such as MetS, cancer, mental illness, among others (Chan et al. ; Gluckman et al. ; Inadera ). This hypothesis for the developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) was first proposed in the 1990’s by Dr. David Barker, and attracted increasing attention of scientists, medical doctors, epidemiologists and policymakers around the world (Cooper ).
Human consumption of sugar in industrialized countries has exponentially arisen for over 200 years, whereas concerns about its deleterious effects have just come up during the last 4 decades (Bray ; Bray et al. ; Yudkin ; Yudkin ). Sucrose is the main collaborator to total sugar intake worldwide, reaching rates as high as 25 % of total energy intake in many countries (Bray ; Gibson et al. ). Upon the action of intestinal sucrase, sucrose is efficiently hydrolyzed into its two monosaccharide constituents, glucose and fructose, which are absorbed under very similar rates (Tappy et al. ). However, once inside the bloodstream their fate diametrically differs. Glucose elicits insulin release toward its own uptake by insulin-sensitive tissues, whereas fructose undergoes nearly complete hepatic uptake where it is converted into trioses and further used for the de novo synthesis of triglycerides (Rippe and Angelopoulos ). Consequently, rats fed a high-sucrose diet, and thus fructose, develop hypertriglyceridemia (Kanazawa et al. ) and increased fat accumulation, even after short-term dietary intervention (Toida et al. ). On the other hand, high-glucose diet did not cause the same alterations both in rats (Kanarek and Orthen-Gambill ) and humans (Cohen and Schall ), emphasizing the pivotal role played by fructose on sucrose deleterious effects.
Blood-brain barrier and synaptic tree are still under development during infancy and beginning of childhood, letting brain susceptible to environmental insults (Christoffel et al. ). Early onset of MetS comorbidities may affect important brain areas, compelling them to undergo adaptive responses that usually involve endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-based mechanisms (Cnop et al. ; Ozcan and Tabas ). Under ER stress, protein synthesis is overactivated to support increased metabolic demand, but may also lead to impaired protein folding, a triggering event of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Depending on the insult’s intensity and duration, UPR sensors – inositol-requiring enzyme 1 alpha (IRE1α), protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK) and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) – activate distinct signaling pathways toward pro-adaptive or pro-apoptotic cellular fate. Pro-adaptive pathways selectively inhibit de novo protein synthesis; upregulate the transcription of genes encoding ER chaperones, as well as antioxidants to maintain redox homeostasis; and activate ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) pathway. On the contrary, pro-apoptotic pathways mainly include the upregulation of the transcription factor C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP) and its downstream signaling pathway (Hetz ; Santos et al. ). In fact, ER stress pathways have been increasingly associated with the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases (Hetz Mollereau ; Roussel et al. ), specially as a mid- to late-term outcome of metabolic disturbances (van der Harg et al. ).
In addition to hypothalamus, recent studies have proposed a role for hippocampus as a neuroendocrine interconnector between metabolic cues and cognitive functions (Calvo-Ochoa and Arias ; Davidson et al. ; Kanoski and Davidson ; Mainardi et al. ), a relationship further supported by the description that insulin is produced and secreted by mature neurons of the dentate gyrus (Kuwabara et al. ). Even short-term dietary interventions have been shown to alter rat hippocampus structure and function (Calvo-Ochoa et al. ). However, it is not known whether those alterations arise from local or peripheral metabolic signals that disturb hippocampus homeostasis. Thus, in the present study, we hypothesized that early and sustained exposure of weaned rats to high-sucrose diet (HSD) promotes MetS-related metabolic disturbances, which ultimately might anticipate neurological injuries. Data herein presented reinforce this hypothesis and further support that those alterations are associated with precocious triggering of hippocampal ER stress.
Material and methods
Animals, diets and experimental design
At weaning (postnatal day 21), male Wistar Hannover rats provided by animal facility house of Federal University of Maranhão were randomized into two groups: control group (CTR, n = 9), fed a standard chow (Nuvital®, Nuvilab, Brazil), whose macronutrient composition was 55.4 % total carbohydrate (10 % sucrose), 21 % proteins, 5.2 % total lipids, totaling 352 Kcal/100 g; and high-sucrose diet group (HSD, n = 7), fed a high sucrose chow manufactured with powdered standard chow (40 %), condensed milk (40 %), refined sugar (8.5 %) and filtered water qsp for a final macronutrient composition of 65 % total carbohydrates (25 % sucrose), 12.3 % proteins, 4.3 % total lipids, totaling 348 Kcal/100 g (de Lima et al. ). Animals were maintained in a controlled room (temperature 22 ± 3 °C, humidity, 60 %) with airflow conditions, artificial dark-light cycle (lights on from 7∶00 a.m. to 7∶00 p.m.) and free access to water and chow for 9 weeks, until the postnatal day 90.
During dietary intervention period, animals’ body weight and their food intake were measured twice a week for feed efficiency calculation. Monthly, the Lee index (body weight (g) 1/3 ∙ naso-anal length (cm) −1 × 1000) was determined for obesity development assessment (Bernardis and Patterson ). Behavioral and cognitive tests were performed during the last week before euthanasia. Additionally, animals were subjected to intraperitoneal glucose and insulin tolerance tests. At postnatal day 90, overnight fasted animals were anesthetized (10 mg/kg xylazine, 40 mg/kg ketamine) for blood and tissue collection upon laparotomy and decapitated to craniotomy and hippocampus dissection. Blood samples were processed to serum or plasma separation. Serum triglyceride levels were spectrophotometrically measured using laboratorial kits according to manufacturer’s instructions (LABTEST®, Brazil). Liver, pancreas, gastrocnemius and soleus skeletal muscles, interscapular brown adipose tissue; and periepididymal, retroperitoneal and mesenteric white adipose tissue fat pads were weighed for morphometric assessment. Morphometric data were expressed as tissue mass (g) per 100 g body weight. The dissected hippocampus was rapidly stored in RNAlater® solution (Ambion, USA) for qPCR procedures. All protocols were approved by the Committee for Ethics and Welfare on Animal Use – CEUA of the Federal University of Maranhão under ruling N° 23,115.009595/2014–81.
Assessment of glucose-insulin axis function
For intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test ( ip GTT), animals were submitted to 8-h fasting prior to administration of 2 g/kg glucose. Tail vein blood drops were collected immediately before (time 0) and 15, 30, 60 and 120 min after glucose load for blood glucose measurement through glucometer (Accu-check Active®, Roche Diagnostic, Germany). Data were expressed as mean area under curve (AUC). Similar procedure was carried out for intraperitoneal insulin tolerance test ( ip ITT), excepting animals were fed and received 1 IU/kg insulin (Humulin 70/30®, Lilly, USA). Glucose disappearance rate ( K ITT ) was derived from ip ITT data and calculated as 0.693/t 1/2 . Hepatic insulin sensitivity was predicted by means of TyG index calculation [ln (fasting glucose × fasting triglyceride)/2] (Guerrero-Romero et al. ).
Assessment of ex vivo lipolytic activity
Samples of periepididymal fat pad (~100 mg) from both groups were fragmented and incubated in Krebs buffer (120 mM NaCl, 15 mM NaHCO 3 , 4.83 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgSO 4 , 1.21466 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 2.4 mM CaCl 2 , 1 % BSA and 0.1 % glucose after pH adjustment to 7.4) under pumping aeration (37 °C) in the presence or absence of 20 μM isoproterenol (Sigma Aldrich, USA). After 1 h incubation the samples were cooled to stop the reactions and glycerol concentration was determined by enzymatic colorimetric assay (540 nm) using triglyceride commercial kit according to manufacturer’s instructions (Labtest®, Brazil) (Vaughan ).
Assessment of gene expression by real time PCR (qPCR)
Hippocampus samples were used for RNA extraction using Trizol® (Invitrogen, Germany) as manufacturer’s instructions. RNA pellet was diluted in 50μl nuclease-free water and quantity and purity determined by measurement of A260/A280 ratios with a NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, USA), followed by agarose gel electrophoresis (0.8%). RNA samples were stored at −80 °C. RNA samples (3 μg) were converted into cDNA using Super Script II Reverse Transcriptase® (Invitrogen, Germany). Primers were designed using Primer Express® software (Applied Biosystem, USA) and manufactured by Invitrogen Brazil (Table 1 ). The qPCR amplification and Platinum® SYBR® Green qPCR SuperMix-UDG (Invitrogen, Germany) detection were performed using the 7500 Real-time PCR Applied Biosystems®, USA. Reactions were incubated at 50 °C for 2 min and 95°C for 2 min (holding stage) followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s (denaturation) and 60 °C for 1 min (annealing and extension). To melt curve stage, reactions were incubated at 95 °C for 15s, 60 °C for 60 min and 95 °C for 15 s. All samples were normalized to the relative levels of GAPDH and results are expressed as the fold change (FC) values of 2 -ΔΔCT , as determined by real-time amplification.

Assessment of behavioral and cognitive outcomes
Neuromotor activity and exploratory behavior were assessed by rotarod and open field tests, respectively, as previously described (Hall and Ballachey ; Srodulski et al. ). Briefly, two days prior to rotarod test animals were allowed to accommodate standing on rod and probed at rotating speed of 12 rpm for 5 min. Each animal was tested 3 times a day over 5 consecutive days. At day 5, animals were fasted for 2 h before experimental performance, when latency to fall was recorded in seconds (s). To assess anxiety and exploratory behavior, the animals were individually placed at the center of a glass-wall circular arena (140 cm 2 ), divided in 9 quadrants, for 5 min. Total number of quadrant crossing, frequency of entrances in the central quadrant and stereotyped behaviors were recorded for data analysis. To assess spatial learning-memory and cognitive functions, animals were subjected to water maze test (Morris ). The apparatus consisted of a circular pool (120 cm diameter, 50 cm deep), filled with water (22 ± 2.0 °C) to a depth of 30 cm and divided into four quadrants. A platform (15 cm wide and 35 cm high) was placed 1.5 cm below water surface in the center of the pre-set quadrant. During training period, animals were individually released into the water from one of the four quadrants, facing maze wall, and allowed to swim for 60 s to find the hidden platform. Rats that failed to locate the platform were gently guided to the platform and allowed to stay on it for 30 s. Animals were trained four times a day for 3 consecutive days. Latency time to find the hidden platform was recorded for spatial learning assessment. On 4th day, the platform was removed and the animals released in the center of the pool to swim for 120 s. The time spent in the quadrant where platform was expected to be was recorded for memory retention assessment.
Statistical analysis
Data was expressed as mean ± SEM and compared by means of unpaired t test (one-tailed) for a significant difference of 5% ( p < 0.05).
Results
Early exposure to HSD increased adipose tissue accumulation
Early exposure to HSD did not alter weight gain and feed efficiency between groups, whereas slightly decreased food intake in 90-days old HSD-fed rats, as compared to age-matched CTR (Fig. 1 a-c). Nevertheless, HSD rats had higher body mass than CTR as assessed by Lee Index calculation (308.1 ± 1.8 vs 298.6 ± 1.4 g 1/3 ·cm −1 , p = 0.0004, Fig. 1 d), reaching values that classify them as overweight (Stephens ). Moreover, HSD rats showed increased white and brown adipose tissue accumulation, but no change was found on liver, pancreas and skeletal muscle relative masses (Table 2 ). To further characterize the effects of HSD on adiposity, we measured basal and isoproterenol-induced ex vivo lipolysis in visceral periepididymal fat pads from both groups. As showed in Fig. 2 , basal unstimulated lipolysis had no difference between groups. However, lipolytic response to sympathetic stimulus was significantly decreased in HSD rats, as compared to CTR (7.4 ± 0.56 vs 9.55 ± 0.89 μg/mg/h, p = 0.0002).

Early exposure to HSD impaired glucose and triglyceride homeostasis
In order to investigate the effects of early HSD exposure on insulin-glucose axis, animals from both groups were subjected to ip GTT and ip ITT. HSD rats showed higher baseline glucose levels in both states as compared to CTR (Fasted: 102.7 ± 1.38 vs 94.67 ± 1.43 mg/dl, p = 0.0007; Fed: 128.3 ± 2.2 vs 106.7 ± 3.49 mg/dl, p = 0.0001, Fig. 3 a-b). After glucose bolus administration, both groups reached maximum glucose levels within 15 min, returning to baseline levels in 2 h (Fig. 3 c). Calculation of ip GTT AUC showed that HSD rats had impaired glucose tolerance (625.3 ± 57.02) as compared to CTR (493.6 ± 33.55, p = 0.0283, Fig. 3 d). On the other hand, peripheral insulin sensitivity was preserved in HSD group, as depicted from K ITT calculation (Fig. 3 f). Surprisingly, HSD animals presented a rebound increase of glucose levels, which might be due to enhanced hepatic sensitivity to glucagon (Fig. 3 e). Taking into account that assembly and secretion of triglyceride-rich VLDL particle is associated with hepatic insulin resistance, we measured fasting triglyceride levels in both groups. Serum triglyceride levels in HSD was ~60% higher than CTR (145.3 ± 14.24 vs 88.89 ± 5.79 mg/dl, p = 0.0007, Fig. 3 g). Finally, fasting glucose and triglyceride levels were used to calculate TyG Index as a surrogate measure of hepatic insulin resistance (Du et al. ; Simental-Mendia et al. ). Result in Fig. 3 h is suggestive of higher insulin resistance in HSD group, in spite of unchanged K ITT showed in Fig. 3 f. In this context, our data support the hypothesis that early exposure to HSD leads to a precocious metabolic syndrome phenotype mainly characterized by visceral fat accumulation, dysglycemia, glucose intolerance and hypertriglyceridemia through mechanisms that might involve the impairment of insulin-dependent actions.

Early exposure to HSD activated hippocampal ER stress pathways
We next investigated whether the precocious development of the metabolic syndrome phenotype herein described would disturb hippocampal ER homeostasis, a central signaling pathway for cellular stress sensing. Data in Fig. 4 show that HSD-fed rats demonstrated elevated mRNA levels for two out of the three ER stress transducers, PERK (3.31 ± 0.64 FC; p = 0.0039) and ATF6 (2.3 ± 0.47 FC; p = 0.0229), whereas no significant change was found for IRE1α. Consistent with this, expression of ER chaperone genes was increased for PDIA2 (4.46 ± 0.44 FC; p = 0.0001), decreased for GRP78 (0.19 ± 0.29 FC; p = 0.0367) and unchanged for Calnexin. Despite the strong increase in PERK mRNA levels, Nrf2 gene expression did not change. Assessment of apoptosis-related genes expression showed Caspase 3 and CHOP mRNA levels were elevated (2.66 ± 0.49 FC, p = 0.027 and 2.04 ± 0.27 FC, p = 0.0262; respectively). In accordance, Bcl2 mRNA levels, an anti-apoptosis gene, showed a non-significant downward trend. In total, six of the ten ER stress-related genes tested demonstrated significant differential expression in the hippocampus of our 90-days old HSD-fed rats. Fig. 4 Expression of genes related to ER stress: Relative mRNA expression of UPR sensors (IRE1α, PERK and ATF6), chaperones (GRP78, PDIA2 and CALNEXIN - CALN), antioxidant defense (AOD) (Nrf2) and apoptosis markers (Bcl2, CASPASE 3 – CASP3 and CHOP) in the hippocampus of rats fed a standard chow (CTR, n = 9) or high-sucrose diet (HSD, n = 7) for nine weeks from weaning (postnatal day 21). All samples were normalized to the relative levels of GAPDH and results are expressed as the fold change values of 2 -ΔΔCT , as determined by real-time amplification.

Early exposure to HSD impaired neuromuscular function but did not alter learning-memory ability
Assessment of behavioral and cognitive functions in CTR and HSD-fed rats showed significant impairment caused by early and sustained exposure to high dietary sucrose. Data in Fig. 5 a show that HSD group performance on rotarod was significantly worse than CTR (120.00 ± 29.82 vs 214.80 ± 36.88 s, respectively; p = 0.0369), denoting important impairment of neuromuscular function. On the other hand, no spatial learning-memory impairment was found during water maze test (Fig. 5 b and c). Nevertheless, HSD rats demonstrated higher anxiety, inferred from the increased number of total crosses during open field test performance (Fig. 5 d), whereas other parameters were not affected (Fig. 5 e and f).

Discussion
The present study provides several levels of evidence that early and sustained exposure to HSD leads to a metabolic syndrome phenotype with subsequent impairment of hippocampal ER homeostasis. Firstly, 90-days old rats fed a HSD since weaning accumulated more visceral and non-visceral adipose tissue than age-matched CTR rats, despite no statistical difference in body weight. Secondly, HSD rats presented higher blood glucose levels, at both fasted and fed states and hypertriglyceridemia. These metabolic disturbances are thought to underlie the disruption of hippocampal ER homeostasis detected in HSD rats, which might concur for the neuromotor impairment and anxiogenic behavior also demonstrated by HSD animals. Together, these results suggest that early high sucrose intake promotes precocious damage to important brain areas that may lead to behavioral and cognitive, beyond metabolic, disorders at adulthood.
According to our data, an early 9-week sucrose-rich but isocaloric dietary intervention, from weaning to the young age of 90-days old, increased fat accumulation on both visceral and non-visceral depots. Surprisingly, animals’ whole body weight did not statistically differ between groups, though HSD rats had higher Lee Index as well as lower food intake than CTR. These data are corroborated by previous studies which showed that rats fed an isocaloric high sugar diet for 2- (Kanazawa et al. ), 4-, 12- (Toida et al. ) or 18-weeks (Pawlak et al. ) had increased visceral fat accumulation, despite having similar mean body weight. Furthermore, assessment of ex vivo cathecolamine-evoked glycerol release from periepididymal fat pad showed that our HSD rats had impaired response, besides keeping unchanged basal lipolysis. In fact, elevated fat mass in high-fructose fed rats has been attributed, at least in part, to decreased isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis (Rizkalla et al. ), which might be related to increased catecholamine-resistance on adipocyte β 2 -adrenoceptor that leads to increased stimulation of antilipolytic α 2 -adrenoceptors (Jocken and Blaak ). On the other hand, our HSD rats also showed hypertrofic brown adipose tissue, a sensitive site for hypothalamus-driven sympathetic activity. Brown adipose tissue mass has been shown to be modulated by low-grade hypothalamic inflammation secondary to white adipose tissue accumulation (Arruda et al. ; Velloso and Schwartz ), which might compromise other functions of hypothalamus. It has been demonstrated that rats submitted to 8-week feeding with HSD also had brown adipose tissue hypertrophy, which was ascribed to β 3 -adrenoceptor upregulation due to reduced sympathetic activation or receptor desensitization (de Queiroz et al. ). Actually, the impairment of sympathetic nervous system has been defended by MONA LISA hypothesis, which states that most obesities – thus, obesity models – known are low in sympathetic activity (Bray ; Bray and York ).
In this study, HSD rats presented higher blood glucose levels in both fed and fasted states, clearly demonstrating an impaired glucose handling that was further corroborated by results from ip GTT. However, no difference was found in blood glucose clearance capacity assessed by means of ip ITT, suggesting preserved insulin sensitivity. On the other hand, HSD rats showed a marked increase of serum triglyceride levels, which was associated with elevated fasting glycemia to rather suggest an increased hepatic insulin resistance, as assessed by TyG index calculation. In addition to its fructose-derived effects on lipid metabolism, sucrose has also the potential to influence glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity through the insulinemic response to glucose (Gibson et al. ). However, when rats fed either 32% glucose, fructose or sucrose solutions for 50 days were submitted to GTT, only fructose- and sucrose-treated ones showed impaired glucose tolerance (Kanarek and Orthen-Gambill ). Furthermore, it was shown that sucrose fed rats had increased triglyceride content in the liver and VLDL particles within six weeks, while it took about three months to significantly accumulate in skeletal muscle; demonstrating that hepatic, but not muscular, insulin resistance is an early event in sucrose-based dietary interventions (Thresher et al. ). Noteworthy, these authors have further suggested that fructose is the primary mediator of sucrose-induced adverse metabolic effects (Bizeau and Pagliassotti ). Although we have not measured circulating insulin levels in our rats, this set of data, especially by increased fasting glucose and triglyceride levels, allow us to speculate that our HSD rats had increased insulin levels secondary to hepatic insulin resistance and possible pancreatic lipotoxicity depicted from the elevated plasma lipid peroxidation (data not shown). Absence of muscle insulin resistance is supported by no differences in ip ITT, skeletal muscle masses and muscle triglyceride content (data not shown) between HSD and CTR groups.
Consistent set of data has demonstrated the outcomes of diet-induced metabolic disturbances on functional impairment of important brain areas, particularly hypothalamus, through mechanisms involving low-grade inflammation (Velloso and Schwartz ), as well as oxidative and ER stresses (Cnop et al. ; Tappy et al. ). Increasing evidence has proposed a role for the hippocampus on metabolic control, besides its well-known role on learning and memory functions (Davidson et al. ). Indeed, Western diet intake may cause hippocampal dysfunction with subsequent cognitive impairment (Kanoski and Davidson ). Concerning our data, increased brown adipose tissue mass in our HSD rats may be related to low-grade hypothalamic inflammation, as previously shown (Arruda et al. ), which might extent to interconnected brain areas, such as hippocampus (Cenquizca and Swanson ). Thus, given the causative relationship between metabolic disturbances, low-grade inflammation and ER stress (Arruda et al. ; Cnop et al. ; Velloso and Schwartz ); we next investigated potential early disruption of hippocampal ER homeostasis in our HSD-fed young rats.
Hippocampal gene expression of UPR sensors PERK and ATF6 were increased in our HSD rats, indicating an activated ER response to augmented protein traffic, though no change was seen in IRE1α gene expression. Under stressing conditions, such as increased unfolded/misfolded protein traffic, GRP78 dissociates from IRE1α, PERK and ATF6 to support correct protein folding; allowing UPR sensors to autophosphorilate and activate their modulatory effects on gene expression. Early UPR aims to decrease general protein translation but maintains the expression of genes related to chaperone and antioxidant functions as an attempt to further support its own pathways (Hetz ). These findings strengthen our data since PDIA2 was overexpressed, suggesting a supportive role against protein over load. However, GRP78 expression was decreased in HSD group, an unexpected finding if one takes into consideration its role on UPR pro-adaptive pathways. Upon persistent ER stress, cells undergo pro-apoptotic rather than pro-adaptive pathways, which result in higher expression of apoptosis-related genes such as CHOP and Caspase-3 (Hetz ). Noteworthy, our HSD rats showed increased expression of these two genes, which account for a deep impairment of ER homeostasis even at such young age. In a recent report, hippocampal CHOP expression was shown to promote a time-dependent inhibition of GRP78 expression in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice (Zhao et al. ), which might explain the reduced GRP78 expression herein described. Furthermore, prolonged ER stress may turn off IRE1α pathway, whereas sustaining PERK signaling (Lin et al. ). In fact, UPR transition from pro-adaptive to pro-apoptotic phase demands attenuation of IRE1α signaling, while sustained PERK signaling favours upregulation of pro-apoptotic genes (Hetz ). Alternatively, CHOP overexpression would also be maintained by late ATF6 activation (Santos et al. ). Despite the pathway responsible for CHOP overexpression, it might be further involved in the Caspase-3 overexpression, as well as marginally decreased Bcl2 expression herein exhibited. Notwithstanding, a pro-apoptotic phenotype is also suggested by the failure of PERK to increase Nrf2 expression. As a whole, these alterations are thought to limit neuroplasticity and impair behavioral and cognitive functions in our HSD-fed rats.
HSD feeding did not affect spatial learning-memory, but limited the ability to stay on rod, an effect possibly related to the anxiogenic behavior demonstrated by our HSD rats in the open field test. In a recent study Zhang et al. ( ) showed that C57BL/6 mice fed a high-fat diet for 4 weeks demonstrated a worse performance on rod, an effect positively correlated with body weight. Contrariwise, our groups had no body weight difference, further supporting the occurrence of early neuromotor control impairment. However, it might also be due to injury of specific hippocampus areas, such as anterior and ventral cingulate areas, which have been shown to be involved in memory for motor response as well as attention and emotional processing (Cenquizca and Swanson ). In humans, hippocampus has been shown to mediate motor sequence learning during training, accounting for sequencial gain in performance (Albouy et al. ). Damage of such areas is probably involved in the impairment of motor skills of HSD rats on rotarod. Furthermore, ventral hippocampus plays a role in unconditioned anxiety and conditioned fear, which is consistent with hippocampal connections to amygdala and hypothalamus, important members of brain’s anxiety and fear machinery (Zhang et al. ), besides to brain-stem sites mediating motor responses (Bast et al. ). Early studies have already shown that hippocampal lesions increase animal’s ambulation in the open field test (Gray and McNaughton ). Similar injuries are probably responsible for the slightly greater anxiety demonstrated by our HSD rats in the same test. On the other hand, CA1 field seems to be somehow spared from HSD deleterious effects, at least at such young age, since no memory deficit was found in our HSD rats. This finding is corroborated by one demonstration that 12-week feeding of BALB/c mice with HSD did not alter their performance on water maze (Pyndt Jorgensen et al. ). Whether longer dietary interventional periods would lead to deeper impairments of the hippocampus-driven functions remains to be addressed in future studies.
In summary, this study reinforces the knowledge on the consequences of early introduction of high dietary levels of sucrose, thus fructose and glucose, on metabolic control of body functions. Moreover, it originally shows that the hippocampus homeostasis is particularly disrupted with very precocious development of ER stress, as well as neuromotor and behavioral impairments; expanding the branches of MetS-related disturbances. Whereas additional studies on progressive or late neurobehavioral impacts of HSD are still needed, this study also reaffirm the pertinence of DOHaD concept, which should strongly be taken into consideration by parents, pediatricians, public health professionals and policymakers for proper advising on the transition from breastfeeding to ready-to-eat foods.
