Introduction
CD28, one of the best defined co-stimulatory molecules, plays multiple roles in the activation, proliferation, and survival of T cells. In patients with chronic inflammation (e.g., autoimmunity, atherosclerosis), CD4 + CD28 neg. T cells with increased effector functions are expanded [ , , ]. On the other hand, CD8 + CD28 neg. T cells accumulate along with normal aging and also reflect the viral infectious burden such as human cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) [ , , ].
Depending on the setting, CD8 + CD28 neg. T cells can exhibit enhanced effector functions or, on the contrary, represent T cell exhaustion with loss of cytotoxic function. Both active and suppressive antitumor immune responses are reported for CD28 neg. T cell populations [ , , , ]. Moreover, numerous studies have shown the elevated numbers of CD8 + CD28 neg. T cells in the tumor microenvironment and in the peripheral blood of patients with solid and hematologic malignancies [ , , , , , , , ]. However, it is not yet understood whether these T cells recognize tumor antigens. Here, we report a case of relapsed melanoma where T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire spectratyping and sequencing detected a public TCR to Melan-A in oligoclonal CD28 neg. T cell population after a long-term complete remission (CR).
Case report
The patient was first diagnosed with malignant melanoma on his left auricle in 1999 at the age of 37 years. The histological diagnosis was malignant melanoma pStage IB, T2aN0M0 according to the International Union against Cancer TNM classification. The patient underwent tumor excision with—as it turned out later —no surgical margin. In 2008, he was diagnosed with recurrent malignant melanoma on the reverse side of his original lesion on the left auricle. Immunohistochemistry study revealed that the tumor cells were positive for Melan-A. The tumor area was resected three times until a surgical margin was achieved. Thereafter, he has been followed up without further recurrence. Besides surgical resection, he denied any other additional treatment for melanoma and has no other previous malignant medical history.
Materials and methods
Patient and specimens
The patient provided written informed consent to collect blood samples for investigational purposes based on a biospecimen utilization protocol. All experiments were approved by the institutional review board and independent ethics committee of Children’s Hospital University Tuebingen. The patient’s HLA types are A1, A24; B7, B27; and DR 13, DR 13.
Isolation of CD28+ and CD28neg.T cells
PMNCs were isolated by Ficoll Isopaque density gradient centrifugation (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). CD4 + CD28 + , CD4 + CD28 neg. , CD8 + CD28 + , and CD8 + CD28 neg. T cells were sorted with FACSAriaII (BD Biosciences). Purities of CD28 + and CD28 neg. T cells were 97.9 and 99.7%, respectively.
RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis
For transcript quantification, RNA was extracted with the use of RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and reverse transcription was carried out using Superscript III First Strand Synthesis Super Mix (Life Technology, Germany) as described.
TCR Vα- and Vβ-repertoire spectratyping and sequencing
Each TCR Vα (TRAV) and Vβ (TRBV) segment was amplified with one of the Vα and Vβ familiy- specific primers and a Cα and Cβ primers, respectively. The sequences of primers and spectratyping analysis were performed as reported previously [ ]. The amplified PCR products were size fractionated by capillary gel electrophoresis with the use of an ABI model 3130 Genetic Analyzer, and data were analyzed with the use of GeneMapper software v4.0 (Applied Biosystems). T cells were sequenced using BigDye® Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Life Technology, Germany) and with the use of an ABI model 3130 Genetic Analyzer. The IMGT Junction Analysis tool was used to delineate the genes and N-diversity resulting in the V-(D)-J junction.
Flow cyometric analysis
For surface staining, PerCP-CD3, Vioblue-CD4, APC-H7-CD8α, PE-CF594-CCR7, PE-Cy7-CD45RA, FITC-CD57, and BUV737-CD28 were used. For intracellular cytokine staining, intracellular fixation/permeabilization kit (eBioscience) with APC-Foxp3 (eBioscience) were used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Patient samples were measured and analyzed with the use of an LSR Fortessa or FACS CantoII with FACS Diva software (BD Biosciences).
Results
CD4+CD28neg. T cells were rarely detected, in contrast to a marked expansion of CD8+CD28neg. T cells. The majority of CD8+CD28neg. T cells were CD57+Foxp3− memory cells
Overall, 16.0% of TCRαβ + CD3 + lymphocytes did not express CD28. While most of CD28 neg. cells were CD8 + , CD4 + CD28 neg. T cells were rare. A numerical discrepancy between the CD4 and CD8 compartment was also observed in their relative proportion of CD28 neg. cells. The frequency of CD28 neg. T cells was 1.13% among CD4 + and 45.8% in CD8 + lymphocytes, respectively (Fig. 1 a). These distributions are concordant with the previous report [ ]. Fig. 1 a Frequencies of CD28 neg. T cells among (i) CD3 + T cells, (ii) CD4 + T cells and (iii) CD8 + T cells were analyzed by means of flow cytometry. b (i) Frequencies of CD57 + cells and Foxp3 + cells among CD8 + CD28 neg. T cells, (ii) Immune phenotypes of CD8 + CD28 neg. T cells based on CD45RA and CCR7 expression were analyzed by means of flow cytometry
To investigate whether CD8 + CD28 neg. T cells hold an active or suppressive character, we investigated their expression of CD57, a cytotoxic marker, and Foxp3, master transcriptional factor of immune suppressive cells. As a result, while over 80% of CD8 + CD28 neg. T cells expressed CD57, only 0.01% of CD8 + CD28 neg. T cells were positive for Foxp3 (Fig. 1 b (i)). To confirm that CD8 + CD28 neg. T cells belong to the memory T cell fraction, we examined their expression of CCR7 and CD45RA. Based on these data, over 90% of CD8 + CD28 neg. T cells were phenotypically memory cells (63.9% were effector memory cells, 21.6% were 45RA + effector memory (TEMRA) cells, and 5.26% were central memory cells) to locate the remaining less than 10% in naïve phenotype (Fig. 1 b (ii)). By contrast, about 70% of CD4 + CD28 neg. T cells were phenotypically memory cells (12.5% were effector memory cells, 0.726% were TEMRA cells, and 57.0% were central memory cells) and about 30% were naïve cells, compatibly with a previous report [ ] (Fig. 1 b (iii)).
CD28neg. T cells feature a reduced diversity of TCRs
Regarding CD28 + fraction, 32 of 34 tested TRAV segments both in CD4 + and CD8 + lymphocytes, and 23 in CD4 + lymphocytes and 22 in CD8 + lymphocytes out of 26 analyzed TRBV segments, respectively, showed normal polyclonal distribution patterns. The complexity score—measured by the number of detectable peaks in spectratype analysis—was higher in rearranged β (167 in CD4, and 169 in CD8) than in α locus-derived transcripts (102 in CD4, and 108 in CD8), as reported [ ] (Fig. 2 ). Fig. 2 Spectratype of TCR Vα and Vβ-chains of a CD4 + CD28 + T cells, b CD8 + CD28 + T cells were analyzed. CDR3 length (40 amino acids) in the x -axis versus fluorescence intensity in the y -axis is shown
In contrast, in CD28 neg. cells, the vast majority of TRAV and TRBV segments spectratype pattern were skewed. Three TRAV and one TRBV segment in CD4 + and 11 TRAV and 6 TRBV segments in CD8 + lymphocytes were detected as single peaks, which is suggestive for a monoclonal origin (Fig. 3 ). Additionally, in the CD8 + CD28 neg. cells the complexity score was higher in the β locus (35) than in the α locus (25). In CD4 + CD28 neg. cells α and β loci were comparable regarding complexity (8 in both loci). This indicates that in CD28 neg. T cells, the TRAV segments repertoire is more restricted than that of the TRBV segments in terms of CDR3 length. In addition, higher numbers of TRAV and TRBV segments were expressed by CD8 + compared to CD4 + T cells, which is in accordance with a higher share of CD8 + T cells among CD28 neg. T cells. Fig. 3 Spectratype of TCR Vα and Vβ-chains of a CD4 + CD28 neg. T cells, b CD8 + CD28 neg. T cells were analyzed. CDR3 length (40 amino acids) in the x -axis versus fluorescence intensity in the y -axis is shown
Several public TCRs, which include a TCR to Melan-A, were identified among CD28neg. T cells
The individual CDR3 region of TRAV and TRBV segments with single speaks in spectratype were sequenced for more accurate analysis. Nine TRAV and three TRBV sequences of CD8 + CD28 neg. T cells as well as one TRAV sequence of CD4 + CD28 neg. T cells were successfully determined by the direct sequencing strategy (Tables 1 , 2 , and 3 ). Regarding the other single peaks detected by spectratyping, a re-amplification of the PCR products with Jβ-specific primers discriminated different sequences with the same CDR3 length in the single peaks. RT-products of TRBV12-3/TRBJ1 in CD4 + CD28 neg. T cells were subjected to PCR for TRBJ1-1, 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, 1-5, and 1-6 expression. The bands of TRBJ1-5 and TRBJ1-6 were detected both at about 300 bp (Fig. 4 a). Likewise, RT-products of TRBV12-3/TRBJ2 in CD4 + CD28 neg. T cells were subjected to PCR for TRBJ2-1, 2-2, 2-3, 2-4, 2-5, 2-6, and 2-7 expression. Weakly recognizable bands of TRBJ2-1 and TRBJ2-5 located both at approximately 300 bp (Fig. 4b ). These results showed that these T cells were not of monoclonal origin but length-restricted pauciclonal expansions.

The combination of TRAV12-1/J9 found in CD8 + CD28 neg. lymphocytes is described in context with a melanoma peptide-specific TCR (Melan-A2) [ ]. The combination of TRAV14DV4/J49 is a public motif as it is described in association with Tax11-19, the human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-associated peptide [ ]. The combination of TRAV21/J38 stands for a public motif for a peptide of the EBV [ ]. The combination of TRAV27/J42 is a public motif linked with influenza virus peptide [ ]. The combination of TRBV19/TRBJ2-2 represents a public motif for hepatitis C peptide [ ]. TRAV5 and TRAV13-1 do not have any inserted N-nucleotides, meaning they are germline-encoded TCRs.
Identical CDR3 sequences of the CD28neg. compartment were present in the CD28+ population except for TRAV21 in the CD4+CD28neg. compartment
In order to evaluate whether the T cell clones found in the CD28 neg. compartment are also present in the CD28 + compartment, CDR3 regions of CD28 + fraction were examined with nine TRAV sequence-specific primers (eight TRAV segments in the CD8 + CD28 neg. compartment and one in the CD4 + CD28 neg. compartment). As a result, except for TRAV21 in the CD4 + CD28 neg. compartment, all sequences including a Melan-A2-specific public TCR were detected in the CD28 + compartment as well (Fig. 5 ). Fig. 5 CDR3 regions of CD28 + fraction were examined with 9 primers specific for TRAV sequences identified in CD28 neg. T cells
Discussion
In the present study, to determine whether CD28 neg. T cells include public TCRs towards tumor antigens, we examined TCR repertoire spectratyping and sequencing of CD28 neg. T cells in a patient with long-term disease-free status after recurrence of melanoma. As a result, a public TCR against Melan-A was detected in oligoclonal CD8 + CD28 − T cells in this patient, indicating that CD28 neg. T cells also accumulate immunity directed towards tumor-associated self-antigens.
CD8 + CD28 − T cells are mainly reported as being senescent and associated with immune defects in the elderly individuals directly by having suppressor activity or indirectly by reducing the overall spectrum of antigenic specificities [ ]. Persistent viruses and tumor antigens are the prominent causal agents of T cell replicative senescence in vivo. Patients with melanoma often have increased proportions of senescent CD8 + CD28 − T cells, and this is associated with poor clinical outcomes [ ]. Previous studies have also implicated CD8 + Foxp3 + cells with a close relationship to CD8 + CD28 − cells, controlling both autologous and allogeneic immune responses [ , , ]. On the other hand, CD8 + CD28 − T cells were shown to express perforin, granzymes and have high cytotoxic potential [ ]. Even though this is still a controversial issue, cytotoxicity marker CD57 is a marker to discriminate cytotoxic from suppressive CD8 + CD28 neg. T cells [ ]. In this case, most of CD28 neg. T cells expressed CD57 but not Foxp3. Combined with the clinical course of this patient who has been free of the disease for 8 years, it is highly likely that CD8 + CD28 neg. T cells with the Melan-A-specific TCR are contributing to antitumor immunity rather than representing senescence.
It is worth noting that the public TCR against Melan-A was distinguished in TRAV in this patient, because crystallographic analyses revealed that TCR-alpha has more contacts with peptide than TCR-beta, suggesting that TCR-alpha is dominant in antigen recognition followed by formation of the TCR repertoire specific for Melan-A [ ]. Interestingly, Melan-A-specific T cells are also found at relatively high frequency in HLA-A2 + normal controls [ , , , ]. These T cells are phenotypically categorized into naïve T cells, which are CD28 neg. and preferentially use a limited set of TRAV and TRBV genes, primarily Vα 2.1 and Vβ 14. Vα2.1 usage, however, was shown to be independent from functional avidity of antigen recognition and despite preferential binding of Vα2.1 + T cells to Melan-A-tetramers their functional outcomes rather result from the sum of interactions between MHC-peptide complex and TCR [ ]. In our study, the patient is negative for HLA-A2 and Melan-A-specific T cells identified in the CD28 neg. fraction of the patient used Vα12-1/Jα 9. In addition, more than 90% of the CD8 + CD28 neg. subpopulation were phenotypically memory cells. Taken together, CD28 neg. T cells with a public TCR against Melan-A in this patient were most likely developed in association with his melanoma.
Public TCRs are identical TCRs or CDR3 regions which can be found in different individuals. They originate either from rearrangements involving identical V, D J, C segments or from recombination events rearranging different DNA segments, yet due to the degeneration of the genetic code both generating a sequence encoding for the same CDR3 epitope binding region. These conserved T cell reptiles have been described in immune responses to CMV, EBV, HIV, Hepatitis B and C, cancer, autoimmune diseases, and alloreactivity [ ]. Intriguingly, considerable frequencies of public TCRs were identified among CD28 neg. T cells in this study. Strikingly, these TCRs respond not only to viral pathogens as reported [ , ] but also tumor-associated antigens. Although the mechanism is unknown, a T cell leukemia antigen, which the patient never suffered from, was also targeted by one of the CD28 neg. TCRs. In this patient, we found that CD8 + CD28 neg. T cell included germline-encoded TCRs. These TCRs are reported for enhanced affinity towards self-antigens [ ]; however, a pathological relevance of these germline-encoded TCRs to the tumor associated self-antigen (Melan-A) remains to be determined.
Importantly it was recently demonstrated that oligoclonal CD28 neg. T cells do not contain unique TRBV sequences that are not present in the residual naïve and early memory T cell compartments [ , , ]. However, the analysis of TRAV segments was not yet reported. In this case, all analyzable TRAV sequences of CD8 + CD28 neg. T cell were also identified in the CD28 + compartment, but one sequence in CD4 + CD28 neg. T cells was not detected in the CD28 + compartment. This certifies that the CD8 + CD28 neg. compartment consists of clonally expanded T cells that have emerged from the CD28 + compartment, but that CD4 + CD28 neg. T cells also include naïve T cells that have not yet encountered their cognate antigens or a memory T cell entity solely present in the CD28 neg. compartment. Yet a universal conclusion on the basis of a single-sample analysis cannot be drawn. Therefore, further analysis of TRAV in CD28 + and CD28 neg. T cells is required.
In conclusion, we demonstrated that oligoclonally expanded CD8 + CD28 neg. T cells included a public TCR towards tumor-associated self-antigen in a patient with melanoma who has achieved long-term disease-free status. To our knowledge, this is the first report to show a public TCR to a tumor-associated self-antigen in CD8 + CD28 neg. T cells. Further efforts are warranted to elucidate the mechanism by which CD28 neg. T cells expand after the exposure to their antigens.
