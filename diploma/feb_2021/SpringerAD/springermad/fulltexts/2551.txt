Introduction
Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder in which the effects of insulin resistance impact on multiple organs in the body, including the eyes, kidneys and the cardiovascular and central nervous systems (Strachan et al. ; Zhang et al. ). The worldwide prevalence of the disease has been increasing exponentially in the last few years, with the most recent estimates reporting that 382 million adults had diabetes in 2013 (Guariguata et al. ). One of the most feared complications of people with diabetes is the progressive visual impairment which is in general attributed to diabetic retinopathy and consequent vision loss (Coyne et al. ; Luckie et al. ). Severe visual impairment occurs 2 to 3 times more frequently in people with diabetes compared to the general population (Hayward et al. ).
Early in the disease, there is little association between the degree of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy and visual performance (Yau et al. ). The relationship between retinopathy and visual impairment only becomes apparent in later stages of the disease such as in proliferative diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema and vision threatening diabetic retinopathy (Moss et al. ; Miki et al. ; Yau et al. ). On the other hand, metabolic biomarkers have not been found to predict visual performance in the early stages of type 2 diabetes (Hove et al. ). Despite this, evidence has emerged that color contrast detection impairment may happen early in the disease (Bearse et al. ; Reis et al. ).
There is increasing evidence of mild cognitive impairment early in type 2 diabetes (Kalmijn et al. ) that could be related to an altered cortical neurochemistry. For instance, it had been shown that type 2 diabetes patients have a higher γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) concentration in the occipital lobe compared to non-diabetics (van Bussel et al. ). Additionally, type 2 diabetes patients with higher HbA1C levels and lower cognitive functioning had a higher occipital GABA concentration as well (van Bussel et al. ).
Several studies reported a correlation between GABA in the occipital cortex with altered visual function and/or inhibition in other diseases such as schizophrenia (Yoon et al. ), neurofibromatosis type 1 (Violante et al. ; Ribeiro et al. ), major depressive disorder (Norton et al. ) and in healthy subjects (Edden et al. ). The association between occipital GABA and visual performance is still to be explored in type 2 diabetes.
The current study aimed to investigate visual impairment through visual psychophysical testing in a longitudinal setting to identify possible predictors of visual psychophysical performance and their reliability over one-year period, with a particular focus on occipital GABA. Our hypothesis is that changes in GABA, secondary to metabolic derangement in diabetes, might also impact visual function in relation to putatively affected physiological mechanisms related to cortical processing of visual psychophysical tasks.
Experimental procedures
The collected data are part of an observational and prospective study over one year of a cohort of type 2 diabetes patients with evidence only for early retinal complications (mild non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy).
Participants
Patients enrolled in this study met the following inclusion criteria: diagnosed with type 2 diabetes according to current WHO criteria, age 40–75 years, mild to moderate non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) level ≤ 35) and disease activity shown by microaneurysms. Exclusion criteria included the presence of cataract disease, glaucoma, any other retinal disease, any eye surgery or treatment within a period of 6-months, pregnancy or breastfeeding, being on psychotropic medication or having any mood, anxiety or thought disorders as assessed by their treating physicians based on the clinical history. Patients with cardiac pacemaker or presence of metal implants on the body were also excluded. All participants gave a written informed consent. Tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki were followed and approval from the institutional board was obtained. Medical history and demographic data were recorded and fundus photography imaging for ETDRS grading was performed. Metabolic control assessed by HbA1C, ophthalmological examination, visual psychophysical testing and multimodal imaging were performed. We included 11 males and 7 females in our type 2 diabetes group.
The control group included 22 healthy subjects, age 49–71 years who underwent HbA1C assessment, ophthalmological examination and visual psychophysical testing.
Visual acuity assessment
Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) score was determined by letter counting using different charts for both left and right eyes. Subjects were instructed to read each line in sequence from left to right and top to bottom starting from the top-leftmost letters of each chart. The eyes with higher BCVA were used for the correlation studies.
Color fundus photography
Color fundus photographs of both eyes were taken according to the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) protocol. The 7-field photographs at 30° were obtained with a Zeiss FF450 camera (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA) after pupil dilatation. The photographs were used for DR classification according to ETDRS grading. Images of the macula field were used for automatic microaneurysm (MA) counting.
Computerized psychophysical tests
Set-up
Psychophysical testing software was programmed in MATLAB (MATLAB , The Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA) and previously tested in glaucoma patients (Mateus et al. ) using The Psychophysics Toolbox (PTB-3). Stimuli were presented on a 24-in. LCD-IPS monitor with a screen resolution of 1920 × 1200 pixels and a refresh rate of 60 Hz.
General characteristics of the test features
The psychophysical tests included three main novel features and featured a 2 alternative forced choice paradigm. This required the participant to compare and discriminate a certain visual feature (speed, achromatic luminance, and color discrimination) between two distinct moving dots (a reference and a target dot presented in opposite hemifields). The two dots only differed in the visual feature currently being tested.
The two squared dots measured 0.3 × 0.3 degrees for the speed discrimination task and 0.6 × 0.6 degrees for both the achromatic luminance and color discrimination tasks. Participants were instructed to fixate on a central black cross that had the size of 1 visual degree in the center of the screen. The stimuli and the fixation point were presented on a grey background. The background had a luminance of 25 cd/m 2 . The duration of the trial was 400 ms and the reference and target dots were presented at the same time to the participant while randomly alternating between the visual hemifields. The dots were moving back and forth along a 2-degrees random trajectory. Since dots were presented at the same time with random vectorial direction, the task could not be performed on the basis of estimating the final position of each dot. Figure 1 illustrates these different features.
The participant was positioned 50 cm away, after correction for refraction, from the display system in a darkened room. The experiments were executed monocularly where the eye with the highest BCVA was selected. The tests were repeated 4 times corresponding to the four different meridians assessed (the horizontal meridian at 0 degrees and the vertical meridian at 90 degrees, and two oblique meridians at 45 and 135 degrees). The number of trials per each meridian was determined by a nonlinear logarithmic staircase procedure which is explained in detail in (Mateus et al. ). Fig. 1 An illustration of the different visual psychophysical feature contrast discrimination tests used. The top-left corner image shows the possible positions of the reference and target dots . The remainder images show the different discrimination tasks in which the target dot represents the visual feature (speed, achromatic luminance or color discrimination) which the subject is supposed to discriminate from the reference one
Speed discrimination test
In this test, the reference and target dots had the same color, white, and same luminance, 30 cd/m 2 . The only different feature was the velocity of the target dot. The reference dot had a fixed velocity of 5 degrees/s whereas the target dot had an initial velocity of 24 degrees/s. The participant had to indicate which dot was moving faster and depending on their response the logarithmic staircase procedure would decrease the velocity of the target dot in subsequent trials until it reaches the reference velocity. The discrimination threshold is given by the algorithm when the participant is no longer able to discriminate the difference in velocity between the two dots.
Achromatic luminance discrimination test
In this test, both the reference and target dots were moving at the same velocity of 5 degrees/s and had an equal gray appearance where R = G = B. The only visual feature that was different between the target and reference dots was luminance. While the reference dot had a luminance of 30 cd/m 2 , the target dot had an initial luminance of 70 cd/m 2 . Similar to the speed discrimination test, the luminance of the target dot was gradually brought near to the reference dot according to the participant’s responses per the logarithmic staircase procedure. The discrimination threshold was given by the algorithm once the participant is no longer able to discriminate the difference in luminance between the two dots.
Color discrimination test
In this test, both the reference and target dots shared the same velocity of 5 degrees/s and the same luminance of 30 cd/m 2 . The noise luminance strategy was used to minimize the residual luminance cues. The addition of luminance noise ensures that the participant is only discriminating the chrominance cues (Castelo-Branco et al. ; Mateus et al. ). This was achieved by placing a matrix of luminance noise around each dot which was composed of 0.3-degree squared dots with 6 different luminance levels (30, 34, 38, 42, 46, or 48 cd/m 2 ). The luminance of each dot of this matrix randomly changed in each trial.
The reference dot had a LMS (long-wave, medium-wave, short-wave) coordinate of (l = 0.4106, m = 0.4108, and s = 0.4241) which gave the appearance of a gray-color dot. The target dot had different colors depending on which cone population is being tested. For example, while testing the L-cone feature, the m and s values were fixed at the reference level. L-cone test started at an l = 0.4732 (a pale red dot), the m-cone test started at an m = 0.5158 (a green dot) and the s-cone test started at an s = 0.9 (a purple dot). Similar to the achromatic luminance and speed discrimination tests, the target dot distinct feature, whether L, M or S cone stimulation, was brought down near the reference dot LMS coordinates according to the participant responses.
Dimension reduction of the psychophysical thresholds
The tests were repeated in four different meridian (0, 45, 90, and 135) and the thresholds for each meridian for a single feature were highly correlated. Therefore, principle component analysis was performed in SPSS to provide three representative variables for speed, achromatic luminance and color discrimination thresholds.
For speed discrimination thresholds, the values of the four meridians for the type 2 diabetes and the controls were included in the principal component analysis and a single factor was extracted which explains most of the variance from the four different meridians for that feature. Factor extraction for the achromatic luminance discrimination thresholds was performed in the same way as we did for speed discrimination thresholds.
Color discrimination tests included three different features depending on which main cone population was being stimulated and four different meridians for each feature, hence 12 different highly correlated variables. We chose to put all of the 12 repeated measures to our principal component analysis algorithm and extracted a single component that explained the variance in most of the different cone tests and was correlated with L, M and S cone thresholds from the different meridians .
The extracted factors had a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, hence standardized variables.
Brain structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS)
Data were acquired on a 3 T Siemens Scanner (Siemens Magnetom 3 T TimTrio, Erlangen, Germany). T1-weighted structural images of the brain were acquired with a MPRAGE sequence with: 1 mm 3 isotropic voxel, repetition time 2.53 s, echo time 3.42 ms, inversion time 1100 ms, flip angle 7°, field of view 256 × 256 mm 2 , 256 × 256 matrix, 176 slices and GRAPPA acceleration factor = 2. T2-weighted brain images were acquired from a FLAIR sequence with: 1 mm 3 isotropic voxel, repetition time 5 s, echo time 2.98 ms, inversion time 1.8 s, 256 × 256 matrix, 160 slices, GRAPPA acceleration factor = 2. A GABA-edited magnetic resonance spectra was collected using the MEGA-PRESS method (Edden et al. ) from a 27 cm 3 isotropic voxel, with echo time 68 ms, repetition time 1.5 s, 392 averages and 1024 data points. The T1 and T2-weighted images were analyzed for structural abnormalities and bright objects detection. The MRS voxel was positioned medially in the Occipital Cortex (Fig. 2 a). Grey matter (GM), white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fractions of the voxel were determined for each participant after tissue segmentation of the T1-weighted images using an in-house Matlab (R2012a, The MathWorks, USA) script based on the SPM8 (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, Institute of Neurology, UCL, London, UK, http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/ ) and VBM8 ( http://dbm.neuro.uni-jena.de/vbm8/ ) toolboxes. The MEGA-PRESS data were processed with Gannet software (Edden et al. ). GABA and total Creatine signals were obtained from the difference edited spectra. GABA and total Creatine peaks were fitted to a simple Gaussian and to a double Lorentzian models, respectively, and integrated for quantification (Fig. 2 b). Results are expressed as levels of GABA/Cr. Normalization to Creatine was used in order to reduce intersubject variance from both different signal-to-noise levels and CSF fraction within the voxel (Bogner et al. ).

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed with IBM SPSS Statistics version 20 software. Paired-sample t-student tests were used to investigate if there were differences between means of the main outcome variables within the period of one year. Pearson’s correlations were used to search for associations between the different variables in our study. Of particular interest was to assess the GABA/Cr predictive role of visual psychophysical thresholds as measured by correlating GABA/Cr from the first visit with psychophysical synthetic thresholds from the second visit one year later. Our statistical significance threshold was set at a p -value <0.05.

Changes in systemic and ocular parameters over one year
Paired t-tests were used to compare variables changes between the two visits. BCVA and systolic blood pressure improved significantly over the period of one year and were accompanied by a significant decrease in the number of retinal MA. Table 2 summarizes these findings. Table 2 Changes in systemic, metabolic and visual parameters over one year in the T2DM group ( N = 18).

Visual impairment in type 2 diabetes and systemic biomarkers
Additionally, using our novel set of visual psychophysical thresholds we found that speed discrimination thresholds were statistically different between type 2 diabetes and controls in both visits as is depicted in Table 3 . Table 3 Differences in psychophysical thresholds between the type 2 diabetes and control groups Control ( N = 22) Type 2 Diabetes ( N = 18) First visit p Second visit p Speed - 0.45 (− 0.60 – - 0.30) 0.41 (− 0.06–0.88) 0.003 0.29 (− 0.34–0.92) 0.040 Achromatic luminance - 0.19 (− 0.59–0.21) 0.29 (− 0.34–0.92) 0.183 0.14 (− 0.25–0.53) 0.271 Color discrimination - 0.17 (− 0.52–0.18) 0.08 (− 0.29–0.45) 0.347 0.33 (− 0.33–0.99) 0.204 These are standardized variables, hence the negative sign in the controls, meaning better performance. Controls had a single visit for their visual psychophysical assessment. Speed discrimination thresholds were statistically significantly higher in the type 2 diabetes group in both visits compared to the healthy controls. P -values represent the statistical significance of the difference in mean between Type 2 Diabetes and Control groups
BCVA was found to be negatively correlated with age in both visits and can also be predicted by age as is demonstrated in Table 4 . BCVA was also correlated with disease duration and Body Mass Index (BMI) was predictive of BCVA one year later. Table 4 BCVA within-visit correlations and BCVA prediction one year later by demographic, metabolic and ocular parameters in T2DM. ( N = 18) r p -value Within-visit correlations for the first visit Disease duration - 0.43 0.078 Age - 0.54 0.022 HbA1C - 0.20 0.421 ETDRS Level - 0.34 0.172 Number of MA 0.09 0.721 BMI - 0.32 0.203 Within-visit correlations for the second visit HbA1C - 0.17 0.505 Number of MA 0.28 0.258 BMI - 0.50 0.033 Prediction one year later Disease duration - 0.25 0.315 Age - 0.46 0.055 HbA1C - 0.10 0.696 ETDRS level - 0.23 0.356 Number of MA 0.08 0.761 BMI - 0.50 0.036 BCVA was negatively correlated with age and BMI within the same visit and was predicted by BMI one year later BCVA : Best corrected visual acuity; MA : Retinal microaneurysms; BMI : Body mass index; ETDRS : Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study
Speed discrimination thresholds also showed a positive correlation with ETDRS level ( r = 0.44, p = 0.071). In the second visit, HbA1C positively correlated with achromatic luminance discrimination thresholds ( r = 0.60, p = 0.009).
Occipital cortex GABA as a predictor of visual performance
GABA/Cr was not influenced by grey matter content in the analyzed occipital cortical voxels ( r = 0.20, p = 0.430). GABA/Cr significantly predicted speed and achromatic luminance discrimination thresholds within the first visit and one year later as is illustrated in Fig. 3 . GABA/Cr showed no significant pattern of correlation when correlating with color discrimination (small negative trend, but non significant). GABA/Cr was not related to age, disease duration, HbA1C, BMI, number of MA or ETDRS level. Fig. 3 GABA/Cr at baseline predicts speed and achromatic luminance discrimination thresholds at baseline. GABA/Cr also predicts speed discrimination thresholds one year later. r in the boxes represents Pearson’s correlation coefficient and p is the p -value of that correlation. All variables were log transformed
Discussion
In this study, we have three main novel findings related to type 2 diabetes visual performance in early diabetic retinopathy. Our cohort of type 2 diabetes patients scored worse in a novel speed discrimination task compared to healthy controls, and their lower visual acuity was predicted by systemic and retinal biomarkers whereas their speed and achromatic luminance discrimination thresholds were mainly explained by cortical processing.
Visual acuity was mildly impaired in the type 2 diabetes group which can be related to glycemic control (HbA1C level above 7.0%) (Mahmood and Aamir ) and elevated systolic blood pressure at baseline. Systolic blood pressure was previously reported to be negatively correlated with visual acuity (Ernest-Nwoke et al. ; Taura et al. ), and our findings are consistent with this notion, since visual acuity seemed to improve in the second visit while systolic blood pressure was also lower compared to the first visit. The difference in the number of MA in the type 2 diabetes group can be related to its high turnover rate (appearance and disappearance rate) (Ribeiro et al. ).
Our novel set of visual psychophysical testing is partially dependent on speed contrast detection of moving dots and several studies have shown that contrast-dependent visual tasks could be impaired in early type 2 diabetes (Krásný et al. ; Reis et al. ; Tsai et al. ). Indeed, we report for the first time that speed discrimination is impaired in type 2 diabetes patients as their thresholds were significantly higher than the control group in both visits. The notion that patients may perform differently and in relation to GABA levels depending on the type of visual task involved has been previously reported in major depressive disorder (Norton et al. ).
Visual acuity was negatively correlated with disease duration and age at baseline, and was predicted by the patient’s age one year later which agrees with the current literature (de Fine et al. ; Trento et al. ). Similar to Misra et al. findings, we show that speed and achromatic luminance discrimination thresholds are correlated with retinopathy grade and HbA1C respectively (Misra et al. ).
Occipital cortical GABA/Cr was of interest to us because it is known to be altered in type 2 diabetes (van Bussel et al. ) and to be higher in diabetes patients with cognitive impairment. As motion detection tasks were shown previously to be related to cortical processing and occipital GABA (Edden et al. ), we hypothesized that psychophysical tests with visual features of speed, achromatic luminance and color discrimination of moving dots will also be at least partly dependent on cortical processing.
A novel finding of our study is the observation that GABA/Cr not only predicts speed and achromatic luminance discrimination thresholds at baseline, but also one-year later. Higher GABA/Cr seems to be associated with higher speed and achromatic luminance discrimination thresholds which can be clinically translated into worse performance. The fact that GABA/Cr is positively correlated with worse psychophysical performance or contrast detection within and across time suggests that high levels of this neurotransmitter have a deleterious role. This is consistent with the observation that higher occipital GABA was found to be correlated with type 2 diabetes and cognitive impairment (van Bussel et al. ), and higher brain GABA concentration was also reported in Zucker Diabetic Fatty rat models (Sickmann et al. ). Additionally, it seems that contrast detection is dependent on occipital GABA/Cr but the direction of this relationship is different according to the task involved (speed and achromatic luminance versus color discrimination), see also Norton et al. .
One limitation of this study is that GABA/Cr values were not available for correlation with visual psychophysical thresholds within the control group.
In conclusion, we show that type 2 diabetes patients have visual impairment early in the disease even with early retinopathy by a novel speed discrimination task. We also show that occipital cortical GABA/Cr, seems to be a novel predictor of speed and achromatic discrimination thresholds at baseline and one year later, irrespective of level changes, in type 2 diabetes.
