Introduction
Acute pulmonary embolism (APE) is a serious cardiovascular and pulmonary complication that has been threatening the lives of patients, and has been associated with an excessively high mortality continuously. It is the third most common cause of cardiovascular death, after myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular stroke [ ]. Patients with right ventricle (RV) dysfunction and APE have a high mortality rate, and hence RV dysfunction is considered as a poor prognostic marker [ , ]. Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) has become the modality of choice for the diagnosis of APE as it offers a multiplanar view for the assessment of pulmonary vessels to the subsegmental levels. Extent of pulmonary vascular obstruction was graded through using pulmonary obstruction index (POI), described by Qanadli et al. [ ]. In this research, the follow-up results of 118 APE patients were analyzed retrospectively. After comparing CT measured cardiac parameters among the high-risk group, the low-risk group and the normal group, the correlation between the CT measured cardiac parameters and the POI was analyzed.
Materials and methods
General information
From June 2008 to January 2017, the CTPA images of the initial examination (within the first 24 h after onset) and the follow-up results (At least 6 months after thrombolytic therapy) were reviewed on 118 cases of APE patients (age: 26–88 years old, mean 66.7 years old; 61 males and 57 females). APE emergency treatment group was established by Emergency Center and Radiology Department for timely evaluation and treatment of APE patients. All of the cases included in this study were in line with the APE diagnostic criteria in the “2014 ESC Guidelines on the diagnosis and management of acute pulmonary embolism” [ ]. For all 118 APE patients, 44 cases were treated with thrombolytic therapy and 72 cases were treated with anticoagulation therapy and the other 2 cases died without any therapy. Other diseases that may cause changes in the size of the heart had been excluded in APE cases and normal control group of patients, such as chronic pulmonary heart disease, rheumatic heart disease, congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathy and so on.
Examination equipment and scanning parameters
The GE LightSpeed VCT (Volume Computed Tomography, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA) was used. The scanning parameters include helical type, 0.35 s/rot, 120 kV, 350 MA, collimator width 40 mm, standard mode and slice thickness 0.625 mm. 60 ml nonionic contrast agent (Iohexol, 300 mgl/ml) was injected at the rate of 5 ml/s, and 60 ml saline followed at the same rate. If the weight of patient was below 60 kg, the amount of nonionic contrast agent was counted based on 1.0 ml/kg. The image data were delivered to the AW4.4 Station and were processed by using the volume rendering (VR) and curved planar reconstruction (CPR) technique. And then cardiac parameters of CT were measured with the measurement tools. This retrospective analytical process was performed by two experienced doctors with a double-blind method.
CT measurement of the POI and the POI percentage
Extent of pulmonary vascular obstruction was graded through using POI [ ]. The arterial tree of each lung was regarded as having 10 segmental arteries (three to the upper lobes, two to the middle lobe and to the lingual lobe, and five to the lower lobes). The presence of embolus in a segmental artery was scored 1 point, and emboli in the most proximal arterial level were scored a value equal to the number of segmental arteries arising distally. To provide additional information about the residual perfusion distal to the embolus, a weighting factor was assigned to each value by means of the degree of vascular obstruction. This factor was equal to zero when no thrombus was observed; and 1 when partially occlusive thrombus was observed; or 2, with total occlusion. Isolated subsegmental embolus was considered as a partially occluded segmental artery and was assigned a value of 1. Thus, the maximal POI was 40 per patient. Therefore, the POI percentage can be expressed as: ∑(n × d)/40 × 100%, in which “n” is the value of the proximal thrombus in the pulmonary arterial tree equal to the number of segmental branches arising distally (minimum, 1; maximum, 20), and “d” is the degree of obstruction (minimum, 0; maximum, 2).
The CT measured cardiac parameters
Selected the maximum level of the left atrium, the longest diameters from left to right (LARL) and the longest anteroposterior diameter (LAAP) were measured. Selected the level of cardiac four-chamber, a straight line “m” was made through the anterior interventricular groove and the posterior interatrial groove, and then another line “n” was made between the left and right atrioventricular groove. The maximum vertical distances from the right outer edge of right atrium and right ventricle to the line “m” were their left to right diameters (RARL and RVRL). The maximum vertical distances from the anterior outer edge of right ventricle and the posterior outer edge of right atrium to the line “n” were their anteroposterior diameters (RVAP and RAAP). The maximum vertical distance from the anterior outer edge of left ventricle to the line “n” was its anteroposterior diameter (LVAP) and from the left outer edge to the line “m” was its diameter from left to right (LVRL). Then the ratios of right to left cardiac diameter were calculated, such as RALR/LALR, RAAP/LAAP, RVLR/LVLR and RVAP/LVAP.
Data analysis and statistical methods
Firstly, according to the Qanadli Score, 118 APE patients confirmed with CTPA were divided into high-risk group (47 cases, POI ≥ 20) and low-risk group (71 cases, POI < 20). The diameter from left to right (RL) and the anteroposterior diameter (AP) of the cardiac chambers were compared among the high-risk group, the low-risk group, and the normal group (60 cases). The measured cardiac parameters and the ages among three groups were compared by using Analysis Of Variance Average (ANOVA), then the multiple comparisons was estimated by using LSD test (Adjusted Tamhane t-test was made if there is heterogeneity of variance of interclass). The sexes among three groups were compared by using χ 2 test. Secondly, Linear Correlation Analysis was used between the measured cardiac parameters of CT and the POI. The above data were analyzed by using the SPSS 19.0 C (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) statistical software package. P < 0.05 indicated that differences were significant statistically.
Results
Clinical group for APE patients and follow-up results
According to the Qanadli Score, 118 APE patients confirmed with CTPA were divided into high-risk group 47 cases (age: 38–83 years old, mean 65.28 years old; 23 males and 24 females) and low-risk group 71 cases (age: 26–88 years old, mean 68.59 years old; 38 males and 33 females), and then compared with control group 60 cases (age: 42–81 years old, mean 64.03 years old; 33 males and 27 females). For age and sex, there was balance among the three groups (P > 0.05). In high-risk group, there were 35 cases with thrombolytic therapy and 10 cases with anticoagulation therapy (4 cases died, in which 2 died within the first 48 h and the other 4 cases died 2 months later) and 2 cases without any therapy (all died within the first 48 h). In low-risk group, there were 9 cases with thrombolytic therapy and 62 cases with anticoagulation therap. All death cases above died of right heart failure which was due to not using thrombolytic therapy. However, there were no death cases in low-risk group in the follow-up of 6 months. Using the four-chamber boundary line of heart, “m” and “n” as the measurement baseline, the patient’s cardiac chamber diameters were evaluated effectively in their chest CT or CTPA images. In high-risk group, the significant increase of right heart of APE patients was often found by non-enhanced chest CT (Fig. 1 ) before using CTPA for diagnosis. And the therapeutic effect can be effectively evaluated by comparing with the changes in right ventricular morphology between before and after treatment (Fig. 2 ). However, in the low-risk group, the right heart did not increase significantly (Fig. 3 ).
Fig. 1 APE patient of high-risk group, 71-year-old male, was admitted to the emergency department for 1 h for dizziness. This chest CT ( a ) was compared with the chest CT 8 months ago ( b ), showing a significant increase in the right atrium (RA) and right ventricle (RV), and decrease in the left atrium (LA) and left ventricle (LV), using the four-chamber boundary line of heart, “m” (red line) and “n” (green line), as the measurement baseline. In these changes, the left–right diameter (LR) is obvious
Fig. 2 APE patient of high-risk group, 63-year-old male, was hospitalized with chest tightness and shortness of breath. The CTPA ( a ) showed multiple emboli (↗) in the pulmonary artery, and the right atrium (RA) and right ventricle (RV) were significantly increased. Using “m” (red line) and “n” (green line) as the measurement baseline, the motion artifact of interventricular septum was obvious, but it did not affect the measurement. 10 days later, most of the emboli in the pulmonary artery had disappeared and the enlarged right heart had been relieved. After 10 days, the CTPA ( b ) showed that most of the emboli in the pulmonary artery had disappeared and the enlarged right heart had been relieved
Fig. 3 APE patient of low-risk group, 74-year-old female, was diagnosed with deep venous thrombosis of the lower extremity and had a sudden chest depression. The CTPA ( a ) showed multiple emboli (↗) in the pulmonary artery. Using “m” (red line) and “n” (green line) as the measurement baseline, the four-chamber view ( b ) showed no obvious enlargement of the right atrium (RA) and right ventricle (RV), with no obvious abnormalities in the proportion of the heart cavity
Comparative analysis of CT measured cardiac parameters
The two groups of APE patients, high-risk group (c) and low-risk group (b), were compared with the normal control group (a) (Table 1 ). Except for left ventricular AP and right atrial AP, there were statistically significant differences (P < 0.05) in the RL and AP of the each cardiac chamber. That showed the enlargement of right heart (group “a” < group “b” < group “c”), and the decrease in the size of left heart (group “a” > group “b” > group “c”). For LALR and LAAP, group “c” was significantly smaller than group “a” or group “b” ( P < 0.05), but there was no significant difference between group “a” and group “b” (P > 0.05). There was no significant difference in LVAP among the three groups ( P > 0.05). For RAAP, group “a” was significantly less than group “b” or group “c”, but there was no significant difference between group “b” and group “c”. For RVAP, group “c” was significantly greater than group “a” or group “b”, but there was no significant difference between group “a” and group “b”. The ratio of each diameter of right heart and left heart was statistically significant among the three groups, a < b < c ( P < 0.05).

Correlation analysis between POI and measured cardiac parameters
In this research, the correlation between the POI and the CTPA measured cardiac parameters in APE patients was analyzed (Table 2 ). The POI of 118 APE patients was 14.29 ± 9.53. There was no significant linear correlation between the POI and LVAP or RAAP (P > 0.05). For the other CT measured cardiac parameters, there were significant linear correlations between them and the POI ( P < 0.05). In particular, some correlation coefficients reached 0.5 or more, such as RALR (r = 0.538, P < 0.001), RVLR (r = 0.570, P < 0.001), the ratio of RALR/LALR (r = 0.646, P < 0.001) and the ratio of RVLR/LVLR (r = 0.666, P < 0.001).

Discussion
Acute pulmonary embolism (APE) is a serious cardiovascular and pulmonary condition, and it spans the entire spectrum between asymptomatic and immediately fatal disease, with early mortality rates ranging from 1 to 50% [ , ]. Regardless of the advancement in thromboprophylaxis, diagnosis, and treatment, APE remains an important determinant of in hospital complications and outcome [ ]. It is the third most common cause of cardiovascular death, after myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular stroke [ ]. Dysfunction of the right ventricle (RV) is a major severity index in APE patients. RV failure in this context associates a mortality which is 2–5 times higher than that of patients without ventricular dysfunction [ ]. Echocardiography is an effective and sensitive method for diagnosing right cardiac dysfunction, which can provide more important clinical parameters for the prognosis assessment of APE patients [ , ]. But echocardiographic assessment is not always possible in accident and emergency, hence a method to obtain measurable parameters easily is needed to predict the presence of RV dysfunction [ ]. Currently CTPA has become an important means of pulmonary embolism diagnosis, and with the continuous improvement of the CT spatial resolution and time resolution, CT shows that the cardiac anatomical structure is becoming more and more clear, which makes it possible to use CT image to evaluate cardiac function in CTPA examination [ , ]. So far, there is no uniform way to measure the heart using CTPA images. The usual method is to measure and calculate the ratio of the two ventricle inner diameter. On the one hand, it is difficult to find very precise points for measurement because the ventricular inner wall is irregular; On the other hand, no one can propose a uniform measurement baseline. All of these factors could cause the significant deviation of measurement. In this research the four-chamber boundary line of heart, “m” and “n”, was used as the measurement baseline to reduce the measurement deviation and to increase the feasibility and repeatability because of these reasons. The use of the cardiac outer diameter is due to the smooth outer margin which is easy to measure, and the enhanced image of cardiac chamber is no longer necessary for measurement, so this method can be used for non-enhanced chest CT. This method can be used to detect changes in right heart shape of APE patients with non-enhanced CT, and even before CTPA diagnosis. And the therapeutic effect can be effectively evaluated by comparing the changes in right ventricular morphology between before and after treatment by using CTPA or non-enhanced CT. But the biggest drawback of this method is that it doesn’t distinguish whether the enlargement of heart is due to changes of myocardial thickness.
Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is the imaging modality of choice for suspected pulmonary embolism, demonstrating high diagnostic accuracy [ ]. CTPA can offer a multiplanar view for the assessment of pulmonary vessels to the subsegmental levels. Extent of pulmonary vascular obstruction was graded using pulmonary obstruction index (POI), described by Qanadli et al. [ ]. With using of POI, adverse events of APE patients can be more accurately predicted [ , , ]. In this study, 118 APE patients confirmed with CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) were divided into high-risk group (POI ≥ 20) and low-risk group (POI < 20) according to the Qanadli Score, and were compared with the normal control group. The results found in this study were right atrium and right ventricle were significantly enlarged in the high risk group. Among them, the right ventricle of LR and AP were significantly increased, and right atrial LR was also significantly increased. Correspondingly, the LR and AP of left atrial and the LR of left ventricular was significantly reduced. Several studies have shown that the ratio from right to left ventricular diameter (RV/LV ratio) assessed on CTPA is associated with clinical outcomes [ ]. The primary role of the right ventricle (RV) is to deliver all the blood it receives per beat into the pulmonary circulation without causing the rise of right ventricle pressure. To the extent that it also does not impede left ventricular (LV) filling, cardiac output responsiveness to increased metabolic demand is optimized. When the pulmonary artery suddenly embolized, there was a sharp increase in the outflow resistance of RV, which led to the acute RV expansion, followed by tricuspid regurgitation [ ]. All of these factors can lead to a significant reduction in left ventricular blood volume, resulting in the decrease in the size of left atrium and left ventricular, increasing the RV/LV ratio. When this process is urgent and severe, shock can occur and even death. This is the main cause of death in APE patients [ , ].
How to evaluate the right cardiac function of APE patients with modern imaging methods quickly and effectively, which is always an issue of widespread concerned [ , ]. In this research we also found that there were significant linear correlations between other measured cardiac CT parameters and the POI except for LVAP and RAAP. Some of the correlation coefficients reached 0.5 or more, such as RALR (r = 0.538, P < 0.001), RVLR (r = 0.570, P < 0.001), the ratio of RALR/LALR (r = 0.646, P < 0.001) and the ratio of RVLR/LVLR (r = 0.666, P < 0.001). Therefore, in addition to the diagnosis of pulmonary artery embolism by CTPA, we can also measure the different diameters of cardiac cavities and estimate the right cardiac function. Some scholars have identified the RV/LV ratio greater than 1 as a CT measurement standard for the right heart enlargement [ ]. In this study, the ratio of right/left cardiac diameter was statistically significant among the three groups, group “a” < group “b” < group “c” (P < 0.05). Among them, for the RVRL/LVRL ratio and the RARL/LARL ratio, group “a” and “b” were both less than 1, while group “c” was greater than 1. This result supports the view of the above scholars. There was no significant linear correlation between the POI and LVAP or RAAP (P > 0.05), which is also the reason to choose the left–right diameter of the two ventricles as the observing and measuring targets. There were different correlation coefficients between POI and the measured cardiac parameters, which may reflect different hemodynamic changes, but it is necessary for further study by enlarging the sample size.
In conclusion, right atrium and right ventricular were enlarged with the increasing of POI in APE patients, but the left atrium and left ventricular were decreased in the size. These changes can be observed by using CTPA, even non-enhanced chest CT. Factors such as age and gender may have a significant adverse effect on the results of cardiac CT measurements [ ]. In this study, the age and gender balances of the group samples were analyzed, and they were balanced among the three groups (P > 0.05), which ensured the comparability of the parameters of each group. However, there are many confounding factors that cannot be removed, which may influence the research results to some extent, so further researches are needed to prove it.
