Introduction
Schistosoma mansoni is a trematode parasite found in South America, sub-Saharan Africa, Sudan, Egypt, and parts of the Middle East (WHO ). While infecting humans, adult schistosomes that live in the bloodstream are not able to cause significant pathology; however, eggs produced after female fertilization can trigger relevant immunopathological responses. This phenomenon is explained by the intense granulomatous reaction observed around eggs in the liver and small intestine, which accounts for almost all of schistosomiasis clinical symptoms (Burke et al. ). Oral administration of praziquantel (PZQ) remains as the first choice for schistosomiasis treatment as it is a well-tolerated, low cost, and effective drug. Despite its clinical safety, tolerance and resistance to PZQ have now been recognized for different Schistosoma species, including S. mansoni strains both in vitro and in vivo. These findings raise the scientific community concern, justifying the need for new drugs research and development (Lamberton et al. ; Mwangi et al. ; Pinto-Almeida et al. ).
Repurposing anti-cancer and antibacterial drugs against several helminthic infections has been trialed, due to reduced costs and ethical reasons (Cowan and Keiser ; Panic et al. ). One of these drugs is tamoxifen (TAM), an anti-cancer drug widely used to treat and prevent breast cancer as it works as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (Bhattacharya et al. ). TAM proved to be efficient in reducing parasite burden of Taenia crassiceps -infected mice (Terrazas et al. ) and against Echinoccocus granulosus infections by impairing hydatid development and the establishment of hydatidosis in mice (Nicolao et al. ). A limited number of studies have reported the effect of TAM against S. mansoni , focusing on its interference with the parasite hormonal physiology (Giannini et al. , ). There is no available data regarding TAM schistosomicidal activity in controlled in vitro and in vivo assays. Therefore, in the present work, we describe the in vitro effects of this anti-cancer drug on female and male S. mansoni morphology, motility, and egg production. Also, S. mansoni -infected mice were treated with TAM for further evaluation of worm survival and egg production.
Materials and methods
Animals and parasites
S. mansoni BH strain (Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil) was used in all experiments. The parasite life cycle was maintained in Biomphalaria glabrata freshwater snails in our laboratory at the Department of Animal Biology, Biology Institute, UNICAMP. Swiss/SPF female mice weighing ~ 20 g (4 weeks of age) were used as definitive hosts, being infected through tail exposure to a suspension containing 70 cercariae (Olivier and Stirewalt ). The Ethics Commission approved all experiments using rodents (CEUA/UNICAMP, protocol no. 2170-1).
Drug preparation
Tamoxifen (TAM) and TAM citrate (cTAM) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich® (St. Louis, MO, USA) and dissolved in 0.1% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and sterile normal saline solution (0.9% NaCl in water), respectively.
Schistosomicidal in vitro assays
S. mansoni worms were collected 8 weeks after infection, through the hepatic portal system and mesenteric vein perfusion as previously described (Pellegrino and Siqueira ). Worm couples (male/female pairs) were carefully washed in RPMI-1640 medium (Nutricell®) supplemented with 0.05 g/L streptomycin, 10,000 UI/ml penicillin, 0.3 g/L L-glutamine, 2.0 g/L D-glucose, 2.0 g/L NaHCO 3 , and 5.958 g/L HEPES. Sequentially, one couple was transferred to each well of a 24-well culture plate (TPP, St. Louis, MO, USA) containing RPMI-1640 medium and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO 2 atmosphere (de Oliveira et al. ). TAM and cTAM were tested at 2.5, 5, 15, or 45 μM. Schistosomes incubated with 0.1% DMSO was used as vehicle control groups. All experiments were performed in five replicates. Parasites were monitored for 72 h using an inverted optical microscope (DM-500, Leica®). Schistosomicidal effect was assessed with emphasis on the following parameters: morphology, parasite mating, motility, oviposition, and mortality (de Oliveira et al. ). Images of adults and eggs at the bottom of 24-well culture plates were obtained for each treatment condition using a camera adapted to DM-500, Leica® inverted optical microscope.
In vivo assays
Balb/C female mice weighing ~ 20 g were infected with 70 S. mansoni cercariae by tail immersion as previously described. Eight weeks after infection, animals were allocated to four groups ( n = 5 mice/group) and treated as follows: Group (I): a single dose of 100 mg/kg cTAM by gavage Group (II): a single dose of 100 mg/kg cTAM by intraperitoneal injection Group (III and IV): received 300 μL PBS solution orally and intraperitoneally, respectively
Animals were euthanized 2 weeks after treatment and parasites were recovered from the hepatic portal system through perfusion and quantified. Worm burden of treated mice was compared with infected and PBS-injected animals. Worm reduction percentages were calculated as described by Delgado et al. ( ). Oogram investigation was performed as recommended by Pellegrino et al. ( ). According to Pellegrino and colleagues, considering that the eggs are the main causative agents of schistosomiasis’ pathogenicity, the oogram is a valuable method when choosing a new drug against the disease, as it is an indicative of interruption in females’ oviposition. Then, small intestines were collected, opened longitudinally, washed in PBS, and compressed between two microscopy slides. Eggs retained in the small intestinal wall were classified as immature, mature, and dead, and the percentage of the different egg developmental stages (oogram pattern) was recorded (de Oliveira et al. ; Pellegrino et al. ). At least 100 eggs were evaluated per animal. Kato-Katz method was used for quantitative fecal examination (Katz et al. ). Fecal samples were collected individually from all animals and examined for further comparison with the oogram findings. Eggs were counted under a light microscope (Leica® DMI-500) after 24 h. Images of eggs were obtained and individual areas (A; in μm 2 ) were measured using the software Leica® LAS EZ4 HD, according to the formula: A = 1/2a × 1/2b × π ; where a = major radius and b = minor radius of the ellipse. Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism® v5.0a. Results were compared using the Mann-Whitney test for pairwise comparisons. Differences in parasite burdens and histological scoring were considered significant if p < 0.05.
Results
TAM is active against Schistosoma mansoni in vitro in a time- and dose-dependent manner
S. mansoni couples were maintained in 24-well plates for 72 h with increasing concentrations of TAM. As shown in Fig. 1 a, incubation of adult worms with 45 μM TAM led to approximately 50% of worm mortality. cTAM, instead, proved to be more effective not only at 45 μM, but also at lower concentrations in short intervals of incubation (Fig. 1 b). At 15 and 45 μM, cTAM killed 40 and 80% of adult worms after 48 h, respectively. After 72 h, mortality rates were around 20% for 2.5 and 5 μM, and resulted in 100% for 15 and 45 μM cTAM (Fig. 1 ). Fig. 1 Percentages of worm mortality quantified after 6, 24, 48, and 72 h of incubation with TAM ( a ) and cTAM ( b ). All experiments were performed in five replicates, being each replicate represented by one couple of Schistosoma mansoni incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO 2 atmosphere in RPMI-1640 medium. “0”, x -axis: control groups of worms maintained in medium for up to 72 h in the presence of 0.1% DMSO ( a ) or not ( b )
Female worms exposed to TAM and cTAM showed esophageal alterations, i.e., bulb-shaped esophagus (Fig. 2 a, d) and the presence of eggs with vacuolated content (Fig. 2 b, e). Eggs were severally malformed with internal content overflow and abnormally elongated lateral spine (Fig. 2 c, f). Male parasites suckers showed no movements and, upon touching, they were found completely stiff.

Oral and intraperitoneal administration of cTAM, at one single dose, reduces worm burden and the total number of S. mansoni eggs
One single dose of 100 mg/kg cTAM significantly reduced the total worm burden in S. mansoni -infected mice, either through oral (54%) or intraperitoneal (73%) administration. Furthermore, there was a decrease in the number of couples found for both treatments, as well as a significant reduction in the number of recovered males (Table 1 ).

Treatment led to a significant reduction in the number of eggs in feces when administrated both orally (~ 88%) and by the intraperitoneal route (~ 80%). A significant decrease in the number of immature eggs followed by an increase in the percentage of mature eggs was also detected in the intestinal tissues oogram pattern for treated animals (Table 2 ). Vacuolated cells were found in fecal and intestinal tissue eggs as well as dead miracidia. Eggs present in the stool of mice treated with cTAM intraperitoneally showed a significant decrease in area size when compared with the control group (Fig. 3 ).

Discussion
Several studies reported the effectiveness of repurposing already marketed drugs against helminthiasis (Panic et al. ). Some broad-spectrum drugs with well-established clinical use have been tested against different pathogens in an attempt of reposition them has therapeutic alternatives. An example of such drugs is tamoxifen (TAM), used over four decades for breast cancer (Kennecke et al. ; Panic et al. ; Radmacher and Simon ). TAM belongs to the selective estrogen receptor modulators family (SERMs), along with other drugs such as toremifen and raloxifen, since it presents an agonist or antagonist activity on estrogen receptors, depending on the target tissue. Its usage is mainly restricted against breast cancer in postmenopausal women, even though clinical studies attest its long-term efficiency in comparison to aromatase inhibitors (Aihara et al. ). Although TAM-estrogen receptor interaction is well recognized, we still do not understand its entire mechanism of action. However, it is known that TAM exhibits other molecular effects that are independent from its interaction with the estrogen receptor, such as interference with signaling proteins (e.g., caspases and calmodulin) (Altan et al. ; Lavie et al. ; Mandlekar and Kong ; Zhang et al. ).
TAM’s activity against protozoan parasites is well known against intra- and extracellular forms of trypanosomatids, as well as in experimental infections in BALB/c mice and golden hamsters (Eissa et al. ; Miguel et al. , , , ). Additionally, Vargas-Villavicencio et al. ( ) described the cysticide activity of TAM against Taenia crassiceps in vitro and also showed its protective activity against murine cysticercosis. Escobedo et al. ( ) showed that golden hamsters treated every other day with TAM (1 mg/kg for 15 days) presented 70% reduction in the intestinal fixation of T. solium . It has been demonstrated that TAM inhibits E. granulosus protoscoleces and metacestodes survival as well (Nicolao et al. ).
Given TAM’s anti-plathyhelmintic potential, we aimed to investigate its activity against trematoda parasites, such as S. mansoni . Few data regarding TAM’s activity against S. mansoni can be found, and most of it evaluates the physiologic aspects regarding the parasite sexual maturity. Giannini et al. ( ) described the role of estrogen receptors during S. mansoni ’s egg development, observing lower maturation levels in females and eggs with morphologic changes. Our results are in accordance with the previously described, as in in vitro assays, the drug caused morphological alterations in eggs and adults. In vitro, both TAM and cTAM were capable of inducing worm mortality, particularly cTAM that led to 100% mortality rate at 15 and 45 μM after 72 h. Perhaps, TAM in its salt form was more active due to its more effective solubilization. In fact, cTAM is the commercial form of the drug orally taken by patients treating breast cancer. In 2015, Cowan and Keiser ( ) showed that cTAM, at 5.7 μM, reduced 50% of S. mansoni survival.
In S. mansoni -infected mice, TAM and cTAM caused significant reduction in the total worm burden after administrated orally (54%) or intraperitoneally (73%) after one single oral dose. In previous studies obtained by our group (Frezza et al. ), a single dose of PZQ (100 mg/kg) led to total worm burden reduction of 27%. There was also a significant reduction in the number of eggs in feces for cTAM-treated groups as well as a decrease in the percentage of immature eggs and increase of mature eggs in intestinal tissues. It is worth mentioning that eggs in the intestinal wall and in feces presented dead miracidia and vacuolated atypical internal structures, similar to those found in in vitro assays. Our results suggest that TAM affected the parasite reproductive system, inhibiting the development of S. mansoni eggs and interrupting or reducing oviposition of the female worms. It is also important to notice that cTAM administration led to a significant decrease in egg size. The decrease in the number of fecal eggs as well as morphological alterations observed are extremely relevant in terms of schitosomiasis controlling and prevention. In this scenario, S. mansoni eggs play a key role in terms of parasite life cycle maintenance and schistosomiasis pathogenesis, as eggs retention in the host tissues and organs are capable of triggering inflammatory responses resulting granuloma formation (Gryseels et al. ).
Usually, breast cancer treatment with TAM is long term (~ 5 years) and, although TAM is well tolerated and has few side effects, thromboembolic events and endometrium proliferation are associated with prolonged use (Miguel et al. ). The dose choice in our study was based on previous studies that showed TAM’s safety for this animal model (DeGregorio et al. ; Miguel et al. ; Rotheneichner et al. ). No death and changes in weight, hair loss, or bristling fur were noticed for cTAM-treated mice. Our results were obtained after treatment with a single dose, further reducing the risk of potential side effects and showing the therapeutic potential of TAM against S. mansoni .
