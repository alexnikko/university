Purpose
Uterine papillary serous carcinoma (UPSC) is a type II endometrial carcinoma accounting for 10–15% of all endometrial carcinomas [ , , , , ]. They present with different clinical and histopathological features and have poor outcome when compared to more commonly seen endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the uterus [ , , ]. About 50% of uterine cancer recurrences and 50% deaths due to endometrial carcinoma are because of these high-risk histological subtypes [ ]. The poor outcome in UPSC is often because of higher stage at the time of presentation and relapse in the upper abdomen [ , ]. Randomised control trials are scarce because of their comparatively lower incidence [ ]. The purpose of this study was to analyse the clinical and surgico-pathological features of UPSC.
Methods
This is an institutional ethical review board-approved retrospective chart review assessing clinical, surgical and pathological features in women diagnosed with UPSC in a tertiary centre between March 2013 and August 2016. There were ten patients of UPSC in this study period. Data was retrieved from the patient’s medical records. All patients underwent surgical staging as per the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) criteria at the time of diagnosis except in specific instances where inoperability was anticipated and in patients with medical co-morbidities. These cases received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). The pathological characteristics which were noted were myometrial invasion, lymphovascular invasion, cervical involvement, peritoneal cytology, metastases to lymph nodes and omentum. All patients diagnosed with UPSC were staged according to FIGO 2009 criteria [ ]. The adjuvant chemotherapy which was administered was paclitaxel, carboplatin and epirubicin. The number of cycles of chemotherapy ranged from three to six. Adjuvant radiotherapy was given in three patients. Follow-up was documented, and survival status was noted.
Results
During the study period, ten patients were identified with UPSC. The mean age was 63.8 years (range 50–78 years) with 50% of patients aged more than 65 years. The average body mass index (BMI) was 28.78. Post-menopausal bleeding (PMB) was the commonest presenting symptom in 60% of the patients. An endometrial thickness or obvious growth of more than 2 cm with a range of 2.8–60 mm was noted in 50% of the patients on pre-operative ultrasound. Pre-operative endometrial biopsy revealed UPSC in nine of ten patients, and one patient had endometrioid adenocarcinoma. Clinical characteristics are explained in Table 1 .

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with paclitaxel, carboplatin and epirubicin was administered in two patients because of inoperability and medical co-morbidities. Complete surgical staging—Type-1 hysterectomy (TAH), bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) and retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND)—was possible in five of ten patients. Two patients had TAH + BSO + pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND), and three patients had only TAH + BSO because of associated co-morbidities. All ten patients underwent peritoneal cytology (PC) and infra-colic omentectomy (ICO)/total omentectomy (TO). Omentectomy was not performed because of intra-operative spontaneous pneumothorax in one patient. FIGO stage IA was observed in one patient, IIIC2 in three patients, IVB in three patients and stage unknown (UK) in three patients. Two of three patients in whom RPLND was not carried out and one of two patients in whom NACT was given were considered as stage unknown. In one patient in whom RPLND was not carried out, the omentum had disease and in another patient in whom NACT was given, lymph nodes were found to be positive for metastases. Myometrial invasion (MI) of more than 50% in eight (80%), lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) in seven (70%), negative peritoneal cytology in nine (90%), cervical involvement in two (20%) and omental involvement in three (30%) were noted. Lymph node metastases were noted in five (50%) patients, of which four (40%) patients had both pelvic and para-aortic lymph node involvement and one (10%) patient had only pelvic lymph node involvement. Surgico-pathological features are explained in Table 2 .

Adjuvant chemotherapy/radiotherapy though advised was refused by the lone patient staged IA. Adjuvant chemotherapy with paclitaxel, carboplatin and epirubicin (3–6 cycles) was received by nine out of ten patients. Adjuvant radiotherapy was given in three patients—two patients received intra-vaginal brachytherapy with 7.5 Gy for four sessions and one patient received extended radiotherapy. Follow-up revealed that two patients had expired within 6 and 8 months of adjuvant treatment, respectively, of which one patient was stage IVB initially and another patient had progressive disease with adjuvant chemotherapy. One patient was non-complaint for follow-up, and four patients are disease-free with one patient still on adjuvant chemotherapy. During follow-up, one patient had intra-abdominal recurrence two years of after completion of adjuvant treatment and is now on palliative chemotherapy. Adjuvant treatment and recurrence pattern are explained in Table 3 .

Discussion
Uterine papillary serous carcinoma has high-grade complex histological characteristics and is known to have a poor prognosis because of it being more aggressive biologically [ ] and increased rate of local and distant recurrences. UPSC is usually seen in older, lean and multi-parous women [ , , , ]. The mean age in this study was 63.8 years, most women were overweight with an average BMI of 28.78, and 90% of women were multi-parous. Post-menopausal bleeding is the commonest complaint seen in women with UPSC [ ] which was also seen in our study with 60% of patients presenting with PMB. In our study, one patient had a maternal history of carcinoma breast, and few studies have shown increased association of Lynch-associated malignancies and carcinoma breast in patients with UPSC [ , ].
Type II carcinoma endometrium is usually seen in atrophic endometrium [ , ]. However, in our study 50% of women with UPSC presented with endometrial thickness of more than 20 mm. Pipelle biopsy in a setting of UPSC is shown to have a sensitivity of 99% [ ]. Novak’s endometrial curette for pre-operative endometrial biopsy was used by us, and nine of ten patients in this study were diagnosed to have UPSC. One of the contributing factors for worst outcome in UPSC is it usually presents in an advanced stage at the time of diagnosis [ , ]. The FIGO annual report states that 46% of women with UPSC were found to have stage II to stage IV disease [ ]. Even in our study, at least 60% of the women presented in stage III and stage IV disease which is in agreement with the FIGO annual report.
Lauchalan and Hendrickson et al. first described UPSC as an entity which is histologically similar to serous epithelial ovarian carcinoma [ ]. The management of UPSC is similar to carcinoma ovary in which the primary modality of management is laparotomy/laparoscopy and surgical staging which includes TAH + BSO + PC + omentectomy + RPLND [ ]. Our study reports that 80% patients had surgery as the primary treatment. Fifty per cent of the patients had complete surgical staging, 20% had TAH + BSO + PLND and 30% had only TAH + BSO. Omentectomy was a part of the surgical staging in our study as UPSC is known to have intra-abdominal and lymph node metastases as similarly seen in carcinoma ovary [ , ]. Three of nine patients who had omentectomy showed omental metastases. However, other studies suggest that omentectomy might not be included as a routine for surgical staging in UPSC [ ]. NACT has been administered in few studies successfully in UPSC [ , ].
Large number of studies have proved that survival and volume of residual disease left after cytoreductive surgery are inversely related to prognosis and survival in carcinoma ovary [ ]. As UPSC also has a predilection to intra-peritoneal and lymph node metastases which is also commonly seen in carcinoma ovary, completeness of cytoreductive (CC) surgery is important in UPSC also. Complete cytoreduction (CC-0) was achieved in 80% of patients and 20% patients had suboptimal cytoreduction (CC-3) in this study which is similar to other studies carried out in UPSC [ ]. Of these two suboptimally debulked patients, one expired after 8 months of adjuvant chemotherapy and another patient had progressive disease with adjuvant chemotherapy and died within 6 months indicating the aggressive nature of the disease.
Whether there is any therapeutic benefit from pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy in patients with UPSC is still a question. UPSC presents with disease in extra-uterine sites like lymph nodes, intra-peritoneal structures and vascular channels even in the absence of high-risk factors like deep myometrial invasion [ ]. In our study, 80% of patients had more than 50% of myometrial invasion and of those lymph node involvement was seen in 50% of the patients. Also one patient who had recurrence was found to have recurrence in the lymph nodes. This shows the propensity of the tumour to spread through the lymphatics and need for lymphadenectomy. Lymphovascular space involvement was observed in 70% of patients. Because of the disease rarity, it is difficult to lay down recommendations whether complete surgical staging is required to guide and aid the requirement of adjuvant treatment is still unanswered. Serous tubular intra-epithelial carcinoma (STIC) is found to be a precursor for high-grade serous carcinomas of ovary and primary peritoneal carcinoma [ ]. One patient had tumour in fallopian tube with foci of STIC in this study.
Retrospective studies do support the use of adjuvant therapy in UPSC [ , ]. Stage I UPSC has a survival of only 50–80% [ ]. Though there are studies which show the benefit of adding platinum-based chemotherapy to stage IA patients [ ], there may be a group of stage IA patients who are eligible for observation alone after complete surgical staging. Clinical and histopathological features which are required to allow such patients for observation alone to have disease-free survival are yet to be addressed. Though this study is for 3 years only, we have observed that patients who underwent complete surgical staging and have received at least three cycles of platinum-/taxane-based chemotherapy with or without adjuvant radiotherapy had better prognosis and decreased recurrence rate which is in agreement with other studies conducted on UPSC [ ].
Multiple studies have argued between observation versus platinum-based chemotherapy in early-stage disease. Fader et al. [ ] reported a decreased recurrence rate with increased progression-free and overall survival in patients with stages I and II disease treated with platinum-/taxane-based chemotherapy. He also reported a lower rate of recurrence in patients treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone and patients only under observation. The stage IA patient who refused adjuvant RT is disease free after 1 year of surgery. GOG report number 122 showed improved outcomes with combination chemotherapy (doxorubicin, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide) [ ]. Hendrickson et al. concluded that “it would seem reasonable to try cytotoxic agents such as adriyamycin, cytoxan and cisplatinum which are known to be of some efficacy in treating serous carcinomas of the ovary” [ ]. Our series had 90% of patients requiring adjuvant chemotherapy and were treated with paclitaxel, carboplatin and epirubicin. Three patients received adjuvant radiotherapy with chemotherapy (two patients received brachytherapy and one patient received extended radiotherapy elsewhere).
Advanced stages II to IV are noted to have 90% recurrence rate in various studies [ , , ]. Only one patient had intra-peritoneal (liver and lymph nodes) recurrence after 2 years in this study and is receiving platinum-/taxane-based chemotherapy. Though the study number is too small, our case series of UPSC tries to emphasise this issue of treating patients of UPSC with cytoreductive surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy.
This study has certain limitations such as it is retrospective in nature and the number of patients is too few. However, considering the rarity of the disease, number of cases seems to be reasonable in this short duration of study.
Conclusion
Complete cytoreductive surgery followed by adjuvant platinum-/taxane-based chemotherapy with or without adjuvant radiotherapy should be the choice of treatment for women with UPSC. Long-term surveillance is the cornerstone to pick up recurrences as early as possible. Though randomised control trials (RCTs) are the standard for treatment evaluation, to undertake a RCT in a population of UPSC may be difficult because of the rarity of the disease. Hence, a multi-centre collaborative study is required which would aid in collecting data, studying the pattern of disease, treatment modalities, type of adjuvant treatment required, prognosis and survival.
Scope for Thought
Uterine papillary serous carcinoma has histological and biological behaviour similar to serous epithelial carcinoma of ovary. The management of UPSC is also in similar lines of management of serous epithelial carcinoma of ovary. However, staging of UPSC is carried out according to FIGO carcinoma endometrium staging. In our experience, we have not come across a single case with stage IVB of UPSC which had extra-peritoneal or extra-abdominal metastases which is usually seen in carcinoma endometrium and less seen in carcinoma ovary. This raises a question onto whether UPSC should have a separate staging system in lines with carcinoma ovary rather than carcinoma endometrium?
