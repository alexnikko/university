Introduction
Recent years have witnessed many advances in the treatment of cardiovascular disorders. In particular, percutaneous coronary intervention for acute myocardial infarction (MI) has dramatically improved clinical outcomes in such patients [ , ]. However, MI may cause ischemic heart failure (HF) due to impaired cardiac function or recurrence of MI [ ]. Therefore, prevention of recurrence of acute MI is a key aspect of prevention of chronic HF in these patients, along with prognostic treatments of chronic HF [ , , ]. Type II diabetes mellitus (DM), which is often complicated by ischemic heart disease [ , ], constitutes a strong risk factor for arteriosclerotic disease [ ]. Such arteriosclerotic changes are known to develop before the onset of clinically overt DM or in the stage of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) [ , , ]. The onset of DM in subjects with IGT has been shown to be amenable to prevention by optimal medical therapy or pharmacotherapy in Western and Japanese studies [ , ].
Indeed, IGT is a precursor of DM and has been shown to be a risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity via excessive production of oxidative stress [ , ]. Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors have been shown to prevent the progression of IGT to overt DM [ ] and cardiovascular events in patients with IGT who have no history of MI [ ]. However, it is not clear if alpha-glucosidase inhibitors reduce cardiovascular events in patients with IGT and a history of MI.
Therefore, we conducted a multicenter, prospective, randomized, open blinded-endpoint (PROBE) study to evaluate effects of aggressive intervention with the alpha-glucose inhibitor voglibose on cardiovascular events in patients with IGT and a history of MI.
Methods
Study Design
The ABC study (Alpha-glucosidase-inhibitor Blocks Cardiac Events in Patients with Myocardial Infarction and Impaired Glucose Tolerance) was a PROBE study conducted in 112 hospitals and clinics in Japan. The trial is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov (No. NCT00212017).
Participants
We recruited patients who had clinically overt MI. Inclusion criteria were individuals of 21 to 79 years old with fasting plasma glucose levels of ≤126 mg/dL, a 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) value of between 140 to 199 mg/dL, and HbA1c levels of ≤6.5% (47.5 IFCC). Exclusion criteria were acute MI occurring within the last 7 days; patients with NYHA symptoms of no fewer than class II or with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of no more than 40%; suspected type I DM; patients scheduled for coronary angioplasty; history of coronary artery bypass graft surgery; patients with serious liver or kidney damage; history of allergy or drug hypersensitivity; arteriosclerosis obliterans with Fontaine stage III or worse; and inability to understand and/or comply with study medications, procedures, and/or follow-up or any conditions that may render the patient unable to complete the study in the opinion of the investigator.
All patients provided written informed consent. The study protocol was approved by the institutional review boards and the ethics committees of all hospitals involved. The study was performed in accordance with the principles enshrined in the Declaration of Helsinki and Japanese ethical guidelines for clinical research.
Randomization and Masking
All patients were randomly assigned (1:1) through a web-based central randomization system using computer-generated random numbers (NTT Data, Tokyo, Japan) to receive either pharmacologic intervention with voglibose (the voglibose group) or nonpharmacologic interventions (the control group). We employed permuted blocked randomization. This study was open-labeled, and allocation was unmasked to the patients and investigators, but masked to the event adjudication committee and the data and safety monitoring board (DSMB).
Procedures
Participants in the voglibose group were administered a voglibose tablet (0.2 mg) three times daily before meals. In the event of gastrointestinal side effects such as abdominal distension, diarrhea, and flatulence, the dosage of voglibose was reduced to half or a quarter of the original dosage. Participants assigned to the control group were treated only with diet and exercise therapy. In the event of exacerbation of DM in patients in any of the groups, dietary or exercise therapy was reinforced by expert nutritionists and/or physical therapists besides each attending physician. When reinforced nonpharmacological therapy could no longer improve DM, concomitant use of sulfonylureas was permitted. All participants were followed up for 2 years for occurrence of cardiovascular and adverse events. Body weight, blood pressure, results of 75-g OGTT, HbA1c level, serum triglyceride and total cholesterol levels, plasma BNP level, LVEF and diastolic parameters (E/A) measured by echocardiography, and medications were documented at baseline and at 24 months. All data were compiled at the data center in the NTT Data (Tokyo, Japan) and G-ONE (Osaka, Japan).
Outcomes
The primary outcome was the time until the first cardiovascular composite endpoint of death from cardiovascular death, and hospitalization due to nonfatal MI, nonfatal unstable angina [ ], nonfatal stroke, or treatment with coronary revascularization (percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft). Secondary outcomes were death from cardiovascular disease, nonfatal MI, nonfatal unstable angina, treatment with coronary revascularization, nonfatal stroke, death from any cause, and hospitalization for HF.
Statistical Analysis
The calculation of sample size was based on the estimated occurrence of the composite primary endpoint following 24 months of the study period. Since the previous studies [ , , , ] provided a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.717 with survival rates of 89% at 24 months in the control group, we estimated the total sample size of 3000 subjects along with 325 events (1500 per group). This sampling size provided 85% power of one-sided log-rank test of 2.5% significance level to detect the assumed reduction, when the loss of patients during the follow-up was assumed up to 15%.
When about 30% of the target patients were enrolled, we scheduled an interim futility analysis to evaluate whether the results so far were inconclusive or indicated a lack of superiority of voglibose over the control intervention. If the latter were the case, this study would be discontinued because of an inefficient use of resources and potentially being unethical. For futility analysis, the method of predictive interval plots (PIPS) [ ] was used to predict 95% confidential intervals (CI) at a future time-point, i.e., the end of study. PIPS were created for the primary composite endpoint conditional on “data observed to date” and scenarios regarding “data yet to be collected.” The scenarios were (1) the observed trend continues, (2) the alternative hypothesis is true, (3) the null hypothesis is true, and (4) the best- or worst-case scenarios are true. For each scenario, the number of replications was set to 10,000 to generate data yet to be collected. No formal statistical test was performed to evaluate the futility by the DSMB, and there was no type I error cost associated with the futility analysis. Based on the futility analysis for the primary composite endpoint using PIPS, the DSMB eventually recommended that the study should be terminated because of absence of beneficial treatment effect of voglibose compared with that of control subjects ( Supplementation for the result and supplemental Figure 1 ). As per the recommendations, the executive committee decided to stop this trial.
The efficacy analysis was based on the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle. Continuous data are presented as median with inter quartile range (IQR), where IQRs are presented in terms of 25th and 75th percentiles. Categorical data are presented as frequencies (%). Event-free survival for the primary composite event was calculated from the date of randomization to the composite endpoints, whichever happened first. Data on patients who were alive and did not experience the events were censored at their last date of follow-up. The event-free survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method; the between-group differences in survival were assessed using the log-rank test. HRs with 95% CI were calculated by Cox proportional hazard regression including those for the subgroup analyses. The proportional hazards assumption was graphically investigated, based on the Schoenfeld residuals over the time. The primary outcomes were also analyzed based on the per-protocol population to assess the robustness of the conclusion from the ITT analysis. All tests were two-sided, and a p value of <0.05 was considered indicative of a statistically significant between-group difference. All analyses were performed using the statistical analysis software SAS, version 9.3 for Windows (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).
Results
Figure 1 shows the trial profile. We enrolled 870 patients between May 2005 and June 2012. Of these, 11 patients were excluded from the ITT population because of withdrawal of informed consent and inappropriate enrolment. Twenty-four patients were excluded from the per-protocol set (PPS) population because of failure to meet the entry criteria. Thus, 859 participants were included in the ITT population and 835 patients were included in the PPS population. Fig. 1 Trial profile
Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the patients. The follow-up period was 2 years in both groups. Table 2 shows the follow-up data on systolic blood pressure (SBP), laboratory investigations, and LVEF 2 years after enrolment. Although SBP, HbA1c, fasting glucose, total cholesterol level, and BNP level were not significantly altered, the glucose levels at 2 h of 75-g OGTT test in the voglibose group were significantly lower than those in the control group.

Figure 2 shows that voglibose did not decrease the frequency of the cardiovascular composite endpoints (HR = 1.24; 95% CI, 0.82–1.86; p = 0.31). This result was comparable with the primary outcome assessed using PIPS. In Fig. 3 , we found that the voglibose group had no chance to be superior to the control group with respect to reduction in cardiovascular composite endpoints. Figure 4 shows the subgroup analyses for the primary outcome. No significant factors that enhanced or reduced the effect of voglibose were detected. Data on primary and secondary endpoints showed no difference in the incidence of cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal unstable angina, coronary revascularization, nonfatal stroke, all-cause mortality, or hospitalization for HF (Table 3 ).

In addition to the severe adverse events detected as primary and secondary endpoints (Table 3 ), the frequency of additional adverse events in the voglibose group was higher than that in the control group (89 vs. 49 events, p < 0.0001 by Fisher’s exact test). The frequency of gastrointestinal disorders in the voglibose group was higher than that in the control group (36 vs. 3 events, p < 0.0001 by Fisher’s exact test). These side effects of voglibose are well-known. The hepatic disorders (7 vs. 2 events), benign and malignant disorders (8 vs. 3 events), metabolic and nutritional disorders (6 vs. 0 events) including hypoglycemia (3 vs. 0 events), nervous system disorders (6 vs. 5 events), infectious disorders (7 vs. 7 events), renal and urinary disorders (2 vs. 1 events), cardiac disorders (5 vs. 13 events), and vascular disorders (2 vs. 6 events) in the voglibose and control groups were infrequent.
Discussion
In this study, we tested the hypothesis that alpha-glucosidase inhibitors prevent cardiovascular events (secondary prevention) in IGT patients with a history of MI. The results show that voglibose, an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, did not decrease the incidence of the primary endpoint of cardiovascular composite events in previous MI patients with IGT. We further found that sex, age, BMI, history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, or smoking did not affect the primary outcomes. Likewise, no effect was observed with respect to the secondary endpoints, although voglibose ameliorated the severity of IGT. Thus, the treatment of IGT using an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor did not provide any substantial and significant benefit for cardiovascular clinical outcomes in patients with both previous MI and IGT (Central Illustration). Our results contradict the positive results from the STOP-NIDDM study [ ]. Although the results of the present study are novel and may shed light on the secondary prevention of MI, several issues need to be considered while interpreting the results.
First of all, the dose of voglibose used may not be enough to decrease the incidence of cardiovascular events. Furthermore, the possibility of poor compliance with voglibose therapy cannot be denied. Poor compliance of an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor was also observed in a landmark trial using the alpha-glucosidase inhibitor acarbose [ ]. However, IGT appeared to be well treated by the alpha-glucosidase inhibitor in the present study (Table 2 ).
Secondly, it took 7 years to enroll 870 patients because it was not easy to perform 75-g OGTT for the enrolment in candidate patients. The current study was not completed as planned, and the results could have been different if the study had been continued to enroll the planned number of patients. The DSMB recommended the discontinuation of the present study based on the results of the interim analysis and because our hypothesis that voglibose significantly prevents cardiovascular events in patients with previous MI and IGT was not met. The DSMB found no chance to prove the superiority of voglibose when the predicted interval plots were statistically analyzed. Even if the hypothetical hazard ratio was modulated to 0.9 or 0.8 from the initial value of 0.657, the present results did not change. We could have been able to continue the present study until the completion of the enrolment, but the DSMB considered the ethical aspects associated with the continuation of the study to be serious. Thus, the present study per se seems to be well conducted, but our hypothesis was rejected.
Thirdly, this study was conducted with the PROBE method [ ], i.e., the patients were not blinded to their enrolled group because of the limited budget. This may have caused that the patients allocated to the control group could try to improve the IGT by better adherence to exercise or diet to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. This phenomenon is well documented and is known to improve outcomes in the control group [ ]. Indeed, in both groups, patients in Japan are followed and therapy prescribed every 1–3 months as required by the medical insurance. At each visit, blood tests including plasma glucose level were performed, and both diet and physical activity were checked in all enrolled patients. Furthermore, the advice for physical activity including exercise and walking was provided by expert nutritionists and/or physical therapists besides each attending physician. Therefore, we cannot deny this possibility. However, we observed that voglibose improved glycemic control in patients in the IGT group compared with that in the control group, which implies that diet and/or exercise are not superior to voglibose treatment for improved glycemic control in patients with IGT. Furthermore, a 20-year follow-up from the original Da Qing Diabetes Prevention Study showed that, although lifestyle changes could produce a long-lasting reduction in the incidence of type 2 DM, the effects on cardiovascular events were at best modest [ ]. In Japanese IGT patients with a high risk factor for cardiovascular events, the rate of macrovascular events was 1.3% ( n = 12) out of 897 patients on voglibose and 2.0% ( n = 18) out of 881 patients on placebo; voglibose did not seem to decrease cardiovascular events [ ].
Fourthly, the cardiovascular event rate may be too small in the Japanese population to demonstrate the effect of treatment. Indeed, in a Western study population, the event rate for patients with IGT in the placebo group was 4.7% ( n = 32) out of 686 patients over a period of 3.3 years [ ], which is approximately three times higher than that in Japanese patients with IGT (2.0%) for 3 years. [ ] However, in the current study, the cardiovascular event rate in the placebo group with previous MI was 10·3% ( n = 45) out of 438 patients over 2 years, which is more than three times higher than that in Western patients with IGT and no previous MI. Indeed, in the NAVIGOTOR study performed in Western countries, the cardiovascular event rate in patients with IGT and established cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular risk factors in the placebo group was 22.9% ( n = 1070) out of 4675 patients over a period of 5 years [ ] which is similar to our patient profile and cardiovascular event rate. As acarbose, another alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, significantly reduced the cardiovascular event rate in patients with IGT [ ], the negative results in the current study may not be attributable to the low cardiovascular event rate in the Japanese population. Indeed, the cardiovascular event rate in the patients with previous MI is not so low in the Japanese population compared with that in the Western population.
Fifthly, the number of the data and the events may be thought to be too small to draw the present conclusion but it is not. At the beginning, we set the sampling size at 3000 (1500 each for the voglibose and control groups) to give this study sufficient power for the superiority primary analysis. However, after an independent statistician performed the interim futility analysis, the DSMB recommended that the trial should be stopped to prevent patients from being unnecessarily exposed to an ineffective intervention. The data seemed to be small compared with other large-scale clinical trials. However, when we consider this study from a different angle, it appears that we can obtain firm data using a relatively small population. This study and process would seem more ethical because we have prevented to expose the patients to unnecessary interventions.
Finally, the time-point for the correction of IGT in patients with a previous MI may have been too late to have an effect on cardiovascular events. We believe that this is the most likely explanation for the lack of treatment effect observed in the present study. As a previous MI itself increases the possibility of recurrent MI to be comparable with that associated with co-existing DM [ ], the risk in patients with a previous MI and IGT is further increased, and this condition may have been too advanced to be amenable to correction with alpha-glucosidase inhibitor therapy. In an IGT population with a previous MI, there was no significant difference in the prevalence of revascularization between oral medical alpha-glucose therapy and diet/exercise therapy [ , ]. Oral medical alpha-glucose therapy does not seem to be superior to revascularization in improving prognosis in IGT patients with a previous MI.
Following these discussions to understand the present trial, we need to consider its clinical relevance. Two key issues emanating from the present study are of clinical relevance. The first one is that treatment with voglibose does not decrease cardiovascular events in patients with both IGT and a previous MI, although the risk for recurrent MI in patients with a history of MI is 4–5 times higher than that in patients with no history of MI [ ]. The other is that treatment of IGT in patients with a previous MI using voglibose may not be very effective in improving outcomes. However, this would not necessarily be the case for other alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, which need to be further tested as will be done in the ACE trial [ ]. Nevertheless, we need to treat IGT with alpha-glucosidase inhibitors to prevent the progression to DM.
