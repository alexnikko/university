Introduction
Women with pelvis-abdominal (PA) lump usually present with abnormal menstrual bleeding, pain abdomen, dysmenorrhoea, infertility and other nonspecific sign/symptoms where provisional diagnosis may differ with final histopathological diagnosis. PA lump could occur at any age, though certain pathological entities are more common at certain ages. When an abdominal lump cannot be pinpointed to its site of origin, it requires investigations such as ultrasonography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, fine needle aspiration cytology. But sometimes laparotomy followed by histopathology only gives the final diagnosis. The surgical management of adolescents is menstruation and fertility preserving, whereas in elderly women the inherent risk of malignancy decides the types of surgery.
We conducted this observational study to find out common causes of PA lump in women of different age groups and to analyse clinical presentation and the histopathological finding of the PA lump in the gynaecology department of a referral hospital.
Materials and Methods
This observational study was undertaken in the department of gynaecology and obstetrics for a period of one and a half year in collaboration with department of surgery, pathology and biochemistry. Inclusion criteria were women of 60 years or less, who present with PA lump, which are palpable abdominally and complaining of pain abdomen, menstrual abnormality, infertility, urinary problem and other sign/symptoms related to gynaecology, for which patient needs operation and histopathology reports are available. Woman who are of more than 60 years of age or carrying intrauterine pregnancy or not turned up for operation or histopathology reports either not available or not related to gynaecology and who are not willing to participate in the study were excluded from the study. A total of 216 women presented with PA lump, out of which 68 were selected who fulfil the study criteria during the period. Detailed history of every woman was taken at the outpatient department, immediately after admission and during follow-up visits. Investigations like routine examination of blood, ABO grouping and RH typing, fasting and postprandial blood sugar, serum creatinine, blood urea, liver function test, hepatitis B surface antigen, human immunodeficiency virus rapid test, X ray chest, electrocardiograph, ultrasonography of abdomen and pelvis, and routine and microscopic examination of urine and stool for occult blood were done for every patient. Special tests like serum cancer antigen 125, beta hCG, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were done for particular disease to establish diagnosis and prognosis of the patients. After diagnosis, management was done either by surgery or by surgery with medical therapy. The specimen was sent for histopathological study. It was an observational type of study and entered in MS Excel 2007 software. The results were expressed in terms of simple proportion and number. Association was assessed by means of Chi-square test. For all statistical purposes, p < 0.05 was taken as statistically significant. In some cells, values are <5; thus, Yate’s correction is done.
Results-Of all women presenting with PA lump, 33.82 % were in the age groups of 21–30 years, followed by 31–40 years age (27.94 %), whereas the number of women below 10 years was nil (Table 1 ).

Most of the women with fibromyoma and ovarian tumour were found in the age group of 41–50 years followed by 31–40 and 21–30 years age group (Table 3 ). Whereas histopathological diagnosis of all 26 fibromyoma was uterine myoma, ovarian tumour showed out of 18 tumour 13 were benign and five were malignant, and histopathological findings were serous cyst adenoma ( n = 5), mucinous cyst adenoma ( n = 3), dermoid cyst ( n = 5) and papillary serous cyst adenocarcinoma ( n = 2), mucinous cyst adenocarcinoma ( n = 2),dysgerminoma ( n = 1), respectively. Endometriosis, hydrosalpinx and tubo-ovarian abscess were common in the age group of 21–40 years. Chocolate cyst of ovary was found in all histopathological diagnoses of endometriosis. Histopathological findings of all hydrosalpinx were chronic salpingitis. All chronic ectopic cases were found in the age group of 21–30 years, and histopathological diagnosis was tubal pregnancy. One woman with per-operative diagnosis of pyometra where histopathology showed senile endometritis was in the 51–60 years age group. Tubo-ovarian mass with multiple tubercles was found in a woman, where only omental tissue taken for biopsy and histopathology showed tuberculosis. Two cases of haematocolpos with imperforate hymen were found in the age group of 11–20 years, and the histopathological finding was consistent with the hymenal tissue.

Women with uterine fibromyoma presented with menorrhagia in 50 %, swelling of abdomen in 23.07 %, infertility in 15.38 % and pain abdomen in 11.53 % in the present study (Table 4 ). Patients with ovarian tumour presented with swelling of abdomen in 44.44 % cases, pain abdomen in 27.77 % cases, heaviness in lower abdomen in 16.66 % cases, menstrual irregularity in 5.55 % cases and asymptomatic in 5.55 % cases (Table 4 ). Table 4 Sign/symptom according to the disease entity Disease entity Sign/symptom Uterine fibromyoma Menorrhagia > swelling abdomen > infertility > pain abdomen Ovarian tumour Swelling abdomen > pain abdomen > heaviness > menstrual irregularity > asymptomatic Endometriosis Dysmenorrhoea > infertility > menstrual irregularity > dyspareunia Hydrosalpinx Lower abdomen pain > lump abdomen Tubo-ovarian abscess Lower abdomen pain > menorrhagia Chronic ectopic pregnancy Lower abdomen pain > bleeding per vaginum > amenorrhoea Genital tuberculosis Pain abdomen > lump abdomen Imperforate hymen Cyclical pain abdomen > tender midline mass Pyometra Lump abdomen > fever
Fibroid uterus, ovarian tumour, endometriosis, genital tuberculosis and hydrosalpinx were more common in the women of second para or below, while chronic ectopic and tubo-ovarian abscess did not show any relation with parity. In the present study, majority of the lumps were in the midline (55.88 %), followed by unilateral swelling (29.41 %), bilateral swelling (11.76 %) and generalised swelling with ascites (2.94 %).
The percentage of benign PA lump in the different age groups between 11–60 years was significant when compared with malignant histopathology ( p value = 0.000 in each age group of 11–20, 21–30, 31–40, 41–50 and 51–60 years). Histopathology of PA lump showed that 92.64 % were benign and 7.35 % were malignant ( p value = 0.000) (Table 5 ).

Discussion
A pure gynaecological lump in the lower abdomen which we commonly encounter is ovarian tumour, leiomyoma, adnexal mass, endometriosis, tubo-ovarian mass, hydrosalpinx and ectopic pregnancy. Lump due to surgical and medical causes which mimic a gynaecological lump is tubo-ovarian abscess, genital tuberculosis, appendicular lump and few others like wilms’ tumour or neuroblastoma.
In the present study (Table 1 ), most of the PA lumps (60/68, 88.23 %) were in the age of 21–50 years of women; on the contrary, age below 20 years and above 50 years covers only 11.76 % of cases, challenges the rational approach to diagnose in the majority women and plans for types of operations and further management.
Fibroids and ovarian tumour, benign or malignant, are common causes of pelvic mass in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women [ ]. Fibroids most commonly cause symptoms between 35 and 45 years [ ]. Annual incidence of surgically diagnosed endometriosis to be 1.6 cases per 1000 women aged between 15 and 49 years [ ]. In the present study, the bulk of the patients were due to fibromyoma and ovarian tumour followed by endometriosis (Table 2 ), and different studies and other references also showed the same trend of age and causes of pelvis-abdominal lump [ , , ]. The age incidence of other categories of pelvis-abdominal lump was mainly in the third and fourth decade of life. The average age of the women with chronic ectopic was 28 years in the present study, which is also supported by Westrom et al. [ ] and shows the risk of ectopic pregnancy also increases as the age advances.
The most common initial symptom associated with fibroids and the one the most frequently leads to surgical intervention is menorrhagia. Fibroids may also present with infertility, abdominal mass, pelvic pain, pressure symptoms, spontaneous abortions and other pregnancy-related complications. Our study also showed the similar presentation.
In the present study of PA lump, Table 5 shows 5 cases of malignancy, and in each age group, one case of malignancy was found except the under 10 years age group where the study population was nil. Histopathological analysis showed all were ovarian malignancy. Whereas age groups between 21–50 years of age showed mostly benign ovarian histopathology (13/16, 81.25 %) than malignant histopathology (3/16, 18.75 %), all ovarian tumour (1 out of 1) in each age group of 11–20 years and 51–60 years was found malignant (Table 3 ). No borderline ovarian malignancy was found in our study. Distribution of different types of ovarian tumours in adolescents and children for a period of 8 years showed 23.71 % of total tumour were malignant [ ]. Germ cell tumours make up one-half to two-thirds of ovarian neoplasms in individuals younger than 20 years of age (1). In the present study, histopathology showed dysgerminoma in the age group of 11–20 years. The incidence of ovarian malignancy in childhood or adolescents and in the postmenopausal women varies maybe because of less number of cases in this age group of the present study. Early detection relies on finding of pelvis-abdominal lump on physical examination. One woman with histopathological diagnosis of papillary serous cyst adenocarcinoma presented with right iliac fossa firm mass and postmenopausal bleeding. Pain abdomen, amenorrhoea and 16 weeks size firm irregular mass per abdomen were the presenting sign/symptoms of dysgerminoma. Swelling abdomen, pain and ascites were found in other three cases of ovarian malignancy of mucinous cyst adenocarcinoma and papillary serous cyst adenocarcinoma. Ultrasonography findings of all five cases of ovarian malignancy showed adnexal mass, solid or cystic in nature. In our study, all ovarian malignancy had raised serum CA-125 level.
Endometriosis is a common gynaecologic condition that affects 5–15 % of reproductive age women and up to 3–5 % of postmenopausal women [ ]. Endometriosis should be suspected in women with subfertility, dysmenorrhoea, dyspareunia or chronic pelvic pain. Endometriosis may also present with irregular menstruation and unusual abdomino-pelvic or adnexal mass. Table 4 shows the sign/symptom in endometriosis in our study. Serial CA-125 determination may be useful to predict the recurrence of endometriosis after therapy.
Chronic ectopic pregnancy significantly increases during the past two decades. In a clinical study of 305 cases of ectopic pregnancies, Ugur et al. [ ] showed that the incidence of chronic ectopic pregnancy was 20.3 %. It is difficult to diagnose a case of chronic ectopic pregnancy causing abdominal lump, as it does not always present with classical picture. The hCG level is low. The clinical symptom triad of ectopic pregnancy, i.e. pain, amenorrhoea and vaginal bleeding, is present in only 50 % of patients. Table 4 shows the sign/symptom of chronic ectopic pregnancy.
It was in the middle of the eighteenth century that tuberculous gynaecological manifestations received attention when Morgagni (the famous morbid anatomist) described the signs of genital tuberculosis in women. Of all gynaecological admissions, 0.2–2 % are due to tuberculosis. It is chiefly a disease of young age, mostly falling between 20 and 40 years of age [ ], and our study also is shown in this (Table 3 ). The most common complaints are pelvic pain, generalised malaise, menstrual irregularity, abdomino-pelvic lump and sometimes with features of intestinal obstruction. Treatment is essentially medical. Surgery is reserved for special situation like persistence of substantial pelvic mass after adequate antitubercular drug therapy.
Tubo-ovarian mass is a clinical syndrome attributed to ascending spread of infection from vagina to endometrium, fallopian tubes and/or connective structures. Patients most likely to develop tubo-ovarian abscess are women of 30–40 years of age with long-standing or recurrent salpingitis. The management of patients with tubo-ovarian abscess may be medical or combined with surgery [ ].
Although a benign condition, hydrosalpinx puts us in problem on occasions in our day-to-day practice. It often remains unrecognized unless a symptom or complication in the form of pelvic pain, huge enlargement, torsion, rupture or infertility develops from this condition.
The absence of communicating channel with functional endometrium will present at adolescence with primary amenorrhoea (cryptomenorrhoea), cyclical lower abdominal pain with or without progressively increasing hypogastric lump and/ or acute retention of urine. When vaginal septa, uterine septa, uterine duplication or vaginal agenesis is suspected, MRI can be helpful in delineating anatomic abnormalities [ ]. CT scanning may be helpful in detecting nongenital intra-abdominal abnormalities and in planning treatment when a malignancy of PA lump is strongly suspected.
Table 5 shows the percentage of benign PA lump in the different age groups between 11–60 years was significant when compared with malignant histopathology. The percentage of ovarian tumour with benign histopathology (13/18, 72.22 %) was more than malignant histology (5/18, 27.77 %) in our study, and it was statistically significant ( p value = 0.020).
The histopathological nature of PA lump showed it was benign histopathology which was more than malignant histopathology (63/68, 92.64 vs. 5/68, 7.35 %) and it was statistically significant ( p value = 0.000).
Total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was the major operation performed in the present study. Infracolic omentectomy was done where it was necessary. Chronic ectopic pregnancy was treated surgically with removal of affected tube. One per-operative case of pyometra was treated with total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Major post-operative complications were abdominal distention with paralytic ileus, urinary tract infections, wound infection, fever and shock. One woman died in 1st post-operative day, and histopathological finding was ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma.
Conclusions
Most of the PA lumps of women were due to uterine fibromyoma followed by ovarian tumour and endometriosis. Benign ovarian tumour was common in the age group of 21–50 years, whereas all ovarian tumours in the age group of 11–20 and 51–60 years were malignant. Early detection of PA lump relies on history and physical examination. Pain and lump abdomen were common clinical symptom and sign in ovarian malignancy. Abdominally palpable PA lump can be planned for operation and post-operative care in the gynaecology department of a hospital with counselling that a small percentage of women will have gynaecologic malignancy, and thus, majority of women of 60 years or less with PA lump can be assured of benign gynaecologic condition and prognosis of the disease.
