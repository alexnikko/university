Introduction
Primary immunodeficiencies are an extremely heterogeneous group of disorders generally inherited by Mendelian pattern. Lipopolysaccharide-responsive beige-like anchor protein ( LRBA ) deficiency was seperately discovered by two different groups in 2012 [ , ]. According to the recent reports, LRBA defects have been suggested to be one of the most common autosomal recessive defects causing common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) [ ], and it is also shown to be responsible from autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS)-like (ALPS-like) disease [ ].
LRBA molecule has a role in regulating cell surface expression of CTLA-4 [ ]. As CTLA-4 is a checkpoint inhibitor of T cell function, LRBA deficiency is associated especially with the loss of regulatory T cell (Treg) function. Autoimmune cytopenia and early-onset and persistant diarrhea are among the leading manifestations [ , , ]. It causes a highly variable disease, “LRBA deficiency with autoantibodies, Treg defects, autoimmune infiltration, and enteropathy” (LATAIE) disease [ ].
Immunologic abnormalities reported in LRBA-deficient patients have included deficient T cell activation/proliferation, increased circulating follicular helper T cells [ ], defects in specific antibody response, decreased IgG antibody production, decreased autophagy, and increased apoptosis in B lymphocytes [ ]. The majority of LRBA-deficient patients have low switched memory B cells and plasmablasts [ , ].
As ALPS-like or CVID-like presentation is commonly seen in patients with LRBA deficiency, the aim was to evaluate and compare patients with LRBA-ALPS and LRBA-CVID and prepare an algorithm to ease the diagnosis and follow-up of the patients with LRBA. We performed LRBA gene sequencing and protein studies in the patients with “probable ALPS” and CVID.
Patients and Methods
Patients
Fifteen LRBA-deficient patients from 14 families diagnosed and followed up with the diagnosis of CVID and possible ALPS between years 2012 and 2019 in Hacettepe University Immunology unit were enrolled into the study. One homozygous LRBA defective 16-year-old female patient was excluded as LRBA and CTLA-4 expressions were found to be normal in FACS analysis.
The patients were defined in cohorts of CVID (Project number GO13/228 and GO15/370) and ALPS (probable ALPS) (Project number GO13/265 and GO11/19-23) patients.
The criteria of probable ALPS in the study of Oliviera et al. were fulfilled in for the patients with ALPS [ ].
Methods
Flow Cytometry
Lymphocytes
The analysis of peripheral blood lymphocyte populations was performed by 6-color flow cytometry (Attune NxT, Thermo Fisher, USA), using 100 μl of whole blood stained with 20 μl of monoclonal antibodies with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), phycoerythrin (PE), allophycocyanin (APC), or peridinin–chlorophyl–protein (PerCP)) against T and B subset markers (obtained from eBioscience, Thermo Fisher, USA) and incubated in the dark for 15 min at room temperature. For lymphocyte analysis, CD3(FITC), CD4(FITC), CD8(PE), CD16 + 56(PE), and CD19(PE) were used and for T and B lymphocyte subgroup analysis, CD4(FITC), CCR7(PE), CD31(PE), CD45RA (APC), and CD8(PerCP) (Beckton Dickinson, BD, USA) were used.
Flow Cytometric Analysis of LRBA Protein
PBMCs or activated T cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained as previously described [ ]. In brief, cells were fixed and permeabilized using eBioscience Foxp3 staining kit, stained with anti-LRBA (Sigma) antibodies followed by anti-rabbit fluorophore conjugated secondaries, and then analyzed by flow cytometry.
Flow Cytometric Analysis of Tfh and Treg Cells
This analysis [ ] was performed for two (P8, PX) of the patients. PBMCs were surface stained for CXCR5 and PD-1, then washed, fixed, and permeabilized using eBioscience Foxp3 staining kit. Cells were then stained with antibodies for CD4, CTLA-4, CD45RA, and FoxP3. Tfh cells were gated as CD4 + CXCR5 + PD-1 + . Treg were gated as CD4 + Foxp3 + and assessed for CTLA-4 expression. Fixed and permeabilized PBMCs were also stained for CD4, CD25, and FoxP3 to assess CD25 expression on Tregs.
CTLA-4 Level Analysis
Total CTLA-4 levels were assessed in CD4 + Foxp3 + T cells by intracellular staining.
Western Blot Analysis
Some patients are analyzed first for presence of LRBA protein. Mononuclear cells were isolated from peripheral blood using density gradient centrifugation (Capricorn Scientific, Germany). The cells lysed using 1× cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technologies, USA) including 1 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride and centrifuged 13.000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. Protein samples were separated using 6% stacking and 9% resolving gel at 150 V for 1 h. The separated protein samples were tranferred to PVDF (polyinylidene difluoride) membrane using wet transfer system (Promega, USA) at 230 V for 3 h in chilled conditions. Following transfer, membrane was blocked with 5% skimmed milk in phosphate buffer saline including 1% Tween-20 (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). Protein bands were treated with WesternBright ECL (Advansta, UK) and visualized by GeneGnome XRQ (Syngene, UK).
Rabbit LRBA antibody (#HPA023597) was from Sigma-Aldrich (USA), and anti-rabbit secondary antibody (#7074) was from Cell Signaling Technologies (USA).
Genetic Analysis
Whole Exome Sequencing
WES was performed for 8 patients (P1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9) [ ].
Targeted PID Panel Screening
HaloPlexTM probes which were designed to capture 356 PID-related genes (P4, 11, 14) were used as described in the reference [ ].
A few CVID patients (P8, 10, 13, 15) were diagnosed by screening another PID gene panel [ ].
All patients were Sanger sequenced after NGS-based gene panel screening.
Sanger Sequencing
Genomic DNA was extracted from 200 μl of blood using the QIamp DNA Blood Kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. PCR reactions were carried out in 100 μl reaction volume containing 50 ng of DNA, buffer 10X, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 2.5 U AmpliTaq Gold (Applied Biosystems), and 50 pmol of primers designed to amplify all LRBA coding exons (Supplementary Table 1 ). PCR conditions were as follows: a denaturation step at 95 °C for 5 min; 5 cycles 35 cycles at 95 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for 1 min and 72 °C for 1 min, and a final extension step at 72 °C for 10 min. PCR products were directly sequenced using the appropriate primers and BigDye® Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kits (Applied Biosystems). The products were loaded on a 3130 Genetic Analyzer, and the results were analyzed with Sequencing Analysis v.5.2 software.
Results
Patients’ Characteristics
There were 15 patients from 13 families (Table 1 ). Female/male ratio was 6/9, and parental consanguinity ratio was 14/15 (92.86%). The median age on admission was 7 years (0.3–16.5). The median age of diagnosis was 11 years (5–44). There was no difference between the age on admission of patients with LRBA-ALPS and LRBA-CVID ( p > 0.05).

Seven patients (P1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 14) (50%) were diagnosed among the group of 14 patients with ALPS (Fig. 1 ). They all fit “probable ALPS” criteria [ ] (Table 2 ); however, no FAS , FASL , and caspase 10 mutations were found [ ]. Fig. 1 Some of the patients initially followed with the diagnosis of ALPS and CVID were found to have LRBA defect
P3 and P7 were sisters of P2 and P6 respectively.
Eight patients (P3, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15) (25.8%) were diagnosed among the group of 31 patients with CVID presenting with autoimmune diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, and lymphoproliferation.
Diagnostic Characteristics
WES is needed in 5/7 (71.4%) of ALPS-LRBA and 1/7 (14.3%) of CVID-LRBA patients.
Clinical Characteristics
Infectious Diseases
Recurrent upper (14/15, 93.3%) and lower (8/15, 53.3%) respiratory infections were common in the patients. CMV pneumonia was seen in P12 and P14.
BK virus (10 6 copy/ml) was isolated from urine and blood by PCR during the analysis of nephropathy in P8. However, it could not be documented in renal biopsy specimen. Cidofovir therapy was planned, but the urine BK viral load gradually declined during intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy. Reactivation of BK virus while under immunosuppressives was recorded in P8 after HSCT.
Lymphoproliferative and Malignant Diseases
Splenomegaly was seen in nearly all patients (14/15, 93.3%). Splenectomy was performed for 3 of them, because of hypersplenism. Lymphoma was the most common malignancy recorded in 4/15 (26.6%) patients (P5, 8, 10, 13); in three patients, non-Hodgkin (follicular) lymphoma (1), B cell lymphoma (2), and in one Hodgkin lymphoma (lymphocyte-rich) were noted. Gastric adenocarcinoma occurred in P9. Histiocytosis was documented in P14. All have taken steroids intermittantly before they got the diagnosis of malignancy. Rituximab was included in the chemotherapy regimens of some of the patients.
Gastrointestinal Manifestations
Chronic diarrhea was a common symptom. It was recorded in 8/15 (53.3%) of the patients. Five (P2, 4, 8, 9, 12, 15) were diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease. Endoscopic colon biopsy from P12 revealed CMV colitis. Two patients were diagnosed with celiac disease (P8, 9).
In three patients (P2, 4, 12), the diarrhea was so severe that it caused electrolyte imbalance (hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia) and hypovolemic shock. Two relatives of P12 who had IBD-like symptoms were also evaluated and lost at a different center. The cousin of P14 was also evaluated for IBD in another center. P9 had intramucosal adenocarcinoma developed in the basis of tubulovillous adenoma.
Autoimmune Diseases
Autoimmune cytopenia (autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AHA) and immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)) was frequent (6/15 and 11/15 respectively). Evans syndrome was present in 26.6% (4/15) patients. Autoimmune thyroiditis was seen in 20% (3/15) of the patients. Anti-thyroid peroxidase, anti-thyroglobulin, and anti-TSH antibodies were in high levels in P2, P4, and P14.
Immunophenotypic Analysis Results
Lymphopenia was present in 30% (5/15) of the patients. A total of 4/15 (26.6%) had intermittant neutropenia and eosinophilia each (Supplementary Table 2 ).
66.6% (10/15) of the patients had low IgA, 40% (6/15) had low IgG, and 26.6% (4/15) had low IgM. IgG Levels progressively decreased in the patients initially diagnosed with probable ALPS
According to flow cytometric analysis, T cell numbers were low in 53.3% (8/15), and CD4 + T cell numbers were low in 40% (6/15) of the patients. B cell percentage and numbers were low in 9 out of 15 (60%) of the patients (Supplementary Table 2 ). B cell percentage and numbers progressively decreased in the patients initially diagnosed with probable ALPS.
Double-negative T cells (TCRαβ + CD4 − CD8 − ) were measured in 11 out of 15 patients. Eight out of 11 (72.7%) were elevated (> 1.5%) [ ].
T and B cell subgroups were evaluated in 6 and 4 patients respectively (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4 ). Decreased naive and recent thymic emigrant (RTE) Th cells and markedly increased effector memory and effector memory RA + Th cells (TEMRA Th) were documented. Normal naive B cells, but decreased switched memory B cells, were documented.
LRBA expression was low in P8 and P14 (Fig. 2a and c ). P8 had low CTLA-4 and CD25 expression on Foxp3 + cells, compared to controls (Fig. 2a ). P8 had a large PD-1 + population, predominant memory T cells (CD4 + CD45RA − ), and significantly more Tfh cells (CD4 + CXCR5 + PD1 + ) (Fig. 2b ). P14 had low CTLA-4 expression (Fig. 2c ). Fig. 2 Functional tests for LRBA defects . a Low LRBA, CTLA-4 and CD25 expression of CD4 + FoxP3 + T cells in P8 compared to healthy donor (HD). b More memory (CD45RA − ) CD4 + T cells are present, and T follicular helper (CD4 + CXCR5 + PD-1 + ) cells are increased in P8 (CD4 + gated cells are shown), compared to HD. c Low LRBA and CTLA-4 expression of CD4 + FoxP3 + T cells in P14, compared to HD1 and HD2. d Western Blotting: No LRBA protein is seen in P8 and P14 compared to healthy donor. e Western Blotting: LRBA protein in P4 before and after HSCT
Western Blot Analysis Results
Western blot (WB) analysis was performed for patients with CVID. The analysis was performed also for patients who were found to have LRBA mutations by WES or PID panel NGS techniques. In total, eight patients (P4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14) were evaluated with WB analysis; all but P13 had no LRBA protein expression. This result would need to be repeated in case of sample error. However, the test could not be repeated as P13 has died.
Some of the donors were also assessed for LRBA protein expression by WB. They were found to express LRBA. In addition, post-transplant LRBA protein expression was shown by WB in two patients (P4 and P12). Figure 2d shows the result for P8 and P14. Figure 2e shows LRBA protein expression after HSCT.
Gene Defects in Patients
Seven (P1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9), eight (P4, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15), and one patients (P12) were diagnosed with the help of WES, PID gene panel screening, and Sanger sequencing respectively (Table 3 ) (Fig. 3 ). The defects diagnosed by WES and PID gene panel screening were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Fig. 3 LRBA protein map that illustrates its possible multidomain sites. ConA conconavalin A-like lectin/gluconase domain, DUF domain of unknown functions 4704, A type Armadillo type fold, PH PH domain associated with Beige/BEACH, BEACH Beige and Chediak Higashi, YVTN WD40/YVTN repeat–like containing domain (The figure is drawn by the help of Ensemble, PFAM, Gen3D, superfamily, SMART databases.)
One patient (P1) had compound heterozygous mutations, and the others had homozygous defects. P3 was asymptomatic although her brother (P2) with the same homozygous defect was severely affected. All of the defects are confirmed to be inherited from the parents. All the defects found by various analyses were consistent with the clinical phenotype of the patients.
Genotype–Phenotype Correlation
Genotype and phenotype correlation was not clear in our cohort. P4 and P12 who had severe gastrointestinal features had frameshift defects affecting the DUF1088 domain. However, P2 who had an early N-terminal mutation also had severe inflammatory bowel disease-like symptoms. The sister of P2 and P3 did not have any symptoms despite having the same defect. P13 and 14 had mutations leading to a stop codon before the ConA domain. P13 had CVID-like features, whereas P14 had ALPS-like features. P1, P6, P7, and P8, who had defects affecting the BEACH domain, had presented with cytopenia and splenomegaly.
Therapeutic Approach
All the patients were given monthly IVIG and prophylactic antibacterial therapy after molecular diagnosis.
Immunomodulatory Therapies
Steroids, cyclosporin A, mycophenolate mofetile, and IVIG (2 g/kg) were commonly used therapies given during severe, recurrent and relapsing autoimmune cytopenia, and inflammatory bowel disease. Eleven patients (P1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15) were given anti-CTLA-4 antibody (abatacept) therapy. P12 experienced a severe pneumonia with pleural effusion and respiratory distress after the therapy was started; so, the therapy was stopped. The others benefited from the therapy. None developed malignancy during or after abatacept therapy.
Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation
Seven (P2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12) out of fifteen patients (46.6%) (4/7 (57.1%) of ALPS-LRBA and 3/8 (37.5%) of CVID-LRBA patients) were treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from their HLA-compatible family donors (Table 4 ). HSCT was performed to six of them in Hacettepe University. Five (P2, 4, 6, 10, 14) were children, and two (P8, 9) were adults; P2 was transplanted in a different center [].
P4, 6, and 10 were given busulfan 0.8 mg/kg (2 days intravenous (iv)), fludarabine (160 mg/m 2 6 days and iv.), and ATG-Fresenius infusion (30 mg/kg for 2 days iv). In addition, methotrexate (10 mg/m 2 day 1 and 5 mg/m 2 on days 3, 6, 11 iv) and cyclosporine 3 mg/kg (iv) were used as GvHD prophylaxis. As P14 had severe chronic pulmonary symptoms, he was given melphalan (140 mg/m 2 (2 days intravenous (iv)), fludarabine (50 mg/m 2 6 days and iv.), and ATG-Fresenius infusion (5 mg/kg for 2 days iv) as reduced intensity regimen.
Among two adult patients, P8 and P9 were given busulfan 0.8 mg/kg 2 days, fludarabine 50 mg/m 2 6 days, and IV ATG-Fresenius infusion 5 mg/kg for 2 days. In addition, IV methotrexate 10 mg/m 2 day 1 and 5 mg/m 2 on days 3, 6, 11 and cyclosporine 3 mg/kg IV infusion were used as GvHD prophylaxis. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (po), valacyclovir (po, 1000 mg, 3 times daily), fluconazole (400 mg/day), and levofloxacine (500 mg/day) were used for antibiotic prophylaxis. Patients 8 and 9 tolerated the conditioning regimen well with no major complications. Post-transplant neutrophil and thrombocyte engraftment were at days 11 and 12–13 respectively in P8 and P9 respectively. Near full donor chimerism was achieved in post-transplant period in P8 (97%) and P9 (94%) respectively.
Four out of seven patients (P2, P4, P8, P9) were given abatacept therapy during HSCT therapy and 3–6 months after HSCT. P4 had persistant thrombocytopenia after HSCT for about 6 months and needed eltrombopag therapy. He is now well without any complication of autoimmune cytopenia.
Outcome
Seven patients that were transplanted are alive and well after HSCT (median 2 years (1-3). P4 had persistant thrombocytopenia during the first 6 months of HSCT and P8 had pulmonary GVHD, needed immunossuppressive therapy, and had intermittant BK virus reactivation before and after HSCT, which responded IVIG therapy. P2 and P6 had acute GVHD which resolved in the first year. P9 and P12 are well without major complication. P10 will be transplanted from his HLA full-matched father after the lymphoma chemotherapy. Others are well under immunomodulatory therapies.
Discussion
LRBA molecule regulates CTLA-4 expression [ ], which is a potent inhibitory molecule expressed by activated T cells and regulatory T cells. It blocks co-stimulation/proliferation of the T cells and regulates immune responses [ ]. Low expression of CTLA-4, FoxP3, and CD25 in LRBA deficiency results in partial loss of the regulatory effects on T cell activation, leading to increased, but inappropriate activation of T and B cells and defect in immune surveillance leading to increased cancer risk and autoimmunity [ , ].
In this study, it was interesting to identify out patients with LRBA defects both in ALPS and CVID patient cohorts. So, the criteria of ALPS should be revised to exclude the genetic defects, such as LRBA deficiency and CTLA-4 deficiency. Elevated DNT cells in LRBA defect [ ] (8/10 patients in our study) and autoimmune/inflammatory diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus or juvenile idiopathic arthritis [ ], are considerable.
Splenomegaly and malignancy ratio was also high in this cohort. Malignancy risk is known to be increased in PIDD, and its incidence is the second-highest cause of death after infection [ ]. The vast majority of lymphomas reported in PIDD are B cell lymphomas [ ]. In this cohort, the ratio was 26.6% and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, and gastric adenocarcinoma were noted in patients respectively. We do not know the relation of the steroid use and malignancy. However, most of the patients used steroids for recurrent autoimmune cytopenia and IBD-like disease before the development of malignancy. There is no patient identified among these patients having malignancy that may be related with or secondary to abatacept therapy.
Totally, 78.6% of the patients presented with autoimmune cytopenia, and 26.6% had Evans syndrome. Two (14.3%) had autoimmune thyroiditis. Other autoimmune/inflammatory features associated with LRBA deficiency are juvenile idiopathic arthritis [ ], type I diabetes, erosive polyarthritis, autoimmune thyroiditis, AHA, and ITP [ ]. Johnson et al. identified 4 patients with LRBA mutations having neonatal diabetes [] as in IPEX syndrome.
Autoimmune enteropathy, celiac disease, and IBD-like disease are common in the course of LRBA deficiency. Gastrointestinal pathologies may include subtotal or partial villous atrophy, or be completely normal [ ]. IVIG replacement is generally insufficient to control the diarrhea. So far, corticosteroids, empirical antibiotic treatments, gluten-free diet, and various immunosuppressive agents (azathiopurin 6-mercaptopurine, tacrolimus, infliximab, rituximab, etc.) have been tried [ ]. In recent publications, sirolimus was reported to be successfully used for enteropathy in patients with LRBA deficiency and to provide clinical remission and weight gain in the patients [ ]. In our cohort, half of the patients presented with IBD-like symptoms, and steroids, acetyl salicylic acid, and cyclosporin A were given to control the severe symptoms.
Interestingly, endoscopic biopsy from P12 revealed CMV colitis. BK virus was isolated from urine during nephropathy in P8. BK virus–related urinary problems are usually seen in transplanted, HIV positive patients, and patients under immunosuppressive therapy [ ]. Thus, the patients with chronic diarrhea, severe resistant cytopenia, and severe viral infections should be transplanted urgently, if they have matched donor. Respiratory complications, such as atelectasia, bronchiectasis, and pulmonary nodules, are commonly seen in patients with LRBA deficiency [ ]. Thus, reduced intensity conditioning regimens are preferred during HSCT procedure.
Investigation at both the genetic and protein levels should be the aim for proper evaluation and diagnosis. Analysis of protein either by WB or by flow cytometry is required especially in cases where missense LRBA variants of unknown significance are detected. Nearly all reported LRBA patients thus far have impaired LRBA expression [ ]. There are sometimes technical problems during WB analysis, since the large LRBA protein appears to easily degradate during sample lysate preparation. Repeating tests with positive/negative control samples may help during the analysis. Patient 13 was found to have normal protein. It was seen later that the P13’s mutation was reported to associate with loss of LRBA in WB study [ ]. We thought that this may be due to the binding site of the monoclonal antibody. However, measurement of CTLA-4 levels could not be done as she died.
LRBA-deficient B cells show defective activation/survival [ ]. Flow cytometry reveals reduced B cell numbers [ ], and reduction of IgG + and IgA + CD27 + switched memory B cells in symptomatic patients. Patients have low CD4 + CD45RA + naive T cells, while the percentage of naive CD8 T cells is normal. Treg cell deficiency in LRBA is associated with dysregulated T cell activation and skewing toward a memory phenotype. T cell subgroups shows decreased recent thymic emigrants but increased TEMRA cells [ ]. In the present study, progressive decrease in B cells and IgG levels was seen during follow-up of patients, especially those initially diagnosed as probable ALPS. B cell subgroups showed normal naive B cells but decreased switched memory B cells. T cell subgroups showed decreased naive Th cells, RTE Th cells, markedly increased CD4 + effector memory cells, and increased TEMRA Th cells. P8 and P14 showed low CTLA-4 and CD25 expression on Foxp3 + cells compared with control. In P8, a large PD-1 + population, increased memory, and enlarged Tfh population in the CD4 + T cell compartment were recorded.
All but one patient had homozygous defects consistent with high rate of consanguinity. Compound heterozygous defect in one may be indicative of high frequency of LRBA gene heterozygosity in our country. We documented ten novel defects (Table 3 ). Among several domains (Fig. 3 ), BEACH and DUF1088 domains are the most frequently affected domains in this cohort. These are shared with another ‘Beige and Chediak Higashi’ (BEACH) domain containing protein (BDCP) and neurobeachins (NBEA). BDCPs are generally related to lysosome size, apoptosis, autophagy, granule size, or synapse formation []. NBEA are known to be localized near Golgi apparatus and have important roles in vesicular trafficking, intracellular transport, membrane dynamics, endosomal recycling, and receptor signaling [ ]. Common two domains seem to indicate common structure/function of the LRBA and NBEA (Fig. 4 ). Fig. 4 Algorithm for the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with LRBA defect
Although the brother with the same homozygous defect was severely affected, P3 was asymptomatic. The incomplete penetrance is not reported for LATAIE disease, unlike for CTLA-4 haploinsufficiency [ ]. There may be modifying genes, or exposomal effects, possibly in the healthy sister, or the symptoms will appear in the following years.
Before the molecular diagnosis, steroids, cyclosporin A, and mycophenolate mofetile were used with partial success in patients with autoimmune/lymphoproliferative manifestations. Abatacept was helpful in the patients; however, one patient had severe infectious episode (with severe respiratory distress) at the beginning of the therapy. The follow-up of the patients with LRBA deficiency is challenging even after abatacept and HSCT. Azizi et al. reported that sirolimus led to the improvement in the control of the diarrhea in four patients with LRBA deficiency [ ]. Some of the patients were reported to have autoimmune clinical features also after HSCT [ ]. In P4, autoimmune thrombocytopenia continued after HSCT. In addition to abatacept, he needed eltrombopag during an episode of thrombocytopenia.
Analysis of protein either by WB or by flow cytometry has prime importance in the diagnosis. The patients with LRBA deficiency having normal LRBA expression possibly have low CTLA-4 levels. So, it is important to do surface staining for CTLA-4.
In this study, we have evaluated the LATAIE patients who were diagnosed among two different cohorts of CVID and ALPS patients and prepared an algorithm to ease the diagnosis and follow-up of the patients with LRBA deficiency (Table 4 ). In the ALPS cohort, it was very interesting to see that nearly half of the patients were found to be LRBA defective. CD19 and immunoglobulins progressively decreased during the follow-up of most of the patients with the initial diagnosis of probable ALPS. Since LRBA deficiency has only been defined relatively recently and because of the diversity of the clinical features, there is a diagnostic delay in some of the patients similar to other PID cases [ ]. Next-generation sequencing aids in the diagnosis.
