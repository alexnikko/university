Introduction
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the third most common malignancy of the urogenital system, accounting for 85% of malignant kidney tumors [ ]. The incidence of RCC has increased steadily in the last four decades and currently accounts for 3–6% of all adult malignancies [ ]. The dismal prevalence of RCC underscores the need for outcome prediction models to counsel patients, select individualized treatment, and design surveillance programs, especially after surgery [ ]. Similar to other malignancies, RCC shows significant clinical heterogeneity, ranging from indolent to highly aggressive forms [ ]. Many clinical and histologic factors, including TNM stage, nuclear grade, and histologic type, have prognostic implications for RCC [ , ]. In addition, several metabolic syndrome components and comorbidity indices have been investigated as risk factors and potential prognostic factors in RCC. There is evidence correlating diabetes mellitus (DM) with an increased risk of RCC, and recent epidemiological studies show that DM is independently associated with decreased recurrence-free survival (RFS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (OS) in patients with surgically treated RCC [ , ]. Although overweight and obesity are established risk factors for RCC, paradoxically a growing body of evidence suggests that high body mass index (BMI) is significantly associated with favorable OS, CSS, and RFS in patients with RCC [ , ]. The role of hypertension as an independent prognostic marker in RCC has not been demonstrated conclusively, whereas tyrosine kinase inhibitor-associated hypertension may be a strong predictive marker of treatment efficacy in metastatic RCC [ ].
Dyslipidemia, a component of metabolic syndrome, has recently been identified as a potential risk factor and prognostic factor for RCC. Experimental evidence suggests that deregulated cholesterol and lipid biosynthesis plays an important role in the development of RCC [ ]. A matched case–control study showed that high levels of serum total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol are associated with a decreased risk of RCC [ ]. However, few studies to date have directly addressed the association between serum TC level and the oncologic outcome of RCC patients. Two studies have reported the clinical implications of preoperative serum TC in patients with surgically treated RCC, but the study population of each study was small, and a comprehensive systematic review of this association is lacking [ , ]. In addition, metabolic syndrome is a systemic disorder that is linked to each component and has certain common pathologic features, and potential confounders should be controlled [ ].
In the study reported here, we analyzed a large multicenter cohort of 3064 patients with surgically treated RCC to elucidate the prognostic implications of preoperative serum TC on RFS in localized RCC or CSS in the entire cohort and after classification by histologic type and disease stage.
Materials and methods
A database of 7047 patients with RCC who were treated surgically between January 1999 and December 2015 at eight academic centers was retrospectively reviewed. Approval for the study was obtained from the relevant institutional review boards of the eight participating centers. Patient clinicopathologic characteristics were obtained from the database and included age at operation, gender, BMI, metabolic syndrome components (diabetes and hypertension), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, surgical approach (open vs. laparoscopic), clinical tumor characteristics [tumor location and size and clinical TNM (cTMN) stage], tumor pathology [tumor size, pathologic TN (pTN) stage, Fuhrman nuclear grade, histologic subtype, lymphovascular invasion, and surgical margin status], disease recurrence and site of recurrence (local or metastatic), and information on deaths and their causes [ ]. Patients had to fulfill the following requirements to be enrolled in the study: (1) primary RCC, (2) availability of preoperative serum TC data obtained from fasting blood samples, and (3) data of other metabolic syndrome components, such as BMI, hypertension, and diabetes. Patients with an incomplete dataset and those with non-RCC pathology or pediatric RCC patients younger than 18 years were excluded; the final study group comprised 3064 patients.
The surgical procedures were performed by skilled surgeons using standard techniques. All surgical specimens were processed according to the standard pathologic procedures at each institution. Pathologic staging was performed based on the 7th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer classification system, and histologic differentiation was graded according to the Fuhrman nuclear grading system [ , ]. After surgery, each patient was monitored according to standard guidelines. Disease recurrence was defined as locoregional recurrence or newly identified distant metastasis based on clinical and radiographic findings. Deaths were determined by reviewing medical records and/or confirmed by interview with the family of the patient. RFS was defined as the period between surgery and the detection of recurrence or distant metastasis. Time to CCS was calculated as the time from surgery to the date of cancer-attributable mortality.
Summary statistics for continuous variables were presented as the mean ± standard deviation. The differences in preoperative serum TC according to pathologic variables were assessed using the Mann–Whitney U test or Kruskall Wallis test. Correlations between continuous variables were assessed using Spearman’s rank correlation analysis with coefficients ( ρ ). For the survival analysis, preoperative serum TC level was classified according to quartiles, and nested subcohorts with the lowest quartile (<156 mg/dL) were assigned to the reference group. The Kaplan–Meier method was used to estimate time to recurrence and cancer-specific death, and differences were assessed using the log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were performed using the Cox proportional hazard regression model. Differences were considered significant at P < 0.05, and all reported P values were two-sided. Analyses were performed using SPSS version 20.0 software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY).

Results
Baseline characteristics of patients
Table 1 lists the demographic and clinical features of the 3064 enrolled patients with surgically treated RCC. The mean age at diagnosis was 55.80 years, and the mean preoperative TC level was 181.97 ± 38.96 mg/dL. The prevalence of diabetes and hypertension was 14.6 and 33.2%, respectively. Preoperative TC level showed little correlation with age and BMI (Spearman’s ρ = −0.097 and 0.137, respectively; P < 0.001 each).

Association between preoperative serum TC level and operative/pathologic variables
Patients who underwent radical nephrectomy and open surgery had lower preoperative TC levels than those who underwent laparoscopic and nephron-sparing surgery ( P < 0.001 each). In terms of pathologic features, low serum TC level was associated with aggressive tumor characteristics, such as large tumor size, advanced stage, high nuclear grade, lymph node involvement, and sarcomatous differentiation (all P < 0.001). Patients with minor histologic subtypes, such as collecting duct, multilocular cystic RCC, and Xp11.2 translocation RCC, had lower preoperative TC levels than those with major histologic subtypes, such as clear cell, papillary and chromophobe RCC (all P < 0.001). No differences in serum TC level were observed between major histologic subtypes (Table 2 ).

Effect of preoperative serum TC level on survival in patients with surgically treated RCC
A total of 2992 patients (97.7%) who were followed for ≥6 months (median 37.0 months, range 6–178 months) were included in the survival analyses. The association between preoperative serum TC level and RFS was assessed in 1349 patients with pathologically localized disease (T1–3N0M0). Recurrences were observed in 67 of 1084 patients (6.2%) with pT1 disease and in 70 of 265 patients (26.4%) with pT2–3 disease. Kaplan–Meier analysis showed that patients with high cholesterol levels had a longer RFS than those with low cholesterol ( P = 0.012) (Fig. 1 a). After stratification by disease stage and histologic subtype, significant differences in RFS were detected in patients with pT2–3 diseases and chromophobe RCC ( P = 0.018 and P = 0.003, respectively) (Fig. 1 c, f). Preoperative serum TC level as a continuous or categorical variable was associated with poor RFS on univariate analysis, whereas it was not a significant factor on multivariate analysis (data not shown). Fig. 1 Kaplan–Meier survival curves of recurrence-free survival in the total cohort ( a ) and in the cohort stratified by disease stage [T1 ( b ), T2–3 ( c )] and by histologic subtype [clear cell ( d ), papillary ( e ), chromophobe subtype ( f )] according to preoperative total cholesterol ( TC ) level in patients with surgically treated renal cell carcinoma
During the median postoperative follow-up of 37.0 months, 248 (8.1%) patients died from RCC. Low preoperative serum TC level was associated with poor CSS in the entire cohort ( P < 0.001) (Fig. 2 a). After stratification by disease stage and histologic subtype, the effect of preoperative serum TC level on CSS was limited to pT1 and clear cell RCC, respectively (both P < 0.001) (Fig. 2 b, e). Multivariate Cox regression analysis including significant factors from the univariate analysis showed that age, BMI, the presence of diabetes, advanced stage, Fuhrman grade, and preoperative serum TC level as continuous [hazard ratio (HR) 0.993; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.988–0.998; P = 0.008] or categorical variables (HR 1.657; 95% CI 1.143–2.401; P = 0.008) were independent predictors of CSS (Table 3 ).

Discussion
We have assessed the prognostic role of preoperative serum TC level in patients with surgically treated RCC from a large, multi-institutional Korean collaboration. The results indicate that low preoperative serum TC level is closely related to aggressive pathologic features and poor CSS.
The impact of serum TC on RCC incidence and prognosis is poorly understood. Several large epidemiological studies identified a significant association between RCC incidence and metabolic disease, such as obesity, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, and abnormal serum lipid metabolism [ ]. In addition, a growing body of evidence suggests that metabolic syndrome components may be associated with RCC prognosis. Ha et al. identified diabetes as an independent prognostic factor in terms of RFS, CSS, and OS using multicenter data for 2597 patients with pT1 and pT2 clear cell RCC [ ]. There is substantial evidence for inverse associations between BMI and OS, CSS, and RFS in RCC [ , ]. Two recent studies have provided valuable new insights into the impact of preoperative TC level on RCC prognosis [ , ]. In the first of these, a surgical series of 364 Japanese patients with clear cell RCC, Ohno et al. reported that low serum TC level was significantly associated with aggressive tumor characteristics and worse prognosis [ ]. In the second, Martino et al. assessed the prognostic role of preoperative serum TC level in 867 patients with surgically treated RCC [ ]. These authors reported that low preoperative serum cholesterol level was associated with advanced TNM stage, high grade, and poor CSS in the entire study population and in patients with clinically localized disease [ ]. Despite the high value of these two studies, further large-scale validation of the prognostic role of TC in RCC is urgently needed. Our study provides further evidence that serum TC level is a prognostic factor in RCC. Despite the fact that our results are similar to those of previous studies in terms of the association between low serum TC level and aggressive tumor characteristics and poor prognosis, our study is unique for several reasons. First, the current multi-institutional Korean collaboration cohort included a large sample size ( n = 3064) and a large number of mortality cases ( n = 248), which enable adjustment for clinically and pathologically important confounding factors and subgroup analysis according to disease stage and histologic subtype. As metabolic syndrome is a systemic disorder that is linked to each component, the level of serum TC was correlated with age, BMI, hypertension, and diabetes, even if the association was weak in our analysis [ ]. We demonstrated the prognostic value of preoperative TC in RCC after adjusting for these confounding factors. Second, RCC encompasses more than ten histologic and molecular subtypes [ ]. Although clear cell carcinoma is the most common representative subtype of RCC, the presence of other subtypes that account for 20–30% of all RCC cases indicate that it is a heterogeneous disease with variations in disease progression and patient outcomes [ ]. Our analysis first addressed the effects of serum TC level on survival after stratification by disease stage and histologic subtype. Subgroup analysis of RFS and CSS showed that the influence of serum TC level differed according to disease stage or histologic subtype, suggesting that the prognostic significance of preoperative serum TC does not apply to all RCC patients. Interestingly, significant differences in RFS were detected in patients with T2–3 diseases, whereas the effect of preoperative serum TC level on CSS was limited to T1 diseases and was not observed in T2–3 diseases. This finding suggests that the prognostic effect of preoperative TC level on CSS is relatively less influential in advanced diseases. Regarding the prognostic impact of preoperative TC on recurrence in pT1 diseases, we observed little prognostic value. Careful consideration should be given to fact that recurrence in pT1 diseases is a relatively rare event, accounting for 6.2% of all cases, which could have contributed to our negative result.
Increasing evidence indicates that the preoperative nutritional and immunological status is not only associated with postoperative complications, but also with the long-term outcomes of patients with malignancy [ ]. In this context, the controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score, which is an index calculated from the serum albumin concentration, total peripheral lymphocyte count, and total cholesterol concentration, is reportedly valuable for immuno-nutritional assessment in patients with several cancers [ ]. Although it remains unclear why hypocholesterolemia is associated with a poor prognosis in RCC, several hypotheses have been proposed. RCC is involved in metabolism through aerobic glycolysis and lipid metabolism. RCC cells contain a particularly high amount of lipid, as they store lipids after converting free cholesterol to esterified cholesterol via acetyl-CoA cholesterol acetyl transferase at a rate 5.7-fold higher than that of normal kidney cells [ ]. Moreover, one of the sources of cholesterol is its acquisition from circulating blood via LDL receptor-mediated endocytosis. LDL receptor activity is reported to be elevated in patients with cancer, indicating that tumor-associated hypocholesteremia might result from increased cholesterol uptake by the neoplastic cells [ ]. In addition, TC concentration is known as an indicator of a patient’s caloric reserves [ ]. The hyper-catabolic state and inflammatory response that are caused by malignancy can exacerbate tumor cachexia and hypocholesteremia. Therefore, it is controversial whether tumor-associated hypocholesteremia is a consequence of the tumor cachexia or is a phenomenon of perturbations in cholesterol metabolism in neoplastic cells.
Several reports suggest that lipid-lowering agents are associated with improved survival in patients with localized or metastatic renal cancer [ , ]. However, whether the beneficial effects of statins on RCC are the result of the anti-neoplastic activity of statins or changes in the lipid profile remain unknown [ ]. Therefore, further research is needed to clarify the association of preoperative serum TC level and lipid-lowering agents with RCC prognosis.
Our study had several limitations. The retrospective design of the study suggests the possibility of sampling bias. Standardization of surgical techniques or practice guidelines, such as adjuvant treatment and follow-up protocols, was not possible because of the multi-institutional collaboration. In addition, the multi-institutional database did not contain information on statin use and other nutritional indices, such as serum albumin concentration or peripheral lymphocyte count. Some participants had a relatively normal serum lipid profile because they were taking statins to lower cholesterol and these patients were classified into the low TC group. However, the purpose of our study was not to estimate the association between TC level and the risk of developing RCC, but rather to investigate the effect of serum TC level on survival outcomes in patients with surgically treated RCC. If the TC level was lowered by statins, this possible confounder would tend to make the estimation of the effect of serum TC level on survival outcomes more conservative [ , ]. Moreover, the CONUT score is more integrative to evaluate the nutritional status of patients than measurement of the TC level alone. To overcome these concerns, our group is planning to collect more laboratory data, such as serum albumin concentration and total peripheral lymphocyte count. However, despite these limitations, the present study is the largest nationwide multicenter population study on the effect of preoperative serum TC level on the survival of RCC patients. Our findings are therefore highly generalizable and provide a broad insight into the impact of preoperative TC level on prognosis in patients with surgically treated RCC.
Conclusion
A low preoperative serum TC level is closely related to aggressive pathologic features and poor RFS or CSS in patients with surgically treated RCC. The serum TC level that is readily available and routinely assessed in clinical practice may provide additional prognostic information for patients with RCC.
