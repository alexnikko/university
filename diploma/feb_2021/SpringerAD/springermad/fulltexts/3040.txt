Introduction
Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a critical problem for both cancer patients and oncologists. The overall prevalence of CIPN is reported to be in the range of 40–70%, and the number of cases is increasing [ , ]. CIPN is caused by various anticancer drugs, including platinum analogues and taxanes, which play an important role in the treatment of a number of malignancies, such as breast and gastrointestinal cancers [ ]. Several risk factors for CIPN have been suggested, but it is still unclear if CIPN can be prevented [ , ]. CIPN can decrease quality of life (QOL) of patients with cancer by impairing motor, sensory, and autonomic function [ ] and, if severe, can lead to cessation of chemotherapy. Presently, there are no drugs available for prevention of CIPN [ ].
Goshajinkigan is a Japanese herbal medicine (Kampo) that contains fixed proportions of 10 crude drug extracts—achyranthes root, rehmannia root, dioscorea, rhizome, cornus fruit, alisma rhizome, plantago seed, moutan bark, pariah sclerotium, aconite root, and cinnamon bark [ ]. In Japan, Goshajinkigan has been widely used for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy without severe adverse events [ , ]. Kono et al. reported that Goshajinkigan was effective for the treatment of CIPN [ ]. Goshajinkigan was also reported to prevent CIPN without weakening the efficacy of anticancer drugs [ ]. The aim of this systematic review was to investigate the efficacy and safety of Goshajinkigan when used for prevention of CIPN.
Materials and methods
Registration and protocol
This review was registered prospectively in the PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews at the National Institute for Health Research and Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, University of York (registration number: CRD42016045224). The protocol used for the review was developed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines [ ] and has already been published [ ].
Inclusion criteria
The type of studies included in the review was all relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) except for cluster-randomised, crossover, and quasi-randomised trials. The study population comprised all adult patients (aged ≥18 years) receiving hospital-based chemotherapy. All doses of Goshajinkigan administered were included as experimental interventions if dosage was regularly administered. Also included, regardless of frequency or duration of drug administration, were all doses of the comparator drugs including placebo and any other drugs that could prevent CIPN, as well as cases in which no treatment was administered.
Outcome measures
The primary outcomes were the incidence rates of CIPN according to the common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) and neurotoxicity criteria of Debiopharm (DEB-NTC) [ ], the incidence rate of other adverse events associated with chemotherapy [nausea, fatigue, anorexia (CTCAE)], and the incidence rate of severe adverse events associated with Goshajinkigan [liver dysfunction, interstitial pneumonia (CTCAE)]. The secondary outcomes were subjective degree of CIPN [Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)], incidence rates of haematological toxicities [leukocytopenia, neutropenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia (CTCAE)], rate of response to chemotherapy [Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)], and rate of completion of chemotherapy.
Study search
A comprehensive literature search with no language restriction was conducted on 17 September, 2016, using the following electronic databases—Scopus, Ovid MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; The Cochrane Library), and ICHUSHI. Google Scholar was searched for grey literature.
Study selection and data collection
Titles and abstracts of the studies identified by the literature search were independently screened by two review authors (NH and RG). Full-text versions of the papers that met the inclusion criteria were obtained and checked to avoid duplicate publications. Reference lists of the included studies were checked.
Data were extracted by the same review authors. After the accuracy of the data was checked, the data were entered into Review Manager software, version 5.3 (Cochrane Collaboration).
Assessment of risk of bias
The risk of bias in the included studies was assessed by the same review authors according to the method described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions [ ] using random sequence generation, concealment of allocation, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, and other potential sources of bias. Potential bias was classified as high, low, or unclear in each domain. Percentage agreement was used to determine the concordance rate between the review authors.
Statistical analysis
Data synthesis was carried out with Review Manager software (Cochrane Collaboration). The Mantel–Haenszel method was used for dichotomous variables, and inverse-variance weighting was used for continuous variables. A fixed-effect model was used when there was no more than moderate heterogeneity, and a random-effects model was used when there was substantial or more heterogeneity. Results of each study and the overall pooled effect are presented as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) or mean differences (MDs) with 95% CIs in a forest plot. All P values were two-sided and considered to indicate a statistically significant difference at a P value < 0.05. Heterogeneity was investigated by visual inspection of the forest plots and by the chi-squared test. P values < 0.1 were considered to be statistically significant in the assessment of heterogeneity. Heterogeneity was also quantified by the I 2 statistic and interpreted as 0–40%, low heterogeneity; 30–60%, moderate heterogeneity; 50–90%, substantial heterogeneity; and 75–100%, considerable heterogeneity [ ]. We planned to assess reporting bias by funnel plots if ≥10 studies were included.
Results
Characteristics of included studies
The literature search identified 1345 references. After screening of the titles and abstracts, nine references were identified as studies potentially eligible for inclusion. Five studies finally met the inclusion criteria after full-text review and were included in the review (Fig. 1 ) [ , , , , ]. All five studies were RCTs with parallel design—4 included 2 arms and the remaining study included 3 arms. The 3-arm study included 2 relevant arms, a Goshajinkigan arm and a no-treatment comparator arm. A total of 386 participants were included in the analysis. Four studies were completed and one was stopped at the time of the interim analysis. Characteristics of the studies and the participants are shown in Tables 1 and 2 .

Assessment of risk of bias
Random sequence generation
Three studies used a computer random number generator, envelopes, or minimisation, and were judged to be at low risk of bias. The remaining two studies did not mention random sequence generation, so were judged to be at unclear risk of bias.
Allocation concealment
Two studies used central registration and were considered to have implemented allocation concealment. These studies were judged to be at low risk of bias. The remaining three studies did not mention allocation concealment, so were judged to be at unclear risk of bias.
Blinding of participants and personnel
Two studies included a placebo arm and reported that all patients and study personnel were blinded. These studies were judged to be at low risk of bias. The remaining three studies did not include a placebo arm, so it was not possible to blind either the study participants or personnel. Those studies were judged to be at high risk of bias.
Blinding of outcome assessors
Two studies reported that data collectors and clinical study personnel were blinded, so were judged to be at low risk of bias. The remaining three studies did not include placebo arms, so the outcome assessors could not be blinded. One of these open trials reported that the outcome assessors were blinded in spite of the open trial design, and we considered that it would have been possible to break the blinding in that study. All the open trials were judged to be at high risk of bias.
Incomplete outcome data
Two trials were able to follow all patients enrolled for the entire study period. Another two studies reported reasonable reasons about excluded participants, and the number of them was small and well balanced between the intervention and comparator groups in these studies. These four studies were judged to be at low risk of bias. One study did not provide any information on dropouts and was judged to be at high risk of bias.
Selective reporting
Four studies were registered on the University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trial Registry (UMIN-CTR). Two of the studies were identified as not containing selective reporting, so were judged to be at low risk of bias. In contrast, the other two studies were registered after the first study participant was enrolled and were judged to be at unclear risk of bias. The remaining study was not registered anywhere, and was similarly judged to be at unclear risk of bias.
Other bias
Four studies were considered to be free of apparent other bias and were judged to be at low risk of bias. One study was stopped at the time of the interim analysis and the dose of oxaliplatin administered was not comparable between the intervention and comparator groups. Therefore, this study was judged to be at high risk of bias.
The concordance rate between the two review authors was 86% for assessment of risk of bias in the included studies and this increased to 100% after discussion. The risk of bias in all studies included in this review is summarised in Fig. 2 . Two studies were judged to be at low overall risk of bias, and three studies to be at high overall risk because of lack of blinding of study participants, personnel, and outcome assessors (Table 1 ). Fig. 2 Assessment of risk of bias in the included studies
Assessment of publication bias
We were unable to assess the publication bias in this review because only five studies were included and funnel plots cannot be constructed when fewer than 10 studies are included.
Primary outcomes
Incidence rate of CIPN (CTCAE)
Four studies reported on the incidence rate of CIPN using CTCAE and were combined in the meta-analysis. The incidence rates of grade ≥2 and grade ≥3 CIPN were assessed. Grade 2 CIPN includes moderate symptoms and grade 3 includes severe symptoms with impairment of activities of daily living (ADL). Goshajinkigan did not reduce the risk of grade ≥2 CIPN (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.57–1.57, P = 0.83) when compared with controls. Heterogeneity was substantial ( I 2 = 75%, P < 0.01; Fig. 3 ). Furthermore, Goshajinkigan did not decrease the risk of grade ≥3 CIPN (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.59–2.00, P = 0.80). Heterogeneity was moderate ( I 2 = 31%, P = 0.23; Fig. 3 ). Fig. 3 Meta-analysis of Goshajinkigan for chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy: common terminology criteria for adverse events. a Grade ≥2. b Grade ≥3
Incidence rate of CIPN (DEB-NTC)
Three studies reported on the incidence rate of both grade ≥2 and grade ≥3 CIPN using DEB-NTC. Grade 2 means persistent symptoms for ≥7 days and grade 3 means functional disability with impairment of ADL. Two of the studies reported the number of patients with CIPN graphically but not numerically, so the number of patients with CIPN was estimated from a figure presented in each article. All three studies were combined in a meta-analysis. Goshajinkigan showed a tendency to decrease the risk of grade ≥2 CIPN (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.33–1.64, P = 0.46; Fig. 4 ) when compared with controls. There was considerable heterogeneity ( I 2 = 93%, P < 0.01). Goshajinkigan also showed a tendency to decrease the risk of grade ≥3 CIPN (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.28–1.52, P = 0.32), and there was substantial heterogeneity ( I 2 = 76%, P = 0.01; Fig. 4 ).

Incidence rate of adverse events associated with chemotherapy (CTCAE)
The incidence rates of nausea, fatigue, and anorexia were investigated using CTCAE. Four studies reported on the incidence rates of all grades of nausea, fatigue, and anorexia, and were combined in a meta-analysis. Goshajinkigan did not influence the risk of all grades of nausea (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.69–1.14, P = 0.34), the risk of all grades of fatigue (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.83–1.19, P = 0.96), or the risk of all grades of anorexia (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.80–1.35, P = 0.76). There was low heterogeneity for all grades of nausea ( I 2 = 0%, P = 0.41), all grades of fatigue ( I 2 = 0%, P = 0.91), and all grades of anorexia ( I 2 = 0%, P = 0.39; Table 3 ). Furthermore, four studies reported on the incidence rates of grade ≥3 nausea and anorexia and were combined for meta-analysis. Three studies reported on the incidence rate of grade ≥3 fatigue and were also combined for meta-analysis. Goshajinkigan did not influence the risk of grade ≥3 nausea (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.40–3.49, P = 0.76), the risk of grade ≥3 fatigue (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.08–2.07, P = 0.96), or the risk of grade ≥3 anorexia (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.24–2.03, P = 0.51). There was low heterogeneity for grade ≥3 nausea ( I 2 = 0%, P = 0.52), grade ≥3 fatigue ( I 2 = not applicable, P = not applicable), and grade ≥3 anorexia ( I 2 = 0%, P = 0.77; Table 3 ).

Incidence rate of severe adverse events associated with Goshajinkigan (CTCAE)
In five studies that reported on adverse events, there were no severe adverse events associated with Goshajinkigan . Therefore, we did not perform a meta-analysis because it was not possible to calculate RR.
Secondary outcomes
Subjective degree of CIPN (VAS)
One study reported the subjective degree of CIPN rated on VAS. Goshajinkigan significantly improved the subjective degree of CIPN (MD −2.20, 95% CI −3.38 to −1.02, P < 0.01) when compared with the control.
Incidence rate of haematological toxicities (CTCAE)
The incidence rates of leukocytopenia, neutropenia, anaemia, and thrombocytopenia were investigated using CTCAE. Three studies reported on the incidence rate of all grades of leukocytopenia, neutropenia, anaemia, or thrombocytopenia and were combined for meta-analysis. Goshajinkigan did not influence the risk of all grades of leukocytopenia (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.78–1.11, P = 0.42), the risk of all grades of neutropenia (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.76–1.06, P = 0.19), the risk of all grades of anaemia (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.87–1.26, P = 0.61), or the risk of all grades of thrombocytopenia (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.79–1.56, P = 0.55) when compared with controls. There was low heterogeneity in all grades of leukocytopenia ( I 2 = 0%, P = 0.66), all grades of neutropenia ( I 2 = 0%, P = 0.64), all grades of anaemia ( I 2 = 0%, P = 0.63), and all grades of thrombocytopenia ( I 2 = 27%, P = 0.24; Table 3 ). Furthermore, three studies reported on the incidence rates of grade ≥3 leukocytopenia, anaemia, and thrombocytopenia and were combined for meta-analysis. Four studies reported on the incidence rate of grade ≥3 neutropenia and were combined for meta-analysis. Goshajinkigan did not influence the risk of grade ≥3 leukocytopenia (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.54–1.65, P = 0.84), the risk of grade ≥3 neutropenia (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.67–1.18, P = 0.41), the risk of grade ≥3 anaemia (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.08–4.63, P = 0.64), or the risk of grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.15–7.26, P = 0.96) when compared with controls. There was low heterogeneity in grade ≥3 leukocytopenia ( I 2 = 0%, P = 0.82), grade ≥3 neutropenia ( I 2 = 0%, P = 0.54), grade ≥3 anaemia ( I 2 = 0%, P = 0.61), and grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia ( I 2 = 27%, P = 0.96; Table 3 ).
Rate of response to chemotherapy (RECIST)
Two studies reported on the response rate to chemotherapy, including complete and partial responses, and were combined for meta-analysis. Goshajinkigan did not influence the response rate (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.83–1.69, P = 0.35) and heterogeneity was low ( I 2 = 0%, P = 0.92; Table 3 ).
Rate of completion of chemotherapy
No studies reported on the rate of completion of chemotherapy. However, two studies reported on the number of chemotherapy cycles completed and the cumulative dose of oxaliplatin administered. One study reported that both parameters were similar between the intervention and comparator groups and the other study reported higher values in the Goshajinkigan group than in the placebo group.
Subgroup analyses
Subgroup analyses of type of chemotherapy and type of cancer had been planned but were impossible to perform because of insufficient studies included in the meta-analysis.
Discussion
In this review, we assessed the impact of Goshajinkigan on the prevention of CIPN using three scales—the CTCAE, DEB-NTC, and VAS. The CTCAE is a common scale for assessment of CIPN and was used in four studies, while DEB-NTC was used in three studies and VAS in only one study. All of the five studies reported on the prevalence of both grade ≥2 and grade ≥3 CIPN. The CTCAE is a scale that is widely used for assessment of drug-related adverse events, consists of 5 grades (grade 1–5), and focuses on the severity of CIPN. In contrast, the DEB-NTC is a specific scale for assessment of oxaliplatin-induced neurotoxicity [ ], consists of 4 grades (grade 0–3), and focuses on the duration of CIPN. There are reports of some discrepancies between the CTCAE and DEB-NTC in assessment of CIPN [ ]. In this review, the preventive effect of Goshajinkigan was not demonstrated when the CTCAE was used (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.57–1.57 for grade ≥2 CIPN and RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.59–2.00 for grade ≥3 CIPN), as shown in Fig. 3 . In contrast, Goshajinkigan tended to decrease the risk of CIPN (albeit not significantly) when the DEB-NTC was used (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.33–1.64 for grade ≥2 CIPN and RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.28–1.52 for grade ≥3 CIPN; Fig. 4 ). These results suggest that Goshajinkigan might prevent the persistence of CIPN but does not decrease the severity of CIPN. There is no definitive method for assessment of CIPN, and various scales have been used across studies. Recently, scales for QOL such as the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/Gynecological Oncology Group-Neurotoxicity (FACT/GOG-Ntx) questionnaire have shown promise in the assessment of CIPN [ ]. In the present review, assessment of CIPN using the FACT/GOG-Ntx questionnaire was not set as an outcome, but one of the studies included used it.
No severe Goshajinkigan -related adverse events were reported, and the rates of other chemotherapy-related adverse events and haematological toxicities were not different between the intervention and comparator groups. Further, Goshajinkigan did not influence the anti-cancer effect of chemotherapy. Therefore, Goshajinkigan did not have a negative impact on either the therapeutic effects or side-effects of chemotherapy in this review.
CIPN typically has a high rate of occurrence, which is dependent on the dose of anticancer drug administered, including single and cumulative doses [ ]. Among the five studies included, one was stopped at the time of the interim analysis because more participants in the Goshajinkigan group had developed CIPN than in the comparator group. However, more doses of oxaliplatin and more cycles of chemotherapy were administered in the Goshajinkigan group [ ]. The aim of cancer treatment is to achieve cure or delay progression of the disease, so we are most interested in the long-term results of the trials. Persistence of symptoms is another feature of CIPN [ ], and may be severe enough to warrant cessation of treatment, which may lead to progression of cancer [ ]. Meanwhile, chronic CIPN that becomes protracted after completion of treatment would affect cancer survivors for the rest of their lives [ ]. Prevention of CIPN may make it possible to continue treatment and receive high doses of anticancer drugs. Successful prevention of CIPN would lead to a better prognosis for patients with cancer as well as better QOL for cancer survivors.
The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) investigated 48 RCTs for CIPN and made a moderate recommendation for use of duloxetine in the treatment of CIPN [ , ], but there was no recommendation for the prevention of CIPN [ , ]. In the ASCO guideline, the evidence for efficacy of Goshajinkigan is inconclusive because only one study was included [ ]. At present, there is no standard prevention strategy for CIPN, and herbal medicines may have an important role to play in such conditions because they are made of natural products and are unlikely to be associated with adverse events. Furthermore, as Japanese herbal medicines are produced at dedicated facilities it enables the quality of these products to be kept stable, the same as for prescription drugs. Recently, Japanese herbal medicine has attracted much attention as ‘standardised’ herbal medicine in Western countries [ , , ].
An important strength of this review is that we searched a Japanese database that included articles in both Japanese and English, thereby minimising publication bias. Moreover, various dimensions of CIPN were assessed. However, there are some limitations to this review, particularly the potential heterogeneity. Furthermore, two types of malignancy (colorectal and breast cancer) and two types of anticancer drugs (oxaliplatin and taxanes) were included in this review. Finally, the number of study participants included in the meta-analysis was relatively small and some of the data combined for meta-analysis were estimated from the figures presented in each article. In future updates, it is favourable to conduct subgroup analyses based on type of cancer or chemotherapy if a sufficient number of studies are included in the meta-analyses. Due to these limitations, the results of high-quality RCTs including “Kono et al.” [ ] and “Oki et al.” [ ] may be currently more reliable for colorectal cancer patients.
The results of this review suggest that Goshajinkigan shows some tendency to prevent persistence of CIPN but does not diminish the severity of CIPN. However, most of the studies included in this review were at high overall risk of bias. Further higher quality studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy of Goshajinkigan . In future trials, multiple measures may be useful for assessment of various aspects of CIPN. CTCAE or DEB-NTC should be used for comparisons with previous studies, and use of other methods for assessment of patient QOL may be helpful.
