Highlights
Patients with antiphospholipid syndrome had an increased risk of recurrent thrombosis if they have a concomitant autoimmune disorder Black patients appear to have an increased risk of recurrent thrombosis The use of therapeutic dose anticoagulation for secondary thromboprophylaxis was associated with reduced risk of recurrent thrombosis compared to prophylactic dose anticoagulation. Individualizing the risk of recurrent thrombosis in patients with APS is essential in determining duration of anticoagulation
Introduction
Patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) (primary or secondary due to autoimmune disease) have an increased risk of recurrent venous and/or arterial thrombosis and pregnancy complications. Therefore, thrombotic risk assessment is necessary when individualizing antithrombotic therapy in patients with APS. Several cohorts of APS patients and patients with antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs) have been assessed for clinical risk factors of thrombosis [ , , , , ]. Putative risk factors include lupus anticoagulant (LA) positivity, high-titer aPL serology of IgG isotype, persistence of aPL, triple positive aPL and male sex [ , , , ]. A family history of thrombosis, inherited thrombophilia, cardiovascular (CV) disease, and concomitant autoimmune disease (AID) are additional thrombotic risk factors. Although autoimmune disease in the general population is associated with increased thrombotic risk, several studies have failed to show a significantly increased risk of recurrent thrombosis in secondary APS patients compared to primary APS patients [ , , , ]. The marked heterogeneity among APS patients has made risk profiling a challenging task and an area of ongoing research. A number of scoring systems have been designed [ ], with the Global APS score (GAPSS) being the best studied prototype in APS patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [ , ]. However, the GAPSS needs further validation and some of the assays incorporated are not widely available in clinical practice [ ]. Therefore, risk profiling and subsequent prevention strategies remain dependent on clinical expertise in the absence of standardized guidelines. The purpose of this study is to identify thrombotic risk factors in a cohort of patients who fulfill the Sydney criteria for the diagnosis of APS.
Methods
Retrospective review of electronic medical records of a cohort of adult patients (> 18 years) with APS receiving care in a Hematology clinic of a university medical center in New York City from July 2004 to July 2017. Patients were diagnosed with APS if they met the Sydney criteria for both the clinical and laboratory manifestations [ ]. The Sydney criteria, an update of the Sapporo criteria, require a history of a thrombotic event or pregnancy complication and the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs). Clinically, the patient must have a history of a thrombotic event (arterial, venous, or microvascular thrombosis) or pregnancy complications. Pregnancy complications are defined as: (a) one or more unexplained deaths of a morphologically normal fetus at or beyond the 10th week of gestation, (b) one or more premature births of a morphologically normal neonate before the 34th week of gestation because of eclampsia or severe preeclampsia or features of placenta insufficiency, (c) three or more unexplained consecutive spontaneous abortions before the 10th week of gestation. The laboratory criteria require a positive test result for aPLs on two or more occasions at least 12 weeks apart. The aPLs include an aPL ELISA (anticardiolipin [aCL], anti-beta 2 glycoprotein 1 [anti-β 2 GPI-1]) IgG, IgM and IgA isotypes (titer ≥ 30 µ/mL), and/or lupus anticoagulant (LA) positivity. Patients who did not have any follow-up visits were excluded. Thrombotic outcomes in relation to the antithrombotic used for secondary thromboprophylaxis in APS patients were analyzed.
Demographics, CV risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, smoking history) were collected from the electronic medical record at the time of the initial office visit. Personal and family history of thrombosis, inherited thrombophilia, and concomitant AID were obtained. Laboratory results of LA, aCL and anti-β 2 GPI-1 titers and isotype were collected from the initial visit. The isotype with the highest titer was considered the predominant isotype. The antibody titer was categorized into low (≥ 30 and < 40 µ/mL), moderate (≥ 40 and < 80 µ/mL), and high (≥ 80). Triple positive aPL was defined by having a positive LA, aCL and anti-β 2 GPI-1 (≥ 30 µ/mL) on two or more occasions at least 12 weeks apart. At initial visit patients were asked about specific dates of first thrombotic events (including pregnancy complications in female patients), as defined in the Sydney criteria [ ]. Patients were then followed for subsequent thrombotic events until the occurrence of an event or the latest visit, whichever occurred first. The time from the initial visit at our clinic to a thrombotic event was the primary outcome of our study.
All antithrombotic therapies used during follow-up were recorded. Therapies were categorized as antiplatelet therapy (apt), anticoagulant therapy (ac) including unfractionated heparin (UFH), low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), vitamin K antagonist (VKA), and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs).
We only included patients who had at least one follow-up visit.
Statistical analysis
Baseline patient characteristics were summarized using counts and percentages or median and interquartile ranges for categorical and continuous variables. Comparison across groups was done using Chi-squared, Fisher’s Exact, or Mann–Whitney tests as appropriate. Kaplan–Meier and unadjusted Cox proportional hazards time to event analysis were used to determine risk factors for thrombotic events during follow-up. If no event was observed, patients were censored at the date of last follow-up. A sensitivity analysis including only patients with a recent diagnosis (2 years) was also done. Due to frequent antithrombotic therapy changes within the same patient, a time dependent analysis was performed to allocate patients to their appropriate therapy category when switching from one therapy to another.
The hospital institutional review board approved the study.
Results
A total of 84 patients diagnosed with APS at or before initial visit formed the study group (Table 1 ). The median age at initial visit was 40.7 years [interquartile range 33.5–57.6]. The majority were female (n = 63, 75%) and White (n = 45, 54%). AID was present in 28 patients (33.3%), mainly SLE (Fig. 1 ). Inherited thrombophilia was identified in 7 (8.3%), and a family history of thrombosis or APS was noted in 10 (11.9%).

Clinically, 51 patients (60.7%) had a single previous thrombotic event, while 33 (39.3%) had had multiple events. Prior events included venous thromboembolism (VTE) in 44 patients (52.4%), arterial thrombosis (AT) in 19 (22.6%), pregnancy complications only (PC) in 11 (13.1%), and combinations of AT, VTE and PC in 10 patients (11.9%). The median time from APS diagnosis to initial study visit was 2.7 years.
During a median follow-up duration of 48 months from diagnosis, 15 patients (17.9%) had a recurrent thrombotic event. The history of these patients and serologic profiles are shown in Table 1 . These events were VTE in 6 (40%), PC in 5 (33.3%), AT in 2 (13%), combined VTE and PC in 1 (6.7%) and catastrophic APS (CAPS) in 1 patient (6.7%). Kaplan–Meier based cumulative incidence curves and 95% confidence intervals of thrombotic events during follow-up are presented in Fig. 2 . Of the 11 APS patients with only a history of PC, 3 developed additional PC on follow-up (27%), 2 had a concomitant VTE (one PE and the other PE+DVT) post-partum and the third patient had a CVA post-partum. One of the patients who developed post-partum VTE also had pathologically proven lingual thrombosis in the third trimester of her 3rd pregnancy. Two of these 3 women had triple positive aPL and one of them had SLE and positive LA.

In unadjusted analysis, a significantly higher rate of thrombotic events was observed in APS patients with AID compared to those without AID (hazard ratio (HR) 4.93, 95% CI 1.7–14.3, p = 0.04), and in patients of Black race compared to White race (HR 5.94, 95% CI 1.1–32.1, p = 0.039). Beyond AID and race, there was a non-statistically significant trend towards increased thrombotic events in patients with LA positivity, and patients with triple positivity. No other differences were seen in baseline characteristics.
In unadjusted analysis accounting for therapy in a time-varying manner, APS patients were significantly less likely to have a thrombotic event while on therapeutic anticoagulation than not HR 0.11, 95% CI 0.031–0.395, p = 0.001 (Fig. 3 a, b). No events occurred in patients taking a combined therapy of an antiplatelet agent and an anticoagulant; though follow-up time in this subgroup was substantially lower (25 person-years compared to 99, 99, and 213 person-years in antiplatelet, anticoagulant, and no therapy subgroups respectively). Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) were used in 10 (12%) patients with APS, with a median follow up length of 19 months (range 2–37 months). One patient had a CVA on apixaban, although he was missing doses. The DOACs used were rivaroxaban (78%), apixaban (11%), and dabigatran (11%). Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was used in 12 (14.3%) of patients. Given the relatively low number of patients on DOACs and on HCQ, the independent effects of these therapies could not be analyzed.

Major bleeding, clinically relevant non-major bleeding and minor bleeding occurred in 3 patients.
One male patient with a positive LA, experienced retroperitoneal bleeding requiring transfusion while on warfarin with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 3.1 in the setting of cough. He had temporary interruption of warfarin and developed bilateral lower extremity deep vein thrombosis. A female patient triple positive APS IgM isotype with history of temporal arteritis, retinal artery occlusion and psoriasis had an episode of epistaxis while on warfarin. She required visit to the emergency department and cauterization of the affected nostril. After this episode warfarin was discontinued and she was started on aspirin 81 mg. Three years later she developed ischemia of the left foot requiring by-pass surgery and initiation of warfarin. A third patient with positive LA and history of pulmonary embolism after a long distance long-haul flight had minor epistaxis while on apixaban. He stopped anticoagulation after completing 6 months of treatment. There has not been recurrent thrombosis at 22-month follow up visit.
Discussion
Patients with APS not on therapeutic-dose anticoagulation for secondary thromboprophylaxis had a higher incidence of recurrent thrombotic events than those on therapeutic-dose anticoagulation. This study identified concomitant AID and Black race as independent risk factors of thrombotic events in APS patients. While it is known that individuals with autoimmune disease have an increased thrombotic risk compared to the average population [ , , ], the additional risk of AID to APS patients has not been evident in other cohorts [ , , ]. Meanwhile, the increased thrombotic risk observed in black patients may be due to healthcare disparity or differences in disease biology. Although these findings should be validated in international, multicenter cohorts, the clinician should consider the additional risk associated with AID and Black race when selecting type and dose of antithrombotic therapy for secondary prevention in APS patients. These patients may be at a high enough risk to be considered for clinical trials of intensified antithrombotic regimens in secondary thromboprophylaxis (e.g., anticoagulant and hydroxychloroquine or combined anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents).
Patients with recurrent thrombotic events in the presence of positive aPLs should continue indefinite anticoagulation unless an absolute contraindication exists. In addition patients in whom the index thrombotic event was entirely unprovoked should also remain on anticoagulation. If a patient on chronic anticoagulation suffers a recurrent event, specifically arterial despite documented therapeutic anticoagulation the addition of aspirin or HCQ may need to be entertained. Hydroxychloroquine may decrease the level of aPLs and arterial events [ , ].
We discontinued anticoagulation in patients with isolated obstetrical APS or in patients in whom the index thrombotic event was provoked either by estrogen or a major thrombotic risk factor such as surgery. In addition two patients discontinued anticoagulation after a major and a clinically relevant non-major bleeding event, respectively. Another patient discontinued anticoagulation after 6 months due to personal preference.
It is important to note that this study included women in whom the initial manifestation of APS was obstetrical APS accounting for 13% of all patients. Despite prophylactic-dose anticoagulation 3 (27%) of these women developed pregnancy morbidity and 3 (27%) had either a VTE or a CVA post-partum. Therefore, in some women with triple positive aPL APS intermediate or therapeutic dose anticoagulation may be required. In addition, other non-antithrombotic therapies such as hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) may need to be considered in these patients [ , ]. A current clinical trial is underway evaluating the role of an anti-TNF alpha (Certolizumab) to the standard of care for obstetric APS patients [ ].
In our study we had 10 patients treated with DOACs most commonly rivaroxaban and 1 of 10 (10%) had a recurrent event. This is similar to the results of a recent study comparing triple positive APS patients randomized to warfarin vs. rivaroxaban. In this study 19% of patients with triple positive APS assigned rivaroxaban 20 mg had a recurrent event (arterial thrombosis) compared to 3% to those assigned to warfarin. Both groups had similar cardiovascular risk factors and the same number of patients was on concomitant aspirin therapy [ ].
This study has several limitations, including the relatively small number of patients and retrospective design, single center experience, referral bias, and the heterogeneous patient cohort. Although many patients had been diagnosed with APS shortly before arriving at our clinic, 8 of 15 events occurred in those who had been diagnosed at least 2 years prior to the start of our study. Ideally a subgroup analysis would be done using only those with a recent diagnosis, but the small number of events precluded us from doing so in this study. In addition, several variables could not be accounted for, such as patient adherence to therapy and transient thrombotic risk factors. Finally, the power of the analysis is limited by the sample size and the low frequency of events despite the long follow-up period (15 events in 337 person-years). We believe that selecting the patients with hematologic specialty follow-up is one of this study’s strengths, as this setting allowed for comprehensive laboratory testing in all patients and thorough documentation of history and events relevant to the diagnosis and care of APS patients. Moreover, the demographic diversity and clinical heterogeneity of this cohort suggests generalizability of the study findings to APS populations followed by other hematologic specialists.
Thrombotic risk assessment remains key for decision-making regarding secondary thromboprophylaxis in APS patients. Identification of clinical risk factors, such as concomitant AID and Black race in this cohort, enables the selection of high-risk APS patients who may benefit from intensification of antithrombotic regimen (e.g. adding an antiplatelet and/or HCQ to an anticoagulant agent). These interventions should be evaluated in an adequately powered multicenter trial.
