Introduction
Raising public awareness of cancer risk and protective behaviours is an important facet of public health programmes that aim to support positive behaviour change [ ]. Internationally, in recent years, there has been a surge in research exploring cancer awareness, which has also revealed interesting cross-cultural commonalities and diversity [ , , , , , , ]. There remains, however, a dearth of research about whether or not population awareness has changed over time. Replicating studies to look at change holds challenges given changes in communication technology over the past decade; however, this information is important for evaluating the reach and effectiveness of past interventions and informing new initiatives.
The purpose of this brief report is to describe the methods used in a study of Cancer Awareness in Aotearoa New Zealand, conducted in 2014/2015 (CAANZ15) and its comparison with a study conducted in 2001 (CAANZ01) [ , ]. Each study aimed to describe current cancer awareness among a national sample of New Zealand (NZ) adults, with additional aims for the CAANZ15 to collect comparative data to CAANZ01 and explore emerging issues in information provision and supportive care.
Methods
Source Population: CAANZ15
All NZ citizens, 18 years or older, are required by law to be enrolled on one of the two electoral rolls. The general roll is open to all NZ citizens, while those of Māori descent (the indigenous people of NZ) can choose to enrol on either the general or the Māori electoral roll. For this study, a sample of 3631 individuals was randomly selected from NZ electoral rolls (general roll, n = 3042; Māori roll, n = 589). Telephone numbers for 2038 (56 %) of the individuals sampled (general roll, 60 %; Māori roll, 34 %) were traced using online telephone directories, professional directories and social media.
Study Procedure: CAANZ15
Between October 2014 and March 2015, potential participants were mailed an introductory letter and information sheet explaining the study and inviting participation, as well as a letter of support from the Cancer Society of NZ (Cancer Society). This approach has been shown to increase participation [ ]. The introductory letter incorporated greetings in te reo Māori (the Māori language, one of the three official languages of NZ). Each was assigned to a trained telephone interviewer who made at least six attempts to contact them within a 4-week period following postage of the invitation letters. Where it was possible to identify ethnicity prior to contact, Māori and Pacific respondents were interviewed by Māori and Pacific interviewers, respectively. Participants who consented to be part of the study were scheduled an interview at a time of their convenience. The telephone interviews took, on average, 20 min to complete.
Study Measures: CAANZ15
The first section of the questionnaire replicated questions from CAANZ01 to allow comparison across time [ , ]. This included open-ended unprompted questions about knowledge of cancer risk factors, both overall and for specific cancer types. Participants also answered questions about specific risk factors for cancer and their beliefs about the early detection and treatment of cancer. The second section of the questionnaire included new questions related to their cancer information-seeking behaviours and understanding about effective support related to cancer survivorship. If participants wanted information about cancer, at any point, they were directed to the Cancer Society’s information help line, which is a free service, staffed by experienced volunteers. Following the interview, a letter of thanks was sent, which included a service/resource pamphlet from the Cancer Society. A summary of study findings was sent to participants following the completion of data collection.
Results and Discussion
Study Response Rate: CAANZ15
Of the 2038 invited participants in the study, 382 (general roll, n = 300; Māori roll, n = 82) were ineligible for interview. This was due to their contact details being either incorrect or out of date; having left NZ; imprisonment; not being cognitively competent to complete the interview (e.g. dementia); having a hearing impairment or not speaking English well enough to conduct a telephone interview. In total, 64 % ( n = 1064) (general roll, 65 %; Māori roll, 56 %) of eligible participants completed the questionnaire.
Representativeness of Study Participants
Although the study population was similar to the NZ 2013 census of resident population for gender, our sample was older and had higher socioeconomic status (as reflected by occupation) than the total population. This is likely to be due, at least in part, to the changing nature of telephone use, with younger cohorts being less likely to have landline call numbers, and more likely to change their address due to study or employment requirements. The younger cohort may also have been harder to trace via web searches as they were unlikely to have reached managerial or professional roles and so would tend not to appear on professional websites. The study sample was predominantly of NZ European ethnicity, under-representative of those of Pacific and Asian ethnicity, and to a lesser degree, those of Māori ethnicity.
In comparison with non-Māori, Māori constitute a youthful population: the median age of Māori was 23.9 years in the 2013 census, whereas it was 38.0 years for the entire NZ population [ ]. Therefore, to compensate for any disproportionate age-by-ethnicity (Māori/non-Māori) groups in the sample, poststratification weighting was adopted. Poststratification is an approach used to account for discrepancies between a sample and the population. Specifically, by adjusting sampling weights to reflect the population strata sizes, poststratification usually increases the accuracy (by decreasing bias due to differential non-response and under-represented groups) and precision (smaller standard errors) of estimates [ ]. In this study, census data from Statistics NZ was used to determine the population strata sizes (age group by ethnicity), where ethnicity was divided into Māori and non-Māori, and the age categories were 18–29, 30–49, 50–69 and 70+ years. In conjunction with the actual sample strata sizes, these population strata sizes were then used to calculate poststratification weights. Statistical analysis was performed in Stata using the survey commands to accommodate the survey design [ ]. As the survey data were weighted, maximum pseudolikelihood was used to obtain the estimated proportion parameters, and Taylor linearization to compute the appropriate standard errors.
Comparability with CAANZ01
Full description of CAANZ01 methods is published elsewhere [ , ]; however, in summary, a national telephone survey was conducted among a random sample, 20 years and older, identified from telephone directory listings, supplemented with self-identified Māori from electoral rolls. Of those eligible (according to population quotas set so that age, sex and ethnicity distributions were similar to NZ population proportions), 438 completed the interview (64 % participation). Unfortunately, more recent NZ research that has tried to use this ‘cold call’ approach has reported much lower response rates (e.g. 28 %) [ ], likely due to the changing nature of landline telephone use since 2001. Therefore, a decision was made for CAANZ15 to sample from the NZ electoral rolls rather than random digit dialling. It was felt that, on balance, the use of non-identical sampling methods was better than a low response rate with inadequate representation of the population. Both study cohorts reported higher SES than in the general population, as measured by education (CAANZ01) and occupation (CAANZ15), and were under-representative of people of Pacific and Asian ethnicity [ , ]. The CAANZ15 cohort was older than CAANZ01 (Table 1 ). To allow comparison between the two studies (differences in proportions), the CAANZ01 sample was also weighted using the 2013 New Zealand census data with respect to age by ethnicity group sizes.

Conclusion
Tracking cancer awareness over time is an important part of understanding, prioritising and evaluating cancer interventions which include awareness raising as a component. Shifts in technologies raise challenges for traditional population survey methods such as random digit dialling telephone interviews, particularly in countries such as NZ which do not have directories of cell phone numbers. This limits survey reach into population subgroups (such as youth) who use alternatives to home-based landlines. The challenges that this creates for sample comparability may discourage researchers from conducting follow-up surveys. Described here are the pragmatic changes in sampling and subsequent analytical steps taken to maximise the comparability of these samples in order to provide some information about changes in awareness over time.
The nature of the study samples does limit the generalisability of findings for younger age groups and for Pacific, Asian and Māori populations. The CAANZ15 study was strengthened in terms of responsiveness to Māori, incorporating Māori greetings in study materials, drawing on the experience of Māori interviewers and the expertise of the Māori health researcher within the research team (AD). The proportion of Māori respondents was closer to that in the general population than other ethnic groups; however, fewer individuals were able to be traced from the Māori roll than the general roll (34 vs 60 %) and there was a lower response rate among those eligible (56 vs 65 %). Thus, responses observed among Māori in this study may not be representative of those for the total Māori population. Finding more acceptable and appropriate research methodologies to explore cancer risk awareness among Māori remains a priority for future research. Given the importance developing an evidence base around how population cancer awareness is evolving over time, we hope the CAANZ study approaches and findings will contribute to further development of knowledge in this field.
