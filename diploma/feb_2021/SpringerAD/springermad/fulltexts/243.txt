Introduction
Oral anticoagulants (OACs) are arguably one of the highest priority medication families due to their widespread and chronic use, their importance in reducing major clinical events (such as stroke, thromboembolism, death), and their potential for major harm (primarily bleeds) [ , , ]. In both the United States and Canada, they have been shown to be the top medication safety problem for elderly patients [ , ]. Effective management of warfarin using the international normalized ratio (INR) time in therapeutic range (TTR) is associated with improved health outcomes, but this often requires frequent laboratory monitoring and dosage adjustment [ ]. This poses a particular challenge to outpatients, especially if they live in remote areas far from medical care [ ]. For some of these patients, self-monitoring and self-management have been found to be effective means of improving the quality of anticoagulation management, but these require considerable patient knowledge and the cost of self-testing equipment can be high [ ]. The newer direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), including dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban, do not need, or benefit from laboratory monitoring. However, as they are still narrow therapeutic range drugs, they require proper management for optimal use.
Telehealth has been proposed to be a similarly effective management strategy compared to usual care that is more convenient for patients and potentially more efficient in terms of time and resources [ ]. Telehealth is defined as the application of telecommunications technology to provide health care at a distance and can include services such as remote monitoring or video consultation [ ]. Past literature has noted some advantages of telehealth interventions over usual care including the facilitation of frequent, consistent monitoring, and the delivery of care to remote patients [ , ]. A large volume of research has reported high benefits of telehealth when used for chronic conditions, whether it is aimed at improving communication or management [ ]. There are also potential limitations to telehealth, such as lower quality of patient-provider relationships, and unequal access to telehealth services, particularly for patients of lower socioeconomic status [ , ].
In light of these potential benefits and drawbacks of telehealth, this systematic review was aimed at assessing the available evidence on the effectiveness of telehealth interventions for oral anticoagulation management in improving clinically important outcomes.
Methods
Protocol and registration
This systematic review was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) on October 12th, 2016 (registration number CRD42016046236) following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines [ ].
Eligibility criteria
Included studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective and retrospective cohort studies assessing the effects of telehealth interventions on anticoagulation outcomes in hospital, community and/or institutional settings. Full text reports and conference abstracts published in English from January 1st, 2000 to March 6th, 2017 were considered.
Included participants were adult patients (18 years or older) on OAC therapy, such as vitamin K antagonists or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), irrespective of the indication for treatment (for example, atrial fibrillation (AF), venous thromboembolism (VTE), etc).
Telehealth interventions were defined as those which apply telecommunications technology to provide health care, such as remote monitoring and consultation. Communication between patient and health care provider over telephone was a necessary component of included telehealth interventions. Comparator interventions were those administered as a part of usual care, which involved in-person visits with family physicians, specialists or clinicians at anticoagulation clinics.
Co-primary outcomes were major thromboembolic and major bleeding events, using the definitions in the individual studies. Major thromboembolic events included VTE, stroke, and pulmonary embolism. Bleeding identified as clinically significant, serious, life-threatening or fatal, was also included as major bleeding. Secondary outcomes include any bleeding event, hospitalizations, mortality, and TTR for warfarin [ ].
Search
The search strategy was developed in collaboration with an expert librarian, and was last run on March 6th, 2017. Terms related to telehealth, telemedicine, and other remote services involving telecommunications were combined with terms related to anticoagulants and anticoagulation management. Electronic searches were conducted through the bibliographic databases: MEDLINE (OVID, 1996 onward), EMBASE (OVID, 1996 onward), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials/CENTRAL (Wiley, current issue). Full details of the search strategies for EMBASE, MEDLINE and CENTRAL are provided in Online Appendix.
Study selection
Two review authors independently screened studies for inclusion, first through title and abstract screening, and followed by full-text screening. Studies were excluded if they: were not RCTs, prospective or retrospective cohort design; included children; did not administer a telehealth intervention by this review’s definition; did not focus on anticoagulation management; did not compare to usual care; or had no relevant outcomes. Disagreements in screening results were resolved by consensus, after review and discussion.
Data extraction
A data collection form was adapted from that recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration [ ]. The form was piloted and improved, after which two review authors subsequently conducted data extraction independently. Data were extracted on: study design; setting; population and participant demographics; details of the intervention including type, timing and duration; details of comparator care; outcomes and their measures; and information for the assessment of bias [ ].
Dichotomous outcomes were reported as per the original study, as total number of events or the number of patients who experienced the event, hazard ratio (HR), relative risk (RR) or incidence rate ratio (IRR). TTR for patients on warfarin was reported as mean percent time in the target INR.
Risk of bias
Two review authors independently conducted risk of bias assessments. Tools recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration for cohort studies and for randomized trials were used [ , ]. These tools assessed for selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias, reporting bias and other biases. Risk of bias was assessed at the study level, and where there was insufficient information to determine risk of bias, an unclear rating was given. These results were used to inform a GRADE evidence table [ ]. GRADE assesses the quality of evidence for each outcome and strength of recommendations that can be made from the given results. The GRADE system classifies the quality of evidence as high, moderate, low or very low, with RCTs starting with a high rating and observational studies starting at a low rating. Reasons for rating down the evidence include high risk of bias, inconsistency of results, indirectness of evidence, imprecision and reporting bias.
Synthesis of results
Results were analyzed using Review Manager 5.3 [ ]. For the statistical analysis of dichotomous outcomes (e.g. event versus no event), risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated as summary statistics. Where necessary, RR was calculated from HR, IRR or the actual reported number of patients with or without the event using the integrated calculator program in Review Manager [ ]. A random-effects model with the Mantzel-Haenzel method was used to calculate the pooled RR. For the analysis of TTR, the mean difference and 95% CI was calculated. Heterogeneity amongst studies was examined with the use of Chi 2 and I 2 statistics.
Results
Study selection
The literature search retrieved 2145 citations, 1893 of which were unique citations. Of these, 1820 citations were excluded after title and abstract screening, leaving 73 to continue to full-text review. After excluding 66 of these based on study design, intervention, outcomes and relevance to anticoagulation management, 7 studies adequately met the criteria for our systematic review, including 5 full-text reports and 2 conference abstracts containing sufficient information for data extraction. Six of these studies contributed data to the meta-analysis. Details of study selection are provided in Fig. 1 .

Study characteristics
The seven included studies included 1 RCT, 1 prospective cohort study, and 5 retrospective cohort studies [ , , , , , , ]. Five out of the seven studies were conducted in the United States [ , , , , ]; one was conducted in Germany [ ], and another in Slovenia [ ]. Four of the seven studies were conducted solely through one or more anticoagulation clinics [ , , , , ], while two studies had mixed settings of hospitals and clinics. One study investigated a telehealth intervention in nursing (long-term care) homes and patient homes [ ]. Study durations ranged from 3 months to 8 years. All included studies examined vitamin K antagonists; none addressed DOAC management.
Participant characteristics apart from age varied greatly between studies, with the greatest variation in indications for anticoagulant use. Similarly, there were many differences in the type, timing and duration of telehealth interventions across studies. For instance, Staresinic et al. studied the effectiveness of a ‘telephone model’ that combined self-reported INR, patient questionnaire and 24 h telephone follow up, and compared it with a face-to-face clinic model [ ]. By contrast, Stoudenmire et al. conducted a study in which patients had telephone appointments, and had their INR measurements done by an outside laboratory or home healthcare agency [ ]. All telehealth interventions involved telephone communication and most included scheduled telephone appointments between the patient and healthcare provider. Further details of each study are provided in Table 1 .

Risk of bias
The risk of bias of the included studies was overall unclear to high. Prognostic imbalances between telehealth and usual care groups were a common form of bias found in the retrospective cohort studies. With these retrospective studies, participants receiving telehealth interventions were usually those who were unable to attend hospitals or anticoagulation clinics due to physical disabilities or inability to afford the necessary transportation. For the RCT, blinding of the participants to the intervention was not possible and blinding of outcome assessment was not done. Risk of bias was further increased by incomplete outcome data due to loss to follow-up. For all studies, there was insufficient information for most domains, leading to unclear risk of bias. Figure 2 provides a summary of the risk of bias assessments.
Fig. 2 Risk of bias summary
No single study looked at all clinically relevant outcomes. Therefore, for each outcome, different studies were included for meta-analysis. Forest plots for each outcome are provided in Fig. 3 . The GRADE evidence profile is provided in Table 2 .

Major bleeding events
Six studies reported major bleeding as one of their outcomes [ , , , , , ]. Three of these studies reported the number of patients who experienced the event [ , , ] while the remaining 3 reported the total number of events [ , , ]. Since reports of the total number of events can be skewed by one or more patients experiencing the event a large number of times, only data on the number of patients who had one or more instances of major bleeding were included in the meta-analysis. Results from the 3 studies (n = 6955) showed that, compared to usual care, telehealth interventions did not reduce major bleeding events (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.52–1.33, p = 0.44). There was no heterogeneity (I 2 = 0%). The results from the other studies that were not meta-analyzed were mostly consistent with these results, with one study reporting a significant improvement in the telehealth group [ ].
Major thromboembolic events
All seven studies reported major thromboembolic events as one of their outcomes [ , , , , , , ]. Three of these studies reported the number of patients who experienced the event [ , , ]. Three other studies reported the total number of events, [ , , ] and the last study only reported the incidence rate ratio (IRR) [ ]. Meta-analysis of the 3 studies reporting by patient (n = 6955) showed that telehealth interventions were better than usual care in reducing major thromboembolic events (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.25–0.74, p = 0.002). There was no heterogeneity (I 2 = 0%). The studies that were not meta-analyzed failed to show a statistically significant difference.
Any bleeding events
Three studies reported any bleeding events as one of their outcomes, but could not be pooled [ ]. However, the results from individual studies showed no statistically significant difference.
Hospitalizations
Five studies reported hospitalizations as one of their outcomes [ , , , , ]. From the two studies (n = 310) reporting the number of patients that were hospitalized at least once, there was no significant difference between telehealth interventions and usual care (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.41–1.05, p = 0.08) [ , ]. There was no reported heterogeneity (I 2 = 0%). An additional study that reported event rates suggested a significant improvement in the telehealth group [ ].
Mortality
Three studies (n = 6845) reporting mortality as one of their outcomes were included in the meta-analysis [ , , ]. The overall effect estimate showed no difference between the groups for risk of mortality (RR 0.63, 95% 0.13–3.06, p = 0.57), but the results were highly heterogeneous (I 2 = 77%).
Time in therapeutic range
Three studies provided four comparisons (n = 18,815) for TTR [ , , ]. The meta-analysis of the provided data showed that there was no difference between TTRs of patients receiving telehealth and usual care (MD 1.29%, 95% CI − 1.21 to 3.78%, p = 0.09). There was some heterogeneity in the results (I 2 = 53%). Improvements in TTR were not always associated with improved other clinical outcomes.
Discussion
Summary of evidence
Our systematic review and meta-analysis clarifies the literature on the effect of telehealth interventions on clinically important anticoagulant outcomes. While most outcomes were similar between telehealth and usual care, the rate of major thromboembolic events was significantly lower in the telehealth group. However due to high risk of bias, wide confidence intervals and low quality study designs, the level of evidence to support this conclusion is very low, meaning that a well done additional study could significantly change our conclusion. The only randomized trial in our review was rated at a very low quality of evidence, showed no significant difference in any outcomes, but only included 192 participants [ ]. The observational studies are larger, with the largest having a sample size of 9496 [ ], but these are seriously flawed by confounders and other risks of bias.
The findings from this systematic review and meta-analysis are consistent with a previous systematic review of reviews on the topic of telehealth and telemedicine. Reviewers have noted the need for larger studies, with higher quality designs such as RCTs [ ]. In addition, more economic analyses and evaluations of patient perspectives are needed to obtain a more complete understanding of the benefits and harms of telehealth interventions [ ]. Furthermore, our review found no evidence on DOAC management, so studies on telehealth interventions to improve DOAC-related clinical outcomes would be welcome.
Despite the lack of consistent evidence of superiority of telehealth interventions compared to usual care, there are potential advantages to telehealth that support its use. As highlighted in a number of the retrospective studies, telehealth interventions have historically been used for patients who were unable to attend anticoagulation clinics due to physical disabilities or the inability to afford transportation [ , , ]. Current usage of telehealth appears to be driven by its convenience and accessibility for patients, rather than clear evidence of effectiveness. However, in contrast to these potential benefits, telehealth requires specialized equipment and can be more expensive than in-person healthcare visits (as in Ontario, which has consultation premium billing [ ] or in the United States where telehealth services provided to the home are not reimbursed by Medicare [ ]). Telehealth consultations may also miss important signs that would be apparent in an in-person physical exam [ ].
Limitations
The main limitation of the systematic review relates to the quality of design and reporting of the underlying studies. Only seven studies met our topic inclusion criteria and only one of those was a randomized trial. There was also a lack of economic evaluations that could begin to estimate the cost effectiveness of telehealth interventions, as compared to usual care. Furthermore, meta-analysis of the included studies was difficult due to the low number of studies and incomplete reporting (omitted standard deviations and p-values) for outcomes. Finally, it is possible that some relevant studies were missed in our search because of our English-only language criterion.
Implications
The findings of this systematic review do not allow for any strong recommendation regarding the use of telehealth interventions in anticoagulation management. We did not detect a signal of harm in using telehealth compared to usual care, suggesting that such interventions are safe for use in practice, but clinical events were gleaned from low quality studies. Overall, the evidence is not compelling enough to warrant a policy supporting the use of telehealth interventions in anticoagulation management. Therefore, higher quality studies should be conducted to determine the benefits, harms and cost of telehealth compared to usual care for anticoagulant-related clinical outcomes.
Conclusion
Because of the very low quality of evidence, we are uncertain about the benefits and harms of telehealth interventions compared to in-person medical care for anticoagulation-related clinical outcomes. High quality randomized trials are needed to assess the benefits, harms and cost-effectiveness of telehealth interventions for anticoagulation.
