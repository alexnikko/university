Introduction
The role of inflammation in depressive disorder has attracted increasing attention over the past two decades. Recently, an inflammatory hypothesis is proposed based on different observations, including (a) elevated levels of inflammatory markers in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), even in the absence of a medical illness, (b) co-occurrence of MDD with inflammatory illnesses and (c) increased risk of MDD with cytokine treatment (Patel ). Given the limited effectiveness of current treatment options, the inflammatory hypothesis may provide insight into novel therapeutic strategies for depression.
Systemic administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) could trigger the pro-inflammatory state observed in MDD and has been acknowledged as a well-established experimental model of depression (Fu et al. ). To our knowledge, LPS induces depressive-like behavior following sickness behavior. Studies have shown that activation of indoleamine 2,3-double oxygen enzyme (IDO) by pro-inflammatory cytokines is a critical event in the switch from sickness to depression (Fu et al. ; Walker et al. ). IDO is responsible for tryptophan degrading along kynurenine pathway. Over-activation of this pathway induces increased formation of brain quinolinic acid and subsequently activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (Walker et al. ). Considering the supporting role for increased NMDA receptor activity in depression, IDO-mediated tryptophan-degrading pathway might contribute to LPS-induced depressive-like symptoms. Corroborating this hypothesis, it has been shown that both IDO inhibitors and NMDA receptor antagonists exert antidepressant-like effects after LPS administration (O'Connor et al. ; Dobos et al. ; Walker et al. ). Moreover, clinical studies have indicated that depressed patients could benefit from conventional anti-inflammatory drugs, such as aspirin (Mendlewicz et al. ; Krause et al. ), celecoxib (Müller et al. ) and etanercept (Tyring et al. ). Thus, we hypothesized that inhibiting inflammatory response plays an important role in successful antidepressant treatment, and the mechanisms might be related to IDO-mediated tryptophan-degrading pathway.
In line with this premise, gentiopicroside (Gent), a natural secoiridoid glucoside enriched in various herbs, has demonstrated powerful anti-inflammatory effects (Niu et al. ; Jia et al. ; Zhao et al. ). Indeed, a recent study by our group showed that Gent could attenuate pain/depression dyad induced by reserpine in mice through down-regulation of GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors in the basolateral amygdala (Liu et al. ). Considering the findings mentioned above, the present study aimed to investigate its possible effects on depression-like behavior following systemic LPS administration. Furthermore, we evaluated whether the antidepressant-like effect was related to tryptophan-degrading pathway.
Materials and methods
Drugs
Gent (separated from Gentiana scabra Bunge, purity 99%), purchased from Spring & Autumn Biologic Engineering Co. Ltd. (Nanjing, China), was dissolved in sterile saline at a concentration of 5 mg/mL. LPS (from Escherichia coli strain 055:B5) was obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) and freshly dissolved in sterile saline prior to use. The reference standards of tryptophan, kynurenine and quinolinic acid were also supplied by Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Methanol (HPLC grade) was obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Anti-GluN2A and anti-GluN2B antibodies were purchased from Millipore (Billerica, MA), while anti-β-actin antibody was supplied by Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Enzyme-Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay (ELISA) kits for measurement of IL-1β and TNF-α were purchased from Elabscience Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Wuhan, China).
Animals and treatment
8–10-week-old male BALB/C mice were obtained from the Laboratory Animal Center of the Fourth Military Medical University. The animals were kept in standard environmental conditions (24 °C ± 2 °C; humidity 50 to 60%; a 12:12 h light–dark cycle) with food and water available ad libitum. After 7 days adaptation, mice were randomly divided into three groups and administrated with Gent (50 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline for three consecutive days followed by a single injection of LPS (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.). The LPS dosage was chosen for its ability to induce acute sickness response and subsequent depressive-like behavior in many previous studies (Lejuez et al. ; Custodio et al. ; Mello et al. ; Tomaz et al. ). Gent at the dosage of 50 mg/kg was selected because it demonstrated antidepressant-like effects in reserpine-induced mice in our previous study. (Liu et al. ). Meanwhile, mice serving as control were administered similarly with vehicle. As no significant affect was observed in mice following 100 mg/kg Gent for three consecutive days in our published paper, Gent alone group was not included in the current study considering the welfare of animals (Liu et al. ).
Animals were subjected to behavioral tests 24 h after LPS administration. The test sessions were recorded by a video camera and scored by a competent observer blind to treatment. Blood and brain samples were harvested immediately after the measurement of behavior paradigms for biochemical estimation. To minimize the suffering of animals, mice were euthanized under 2.5% isoflurane anesthesia. Blood samples were taken from orbital venous plexus, while brain samples were removed following perfusion with sterile saline. Prefrontal cortex (PFC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) were dissected on ice by a trained researcher according to Glowinski and Iversen’s method (Glowinski and Iversen ). The Institutional Ethical Committee of the Fourth Military Medical University specifically approved this study.
Forced swimming test (FST)
Mice were individually placed in an open cylindrical container (diameter 10 cm, height 25 cm) containing 19 cm of water at 25 ± 1 °C as previously described. Mice were allowed to swim for 6 min and immobility was recorded during the last 4 min. Immobility was defined as no movements other than those necessary to keep its head above water (Heydarpour et al. ).
Tail suspension test (TST)
TST was performed as previously described (Steru et al. ). In brief, testing was carried out in a darkened room with minimal background noise. Each mouse was individually suspended upside down by tail with the head 5 cm above the bottom. Immobility time was determined for the last 4 min during a 6-min test.
Open field test (OP)
The open field (OP) test was conducted in order to rule out the possibility that immobility time of TST and FST was due to its defect of locomotor activity. The open field arena was made of plexiglas (30 × 30 × 30 cm) with dim illumination and a fan. Each animal was placed in the center of the arena and allowed to freely explore for 10 min. Spontaneous locomotion was recorded using video tracking technique, and then analyzed by JL-Behv-LAG-4 video analysis system (Jiliang Software Technology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China). Both distance traveled and time in center field were used to evaluate locomotor activity. The “center” field is defined as the central 15 × 15 cm 2 area of the open field, one-fourth of the total area.
Immunoassays for IL-1β and TNF-α
IL-1β and TNF-α levels in plasma and brain were determined by ELISA kits (Elabscience Biotechnology, Wuhan, China). Plasma was used without dilution, while tissue samples from the basolateral amygdale (BLA) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) were homogenized in 5 volumes of ice-cold PBS with protease inhibitor. After centrifugation at 5000×g for 15 min, the supernatant was collected to measure the content of IL-1β and TNF-α according to manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, samples or a series of standard solution were added into 96-well ELISA plates to combine with the specific antibody. After rinsing with wash buffer, the prepared solution of biotinylated detection antibody and HRP-conjugate was successively added and incubated. Afterwards, enzyme-substrate reaction was triggered by addition of substrate reagent to each well and terminated by stopping solution. Subsequently optical density was measured spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of 450 nm. Sample concentrations were calculated based on a standard curve and expressed as pg/g tissue or pg/mL.
Measurement of brain tryptophan and its metabolites by LC-MS/MS
The concentrations of tryptophan and its metabolites (kynurenine and quinolinic acid) in brain were estimated by LC-MS/MS (Aglient, USA) as described in a previous report with minor modifications (Huang et al. ). Chromatographic separation was carried out on an Intersil ODS-3 C18 (150 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm, GC, Japan) with a guard column (4.0 × 2.0 mm, 5 μm, Phenomenex, USA) kept at 25 °C. The mobile phase consisted of water (containing 0.1% formic acid) /methanol (30:70, v /v), at a flow rate of 500 μL/min. Quantification was obtained by using MRM mode of the transitions at m/z 205 → 188 for tryptophan, at m/z 209 → 192 for kynurenine, at m/z 168 → 150 for quinolinic acid respectively, with a scan time of 0.3 s per transition. Brain samples were homogenized in 2 volumes of ultra-pure water and 200 μL homogenate was extracted with 200 μL acetonitrile. After vortex-mixing and centrifugation, the supernatant was separated out and evaporated to dryness under vacuum at 40 °C. Then the residue was reconstituted in 80 μL mobile phase and mixed to make final testing samples. A 20 μL aliquot of final testing samples was injected onto the LC-MS/MS system for analysis.
Western blot
PFC samples were lysed in ice-cold RIPA buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, USA) by sonication. After centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was collected and protein concentration was determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, USA). Equal amounts of protein (50 μg) from PFC were separated and electrotransferred onto PDVF membranes (Invitrogen, USA), which were probed with antibodies for GluN2A-containing NMDA receptors (GluN2A, dilution ratio 1:200), GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors (GluN2B dilution ratio 1:500), and with β-actin (dilution ratio 1:10000) as a loading control. The membranes were further incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies, and the resulting bands were visualized by an ECL system (Perkin Elmer, USA).
Data analysis
Data were expressed as mean ± standard error of means (SEM). Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software (Version 13.0, USA). Data that passed homogeneity test were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post hoc Least Significant Difference (LSD) test. Data that did not pass homogeneity test were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by post hoc Dunnett’s T3 test. In all cases, p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Pretreatment with gent alleviated LPS-induced depressive-like behavior
As shown in Fig. 1 , LPS administration (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) increased immobility time in both FST and TST 24 h after treatment, while pretreatment with Gent (50 mg/kg, i.p.) caused a significant reduction in the immobility time (F(2, 31) = 32.026, p < 0.01; p = 0.001, saline vs. control; p = 0.05, Gent vs. saline; p = 0.035, Gent vs. control Fig. 1 a; F(2, 31) = 25.380, p < 0.01; p = 0.001, saline vs. control; p = 0.011, Gent vs. saline p = 0.05, Gent vs. control Fig. 1 b). Furthermore, no significant difference was observed among groups in OP test, thereby indicating that the behavioral changes were not due to abnormal locomotor activity.

Treatment of Gent (50 mg/kg for 3 days, i.p.) decreased immobility time in the forced swimming test ( a ) and tail suspension test ( b ) in LPS-induced mice. In the open field test, no difference was observed between groups in ( c ) the total distance travelled and ( d ) time in the center area. n = 11~12 animals for each group,* p < 0.05,** p < 0.01 compared with the control mice. #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01 compared to the LPS-induced mice treated with saline
Pretreatment with gent reversed central alterations in IL-1β and TNF-α levels induced by LPS
LPS-induced behavioral changes are dependent on exaggerated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Based on this evidence we evaluated the plasma and brain levels of IL-1β and TNF-α immediately after behavioral test. As shown in Fig. 2 , both IL-1β and TNF-α concentrations in plasma demonstrated no significant difference 24 h after LPS challenge. However, the levels of IL-1β were still higher in the PFC and BLA of LPS-treated mice when compared with control animals (F(2, 14) = 12.241, p < 0.01; p < 0.001, saline vs. control for PFC; F(2, 14) = 8.57 p < 0.01; p = 0.004, saline vs. control for BLA; Fig. 2 b). Fortunately, Gent treatment (50 mg/kg, i.p.) showed a significant decrease in brain levels of IL-1β by approximately 22.0% ( p = 0.001, Gent vs. saline; p = 0.156, Gent vs. control for PFC; p = 0.0042, Gent vs. saline; p = 0.322, Gent vs. control for BLA; Fig. 2 b). In addition, similar results were observed in PFC and BLA levels of TNF-α (F(2, 14) = 5.254, p < 0.05; p = 0.008, saline vs. control; p = 0.026, Gent vs. saline; p = 0.543, Gent vs. control for PFC; F(2, 14) = 10.412 p < 0.01; p = 0.001, saline vs. control; p = 0.005, Gent vs. saline; p = 0.289, Gent vs. control for BLA; Fig. 2 d).

Pretreatment with gent prevented over-activation of tryptophan-degrading pathway induced by LPS
To assess the involvement of tryptophan-degrading pathway in Gent’s effects against depressive-like behavior induced by LPS, brain levels of tryptophan and its metabolites were determined by LC-MS/MS. The results were summarized in Table 1 . Statistical analysis showed that brain kynurenine/tryptophan ratio increased in LPS-treated mice, suggesting activation of kynurenine pathway in the brain. As expected, the alteration was recovered by Gent treatment (F(2, 15) = 14.424, p < 0.01; p < 0.001, saline vs. control; p < 0.001, saline vs. Gent; p = 0.01, Gent vs. control). Increased kynurenine during inflammation was preferentially metabolized into quinolinic acid, an NMDA receptor agonist (Saito et al. ; Walker et al. ). Therefore, we tried to quantify brain quinolinic acid in various groups. Unfortunately, the concentration of quinolinic acid was lower than the limit of detection (20 ng/mL). In addition, LPS increased brain tryptophan, but treatment with Gent had marginal effect on elevated tryptophan levels.

Pretreatment with gent recovered LPS-induced alterations in protein expression of NMDA receptors
As over-activation of tryptophan-degrading pathway by pro-inflammatory cytokines resulted in N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-mediated excitotoxicity, we examined the expression of NMDA receptor subunits in PFC homogenates via western blot analysis to detect the effects of Gent on NMDA receptor. Figure 3 a showed a representative western blot of GluN2A (panel A) and GluN2B (panel B) in PFC homogenates. LPS treatment increased the expression levels of GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors, and GluN2B subunit expression was significantly reduced in the PFC of Gent-treated mice (F(2, 14) = 19.615, p < 0.01; p = 0.000, saline vs. control; p = 0.001, saline vs. Gent; p = 0.01, Gent vs. control for GluN2B expression). However, all treatments caused no alteration in GluN2A subunit expression (F(2, 14) = 0.268 p > 0.05; p = 0.542, saline vs. control p = 0.529, saline vs. Gent for GluN2A expression). Fig. 3 Gent reverses GluN2B receptors expression in the LPS-induced mice. ( a ) a representative Western blot analysis of GluN2A and GluN2B in total homogenates of PFC.

Discussion
Gentiopicroside (Gent) is a secoiridoid compound isolated from Gentiana scabra Bunge, one of the most common herbal medicines used in China. There are data which indicate that Gent traverses the blood brain barrier and possesses possible beneficial effects in an experimental model of pain/depression dyad. In this study, we demonstrated for the first time that Gent could abrogate LPS-induced depressive-like behavior in mice, and the effect was related to preventing over-activation of tryptophan-degrading pathway induced by pro-inflammation cytokines.
In the present study, depressive-like behavior was assessed by measuring immobility time of mice in FST and TST. In agreement with previous reports, mice subjected to LPS displayed increased immobility time 24 h after systemic LPS injection. Importantly, Gent pre-treatment successfully reversed these behavioral alterations, suggesting its antidepressant-like effect.
As we all know, LPS administration elicits the increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines. Numerous reports have shown that the rise of IL-1β and TNF-α seems to be an important factor in the stress-associated neuropathology and psychopathology, and therapeutic administration of anti-TNF-α or anti-IL-1β antibodies could help relieve depression and stress-related mood disorders (Nguyen et al. ; Rothwell and Luheshi ; Wang et al. ; Young et al. ). Therefore, the content of IL-1β and TNF-α in plasma and brain areas was evaluated. Here our results clearly showed that IL-1β and TNF-α levels in PFC and BLA of LPS-treated mice were significantly higher when compared with control animals 24 h after LPS administration. Moreover, diminution of LPS-induced depressive behavior in Gent pre-treatment mice paralleled with reduction in brain pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, it is important to mention that no difference was observed in plasma levels among groups at this time point, indicating disappearance of sickness. Therefore, depressive-like behavior could be estimated without confounding effects of sickness 24 h after LPS challenge. Actually, previous studies have proved that sickness behavior was evident 2 to 6 h after LPS administration and diminished 24 h later (O'Connor et al. ; Guo et al. ). In the present study, LPS-induced sickness response was measured by body weight loss and general behaviors 4 h post-LPS treatment. The body weight loss of LPS-treated mice was 2 g on average compared with that of 0.2 g for control mice. Although Gent treatment did not remarkably prevent the decrease of body weight, mice in Gent group actually behaved more active.
In addition, the different findings observed in plasma and brain cytokines indicate that a single peripheral injection of LPS might lead to long-lasting modifications in brain levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In fact, a study performed by Bossù et al. ( ) also reported that significant increase of TNF-α in the frontal cortex and hippocampus was maintained until 10 month after a single intraperitoneal injection of 5 mg/kg LPS. Furthermore, another report stated microglia may remain activated for several months and release pro-inflammatory cytokines once activated, which might explain persistent elevated levels of IL-1β and TNF-α in brain areas (Patel ).
Noteworthy, an excess of pro-inflammatory cytokines in central nervous system (CNS) could influence the pathways involved in depression (Young et al. ). In particular, over activation of the tryptophan-degrading enzyme IDO is recognized as a pivotal mechanism (Fu et al. ; Patel ; Dobos et al. ). Accordingly, brain concentrations of tryptophan and its metabolite kynurenine were determined using LC-MS/MS in the present study, and enzymatic activity of IDO was estimated by kynurenine/tryptophan ratio. The results demonstrated that the rise of both kynurenine concentration and kynurenine/tryptophan ratio was reversed by Gent treatment. This result suggested that Gent partially attenuated LPS-induced depressive-like behavior by reversing the over-activation of tryptophan-degrading pathway. In addition, kynurenine can be further metabolized into quinolinic acid, an NMDA receptor agonist, which may contribute to excitotoxicity as well as cell death in MDD (Guo et al. ). Therefore we have tried to determine the brain level of quinolinic acid. Unfortunately, it is failed to be identified due to the limitation of detection limit. Instead, we examined the protein expression of NMDA receptor subunits in PFC homogenates by western blot analysis. An increase in GluN2B expression, but not in GluN2A expression, was observed in response to LPS challenge. Gent treatment reversed the up-regulation of GluN2B receptors in the PFC. The observed inhibiting effect of Gent on GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors has been described in previous reports. Liu et al. ( ) showed that Gent decreased GluN2B expression in the BLA of reserpine-induced mice accompanied with attenuation of reserpine-induced pain/depression dyad, while Chen et al. ( ) also reported Gent inhibited GluN2B expression and GluN2B-containing NMDA receptor mediated postsynaptic currents in the anterior cingulate cortex of CFA-injected mice. However, NMDA receptor blockade by ketamine abrogated LPS-induced depressive-like behavior, but pro-inflammatory levels remained unaltered (Walker et al. ). Therefore, the results of the present study raise the possibility that Gent exerts its antidepressant effects by inhibiting GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors as well as IDO over-activation, yet we are not able to discard the possibility that Gent alters the expression of GluN2B independent of its anti-inflammatory properties. Further investigations are required to clarify the detailed mechanisms.
In conclusion, the present study provides evidence that systemic Gent administration was effective in abrogating LPS-induced depressive-like behavior in mice, highlighting its therapeutic approach for the treatment of depression. Moreover, Gent might be a multi-target compound and demonstrated antidepressant-like activity by blocking various steps of tryptophan-degrading pathway induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines.
