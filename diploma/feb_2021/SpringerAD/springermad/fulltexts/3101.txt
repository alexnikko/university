Introduction
According to GLOBOCAN 2012, the commonest malignancies in females are of breast, cervix uteri and colo-rectum. As per the statistics of 2015, the number of breast cancer cases was found to be 100,061 as against 94,208 cases of cervical cancer. Thus, breast cancer is now the most common malignancy among Indian women [ , ]. According to National Cancer Registry Programme of India, in 2009–2011, Bangalore ranked the highest in the country (age-adjusted incidence rate or AAR per 100,000 population being 36.6%).
Breast carcinomas that originate from intrinsically ER- and PR-positive luminal cells are designated as ER- and PR-positive carcinomas, respectively [ ]. Additionally, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/neu), a transmembrane cell surface glycoprotein, encoded by an oncogene, CerB2, is expressed at low levels in normal non-neoplastic epithelium. However, its overexpression is commonly evident in primary breast cancer [ ].
The expression of the hormone receptors ER and PR in a patient’s breast cancer is an example of a weak prognostic but a strong predictive biomarker. If a patient’s tumour expresses ER and/or PR, as seen in approximately 70% of invasive breast cancers, we can predict that this patient will likely benefit from endocrine therapy such as tamoxifen. The overexpression of the oncogene Her2 in a patient’s breast cancer is seen in approximately 15–20% of invasive breast cancers and is associated with a diminished prognosis (e.g. higher risk of recurrence); however, it also predicts that a patient will more likely benefit from anthracycline- and taxane-based chemotherapies and directed therapies that target Her2 (trastuzumab). Patients with TNBC do not benefit from hormone- or trastuzumab-based targeted therapies because of the loss of target receptors. Although these patients respond to chemotherapeutic agents such as taxanes and anthracyclines better than other subtypes of breast cancer, prognosis remains poor [ , ].
The combined expression of oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER2/neu has become most informative in the molecular classification of breast tumours and their clinical assessment for treatment and further outcome. Screening for ER, PR and HER2/neu status in breast tumours has become a standard method in determining the appropriate therapy and prognosis of breast cancer patient management throughout the world [ , ].
Recently, a few studies from other parts of the country have emphasized the role of hormone receptor tests in breast cancer [ , , , ]. This is a pioneering study investigating the hormone receptor status in breast cancer in the state of Bihar.
This is a prospective study with the aims and objectives as follows: 1. To evaluate ER, PR and HER2/neu status in newly diagnosed breast cancer patients at a tertiary care centre of Bihar. 2. To compare the pattern of expression with age.
Materials and Methods
This study was carried out at a tertiary care centre in all newly diagnosed cases of invasive breast carcinomas diagnosed from June 2015 to May 2016. All cases of breast lump visiting RCC were examined, and mammography and ultrasound of breast were done. Cases with suspected malignant lump and BIRAD 4/5 underwent trucut biopsy. ER, PR and Her2/neu immunohistochemical analysis was done in all cases of invasive breast cancers. Our cases were predominantly from Bihar and Nepal.
The ER and PR results were screened manually and interpreted as positive when more than 10% of tumour cells showed positive nuclear staining, similar to studies carried out elsewhere [ , ]. The normal epithelial elements served as an internal control. The following method was used to score Her2/neu overexpression: cases showing no membrane immunostaining in less than 10% invasive cancer cells were scored 0, cases with weak and incomplete membrane staining in more than 10% of invasive cancer were scored 1 + cases with complete membrane staining that was weak in intensity but with obvious circumferential distribution in at least 10% of cells were scored 2 + , and finally, cases with strong circumferential membrane staining in more than 10% invasive tumour cells were scored 3 +. Cases with a score of 2 + and 3 + were considered positive.
Patients who received adjuvant trastuzumab ( n = 1) or neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( n = 2) were excluded. We evaluated each patient’s clinicopathological features, molecular biomarkers and clinical outcome. The study protocol was approved by the institutional ethics committee. IHC was used to test for the expression of the following molecular markers: ER, PR and HER2/neu. The routinely formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were sectioned at 4 μm thickness and then used for IHC. Statistical significance was set between P value of less than 0.05 and P less 0.0001. Data were analysed by Chi-square test. Statistical analysis was performed using Epi Info version 6.00.
Result
In the present study, a total of 120 cases of newly diagnosed breast cancer were studied from June 2015 to May 2016 in regional cancer centre of IGIMS, Patna. Out of 120, eight patients underwent repeat biopsy and were lost to follow-up. Four patients had equivocal HER2/neu but could not be confirmed by FISH method due to economic constraints.
The age of the patients ranged from 24 years to 77 years, with a mean age of 47.76 years. The majority of patients were older than 50 years (Table 1 ). Table 1 Age distribution Age group Number of patients Percentage Mean age Standard deviation < 30 06 5 47.76 11.34 30–39 19 15.83 40–49 37 30.83 More than 50 56 46.67
ER expression was seen in 46.28%, and PR, in 31.48% of cases, and Her2/neu positivity, in 35.18% (Table 2 ). ER positivity increased with age, 40% being more than 50 years old. Statistically, PR positivity in different age groups was insignificant. Her2 positivity also increased with age, 48.36% being more than 50 years old (Table 3 ).

Eleven percentage of breast cancer patients were triple-positive, while 33% were triple-negative. 58.3% of triple-positive patients were more than 50 years old. Triple-negative cases increased after 40 years of age (Tables 3 , 4 ). Approximately, 54% patients had both ER and PR absent, while 32.40% patients had both ER- and PR-positive (Table 5 ). Hormone receptor expression in these patients had bimodal age distribution as shown in Table 6 .

Discussion
Determination of ER, PR and Her2/neu is the established procedure in the routine management of breast cancer patients and are advocated in major guidelines. It serves as a predictive factor to predict response to therapeutic and adjuvant hormonal (tamoxifen) or biological target therapy (trastuzumab). ER-positive tumours were considered to have favourable receptor expression, while triple-negative followed by ER-negative tumours were considered to have unfavourable receptor expression [ ].
Our study comprised of 120 cases of invasive breast cancer with a mean age of 47.76 years. Mean age of Indian breast cancer patients is found to be lower when compared to the Western countries with an average difference of one decade [ , ].
Our study showed that 46.28% of cases had positive oestrogen receptor expression, while 31.48% expressed progesterone. This is lower when compared to some Western studies which have reported 73% ER positivity and 58% PR positivity [ ]. A recent study from Mumbai also showed that hormone receptor expression in India is lower compared to the West. [ , ] In our study, the percentage of ER positivity was highest in the age group of > 40 years. PR expression was not found to vary with age. Other studies have found that the percentage of ER positivity increases with age, whereas PR expression does not seem to have any significant variation with age [ , ]. There was a significant positive correlation between the ER and PR expression ( P value .0001). This may be due to ER-dependent PR synthesis.
Her2/neu positivity was present in 35.18% of our cases. In the Western studies, the values ranged from 17 to 27% [ ]. A study from Malaysia showed that 31.5% of breast cancers were Her2/neu-positive [ ]. The frequency of Her2/neu positivity varies among the Indian studies. In a study from Bangalore, South India found 43.2% positivity of Her2/neu by IHC and 25.5% by genomic PCR [ ]. In a recent study from Indore, Central India has found 40.2% of tumours to be Her2/neu-positive [ ]. Another study from Varanasi, North India, revealed it to be 46.3% [ ]. The conventional method has been found to be an inaccurate test for Her2/neu, while fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis is a more specific test. Therefore, the number of Her2-positive breast cancer patients may change if we take into account only the positive cases detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. However, FISH was not performed in our study due to low socio-economic condition of our patients.
The results in our study showed that Her2/neu expression increases with age. No statistically significant correlation was found in positivity of HER2/neu with respect to advancing age ( P value .675). The previous studies have shown a decrease or no correlation with age and Her2/neu positivity [ , ].
The frequency of co-expression of ER and PR with that of Her2/neu is variable as reported by the previous studies. Our study demonstrates an inverse relationship between Her2/neu and ER and PR expression. ER and PR expression was increased in Her2/neu-negative tumours as compared to Her2/neu-positive tumours. The mechanism behind this negative correlation is ER- and PR- dependent downregulation of Her2/neu which involves a complex molecular interaction as reported by Ciocca et al. This may be one reason for Her2/neu overexpressing women, resistant to tamoxifen. Both ER- and Her2/neu-positive tumours have poorer disease-free survival and overall survival when compared to ER-positive and Her2/neu-negative tumours. These findings demonstrate that Her2/neu positivity may be better predictor of response to tamoxifen therapy as compared to ER-positive alone. A significant proportion of tumours in our study with Her2/neu overexpression also showed ER (57.88%) and PR (26.38%) positivity.
The triple-negative breast cancers characterized by a lack of expression of ER, PR and Her2/neu receptors constituted 33% of our cases. Studies from Western countries have showed that triple-negative tumours have constituted 14–29.5% of breast carcinomas [ , , ]. Studies have also shown that triple-negative tumours vary markedly with ethnicity and have documented a higher incidence in African women compared to White women. A recent study of a cohort of women under 55 years of age revealed that triple-negative tumours were the most common breast cancer subtype diagnosed among African–American women accounting for nearly 47%, compared to 22% among the Whites [ ]. The Majority of our triple-negative breast cancer cases (58.3%) occurred in women more than 50 years old. This is in contradiction to some Western studies where triple-negative breast cancer predominantly affects younger women [ ].
Conclusion
Mean age of Indian breast cancer patients is found to be lower when compared to the Western countries with an average difference of one decade, but cancers in younger women of 40 years or less of age have more unfavourable hormone receptor expression and poor prognosis. Hormone receptor expression in Indian patients is lower compared to the West. Percentage of ER positivity increases with age, whereas PR expression does not seem to have any significant variation. Her2/neu expression in this study increases with age. Triple-negative tumour constitutes 30% of the patients. Majority of our triple-negative breast cancer cases (47.25%) occurred in women with more than 50 years of age.
