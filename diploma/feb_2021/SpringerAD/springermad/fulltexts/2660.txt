Introduction
The gyr ( Falco rusticolus ) falcon is a heavily built species of the order Falconiformes inhabiting the Arctic regions of North America, Greenland, Iceland and Eurasia. Males weigh between 961 and 1231 g, while females weigh between 1262 and 2100 g. This species is highly polymorphic in coloration with three main colours: white, grey and charcoal grey. Intermediate morphs of all three colours are also common (Del Hoyo et al. ). The gyr falcon is a very popular and highly valued species in Arab falconry due to its large size and great strength. A relatively large number of individuals from this species are commonly used in different countries in the Middle East in the traditional sport of falconry (Samour ). In 2002, the Government of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) passed Federal Law No 11 adopting, amongst other measures, a complete ban on the import of wild-caught falcons in order to comply with the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) regulations (Soorae et al. ). This prompted the creation of several breeding programmes in the country in order to satisfy the high demand for captive-bred falcons. The veterinary care of such large falcon population has highlighted the need to establish species-specific clinical diagnosis reference values to assess health and disease in the different species (Samour et al. ; Samour and D’Aloia ; Lierz ; Samour et al. ; Wernick et al. , Raghav et al. ).
Great advances have been made in avian medicine and surgery in the past 15 years (Altman et al. ; Olsen and Orosz ; Harrison and Lightfoot ; Coles ; Chitty and Lierz ; Tully et al. ; Doneley ; Samour ; Speer ). The development of novel analytical equipment commonly used in clinical laboratory diagnosis has contributed greatly to advance the medical care provided to birds in captivity.
Hand-held portable clinical analysers (PCA) were originally developed for emergency and critical care in human medicine (Murthy et al. ; Lindemans et al. ; Papadea et al. ; Vanavanan and Chittamma ) but are nowadays widely used in general veterinary clinical practice in dogs (Looney et al. ; Matburger et al. ; Verwaerde et al. ) and horses (Mitten et al. ; Looney et al. ; Silverman and Birks ). The main advantages of PCAs are that these units are cheaper than conventional bench-top analysers, use smaller volumes of whole blood, the units are hand-held, are battery-operated and the results are obtained relatively fast thus providing essential point-of-care clinical laboratory diagnostic data. One main disadvantage of PCAs is the high cost of the consumables compared with those used by conventional bench-top analysers. A comprehensive review on the use and applications of PCAs has been recently published (Luppa et al. ).
PCAs have been used to measure blood gases and selected blood chemistry and haematology values in Caribbean flamingos ( Phoenicopterus ruber ruber ) (Howard and Wack ), red-tailed hawks ( Buteo jamaicensis ) (Heatley et al. ), blue fronted amazon parrots ( Amazona aestiva ) (Paula et al. ), poultry (Steinmetz et al. ; Martin et al. ) and African grey parrots ( Psittacus erithacus ) (Montesinos and Ardiaca ). This information have been obtained through the use of i-STAT® PCAs (Abbott, Princeton, NJ, USA) (Howard and Wack ; Heatley et al. ; Steinmetz et al. ; Paula et al. ; Martin et al. ; Montesinos and Ardiaca ). However, scanty information has been published on blood gases and critical care blood chemistry and haematology in falcon species using either i-STAT analysers (McKinney , Raghav et al. ) or conventional bench-top analysers (Arca-Ruibal et al. ). However, the existing data has been obtained from either saker ( Falco cherrug ) falcons, peregrine ( Falco peregrinus ) falcons and gyr ( Falco rusticolus ) falcon hybrids (Arca-Ruibal et al. ). In addition, similar data has been obtained from gyr falcons, or gyr falcon hybrids, but the values obtained were pooled together (McKinney ). To the knowledge of the authors, there is only one publication on the analysis of blood gases using the i-STAT analyser in clinically normal gyr falcons (Raghav et al. ).
A new PCA system (Enterprise Point of Care System, EPOC, Epocal Inc., Ottawa, Canada) has been introduced recently into the market offering several advantages over other PCAs including the ability to send the results to a computer via a wireless system, an inbuilt scanner to read barcodes on sample tubes, the facility of removing the screen to ease documentation on point-of-care and the test kits do not require refrigeration. The latter advantage makes this system very practical to use under field conditions. This device uses disposable cartridges that can be maintained at room temperature. The cartridges use SmartCard Technology and contain integrated calibration and quality checks and are barcoded for error-free panel identification and lot number and inventory records. The EPOC system has shown favourable results in comparative studies with bench-top analysers in human medicine (Nichols et al. ) and more recently in dogs (West et al. ), but there appear to be no studies on its application in avian medicine in general and falcon medicine in particular.
This paper reports the results of the analyses carried out in order to determine point-of-care blood gases and critical care blood chemistry and haematology reference values in clinically normal captive gyr falcons using the EPOC analyser.
Materials and methods
The birds
A total number of 94 falcons participated in this study and were divided into two different groups. The first group, denominated the hunting group, consisted of 44 gyr falcons, including 35 females and 9 males, 5 to 6 months old. These were newly arrivals into the country or captive-bred falcons hatched at the Falcon Department at Wrsan and were all destined for the sport of falconry. The handling and sampling of these falcons was conducted during September 2013 and 2014 when the falcons had just arrived into the country or were removed from the chambers to begin training. The second group, denominated the breeding group, consisted of 50 gyr falcons, including 26 females and 24 males, 2 to 9 years old. These were part of the captive breeding programme at Wrsan and were handled during the biannual cleaning and servicing of the breeding chambers during the months of June and July 2013. The hunting falcons were housed in large communal holding rooms measuring 10 m × 8 m with air conditioning maintaining the temperature at 18 °C. The breeding falcons were housed free-flying in breeding chambers measuring 8 m long, 5 m wide and 8 m high with air conditioning maintaining the temperature at 18 °C and artificial lighting following a seasonal photoperiod programme. All hunting falcons were fed on defeathered quails ( Coturnix japonica ), while the breeding falcons were fed on defeathered quails, whole day-old chicks ( Gallus gallus domesticus ) and white mice ( Mus musculus ).
Clinical examination
All falcons participating in this study were subjected to a comprehensive physical exam, endoscopy examination and survey radiography in the ventro-dorsal and latero-lateral positions. Samples were also collected for parasitology, haematology, blood chemistry and protein electrophoresis analyses as part of a health assessment. In addition, all the falcons were tested for avian influenza (LilliTest Rapid AIV H5 Ag test Kit, Lillidale Diagnostics, UK) and Newcastle disease (LilliTest Rapid NDV Ag Test Kit, Lillidale Diagnostics UK) using antigen capture test kits. After physical and clinical examination and clinical laboratory diagnosis examination, all falcons participating in the study were declared clinically normal.
Blood sampling
All the falcons were fasted at least 12 h prior to handling and blood sample collection. For falcons integrating the hunting group, the hooded falcons were transported by car from the communal holding rooms to the veterinary clinic (<10 min) and were placed on long floor perches (two falcons per perch) in an air conditioning room and allowed to settle for 30 min to 1 h prior handling. After this period, the falcon was carried on the gloved wrist to the examination room, placed at one end of the examination table, then grabbed and placed in an anaesthetic mask to induce anaesthesia. The time lapse between handling and the blood sampling procedure was less than 2 min. For the breeding group, the keeping staff knocked at the door of the chamber to make disturbance predictable, then one operator entered the chamber and captured the male using a fishing landing net fitted with a padded ring and a long handle. Two operators would then free the falcon from the net, carried it approximately 25 m along a corridor to an examination table and placed the bird on an anaesthetic mask to induce anaesthesia. After completing the blood sampling procedure on the male, the keeping staff would then proceeded to capture and transport the female falcon using a similar procedure than that of the male. The time lapse between knocking at the door and the blood sampling procedure was 4 min for the male and 14 min for the female. Anaesthesia was induced in all falcons using 5 % isoflurane (Aerrane, Baxter, Guayama, Puerto Rico, USA) and maintained using 3 % isoflurane in 1 L of oxygen.
Blood sample was obtained from all falcons from the right basilic ( vena cutanea ulnaris superficialis ) vein using 3 mL disposable syringes and 23 gauge × 5/8 in. disposable needles (Terumo Medical Corporation, Somerset, NJ, USA). After collection, 0.5 to 0.7 mL of blood was mixed immediately with the anti-coagulant agent lithium heparin (1.8 mg/mL of blood) in commercially available storage paediatric 2 mL tubes (Sarstedt AG & Co., Nümbrecht, Germany). Analysis of all samples was carried out in all cases within 2 min of collection.
Clinical laboratory analyses
The samples were analysed using the EPOC system (Epocal Inc., Ottawa, Canada). In order to analyse a sample, the operator first proceeded to load the dedicated disposable cartridge into the analyser. After loading, the analyser performed a calibration test lasting approximately 3 min. Once the calibration was completed, the analyser prompted the operator to load the sample. A total amount of 0.1 to 0.15 mL of whole heparinized blood was dispensed directly from the syringe adaptor tip into the loading bay of the cartridge. After approximately 1 min, all parameters were tested and the results were displayed on the screen and were then stored in the memory of the analyser. The values investigated included per hydron (pH), partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO 2 ), partial pressure of oxygen (pO 2 ), sodium (Na ++ ), potassium (K + ), calcium (Ca ++ ), chloride (Cl − ), glucose (Glu), lactate (Lac), haematocrit (Hct), creatinine (Crea), total carbon dioxide (cTCO 2 ), bicarbonate (cHCO 3 ), base excess at extracellular compartment (BE), oxygen saturation (cSO 2 ), anion gap (AGaPK) and haemoglobin (Hgb).
Statistical analyses
The set of values obtained consisted of 17 analytes including measured and calculated values. The data was analysed using a commercially available statistical programme (SPSS Statistics 17.0, IBM, New York, New York, USA). Statistical analysis of the data obtained was carried out including the arithmetic mean, standard deviation, standard error of mean and the inner limits of the percentiles P2.5th–P97.5th with a probability of 95 % interval. The Shapiro-Wilk’s test was used to determine normality of distribution for each analyte. Inferential statistics for equality of variances using the independent sample Levene’s test was used to determine statistically significant differences between the data from the hunting and breeding falcon groups. After determining the equality of variances, the pooled t test was used to analyse the parametric data while the Welch t test was used to analyse the non-parametric data. The conventional P value of 0.05 was applied, wherein a P value less than 0.05 indicated that significant differences existed between the data from the two groups. Age-related and sex-related differences were beyond the scope of the work in this study.
Results
Tables 1 and 2 show the blood gases and critical blood chemistry and haematology values obtained from the analyses of venous blood samples from clinically healthy captive gyr falcons. Normal distribution was observed for only 5 analytes, pO 2 , Ca++, Hct, cHgb and Cl − , while the data was not normally distributed for 11 analytes, pH, pCO 2 , Na+, K+, Glu, cTCO 2 , cHCO 3 , BE (ecf), cSO 2 , AGaPK and lactate after statistical analyses using the Shapiro-Wilk test. After comparing the variances and mean values obtained from the two groups of falcons using the independent sample Levene’s test and 2-tailed t tests, the results showed that there were significant differences for the mean value of 12 analytes pH, PO 2 , K+, Na+, Ca, Hct, Hgb, cHCO 3 , cTCO 2 , BE, AGaPK and lactate. Conversely, there were no significant differences in the mean value of 4 analytes pCO2, Glu, cSO 2 and Cl − as can be observed in Tables 1 and 2 .

The most distinct finding amongst all analytes was the mean lactate value in the breeding group of 17.14 mmol/L. In this group, there were 21 falcons (42 %) with values over 20 mmol/L. This was over the detection limit of the analyser. In contrast, the hunting group had lower values with a mean value of 2.21 mmol/L. Descriptive statistics of lactate from the breeding group was generated by considering 20 mmol/L as the upper range in the 21 individuals with values in excess of 20 mmol/L. Similarly, the creatinine values obtained were out of range of detection of the analyser. Only 5 (5.3 %) falcons of the 94 cases had a corresponding numerical values; therefore, it was decided to remove this test from the study.
Discussion
The mean pH value of 7.46 from the hunting falcons in this study was slightly lower than the value of 7.49 reported for saker, peregrine and hybrid falcons (Arca-Ruibal et al. ) and very similar to the value of 7.47 obtained in gyr and gyr falcon hybrids (McKinney ) and to the value of 7.48 in gyr falcons (Raghav et al. ). The mean PCO 2 , PO 2 , Na + , K + , Cl − , TCO 2 , HCO 3 , BE and SO 2 values obtained in this study were within range of previously published data for saker, peregrine and hybrid falcons (Arca-Ruibal et al. ) and gyr and gyr falcons hybrids (McKinney ) and gyr falcons (Raghav et al. ). However, the mean glucose values of 17.64 mmol/L in this study were slightly lower than the value of 18.81 mmol/L published for the gyr and gyr falcon hybrids (McKinney ). The mean Hgb value of 13.35 g/dL in the present study was lower than the mean value of 14.31 g/dL in gyr falcons (Raghav et al. ), the mean value of 15.79 g/dL in gyr and gyr falcon hybrids (McKinney ), lower than the mean value of 15.7 g/dL for the saker falcon, lower than the mean value of 16.9 g/dL for the peregrine falcon and lower than the mean value of 16.1 g/dL in hybrid falcons (Arca-Ruibal et al. ). Some of these subtle differences may have been due to the different analytical methods used to examine the samples.
The most important finding of this study was the high mean value of 17.14 mmol/L of lactate in the breeding falcon group. This value was much higher than the mean values of 7.72 mmol/L and upper range (3.94–14.14) reported in the mourning dove ( Zenaida macroura ), 5.74 mmol/L (range 3.09–8.75) for the boat-tailed grackle ( Quiscalus major ) and 4.77 (2.66–12.03) in the house sparrow ( Passer domesticus ) after capture by mist net and banding (Harms and Harms ). Elevation of lactate levels is associated with excessive muscular activity and prolonged handling time leading to lactic acidosis as a result of overexertion. Lactic acidosis is a physiological condition with reduction of pH during the build-up of lactate in the blood. Lactate formation occurs when glucose is metabolized anaerobically. During lactic acidosis, the body restores electroneutrality by buffering with HCO 3 . When HCO 3 is depleted, electroneutrality is achieved further by the release or increase of negative ion chloride to replace the function of HCO 3 (Flaherty and Blackwood ).
In this study, the results highly suggest that stress can influence the pH, cHCO 3 , Cl − , BE (ecf), AGaPK and lactate as these showed significant difference between the two groups. In the present study, the pH value for the breeding group was 7.23 suggesting acidosis while for the hunting group was 7.46 which was close to neutral. The breeding group experienced lactic acidosis, as shown by 21 (42 %) falcons with high lactate levels undetected by the analyser. There was indication of depletion of HCO 3 in the breeding group, with 15.00 mmol/L, in contrast to 26.32 mmol/L of the hunting group and this denotes the buffering of the lactic acidosis. Chloride levels of the breeding group shows a higher level, at 119.06 mmol/L compared to 117.55 mmol/L of the hunting group which could suggest the compensation by chloride ions after depletion of HCO 3 reserve. The BE (ecf) levels which indicates the degree of metabolic dysfunction deviates from the normal only when there is primary metabolic disturbance (Flaherty and Blackwood ) and this was clearly demonstrated by the group mean of the breeding group which was −12.55 mmol/L, in contrast to the group mean 2.55 mmol/L of the hunting group. xAGaPK, which is used to determine the cause of metabolic acidosis, was higher in the breeding group with 22.32 mmol/L than in the hunting group with 12.5 mmol/L suggesting high anion gap acidosis. In the aspect of hypoxia as a trigger to lactic acidosis, the result for pO 2 in this study may not be informative due to the following reasons: (a) venous blood was used, (b) blood samples were exposed to environmental air during transfer from syringe to blood tube and, lastly, (c) the use of supplemental oxygen during induction of anaesthesia.
Ideally, the analytes pCO 2 , cSO 2 and cTCO 2 should be obtained using arterial blood (Brackenbury ) collected into vacuum tubes to prevent dilution of the initial levels of blood gases with that of environmental gases. In this study, transferring blood to a tube could have altered the gas pressures and exchange could have occurred between the blood and air trapped in the tube (Flaherty and Blackwood ). Unfortunately, arterial blood is not easy to obtain in birds due to their high blood pressure and the risk of haemorrhage and haematoma formation. Arterial blood sampling collection may not be feasible in most cases in clinical practice. However, a recent study provided data on blood gases obtained using both arterial and venous blood samples in gyr falcons (Raghav et al. ). The data of blood gases in the current study is considered less informative because venous blood was used, but such results may be more relevant in falcon clinical practice.
The importance of providing temperature-corrected values for pH, PC0 2 and P0 2 has been highlighted (Montesinos and Ardiaca ). However, the built-in temperature correction formula in the i-STAT analyser has not been validated for most avian species, including falcons (Raghav et al. ). The same can be said with regards to the use of EPOC analyser. Therefore, the practical application of providing temperature-corrected values is at present undetermined.
Further investigations should be conducted on the effect of stress during transport and training in order to assess health and disease in falcon patients.
