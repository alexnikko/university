Introduction
Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) comprise 1–3% of all pancreatic neoplasms [ , , ], but reports of asymptomatic PNETs have increased because of recent advances in imaging modalities [ ]. The 2010 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of PNETs indicates that the best predictor of malignant potential is histological grade based on the Ki-67 labeling index, which is obtained by immunohistochemical staining [ ]. Regardless of histological findings, there are two distinct PNET phenotypes—functional and nonfunctional [ ]. Functional PNETs may be associated with genetic abnormality and need careful monitoring [ ].
Because PNETs have metastatic potential, they are regarded as a malignant disease [ ] that requires treatment including curative surgical resection and/or anti-tumor agents [ , , ]. A recent epidemiological survey reported that distant metastases were present at the time of diagnosis in 19.9% of all patients with PNETs [ ]. The liver is a frequent metastatic site, and its involvement has a clinically significant effect on prognosis [ , ]. Given that the best indicator of malignant potential, histological tumor grade, requires tumor tissue for immunohistochemistry, and that there is no reliable tumor marker, a noninvasive marker of the malignant potential of PNETs is urgently needed.
Host inflammatory responses have been shown to be associated with tumor progression in many solid malignancies [ , ], and increases in systemic inflammation have been correlated with poorer cancer-specific survival [ , , ]. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a simple index of systemic inflammation [ ]. An elevated preoperative NLR is associated with poor prognosis in patients with diverse types of malignant tumors [ , , , , , ], but it has not yet been linked to prognosis in patients with PNETs. We previously reported that the NLR could predict the existence of a malignant component in intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) [ ]. Here, we aimed to determine whether the NLR is a predictive biomarker of tumor progression and postoperative oncological outcome in patients with PNETs.
Materials and methods
Patients and data collection
Between April 2001 and October 2015, 60 patients diagnosed with PNETs underwent curative pancreatic resection at the Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Kumamoto University. One patient with coexisting esophageal cancer died and another patient whose NLR could not be measured were excluded. The remaining 58 patients were evaluated. Each patient provided written informed consent before surgery. Tumors were preoperatively evaluated by diagnostic imaging, including endoscopic ultrasonography, abdominal computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. The correlations between NLR and perioperative clinicopathological findings were assessed retrospectively. None of the patients included in this study had a coexisting infectious disease. Blood was collected 2–4 days before surgery, and the NLR was calculated by dividing the absolute neutrophil count by the absolute lymphocyte count. If a patient had more than one tumor, then the diameter of the largest tumor was recorded. PNET histological grade was determined according to the 2010 WHO classification of tumors of the digestive system [ ].
Statistical analysis
All P values were two-sided. Qualitative variables were compared using chi-squared tests, and quantitative variables were compared using Wilcoxon tests. The Kaplan–Meier method and log-rank test were used to assess overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS). Multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of postoperative recurrence and metachronous liver metastasis. The optimal NLR cut-off value for predicting metachronous liver metastasis was determined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis with estimation of the Youden index. JMP Version 11 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) was used for all statistical analyses, with P < 0.05 defined as statistically significant.
Results
NLR increased with increasing PNET grade
Table 1 summarizes the clinicopathological features of the 58 PNET patients. Forty-six patients were diagnosed with grade 1, nine with grade 2, and three with grade 3 tumors. Resection was performed by pancreaticoduodenectomy in 13 patients, distal pancreatectomy in 34 patients, middle pancreatectomy in 1 patient, partial pancreatectomy in 1 patient, and enucleation in 9 patients. The median NLR of all PNET patients was 2.18, and the mean preoperative NLR was significantly higher in patients with grade 3 (3.52 ± 0.67) tumors than in patients with grade 2 (2.23 ± 0.66, P = 0.0150) or grade 1 (1.76 ± 0.52, P < 0.0001) tumors (Fig. 1 ).

ROC curve analysis (AUC = 0.703) found that the optimal NLR cut-off value for the presence of recurrence was 2.4. Consequently, patients were divided into groups with low (<2.4; n = 46) and high (≥2.4; n = 12) NLRs. A high NLR was significantly associated with tumor size ( P = 0.0015) and high WHO tumor grade ( P < 0.0001, Table 2 ). A high preoperative NLR (≥2.4) was significantly associated with both poor OS ( P = 0.0481) and short RFS ( P < 0.0001) after surgery (Fig. 2 ).

NLR is an independent predictor of postoperative recurrence
To evaluate the utility of preoperative NLR to identify patients with postoperative recurrence, Cox proportional hazard analysis was performed with clinical factors and NLR (Table 3 ). Univariate analysis showed that a high NLR (≥2.4) and large tumor size (≥20 mm) were significantly associated with postoperative recurrence. Multivariate analysis revealed that a high NLR (hazard ratio [HR] 6.012, 95% confidence Interval [CI] 1.84–21.2, P = 0.0035) and large tumor size (HR 6.760, 95% CI 1.71–44.9, P = 0.0049) were independent predictors of postoperative recurrence.

NLR is an independent predictor of postoperative liver metastasis
Of all PNET patients, recurrence developed in 12 patients during follow-up—liver metastases occurred in eight patients, remnant pancreas metastasis occurred in one patient, and both liver and lymph node metastases occurred in three patients. Analysis of the relationship between high NLR and specific recurrence patterns found an impact on both liver- and lymph node-specific recurrence (Fig. 3 ). Multivariate analysis revealed that both a high NLR (HR 7.570, 95% CI 2.17–30.2, P = 0.0016) and large tumors (HR 5.634, 95% CI 1.71–44.9, P = 0.0049) were independent predictors of liver metastasis (Table 4 ), but not of lymph node metastasis (data not shown).

Discussion
The current study found that a high preoperative NLR (≥2.4) was significantly associated with high tumor grade and shorter RFS after curative surgery in patients with PNETs. Based on previous reports, only tumor size is accepted to be a noninvasive clinical variable predicting malignant potential of PNETs. It was reported that radiographic calcification, which was observed in 16%, was independently associated with synchronous liver metastasis [ ]. The 2014 clinical practice guidelines of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommended surgical treatment for PNET patients with curatively resectable tumors >1 cm [ ]. Since tumor markers are not available for PNETs, a tissue sample is necessary to understand the biology of the tumor. Therefore, noninvasive markers predicting malignant potential of the tumor would be of great importance. We previously reported that the NLR specifically predicted malignant potential in IPMNs, most of which are pathologically benign [ ]. However, there are no reports suggesting the role of the NLR in patients with PNETs.
Previous studies reported that the NLR was correlated with inflammatory markers including C-reactive protein (CRP), or inflammation due to obstructive pancreatitis and cholangitis. However, the NLR was not significantly associated with CRP value ( P = 0.1572). Moreover, no patient had obstructive pancreatitis assessed by the pathologist (YK). These findings suggested that the NLR might represent tumor-specific inflammation in patients with PNETs, in contrast to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma [ ].
Previous investigations have assessed the prognostic impact of the NLR in patients with many types of solid tumors [ , , , , , ]. In this series, patients with a high preoperative NLR had significantly worse OS and RFS than those with a low NLR. Moreover, an NLR ≥2.4 was an independent predictor of postoperative liver metastasis. Intriguingly, an NLR ≥2.4 was also an independent predictor of postoperative liver metastasis even in G1/G2 patients (data not shown). Patients with a high NLR (≥2.4), even though their histological grade is low, might thus be recommended for careful follow-up after surgical resection. Of note, the only patient who had a small (<20 mm) stage G1 tumor and a high NLR (≥2.4) recurred with a postoperative liver metastasis. Since histological grade is known as a crucial factor of PNET malignancy, multivariate analysis for postoperative recurrence was also performed with histological grade. Consequently, histological grade, but not the NLR, was an independent factor predicting postoperative recurrence (data not shown). The NLR is highly correlated with high histological grade and thereby could be a predictor of grade. We intended to explore the useful preoperative factor predicting oncological outcome without tissue examination in the current study. Thus, histological grade is a clinically pivotal factor to predict disease progression, if it is available.
In conclusion, this is the first report suggesting that an NLR ≥2.4 is useful as a predictor of postoperative recurrence and liver metastasis in patients with PNETs. Consistent with WHO guideline, tumor size was also found to be a pivotal factor predicting tumor progression. The NLR is easy to obtain, and noninvasive. The results warrant further analysis in larger groups of patients to more accurately define the clinical utility of the NLR in PNETs.
