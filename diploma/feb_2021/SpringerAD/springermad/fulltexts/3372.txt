Introduction
Atherosclerosis is a chronic arterial disease that affects large- and medium-size arteries, leading to cardiovascular diseases [ ]. Retention of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol is its earlier step of development, and recruitment of monocytes into aortas and formation of foam cells are its hallmarks [ ]. Accumulating evidence has suggested that the proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are important pathological responses during atherosclerotic neointima formation [ ]. Development of novel medicines which hold the potential to inhibit the aberrant proliferation and migration of VSMCs is urgently needed in the therapies of atherosclerosis.
Blueberry is one of the major commercially cultivated berries, and its health beneficial effects have been widely documented [ , ]. Anthocyanins (ACNs), a largest group of water-soluble pigments, are rich in blueberries and other fruits and possess a wide range of biological activities, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor activities [ , ]. High intake of blueberries has been noted to protect against the development of atherosclerosis [ , ]. Cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G) is a member of ACN family, whose neuro- and hepato-protective effects have been reported in many previous studies [ , ]. Notably, Speciale and colleagues have found that C3G pretreatment can attenuate tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-induced endothelial dysfunction [ ]. This previous study reveals antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of C3G and suggests a therapeutical potential of C3G in diseases associated with inflammation and oxidative stress. Overproduction of inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α can enhance the migration and proliferation of VSMCs, which in turn results in intimal thickening [ ]. The migrated VSMCs in intima can produce extracellular matrix (ECM) to make a fibrous cap, exacerbating atherosclerosis [ ]. Interestingly, a study from Luo et al. [ ] has shown that the pretreatment of C3G can suppress TNF-α-stimulated proliferation of mouse VSMCs in dose- and time-dependent manners. However, whether and how C3G affects the cell apoptosis and migration in TNF-α-stimulated VSMCs remain poorly understood and require for further investigations.
The aim of this study was to explore the effects of C3G on the apoptosis and migration of rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMCs) exposed to recombinant TNF-α in vitro. Also, the underlying mechanisms were studied.
Materials and Methods
Cell Culture and Treatments
Primary RASMCs were isolated from 8-week-old male Sprague Dawley rats accordingly to previously reported protocols [ , ]. Protocols and studies involving animals were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee of Shenyang Agricultural University. Briefly, the thoracic aortas were obtained from anesthetized rats, cut into 1–3 mm 2 small pieces and then incubated in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) containing 10 % FBS (HyClone, Logan, UT, USA) and 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 g/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified 95 % air/5 % CO 2 atmosphere. The growth of muscle cells was observed under a light microscope (Motic Medical Diagnostic Systems Co, Ltd, XiaMen, China). Cells of over 70 % confluence were subcultured and subjected to immunofluorescence staining against α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA).
C3G and recombinant rat TNF-α were purchased from Dalian Meilun Biotech Co, Ltd (HPLC ≥ 98 %; Dalian, China) and PeproTech Inc (HPLC ≥ 98 %; Rocky Hill, NJ, USA), respectively. The isolated RASMCs were pretreated with 25, 50 or 100 μM C3G for 2 h and then stimulated with 10 ng/ml TNF-α for additional 24 h.
Proliferation Assay
The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was performed to evaluate the proliferation rates of RASMCs in different groups according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In short, cells (2 × 10 3 cells per well) were seeded in 96-well plates, allowed to grow overnight and then treated with C3G and/or TNF-α as described before. Then, these cells were incubated with 0.2 mg/ml MTT (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 4 h. Thereafter, the formazan crystals were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma) and assessed by measuring the absorbance at 490 nm using an ELX-800 microplate reader (BioTeke, Winooski, VT, USA).
Flow Cytometry Analysis of Cell Apoptosis
The apoptotic cells were identified with an Annexin V-FITC/PI Apoptosis Detection Kit (Wanlei, Shenyang, China) by flow cytometry. In short, cells in different groups were harvested, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Double-Helix, Shanghai, China) and then suspended in 500 μl binding buffer. Thereafter, these cells were stained with 5 μl annexin V-FITC and 5 μl propidium iodide (PI) in the dark at room temperature (RT) for 15 min and then analyzed on a FACS Calibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Baltimore, MD, USA).
Transwell Insert Assay
Transwell inserts (8-μm pore size; Corning, Acton, MA, USA) were used for measurement of RASMC migration in vitro. Briefly, cells (2 × 10 4 ) treated with C3G and/or TNF-α were resuspended in 200 μl serum-free DMEM and placed in the upper chambers of transwell inserts precoated with Matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) in 24-well plates, whereas 800 μl DMEM containing 20 % FBS was added into the lower chamber. Twenty-four hours later, the migrated cells were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde at RT for 20 min and then stained with hematoxylin for 5 min. Cell migration was determined by counting the migrated cells in five random visual fields of each well under a light microscopy (Motic Medical Diagnostic Systems Co, Ltd; 200×).
RNA Extraction and Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
Total RNAs were isolated from cell lysates with a RNA Simple Total RNA Kit (TianGEN, Beijing, China) and then processed for cDNA synthesis with a Super M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase Kit (BioTeke). Quantitative real-time PCR of each sample was carried out on the Exicycler 96 Real-Time Quantitative Thermal block (Bioneer, Daejeon, Korea). The mRNA expression levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 were calculated by 2 −△△CT method. β-Actin was used as the endogenous control. The primer pairs used in the experiment were as follows: MMP-2-F, 5′-GGAAGCATCAAATCGGACTG-3′; MMP-2-R, 5′-GGATACGGTCAGCACCTTTC-3′; MMP-9-F, 5′-GAATCACGGAGGAAGCCAAT-3′; MMP-9-R, 5′-TAGCCCCAACTTATCCAGACT-3′.
Protein Extraction and Western Blot Analysis
Cells were lysed in the same volume NP-40 (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) of 1 % phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Beyotime) to extract the total proteins. In order to detect the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) subunit p65, cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were first separated with a Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Protein Extraction Kit (Beyotime). Concentrations of all protein samples were determined with a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Beyotime). The protein sample of same amount in each well was separated on the SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). These membranes were then blocked with 5 % non-fat milk for 1 h and then incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against cleaved caspase-3 (1:1000 diluted; ab2302; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), cleaved caspase-9 (1:1000 diluted; ab2325; Abcam), Bax (1:1000 diluted; BA0315; Boster, Wuhan, China), Bcl-2 (1:1000 diluted; BA0412; Boster), MMP-2 (1:1000 diluted; BA0569; Boster), MMP-9 (1:1000 diluted; BA2202; Boster), inhibitor of NF-κB-α (IκBα; 1:1000 diluted; bs-1287R; Bioss, Beijing, China), phosphorylated IκBα (p-IκBα; 1:500 diluted; bs-5515R; Bioss) and NF-κB p65 (1:1000 diluted; BA0610; Boster) at 4 °C overnight. Then, the membranes were incubated with goat anti-rabbit horse reddish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5000 diluted; Beyotime). Thereafter, the protein blots were visualized with a ECL Detection System Kit (Seven-sea pharmtech Co, Ltd, Shanghai, China), quantified by the Gel-Pro-Analyzer software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD, USA) and normalized to β-actin or histone H3.
Gelatin Zymography Assay
The activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were analyzed with gelatin zymography assay. In brief, equal volume of cell-free culture supernatant was collected from each sample and then subjected to electrophoresis on 10 % polyacrylamide gels containing 1 mg/ml gelatin (Sigma) for 2.5 h. Thereafter, the gels were denatured in 2.5 % Triton X-100 (Amresco, Cleveland, Ohio, USA), washed with 50 mmol/l Tris–HCl and then stained with 0.05 % Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 (Amresco). Finally, the gelatinolytic activities were quantified with a scanning densitometer (BioTeke).
Immunofluorescence Assay
The RASMCs were allowed to grow on glass disks in 24-well plates, treated with C3G and/or TNF-α, fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Beijing Co, Ltd, Beijing, China) and then incubated with 0.1 % TritonX-100 (Amresco) at RT for 30 min. After blocking with goat serum (Solarbio, Beijing, China), these cells were incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against NF-κB p65 (1:100 diluted) and α-SMA (1:100 diluted; bs-10196R; Bioss) at 4 °C overnight. Thereafter, these cells were incubated with Cy3- or FITC-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:200 diluted; A0516 or A0562; Beyotime) at RT for 1 h. Finally, cells were counterstained with DAPI (Sigma) and photographed under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan; 400×).
Data Analysis
All data were represented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD), and the differences among groups were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Bonferroni post hoc test. A P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
C3G Inhibited Cell Proliferation and Induced Apoptosis in TNF-α-Treated RASMCs
Cells were isolated from the dissected rat aortic tissues as described before and confirmed as RASMCs with immunofluorescence assay against α-SMA. The results showed that the isolated cells were almost positively stained with α-SMA. The expression of α-SMA was relatively restricted to VSMCs (Supplementary Fig. 1a). In accordance with a previous study [ ], results from MTT assay indicated that the pretreatment of C3G could inhibit the proliferation of TNF-α-treated RASMCs (Supplementary Fig. 1b). However, C3G alone did not affect RASMC viability, even at the maximum tested dose (Supplementary Fig. 1b).
Next, we investigated whether C3G exerted its anti-proliferative effects through mediation of RASMC apoptosis. Results from flow cytometry analysis showed that RASMCs pretreated with C3G underwent obvious apoptosis when challenged with TNF-α (Fig. 1 a). The apoptotic index in TNF-α-treated cells was increased with C3G doses (25, 50, 100 μM = 18.66 ± 1.19 %, 27.15 ± 4.47, 40.64 ± 6.65 %; Fig. 1 b). Additionally, the protein expression levels of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and pro-apoptotic Bax and cleaved caspase-3/caspase-9 were examined by Western blot assessment. As shown in Fig. 2 , the pretreatment of C3G increased the expression of Bax and cleaved caspase-3/caspase-9, whereas decreased Bcl-2 in cells stimulated with TNF-α in a dose-accumulation fashion (Fig. 2 ). C3G (100 μM) alone had no detectable effects on these apoptosis-related proteins in RASMCs. These results suggested a novel pro-apoptotic effect of C3G on RASMCs stimulated with the pro-inflammatory mediator TNF-α in vitro. Fig. 1 C3G pretreatment induced apoptosis in TNF-α-treated RASMCs.

C3G Inhibited the Migration of TNF-α-Treated RASMCs
Transwell assay was applied to determine the effects of C3G on RASMC migration. Our results illustrated that the TNF-α stimulation significantly enhanced the migration of RASMCs (Blank control group vs. TNF-α alone group = 26.00 ± 3.54 vs. 78.60 ± 7.86; Fig. 3 ). While pretreatment of C3G alone had no detectable effects on the migration of control RASMCs, C3G could inhibit TNF-α-induced cell migration in a dose-dependent manner (25, 50, 100 μM = 59.00 ± 6.56, 45.40 ± 4.77, 36.20 ± 4.38; Fig. 3 ). Additionally, the expression levels and activities of MMP-2/MMP-9 were detected in cells from different groups. Results from quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot analyses illustrated that TNF-α treatment could induce significant mRNA and protein expression increases in these two MMPs (Fig. 4 ). However, these changes were partly reversed by C3G pretreatment (Fig. 4 ). Similar inhibitory effects of C3G on MMP activities were observed in gelatin zymography assay (Fig. 4 ). The above results indicated that MMP-2 and MMP-9 were involved in C3G’s inhibitory effects on TNF-α-induced migration of RASMCs.

C3G Inhibited the Activation of NF-κB in TNF-α-Treated RASMCs
It has been reported that the aberrant activation of the NF-κB signaling is associated with the abnormal proliferation and migration of VSMCs in atherosclerosis [ ]. Therefore, we investigated whether the pretreatment of C3G could affect NF-κB signaling transduction in isolated RASMCs by performing immunofluorescence assay and Western blot analysis. Our data revealed that the administration of C3G could inhibit TNF-α-induced NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation and IκBα phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner, while no significant effects of high-dose C3G (100 μM) pretreatment were observed in the control cells (Fig. 5 ).

Discussion
It has been widely accepted that the dysregulation of VSMC proliferation and migration stimulated by inflammatory mediators (such as TNF-α) is implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis [ ]. In the present study, we first confirmed that TNF-α could enhance RASMC proliferation and migration in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the pretreatment of C3G induced significant apoptosis in TNF-α-stimulated RASMCs and inhibited their migration in a dose-dependent manner in vitro.
TNF-α is an established pro-atherosclerotic factor that can induce abnormal proliferation of VSMCs in atherosclerotic lesions [ , ]. Our data first showed that TNF-α-stimulated RASMC proliferation was markedly suppressed by C3G pretreatment, supporting the previous results obtained from mouse VSMCs [ ]. Of note, apoptosis of VSMCs occurs at low levels in atherosclerotic plaques, and the induction of VSMC apoptosis can promote the fibrous cap thinning during atherogenesis [ ]. Interestingly, both anti- [ ] and pro-apoptotic [ ] effects of C3G in vitro have been reported before. Some studies have illustrated that TNF-α can induce apoptosis in VSMCs, while others found no pro-apoptotic activity for TNF-α in these cells [ , ]. In the present study, we found no pro-apoptotic effects of 10 ng/ml recombinant TNF-α on RASMCs. Moreover, more TNF-α-stimulated RASMCs were noted to undergo apoptosis when pretreated with C3G, implying a pro-apoptotic effect of C3G in inflammatory cytokine-stimulated VSMCs. Since upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins and downregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins can induce apoptosis and acute regression of vascular lesions [ , ], we next analyzed the expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins in RASMCs. Caspase-3 is a pivotal executioner caspase that can be activated by cleaved caspase-9 and has long been considered as a key protease involved in cell apoptosis [ ]. Mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) enables the release of cell death factors such as cytochrome c into the cytoplasm, thus leading to caspase activation [ , ]. The B cell lymphoma (BCL)-2 family members control the tightly regulated pathway that causes MOMP [ ]. In this study, we found that the expression levels of pro-apoptotic Bax, cleaved caspase-9 and caspase-3 in TNF-α-stimulated RASMCs were upregulated by C3G pretreatment, whereas that of pro-survival Bcl-2 was downregulated. An earlier study detailing that C3G induces caspase-3 activation in cancer cells [ ] supports our present results. In addition, we also found that the pretreatment of higher dose C3G (100 μM) alone did not cause apoptosis in control RASMCs, suggesting that C3G administration had no detectable cytotoxic effects on RASMCs under physiological conditions. Nonetheless, the underlying mechanisms by which C3G induces RASMC apoptosis under inflammatory circumstances need to be further explored.
TNF-α treatment not only induces the proliferation of VSMCs but also promotes their migration by stimulating the secretion of MMPs, such as MMP-2 and MMP-9 [ , ]. Our study confirmed that TNF-α treatment could stimulate more RASMCs to migrate through the transwell insert membranes. However, this TNF-α-stimulated cell migration was suppressed by C3G pretreatment. Several previously reported studies showing inhibitory effects of C3G on cancer cell migration [ , ] also support our results. Furthermore, our data indicated that the expression levels and activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in RASMCs were upregulated by TNF-α stimulation, but downregulated by C3G pretreatment. Similar inhibitory effects of C3G on MMP-2 production in A549 lung cancer cells have been observed by Chen et al. [ ]. Taken together, our results revealed novel inhibitory effects of C3G on inflammatory mediator-induced migration of VSMCs in vitro.
NF-κB signaling transduction that can be activated by TNF-α is considered to be involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis [ ]. On stimulation, IκBα, the inhibitory subunit of NF-κB, is phosphorylated on two serine residues, thus initiating the release of p65/p50 heterodimer from inactive cytoplasmic complex [ ]. Endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells are essential cells of the vasculature [ ], and their dysregulation commonly occurs during the development of atherosclerosis [ ]. A study illustrating potent inhibitory effects of C3G on NF-κB signaling transduction in lipopolysaccharide-challenged human umbilical vein endothelial cells [ ] promotes us to examine C3G’s effects on this signaling pathway in VSMCs. We here for the first time observed that C3G pretreatment could inhibit TNF-α-induced phosphorylation of IκBα and suppress the nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 in RASMCs. Since NF-κB family members play important roles in activating MMPs [ ], further experiments are needed to investigate whether C3G reduces MMP production by inhibiting NF-κB pathway.
In conclusion, our study demonstrates that C3G pretreatment is able to induce cell apoptosis and inhibit cell migration in TNF-α-challenged RASMCs in vitro, at least partly by suppressing NF-κB signaling activation.
