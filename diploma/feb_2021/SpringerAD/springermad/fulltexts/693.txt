Introduction
Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), consisting of aspirin and a P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor, is pivotal for patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) [ , ]. Clopidogrel is the most widely prescribed P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor for DAPT, and is a prodrug requiring activation by cytochrome P450 (CYP450) 2C19 enzyme [ ]. CYP2C19 polymorphism is one of the major documented causes of clopidogrel response variability [ , ]. CYP2C19 *1 is the wild-type allele, and CYP2C19 *17 variant is the gain-of-function (GOF) allele (frequency 3%–21%) identified to be an independent factor of increased bleeding risks [ , ]. CYP2C19 *2, *3, *4, *5, *6, *7 , and *8 variants are loss-of-function (LOF) alleles (frequency 15%–35%) associated with increased risks of stent thrombosis and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) [ , ].
Prasugrel and ticagrelor are new generation P2Y 12 receptor inhibitors, and the drug metabolism is not influenced by CYP2C19 polymorphism [ ]. Clinical trials revealed that prasugrel and ticagrelor significantly reduced MACE but increased risk of bleeding complications when comparing to clopidogrel [ , ]. US Food and Drug Administration and Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium both recommend prasugrel or ticagrelor for patients with CYP2C19 LOF allele(s), yet recommendations for GOF allele carriers are lacking [ , ].
Most pharmacogenetic-guided antiplatelet treatment strategies targeted at selecting CYP2C19 LOF allele(s) carriers to receive alternative P2Y 12 inhibitor (prasugrel or ticagrelor), and non-LOF carriers to receive clopidogrel [ , , ]. The non-LOF carriers who carry GOF allele are at increased risk of bleeding complications on clopidogrel therapy. Bleeding complications could lead to a high incidence of death, especially in the first 30 days [ ]. To reduce the bleeding risk of DAPT, GOF allele carriers might benefit from receiving alternative P2Y 12 inhibitor (prasugrel or ticagrelor). Applying both CYP2C19 LOF and GOF alleles in the genotype-guided treatment strategy could potentially optimize the benefits and risks of DAPT. In the present study, we aimed to examine the clinical and economic outcomes of CYP2C19 LOF and GOF-guided management of antiplatelet therapy in patients with ACS undergoing PCI.
Methods
Decision-Analytic Model
A life-long decision-analytic model was designed to simulate the outcomes of a hypothetical cohort of 60-year-old patients with ACS undergoing PCI, managed by three antiplatelet strategies (Fig. 1 ): (1) universal clopidogrel (75 mg daily), (2) universal alternative P2Y 12 inhibitor (prasugrel 10 mg daily or ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily), (3) CYP2C19 LOF and GOF-guided antiplatelet therapy (LOF/GOF-guided therapy). Direct medical costs, clinical event rates (including MACE, stent thrombosis, and major bleeding) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained were primary outcomes of the model. Fig. 1 Simplified decision-analytic model. ACS: acute coronary syndrome; PCI: percutaneous coronary intervention; LOF/GOF-guided therapy: CYP2C19 loss-of-function and gain-of-function allele-guided therapy; IHD: ischemic heart disease; MI: myocardial infarction
The present model consisted of a decision tree model for one-year DAPT, followed by a life-long Markov model for maximum of 30 years with yearly cycle. Patients in all three groups would receive a loading dose of clopidogrel 600 mg prior to PCI and one-year DAPT (aspirin 75-162 mg plus a P2Y 12 inhibitor). In the universal clopidogrel and LOF/GOF-guided groups, patients were categorized by CYP2C19 genotype as carriers and non-carriers of LOF allele(s). Non-carriers of LOF allele were further divided into two subgroups: GOF allele carriers ( *17/*1, *17/*17 ) and wild-type patients ( *1/*1 ). In the universal clopidogrel arm, patients would not be genotyped and all patients would receive clopidogrel 75 mg daily. The probabilities of MACE, stent thrombosis and major bleeding in the universal clopidogrel group would be estimated according to the risk of events for different CYP2C19 genotypes. In the LOF/GOF-guided arm, patients would receive CYP2C19 genotype testing. Wild-type patients would receive standard dosing clopidogrel 75 mg daily, while GOF allele carriers and LOF allele carriers would receive alternative P2Y 12 inhibitor (prasugrel 10 mg daily or ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily). In the universal alternative P2Y 12 inhibitor group, all patients would receive prasugrel 10 mg daily or ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily. During the first year, patients in all three groups might die from cardiovascular cause or fatal bleeding, while survivors might experience no event, nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis (if a stent was placed), or nonfatal bleeding. Survivors of one-year decision tree model would enter the life-long Markov model.
Health state transitions in the Markov model were adapted from a model of antiplatelet therapy previously developed by Main et al. [ ]. Survivors (except patients with nonfatal myocardial infarction) entered the Markov model in the state of ischemic heart disease. In each yearly cycle, patients might either experience no event (remain ischemic heart disease), acute myocardial infarction or death. Survivors of acute myocardial infarction had a high one-year mortality rate, and those who survived during the first year post-acute myocardial infarction would enter “post myocardial infarction” state until they died from all causes.

The one-year rates of MACE (nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death) and stent thrombosis for patients receiving clopidogrel were pooled from event rates of two clopidogrel groups (total patient number = 16,086) in TRITON-TIMI 38 (Therapeutic Outcomes by Optimizing Platelet Inhibition with Prasugrel–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) and PLATO (Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes) trials [ , ]. The hazard ratios of non-carriers of LOF allele versus general patients and hazard ratios of carriers versus non-carriers of LOF allele for MACE and stent thrombosis were estimated from TRITON-TIMI 38 sub-study on clopidogrel responsiveness in carriers and non-carriers of CYP2C19 LOF alleles [ ].
The bleeding events were defined as non–coronary artery bypass graft surgery-related TIMI major bleeding (nonfatal and fatal bleeding) with haemoglobin drop ≥5 g/dl [ ]. A prospective clinical study on clopidogrel treatment in patients with PCI ( n = 820) assessed the impact of CYP2C19 GOF and LOF alleles on on-treatment platelet reactivity and bleeding events [ ]. The prevalence of LOF allele carriers (27.8%), percentage of GOF allele carriers among non-LOF allele carriers (40.6%), major bleeding rate in patients with *1/*1 genotype (2%) and hazard ratio of GOF allele carriers ( CYP2C19 *17/*1, *17/*17 ) versus patients with *1/*1 genotype on major bleeding (2.7; 95% CI: 1.1–7.0) reported in this study were adopted as model inputs.
For patients receiving alternative P2Y 12 inhibitor, the event rates (MACE, stent thrombosis, and major bleeding) were estimated by the rates of general patients receiving clopidogrel and corresponding odds ratios of alternative P2Y 12 inhibitors (prasugrel and ticagrelor) versus clopidogrel reported in a meta-analysis of 12 clinical trials [ ].
Based on the cumulative Kaplan-Meier estimates of primary study end points in the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial [ ], bleeding events and cardiovascular death were estimated to occur on day 14, and nonfatal myocardial infarction or nonfatal stroke occurred around the first month. The probabilities of health state transitions in the Markov model were adapted from a model designed by Main et al. [ ] using surviving data from the Nottingham Heart Attack Register.
Utility and Costs Inputs
The utility scores of ischemic heart disease, nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death, and disutility scores of ischemic heart disease, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal bleeding were retrieved from the US Medical Expenditure Panel Survey [ ]. The disutility of stent thrombosis was assumed to be similar to nonfatal myocardial infarction [ ]. The life-long QALYs gained were the summation of QALYs of all health states experienced by the patient. The QALYs gain (or loss) of each health state = utility (or disutility) score of a health state multiplied by life-years spent in this state. The QALYs of stroke survivors who experienced ischemic heart disease or myocardial infarction were estimated by the sum of utility score of nonfatal stroke and disutility of ischemic heart disease (or myocardial infarction).
The cost analysis was conducted from the perspective of US healthcare provider. One-time costs of nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, cardiovascular death, major bleeding, and PCI were derived from the diagnosis-related group data [ ]. The cost of ischemic heart disease treatment was retrieved from a cost-analysis on one-year cost of ischemic heart disease in patients with ACS using claims database [ ]. The CYP2C19 genotype testing cost (USD 200; range USD 50–350) was estimated from a recent economic evaluation of genotype-guided antiplatelet therapy [ ]. The monthly cost of generic clopidogrel (USD 12; range USD 6–18) and alternative P2Y 12 inhibitor (prasugrel or ticagrelor, USD 141; range USD 120–171) were estimated from US retail price [ ]. All costs and QALYs were discounted to year 2016 with an annual rate of 3%.
Cost-Effectiveness Analysis and Sensitivity Analysis
Cost-effectiveness and sensitivity analyses were conducted by TreeAge Pro 2015 (TreeAge Software Inc., Williamstown, MA) and Microsoft Excel 2013 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA). A strategy would dominate (and be preferred over) other options when it gained higher QALYs at lower cost. If an option cost more to save QALYs, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated using the equation: Δcost/ΔQALYs. Using USD 50,000 per QALY as the threshold of willingness-to-pay (WTP) [ ], the most effective strategy with ICER less than the WTP threshold was considered to be the preferred option.
Sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine the robustness of model results. One-way sensitivity analysis was performed over parameter ranges (95%CI or ±20% of base-case values) to identify influential inputs (and corresponding threshold values, if any) on the base-case results. To evaluate the impact of all variables simultaneously, probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed with10,000 Monte Carlo simulations by randomly drawing each of model inputs from the specified probability distribution (Table 1 ).
Results
Base-Case Analysis
The one-year event rates of MACE, stent thrombosis, and major bleeding in each study arm are listed in Table 2 . The universal alternative P2Y 12 inhibitor group had the lowest rates of nonfatal myocardial infarction (5.62%) and stent thrombosis (1.2%), but the highest rate of major bleeding (3.27%) and nonfatal stroke (0.91%). The LOF/GOF-guided arm had the lowest rates of nonfatal stroke (0.72%), cardiovascular death (2.42%), and major bleeding (2.73%).

The life-long cost and QALYs of each antiplatelet strategy are shown in Table 3 . Of the three antiplatelet strategies, LOF/GOF-guided therapy gained the highest QALYs (7.5301 QALYs) at lowest cost (USD 76,450) and was therefore the preferred strategy. Comparing the two universal treatment arms, the universal alternative P2Y 12 inhibitor was more effective (by 0.0487 QALYs) and costly than universal clopidogrel (by USD 1,390). With an ICER (28,542 USD/QALY) below WTP threshold (50,000 USD/QALY), the universal alternative P2Y 12 inhibitor was cost-effective compared to universal clopidogrel.

Sensitivity Analysis
One-way sensitivity analysis found the base-case results to be sensitive to two model variables: Hazard ratio of cardiovascular death in carriers versus non-carriers of LOF allele receiving clopidogrel (4.79; range 1.4–16.37) and hazard ratio of cardiovascular death in non-carriers of LOF allele versus general patients receiving clopidogrel (0.482; range 0.186–0.898).
The variation of the cost and QALYs of each strategy against hazard ratio of cardiovascular death in carriers versus non-carriers of LOF allele are shown in Fig. 2 a, b, respectively. The universal alternative P2Y 12 inhibitor was dominated (more costly and less QALYs gained) by LOF/GOF-guided therapy throughout the range of this hazard ratio (1.4–16.37). Compared to universal clopidogrel, LOF/GOF-guided therapy was more costly and gained higher QALYs when the hazard ratio was higher than 14.42, and LOF/GOF-guided therapy remained the preferred option with ICER below the WTP threshold (50,000 USD/QALY). When the hazard ratio ranged between 2.26 and 14.42, LOF/GOF-guided therapy was the preferred option with lower cost and higher QALYs gained. When the hazard ratio was less than 2.26, universal clopidogrel was more costly and gained higher QALYs than LOF/GOF-guided therapy. LOF/GOF-guided therapy remained as the preferred option when the hazard ratio ranged between 1.94 and 2.26 because the ICER of universal clopidogrel versus LOF/GOF-guided therapy exceeded the WTP threshold in this range. Universal clopidogrel would be preferred option with ICER below the WTP threshold if the hazard ratio was lower than 1.94. Fig. 2 a Cost and b QALYs of each strategy against hazard ratio of cardiovascular death in carriers versus non-carriers of LOF allele receiving clopidogrel. LOF/GOF-guided therapy: CYP2C19 loss-of-function and gain-of-function allele-guided therapy; QALY: quality-adjusted life-year; HR: hazard ratio
LOF/GOF-guided therapy remained the least costly strategy (Fig. 3 a) throughout the variation of hazard ratio of cardiovascular death in non-carriers of LOF allele versus general patients receiving clopidogrel (range 0.186 to 0.898). When this hazard ratio was higher than 0.85, universal alternative P2Y 12 gained higher QALYs than LOF/GOF-guided therapy (Fig. 3 b ), yet the ICER of the universal alternative P2Y 12 inhibitor exceeded the WTP threshold and LOF/GOF-guided therapy remained as the preferred option. When the hazard ratio ranged between 0.27 and 0.85, LOF/GOF-guided therapy was less costly and gained higher QALYs than the two universal arms, and LOF/GOF-guided therapy was the preferred option. When the hazard ratio was less than 0.27, universal clopidogrel gained higher QALYs than LOF/GOF-guided therapy, and universal clopidogrel would be preferred (ICER below the WTP threshold) if the hazard ratio was lower than 0.25. Fig. 3 a Cost and b QALYs of each strategy against hazard ratio of cardiovascular death in non-carriers of LOF allele versus general patients receiving clopidogrel. LOF/GOF-guided therapy: CYP2C19 loss-of-function and gain-of-function allele-guided therapy; QALY: quality-adjusted life-year; HR: hazard ratio
To further explore the impact of genotype testing cost, an extended cost range was examined in one-way sensitivity analysis. The universal alternative P2Y 12 inhibitor would become a preferred strategy when the genotyping cost was higher than USD 4,209. The impact of lowering monthly cost of the alternative P2Y 12 inhibitor was also examined using cost range of USD 12–141 (lower cost limit = monthly cost of generic clopidogrel), and no threshold value was found in one-way sensitivity analysis. To examine the effect of extreme prevalence of LOF allele carriers and GOF allele carriers, we extended both prevalence rates over 0% to 100%. Universal clopidogrel would become the preferred strategy if LOF allele prevalence was lower than 11.6%. The universal alternative P2Y 12 inhibitor would be preferred if LOF allele prevalence exceeded 96.6% or GOF allele prevalence was over 97.2%.
Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed with 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations. Compared to universal alternative P2Y 12 inhibitor (Fig. 4 a), LOF/GOF-guided therapy was less costly by mean cost-saving of USD 1,799 (95%CI: USD 1,776–1,822; p < 0.001) and gained higher QALYs by 0.0379 QALYs (95%CI: 0.0376–0.0382; p < 0.001). LOF/GOF-guided therapy saved QALYs and cost in 98.56% of 10,000 simulations. It was more effective and costly with ICERs above and below WTP (50,000 USD/QALY) in 0.01% and 0.24% of time, respectively. The remaining 1.19% of simulations showed LOF/GOF-guided therapy to gain less QALYs than universal alternative P2Y 12 inhibitor. Fig. 4 Scatter plots of incremental costs against incremental QALYs: a LOF/GOF-guided therapy versus universal alternative P2Y 12 inhibitor, b LOF/GOF-guided therapy versus universal clopidogrel. LOF/GOF-guided therapy: CYP2C19 loss-of-function and gain-of-function allele-guided therapy; WTP: willingness-to-pay; QALY: quality-adjusted life-year
Compared to universal clopidogrel (Fig. 4 b), LOF/GOF-guided therapy was more effective by 0.226 QALYs (95%CI: 0.223–0.229; p < 0.001) and less costly by USD 7,828 (95%CI: USD 7,639–8,017; p < 0.001). Of 10,000 simulations, LOF/GOF-guided therapy gained higher QALYs with cost-saving in 86.35% of time. It was more costly and effective with ICERs above and below WTP in 0.27% and 10.36%, respectively. Universal clopidogrel gained higher QALYs than LOF/GOF-guided therapy in 3.02% of time.
The probabilities of each strategy to be cost-effective were examined in the acceptability curve over a wide range of WTP (0–100,000 USD/QALY) (Fig. 5 ). Using 50,000 USD/QALY as the WTP threshold, LOF/GOF-guided therapy, universal alternative P2Y 12 inhibitor, and universal clopidogrel were the preferred strategy in 99.07%, 0.04%, and 0.89% of the time, respectively.

LOF/GOF-guided therapy, universal clopidogrel, and universal alternative P2Y 12 inhibitor were the preferred strategy in 99.07%, 0.89%, and 0.04% of the time at threshold 50,000 USD/QALY, respectively
Discussion
The present study is the first cost-effectiveness analysis to examine outcomes of a personalized antiplatelet therapy guided by both CYP2C19 LOF and GOF alleles. The base-case analysis found LOF/GOF-guided therapy to be the preferred strategy with highest QALYs gained at lowest cost when compared to universal clopidogrel and universal alternative P2Y 12 inhibitor. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis further supported LOF/GOF-guided therapy to be the preferred option in 99.07% of the time at WTP threshold of 50,000 USD/QALYs.
Our findings were consistent with prior model-based cost-effectiveness analyses that pharmacogenetic-guided (by LOF allele) antiplatelet therapy had the highest probability to be a preferred strategy [ , , , ]. The present findings also comported with large observational studies that genotype-guided antiplatelet therapy was cost-effective and reduced number of cardiovascular events in patients undergoing PCI [ ]. Based upon the potential cost-effectiveness of LOF-guided antiplatelet therapy from previous studies, we further investigated the benefits of personalized medicine by both CYP2C19 LOF allele and GOF allele-guided use of alternative P2Y 12 inhibitor. At base-case scenario, the robustness of LOF/GOF-guided therapy as the preferred option was subject to the hazard ratio of cardiovascular death of carriers versus non-carriers of LOF allele and hazard ratio of cardiovascular death of non-carriers of LOF allele versus general patients receiving clopidogrel. When these two hazard ratios were at lower limit of the variable range, it would reduce the overall mortality risk and increase QALYs gained in ACS patients receiving clopidogrel. The clinical benefit of selecting LOF and GOF allele carriers to alternative P2Y 12 inhibitor in LOF/GOF-guided arm would therefore diminish.
In an extended one-way sensitivity analysis, we further explored the influence of genotype testing cost, the cost of the alternative P2Y 12 inhibitor, and the prevalence of LOF allele or GOF allele with extended ranges. The universal alternative P2Y 12 inhibitor would become the preferred strategy over LOF/GOF-guided therapy when the prevalence of LOF allele carriers or GOF allele carriers was extremely high (over 96.6% and 97.2%, respectively). At such high LOF or GOF allele prevalence, genotyping would become unnecessary when almost 100% of the patients were indicated for the alternative agent by genotyping. The universal alternative P2Y 12 inhibitor would also be preferred when genotype testing cost was unrealistically high (>USD 4,209). By contrast, universal clopidogrel would be the preferred option if the prevalence of LOF allele carriers was below 11.6% (majority of patients in the LOF/GOF-guided arm would receive clopidogrel). The incremental QALYs of LOF/GOF-guided arm versus universal clopidogrel narrowed and the ICER of LOF/GOF-guided therapy increased beyond the WTP threshold, and universal clopidogrel would therefore become the preferred strategy. LOF/GOF-guided therapy remained the preferred option despite lowering drug cost of the alternative P2Y 12 inhibitor. In the present model, LOF/GOF-guided therapy had the lowest one-year event rates of nonfatal stroke, cardiovascular death, and major bleeding comparing to the two universal treatment arms, resulting in lower cost and higher QALYs. Although the universal alternative P2Y 12 inhibitor had the lowest event rates of nonfatal myocardial infarction and stent thrombosis, the highest rates of major bleeding and nonfatal stroke in this group lead to higher cost for bleeding and life-long care for stroke survivors. Lowering the drug cost of the alternative agent alone did not affect the improved clinical outcomes in LOF/GOF-guided therapy, and it would further lower the overall cost of LOF/GOF-guided therapy (as LOF and GOF allele carriers would receive an alternative P2Y 12 inhibitor).
Prasugrel is preferred for patients undergoing PCI whilst ticagrelor is preferred for moderate-to-high risk ACS patients [ ]. A meta-analysis of prasugrel versus ticagrelor for ACS patients showed no significant difference in overall death, MI, or stroke, and the risk of major bleeding (not related to bypass surgery) was similar with both agents [ ]. As generic prasugrel is expected to be available in 2017, LOF/GOF-guided use of prasugrel might further enhance the cost-effectiveness of personalized antiplatelet therapy.
TAILOR-PCI is an ongoing prospective clinical trial recruiting PCI patients with coronary artery disease to evaluate the clinical benefits of genotype-guided antiplatelet therapy. In this trial, CYP2C19 LOF carriers received 1-year ticagrelor while non-carriers used clopidogrel [ ]. It is anticipated that the results of this trial would provide insights on the most optimal clinical scenarios for implementation of personalized antiplatelet therapy. The present study provided a framework to examine the treatment outcomes of applying both CYP2C19 LOF and GOF alleles in a personalized antiplatelet strategy. The clinical findings of TAILOR-PCI trial could be applied as model inputs in the present framework for scenario analysis on long-term impact of personalized antiplatelet therapy guided by CYP2C19 LOF (with and without GOF) alleles.
Our base-case analysis also showed that the universal alternative P2Y 12 inhibitor was cost-effective with increased QALYs at higher cost (ICER 28,542 USD/QALY) compared to universal clopidogrel. In clinical settings where genotyping is not readily available, our findings supported that additional resources are indicated to either implement genotyping for cost-saving and effective pharmacogenetic-guided therapy, or to use universal alternative P2Y 12 inhibitor at higher cost for improved clinical outcomes. The generic pricing of prasugrel would further reduce the ICER of universal prasugrel versus clopidogrel. On the other hand, implementation of genotyping facility could support personalized medicine in a number of drug therapies as recommended by Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium [ ]. A long-term cost-benefit analysis on implementing genotyping facility for personalized drug therapy is highly warranted.
Model-based analyses are in general subject to uncertainty of model inputs. Clinical inputs were derived from clinical trials and meta-analyses including patients with ACS, yet few trials also included patients who did not undergo PCI. Life-long events of patients with ACS were simplified and projected by short-term clinical trials. Vigorous sensitivity analysis was therefore performed to examine the robustness of model results. Platelet reactivity is a phenotypic indicator for antiplatelet drug response. High on-treatment platelet reactivity is associated with increased risk of stent thrombosis and MACE [ ], whereas low on-treatment platelet reactivity is associated with bleeding events [ ]. Clinical trials with crossover design showed that prasugrel and ticagrelor overcame high on-treatment platelet reactivity on clopidogrel [ , ]. The TROPICAL-ACS trial is an ongoing clinical trial to explore the clinical benefits of switching prasugrel over to clopidogrel in adequate responders [ ]. Antiplatelet therapy guided by platelet reactivity testing was also reported to be cost-effective compared to universal antiplatelet strategies [ , ]. Applying both CYP2C19 genotype and on-treatment platelet reactivity seems to be very promising for personalized antiplatelet therapy. Further studies of tailored antiplatelet therapies are highly warranted to explore optimal cross-over strategies between clopidogrel and the alternative P2Y 12 inhibitor guided by genotype and phenotype. The present model should be continuously updated with the clinical trial findings of tailored antiplatelet therapy available.
In conclusion, using both CYP2C19 GOF and LOF alleles to select antiplatelet therapy appears to be the preferred antiplatelet strategy over universal clopidogrel and the universal alternative P2Y 12 inhibitor therapy for ACS patients with PCI.
