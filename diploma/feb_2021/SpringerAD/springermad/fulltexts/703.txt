Introduction
Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) affects approximately 235,000 to 325,000 people in the United States, 275,000 people in Europe, and 105,000 people in Japan each year [ , , ]. However, the rate of survival to hospital discharge after OHCA remains disappointingly low [ , , ]. Ventricular fibrillation (VF) and pulseless ventricular tachycardia (pVT) are considered to be the most treatment responsive forms of arrest, and have the highest rates of survival among all presentations of cardiac arrest [ , ]. The 2015 International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) guidelines state that immediate defibrillation with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is the treatment of choice for VF/pVT in OHCA patients, and that antiarrhythmic drugs should be used during cardiac arrest for refractory ventricular dysrhythmias [ , ].
The ILCOR guidelines recommend the use of amiodarone in adult patients with refractory VF/pVT to improve the rate of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) [ , ]. Lidocaine is recommended as an alternative to amiodarone in adult patients with refractory VF/pVT. However, as mentioned in the knowledge gaps section of the latest resuscitation guidelines [ ], there is limited evidence to suggest that amiodarone is superior to lidocaine as far as the critical outcome of survival to discharge is concerned. In a trial involving OHCA patients with VF/pVT, Dorian et al. [ ] reported that the rate of survival to admission was significantly higher in the amiodarone group compared to the lidocaine group, but found no significant difference in the rate of survival to discharge between the two groups. More recently, Kudenchuk et al. [ ] reported survival data for patients with OHCA due to initial VF/pVT in the pre-hospital setting, and found that neither amiodarone nor lidocaine resulted in a significantly higher rate of survival compared to placebo. Thus, the provision of amiodarone or lidocaine for OHCA patients with refractory VF/pVT is still a matter of controversy.
We hypothesized that amiodarone is superior to lidocaine with regard to the rate of survival to hospital discharge for OHCA patients with VF/pVT on hospital arrival. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the above hypothesis using data obtained from a large nationwide in-hospital database in Japan.
Methods and Materials
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of The University of Tokyo. The requirement for informed patient consent was waived because of the anonymous nature of the data.
Emergency Medical System and Amiodarone/Lidocaine Use in Japan
An Emergency Medical System (EMS) team in Japan consists of three EMS personnel, and usually includes at least one emergency lifesaving technician trained to provide advanced life support (advanced airway management, intravenous line placement, and defibrillation) [ ]. The EMS resuscitation procedures follow the Japanese guidelines for CPR, and are based on the corresponding ILCOR guidelines. The EMS team provides defibrillation for OHCA patients with VF/pVT via an automated external defibrillator as soon as possible. However, an EMS team is not allowed to provide antiarrhythmic drugs (i.e. amiodarone or lidocaine) in pre-hospital settings.
Lidocaine was the traditionally used drug of choice for VF/pVT until the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare approved the use of intravenous amiodarone in June 2007. The cost of lidocaine is much lower (approximately 1/15) than the cost of amiodarone.
Data Source and Variables
We retrospectively evaluated a nationwide in-hospital patient administrative database, the Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination (DPC) database [ , , ]. The DPC database includes administrative claims and discharge abstract data for all patients (including cases of OHCA who died in the emergency room) discharged from more than 1000 participating hospitals, covering all 82 academic hospitals and more than 90 % of all tertiary-care emergency hospitals in Japan [ , , ]. The database includes the following information for each patient recorded using a uniform data submission form: age; sex; medical procedures (e.g., defibrillation, therapeutic hypothermia, percutaneous coronary angiogram/intervention); daily records of all drugs administered and devices used (e.g., amiodarone, lidocaine, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, intra-aortic balloon pumping); length of stay; and discharge status (home, transfer to another hospital, death in emergency room, or death after admission). The primary diagnosis, comorbidities at admission, and post-admission complications classified according to International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes are determined by the physicians in charge. Although the database does not include pre-hospital information, complications that occur after admission are clearly differentiated from comorbidities already present on admission (day 0). The data collection period for the database was from July 2007 to December 2010, and throughout the year from 2011 onward. In accordance with the ILCOR consensus statement [ , ], we presumed that cardiac arrest had a cardiac etiology unless there was an obvious non-cardiac etiology (cerebrovascular disease, respiratory disease, severe trauma, drowning, asphyxiation, or drug overdose) [ ]. We designated hospital volume as the number of treated patients eligible for the present study, with categorization into tertiles (low, medium, and high). Hospital type was categorized as academic or non-academic.
Patient Selection and Endpoint
Adult patients with cardiogenic OHCA and refractory VF/pVT were identified in the DPC database from July 2007 to March 2013. We did not include in-hospital cardiac arrest cases in the present study. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) age ≥ 18 years; (2) diagnosis of OHCA (ICD-10 codes at primary diagnosis and comorbidities on admission: I46.0 [cardiac arrest with successful resuscitation], I46.1 [sudden cardiac death], or I46.9 [cardiac arrest, unspecified]); (3) refractory VF/pVT (requiring provision of defibrillation even after hospital arrival); and (4) intravenous administration of either amiodarone or lidocaine on admission. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) patients with non-cardiogenic cardiopulmonary arrest (J60 to J61.9 [subarachnoid and cerebral hemorrhage], I71.0 to I71.9 [aortic dissection and aneurysm], I26.0 to I26.9 [pulmonary embolism], J45.9 and J46 [severe asthma], S00 to T98 [trauma, burns, hanging, accidental hypothermia, drowning, electrocution, anaphylaxis, drug overdose], J69 and T71 [asphyxiation], and K25.0, K25.2, K26.0, K26.2, K27.0, K27.2, K28.0, K28.2, K92.0 to 92.2, I85.0 to I85.9 [acute gastrointestinal bleeding or esophageal/gastric varices]); (2) patients with C00 to C97 (malignancy); (3) patients with R54 (caducity); (4) patients who received open-chest cardiac massage on admission; (5) patients administered both amiodarone and lidocaine on admission; and (6) patients whose outcome data were missing. Among the eligible patients, we evaluated only those administered either amiodarone or lidocaine.
The endpoint used in this study was survival to hospital discharge.
Statistical Analysis
We compared patient background characteristics, in-hospital treatments and procedures on day 0, and outcomes (endpoints) between the amiodarone and lidocaine groups. We also provided the outcome of patients to whom no antiarrhythmic drug was given (non-antiarrhythmic drug group) for reference. Continuous variables were compared using a t- test. Categorical variables were compared using the χ 2 test or Fisher’s exact test.
We performed one-to-one matched analyses using nearest-neighbor matching based on the estimated propensity scores of the patients. We estimated the propensity scores by fitting a logistic regression model for amiodarone/lidocaine administration as a function of the background patient characteristics and initial treatments or interventions (age; sex; hospital type; hospital volume; fiscal year; provision of adrenaline and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). The C-statistic for evaluating the goodness of fit was calculated. A match occurred when a patient in the prophylaxis group had an estimated score within 0.2 standard deviations of a patient in the control group [ ]. We examined the balance in baseline variables using standardized differences, where a difference of >10 % was regarded as imbalanced [ ]. We performed logistic regression analyses fitted with generalized estimating equations to examine the association between amiodarone/lidocaine administration and survival to hospital discharge, and adjusting for within-hospital clustering in the propensity score matched patients. We used Cox regression analyses to assess differences in survival rates between the amiodarone and lidocaine groups in the propensity score-matched groups. Odds ratios (ORs) and hazard ratios (HRs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Values of P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS version 22 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY).
Results
Patients
During the study period, 95,960 OHCA patients were identified in the database. A total of 3951 eligible patients from 795 hospitals were included in the final analysis (Fig. 1 ). The eligible patients were categorized into amiodarone ( n = 1743) and lidocaine ( n = 2208) groups, from which 801 propensity score-matched pairs were generated. The C-statistic indicated that the goodness of fit was 0.78 in the propensity score model. The survival rate in the non-antiarrhythmic drug group was 6.9 % (419/6113). Fig. 1 Patient selection.

Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the patients in the unmatched and propensity score-matched groups. In the unmatched groups, the patients were more likely to have received amiodarone if they were younger, male, treated at an academic hospital or high volume center, or if the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation system was used. The proportion of amiodarone use was found to gradually increase year by year. After propensity score matching, the baseline patient characteristics were well-balanced between the two groups, as shown in Table 1 (standardized differences of <10 %). In the propensity score-matched groups, there were no significant differences and the key in-hospital treatments on the day of admission were well-balanced between the amiodarone and lidocaine groups, as shown in Table 2 .

In the unmatched groups, the overall rate of survival to hospital discharge was 17.0 % (670/3951). There was no significant difference in the rate of survival to hospital discharge between the amiodarone and lidocaine groups (16.1 % vs. 17.6 %; difference, −1.5 %; 95 % CI, −3.9 to 0.9) (Table 3 ). Among the propensity score-matched groups, there was no significant difference in the rate of survival to hospital discharge between the amiodarone and lidocaine groups (15.2 % vs. 17.1 %; difference, −1.9 %; 95 % CI, −5.5 to 1.7). Logistic regression analyses fitted with generalized estimations, which adjusted for within-hospital clustering in the propensity score-matched patients, showed that there was no significant association between use of amiodarone and the rate of survival to hospital discharge (OR, 1.3; 95 % CI, 0.98 to 1.6). Cox regression analyses did not indicate significant in-hospital mortality differences between the amiodarone and lidocaine groups for the propensity score-matched groups (HR, 1.05; 95 % CI, 0.94 to 1.17) (Fig. 2 ).

Discussion
In the present nationwide study, we compared the rates of survival to discharge among cardiogenic OHCA patients with persistent VF/pVT on hospital arrival following treatment with amiodarone or lidocaine. The results showed that there was no significant difference in the rate of survival to hospital discharge between the amiodarone and lidocaine groups.
Lidocaine was traditionally used as the drug of choice for the treatment of OHCA patients with persistent VF/pVT until the early 2000s [ ]. Although lidocaine is simple to administer and low cost, there is limited evidence to suggest that lidocaine is superior to other antiarrhythmic drugs or placebo in terms of rates of survival to hospital discharge in OHCA patients with persistent VF/pVT. Although one retrospective study suggested that lidocaine may improve the success rate of resuscitation [ ], negative results were reported in other studies [ , ]. After the reports of two landmark studies on amiodarone [ , ], resuscitation guidelines were revised with a preference for amiodarone over lidocaine in cardiac arrest patients with persistent VF/pVT [ , , ]. However, the latest trial by Kudenchuk et al. [ ] did not find a significantly higher rate of survival for either amiodarone or lidocaine compared to placebo among OHCA due to refractory VF/pVT. Therefore, as mentioned in the latest resuscitation guidelines [ ], the results of the previous studies suggested that there was still insufficient evidence to support the hypothesis that amiodarone is superior to lidocaine with regard to the rate of survival to hospital discharge for OHCA patients with VF/pVT.
In the present Japanese nationwide study, we analyzed real-world clinical data for 3951 cardiogenic OHCA patients with refractory VF/pVT on hospital arrival across the country. The methodological strength of the present study lies in its evaluation of a large sample of patients with OHCA and refractory VF/pVT. We conducted robust adjustments for measured confounders using propensity score-matched analyses and focused on patients who received amiodarone or lidocaine. Our data showed that, following the approval to use intravenous amiodarone for VF/pVT in 2007, the proportion of amiodarone administration gradually increased in Japan. Although patients were more likely to receive amiodarone if they were younger and treated in academic hospitals/high volume centers in the unmatched groups, the baseline characteristics, including interventions after resuscitation (i.e. proportions of use of therapeutic hypothermia, percutaneous coronary angiogram/intervention intra-aortic balloon pumping renal replacement therapy, or noradrenaline), were well-balanced in the propensity score-matched groups, even though these factors were not included in the estimation of the propensity scores. The propensity score-matched analyses failed to confirm our hypothesis that amiodarone is superior to lidocaine for the rate of survival to hospital discharge in OHCA patients with VF/pVT on hospital arrival. These findings were robust with regard to the results obtained by the logistic regressions fitted with generalized estimating equations adjusting for within-hospital clustering and the Cox regression analyses.
The survival rate of the present study was lower than that quoted by Kudenchuk et al. (17 % vs 24 %, respectively) [ ]. This difference may be attributed to differences in the emergency medical systems of the countries in which the studies were conducted. The study by Kudenchuk et al. [ ] was conducted in North America and our study was performed in Japan. In the study by Kudenchuk et al. [ ], patients were randomized at the scene by the responding paramedics. This is in contrast to our study, in which antiarrhythmic drugs were provided after hospital arrival because paramedics are not allowed to administer any antiarrhythmic drugs (i.e. neither amiodarone nor lidocaine) in pre-hospital settings in Japan. Thus, there may be a large difference in time from cardiac arrest to first administration of the antiarrhythmic drug between the study of Kudenchuk et al. [ ] and the present study. Given these differences in the emergency medical systems, the two studies are not directly comparable.
Although it has been previously suggested that the rate of survival to admission was significantly higher among OHCA patients with VF/pVT treated with amiodarone compared to lidocaine [ ], several studies, including the present study, reported that there was no significant difference in the rate of survival to discharge between the two groups [ , ]. It may be the case that amiodarone might initially compromise hemodynamic stability, and that its initial beneficial effect on survival may not be sustained in patients who initially survive but later die in hospital. In fact, several studies have suggested that amiodarone has negative inotropic and vasodilatory effects [ , , ], which may be disadvantageous after ROSC in post-cardiac arrest syndrome patients. However, in the present study, there was no significant difference in the proportion of the actual treatments given after ROSC (e.g. percutaneous coronary intervention, intra-aortic balloon pumping, norepinephrine, and transfusion) between the two groups, as shown in Table 2 . In addition, the Cox regression analyses did not indicate significant in-hospital mortality differences between the amiodarone and lidocaine groups for the propensity score matched groups, as shown in Fig. 2 . Because we could not provide any hemodynamic variables (e.g. record of blood pressure, continuous cardiac output, electrocardiogram, and echocardiogram) to confirm our speculation, further studies are required to confirm this hypothesis.
There are several limitations to the present study. First, only a limited number of covariates could be analyzed, because the database does not include data on several important factors, especially pre-hospital data such as whether the OHCA was witnessed by a bystander, the quality of resuscitation given, whether the resuscitation was dispatcher-assisted, and how the EMS providers treated the patients. However, as far as OHCA with refractory VF/pVT is concerned, the issue of whether to provide amiodarone or lidocaine may be determined by the preference of the doctor in charge or by the institutional protocol, rather than by the patient characteristics. Thus, we implemented hospital factors (i.e. academic/nonacademic and hospital volume) and fiscal year to estimate our propensity scores, and these measured confounders were well-balanced between the two groups. In addition, we also analyzed the outcome using a logistic regression model adjusted for a potential within-hospital clustering effect using a generalized estimating equation. Second, we only evaluated adult cardiogenic OHCA patients with refractory VF/pVT. Thus, our results cannot be generalized to the use of amiodarone/lidocaine for children, non-cardiogenic patients, and patients without refractory VF/pVT. Third, we could not evaluate the effect of amiodarone/lidocaine for VF/pVT in the pre-hospital setting. Because an EMS team is not allowed to provide any antiarrhythmic drugs in pre-hospital settings in Japan, our results do not necessarily apply to other countries where an EMS team is allowed to provide antiarrhythmic drugs in the early period after cardiac arrest. Fourth, although we evaluated nationwide data, the study was not conducted prospectively and only included patient data that was available in the DPC database, which may not be representative of the entire Japanese population. Thus, a cause–effect relationship could not be determined in the present study. Although the present DPC database includes data of more than 1000 participating hospitals (covering all 82 academic hospitals and more than 90 % of all tertiary-care emergency hospitals), there are many hospitals which do not participate in the current DPC database (these are mostly non-academic and non-tertiary-care emergency hospitals). Finally, unlike Kudenchuk et al. [ ], we did not compare three groups in our analysis (i.e. amiodarone vs. lidocaine vs. non-antiarrhythmic drug groups). The non-antiarrhythmic drug group may consist of three profiles of sub-groups as follows: 1) patients who were still VF/pVF even after the first defibrillation attempt on hospital arrival (i.e. this group of patients can be compared with our amiodarone and lidocaine groups); 2) patients with ROSC after defibrillation (i.e. unlikely to require subsequent antiarrhythmic drugs); and 3) patients who transformed from VF/pVF to pulseless electrical activity or asystole after being defibrillated(and thus having no indication for antiarrhythmic drugs). The second group (which did not require antiarrhythmic drugs) can be expected to have the best outcome and the third group (not requiring antiarrhythmic drugs after being defibrillated on hospital arrival) can be expected to represent the worst case scenario. It was not possible to accurately compare outcomes between these three sub-groups because we could not identify to which sub-group each patient belonged after defibrillation on hospital arrival. We therefore provided the overall outcome results of the non-antiarrhythmic drug group, but did not compare this group with the other two groups.
Conclusion
The present nationwide study suggested that there may be no significant difference in the rate of survival to hospital discharge between use of amiodarone and lidocaine for cardiogenic OHCA patients with persistent VF/pVT on hospital arrival.
