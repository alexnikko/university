Introduction
Aortic valve area (AVA) remains one of the main echocardiographic parameters for the diagnosis and estimation of the severity of valvular aortic stenosis (AS). In addition, peak velocity, mean pressure gradient across the aortic valve and dimensionless ratio of velocity time integral (VTI) of the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) and aortic valve (AV) are additional important variables used in echocardiography to assess aortic stenosis, which are dependent on blood flow, preload and afterload.
When agreement between the three methods on the severity of aortic stenosis is met, the concordant echocardiographic findings leave no doubt regarding the severity of the valvular stenosis. It is therefore more challenging when the findings are discordant, most commonly when there is discrepancy between the measured AVA and the peak velocity and/or mean pressure gradient.
Additional specific measures of stenosis severity have been validated, with various limitations. The European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging (EACVI) and the American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) developed recommendations to the use of those methods, in their recently updated guidance on aortic valve stenosis [ ].
Some methods have been described as reasonable for clinical use when additional information is needed in selected patients: velocity ratio has limited longitudinal data. It ignores left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) size variability beyond patient size dependence, and planimetry of anatomic valve area is difficult with severe valve calcification, also the variability of contraction coefficient (anatomic/effective valve area) can make it a less favourable method.
Transvalvular peak and mean pressure gradients have been used routinely to assess AS severity by trans-thoracic echocardiography (TTE). The TTE-derived peak transvalvular gradient is based on Doppler velocity and is therefore overestimating the invasively measured peak-to-peak gradient. However, the mean gradient is more comparable between the two methods.
There are other methods which the EACVI and ASE did not recommend for routine clinical practice, although they may be appropriate for research applications, and in rare clinical cases, they include percentage of left ventricle (LV) stroke work loss, recovered pressure gradient, energy loss index, valvulo-arterial impedance, aortic valve resistance and projected valve area at normal flow rate.
Based on the importance of accurate aortic valve area evaluation, this review will aim to discuss the principles of measuring aortic valve area using the continuity equation, the potential sources of errors, the possible strategies which could be used to handle those errors, the clinical challenges in discordant AS measurements, and finally to discuss the role of three-dimensional (3D) imaging modalities to improve AVA accuracy and potential future applications.
Aortic valve area and the continuity equation
AVA is calculated using the continuity equation [ ], which is based on the concept that the stroke volume (SV) ejected through the LVOT passes through the stenotic orifice AVA and thus both volumes are equal.
The volume flow equals the cross-sectional area (CSA) times flow velocity over the ejection period (VTI). $$ {\text{AVA}} \times {\text{VT}}{{\text{I}}_{\text{AV}}} = {\text{CS}}{{\text{A}}_{\text{LVOT}}} \times {\text{VT}}{{\text{I}}_{\text{LVOT}}}. $$
VTI is measured using continuous wave (CW) spectral Doppler for aortic valve and pulse wave (PW) spectral Doppler for LVOT (Fig. 1 ) Fig. 1 CW spectral Doppler across the aortic valve showing measurement of VTI by tracing the signal envelop, which also gives the mean and max PG and velocity across the valve.

The current standard approach to estimate CSA LVOT is still based on LVOT diameter measurements. LVOT diameter is measured in a parasternal long-axis view from the inner edge to inner edge of the LVOT at the blood–tissue interface in mid-systole, within 0.3–1 cm below the aortic valve annulus (Fig. 2 ); however, some centres are using the annulus diameter as the standard LVOT diameter, and also some experts recommend using the best view to define LVOT diameter rather than using a suboptimal mid-systole view, where the blood–tissue interface is ill-defined. The CSA of the LVOT is assumed to be a circle and the area is calculated as $$ {\text{CS}}{{\text{A}}_{\text{LVOT}}} = \pi {\left( {{{{\text{LVOT}}\;{\text{diameter}}} \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{{\text{LVOT}}\;{\text{diameter}}} 2}} \right. \kern-0pt} 2}} \right)^2}. $$ Fig. 2 PW spectral Doppler across LVOT showing measurement of VTI by tracing the signal envelop, which also gives the mean and max PG and velocity at LVOT level. LVOT left ventricular outflow tract, PG pressure gradient, VTI velocity time integral
The physical principles of the continuity equation are based on a local form of conservation of energy laws which states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed, i.e. the total amount of energy is fixed. When applied on fluid dynamics, the volume flow will represent fixed energy provided it is incompressible, such as in blood flow, hence the continuity equation used in echocardiography.
Prior to the use of echocardiography Doppler to calculate AVA, Gorlin and colleagues in 1951 [ ] described for the first time a general form to calculate effective orifice area (EOA) of the aortic valve from invasive measurements performed in the catheterisation laboratory. This formula had been confirmed with operative correlation and post-mortem findings [ ].
Consequently, invasive AVA measurements were used to aid decision regarding aortic valve intervention and surgical replacement, until three decades later when studies showed that using the continuity equation as has been described in echocardiography can give AVA values which have good correlation with invasive measurements and Gorlin formula [ ].
Furthermore, AVA has been used to calculate the pressure recovery (PR) phenomenon which is important in some patients with AS and ascending aortic diameter of < 30 mm or patients with mechanical prosthetic aortic valve due to the risk of overestimation of the pressure gradient in this group of patients, which is the leading cause of the discrepancy between Doppler and invasive measurements of pressure gradient.
The limitations of continuity equation
The clinical measurement of AS jet and LVOT velocity has very low intra- and inter-observer variability, which has been estimated at 3–4%. However, the measurement variability for LVOT diameter is higher and ranges from 5 to 8%, which becomes the greatest potential source of error after being squared for the calculation of CSA [ ]. An argument exists to indicate that the same LVOT diameter should be used in subsequent measurements to avoid this error, as the LVOT size rarely changes over time in adults under baseline stable haemodynamic conditions [ ].
Another important limitation is the assumption of a circular shape of the LVOT, where it is most often of elliptical shape, leading subsequently to underestimation of SV and eventually AVA. Although there has been some evidence that the current AVA derived from the continuity equation is a strong predictor of clinical outcomes and correlates well with invasive measurements by Gorlin formula, there has also been some evidence to suggest that it tends to be underestimated in comparison with invasive measurements, which leads to overestimation of severity [ ]. This had led to more research to measure AVA by planimetry in vitro using some mechanical and tissue aortic valves and simulating the human blood flow using a special computer software [ ]; this had shown that the conventional AVA measured by the continuity equation in fact matches the AVA by planimetry, and the Gorlin formula tends to overestimate the area. However, strong data came later to show that planimetry of the AVA has significant limitations and is not recommended as a baseline measurement to assess AVA; also it correlates less well with other haemodynamic measurements of AS by echocardiography [ ]. This would lead to the conclusion that conventional AVA in fact underestimates the area compared to the invasive measurements by Gorlin formula.
Accuracy of SV measurements in the LVOT also assumes laminar flow where the velocity is the same in the centre as at the edge of the flow stream, which can be variable, especially with dynamic outflow tract obstruction. Also aortic regurgitation (AR) can cause skewed flow pattern, which makes this assumption less accurate. However, placing the sample volume of the cursor when measuring PW in the centre of LVOT can give an estimate velocity close to the average velocity, and the difference is negligible. The only situation where LVOT velocity should be interpreted carefully is when the patient has a dilated outflow tract, where the central velocity may be significantly higher than the average, and one way to identify this error is by noticing the discrepancy to the other findings compared to an unexpected high SV [ ].
Another major challenge arises from situations where the flow rate across the aortic valve is low, causing decreased cusp opening and a small EOA which the continuity equation is meant to measure, such as in concurrent severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and when a ventricular assist device is present. The valve area in this case might indicate severe AS which in fact it is not the case [ ].
Despite the wide application of the continuity equation given that it has been well validated in both clinical and experimental studies [ ], and being reported as a valuable parameter for prediction of clinical outcome and for clinical decision making, we are increasingly confronted with a significant proportion of patients with discordant AVA when compared to the other two important echocardiographic Doppler measurements of AS, i.e. peak velocity and mean pressure gradient across the valve, which sheds the light on the necessity of a new approach to defining patients with various grades of AS, and the importance of careful utilisation of the continuity equation.
A new classification for severe aortic stenosis
Mean pressure gradient and peak velocity across the aortic valve are haemodynamic measurements and they are flow dependent; therefore, they tend to be underestimated in low-flow status such as severe LV dysfunction or overestimated in high-flow status such as fever, anaemia or hyperthyroidism.
Although aortic valve area used to be considered independent from flow rate, it has been recognised recently that it is relatively flow dependent, but it tends to be less likely affected by the flow rate compared to peak velocity and mean pressure gradient [ ].
With more challenging subgroups of patients where there is discordance in these parameters, the EACVI and ASE recommend a new classification of patients with severe AS depending on the flow rate, LV systolic function and mean pressure gradient, and to perform extra measurements such as valvulo-arterial impedance and low-dobutamine stress echocardiography to help understand and identify the true severity of the aortic stenosis [ ]:
Low-flow, low-gradient AS with reduced ejection fraction
This is a situation when LV systolic dysfunction with reduced SV indexed to body surface area (SVi) co-exists with severe AS.
The main criteria used for this definition include the following: EOA < 1.0 cm 2 Mean pressure gradient < 40 mmHg LV ejection fraction < 50% SVi < 35 mL/m 2 .
Dobutamine stress echocardiography will increase the flow rate causing an increase in the ejection fraction (EF) provided there is contractile reserve which is indicated by an increase in SV from baseline of greater than 20% [ ]. A standardised flow rate of 250 mL/s has been proposed as the target normal flow rate to avoid the variability of the magnitude of flow augmentation from one patient to another [ ].
This test may be helpful to differentiate two clinical situations: Severe AS causing LV systolic dysfunction (i.e. true severe AS): in this situation, the valve area remains less than 1 cm 2 indicating severe AS, and as a result of increase flow rate and stroke volume the mean pressure gradient becomes greater than 40 mmHg, confirming the diagnosis of true severe AS. Aortic valve replacement in this category is likely to relieve the afterload and improve outcomes. Moderate AS (i.e. pseudosevere AS): in this situation, the valve area improves and becomes greater than 1 cm 2 indicating moderate AS; meanwhile, the mean pressure gradient remains under 40 mmHg. With pseudosevere AS, another cause of LV dysfunction is more likely, for example, due to myocardial infarction or a primary cardiomyopathy. As a result, aortic valve replacement may not lead to significant improvement in LV systolic function and it is not recommended at this stage.
Failure to achieve contractile reserve (to increase SV by > 20%) is a predictor of high surgical mortality and poor long-term outcome although valve replacement may improve LV function and outcome even in this subgroup [ ].
Low-flow, low-gradient AS with preserved ejection fraction
This is one of the most challenging situations when the valve area is less than 1 cm 2 with a peak velocity of less than 4 m/s and a mean pressure gradient of less than 40 mmHg despite normal LV ejection fraction. Paradoxical low-flow, low-gradient AS with preserved EF is a less likely situation with regard to patients with hypertrophied, small ventricles resulting in reduced transvalvular flow causing SVi of < 35 mL/m 2 despite having normal EF. [ ]
The more likely situation is due to technical factors in AVA calculation, and this has to be carefully scrutinised. Calcium score by non-contrast CT has been suggested as an aid to define severe AS [ ]; however, the final answer most often remains in the grey zone. The EACVI and ASE summarised some recommendations of how to approach this challenging situation by considering the following conditions [ ]: Severe hypertension during examination Inconsistency between AVA and velocity/gradient cut-offs in the range of AVAs between 0.8 and 1.0 cm 2 Measurements errors (most importantly, underestimation of LVOT area and thus flow) in moderate AS (i.e. true valve area ≥ 1.0 cm 2) Clinically moderate AS (despite an AVA < 1.0 cm 2) in a patient with small body size Severe paradoxical low-flow, low-gradient AS.
Normal flow, low-gradient AS with preserved ejection fraction
This is a rare situation when the valve area is below 1 cm 2 and the mean gradient below 40 mmHg with normal EF and normal flow rate. The more likely explanation is that this composition of measurements is a result of the inconsistent cut-off values for valve area and velocity/gradient or of measurement errors, in particular underestimation of valve area as mentioned in the previous category of patients. This hypothesis was supported by studies that have demonstrated that patients with normal flow, normal ejection fraction and low-gradient AS have the same outcome as those with moderate AS [ ].
The stepwise diagram recommended in the latest EACVI/ASE guidelines can aid to better understand the different subgroups of patients with AS and to make more sound clinical decision (Fig. 3 ).

AS aortic stenosis, LVOT left ventricular outflow tract
Despite the validation of the continuity equation over the last few decades, there have been some concerns regarding the accuracy of this equation, mainly due to the method used to calculate LVOT area. This has come more to light with the ageing population, the increase number of patients with AS with various degrees of LV systolic dysfunction, LV hypertrophy, co-existing valvular regurgitation, different flow rate status, and the variety of patients characteristics due to more detailed assessment undertaken nowadays by 3D imaging modalities. Therefore, a definite way to improve on this issue has to be made. Furthermore, the measurement performed by 2D echocardiography depends on the cross section selected for imaging, and this has to be explored more by using 3D imaging modalities [ ].
Literature review
The effect of 3D imaging modality on continuity equation and LVOT assessment
A review of medical literature was performed by searching Medline and Embase for studies which compared LVOT area, preferably with parallel AVA comparison, between the conventional continuity equation results and the 3D imaging results, with or without fusion of the LVOT area derived from 3D measurements into the continuity equation. The terms used were ‘continuity equation’, ‘LVOT’, ‘AVA’, ‘aortic valve area’ and ‘left ventricular outflow tract’. The results came back with 19 studies with sufficient data comparing LVOT area measurements between two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography and 3D imaging modalities, including 3D echocardiography, multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR). The studies are summarised in Table 1 .

All the studies found in medical literature have shown that LVOT area and AVA are underestimated with TTE when using the continuity equation as shown in the table. The difference between the LVOT area from continuity equation and the area measured by planimetry using 3D imaging modality varied across the studies from 11% [ ] to as high as 85% [ ]. The conventional measurement of AVA by continuity equation was significantly lower than the modified continuity equation using LVOT area from 3D imaging modality or by direct planimetry of the AVA; the difference varied amongst studies from 7% [ ] up to 70% [ ].
The characteristics of patients evaluated in these studies were variable, and the LVOT geometry was found to be most often elliptical in all studies, occasionally of an irregular shape, and rarely circular.
It is noteworthy that most of these studies had small population sizes. Gaspar et al. [ ] enrolled 50 patients, 25 with aortic stenosis and 25 without aortic stenosis, who had been referred to have cardiac CT. By performing TTE on each patient within 1 day of having CT study, the continuity equation was used as per TTE protocol to calculate the valve area, and comparison was made with a modified continuity equation by replacing the circular LVOT area with an area derived from LVOT planimetry using MDCT. A correction factor was found to be 1.17. In this study, however, the sample size was not adequately powered to produce a robust correction factor.
Clavel et al. [ ] enrolled 269 patients with AS, and they calculated the valve area by TTE and by MDCT within 3 months; also they looked at AVA planimetry by MDCT and they compared all measurements with pressure gradients. This has shown that the valve areas by TTE and by MDCT had good correlation with modest dispersion; however, the correlation between pressure gradient and valve area was better by TTE than static CT area (with no significant statistical difference). Dynamic CT did not improve the relationship, whereas planimetry worsened it.
Although the sample size was powered in this study, this study only looked at patients with AS with a majority having severe AS and an ejection fraction of > 42%. There was only 25% of the population having low-gradient AS (mean PG < 40 mmHg) with discordant AVA, and this is where the correlation between a modified AVA measurement, with the utility of LVOT direct area planimetry, and haemodynamic measurements might have improved, as it has been recommended in the latest EACVI/ASE guidelines [ ].
Kamperidis et al. [ ] included a total of 191 patients with severe AS and LVEF of ≥ 50%, and then divided them into 4 groups: normal flow-high gradient, low flow-high gradient, normal flow-low gradient and low flow-low gradient. This study showed that the impact of CT-derived LVOT area in the calculation of the aortic valve area amongst patients with low gradient and either low or normal flow may differ significantly. The EACVI/ASE in the latest guidelines have shed the light on the use of LVOT-derived area, either from MDCT or 3D echocardiography, in subgroup of patients with low-flow, low-gradient AS with preserved ejection fraction to avoid misclassification of AS severity; however, further validation of this approach is needed.
The agreement between 3D imaging fusion data and invasive measurements
In early reports following the validation of the continuity equation, Menzel et al. [ ] studied 23 patients with aortic valve stenosis by comparing the AVA derived from the continuity equation with a modified continuity equation using 3D planimetry for LVOT cross-sectional area by trans-oesophageal echocardiography (TOE). They found a mean difference of 0.18 cm 2 . The comparison of AVA by continuity equation and by invasive measurements showed a mean difference of -0.074 cm 2 for the conventionally calculated LVOT area, whereas for the LVOT area by planimetry the mean difference of AVA amounted to − 0.03 cm 2 , showing and improved agreement between the two methods when LVOT area was used from the 3D echocardiography.
Khaw et al. [ ] in 2009 performed LVOT measurement in 20 patients with moderate to severe aortic stenosis with a trans-thoracic real-time 3D echocardiography (3D-TTE) technique in two systolic frames. The aortic valve area was calculated from systolic LVOT areas and was compared to area values obtained from the conventional areas as measured by the continuity equation. This has shown less deviation from the invasively measured area than conventionally calculated area using the continuity equation ( p < 0.001).
Although the two studies included small sample sizes, the fact that they compared directly the findings of a modified continuity equation with invasive measurements was an important method to express how the real LVOT area when used in the continuity equation can have an impact on the correlation with haemodynamics and clinical applications. In the future, larger studies using similar approach, possibly with higher resolution 3D imaging quality, such as MDCT and CMR, with head-to-head comparison with invasive measurements could potentially validate a correction factor, which can be used to improve accuracy of measurements using continuity equation.
Time to accept a change to continuity equation
The wide range of difference between the real LVOT area and the conventional continuity equation area which is assumed to be a circle, as shown in the studies described above, indicates that the range of the error can vary from minimal to significant, and depending on other confounding factors such as jet misalignment and dynamic LVOT velocities, there is a risk of misleading AVA and complete fallacy in the continuity equation. LVOT area is consistently underestimated by the continuity equation as shown in the forest plot (Fig. 4 ). Fig. 4 Integrated, stepwise approach in grading AS severity from the latest EACVI/ASE recommendations on the echocardiographic assessment of aortic valve stenosis.

Due to the fact that the LVOT is most often an ellipse, drawing a circle from its minor axis will underestimate the area, and drawing it from its major axis will overestimate the area (Fig. 5 ). It is likely for unknown reason that the LVOT diameter we measure in the parasternal long-axis view by TTE is somewhere near or exactly over the minor axis. Therefore, the theoretical circle with an area similar to the real ellipse area will have a diameter between the major and minor axes (Fig. 6 ). Fig. 5 Meta-analysis with forest plot demonstrates data from 16 studies where mean LVOT area and standard deviation (SD) were available to calculate the pooled value of underestimation of LVOT area by the conventional continuity equation compared to LVOT area by planimetry, which is statistically significant (− 1.37 cm 2 ), p < 0.00001. CE continuity equation, LVOTA left ventricular outflow tract area, SD standard deviation Fig. 6 A diagram showing the ellipse (E) which represents the real LVOT area, with a circle within it from the minor axis (C1) which underestimates LVOT area, and a circle outside from the major axis (C2) which overestimates the area. The double-headed arrow refers to the minor axis of ellipse, which is the likely diameter measured by TTE. LVOT left ventricular outflow tract, TTE trans-thoracic echocardiography
The LVOT diameter measured conventionally by TTE, as a result, can be modified to a degree where it is lying between the major and minor axes, in order to generate a closer circle area to the real LVOT area, using a correction factor. We accept that the most accurate measurement for obtaining LVOT area is the direct planimetry; however, using carefully a derived correction factor will improve convergence in values.
Conclusion
Aortic valve area is an essential and necessary measurement obtained by echocardiography to aid decision making on aortic valve intervention, and it has long been assessed by the widely used continuity equation. Over the last decade, 3D imaging modalities have shown that the LVOT area which is paramount in the continuity equation is not circular as assumed; it is most often an ellipse, and sometimes irregular. In addition, it tends to be underestimated with TTE using the continuity equation.
Using 3D imaging as fusion modalities with echocardiography to help classify difficult patients with discordant results has been recommended in selected patients; however, future studies will have to address the subgroup of patients with severe AV stenosis with low flow-low gradient and the utility of a correction factor. In addition, outcome studies will be important to support its clinical utility. Investigating the health economics with identifying reduction of downward investigations may prove the use of correction factor a cost-effective alternative.
