Introduction
Oxaliplatin, is an anti-cancer drug widely used as a first-line therapy to treat various types of cancers like colorectal, prostate, testicular, and breast tissues, but peripheral neurotoxicity is a notable complication in doing treatment [ ]. Around 30–40% of patients undergoing chemotherapy develops peripheral neuropathy and experience symptoms of pain and sensory disturbances depending on dose intensity and cumulative dose during treatment. It starts at a cumulative dose of > 400 mg/m 2 and the severity can be observed with the cumulative dose of > 1000 mg/m 2 [ ]. Specifically, oxaliplatin produces a distinctive spectrum of symptoms in acute and chronic therapy which develop from several weeks or months after the initiation of therapy and alleviate only when the therapy is ceased [ ]. Therefore, oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy is still known as a real problem for the therapeutic management of cancer patients as it compromises both the oncological prognosis and the quality of life. Unfortunately, present pain relievers merely offer marginal relief from the symptoms and their usage is largely limited due to lack of efficacy or unacceptable side effects [ ]. Despite the myriad of studies, an efficacious treatment for oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy (OIPN) has yet to be identified. These challenges necessitate the discovery of novel therapeutic options that can target multiple pathomechanisms for the treatment of OIPN. Several scientific reports suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction and glial activation play a critical role in the progression of neurodegeneration and pain-like manifestations [ , , ]. At the cellular level, oxaliplatin is reported to accumulate in the neurons and generate free radicals and damage DNA by forming platinum-DNA adducts with both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (nDNA and mtDNA, respectively) that induces neuronal apoptosis [ , ]. Several lines of evidence also indicate that glial cell activation and upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines play an essential role in the initiation and progression of chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain [ ]. Especially, oxaliplatin induces neuropathic pain by the synergistic signal of astrocyte activation and through mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathways [ , ]. Moreover, mitochondrial dysregulation is known to be the principle arbitrator of the pro-inflammatory signaling; similarly, inflammatory cascades also alter mitochondrial function. Both these processes together worsen the vicious cycle of neurotoxicity and thus culminate into peripheral neuropathy [ ]. Therefore, strategies aimed at controlling excessive mitochondrial dysfunction and glial activation may represent both preventive and therapeutic interventions in peripheral neuropathy. Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) improves the mitochondrial health and also negatively regulates the glial activation that plays a major role in pain progression [ , , ]. Recent preclinical studies have also appreciated the emerging role of AMPK as a potential target for the management of neuropathic pain [ , ].
Rosmarinic acid (RA) is a natural phenolic compound commonly found in the species of Boraginaceae, mainly, Rosmarinus officinalis L. Presence of RA in various foods, medicinal herbs, and spices have beneficial and health promoting effects [ , ]. RA possesses a number of biological activities such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic and neuroprotective properties [ , , , ]. Furthermore, recent studies indicated that RA has the capability of activating AMPK in diabetic mice [ , ]. These findings prompted us to consider the effect of RA on OIPN. Hence, the present study was aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effect of RA in an experimental model of OIPN. The extent of AMPK activation in rats was compared with a phytoconstituent, standard AMPK activator and neuroprotective agent, biochanin A [ ].

In Vitro Methods
Neuronal Cell Culture
The Neuro-2a (N2a) cell line was obtained from NCCS, Pune, India, and human colon cancer cell line HT-29 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD, USA) and were grown in MEM medium and high-glucose DMEM, respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, glutamine (2 mM), streptomycin/penicillin (1%), at 37 °C, in a humidified atmosphere of 95% O 2 and 5% CO 2 . When confluent, the cells were subcultured or seeded into T25 or multiwell plates as per the experimental requirement.
Measurement of Cell Viability of HT-29 Cells
Cell viability was estimated by using 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT). HT-29 cells were plated into microplate wells and were grown till confluent. Cells were treated with oxaliplatin (50 μmol) alone and also in the combination of RA (50 μmol), then incubated for 48 h. MTT solution (5 mg/ml in MEM) was added and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. The absorbance of solubilized formazan crystals was measured at 570 nm using a multimode reader (Spectramax M4, Molecular Devices LLC, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).
Assessment of Neurite Outgrowth
N2a cells were induced for neurite growth by adding nerve growth factor (NGF) (50 ng/ml). Cells were exposed to drug solutions with oxaliplatin (50 μmol) and its combination with RA (50 μmol) and biochanin A (50 μmol). Neurite outgrowth was measured after 24 h of treatment. Images of live cells were taken under phase contrast illumination using an inverted microscope (NIKON, USA) and the neurite length was measured by a software (ImageJ 1.36; Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health, MD, USA) tracing the length of the distance between the cell periphery and the tip of the longest neurite for each cell in a field. Data from six wells with 10 fields in each well were pooled. Neurite outgrowth is expressed as average neurite length (μm) and the percentage of cells bearing neurites (%) [ ].
Measurement of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential
N2a cells were seeded in a 96-well plate and incubated with drug solutions of oxaliplatin (50 μmol) and its combination with RA (50 μmol) and biochanin A (50 μmol). After 24 h, cells were loaded with JC-1 at 1 μg/ml for 20 min and the fluorescence intensity at 590 nm indicate mitochondrial membrane potential (Ψm) [ ]. Images were taken using a fluorescence microscope (Nikon 80i, Japan). The fluorescent signal was also measured by multi-plate reader (Spectramax M4, Molecular Devices LLC, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). For flow cytometric analysis, cells were trypsinized and suspended in serum containing PBS and processed for fluorescence analysis using BD FACSVerse (BD Biosciences, CA, USA).
In Vivo Methods
Experimental Animals
Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 200–250 g were procured from the National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), Hyderabad, India. All the animals were housed, had free access to food and water ad libitum, maintained at a constant temperature of 23 ± 1 °C, relative humidity 55 ± 10% and 12:12 h light and dark cycle throughout the experimentation. The animal investigations received approval from the institutional animal ethics committee. All the animals were acclimatized at least for 1 week and baseline measurements were taken prior to the starting of the experiments. All behavioral measures were obtained by an experimenter who was blinded to the group assignment to avoid bias and wherever possible, Animal Research Reporting of In Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines have been followed.
Experimental Design and Animal Treatment
Rats were randomly grouped into 6 of 10 animals each. They were assigned to normal control (NC), oxaliplatin control (OC), and four treated groups. To establish OIPN, the OC rats were administered with oxaliplatin (4 mg/kg ip ) twice a week for 4 weeks in a total of nine injections so that the total cumulative dose is 36 mg/m 2 which corresponds to > 1184 mg/m 2 and mimics the clinical cumulative oxaliplatin dose causing chronic neuropathy [ ]. The three treatment groups comprised of OC rats treated with RA at 25 and 50 mg/kg, po (OC + RA1 and OC + RA2, respectively) and biochanin A treated at 20 mg/kg, po (OC + BA). The sixth group comprised of normal rats that received RA alone at 50 mg/kg, po (RA2). After 28 days of treatment, rats were euthanized with CO 2 anesthesia. Sciatic nerves, dorsal root ganglion (DRG), and L4–L6 (lumbar) spinal cord were collected and used for various experimentations.
Functional Assessment (Nerve Conduction Velocity)
Conduction velocities for all the animals were measured by Power lab 8SP system under anesthesia (a mixture of 4% isoflurane and oxygen). The sciatic nerve was stimulated with 3 V proximally at the sciatic notch and distally at the ankle by using bipolar needle electrode. Receiving electrodes were placed on the muscle of the foot. The latencies of muscle action potential were recorded via bipolar surface electrodes from the foot muscle of hind paw. Negative M-wave deflection and H-reflex latencies were measured using Lab chart software and the related motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV) and sensory nerve conduction velocity (SNCV), respectively, were calculated by using the distance between the stimulation points and latencies. The results were expressed in meters per second [ ].
Behavioral Assessment
Cold chemical allodynia was performed using acetone spray test. The response of the rat was noted for 20 s and graded on a 4-point scale: 0, no response; 1, quick withdrawal or flicking the paw; 2, prolonged withdrawal or repeated flicking; and 3, repeated flicking of the paw with the licking of the paw [ ]. Thermal hyperalgesia to cold (4 ± 1 °C) stimuli was performed by using Eddy’s hot/cold plate (Ugo Basile Biological Research Apparatus, Varese, Italy) [ ]. Mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia were measured by using Randall-Selitto apparatus (IITC, Life Sciences, USA) and Von Frey hairs (Samitek, USA; 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 15 g), respectively [ , ].
Estimation of Oxidative/Nitrosative Stress Markers
Sciatic nerve homogenates were assessed for oxidative/nitrosative stress-induced lipid peroxidation and nitrite levels. They were assessed by measuring thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) at 532 nm [ ] and by estimating nitrite at 540 nm using Griess reagent, respectively [ ]. Total protein content was estimated using protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, USA) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and nitrite levels were expressed as micromole and nanomole per milligram of protein after protein normalization. Free radical-induced DNA fragmentation was assessed using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay in the longitudinal sections of the sciatic nerve. The 3′ end of fragmented DNA was labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) according to manufacturer’s protocol (Calbiochem, CA, USA). Sections were mounted with nuclear counterstain 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), and images were taken using a fluorescent microscope (Nikon DC 300F). The total number of cells and TUNEL-positive cells were counted from at least six sections per group and TUNEL-positive cells were expressed as the percentage of total cells [ ].
Assessment of Mitochondrial Functions
Mitochondrial Isolation Kit, MITOISO1 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) was used to isolate the mitochondrial fraction from sciatic nerves and the mitochondrial membrane potential was determined by using the JC-1 dye, according to manufacturer’s instructions. The fluorescence observed at 590 nm shows the extent of formation of J-aggregates which indicates the Ψm [ ]. The enzyme activities of complex I (at 450 nm) and II (at 600 nm) in isolated mitochondrial fraction were measured using microplate immunocapture assay kits (Abcam, UK) according to the manufacturer’s protocols and expressed as mOD per minute per milligram of protein after protein normalization. The cytochrome c reducing capacity was measured in a 96-well format based on a method described by Kramer et al., with few modifications [ ]. The cytochrome c reduction capability of complex II + III is assessed by measuring its increase in absorbance at 550 nm and expressed as mOD per minute per milligram of protein after protein normalization. Whereas, cytochrome c oxidase assay kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was used to measure complex IV activity (at 550 nm) according to manufacturer’s protocol. The activity of cytochrome c oxidase is expressed in units per milligram per minute of protein [ ]. The total ATP levels (at 570 nm) were estimated using colorimetric-based assay kit (Abcam, UK) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and expressed as micromole per gram protein.
Estimation of Inflammatory Markers
L4–L6 spinal cords were homogenized by using tissue protein extraction reagent (T-PER) and the supernatant was collected after centrifuging the samples at 4000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were estimated using commercially available rat specific ELISA kits (eBiosciences Ltd., USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and the levels were expressed as picogram per milligram of protein from the standard curve after normalizing the protein content [ ].
Immunohistochemical Analysis
The collected sciatic nerves, DRG, and L4–L6 spinal cords were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and IHC was performed on 5-μm sections according to the protocol of Poly Excel HRP/DAB Detection System (PathnSitu Biotechnologies Pvt. Ltd., Hyderabad, India). Sciatic nerve and DRG sections were rehydrated and incubated with primary antibodies of phospho-AMPK and mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA, 1: 200 dilution) whereas the spinal cord sections were incubated with primary antibody of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (Abcam, UK, 1: 200 dilution). Sections were washed, counterstained with hematoxylin and observed under light OPTIKA microscope (Model no. B-293). Images were obtained under ×400 magnification and brown cells were considered as positive. The immunohistochemical scores were given as per the following scheme (1 = very low intensity, 2 = low intensity, 3 = moderate intensity, and 4 = high intensity).
Western Blotting Analysis
Sciatic nerve and spinal cord tissues were homogenized in T-PER (Thermo scientific, USA) containing 1% protease and phosphatase cocktail inhibitors (Sigma, USA). An equal amount of protein was loaded, separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred onto polyvinyl difluoride (PVDF) membrane followed by blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin solution for 1 h. Then, the membrane was incubated overnight with primary antibodies to AMPK, phospho-AMPK, Nrf2, MnSOD, and β-actin (1: 1000 dilution, Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA). Then, washed membranes were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1: 5000 dilution), and visualized by chemiluminescence. The relative band densities were quantified by densitometry using analyzing software (ImageJ 1.36; Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health, MD, USA). Equal loading of protein was confirmed by measuring β-actin expression.
Data Analysis
The data were expressed as the mean ± standard error of mean (SEM). The end-point data was statistically analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the data from the behavioral results were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance using the GraphPad Prism version-5.0 software (GraphPad software, San Diego, CA). Follow-up analysis was performed with Bonferroni’s Multiple Comparison Test. A probability level of p values < 0.05 were considered as statistically significant.
Results
RA Does Not Compromise the In Vitro Anti-tumor Activity of Oxaliplatin
Aimed at evaluating a possible interaction between the RA treatment and therapeutic activity of oxaliplatin, we measured the viability of colon cancer cell line HT-29 in presence of them. The exposure of oxaliplatin (0–50 μmol) showed IC 50 of 4.81 ± 1.21 μmol after 48 h, whereas, co-incubation of RA at 50 μmol with oxaliplatin for 48 h showed IC 50 of 4.2 ± 1.56 μmol. Hence, co-treatment of RA did not decrease the anti-tumor effects of oxaliplatin.
RA Improves Neuritogenesis, Prevents Loss of Ψm, and Maintains AMPK Homeostasis against Oxaliplatin-induced Toxicity in N2a Cells
Oxaliplatin (50 μmol) used for neuronal insult significantly ( p < 0.001) lost neurite outgrowth (Fig. 1 a). RA (50 μmol) treatment prevented oxaliplatin-induced neurodegeneration, and also promoted neurite outgrowth compared to oxaliplatin alone treated cells indicating its potential towards neuritogenesis to combat the stress conditions. RA treatment significantly ( p < 0.001) prevented the loss of Ψm compared to oxaliplatin alone treated cells indicating its capability to maintain the integrity of Ψm in vitro. RA treatment also significantly ( p < 0.05) maintained the AMPK levels and exhibited its neuroprotective potential (Fig. 1 b). The protective effects of RA were compared to the effects produced by Biochanin A treatment.

Whereas RA: normal N2a cells treated with RA alone at 50 μmol
Effect of Compound C on the Beneficial Effects of RA Treatment in the Oxaliplatin-insulted Neuro-2a Cells
The results have shown that the RA-induced neuritogenesis was not completely inhibited but significantly ( p < 0.001) halted by the co-treatment of compound C (a known AMPK inhibitor) in the oxaliplatin-insulted neuro-2a cells when compared to the cells treated with RA (Fig. 2 a &b). In a similar manner, compound C also affected the Ψm even in the presence of RA indicating its suppressing actions on RA beneficial effects (Fig. 2 c & d). The immunoblots also have shown that compound C affected the RA-induced AMPK levels and other mitochondrial antioxidants levels like Nrf2 and MnSOD (Fig 2 e &f).

General Toxicity
The general toxicity of RA treatment in the experimental animal groups was monitored on a daily basis. No deterioration in the general status was observed. Although oxaliplatin-administered animals appeared less active compared to normal control animals, there was no considerable effect on mortality.
RA Reverses the Oxaliplatin-induced Functional Changes and Blocks Neuropathic Pain
There were no significant differences found in the basal readings obtained from the functional or behavioral assessment. At the end of the treatments, oxaliplatin-induced deficits were clearly evident, where it significantly ( p < 0.001) decreased SNCV (Fig. 3 a). Although the administration of oxaliplatin in the first week showed no significant difference in sensory thresholds in any of the groups, at the third and fourth weeks, a significant ( p < 0.001) development of thermal, mechanical hyperalgesia, and allodynia were observed in oxaliplatin group compared to the normal control group. RA (50 mg/kg, po ) treatment significantly ( p < 0.01) prevented the deficit in nerve conduction velocities compared to the oxaliplatin rats. The mean score of chemical cold allodynia in response to acetone spray also significantly ( p < 0.001) reduced with the continuous treatment of RA (25 and 50 mg/kg, po ) compared to oxaliplatin treated rats by the 28th day (Fig. 3 b). It also significantly ( p < 0.001) increased the paw withdrawal latencies to cold stimuli ((Fig. 3 c), increased the paw withdrawal threshold to Von Frey fibers and Randall-Selitto analgesiometer (Fig. 3 d, e, respectively) at both doses by the 28th day. RA per se group did not show any significant functional and behavioral changes as compared to normal control rats.

RA Abrogates Oxaliplatin-induced Lipid Peroxidation, Nitrite Levels, and DNA Fragmentation
The levels of MDA and nitrite in the sciatic nerve were significantly ( p < 0.001) elevated in oxaliplatin-injected rats compared to the control rats (Fig. 4 a, b). RA treatment (50 mg/kg, po ) significantly ( p < 0.001) reduced lipid peroxidation and the nitrite levels indicating its antioxidant potential in vivo. The mean number of cells with DNA fragmentation was significantly ( p < 0.001) increased in sciatic nerve samples of rats in oxaliplatin group compared to normal control rats which were significantly ( p < 0.001) reduced with the RA treatment (Fig. 4 c) and the fluorescent images were shown in Fig. 4 d.

RA Improves Mitochondrial Function and Its Antioxidant Potential
Oxaliplatin significantly ( p < 0.001) decreased the Ψm (Fig. 5 a) and diminished the complex I, II, III, and IV activities in the sciatic nerves samples of rats. RA treatment significantly ( p < 0.001) prevented loss of Ψm and significantly ( p < 0.05 at 50 mg/kg, po ) improved the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) functions (Fig. 5 b–e). The treatment also significantly ( p < 0.01 at 50 mg/kg, po ) prevented the oxaliplatin-induced loss of ATP levels which is an indicative of an improved mitochondrial function and bioenergetic status (Fig. 5 f). The levels of MnSOD were significantly ( p < 0.05) reduced in the oxaliplatin-administered rats which were restored by RA treatment (Fig. 5 g).

RA Reduces the Oxaliplatin-induced Spinal Cord Inflammation
Oxaliplatin significantly ( p < 0.001) increased the GFAP expression in the L4–L6 spinal cord indicating astrocyte activation and this was significantly ( p < 0.01 at 50 mg/kg, po ) curbed down by the RA treatment (Fig. 6 a). Oxaliplatin-treated rats displayed inflated levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in the spinal cord which was significantly ( p < 0.001) by RA treatment (Fig. 6 b).

RA Treatment Maintained the AMPK Levels in Sciatic Nerve and DRG
Immunohistochemistry of sciatic nerve and DRG (Fig. 7 a) showed a significant ( p < 0.05) reduction in the phospho-AMPK levels after oxaliplatin treatment and the western blotting results also resonated the similar outcomes with respect to phospho-AMPK in the sciatic nerve. RA treatment significantly ( p < 0.01 at 50 mg/kg, po ) restored the phospho-AMPK levels compared to the oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy rats (Fig. 7 b).

Discussion
Our current study explored the therapeutic potential of RA as a neuroprotectant in the experimental model of OIPN against oxaliplatin-mediated oxidative/nitrosative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and glia-induced inflammation. The basic in vitro screening showed that RA treatment without compromising anti-cancer potential of oxaliplatin in HT-29 cells significantly reduced oxaliplatin-induced ROS production. It prevented the loss of Ψm and neurodegeneration in N2a cells indicating its neuroprotective properties. The preclinical studies have revealed that the oxaliplatin-induced functional, behavioral, and biochemical deficits with oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are critical contributors to the pathogenesis of neuropathy. Oxaliplatin (4 mg/kg i.p.) administration produced an early and prolonged thermal (cold) and mechanical hypersensitivity with an associated decrease in nerve conduction velocities which were in accordance with the previous reports [ ]. RA treatment markedly reversed the oxaliplatin established neuropathic pain by increasing the paw withdrawal thresholds and latencies to the nociceptive stimulus. Oxaliplatin significantly induced oxidative/nitrosative stress and DNA fragmentation which was appreciably reduced by the RA treatment owing to its antioxidant properties. Accumulating evidence suggests that oxaliplatin produced free radicals which may damage the mitochondrial proteins associated with a respiratory chain and alter Ψm, reduce ATP production leading to the neuronal bioenergetic crisis and neuronal apoptosis [ , ]. Swelling and vacuolation of mitochondria in the peripheral sensory neurons and mitochondrial abnormalities have also been reported with the oxaliplatin treatment [ ]. In accordance with these reports, we also found the functional deficits and the bioenergetic crisis in the sciatic nerves of oxaliplatin administered rats. It is a well-established fact that mitochondrial impairment plays an important role in the pro-inflammatory signaling and vice-versa [ , ]. Dysfunctional mitochondria increase oxidative stress which promotes the vicious cycle of the inflammatory damage. Furthermore, inflammatory cascades mediates the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines can damage the ETC proteins, decrease ATP production, and causes loss of Ψm [ , ]. We also observed similar changes in mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammatory responses in oxaliplatin administered rats.
Oxaliplatin administration can activate astrocytes and microglia which plays a key role in the inflammatory responses and central sensitization [ , ]. Especially, microglia activation leads to the activation of p38 MAPK signaling which has been linked to the development of sensorimotor changes [ ]. Multiple studies suggest the role of glial activation in OIPN characterized by neuronal apoptosis and activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α and IL-6 [ ]. These cytokines can directly sensitize the nociceptors thus, play an important role in the allodynia and hyperalgesia like pain perceptions [ , ]. P38 MAPKs are well-known to initiate neuropathic pain symptoms like cold allodynia and responsible for the pain hypersensitivity [ , ]. Neuropathic pain is currently aimed only at reducing symptoms, generally by suppressing neuronal hyperexcitability. In contrast, targeting mitochondrial dysfunction and glial cells induced inflammation may provide many opportunities for the treatment by abrogating the actual neuropathologies that support the development of persistent pain.
Our study revealed that RA treatment prevented loss of Ψm and ETC dysfunction, and improved the production of ATP levels. It also increased the antioxidant potential of mitochondria by improving the MnSOD levels in the peripheral nerve and DRG of oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy. RA treatment also notably inhibited the astrocyte activation by reducing the levels of GFAP in the spinal cord. Moreover, RA decreases the production of TNF-α and IL-6 indicating its potential to inhibit the glial cell-mediated inflammation. These potential beneficial effects of RA treatment were found to be due to its various direct and indirect mechanisms like MAPK inhibition, AMPK modulatory effects, and mitoprotective properties. Recent studies also complement our claim that AMPK has an impact on pain in the animal models of neuropathy and acute nociception [ , , ]. AMPK activation was found to be associated with anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the activation of glial cells and also by decreasing the levels of glial cell-mediated inflammatory cytokines [ , ]. AMPK also has been implicated in the regulation of energy homeostasis, to boost the mitochondrial function, and therefore, inhibits the neurodegeneration [ , ]. Besides its role as an energy sensor, it has also been cited to prevent mitochondrial dysfunction and to regulate glial activation that contribute to the etiopathogenesis of OIPN [ , ]. Recent reports indicated that AMPK activation could inhibit the development of neuropathic pain in various experimental models [ , , , ]. However, RA treatment in the current study significantly maintained the levels of phosphorylated AMPK in the sciatic nerves and DRG in oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy rats. These experimental outcomes can be correlated to its inhibition of glial activation and mitoprotective properties which advocate for its protective effect against functional and behavioral deficits. We have also evaluated the beneficial effects of RA in the presence of known AMPK inhibitor, compound C, in vitro experimentations where the compound C partially affected the neuritogenesis, restoration of ψm, and induction of mitochondrial antioxidants. These results indicate that suggests that some of the therapeutic benefits of RA could be through the AMPK activation along with their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions. Therefore, the results from this study point towards a role of RA, in the attenuation of mitochondrial dysfunction in peripheral nerve, glia-mediated inflammation in spinal cord, and neurodegeneration. So, our findings imply that the potential beneficial effects of RA treatment were due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and mitoprotective properties. These protective effects might be through various direct or indirect mechanisms where AMPK activation might be one of the mechanisms, which helped in the maintenance of healthy nerve cells and DRGs.
AMPK activation could participate in the prevention of the oxaliplatin-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and glia-mediated inflammation, and thus alleviate OIPN. Therefore, RA resolves oxaliplatin-induced neuropathic pain by preventing mitochondrial dysfunction and glial cell-mediated inflammation which warrants further evaluation of RA for translational success.
