Introduction
The word ‘epilepsy’ is derived from the Greek word “epilambanein”, which means “to seize upon” or “to attack” (Paramdeep et al. ). Epilepsy is the second most common neurological disorder that affects about 70 million people worldwide, out of which 80% are in developing countries (Yemadje et al. ). Studies show that up to 50% of patients with epilepsy develop psychiatric disorders, the most common being depression, anxiety and psychotic disturbances (Marsh and Rao ).
The adverse effects of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) often result in patient non-compliance and reduction in drug effectiveness. Although the newer AEDs may have better adverse effect profile when compared to the older generation, they still have significant CNS-related effects such as decreased cognitive abilities and psychiatric complications (Schmidt ). This suggests the need for safer but efficacious drugs. The World Health Organization ( ) has reported that 80% of the emerging world’s population depends on traditional medicine. Herbal remedies remain a major aspect of traditional medicine and are widely used because of the common belief that they are cheaper, safer and more culturally acceptable to people.
Caladium bicolor (CB) Aiton of family Araceae is an ornamental foliage plant grown from tubers. It is indigenous to South and Central America. In Nigeria, it is found most commonly in Calabar and Akwa Ibom States by the roadside, in school premises and in farmlands. The aqueous extract of Caladium bicolor has been shown to possess antidiarrhoeal effect (Salako et al. ). The tubers are used as emetic and purgative in Brazil (Clay and Hubbard ). In Nigeria, the leaves and tubers are used topically for boils, wounds and ulcers (Odugbemi ). The antiangiogenic, antitoxic and antioxidant properties of the methanol leaf extracts of C. bicolor have also been studied (Tosoc ). Akhigbemen et al. ( ) have also studied the acute and sub acute effect of methanol leaf extract of C. bicolor . There seems to be no scientific report evaluating the use of the leaf extract for the treatment of convulsion-related disorders by herbalists in Nigeria. In this study, we evaluated some of the neuropharmacological effects of the leaf extracts in mice.
Materials and methods
Plant material and extraction
Fresh leaves of CB were collected from the horticultural garden of the University of Benin, Benin City, Nigeria in July 2015. The plant was identified and authenticated by Mallam I. Muazzam of the Department of Medicinal Plant Research and Traditional Medicine, National Institute for Pharmaceutical Research and Development (NIPRD), Abuja, Nigeria where a voucher specimen (NIPRD.H.7035) has been deposited. The leaves were shade-dried to constant weight and powdered. A quantity (500 g) was macerated in 2 L of methanol for 72 h with intermittent shaking and stirring. The mixture was then filtered and the filtrate concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure in an oven at 50 °C. The dried whole extract (WE) was stored at 4 °C until use. A fresh batch (1.5 g) of the leaves was subjected to successive extraction in a Soxhlet apparatus with 1 L of solvent starting with the solvent of least polarity to highest (i.e., n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and methanol). The temperature was kept at the boiling point for each solvent (69, 76.5 and 64.7 °C) respectively. The extracts were concentrated using a rotary evaporator, dried in an oven at 50 °C and kept in a refrigerator till further use.
Mice
Experiments were performed using Swiss albino mice (20–33 g). They were in-bred in the Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Benin, Benin City, Nigeria. The mice were housed in plastic cages under natural lighting and temperature conditions. They were fed with standard chow (Top Feeds, Nigeria Plc) and water ad libitum. All experiments were carried out in accordance with the Institute for Laboratory Mouse Research Guidelines for the Care and Use of laboratory Mice (NRC ). Ethical approval (Reference number: EC/FP/017/03) was obtained from the institutional Animal Ethics Committee. Food was withdrawn before and during the experiment.
Drugs and chemicals
Drugs used include strychnine and pentylenetetrazole (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), diazepam (Roche, Switzerland), phenobarbitone (BDH Chemicals, UK), and imipramine (Teva, Israel). They were all prepared fresh in distilled water before administration. WE and ME were reconstituted in 5% Tween-80 while HE and EA were reconstituted in olive oil.
Phytochemical screening
The whole extract was screened for the presence of carbohydrate, tannins, proteins, alkaloids, flavonoids, steroidal nucleus, cardiac glycosides and phenolic compounds using conventional methods (Sofowora ; Evans ).
Strychnine-induced convulsion
Mice were randomly allotted to five groups ( n = 5 each). Group I (negative control) was treated orally with 0.2 ml of the vehicle (5% Tween 80) while groups II, III, IV and V were given oral doses of 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg of WE and 2 mg/kg of diazepam respectively. One hour later, 1 mg/kg of strychnine was administered i.p. to all the mice. Each mouse was observed for onset of convulsion or death for a period of 30 min (Porter et al. ). The test was repeated for HE,ME and EA.
Pentylenetetrazole-induced convulsion
Mice were randomly allotted to five groups ( n = 5 each). Group I (negative control) was treated orally with 0.2 ml of the vehicle while groups II, III, IV and V were orally administered 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg of WE and 2 mg/kg diazepam, respectively. One hour later, 70 mg/kg of pentylenetetrazole was administered i.p. to mice in all the groups. The animals were observed for onset of tonic-clonic convulsion or death for a period of 30 min (Vogel and Vogel ). The test was repeated for HE, ME and EA.
Maximal electroshock-induced convulsion
The method described by (Swinyard et al. ) was used. Mice were randomly allotted to five groups ( n = 5 each). Group I served as negative control and was treated orally with 0.2 ml of the vehicle. Groups II, III, and IV were given 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg of WE orally and Group V received 30 mg/kg of phenobarbitone (p.o.). One hour later, all mice were subjected to electroshock using a current of 50 mA for 0.2 s through a pair of ear clip electrodes (Ugo Basile model 16,182). The onset of tonic-hind limb extension as well as protection was noted. The test was repeated for HE, ME and EA.
Elevated plus maze test
Mice were randomly allotted to 5 groups of 5 mice each. Group I (negative control) received 0.2 ml of the vehicle orally while groups II, III and V received 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg of WE orally, and group IV received 2 mg/kg of diazepam orally. An hour later, each mouse was placed at the center of the maze, facing one of the open arms. The time spent in closed and open arms within 5 min was recorded using a stop watch. The test was repeated for HE, ME and EA (Sen et al. ).
Forced swim test
Mice were randomly allotted to 5 groups of 5 mice each. Group I received 0.2 ml of the vehicle orally and served as negative control while groups II, III, IV, and V received 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg of WE orally, and 25 mg/kg of imipramine respectively. An hour later, each mouse was forced to swim in an open square tank (25 cm × 25 cm), filled with 15 cm of water (Porsolt et al. ). Total immobility time was recorded for the last 4 min out of a 6-min duration test. Water in the tank was changed with each group. In this test, mice were isolated from exposure to sound. The test was repeated for HE, ME and EA.
Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as Mean ± S.E.M (standard error of mean) and were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnett’s post hoc test (GraphPrism® version 6, San Diego, USA). P < 0.05 indicates significant difference between compared data.
Results
Phytochemical constituents of whole extract
Preliminary phytochemical screening of WE showed that it tested positive for carbohydrate, protein, alkaloid and flavonoid, but negative for tannins, compounds with steroidal nucleus, cardiac glycosides and phenolic compounds.
Strychnine-induced convulsion
The whole extract (WE) offered 20% protection at a dose of 100 mg/kg with no significant difference in latency to tonic convulsion when compared to the control. At doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg, WE produced 100% protection against strychnine-induced convulsion (Fig. 1 ). None of HE, EA and ME protected against strychnine-induced convulsion at doses of 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg (Figs. 2 , 3 and 4 ). In Fig. 2 doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg HE significantly shortened the latency to tonic convulsion when compared to the control ( P < 0.05; P < 0.01 respectively). As shown in Fig. 3 , this effect was not dose-dependent in the case of EA which was significant at 100 and 400 mg/kg (P < 0.01, P < 0.05 respectively).

Pentylenetetrazole -induced convulsion
Single dose of PTZ produced hind-limb tonic seizures in all the mice administered 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg of WE, HE, EA and ME. With respect to latency to convulsion, there was no significant difference between WE and control group (Fig. 5 ) but HE increased the latency to tonic convulsion at doses of 100 mg/kg ( P < 0.0001), 200 mg/kg ( P < 0.001) and 400 mg/kg (P < 0.001) (Fig. 6 ). ME and EA also increased the latency to tonic convulsion at doses of 200 mg/kg (P < 0.001) and 400 mg/kg ( P < 0.01) respectively when compared to the control (Figs. 7 and 8 ).

Effect of extracts on maximal electroshock induced convulsions
Table 1 show that there was no protection against hind limb extension seizure (HLES) at doses of 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg of WE. However, HE exhibited 60% protection against HLES at 100 mg/kg and 100% protection at 200 and 400 mg/kg respectively. EA protected all mice at 100 and 400 mg/kg but offered 60% protection at 200 mg/kg. ME offered 40% protection at 100 and 400 mg/kg and 20% protection at 200 mg/kg.

Effect of extracts on time spent by mice in the open arm of the elevated plus maze apparatus
Figure 9 shows the time spent by mice on the arms of the elevated plus maze. The duration of time spent in the open arm decreased significantly ( P < 0.05) at the dose of 100 mg/kg but increased significantly ( P < 0.0001) at 200 mg/kg of WE. The n-hexane extract (HE) also significantly decreased the time spent in the open arm at a dose of 200 mg/kg ( P < 0.0001) but significantly ( P < 0.05) increased the time at 400 mg/kg. The ethyl acetate extract (EA) on the other hand, significantly ( P < 0.01) decreased the time spent in the open arm at a dose of 200 mg/kg. The methanol extract (ME) significantly ( P < 0.0001)decreased the time spent in the open arm at the dose of 100 mg/kg but significantly ( P < 0.0001) increased the time at 400 mg/kg.

Effect of extracts on the duration of immobility in model of depression
In Figs. 10 , 11 , 12 and 13 the effects of extracts on forced swimming test model of depression are shown. At doses of 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg, WE significantly (P < 0.0001) decreased the duration of immobility in comparison with the control (Fig. 10 ). With HE, a significant ( P < 0.001) decrease was noted at the doses of 100 and 400 mg/kg but there was a significant ( P < 0.01) increase at 200 mg/kg (Fig. 11 ). Figure 12 shows that EA also significantly reduced the duration of immobility at doses of 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg (P < 0.05, P < 0.01, P < 0.0001 respectively). Similarly, ME significantly reduced the duration of immobility (P < 0.05) at 100 mg/kg and (P < 0.01) at 200 and 400 mg/kg (Fig. 13 ).

Discussion
The extracts demonstrated anticonvulsant activities to varying degrees. In the strychnine model the whole extract offered protection comparable to diazepam possibly via potentiation of the inhibitory neurotransmitter glycine. Strychnine produces its convulsant effect as a non-competitive blocker of the inhibitory neurotransmitter glycine (Adeyemi et al. ). Diazepam on the other hand potentiates GABAergic neurotransmission (Chindo et al. ).
Pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) induces convulsion by binding to picrotoxin sites of the GABA A receptor complex thus, inhibiting chloride conductance (Macdonald and Kelly ). Drugs that are effective against PTZ-induced convulsions are effective against myoclonic and absence seizures (Wolfgang ). The various extracts of C. bicolor increased the latency to PTZ-induced convulsion. Phytochemicals such as flavonoids inhibit seizure generation via direct activation of inhibitory GABAergic receptors or through the benzodiazepine receptor resulting in increased chloride ion influx that cause neuronal hyperpolarisation (Singh et al. ). Flavonoids being non-polar phtochemical constituent are more likely to be present in the n-hexane extract thus accounting for increased latency to convulsion even at a low dose.
Drugs such as phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbitone abolish MES-induced convulsions by inhibiting Na + channels. The MES test is effective against generalised tonic-clonic seizures (Kasthuri ). Flavonoids have also been found to modulate neuronal channels via inhibition of voltage gated Na + channels resulting in decrease Na + influx into the cell (Paramdeep et al. ). The flavonoid constituent of the plant extracts may be acting through this mechanism to protect against MES-induced seizures.
Increases in the time spent in the open arms of the maze indicate anxiolytic effects. It is known that anxiolytic agents such as diazepam increase the frequency of entries and the time spent in open arms of the elevated plus maze (Pellow et al. ). Most anxiolytic agents exert their action by opening of activated GABA-chloride channel (Sampath et al. ). The extracts significantly increased the time of stay in the open arm of the maze thereby indicating an axiolytic-like effect. The mechanism seems to be related to the enhancement GABAergic neurotransmission by constituents of the extracts, most likely the flavonoids.
The forced swim test is used to evaluate antidepressant effect of drugs. Different studies have shown that swimming is perculiar to serotonergic agents such as fluoxetine (a serotonin reuptake inhibitor), whereas climbing is perculiar to tricyclic antidepressant agents, and drugs with selective effects on noradrenergic transmission (Detke et al. ; Page et al. ). Imipramine a tricyclic antidepressant acts by inhibiting the reuptake of neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine. All extracts reduced the duration of immobility in the forced swim test indicative of antidepressant-like effect that may be associated with serotonergic mechanisms. It is not immediately clear if this effect involves prevention of reuptake or other mechanisms that improve synaptic availability of the monoamines as has been reported for some flavonoids (Zheng et al. ; Guan and Liu ).
In conclusion, the leaf extracts of C. bicolor possess anticonvulsant, anxiolytic and antidepressant-like neuropharmacological properties that underscore their use in ethnomedicine. The efficacy of the extracts however, require further evaluations.
