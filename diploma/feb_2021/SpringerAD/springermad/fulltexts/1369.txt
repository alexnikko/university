Introduction
Myxozoans are widespread and economically important cnidarian parasites; they are well known for their infections of fish (Abdel-Ghaffar et al. ; Székely and Molnár ) . Within the myxozoans, Myxobolus Bütschli, 1882 is the most speciose genus, comprising more than 900 known species worldwide (Eiras et al. , ; Liu et al. ; Lom and Dyková ; Naldoni et al. ; Székely et al. ). Most of these species have been traditionally defined using morphological and biological traits (host/organ specificity and tissue tropism) to resolve taxonomic conflicts (Molnár , ; Molnár et al. ; Székely et al. ; Liu et al. ). Since the beginning of the twenty-first century, the molecular marker (mainly the small subunit ribosomal DNA) has been used extensively to provide a more comprehensive strategy to discriminate between morphologically complex species (Székely et al. ; Okamura et al. ). Thus, the use of three approaches in combination (morphology, biological traits, and molecular markers) have yielded a well-accepted holistic framework for myxozoan classification (Atkinson et al. ; Fiala et al. ; Forró and Eszterbauer ; Heiniger and Adlard ).
Yellow catfish Tachysurus fulvidraco is a freshwater fish mostly distributed in East and Southeast Asia (Liu ). In China, its annual output has increased by 356 million kg (Yuan and Zhao ). Given the importance of this host species, it has been examined for parasites, and 23 myxozoan species have been described based on their different infection sites (Chen and Ma ). Few of these descriptions have corresponding molecular data.
Herein, as part of a continuing study of freshwater myxozoans biodiversity, a Myxobolus species was sampled from the fins of yellow catfish. The spore morphology, host affinity, and organ affected by this Myxobolus species were similar to those of Myxobolus physophilus previously recorded in China (Chen ; Chen and Ma ). However, M. physophilus was originally reported in Russia from the air bladder of common rudd Scardinius erythrophthalmus Linnaeus, 1758 (Reuss ). Later, a Myxobolus species in China was attributed to M. physophilus from the fins and urinary bladder of T. fulvidraco based on morphological classification (Chen ). Subsequently, Chen and Ma ( ) recorded the same species from multi-infection sites of extensively distributed multi-fish hosts, including the gills of Abbottina rivularis Basilewsky, 1855, the kidney and urinary bladder of Tachysurus nitidus Sauvage and Dabry de Thiersant, 1874, and the gills, kidney, and fins of T. fulvidraco and Sarcocheilichthys sinensis Bleeker, 1871.
Taking in to account the usually strict tissue specificity of myxozoans (Molnár , ; Molnár and Eszterbauer ), it would be unexpected for a single species to be reported in multi-infection sites of multi-fish hosts as reported previously (Chen ; Chen and Ma ). To resolve existing uncertainties in the Chinese records of M. physophilus (Chen ; Chen and Ma ), the newly collected material was characterized considering a combination of three approaches (morphological characteristics, biological traits, and DNA sequence data) for myxozoan species identification.
Materials and methods
Host sampling and morphological analysis
Yellow catfish Tachysurus fulvidraco were collected using a fine-meshed seine from the fish pond in Xiantao, Hubei, China, in April 2016 ( n = 50; total length 16–33 cm; weight 41–73 g). Specimens were transported alive to the Department of Aquatic Animal Medicine, College of Fisheries, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, Hubei, China, and held in aquaria prior to being euthanized with an overdose of MS-222 (Sigma-Aldrich, Co., Ltd., St. Louis, MO., USA). Standard techniques were utilized for myxosporean examination within 24 h of transportation (Lom and Dykovà ).
Macroscopic inspection (external and internal) was conducted for the detection of visible myxozoan cysts. For microscopic examination, squash samples were prepared from various vital organs, including the gills, skin, intestine, kidney, spleen, liver, gallbladder, and urinary bladder. For parasitological examinations, fresh smears were visualized and photographed by a BX53 Olympus light microscope (Nomarski differential interference contrast) equipped with an Olympus DP73 digital camera, using CellSens software (Olympus, Hamburg, Germany). Myxospores (50 data points for each dimension ) were measured by means of digitized images using Adobe Photoshop CC software (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA, USA). Mean and standard deviations of fresh myxospore dimensions were calculated. Line drawings were drawn with the guide of digitized images using Adobe Photoshop CC software.
Histopathological examination
Biopsies of infected tissue were fixed in Bouin’s solution, gradient-dehydrated, embedded in paraffin wax, sectioned at 4–6 μm and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H & E). Slides were viewed and photographed by the abovementioned microscope.
DNA extraction, amplification, and sequencing
The squash samples were prepared from fresh samples of three different infected fish and centrifuged at 10,000× g for 5 min. Genomic DNA was extracted from pelleted myxospores using the TIANamp Genomic DNA Kit (TIANGEN Biotech, Beijing, China). The SSU rDNA sequence was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using 18e (Hillis and Dixon ) and 18R (Whipps et al. ) primer pairs in a 50-μl reaction mixture, containing 25 μl 2× PrimeSTAR® Max Premix (Takara, Dalian, China), 2 μl of each primer, 17 μl distilled water, and approximately 150–200 ng of genomic DNA. The PrimeSTAR® Max DNA Polymerase (Takara, Dalian, China) was used to ensure a high-fidelity sequence. Amplification conditions included an initial denaturation at 98 °C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles at 98 °C for 10 s, 55 °C for 15 s, 72 °C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72 °C for 3 min. The PCR products were electrophoresed through 1% agarose gels, purified using a Universal DNA Purification Kit (TIANGEN Biotech, Beijing, China) and cloned into the pMD19-T vector system (Takara, Dalian, China). Before cloning in the pMD19-T vector, A-tailing was performed in a 20-μl reaction mixture comprised of 14.5 μl amplified product, 3 μl deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), 2 μl Taq Buffer, and 0.5 μl Taq DNA Polymerase (CWBIO, Beijing, China) at 72 °C for 20 min. Inserts from three positive clones were sequenced with an ABI PRISM® 3730XL DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster, USA) using M13F, M13R, and middle primer 5W1F 5′-GACAAATCACTTCACGAAC-3′.
Phylogenetic analyses
The obtained contiguous sequences were determined to have originated from a myxozoan ( Myxobolus ) by BLAST search. To explore the phylogenetic relationship of the isolated species, 35 sequences consisted of BLAST hits and prior phylogenies were retrieved from the NCBI nucleotide database. Ceratonova shasta was used as an out-group taxon. The dataset was aligned in MAFFT 7.271 (Katoh and Standley ) and corrected manually using a sequence alignment editor program BioEdit (Hall ). The putative gaps or ambiguous regions were deleted to ensure the comparison of homologous positions. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted by the Bayesian inference (BI) and maximum likelihood (ML) methods. The best evolutionary model of nucleotide substitution for the ML and BI analyses was determined by MrModeltest v. 2.3 (Nylander ), which identified the optimal evolutionary model as the general time reversible model (GTR + I + G) using the Akaike information criteria (AIC). ML analysis was conducted using PhyML v. 3.0 (Guindon et al. ). Nucleotide frequencies were determined (A = 0.2677, C = 0.1890, G = 0.2679, T = 0.2754) and the six rates of nucleotide substitution were calculated as AC = 0.8674, AG = 3.2432, AT = 1.7124, CG = 0.6639, CT = 4.9663, and GT = 1.0000. The proportion of invariable sites was 0.2880, and the alpha value of the gamma distribution parameter was 0.4060. Bootstrap confidence values were calculated with 1000 replicates. Bayesian analysis was performed in MrBayes v. 3.1 (Ronquist and Huelsenbeck ) by means of the above evolutionary model, with 1 × 10 6 generations and tree samples per 100 generations and a burn-in of 2500 trees. The resulting topologies were annotated with MEGA v. 6.06 software package (Tamura et al. ).
Results
Of the 50 yellow catfish specimens, 3 (6%) were found bearing pinkish flower-like aggregates of cysts and tended to exist at the tips of fins (Fig. 1 ). Approximately 18–30 cysts per infected fish were observed. After rupturing the cysts, mature myxospores with two unequal polar capsules were observed, morphologically consistent with a Myxobolus species. This Myxobolus species was considered to be conspecific with Chinese records of Myxobolus physophilus (Figs. 2 and 3 , Table 1 ). However, both our species and the previous records from China are inconsistent with the original description of M. physophilus (Figs. 2 and 3 , Table 1 ). As we propose a new species, Myxobolus xiantaoensis n. sp., to account for our observations and to replace previous records of M. physophilus from China.

Morphological description
Myxospores were pyriform in the frontal view (Figs. 2 a, b, and 3 a, b), biconvex in sutural view (Figs. 2 c, d, and 3 c, d), pointed anteriorly, and rounded posteriorly, measuring 12.6 ± 0.6 (11.3–13.9) μm long, 9.6 ± 0.6 (8.4–11.1) μm wide, and 7.1 ± 0.4 (6.1–7.7) μm thick. A transparent mucous envelope was occasionally observed in the posterior end of a few myxospores (Fig. 2 b, d). Two unequally sized and eggplant-shaped polar capsules were present in the apical part of the myxospore. The larger polar capsule was 6.83 ± 0.5 (6.0–8.1) μm long and 3.4 ± 0.2 (3.0–3.8) μm wide, while the smaller one was 6.4 ± 0.3 (5.5–7.4) μm in length and 3.6 ± 0.2 (3.2–3.9) μm in width. Inside the polar capsules, polar filaments were coiled by 6–8 turns. The intracapsular appendix was almost 1/6th of the total length of spore (Figs. 2 and 3 a–d). Sporoplasm nuclei and iodinophilous vacuoles were not prominent.
Histopathology
Histological examination showed that cysts developed under the epidermis, on the surface of hemisegments (Figs. 4 a, e, f, g). Many small plasmodia were joined together to produce a large cyst covered by a relatively thick connective tissue capsule (Fig. 4 ). A number of alarming cells (club cells or leydig cells), mucus cells, and mononuclear cells were observed in the epidermis of fins (Fig. 4 b–d). M. xiantaoensis n. sp. markedly deforms the cartilaginous substance of the fin-rays (Fig. 4 a, e, f–h). Moreover, the developing cysts substantially change the structure of the hemisegments of fin-ray (Fig. 4 e). Within the developing cysts, the cartilage can be found, as small cartilaginous islets, in the cysts capsule (Figs. 4 a).

Molecular data
A 1990-bp-long SSU rDNA sequence (GenBank KY421105) was generated for the present Myxobolus species. Based on GenBank BLAST analysis, the SSU rDNA sequence of the present isolates was most similar to those of Myxobolus pseudowulii (94.0% sequence identity; 100% coverage; KY229918), Myxobolus voremkhai (91.0% sequence identity; 100% coverage; KY229919), and Myxobolus branchicola (90.0% sequence identity; 100% coverage; JN616264). The ML and BI analyses produced similar tree topologies, although with slightly different support values at the branch nodes (Fig. 5 ). In the light of the result of the phylogenetic analysis, species clustered in three clades: clade I consisted of Myxobolus , Unicauda , Henneguya , and Thelohanellus species; clade II consisted of Myxobolus , and Henneguya species; and clade III consisted of the species of genus Myxobolus (Fig. 5 ). M. xiantaoensis n. sp. was sister to M. pseudowulii in clade I that included the myxozoan species infecting the Siluriformes fishes from China, Malaysia, and the USA (Fig. 5 ).

The scale bar corresponds to 2 substitutions per 100 nucleotide positions
Remarks
Comparative analyses (morphometric data, biological traits, and images) of species infecting the fins of Siluriformes (including yellow catfish from China) showed that in addition to M. physophilus , the four other Myxobolus species recorded by Chen and Ma ( ) ( Myxobolus aureatus Ward, 1919, Myxobolus oviformis Thélohan, 1892, Myxobolus ochowensis Chen in Chen & Ma, 1998, and Myxobolus huamaensis Liu 2014) also had overlapping features with M. xiantaoensis n. sp. (Table 1 ). Although all these descriptions lacked molecular data, M. xiantaoensis n. sp. clearly showed a unique morphology, in terms of the spore shape and size, and lesions, which were flower-like. Notably, M. xiantaoensis n. sp. and its conspecific Chinese records were clearly differed from the original description of M. physophilus in spore shape (Fig. 3 ) and biological traits (Table 1 ). It is difficult to compare the real tissue specificity of M. xiantaoensis n. sp. and M. physophilus because the original description does not offer a detailed reference to the tissue in which parasite development occurred.
Discussion
To facilitate myxozoan species identification, spores were collected from cysts present on the fins of yellow catfish and studied by morphological, biological, and molecular methods. A holistic comparison of the present Myxobolus species with all other Myxobolus species was undertaken, as traditional morphological-based myxozoan classification systems are lacking in reliability (Atkinson et al. ). The present Myxobolus species were considered highly similar to Chinese records describing Myxobolus physophilus (Chen ; Chen and Ma ) in characteristic features of spore morphology (listed in Table 1 ) and biological traits (host affinity, infection site, and locality). Although the separate morphometrics for smaller and larger polar capsules (length × width) were not given in the former Chinese descriptions (Table 1 ), the line drawings of spores clearly showed unequal polar capsules (Fig. 3 e). Our spore measurements were completed in fresh samples, and thus, these measurements may have been slightly variable than those made in previous Chinese descriptions due to the following reasons: (1) use of different preparative or (2) difference in morphological methods.
The present Myxobolus species and two Chinese records of M. physophilus (Fig. 3 f–h) differed from the original description of M. physophilus (Fig. 3 e) in terms of its morphological features, including its spore shape (oval vs. pyriform), intercapsular appendix (absent vs. present), and polar capsule (equal vs. unequal). According to the classification system of Molnár ( ), myxozoans are strictly host/organ/tissue specific. However, both the present Myxobolus species and the Chinese records did not correspond well to the original description of M. physophilus in terms of either host affinity ( Scardinius erythrophthalmus vs. Tachysurus fulvidraco ) and organ affected (air bladder vs. fins). Taken together, these data suggest that Chinese records are easily distinguishable species from the original description of M. physophilus. Based on this evidence, we proposed the Myxobolus species of present samples and Chinese records of M. physophilus from fins of yellow catfish are conspecific and represent a new species, termed Myxobolus xiantaoensis n. sp.
Phylogenetic analyses revealed that M. xiantaoensis n. sp. was positioned within a mixed clade of Myxobolus , Unicauda , Henneguya , and Thelohanellus species (Fig. 5 ). This tree was largely congruent with previous studies on phylogenetic analyses of genus Myxobolus (Eszterbauer ; Fiala ; Fiala et al. ; Holzer et al. ; Zhang et al. ). Previous studies reported that myxozoan from Cypriniformes fishes (Fiala ), Salmoniformes fishes (Ferguson et al. ), and Siluriformes fishes (Zhang et al. ) tended to form clusters correlating with host affinity. In line with these results, myxozoan species clusters with M. xiantaoensis n. sp. infecting Siluriformes fishes from China (predominantly) and Malaysia form a cluster, suggesting that host affinity is a strong phylogenetic signal (Fig. 5 ).
To conclude, this study underscores the expediency of spore morphology in conjunction with biological traits and phylogenetic analysis in myxozoan characterization. In general, this method must be applied in a systematic way, particularly to differentiate between morphologically described cryptic species or sister-species of myxozoans. In the present work, it allowed a sound integrative taxonomic revision of M. physophilus recorded from the fins of yellow catfish in Chinese records as M. xiantaoensis n. sp. In Chinese records, beside yellow catfish, M. physophilus were also recorded to infect multi-infection sites of the extensively distributed multi-fish hosts based on spore morphology (Table 1 ). Here, we provide the SSU rDNA sequence of M. xiantaoensis n. sp., which will facilitate future work designed to evaluate the validity of M. physophilus multi-infection sites of multi-fish host.
