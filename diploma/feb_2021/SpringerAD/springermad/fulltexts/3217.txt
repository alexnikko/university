Sampling Plans
There is a wide body of literature on sampling. Sampling plans are used to provide blend samples or dosage units that will be tested to support release of manufactured batches, process validation, or for process understanding. A sampling plan describes where (locations) and how the samples are taken from the blend or batch and the number of samples (blend amount or dosage units) taken from each location. Blend locations could be a specific location in a blender, bin, or drum. Sampling plans for blends should include the mass or volume collected, as well as the type of sampler that is used. Sampling locations for final dosage units may be based on specific times during the manufacturing run or on the total number of dosage units in the run. If the samples are taken after the dosage units are put into containers, then the location could be similar to blends where a specific location is determined to take the sample. Although there are many possible sampling plans, the most common plans are simple random, stratified, and systematic which are described below.
Simple Random Sampling
Simple random sampling gives each possible dosage unit an approximately equal probability of being chosen as a member of the samples to be tested. A true random sample of a batch of tablets could theoretically be obtained by identifying each dosage unit in the batch and then by a completely random process, pick “n” dosage units. To obtain a true simple random sample is nearly impossible or impractical for sampling a batch of dosage units. The most common approach is to use the “quality control release samples” which are obtained by sampling the batch at frequent intervals (e.g., every 10 min) throughout the run and then combining all of the tablets together and finally sampling from this composite. Although this procedure is not truly random, it is generally a very good approximation and treated as a random sample. As the intervals become shorter, the final sample comes closer to a truly random sample. Another sample that is generally considered close to random is taking a sample from a coating pan for content uniformity since the tablets have been continuously mixed up during the coating process. Although even in this case, one might take samples from different locations from the coating pan to protect against any possible (but unlikely) location effects in the pan.
Stratified Sampling
One problem with simple random sampling is that, just by chance, the samples may not contain dosage units from segments of the batch of interest. For example, in process validation, the beginning and end of the batch may be of interest. So, although a simple random sample is statistically valid, one may not be satisfied with a sampling plan that does not include samples taken from the beginning or end of the batch. Stratified sampling plans partition the batch into “strata” (e.g., first 1/20, second 1/20, …, and final 1/20). The combination of all strata must cover the entire batch. Then random sampling is performed within each stratum.
Systematic Sampling
Systematic sampling is performed by taking a sample(s) at equal intervals throughout the batch typically by total number of dosage units or manufacturing time. The first sample location is determined at random and then the remaining samples are taken at equal intervals. For example, using dosage unit intervals, suppose a batch consists of 1,000,000 dosage units (tablets in this case) and the sampling plan requires sampling 10 tablets with one tablet taken from each of 10 locations. Then the 1,000,000 are partitioned into 10 equal intervals (tablet 1 to 100,000; 100,001 to 200,000; …; and 900,001 to 1,000,000). A random time point is chosen from the first interval, say tablet 60,000, then the sampling plan would be to take the 60,000th; 160,000th; …; and 960,000th tablet. To obtain these exact tablet numbers is not practical, so selecting tablets near these points is acceptable. Additionally, it may be more practical to set the sampling start point rather than use a random start. This is typically acceptable as long as the starting point and subsequent sampling points do not fix the samples in such a way as to potentially miss important elements of the process.
Comparisons
Figure 1 shows the three sampling plans (random, stratified (three strata), and systematic) where a total of 12 dosage units were taken throughout the batch and tested for content uniformity (CU expressed in % label claim (LC)). All three sampling plans are acceptable statistically. Notice that in the random sampling plan, most samples were taken in the first 1/3 of the batch, leaving the remainder of the batch to be more sparsely sampled. In the stratified plan, each stratum has the same amount of sampling; however, the last portion of the third strata was not sampled. With systematic sampling, the different sections of the batch are equally weighted such that any trends at the beginning, middle, or end of the batch are equally represented in the sample. In addition to insuring that the entire batch is examined equally, the systematic plan also allows the locations to be easily identified. This can be very useful for follow-up analysis of the batch, such as examining trends. Fig. 1 Comparison of sampling plans
The three sampling strategies describe how to select locations for sampling. Typically for both simple random and stratified sampling, only one dosage unit is tested from each location. For the purposes of this document, this is called sampling plan 1, meaning that at each location only one dosage unit is tested. For systematic sampling plans, one dosage unit (or blend sample) could be tested from each location which is sampling plan 1 or multiple dosage units (blend samples) could be tested from each location. An equal number of samples, greater than one, taken from each location is called sampling plan 2 in this document. The advantage of sampling plan 2 can be shown as follows. Suppose a sample of 12 dosage units are taken from a batch and tested based on a systematic sampling plan using sampling plan 1. There is bound to be variability in the test results. However, one cannot determine whether the variation is caused by differences between locations in the batch or if the variability would have been the same if all the samples had all been taken from the same location. Figure 2 shows two sets of test results: the top set are test results from a batch where there is location to location variation (Loc) whereas the bottom set is from a batch where there is no location to location variation (No Loc). Note that the two sets of data are exactly the same. There is no way to determine whether the variation is due to between locations or within locations since only one tablet was tested from each location. Fig. 2 Batch data without knowledge of between location variability
Now suppose that sampling plan 2 was used instead of sampling plan 1. Figure 3 shows what the data would look like in the case where there is location variation and when there is no location variation. The rectangular data points are still identical for both the upper and lower plots. However, the second data point (black dot) at each location is added based on whether the variation is due to within location or between locations. Notice that in the upper portion of the plot where there is location to location variation, the results at each location are similar but there is variation between the locations. In the lower portion of the plot where there is no true location to location variability, the within location variability clearly dominates compared to any observed variability between the locations. Fig. 3 Batch data with and without location variability
ASTM E2709/E2810
The USP Uniformity of Dosage Units (UDU) given in General Chapter <905> Uniformity of Dosage Units is a market standard. The USP General Notices include the following statement about compendial standards [ ]. “The similarity to statistical procedures may seem to suggest intent to make inference to some larger group of units, but in all cases, statements about whether the compendial standard is met apply only to the units tested.” Therefore, the UDU procedure is not intended for inspecting uniformity of finished product for lot/batch release or as a lot inspection procedure. Passing the UDU test once does not provide a statistical assurance that a batch of drug product meets specified statistical quality control criteria. Therefore, a procedure was needed that can provide this assurance.
A methodology was developed in the mid 1980s to address both the need to provide this assurance and as a response to FDA statements that validation should show that a process does what it purports to do. The method (originally called CuDAL (content uniformity and dissolution acceptance limits)) was developed by James Bergum [ ] and updated by Bergum and Li [ ] for the ICH UDU harmonized test. A good reference describing the method as well as examples is the process validation chapter in the Encyclopedia of Bio-Pharmaceutical Statistics [ ].
The methodology resulted in the following standards: ASTM E2709 [ ], “Standard Practice for Demonstrating Capability to Comply with an Acceptance Procedure” and ASTM E2810 [ ], “Standard Practice for Demonstrating Capability to Comply with the Test for Uniformity of Dosage Units.” ASTM E2709 provides the statistical aspects of the methodology. ASTM E2810 applies the general methodology of ASTM E2709 specifically to the UDU test as well as 2.9.40 Uniformity of Dosage Units of the Ph. Eur. and 6.02 Uniformity of Dosage Units of the JP. All of these versions are virtually interchangeable. This methodology has general application to multiple stage tests with multiple acceptance criteria.
The approach is to show that specific quality attributes could meet associated testing standards such as the USP Uniformity of Dosage Units (UDU) <905>. The goal is to develop limits based on the process validation sample results that would provide confidence that any samples used in the UDU test would pass the testing standard.
As an example, suppose that a random sample of 30 dosage units were taken from a lot using sampling plan 1 with a confidence level of 90 % and coverage of 95 % where coverage is the probability of passing the UDU test for future samples from the same batch. Table 1 is a subset of the entire acceptance table for this situation. A more complete table of acceptance limits for 90 % confidence for 95 % coverage for various sample sizes is available [ ]. Table 1 Sampling plan 1 acceptance limit table for USP UDU test 90 % confidence interval, 95 % coverage, n = 30 Sample mean (% LC) Sample standard deviation upper limit (% LC) 100.0 4.48 99.0 or 101.0 4.22 98.0 or 102.0 3.95 97.0 or 103.0 3.68
Suppose that the sample mean and standard deviation from the 30 results are 99.0 and 2.46 % label claim, respectively. From Table 1 , the upper limit on the sample standard deviation for a sample mean of 99.0 % is 4.22 %. Therefore, this sample meets the criterion.
Meeting the standard deviation limit assures, with 90 % confidence, that a sample taken for testing against the USP UDU test has at least a 95 % chance of passing the UDU test.
The 90 % confidence with 95 % coverage is an example chosen to illustrate an acceptable approach to demonstrating content uniformity. The chosen criteria for a given sampling plan point to a certain probability of meeting the limits established in the harmonized method for a future test of a sample from the batch. A more conservative or liberal limit can be chosen based on the therapeutic window considerations on a product by product basis. For new drugs, this can be a topic of discussion with the regulatory authority at the time of application.
To construct an acceptance limit, the table requires the following information: sampling plan (sampling plan 1 or 2), sample size, confidence level (e.g., 90 % for validation), and a coverage probability (e.g., 95 %). In this paper, coverage is defined as the desired probability of passing the USP UDU test in future performances of the test for that lot.
Figure 4 provides a pictorial of the method. The methodology computes, at a prescribed confidence level, a lower bound on the probability of passing an acceptance procedure (coverage) using estimates of the parameters of the distribution of test results from a sampled population. The 95 % lower bound showing the acceptable parameter region is shown in Fig. 4 . Any combination of the population lot mean and standard deviation below the lower bound has at least a 95 % probability of passing the USP UDU test. For a prescribed lower probability bound, the methodology can also generate an acceptance limit table, which defines a set of sample statistics (for example, sample averages and standard deviations) that would pass the acceptance procedure at a prescribed confidence level. This is done by generating a confidence region for the lot mean and standard deviation. The confidence region is a triangle which is shown in Fig. 4 . Note that the sample mean and standard deviation used in Fig. 4 result in a confidence interval that contains a point on the acceptable parameter region. For this particular sample mean, the associated standard deviation is the largest sample standard deviation that would not result in going above the acceptable parameter region. This sample mean and standard deviation would be included in the set of sample means and standard deviations making up the acceptance region for n = 10. The acceptance region for samples of size 10 and 100 are given in Fig. 4 . Fig. 4 ASTM E2810: content uniformity acceptable parameter region, confidence interval (region)*, and acceptance region. * Z is a normal critical value and ULS is the upper confidence limit on the standard deviation
As can be seen in Fig. 4 , the acceptance region becomes larger as the sample size increases. Therefore, the probability of passing an acceptance limit table increases as the sample size increases. Operating characteristic (OC) curves are used to decide on a sample size. OC curves show the probability of passing the acceptance limit table for various sample sizes given the true underlying lot mean and standard deviation. Figure 5 shows the OC curves based on 90 % confidence intervals for true (i.e., actual population) lot means of 96, 98, and 100 % LC and sample sizes from 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, and 500 using sampling plan 1. Suppose based on lab data and current knowledge of the product that we do not expect a true lot mean to be below 98 % LC or the true lot standard deviation to be greater than 3 %. The dashed vertical line is for a true lot mean of 98 % with a true lot standard deviation of 3 %. So if we want a good chance of passing the acceptance limit table, a sample size of 30 would be reasonable. As can be seen from Fig. 5b , even with a sample of 30 tablets, a true lot mean of 98 % with a true lot standard deviation of 3 % would easily pass. Fig. 5 a – c OC curves for sampling plan 1 (90 % conf/95 % cov). OC curve = prob (passing acceptance limit table for specific true lot mean and standard deviation)
Sampling plan 2 is a sampling plan where more than one dosage unit is tested from each location and is typically, though not necessarily, systematic. This plan can be used for process validation. Suppose that a lot is sampled using a systematic plan at 20 locations evenly distributed throughout the lot with three dosage units tested at each location. Table 2 shows the data. Figure 6 is a plot of the data which can be useful to look for trends or unusual patterns in the data. Plotting the data is highly recommended. Table 2 Sampling plan 2 (20 × 3) example data Location Dosage unit 1 2 3 1 98.1 96.9 97.4 2 99.1 103.3 102.0 3 99.1 98.2 99.3 4 101.4 99.0 105.3 5 102.1 104.6 104.3 6 103.1 102.6 102.9 7 100.5 98.3 98.2 8 97.6 96.9 97.8 9 103.5 102.5 100.6 10 99.2 99.3 100.8 11 97.0 97.9 102.2 12 100.4 102.9 100.0 13 101.3 101.1 104.2 14 95.7 98.5 97.0 15 95.3 103.7 94.5 16 100.3 96.3 98.5 17 102.2 94.7 102.4 18 101.2 98.6 97.7 19 99.7 94.5 98.0 20 96.8 92.8 94.2 Fig. 6 Sampling plan 2—data display
A variance component analysis should be used as part of the data review. Variance components split the overall variability into between and within location components.
In the example, the variance components are given in Table 3 . The between location variability is significant ( P value = 0.001) and represents 42.6 % of the total variation. The total standard deviation is 2.97 % LC. A company would have to decide if a total standard deviation of 2.97 % with about half of the variation due to locations is worth the resources to investigate the between location variability. Note that the within standard deviation is 2.25 %, so reducing or eliminating the location to location variability may only result in reducing the total standard deviation to about 2.25 %. It is important to note that the tests and acceptance criteria proposed assume that all dosage units in a given batch have an equal probability of reaching a given consumer. One way to look at this is that all dosage units are blended together such than any location differences are minimized, prior to final packaging. If a single location could remain intact through to final packaging, (e.g., a consumer receives all dosage units from location 20 only), then the sampling, testing, and acceptance criteria should be assessed at the specified worst case location and additional samples may be required for this assessment. Table 3 Between and within location variance components variance components Component Variance component % of total Plot % Standard deviation Location 3.753 42.6 1.937 Within 5.056 57.4 2.249 Total 8.809 100.0 2.968 Overall mean, 99.56
The statistics required to use the acceptance limit table for sampling plan 2 are the overall mean, the within-location standard deviation (i.e., the square root of the average of the 20 location variances which is the same as the within location standard deviation from the variance component analysis), and the standard deviation of the 20 location means (Note that this is not the square root of the between location variance component). Table 4 shows the overall mean, the within location standard deviation (SE), and the between location standard deviation. Table 4 Example: sampling plan 2 Descriptive statistics (% label claim) Overall mean 99.56 SE (within-location standard deviation) 2.25 Standard deviation of location means 2.33
Table 5 is a subset of the entire acceptance table that is available [ ] for sampling plan 2 that contains limits for the overall mean instead of the sample standard deviation used in sampling plan 1. Acceptance criteria tables have been posted for the ASTM E2709/E2810 approach ( http://www.ispe.org/samplingtables ) including for the complete 20 × 3 table. Table 5 90 % conf/95 % prob(pass USP) Standard deviation of location means 2.2 2.3 2.4 SE LL UL LL UL LL UL 2.2 93.8 106.2 94.1 105.9 94.5 105.5 2.3 93.9 106.1 94.2 105.8 94.6 105.4 2.4 94.0 106.0 94.4 105.6 94.7 105.3
Note that 95 % coverage means future samples from the batch have at least a 95 % probability of passing the USP UDU test.) The first column is the within-in location standard deviation (SE), and the first row is the standard deviation of the location means. To use the acceptance limit table, the SE and standard deviation of location means are rounded up to the nearest tenth from 2.25 to 2.3 and 2.33 to 2.4, respectively, to be conservative. The limits on the overall mean are 94.6 to 105.4 % LC. Since the overall mean is 99.56 % LC, the sample passes the limits.
Example of Sampling Plans for Process Qualification Using ASTM E2709/E2810 Acceptance Criteria
A possible sampling plan for process qualification (stage 2 validation) can be to sample at least three dosage units from each of at least 40 locations. The 40 sampling locations are split in this document to have 20 locations (typically including beginning and end samples) that are initially tested and then the remaining 20 locations tested if needed (values should not be weight corrected). Three dosage units are to be tested from each of the initial 20 location (called 20 × 3 in this document). If the criteria for the 20 × 3 plan are not met, test the remaining 20 locations with 3 tablets per location and perform VCA. In total, there are 40 locations with three dosage units per location tested (called 40 × 3 in this document) for a total of 120 test results. The test results are then compared to the criteria for the 40 × 3 plan. Both the 20 × 3 and 40 × 3 are sampling plan 2 type plans. All individual values should be between 75.0 and 125.0 % (non-weight corrected). Acceptance criteria tables for both the 20 × 3 and 40 × 3 plan are posted at http://www.ispe.org/samplingtables8 . To show uniformity of blend the same analysis can be performed on the weight corrected results. If the results comply with the acceptance criteria, dosage unit uniformity is demonstrated. If not, the dosage units are not uniform.
The performance characteristics of the 20 × 3 and 40 × 3 plans can be evaluated using OC curves. All of the following OC curves are based on 90 % confidence level and 95 % coverage (i.e., 95 % prob(pass USP UDU)). The curves depend on the true total lot standard deviation and the true percent of the total lot standard deviation due to between locations. Figure 7 shows the OC curves for the 20 × 3 plan with a true lot mean of 100 % label claim and true between location percentages of 0, 30, 50, 70, and 90 % of the total variance. Note that as the percent of between location variability increases, the probability of passing the acceptance limit table decreases. This can be explained as follows. If there were no location to location variation, then the curves are similar to a table with 60 results using sampling plan 1 but if all of the variation is due to between locations, the curves are similar to a table with only 20 results using sampling plan 1 since there are only 20 locations. Fig. 7 OC curves 90 % conf/95 % prob(pass USP), 20 × 3 plan, and true lot mean = 100 %
Figures 8 and 9 show for true lot means of 100 and 96 % label claim and a confidence level of 90 %, the 20 × 3 and 40 × 3 plans with true percent (of total) location to location standard deviations of 0, 50, and 90 % as well as the OC curve for the USP as a reference (CICOVPlan in the legend denotes the confidence level, coverage, and sampling plan). Notice how the OC curves shift left as the proportion of variance attributed to location increases requiring smaller standard deviations to pass the acceptance criteria. Also, notice how the strategy of performing a 20 × 3 test requires a smaller standard deviation to pass than a 40 × 3 plan for nearly all proportions of variability attributed to location (there is a small overlap for the 20 × 3 plan with 0 % location variability and the 40 × 3 plan with 90 % location variability). This means that when the second set of samples is needed, resulting in the 40 × 3 plan, the standard deviation that passes the acceptance criteria increases compared to the initial 20 × 3 plan while maintaining the same confidence/coverage. This is supported due to the better variability estimates obtained with the larger sample size. Additionally, this strategy is an efficient use of resources since the additional samples increase the acceptance region.

Example of Sampling Plan for Continued Process Verification/Routine Lot Release Using ASTM E2709/E2810 Acceptance Criteria
It is necessary during both process qualification (stage 2 validation) and continued process verification/routine testing (stage 3 validation) to assure uniformity of the dosage units for solid oral dosage forms. In process qualification, the purpose is to demonstrate that the process is capable of consistently producing lots that meet this requirement. During continued process verification/routine lot release, the focus is to provide assurance that the specific lot being released will meet the UDU criteria on any future representative sample from that lot. ASTM E2810 can be used to support both of these objectives.
Since the goal of process qualification is to assure process capability for ongoing production, conservative criteria are typically established to assure the process will meet specification requirements. Since the ASTM E2810 provides assurance of passing the USP UDU test, the probability of passing the acceptance limit table must be less than the probability of passing the USP UDU test. Therefore, the operating characteristic curve will always be below and to the left of the USP UDU curve. As the confidence level or coverage increases or the sample size decreases, the OC curve will move further to the left since increasing the confidence level and/or coverage provides a greater assurance of passing the USP UDU test. In the remainder of this paper, curves that fall further to the left of the USP UDU test will be considered more conservative. So the level of conservativeness is determined through the choices of confidence and coverage. For process qualification, a high level of confidence and coverage are recommended. For solid oral dosage forms that have typical patient safety and efficacy profiles, one may use 90 % confidence/95 % coverage as previously discussed [ ]. For products with narrow therapeutic windows, it may be desirable to tighten one or both of these levels. For products with a wide therapeutic window and safety profile, lower levels may be justified.
After process qualification has successfully been demonstrated, continued process monitoring/routine batch release needs to continue demonstration of each lot’s ability to meet requirements and to continue demonstrating that the process is in a state of control and is capable. Toward that end, lot release criteria should be set that are conservative with respect to the USP criteria but not more restrictive than process qualification criteria. One choice of criteria that could be considered acceptable is using 50 % confidence/95 % coverage. Additional rationale for this choice is discussed later in this paper.
Tiered Approaches
The two-staged tiered approach discussed below keeps the sample sizes as in the USP UDU test where at the first tier (stage 1), 10 dosage units are tested and compared to the ASTM E2810 acceptance limit table criteria for n = 10. If the criterion is met, the lot passes the uniformity requirement. If the criterion is not met, then the second tier (stage 2) is conducted by testing another 20 dosage units. The entire 30 dosage unit test results are compared to the acceptance limit table criteria for n = 30. If the criteria are met, the lot passes the uniformity requirement. Otherwise, the lot fails the uniformity requirement. This two-stage approach of testing n = 10 and then n = 20 additional dosage units if needed is referred to as a tiered 10:30 plan.
OC curves for both the n = 30 untiered and 10:30 tiered plans are shown in Figs. 10 and 11 for true lot means of 100 and 96 % label claim. Also included is the USP UDU OC curve. Note that the OC curves for the untiered and tiered plans are very similar. Fig. 10 Comparison of tiered and untiered plans, true mean = 100 % Fig. 11 Comparison of tiered and untiered plans, true mean = 96 %
Acceptance criteria tables have also been posted for the ASTM E2709/E2810 approach ( http://www.ispe.org/samplingtables ) for 50 % confidence/95 % probability of passing USP UDU for 10 × 1 and 30 × 1 sampling plan 1 as well as 90 % confidence/95 % probability of passing USP UDU for n × 1 sampling plan 1 for various n from 10 to 500.
Relationships Between the Sampling Plans Used During Process Qualification and Continued Process Verification/Routine Lot Release and Rationale for Acceptability of the 50 % Conf/95 % Prob(Pass USP) Plan
During process qualification, the testing and acceptance criteria are the most rigorous to assure capability of the process. During continued process verification/routine lot release, the criteria are comparatively relaxed versus process qualification, but still maintained at a conservative level with respect to USP criteria. Figures 12 through 13 depict two types of OC curves to understand the relationships of the performances of the example plans with each other and with respect to the USP UDU test. Fig. 12 OC Curves for Tiered Plan, Sampling Plans 20 × 3 and 40 × 3 (Varying % total variation due to between location), and USP UDU versus True Lot Standard Deviation (True Lot Mean = 100 %)
Consider Fig. 12 . Leftmost is the 20 × 3 sampling plan which is the most conservative requiring the smallest standard deviations to pass acceptance criteria. Next is the 40 × 3 plan which provides some loosening of the standard deviation. Both of these are used in process qualification and represent very conservative criteria relative to the USP. It is observed that for the loosest OC curve of these plans (solid red line), when SD ≈ 5.6 %, there is only an approximate 5 % chance of passing this criteria. However, at that same standard deviation, there is approximately a 98 % chance of passing the USP.
Another way to compare the criteria is through OC curves based on the probability of passing the USP UDU criteria given the proportion of individual UDU results that are between 85 and 115 % (normality assumed). Figure 13 provides this comparison. In this figure, it is intuitively obvious that the performance of the 10:30, 50 %/95 % OC curve is much more conservative than the USP UDU curve. For example, consider when 99 % of the individual content uniformity test results are between 85 and 115 %. When this is true, the lot will fail the 10:30, 50 %/95 % criterion 68 % of the time whereas the lot will pass the USP UDU test 98 % of the time. Fig. 13 OC curves for Tiered Plan, Sampling Plans 20 × 3 and 40 × 3 (Varying % total variation due to between location), and USP UDU Proportion of Individuals Between 85-115 % LC (True Lot Mean = 100%)
Figures 14 and 15 depict the same relative relationships between the sampling plans and criteria when the true mean is 96 %. Fig. 14 OC curves for Tiered Plan, Sampling Plans 20 × 3 and 20 × 3 (Varying % of total variation due to between location), and USP UDU versus True Lot Standard Deviation (True Lot Mean = 96 %) Fig. 15 OC Curves for Tiered Plan, Sampling Plans 20 × 3 and 40 × 3 (Varying % total variation due to between location), and USP UDU versus Proportion of Individual Results Between 85-115 % LC (True Lot Mean = 96 %)
Now, consider what performance characteristics of a sampling plan and acceptance criteria would be desirable during continued process verification. 1. The amount of testing should be reduced to a reasonable level. 2. The acceptance criterion needs to be consistent with performance qualification criteria. Specifically, given a standard deviation of the process that passes performance qualification criteria, standard deviation should also pass continued process verification criteria. Otherwise, a process could pass performance qualification and fail continued process verification given identical lot quality/variability. 3. The acceptance criteria should be conservative with respect to the USP UDU.
The tiered 10:30, 50 % conf/95 % prob(pass USP) criteria demonstrate all these properties. 1. It matches the amount of testing to that of the USP, i.e., 10 or 30 dosage units. 2. Its operating characteristics have only a small amount of overlap with the 40 × 3 plan. In that region, there is some risk of lots failing the criteria during continued verification/routine lot release that would have passed the criteria during process qualification. However, that region is small (4.0 % ≤ SD ≤ 4.9 %). Additionally, the differences in the probabilities of passing lots in this range of standard deviations is relatively small (<9 %). This makes the risk of lots failing the criteria during continued verification that would have passed during performance qualification small. 3. It has a high probability of lots failing the acceptance criteria that would still pass the USP UDU criteria a high percentage of the time. Consider when SD = 6.4 %. There is a 90 % chance the lot will pass the USP criteria . However, the same lot will have an 86 % chance of failing the criterion for the 10:30, 50 %/95 % plan (a sample with a standard deviation of 6.4 % may raise concerns about the content uniformity and may require additional assessment). Additionally, when there is still as high as a 65 % chance of passing the USP criterion at SD = 7.25 %, the lot would pass the 10:30, 50 %/95 % plan criterion only 5 % of the time. Therefore, the 10:30, 50 %/95 % plan is much more conservative than the USP UDU criteria.
Additional Discussion on 50 % Conf/95 % Cov (Prob(Pass USP UDU))
The endpoint of a one-sided 50 % confidence interval is the best estimate of the parameter being estimated. For example, if a sample of size n is taken, the average of these n results is the endpoint of a one-sided 50 % confidence estimate of the true mean for the lot. This average is the best estimate of the true mean of the lot. The 50 % confidence level does not mean there is a 50 % chance of failing the criterion but rather that the estimate has a 50 % chance of falling either above or below the 95 % coverage point. As the sample size increases, the 50 % tolerance interval result will become closer to the population 95 % coverage point.
Consumer and Producer Risks and Operational Characteristic Curves
The 90 % confidence/95 % coverage validation plans used in the prior example result in very conservative OC curves as shown in many of the prior figures. These are conservative in the sense that the consumer risk of receiving low quality product is extremely low while the producer has a high risk of failing the acceptance criteria for a batch of high quality. Therefore, depending on the therapeutic properties of the drug product and/or known challenges with the particular formulation, less conservative criteria may be justified. For example, continuing with the use of ASTM criteria, it may be appropriate to reduce the confidence and/or coverage levels to achieve an OC curve (or curves) consistent with the therapeutic properties. Figure 16 shows OC curves for the previously mentioned 20 × 3 and 40 × 3 sample plans where the confidence/coverage are 50 %/95 % and the between location variability proportion is 0 or 90 %. The 50 %/95 % tiered 10:30 and the USP OC curves are also shown. For products with a relatively broad therapeutic index, a 50 %/95 % plan can provide an acceptable balance of producer and consumer risks. Fig. 16 OC curves for sampling plans 20 × 3, 40 × 3, and tiered 10:30 at 50 % conf/95 % prob(pass USP), true lot mean = 100 %, and USP UDU versus true lot standard deviation
From Fig. 16 , it is observed that the qualification plans have moved to the right compared to the curves of Fig. 12 while still providing high levels of protection against consumer risk. Specifically, when the True Batch Std Dev is approximately 6.2 %, there is approximately a 95 % probability of any given sample from the batch passing the USP UDU test. This indicates that a True Batch Std Dev of 6.2 % should, in general, be considered of good quality from a consumer risk perspective. However, at this level of variability, there is approximately an 89 % chance that the batch would fail the acceptance criteria for any of the qualification sampling plans. Therefore, these plans are still conservative, though not as stringent as the 90 %/95 % plans.
Also in Fig. 16 , the 50 %/95 % tiered 10:30 plan may still be appropriate for routine release (stage 3 continuous process verification) if the stage 2 process qualification batches each passed using the 20 × 3 plans. However, if one or more batches required use of the 40 × 3 plan, there is sufficient overlap in the curves that either a lower confidence/coverage level may be needed or a higher number of samples taken to prevent continued process verification/routine release batches from failing criteria when they are of the same quality as batches that passed qualification.
Conclusions
This paper has provided a discussion and rationale regarding the use of various types of sampling plans with the recommendation to use systematic sampling. It has also provided an example and discussion for the use of the ASTM E2709/E2810 methodology including the use of sample plan 1- and sample plan 2-type plans. 1 Further, OC curves of the example plans for process qualification and continued process verification/routine lot release were presented and compared along with the USP UDU OC curve. It was shown that the process qualification criteria/sampling plans are very conservative compared to the USP UDU test and that lower confidence/coverage levels (e.g., 50 %/95 %) may be appropriate while still demonstrating assurance of meeting USP UDU. Additionally, it was shown that the 10:30, 50 %/95 % criteria/sampling plan met desirable characteristics for a plan that would be used during continued process monitoring/routine release and that this plan is much more conservative than the USP UDU test.
There may be other plans and criteria that are acceptable to demonstrate content uniformity.
