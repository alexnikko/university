Introduction
Normal breathing is associated with the quasiperiodic deformation of the diaphragm which can result in over 20-mm wide movement of the heart. Due to the long duration of cardiac emission tomography examinations, respiratory motion (RM) is almost inevitable, and the related artifacts may compromise the accuracy of the diagnosis. This problem can be minimized by acquiring information on the location of the heart as a function of time with either data-driven methods or motion tracking devices. Based on this information, the emission data can be sorted into respiratory windows to generate motion-constrained images, known as respiratory gating.
However, this issue is more complicated in conventional myocardial perfusion (MP) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging due to the step-and-shoot image acquisition protocol. Since the breathing pattern varies, the time spent within the respiratory window is seldom uniformly distributed between projection angles, which may cause limited-angle errors in the reconstructed tomographic images. Promising RM compensation methods, which also consider these limited-angle errors, have been proposed in previous studies; , , however, these studies focused only on non-cardiac-gated images.
Cardiac gating of the MP-SPECT examination allows the quantification of several left ventricular (LV) functional variables which are useful in the assessment of cardiac diseases. – As far as we are aware, only a few studies have investigated the effects of RM compensation on LV functional parameters using clinical data. , In addition, the effects of RM compensation on phase analysis variables have not been investigated.
In this paper, we present a novel, straightforward dual gating algorithm to reduce RM in MP-SPECT images while avoiding the limited-angle errors. We have utilized this method to evaluate the effect of RM reduction on image quality and LV functional parameters, including phase analysis variables.
Materials and Methods
Study Population
Our study population (Table 1 ) consisted of 18 patients who underwent a 1-day stress/rest MP-SPECT examination. According to their referral notes and medical certificates, 15 patients had been diagnosed with coronary artery disease, 6 with myocardial infarction, and 4 with heart failure. Hypoperfused LV regions were detected in thirteen patients. In addition, four patients displayed evidence of several ectopic beats in their electrocardiogram (ECG) during the rest phase of the MP-SPECT examination. We obtained a written informed consent from the patients and an approval from the Research Ethics Committee of the Northern Savo Hospital District (Dno 90/2011; 20 March 2012). Table 1 Descriptive statistics of the study population Mean ± SD Range Age (years) 69 ± 11 44–83 Weight (kg) 75 ± 12 49–98 Height (cm) 168 ± 11 151–189 BMI (kg·m −2 ) 26 ± 3 20.7–31.3 Activity (MBq) 707 ± 10 684–728 The study population consisted of 8 females and 10 males SD , standard deviation, BMI , body mass index
Data Acquisition and Preprocessing
Due to the clinical workflow, we collected data only during the rest phase of the MP-SPECT examination. Three hours after the stress examination [300 MBq (8.1 mCi) of Tc-99m tetrofosmin], the patients were injected with an additional activity of 700 MBq (18.9 mCi). They were imaged at rest with the dual-detector Precedence SPECT/CT system (Royal Philips N.V., Amsterdam, Netherlands) at 45-minute post-injection. Image acquisition was conducted with the patient in a supine position, using 90° detector configuration, low-energy high-resolution collimators, 64 projection angles from right anterior oblique to left posterior oblique, and a noncircular orbit. Photons inside a 20% wide energy window centered on 140 keV were included in the list-mode emission data. ECG was measured with cardiac trigger monitor (CTM) 3000 unit (Ivy Biomedical Systems, Inc., Branford, CT, USA). R-R intervals within a 40% wide acceptance window were acquired for a total image acquisition time of 30 seconds per projection angle.
During the image acquisition, ECG and thoracic electrical bioimpedance (EBI) signals were recorded with a 1 kHz sampling frequency using an MP150 data acquisition system with ECG100C and EBI100C amplifiers (BIOPAC Systems, Inc., Goleta, CA, USA). In the applied tetrapolar configuration, two BlueSensor R ECG electrodes (Ambu, Ballerup, Denmark) were positioned horizontally below the right collarbone, and two were positioned vertically on the left midaxillary line between the horizontal levels of the costal margin and xiphoid process. Electrical current was injected using a 100 kHz frequency and 400 µA amplitude. In the voltage measurements, hardware-based filters were utilized for the EBI signal (100 Hz low-pass) and ECG signal (0.05 Hz high-pass and 35 Hz low-pass). Cross-correlation-based synchronization of the recorded signals with list-mode data was retrospectively carried out by feeding R-trigger pulses from CTM into an in-house built pulse generator which transferred the pulses simultaneously to both the SPECT/CT (computed tomography) and MP150 systems.
The recorded data were retrospectively processed with custom-made scripts in a MATLAB R2013b environment (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA) to bin the emission data into projection images. We detected R waves from the ECG signal and located R-R intervals within the acceptance window. We computed cardiac frame limits assuming forward gating mode and 16 temporal bins. EBI signal was processed with a fifth-order Butterworth low-pass zero-phase filter with a 0.6 Hz cutoff frequency to eliminate cardiogenic components. Non-physiological trends were removed from the low-pass-filtered EBI signal with a zero-phase moving average filter of 60 seconds wide window to generate a respiratory signal for gating.
Dual Gating
We present a novel straightforward dual gating (respiratory and cardiac gating) algorithm. Its principle is to reduce RM in projection images while ensuring equal acquisition times at each projection angle for each cardiac frame, thereby preventing limited-angle errors. Our algorithm is implemented in a projection angle-wise manner (Figure 1 ) for each cardiac frame c separately ( c = 1, 2,…,16) as follows: Figure 1 Dual gating algorithm applied on the patient data. Emission data acquired near end-expiration are included in the dual-gated images (displayed with teal lines ) while ensuring equal photon statistics for each cardiac frame ( A ). Emission data acquired during rejected R-R intervals (e.g., immediately before the 965 seconds mark) are not considered for inclusion ( B ). The shaded rectangular areas represent intervals during which the camera rotates to a new projection angle ( A - B ) (1) Locate time intervals τ k ( k = 1, 2,…, K ), during which the phase of cardiac contraction corresponds to cardiac frame c . K is the number of accepted R-R intervals per projection angle. (2) For all values of k , compute \( \bar{Z}_{k} , \) the average value of respiratory signal during τ k → dataset \( (\bar{Z}_{k} ,\;\uptau_{k} )_{k = 1}^{K} . \) (3) Sort \( \bar{Z}_{k} \) values in ascending order → sorted dataset \( (\bar{Z}_{k}^{\text{sort}} ,\;\uptau_{k}^{\text{sort}} )_{k = 1}^{K}. \) (4) Bin emission photons detected during time intervals \( \uptau_{k}^{\text{sort}} \) ( k = 1, 2,…,0.5 × K ) → dual-gated projection image corresponding to cardiac frame c .
In other words, we gradually include emission data in projection images from as close to end-expiration as possible until half (0.5 × K ) of the data has been included. This approach is based on two reported observations. First, for the majority of patients, the end-expiratory state has the longest duration under normal breathing conditions; therefore, images generated from end-expiratory data are likely to be less blurred by motion than end-inspiratory images of the same duration. Second, acquisition times shorter than 15 seconds per projection angle yield images that are too noisy to allow reliable quantification of LV function; therefore, inclusion of half of the data is likely to result in images with lower, but adequate, noise levels and less motion blur than non-respiratory-gated images. We noted that respiratory gating methods that have an adequate signal-to-noise ratio as the primary objective and motion reduction as the secondary aim have earlier been proposed for use in positron emission tomography. , Hence, our algorithm can be considered as a SPECT dual gating modification of these methods.
Images for Analysis
To estimate the effect of RM reduction, we generated a set of cardiac-gated images from the same list-mode data as the dual-gated images. To ensure that we had a similar number of photons in dual-gated and cardiac-gated images, we included only the first 50% of the R-R intervals accepted in cardiac-gated projection images. Since R-R intervals are traditionally divided into either 8 or 16 bins in cardiac gating, we rebinned the 16-frame projection images into 8-frame projection images by summing consecutive cardiac frames. The 16-frame and 8-frame images were generated using a matrix size of 64 × 64.
Since MP is clinically evaluated from non-cardiac-gated data, we summed the cardiac frames in dual-gated and cardiac-gated datasets in order to create 1-frame datasets. These data were binned into 1-frame projection images using a matrix size of 128 × 128. Therefore, we created a total of six sets of projection images: 16-frame, 8-frame, and 1-frame cardiac-gated; and 16-frame, 8-frame, and 1-frame dual-gated projection images (Table 2 ). Table 2 Image reconstruction parameters Gating modes Matrix sizes Pixel sizes (mm) Number of iterations Number of subsets Postfilter FWHM (cm) Cardiac (8- and 16-frame) 64 × 64 9.328 5 16 1.60 Dual (8- and 16-frame) 64 × 64 9.328 5 16 1.60 Cardiac (1-frame) 128 × 128 4.664 5 16 1.10 Dual (1-frame) 128 × 128 4.664 5 16 1.10 Motion-estimation 64 × 64 9.328 15* 1 1.60 Motion-estimation images were neither reoriented nor masked FWHM , full width at half maximum * Value was chosen based on guidelines
Reconstructions were performed with Hybrid Recon: Cardiology program v1.1B (HERMES Medical Solutions, Stockholm, Sweden). We used ordered subsets expectation maximization (OSEM) algorithm with resolution recovery and post-reconstruction Gaussian filtering (Table 2 ). Transaxial images were reoriented to short axis images and masked to eliminate any extracardiac activity.
Estimation of Respiratory Motion Amplitude
A set of motion-estimation images was created according to the work of Dey et al. In short, we generated respiratory-gated projection images (matrix size 64 × 64) using nine amplitude windows and normalized them according to the durations of the amplitude windows. After reconstruction with the OSEM algorithm (Table 2 ), we defined a region of interest (ROI) containing LV myocardium in the end-expiratory motion-estimation image. We set the activity outside the ROI to zero and registered end-inspiratory motion-estimation image with the end-expiratory image by assuming that the motion occurs as three-dimensional rigid-body translation and minimizing the sum of squared differences between the end-expiratory image and the transformed end-inspiratory image. By solving this minimization problem with a Gauss-Newton method, we obtained three translation ( T CC , T LR , T PA ) parameters with respect to the cranio-caudal (CC), left-right (LR) and posterior-anterior (PA) directions. Finally, we defined RM amplitude as total translation ( T TOT ), computed as Euclidean norm of translation parameters : $$ T_{\text{TOT}} = \left( {T_{\text{CC}}^{2} + T_{\text{LR}}^{2} + T_{\text{PA}}^{2} } \right)^{1/2}. $$ (1)
Assessment of Image Quality
To assess clinical relevance of RM reduction, three specialists [one experienced physician of nuclear medicine (J.N.Q.) and two cardiologists experienced in nuclear medicine (M.K.H. and S.T.J.K.)] evaluated image quality using Quantitative Perfusion SPECT (QPS) 2012 program (Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA). The specialists analyzed two images at the same time—a 1-frame cardiac-gated and a 1-frame dual-gated image—and gave each a score on a scale of 1-5 for general image quality. In addition, the specialists had an option to write a comment concerning the image pair. The specialists were blinded to the medical records of the patients, and they were unaware which of the two pictures was the dual-gated image. However, the specialists knew that the images had not been corrected for attenuation or scattering. Agreement between the specialists was assessed with Fleiss’ κ, which was calculated for both the absolute scores given (κ ABS ) and signs (−1, 0 or 1) of the score differences (κ DIFF ) between 1-frame dual-gated and cardiac-gated images.
Automatic Assessment of Left Ventricular Parameters
The 8-frame and 16-frame dual-gated and cardiac-gated images were analyzed with Quantitative Gated SPECT 2012 program (Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA). Two patients displayed substantial extracardiac activity located contiguously to myocardium, and they were excluded from the analysis due to the unsuccessful automatic segmentation of the left ventricle. The parameters of interest included end-diastolic volume (EDV), end-systolic volume (ESV), stroke volume (SV), ejection fraction (EF), end-diastolic (SI ED ), and end-systolic shape index (SI ES ). Wall motion (WM) and wall thickening (WT) were evaluated with a five-segment polar map, and global WM (WM GLB ) and global WT (WT GLB ) were estimated as averages over these five segments. , , Phase analysis parameters bandwidth (BW), standard deviation (StDev), and entropy (ENT) were assessed using 360 histogram bins.
The 1-frame cardiac-gated and dual-gated images were analyzed with the QPS 2012 program. We evaluated regional MP with a five-segment polar map. In addition, we measured LV volume ( V 1 ) and shape index (SI 1 ) of 1-frame cardiac-gated and dual-gated images.
Statistical Tests
Statistical significance was evaluated with SPSS Statistics 22 software (International Business Machines Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). The normality of the data was checked with the Shapiro-Wilk test. Since all the data were not normally distributed ( P < .05) and the sample sizes were small, non-parametric Wilcoxon signed rank test was used for the comparisons. Effect sizes ( q ) for assessed parameters were computed as $$ q = Z/(2 \times {\text{N}})^{1/2}, $$ (2) where Z is the z -score obtained from Wilcoxon signed rank test and N is the number of patients.
Results
The main component in myocardial RM was T CC , with T LR and T PA providing additional contributions (Table 3 ). T TOT had moderate Pearson correlations with relative changes of V 1 ( r = .698, P = .003) and SI 1 ( r = −.536, P = .033) caused by RM reduction (Figure 2 ). We detected statistically significant differences ( P < .05) in V 1 and SI 1 between 1-frame cardiac-gated and dual-gated images, but the differences in regional MP were statistically non-significant (Table 4 ).

Differences in image quality between the 1-frame cardiac-gated and dual-gated images were statistically non-significant based on the specialists’ grading (3.89 ± 0.56 vs 4.02 ± 0.45, P = .493, q = −0.162). The specialists had highly differing opinions on image quality scores (κ ABS = 0.043). The opinions were more unanimous on whether RM reduction improved, deteriorated, or did not affect the image quality (κ DIFF = 0.324), with perfect consensus reached in 7 out of 18 cases (4 cases shown in Figure 3 ). Figure 3 Effect of respiratory motion reduction on image quality. For each patient shown, the 1-frame short axis ( SA ), horizontal long axis ( HLA ) and vertical long axis ( VLA ) cardiac-gated images are shown in the left-hand column and the corresponding 1-frame dual-gated images in the right-hand column . All specialists gave higher ( patient A ), equal ( patient B ), or lower ( patients C - D ) scores to the dual-gated images from these cases. Measured total translations for patients A - D were 14.6, 6.6, 11.3, and 12.8 mm, respectively
The results from the LV functional analysis are shown in Table 5 . We observed statistically significant differences ( P < .05) in ESV, SI ED , and septal and WT GLB between cardiac-gated and dual-gated images. No statistically significant differences were detected in WM or phase analysis parameters ( P > .05).

Discussion
We have devised a novel dual gating algorithm for use in MP-SPECT examinations. This algorithm is straightforward to implement, it prevents limited-angle errors in dual-gated images, and it reduces RM artifacts. One obvious disadvantage of this method is increased noise in the images, and therefore it is advisable to increase image acquisition time in the dual-gated examinations. In addition, our algorithm is based on the assumption that the patient breathes in a rather “normal” manner (i.e., the majority of the respiratory signal values are near to the value obtained at end-expiration). A severe violation of this assumption would likely diminish the RM reduction effect.
We measured RM amplitude in our study population (Table 3 ) and found the results to be comparable with values in the literature. , We then utilized the proposed dual gating method to investigate the effect of RM reduction when applied with MP-SPECT. The observed increase of V 1 (Figure 2 a; Table 4 ) due to RM reduction is in line with the results of the previous studies. , , The fact that the increase of volumes was statistically non-significant (Table 5 ) in terms of 16-frame EDV, 16-frame ESV, and 8-frame EDV may be due to the larger voxel size and the increase of noise compared to the 1-frame images.
Interestingly, we observed a decrease of SI 1 (Figure 2 b; Table 4 ) and SI ED (Table 5 ) due to RM reduction. We are not aware of any publication where this finding would have been previously reported. SI is defined as the ratio of the longest endocardium-limited LV dimensions in the direction perpendicular to the long axis of the left ventricle and in the direction parallel to this axis, with a higher SI value implying a more spherical LV form. The decrease in the SI as a result of RM reduction appears logical because RM occurred mostly in the CC direction (Table 3 ), and therefore the “spilling” of myocardial emission photons to the background would yield an image of a ventricle elongated in the CC direction—increasing SI values. In addition, the inferior myocardial wall has been shown to be displaced more due to respiration than the anterior wall during tidal breathing, which may further magnify the elongation effect.
In contrast, RM reduction had only a small and statistically non-significant effect on regional MP values (Table 4 ). The “spilling” of myocardial emission photons in the CC direction due to RM has been shown to reduce MP values in the anterior and inferior walls. , Ko et al reported decreased MP values in inferolateral and anteroseptal segments as a result of RM compensation. Our results, while lacking sufficient statistical power, support these findings (Table 4 ). We also note that the measured RM amplitudes in our study population were considerably smaller than in these previous studies, , which contributes to the small effect size. ,
The results of the image quality analysis were not totally unexpected. In the current clinical workflow, no RM reduction is performed in MP-SPECT so the physicians have become used to blurred or smooth appearance of the images. Therefore, images displaying a higher number of defects or more severe defects may have been considered as erroneous and scored lower. In the case of patient A (Figure 3 ), dual gating made perfusion more uniform by increasing the apparent uptake into the anterior and inferior walls. In contrast, in the cases of patients C and D, dual gating revealed new hypoperfused regions in both patients. The physicians’ comments “too severe perfusion defects” and lower scores given for dual-gated images represent a preference for the more uniform images. In the case of patient B, T TOT was only 6.6 mm, and the difference between dual-gated and cardiac-gated images was visually small.
We found that RM reduction exerted an effect on WT parameters (Table 5 ). Dual gating produced smaller WT values compared to cardiac gating in the septal wall region where statistically significant differences were found in both 8-frame and 16-frame parameters. The difference was statistically significant also in the 8-frame global metric, indicating that RM induces a false increase in the WT values. This result matches findings of the simulation study conducted by Bitarafan-Rajabi et al. However, to the best of our knowledge, no previous study has reported this finding with clinical data. In contrast to our results, Buechel et al found that RM reduction with breath-hold had an effect on WM but not on WT. However, as they pointed out, breath-hold at inspiration per se may induce some physiological changes compared to normal breathing, and thus the observed differences may not have been entirely due to RM.
The RM reduction with dual gating had a statistically non-significant effect on WM and phase analysis parameters (Table 5 ). In the case of WM, RM amplitudes in this study population may be too small to reveal significant changes. Phase analysis results have previously been shown to depend significantly on the number of acquired emission photons, but we are not aware of a study where the effect of RM on phase analysis has been examined. Since no significant differences exist between cardiac-gated and dual-gated images and the effect sizes are small (Table 5 ), we conclude that phase analysis parameters are robust to RM in this study population.
Limitations of the Study
It could be considered as a limitation that we did not perform CT-based attenuation or scatter correction of the images. However, we had no approval to perform gated CT acquisitions on the patients. Thus, our choice ensured that no additional errors were introduced into images due to potential misregistration of emission and attenuation maps, and thus the differences between cardiac- and dual-gated images are mainly due to RM.
New Knowledge Gained
RM reduction decreases the LV SI and WT values. In contrast, phase analysis parameters are not significantly affected by RM.
Conclusions
We have devised a novel dual gating algorithm which can reduce RM in MP-SPECT images. The RM reduction has an effect on LV volumes, shape, and WT but has no effect on phase analysis variables.
