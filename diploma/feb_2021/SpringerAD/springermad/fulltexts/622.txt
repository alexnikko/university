Introduction
Myotonic dystrophy (dystrophia myotonica) type 1 (DM1) and type 2 (DM2) are progressive multisystem autosomal dominant neuromuscular disorders due to unstable nucleotide repeat expansion in the dystrophia myotonica protein kinase gene and the zinc finger protein 9 gene, respectively. The heart is commonly involved in DM patients, and cardiac disorders are also an important cause of premature death in these patients, usually as an arrhythmic-related sudden cardiac death [ , ]. As we reported before, patients with DM1 typically manifest various bradyarrhythmias (especially atrioventricular blocks), while patients with DM2 usually present various tachyarrhythmias (especially supraventricular or ventricular tachycardia) [ ].
It is well known that cardiac autonomic nervous system (cANS) imbalance in specific conditions may trigger potentially life-threatening or malignant arrhythmias [ , ]. Heart rate variability (HRV) and especially heart rate turbulence (HRT) are simple and reliable techniques that can be useful for evaluating the influence of the autonomic nervous system on the heart. The cANS dysfunction manifested by Holter-derived HRV and/or HRT impairment was reported in many studies to be an important risk factor for cardiovascular death, especially in patients after myocardial infarction or left ventricular heart failure [ , ]. Currently American guidelines still recommend HRV and HRT assessment as potentially useful tools in the improvement of risk stratification of patients at risk of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias [ ].
However, there are very limited and divergent data on cANS imbalance and its significance in patients with DM, who also are at risk of sudden cardiovascular death. Potential association between disease duration or degree of skeletal muscle impairment and the cardiac abnormalities (including cANS) is a matter of ongoing discussion. Whether cANS abnormalities accompany or influence the myocardial degenerative abnormalities in DM remain unclear.
The purpose of the present study was to evaluate cANS function using Holter-derived and standard electrocardiographic parameters in patients with DM and no clinically overt heart dysfunction. Our research purpose was also to check if any differences in cANS between DM1 and DM2 might be detected. We hypothesized that since DM is primarily a neuromuscular disorder and clinically overt DM1 and DM2 subjects differ in the type of heart involvement, then they may also differ in cardiac autonomic function in the preclinical overt period. Therefore, we performed a comprehensive neurological and cardiac non-invasive evaluation of genetically confirmed DM1 and DM2 patients. We assessed time-domain HRV and HRT in 24-h ambulatory Holter monitoring and also QT intervals dispersion (QTd) in standard electrocardiography in all examined patients and specially selected sex- and age-matched healthy controls. In spite of ongoing controversy and irrespective of the limitation of prognostic value in cardiac patients, increased QTd may show not only inhomogeneity of the myocardial repolarization, but also may indirectly reflect cANS imbalance in examined subjects [ , , , ].
Methods
Study population
Initially we examined 114 consecutive adult patients with genetically confirmed DM (59 with DM1 and 55 with DM2). Clinical and genetic identification of DM was established as previously described [ ]. Briefly, DM1 was confirmed by the presence of an expanded CTG trinucleotide repeat located in the dystrophia myotonica protein kinase gene, while DM2 was diagnosed by the presence of an expanded CCTG tetranucleotide repeat located in the zinc finger protein 9 gene. Subjects with an implanted pacemaker or cardioverter defibrillator, atrial fibrillation or flutter, previously detected coronary artery disease, echocardiographic signs of left ventricular systolic dysfunction or significant heart valvular abnormalities were not included in the study. Patients with diabetes mellitus, decreased kidney function defined by a serum creatinine concentration ≥132 μmol/L, significant anaemia with haemoglobin concentration <10.0 g/L, thyroid or hepatic dysfunction, or receiving beta-blockers or non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers were not included either.
All examined persons were stable condition outpatients and underwent detailed clinical cardiac and neurological evaluation, standard electrocardiography, 24-h Holter monitoring, transthoracic echocardiography, and routine laboratory tests.
Patients with DM1 were evaluated by the neurologist using the Muscular Impairment Rating Scale (MIRS) and patients with DM2 using the modified MIRS scale (mMIRS). In MIRS, 5 grades of muscle impairment are presented: grade 1—no muscular impairment, grade 2—minimal signs without distal weakness, grade 3—distal weakness, grade 4—slight to moderate proximal weakness, and grade 5—severe proximal weakness [ ]. In mMIRS, 5 grades were also evaluated: grade 1—no muscular impairment, grade 2—minimal signs (neck flexors impairment without proximal limb muscle weakness), grade 3—proximal weakness, grade 4—mild to moderate distal weakness, and grade 5—severe distal weakness. Disease duration was defined as time of overt neurological manifestations (muscle weakness, myotonia).
Control groups was specially selected for this study and consisted of non-smoking healthy volunteers. All patients and control subjects gave their written informed consent to participate in the study. This study was conducted in accordance with the amended Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol of the study was accepted by the local institutional bioethics committee.
Standard electrocardiography
Standard 12-lead electrocardiography tracings were acquired with the supine position using electrocardiographic system (Philips Medical System, Page Writer Trim III, Andover, MA, USA). Tracings were acquired at 25 and 50 mm/s paper speed and 10 mm/mV gain. Precise analysis of the electrocardiogram was performed by the cardiologist according to guidelines based on AHA/ACCF/HRS Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram. The longest QT interval among all 12 leads (most often leads II, V2, or V3) was used for QTc calculation with Bazett's formula. QTd value was estimated manually as the difference between the longest and the shortest QT intervals among all 12-lead electrocardiography, using 50 mm/s paper speed. QT interval data were estimated for subjects without intraventricular conduction defects with QRS >120 ms.
24-h Holter monitoring
All studied subjects underwent a routine ambulatory 24-h Holter monitoring performed on a 3-channel digitized recordings (Lifecard CF, Spacelabs Healthcare, Snoqualmie, WA, USA). An evaluation of heart rate, presence of supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias and time-domain heart rate variability analysis were performed (Sentinel Impresario, Spacelabs Healthcare). Supraventricular and ventricular tachycardia were diagnosed when the rated of arrhythmia was >100 bpm with at least three consecutive beats.
According to the Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, the following four indexes of time-domain HRV were measured: the standard deviation of normal-to-normal (N–N) intervals (SDNN), the standard deviation of the average of N–N intervals in all 5-min periods of the entire recording (SDANN), the square root of the mean of the sum of the squares of differences between adjacent N–N intervals (RMSDD), and the total number of all NN intervals divided by the height of the histogram of all NN intervals measured on a discrete scale with bins of 7–8125 ms (1/128 s) (HRV-Index). The SDNN and HRV-Index estimate of overall HRV, SDANN estimate of long-term components of HRV, and RMSSD estimate of short-term components of HRV. The choice of above four parameters is considered as sufficient for time-domain HRV analysis due to many of various parameters correlate closely with others. Two estimates of the overall HRV are recommended because the HRV-Index permits only casual pre-processing of the electrocardiographic signal [ ].
Two numerical HRT parameters after ventricular premature contractions (e.g. turbulence onset, TO and turbulence slope, TS) were calculated using custom designed software based on Schmidt et al. described methodology [ , ]. First, TO which reflects the initial phase of sinus rhythm acceleration is defined as a percentage difference between the mean of first two sinus RR intervals after and the last two RR intervals before ventricular premature contraction. TO was calculated for all ventricular premature contractions separately and then averaged. The second parameter, TS, which describes the following deceleration phase, is described as a maximum positive slope of a regression line assessed over five consecutive RR intervals within the first 15 sinus RR interval after ventricular premature contraction. TS calculation was based on an averaged local tachogram. TO and TS were calculated, if at least two suitable ventricular premature contractions for HRT analysis were detected in Holter monitoring. Careful manual review and filtering algorithm were used to eliminate inappropriate electrocardiographic strips. Ventricular premature contractions with prematurity <20% and/or a post-extrasystole interval <20% longer than the reference interval were excluded for HRT assessment. The filtering algorithm also excluded for HRT calculation the following RR intervals: <300 ms or >2000 ms, with >200 ms difference to the preceding sinus interval, and with >20% difference to the reference interval (mean of the five last sinus RR intervals). According to proposed criteria by the International Society for Holter and Noninvasive Electrocardiology and Schmidt et al., HRT is recognized as abnormal when TO ≥0.0% and TS ≤2.5 ms/RR (ms/RR interval), and such cut-off values were used in most clinical studies [ , ]. All HRV and HRT parameters were evaluated over the full 24 h without separation for day and night periods. In all subjects Holter monitoring was performed during normal everyday activity. They were not allowed to have any strenuous physical activity or to stay in a bed for prolonged time during a day–time period. They were also asked to avoid mental stress and to go to bed before noon. All subjects were ordered to fulfil their “Patients' diaries” in which their normal activity or abnormal situations were described. All Holter recordings were analysed by the qualified cardiologist.
Transthoracic echocardiography
Transthoracic echocardiography was performed using a Philips iE33 ultrasound system (Philips Medical System, Andover, MA, USA) with 2.5–3.5 MHz transducer. Patients were examined in the left lateral position. All standard dimensions and left ventricular ejection fractions were measured according to current American and European recommendations. Measurements were averaged over five consecutive heart cycles. The analysis of echocardiograms was performed by two independent qualified cardiologists.
Statistical analysis
Patients with both types of DM and controls were compared by either Student’s t test or the Wilcoxon test, according to parameters of distribution assessed by the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Variables with a normal distribution are presented as mean followed by standard deviation. Variables not showing the normal distribution are presented as median with range values. Deletions of outlier data were not performed. For categorical variables, the differences between groups were compared by the Fisher exact test. All tests were double-sided. Correlations were evaluated by Spearman correlation coefficients. Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Analyses were performed using a statistical software package (STATISTICA 12, StatSoft Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA).
Results
Clinical characteristics of study population
Eventually, 44 patients with DM1 (F/M 16/28) and 40 patients with DM2 (F/M 27/13) fulfilled our study inclusion criteria. Patients with DM1 were of mean age 34.9 ± 11.5 and with DM2 47.8 ± 8.5 years. Median of disease duration was 5.0 (1.0–39.0) years for DM1 and 7.5 (1.0–48.0) years for DM2 patients. Two separate control groups of sex- and aged-matched healthy subjects were selected for DM1 (i.e. CG1, n = 35) and for DM2 (i.e. CG2, n = 30). Nineteen (43.2%) DM1 and 25 (62.5%) DM2 subjects presented moderate, minimal or even no neurological symptoms (MIRS/mMIRS 1–3), while others had more advanced symptoms (MIRS/mMIRS 4–5). The general characteristics of study population, ejection fraction of left ventricle and main electrocardiographic and Holter monitoring data are shown in the Table 1 (DM1 vs. CG1 and DM2 vs. CG2).

Moreover, one (2.7%) DM1 and 13 (32.5%) DM2 patients had mild, well-controlled arterial hypertension. Because of arterial hypertension and lipid abnormalities, patients with DM were treated with typical cardiovascular drugs, including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptors blockers (one patient with DM1 and 12 with DM2), dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (five patients with DM2), statins or fibrates (one patient with DM1 and 10 with DM2). Because of severe myotonia, mexiletine was also prescribed by the neurologist in six (11.7%) DM1 and three (6.9%) DM2 patients. No subject of the control groups received any drugs.
Standard electrocardiography and Holter monitoring data
All patients and healthy controls had sinus rhythm in standard electrocardiography and in Holter monitoring. Results of main standard electrocardiography findings including QTc interval, as well as Holter data in whole study populations of the entire recording period are presented in Table 1 . Comparison of time-domain HRV, HRT, and QTd parameters is shown in Table 2 (DM1 vs. CG1 and DM2 vs. CG2) and also in Table 3 (DM patients MIRS/mMIRS 1–3 vs. MIRS/mMIRS 4-5). No significant differences of HRV parameters between studied groups were detected. However, as compared to controls, TO ( p = 0.015) and TS ( p = 0.018) were significantly impaired in DM1, while TS ( p = 0.042) was diminished in DM2 patients. In DM2 subjects an occurrence of abnormal HRT was also significantly more frequently observed ( p = 0.034). Patients with DM and controls did not differ statistically in the number of ventricular premature beats used to derive the HRT indices. It should be noted that PR and QTc interval prolongation (a well-known observation), as well as increased QTd were significantly more frequently detected in DM1 and DM2 patients, as compared to healthy subjects. The incidence of the maxima and minima of QT duration in different leads of standard electrocardiogram in myotonic dystrophy patients and controls is presented in Table 4 .

Since age is one of the most important factors influencing HRV and HRT results, in order to perform a direct comparison of HRV, HRT, and QTd parameters between DM1 and DM2 we adjusted these groups. Thus, we excluded for further analysis ten the youngest DM1 and ten the oldest DM2 patients. In this way we could compare patients with the same mean age. No significant differences in time-domain HRV, HRT, and QTd between strict age-matched DM1 and DM2 patients were observed either (Table 5 ). HRV and HRT analysis was performed in total for entire day and night period and the shortest recording lasted 22 h and 39 min.

In DM1 patients significant correlations were revealed between HRV parameters and age: for SDNN ( r = −0.391, p = 0.009), for SDANN ( r = −0.371, p = 0.013), and for RMSSD ( r = −0.471, p = 0.001). Correlations between QTd and TO ( r = 0.613, p = 0.02) and between QTd and TS ( r = 0.431, p = 0.024) were also revealed. However, we did not demonstrate correlations between HRV, HRT, or QTd and DM1 duration.
In DM2 patients significant correlations were also revealed between HRV parameters and age: for SDNN ( r = −0.426, p = 0.006), for SDANN ( r = −0.340, p = 0.032), and for RMSSD ( r = −0.397, p = 0.011). Significant correlations were also observed between TS and SDNN ( r = 0.422, p = 0.04) and TS and HRV-Index ( r = 0.415, p = 0.044). In DM2 subjects QTd correlated with QTc ( r = 0.416, p = 0.008) too. Like DM1 patients, in DM2 no significant correlations for disease duration were observed either.
Discussion
Myotonic dystrophy is a progressive multi-organ disorder characterized by a frequent occurrence of muscle weakness and wasting, myotonia (difficulty in skeletal muscle relaxation), and other neurological and non-neurological abnormalities, also involving the heart. Because of the late onset and a milder course, DM2 is usually considered to be more favourable compared to DM1 [ , ]. A few studies on cANS function in DM have been published up to now. However, they usually estimated standard autonomic tests and/or HRV in small groups of patients [ , , , , ]. Moreover, most of them included solely subjects with DM1, and only one study evaluated 16 DM2 patients [ , , , , ]. There is only one study reporting impairment of HRT in 29 patients with DM1 performed by Casella et al. [ ]. The authors of this evaluation revealed an impairment of TO in DM1 subjects and suggested that it can indicate an impaired cardiac parasympathetic activity. A prognostic value of observed TO impairment in DM1 was not examined[ ]. To date, in DM patients the cANS function has been evaluated with conflicting results (described as normal or slightly impaired); therefore, how it relates to heart involvement remains unclear. Nevertheless, it is also worth noting that not only cANS function, but also other manifestation of autonomic dysfunction was recently described in DM1 patients (concerning gastrointestinal tract) [ ].
Our study represents the first evaluation of HRT analysis including both DM1 and DM2 patients. The novel finding is that HRT parameters were significantly impaired in DM subjects without clinically overt heart involvement. Although TO and TS were more diminished in DM (as compared to healthy controls), no significant differences in time-domain HRV parameters between examined groups were observed.
The reason for impaired HRT parameters in DM (by contrast to HRV) is difficult to explain. It is proven that HRV and HRT are influenced by cANS and its sympathetic and vagal tone. Moreover, HRT after ventricular premature contraction occurs as a consequence of a baroreceptor reflex biphasic reaction caused by blood pressure oscillation with probably a predominance of parasympathetic response. Diminished HRT in DM could be explained of a very early stage of vagal hypofunction then. Such conclusion is also in line with HRV assessment performed by Hardin et al. in 289 patients with DM1. After detailed analysis the authors of this study believed that parasympathetic diminished activity is the major finding of cANS assessment in DM1 [ ].
It is worth noting that cardiac symptomatic DM1 and DM2 subjects differ in the type of the heart involvement, especially in the type of arrhythmia occurrence. In DM1 usually atrioventricular and intraventricular conduction defects are observed, while in DM2 frequent extrasystole, short supraventricular and ventricular tachycardia are present [ ]. Our study shows that cANS has minor (if any) influence on development of specific arrhythmia because no significant differences in time-domain HRV, HRT, and QTd between specially age-matched selected DM1 and DM2 subjects were observed. Similarly to arrhythmia occurrence, no relationships between disease duration or neurological status and time-domain HRV, HRT, and QTd parameters were observed either.
Our results might also provide useful information in interpreting the pathogenesis of sudden cardiac death or other adverse cardiac events in DM patients. It is well known that meaningfully increased QTc and QTd may be associated with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation [ , ]. However, there are limited data on strict association between cANS dysfunction and QTd. Indirect evidences on such relation provided studies on QTd in diabetes mellitus type 1 patients with and without cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (patients with neuropathy presented significantly increased QTd) [ ]. Clinically relevant importance of QT assessment was also validated by large trial performed by Breton et al., in which corrected QT interval >450 ms (similar to PR interval >200 ms) was an independent predictor of sudden death or pacemaker implantation in DM1 patients [ ].
To our knowledge our paper is the first one presenting QTd analysis both in DM1 and DM2 patients. Obviously, we are aware of limitations of the prognostic value of increased QTd in general population. However, the prognostic value of QTd has not been evaluated in DM1 and DM2 patients as of yet. Our results on increased QTd are in line with earlier studies, which demonstrated that DM1 patients are characterized by increased repolarization of abnormalities assessed in electrocardiography by prolonged QTc interval or increased QT variability index [ , ]. The results achieved in our study also confirmed these observations because our patients (as compared to controls) presented not only significantly increased QTc, but also QTd intervals ( p = 0.003 for DM1, and p < 0.0001 for DM2). A prolongation of QTd in our patients may be considered for the next evidence of subclinical sympathetic/vagal imbalance with parasympathetic lower activity in DM. It should be added that, besides cANS imbalance, the abnormalities of ventricular repolarization in DM are also caused by myocardial inhomogeneity due to interstitial fibrosis and fatty infiltration, which were found at post-mortem studies and a cardiovascular magnetic resonance assessment [ , ].
On another note, an association between increased QTd and ventricular arrhythmias was reported in patients in another neuromuscular disease such as Duchene-type muscular dystrophy. In the study of Yotsukura et al., QTd ≥60 ms was significantly associated with an increased incidence of serious ventricular arrhythmias in these patients [ ] Nevertheless, QTd and its predictive value have not been evaluated in DM1 or DM2 as yet. We believe that increased QTd might be a good additional marker of the heart involvement and cANS imbalance in DM subjects, and it should be validated in the future studies. Still, it is also worth noting that similar to time-domain HRV and HRT parameters, no relationship between disease duration or neurological status and QTd parameters was observed.
In summary, our findings on time-domain HRV complement earlier observations and detected no significant impairment of cANS in DM1/DM2 patients without clinically relevant involvement of the heart. However, it should be underlined that abnormal HRT described as TO ≥0.0% and/or TS ≤2.5 ms/RR was present in as many as 18.8% DM1 and 25.0% DM2 patients in which HRT was possible to evaluate. Irrespective of limitations of HRT measurement methodology, diminished HRT in both types of DM suggest minor parasympathetic dysfunction or other, unknown dysfunction associated with baroreflex sensitivity.
Limitations
Our study is based on single-centre prospective observational data only and included a relatively small number of cases. We also had to exclude 15 patients with DM1 and 14 with DM2 due to co-existing disorders. However, designed restrictions for inclusion in the study were necessary to avoid any well-known conditions influencing ANS function. Therefore, we did not exclude patients with mild, well-controlled arterial hypertension [ , ]. Nevertheless, a minor influence on cANS of prescribed drugs due to hypertension cannot be excluded.
A further major limitation is the obligatory presence of ventricular premature complexes suitable for HRT analysis. Because of this requirement, 28 DM1 (63.6%) and 16 DM2 (40.0%) patients were not included into HRT analysis. We estimated HRT when at least two suitable ventricular premature contractions were present, whereas standards of the International Society for Holter and Noninvasive Electrocardiology suggest using at least five ventricular premature contractions for HRT assessment, especially for TS [ ]. This restriction is obligatory in large risk stratification trials, and it is difficult to fulfil in studies concerning rare diseases (like DM) or healthy volunteers. Because of all the above mentioned limitations, a practical usefulness of HRT assessment in DM (especially DM1) subjects seem controversial. A possible limitation is also lack of frequency-domain HRV analysis or Ewing’s tests for assessing cANS function. In our opinion two well-tried methods, i.e. HRT and time-domain HRV, should be sufficient and several studies revealed correlations between HRT and time-domain HRV parameters in patients with typical cANS neuropathy, e.g. in patients with diabetes mellitus or systemic sclerosis [ , ].
Obviously, in spite of similar environmental conditions during Holter monitoring, repetitive and the same conditions are possible in autonomic laboratory only. Therefore, an influence of various conditions and especially subjects mobility (lower in DM patients) on HRV and HRT parameters should be also taken into consideration in results interpretation.
It should be noted that our findings need to be validated in future studies before increased QTd or impaired HRT in DM patients could be regarded as a reliable and helpful prediction markers of presaging clinically relevant heart involvement, especially life-threatening arrhythmia. Moreover, we think that QT interval variability indices assessment would complement our findings on QTd, as previous studies on various populations suggest the relation between autonomic nervous system (especially sympathetic activity) and cardiac repolarization variability at cellular, tissue, and organ level [ ]. It should also be underlined that manually assessed QTd in our study might be assessed with a small inaccuracy, irrespective of our very good quality electrocardiograms.
Conclusions
Electrocardiographic and Holter-derived assessment provides ambiguous data on cANS in DM patients without clinically relevant heart involvement. As compared to healthy controls, DM1 and DM2 patients presented no differences in time-domain HRV evaluation. However, their HRT and QTd assessment suggests cANS imbalance with lower vagal activity. No relationships between disease duration or neurological status and time-domain HRV, HRT, and QTd parameters were found. Whether cANS abnormalities influence or accompany (even minor) the myocardial alterations in DM patients remain unclear. The hypothesis of a role of cANS dysfunction in the genesis of distinct cardiac abnormalities in DM1 and DM2 was not confirmed by our study.
