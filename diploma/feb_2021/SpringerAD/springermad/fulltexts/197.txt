Introduction
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) constitute venous thromboembolism (VTE)—a potentially fatal disease for which no anticoagulant treatment is available [ ]. The incidence of VTE associated with impaired quality of life and loss of disability-adjusted life years is high but preventable for medical and surgical patients [ , ]. Compelling evidence has revealed that risk factors for VTE include older age [ ], diabetes mellitus (DM) [ ], chronic kidney disease (CKD) [ ], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [ ], cancer [ ], major orthopedic surgery [ ], spinal cord injury [ ], and major general surgery [ ].
Appendectomy is the most common abdominal emergency surgery for treating acute appendicitis [ ]. Because surgeons do not regard appendectomy as a major surgery, preventive strategies against VTE are not implemented during appendectomy surgery in Taiwan. However, VTE may become serious in patients who have recently undergone surgery [ ]. According to analyses of Clinical Practice Research Datalink and Hospital Episode Statistics in the United Kingdom, the risk of VTE is 6-fold higher in patients following appendectomy than not following appendectomy [ ]. The prevalence of VTE is lower in Asian countries than in Western countries, and thus few studies have investigated the incidence and risk of VTE after appendectomy in Asian populations [ , ]. Therefore, we conducted a nationwide cohort study to investigate the incidence and risk of DVT and PE in patients following appendectomy in Taiwan.
Highlights
The physicians do not implement preventive strategies against venous thromboembolism (VTE) when patients receive appendectomy surgery in Taiwan. The patients who underwent open appendectomy were at a 1.73-fold higher risk of symptomatic VTE than nonappendectomy cohort. The appendectomy cohort aged > 65 years with comorbidity exhibited a 33-fold higher aHR for VTE than did the nonappendectomy cohort aged < 50 years without comorbidity (95% CI 28.4–38.3). The patients who underwent laparoscopic appendectomy did not carry a significant risk of symptomatic VTE compared with that in the nonappendectomy cohort. The surgeons should consider proactive strategies against VTE for those underwent open appendectomy but do not need preventive strategies against VTE for laparoscopic appendectomy.
Methods
This study obtained approval from the Institutional Review Board of China Medical University Hospital (CMUH-104-REC2-115), Taiwan.
Data source
In 1995, Taiwan’s Department of Health established the country’s National Health Insurance (NHI) program. Offering almost universal medical care, the NHI program is a mandatory single-payer social insurance system that covered 99% of all 23.74 million Taiwanese citizens at the time of this study. The National Health Research Institutes has been authorized to compile claims data from all health care providers into the NHI Research Database (NHIRD) for research purposes. In the present study, all information related to personal identification was encrypted before each dataset was released. Histories of surgery and comorbidities for each participant were obtained from inpatient claims files. Diagnoses and procedures were recorded based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes. Studies have confirmed the diagnostic accuracy of ICD-9-CM codes in the NHIRD [ , , ].
Study participants
In our retrospective cohort study, we identified patients aged at least 20 years with complete age and sex information who underwent appendectomy surgery (ICD-9-CM operation room procedure codes 47.0–47.1) between 2000 and 2013 as the case cohort. We randomly selected four individuals who did not undergo appendectomy surgery (nonappendectomy cohort) for each appendectomy case through frequency matching for age (5-year span groupings), sex, and index year.
Patients with a prior diagnosis of DVT (ICD-9-CM code 453.8) and PE (ICD-9-CM code 415.1) were excluded.
Outcome and comorbidity
The appendectomy and the nonappendectomy cohorts were followed until DVT or PE occurred; some individuals were excluded because of lack of follow-up, death, or no occurrence of DVT or PE before the end of 2013. Baseline comorbidity histories of atrial fibrillation (ICD-9-CM code 427.31), hypertension (ICD-9-CM codes 401–405), DM (ICD-9-CM code 250), cerebrovascular disease (CVA; ICD-9-CM codes 430–438), heart failure (ICD-9-CM code 428), lower leg fracture or surgery (ICD-9-CM codes 820, 821, 823, 81.51–81.54), all cancers (ICD-9-CM codes 140–208), pregnancy (ICD-9-CM codes 72–74, 650–659, 640–676), CKD (ICD-9-CM code 585), COPD (ICD-9-CM codes 491, 492, 496), and hyperlipidemia (ICD-9-CM code 272) were identified based on diagnoses in the inpatient claims data prior to the index date.
Statistical analysis
Demographic factors including age, sex, and comorbidities were compared between the appendectomy and nonappendectomy cohorts using Student’s t test and a χ 2 test; Student’s t test was used for continuous variables and a χ 2 test was used for categorical variables. We estimated the overall incidence densities and sex-, age-, and comorbidity-specific incidence densities (10,000 person-years) for DVT and PE. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for DVT and PE with stratification based on age, sex, and comorbidities. The multivariate models were simultaneously adjusted for age, sex, and comorbidities of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, DM, CVA, heart failure, all cancers, pregnancy, lower leg fracture or surgery, CKD, COPD, and atrial fibrillation. All analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.4 for Windows. A two-sided p value < 0.05 was deemed statistically significant.
Results
From 23 million beneficiaries in the NHIRD, we identified 246,612 patients for the appendectomy cohort and 986,448 for the nonappendectomy cohort (Fig. 1 ). The distributions for age and sex were similar in both cohorts (Table 1 ). Compared with the nonappendectomy control group, the appendectomy group was more likely to have atrial fibrillation, hypertension, DM, CVA, heart failure, lower leg fracture or surgery, all cancers, pregnancy, CKD, COPD, and hyperlipidemia (p < 0.001 for all).

The incidence rates of DVT and PE in both cohorts stratified by sex, age and comorbidities are shown in Table 2 . The overall incidence density of VTE was significantly higher in patients who underwent appendectomy than in those who did not [5.9 vs. 3.29 per 10,000 person-years, crude HR (cHR) = 1.79, 95% CI 1.67–1.93]. After adjustment for covariates, the appendectomy cohort exhibited a 1.68-fold higher adjusted HR (aHR) for VTE than did the nonappendectomy cohort (95% CI 1.56–1.88). The appendectomy cohort exhibited a significantly increased overall incidence of DVT compared with the nonappendectomy cohort. In addition, patients in the appendectomy cohort had a higher cHR and aHR for developing DVT than did those in the nonappendectomy cohort, irrespective of stratification by sex, age, or comorbidities. The appendectomy cohort also had a significantly higher overall incidence of PE than did the nonappendectomy cohort; however, patients who underwent appendectomy exhibited an increased risk of PE compared with their control counterparts in all stratified subgroups except for ≥ 65 years subgroup (after adjustment of the model for age, sex, and comorbidities).

Table 4 shows that incidence of VTE was highest in the patients who underwent open appendectomy followed by those who underwent laparoscopic appendectomy, and the nonappendectomy cohort (6.23 vs. 3.55 vs. 3.29 per 10,000 person-years). The patients who underwent open appendectomy exhibited a 1.73-fold higher risk of VTE than the nonappendectomy cohort (aHR = 1.73, 95% CI 1.61–1.87). No significantly increased risk of VTE was observed in the patients who underwent laparoscopic appendectomy compared with those in the nonappendectomy cohort. Regarding risk of DVT, 1.35-fold and 1.84-fold increased aHRs were observed in the patients who underwent laparoscopic appendectomy and open appendectomy, respectively, compared with the nonappendectomy cohort. The patients who underwent open appendectomy had a 1.53-fold increased risk of PE compared with the nonappendectomy cohort (aHR = 1.53, 95% CI 1.34–1.75), whereas those who underwent laparoscopic appendectomy did not exhibit an increased risk of PE compared with the nonappendectomy cohort.

Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, the present study was the first to investigate the incidence of VTE in inpatients who underwent appendectomy in an Asian population. The overall incidence of VTE in patients who underwent appendectomy was 5.9 per 10,000 person-years. The incidence of VTE in patients with appendectomy in Taiwan was lower than that in the United Kingdom (5.9 per 10,000 vs. 40 per 10,000 person-years) [ ]. The variation in VTE incidence between Taiwan and the United Kingdom may be associated with ethnic differences and environmental factors [ , , ].
The overall incidence of VTE was higher in the appendectomy cohort than in the nonappendectomy cohort. Moreover, the appendectomy cohort had a higher prevalence of comorbidities than did the nonappendectomy cohort, as shown in Table 1 . However, the aHR of VTE was 1.68-fold higher in the patients who underwent appendectomy than in those who did not after adjustment for covariates. Virchow postulated that alterations in blood flow (stasis), vascular endothelial injury, and changes in blood (hypercoagulable status) may lead to VTE [ ]. Patients who undergo surgery may subsequently spend time resting, which can lead to poor blood flow [ ]. In addition, surgery activates stress responses and leads to hemoconcentration and hypercoagulable status [ , ].
Open appendectomy is traditionally performed through an incision in the right lower abdomen. Laparoscopic appendectomy is increasingly conducted by making three small incisions while viewing an enlarged image of the patient’s internal organs on a monitor. Studies have indicated that laparoscopic appendectomy may result in quicker operative recovery, an earlier return to normal activity, and a shorter hospital stay despite the longer operation time and higher operative cost compared with open appendectomy [ , ]. Compared with the nonappendectomy cohort, a 1.73-fold increased risk of VTE was observed in the patients who underwent open appendectomy. However, the patients who underwent laparoscopic appendectomy did not exhibit a significantly higher risk of VTE than the nonappendectomy cohort. The incidence of symptomatic VTE was lower in the patients who underwent laparoscopic appendectomy than in those who underwent open appendectomy (3.55 vs. 6.23 per 10,000 person-years); this finding is similar to that of a previous study, which revealed that laparoscopic surgery is associated with a lower incidence of VTE compared with open surgery [ ].
The appendectomy cohort exhibited a significantly increased risk of DVT compared with the nonappendectomy cohort, regardless of sex, age, or comorbidities; based on this finding, early postoperative mobilization is warranted [ ]. In addition, the appendectomy patients aged > 65 years with comorbidities exhibited a considerably high incidence and risk of VTE compared with those in the nonappendectomy cohort aged < 50 years without comorbidities. Therefore, proactive strategy for VTE prevention is indicted for the aged patients with comorbidities following appendectomy [ ].
The incidence of VTE was highest within the first month following surgery among the patients who underwent appendectomy, with an absolute rate of 25.9 per 10,000 person-years; this rate decreased after 1 month. Within the first month after surgery, the patients who underwent appendectomy had an 8.15-fold higher risk of VTE than did those in the nonappendectomy cohort during the same period. These findings could serve as a reminder for surgeons to consider proactive strategies for VTE prevention after appendectomy.
The strength of this study is that it is the first to conduct a nationwide cohort study on the risk of symptomatic VTE in patients following appendectomy among an Asian population. Our findings can be generalized to the general population. However, several limitations should be considered during interpretation of these findings. First, a lack of drug information such as that related to hormone replacement therapy and anticoagulants may have influenced the outcomes of interest. Second, data on family history, smoking habits, and postoperative ambulation are not available in the NHIRD; smoking is closely associated with COPD [ ]. We controlled for COPD to mediate the confounding effect of smoking. Third, diagnoses based on ICD-9-CM codes in the current study may have resulted in misclassification. However, the NHI Administration can minimize diagnostic misclassification and uncertainty by routinely reviewing claims data through an administrative peer review process. Previous studies showed that a positive predictive value by using ICD-9-CM codes to define VTE reached approximately 90% [ , ].
In conclusion, this nationwide study of 246,612 patients who underwent appendectomy and 986,448 who did not revealed that the appendectomy patients aged > 65 years with comorbidities exhibited a considerably high incidence and risk of VTE compared with those in the nonappendectomy cohort aged < 50 years without comorbidities. The patients who underwent open appendectomy exhibited a 1.73-fold higher risk of symptomatic VTE than did the control cohort. Those who underwent laparoscopic appendectomy did not exhibit a significantly increased risk of symptomatic VTE. The risk of symptomatic VTE was highest within the first month following appendectomy. These findings could serve as a reminder for surgeons to consider proactive strategies of VTE prevention for the aged patients with comorbidities following appendectomy.
