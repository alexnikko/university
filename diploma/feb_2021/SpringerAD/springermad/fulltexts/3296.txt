INTRODUCTION
The lung offer several advantages for the delivery of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) compared to other routes of administration. Such advantages include the localized treatment of lung diseases and infection, rapid clinical response, and the use of lower doses reducing the risk of systemic side effects ( ). Currently, drug delivery to the lungs can be achieved by devices including nebulizers, metered dose inhalers (MDIs), and dry powder inhalers (DPIs). The DPI is a device which delivers the API as a dry powder and has several advantages compared to the other devices (MDI and nebulizer). These include improved stability of the API, simplicity of use, and good patient compliance ( ).
Briefly, the aerosol performance of a dry powder formulation is dependent on the following: (1) the inspiratory flow rate (L/min); (2) the design of the DPI; and (3) the properties of the dry powder formulation ( ). A higher inspiratory flow rate (L/min) will generally increase the de-agglomeration forces generated within the DPI, which subsequently lead to an improvement in the amount of micronized API deposited in the lung, as measured by an increase in the fine particle fraction of the formulation ( , ).
Dry powder inhalers are generally categorized based on the inspiratory flow rate (L/min) to achieve a pressure drop of 4 kPa, either as a high (90 L/min), medium (60 L/min), or low resistance (30 L/min) device. In general, high resistance devices are designed to generate higher turbulence and subsequently achieve a higher respirable dose of the API ( , , , ).
Finally, as particles between 1 and 3 μm are generally regarded as the optimal size for deposition in the deeper regions of the lung ( , ), the primary challenge for respiratory scientist is in the development of formulations which limit the natural tendency of micronized particles (<5 μm) to form large, cohesive, agglomerates from inter/intraparticulate interactions that cause a reduction in the flowability and dispersibility of the formulation ( , , , ).
Currently, standard carrier-based formulations are used in the delivery of low dose API (typically in μg; ∼100–500 μg) for the treatment of inflammatory lung conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( , ). A carrier-based formulation is an interactive mixture consisting of micronized (<5 μm) API attached onto the surface of the larger carrier particle (∼30–90 μm) ( ), typically lactose, which improve the flowability and dispersibility of low-dose dry powder formulations ( , , ). However, the expanding application of DPIs in the delivery of high-dose API (in mg) for the management of diabetes ( ) and lung infection ( ) has led to new formulation methods tailored for higher dose delivery, as the saturation of active sites on the surface of carrier particles in high-dose formulations lead to fine particle segregation which is detrimental to aerosol performance ( ).
Previous reports indicate that the delivery of API from a particulate system of similar sizes is a more suitable platform in high-dose delivery than conventional carrier-based dry powder formulations ( ). This can be achieved by comilling the API, additive material, and excipient using a jet-mill apparatus. Additive material such as magnesium stearate (MGST) is chosen for its antiadherent and antifriction properties which reduce the agglomerate strength and enhance the dispersibility and flowability profile of the formulation ( ). The excipient material, typically lactose, is often used to add bulk to the final comilled formulation.
Comilling of API with additive material in the production of dry powder formulations has gained considerable interest in the field of respiratory drug delivery. Research by Zhou et al. ( , , ) has demonstrated how improvements in powder flowability and dispersibility of comilled formulations can be achieved by mechanofusion of API with MGST, which is basically a dry coating process where the surfaces of the pre-micronized API are coated by a thin layer of MGST. Similarly, research by Tay et al. ( ) has demonstrated that improvements in aerosol performance of a dry powder formulation can be achieved by mixing micronized API-MGST in a Turbula mixer.
These methods (mechanofusion/Turbula mix) typically produce final composite particles with the surface of the API “coated” by the additive material, without significant changes in the particle size of the materials (typically a nanometer coating by mechanofusion ( )). In comparison to the mechanofusion and Turbula mix, comilling using the jet-mill apparatus result in the simultaneous production of composite particles, particle size reduction, and surface coverage of API by the additive material ( ). This can lead to the generation of particles with enhanced powder flowability characteristics and dispersibility properties, as demonstrated in the patent by Morton ( ) in the comill of the API with MGST using the jet-mill apparatus.
The aim of this study was to gain a deeper understanding of the interactions between comilled formulations of API/MGST/lactose produced by the jet-mill apparatus in terms of changes in physicochemical properties, and its effect on the overall aerosol performance of DPI formulations. Initially, experiments sought to understand the effect of MGST% ( w / w ) concentration on the aerosol performance and physicochemical properties of the comilled formulations, which would lead to a second set of experiments to understand the effect of API% ( w / w ) concentration on both physicochemical properties and aerosol performance for high-dose delivery. The effect of an increase in capsule fill mass of the DPI on the overall aerosol performance of the comilled formulations was also investigated.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
Lactose (InhaLac®, Meggle group, Germany), API (beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP), Farmabios S.R.L., Italy), and magnesium stearate (MGST, Peter Greven Group, Germany) were used as received. Reagents used for HPLC analysis were of chromatography quality and were supplied by Sigma (Sydney, NSW, Australia). Water was purified by reverse osmosis (Milli-Q, Sydney, Australia).
Preparation of Comilled BDP/MGST/Lactose Formulation
To investigate the optimal concentration of MGST% ( w / w ) on comilled formulations, five 10 g sample blends (batches 1–5) of BDP/MGST/lactose were prepared in the ratio presented in Table I . Initially, samples were mixed using a shaker-mixer (Hexagon Ltd., Model Alphie-03) for 60 min at 32 rpm using a steel container (radius 1.2 cm, height 4 cm, volume 18.1 cm 3 ). To investigate the effect of an increase in BDP concentration on aerosol performance in comilled formulations, another four batches (batches 6–9) were prepared (Table II ) following the same method as above. In all samples, lactose was used as a bulking agent to achieve a final powder weight of 100% ( w / w ). Each sample was then comilled by one pass through a jet-mill (Labo Mill Micronization Equipment FPS 0447, Italy), at 1 g/min feed rate, 7-bar injection pressure, and 7-bar grinding pressure at controlled room humidity and temperature (50% relative humidity (RH), 20 °C). After comilling via the jet-mill, samples were stored in glass containers at controlled temperature and humidity (50% RH, 20 °C). All samples were stored for a minimum of 24 h prior to analysis.

Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)
Scanning electron micrographs of all the blend samples were conducted using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (JEOL-JCM 6000 NeoScope Benchtop SEM, Tokyo, Japan) under a range of magnifications using 15-kV accelerating voltage. Prior to analysis, samples were mounted on adhesive carbon tape (pre-mounted on aluminum stubs) and coated twice with gold to a thickness of approximately 15 nm using a sputter coater (BAL-TEC SCD 005, Tokyo, Japan).
Particle Size Analysis by Laser Diffraction
Particle size analysis for each sample blend was determined by laser diffraction using a Mastersizer 3000 (Malvern, UK) equipped with Aero S dry powder dispersion unit, dry sample tray, and hopper. Approximately 50 mg powder samples were weighed and dispersed in air at a shear pressure of 3 bar. Size distributions were reported as D 10 , D 50 , and D 90 cumulative particle undersize values. Measurements were taken from three replicates of each sample at a default refractive index (RI 1.52) ( ) and analyzed using the Malvern Mastersizer software (version 3.30).
Uniformity of Content
Each sample blend was tested for uniformity of content according to the British Pharmacopoeia 2016 ( ). From each blend, ten random samples of 10 ± 1 mg were assayed and diluted in mobile phase (80% methanol and 20% water v / v ). Analysis of BDP content was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The % BDP recovery from each sample was determined from dividing the BDP content (from HPLC analysis) by the calculated amount of BDP in each sample.
Particle Size Shear Pressure Analysis
Particle size shear pressure profiles of the sample blends after jet-milling were determined by laser diffraction using the Mastersizer 3000 (Malvern, UK) as reported previously. Increasing shear pressures (0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 4 bar, respectively) were used to assess the strengths of the agglomerates ( ). Approximately 50 mg powder samples were weighed and fed through the hopper into the dry sample tray. Measurements were taken from three replicates of each sample with the RI set at 1.52 ( ). Sample data was processed and analyzed using the Malvern Mastersizer software (version 3.30).
X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS)
Chemical composition of the samples was analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis (XPS) (Specs, Surface Nano Analysis, Berlin, Germany) equipped with Al X-ray source with monochromator operating at 200 W, a hemispherical analyzer and a line delay detector with nine channels. A small amount of the powder sample was filled into powder sample holders. Survey spectra were acquired for binding energies in the range from 0 to 1200 eV using 30 eV pass energy. C 1s, O 1s, and N 1s region spectra were acquired at a pass energy of 23 eV with ten scans to obtain high spectral resolution and low noise level. The peaks were fitted with a sum of Gauss function with Shirley background using Marquardt-Levenberg fitting procedure of CasaXPS. The peaks were quantified using relative sensitivity factors
In Vitro Aerosol Performance Studies
The in vitro aerosol performance of each sample blend was determined using the abbreviated impactor apparatus (Fast Screening Impactor, FSI, Copley, UK). The FSI is a two-stage impactor consisting of a pre-separator stage which contains an insert with a central cup for the collection of the noninhalable bolus, and a lower stage with an aerodynamic cutoff diameter of 5 μm, when operating at a flow rate of 60 L/min. Particles less than 5 μm are collected in the fine particle chamber on a glass fiber filter which is located in an external filter holder with quick release latches.
Briefly, the pre-separator is assembled as follows: the insert is placed into the pre-separator base, the pre-separator base is fitted to the inlet of the impactor, 15 mL of HPLC mobile phase is added to the central cup of the pre-separator insert, and the pre-separator body is assembled on top of the pre-separator base and closed by the two latches. The induction port is fitted to the pre-separator inlet, and a mouthpiece adapter is fitted to the end of the induction port. The FSI uses the same induction port as the Apparatus E (Copley, Nottinghamshire, UK). The FSI was connected to a rotary vein pump (Westech Scientific Instruments, Bedfordshire, UK), and the flow rate was adjusted to 60 L/min using a calibrated flow meter (Model 4040, TSI Model Instruments, Germany).
The RSO1 (PlastiApe, SPA, Italy) high resistance dry powder inhaler was used for assessing the aerosol performances of the sample blends. Briefly, different amounts of powder sample (10, 20, and 30 mg) was loaded into size 3 hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) capsules (Capsugel, Peapack, NJ, USA), inserted into the DPI and the capsule pierced. The inhaler was inserted into custom-manufactured silicon molded mouthpieces attached to the FSI and actuated at an air flow set at 60 L/min for 4 s. After actuation, the inhaler device, capsule, mouthpiece, throat, pre-separator, and filter paper were washed with mobile phase and collected into individual volumetric flasks. Each sample was filtered with a 0.22-μm Nylon filter (Aireka Cells, 13-mm diameter, 0.22-μm pore size, Hong Kong) to remove any remaining lactose and MGST before determination of the BDP content by HPLC. All experiments were conducted at 20 ° C ± 2 °C and 50% ± 10% RH in triplicate. For the purpose of this study, the aerosolization parameters were defined as follows: recovered dose (RD)—the amount of BDP collected from the DPI, capsule, mouthpiece, throat, pre-separator, and the filter from the fine particle chamber; emitted dose % (ED)—the amount of BDP recovered from the mouthpiece, throat, pre-separator, and the filter from the fine particle chamber as a percentage of the RD; dispersibility (%, representing the powder de-agglomeration efficiency)—the amount of BDP recovered from the fine particle chamber as a percentage of the ED; fine particle dose (FPD)—the amount of fine BDP particles, less than 5 μm in size, collected on the filter in the fine particle chamber of the FSI.
Chemical Analysis by HPLC
Quantification of assayed samples containing BDP was performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. A Shimadzu Prominence HPLC system was utilized for all chemical quantification and consisted of SPD-20A UV-Vis detector, LC-20AT solvent delivery unit, SIL-20A HT Autosampler (Shimadzu Corporation, Japan). The pump flow rate was set to 1.0 mL/min, and the sample injection volume was 100 μL. A wavelength of 243 nm was used for detection of BDP and a NovaPak C18 column (5 μm, 150 mm × 3.9 mm) (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA) used for separation. The mobile phase was methanol and water (80:20% v / v ) filtered and degassed using a 0.45-μm membrane filter (Millipore, Country Cork, Ireland). Linearity was obtained between 0.05–100 μg/mL ( R 2 = 0.999) with a retention time of ∼7.5 min.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using Tukey one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) (SPSS, USA), with probability values ( p ) <0.05 considered as statistically significant.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Scanning Electron Microscopy
Changes in particle size, agglomerate structure, and particle morphology of the materials, before and after processing by jet-milling, were investigated to determine the effect of such changes on the uniformity of content and aerosol performance results.
SEM images of the unprocessed lactose revealed its granulated structure, with the presence of various surface cracks and crevices produced from the fusion of smaller subunits of lactose particles (Fig. 1 a). Structural changes on the lactose surface were observed after micronization, from the large granulated structure to a heterogeneous mixture of particles with various shapes and sizes (Fig. 1 b). As the lactose particles were subjected to only one pass through the jet-mill, a mixture of particle sizes was produced from large (>25 μm) to medium (<25 μm) and fine particles (<10 μm). The reduction in the particle size of micronized lactose led to an increase in the particle surface area which increases the number of active sites for the attachment of fine particles (lactose/MGST or BDP) compared to the large unmicronized lactose carrier ( ). Fig. 1 Scanning electron microscopy of a lactose, b jet-milled lactose, c MGST, d jet-milled MGST, e BDP, f jet-milled BDP, g batch 1, h batch 2, i batch 3, j batch 4, k batch 5, l batch 6, m batch 7, n batch 8, and o batch 9
MGST appeared as corrugated, layered structures with no definite shape or size. Jet-milled MSGT appeared as de-agglomerated individual micronized particles (<5 μm) (Fig. 1 c, d, respectively). While an extensive investigation into the chemical and physical properties of MGST was beyond the scope of this manuscript, results from previous research have indicated significant batch to batch variability exists in terms of particle size, surface area, moisture content, and crystalline state ( , , ), which can lead to differences in the lubricant properties of MGST and subsequently cause differences in the flowability and solubility of the final formulation ( , ). Batch variability is likely contributed by differences in the manufacturing conditions (such as temperature and relative humidity) which can lead to the production of commercial grade MGST with varying ratios of the hydrate state ( ), or from differences in the purity of the raw materials used. Therefore, the results presented in this manuscript apply to the batch of MGST as provided by the specific supplier.
BDP was shown to have a flaky/layered particle morphology (Fig. 1 e) which became irregular plate-like and more spherical in shape once micronized (Fig. 1 f).
A mixture of particle sizes and morphologies were observed from the comilled formulations (Fig. 1 g–o). The variation was likely contributed by the lactose particles as it formed the bulk of the comilled formulation, which exhibited significant changes in particle size and morphology after micronization. The larger lactose particles acted as carriers for the attachment of micronized MGST/BDP/lactose particles. Furthermore, agglomerates of fine particles were observed, which was likely the result of inter/intraparticle interactions. Therefore, comilled formulations consisted of a particulate system of (1) fine particles of either BDP/MGST/lactose attached onto the surface of larger lactose particles, and (2) fine particle agglomerates that were either attached or detached from the large lactose particle.
Differences in the agglomerate structure were observed from the comilled formulations with different concentrations of MGST (batches 1–5). In batch 1 (without MGST), a network of large and dense agglomerates of BDP and lactose particles was observed (Fig. 1 g). The agglomerates were either attached on the lactose carrier (>25 μm) or formed multiplets of fine particles detached from the carrier.
Comilling with different concentrations of MGST (batches 2–5) led to the simultaneous micronization and distribution of fine, de-agglomerated particles of MGST that were likely attached onto the surfaces of the micronized BDP and lactose particles. Surface coverage provided a physical barrier which increased the separation distance between the adjacent micronized particles, and was likely to have led to the reduction in the number of inter/intra particulate interactions. This was observed under SEM in the formation of distinct fine particles that were in a loose agglomerate arrangement (Fig. 1 h–j).
The increase in MGST% ( w / w ) from 5 to 7.5% ( w / w ) led to structural changes in the agglomerates, observed under SEM images for the latter formulation as the increase in the number of large, multilayered, dense agglomerates of fine particles (Fig. 1 k). This was likely due to the saturation of the active binding sites on the surface of the larger lactose particle by the increase in the number of fine MGST particles, which likely led to the segregation of micronized particles, and subsequently the formation of dense agglomerates from inter/intraparticle interactions (Fig. 1 k).
SEM images of comilled formulations with different concentrations of BDP (batches 6–9) showed an increase in the size and number of agglomerates was observed as the BDP% ( w /w) was increased from 10 to 40% ( w / w ) (Fig. 1 l–o), likely contributed by the increased number of inter/intraparticulate interactions between BDP particles. Furthermore, changes in the agglomerate structure was observed, from a loose network of interacting particles in the 1 to 10% ( w / w ) BDP formulations, to a dense, compact agglomerate structure in the 20 to 40% BDP ( w / w ) formulations (Fig. 1 l–o), respectively.
Particle Size by Laser Diffraction
For all samples, particle size reduction for inhalation was achieved after micronization of the materials by jet-milling (Fig. 2 a). For example, the D 50 of jet-milled materials were as follows: lactose 5.32 μm ± 0.2, BDP = 1.64 μm ± 0.3, MGST = 2.55 μm ± 0.5, respectively. Fig. 2 Particle size analysis of a lactose, MGST, and BDP before and after jet-milling ( Y -axis log 10 scale); b comilled formulations with different concentration of MGST% ( w / w ) (batches 1–5); and c different concentrations of BDP% ( w / w ) (batches 4, 6–9, respectively) ( n = 3, ± SD)
Particle size analysis of the comilled formulations with different % ( w / w ) of MGST indicate micronization to a size suitable for inhalation was achieved in all formulations (D 50 < 5 μm, Fig. 2 b).
Particle size analysis were consistent with the observations made using SEM, with an increase in the agglomerate size as the BDP concentration in the comilled formulations was increased (Fig. 1 l–o). For example, the particle size distribution of 1% BDP was D 90 < 10 μm of fine particles and a D 50 < 5 μm of micronized particles. However, an increase in the BDP to 40% ( w / w ) led to an increase in D 90 > 10 μm (Fig. 2 c), likely due to the presence of large agglomerates that were formed from the interaction between cohesive BDP particles post-micronization.
Therefore, the concentration of MGST% ( w / w ) and BDP% ( w / w ) was likely to have caused changes in uniformity of content of BDP, which could have introduced variability in the distribution of BDP within the formulation and consequently cause an impact on aerosol performance.
Uniformity of Content of Comilled Sample Blends
Changes in the uniformity of BDP in the comilled formulations was likely to have occurred with changes in the concentration of MGST% ( w / w ) and BDP% ( w / w ), respectively.
Results from the first four batches (0 to 5% MGST w / w ) were within the acceptable pharmacopeia range (not more than one individual sample was outside the limits of 85% to 115% of the average content and none outside the limits of 75 to 125% of the average content) ( ) (Fig. 3 a). This was likely attributed to the jet-milling procedure which led to the simultaneous mix and micronization of the materials that ensured an even distribution of BDP was achieved, either on the surface of larger lactose particles or onto surfaces of micronized particles in the formation of agglomerates. Fig. 3 a Uniformity of content for the comilled (batches 1–5)—effect of MGST% ( w / w ) ( n = 3, ± SD); b uniformity of content for the comilled formulations (batches 4, 6–9, respectively)—effect of BDP% ( w / w ) ( n = 3, ± SD)
The attachment of micronized API onto larger lactose particles has been demonstrated to improve the uniformity of API content in the formulation, as an interactive mixture ensures the uniform distribution of API is achieved by minimizing the number of inter/intraparticulate interactions between micronized particles (<5 μm), which can lead to variability in uniformity of content due to the formation of agglomerates ( , , ).
Failure in uniformity of content was observed with an increase in MGST concentration from 5 to 7.5% ( w / w ), as more than three samples were outside the acceptable pharmacopeia limits (Fig. 3 a). This was likely due to an increase in the surface coverage and ultimately saturation of the lactose active sites from the electrostatic forces of attraction between lactose/MGST particles.
As reported previously, the attraction between two sets of particles is greater, the larger the difference in the magnitude of electrostatic charges between particles ( ). In our case, lactose being electro-negative charged will experience a strong electrostatic attraction with the electro-positive charged MGST. Therefore, the attraction between opposite charged particles (MGST/lactose) likely contributed to the saturation of the binding sites on lactose particles with the increase in MGST concentration, as observed under SEM at 7.5% MGST ( w /w) (Fig. 1 k). The saturation of active sites likely led to the segregation and agglomeration of micronized particles (BDP/lactose/MGST) which contributed to the variability in the uniformity of content of BDP as the MGST concentration was increased to 7.5% ( w / w ).
In addition, previous research by Staniforth et al. ( ) have reported the ability of MGST to dislodge API bound to the surfaces of lactose carriers, which would further increase the segregation of micronized BDP particles and the increase in the formation of cohesive agglomerates. Furthermore, the results are consistent with previous reports of the reduction in the uniformity of content of the API in dry powder formulations with the increase in MGST% ( w / w ) concentration ( ).
The uniformity of content for the batches of powder used to investigate the effect of BDP concentration (Fig. 3 b) showed that the results were generally within the acceptable limits, with failure in uniformity at a content of 40% BDP ( w / w ). This was likely due to the increased formation of large, dense cohesive agglomerates, from the interaction between cohesive BDP particles, as the concentration of BDP was increased in the formulation.
Particle Size Shear Profile
The physicochemical property of the formulation is one of the factors which can have an impact on the aerosol performance. In particular, the rate of powder de-agglomeration and flowability are primarily dependent on the extent of the cohesive/adhesive forces between particles (e.g., Van der Waals, electrostatic, capillary, mechanical interlocking, and friction forces) ( ). Therefore, as micronized particles have a tendency to form highly cohesive agglomerates from inter/intraparticulate interactions, the energy supplied in the form of inspiration must be sufficient to overcome the interactions between particles, as the extent of powder de-agglomeration affects the fraction of the inhaled powder that is within the respirable range ( , ). To determine the extent in the adhesive/cohesive forces of the comilled formulations, particle size shear pressure analysis was performed by subjecting the powder to increasing shear pressure (0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 4 bar) in the powder dispersion unit of the Mastersizer and measuring the particle size (D 50 ) by laser diffraction at each pressure setting.
At the shear pressure setting of 0.5 bar, de-agglomeration of the 1% BDP/99% lactose comilled formulation was not achieved, as indicated by the high particle size result (D 50 = 8.45 μm, Fig. 4 a). The increase in pressure (from 0.5 to 4 bar) provided sufficient energy for further de-agglomeration, as indicated by the reduction in particle size. De-agglomeration was achieved at shear pressure setting of 2 bar (D 50 = 5.02 μm). Fig. 4 Particle size shear pressure analysis of a comilled formulations with different concentrations of MGST% ( w / w ) (batches 1–5) and b comilled formulation with different concentrations of BDP% ( w / w ) (batches 4, 6–9, respectively) ( n = 3, ± SD)
For all comilled formulations containing MGST, de-agglomeration was achieved at a lower shear pressure of approximately 1 bar (Fig. 4 a). The optimal concentration of MGST was 5% ( w / w ), as further increase in MGST concentration was not associated with further reduction in particle size shear pressure profile.
Improvement in powder de-agglomeration with the addition of MGST was likely associated with changes in the agglomerate strength and structure; from dense and cohesive agglomerates in the comilled formulation without MGST compared to the loose agglomerate structure when MGST was included in the comilling process; as observed under SEM (Fig. 1 g–j), and consistent with particle size shear analysis. This was likely due to the mechanical processes involved in the manufacture of the formulations (jet-milling and mixing) that led to the distribution of sheared and delaminated fine particles of MGST adsorbed onto the surfaces of the API and lactose particles which reduced the extend of inter/intraparticulate interactions between micronized particles.
Particle size shear analysis was performed on the comilled formulations with various concentrations of BDP% ( w / w ) (Fig. 4 b). From the results, comilled formulations with a higher concentration of BDP% ( w / w ) (>10%) required a higher shear pressure to achieve powder de-agglomeration. For example, formulations with 1 and 10% BDP ( w / w ) achieved de-agglomeration at 1-bar shear pressure, while an increase in concentration from 20 to 40% BDP ( w / w ) required a shear pressure of 2 bar to achieve de-agglomeration (Fig. 4 b). This suggests that changes in the tensile strength of the agglomerates occurred from an increase in BDP% ( w / w ) concentration in the comilled formulation.
The following equation is used to analyze the changes associated with the tensile strength of an agglomerate ( ): $$ \sigma =\frac{15.6\ {f}^4W\kern0.75em }{d} $$ where σ is the tensile strength of the agglomerate, ϕ is the packing fraction (volume of particles/volume of aggregate), W is the work of adhesion, and d is the particle diameter.
From the equation, formulations with a higher percentage of micronized particles (<5 μm) are likely to form agglomerates with higher tensile strength. Therefore, as the concentration of BDP% ( w / w ) was increased in co-milled formulations, an increase in the tensile strength of the agglomerates would occur, due to the increased interaction between micronized BDP particles. Images from SEM indicated such changes in the structure of the agglomerates occurred; from the loose network of agglomerates observable between 1 to 10% BDP ( w / w ) to the formation of densely packed, cohesive agglomerates with an increase in BDP from 20 to 40% ( w / w ) (Fig. 1 l–o).
Furthermore, an increase in the tensile strength will generally lead to the reduction in powder de-agglomeration efficiency, as a result of the increase in adhesive/cohesive interactions between particles ( ). This was observed in the particle size shear analysis (Fig. 4 b), which indicated the increase in BDP% ( w / w ) (from 20 to 40%) led to a reduction in de-agglomeration efficiency, compared to 1 and 10% BDP ( w / w ), respectively.
The results are consistent with previously reported data where agglomerate structures and aerosol performance of powder mixtures consisting of micronized salbutamol sulfate and lactose in various ratios (1:1 up to 1:8 w / w ) were investigated ( ). At the 1:1 ( w / w ) ratio, SEM imaging revealed agglomerate structures which were compact, in contrast to loose agglomerates in the 1:8 ratio formulation, attributed to an increase in the separation distance between cohesive API particles due to the increase in the concentration of lactose particles. This subsequently resulted in an improvement in aerosol performance in the formulation with a higher concentration of lactose particles ( ). Similar results have also reported by other researchers ( , , , ).
XPS
XPS was used to detect the chemical properties of particles at a depth of approximately 5–10 nm, which represents the outermost surface layer of the particles ( , ). The relative atomic ratio of Mg for pure MGST (100% MGST sample) was consistent with the theoretical value of MGST, which indicate the detection of Mg from the comilled samples were due to the surface coverage by MGST ( ) (Table III ). The elemental composition ratio for comilled 0% MGST was consistent for the theoretical value of lactose ( ), and with the expected result of no detection of Mg from this sample. Table III Surface Elemental Composition of Powder Samples Measured by XPS Sample Relative atomic ratio Element Element O Mg 100% MGST 0.12 0.028 Comilled 0% MGST 0.86 0.0 Comilled 1% MGST 0.63 0.0078 Comilled 2.5% MGST 0.48 0.014 Comilled 5% MGST 0.36 0.020 Comilled 7.5% MGST 0.26 0.024 Comilled 1% BDP 0.36 0.020 Comilled 10% BDP 0.30 0.017 Comilled 20% BDP 0.31 0.015 Comilled 30% BDP 0.28 0.014 Comilled 40% BDP 0.26 0.013 The elemental compositions are listed as the relative atomic ratio to the total carbon concentration (atomic ratios O/C and Mg/C, respectively) MGST magnesium stearate, BDP beclomethasone dipropionate
An increase in the Mg and a decrease in the O ratio, respectively, were observed with the increase in MGST concentration from the co-milled samples (Table III ), which suggest an increase in surface coverage of micronized particles by MGST occurred. The increased surface coverage was likely responsible for the improvement in powder de-agglomeration and in vitro aerosol performance by the reduction in inter/intraparticulate interactions, as reported in this manuscript.
The Mg ratio of comilled 7.5% ( w / w ) sample approached similar value to that of 100% MGST ( w / w ), which suggest that the outer surface of micronized particles were likely extensively coated by MGST (Table III ). This was consistent with the agglomerate structure of the comilled 7.5% MGST ( w / w ) formulation as observed under SEM (Fig. 1 k); agglomerates with multilaminar layers of fine particles were likely formed from the excessive surface coverage of MGST on micronized particles. Additionally, this led to an increase in the surface roughness of coated particles, which was likely to have promoted particle interlocking that caused a reduction in particle de-agglomeration efficiency, and consequently the reduction in aerosol performance as demonstrated from the results in the manuscript and consistent with the result reported previously ( ).
In the second group, comilled formulations with increased concentration of BDP (1 to 40% w / w ) at the set 5% MGST ( w / w ) was produced and analyzed for surface elemental composition by XPS. Generally, the Mg and O ratio decreased with the increase in BDP concentration of the comilled formulations (Table III ). Therefore, the reduction in the extent of surface coating of particles by MGST resulted in the subsequent increase interaction between cohesive micronized BDP particles, and this was likely to have caused the reduction in de-agglomeration efficiency as measured by in vitro aerosol performance and particle size shear analysis.
In Vitro Aerosol Performance—the Effect of MGST% (w/w) and BDP% (w/w) on Aerosol Performance
An aerosol dispersion study was conducted to identify the optimal concentration of MGST (% w / w ) in the delivery of API from comilled formulations. The fill mass, which is the amount of powder weighed (10, 20, 30 mg) into the size 3 HPMC capsule of the RSO1, was investigated as a means to deliver higher doses of the API. Specifically, aerosol performance was evaluated in terms of emitted dose (%), dispersibility (%), and the recovery (%) of BDP from each stage (capsule, device, throat, pre-separator, and filter) as a percentage to the recovered dose.
A general increase in emitted dose was associated with an increase in MGST concentration (Table IV ). The greatest difference in emitted dose (%) performance was observed between 0 and 5% MGST ( w / w ), for example, at 10-mg fill mass, the emitted dose increased from 71.3 to 84.5%, respectively ( p < 0.05). No significant difference was observed between 5 and 7.5% MGST ( w / w ).

Improvement in dose emission was likely due to the surface coverage on the inner surfaces of the capsule and device by MGST during inhalation, which subsequently led to the reduction in the interaction and retention of BDP from the capsule and device.
Differences in the dispersibility (%) between the comilled formulations (Table IV ) were likely due to differences in the de-agglomeration efficiency of the formulations, as reflected in the recovery (%) of BDP from the throat, pre-separator stage, and the fine particle chamber of the FSI (Table IV ). Generally, the addition of MGST reduced the recovery (%) of BDP in the throat and pre-separator, with the greatest reduction observed between 0 and 5% MGST ( w / w ), respectively. Therefore, 5% MGST ( w / w ) was required for the production of highly dispersible comilled formulation, as observed from particle size shear analysis (Fig. 4 a) and in vitro aerosol performance analysis (Table IV ).
An increase in MGST concentration from 5 to 7.5% ( w / w ) resulted in a significant reduction ( p < 0.05) in dispersibility (%) (Table IV ), due to the higher BDP recovery (%) in the throat and pre-separator (Table IV ). This suggest that 5% ( w / w ) of MGST was the optimal concentration in the production of highly dispersible comilled formulation, due to changes in the cohesive-adhesive properties as reported in particle size shear results (Fig. 4 a). Furthermore, the segregation of micronized particles as observed from the uniformity of content (Fig. 3 a) and SEM (Fig. 1 k) likely contributed to the reduction in dispersibility for the 7.5% MGST ( w / w ) formulation (Table IV ). These results are consistent with previous reports of a reduction in dispersibility (%) of the API with an increase in the concentration above the optimal level of the additive material (Leucine) in the dry powder formulation, with a reduction in the respirable fraction of budesonide from 59.1 to 54.9% at 5 and 10% l -leucine ( w / w ) concentration, respectively ( ).
Generally, the concentration of BDP% ( w / w ) had no significant impact on the emitted dose (%) of the comilled formulations (Table V ) at the tested fill mass. However, increase in fill mass had a significant impact on the emitted dose, as discussed in the next section.

A general increase in the BDP recovery (%) from the throat and pre-separator was observed with an increase in BDP % ( w / w ) (Table V ), likely due to the increase in agglomerate strength and reduction in de-agglomeration efficiency as observed from SEM and particle size shear analysis, respectively. This led to the impaction and retention of agglomerates on the inner walls of the throat, and the retention of agglomerates larger than 5 μm in size from the pre-separator during in vitro aerosol performance (Table V ). Consequently, the increased retention of BDP in the throat and pre-separator led to a general reduction in the dispersibility (%).
In Vitro Aerosol Performance—the Effect of Fill Mass
In general, an increase in fill mass from 10 to 30 mg led to significance differences ( p < 0.05) in the emitted dose performance of the formulations. For example, in comilled formulations with higher MGST concentrations (5% MGST ( w / w )), a significant reduction in emitted dose was observed, while at lower MGST concentration (1 and 2.5% ( w / w )), a significant increase in emitted dose was observed between 10- and 30-mg fill mass (Table IV ). This was likely associated with differences in particle release characteristics, such as plume force velocity and powder de-agglomeration efficiency of the formulations, which would require further investigation. Emitted dose of batches 6–9 were in the range of 82.8 to 84.7% at the tested fill mass of 10 to 30 mg (Table V ), and significant reduction was in general observed between 10- and 30-mg fill mass.
In addition to the emitted dose, the increase in fill mass generally caused a significant reduction in the dispersibility of the formulations (batches 1–9) ( p < 0.05) (Tables IV and V). The primary mechanism for powder de-agglomeration of the RSO1 is the spinning/rotation of the capsule during inhalation, and an increase in the capsule fill mass would require higher energy, in the form of a higher inspiratory flow rate, to maintain equivalent capsule rotation for powder dispersion performance relative to that of a lower fill mass, as previously demonstrated by Chew et al. ( ).
Fine Particle Dose of Comilled Formulation—the Effect of MGST and BDP
To determine whether high-dose delivery was achieved, the FPD of each formulation was evaluated. A general increase in FPD was associated with the increase in MGST% ( w / w ); the highest significant difference was observed between 0 and 5% MGST ( w / w ) comilled formulations, respectively ( p < 0.05, Fig. 5 a). A significant ( p < 0.05) reduction in FPD was observed between 5 and 7.5% MGST ( w / w ), at 20- and 30-mg fill mass (Fig. 5 a). Fig. 5 a Effect of MGST% ( w / w )—fine particle dose vs fill mass; b effect of BDP% ( w / w )—fine particle dose vs fill mass
Interestingly, at low fill mass (10 mg), a general increase in FPD was observed with the increase of MGST% ( w / w ), which suggest further improvements in aerosol performance could be achieved at higher concentrations of MGST.
Furthermore, to increase the amount of API delivered to the lung, the capsule fill mass of the DPI was increased by 10-mg increments from 10 to 30 mg. The highest FPD was achieved from the 5% MGST ( w / w ) comilled formulation at each fill mass (Fig. 5 a). This indicate further improvement in aerosol performance could be achieved at higher fill mass with 5% MGST ( w / w ). Although interesting, the investigation of higher fill mass (>30 mg) would likely be associated with dose loading issues and reduction of capsule rotation efficiency during inhalation, which could lead to the reduction in powder de-agglomeration of the formulation and subsequently affect the aerosol performance.
As 5% MGST was identified as the optimal concentration in terms aerosol performance and FPD of BDP, comilled formulations with increased concentration of BDP (from 1 to 40% w / w ) was formulated in an attempt to achieve high-dose delivery (in mg).
Generally, high-dose delivery was achieved in formulations with BDP concentration greater than 20% ( w / w ) at each fill mass, with no significant increase in FPD between 30 and 40% ( w / w ), respectively ( p > 0.05). The highest FPD was achieved from 30% BDP (2.58 mg) at 30-mg fill mass (Fig. 5 b).
Conclusion
Significant ( p < 0.05) improvement in dispersibility and emitted dose was achieved by comilling 1% BDP ( w / w ) with concentrations of MGST from 1 to 7. 5% ( w / w ), with the optimal concentration in terms of aerosol performance and physicochemical properties achieved at 5% MGST ( w / w ). Higher concentrations of MGST (>5% w / w ) led to variability in the uniformity of content of the API, associated with fine particle segregation and the increase in agglomerate strength of the formulation, as observed from SEMs and from particle size shear pressure analysis, respectively. This resulted in a statistical significant reduction ( p < 0.05) in aerosol performance for the co-milled 7.5% MGST compared to 5% MGST ( w / w ) formulations, respectively.
The increase in BDP% ( w / w ) concentration in the comilled formulations at the set MGST concentration of 5% ( w / w ) generally resulted in a significant reduction in dispersibility. This was associated with the increase in agglomeration strength and size as observed by SEMs, and particle size shear pressure analysis. Furthermore, an increase in capsule fill mass of the RSO1 generally led to the reduction in aerosol performance of the formulations, likely due to a higher energy requirement for effective dispersion of the formulation at higher fill mass. The delivery of high dose (in mg) was generally achieved at BDP% ( w / w ) concentration greater than 20% ( w / w ) in the comilled formulations. Therefore, changes associated with the formulation such as the concentration of the API or the additive material in addition to changes associated with the DPI (capsule fill mass) can lead to significant changes in the aerosol performance of the formulation and the energy requirements (inspiratory flow rate) to achieve adequate aerosol performance. This manuscript sought to understand the mechanisms associated with such changes and provide a guide in the design and development of future high-dose dry powder formulations from comilling API with additive material.
