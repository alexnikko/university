Introduction
The efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) followed by radiation therapy (RT) in cervical cancer was assessed in several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) during the first half of the 1990s by comparing with RT alone [ , , , , ]. Some trials showed that eligible patients did not benefit from NAC (or ‘primary chemotherapy’ as it was commonly called) [ , , ], while others showed that NAC detracted from the efficacy of RT alone [ , ]. As no study had shown its clinical merit, discussions regarding NAC followed by locoregional treatment are now rare in gynecologic oncology. However, we wish to spotlight this forgotten strategy, i.e., NAC followed by RT, for four reasons. First, RT following NAC has been successful for some patients with advanced cervical cancer. Second, standard treatment for cervical cancer is very different today than it was when many of these RCTs were conducted, i.e., during the first half of the 1990s, when neither taxane derivatives nor concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) were utilized. Third, some older RCTs had serious flaws. Of the two trials that reported hazardous properties of NAC [ , ], one did not include intention-to-treat analysis [ ], and the other had no standard radiation regimen [ ]. Another trial did not include intracavitary brachytherapy [ ]. Finally, RCTs are a suboptimal test for NAC followed by RT because large general cohorts inevitably include chemo-refractory subjects. For these reasons, we believe that NAC followed by RT deserves reassessment.
Although the most recent review of NAC followed by CCRT concluded that RCTs should clarify the role of this strategy [ ], generalized RCTs are arguably not the optimal format for evaluating NAC followed by RT for cervical cancer. As with molecular-targeted drugs, this strategy is not appropriate for all patients (as shown in the aforementioned RCTs), but could improve outcomes for selected patients. Therefore, we also discuss how to evaluate NAC followed by locoregional treatment. We confined this analysis to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) because adenocarcinoma is considered to generally have low radiosensitivity.
Materials and methods
Patients
A total of 508 patients with invasive cervical SCC were treated at the National Hospital Organization, Hokkaido Cancer Center from January 2000 to December 2013. Information concerning age, disease stage, image analysis, treatment, and follow-up was collected by reviewing their medical records. Of the 87 patients who underwent primary chemotherapy, 82 were subsequently treated with surgical treatment or definitive RT. Complete data were not available for three patients. Finally, we carried out this study with data from 79 patients with cervical SCC who were treated with NAC followed by surgery or by definitive RT (Table 1 ). Table 1 Clinical characteristics of 79 patients with cervical cancer treated with primary chemotherapy followed by locoregional treatment Characteristics No. of patients Age (years), median (range) Median 46 (range 27–76) FIGO stage I 9 (11.4%) II 36 (45.6%) III 22 (27.8%) IV 12 (15.2%) Distant metastasis 8 (10.1%) Maximum tumor diameter, median (range) Median 5.3 cm (range 1.2–12.2) Radiologically PLN enlargement 41 (51.9%) Radiologically PAN enlargement 13 (16.5%) Primary CT Platinum/taxane 33 (41.8%) Platinum/CPT 14 (17.7%) BOMP 16 (20.3%) Platinum (single agent) 15 (18.9%) Other type of CT 1 (1.3%) Response to primary CT CR 2 (2.5%) PR 53 (67.1%) SD 12 (15.2%) PD 12 (15.2%) Locoregional treatment Surgery 49 (62.0%) Radiation therapy CCRT 18 (22.8%) Radiation therapy alone 12 (15.2%) PLN pelvic lymph node, PAN para-aortic lymph node, CT chemotherapy, CPT irinotecan, BOMP combined chemotherapy consisted of bleomycin, vincristine, mitomycin, and cisplatin, CR complete response, PR partial response, SD stable disease, PD progressive disease, CCRT concurrent chemoradiotherapy
Image analysis
All 79 patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography before their initial treatments. The parameters obtained from MRI were tumor size and pelvic lymph node (PLN) size. The parameters obtained from computed tomography were para-aortic lymph node (PAN) size and distant metastasis. Tumor diameter was measured in three dimensions (anteroposterior, craniocaudal, and horizontal diameters) in either T2-weighted images or gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted images, which show tumor lesions more clearly. Maximal tumor diameter was used for the present analysis. Lymph node enlargement was defined as a lymph node >10 mm at its smallest diameter, as determined radiologically, according to published recommended guidelines [ ]. Response to NAC was assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Thus, complete response (CR) was defined as disappearance of all targets and no evidence of new lesions. Partial response (PR) was defined as ≥30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions of all measurable target lesions (reference: baseline sum of the longest dimensions) with no unequivocal progression of non-target lesions and no new lesions. Progressive disease (PD) required at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest target-lesion dimensions, appearance of new lesions, or death due to disease. Stable disease (SD) was any condition not meeting the above criteria.
Treatment 1: primary chemotherapy
All treatments were performed at the discretion of the attending physicians. Our institution has no strict rules regarding indications for NAC, but we generally considered stage ≥IIB disease, tumors >4 cm in size and/or radiological PLN enlargement as unfavorable risk factors. Patients with these unfavorable factors were considered candidates for NAC.
Throughout the study period, NAC regimens varied: (a) BOMP therapy [bleomycin (5 mg/body, days 1–7), vincristine (0.7 mg/m 2 , day 7), mitomycin (7 mg/m 2 , day 7) + cisplatin (10 mg/m 2 , days 1–7) every 4 weeks]; (b) platinum−irinotecan combination chemotherapy (CT) [cisplatin (60 mg/m 2 , day 1) + irinotecan hydrochloride (60 mg/m 2 , days 1, 8, and 15) every 4 weeks]; (c) arterial infusion therapy [CDDP (100 mg/m 2 ) every 2 weeks]; or (d) platinum–taxane combinations [TP therapy—paclitaxel (135 mg/m 2 , day 1) + cisplatin (50 mg/m 2 , day 1) every 3–4 weeks; TC therapy—paclitaxel (180 mg/m 2 , day 1) + carboplatin (AUC = 5, day 1) every 3–4 weeks; DC therapy—docetaxel (60 mg/m 2 , day 1) + carboplatin (AUC = 5, day 1) every 3–4 weeks; DP therapy—docetaxel (60 mg/m 2 , day 1) + cisplatin (50 mg/m 2 , day 1) every 3–4 weeks; TN therapy—paclitaxel (175 mg/m 2 , day 1) + nedaplatin (80 mg/m 2 , day 1) every 3–4 weeks; or DN therapy—docetaxel (70 mg/m 2 , day 1) + nedaplatin (80 mg/m 2 , day 1) every 3–4 weeks]. Patients received 2–4 cycles of NAC.
Treatment 2: definitive locoregional treatment following primary chemotherapy
We compared survival data of patients who received post-NAC surgery with those who received post-NAC definitive RT. Surgeries were radical hysterectomies with pelvic lymphadenectomies. Definitive RT treatments included external beam RT (EBRT) and intracavitary brachytherapy (ICBT). Although our institution has no strict policy for selecting locoregional therapies, we regarded stage ≤IIB disease as resectable (surgery indication) and stage ≥IIIA as unresectable (RT indication).
EBRT was delivered using 10- or 15-MV X-rays from linear accelerators (Clinac 2100C; Varian, Palo Alto, CA, USA). Whole pelvic irradiation was delivered to a total dose of 50–55 Gy in 25–27 fractions over 5.5–6 weeks with a 4-field box or the anterior–posterior technique. Center shield radiotherapy was performed for shorter overall treatment time to reduce organ-risk exposure, depending on tumor shrinkage after 30.8–39.6 Gy had been delivered. Patients underwent ICBT after EBRT. All patients underwent high-dose rate brachytherapy, which was delivered to a total dose of 20 Gy in 4 fractions to point A over 4 weeks with a 192-iridium remote after-loading system (RALS; Microselectron). Point A dose prescription using the Manchester method was performed with the ICBT planning system (Plato; Nucletron). Image-guided optimization was not applicable, even for CT-based ICBT planning. A tandem cylinder was used only in cases with vaginal involvement of more than one-third of total vaginal length or with an extraordinarily narrow vagina.
Survival analysis
The primary outcome measure was disease-specific survival (DSS), defined as the time from the start of the initial treatment to death of cervical carcinoma or death secondary to treatment. Patients who died of other causes were censored at the time of death. Patients known to be alive or lost to follow-up were censored at the time of their last follow-up. Survival rates were estimated by the Kaplan–Meier method. Cox regression analysis was used to select prognostic factors. Seven variables were used for this analysis, and every variable had a binary classification—(1) FIGO stage (I/II vs III/IV), (2) distant metastasis (no vs yes), (3) maximum tumor diameter (<6 vs ≥6 cm), (4) pelvic lymph node enlargement (no vs yes), (5) para-aortic lymph node enlargement (no vs yes), (6) response to primary CT (CR/PR vs SD/PD), and (7) locoregional treatment (surgery vs radiation). Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. The statistical significance level was set at P < 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed with StatView-J 5.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).
Results
Patient clinical and pathological characteristics are shown in Table 1 . Of the 79 patients (median age 46 years), only nine (11.4%) had stage I disease and 70 (88.6%) had stage II–IV disease. Median maximum tumor diameter was 5.3 cm. The most common NAC regimens were platinum–taxane combinations (41.8%). Response rate to NAC was 69.6%. Among subsequent locoregional treatment, 49 (62.0%) patients underwent surgery and 30 (38.0%) underwent RT. Of these 30 patients, 18 (60.0%) underwent CCRT.
Patients in the RT group had more unfavorable prognostic factors (Table 2 ), including significantly higher percentages of advanced disease than in the surgery group ( P < 0.0001), larger maximum tumor diameters ( P = 0.0025), radiological PAN enlargements ( P = 0.025), and patients with insufficient response to NAC ( P = 0.0030). Patients in the surgery group received more subsequent RT ( P = 0.0025) and subsequent CT ( P = 0.0002) than the patients in the RT group.

Among the 55 patients with CR/PR responses to NAC, those who underwent RT had a significantly higher percentage of patients with advanced disease than in the surgery group ( P < 0.0001) (Table 3 ). The surgery group received more subsequent RT ( P = 0.091) and subsequent CT ( P = 0.0065) than the RT group.

Figure 1 shows the Kaplan–Meier DSS curve of the entire cohort and the DSS curves by locoregional treatment. The median follow-up period was 54 months overall, and 76 months for patients who did not die of their disease. Five-year DSS rates were 66.4% for the entire cohort, 77.4% for the surgery group, and 48% for the radiation group (log-rank test, P = 0.0022). Fig. 1 a Univariate Kaplan–Meier survival plot to estimate disease-specific survival in 79 patients with cervical squamous cell carcinoma who were treated with primary chemotherapy followed by locoregional treatment. b Kaplan–Meier analysis showed significant differences in disease-specific survival rates between the surgery and radiation groups (5-year survival rates 77.4 vs 48.0%; log-rank test, P = 0.0022)
Multivariate analysis (Cox regression analysis, n = 79) confirmed that tumor diameter ≥6 cm, PLN enlargement, and insufficient response to NAC were significantly related to poor outcomes (Table 4 ). Selection of RT was not an independent unfavorable prognostic factor.

Figure 2 shows Kaplan–Meier DSS curves by response to NAC. In the subgroup of patients with insufficient responses (SD/PD) to NAC, the 5-year DSS rate of the surgery group was significantly higher than the RT group (55.6 vs 20.0%; P = 0.044, log-rank test; Fig. 2 a). Interestingly, in the subgroup of patients with CR/PR responses to NAC, 5-year DSS rates did not differ significantly between the surgery and RT groups (82.3 vs 78.6%; P = 0.79, log-rank test; Fig. 2 b), even though the RT group had many more unfavorable prognostic factors and received fewer subsequent treatments than the surgery group. Fig. 2 a Kaplan–Meier analysis for the stable/progressive disease subgroup showed significant differences in disease-specific survival rates between the surgery and radiation groups (5-year survival rates 55.6 vs 20.0%; log-rank test, P = 0.044). b In the complete/partial response subgroup, there were no differences in disease-specific survival rates between the surgery and radiation groups (5-year survival rates 82.3 vs 78.6%; log-rank test, P = 0.79)
We had no cases of treatment-related death. Three patients (all with stage IV disease and chemo-resistant tumors) died within 6 months after initiation of treatment. Although they received RT following NAC, all died of progressive disease. Four patients (5.1%) had adverse events due to NAC, which put them into an insufficient status to tolerate locoregional treatment 6 weeks after NAC (Table 5 ). One patient had anaphylaxis shock due to paclitaxel despite it having no great effect on the treatment schedule. Data regarding complications associated with locoregional treatment were collected from 49 survivors (Table 6 ). Short-term grade 3/4 complications, which included intraoperative organ injury (ureter, bladder), severe ileus, femoral nerve paralysis, and symptomatic lymphocyst were observed in eight patients (22%) in the surgery group, while no short-term grade 3/4 complications were observed in the radiation group ( P = 0.17). Overall, long-term grade 3/4 complications were observed in five patients (10.2%)—three (8%) in the surgery group and two (17%) in the radiation group ( P = 0.58). Of the three patients with long-term grade 3/4 complications in the surgery group, two underwent surgical treatment and subsequent RT because they were considered to have extremely high-risk prognoses after surgery. The two patients with long-term grade 3/4 colitis in the RT group received CCRT.

Discussion
As described in the ‘ Introduction ’, RCTs that showed NAC followed by RT to be inefficacious for cervical cancer were conducted decades ago, after which discussion of this regimen essentially disappeared. However, RCT conclusions might not reflect individual variations in outcome. A notable point of this study is shown in Fig. 2 b. For chemo-sensitive patients, RT was not inferior to surgery in terms of survival. In other words, NAC did not detract from the efficacy of RT for chemo-sensitive cancers. In addition, for chemo-sensitive cancers, RT was a less-invasive substitute for surgery without compromising outcome. As this point is not widely noted, many physicians hesitate to subject patients to RT following NAC—a viewpoint that might interfere with the development of next-generation strategies. CCRT is regarded as the standard treatment for locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC), including stage Ib2–IVa disease. However, approximately one-third of eligible patients in previous studies died of LACC, despite receiving CCRT [ , , , ]. Some cases of LACC cannot be effectively treated by CCRT alone, and overcoming this seemingly intractable disease has been very challenging. CCRT with higher peak concentrations of cisplatin [ ], surgery following CCRT [ , ], adjuvant CT following CCRT [ , ], and CCRT following neoadjuvant CT [ ] are strategies expected to enhance the efficacy of CCRT. The last strategy might improve survival in some patients with advanced cervical cancer, and is now being assessed by an ongoing RCT (the INTERLACE trial). However, we are concerned that it might not be appropriately evaluated.
We hope to raise evaluation methods for NAC as an issue. NAC is a challenging strategy with a high adverse effect profile. We expect it could be efficacious for patients with less optimistic prognoses, who are unlikely to be best served by standard treatments. Instead, treatments with better antineoplastic effects may be better suited to their greater physical burden. However, NAC might not be well-assessed within the framework of RCT. First, more invasive treatments or those with high adverse effect profiles tend not to show favorable results in RCTs because such profiles hamper its survival-improving effect. Second, more importantly, NAC tends to be unfairly evaluated within the RCT framework because, although NAC should not be expected to work on chemo-resistant disease, generalized cohorts inevitably include some chemo-refractory subjects, who are presumed to account for 30–40% of the total. Thus, this challenging strategy is inevitably disadvantaged in competition. In our opinion, NAC followed by RT should not be dismissed according to the results of past RCTs and cannot be fairly assessed by RCTs. Although RCTs are suitable for determining standard treatments for low- and intermediate-risk cancers, they are not the best format for evaluating NAC. A more relevant model might be testing for molecular-targeting agents, which are strategically similar to NAC in that both should be used for selectively improving outcomes for specific patient groups rather than improving the average outcomes for a larger group of patients with more general disease characteristics.
The toxicity of NAC followed by locoregional treatment is also worth discussion. No significant difference in short- and long-term grade 3/4 complications was observed between the surgery and radiation groups. In the surgery group, no grade 3 neurogenic bladder was observed; however, the occurrence of short-term and persistent grade 2 neurogenic bladder was observed in 92 and 35% of patients, respectively. In summary, radical surgery may be a more invasive treatment than RT in light of neurogenic bladder occurrence. However, long-term grade 3/4 colitis was observed in 17% of patients who underwent NAC followed by RT. Whether RT could be a less-invasive substitute for radical surgery requires further investigation.
Of course, our study has some limitations. First, the number of patients included in the study was too small to power conclusive results. Second, as a retrospective, single-institution study, this investigation presumably had selection biases; its main argument is based on a result from a subgroup analysis in a single cohort, from which a lower evidence level could be attributed. Third, NAC regimens were not standardized, and patients in this study underwent various regimens. Fourth, toxicity of NAC was not sufficiently investigated and discussed. However, we did not intend to discuss the possibility of NAC becoming a standard treatment equivalent to CCRT because its clinical relevance is still inconclusive. As previously mentioned, we feel that NAC has not been fairly evaluated within the framework of comparative clinical studies. Additionally, NAC followed by RT is problematic to re-evaluate and discuss because it was less effective among earlier RCTs. With few physicians implementing this forgotten strategy, and many possibly considering it to be contraindicated, its use is uncommon in clinical settings and its efficacy is difficult to evaluate within a framework of high-quality clinical studies. Although we cannot prove advantages of NAC over CCRT based on previous evidence, we feel that the negative views of NAC in this setting should be reconsidered, and the use of NAC, even if followed by RT, should not be prohibited.
In conclusion, NAC followed by RT could be a less invasive substitute for surgery, with non-inferior outcomes in selected patients. Its applicability for selected patients, i.e., those with advanced chemo-sensitive disease, warrants investigation. Assessments of NAC might use an alternative method to randomized phase III trials, similar to those used for molecular-targeting agents.
