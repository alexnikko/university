Introduction
The Haemosporida comprise a group of cosmopolitan parasitic protozoa that infect mammals, birds, amphibians, and reptiles (Garnham ; Valkiūnas ). These vector-borne parasites undergo a complex life cycle with its sporogony (sexual stages followed by meiosis) in hematophagous dipterans, completing their asexual or schizogony (haploid stages) and dimorphic gametogony in their vertebrate hosts (Garnham ; Valkiūnas ; Telford ). Despite the extensive use of molecular methods, morphology remains the standard for the diagnosis and delimitation of species (Valkiūnas ; Telford ). However, morphological intraspecific variability is still a problem. Parasite morphology varies during infection even in the same host species (Lainson et al. ). Furthermore, there is increasing recognition of the importance of the so called cryptic species in parasitic organism (Nadler and De León ). Therefore, many researchers agree that the diagnosis from morphological features has serious limitations (Falk et al. ; Pacheco et al. ) giving rise to the determination of synonymous species, uncertain species or ambiguous designations (Perkins ; Outlaw and Ricklefs ). Nevertheless, since morphology remains the standard (Lainson et al. ; Telford ), there is a need for characterizing intraspecific variability.
Plasmodiidae is the most studied family within the Haemosporida, since it includes the etiological agents of human malaria (Garnham ; Valkiūnas ). There are at least 100 recognized species that are parasites of reptiles; these species have been described based on morphological characters (Garnham ; Telford ). Garnham ( ) proposed three subgenera within the family Plasmodiidae to classify the 23 known species in lizards up to that moment: Sauramoeba for parasites with large erythrocytic meronts, Carinamoeba for those with very small erythrocytic meronts, and the subgenus Ophidiella for a Plasmodium species found in snakes. Later, Telford (1988) proposed seven subgenera for Plasmodium species infecting reptiles : Sauramoeba , Carinamoeba , Paraplasmodium , Asiamoeba , Lacertamoeba , Garnia , and Ophidiella. This proposal is not free of controversy. Garnia is sometimes considered as a separate family, Garniidae, with three genera ( Garnia , Fallisia , and Progarnia ) due to the fact that these parasites do not produce hemozoin, and Fallisia parasites are only present in thrombocytes or leukocytes (Lainson et al. , ; Valkiūnas ). In the case of Plasmodium in Neotropical lizards, there are at least 24 described species (Telford ) and they have been mainly studied in Brazil, México, and the Lesser Antilles. Only a few studies have been carried out in Colombia. One of these studies reported the presence of Plasmodium floridense in Anolis concolor Cope, 1862 in the San Andrés and Providencia Islands and Plasmodium colombiense infecting A. auratus Daudin, 1802 in the valley of Rio Cauca (Ayala ; Ayala and Spain ). Although Ayala ( ) refers to the presence of another six Plasmodium species of reptiles in several colombian localities, there is no publication associated with those data.
The integration of morphological and molecular criteria to define species is emerging as a consensus in modern systematic parasitology (Nadler and De León ). Since its introduction in molecular phylogenetic studies, genes from the parasites’ mitochondria have strengthened the description of species (Escalante et al. ; Perkins and Schall ; Ricklefs et al. ; Bensch et al. ). Indeed, the use of mitochondria has meant a significant increase in the knowledge of the genetic diversity, the discovery of new host-parasite-vector relationships, and a formal assessment of these parasites’ phylogenetic relationships (Escalante et al. ; Perkins and Schall ; Ricklefs et al. ; Sehgal et al. ; Martinsen et al. ; Pacheco et al. ). The use of molecular methods has allowed the characterization of cryptic and complex species such as the case of Plasmodium azurophilum and Plasmodium leucocytica , initially described as a single species because of shared morphological characters (Telford ). However, a separation of their molecular lineages was possible, supported by the type of host cell present in each population (Perkins ; Telford ).
The present study aimed to document the presence of Plasmodium spp. in reptiles in the northern part of the Colombian Amazon region, re-describe the species found, and determine the association of molecular lineages with morphological Plasmodium species.
Materials and methods
Study area
Reptiles were collected in the Guaviare department-Colombia in five localities between 200 and 500 m altitude with an average annual temperature of 25–30 °C (Fig. 1 ; Online Resource 1 ). This region represents a transition between the ecosystems of the eastern plains and the Amazonian forest and includes a variety of forests, natural savannas and rocky outcrops (Escobar ).

Cerro Azul; Ciudad de Piedra; Playa Güio; Puentes Naturales; Puerta de Orión
Samples
A total of 31 individuals belonging to 22 species (Table 1 ) were captured and sacrificed with 2% lidocaine. Subsequently, a blood sample was taken from the portal vein and three slides were made, which were fixed with methanol for 5 min and stained with 10% Giemsa pH 7.2 for 45 min. Blood samples preserved in SET buffer (0.05 M Tris, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.5 M EDTA pH 8.0) were further stored for molecular analyses. Samples were kept at room temperature in the field and then cooled to − 20 °C in the laboratory. The specimens were collected under a permit granted by the “ Corporación para el Desarrollo Sostenible del Norte y Oriente Amazónico-CDA ” (CDA Resolution No. DSGV-112, October 25, 2012).

Microscopic analyses
Blood slides were examined using a Leica DM750e microscope (Leica Microsystems, Heerbrugg, Switzerland), at × 400 for 10 min and then at × 1000 for 20 min, and the slides with parasites were examined in their entirety for the capture of digital images, using a Leica EC3 digital camera and processed with the LAS EZ (Leica Microsystems Suiza Limited ). Morphometric analysis was performed using ImageJ software (Schneider et al. ), and intensity of infection was estimated from erythrocyte counts with an increase of × 1000, focusing on areas where blood cells formed a monolayer (No. of parasites/10,000 erythrocytes) (Staats and Schall ). The taxonomical determination of blood parasites was made comparing their morphologies with reptilian Plasmodiid species reported in Lainson et al. ( ), Ayala and Spain ( ), Lainson et al. ( ), Telford ( ), Lainson et al. ( ), and Lainson ( ).
Detection of haemosporidian parasites by polymerase chain reaction
Total genomic DNA was extracted from blood using QIAamp® DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). Each DNA sample was screened for haemosporidian parasites by using a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) that targets the mitochondrial cytochrome b ( cyt b ) gene in the parasite using the protocol described in Pacheco et al. ( ). In addition to the cyt b gene sequences obtained in this study (Genbank accession numbers MF177707-MF177709), partial mitochondrial genomes were also obtained for these parasites and published elsewhere (KY653753, KY653755, and KY653796 Pacheco et al. ). However, for the purpose of this research, only the cyt b sequences obtained during the screening were analyzed, so we can compare with the data available from other studies. All sequences included in our analyses are listed in Online Resource 2 .
Phylogenetic analysis of the cyt b fragment
Three independent nucleotide alignments were performed by using the MUSCLE algorithm (Edgar ) implemented in SeaView4 (Gouy et al. ). The first alignment (500 bp. excluding gaps) was constructed with a total of 74 cyt b sequences of parasite species from lizards, birds, and mammals (ungulates, rodent, and primates) belonging to the genera Leucocytozoon , Haemoproteus , Haemocystidium , and Plasmodium . For the second alignment (981 bp. excluding gaps), the short sequences of two lizard parasites P. zonuriae and P. intabazwe and the two sequences of ungulate Plasmodium were excluded. The third alignment (981 bp excluding gaps) was performed using only sequences of parasite species from lizards and birds. All sequences were translated into protein, and no amino acid insertion or deletion was found. Phylogenetic hypotheses were estimated by using Bayesian Inference as implemented in MrBayes version 3.2.6 (Ronquist and Huelsenbeck ). The phylogenies were estimated using a General Time-Reversible model with gamma-distributed substitution rates and a proportion of invariable sites (GTR + Γ + I), which was the model that better fit the data with the lowest corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) scores as estimated by jModeltest 2.1.3 (Darriba et al. ). Two independent runs of 6 × 10 6 generations were conducted with four chains, sampling every 500 generations in order to avoid auto-correlation. The chains were assumed to have converged once the average standard deviation of the posterior probability was below 0.01 and the value of the potential scale reduction factor (PSRF) was between 1.00 and 1.02 (Drummond et al. ) In total, 25% of the trees were discarded as a burn-in step.
Results
Plasmodium spp. were encountered in four of the 31 (12.9%) samples examined and evaluated both by microscopic and molecular tools. Infections were reported in lizards belonging to the families Teiidae ( n = 2/3), Dactyloidae ( n = 1/5) and Tropiduridae ( n = 1/2) (Table 1 ; Online Resource 1 ). Despite Garnham ( ) and Telford reporting only the subgenus Ophidiella for Plasmodium infecting snakes, in the samples we analyzed here, we found no parasites similar to Ophidiella . Snakes were infected by Hepatozoon spp. that were not the subject of this study.

This parasite was first described in Kentropyx calcarata (Spix, 1825) from northern Brazil; here it was found infecting the lizard Cnemidophorus cf. gramivagus Mccrystal & Dixon, 1987 (Squamata: Teiidae). Gametocytes and meronts were found infecting both mature and immature erythrocytes. However, no trophozoites were observed. The host cell nucleus was displaced towards the periphery (Fig. 2 a–f), and also a notorious hypertrophy was observed (Table 2 , Fig. 2 c). The sex ratio (macro/microgametocytes) was 5:3. Double infections in the same erythrocyte were observed (Fig. 2 a). In the original description, such sex ratio was 4:1.
Meronts contain between 12 and 50 merozoites (Fig. 2 a–c). Mature meronts tend to occupy almost all the erythrocytes, displacing the nucleus of the host cell towards the poles and occasionally adhering to the nucleus. Immature meronts are in a lateral position and seem to grow and surround the nucleus; even in mature stages, the nucleus has the appearance of being overlapped. Pigment granules are condensed into a single point clumping in a cytoplasmic vacuole that has a mean diameter of 1.5 μm. All the abovementioned features are shared with the original description (Lainson et al. ). It is important to mention that the Plasmodium kentropyxi reported here has a greater number of merozoites than in the original description (Table 2 ).
Gametocytes were elongated as a band with rounded ends (Fig. 2 d–f) and the pigment granules were small and scattered and located in the cytoplasm. Sixty percent of the macrogametocytes (Fig. 2 e) showed at least one vacuole < 1.1 μm in diameter. However, they were not as conspicuous as described by Lainson et al. ( ), where the vacuole size was 2–3 μm in diameter. Young macrogametocytes were located in the polar zone of the host cell and mature ones laterally and they did not attach to the nucleus. In immature stages of gametocytes, the vacuole was not evident (Fig. 2 d). It is important to mention that macrogametocytes’ nucleus was not as obvious as usual in another Plasmodium species (Fig. 2 e). This feature contrasts with the original description where the classical blue color of macrogametocytes was reported. Microgametocytes had a configuration similar to macrogametocytes with the pink coloration of the male (Fig. 2 f) having a diffuse nucleus and pigment granules distributed randomly in the cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm, these were observed until three small vacuoles (Fig. 2 f), similar to the original description of the vacuoles, are located towards one edge of the parasite.

Remarks:
Plasmodium kentropyxi shares morphological characteristics with P. diploglossi (11–58 merozoites), P. guayannense (40–74 merozoites), P. achiotense (36–56 merozoites) and P. cnemidophori (42–127 merozoites), all of these are classified in the same subgenus Sauramoeba . The main differential characteristics of Plasmodium kentropyxi are large meronts producing hypertrophy in the host cell and completely displacing the host cell nucleus. Moreover, the pigment granules are condensed in masses, and the parasite also has conspicuous vacuole(s) of variable size located at one end of the gametocytes. In comparison with P. diploglossi , that develops elongated meronts that encircle the host nucleus (Telford ), P. kentropyxi forms oval and roundish meronts that do not encircle the nucleus. In contrast, gametocytes of P. guayannense and P. achiotense are roundish, differing from the elongated band-like gametocytes formed by P. kentropyxi. Plasmodium kentropyxi is also similar to P. cnemidophori, because their meronts cause hypertrophy and distortion of host cell and nucleus, as well as the displacement of the nucleus; moreover, some morphometric features of the taxa overlap. However, P. cnemidophori may infect proerythrocytes (Telford ) and produces on average more merozoites by meront, being 42–127 (Telford ), while the average in P. kentropyxi is 12–50. Compared to P. pifanoi reported in Venezuela, it also has a conspicuous vacuole although there is a marked difference in the number of merozoites by meront. This latter species has only 7–16 merozoites, so this feature defines it as a species of the subgenus Paraplasmodium (Telford and Telford III, ).
Plasmodium (Carinamoeba) carmelinoi (Lainson et al. 2010)
This taxon was found infecting the type host Ameiva ameiva Linnaeus, 1758; (Squamata: Teiidae). Parasites were found infecting only mature erythrocytes located in a polar position in the host cell, and multiple infections were found in a single erythrocyte (data not shown).
Trophozoites were the most commonly found parasitic form (46% of the parasitic forms counted). They have cytoplasm that adopts a teardrop shape changing to oval or amoeboid when they grow. Dark browinish-black pigment granules tend to cluster over a conspicuous vacuole (Fig. 2 g). That vacuole increases in size as trophozoites develop. It is located at the center of the parasite and displaces the parasite cytoplasm towards the periphery.
Meronts are mainly roundish and contain 6–10 small merozoites that do not adhere to the erythrocyte nucleus, thus, classifying this species in the subgenus Carinamoeba . Meronts have a large vacuole that pushes the merozoites towards the periphery, giving a diadem appearance (Fig. 2 h–k; Table 2 ). Overall, the disposition and color of the pigment granules is similar to those described by Lainson et al. ( ); they are dark brownish-black pigment usually concentrating inside the vacuole (Fig. 2 j). Only two out of 19 meronts observed show a different organization (Fig. 2 k). In those cases, the pigment granules are more condensed, and the vacuole occupy less space in the parasitic cytoplasm and have a variable distribution of merozoites.
Gametocytes were observed at low frequency, limiting their characterization. The vacuole found in trophozoites and meronts was also observed in gametocytes with an oval shape and with a distal position in the cytoplasm of the parasite, also containing pigment granules (Fig. 2 l) but smaller than in meronts. This characteristic was also observed by Lainson et al. ( ). Due to the low number of gametocytes observed, it was not possible to determine the sex ratio; however, in the original description, this macro/microgametocyte ratio was 2.2:1.
Taxonomic status
Host type: Ameiva ameiva Linnaeus, 1758 (Lainson et al. ).
Parasite distribution: Pará in the Brazilian Amazon region, the state of Pará (01° 12′ N, 47° 11′ W). The new locality is the department of Guaviare in the northern Colombian Amazon (02° 27′ 56.9″ N, 72° 42′ 29.1″ W).

DNA sequence: partial cyt b gene: MF177709; partial mtDNA: KY653755 (Pacheco et al. ).
Site of infection: mature erythrocytes.
Intensity of infection was 0.15%.
Remarks:
Differential diagnosis of this parasite should be made with P. attenuatum (4–8 merozoites), P . diminutivum (4–6 merozoites), P. vacuolatum (8–20-merozoites), and P. attenuatum that are found infecting the same host in Guyana and Venezuela. These species differ from P . carmelinoi due to the presence of elongated gametocytes and rosette or fan-shaped meronts. In comparison with P . diminutivum (reported also in the same host in Panama), both parasite species have roundish gametocytes. However, P . diminutivum has meronts without the characteristic vacuole. Plasmodium carmelinoi and P. vacuolatum (Lainson et al. ) are very similar in size and both possess a prominent vacuole; they can be distinguished because P . carmelinoi has meronts with crown-shaped merozoites arranged around the vacuole. Meronts and gametocytes of P . carmelinoi are mainly round, while in P. vacuolatum , they have the form of a bean. Finally, P . carmelinoi has an amoeboid form in the trophozoites stages (the main form found here), while P . vacuolatum does not.
Plasmodium sp.
This morphotype was found in the lizard Anolis auratus Daudin, 1802.
Trophozoites were observed in mature erythrocytes with a pigment granule with size > 2 μm; they are rounded and located variably in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2 m).
Meronts were oval or irregular in shape and had 2–12 merozoites irregularly arranged or in a fan shape. Pigment granules were clumped in a golden mass that was located in the peripherical zone (Fig. 2 n–o). Eighty-one percent of the meronts were immature.
Gametocytes are oval in form and are polar in the erythrocyte; their size always is smaller than the host nucleus; the pigment granule arrangement is variable and dispersed in the cytoplasm or located in masses (Fig. 2 p). Vacuoles when present have a variable size.

The topologies of the three estimated phylogenies using the partial cyt b sequences (500 and 981 bp. excluding gaps) were consistent for many clades; however, some discrepancies can be observed (Figs. 3 and 4 , Online Resource 3 ). Some phylogenetic relationships changed depending on the sequence length, but many of those clades were not supported due to their low posterior probabilities. Overall, the genera Haemocystidium and Plasmodium were monophyletic groups sharing a common ancestor with Haemoproteus ( Parahaemoproteus ) species. However, Plasmodium species of lizards were not monophyletic. Indeed, depending on the tree, rodent and primate Plasmodium species shared a common ancestor with P. agamae and P. giganteum (Fig. 3 ) or P. mexicanum and P. chiricahua (Online Resource 3 ). In addition, P. zonuriae and P. intabazwe also group with some bird Plasmodium parasites (Fig. 3 ). Although these results may suggest host switches between lizards-birds and lizards-mammals, the low posterior probabilities in some of those clades indicate that a more robust phylogeny (e.g., multiple nuclear loci or complete mtDNA) is needed before reaching conclusions; however, such comprenhensive data is not yet available for reptile parasites.

Genetic distances on the cytb between all lizards Plasmodium species are shown in Online Resource 4 . The genetic distances obtained in this study indicated that all of the divergences are consistent with different species. In the case of the three lineages reported here, P. kentropyxi and P. carmelinoi always grouped together and shared a common ancestor with P. azurophilum and P. fairchildi (Figs. 3 and 4 , Online Resource 3 , and Online Resource 4 ), parasites that infect several species of lizard (genus Anolis ) from the Caribbean islands (Telford ). The lineage Plasmodium ( Lacertamoeba ) sp. found in this study and P . ( Lacertamoeba ) floridense belong to a different clade, sharing a common ancestor with P . ( Lacertamoeba ) hispaniolae (posterior probability = 1.0; Figs. 3 and 4 , Online Resource 3 ). Interestingly, all three parasites are from the Neotropics and belong to the subgenus Lacertamoeba . However, they were not monophyletic with other African P . ( Lacertamoeba ) species (e.g., P. agamae ). Indeed, given the phylogenies estimated in this study, none of the subgenera were monophyletic groups.
Discussion
Most Plasmodium species described thus far are found infecting birds and reptiles (Valkiūnas ; Telford ). However, we are just starting to assess their diversity. Classical studies focused solely on morphological descriptions with limited information on the variation of the characters used or their capacity to distinguish species in a broad range of hosts (Falk et al. ; Pacheco et al. ). In addition, there are only a few morphotypes of those species associated with suitable molecular information that facilitates their identification. In the context of malarial parasites, the introduction of mitochondrial genes in phylogenetic investigations in the late 90s (Escalante et al. ) lead to extensive data on the cyt b that has the potential to be used for barcoding (Outlaw and Ricklefs ). This proposal gained support in a recent study with well-characterized species where it was concluded that cyt b correctly separated the species in a sampling with more than 100 species of haesmosporidia parasites (Pacheco et al. ). However, the taxonomic sampling linking parasite species from birds and reptiles with molecular lineages is still a work in progress. Paucity of data is particularly staggering in saurian malarias (see Pacheco et al. where only 6 complete mitochondrial genomes have been published). Only 20 out of the at least 100 morphological species of Plasmodium infecting reptiles have a cyt b molecular lineage associated (including this study). Here, we report three Plasmodium species, belonging to three of the seven subgenera reported in reptiles. Based on their morphology, we identify those species as P . ( Sauramoeba ) kentropyxi , P . ( Carinamoeba ) camelinoi , and P . ( Lacertamoeba ) sp. Given the limited taxonomic sampling, we observed no noticeable differences with the phylogenetic relationships found by Perkins and Austin ( ) and Falk et al. ( ) here. In contrast, Pacheco et al. found Plasmodium of reptiles as part of a monophyletic clade. Such difference could be explained, at least in part, by the scarce number mtDNA genomes available from these reptile parasites when compared to species with cyt b data. Considering that only 20 species out of a hundred described have molecular data, it is evident that we need more studies in order to understand the evolution of these parasites. In particular, it is pressing to link morphological and molecular data as is being done with avian parasites.
It is worth mentioning that our phylogenetic analyses, using partial cyt b sequences, do not support the taxonomic conclusions of the subgenera classification. e.g., although P. ( Sauramoeba ) kentropyxi and P. ( Carinamoeba ) carmelinoi appear as a sister taxa, they belong to different subgenera (Figs. 3 and 4 ). Similar results have been found in Plasmodium subgenera of birds (Martinsen et al. ; Pacheco et al. ).
Although the geographic distribution of the host species for Plasmodium kentropyxi and P . carmelinoi overlaps in the northern part of South America, this report added new hosts and localities for these parasite species. These species shared a common ancestor with P . azurophilum and P . fairchildi , both species from the Caribbean Island (Ayala and Hertz ; Telford ). However, the taxonomic sampling is still too limited for further speculation on other patterns. Nevertheless, the four species in this clade have different morphological features, and overall, there is no correspondence between morphological traits and the actual phylogenetic relationships found in our analyses (Figs. 3 and 4 ). Although the number of parasites analyzed in our samples was fewer than those evaluated in original descriptions, we found parasites with a greater number of merozoites (Table 2 ). Lainson et al. found a minimum effect of meronts on the host cell; this is different from our samples where the erythrocytes infected were considerable larger than uninfected ones (Table 2 ), probably because of their greater number of merozoites.
The lineage Plasmodium ( Lacertamoeba ) sp. found here infecting Plica cf. plica has morphological features shared with P. floridense (4–32 merozoites), P. hispananiolae (4–8 merozoites), P. vacuolatum (8–20 merozoites), and P. colombiense (4–14 merozoites) . In the phylogenetic analyses, Plasmodium ( L. ) sp. was grouped with P . ( L .) floridense , a species reported in North America, Central America, and the Caribbean Islands, as well as in Colombia in northern South America (Telford ). Indeed, P. floridense and their different subspecies are very similar to Plasmodium ( L .) sp., mainly because of their rosette-shaped meronts and the ovoid to elongated forms of their gametocytes. However, the specimen found in this study showed smaller size than those reported for P. floridense . In addition, Plasmodium ( L .) sp. and P . floridense shared a common ancestor with Plasmodium hispaniolae (Figs. 3 and 4 ), which is also distributed in the Caribbean. Morphological characteristics of this parasite are quite similar to P. floridense ; however, one difference between these two species is that P. hispaniolae has mature gametocytes often with irregular and ragged cell margins. But the great majority of morphometric measurements overlap with P. floridense (Falk et al. ) . Plasmodium ( L .) sp. is also morphologically very similar to P. hispaniolae , mainly because of the oval shape of gametocytes with vacuole, shape, and organization of their meronts. However, Plasmodium ( L .) sp. meronts and gametocytes are smaller than that reported for P. ( L .) hispaniolae and this could be an effect of the host, as has been reported in the Plasmodium of birds (Mantilla et al. ).
Plasmodium ( L. ) sp. also has morphological characteristics similar to P. ( L. ) vacuolatum found in lizards from South America, but the vacuoles observed in our samples are not as conspicuous as the original description of P. vacuolatum (Lainson et al. ). Unfortunately, there is no cyt b sequence available for P. vacuolatum that allows us to confirm a close phylogenetic relationship with Plasmodium ( L .) sp. Finally, another species morphologically similar to Plasmodium ( L .) sp. that has been reported for Colombia is P. ( L. ) colombiense . Both species share the shape of gametocytes and the presence of vacuoles (less conspicuous in P . colombiense ), but the distribution of pigment granules and size of gametocytes differs between them (Ayala and Spain ).
In this study, the host Plica cf. plica infected with Plasmodium ( L. ) sp. also was infected with a morphotype associated with the hemogregarina identified as Schellackia cf. sp. (Bonorris and Ball ) (data not shown). Lizards of the genus Plica (Tropiduridae) are characterized by having a scansorial habit usually found in forests, on vertical rocks and on trunks, and with a wide distribution towards the east of the Andes (Murphy and Jowers ). These lizards have frequently been reported infested by a large variety of mites (Gomides et al. ) that could be vectors (Bonorris and Ball ), so these characteristics may explain the mixed infection found here.
The parasite found in Anolis auratus has a very particular arrangement of meronts, but due to the low intensity of infection and the lack of a cyt b sequence, we only attempt to identify it as Plasmodium sp. Overall, this parasite has small meronts and the size of the gametocytes is similar to those described for parasites of the subgenus ( Carinamoeba ). However, several stages have measurements that overlap with sizes described for Lacertamoeba parasites (Table 2 ), and for that reason, we were not able to assign a definite subgenus. Interesting Anolis is a common genus infected by saurian malaria, e.g., the six malaria species described in the Caribbean Islands infect anoles ( Anolis spp.) (Falk et al. ). Additionally, anoles also have been found infected by P . balli , P . marginatum , and P . colombiense among others (Ayala and Hertz ; Perkins ). Ameiva ameiva is also a common host of a great variety of hemoparasites, including other Plasmodium species, Hemolivia and Garnia (Lainson et al. , ). It is a conspicuous lizard of the Teiidae family that has one of the widest geographic distribution among New World lizards, occurring from Panamá, Caribbean Island to Brazil (Avila-Pires ); this species occurs in a great array of ecosystems, but apparently, it has an affinity for open microhabitats (Vitt and Colli ).
In relation to the impact of infection by Plasmodium spp. in reptiles, there are contrasting results; some authors consider them to be non-pathogenic (Brown et al. ; Stacy et al. ; Xuereb et al. ). However, negative effects have also been reported such as reduced fertility, limited feeding, reduced body mass, effects on liver and kidneys, anemia and variation in leukocyte parameters, possibly increasing susceptibility to secondary infections and predation, among other effects (Schall ; Vardo-Zalik and Schall ; Motz et al. ). We did not follow the reptiles for a long period, so we have no data on this topic.
There are important gaps in our knowledge of blood parasites that infect wild species. Specifically, in reptiles, our understanding is fragmentary, where the great majority of species only have morphological characteristics and almost certainly the species diversity in reptiles is underestimated, as it has been reported for avian hemoparasites. Although PCR amplification is more sensible than microscopic analyses, those essays have not been properly standardized in many parasite species. Indeed, we were able to detect a parasite identified as Plasmodium sp. (Fig. 2 n–t) only by microscopy, despite also testing a different set of primers (e.g., Hellgren et al. ; Waldenström et al., ) and variations in the protocols with a gradient of Tm (data not shown). Our results provide support to Garnham’s ( ) statements regarding the limits of morphological characteristics in saurian parasites: their number of merozoites is unstable, and the size of the parasite may depend on the host; for those reasons, it is not easily assigned a species or even a subgenera group. Additional information concerning the biology of the parasites, their hosts, and their ecological relationships is necessary for an adequate approximation in the hemoparasite species determination in reptiles.
Knowing adequate baseline information about which parasites and which hosts’ species are in an ecosystem allow the characterization of trophic relationships and knowledge of possible reservoirs of potential pathogens, elements that make a difference in the design of appropriate conservation programs. Lizards like Ameiva ameiva or Anolis spp. would expand to new habitats and with them their parasites. As more forested habitats will be converted into pasturelands contact of naïve hosts with new parasites could cause a loss in biodiversity, as has occurred in avian malaria (van Riper III et al. ; Alley et al. ).
