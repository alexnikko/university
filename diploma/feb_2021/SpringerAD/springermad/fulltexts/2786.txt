Background
Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are a heterogeneous group of tumours with varying histology, site and grade and constitute just 1 % of all malignancies [ ], which may be the reason for a variable clinico-pathologic profile and ambiguity in the best use and sequencing of the treatment options available. With limb salvage surgery and radiation therapy as the mainstay of treatment, acceptable local recurrence rates have been achieved with an optimal functional outcome. However, distant metastasis and subsequent sarcoma-related death have not shown consistent reduction over the past two decades [ , , ]. While there have been many advances in systemic chemotherapy in general, they have not been equally successful in treatment of soft tissue sarcoma.
The controversial role of adjuvant chemotherapy in soft tissue sarcoma, since its introduction [ ], has motivated numerous workers to recognize select group of patients, likely to benefit the most from adjuvant chemotherapy [ , ]. Similarly, studies on neoadjuvant therapy in STS gained momentum, but inconsistent results have led to a search for the high-risk groups [ , , ]. Thus, the role of multimodality therapy and sequencing of its components remains an area of contention in the management of soft tissue sarcoma.
In the context of developing countries, revisiting the prognostic factors becomes important before recommending treatment to our patients, as the clinical profile (and hence the impact of various prognostic factors) may be different from western population. As the availability of data on prognostic factors in Indian patients with soft tissue sarcoma is scarce [ , ], we were prompted to perform a retrospective analysis of the clinico-pathologic profile and the prognostic factors in patients undergoing surgery for STS at a tertiary cancer centre in India.
Methods
We retrospectively analysed the data of all the patients who underwent surgical treatment for STS of extremity or trunk (excluding intra-abdominal/intra-thoracic sarcomas) at our institute from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2013. Clinical data was collected using HIS Vista ®. A total of 133 patients were identified, out of which 12 patients with round cell histology and 9 patients having a follow-up less than 1 year were excluded from the study. The remaining 112 patients were included in the study.
Asymptomatic mass with or without pain was the initial presentation in patients presenting primarily. Two-fifth patients presented after unplanned excision done outside with unknown margins or suspicion of residual disease. Thirteen patients were operated for local recurrence after primary surgery at other cancer centres (all these were patients operated by other specialised surgical oncology teams with credible histopathology and imaging reports available). One patient each with breast cancer, acute leukemia and chronic lymphoid leukemia was seen to have soft tissue sarcoma during surveillance. The clinical details were collected from case records and are outlined in Table 1 . Table 1 Clinical details Clinical details No. of patients ( N = 112) Clinical presentation Primary 54 Secondary Post excision (outside) 45 Recurrence a 13 Tissue diagnosis Tru cut Bx (at our institute) 47 Review of outside slides Trucut Bx 11 Incisional Bx 9 Excision Bx 45 Staging workup 112 Local imaging (MRI or CT) CECT chest Surgery Wide local excision 112 Lymph node dissection 9 Reconstruction 38 Adjuvant radiotherapy EBRT 80 Interstitial brachytherapy 7 Chemotherapy Adjuvant 33 Neoadjuvant 5 Palliative 2 a For patients presenting with local recurrence ( n = 13), first surgery performed elsewhere was considered as index surgery and its date was considered as starting point for calculating survival
Tumour variables were collected from histopathology reports, including histologic subtype, grade based on French Federation Nationale des Centres de Lutte Contre le Cancer (FNCLCC) system, size (classified both as < or >5 cm and < or >10 cm in maximum dimension), depth, margin (microscopic involvement of cut surface considered positive/negative) and nodal status [ ]. In 29 patients operated for residual disease or after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, primary size was not known, and these were labelled Tx.
Follow-up included clinical evaluation, ultrasonography/MRI of local site (if deemed necessary) and non-contrast CT chest, every 3 months for 2 years and every 6 months thereafter. Follow-up of patients was supplemented by telephonic conversation wherever required. Local or distant recurrence and survival as on December 31, 2014 or last follow-up was noted. Overall survival (OS) was calculated from the date of diagnosis to the date of last follow-up or death due to any cause. Event-free survival (EFS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) were calculated from the date of diagnosis to the date of first event and distant metastasis respectively or to the date of last follow-up. Demographic factors, tumour factors and treatment factors were analysed for their effect on all the above-mentioned survivals.
Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS version 22 (IBM). Survival curves and univariate analysis were obtained using Kaplan-Meir method and log rank (Mantel-Cox) test. Multivariate analysis was done for significant factors using Cox regression analysis. Significance was set at P value <0.05.
Results
The study included 112 patients with the histological distribution as described in Table 2 [ ]. The details of demographic, tumour and treatment-related factors and their impact on survival are summarised in Tables 3 and 4 . Wide local excision including the biopsy site or scar of previous surgery was performed in all patients with microscopically negative margins in all but six patients (planned positive in two patients). Synovial sarcoma and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma were the most common histologic subtypes, equally prevalent in trunk and extremities. Histopathologically positive lymph nodes were seen in three patients with epithelioid sarcoma (1), DFSP with dedifferentiation into high grade STS (1) and alveolar soft part sarcoma (1).

All patients underwent a wide excision except eight patients who underwent amputation for extremity sarcomas (two above knee amputation, two below knee amputation, one ray amputation, one hip disarticulation, one knee disarticulation and one shoulder disarticulation). Five out of these underwent amputation for local recurrence and the other three as a primary procedure. Out of the 36 local recurrences, 5 patients underwent amputation, 20 patients underwent a wide excision and the remaining were treated with best supportive care. Reconstruction was done in 38 patients using skin graft/bone graft/local fasciocutaneous flaps/randomised or pedicled myocutaneous flap or free flap. Wound-related morbidity was seen in 21.2 % of the patients, which was higher in patients requiring reconstruction (28.9 vs 17.3 %, P = ns) and was not increased in patients undergoing secondary surgery after neoadjuvant therapy or previous unplanned excision. Most of the wound complications were minor and were managed with dressings, while five patients required secondary flaps and one required amputation subsequently.
Out of 88 patients (77.8 %) receiving radiotherapy, more than half received 40–60 Gy, while almost equal numbers of the remaining received less than or more than the mentioned range. Ifosfamide + adriamycin was the primary chemotherapy regimen in neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting and gemcitabine + docetaxel followed by pazopanib was given to 2 patients with progressive disease. At final follow-up (mean of 44.85 ± 4.64 months, 95 % confidence interval = 35.66–54.04), OS was 82.1 % and EFS was 49.1 %. During the same time period, distant metastasis was seen in 30.1 % of the patients. On further analysis, the actuarial 5-year DMFS, EFS and OS were projected to be 59.9, 42.1 and 73.1 % respectively.
Overall Survival
Of the various patient and tumour factors evaluated for their relation with survival using univariate analysis, younger age (<50 years), larger size (>10 cm) (Fig. 1 ) and histopathologically positive lymph nodes were the only factors found significant. All these factors remained significant on multivariate analysis also. At final follow-up, 82.1 % patients were alive. Though overall survival was poor in some rare histologies like angiosarcoma and alveolar soft part sarcoma, histology did not significantly alter overall survival. Fig. 1 Impact of size >10 cm on OS and DMFS. For patients operated for local recurrence ( n = 13), first surgery was considered as index surgery and its date was considered as starting point for calculating survival
Distant Metastasis-Free Survival
Synovial sarcoma, epithelioid sarcoma and rare histologies like angiosarcoma and alveolar soft part sarcoma were the most common histologies seen in patients having distant metastasis. Pulmonary metastasis was the most common site of distant metastasis and was managed with palliative chemotherapy and best supportive care. Nine patients had metastasis in extra-pulmonary sites, identified in bone, brain, jejunum, liver and pancreas. The histologic subtypes seen in these patients were undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma ( n = 4), synovial sarcoma ( n = 3), MPNST ( n = 1) and fibrosarcoma ( n = 1). Jejunal and pancreatic metastasis were resected, patient with brain metastasis received radiotherapy and others received palliative chemotherapy. On univariate analysis, tumours which were grade 3, deep, or more than 10 cm were found to have significantly shorter distant metastasis-free survival. Positive margins and pathologically positive lymph nodes also showed higher number of distant metastasis ( P < 0.5). Size >10 cm (Fig. 1 ) and pathologically positive lymph nodes were the only factors found significant on multivariate analysis.
Event-Free Survival
Statistically more events were seen in tumours, which were deep, >10 cm, grade 2 or 3, had positive margins, or had pathologically positive lymph nodes. While other factors got nullified, depth and pathologically positive lymph nodes remained significant on multivariate analysis.
Discussion
The treatment of soft tissue sarcoma in Indian patients in our study showed an actuarial 5-year DMFS, EFS and OS of 59.9, 42.1 and 73.1 % respectively, an inferior survival outcome as compared to western literature [ , , ]. Besides, an analysis of clinical profile in the present study shows that only 13, 21 and 11.5 % of tumours were low grade, <5 cm and superficial respectively. On multivariate analysis, size >10 cm and histopathologically proven lymphadenopathy had the most profound impact on DMFS and OS. The clinical profile and prognosis of soft tissue sarcoma have been shown to have ethnic variation [ ], and it is imperative that we analyse the outcome of treatment including the impact of the established prognostic indicators in Indian patients.
On comparing the clinical profile in our study with that of other studies in developing countries and the western world, we realised that most of the patients with localised STS in our population will be placed in a higher stage as per the AJCC 2010 staging system (more than half of the patients were grade 3 and more than 5 cm and around 90 % were deep) [ , ]. This has two implications. Firstly, it may explain the survival outcomes of our study, which appear to be poorer than that in western studies but are not inferior to those when the stage is matched [ , ]. Secondly, a large part of our population will be in a high risk group which lacks consensus regarding the role of adjuvant chemotherapy [ , , , ]. As adjuvant chemotherapy shows variable results even when used selectively in high grade or stage III patients, a clarity on the indications of adjuvant chemotherapy is all the more important for our patients.
We did not find any significant difference in the oncological outcome among the more common histopathological varieties. Other Indian series show synovial sarcoma and MFH/UPS as the commonest histopathological variety, as was seen in our patients [ ]. Grade is another widely accepted prognostic factor for soft tissue sarcomas [ ]. We found low-grade tumours to have lower recurrence rate, but with no impact on distant metastasis and overall survivals. At the same time, deep tumours were also found to have a profound oncological impact, a fact reiterated by most other studies [ , , ].
Margins have been considered a very important prognostic indicator in a patient with a soft tissue sarcoma [ ]. While we had a significantly better DMFS and EFS in patients with a microscopically negative margin, margins had no effect on oncological outcome on multivariate analysis. This may be explained by the fact that even the patients having a positive margin were those with larger size, recurrence, or other poor prognostic factors and were not many. However, other workers [ , ] have shown that at a specialised centre, a “planned positive margin” in order to preserve the function or form or to reduce the morbidity does not result in a poorer survival.
Ours is a tertiary care cancer centre, and a large majority of patients presented to us secondarily after having undergone a “whoops” procedure (46 patients), at a non-specialised centre. A history of a prior intervention in a soft tissue sarcoma is a common entity seen in both the developed and developing countries, however with a higher frequency in the latter [ , , , ]. It is significant that the OS, EFS and DMFS remained the same for patients undergoing primary surgery and surgery after whoops procedures. This finding endorses the outcome of many other studies [ ], barring a few [ ] and reiterates the general consensus that the outcome of a whoops procedure is no worse provided the patient is referred in time to a specialised centre.
Histopathologically proven lymphadenopathy, a rare observation in soft tissue sarcomas (3.7 %) [ ], was shifted from stage IV to stage III in AJCC seventh edition as survival was better than systemic metastasis. However, all three (2.7 %) of our patients having positive nodes developed distant metastasis and succumbed to the disease. On the other hand, adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy showed no statistically significant difference in EFS or OS in our series. This is explained by the fact that decision on adjuvant treatment was made by a multidisciplinary board, based on the established indications, and was offered only to select high risk group patients.
The soft tissue sarcomas which are high grade, deep and more than 5 cm in size have been reported to have poor prognosis consistently and thus form the basis of the present staging system [ , , ]. A third of our patients had a tumour size more than 10 cm, reflecting a delay in referral and healthcare seeking behaviour of our patients as compared to western population [ , ]. It was interesting to note that in our study, a cutoff of 10 cm tumour size showed a significant difference in oncological outcome (on both univariate and multivariate analysis) while that of 5 cm did not do so. Furthermore, it was seen that patients in the subgroup with tumour size more than 10 cm had a tendency for a lesser chance of distant metastasis if they received adjuvant chemotherapy ( P = 0.052).
Tumour size more than 10 cm is not included in the current AJCC staging system. However, literature supports further tumour size based stratification. Ramanthan et al. observed a progressive decline in survival with increase in tumour size, within each histological grade. As the AJCC system did not correlate with prognosis, they formulated modified staging system with multiple size stratification (T1, T2, T3, T4 = <5, 5–10, 10–15, >15 cm) which correlated well with the survivals [ ]. Another study depicted increase in distant metastasis with tumour size, i.e. 34, 43 and 58 % for <5 cm, 5–10, 10–15 cm [ ]. Few recent studies show size >10 cm to be an independent adverse prognostic factor, especially when the survivals were improved with limb salvage surgery and radiotherapy [ , ]. Another study, which failed to show survival benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy to persist beyond 1 year in stage III patients (high grade, deep, size >5 cm), did show poor prognosis in patients with size >15 cm [ ]. Similarly, recent studies showing feasibility and survival benefit of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (size >10 cm) [ ] and neoadjuvant chemoradiation (size >8 cm), [ , , , ] use large tumour size to define high risk groups. All this leads us to believe that that tumour size subgrouping beyond 5 cm is important to define high risk groups and support our results seen with tumour size more than 10 cm.
The recommendation of chemotherapy for larger tumours is based on the premise that larger tumours will be biologically more aggressive and hence more likely to benefit from chemotherapy. However, tumour size is function of another factor besides biological aggressiveness- that is delay in presentation. We hypothesise that a patient with a given aggressiveness of tumour in a developing country is more likely to have a larger tumour size as compared to developed world, because of a delayed presentation. This may be a reason for the 10 cm cutoff affecting survival in our patients (meaning that the more aggressive varieties will present with a size of not 5 but 10 cm), and we recommend this cutoff for patients in a developing/resource poor setting for prognostication and, more importantly, for deciding on indication and sequencing for chemotherapy.
With the availability of only a few studies on Indian patients [ , ], our study assumes significance by being one of the larger studies from a tertiary cancer centre in India, focussing on the impact of prognostic factors with modern treatment. The differences thus seen may be subtle but need a mention as they may have a potential to aid in management. However, we have to admit that our study has certain limitations. It was a retrospective analysis and included only patients who were operated upon (and hence, had an inherently better prognosis than patients who might have been treated non-operatively/with palliative intent). Moreover, these were patients presenting to a tertiary cancer centre in a large metropolitan city, which may not be catering to the real cross section of the society. We need longer follow-up and larger multicentric trials in Indian patients to analyse outcome specific to our population and to validate the outcome of this study.
Conclusions
Soft tissue sarcomas in Indian patients have a different clinical profile and outcome compared to those in western literature. It may be worthwhile revisiting the established prognostic indicators before using them in our patients, which may have a different impact on our patients as compared to those reported in world literature.
