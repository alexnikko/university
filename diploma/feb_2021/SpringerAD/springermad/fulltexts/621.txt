Introduction
Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF) is the most common cyanotic congenital heart disease, consisting of the following abnormalities: (1) ventricular septal defect, (2) overriding aorta, (3) obstruction of the right ventricle outflow, and (4) right ventricular hypertrophy. Surgical treatment in childhood yields an increasing number of patients with ToF reaching adult age, with excellent long-term survival [ ]. However, several long-term sequelae of ToF repair have been reported, including impaired cardiac autonomic [ , ] and vascular function [ , ]. Resting heart rate variability (HRV) and heart rate recovery (HRR) after exercise testing are the two most used measures of cardiac autonomic function, and validated prognostic predictors of mortality in healthy individuals and several cardiovascular entities [ , , ]. While in healthy subjects and patients with cardiovascular diseases HRV and HRR are interrelated [ , , ], evidence on such association in adults after ToF repair is lacking. On the other hand, arterial stiffness has emerged as an important indicator of subclinical impairment of vascular function [ ]. Stiffer carotid arteries might contribute to impaired activation of the baroreceptors situated around bifurcation of the common carotid artery and thus might lead to impaired cardiac autonomic control [ , , ], thus providing a pathophysiologic rationale for cardiac autonomic and peripheral vascular function to be interrelated in adults after ToF repair.
In the present study, we sought to assess possible interrelationships between resting HRV, post-exercise HRR and carotid artery stiffness in patients with repaired ToF as compared to healthy adults. Thus, we tested the hypotheses that (1) carotid stiffness is associated with HRR and HRV parameters in patients with repaired ToF, and that (2) the strength of correlation is different between adults after ToF repair and age-matched healthy controls (reflecting different pathophysiologic derangements).
Methods
Study design and subjects
This case-control study was carried out at the Department of Vascular Diseases, Division of Internal Medicine, University Medical Centre Ljubljana, Slovenia. Twenty-five adults with repaired ToF were recruited from the Outpatient clinic for adults with congenital heart diseases at the Department of Cardiology, Division of Internal Medicine, University Medical Centre Ljubljana, Slovenia. Ten age-matched healthy controls were also included.
All patients with repaired ToF had a complete correction of the defect during childhood and were at the time of data acquisition in the clinical class I according to New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification. Exclusion criteria included known or symptomatic atherosclerotic disease, unstable cardiovascular disease or recent (<3 months prior to inclusion) cardiovascular events, acute illness or recent (<3 months prior to inclusion) non-cardiovascular diseases requiring hospital, emergency or unplanned specialist management, pregnancy, unstable arrhythmias, chronic atrial fibrilation, permanent pacing and intellectual development disorder. This study was approved by the National Medical Ethics Committee. It has been performed in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments. Written consent was obtained from all participants prior to their inclusion in the study.
Heart rate variability
HRV recordings were performed between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m. They were lying in the supine position for at least 10 min before measurements. Recordings were performed in a quiet room, with all electronic devices and lights turned off. Resting 5-minute-long high-resolution ECG recordings were acquired using a 500-Hz dedicated recording device (Cardiax ® , IMED, Budapest, Hungary) with no filter applied. ECG data were analyzed using a dedicated software package (Kubios v. 2.2, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland). After correction of premature beats and artifacts, HRV time and frequency domain parameters were calculated. Frequency domain parameters were obtained using autoregressive model order 16, without factorization.
Selected time-domain parameters were used [ ]: SDNN, standard deviation (SD) of all normal RR (NN) intervals; rMSSD, square root of the mean of the sum of squares of successive N–N interval difference, reflects vagal modulation; pNN50%, percentage of successive NN intervals differing by >50 ms, reflects vagal function.
Selected frequency domain parameters were used [ , ]: HFnu, power in the high-frequency range (0.15–0.4 Hz), obtained with an autoregressive method using the following formula: HFnu = total power−low frequency power−very low frequency power; LFnu, power in the low-frequency range (0.04–0.15 Hz), obtained with autoregressive method using the following formula: LFnu = total power−high frequency power−very low frequency power.
Carotid artery stiffness
Measurements of carotid artery stiffness parameters [ β stiffness coefficient and pulse wave velocity (PWV)] were performed after HRV measurement. An Aloka Prosound α7 ultrasound machine was used, with dedicated echo tracking used to determine carotid stiffness parameters through the analysis of the pulse waves. Measurements were performed on the right common carotid artery (RCCA). Patients had their head elevated at around 45° and 30° tilted to the left. After visualization of the RCCA of around 2 cm before the bifurcation, the cursor pair was positioned on the anterior and posterior walls of the artery. The software, which is an integral part of the device and calibrated on the basis of systolic and diastolic blood pressure values, analyzed the RCCA’s diameter change waveforms and automatically calculated β stiffness coefficient and PWV [ ]. Calibration of the blood pressure was performed twice, during which six beats were made/taken. Therefore, the β coefficient and PWV were calculated as means of 12 beats.
Heart rate recovery
Maximal graded exercise testing followed two previous measurements. It was carried out in a laboratory room between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. using a cycle ergometer Schiller CS-200. Standardized exercise testing protocol consisted of gradual increase in workload by one tenth of maximal estimated workload per minute (on the basis of age and gender). Peak workload was then obtained, together with peak heart rate. After termination of the exercise testing, patients remained seated on the cycle ergometer and heart rate was continuously measured in the following 4 min. HRR parameters were calculated with the following formulas:
HRR X = HR peak −HR in the X th minute after termination of the exercise testing.
in which X had values from 1 to 4 (HRR 1 , HRR 2 , HRR 3 and HRR 4 ).
Sample size calculation and statistical analysis
Sample size was assessed using an SD of the independent variable ( β stiffness coefficient) as 2.2 [ ] and of the dependent variable (HRR) as 10 beats [ ]. As the ratio between these two values was around 4, minimal detectable difference (change in the dependent variable per unit change in the independent variable) was estimated to be 4 or less. We have performed calculations with minimal detectable difference as 3. Therefore, to detect a true difference of 3 beats in HRR for each 1 unit difference in β stiffness coefficient, sample size calculation suggested at least 21 patients should be included with a 0.05 two-sided significance level and a power of 0.80.
Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS version 20. To assess if the distribution of a variable is normal, eyeballing for normality was confirmed with the Shapiro–Wilk test. Data were presented as mean and SD for normally distributed variables, and median and interquartile range (Q1–Q3) for non-normally distributed variables. An independent samples t -test/Mann–Whitney U was used to determine differences of normally/non-normally distributed variables, respectively. Differences between categorical variables were checked with Chi-square tests. Associations between two variables were assessed with Spearman’s correlation coefficient. Multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to determine parameters with strongest associations with HRR. A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

We have additionally included 10 healthy controls; 6 of them were males, and the mean age was 39 years.

As shown in Table 1 , there was a significant difference between groups in terms of SDNN, a parameter of HRV (32.8 vs. 46.8, p = 0.012) and HRR 2 (43.4 vs. 55.2, p = 0.028). There was a trend towards significance in differences between groups in terms of HRR 3 and HRR 4 (52.8 vs. 63.4, p = 0.081 and 57.6 vs. 69.0, p = 0.076, respectively). There were no significant differences between groups in terms of parameters of carotid arterial stiffness, namely β stiffness coefficient and PWV (6.07 vs. 5.96, p = 0.843 and 5.52 vs. 5.37, p = 0.576, respectively).
Association between HRR parameters and parameters of arterial stiffness increased from HRR 1 to HRR 4 (Fig. 1 b). As shown on Fig. 1 b, β stiffness coefficient was significantly associated with HRR 2 ( r = −0.404, p = 0.045), HRR 3 ( r = −0.546, p = 0.005) and HRR 4 ( r = −0.546, p = 0.005) in patients with repaired ToF. Additionally, we have conducted a multivariate linear regression analyses with HRR 2 , HRR 3 and HRR 4 as dependent variables, and age, gender, resting heart rate, β -blockers use and β stiffness coefficient as independent variables (Table 2 ). According to our results, β stiffness coefficient was an independent predictor of HRR 3 , while regression power of β stiffness coefficient to predict HRR 4 was borderline significant ( p = 0.05). Female gender was an independent predictor of HRR 3 , while resting heart rate, β -blocker use and age were not (Table 2 ). Comparing two groups of patients with repaired ToF, those who had undergone single and those who had undergone multiple heart surgery procedures, there were no significant differences in terms of β stiffness coefficient ( p = 0.725) and PWV ( p = 0.375).

Correlation between two entities of cardiac autonomic function, namely HRR and HRV, was further assessed. HRR 1 was not significantly correlated with any of the HRV parameters. Association between HRR parameters and time domain parameters of HRV increased from HRR 1 to HRR 4 , similarly as in the previous paragraph, in patients with repaired ToF (Fig. 1 a). HRR 4 (Fig. 2 a) and HRR 3 were also associated with a frequency domain parameter of HRV, i.e. HFnu ( r = 0.513; p = 0.009 and r = 0.442, p = 0.027, respectively). Associations between carotid artery stiffness and HRV parameters were also determined. PWV, as a parameter of carotid artery stiffness, was significantly associated with SDNN ( r = −0.417; p = 0.038), rMSSD ( r = −0.515; p = 0.008), pNN50% ( r = −0.465; p = 0.019) and HFnu ( r = −0.467; p = 0.019) in patients with repaired ToF (Fig. 2 b).

Discussion
In the present study, we confirmed an association between cardiac autonomic dysfunction and arterial stiffness in adults with repaired ToF. Although previous studies have reported interrelationships between HRV and artery stiffness [ ], this is the first study to report on HRR in repaired ToF and its relationship with other cardiac autonomic function parameters as well as vascular function determined by carotid artery stiffness.
Our findings suggest that cardiac autonomic function (HRR and HRV), but not arterial stiffness, is impaired in adults with ToF as compared to healthy controls. While reduced HRV in patients with repaired ToF has already been reported [ , ], our results provide novel insight into a reduced HRR in patients with repaired ToF compared to healthy peers. As for vascular function, our finding of comparable carotid stiffness between adults after ToF repair and healthy controls may be explained by the older age of our study population (mean age 38 years), as most previous studies included younger patients (mean age 15–21 years) [ , , ]. It is possible that, over time, increased arterial stiffness in patients after ToF repair equalizes to that of apparently healthy controls, as both ToF and healthy individuals are subject to vascular ageing and cardiovascular risk factors. Increased survival of this population only now reaching middle-age permits appreciation of such processes that may ultimately be unrelated to the congenital heart condition itself [ ].
Despite comparable vascular function, adults after ToF repair—but not controls—had a significant association between HRR and arterial stiffness. Moreover, HRR was associated with arterial stiffness irrespective of age, gender, resting heart rate and β -blockers use. HRR is a marker of cardiovascular prognosis in both healthy individuals and patients with cardiovascular disease, and reflects autonomic nervous system conditioning [ , ]. Also, HRR is affected by both structural and functional vascular changes, explained in a study of Janic et al. [ ]. On the one hand, structural interactions may arise from impaired HRR due to degenerative and atherosclerotic vascular disease [ ]. On the other hand, correlation between HRR and endothelial dysfunction suggests a possible association between a functional vascular component and HRR [ ]. Decreased physical activity level, often seen in adults with congenital heart disease [ ], may further unfavorably affect both HRR and arterial stiffness.
Of interest, only later phases of HRR (namely, 2 or more minutes post-exercise)—but not HRR 1 —were associated with carotid artery stiffness parameters in patients with repaired ToF. Although most studies on HRR focused on the recovery in the first minute after exercise, there are a few literature reports in which both early and late HRR have been examined [ , ]. Additionally, different implications of exercise physiology can be appreciated with a comprehensive analysis of HRR beyond the first minute. After exercise, HRR in the first 30 s to 1 min is predominantly driven by parasympathetic reactivation (early phase with rapid decline), whereas in the subsequent 2 or more minutes (late phase with slow decline), sympathetic withdrawal in addition to parasympathetic reactivation sets in as a pivotal determinant of heart rate decline [ ]. Vascular function is determined by a complex interplay between both sympathetic and parasympathetic activity, and vascular dysfunction is associated with vegetative derangements such as sympathetic hyperactivity [ ]; thus, HRR 2 -HRR 4 (reflecting such vegetative derangements) may indeed be more strongly associated with vascular function than HRR 1 , as suggested by our findings.
As expected, HRR was also associated with other parameters of cardiac autonomic function, i.e. HRV in patients with repaired ToF. To our knowledge, this is the first study in adults with congenital heart disease in which association between these two parameters was assessed. In literature, associations between HRR and HRV remain controversial in cardiovascular patients [ , , ]. Failure to detect an association between HRV and HRR in some of these studies may be explained by two differential aspects of cardiac parasympathetic function—namely, that HRR mainly reflects parasympathetic tone, while HRV is a marker of parasympathetic modulation [ ]. As suggested in a study of Buchheit et al., these two aspects might depend on physical activity levels, but in a different way. Higher physical activity performance leads to reaching a plateau of HRV parameters (“saturation” effect), while HRR parameters are further increased [ ]. This “saturation” effect of HRV parameters—but not of HRR parameters—may explain the lack of association between HRR and HRV in some studies. Adults with congenital heart disease tend to be less physically active [ ] and less engaged to sports [ ]; thus, the “saturation” effect of HRV may not be reached and the association between HRV and HRR may, therefore, be retained, which is in line with our findings. On the contrary, Piotrowicz et al. [ ] reported on improvements of HRV parameters—and not in HRR—in patients with chronic heart failure after a physical training program, providing opposite results as in a study of Buchheit et al. [ ]. These controversial results in different cardiovascular conditions ask for further prospective analyses on influence of exercise training on both aspects of cardiac parasympathetic function in a growing population of adults with repaired ToF.
As for the association between HRV and arterial stiffness in patients with repaired ToF, our findings corroborate previous observations; association has only been demonstrated for carotid artery distensibility, another parameter of carotid artery stiffness [ ]. In our study, carotid artery stiffness parameters were inversely related with indicators of vagal modulation (rMSSD, pNN50 and HFnu) in patients with repaired ToF. Possible explanations for this association include direct mechanistic sequelae of open-heart cardiac surgery [ , ] as well as indirect non-cardiac issues associated with lifestyle of adults after ToF repair (e.g. lack of physical activity [ ]). A causative association between arterial stiffness and HRV impairment pathogenesis should also be taken into account—stiffer carotid arteries affect afferent stimuli from the heart to the brain via carotid sinus baroreceptors [ ], which could result in deranged autonomic modulation of the heart rate (represented by HRV).
Our study has a few limitations. Firstly, it has a relatively small sample size. As sample size was primarily calculated to detect a possible association between HRR and β stiffness coefficient, the study may have been underpowered to detect weaker associations and is, therefore, subject to limitations that are inherent to studies of patients with similarly rare conditions. Secondly, the control group consisted of age- and gender-matched controls, but was unadjusted for other differences that may have influenced our results. Thirdly, this was a case-control study and can only answer the question of association, not causality.
In conclusion, autonomic cardiac function is impaired in patients with repaired ToF, and independently associated with vascular function in adults after ToF repair, but not in age-matched healthy controls.
With results from the present study, we are able to better understand vascular and autonomic cardiac function in a novel population of patients with repaired ToF entering middle age. However, there are still challenges to better understand pathophysiological derangements between these two entities, to determine predictive values of arterial stiffness and autonomic cardiac function parameters in adults with congenital heart disease, and to introduce interventions in order to improve them, such as exercise training programs. Larger (multi-center) studies are needed to address these issues, while our findings, nonetheless, provide novel insight into the association between cardiac autonomic activity and vascular function in the growing population of patients with ToF surviving into adulthood.
