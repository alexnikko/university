Introduction
The overweight and obesity epidemic challenges health care systems worldwide [ ], and both conditions are known to increase cardiovascular and cancer risk factors [ , ]. However, weight loss is helpful for controlling hypertension as well as the metabolic and inflammatory effects of obesity [ , ]. Nevertheless, most therapeutic approaches do not lead to sustained weight loss for all participants, even in well-established multiprofessional programs [ ]. For example, lifestyle interventions, including caloric restriction and increased physical activity, could be first-line therapy for weight loss. However, lifestyle changes are occasionally difficult to achieve and maintain in adults [ , ]. Similar to in adults, changing the lifestyle of adolescents is also difficult. As a result, pharmacologic treatment may improve weight control and would encourage both adolescents and adults to continue weight loss programs. However, the efficacy of pharmacologic intervention in controlling childhood obesity is still controversial. As a result, metformin is of interest as a potential choice for an effective and safe drug for weight loss.
Metformin as a multifunctional drug [ , , ], which is the first line of therapy for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, recently received attention for its potential to assist adolescents and adults control their weight [ ]. In addition, its mechanism of action is complex, promoting sugar dysplasia restrains and reducing inhibition caused by insulin-induced expression of the glucose transporter protein, thus increasing glucose utilization [ ]. It has been shown that metformin is relatively effective in reducing body weight and improving insulin sensitivity in adults, and it is one of the drugs used to treat adolescents who are overweight or obese and unresponsive to changes in lifestyle or who present with insulin resistance [ , ]. Nonetheless, the most suitable dosage and intervention period for using metformin in adolescents and adults need to be identified.
Due to the numerous means of classifying metformin use interventions and the small sample sizes, the most suitable dosage and intervention period are still inconclusive. To further explore this subject, we performed a network meta-analysis of all available randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of the effects of metformin on overweight people. Network meta-analysis is an extension of pairwise meta-analysis (head-to-head meta-analysis that considers only direct evidence) for which the intervention aims to combine direct and indirect evidence into a single-effect size and to rank all available arms, calculating estimates for interventions even if they have not been compared directly in current studies provided that a common comparator exists [ ]. A few published pairwise meta-analyses [ , , , , ] have analyzed the weight-loss effects of metformin, but these analyses considered only direct evidence and did not rank which intervention arm was the best. They merely demonstrated that metformin has a weight-loss effect, although the analyses were not completely confined to people without diabetes, and the most appropriate dose and intervention period were not identified. No previous reviews have provided a comprehensive overview of nondiabetic participants using network meta-analysis.
Methods
Search strategy and selection criteria
This systematic review was performed with an a priori established protocol (PROSPERO International prospective register of systematic reviews, CRD42017081053) [ ], and the meta-analysis was performed in agreement with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement, the PRISMA network statement, and the Cochrane Collaboration recommendations [ , , ]. RCTs comparing at least two different intervention arms within metformin analysis were searched using PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. No language restrictions or filters were imposed on this search, and it was performed from database inceptions to April 2017.
Inclusion criteria were the following: RCTs of overweight people without diabetes, overweight participants of any gender, impaired or nonimpaired glucose tolerance, and either adolescents or adults (see details in Supplementary Table 1 ). RCTs and randomized crossover trials (RCT/crossover, before and after studies without control groups) were all eligible for the meta-analysis. Exclusion criteria were: patients with type I or type II diabetes, participants with a BMI <25, reviews of the efficacy of metformin, and no primary outcomes reported (BMI and weight changes). Moreover, duplicate published research data were excluded; control groups and unobtainable and unusable data studies were also excluded.
Data abstraction and assessment of risk of bias
Two investigators (HFH and ZYS) independently compiled data on studies, participants, and intervention-related characteristics into a standardized form, and discrepancies were resolved by consensus, with reference back to the original study, in consultation with a third reviewer (ZMY or ZQC). Data were collected regarding study efficacy and trial design: patient characteristics of size, age, gender, glucose tolerance, weight, BMI, body fat (%), fat mass (%), waist-to-hip ratio, waist circumference, HbA1 c , homeostasis model assessment–insulin resistance (HOMA-IR); and details regarding intervention arms, including metformin dosage, frequency, and intervention period. The risk of bias of individual studies was assessed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale score [ ], an 11-item scale that assesses RCT quality. If the answer to the first item is no, the study is excluded from the meta-analysis. When the PEDro score is >4 (maximum 10), the study was considered to be of high quality.
Outcomes
The efficacy outcomes were BMI (kg/m 2 and percentile) and weight (kg) changes. Safety outcomes were evaluated by changes in metabolic indicators. Primary metabolic outcome was lipid and liver metabolism, which included triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) changes; secondary outcomes were inflammatory and cardiovascular risk, which included C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) changes. Efficacy and safety outcomes were stratified by age (adolescents and adults), metformin dose mg/day (≦1000, 1000–2000, and ≧2000), control group (placebo, diet/exercise, lifestyle, fluoxetine), and intervention period (≤3, 3–6, and 6–12 months). We also performed a metaregression according to the grouping method. Moreover, we performed a network meta-analysis according to the 16 intervention arms (fluoxetine; glipizide; lifestyle; metformin 1000 mg/day; metformin 1500 mg/day; metformin 1700 mg/day; metformin 2000 mg/day; metformin 3000 mg/day; metformin 500 mg/day; metformin 750 mg/day; minimeal; placebo; placebo + diet and exercise; placebo + lifestyle; rosiglitazone; sibutramine) to determine weight-loss efficacy of metformin compared with nonmetformin interventions. We performed another network meta-analysis to further determine the most effective dosage (mg/day) and period (months) of metformin usage in adolescents and adults. According to the 19 dosage:period arms (500:12; 500:6; 750:12; 750:3; 750:6; 1000:0.5; 1000:3; 1000:6; 1500:3; 1500:6; 1700:1.5; 1700:2; 1700:12; 1700:3; 1700:6; 2000:12; 2000:2; 2000:6; 3000:6), our aim was to determine the most appropriate dose and dose duration of metformin for losing weight.
Data synthesis and statistical analysis
We defined studies reporting multiple interventions and comparators as substudies (marked as a/b) to avoid double counting and mistreating data. Furthermore, results of crossover studies were included in an additional analysis (considered as substudies).
First, direct meta-analyses were performed with random-effects models, which are arguably the most appropriate and conservative methodology to account for between-trial heterogeneity in each comparison [ , ]. To estimate pooled odds ratios (ORs) or standardized mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), heterogeneity was incorporated within and between studies using STATA v14.0. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using P values and I 2 statistics, with values >50% indicating substantial heterogeneity [ ]. Begg’s and Egger’s tests were used to detect publication bias [ ]. To further investigate heterogeneity, metaregressions and subgroup analyses were performed to assess the primary outcome data and associations according to age, metformin dose miligrams/day, control group, and intervention period (see details in Methods-Outcome part). P values in the metaregression revealed overall significance of influence factors. Additionally, P values were inversely proportional to the degree of heterogeneity, and P values <0.10 indicate factors that could be important sources of heterogeneity.
Second, we did a random-effects network meta-analysis using STATA v14.0 (mvmeta package) and summarized results with SMDs and their 95% credible interval (95% CrI) [ ]. A common heterogeneity parameter was assumed for all comparisons. We also assessed global heterogeneity using P values and I 2 statistics. Each relative intervention-effect estimate resulted from the combination of direct evidence between the two intervention arms and indirect evidence derived from the network meta-analysis, which was assumed to be coherent [ , ]. When a direct connection between the two treatment arms was unavailable, the result was taken from indirect evidence only.
We estimated ranking probabilities for all interventions for each intervention arm. Intervention hierarchy was summarized and reported as the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) [ , ] ranging from 1 (indicating the intervention has a high likelihood of being the best possible type) to 0 (indicating the intervention has a high likelihood of being the worst possible type). Higher SUCRA ranks correspond with a higher ranking of the efficacy of losing weight for one intervention in comparison with other interventions. We also evaluate the inconsistency between direct and indirect data locally by using the loop-specific method and globally by using the design-by-treatment interaction model. Moreover, we plotted a comparison-adjusted funnel plot for the network meta-analysis to detect the presence of any dominant publication bias.
Quality of evidence
In addition, quality of evidence for primary outcomes was assessed based on the GRADE system using GRADEpro GDT [ , ]. The GRADE system assesses the risk of bias (study limitations), imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness of study results, and publication bias (classifying each as high, moderate, low, or very low) across the body of evidence to derive an overall summary of the quality of evidence.
Results
Network and patients
Overall, 911 unique citations were identified using the search strategy. A total of 34 trials (44 analyses, no. patients = 8461) and 16 interventions (see details in 2.3) were included (Supplementary Fig. 1 ) [ , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ]. Fifteen trials with overweight and obese adolescents and 19 with overweight and obese adults were included. The network weight of eligible comparisons for efficacy and the available, direct comparisons and networks of the trials are shown in Fig. 1 . Fig. 1 Network of eligible comparisons for weight (kg) change in overweight adults. Node sizes and edge thicknesses are weighted according to number of studies evaluating each treatment and direct comparison, respectively. The size of each circle is proportional to the number of randomly assigned patients and represents the sample size. The width of lines corresponds to the number of trials
Table 1 summarizes differences in the fundamental characteristics between metformin intervention and control groups (see detailed list of characteristics in Supplementary Table 2 ). These statistics revealed that the two groups had similar baseline results in gender, fat mass, waist-to-hip ratio, HbA1 c , and HOMA-IR; the metformin group had lower age and higher weight, BMI, body fat (%), and waist circumference. In the baseline characteristics analysis, we did not group the studies by age or intervention arm. Baseline characteristics were moderately balanced between metformin and control groups. Assessments of the quality of these studies are presented in Supplementary Table 3 ; the PEDro scale score revealed that all included studies were of acceptable quality (scored >4).

Pairwise meta-analysis
Efficacy outcome: change in BMI (kg/m2)
Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 2 summarize results of BMI (kg/m 2 ) change from 41 analyses in overweight and obese populations. Compared with the control treatment, intervention with metformin revealed a weight loss tendency (standardized mean difference −0.05, 95% CI −0.45 to 0.34) with high heterogeneity ( P = 0.000, I 2 = 96.5%). Moreover, no degree of bias was observed using Begg’s test ( P = 0.828) or Egger’s test ( P = 0.734), and data were of moderate quality according to the GRADE assessment (Table 2 ).

Subgroup analyses and metaregressions were used to explore the source of heterogeneity between metformin and control arms regarding BMI (kg/m 2 ) change (Table 2 ). However, metaregression did not reveal the source of heterogeneity in our pairwise meta-analysis for change in BMI (kg/m 2 ); P values were not significant. Moreover, significant outcomes were observed for metformin dosages >1000 mg/day (−0.48; −0.79 to −0.17), fluoxetine as the control treatment (5.07; 0.26 to 9.87), and an intervention period of 6–12 months (−0.43; −0.75 to −0.10). Therefore, we need to perform further comparisons of differences among intervention arms by network meta-analysis.
Efficacy outcome: change in BMI (percentile)
Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 3 summarize results of BMI (percentile) change from nine analyses in overweight and obese adolescents. Compared with controls, intervention with metformin conferred significant weight loss advantages (−1.24; −2.10 to −0.39) with high heterogeneity ( P = 0.000, I 2 = 95.0%). Moreover, no degree of bias was observed using Begg’s test ( P = 0.176) or Egger’s test ( P = 0.326), and data were of moderate quality according to the GRADE assessment (Table 2 ).
Subgroup analyses and metaregressions were used to explore the source of heterogeneity between metformin and control arms regarding BMI (percentile) change (Table 2 ). However, metaregression did not reveal the source of heterogeneity in pairwise meta-analysis of change in BMI (percentile), and P values were not significant. Additionally, significant outcomes were observed for metformin doses <1000–2000 mg/day (−1.55; −2.85 to −0.26) and an intervention period of 3–6 months (−2.24; −3.94 to −0.55). Therefore, we need to perform further comparisons of differences in intervention arms by network meta-analysis.
Efficacy outcome: change in weight (kg)
Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 4 summarize results of weight (kg) change from 36 analyses in overweight populations. Compared with controls, intervention with metformin revealed a weight loss tendency (−0.19; −0.50 to 0.11) with high heterogeneity ( P = 0.000, I 2 = 96.7%). Moreover, no degree of bias was observed using Begg’s test ( P = 0.123) or Egger’s test ( P = 0.336), and data were of moderate quality according to GRADE assessment (Table 2 ).
Subgroup analyses and metaregressions were used to explore the source of heterogeneity between metformin and control arms regarding weight-loss efficacy (Table 2 ). The metaregression results showed that different age groups might have influenced final results, with a P value of 0.082; moreover, different control arms and intervention periods may also have had large influences on final results, with P values of 0.074 and 0.036, respectively. Additionally, significant outcomes were observed in the adolescent group (−1.02; −1.83 to −0.20), placebo as control group (−0.51; −0.78 to −0.24), and groups with an intervention period of 3–6 months (−0.68; −1.16 to −0.20). In general, network meta-analysis for further comparisons of differences among intervention arms is also necessary.
Metabolic outcome: change in lipid and liver metabolism
Table 3 summarizes results of lipid and liver metabolism change regarding metabolic outcome change from 28 analyses in overweight and obese populations. First, regarding triglycerides (mg/dl), metformin did not increase triglycerides significantly (0.34; −0.17 to 0.86) with high heterogeneity ( P = 0.000, I 2 = 96.9%). From metaregression and subgroup analyses, significant results could only be found in the adult group (0.78; 0.06–1.50) and the placebo as control group (0.53; 0.02–1.05). Metaregression did not reveal the source of heterogeneity in our pairwise meta-analysis of change in triglycerides. Metformin also did not increase total cholesterol significantly (−0.14; −0.65 to 0.38) with high heterogeneity ( P = 0.000, I 2 = 96.8%). Metaregression did not reveal the source of heterogeneity, and no meaningful results could be found in subgroup analyses. Moreover, metformin did not decrease the level of HDL-cholesterol significantly (−0.03l −0.45 to 0.40), with high heterogeneity ( P = 0.000, I 2 = 95.3%), and the source could not be determined by metaregression. Significant results could be found in metformin doses >2000 mg/day (0.47; 0.05–0.90) and lifestyle as the control group (−0.67; −1.00 to −0.34). Furthermore, regarding LDL-cholesterol level, use of metformin did not increase results (−0.03; −0.45 to 0.40), with significant heterogeneity that was not detected by metaregression ( P = 0.000, I 2 = 95.3%); meaningful results could only be found in the lifestyle control group (−0.98; −1.32 to 0.64). Generally, metformin has no specific interference with lipid and liver metabolism.

Metabolic outcome: change in inflammatory and cardiovascular risk
Table 3 also summarizes results of inflammatory and cardiovascular risk regarding metabolic outcome changes from nine analyses in overweight and obese populations; most results come from teenage group. First, metformin has a tendency to decrease CRP (−0.60; −1.31 to 0.11) with high heterogeneity ( P = 0.000, I 2 = 95.1%). The source could not be determined by metaregression, and no significant results were found in subgroup analyses. Moreover, metformin has a tendency to increase IL-6 (0.36; −1.22 to 1.93) with high heterogeneity ( P = 0.000, I 2 = 91.5%). Generally, metformin had no specific effect on inflammatory and cardiovascular risk.
Network meta-analysis for people of different ages of metformin usage
Results of network meta-analysis for weight-loss outcomes (evaluated by BMI and weight) are presented as Figs. 2 and 3 . Fig. 2 Network meta-analysis of body mass index (BMI) (percentile) and weight (kg) change in overweight adolescents. Interventions are reported in order of efficacy pn BMI (percentile) and weight decreases ranked according to surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA). Comparisons between interventions should be read from right to left . For efficacy of intervention, standardized mean differences (SMD) < 0 indicate favorable efficacy of the indicated intervention compared with the other interventions Fig. 3 Network meta-analysis of body mass index (BMI) (kg/m 2 ) and weight (kg) change in overweight adults. Interventions are reported in order of efficacy on body mass index (BMI) (kg/m 2 ) and weight decreases ranked according to surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA). Comparisons between treatments should be read from right to left . For efficacy of intervention, standardized mean differences (SMD) < 0 indicate favorable efficacy of the indicated intervention compared with the other interventions
Adolescents
For adolescents with large differences in height, BMI (percentile) may be more appropriate than BMI (kg/m 2 ) for accurately assessing their weight-loss efficacy. When considering BMI (percentile) as an indicator of weight loss, network meta-analysis indicated that, in comparison with placebo alone, placebo + lifestyle ranked the lowest for efficacy (SMD 0.11; 95% CrI −0.56 to 0. 77), followed by lifestyle alone (0.10, −0.57 to 0.76). Intervention with metformin 2000 mg/day was ranked as the most effective among metformin interventions (−0.58; −1.24 to 0.08), followed by metformin 1000 mg/day (−0.54; −1.22 to 0.14) and metformin 1500 mg/day (−0.57; −1.25 to 0.10). When we assessed the comparative efficacy, 2000 mg/day metformin was superior to all other dosages of metformin intervention, with a significant difference found in the 2000 mg/day vs the placebo + lifestyle group (−0.68; −1.38 to 0.00) (Fig. 2 ). However, similar efficacy results were also found in results of BMI (kg/m 2 ). Supplementary Fig. 5 displays the network BMI (kg/m 2 ) in adolescents of eligible comparisons for weight-loss efficacy. Furthermore, intervention with metformin 1500 mg/day and 2000 mg/day ranked better than all included interventions, which did not reach a similar level of significance (Supplementary Fig. 6 ).
As an indicator of weight loss (kg), network meta-analysis indicated that, in comparison with placebo alone, metformin 2000 mg/day ranked the best in terms of efficacy (−0.70; −1.54 to 0.13), followed by 1700 mg/day (−0.22; −1.05 to 0.06), 1500 mg/day (−0.09; −0.91 to 0.73), and 1000 mg/day (−0.08; −0.90 to 0.75). When we assessed comparative efficacy, metformin 2000 mg/day was superior to all other dosages, while the other associations did not reach a similar level of significance (Fig. 2 ). Thus, weight-loss efficacy of metformin is evident in adolescents and is better than that of lifestyle changes. When evaluating inconsistency, six-eighths of the relative OR values were closer to 1. The scores mean there was good consistency in our network meta-analysis (Supplementary Fig. 7 ). Moreover, the comparison-adjusted funnel plot of weight change was not suggestive of any publication bias (Supplementary Fig. 8 ). However, we considered only the difference between metformin dosages and other interventions and did not consider the impact of metformin use. Of course, application timing is also very important, so we also need to perform dose-time correlation analyses.
Adults
When considering BMI (kg/m 2 ) as an indicator of weight loss in adults, the network meta-analysis indicated that, in comparison with placebo alone, minimeals ranked the highest for efficacy, with a significant difference (−0.43; −0.75 to −0.11), followed by lifestyle (−0.39; −0.69 to −0.08), metformin 1000 mg/day (−0.24; −0.56 to 0.08), 3000 mg/day (−0.20; −0.51 to 0.11), 750 mg/day (−0.18; −0.48 to 0.12), 1700 mg/day (−0.15; −0.42 to 0.12), fluoxetine (−0.13; −0.45 to 0.19), sibutramine (−0.09;−0.41 to 0.23), metformin 500 mg/day (−0.05; −0.38 to 0.27), 1500 mg/day (−0.04, −0.37 to 0.28), 2000 mg/day (−0.03; −0.35 to 0.29), and rosiglitazone (−0.02; −0.34 to 0.30). When we assessed comparative efficacy, minimeal and lifestyle were superior to all other forms of metformin intervention and reached significant differences. For interventions with metformin, dosages of 3000 mg/day and 1000 mg/day may be more suitable.
When considering weight (kg) as an indicator of weight loss in adults, the network meta-analysis suggested that, in comparison with placebo alone, lifestyle alone ranked the highest for efficacy, with a significant difference (−0.60. −0.89 to −0.31), followed by minimeal (−0.43; −0.74 to 0.13), metformin 3000 mg/day (−0.32; −0.61 to −0.02), 1700 mg/day (−0.32; −0.57 to −0.07), fluoxetine (−0.23; −0.54 to −0.07), sibutramine (−0.21; −0.51 to 0.10), metformin 2000 mg/day (−0.19; −0.49 to 0.12), 1500 mg/day (−0.17; −0.48 to 0.14), rosiglitazone (−0.15; −0.45 to 0.16), metformin 500 mg/day (−0.14; −0.43 to 0.14), glipizide (−0.04; −0.34 to 0.26), and metformin 100 mg/day (0.13; −0.61 to 0.43). When we assessed comparative efficacy, lifestyle and minimeal were superior to all other forms of metformin intervention and reached significant differences. For interventions with metformin, a dosage of 3000 mg/day may be more effective than other dosages. Although 1000 mg/day ranked the highest for effectiveness in evaluating BMI (kg/m 2 ) change among all interventions with metformin, it was clearly unreasonable to rank this dosage lowest in evaluating weight change. We suspect that this unreasonableness may be due to the different periods of metformin administration; however, our network meta-analysis did not evaluate this issue, so there is still need for subsequent research.
Network meta-analysis for dosage and period of metformin usage
Adolescents
To determine the most suitable dosage and intervention period for metformin use in overweight adolescents, we conducted another network meta-analysis. Metformin 1000 mg/day intervention for 3 months (dosage:period 1000:3) ranked best for efficacy in decreasing BMI (percentile), followed by 2000:12, 1000:6, 2000:6, 1500:3, and 1500:6. For decreasing weight efficacy, 2000:6 and 1700:6 ranked best, followed by 1700:2, 1000:6, 1000–3, 1500:6, and 2000:12. For the combination weight-reduction (kg) results, 1000 mg/day metformin intervention for 3 months may be the most suitable method in adolescents (Fig. 4 a). Fig. 4 Surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) rankings for body mass index (BMI) (percentile) and weight (kg) change in overweight adolescents ( a ) and for BMI (kg/m 2 ) and weight (kg) change in overweight adults ( b ). Expression: dosage of metformin (mg/day):use period (month). Range: 1 = intervention has high likelihood of being, 0 = intervention has high likelihood of being worst
Adults
To determine the most suitable dosage and intervention period for metformin in overweight and obese adults, we conducted another network meta-analysis. The dosage:period of 3000:6 ranked best in efficacy for decreasing BMI (percentile), followed by 1000:0.5, 750:12, 1700:1.5, 750:-6, 2000:2, 1700:2, 1700:6, 750:3, 1500:3, 1700:3, and 500:6. For weight decrease efficacy, 3000:6, 2000:6, and 1700:6 ranked best, followed by 1700:6, 1000:6, 1700:1.5, 2000:2, 1700:2, 1700:12, 1000:0.5, 1500:3, 1700:3, 500:12, and 500:6. For combined weight reduction results, 3000 mg/day metformin for 6 months may be the most suitable intervention method in adults, and 1000 mg/day for 15 days (0.5 months) may have short-term effects (Fig. 4 b).
Discussion
This network meta-analysis represents the most comprehensive analysis of currently available data regarding metformin vs control interventions for overweight and obese people. We combined direct and indirect evidence from 34 RCTs (44 analyses) comparing 16 different intervention arms in over 8000 adolescents or adults classified as overweight or obese. First, we found that metformin could significantly decrease BMI (percentile) and had a tendency to decrease BMI (kg/m 2 ) and weight (kg) (Figs. S 2 –S 4 ). Significant efficacy for BMI (kg/m 2 ) change was observed for metformin doses of <1000 mg/day, use of fluoxetine as the control and intervention periods of 6–12 months. In the adolescent group, placebo as the control and intervention periods of 3–6 months had significant efficacy for BMI (percentile) and BMI (kg/m 2 ) (Table 1 ). Metaregression may have identified the causes of heterogeneity as metformin dosage, control type, and intervention period. Regarding outcomes of lipid and liver metabolism and inflammatory and cardiovascular risk, application of metformin had less impact on metabolic indicators. Second, this first-time network meta-analysis according to different intervention arms revealed that in adolescents, intervention with metformin at 2000 mg/day ranked better than other interventions; for adults, doses of 3000 and 1000 mg/day ranked the best after minimeal and lifestyle changes (Figs. 2 and 3 ). Third, we performed another network meta-analysis according to dosages and intervention periods of metformin and found that intervention with 1000 mg/day for 3 months may be most suitable for adolescents and 3000 mg/day for 6 months and 1000 mg/day for 0.5 months may be suitable for adults (Fig. 4 ).
Metformin does not undergo hepatic metabolism, causes no hypoglycemia, and has an excellent safety record in adolescents and adults [ , ]. Its effects are produced by inhibiting liver glucose, increasing the sensitivity of peripheral-tissue insulin, and inhibiting the increase of sugar dysplasia in the liver and kidney [ , ]. Mechanisms of its effects on weight loss are not limited to improving insulin resistance but include a reduction in gastrointestinal absorption of carbohydrates [ , ] by induction of an anorectic and lipolytic effect [ ] and decreasing leptin levels [ , ].
This review followed the guidelines for conducting rigorous systematic reviews and network meta-analyses [ , , ]. To identify as many relevant reports as possible and to decrease the risk of bias, a comprehensive search strategy was designed. Based on these considerations, we observed no evidence of publication bias by statistical assessment. Metformin interventions have significant weight-loss effects, especially for BMI (percentile), and similar results were found in a past review study [ ]. Although it is the most effective form of intervention in adolescents, it is secondary to minimeal and lifestyle changes in adults. However, lifestyle interventions are difficult for participants to maintain, and the weight loss achieved tends to be regained over time; this effect is also observed with the minimeal intervention. Therefore, choosing an effective weight-control drug is necessary. In the results of our network meta-analysis, the effectiveness of metformin among nondiabetic people was obvious. Similar results were also found in patients with diabetes [ ], which proved that the weight-loss effect of metformin is excellent. Additionally, although metformin intervention resulted in a significant reduction in body weight and BMI, changes in waist–hip ratio in the intervention and control groups were balanced, which was similar to results of a published study [ ]. This may be due to the significant decrease in visceral fat area during metformin intervention. Moreover, metformin improves cholesterol levels, including lowering blood triglyceride and LDL-cholesterol levels, and these results were also validated in a published article [ ]. Last but not least, there were no significant gender differences in the weight-loss effect of metformin, which was significantly reduced in all studies involving male [ ] and female participants [ , ].
Intervention of 1000 mg/day metformin for 3 months may be the most suitable for adolescents, and we thus need to consider its safety in this age group. Although there was no mention of the risks of using metformin in adolescents in the studies we analyzed, we still need to confirm its safety. There were no differences in liver function tests, serum creatinine, or lactate levels between metformin and control arms in adolescents [ ]. Besides, we did subgroup meta-analyses and metaregression to draw the conclusion that the application of metformin has less impact on metabolic indicators, especially lipid and liver metabolism and inflammatory and cardiovascular risk (Table 3 ). Moreover, intervention with metformin 1000 mg/day for 3 months may be most suitable for adolescents, and intervention with 3000 mg/day for 6 months or 1000 mg/day for 0.5 months may be suitable for adults. Therefore, we need to consider the safety of large doses of metformin: although the trials we included did not mention a risk of high doses over a long period, its safety still needed to be confirmed; one publication drew the conclusion that low-dose metformin showed similar safety to high-dose metformin [ ]. In summary, the application of metformin is safe.
This network meta-analysis had some limitations that merit further discussion. First, the review was restricted to trials involving overweight/obese adolescents and adults without diabetes. We excluded studies in which overweight and obese people were diagnosed with diabetes type I or II, which includes a significant number of people seen in the real world. Similarly, we excluded studies that provided only descriptive data. We used this approach to reduce heterogeneity and inconsistency among trials included in this network meta-analysis; however, we acknowledge that this restricts the external validity of results. Additionally, metformin intervention as one type of pharmacological intervention has been considered to be associated with large, nonspecific treatment effects, so-called placebo effects, which may have resulted in a more significant effect in the metformin intervention arms. Moreover, we measured only three outcomes; some important outcomes (such as fat mass and body fat) were not analyzed due to the small sample sizes. Furthermore, pairwise outcomes were affected by their extensive heterogeneity (Table 1 , Figs. S2 – S4 ), which indicated substantial variability in outcomes of included trials, even though this was often due to heterogeneity in baseline outcomes (Table 1 ) and differences observed in trial design, intervention dosages, intervention period, population, and country of each study. In addition, positive results are easy to publish, but negative results are not as likely to leave the laboratory.
Metformin represents a safe and reasonable option for obese and overweight people who are motivated to lose weight. In conclusion, metformin at a dose of 1000 mg/day for 3 months is probably the best option for adolescents; 3000 mg/day for 6 months or 1000 mg/day for 0.5 months is probably the best option for adults. It should be further emphasized that weight loss with metformin intervention is more likely when accompanied by concurrent modifications of diet and lifestyle activity levels.
