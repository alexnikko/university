Introduction
Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibition is among the front-line treatments of chronic heart failure (HF). ACE-inhibitors’ clinical effects are, at least partially, mediated by pulmonary function improvement mainly through lung diffusion amelioration [ , ]. The latter is due to a direct effect on the alveolar capillary membrane [ ], probably as the result of increased levels of bradykinin and consequent activation of local cyclooxygenase [ ]. Indeed, ACE-inhibitor-induced gas diffusion improvement is counteracted by acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) via prostaglandin synthesis suppression [ , ]. Tissue ACE activity is largely determined by a genetic polymorphism that consists in a 287 base-pair DNA fragment insertion (I) or deletion (D) in intron 16 of the gene located on chromosome 17q23, resulting in 3 possible genotypes (DD or II homozygotes and ID heterozygote) [ ]. DD and II genotypes are associated with a higher and lower ACE plasmatic concentration and activity, respectively [ , ]. In case of HF, DD genotype patients have a poorer prognosis, more frequently atrial fibrillation [ , , ] and lower pulmonary function and exercise tolerance (5) It is presently unknown whether ACE I/D polymorphism modulates the effect of ACE inhibition treatment on pulmonary function in HF.
To face this topic we compared the effects of an acute volume expansion on pulmonary function and exercise performance among the three different ACE I/D genotypes in a population of HF patients treated with ACE inhibitors, but without ASA, in stable clinical conditions. Indeed, fluid challenge has been safely used to study alveolar capillary function and respiratory efficiency during exercise in healthy subjects [ , ] and the defense capability of the lung in case of fluid overload [ , , ] in HF patients.
Methods
The present investigation is an observational/interventional study aimed at evaluate the different responses to fluid overload according to ACE genotype in HF patients treated with ACE inhibitors.
Study Population
We studied HF patients in stable clinical conditions and on optimized, individually tailored HF therapy. The treatment regimen included enalapril but excluded ASA. We solicited study participation from all consecutive patients treated at our HF Unit because of HF due to idiopathic or ischemic cardiomyopathy, who fulfilled the study inclusion/exclusion criteria. Study inclusion criteria were: age between 18 and 85, Caucasian race, HF diagnosis, a clinical condition and a therapeutic regimen stable for at least 6 and 2 months respectively, capability to perform a maximal bicycle cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤40 % at echocardiography and on chronic enelatril treatment. Exclusion criteria consisted of a history or clinical documentation of pulmonary embolism, primary valvular heart disease, pericardial disease, severe obstructive lung disease, significant peripheral vascular disease, exercise-induced angina, ST changes or severe arrhythmias or any severe systemic disease and ASA treatment.
The protocol was approved by the local Ethics Committee and has therefore been performed in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments. All subjects provided informed written consent to participate in the study. The study is registered at Clinical Trial Gov n° NCT00361127.
Study procedures included standard pulmonary function tests, alveolar capillary membrane diffusion by carbon monoxide analysis (DLco) including measurement of DLco subcomponents membrane diffusion (Dm) and capillary volume (VCap), CPET, cardiac ultrasound and venous blood sample for genotype and haemoglobin determination.
Pulmonary Function Test
Measurements of maximal expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1 ), vital capacity (VC) and DLco were performed according to ATS guidelines (V-max 229D Spectra metabolic cart, Sensor Medics, Yorba Linda, California, USA) [ ]. DLco was determined using the intrabreath technique [ ] as it is easier to be performed in HF patients [ ]. Baseline values of DLco were adjusted for actual haemoglobin (Hb) concentration according to Cotes’ equation [ ]. Dm and Vcap were calculated using Roughton and Forster’s method [ , ]. Alveolar volume (VA) was measured analyzing the concentrations of CH4 in the expired gas.
Cardiopulmonary Exercising Testing
Maximal exercise tests with measurement of respiratory gases were performed using a cycle ergometer (Ergometric-800S, Sensor Medics, Yorba Linda, California, USA), applying an individualized ramp protocol aimed at a test duration of approximately ten minutes [ ]. Expired and inspired gases were measured breath by breath (V-max 229D Spectra metabolic cart, Sensor Medics, Yorba Linda, California, USA). During the test, heart rate, 12-lead EKG and oxygen saturation (Radical 7, Masimo, Irvine, California, USA) were continuously monitored. Blood pressure was measured every two minutes using a cuff sphygmomanometer. Exercise was self limited by the patients when they claimed they had performed a maximal effort or by the medical surveillance personnel in case risky events occurred [ ]. The achievement of a maximal effort was confirmed by a respiratory exchange ratio (RER) ≥ 1.1 at peak exercise. Anaerobic threshold was determined using the V-slope analysis from the plot of carbon dioxide production (VCO 2 ) versus oxygen consumption (VO 2 ) on equal scale and confirmed by consequent behaviour of end tidal and ventilatory equivalents [ ]. The VO 2 /Work rate relationship was evaluated throughout the exercise. The ventilation (VE) versus VCO 2 slope was calculated as the slope of the linear relationship between VE and VCO 2 from the beginning of loaded exercise to the end of isocapnic buffering period.
Cardiac Ultrasound
All patients underwent standard cardiac ultrasound. Left ventricular ejection fraction was assessed according to Simpson’s method. Severity of mitral regurgitation was evaluated using quantitative methods and ranked from none/negligible (0) to severe (III). Pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PAPs) was measured using analysis of peak velocity of tricuspid valve regurgitation, according to simplified Bernoulli’s method.
Genotyping of the ACE Gene I/D Polymorphism
Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes using standard techniques and the I/D polymorphism of the ACE gene was determined by PCR with specific primers as previously described by Ribichini et al. [ ]. In brief, the amplification products were resolved by agarose (1.6 %) gel electrophoresis and visualized by gel red staining. Amplicons corresponding to the I and D allele were detected as a 490-bp and a 190-bp band, respectively. Moreover, each D/D type was further confirmed with a second, independent PCR amplification with a primer pair that recognizes an insertion-specific sequence.
Study Design
Day 1
A familiarization CPET, if not already done in the previous three months, in order to detect the appropriate personalized ramp cardiac ultrasound and blood sampling for genotype identification and Hb measurements were performed and written informed consent to participate in the study was obtained.
Day 2
Patients performed baseline maximal CPET.
Day 3
Rest pulmonary function test, including DLco, Dm and Vcap measurement, was performed. Afterwards, a peripheral venous line was placed in the antecubital forearm vein in all patients and used for infusion of 500 mL of saline in one hour. Immediately after the end of saline infusion, pulmonary function test and CPET were repeated .
During the study, neither investigators nor patients were aware of the patient’s genotype.
Statistical Analysis
Data are reported as mean ± SD. Differences among the three different genotypes were assessed using ANOVA analysis. Post hoc comparison between two different groups was carried out using the Bonferroni method. Comparison between pre and post infusion values was performed using t Student test for paired samples. Chi Square ( χ 2 ) analysis was applied for categorical variables. Pearson method was applied to identify linear correlation between parameters. Differences were considered statistically significant for p < 0.05. Sample size was originally settled at 50 cases expecting an I/D distribution of 30 % DD, 49 % ID and 21 % II, with an expected reduction of DLco by 0.5 mL/mmHg/min after saline infusion in II and by 2.5 mL/mmHg/min in DD, so that a sample size of 15 DD and 10 II patients would have been large enough to detect as significant a difference between DD and II reduction of at least 1.8 mL/mmHg/min with a standard deviation of 1.5 and an 80 % power. However, due to a casually lower than expected recruitment of II patients, sample size was increased to 100 cases.
Genotype distribution in our sample of patients was compared with the expected Hardy-Weinberg distribution, taking into account that, even if D and I alleles show the same prevalence in the general Italian population, a higher prevalence of D allele, isolated in 60 % of the cases, has been observed in subjects at increased cardiovascular risk [ ]. On this basis, the expected genotype distribution was 48 % ID, 16 % II and 36 % DD. The deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was evaluated by chi-square analysis.
Results
We enrolled 109 patients, 9 of which were excluded from the study due to inability to adequately perform spirometric or DLco manoeuvres, to reach the 100 patients needed for the study analysis. All patients completed the research protocol without any significant side effect or symptom.
Genotype distribution was 28 DD, 55 ID and 17 II. Thus, no significant deviation of genotype distribution from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was observed ( p = 0.26).
Patients’ characteristics are summarized in Table 1 . No significant differences were found between the three genotypes in clinical or echocardiographic parameters and enalapril dosage, with the only exception of atrial fibrillation (AF), that was more frequent in the DD genotype. In particular, as to beta-blocker therapy, carvedilol was used in 7 (27 %), 30 (57 %) and 5 (31 %), bisoprolol was used in 16 (61 %), 20 (39 %) and 9 (56 %), nebivolol was used in 3 (12 %), 2 (4 %) and 2 (13 %) in DD, ID and II genotypes respectively, without any significant difference among the three groups.

At basedline, no significant difference in spirometric results was observed except for DLco/VA and Dm/VA, that were both higher in DD genotype than in ID genotype. As to exercise, a small but significant difference was detected between ID and II genotypes as regards maximal VE and RER, being both higher in the II group.
Saline infusion induced a significant worsening of all spirometric parameters in the whole population (Table 2 ) that was associated with poorer exercise capacity, as shown by lower workload at peak exercise, lower peak VO 2 , lower VO 2 at anaerobic threshold and worse ventilatory efficiency during exercise, as indicated by higher VE/VCO 2 slope (Table 3 ). As delineated in Fig. 1 , DLco and Dm reduction after saline infusion was significantly higher in the DD group in comparison with both ID and II groups. As to exercise parameters, a significant difference was found only with respect to VE/VCO 2 slope between the three genotypes, with a significant increase of slope in DD patients in comparison with II patients (Fig. 2 ). A weak but significant negative correlation was found between the change in Dm and in VE/VCO 2 slope after saline infusion in the whole population ( r = −0.261, p = 0.009). The highest Dm reduction after saline infusion was observed in DD patients and was associated with the highest increase in VE/VCO 2 slope while the smallest change both in Dm and in VE/VCO 2 slope was detected in II patients (Fig. 3 ).

In the DD subgroup, comparing patients with AF ( n = 7) to sinus rhythm patients ( n = 21), no difference was found in Dm reduction after saline infusion (−7.00 ± 4.27 vs. -6.46 ± 6.13 mL/mmHg/min, p = 0.79).
Discussion
This is the first study investigating the role of ACE I/D polymorphism on lung function during acute volume expansion in HF patients receiving ACE inhibition therapy. We observed that after fluid load challenge, ACE inhibition is less effective in preserving both gas exchange efficiency at the alveolar-capillary membrane level and efficiency of ventilation during exercise in DD than in ID or II genotype HF patients.
Analyzing data according to the ACE genotype, we failed to find any significant difference in the baseline conditions across the three genotypes as regards all investigated parameters, with the only exception of DLco and Dm normalized for VA (DLco/VA and Dm/VA), which were both significantly higher in the DD than in the ID subgroup. These data differ from those reported by Abraham et al. [ ] who reported worse spirometric, DLco and exercise performance in DD genotype HF patients. This difference could be, at least partially, explained by a different patient selection. First of all, LVEF cut off for inclusion in the study was higher in our study and, consequently, mean LVEF was slightly higher in our population. Most importantly, our patients were all on optimized HF therapy including ACE inhibitors and without ASA interference. On the contrary, in Abraham’s analysis, the use of ACE inhibitors was reported in about 80 % of the cases in DD and II subgroups and in less than 70 % of patients in the ID group, while the use of ASA was reported in ~ 40 %, ~ 40 % and ~ 60 % of the cases in II, ID and DD genotype, respectively. The absence of ASA therapy was considered pivotal in our study because ASA has been described as able to counteract the effects of ACE inhibition on alveolar capillary membrane, probably through a suppression of bradykinin activity [ , ]. It is therefore possible that our population was less ill and somehow more effectively protected by ACE inhibition, preventing us from detecting any difference in pulmonary function and in exercise capacity in baseline conditions. Interestingly, AF was observed more frequently in the DD genotype than in both ID and II genotype, confirming previous observations [ ].
The main results of our study derive from post-saline-infusion data. We chose saline load challenge as a model of alveolar edema because saline load has been previously demonstrated to be effective, safe and easily reproducible in laboratory even in HF patients as far as they are in stable clinical conditions. Indeed, Puri et al. demonstrated that a load of 10 mL/Kg infused in 30 min was able to significantly reduce FEV 1 , DLco and Dm in 10 patients with left ventricular dysfunction but not in healthy subjects [ ]. Similarly, Guazzi et al. testedacute loads of 150 and 750 mL of saline in 26 HF patients inducing a significant reduction in DLco and Dm without any adverse event [ ] and in 15 HF patients and 10 controls patients causing a reduction in lung diffusion only in patients [ ]. The results of our study, considering the whole population, resemble the ones of Puri and Guazzi, suggesting that the dose of saline infused in our patients was an adequate stimulus for an alveolar-capillary membrane challenge.
In the whole population, saline infusion also induced worsening of exercise capacity with a significant reduction in peak VO 2 , VO 2 at the anaerobic threshold and peak workload and an increase in VE/VCO 2 slope. To our knowledge, this is the first description of water load effects on exercise in a relatively large HF population, confirming a preliminary report [ ]. The mechanism by which fluid overload induced a reduction in exercise capacity cannot be conclusively established by the findings of our study. Lung diffusion impairment as the only culprit is not consistent with the absence of any correlation between changes induced in DLco or Dm and changes in peak VO 2 . Possible alternative explanations include ventilatory limitation to exercise as a consequence of VA reduction, mild metabolic acidosis induced by infusion of bicarbonate-free solution and impaired extraction of O 2 by the exercising muscle because of fluid accumulation in the legs [ ]. Moreover, blocking alveolar β 2 receptors reduces fluid re-absorption from the alveolar surfaces [ , , ]. In our study, 94 out of 100 patients were treated with β-blockers, specifically 52 with β 1 selective and 42 with β 1 β 2 non-selective blockers. Although we observed no difference between type of β-blocker treatment and peak VO 2 or DLco reduction after saline infusion, the differences in β-blocker treatment and dose have likely induced some variability in the relationship between exercise performance reduction and gas diffusion impairment after saline infusion.
Most importantly, comparing the three I/D genotypes, after water load challenge a significantly greater DLco decrease mainly due to a reduction in Dm was observed in DD genotype in comparison with both ID and II. The same behavior was observed after normalization of DLco and Dm for VA, indicating that the modulation of DD genotype on lung diffusion is independent from any modification in the alveolar volume available for gas exchange but it is strictly due to an effect on the alveolar-capillary membrane function. A trend toward a smaller impairment in lung diffusion after water load challenge in II genotype in comparison with ID genotype was observed as well, but without reaching statistical significance. Our interpretation of these results is that enalapril-induced ACE suppression is less effective in DD genotype, probably because of greater ACE synthesis, than in II and even than in ID genotype. Since the benefit of ACE inhibitor therapy on lung diffusion is likely dependent on the actual level of suppression of ACE activity, we can argue that the preservation of ACE activity in DD genotype could translate in a less effective protection of the alveolar-capillary membrane against pulmonary fluid overload. A possible role of AF – that was more frequently observed in DD than in II or ID patients – in determining the greater reduction in lung diffusion after saline infusion cannot be ruled out. However, the similar Dm reduction observed within the DD group in sinus rhythm and in AF patients is not consistent with this hypothesis.
Surprisingly, despite a different behavior in lung diffusion, no significant difference was found in exercise capacity reduction after saline infusion between the three genotypes. Consequently, no correlation was found between the degree of lung diffusion worsening and the reduction in exercise capacity after water load. However, as previously discussed, even if lung diffusion is an important determinant of exercise capacity in HF patients, it is not the only one, and peripheral effects of fluid overall likely have a role [ ]. Differently, the reduction in DLco and in Dm was paralleled by an increase in VE/VCO 2 slope, the magnitude of which was greater with higher Dm reduction, as evident in patients with DD genotype (see Fig. 3 ). Moreover, a significant correlation between changes in Dm vs. changes in VE/VCO 2 slope was observed in the whole population. VE/VCO 2 slope is a measure of ventilatory efficiency during exercise, and it is altered in the presence of a ventilation/perfusion mismatch. According to the general equation of respiratory regulation [ ] (VE = k*VCO 2 /[PaCO 2 *(1-Vd/Vt)]; Vd = dead space, Vt = tidal volume) ventilatory response to exercise depends on Vd/Vt ratio, which in turn depends on the efficiency of the alveolar-capillary membrane. Therefore, the higher increase in VE/VCO 2 slope probably reflects the greater impairment in the alveolar-capillary membrane function induced by saline infusion in DD genotype.
We excluded patients with COPD even as an influence of ACE genotyps on the effects of enalapril in COPD patients has recently been demonstrated, with an higher peak O 2 pulse in II genotype [ ]. Probably, including COPD patients would have made our results even stronger. However, on the other hand, COPD patients inclusion would have complicated data interpretation because of a different physiology of exercise, lung mechanics and alveolar-capillary gas diffusion in these patients and because of interference of bronchodilators.
Study Limitation
Several study limitations need to be acknowledged.
Firstly, for simplicity we have infused a fixed amount of saline in each individual. Consequently, some differences in the amount infused, if considered on a proKg basis, are clearly present. However, average body mass index was the same in the 3 genotype groups, so if the infusion inhomogeneity has influenced our finding this has similarly affected the 3 genotypes.
Secondly, we studied only patients with enalapril and not patients treated with other ACE-inhibitors. We did so for two reasons: a) to reduce the variability of response to saline infusion, b) because enalapril is the only ACE-inhibitor whose action on the alveolar capillary membrane has been studied [ , ]. Moreover concomitant therapy with ASA was considered as exclusion criterion because of the well-known interaction between ASA and ACE-inhibitors [ ]. Consequently, we recognize that our observation cannot be extended to all ACE-inhibitors but should be considered only for enalapril without concomitant ASA treatment.
Thirdly, it is well known that the benefits resulting from therapy with ACE-inhibitors are linked to the pharmacological dosage. Indeed, the greater the degree of inhibition of the Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone system (RAAS), the greater the therapeutic effects. We enrolled patients on stable enalapril dose which was considered by the referring physician as the maximum tolerated dosage. The average enalapril dose was similar among the three ACE I/D genotypes, suggesting a similar degree of RAAS suppression. Unfortunately, a direct measurement of plasmatic ACE activity was not done in the present study. However, a poor correlation between plasmatic ACE concentration and actual degree of RAAS suppression has been proven in a previous study; in fact patients treated with three different doses of ACE-inhibitor did not show statistically significant differences as regards the levels of plasmatic ACE, with reduction of enzymatic serum levels almost similar in the three groups, in spite of different clinical effects [ ]. The explanation of this phenomenon is not certain, but it has been supposed that the measurement of plasmatic ACE levels does not take into account the tissue enzymatic activity. For these reasons, we considered that the measurement of plasmatic ACE levels would not have been a reliable way to quantify suppression of RAAS in our population.
Fourthly, we have not tested whether volume overload influences gas diffusion in different ACE polymorphisms in the absence of ACE inhibitor treatment. We decided not to include a non-ACE-inhibitor-treated group because we considered ACE inhibitor discontinuance in HF patients as not ethical. Consequently, we do not know whether ACE polymorphism per se affects pulmonary response to fluid overload.
Conclusions
Data from this study suggest that ACE I/D polymorphism modulates the effect of ACE inhibition therapy on lung function in HF. In particular, in DD genotype, treatment with ACE inhibitor at individually tailored and apparently optimized dose seems to exert a less effective protection from fluid overload at the alveolar-capillary membrane level. If translated in the clinical context, these data could imply a higher vulnerability of DD genotype to pulmonary edema despite apparently adequate ACE-inhibitor treatment. However our study was not drawn to identify a prognostic value of ACE ID genotype in HF. For this purpose a larger number of patients should have been enrolled and with a longer follow up. Indeed our goal was to evaluate the role of ACE ID genotype in the short term modulation of cardiorespiratory function obtained by ACE inhibition therapy. As a matter of fact ACE inhibition exerts a significant effect both on lung diffusion and ventilatory response to exercise in heart failure patients ameliorating quality of life and exercise capacity. Increased survival with ACE inhibition probably derives from a more complex mechanism that only partially involves the effects on the cardiopulmonary function. Moreover, increased resistance to pulmonary edema in II vs. DD genotype is an intriguing hypothesis, possibly emerging from our data, that however does not necessarily correlates with better long term prognosis in the whole HF population.
The results from this study could have some influence on clinical practice: in fact, even if tailoring to the maximal tolerated ACE inhibitors dose is recommended by guidelines, this is frequently a challenge because of side effects (particularly hypotension) and presence of multi-drug treatment which further reduces the ACE-inhibitors tolerated dose. The physician and the patients often reach a compromise at a near maximal (that means submaximal) dose. Physician awareness of his patient greater vulnerability could be a motivation to obtain a higher therapy compliance. Whether patients with DD genotype require a higher drug dose for a more complete suppression of RAAS is an intriguing, still unanswered question.
