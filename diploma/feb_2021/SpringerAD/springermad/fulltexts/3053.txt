Introduction
Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common malignancy of the female reproductive system [ ]. The 5-year survival rate in women with stage I, II, III, and IV disease was reported as 83–93%, 73%, 52%, and 27%, respectively [ ].
Pelvic and paraaortic lymph node (LN) involvement is a major risk factor for poor prognosis in women with EC [ ]. Systematic pelvic and paraaortic LN dissection is essential during initial surgery in high-risk patients with EC to achieve accurate surgical staging. The incidence of pelvic or paraaortic LN involvement in EC has been reported to be 5% to 20% [ , ].
Although the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) recommends complete surgical staging including pelvic and paraaortic LN dissection [ ], the extent of LN dissection is still controversial. Nevertheless, the detection of paraaortic LN metastasis is crucial for deciding on adjuvant therapy as well as determining the radiotherapy (RT) field. If surgical staging is inadequate, adjuvant pelvic RT is indicated, and lack of information about the involvement of paraaortic LNs can lead to undertreatment in some patients [ ].
The routine surgical procedure for staging and treatment of EC is currently total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, with pelvic and paraaortic LN dissection, in many clinics worldwide [ , ]. However, it has also been reported that paraaortic LN dissection increases morbidity in low-risk patients without a survival benefit [ , ]. On the other hand, findings from the SEPAL study have shown that paraaortic LN dissection has survival benefits for patients at intermediate or high risk of recurrence, and that pelvic lymphadenectomy alone might be an insufficient surgical procedure for EC patients at risk of LN metastasis [ ]. With this background, determination of patients who are at risk of paraaortic LN metastasis gains clinical importance.
The purpose of this study was to determine the risk factors for paraaortic LN metastasis in EC patients who underwent comprehensive surgical staging.
Materials and methods
Patients with EC (endometrioid, non-endometrioid, or mixed histology) who underwent primary surgical treatment in our department between January 2008 and February 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. The study protocol was approved by the Local Institutional Review Board. All patients provided an informed consent regarding research use of their medical information.
Women were included if they had undergone primary surgical treatment including total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy + pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy. We excluded patients with incomplete surgical staging, women who received neoadjuvant treatment (either hormonal therapy or chemotherapy), women with primary synchronous malignancy, and patients with incomplete medical records.
Patient data were collected from review of medical records including clinic notes, operation reports, and pathology reports. The clinical and pathological characteristics of patients were recorded. Tumor characteristics were abstracted from original pathology reports, and the following data were noted: histological type, tumor grade, depth of myometrial invasion (<50 and ≥50%), primary tumor diameter (PTD) [as a continuous variable or dichotomous (<2 cm, 2–3.9 cm, or ≥ 4 cm)], cervical invasion (yes or no), adnexal involvement (yes or no), presence of lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI), and the status of peritoneal cytology examination (negative, positive, or not performed).
Data recorded on the extent of surgery included number of total LNs harvested, number of pelvic LNs removed, number of paraaortic LNs removed, number of metastatic pelvic LNs (if applicable), number of metastatic paraaortic LNs (if applicable), and stage of the disease. Staging was determined according to 2009 FIGO criteria [ ]. In patients treated before 2009, stage was determined retrospectively on the basis of surgical and pathological assessment. All operations were performed by gynecological oncologists. We defined pelvic lymphadenectomy as removal of the lymphatic tissue in the external and common iliac and obturator regions. Paraaortic LN dissection was defined as removal of the lymphatic tissue over the inferior vena cava and aorta beginning at the level of aortic bifurcation up to the left renal vessels. A systematic LN dissection was arbitrarily defined as removal of more than 20 LNs [ ].
All surgical specimens were examined and interpreted by gynecological pathologists. Architectural grading was defined by standard International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) criteria. Tumor size was macroscopically measured on fresh tissue by gynecological pathologists who noted size in three largest dimensions. The largest of three dimensions of the tumor was defined as primary tumor diameter (PTD) [ ]. If more than one lesion was present, the lesion with the largest diameter was considered [ ]. LVSI was defined as the presence of adenocarcinoma of any extent, in endothelium-lined channels of uterine specimens extracted at the time of surgery [ ].
Statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software v. 23 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). The data were expressed as median and range for continuous variables, and binary variables were reported as counts and percentages. Simple logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the correlation of tumor characteristics with paraaortic LN metastasis. A p value <0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. Variables with a p value less than 0.05 were included in the multiple logistic regression analysis. The impact of each factor on paraaortic LN metastasis was evaluated.
Results
During the study period, 717 women underwent surgery for EC, and 641 (89.4%) of them fulfilled the inclusion criteria. We excluded 67 patients with incomplete surgical staging, as well as women who received neo-adjuvant chemotherapy ( n = 2), those who had any synchronous malignancy ( n = 2), and those whose medical records were incomplete ( n = 5).
Median age of the patients at surgery was 59 years (range, 28–85 years). Four hundred and seventy-four patients (74%) had stage I, 40 (6%) had stage II, 95 (15%) had stage III, and 32 (5%) had stage IV disease, respectively. Five hundred and one (78.1%) patients were detected to have endometrioid type histopathology whereas 93 (14.5%) had non-endometrioid and 47 (7.3%) had mixed (endometrioid histopathology along with other subtypes) tumors, respectively. Among women with endometrioid histopathology, 328 (65.5%) women had FIGO grade 1 tumors, 121 (24.2%) women had FIGO grade 2 tumors, and 52 (10.4%) women had FIGO grade 3 tumors. Myometrial invasion was more than 1 in 2 of 215 (33.5%) patients whereas there were 171 (26.7%) patients with LVSI. Cervical stromal invasion was detected in 82 (12.8%), adnexal involvement in 51 (7.9%), and serosal invasion in 32 (5%) women, respectively. Peritoneal cytology was positive in 61 (9.5%) patients. Table 1 shows the clinicopathological features of the patients.

All patients except 3 underwent systematic LN dissection. The total number of LNs removed in the 3 patients who underwent nonsystematic LN dissection was 17, 18, and 19, respectively. The rate of achieving systematic LN dissection was 99.5%. The median number of LNs removed was 53 (range, 17–146). The median number of pelvic and paraaortic LNs removed was 37 (range, 17–90), and 16 (range, 5–61), respectively. LN metastasis was detected in 90 (14%) patients; pelvic alone in 28 (4.3%), isolated paraaortic in 15 (2.3%), and both pelvic and paraaortic in 47 (7.3%) women, respectively. Among 501 women with endometrioid histology, 7 (1.39%) women had isolated paraaortic LN metastasis.
Univariate analysis revealed that the risk of paraaortic LN metastasis significantly increased in patients with non-endometrioid histology ( p < 0.001), age more than 60 years ( p = 0.023), grade 3 tumor ( p < 0.001), deep myometrial invasion ( p < 0.001), LVSI ( p < 0.001), primary tumor diameter ≥2 cm ( p < 0.001), cervical stromal invasion ( p < 0.001), adnexal involvement ( p < 0.001), serosal invasion ( p < 0.001), pelvic LN involvement ( p < 0.001), ≥2 positive pelvic LNs ( p < 0.001), and positive peritoneal cytology ( p < 0.001) (Table 2 ).

At the end of multivariate analysis, the presence of LVSI [odds ratio (OR), 4.8; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.25–18.2; p = 0.022) and pelvic LN involvement (OR, 18.8; 95% CI, 5.7–61.6; p < 0.001) were found to be independent risk factors for the development of paraaortic LN metastasis in women with EC (Table 2 ).
The rate of paraaortic LN metastasis was 0.2% in women with no LVSI and no metastatic pelvic LNs. The presence of LVSI alone increased the risk of paraaortic LN involvement to 13.3%, whereas in cases of pelvic LN involvement the rate of paraaortic LN metastasis was 33.3%. However, in women with metastatic pelvic LNs and LVSI positivity, the risk of paraaortic LN metastasis was found to be 66.6% (Table 3 ).

Discussion
We defined positive pelvic LN status and presence of LVSI as independent predictors for paraaortic LN involvement in a cohort of 641 EC patients who underwent comprehensive surgical staging with a systematic LN dissection rate of 99.5%. Our results indicate that women with positive pelvic LNs were 19 times more likely to have paraaortic LN metastasis whereas patients with LVSI were 5 times more likely to have positive paraaortic LNs.
However, we should underline a number of important limitations associated with our study. First, the retrospective nature of the study cannot exclude any bias. Second, the lack of ultra-staging and lack of subgroup analysis for the detailed anatomic regions of metastatic LNs seem to be other important limitations of the current study. It would be ideal to label the removed LNs (i.e., supra- and infra-mesenteric) to have better information about the localization of the metastatic paraaortic LNs.
The most controversial management issue relates to the requirement for, and the extent and therapeutic value of, lymphadenectomy [ ]. To minimize undertreatment and achieve optimal oncological outcomes, patients who will derive potential therapeutic value from lymphadenectomy should be identified. In contrast, patients who will not benefit from lymphadenectomy must be identified to minimize overtreatment and prevent lymphadenectomy-associated serious morbidities such as intraoperative bleeding, deep vein thrombosis, lymphocyst formation, lymphedema of lower extremities, and chylous ascites [ ].
Although two prospective randomized trials reported that systematic lymphadenectomy did not improve disease-free or overall survival in EC [ , ], there is still controversy on the therapeutic benefits and prognostic value of lymphadenectomy [ , , , ]. The recommendation of FIGO has been to perform surgical staging in all patients with EC since 1988 [ ]. Nevertheless, LN status, along with the assessment of other high risk factors, allows adequate selection of patients for adjuvant therapy.
Historically, Creasman et al. [ ] first described the factors for the risk of LN metastasis according to histopathological factors. They reported that tumor grade and particularly the depth of myometrial invasion were related to the risk of nodal metastasis [ ]. One decade later, the addition of paraaortic LN dissection to pelvic lymphadenectomy came to be realized based on preoperative tumor histopathology or intraoperative frozen section analysis with regard to tumor grade and the depth of myometrial invasion [ ].
Different factors affect the rate of paraaortic LN metastasis in EC. One of the most well-known risk factors is the involvement of pelvic LNs [ , , , , ]. More than half of the patients with pelvic LN metastasis have paraaortic LN involvement [ ]. Similar to previous results, 52.2% of patients with positive pelvic LNs had paraaortic LN metastasis in the current study. In our study, pelvic LN metastasis and presence of LVSI were found to be independent predictors for paraaortic LN metastasis in accordance with previous reports [ , , , ]. Studies investigating predictive factors for paraaortic LN metastasis in EC revealed deep myometrial invasion, grade 3 endometrioid carcinoma, non-endometrioid histology, elevated serum CA-125 levels, and LVSI as significant risk factors for paraaortic LN involvement [ , ]. Table 4 summarizes nine recent studies, as well as the current one, which analyzed predictive factors for paraaortic LN metastasis in EC. Our findings are in accordance with previous studies that involved more than 100 patients [ , , , , ].

As a concerning issue, isolated paraaortic LN metastasis in the setting of negative pelvic LNs has been reported in less than 5% of patients. Isolated paraaortic LN metastasis is mostly associated with the risk factors for pelvic LN involvement [ ]. In the current study, the rate of isolated paraaortic LN metastasis was 2.3%. Mariani et al. [ ] focused on paraaortic dissemination in EC and found that only 2% of patients with negative pelvic LNs had paraaortic LN metastasis. In the current study the rate of isolated paraaortic LN involvement was 1.4% among women with endometrioid histopathology. Characteristics of patients who had endometrioid histology and isolated paraaortic LN metastasis are shown in Table 5 .

Kumar et al. [ ] reported that surgeons might potentially forgo paraaortic LN dissection in the majority of patients with endometrioid type EC to reduce surgical morbidity. The authors emphasized that this cohort can be identified by a combined absence of positive pelvic LNs, >50% myometrial invasion, and LVSI (28). Vaizoglu et al. [ ] demonstrated that LVSI should be considered as a valuable pathological parameter for the surgical management of patients with EC. They reported that the incidence of LN metastasis in the paraaortic area was 0.5% among patients without LVSI. In our study, the rate of paraaortic LN metastasis in patients without LVSI was found as 0.8% (Table 2 ).
Currently, LVSI is considered a prerequisite for tumor dissemination to the lymphatic system [ ]. Lymphovascular space invasion is very difficult to assess during intraoperative frozen section analysis, and it is often reported only at the final pathology report [ ]. Assessment of LVSI is subject to interobserver variation. Stromal retraction, displacement of tumor cells into vascular channels, and coexistent inflammation may all add to difficulty in interpretation [ ]. However, it has recently been reported that LVSI may be determined by intraoperative frozen section analysis with 50% sensitivity, 100% specificity, 94.4% of negative predictive value, and 100% of positive predictive value [ ]. Based on these data, LVSI may be suggested as a routine pathological parameter to be studied during frozen section analysis for women undergoing surgery for EC.
Our study has important clinical implications. First, in women without LVSI and positive pelvic LNs, the rate of paraaortic LN metastasis is only 0.2%, which is negligible. Second, the presence of LVSI solely increases this probability to 13.3% in patients with negative pelvic LNs. Finally, the rate of paraaortic LN metastasis is 66.6% for women with both LVSI positivity and positive pelvic LNs (Table 3 ), and paraaortic LN dissection becomes mandatory for patients with these features. In this background, the presence of LVSI should be met cautiously for the risk of paraaortic LN involvement, even in women without positive pelvic LNs.
The strengths of this study lie in the large number of patients with similar demographic characteristics, detailed analysis of various clinicopathological factors that might have an impact on paraaortic LN metastasis, performance of uniform staging procedures with the same qualified gynecological oncologists, and a very high rate of systematic LN dissection. Our study is one of the largest retrospective cohorts associated with prediction of paraaortic LN metastasis in women with EC.
As a conclusion, the presence of LVSI and pelvic LN involvement appear to be independent risk factors for paraaortic LN metastasis in patients with EC. LVSI may be considered as a routine pathological parameter during frozen section examination in women with EC undergoing surgery.
