Introduction
Marijuana and its major psychotropic component, Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), has been used for recreational and medical purposes for millennia [ ]. Early reports focused on the impact of cannabinoids in the nervous system. Indeed, many of their clinical applications such as pain [ ], movement disorders [ ] and appetite [ ] were investigated long before the discovery of their physiological targets. By contrast, the well-known cardiovascular effects of marijuana on blood pressure and heart rate were first reported as recently as the early 1970s [ ]. Some of the same effects induced by marijuana are also caused by endogenous analogs, the so-called endocannabinoids (eCBs) that differ chemically from plant-derived or synthetic cannabinoid drugs. Endocannabinoids and their targets (i.e. the eCB system) exert these effects on the cardiovascular system by acting on neurotransmitter release at the central nervous system (CNS) and sympathetic nerve terminals or locally by modulating vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), inflammatory cells and endothelial function [ ]. There is growing evidence demonstrating that the eCB system is implicated both in cardiovascular physiology (blood pressure, cardiac contractility and heart rate) [ , ] and the pathogenesis of hypertension, heart disease and atherosclerosis [ , , ].
This review gives a detailed outline of the eCB system, in particular the most well-characterized receptors and endogenous cannabinoids. Followed by an in-depth look at the role of the eCB system in the regulation of cardiovascular function and the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. Finally, this review examines the promising drugs that could potentially progress to clinical trials to treat the abovementioned cardiovascular disorders.
The endocannabinoid system
The endocannabinoid system comprises two classic cannabinoid receptors, CB 1 R [ ] and CB 2 R [ ], the latter also known as the “immune cannabinoid receptor”. Among a number of recently discovered receptors targeted by cannabinoids, transient receptor potential channels (i.e. TRPV1, reviewed in [ ]), peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPARs) [ ] and GPR18, formerly called the abnormal CBD receptor [ ], have been shown to play a role in the cardiovascular system. In addition, recent studies show that cannabinoid ligands can also target the receptors GPR55 [ ] and GPR119 [ ]. Since most research involving the eCB system in the cardiovascular system have examined the CB 1 R, CB 2 R, TRPV1 and PPAR, this review will focus exclusively on these receptors. The two most investigated eCBs are the lipid ligands anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) [ ].
Cannabinoid receptors
Cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB1R)
The human CB 1 R was first cloned in 1990 from a rat cerebral cortex cDNA library [ ]. CB 1 R is the most abundant of all G-protein coupled receptors in the CNS [ ]. It is also present in peripheral tissue, including the heart and vasculature [ , ]. Within the central and peripheral regulatory locations in the cardiovascular system, CB 1 R is located in the solitary tract nucleus [ ], rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) [ ], paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus [ ], sympathetic nerve endings innervating the resistance blood vessels [ ], myocardium [ ], vascular endothelium [ ], VSMCs [ ] and inflammatory cells (macrophages, lymphocytes) [ ].
The CB 1 R when activated signals through Gαi/o proteins. This results in the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity and N- and P/Q-type calcium currents, and the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and A-type and inwardly rectifying potassium currents [ , ] (Fig. 1 ). CB 1 Rs can also signal through other G proteins (Gαs, Gαq, Gαz) depending on the ligand or the cell type [ ]. Activation of CB 1 Rs in VSMCs decreases L-type calcium channel currents which leads to vasodilatation [ ]. In endothelial cells, however, CB 1 R activation stimulates Ca 2+ influx and in turn activates the MAPK cascade, playing a role in endothelial cell growth and proliferation [ ]. In presynaptic terminals, the CB 1 R suppresses the release of a number of neurotransmitters and neuroactive substances (reviewed in [ ]). Interestingly, the presence of CB 1 R in mitochondria indicates its role in the control of cellular respiration and metabolism [ ]. Fig. 1 Cannabinoid and cannabinoid-like receptor signaling pathways. Modified from Sierra's work [ ]. The stimulation of CB 1 R or CB 2 R by an agonist leads to the dissociation of the Gαi/o subunit from the Gβγ subunit. This leads to Gαi/o-mediated inhibition of cAMP production and calcium channels and to Gβγ-mediated modulation of potassium channels, ultimately resulting in the inhibition of neurotransmitter or inflammatory mediator release, or decreased contractility. The stimulation of TRPV1 results in the influx of sodium and calcium, thereby depolarizing the cell. Also, it activates PKA leading to the synthesis of NO and the release of CGRP and SP. PPAR ligand binding results in PPAR translocation from the cytoplasm into the nucleus where it activates or represses gene expression. PPAR also induces NOs.

CB 1 R knockout mice display an absence of cannabinoid-induced hypotension and bradycardia [ ]. Early studies suggest that CB 1 R-mediated blood pressure effects could be due to a central mechanism (i.e. a change in the activity of sympathetic premotor neurons in the medullary vasomotor center or sympathetic postganglionic nerves) [ ] and the cardiovascular effects following intracerebroventricular administration of CB 1 R agonists support this possibility [ ]. In addition, mRNA expression of the CB 1 R in the sympathetic ganglion and CB 1 R-mediated inhibition of norepinephrine released from sympathetic nerve terminals following treatment with CB 1 R agonists, supports a peripheral neurogenic action for the CB 1 R [ , ]. Notably, chemically sympathetic denervated rats demonstrate vasodilation, possibly due to a direct local effect in VSMCs [ ]. Interestingly, the tachycardic effect of Δ 9 -THC in young non-chronic marijuana users is most likely due to the inhibition of acethylcholine release from vagal afferents via presynaptic CB 1 R [ ]. This effect is reversed by a CB 1 R antagonist [ ]. In addition, the activation of CB 1 Rs decreases contractile performance in human atrial muscle [ ]. Overall, the physiological effects driven by CB 1 R activation are the result of neurogenic and local vascular effects on peripheral vascular resistance and cardiac output.
Cannabinoid 2 receptor (CB2R)
The human CB 2 R was cloned in 1993 from a human promyelocytic leukemic line HL60 cDNA library [ ]. The CB 2 R was believed initially to be restricted to the immune cell lineage [ ]. At the time that it was discovered, CB 2 Rs were thought to be a “peripheral receptor”. Later studies went on to show, however, that the CB 2 R is expressed at low levels in central and peripheral tissue under normal physiological conditions [ ] and up-regulated following inflammatory stimulation or tissue injury [ ]. In the cardiovascular system, the CB 2 R is present in endothelial cells [ ], the myocardium [ ], VSMCs and inflammatory cells (e.g. lymphocytes, macrophages, neutrophils) [ ].
The CB 2 R couples Gαi/o proteins and its activation leads to the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity and the activation of MAPK [ ]. Contrary to the CB 1 R, CB 2 R activation does not modulate ion channel function (reviewed in [ ]) and as a consequence CB 2 R-mediated increases in cytosolic Ca +2 are less pronounced [ ] (Fig. 1 ).
Studies using CB 2 R knockout mice suggest that these receptors may not be involved in the bradycardic and hypotensive response following an intravenous injection of cannabinoid agonists [ ]. Interestingly, compared to wild-type mice, CB 2 R deficiency results in increased intima formation, smooth muscle cell proliferation rates and expression of adhesion and proinflammatory substances [ ]. The reduced expression of CB 2 Rs compared to CB 1 Rs under healthy conditions, and its role in inflammation, suggests that the CB 2 R may play a more significant role in the disease state.
Other cannabinoid-like receptors
G-protein coupled receptor 18 (GPR18)
GPR18 was cloned and deorphanized from HUT 102 cells cDNAs [ ]. Early studies in mice lacking CB 1 R/CB 2 Rs confirmed the presence of GPR18, formerly called CB 3 R or “abnormal cannabidiol (Abn CBD) receptor” [ ]. With regards to the cardiovascular system, several reports confirmed its expression in the endothelium [ ]. Also, GPR18 is expressed centrally at the brainstem, in the RVLM [ ].
Similar to the abovementioned receptors, GPR18 couples Gαi/o proteins and its activation leads to the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase [ ]. It also enhances PI3K/Akt activation and ERK 1/2 signaling [ , ]. Notably, N-arachidonoylglycine (NAGly), an endogenous fatty acid with no CB 1 R or CB 2 R activity, appears to be an agonist for GPR18 [ ].
Studies in GPR18 deficient mice suggest that GPR18 is involved in endothelial cell migration [ ]. Contrary to CB 1 Rs, the central activation of GPR18 in the RVLM pre-sympathetic neurons contributes to the reduction of blood pressure [ ].
Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1)
The human TRPV1 was cloned in 1997 from a mammalian cell line [ ]. It is widely expressed in the cardiovascular system, including the sensory nerve fibers innervating the myocardium [ ], the myocardium [ ], endothelial cells [ ], VSMCs [ ] and platelets [ ].
TRPV1 is a non-selective cation channel that responds to ligands by altering the permeability to ions including H + , Na + , Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ [ ]. It has been proposed that TRPV1 activation triggers its local action in endothelium and sensory nerves through the phosphorylation of protein kinase A (PKA) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). This leads to nitric oxide (NO) production and the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P (SP) [ , , ] (Fig. 1 ). Interestingly, TRPV1 is activated by acid arachidonic derivatives (e.g. AEA), N-arachidonoyl dopamine (NADA) and phytocannabinoids (e.g. Δ 9 -THC or CBD) [ , ]. However, the classical, non-classical and aminoalkyndole CB 1 R/CB 2 R agonists such as 2-AG, HU-210, CP55,940 or WIN55,212-2 do not bind TRPV1 [ ].
Studies in TRPV1 knockout mice have demonstrated its involvement in stimulating the proinflammatory network [ ], mitochondrial function [ ], vasorelaxation [ ] and preservation of the heart structure and function [ ].
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)
Human PPARs are a family of three nuclear receptors; PPARα, PPARβ/δ and PPARγ that were cloned from a mouse cDNA library in 1990 [ ]. With regards to the cardiovascular system, a great number of studies have consistently reported the expression of all three PPARs in cardiomyocytes [ , , ], endothelial cells [ , , ] and VSMCs [ , , ]. Although PPARγ expression in the vagus nerve has been shown [ ], the role of PPARγ in the central regulation of cardiovascular function remains unclear.
PPARs belong to the family of ligand-activated transcription factors and thus all three receptors contain a N- and C-terminal, a ligand-binding domain (LBD), DNA-binding domain (DBD) and a flexible hinge region. A ligand-activated PPAR binds to a sequence-specific target in the promotor region of target genes, stimulating their expression [ ] (Fig. 1 ). A number of CB 1 R/CB 2 R agonists including AEA, 2-AG, phytocannabinoids (Δ 9 -THC and CBD) and the synthetic cannabinoids CP55,940 and WIN55,212-2 bind PPARs (reviewed in [ ]).
Studies using PPARα and PPARγ knockout mice demonstrate a role in cardiac remodeling, contractile function and blood pressure regulation [ , , ]. Interestingly, PPARγ-mediated effects by the eCBs/endovanilloids anandamide (AEA) and N-acyldopamines (NADA) depend on NO production and superoxide dismutase activity (SOD) [ ]. In addition, PPARγ agonists exhibit anti-inflammatory effects by hindering the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB which regulates the transcription of proinflammatory genes [ ]. PPAR β/δ deficient mice suggest a role in endothelial function [ ] and myocardial metabolism [ ]. Several mechanisms have been proposed for the antihypertensive effects of PPARs, including upregulation of eNOS activity, inhibition of angiotensin II type I receptor (AT 1 R) and attenuation of IL-6 or cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) (reviewed in [ ]).
Endogenous cannabinoids/vanilloids
Endogenous cannabinoids (or endocannabinoids, eCBs) consist of several lipid mediators that are associated with the cannabinoid system physiology and disease. The most studied eCBs belong to the family of acyl glycerols (2-arachydonoyl glycerol or 2-AG) and acyl ethanolamides (anandamide or AEA). In addition to eCBs, endogenous ligands targeting TRPV1 channels, commonly referred as endovanilloids, are involved in the cannabinoid and cannabinoid-like receptor signaling. Endovanilloid ligands include NADA, N-acyl amides (oleamide) and acyl amino acids (NAGly) [ ]. Endocannabinoids and endovanilloids are not stored in vesicles but secreted “on demand” in response to elevations of intracellular calcium levels [ ]. They are rapidly metabolized by the intracellular enzymes and have a short duration of action. Recently, endogenous peptidic ligands specific to CB 1 R, named hemopressins, have been identified [ ], but further studies are needed to explore their role in the physiology of the cardiovascular system. It is worth noting that some of the discrepancies between data obtained in vitro and in vivo for specific cannabinoid ligands indicate the existence of an “entourage effect”. The entourage effect hypothesis, first formulated in 1998 [ ], proposes that the effects by a specific eCB are in part due to the enhancement of the eCB actions exerted by an endogenous related compound [ ] (e.g. NADA increase AEA effects by inhibiting fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), the enzyme responsible for the degradation of AEA [ , ]).
Acyl-glycerols
2-arachidonoylglycerol
2-Arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) was the second eCB ligand to be identified [ ] and the most abundant in the CNS [ ]. It has also been identified in the heart [ ], endothelial cells [ ] and circulating cells such as macrophages [ ] and platelets [ ]. 2-AG is synthesized by the sequential hydrolysis of 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol by phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ), followed by the hydrolysis of the resulting diacylglycerol (DAG) by DAG lipase (DAGL) [ ]. 2-AG is primarily degraded by three hydrolytic enzymes: monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), α/β domain-containing hydrolase 6 (ABHD6) and α/β domain containing hydrolase 12 (ABHD12) [ ]. Also, 2-AG can be oxidized or hydrolyzed by COX-2 leading to the production of prostaglandin (PG) glycerol esters that are taken up by specific PG synthases to synthesize several mediators [ ].
2-AG behaves as a partial CB 1 R/CB 2 R agonist with a higher affinity and intrinsic activity for CB 1 R [ , ]. With regards to the physiological effect, 2-AG administration to anaesthetized rats induces hypotension and tachycardia [ , ], which could be due to an inhibition of noradrenaline release and acetylcholine release, respectively. This effect may be via CB 1 R activation [ ] or a CB 1 R independent mechanism that involves cyclooxygenase-catalyzed metabolism to other vasoactive compounds [ ]. To date, there are no studies showing the impact of DAGL deficiency in the cardiovascular system, however, studies in the CNS report a phenotype similar to mice lacking the CB 1 R [ ].
Acyl ethanolamides
Anandamide
Anandamide (AEA) was the first eCB to be discovered [ ] and the second most abundant in the CNS [ ]. In the cardiovascular system, it is present in ventricular myocytes [ ], endothelial cells [ ] and circulating cells such as macrophages [ ], platelets and leukocytes [ ]. Interestingly, it has been suggested that perivascular nerve endings innervating the adventitial surface of the vessels could be a source of AEA [ ]. Although both 2-AG and AEA contain arachidonic acid, however, their route of synthesis and degradation are mediated by different enzymes [ ]. Synthesis of AEA occurs by multiple pathways depending on the available precursors, tissue and the particular physiological or pathological condition [ ]. The major pathway of synthesis begins with the hydrolysis of N-arachidonoyl phophatidylethanol (NAPE) by NAPE-phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD) [ ]. FAAH is the main enzyme responsible for AEA degradation [ ], and N-acylethanolamine-hydrolyzing acid amidase also participates to a lesser extend [ ]. The oxidation by COX-2 leads to the production of PG ethanolamides [ ].
AEA exhibits a “dual” nature as a partial eCB CB 1 R/CB 2 R agonist, with greater affinity and intrinsic activity for CB 1 R and endovanilloid agonist activity due to its binding to TRPV1 [ , ]. Further, studies confirm that AEA can also activate PPARα and PPARγ [ , ]. The administration of AEA to anesthetized rodents produces short-lasting bradycardia and an initial increase in blood pressure followed by a prolonged decrease in blood pressure [ , ]. This response is blocked by the administration of a CB 1 R antagonist [ ] and is absent in CB 1 R knockout mice [ ]. However, further studies show that AEA also causes an initial hypotensive response that persists in CB 1 R and CB 2 R knockout mice, suggesting a role for TRPV1 in vasorelaxation [ , ].
The endocannabinoid system in cardiovascular diseases
Under normal physiological conditions, it is unlikely that the eCB system plays a major role in the regulation of cardiovascular function; however, several studies in animal models and humans support the upregulation of the eCB system in cardiovascular disease. It is worth noting that the statement “mice are not human” also applies to the cannabinoid system, and so it could also explain why animal experiments are not comparably successful as studies in humans. For example, the two cannabinoid receptor interacting proteins (CRIPs) that interact with the C-terminal tail of CB 1 R (CRIP1a and CRIP1b) in primates, appear to be restricted to CRIP1a in rodents [ ]. In this section, we will examine the impact of the eCB system in animal models and cardiovascular disorders such as hypertension, myocardial ischemia and atherosclerosis.
Some of the current strategies used to design new drugs will also be reviewed. Today's cannabinoid drug discovery focuses on searching for more receptor-selective compounds. For instance, eCB (e.g. AEA or 2-AG) and exogenous cannabinoids (e.g. Δ 9 -THC or WIN-55,212-2) exhibit a degree of agonist activity with other receptors [ ]. This promiscuity increases the complexity of cannabinoid signaling networks, thus the net effect may depend on the presence of ligands and targets in different tissues and disorders. In addition to this, the availability of different signaling assays has revealed that agonists couple the receptor in a manner that preferentially engages certain signaling interactions (e.g., G proteins) over others (e.g., β-arrestins), leading to selective transduction pathways [ ] and possibly different clinical results. This phenomenon is called biased signaling or functional selectivity. Some reports show that Δ 9 -THC is biased towards β-arrestin signaling [ ] for CB 1 Rs and towards cAMP inhibition for CB 2 Rs [ ]. As a result, the signaling repertoire of different cannabinoid agonists might differ from that of the native endogenous agonist, thus giving rise to a wide variety of signaling pathways and clinical outcomes.
The cannabinoid system in hypertension
An adequate blood pressure (BP) keeps the optimal blood flow to a given tissue so that it may fulfill its metabolic need. The regulation of BP is essentially the sum of neurogenic (autonomic nervous system), renal (renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system) and local mechanisms (endothelium) [ ] (Fig. 2 ). It is worth mentioning that the baroreceptor reflex, a homeostatic mechanism that keeps the BP at a constant level, depends on the interplay of BP and heart rate (HR) and is mediated by the autonomic nervous system. Briefly, an elevated BP causes a decrease in HR, buffering the increase in BP [ ]. High blood pressure or hypertension, regardless of its origin, is a condition in which there is either an increase in systemic vascular resistance (i.e. vascular remodeling leading to a state of vasoconstriction) or an increase in cardiac output, determined by heart rate and stroke volume resulting in an alteration of the baroreceptor reflex. Uncontrolled hypertension leads to damage of blood vessels and organs including the brain, heart and kidney. Fig. 2 Cannabinoid receptors in blood pressure regulation. Neural blood pressure (BP) regulation involves baroreceptors located in the arterial blood vessels, especially in the carotid sinus and aortic arch, which sense the BP and relay this information to the CNS structures at the hypothalamus (PVN) and brainstem (RVLM, CVLM, NAmb and NTS). These nuclei modulate BP through barosensitive efferents that control the heartbeat, the adrenal gland through the release of noradrenaline and changes in the caliber of the resistance arterioles supplying a tissue. Additionally, endothelial autocrine and paracrine substances play a role in regulating myocardial contractility and vascular tone. CB 1 R is located centrally at the PVN, RVLM, NTS and in the periphery at presynaptic terminals innervating the SA node, adrenal gland and resistance vessels, as well as the myocardium and the wall of resistance blood vessels (endothelium and tunica media ). TRPV1 is located mainly on sensory vagal afferents. CB 2 R and PPAR exert local effects through their location at the myocardium and resistance blood vessels (endothelium and tunica media ). PVN paraventricular nucleus, RVLM rostral ventrolateral medulla, CVLM caudal ventrolateral medulla, NAmb nucleus ambiguous, NTS nucleus tractus solitarius, IML intermediolateral nucleus, SA sinoatrial, VSMCs vascular smooth muscle cells
CB 1 R knockout mice and their wild-type littermates have similar BP levels [ ]. Further, the treatment of normotensive animals with CB 1 R antagonists does not have an effect on blood pressure levels [ ]. Taken together, observations indicate that the eCB system, or at least the CB 1 R-mediated effects, may not play a crucial role in the maintenance of BP levels under healthy conditions. However, a recent study showed that CB 2 R knockout mice develop hypertension [ ], challenging the aforementioned hypothesis. A number of studies have demonstrated an up-regulation of the cannabinoid system in hypertension. Indeed, CB 1 R expression is significantly increased in the RVLM and cardiac tissue and both CB 1 R and CB 2 R expression is increased in the aortic endothelium tissue of hypertensive rodents [ , , ]. The circulating levels of AEA are increased in hypertensive animals and patients with essential hypertension [ ]. Patients with sleep apnea and women with depression exhibit a positive correlation between blood pressure and the levels of AEA or both AEA and 2-AG, respectively [ , ]. However, women with preeclampsia (i.e. hypertension during pregnancy) have shown a decrease in the circulating levels of AEA [ ]. These contradictory results may be explained by the following: first, distinctly different disorders are the cause of the hypertension in these studies and second, the increased body mass index (BMI) is a factor that per se induces an overactivation of the eCB system and, therefore, could be a confounding factor [ ]. Moreover, the vasodilator and hypotensive effect of AEA and FAAH inhibitors is more pronounced in hypertensive animals, an effect that is blocked by a CB 1 R inhibitor whereas CB 2 R antagonists do not influence BP parameters [ , ]. Although AEA activates TRPV1, studies addressing the role of TRPV1 in the hypotensive effect of AEA are not consistent. This is likely due to the utilization of different animal models of hypertension or the use of different analogues of AEA [ , ]. Further, angiotensin II induces eCB release in both the CNS and the periphery. It increases 2-AG levels in the nucleus tractus solitarius (either by the increase of synthesis or decrease of degradation), in turn increasing blood pressure [ ]. Additionally, 2-AG activates CB 1 R-mediated vasorelaxation counteracting the vasoconstrictor effect of angiotensin II at the vascular wall [ ].
Targeting different brain regions produces opposite responses. For instance, the activation of CB 1 R in the RVLM in hypertensive rats increases BP, heart rate and sympathetic nerve activity [ ]. On the contrary, the activation of CB 1 R in the PVN has the opposite effect [ ]. The systemic administration of a CB 1 R antagonist with central and peripheral actions significantly reduces blood pressure, indicating that the resulting effect of central and peripheral CB 1 R blockade may be beneficial in hypertension [ ]. Unfortunately, the side effects that have been observed are sufficiently severe to discourage its use. More recently, the PPAR family has become a popular drug target that seems promising for the treatment of hypertension. Indeed, an early study demonstrated an up-regulation of PPARα and PPARγ in the aorta and mesenteric arteries of hypertensive animals [ ]. Several reports confirm that PPARα, PPARβ and PPARγ activation leads to a decrease in BP only in hypertensive animals, due to local effect in the arteries [ , ]. In addition, it has been reported that TRPV1 activation prevents the cardiac remodeling in hypertension through PPARγ upregulation [ ].
Cannabinoid-based drugs in hypertension
To date, with the exception of some PPAR agonists, no cannabinoid drugs have been approved to treat cardiovascular disease. There are a number of reasons to explain why the extensive published research in cannabinoid biology has not translated into clinical trials: the use of different animal paradigms giving different results (anesthetized vs conscious animals), the route of administration used (central vs systemically), the abovementioned complexity of cannabinoid signalling, the differences between species or the serious side-effects observed in clinical studies when the CB 1 R antagonist rimonabant or the FAAH inhibitor BIA-10-2474 were tested [ , , ]. The failure of rimonabant was probably due to the binding of the drug to mood-related nuclei within the brain [ ]. Regarding BIA-10-2474, a recent study showed that the clinical toxicity caused by this drug was probably not due to the FAAH inhibition but to the off-target activity on neuronal lipid metabolism networks [ ]. Indeed, other FAAH inhibitors such as PF-04457845 has been proven to be safe in humans [ ].
In healthy volunteers, the low-affinity CB 1 R/CB 2 R ligand cannabidiol reduces BP and increase HR [ ]. Ex vivo studies show that the non-selective CB 1 R/CB 2 R agonist CP55,940 induces vasorelaxation in human mesenteric arteries [ ]. This effect is lost when a CB 1 R antagonist is used, the endothelium removed or nitric oxide synthase inhibited. However, the use of the CB 2 R antagonist AM630, or after the desensitization of TRPV1 [ ], did not reverse this action. By contrast, an early study in rodents showed that the systemic administration of the selective CB 2 R agonist HU-308 had antihypertensive effects with no behavioural side effects [ ]. Experiments in ex vivo human mesenteric arteries with the same drug did not show a hypotensive effect [ ]. The long-term administration of the CB 2 R agonist AM1241 in a fibrosis-induced rat decreased inflammation, collagen production, angiogenesis and improved BP [ ]. Although this finding has not been tested in humans, AM1241 could be beneficial in hampering the remodelling that occurs in hypertension. Data on TRPV1 ligands show contradictory results. While the TRPV1 agonist capsaicin attenuates intracranial arteriole remodelling in rats [ ], one study in human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells suggests that it could aggravate pulmonary arterial hypertension [ ].
Another interesting approach is the use of FAAH inhibitors to increase the availability of eCBs. The FAAH inhibitor URB597 potentiates the effect of endogenous AEA by decreasing BP to almost normotensive values in hypertensive rats and improving ventricular hypertrophy [ ]. Furthermore, the use of URB597 prevents vascular remodeling and attenuates the vasoconstrictor response of a α1-adrenoceptor agonist, both mechanisms involved in the chronification of the hypertensive-mediated changes [ ]. The development of FAAH inhibitors, however, should be approached cautiously, especially considering the neurotoxicity of the abovementioned FAAH inhibitor [ ].
The PPARα agonist fenofibrate lowers BP in mice co-treated with angiotensin II [ ] and in humans decreases BP, although only in salt-sensitive hypertensive patients [ ]. The use of the PPAR β/δ agonist GW0742 induces both a decrease in BP and HR in hypertensive rodents and, similar to CB 2 R agonists, it reduces remodeling effects [ ]. The PPARγ agonist pioglitazone decreases BP in angiotensin II-dependent hypertensive rodents [ ], and similar results have been obtained in hypertensive patients [ ]. Several clinical trials have tested this drug in diabetic patients with hypertension but these results are yet to be published. Noteworthy, marketed drugs commonly used for hypertension such as AT 1 R blockers (e.g. candesartan, telmisartan) also stimulate the PPARγ [ ]. Despite the amount of preclinical and clinical data supporting the utility of these drugs in hypertension, the growth of tumors in several organs in rodents treated with some PPAR agonists has slowed down the development of new PPAR compounds [ ].
This volume of data suggests that the design of peripherally selective CB 1 R agonists could be a better approach to decrease BP with no CNS side effects. These drugs have already been tested in an animal model of pain [ ], but their impact on animal models of hypertension has not been explored. The antifibrogenic effect of CB 2 R agonists could potentially prevent the development of hypertension, however, caution is taken due to its distribution in the CNS and the possibility of psychiatric side effects in humans [ ]. With regards to FAAH inhibitors, further research is needed to ensure their safety before moving into clinical trials. At present, most studies in humans are focused on validating the use of marketed antidiabetic PPAR drugs in non-diabetic patients, alone or in combination with other antihypertensive drugs.
The cannabinoid system in myocardial ischemia
The primary function of the heart is to pump blood throughout the body via the circulatory system and to generate and sustain a BP necessary to provide adequate perfusion to organs [ ]. To achieve this, there is a consecutive contraction of the heart muscles in the two atrial chambers and ventricles that pump the blood out into the arteries. The amount of blood ejected (i.e. stroke volume) depends on the preload (i.e. venous return), contractility (i.e. sympathetic vs parasympathetic stimulation) and afterload (i.e. vascular resistance) [ ]. The occurrence of a sudden coronary artery occlusion, termed a myocardial infarction (MI), leads to an acute phase of myocardial necrosis and risk of arrhythmia followed by a chronic phase that involves heart remodeling (e.g. fibrosis and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy). These changes usually alter cardiac physiology leading to an increase rate of heart complications and ultimately increasing morbimortality. In the following section, we will summarize studies describing the role of eCBs during MI.
MI is known to induce the cardiopressor von Bezold-Jarisch reflex (BJR), a cardioprotective response that involves an increased parasympathetic tone (bradycardia, vasodilation and hypotension). This reflex is triggered by the activation of upregulated TRPV1 receptors on vagal nerve endings located in the left ventricle [ ]. It has been hypothesized that the hypotension phase following MI is secondary to the activation of endothelium and the presynaptic CB 1 Rs located on sympathetic nerve endings. This CB 1 R activation is mediated by AEA and 2-AG, both released from circulating monocytes and platelets [ ]. In patients with acute MI, increased levels of AEA and 2-AG, together with increased CB 1 R and CB 2 R expression, were reported in the tissue supplied by the occluded coronary artery [ , ]. Interestingly, CB 1 R knockout mice and the blockade of CB 1 R with rimonabant during acute heart failure increases mortality, likely associated with an increase in noradrenaline levels [ , ]. Further, eCBs acting on cannabinoid receptors may cause a shift in metabolism to anaerobic glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation, thereby protecting cells from necrosis [ ]. The underlying benefit of targeting CB 2 Rs involves a reduction of proinflammatory substances (e.g. adhesion molecules and chemokines) released by endothelial cells and leukocytes [ , ] and the enhanced expression of heat shock protein 72 (HSP72) in the heart [ ]. Regarding the TRPV1 receptor, one study showed that TRPV1 knockout mice exhibited an increased infarct size, excessive inflammation and altered ventricular remodeling, indicating that TRPV1-induced release of CGRP and SP could have a protective role in MI [ ]. Early evidence in animal models demonstrate a role for PPAR in myocardial ischemic events. For example, PPARα, PPAR β/δ and PPARγ agonists reduce infarct size, improve contractile dysfunction and remodeling, as well as significantly reducing the number of proinflammatory cells at the ischemic site [ , , , ].
In summary, mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of cannabinoid receptor activation during MI are: (1) the inhibition of noradrenaline release from the sympathetic nerve endings, (2) increased activation of parasympathetic efferents, (3) diminished activation of postsynaptic β-adrenoreceptors in the heart, (4) negative cardiac muscle contractility and (5) anti-inflammatory effects.
Cannabinoid-based therapies in myocardial infarction
In humans, chronic cannabis use is linked to acute coronary infarction, especially in combination with physical activity [ ]. The mechanism by which cannabis causes MI remains unknown, however, multiple hypotheses have been proposed (reviewed in [ ]). Studies in rodents show that pretreatment with 2-AG and AEA reduce infarct size when administered before ischemia [ , ]. AEA also reduces arrhythmic events [ ], suggesting that eCBs may exert a protective role. The use of CB 1 R-selective ligands for MI, however, is somewhat controversial. Treatment with the potent CB 1 R agonist HU-210 prevents endothelial dysfunction and the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias, but increases left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, which in turn increases the risk for developing heart failure [ , ]. On the contrary, the CB 1 R antagonist rimonabant when administrated daily reduces infarct size and improves systolic and diastolic heart function following coronary artery ligation [ ]. The CB 1 R/CB 2 R agonist WIN-55,212-2 and cannabidiol reduces infarct size and suppresses ventricular arrhythmias [ ], however, in another study the use of a CB 2 R antagonist blocks this protective effect [ ]. In addition, the use of either the selective CB 2 R agonist JWH-133 or CB 2 R knockout mice confirm the beneficial role of CB 2 R on ischemic cardiopathy [ ], suggesting that the protective effect on infarct size is presumably mediated by CB 2 R rather than the CB 1 R.
Several studies using capsaicin and other TRPV1 agonists demonstrate a cardioprotective role for these drugs when used prior to myocardial injury, supporting the role of TRPV1 in MI [ , , ]. Early evidence in animal models demonstrate a role for PPAR in myocardial ischemic events. The PPARα and PPARγ agonists, fenofibrate and rosiglitazone, reduce the infarct size, improve contractile dysfunction and remodeling, and the latter also induces a significant reduction in proinflammatory cells at the ischemic site [ , ]. The clinical trials PROactive and EMPA-REG demonstrated successfully the superiority of pioglitazone or empagliflozin vs. the placebo in preventing the occurrence of MI in patients with diabetes mellitus [ , ]. The positive data obtained with the PPARβ/δ agonist GW0742 is yet to be tested in humans.
Although there is evidence that discourages the use of cannabis-like and CB 1 R-selective drugs to prevent or treat MI, animal studies indicate that CB 2 R and TRPV1 are promising targets. Further research, however, is required to confirm their efficacy and possible side effects. Clinical studies on diabetic patients found thiazolidinediones effective, safe and well-tolerated, advocating their potential indication for MI prevention in the diabetic population at risk.
The cannabinoid system in atherosclerosis
Atherosclerosis is a slowly progressing inflammatory systemic disorder that affects large and medium-sized arteries, causing wall thickening with a subsequent decrease in the artery diameter (i.e. estenosis). The thickening of the wall begins with endothelial dysfunction, caused by local and systemic inflammatory mediators. This is characterized by the accumulation of atherogenic lipids (oxidized LDL) in macrophages and VSMCs (foam cells) [ ], leading to lipid storage together with infiltration of T cells (Fig. 3 ). This condition ultimately leads to ischemia (i.e. decreased blood supply) affecting any artery in the body. Depending on the artery affected, the organs affected include the brain (cerebrovascular disease), heart (coronary artery disease), kidney and lower extremities. Atherosclerosis remains asymptomatic until it becomes severe enough to obstruct the arterial blood flow or unstable atherosclerotic plaques rupture, triggering thrombosis and thus ischemic events with devastating consequences [ , ]. Fig. 3 The endocannabinoid system in atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease of large- and medium-sized arterial walls, precipitated by high levels of low-density lipoproteins (LDL). LDLs are transported across the endothelium where they initiate lipid oxidation (oxLDL) contributing to endothelial damage. OxLDL (represented by yellow circles) induces the activation of proinflammatory genes, causing monocytic infiltration and inflammatory cell recruitment. Activated neutrophils and T-cells release cytokines (represented by red circles) that promote monocyte differentiation into macrophages and VSMCs migration into the lesion. Both macrophages and VSMCs take up oxLDL and form foam cells. CB 1 R and CB 2 R are present in the endothelium, monocytes, T-cells and VSMCs. CB 2 R has been also identified in neutrophils. TRPV1 and PPAR are located in the endothelium and VSMCs. The endocannabinoids AEA and 2-AG (represented by green and blue circles, respectively) are increased in the lumen and in the core of the plaque. VSMCs vascular smooth muscle cells, LDL low density lipoprotein
Numerous studies have explored the role of the eCB system in regions involved in atherogenesis such as the endothelium, VSMCs and inflammatory cells. AEA and 2-AG are significantly increased in the aortic wall of mice fed with a high-fat diet and in the plasma of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) [ , ]. Moreover, enhanced levels of AEA and 2-AG in FAAH and MAGL knockout animals, respectively, are protective against atherosclerosis [ , ]. The increase of CB 1 R in the VSMCs of mice fed a high-fat diet is correlated with the upregulation of the AT 1 R expression, which activates NADPH oxidase and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production [ ]. One study showed a high expression of CB 1 R in macrophages infiltrating atheromatous plaques in patients with CAD [ ] and a later study showed that CB 1 R upregulation is correlated with the increase of ROS production [ ]. While both CB 1 R and CB 2 R are also expressed in T-cells [ ], studies in mice and human atheromatous plaques reveal a higher expression of CB 2 R in macrophages and infiltrating T-cells [ , ]. The role of PPARs in atherosclerosis progression has not been fully elucidated. Animal and human studies have shown that PPARα and PPARγ are upregulated in atheromatous plaques [ , ] and the expression levels correlate positively to the severity of the lesion. Interestingly, it has been reported that oxidized lipids activate PPARα and PPARγ, suggesting a self-regulation mechanism to control the progression of atherosclerosis [ ]. Although PPARγ is expressed in endothelial cells, macrophages and mononuclear cells and VSMCs of atheromatous plaques in patients, only VSMCs show a significant increase in PPARγ [ ] [ ].
Cannabinoid-based therapies in atherosclerosis
A pionner study exploring the benefit of cannabinoid therapy for atherosclerosis showed that low doses of the CB 1 R/CB 2 R agonist Δ 9 -THC inhibits the progression of atheromatous lesions in mice [ ]. In contrast, the blockade of CB 1 R with rimonabant did not affect the size of atheromatous plaques [ ] or improve endothelial function [ ]. In humans, the clinical trials STRADIVARIUS and AUDITOR, where the antiatheromatous effect of rimonabant was tested in a population with abdominal obesity and metabolic syndrome, showed no decrease in the thickness of the coronary or carotid wall [ , ]. Furthermore, studies on human coronary artery endothelial cells have shown that the stimulation of CB 1 R with AEA or HU-210, increases the production of ROS and MAPK activation, leading to endothelial cell injury [ ]. In addition, the stimulation of VSMCs in mice with the CB 1 R/CB 2 R agonist CP55,940 is associated with an upregulation of AT 1 R expression [ ] and this effect is blocked by a CB 1 R antagonist but not a CB 2 R antagonist. Conversely, in mice administered with Δ 9 -THC, the blockade of CB 2 R by SR144528 abolished the anti-atherosclerotic properties of Δ 9 -THC, indicating a major role for CB 2 R over CB 1 R in atherosclerosis [ ]. CB 2 R activation by JWH-133 or HU-308 attenuates the inflammatory response to TNF-α in endothelial cells leading to a decreased expression of adhesion molecules (intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1) and chemokines (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1), all of which are involved in the migration and infiltration of monocytes/macrophages [ ]. The apparent dichotomy of the CB 1 R and CB 2 R on endothelial function is correlated with the cannabinoid drug effects on inflammatory cells [ ]. Interestingly, the use of the CB 1 R antagonist rimonabant or the CB 2 R agonist JWH-015 in macrophages is associated with a decrease in anti-inflammatory cytokines and ROS generation [ , ]. CB 2 R activation with JWH-133 and HU-308 increases phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, attenuates TNF-α-triggered proliferation and migration of VSMCs, and other proinflammatory related pathways [ ]. In addition, the beneficial effects of CB 2 R activation in T cells infiltrating the atheromatous plaque are possibly due to the suppression of T cell proliferation, decrease of interferon-γ and an anti-inflammatory Th2 cytokine shift [ , ]. Regarding TRPV1, capsaicin impedes foam cell formation in VSMCs [ ], and a recent study shows that the activation of endothelial TRPV1 with capsaicin suppresses the inflammatory response in human endothelial cells by NO production, characterized by a decrease in proinflammatory cytokines generation and adhesion molecules expression [ ]. The activation of PPARα and PPARγ with fenofibrate/GW7647 or pioglitazone/rosiglitazone, respectively, inhibits foam-cell formation through different pathways, regulates cholesterol trafficking and limits the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in T cells, whereas PPARβ activation by GW0742 failed to hamper lesion formation in another study [ , , ]. These results prompted the development of dual PPARα/γ agonists. With the exception of saroglitazar, however, none of these agents have been marketed due to severe side effects (reviewed in [ ]).
These preclinical studies provide the basis for the study of compounds targeting CB 2 R and TRPV1 in humans. The efficacy and safety of the dual PPARα/γ agonist saroglitazar in humans introduces a new era for the development of dual-acting compounds for patients with atherosclerosis.
Conclusions and future directions
A number of animal and human studies suggest that the eCB system plays several important roles in a variety of cardiovascular disorders. Over the years, while the development of highly selective drugs to manipulate the eCB system offers promising results, new therapeutic approaches could lead to major breakthroughs in the management of cardiovascular diseases. For instance, pepcan-12, an endogenous CB 2 R positive allosteric modulator (i.e. a drug that binds the allosteric site of the receptor enhancing the action of the endogenous ligand), has demonstrated improvements in ischemia reperfusion damage [ ]. While this field is still emerging, allosteric modulators provide high selectivity and novel modes of efficacy. Another innovative strategy is the design of peripherally-restricted cannabinoid drugs, as discussed in Sect. Cannabinoid-based drugs in hypertension. These drugs do not cross the blood–brain barrier and thus are devoid of CNS-related side effects. Also, counteracting the lipophilicity nature of cannabinoids by developing water-soluble compounds would potentially increase the bioavailability, potency and onset of action at lower doses [ ]. Other potential areas of drug development involve the use of bivalent compounds which contain hybridized structures that target receptor-receptor interactions (i.e. receptor heteromers) such as CB 1 R-AT 1 R [ ].
While the vast majority of studies have focused on the role of CB 1 R, CB 2 R, TRPV1 and PPARs, far less is known about other candidates such as GPR18, GPR55 and GPR119. Although our understanding of the eCB system has skyrocketed in a very short time, the unexpected devastating side effects found in two clinical trials have raised concern about the occurrence of harmful effects. Lessons from clinical experience should encourage the scientific community and pharmaceutical companies to work hand-in-hand to develop more effective drugs devoid of neurological, carcinogenic or cardiovascular toxicity.
