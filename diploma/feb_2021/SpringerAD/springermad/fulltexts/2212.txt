Introduction
Apomorphine is a dopamine-receptor agonist with high affinity for all known dopamine receptors (D 1 , D 2 , D 3 , D 4 , and D 5 ) [ ]. This substance has been used in the treatment of different diseases, including Parkinson’s disease (PD) [ , , ], erectile dysfunction [ ], and alcohol dependency [ ]. Additionally, apomorphine administration is used in a research model of drug dependency known as apomorphine sensitization [ , , ]. These uses of apomorphine are based on its non-specific stimulation of the dopaminergic system. In the central nervous system (CNS), the dopaminergic system is involved in motor, motivational, emotional, and cognitive functions. Anatomically, two major groups of dopaminergic cells exist in the midbrain: those in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) that project to the cortical and limbic areas via the mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways, and those in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) that project to the striatum via the nigrostriatal pathway [ , , ]. Significantly, malfunctions of the dopaminergic system has been implicated in PD, schizophrenia, depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and drug addiction [ ].
Repeated administration of psycho-stimulants with dopamine activity (e.g., apomorphine, amphetamine, methamphetamine, or cocaine) enhances locomotor activity, a phenomenon known as behavioral sensitization [ , , , , , ]. Moreover, locomotor activity is correlated with reward and incentive motivational processes [ ], which according to the incentive sensitization theory are processes associated with addiction [ ]. This theory focuses on how addictive drugs alter the neural circuits involved in motivational and reward associated behaviors, causing compulsive drug seeking, drug taking, and relapse. Indeed, exposure to addictive drugs is known to hyperactivate the dopaminergic system, mainly via the mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways, sensitizing them and producing a pathological “yearning” for drugs [ , , ].
In terms of research into addiction and the treatment of diseases caused by dopaminergic malfunction, the main focus has been on the nigrostriatal, mesocortical, or mesolimbic pathways, these representing the main sources of dopaminergic innervation to the cerebral cortex, nucleus accumbens (NAc), and striatum (ST). Conversely, structures like the hippocampus have been little studied. Recently, the hippocampus was shown to receive dopaminergic innervation from the VTA that may be involved in long-term potentiation (LTP) and spatial memory [ , , , ], although the effect of non-selective dopamine receptor activation in the hippocampus remains essentially unknown.
Here, we studied the effect of non-selective dopamine receptor activation on behavior and plasticity in the hippocampus, checking for the possible morphological effects and cell damage mediated by apomorphine. As such, adult mice were chronically administered apomorphine (1 mg/kg for 15 days), and the effects on memory and learning, synaptic plasticity, dendritic length, inflammatory responses, and oxidative stress were evaluated. We found that apomorphine affects spatial learning and memory, it prevents the induction of LTP at CA3-CA1 synapses, it shortens dendrites, and it increases the number of reactive astrocytes and the presence of oxidative stress biomarkers. These results indicate that non-selective dopaminergic receptor activation by apomorphine modifies neurons and their milieu in the hippocampus.
Materials and Methods
Animals
The experiments described in this work were carried out on fifty-four 2-month-old C57BL/6 male mice (25–35 g) obtained from Harlan Laboratories (Spain) and from the BUAP animal facility (Mexico). The animals were housed individually in a controlled environment on a 12 h light-dark cycle, and with free access to food and water. All the animal procedures described in this study were performed in accordance with the European Union Directive 2010/63/EU on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes and in agreement with the “Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” of the Mexican Council for Animal Care (NOM-062-ZOO-1999), and they were approved by the local Ethical Committees. All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering and to reduce the number of animals used.
Apomorphine Administration
The animals were randomly divided into two groups ( n = 27 per group), and while the experimental group was administered (R)-(-)-apomorphine hydrochloride (Tocris Bioscience), the control group received the vehicle alone (1 mL/kg of saline solution). Mice were administered one intra-peritoneal (i.p.) injection of apomorphine daily on 15 consecutive days at a dose of 1 mg/kg [ , , , ].
Morris Water-Maze Test
One day after the last apomorphine injection, the animals ( n = 10/group) were tested in a Morris Water-Maze Test (MWT), as described previously [ ]. A black circular pool, 80 cm in diameter and 80 cm high, was filled to a height of 42 cm with water at 28.0 ± 2.0 °C, and the water was made opaque by adding 0.01% of white titanium oxide. The walls of the test room surrounding the pool contained several distinctive, geometric external cues that were visible to the mice when they were in the maze. The pool was divided into four quadrants, and four points were designated as the starting positions (North, South, East, or West). An escape platform (8 cm diameter and 40 cm high) was situated inside the pool, and it was located at a constant position in the middle of one quadrant, equidistant from the center and the edge of the pool, submerged 2 cm below the surface of the water. On the platform trial days, each animal was placed in the water facing the wall of the tank at one of the four possible start locations. The order of the starting points was varied each day, and any given sequence was not repeated during the acquisition or training phase. Mice underwent four trials/day, with a 50 min inter-trial interval, a protocol that was repeated on five consecutive days. Mice were allowed 90 s to search for the platform, and they were gently guided to it when they did not reach the target on their own. Once the mice found the platform, they were allowed to remain there for 15 s before they were returned to their home cage. When mice were unable to find the platform within 90 s, the training session was terminated and the maximum score of 90 s was assigned to the mice. Two variables were measured: the time to find the platform (or the time to cross over the platform location in the memory test) and the time spent in the target quadrant.
In the memory test performed 7 days after training, the platform was removed. The animals were subjected to a single memory test, and the variables evaluated were the latency to pass over where the platform had been located and the time spent in the target quadrant. The trials were recorded using a video-camera mounted above the center of the pool (Sony HD, HDR-CX190).
Electrophysiology
Slice Preparation
Mice were anesthetized ( n = 3 in the control and apomorphine group) with isoflurane (2%) and decapitated prior to preparing the hippocampal slices, as described previously [ , , ]. Briefly, the whole brain was removed and placed into an ice-cold solution containing (in mM) the following: NaCl 126, KCl 3, NaH 2 PO 4 1.25, MgSO 4 2, CaCl 2 2, NaHCO 3 26, and glucose 10 (pH = 7.2, 300 mOsm/L). The brain was situated on the stage of a vibrating blade microtome (Leica VT1000S), and coronal transverse hippocampal slices (350 μm thick) were obtained and maintained continuously oxygenated (95% O 2 /5% CO 2 ) in this solution for at least 1 h before use. All experiments were carried out at room temperature (22–25 °C), and during the experiments, the slices were continuously superfused with the solution described above.
Electrophysiology Recordings
Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were recorded with low-resistance glass pipettes filled with the external solution and situated in the CA1 field of the hippocampus. Potentials were evoked by applying electrical pulses through a monopolar electrode placed in the stratum radiatum . Synaptic field potentials were elicited at a frequency of 0.2 Hz, and the slope of the recorded fEPSP was calculated and used as a measure of synaptic strength. After a stable fEPSP baseline period of 10 min, a LTP protocol was induced by stimulating Schaffer collateral fibers at 100 Hz for 1 s. Post-protocol recordings were continued for 60 min, and LTP was considered to be successfully induced when the average fEPSP slope (measured 50–60 min after LTP) increased by at least 20% relative to the baseline (100%). The fEPSPs were recorded at 2 kHz using an Axopatch 200B apparatus (Molecular Devices), acquired at 10 kHz. To evaluate the effect of apomorphine on LTP, we incubated the slices for 30 min in a perfusion solution containing 20 μM apomorphine before starting electrophysiological recordings. This solution remained present for the duration of the experiment.
Morphology
Golgi-Cox Staining
After 15 days of apomorphine administration, the mice ( n = 6 per group) were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (75 mg/kg body weight, i.p.) and they were perfused intracardially with 0.9% saline solution. After sacrificing, the brain was removed and stained using the modified Golgi-Cox method, as described previously [ , ]. Coronal vibratome sections of the dorsal hippocampus (DH, 200 μm thick) were obtained (Campden Instrument, MA752, Leicester, UK), and they were collected in the presence of ammonium hydroxide for 30 min. After 30 min in Kodak Film Fixer and a final rinse with distilled water, the sections were mounted in resin [ , ].
Microscopy and Sholl Analysis
Pyramidal cells from the dorsal CA1 (plate 29–37 of the Paxinos and Watson Atlas, 1986 [ ]) were studied here. Neurons from both the left and right hippocampal formation of each animal were recorded by camera lucida at a magnification of ×250 (DMLS, Leica Microscope) by trained observer who was blind to the experimental conditions [ ]. Pyramidal neurons were readily identified by their characteristic triangular soma, apical dendrites, and numerous dendritic spines. Sequential two-dimensional reconstructions of the entire dendritic tree were generated for each neuron, and the dendritic traces were quantified by a Sholl analysis [ ] as follows: A transparent grid with equidistant (10 μm) concentric rings was centered over the traces of the dendritic tree, and the number of ring intersections was used to estimate the total dendritic length and dendritic arborization [ , , , , ]. The total number of dendritic branches (branching indicated by Y bifurcation), another estimate of dendritic arborization, was counted at each order away from the cell body or dendritic shaft.
Histological Examination
Mice were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (75 mg/kg body weight, i.p., n = 4 per group) and perfused intracardially with 50 mL of a 0.9% saline solution and 50 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). The animal’s brain was removed and post-fixed in the PFA for 48 h. Coronal cryostat sections (20 μm thick, Leica) were taken from each brain at the level of the anterior temporal area.
Immunohistochemistry
Hippocampal sections were immunostained by first blocking non-specific binding sites with 2% IgG-free bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma) and then incubating the tissue with 0.2% Triton X-100. The sections were then incubated overnight at 4–8 °C with a primary antibody against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP 1:500, Dako, Denmark) to label astrocytes, followed by an anti-rabbit FITC-labeled secondary antibody (1:100, Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories Inc.). The nuclei were counterstained with VectaShield DAPI (Vector Labs), and photomicrographs of the CA1, CA3, and dentate girus (DG) hippocampal subfields were obtained on a fluorescence microscope (Leica Microsystems). In the microphotomicrographs, the number of cells immunoreactive to GFAP was quantified in the CA1, CA3, and DG hippocampal subfields over an area corresponding to 500 μm 2 . The number of cells immunoreactive to anti-GFAP was considered as the criterion to define reactive astrocytes [ ]. All counting was carried out blind to the experimental treatment by an expert in morphology.
Assay of the Redox Balance
The hippocampus isolated from four mice per group was homogenized mechanically in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 12,500 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C in a 17TR microcentrifuge (Hanil Science Industrial Co., Ltd; Inchon, Korea). Nitric oxide (NO) production was assessed through the accumulation of nitrites (NO 2 − ) in the supernatants of homogenates using a colorimetric Griess approach, as described previously [ ]. The supernatant (100 μL) was added to Griess reagent (100 μL), which was composed of equal volumes of 0.1% N -(1-naphthy) ethylenediamine dihydrochloride and 1.32% sulfanilamide in 60% acetic acid. The absorbance of the samples was determined at 540 nm in a Stat Fax 2600 plate reader (WinerLab Group) and compared to a standard curve of NaNO 2 (1 to 10 μM) to calculate the nitrite content.
Malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxyalkenals (4HDA) were measured in the hippocampal supernatants following the method described elsewhere [ ]. Accordingly, 200 μL of supernatant was added to 0.650 mL of a 10.3 mM solution of N -methyl-2phenyl indole diluted in a mixture of acetonitrile/methanol (3:1). The reaction was started by adding methanesulfonic acid (150 μL) to quantify MDA, or chlorhydric acid 35% (150 μL) to measure 4HDAs. The reaction mixture was vortexed strongly and incubated at 45 °C for 1 h prior to centrifuging at 3000 rpm for 10 min. The absorbance was read at 586 nm in a Lamda EZ-150 (PerkinElmer company) and compared to a standard curve of 0.5 to 5 μM 1,1,3,3-tetramethoxypropane (10 mM stock) to calculate the MDA and 4HDA content of the samples.
The total glutathione (GSH) content in the hippocampus was measured by the enzymatic recycling technique [ ]. The assay is based on the reaction of GSH with 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid, DTNB) that produces the 5′-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid (TNB) chromophore (with a maximal absorbance at 412 nm) and the oxidized GSH–TNB adduct. The rate of TNB formation measured at 412 nm is proportional to the concentration of GSH in the sample. The disulfide product (GSH–TNB) is then reduced by glutathione reductase in the presence of NADPH, recycling GSH back into the reaction. The amount of glutathione measured represents the sum of the reduced and oxidized glutathione in the sample ([GSH]total = [GSH] + 2 × [GSSG]). The rate of change in absorbance (∆A412 nm/min) is linearly proportional to the total concentration of GSH. The concentration of an unknown sample can be determined by calculating from the linear equation generated from the standard curve of GSH. The glutathione disulfide (GSSG) reductase recycling method was used to determine the GSSG levels by spectrophotometrically monitoring NADPH by the Griffith’s method [ ]. The hippocampal extracts are treated with 2-vinylpyridine, which covalently reacts with GSH but not GSSG. The excess 2-vinylpyridine was neutralized with triethanolamine, and the GSSG was then recycled by glutathione reductase, determining its concentration by the enzymatic recycling technique as described above.
Statistical Analysis
The results of all the experiments were expressed as the mean ± standard error (S.E.M.), and comparisons were made with an unpaired Student’s t test, considering p < 0.05 as significant. The data of dendritic length and the MWT were analyzed using a two-way ANOVA and the Bonferroni post hoc test.
Results
Apomorphine Impairs Spatial Learning and Memory
The WMT is a well-known behavioral test related to hippocampal functioning [ ], and it was used to evaluate the effect of apomorphine on learning and memory. One day after the last apomorphine administration (day 16), we evaluated the time taken by the mice to find the hidden platform. While this time decreased over the course of acquisition training in both experimental groups, the average latency to find the hidden platform increased significantly from day 5 of treatment in the apomorphine group (44.5 ± 5.3 s, n = 10) relative to the controls (16.7 ± 2.1 s, n = 10: Fig. 1 a). In the memory test session performed 7 days after the last training session, the hidden platform was removed and the time the mice required to cross the target quadrant where the platform had been situated was measured. There was a significant increase in this parameter when the mice had been administered apomorphine (53.7 ± 4.7 s, n = 10) relative to those that received the vehicle alone (39.0 ± 4.1 s, n = 10, p = 0.0227: Fig. 1 b). In addition, the mice that received apomorphine spent significantly less time in the target quadrant where the hidden platform had been situated (25.3 ± 2.1 s, n = 10) than those that received the vehicle alone (32.9 ± 1.9 s, n = 10, p = 0.0106: Fig. 1 c). These results indicate that the non-selective activation of dopamine receptors by apomorphine directly affects spatial learning and memory in the hippocampus. Fig. 1 The administration of apomorphine induces a deficit in spatial learning and memory. Learning and memory were evaluated using the Morris Water Maze. The latency to find the escape platform ( a ), to first cross the target quadrant ( b ), and the time spent in the target quadrant ( c ) were measured. Panels b and c were used to evaluate long-term memory. The error bars represent the S.E.M., and the number of experiments (mice) is shown in parentheses. a A repeated two-way ANOVA showed an increase in the apomorphine group (treatment, F 4, 156 = 29.06, p < 0.0001; day F 1, 39 = 8.614, p = 0.0056; interaction F 4, 156 = 4.583, p = 0.0016), and the Bonferroni post hoc test revealed the significance between groups for each day: * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.005. b An unpaired Student’s t test indicated an increase in the apomorphine group ( t = 2.325, * p = 0.0227). c The unpaired Student’s t test indicated an increase in the time spent in the target quadrant in the apomorphine group ( t = 2.626, * p = 0.0106)
Non-selective Activation of Dopamine Receptors by Apomorphine in the Hippocampus Prevents LTP Induction
To characterize synaptic plasticity in both apomorphine and vehicle-treated mice, we studied LTP at Schaffer collateral-CA1 hippocampal synapses. We recorded and monitored the fEPSPs evoked by extracellular stimulation of Schaffer collaterals in the stratum radiatum of the CA1 region of hippocampal slices [ , ]. The fEPSPs were recorded at 0.2 Hz during baseline and after LTP, which was induced using a 100 Hz, 1 s protocol. While this protocol induced robust LTP in untreated slices (176 ± 14%, n = 7: Fig. 2 a, b), the same protocol failed to induce LTP in slices exposed to apomorphine (20 μM; 76 ± 14%, n = 6: Fig. 2 a, b). Hence, the non-selective activation of dopamine receptors by apomorphine appears to prevent the induction of LTP in the hippocampal CA1. Fig. 2 The non-selective activation of dopamine receptors by apomorphine prevents LTP induction in the hippocampus. a A 100 Hz, 1 s protocol induced robust LTP at CA3-CA1 synapses. Bath application of apomorphine (20 μM) completely prevented the induction of LTP. The time course of fEPSPs in control conditions (black triangles) and in the presence of apomorphine (gray triangles) is shown. The inset shows traces of the fEPSP before (1) and 60 min after (2) the LTP protocol in control conditions and in the presence of apomorphine (20 μM, 1′ and 2′). b Summary of the results, where the error bars represent the S.E.M. and the number of experiments is shown in parentheses. b Unpaired Student’s t test showed a decrease in the presence of apomorphine ( t = 5.025, *** p = 0.0004)
Non-selective Dopamine Receptor Activation by Apomorphine Shortens the Total Dendritic Length
To determine the effect of non-selective activation of dopamine receptors on the morphology of CA1 pyramidal neurons, the dendritic branching, dendritic arbor, and total dendritic length of these neurons were assessed after Golgi-Cox staining. Treatment with apomorphine provoked a decrease in the total dendritic length (935.66 ± 61.02 μm, n = 6) compared to the mice that received the vehicle alone (1240.40 ± 60.05 μm, n = 6, p = 0.0065: Fig. 3 a, b, d). In addition, a dendritic branching analysis identified a decrease in second (261.50 ± 23.07 μm in the apomorphine-treated mice vs 333.80 ± 18.19 μm in vehicle-treated group, n = 6, p < 0.01), third (318.16 ± 23.80 μm in apomorphine-treated group vs 466.60 ± 25.29 μm in vehicle-treated group, n = 6, p < 0.005), and fourth (204.33 ± 28.95 μm in apomorphine-treated group vs 280.80 ± 25.15 μm in vehicle-treated group, n = 6, p < 0.005, Fig. 3 a, b, c)-order branches in response to apomorphine administration relative to their respective control groups. Finally, the dendritic arborization analysis showed a decrease in the dendritic length at the level of the sixth circle (10.56 ± 0.78 intersections in the apomorphine-treated mice vs 13.10 ± 0.22 intersections in vehicle-treated group vs n = 6, p < 0.01), seventh circle (9.84 ± 0.82 in apomorphine-treated group vs 13.16 ± 0.33 intersections in vehicle-treated group, n = 6, p < 0.005), eighth circle (8.92 ± 0.74 intersections in apomorphine-treated group vs 12.80 ± 0.51 intersections in vehicle-treated group, n = 6, p < 0.001), ninth circle (7.38 ± 0.76 intersections in apomorphine-treated group vs 11.46 ± 0.54 intersections in vehicle-treated group, n = 6, p < 0.001), tenth circle (5.82 ± 0.64 intersections in apomorphine-treated group vs 9.90 ± 0.55 intersections in vehicle-treated group, n = 6, p < 0.001), eleventh circle (4.22 ± 0.53 intersections in apomorphine-treated group vs 8.16 ± 0.69 intersections in vehicle-treated group, n = 6, p < 0.001), and twelfth circle (3.12 ± 0.46 intersections in apomorphine-treated group vs 5.72 ± 0.89 intersections in vehicle-treated group, n = 6, p < 0.001, Fig. 3 a, b, e) in the apomorphine-treated animals compared to vehicle-treated mice. These results indicate that apomorphine produced morphological changes that included a decrease in the total dendritic length and a decrease in second, third, and fourth branch orders.

Apomorphine Provokes an Inflammatory Response in the Hippocampus
It has been suggested that apomorphine injections cause an inflammatory response and an increase in reactive astrocytes in different brain areas [ ]. To determine whether apomorphine induced such an inflammatory response in our experimental conditions, we assessed GFAP immunoreactivity in the CA1, CA3, and DG areas of the hippocampus. Apomorphine administration was associated with an increase in GFAP immunoreactivity in the CA1, CA3, and DG subfields of the hippocampus. In the CA1 subfield, apomorphine produced a significant increase in the number of GFAP immunoreactive cells (9.6 ± 0.4) compared with the vehicle-treated mice (6.1 ± 0.5 reactive cells, n = 4, p < 0.0001: Fig. 4 a, b). Apomorphine produced a similar significant increase in GFAP immunoreactive cells (18.2 ± 1.5) in the DG subfield of hippocampus relative to the vehicle-treated group (13.7 ± 1.4, n = 4, p = 0.0483), as in the CA3 subfield (8.3 ± 0.8 reactive cells in the apomorphine-treated group vs 5.8 ± 0.7 in vehicle-treated group, n = 4, p = 0.0431: Fig. 4 a, b). Fig. 4 Apomorphine administration induces an inflammatory response in the hippocampus. a Photomicrographs showing the GFAP immunoreactivity (green color) in the CA1, CA3, and DG areas of the hippocampus in control (vehicle) and apomorphine-treated animals. b The number of GFAP-positive cells in both groups (vehicle and apomorphine-treated). The unpaired Student’s t tests showed an increase in the apomorphine group for the CA1 subfield ( t = 5.750, **** p < 0.0001), for the CA3 subfield ( t = 2.224, * p = 0.0431), and for the DG subfield ( t = 2.149, * p = 0.0483) relative to the control mice. The error bars represent the S.E.M. with a n = 4 per group
Apomorphine Induces an Oxidative Response in the Hippocampus
Oxidative stress is defined as the imbalance of pro-oxidant and anti-oxidant molecules, and it potentially causes DNA damage, protein adducts, and lipid peroxidation [ ]. It has been suggested that apomorphine may cause oxidative stress [ ], although this has not yet been studied in the hippocampus. To determine whether apomorphine induced oxidative stress in the hippocampus under our experimental conditions, the concentrations of NO were assessed. NO produces peroxynitrite, a nitrating agent, and the strong oxidants, MDA and 4HDA, which are formed when the membrane is damaged or the tissue injured [ , ]. The production of GSH was also evaluated, an antioxidant that helps cells respond to oxidative stress, as was the oxidized form of GSH, GSSG, which is related to the amount of glutathione that is used to counteract antioxidants [ , ].
When the NO levels were evaluated, a significant 3.5-fold increase was found in the mice that received apomorphine (2.07 ± 0.14 μM/mg of protein) compared with those that received the vehicle alone (58 ± 0.08 μM/mg of protein, n = 4 mice, p < 0.0001: Fig. 5 a). In addition, the MDA and 4HDA levels increased significantly, corresponding to a 2.7-fold (1.04 ± 0.13 μM/mg of protein in apomorphine-treated group vs 0.38 ± 0.04 μM/mg of protein in vehicle-treated group, n = 4 mice, p = 0.0026) and 2-fold increase (0.49 ± 0.05 μM/mg of protein in the apomorphine-treated group vs 0.25 ± 0.02 μM/mg of protein in vehicle-treated group, n = 4 mice, p = 0.0084: Fig. 5 b, c), respectively. Conversely, apomorphine significantly reduced the GSH levels (2.65 ± 0.14 μM/mg of protein) relative to the control mice (4.07 ± 0.15 μM/mg of protein n = 4 mice, p = 0.0005: Fig. 5 d), whereas there was 2-fold increase in GSSG in mice administered apomorphine (0.16 ± 0.012 μM/mg of protein) relative to those that received the vehicle alone (0.08 ± 0.002 μM/mg of protein, n = 4 mice, p = 0.0011: Fig. 5 e). Together, these results indicate that chronic treatment with apomorphine increases oxidative stress, thereby damaging cells.

Discussion
In this study, we found that the non-selective activation of dopamine receptors by apomorphine induces learning and memory deficits, and it prevents LTP induction at CA3-CA1 synapses in the hippocampus. Furthermore, repeated apomorphine administration produces a decrease in the total length of dendrites, an inflammatory response in the hippocampal formation, and an increase in oxidative stress and neuronal damage. These findings provide direct experimental evidence for the damage caused by psycho-stimulants like apomorphine in the hippocampus.
Morris Water Maze, LTP, and Apomorphine
It is clear that dopaminergic projections from the VTA are necessary to modulate the cognitive function of the hippocampus [ , ]. Thus, alterations to the dopaminergic system by psycho-stimulants like apomorphine have been correlated with deficits in memory and learning processes [ ]. There is evidence that a deficit in D1 or D2 dopaminergic receptors impairs spatial learning [ , ]. Our findings demonstrate that repeated stimulation of dopamine receptors by apomorphine induces a spatial memory deficit, supporting the relevance of investigating the hippocampal changes caused by alterations to the dopaminergic system. In agreement with the learning and memory deficits observed in the WMT that are related to correct hippocampal functioning [ , ], LTP at CA3-CA1 synapses is normally robust, but it is completely prevented by apomorphine. Hence, there is a correlation between LTP and learning and memory in the hippocampus, indicating that the deficits in learning and memory correlate with the observed deficits of plasticity at the cellular level. Notably, both the D1 and D2 families of dopamine receptors can be found in the hippocampus [ ].
Dopamine receptors are thought to enhance the early phase of LTP in the hippocampus and to block the late phase [ , , ]. However, we found that the non-selective activation of dopamine receptors has the opposite effect, i.e., LTP induction is prevented when dopamine receptors are activated. This can be explained by the effect of apomorphine (or dopamine) on SC-CA1 EPSP’s, as the non-selective activation of dopamine receptors at low agonist concentrations decreases EPSP amplitude or slope by activating D4 receptors and increasing feed-forward inhibition [ ], an effect observed here at the concentration of apomorphine used (data not shown). Dopamine receptor activation by high concentrations of agonist increases EPSP amplitude by activating D1 receptors and increasing excitatory transmission [ ]. As we find a decrease in EPSP amplitude, the prevention of LTP may be more likely due to the depression of SC drive to CA1 neurons through D4 receptor activation.
It is also known that non-selective activation of the dopaminergic system may cause similar effects on LTP and glutamatergic transmission, as LTP is prevented by the activation of dopamine receptors by the agonist amphetamine [ ] and chronic methamphetamine exposure causes long-lasting memory deficits [ ]. These results suggest that although the selective activation of dopamine receptors mediates and facilitates LTP, as well as learning and memory processes (e.g., via D1 and D4 receptors [ , ]), the net effect of the simultaneous and non-selective activation of dopamine receptors is less predictable. Indeed, in the hippocampus, such activation seems to produce the opposite effect, indicating that the simultaneous activation of different types of dopamine receptors counteracts each other and the net effect in the hippocampus is impaired LTP and learning and memory. The exact mechanisms of these deficits in learning and memory and in the prevention of LTP induction in the hippocampus are not known at present, although the smaller dendritic tree and neuronal damage described will have a clear influence on these processes. While further studies will be required to define the mechanisms modifying these effects, what is clear is that non-selective activation of dopamine receptors prevents hippocampal LTP, and learning and memory.
Total Dendritic Length
Apomorphine produced a clear reduction in the total length of the dendrites of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, indicating that this type of compound directly changes neuronal morphology, which may affect hippocampal physiology. There is a well-established relationship between the dopaminergic and glutamatergic systems in the brain. As such, pathologies in which dopaminergic release is altered trigger changes in glutamatergic regions [ , , ]. Morphological rearrangements represent one of the consequences of such alterations in dopaminergic tone. In many animal models, an increase in dopamine activity decreases the total dendrite length, and it produces neuronal remodeling and abnormalities in spine stability, both in the basal ganglia and in pyramidal neurons of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) [ , ]. There is evidence that dopaminergic psychostimulant administration in the hippocampal CA1 subfield increases dendritic spine density [ ]. In addition, hippocampal efferent connectivity may modulate the circuits of reward and emotional behavior via projections to the NAc, PFC, and amygdala [ , ]. Our findings demonstrate that dopaminergic receptor activation causes hypotrophy of hippocampal pyramidal neurons in the CA1 subfield.
Inflammatory Response and Oxidative Stress
Dopaminergic activity is related to oxidative stress in different ways. There is evidence of dopamine receptors modulating the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, causing glucocorticoid release in response to stress [ , ]. Conversely, the use of psycho-stimulants that generate excessive dopamine release causes auto-oxidation of dopamine, which is implicated in the formation of highly reactive dopamine-derived quinones. These metabolites are implicated in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and dysfunction of the ubiquitin-proteasome system [ , ].
Oxidative stress is also related to the conversion of astrocytes to reactive astrocytes, known as reactive gliosis. In healthy conditions, astrocytes contribute to correct neuronal function, aiding in activities like homeostasis, synaptic function, and plasticity. However, during brain injury, aging, neurodegenerative disease, and oxidative stress, astrocytes change their molecular expression and morphology provoking reactive gliosis. The function of reactive gliosis is to maintain tissue integrity, reducing the spread of inflammation and damage. However, this process prevents axonal regrowth and may impede functional recovery [ , , , ]. One of the characteristics of reactive astrocytes is the expression of GFAP, which can be used to identify them [ , , ]. Reactive astrocytes are clearly detected in the CA1, CA3, and DG of the hippocampus after apomorphine administration, indicative of the damage caused by the chronic activation of dopamine receptors. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of inflammation caused by apomorphine in the hippocampus.
We evaluated oxidative stress biomarkers after the chronic administration of apomorphine to determine whether they explain the neuroinflammation, and the cognitive and LTP impairments observed. We evaluated the concentration of NO, which produces peroxynitrite, nitrating agents, and strong oxidants. Peroxynitrite has been linked to cellular antioxidants, and it has been shown to trigger lipid peroxidation [ ]. To evaluate lipid peroxidation, we measured the concentration of MDA and 4HDA, both of which are formed when the membrane is damaged or tissue is injured [ , ]. Furthermore, we evaluated GSH production, an antioxidant that aids cells subjected to oxidative stress, as well as the oxidized form of GSH, GSSG, which is related to the amount of GSH used to counteract antioxidants [ , ]. NO has been related to the deficits in recognition memory caused by apomorphine [ ]. Additionally, the overexpression of NO triggered by oxidative stress influences morphological changes in the PFC and hippocampus, which could explain the hypotrophy of pyramidal cells in the hippocampal CA1 subfield [ , ]. Finally, here, we found higher NO concentrations that may explain the increase in MDA and 4HDA. As a consequence of the high oxidative stress caused by apomorphine, the concentration of GSH decreases and that of GSSG increases.
In conclusion, we present here direct evidence that the simultaneous and non-selective activation of dopamine receptors by apomorphine induces learning and memory deficits, as well as preventing LTP induction at the hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses. These modifications occur in conjunction with a decrease in the total dendrite length of CA1 neurons, which may be caused by the inflammatory response and oxidative stress provoked by apomorphine in the hippocampus. These findings provide direct experimental evidence for the damage in the brain caused by psycho-stimulants like apomorphine.
