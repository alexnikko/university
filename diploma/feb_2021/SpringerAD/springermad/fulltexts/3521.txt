Background
Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the most common sexually transmitted infection. The prevalence of any oral HPV infection is estimated to be 7.3% (4% for high-risk HPV types) among adults 18–69 years old [ ]. Oral HPV infections are more prevalent in men as compared to women (7.3 vs. 1.4%) [ ]. High-risk HPV types are associated with cancers at different anatomic sites and include HPV-16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66, or 68 [ ]. High-risk oral HPV infection is significantly associated with tobacco smoking; marijuana use; sexual behavior (marital status, number of sex partners, oral sex, and anal sex); and HIV [ , , , ].
HPV is associated with the majority of newly diagnosed oropharyngeal cancers (OPC) in the USA (approximately 70%) [ , , , ]. The incidence of HPV-related OPC has steadily increased over the past 30 years [ , , ]. Persistent HPV oral infections (particularly HPV-16 and HPV-18, which are oncogenic/high risk) are the leading cause of HPV-associated OPCs [ , , ].
In 2006, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a vaccine for the prevention of HPV-related infections and cervical cancer [ , ], which may also protect from oral HPV infections and potentially OPCs. In a study by Hirth et al., the prevalence of “vaccine type” (HPV-6, 11, 16, 18) HPV infections was significantly lower in vaccinated adults (compared to non-vaccinated adults), regardless of gender [ ]. Similarly, a recent study by Gillison et al. showed an 88% reduction in the prevalence of oral HPV 16, 18, 6, and 11 infections among individuals who received at least one dose of the HPV vaccine, with population weighted prevalence of these infections in vaccinated men as compared to non-vaccinated men being 0.11 vs. 1.61%; ( P = 0.008) [ , ].
Oral health professionals (OHPs) have played significant counseling roles in tobacco cessation programs and therefore could be an excellent resource for promoting HPV prevention [ , , ]. OHPs typically see patients twice as often as primary care providers and perform comprehensive oral cancer screenings for their patients [ , , ]. However, studies have shown that OHPs are not always confident talking to their patients about HPV [ ]. Lack of access to proper information about HPV-related OPC, reimbursement, and parental concerns were some barriers listed [ , , , ].
To the best of our knowledge, the literature does not show any evidence of previous interventions/efforts to increase OHPs’ knowledge, attitudes, and practices with regard to HPV vaccination. As such, the objective of this project was to assess the effectiveness of an HPV educational intervention on self-reported knowledge, attitude, and comfort levels of OHPs in being able to talk to their patients regarding HPV. The ultimate goal of the project was to increase HPV awareness and knowledge among OHPs and for them to promote HPV vaccination in their patients.
Methods
Description of the Intervention
A total of six HPV educational lectures were conducted in six different cities in New England in 2016 and 2017. Participants included dentists and dental hygienists. The educational lectures were mostly approximately 2-h long and were presented by one of the investigators (A.V.). These focused on the role of HPV in OPCs, HPV vaccination, and how to discuss HPV vaccination with patients based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations [ ]. At the end of each lecture, all participants received an educational toolkit on HPV (Fig. 1 ). A detailed description of the toolkit has been reported previously [ ]. Briefly, the educational toolkit contained office brochures, tear off pads with information about HPV vaccines, talking tips for interacting with patients, and posters for the dental practice. Participants were then asked to complete an online survey using Qualtrics [ ] 1 month after attending the lecture. An informed consent for the participants was obtained before beginning the survey. The survey included 29 items on HPV knowledge and awareness (Tables 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 ) among OHPs [ ]. The survey was distributed 1 month after the educational intervention to capture any change in attitude of the OHPs towards HPV prevention. Reminder emails to complete the survey were sent twice at 4-week intervals. Follow-up telephone calls were also made twice after 3 months, 2 weeks apart. The deadline for the completion of the survey was 4 months after the date of the educational lecture. This study was approved by the Harvard Medical School Institutional Review Board.

Participants
A total of 230 OHPs attended the oral HPV educational lectures. The sample for this study included all the participants who attended the lecture, received a toolkit, and completed the follow-up survey before the expiration of the deadline. We excluded participants who attended the educational lecture but did not complete the follow up survey.
Pilot Test
The questionnaire was validated using face and content validity among the participants by two investigators (A.S. and A.V.). The questionnaire was evaluated in terms of feasibility, readability, clarity of words, and layout or style by experts on the subject. The questionnaire was pilot tested on a group of volunteer participants ( n = 15) who attended one of the HPV lectures in the previous year and were not part of our study [ ].
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to calculate the change in knowledge, comfort, and preparedness among oral health providers in being able to talk to their patients about HPV. Initial descriptive results were generated by Qualtrics [ ] and additional analyses were conducted in SAS version 9.4.
Results
Participants
A total of 89 out of 230 dental providers (38.7%) who attended the lecture and received the toolkit responded to the survey. This number includes everyone who completed the survey partially or in full. Different questions on the survey had differential response rates as outlined in the tables. A within-subject analysis was performed and the comparison was made for the same individuals. The majority of respondents were female (73.5%; n = 36/49) and 53.1% ( n = 26/49) were between 55 and 75 years of age. More than half 53.9% ( n = 48/89) of the participants were White, 14.6% ( n = 13/89) Asian, 14.6% ( n = 13/89) African-American, and 12.4% ( n = 11/89) Hispanic. A large proportion of respondents were dentists (44.2%) followed by dental hygienists (42.3%), and the remaining participants 13.5% ( n = 7/52) did not indicate their professional degree. In addition, over half 59.2% ( n = 45/76) of the respondents reported that they were in private practice, 31.6% ( n = 24/76) in public health, and 9.2% ( n = 7/76) reported “other” (education, research) (Table 1 ).
Almost all respondents 93.9% ( n = 46/49) reported routinely performing oral cancer screening examinations on their patients every 6 months. The majority 67.3% ( n = 33/49) of the respondents also reported talking with their patients about the association between HPV and OPC. Most of the providers 85.4% ( n = 35/41) spent less than 5 min talking to their patients about HPV. A small percentage of OHPs 14.3% ( n = 7/49) reported that their patients received the HPV vaccine after their discussion about the HPV in the clinic (Table 2 ).
Assessment of Facilitators and Barriers in HPV Prevention and Questions Relevant to the Toolkit
The top strategies that influenced the patients’ attitudes and opinions regarding HPV vaccinations, as perceived by respondents, were conversations at the dental visit 27.9% ( n = 12/43) and pediatrician’s recommendations 27.9% ( n = 12/43). Difficulty in initiating a conversation on HPV was a barrier for 26% ( n = 21/82) of the respondents, while role uncertainty was a reported barrier for 22% ( n = 18/82) of them. Seventy-five percent ( n = 33/44) of the respondents felt training dental auxiliaries (dental assistants/front desk staff) about HPV might also contribute to increased HPV awareness and vaccination rates. Reimbursement for the service was a barrier reported by 6% ( n = 5/82) of the respondents. Nearly two thirds (64.4%) ( n = 29/45) of respondents reported that reimbursement would have no impact on their willingness to provide HPV education (Table 2 ).
When asked which component of the educational toolkit they liked best, a large proportion 40.5% ( n = 15/37) of the respondents reported that they liked the brochure component of the toolkit the most compared to talking tips sheet (24.3%; n = 9/37) and posters (8.1%; n = 3/37). The brochure was the component most of the respondents were currently using in their office 33.3% ( n = 17/51). Overall 62.7% ( n = 27/43) of the survey respondents were satisfied with the toolkit (Table 3 ).
Comparison of Pre and Post Intervention
Before receiving the HPV dental toolkit, only 12.5% ( n = 6/48) OHPs reported that they almost always interacted with patients during routine preventive care visits about HPV and its prevention. When cross tabulated, three of those professionals were dental hygienists, two were dentists, while one of the respondents did not mention their primary degree. After the educational intervention, there was a self-reported 37.5% increase in interaction with patients about HPV and vaccination. Seven of the responders were dental hygienists and six of them were dentists. Prior to receiving the training/toolkit, only 26.2% ( n = 11/42) of the OHPs felt prepared or comfortable to talk about HPV with their patients. Post intervention, 67.5% ( n = 27/40) of the respondents reported they felt more prepared in talking about HPV with their patients, 82.6% ( n = 38/46) reported the educational intervention clarified their role in educating their patients about HPV, and 91.6% ( n = 44/48) reported an increase in knowledge about HPV (Table 4 ).
Discussion
This study was one of the first among few others [ , , , ] that identified a possible role for OHPs in HPV prevention. Our main goal was to increase HPV awareness and vaccination rates. Our proposed educational intervention [ ] was effective in improving the self-reported knowledge, comfort levels, and preparedness among OHPs in being able to talk to their patients about the association between HPV, cancer, and HPV vaccination. When surveyed after the educational interventions, OHPs reported an increased patient interaction regarding HPV prevention (37.5%). In addition, almost two thirds of the OHPs felt more prepared and knowledgeable about HPV, and also realized the importance of their roles in the promotion of HPV prevention strategies, including vaccination.
The findings in our study were comparable to previous studies conducted on this topic [ , , ]. Our respondent population was mostly comprised of OHPs who were 55–75 years old and in private practice. Other studies support our findings that increased age of the OHPs is correlated to the concept of discussion of sexual health and considering it within the scope of OHP practice [ ]. Older OHPs were found to be more interested and accepting of this expanded scope of practice. Major barriers faced by OHPs in advocating for HPV prevention include considering the topic stigmatizing, difficulty in initiating a conversation, and role confusion. These barriers have also been reported in a study by Vasquez et al. which described patient factors like age (teenage or young adults) and practice factors like open operatories (which meant less privacy as compared to closed operatories) also factor into OHPs being able to discuss this topic with patients [ ]. Interestingly, the majority of the OHPs did not think reimbursement for this service was necessary. However, other studies have found that reimbursement may negatively affect the provider’s recommendation of HPV vaccine [ ]. The reason behind this difference in our study may be that the sample size was small and may not be completely representative of the population in question. Dental hygienists have shown less participation in HPV prevention discussions with their patients in previous studies [ ]. This, however, was not true for our study.
There were some limitations in our study. First, our work had a small sample size and was cross-sectional in nature. As such, it may have not been representative of all OHPs in the New England area in general. An additional limitation for this study was selection bias. Presumably, the subject voluntarily enrolled in the HPV and cancer prevention seminars, which means that they already were interested in the topic and perhaps more receptive to the educational intervention. Secondly, the survey had a different response rates for different questions for unknown reasons; but this did lead to response bias which may have partially skewed our results. Last of all, to measure the effectiveness of the educational intervention, a randomized control trial would have been ideal. This was not possible because of cost and time limitations. Since we only looked at post intervention survey data, there is a possibility of a recall bias. In future studies, we will compare both pre and post intervention knowledge, comfort levels, and preparedness of the OHPs about HPV prevention for better assessment of effectiveness. In addition, we will evaluate the impact of our program in improving the vaccination rates for HPV.
Practice Implications
Adequate training and education may help OHPs feel comfortable in offering HPV prevention counseling for their patients. Considering the oral and systemic connection regarding HPV and the fact that the patients see their OHPs twice as much as their primary care providers, involvement of OHPs in this process would greatly benefit the cause.
Conclusion
OHPs have reported varied knowledge, comfort levels, and preparedness about HPV when it came to counseling their patients. Our educational intervention focused on HPV-related disease prevention and HPV vaccination programs. They also had a component that focused on improving the awareness, knowledge base, and comfort level of OHPs to feel better equipped to promote HPV prevention. OHPs have started to identify their roles in the HPV prevention programs. The Association of State and Territorial Dental Directors (ASTDD) has endorsed promotion of the HPV vaccine and supports ongoing efforts of HPV education for OHP’s and other health professions [ ]. Furthermore, as more trusted professional organizations begin to clarify their position on HPV vaccination, the expanse of information will reach more providers. Further studies may be useful in improving ways to involve more OHPs in being able to control this deadly, preventable disease.
