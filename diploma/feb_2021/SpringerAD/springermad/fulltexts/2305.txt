Introduction
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common and complex neurodevelopmental condition in children and juvenile, characterized by symptoms of inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity, following with cognitive handicap and difficulty in learning, which seriously handicap the development and education of the children. The ADHD symptoms can persist to adult and can even be across their lifespan (Tarver et al. ). ADHD is usually divided into several subtypes including ADHD-AI (predominantly inattentive type), ADHD-HI (predominantly hyperactive–impulsive type), and ADHD-C (combined type). Although extensive advances in understanding this complex disorder, the pathogenesis and etiological factors of ADHD have still been unclear, Some recent studies suggested that it is related to either genetic (Jarick et al. ; Williams et al. ) or environmental factors (Silva et al. ), and the structural or functional brain abnormalities (Wang et al. ). Lacking of efficient and specific evaluation approaches (Heinrich et al. ), the disorder seems to be heterogeneity in terms of etiology, clinical development, prognosis, and treatment response. There urgently need to identify an efficient and useful molecular signature for the evaluation of ADHD development and future intervention therapy more specifically to ensure the best long-term outcomes in ADHD.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) are small and nonprotein-encoding RNAs which posttranscriptionally regulate gene expression via disruption and degradation of specific target mRNAs (Wu et al. ). It is estimated that about one-third of mRNAs in human body are actually regulated by miRNA and thus miRNAs play an important role in gene expression regulation. Recently, miRNAs have emerged as critical regulators of neuronal activities and functions. In the prefrontal cortex (PFC), miRNA-219 is reported to be associated with neurobehavioral dysfunction (Kocerha et al. ) since the miRNA-219 targets calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II γ subunit, a component of N -methyl- d -aspartate receptor signaling cascade. The single nucleotide polymorphisms located at the 3′ region of miR-96 (rs2402959 and rs6965643) are reported to be associated with the morbidity of ADHD (Sanchez-Mora et al. ). It needs to take into account in genetic studies to analyze the phenomenon of heterogeneity and to clarify the disorder phenotypes. Our previous study (Wu et al. ) indicated that miRNA let-7d was over-expressed in the PFC and targeted galectin-3 leading to down-regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase which is important in dopamine metabolism in ADHD development. Interestingly, miRNAs are found to be stable in circulation and the level of circulation miRNA may be related to the disease. Studies suggested that circulating miRNAs are useful markers for some of neurogenic and cerebrovascular disease evaluation (Gandhi et al. ; Contu et al. ). miRNA let-7 has recently been implicated as an important regulator for the development and morphogenesis of the brain (Lehmann et al. ). However, there is no any report about miRNA let-7d in patients with ADHD. The potential significance of circulation miRNA let-7d is far from clear in children with ADHD. Based on our previous study of let-7d and the screening result of galectin-3 as a let-7d target (Wu et al. ), in this study, we are going to evaluate the significance of circulation miRNA let-7d and galectin-3 in children with ADHD and investigate the association of the circulating miRNA let-7d or galectin-3, with the disorder ADHD by case–control study.
Materials and Methods
Subjects
From January to December 2009, 35 pairs of ADHD and 35 control subjects were successfully matched in gender, height, weight, and age (6–14 years) at the Department of Children Health Care, Yu Ying Children Hospital, Wen Zhou Medical University, Zhejiang, PR China. All of the ADHD subjects who entered this study were randomly selected from 406 ADHD subjects who were screened from 7450 children (3744 boys and 3706 girls). The selection method from the patient pool was according to the patient and their parent willingness to be enrolled in the study and the pairing principle between ADHD and control subjects. The diagnosis of ADHD was made by two senior pediatricians with ADHD expertise independently and met the criteria proposed by DSM-IV (the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fourth edition; Rader et al. ; APA ) with structured interview. The Conners’ Teacher Rating Scale (TRS) and Conners’ Parent Symptom Questionnaire (PSQ) were used as a screening diagnostic instrument. Consistency, correctness and integrality were checked up among the data collected to avoid information bias. The qualification rate of the interview information was higher than 95 %. All of the 35 ADHD subjects were newly diagnosed and entered the study without treatment. Thirty-five healthy subjects were randomly selected from the pool of 7450 children whom we investigated in this study as non-ADHD control, and their IQ value was matched with those of subjects with ADHD apart from pairing in age, gender, height, and weight (Table 1 ). The matched healthy children were also right-handedness, and all of them had no any clinical signs at the time when the observation was carried out. The same diagnosis criteria and process as ADHD were used for the healthy children to exclude ADHD. Their family background was also matched. All the subjects in this study had no mental retardation, nervous system diseases, vision disorder, dysaudia, and development disorders, and the intelligence quotient (IQ) was higher than 85 in all subjects. No record of psychotropic drug treatment was within 2 weeks. In their family, there is no patient who suffered from epilepsy, or mental disorders. Risk Factors Survey Questionnaire was used in the survey especially gestational information (prematurity, type of delivery, estimated gestational age at birth, fetal position, multiple-birth status, and condition at birth). Subsequent information gathered for all children included blood type, breast-feeding status, handedness, disease history, and the natural mother as the principal caretaker. Children’s age, height, and weight were recorded for each subject at the time of examination. Additional information concerning the child’s family included each parent’s age, blood type, education, occupation, the use of alcohol and tobacco, and the family history of ADHD. All participants were voluntary, and the procedures were in accordance with the requirements of local ethics committee and approved by Wen Zhou Medical University.

Animals
Six-week-old juvenile male SHR (spontaneously hypertensive rat) and age- and gender-matched genetic control WKY (Wistar–Kyoto rats) weighing from 125 to 150 g were from Shanghai SLAC Laboratory Animal Co. Ltd. and were used in this study as animal model of ADHD according to the previous study (Wu et al. ). All the rats were evaluated by ADHD-related behavioral assessments (open-field, Làt Maze, step-down tests). The assessment results validated that SHR was an ADHD animal model, which was then used in the experiments. The experiments were approved by the local animal ethics committee.
Sample Preparation and MicroRNA Isolation
Whole blood (WB) samples were collected from subjects after 30-min resting, via phlebotomizing. The blood samples were placed 2 h at room temperature and centrifuged to isolate serum at 3000 rpm for 10 min 4 °C. After centrifugation, the serum was carefully transferred into a ribonuclease (RNase)-free tube for extraction of miRNA. The serum specimens were stored at −80 °C. To isolate miRNA from serum, Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was added and sequential performance was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Additional three steps of phenol/chloroform extraction were performed for further purification. The extraction procedures were as described as previously (Jia et al. ).
Quantitative Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR)
The RT-qPCR method was based on our previous reports (Dong et al. ; Jia et al. ). Briefly, after extraction of serum microRNA, 20 µL reverse transcription reaction system contained 10 µL isolated RNA, 2 µL reverse transcriptase buffer, 0.25 mM dNTPs, 5 U/µL M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Takara, Tokyo, Japan), 0.4 U/µL RNase inhibitor (Takara, Tokyo, Japan), and 40 pmol reverse transcription (RT) primer. The reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 10 min, 42 °C for 60 min, 95 °C for 5 min, and 4 °C for 5 min. Subsequently, 20 µL PCR system consisted of 1 µL reverse transcription product, 20 pmol reverse primer, 20 pmol sense primer, and 10 µL SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (DBI Bioscience, Shanghai, China). PCR quantification was performed in a 96-well optical plate by using iCycler (Bio-Rad, Alfred Nobel Drive, Hercules, CA, USA), and the reactions were carried out at 95 °C for 2 min, followed by 50 cycles of 95 °C for 20 s, 60° C for 30 s, and 72° C for 30 s. All reactions were run in triplicate and repeated three times independently. After reaction, the cycle threshold (Ct) data were determined using default threshold settings and the mean Ct value was determined from the triplicate PCRs. The data were expressed as relative expression of serum miRNA after normalization over RNU6. Since miR-15b was stable in the serum and was not significantly altered in any of the experimental samples (Mitchell et al. ), it was then taken as reference miRNA in the following experiments. The relative expression of miRNA in ADHD group was further normalized over the miRNA in control group as the fold change in expression. All primers used in this study are listed in Table 2 .

Western Blot
To prepare protein samples, serum specimens were diluted 1:7 in PBS (phosphate buffer solution) (v/v) on ice. The protein concentrations were determined by Lorry’s method. Equal serum proteins were loaded onto and resolved by 10 % sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE). Using the loading control of the gel staining with Coomassie brilliant blue (CBB), sample protein was resolved by 10 % SDS–PAGE and blotted onto a PVDF membrane. The blot was then blocked with 3 % milk protein in PBST (phosphate buffer solution containing 0.1 % Tween 20) for 2 h at room temperature and incubated with the antibody against galectin-3 (Santa Cruz, CA. 95060, USA) over night at 4 °C or antibody against human albumin (Calbiochem, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Then, the blots were washed with PBST four times and incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory, Inc., PA, USA) for 2 h at room temperature. The blots were incubated with and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence reagents after washing with PBST. An X-ray film was exposed to the membrane and developed. The band integrated optical density (IOD) was scanned and analyzed by Gel-Pro Analyzer (Media Cybernetics, USA). The IOD ratio of ADHD group over the matched control was achieved. The ratio of 80 and 120 % was then set as the ranking point to define low (<80 %) or high (>120 %) expression of galectin-3 in the serum, and the percentage of samples with low or high expression were statistically analyzed. All experiments were repeated at least three times independently.
Statistical Analysis
Data were described as mean ± SD and median for general characteristics of subjects. Paired Student’s t test and Chi-square test were performed to analyze the expression differences of miRNA let-7d, miR-337-5p, and miR-503 between ADHD and healthy subjects. Risks were evaluated by odds ratio (OR) analysis using SPSS software version 15 through descriptive crosstabs statistics. If the value of OR is >1, the factor is a risky factor for the disease. If the value is smaller than 1, the factor is protective for the disease. Differences with p value <0.05 were considered as statistical significance.
Results
Clinical Characteristics
The clinical characteristics of subjects with ADHD and the paired control subjects are summarized in Table 1 . All the ages, weights, and heights of the subjects were similar between ADHD and control groups (Table 3 ), and no significant difference was found between the matched two groups ( p > 0.05). ADHD-C was the major subtype and accounted for 60 %, ADHD-AI 26 %, and ADHD-HI 14 %. Male patients were more than female. The ratio of male to female was 6:1 in all children. Subjects at 7, 8, 9, and 10 years old accounted for 20, 23, 20, and 14 %, respectively. No significant risk factors (prematurity, type of delivery, estimated gestational age at birth, fetal position, multiple-birth status, and condition at birth) were noted as compared to the control in this study (data not shown).

Circulating miRNAs
The miRNA let-7d was significantly regulated in the brain of SHR, an animal model of ADHD in our previous study (Wu et al. ). After knowing the existence of miRNA let-7d in the serum of the animal, we investigated this miRNA in the circulation of children with ADHD in comparison with their matched control subjects to evaluate its potential significance in patients and possible clinic application. The results of RT-PCR indicated that mature miR-15b, miR-337-5p, miR-503, and miRNA let-7d could be detected in the circulation of the subjects and were clearly expressed in the serum of both control and ADHD groups (Fig. 1 a). MiR-15b was stable in the circulation in all subjects and was not significantly different between ADHD and control groups (Fig. 1 b, p = 0.765). It was then taken as a miRNA reference in this study. The miR-337-5p and miR-503 were irrelevant miRNA and measured in the serum to test the bias. The results indicated that there was no significant difference of the circulating miR-337-5p ( p = 0.24) and miR-503 ( p = 0.662) between ADHD and control subjects. Fig. 1 Measurement of circulating miRNA let-7d. a miRNAs isolated from serum were detected in both ADHD and control groups by semiquantitative RT-PCR. Representative results from three pairs of subjects are shown in the left and quantitative analysis of let-7d in the right . C control, A ADHD. b The relative expression of circulating miR-15b was measured by qPCR in either ADHD or control group. The expression level was normalized over RNU6. c Circulating miRNA let-7d was further analyzed by qPCR in both ADHD and control groups. The relative level of miRNA let-7d in ADHD group was shown as fold changes over the control group. d Circulating miRNA let-7d levels were analyzed by qRT-PCR in ADHD subtypes. The miRNA let-7d level of ADHD-C group was significantly higher than that of control group ( p < 0.05). Control control group, ADHD-C ADHD combined type. The data were representative of three independent measurements. * p < 0.05
Circulating miRNA let-7d levels, however, were significantly higher in subjects with ADHD than those in control by either semiquantitative RT-PCR or quantitative PCR (Fig. 1 a, b). The level of circulating miRNA let-7d in ADHD subjects was significantly higher than that in healthy subjects (Fig. 1 c, p < 0.05). miRNA let-7d was especially elevated in the subtype ADHD-C (Fig. 1 d) that was the major type of ADHD and constituted the major part of the ADHD subjects in this study. The median qPCR Ct values in ADHD were significantly less than those in control ( p = 0.015). A Ct value ≥ 30 in a 0.5 µg RNA sample was taken as a threshold to differentiate miRNA expression levels among subjects according to previous report (Luo et al. ; Ai et al. ). Using this cutoff, out of 35 non-ADHD subjects, only 16 had miRNA let-7d Ct value <30 (45.7 %), while over half of the ADHD children (68.6 %) had the Ct value <30 in ADHD subjects (Fig. 2 ). The difference in the rates of miRNA let-7d Ct values between ADHD and control subjects reached significance ( p < 0.05). However, the Ct rates of miR-337-5p (48.57, 42.86 %) and miR-503 (71.43, 68.57 %) were similar between ADHD and control subjects. The OR, one of the main ways to quantify how strongly the factor is associated with the presence of the disease especially in case–control studies, for ADHD reached to 16.67 with 95 % confidence from 1.82 to 152.77 (Table 4 ). Fig. 2 Comparison analysis of circulating miRNA let-7d, miR-337-5p, and miR-503. The percentage of children having circulating miRNA let-7d qPCR amplification Ct value ≥30 and <30 was analyzed between ADHD and control groups. ADHD group had significantly more children with miRNA let-7d Ct <30 than control. But no significant difference was seen in miR-337-5p and miR-503 groups. * p < 0.05 Table 4 Explanatory variables for patients with ADHD and control Explanatory variable Patients with ADHD ( N = 35) Control subjects ( N = 35) number (percent) Unadjusted odds ratio (95 % CI) p value Demographic characteristics Sex Female 5 (14.3) 5 (14.3) 1 Male 30 (85.7) 30 (85.7) 1 Age (year) ≥8 20 (57.1) 20 (57.1) 1 <8 15 (42.9) 15 (42.9) 1 Let-7d Ct < 30 24 (68.6) 16 (45.7) 1 Ct ≥ 30 11 (31.4) 19 (54.2) 16.7 (1.82–152.77) 0.004 Galectin 3 IOD < 450 26 (74.3) 17 (48.6) 1 IOD ≥ 450 9 (25.7) 18 (51.4) 5.6 (0.97–32.5) 0.049
Serum Galectin-3
In the serum of the ADHD model animals (SHR) that were validated by behavioral assessments, the level of galectin-3 was interestingly lower than the control animals (WKY) (Fig. 3 a). We further investigated the circulating galectin-3 in human being, both ADHD and control subjects. The serum galectin-3 was simultaneously examined in the paired ADHD and control subjects (Fig. 3 b). Based on the level of total protein and albumin as the endogenous reference for loading control, the results of galectin-3 immunoblotting were analyzed and the data of IOD were analyzed between ADHD and control. High expression of galectin-3 (IOD ratio >120 %) was seen in only eight (22.9 %) patients (Fig. 3 b). Low expression of galectin-3 (IOD ratio <80 %) was seen in 23 out of 35 ADHD subjects with the percentage of 65.7 %, but 61.9, 66.7, and 80.0 % in the subtypes ADHD-C, ADHD-AI, and ADHD-HI, respectively (Fig. 4 a). Subjects with IOD ≧450 were nine, while the subjects with IOD <450 were 26 out of the 35 ADHD children. In control group, the IOD was ≧450 and <450 in 17 18 children, respectively. The rates between ADHD and control groups reached significance by Chi-square test ( p < 0.05), and the OR for low level of serum galectin-3 was 5.6 with 95 % confidence from 0.97 to 32.5 (Table 4 ). These indicated that ADHD subjects mainly expressed low level of galectin-3 in the serum and the low expression level of galectin-3 was correlated with ADHD.

The ratio of IOD in ADHD over the IOD in control <80 % was considered as low expression, while IOD ratio more than 120 % was as high expression. The majority (65.71 %) of ADHD samples expressed low level of galectin-3 as the IOD A/C was <80 %. Samples with IOD A/C more than 120 % only accounted for 22.86 % Fig. 4 Association analysis of miRNA let-7d and galectin-3 with the prognosis of ADHD. a The relative expression level of serum galectin-3 was analyzed in subtypes of ADHD. b Follow-up result of the patients. The ADHD subjects had been followed up for 1 year. Their symptoms were evaluated and analyzed between the children with qPCR Ct value <30 and ≥30
Follow-up
All the subjects who entered this study were followed up by 1-year observation. Conner’s questionnaire survey was conducted during the follow-up. Interestingly, we noted that in six out of 24 ADHD subjects whose Ct value of circulating miRNA let-7d was <30, the symptoms were relieved, but 18 persisted. However, seven subject’s symptoms improved and only four did not, out of 11 subjects whose Ct value was more than 30. The difference of the rate reached significance ( p = 0.022) between the two groups (Fig. 4 b). During the follow-up, all of the children did not receive any medication for ADHD except four. These four ADHD subjects received 10 mg of atomoxetine hydrochloride per day for 3 months for the treatment of ADHD. Two subjects were in the group of circulating miRNA let-7d Ct < 30: one improved and the other did not. The other two ADHD subjects receiving the treatment were in the group of circulating miRNA let-7d Ct > 30: all improved during the follow-up. It seemed that subjects with higher Ct value in PCR amplification of miRNA let-7d were more likely to improve their symptoms.
Discussion
MicroRNA let-7 is believed to play an important role in neuronal adaptations (Chandrasekar and Dreyer ). High expression of miRNA let-7d was often seen in highly differentiated PC12H (Wu et al. ). After the differentiation of PC12L cells (Scheibe et al. ) treated by retinoic acid, miRNA let-7d expression was induced. The expression of miRNA let-7d is especially involved in the differentiation from pluripotency to neurogenesis (Rehfeld et al. ) and in the maintenance of pluripotency, somatic cell reprogramming, tissue regeneration, and neural stem cell plasticity. Extracellular let-7 abundant in the central nerve system activates toll-like receptor and causes neurodegeneration (Lehmann et al. ). Our previous study showed that elevated miRNA let-7d in right PFC of SHR, an ADHD model animal, targets galectin-3 and down-regulates tyrosine hydroxylase gene expression which is important in dopamine metabolism (Wu et al. ). miRNA let-7 may thus play either physiological or pathological role in the brain (Di et al. ) and phenotypic properties of cell differentiation (Huleihel et al. ). The expression level of this miRNA in circulation may reflect the situation in the brain, indicating the disease progression, abnormal differentiation, or maldevelopment of the neuron. ADHD is a disease or problem of neuron development in childhood. Investigation of circulating miRNA let-7d in ADHD subjects helps knowing the disease and understanding the biological roles of let-7d in this disease. Rapid and accurate detection and quantification of the biomarkers in the blood represents a challenge and is important for ADHD study although there has been none available. The advantage of using miRNA let-7d in general, as a biomarker, is that it can be precisely quantified by using qPCR that provides exceptionally high sensitivity and specificity of detection in a minimally invasive way. Moreover, qPCR also allows absolute quantification of miRNAs down to the level of copy number within a cell or small amount of RNA samples, potentially providing precise cutoff concentrations for the purpose of evaluation or follow-up of the disorder. The validation pipeline for miRNA biomarkers is expected to be much efficient.
ADHD is characterized with symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity (Faraone et al. ) and attracts intense research interest due to its high incidence among children and severe hindrance of children’s learning and education. Although recent studies have made great contributions to understanding the development of this disorder by using modern technologies or methods to explore the possible objective parameters and detectable molecules for this disorder, no molecular signature has still been available. DSM-IV is currently the only criterion for the diagnosis of ADHD. There is no any laboratory parameter available in clinic for the disease up to date (MTA ), since the difficulty in making an observation and test among children especially in the subjects with ADHD. Experiments in animal model have been the main venues of uncovering and revealing ADHD-related molecules. In this study, we investigated the potential significance of miRNA let-7d and galectin-3 in ADHD patients who were well paired with normal control as case–control study. Through case–control analysis, we observed that the circulating miRNA let-7d level was significantly highly related to human ADHD with high OR, suggesting that let-7d was a risk factor for this disorder. To further rule out the possible bias, we also measured unrelated miRNAs such as miR-337-5p and miR-503 and found that the levels of miR-337-5p and miR-503 in the circulation were not significantly different between ADHD and healthy subjects, indicating the uniqueness of blood miRNA let-7d in ADHD. Fair stability of miRNAs in blood has been documented by previous studies (Mitchell et al. ), and circulating miRNA changes might be related to pathologic development of the disease and can thus be useful in evaluation of the disease development. In current study, we demonstrated that ADHD patient’s serum contains significantly higher level of miRNA let-7d than that in control subjects, and the high level of miRNA let-7d was associated with ADHD since the OR reached to 16.7 with 95 % confidence ( p < 0.05). The high circulating let-7d in ADHD subjects compared with control may reflect the abundance of this miRNA in patient’s brain where excessive let-7d targets galectin-3 expression down and leads to tyrosine hydroxylase down-regulation (Wu et al. ). Circulating miRNA let-7d was mainly elevated in the subtype ADHD-C, suggesting that the elevation of let-7d was correlated with complex symptoms. On the other hand, this also indicated that ADHD might be heterogeneous among the subtypes in pathogenesis and development. The subjects with ADHD in this study consisting mainly of boys are consistent with the fact that ADHD is likely to happen in boys with the ratio of 4–9:1 male over female. The circulating miRNA let-7d might be higher in boys than in girls, but in this study we did not find any significant difference between boys and girls. During the follow-up, we further noted that seven out of 11 patients with low level of circulating miRNA let-7d improved significantly, while the symptoms were relieved in only six out of 24 patients with high expression level of miRNA let-7d. All the children in this study did not receive any medication for the treatment of ADHD except four during the follow-up. This suggested that level of miRNA let-7d is related to their prognosis since fewer patients could improve in those with high level of miRNA let-7d during the follow-up ( p < 0.05), and the difference of the remission rates was not due to the treatment received in four children. Measurement of circulating miRNA let-7d should thus be an alternative approach for the evaluation of the disease development especially during follow-up.
miRNA let-7d is an important posttranscriptional negative regulator of galectin-3 (Wu et al. ). Subsequently, galectin-3 can further regulate tyrosine hydroxylase in ADHD. In present study, elevated level of circulating miRNA let-7d and low level of galectin-3 were simultaneously observed in ADHD subjects especially in ADHD-C subtype that was the main subtype of ADHD. There is an inverse correlation between circulating miRNA let-7d and galectin-3 expressions, which was consistent with and further supported our previous observation. Here, we proposed that simultaneous detection of serum miRNA let-7d and galectin-3 might be helpful in clinical evaluation of ADHD especially in follow-up.
Taken together, our study demonstrated that circulating miRNA let-7d is elevated in ADHD children for the first time and the elevated miRNA let-7d in the serum may potentially be useful as a novel serum-based molecular signature for the disease prognosis evaluation during the follow-up.
