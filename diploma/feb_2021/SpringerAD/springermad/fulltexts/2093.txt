Introduction
Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) still remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) [ ]. It has been reported that many factors such as early brain injury, cerebral vasospasm, arteriolar constriction, thrombosis and dysfunction in microcirculation or veins, and cortical spreading ischemia may be involved in the development of DCI [ , , , , ]. Recently, spontaneous hyperventilation was also reported to be associated with DCI and poor outcome [ ]. Hyperventilation may result from a metabolic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) acidosis in SAH patients [ , ]. In addition, it is known that changes in ventilation are related to pH and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO 2 ) in both the arterial blood and CSF [ , ]. CSF pH and PCO 2 may independently and concomitantly regulate cerebrovascular contractility and cerebral blood flow through multiple mechanisms, while PCO 2 but not pH may regulate them through endothelium-dependent mechanisms in the arterial blood [ ]. Thus, the authors hypothesized that CSF pH and PCO 2 contribute to the development of DCI. The aim of this study was to compare gas data in the CSF between patients with and without DCI and to demonstrate the potential contribution of CSF pH and PCO 2 to DCI after aneurysmal SAH.
Materials and Methods
This was a single-center, retrospective, observational study. The study was approved by the ethical committee of our institute and was performed in accordance with institutional guidelines. Appropriate informed consent was obtained from all patients or their relatives.
Patient Population
The subjects of this study were 61 consecutive patients (34 males and 27 females), 38 to 90 years of age (mean 59.9 years) who met the following inclusion criteria: ≥20 years of age at onset, SAH classified as Fisher group III on admission computed tomography (CT) scans [ ], saccular aneurysm as the cause of SAH confirmed on digital subtraction angiography, aneurysmal obliteration by clipping or coiling within 24 h after onset, and CSF sampling for the study [ ]. Excluded from the study were patients who demonstrated any angiographic or surgical complications, as well as individuals with inflammatory, malignant, or other diseases that can affect blood gas including pneumonia needing tracheal intubation. The World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies (WFNS) SAH scores at admission included 40 patients of grades I–III, and 21 patients (34.4 %) of grades IV–V [ ]. The ruptured aneurysm location was the anterior communicating artery in 20 patients, internal carotid artery in 17, middle cerebral artery in 14, vertebral or basilar arteries in 9, and anterior cerebral artery in one.
After angiographic confirmation of the aneurysm, surgical clipping (49 patients) or endovascular coiling (12 patients) of the lesion was performed within 24 h of initial onset. Cisternal drainage (17 patients) was placed in the basal cistern after surgical clipping, and lumbar spinal drainage (11 patients) was placed after endovascular coiling according to the preference of attending neurosurgeons. The drainage was continued until the CSF was visibly clear but at least day 12 (as a result, for 11 to 14 days), and the volume of drained CSF was maintained at 150 to 250 mL per day by changing the height of the drainage siphon with the aim of 200 mL CSF drainage per day considering that roughly 500 mL of CSF is produced per day [ ]. Of 33 patients without cisternal or spinal drainage, a ventricular catheter was placed in 5 patients with ventriculomegaly and a decreased level of consciousness that could not be attributed to causes other than acute hydrocephalus. There were no cases in which obstruction of the cisternal and ventricular drains occurred, but lumbar drains were obstructed and replaced once each in two cases with DCI and two cases without DCI. All patients received intravenous fasudil hydrochloride from 1 day post-surgery to day 14 post-hemorrhage. Additional treatment was administered to maintain normovolemia; prevent meningitis, pneumonia, and hypoxia; and correct anemia and hypoproteinemia.
All patients with DCI were treated with hypertensive hypervolemic therapy. DCI was defined as otherwise unexplained clinical deterioration (i.e., a new focal deficit, decrease in the level of consciousness, or both) or a new infarct on CT that was not visible on admission or immediate postoperative scans, or both. Other potential causes of clinical deterioration, such as hydrocephalus, rebleeding, or seizures, were rigorously excluded. The clinical outcome was evaluated using the Glasgow Outcome Scale at 3 months after onset [ ].
Semi-Quantitative Assessment of Subarachnoid and Intraventricular Blood Volume
To improve the risk stratification of DCI and to assess varying extents of intracranial blood within the Fisher group III category [ ], each CT scan at admission was reviewed retrospectively to quantify the amount of blood according to Hijdra et al. [ ]. Briefly, 10 basal cisterns or fissures were graded separately as follows: 0, no blood; 1, small amount of blood; 2, moderate amount of blood; and 3, completely filled with blood. These scores were added to yield a cisternal/fissural Hijdra sum score that ranged from 0 to 30 [ ]. The amount of intraventricular hematoma was quantified in both the lateral, the third, and the fourth ventricles as follows: 0, no blood; 1, sedimentation of blood in the posterior part; 2, partly filled with blood; and 3, completely filled with blood, leading to a ventricular Hijdra sum score ranging from 0 to 12 [ ]. Both cisternal/fissural and ventricular Hijdra scores were also combined as a total Hijdra sum score (range, 0 to 42) [ ].
CSF Analysis
CSF samples were chronologically obtained from cisternal (17 patients), spinal (11 patients), or ventricular (5 patients) drains or via a lumbar tap (28 patients with no CSF drainage) on the following 4 sampling time points: days 3 through 5, 6 through 8, 9 through 11, and 12 through 14 after onset. In patients with CSF drainage, CSF samples were obtained only from the CSF drain, and this was removed after the last CSF sampling: fresh CSF was always collected without exposure to the air after throwing away 3-mL possibly stagnated CSF in the drain. Control CSF samples were obtained via a lumbar tap from five patients with minimal cervical or lumbar spondylosis without myelopathy or radiculopathy when CT myelography was performed, all of whom gave written informed consent to participate in this study. The concentrations of total hemoglobin, proteins, and inflammatory cells in the CSF were determined with an automatic chemistry analyzer. CSF gas analyses were performed using an automatic blood gas analyzer.
Arterial Blood Gas
Arterial blood was obtained simultaneously with CSF sampling, and was analyzed with an automatic blood gas analyzer.
Statistical Analysis
Age and Hijdra scores were expressed as median ± 25th–75th percentiles and were analyzed by Mann-Whitney U tests. Categorical variables were reported as a percentile and were analyzed using chi-square or Fisher exact test, as appropriate. Other continuous variables were expressed as means ± standard errors of the mean. After confirming that each population being compared followed a normal distribution using Shapiro–Wilk W tests, statistical differences were analyzed using unpaired t tests or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and then the Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison procedure as appropriate. The impact of each variable on DCI was determined by multivariate unconditional logistic regression analyses using the presence or absence of DCI as the dependent variable. All variables were considered independent variables regardless of the significance on univariate analysis. Adjusted odds ratios with 95 % confidence intervals were calculated, and independence of variables was tested using the likelihood ratio test on reduced models. A probability value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Incidence and Clinical Features of DCI after SAH
Twenty of 61 patients (32.8 %) had DCI. Patients with DCI were more frequently treated with CSF drainage, especially cisternal drainage, and were associated with worse Glasgow Outcome Scales at 3 months after the onset of SAH in comparison with patients without DCI (Table 1 ). There were no significant differences in age, WFNS grades at admission, amount of subarachnoid or intraventricular blood (Hijdra score), aneurysm location, and treatment modalities (clipping or coiling) between patients with and without DCI.

Gas Analyses in the Arterial Blood and CSF after SAH
There were no significant differences in arterial blood gas data between patients with and without DCI (Table 2 ). In contrast, patients with DCI were associated with significantly higher pH, partial pressure of oxygen (PO 2 ) and lower PCO 2 in the CSF compared with patients without DCI (Table 3 ). The CSF pH tended to be higher in patients with DCI than without DCI at each CSF sampling time, both of which were significantly higher than that in control patients without SAH (Fig. 1 ). There were no significant differences in base excess in the CSF between patients with and without DCI (Table 3 ).

When CSF gas was analyzed per CSF obtained via different sampling routes after SAH, CSF pH from lumbar and cisternal drains was higher and significantly different from that in control patients associated with lower CSF PCO 2 : in particular, CSF pH from cisternal drains was the highest associated with the lowest PCO 2 and the most base excess (Table 4 ). When compared between patients with and without DCI, CSF pH from cisternal drains was still significantly higher in the former (7.644 ± 0.028 versus 7.516 ± 0.013, respectively; P < 0.001), and that from lumbar, ventricular drains or lumbar taps tended to be higher in the former (7.507 ± 0.034 versus 7.456 ± 0.049; 7.391 ± 0.041 versus 7.300 ± 0.020; 7.382 ± 0.073 versus 7.301 ± 0.023, respectively). CSF concentrations of bicarbonate ion were significantly lower in SAH patients compared with control patients irrespective of CSF sampling routes (Table 4 ).

Total hemoglobin concentrations in the drained or tapped CSF were higher in patients with no DCI compared with patients with DCI: the difference reached significance at days 9–11 (Fig. 2 ). There were no significant differences in concentrations of total protein and inflammatory cells in the CSF between patients with and without DCI (Table 3 ).

Potential Predictor for DCI
Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed using CSF pH and CSF PCO 2 measured on days 3 through 5 in addition to variables listed in Table 1 as independent variables. On multivariate analyses, the development of DCI was independently related to admission WFNS grades IV–V, higher cisternal/fissural Hijdra scores, CSF pH, and CSF PCO 2 on days 3–5 (Table 5 ).

Discussion
SAH-related DCI is a challenging problem involving different mechanisms. This study first showed that higher CSF pH as well as reduced CSF PCO 2 might contribute to DCI using multivariate analyses. In this study, arterial blood pH was not related to CSF pH after SAH, which was higher than that in control patients. Contrary to our expectations, patients with CSF drainage had higher CSF pH and were more frequently associated with DCI.
DCI and tissue breakdown may directly contribute to the spread of acid metabolites. Brain tissue monitoring showed that SAH patients who developed DCI had decreased brain tissue pH and increased PCO 2 [ ]. Froman and Smith [ ] reported a metabolic lumbar CSF acidosis in SAH patients, and suggested that the reduction in CSF bicarbonate was due to the generation of lactate derived from enzymatic glycolysis by shed blood cells or ischemic brain. In dogs, pH and bicarbonate ion concentration of CSF in the cisterna magna were reduced by 3 h after experimental SAH and this CSF metabolic acidosis, of which the severity related to the severity of SAH, was prolonged [ ]. Subarachnoid periarterial focal acidosis resulting from anaerobic changes in subarachnoid clots caused intraluminal platelets aggregation in the spastic artery and therefore cerebral ischemic symptoms after SAH in dogs [ ]. In addition, hyperventilation and a respiratory arterial alkalemia may occur due to a metabolic CSF acidosis and the persistent reduction in CSF bicarbonate in SAH patients [ , ], causing low arterial PCO 2 and therefore vasoconstriction through endothelium-dependent mechanisms [ ]. Thus, CSF lactic acidosis with low pH and bicarbonate concentration and systemic respiratory alkalosis have been considered all adversely to affect brain function, resulting in a poor outcome after SAH [ ]. On the other hand, Yamamoto et al. [ ] reported that cisternal CSF pH was higher than the arterial pH in an acute stage of aneurysmal SAH patients, and that sustained elevated cisternal CSF pH was associated with a poor outcome. Elevated cisternal CSF pH was correlated with a rise in CSF bicarbonate ion and a fall in CSF PCO 2 , although CSF lactate increased acutely in almost all cases, decreased gradually with time but re-increased with DCI [ ]. According to cerebral microdialysis, lactate elevation per se might not be an unfavorable sign: increased glycolytic lactate secondary to aerobic metabolism was an alternative energy substrate for the injured human brain, corresponding to satisfied energy needs and neuronal survival, and was associated with good outcome, whereas increased hypoxic lactate secondary to anaerobic metabolism resulted from cell energy failure and neuronal loss, and was associated with poor outcome [ ]. In this study, CSF lactate was not measured, but CSF pH was higher associated with lower CSF PCO 2 and bicarbonate ion in SAH patients compared with control patients. Moreover, patients with DCI had significantly higher CSF pH and lower CSF PCO 2 than those without DCI, although CSF bicarbonate ion and arterial blood gas were not significantly different. Both higher CSF pH and lower CSF PCO 2 might cause contraction of the intracranial vessels and contribute to the development of DCI in this study, because CSF pH and PCO 2 may independently and concomitantly regulate cerebrovascular contractility and cerebral blood flow by acting on the vascular smooth muscle cells directly as well as on the nerves and astrocytes that release nitric oxide and endothelin-1 [ ].
It is generally accepted that changes in ventilation due to central neurogenic drive in acute cerebrovascular disease are associated with a fall in CSF PCO 2 [ ]. CSF pH and PCO 2 follow arterial blood gas pH and PCO 2 rapidly with acute changes in ventilation [ ]. However, it was reported that there was no correlation between CSF and arterial pH values in SAH patients [ ], like this study. These findings suggest that changes in CSF pH and PCO 2 reflect intracranial metabolisms after SAH.
In the steady-state condition, ventricular or cisternal CSF pH and PCO 2 closely approximate brain tissue pH and PCO 2 [ ], and are more closely related than lumbar CSF to arterial blood during acute changes in acid-base status [ ]. The cisternal CSF has a pH that is higher than the lumbar CSF pH but lower than the arterial blood pH, and the PCO 2 is lower than the lumbar CSF PCO 2 but higher than the arterial blood PCO 2 , while bicarbonate levels were similar in the CSF and arterial blood [ , ]. In brain diseases, a difference in pH may be extended between cisternal and lumbar CSF: cisternal CSF may be affected by the composition of the CSF secreted in an altered brain region as well as in a normal brain area, while the normal metabolism of the spinal cord may have a greater influence on the lumbar CSF. However, owing to the greater bulk of the brain and pumping effect of the choroid plexus pulsations, lumbar CSF becomes involved in any intracranial pathology [ ]. In this study, patients with DCI were more frequently treated with CSF drainage, and had higher CSF pH and lower CSF PCO 2 , especially in the CSF from lumbar and cisternal drains. The findings may reflect impaired CSF circulation, and clot volume or clearance rate associated with SAH, surgery, and CSF drainage.
There is little question that early (pre-hemolysis) removal of subarachnoid or intraventricular blood is beneficial in reducing cerebral vasospasm as well as DCI, because the subarachnoid clot causes vasospasm and the erythrocytes have to lyse to cause vasospasm [ ]. Reilly et al. [ ] reported that more initial clot volume and less percentage of clot cleared per day were significant predictors of vasospasm development in SAH patients with no CSF drainage. A prospective randomized controlled trial showed that lumbar drainage of CSF reduced DCI after SAH [ ]. However, any kinds of CSF drainage do not equally remove clots and prevent DCI. Clearance of subarachnoid clots was more rapid in patients treated with lumbar drainage compared to those treated with ventricular drainage: lumbar drainage might promote CSF circulation and accelerate clot clearance, while ventricular drainage might flow back into the natural CSF circulation and cause stasis of hemorrhage within the subarachnoid spaces [ ]. In Japan, removal of the subarachnoid clot during early aneurysm surgery and placement of a cisternal drain to eliminate residual clot are the treatments of choice for prevention of cerebral vasospasm, but the effects are limited possibly because surgery itself may cause impaired subarachnoid space or CSF circulation [ , ]. In addition, one study reported that CSF drainage (ventricular drainage, cisternal drainage, lumbar drainage, or a combination of these) was detrimental to vasospasm [ ]. The following explanations were considered: (1) drained CSF might alter the CSF pathway or decrease physiological CSF circulation, delaying natural clot clearance; and (2) CSF drainage might remove clots at the site of drainage but fail to remove them at other sites because of impaired subarachnoid space due to residual clots and surgery. These findings suggest that CSF drainage in general promotes clot clearance and prevent DCI, but sometimes CSF drainage negatively acts on the development of DCI when the drainage does not efficiently work on clot clearance and just removes the supernatant CSF. In this study, total hemoglobin concentrations in the drained or tapped CSF were higher in patients with no DCI compared with patients with DCI at any sampling time, suggesting that CSF hemoglobin was not efficiently removed in patients with DCI who were usually treated with CSF drainage, especially cisternal drainage. Thus, drained CSF might contain less anaerobic acid metabolites in the clot in patients with DCI as well, resulting in higher pH.
The mechanism of changes in CSF pH after SAH is not completely understood, but drained CSF alkalosis may be a sign of inappropriate CSF drainage that fails to remove blood and acid metabolites efficiently, resulting in a higher concentration of so-called spasmogens in the periarterial space, and leading to DCI. Higher CSF pH and lower CSF PCO 2 may also independently reduce cerebral blood flow by constricting arteries and arterioles, contributing to DCI [ ]. Other possible mechanisms include a physiological rise in cerebral perfusion due to stimulated neural activities such as seizure and spreading depression that increases clearance of CO 2 and therefore locally increases brain interstitial pH [ ]. However, it is unlikely because of the following two reasons: (1) the phenomenon is usually followed by an acidosis [ ], but higher CSF pH continued during the observation period in patients with DCI in this study; and (2) spreading depression is reported to cause ischemia rather than increased cerebral blood flow in damaged SAH brain, causing DCI [ ]. It is also reported that intracellular acidosis during the acute phase progresses to alkalosis during the subacute or chronic phase in adult ischemic brain injury and neonatal hypoxia-ischemia brain injury [ , ]. The possible mechanisms are considered to be the presence of phagocytic cells, gliosis, altered buffering mechanisms, and/or luxury perfusion [ , ]. If the phenomena can be applied to SAH, early brain injuries from transient global cerebral ischemia due to the elevated intracranial pressure at an aneurysmal rupture may cause higher CSF pH [ ]. Further studies are needed in this regard.
The major limitations of this study are that the treatment decisions were not protocolized and depended on each neurosurgeon’s judgment, and that clot clearance rate was not measured. As a next step, we should conduct a prospective controlled study, in which the relationships among CSF drainage methods, initial clot volume, daily clot clearance rate, CSF pH, CSF PCO 2 , and DCI should be determined.
In conclusion, this study revealed new potential contributors to the development of DCI, higher CSF pH, and lower CSF PCO 2 . Further studies are needed to clarify the significance and to explore new therapies based on the findings.
