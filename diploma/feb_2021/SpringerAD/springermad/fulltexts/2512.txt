Introduction
Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is characterized by loss of function of the lower motor neurons, leading to muscle wasting and weakness (Ebert et al. ). Most functional SMN protein is produced from the SMN1 gene (Frugier et al. ; Briese et al., ). SMA is classified according to severity and age of onset into five types (Hamilton and Gillingwater ; Lefebvre et al., ). There are widely five types of SMA classified based on the age of onset and symptoms. Type 0 is used to describe neonates who have a history of decreased fetal movements and severe muscle weakness. In this case, the weakness is probably of prenatal onset. Infants with Type 0 may have a respiratory failure in early stages of life reducing life expectancy whereas most are unable to survive beyond six months of age. Type I (Werdnig-Hoffman disease) is the most severe form of SMA. Onset is at birth or within the first few months (Eleni et al., ). Development of limbs is delayed, and most of the infants require assistance to sit or support their heads. Type II is characterized by muscle weakness that develops in children between ages 6 and 12 months. Affected children need assistance to walk or sit, but they can sit without support. Type III (Kugelberg-Welander disease or juvenile type) is a milder form that typically develops between early childhood and adolescence. Muscle weakness affects walking or strenuous physical activity beyond a certain extent. Type IV or adult-onset SMA often occurs after the age of 30. Affected individuals usually experience mild to moderate muscle weakness, tremor, twitching, or mild breathing problems (Palladino et al., ). The symptoms can vary from mild muscle weakness to tremors and muscle weakness and wasting. However, irrespective of the disease’s severity, 95% of all patients have a homozygous deleted SMN1 while the remaining 5% carry mutations such as missense and nonsense mutations.
The SMN1 gene located on chromosome 5q13, is a part of a duplicated region and contains many repetitive sequences. SMN1, a telomeric copy containing nine exons encoding SMN1 protein (Markowitz et al. ). An identical copy of this gene called SMN2 is the centromeric form and differs in a single nucleotide (C > T) in exon 7, which leads to exon seven being spliced out, thereby producing a truncated version of the protein (Sugaman et al., ; Yu-jin et al., ; Finkel et al., ; Qu et al., ). Spinal muscular atrophy is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations or deletion of both the alleles of the SMN1 gene (Azzouz et al., ). SMN1 protein is found throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus, especially near the Cajal bodies, and functions as part of a multi-protein complex containing 294 amino acids. It plays an essential role in the formation of the spliceosomal complex and small nuclear ribonuclear protein (snRNP) biogenesis and pre-mRNA splicing (Workman et al. ; Gubitz et al., ; Mourelatos et al., ; Pellizzoni et al., ). In snRNP biogenesis, SMN1 proteins bind directly to Sm proteins, a critical intermediate in its biogenesis. SMN1 plays a vital role in the processing of snRNPs and snoRNPs; it is speculated that it can also play a role in RNA metabolism and RNA splicing. All these functions are affected in SMA individuals. In neurons, SMN1 protein has been observed in the axons. However, a neuron-specific function of the protein has not been elucidated yet. The known functionality is derived from its ubiquitous expression. Mutations in SMN1 in neurons can lead to restriction of the development of the motor neurons (Monani, ). Deletions in SMN1 are most frequently reported to be causing SMA. Nevertheless there are also reported missense mutations/variants in SMN1 leading to SMA (Alias et al. ; Li ; Kolb and Kissel, ). There were reports concluding the influence of missense mutations in SMN protein interactions thereby disrupting SMN-complex assembly (Sun et al. ), mRNA nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) and exon skipping (Brichta et al. ; Qu et al. ). There is very little research carried out in understanding the impact of these missense mutations on the SMN1 protein function and structure (Li ).
In the current study, we aimed to analyze the effect of the missense mutations in SMN1 that affects the protein function and structure using computational methods. Computational structural biology has helped the scientific field in unraveling the impact of mutations in various genes (Gopalakrishnan et al., ; Doss et al., ; Sneha et al., ). Consequently, in the current study, a systematic review was performed to understand the significance of missense mutations in SMN1. We collected the mutations in the SMN1 gene fromvarious publicly available databases and subjected to pathogenic and stability in silico tool prediction analysis using SIFT (Sim et al. ), PolyPhen-1, PolyPhen-2 (Adzhubei et al. ), SNAP (Johnson et al. ), PhD-SNP (Capriotti et al. ), and MAPP (Stone and Sidow ) and iStable (Chen et al. ), I-Mutant 2.0 (Capriotti et al. ), and MUpro (Cheng et al. ). Also, we analyzed the frequency of each mutation and correlated with the in silico findings. Finally, we used MDS to analyses structural/functional changes caused due to the mutations.
Materials and methods
Search strategy and selection criteria
We conducted a systematic search on all peer-reviewed articles on SMA using three different databases (PubMed, PMC, and Google Scholar) to capture all the missense mutations in the SMN1 gene. We used the search terms: “Mutations and SMN1” OR “Mutations and SMA” OR “Spinal muscular dystrophy AND Mutations” OR “Spinal muscular dystrophy AND Variants.” The data collected were reviewed independently by three scientists (GD, SP, and HZ) to be certain that the data was captured correctly. The discrepancies between authors were resolved through discussion. The full-text articles were systematically analyzed to capture all missense mutations in SMN1 that are known to be causative for SMA, and only the studies that contain missense mutations were captured for further analysis (Fig. 1 ). Fig. 1 Flow diagram showing the steps of studies selection
Risk bias assessment
The Risk of bias was evaluated using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) recommendation. This strategy includes both a quantitative and qualitative assesment. The quantitative analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis and was confined to data derived from the databases. This assessment included data retrieval and duplication removal. While qualitative improvement assessment inclusion was adequate data generation, full text article accessebility, and description of exclusions. A consequent flowchart was designed to improve the search strategy (Fig. 1 ).
Pathogenicity of the mutations
The collected mutations were subjected to pathogenic analysis and stability analysis, such as SIFT (Sim et al. ), PolyPhen-1, PolyPhen-2 (Adzhubei et al. ), SNAP (Johnson et al. ), PhD-SNP (Capriotti et al. ), and MAPP (Stone and Sidow ).
Statistical analysis
The statistical analysis of the pathogenic prediction tools was carried out to understand the level of accuracy in the prediction. The disease-causing mutations were taken as “positive” and the neutral mutations as “negative.” The True Positive (TP), True Negative (TN), False Positive (FP), and False Negative (FN). Using the values, nine parameters such as sensitivity, specificity, Precision, Predictive value, Positive rate, negative rate, discovery rate, accuracy and Matthews Correlation Coefficient were used to assess the pathogenic prediction tool results.
NPV: negative predictive value is also a measure of the performance of a test, but it determines the true negatives – Healthy – of the test, and it is calculated by $$ \mathrm{NPV}=\frac{\mathrm{TN}}{\left(\mathrm{FN}+\mathrm{TN}\right)} $$
Sensitivity or true positive rate (TPR) is a measure to test the ability of the test to determine the diseased individuals, and it is calculated by the equation $$ \mathrm{Sensitivity}=\frac{\mathrm{TP}}{\left(\mathrm{FN}+\mathrm{TP}\right)} $$
False negative rate (FNR) is a calculated by the equation $$ \mathrm{FNR}=1-\frac{\mathrm{TP}}{\left(\mathrm{FN}+\mathrm{TP}\right)} $$
Specificity or true negative rate (TNR) is a measure to test the ability of the test to determine the non-diseased individuals, and it is calculated by the equation $$ \mathrm{Specificity}=\frac{\mathrm{TN}}{\left(\mathrm{FP}+\mathrm{TN}\right)} $$
The false positive rate is calculated by the equation $$ \mathrm{FPR}=1-\frac{\mathrm{TN}}{\left(\mathrm{FP}+\mathrm{TN}\right)} $$
ACC: Accuracy: a measurement that determines the degree of relation between the result and the correct value and it is measured by $$ \mathrm{Accuracy}=\frac{\left(\mathrm{TP}+\mathrm{TN}\right)}{\left(\mathrm{TP}+\mathrm{FP}+\mathrm{FN}+\mathrm{TN}\right)} $$
MCC : Matthews correlation coefficient is a balanced measure calculated using the formula: $$ MCC=\frac{TP\times TN- FP\times FN}{\sqrt{\left( TP+ FP\right)\left( TP+ FN\right)\left( TN+ FP\right)\left( TN+ FN\right)}} $$
TP, TN, FP, and FN are the True positive, True Negative, False Positive and False Negative results of each mutation. True positives (TP): These refer to the positive mutants that were correctly labeled by the tool. True negatives (TN): These are the negative mutants that were correctly labeled by the tool. False positives (FP): These are the negative mutants that were incorrectly labeled as positive. False negatives (FN): These are the positive mutants that were mislabeled as negative.
Stability analysis of the mutants
In silico prediction tools such as iStable (Chen et al. ), I-Mutant 2.0 (Capriotti et al. ), and MUpro (Cheng et al. ) were utilized in analyzing the stability of the protein. iStable is a consensus tool that provides a consensus result of I-Mutant2.0 and MUpro tool.
Conservation analysis
The conservation analysis of the protein was carried out using the Consurf tool. The tool predicts the level of conservation of each amino acid at its position. The level of conservation is determined by drawing a Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) across species of the same protein. The level of conservation is marked between 0 to 9 in ConSurf (Glaser et al. ). The amino acid at a particular position with a score of ‘9’ determines the highest conservation and a score of‘0’ predicts the least conserved amino acid. Along with conservation, the tool also predicts the structural/functional impact of the amino acid over the protein. The buried and exposed regions of the protein are also marked.
Macromolecule preparation
In the absence of crystal structure of the protein in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), we have modeled the three dimensional (3D) structure of the protein using Phyre2 (Protein Homology/analogy Recognition Engine) server available at http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/~phyre2/html/page.cgi?id=index (Kelley et al., ). This server helps in predicting the structure of the protein using four significant steps that initially searches for homologous sequences, fold library scanning, loop modeling, and side chain placement. The input for the server is in the form of a FASTA sequence of the protein obtained from UniProt database. Further, the protein was modeled using a protein structure with PDB ID 4QQ6 as a template. The modeled protein was further validated using RAMPAGE server that uses Ramachandran plot to validate the stereochemistry of the protein. Obtained structure was considered as the native protein molecule, and the variant proteins were prepared using PyMOL. The resulting protein models were then subjected to energy minimization to avoid any bad contacts using SWISS-PDB Viewer (Guex and Peitsch ).
Physiochemical property analysis
The physiochemical properties of the native and the mutant amino acid were compared using Amino acid NCBI explorer.
Molecular dynamics simulation studies
The molecular dynamics analysis was carried out using GROMACS 4.6.3 package (Hess et al. ). The native and the mutant protein models were used as the starting structure for the MDS studies. The topology of the native and the mutant models was constructed using Gromacs force field. A cubic box of 1.0 Å was used to fit the native protein model along with SPC water molecules. Further, the genion tool was used to calculate the ions and neutralize the system. As a next step, the entire system was subjected to energy minimization until a minimum of 1000KJ/mol was obtained. The whole energy minimized system was then equilibrated using two steps: canonical ensembles and isobaric-isothermal ensembles. Each of the equilibration step was carried out for 50,000 steps until an equilibration in the system was observed. As a final step, the production of MD of 30 ns was carried out until a complete convergence of the native protein was observed. A similar protocol was used for the variant protein models to have better comparative analysis.
Results
Study selection and data extraction
The search strategy yielded 1661 citations; of which 220 remained after duplications removal; citations that were irrelevant were then excluded from the current study. As described in the Materials and Methods section, the identified 53 (full text) citations were screened for inclusion criteria. The final screening analysis yielded 39 studies with 26 missense mutations in the SMN1 protein that reported to be disease-causing.
Pathogenic impact of the mutations
The in silico mutation analysis was performed using various pathogenic and stability analysis tools to predict the impact of the mutation on the protein’s function or structure. All the mutations were subjected to SIFT, PolyPhen-1, PolyPhen-2, SNAP, PhD-SNP, and MAPP. SIFT predicted 21 missense mutations to be pathogenic, PolyPhen-1 predicted 18 mutations to be pathogenic, while both PolyPhen-2 and SNAP predicted 22 mutations to be showing a pathogenic effect. PhD-SNP predicted 16 mutations to be having a pathogenic effect. Finally, MAPP showed 24 mutations to be having pathogenic effect. A consensus tool analysis was made to remove the false positives (Table 1 ).
Statistical analysis
The statistical analysis was carried out evaluate the efficiency of each tool prediction. PolyPhen-2, SNAP, and MAPP showed the highest specificity with a specificity value of 0.8696, 0.8261, and 0.8636, respectively. Of all the tools, highest Specificity was observed in the case of PolyPhen-1. Accuracy more than 0.7 was observed in all the tools except, SIFT (0.6923) and PhD SNP (0.5769). Mathew’s correlation coefficient predicted all the tools to be showing less than 0, which predicts that the results obtained by these tools are considerable. Of all the tools, we found PhD-SNP to be least performing tool and PolyPhen-2 showed the best performing among all the tools (Table 2 ).
Stability analysis
As a next step, the mutations were subjected to stability analysis using iStable, I-Mutant 2.0 and MuPro. We observed that 16 mutations showed a decrease in the stability of the protein (Table 3 ). We compared the pathogenic and stability tools and found that three mutations showed both pathogenic and stability affects the protein.
Conservation analysis
Conservation analysis was made by constructing an MSA with the SMN1 protein across species. Aspartate at 44 positions was found to highly conserved with a score of 9. Along with being highly conserved, this amino acid also showed a functional significance. The Aspartate is also found to be in the exposed region of the protein. When analyzing the conservation of amino acid at position 272 and 277, the tyrosine at both position showed conservation score of 9. Tyrosine at position 272 was found to be showing functional activity and exposed region. While the tyrosine at 277 position shows a structural significance and is in the buried region (Fig. 2 ). Fig. 2 ConSurf tool results. The amino acids highlighted in red box indicate the variant position. All the three mutant positions are highly conserved with a score of 9. *f- functional residue, s- structural residue, e- exposed residue, b- buried residue
Molecule preparation and mutation analysis
In the absence of 3D coordinate file for the human SMN1, we performed molecular modeling on the native protein sequence of the SMN1; we obtained seven models constructed on the various templates. On analyzing the templates and the similarity percentage along with coverage, we selected two models. The protein models were then subjected to stereochemistry optimization and validated using RAMPAGE. MODEL1 showed comparatively higher scores; therefore, we used it in the current study. Further, this model was considered as the native model and mutations in the protein as the specific site was made using PyMOL The protein models were then energy minimized using SWISS PDBViewer, and all the models showed lesser values indicating better predictive structure. These models were used as starting structure for molecular dynamics simulation analysis.
Physiochemical property analysis
The physiochemical properties of the amino acids (native and mutant) were compared using NCBI amino acid explorer tool. The tool depicts that there is a loss of H-bonds, aromatic stacking, and reduction in the size of the amino acid when there is a substitution of Tyrosine with cysteine. Whereas, there was conservation of hydrophobicity and polarity between the native and variant amino acid. Meanwhile, a substitution of valine with aspartate leads to the absence of potential H-bonds, increase in hydrophobicity and conversion of negative to a non-polar amino acid.
Molecular dynamics simulation analysis
The resultant trajectory files of the MDS were used for evaluating the structural and functional changes observed between the native and the mutant proteins. Root Mean Square deviation (RMSD) of the protein was used to understand the stable nature of the protein. At 30 ns, the native protein showed complete convergence at an RMSD of ~0.7 nm. Consequently, the mutants were also subjected to similar MD analysis. The RMSD plot shows that the mutants Y272C and Y277C have similar deviation patterns, where the Y277C showed the highest deviating pattern with an RMSD value of ~0.9 nm. While D44V showed a much similar deviating pattern to that of the native protein and showed convergence at an RMSD value of ~0.8 nm (Fig. 3 ). This predicts a lesser stable structure in case of Y277C protein. Further, RMSF was calculated to understand the fluctuations of the protein. We understood that both RMSD and RMSF plots showed similar kind of observation. We observed that Y277C showed higher fluctuations compared to the native and the other mutant proteins (D44V and Y272C) (Fig. 4 ). Although there were no local changes observed, we observed global changes in the native and the mutant proteins. Fig. 3 Root Mean Square Deviation of the native and mutants in SMN1. Color code: Black, native; Red, D44V; Green, Y272C and Blue, Y277C Fig. 4 Root Mean Square Fluctuation of the native and mutants in SMN1. Color code: Black, native; Red, D44V; Green, Y272C and Blue, Y277C
To investigate the level of the compactness of the mutants versus the native protein, the proteins were subjected to the radius of gyration (Rg) analysis (Fig. 5 ). The Rg plot depicted native protein with a least Rg value of 1 nm, and Y277C is exhibiting the highest Rg values of ~ 2 nm, predicting the least compactness showed by Y277C mutant protein. The Y272C exhibited much similar compactness to that of the Y277C protein and D44V showed similar compactness to that of the native protein. Hence, both Y277C and Y272C showed lesser compactness in comparison to D44V protein. Fig. 5 Radius of gyration (Rg) of the native and mutants in SMN1. Color code: Black, native; Red, D44V; Green, Y272C and Blue, Y277C
Finally, to understand the loss of stability and compactness as predicted by RMSD and Rg, we performed intramolecular hydrogen bond analysis to predict any change in the number of hydrogen bonds formed at the end of the simulation in the native and mutant proteins. The hydrogen bond analysis predicted that there was a noticeable decrease in the number of intermolecular hydrogen bonds at the end of the simulation in Y277C and Y272C protein. We observed a very negligible difference in case of D44V mutant (Fig. 6 ). Fig. 6 Intramolecular Hydrogen bonds analysis of the native and mutants in SMN1.

Discussion
Research is being conducted concerning SMA to find therapeutic targets for disease treatment. Existing approaches include the use of antisense oligonucleotides (ASO). These are synthetic RNA molecules that bind to target sequences near SMN1 gene that can enhance or downregulate splicing events (Havens et al. ). Gene therapy has also been considered as a possible remedy wherein the missing SMN1 gene can be replaced (Mulcahy et al. ). Possible use of stem cell therapy to replace lost or weak muscles or to fight atrophy is being considered. Synthetic drugs like Nusinersen have been used for treating SMA (Chiriboga ). Although deletions in SMN1 have shown more prevalence in comparison to the missense mutations, there are also reports of missense mutations in patients with SMA. The prevalence of missense mutations is quite abnormal in this protein, yet show a pathological significance. Understanding the role of missense mutations has been already well established using computational macroscopic tools that aid in revealing the structural/functional changes (Sneha et al., ; Rajendran et al., ; Thirumal Kumar et al., ; Sneha and George Priya Doss, ; Rajendran et al., ). Subsequently, in the current study, we aim to analyze the impact of missense mutations in on the SMN1 protein structure and function using state-of-the-art computational analysis, to help in the discovery of potential targets for therapeutics.
We collected the missense mutations in three different public literature and mutation databases, and we subjected these mutations to a series of the computational pipeline by analyzing the pathogenicity, stability, and structural changes. The pathogenicity tools predicted 12 mutations to be highly pathogenic (Table 1 ) and the stability tools predicted 16 mutation protein destabilizing. Three mutations (D44V, Y272C, and Y277C) were found to be the pathogenic and destabilizing to the protein, and highly conserved, with conservation score of 9 using the ConSurf tool (Fig. 2 ); therefore, we prioritized these mutations for further structural analysis to understand the molecular structure pathology of these mutations. We have shown earlier that these techniques can be beneficial in variant interpretation and classification, and will serve as platform for potential drug discovery (Sneha and George Priya Doss, ; Rajendran, ; Sneha et al., ; Agrahari et al., , ; George Priya Doss and Zayed ; Zaki et al. ; Mosaeilhy et al. ). A residue at the buried region with structural effect having an aliphatic nature has a potential contribution to the stability of the protein (Fig. 2 ). Substitution of cysteine reduces the number of hydrogen bonds thereby decreasing the interaction with surrounding amino acids (Table 5 ) (Table 3 ).

Since the missense mutations are known to be predicted less in the case of SMN1 leading to SMA, we aimed at analyzing the frequency of each mutation. When comparing the frequency, we observed that S230 L has the highest frequency among all the mutations (Table 4 ), and predicted to be neutral by in silico prediction tools, which is consistent with the SMA patients mild phenotype. Whereas the other three mutants (D44V, Y272C, and Y277C) showed, the-highest deleterious effect was predicted to be having a pathological effect consistent with the reported studies (Li ; Qu et al., ). Thus in the current study, we analyzed the effect of these three variants through MDS analysis. Use of state-of-the-art bioinformatics tools to predict the effect of mutation/variant over protein function and structure has provided better insights (Sneha et al., ; George Priya Doss et al. ; George Priya Doss and Rajith ; Agrahari et al. ; Sneha and George Priya Doss ; Sneha and Doss, ) we were able to predict mutant Y277C with highest destabilizing activity through RMSD and RMSF analysis (Fig. 3 ). The compactness also concluded that Y277C showed the least compactness in comparison to other mutants (Fig. 4 ). Finally, hydrogen bond analysis also included a point that Y277C showed a decrease in the number of hydrogen bonds (Fig. 5 ). An increase in the RMSD may affect the stability changes of the protein (Yun and Guy ). Similarly, we observed an increase in the RMSD values of all the variant proteins in comparison to native. The decrease in compactness as observed in the Rg (Fig. 5 ) correlates with the decrease in the stability as observed in the RMSD (Fig. 3 ). This loss of stability and compactness were further correlated with the hydrogen bond analysis (Fig. 6 ).

A decrease in the number of intramolecular hydrogen bonds directly affects the stability of the protein (Ali et al., ). Hence, a decrease in the hydrogen bond may have contributed to the reduction in the stability, which is consistent with the RMSD analysis. This decrease in hydrogen bond was also accounted for the physiochemical property changes as observed in Table 5 . A combination of in silico predictions along with structural analysis has provided better insights on the functional and structural differences caused in the protein (Gopalakrishnan et al., ; Kamaraj and Purohit, ; Rajendran et al., ). To our knowledge, this is the first study, that has used computational pipeline along with systematic review strategy to understand the impact of missense mutations of SMN1 leading to SMA. This study not only reduces the experimental burden but also sheds light on the potential impact of the missense mutations that may pave the way for personalized medicine and better treatment strategies.

Conclusion
In this study, we collected all possible missense mutations in the SMN1 gene, and analyzed their possible degree of pathogenicity, stability, conservation scores. Three mutations (D44V, Y272C, and Y277C) were the most deleterious and destabilizing to the protein. From the physiochemical property analysis, we were able to predict the loss of aromatic stacking in Y272C and Y277C mutants leading to a structural change. Consequently, the three mutations were selected for further analysis using MDS studies revealed that the mutants Y272C and Y277C were most deviated from the native type as compared to D44V. Correlating the results from in silico predictions, physiochemical analysis, and MDS, we were able to observe a loss of stability in all the three mutants. Furthermore, loss of hydrogen bonds was observed in the physiochemical comparative analysis (mutants Y272C and Y277C) which correlated with the intramolecular hydrogen bond analysis of the MDS. This loss of aliphatic stacking and hydrogen bond analysis could be a plausible reason behind the loss of stability in the mutant proteins, specifically Y272C and Y277C. Our combinatorial approach of in silico predictions with structural analysis using MDS will provide better insights on the functional and structural differences between mutant and native type proteins. This is expected to be the future for variant assessment and classification, and will serve as a platform for drug discovery, and contribute to better understanding of the intricacy of the correlation between the mutant proteins and their potential clinical phenotypes in patients with genetic diseases, including SMA.
