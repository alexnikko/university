Introduction
Reports on plants with therapeutic values and many scientific-based evidence had showed their efficacy for management/treatment of many pathology diseases (Akinmoladun et al. ). However, the thin wall between real medicines and orthodox/folklore medicine is the therapeutic dose and safety of these proved and ascertained plants (Oboh et al. ). Toxicants are referred to as substances which are harmful to living organisms due to damage effect on tissues, organs, or biological process (Crosby and Crosby ). Some medicinal plants are wrongly grouped in this category because their safe doses were not ascertained. Toxicity testing is therefore necessary in others to provide handful information on plants that are said to contain bio-compounds of medicinal value before used (Gupta Bhardwaj et al. ). According to Toxic Substance Control Act, a toxic effect is referred to as an adverse change in the function/structure of an experimental animal due to exposure to chemical substance (Ware ). In recent years, there is an increase in reports of cases of adverse effects of herbal products, even in the developed countries, which is purportedly caused by prescribed herbal products or local medicines by traditional health workers (Odubanjo et al., ).
Those toxicity cases could be a result of excessive use of herbal products as their safe dose had not been established. Problems from such toxicity could include hepatic porphyria, haemorrhages in various organs, and injury which may affect the biological function of the whole organism (Mohamed et al., ). Hence, it is important to ascertain the safety of medicinal plants before use, especially those that had been accepted to be efficacious in the management of different human illness. This would prevent the incidence of organ dysfunction diseases (Tédong et al. ).
Guava ( Psidium guajava ) tree is a common plant in the western part of Nigeria with distinct green colour leaf with a leathery texture. The fruit is many seeded, varying in size and shape (globose, ovoid elongated, or pear shaped), which is determined by its variety. There are different varieties of guava, and the common ones in Nigeria are white, red, and pink-fleshy fruit. There have been several reports on the medicinal use of different parts of the plant; for example, Lin et al. ( ) reported on the retardation of the propulsion of charcoal meal and inhibition of the PGE 2 -induced enteropooling by the aqueous extract of guava leaves. Also, the leaf and fruit had been used for the management/treatment of liver diseases, cough, and high blood pressure (Ojewole ; Roy et al. ; Ayub et al. ). Extract from the guava leaf had also been used as antibacterial, antidiarrheal, antidiabetic, and antirheumatism in folklore medicine (Ross ; Arima and Danno ; Sunagawa et al. ; Gorinstein et al. ). Most reports on guava are centred on the plant with no emphasis on toxicological evaluation of different varieties of the plant (Metwally et al. ; Anand et al., Manikandan and Vijaya Anand ). As a result, this research work is aimed at evaluating the safety of aqueous extract of different varieties (white, red and pink) of guava leaves.
Material and method
Chemicals and reagents
Randox kits from Randox Laboratories (UK) were used for the determination of creatinine (CR 510, LOT 438292), aspartate aminotransferase (AS 101, LOT 366871), alkaline phosphatase (AP 307, LOT 420643), alanine aminotransferase (AL 100, LOT 366877), uric acid (UA 230, LOT 441332), and urea (UR 1068, LOT 453917); other reagents used were of analytical grade, and water was glass distilled water.
Animal care and handling
Female Wistar strain albino rats (150–180 g) of about 10–12 weeks old were procured from Department of Veterinary medicine, University of Ibadan, Nigeria, breeding colony. The rats were maintained under regulated laboratory conditions of 25 ± 5 °C, with ambient humidity. They were fed with standard rat chow with free access to water, on 12 h day and night cycle.
The handling and use of animals for this study was approved by the institution’s ethical committee for the use of animals in the laboratory experiments (reference number JABU/CNS/AEC/1703), which is in accordance with the outlined Guide for the Care and use of Laboratory Animals prepared by the National Academy Science and published by the National Institute of Health (USA). The extracts were administered through oral gavage; animals’ well-being during the experiments was monitored strictly with guidelines for national and institutional protection for animals (Public Health Service ).
Sample collection and extract preparation
Fresh sample leaves of WGL, RGL, and PGL were collected from different gardens within Akure south local government area of Ondo State. Authentication was carried out at the Department of Biological Sciences, Joseph Ayo Babalola University, Ikeji Arakeji, Osun State, Nigeria, with voucher number JABU/CNS/BIO/130, JABU/CNS/BIO/131, and JABU/CNS/BIO/132, respectively, which was deposited in the University herbarium. The leaves were rinsed with tap water and air dried to mimic conventional preparation of the sample in many Nigerians homes; thereafter, the dried leaves were pulverized and extracted (1:5 w / v ) with distilled water for 24 h in an orbital shaker. It was filtered with No. 1 Whatman filter paper. Thereafter, the filtrate was freeze dried and kept at 4 °C until required. It was later reconstituted in distilled water for subsequent analysis (Oboh et al. ).
Acute toxicology test
The acute toxicity test of the sample extracts was carried out using 50 female albino rats using the method described by Patrick-Iwuanyanwu et al., (Patrick-Iwuanyanwu Kingsley et al. ) in accordance with OECD guideline, ( ). The animals were divided into 10 groups of 5 animals each, group 1 received 1 ml distilled water through oral gavage in other to be submitted to same stress and served as control, and groups 2, 3, and 4 received 50, 500, and 5000 mg/kg BWT of WGL extract respectively. Groups 5, 6, and 7 received 50, 500, and 5000 mg/kg BWT of RGL extract respectively; groups 8, 9, and 10 received 50, 500, and 5000 mg/kg BWT PGL extract respectively. The experimental rats were monitored for 14 days. They were observed for changes in skin and fur, mucous membrane, eye, and behavioural patter. Their body weights were recorded every 2 days throughout the experimental period. There was a daily evaluation for toxicity signs but not limited to salivation, stretching on the floor and wall of cage, paw licking, stooling, and death.
Biochemical analysis
At the end of the 14th day of the experiment, the animals were starved overnight and euthanized by cervical dislocation and blood collected by cardiac puncture into non-heparinized tubes; the blood samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min. The serum separated was estimated for ALT, ALP, AST, bilirubin, urea, creatinine, and uric acid, using the method described in the Randox kits manual. The BUN was calculated. The organs (liver and kidney) were isolated and rapidly placed on ice and weighed. The organs were subsequently homogenized and centrifuged to obtain clear supernatant, which was used for lipid peroxidation assay Oboh et al. ( ).
Statistical analysis
Values were expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). One-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey’s post hoc and significant difference analysis at ( p < 0.05) was performed using GraphPad Prism 5.
Result and discussion
Presented in Table 1 is the difference in body weight (BWT) of the experimental rats. There was no significant ( p > 0.05) reduction in body weights throughout the experimental period when treated groups were compared with the control group. One of the essential factor used in monitoring the health of an animal is the body weight; significant body weight loss is the foremost sign of onset of an adverse effect (Philips et al. ). Non-significant weight loss signifies no sign of toxicity.

For clinical evaluation, assessment of the animal behaviour was daily observed throughout the experimental period for each treated animal. The observation includes change in condition and colour of the fur, subcutaneous swellings or lumps, sedation, defaecation, gait, and breathing abnormalities, as changes in any of these could signify toxicity (Odubanjo et al., ). However, there was no significant ( p > 0.05) observational changes in any of these, throughout the experimental period for both the control and treated groups (Table 2 ). The rats were observed for mortality twice daily throughout the duration of the experiment. At the highest dose (5000 mg/kg) of the three extracts administered, there was no death recorded indicating that their LD 50 is above 5000 mg/kg. This work conforms with the report of Caceres et al., 1990 that the aqueous extract of guava leaves has no harmful effect, at the LD 50 of 5000 mg/kg (Jaiarj et al. ).

The reaction of free radicals with membrane lipids degrades the polyunsaturated fatty acid; this results in lipid peroxidation, which has its end product of peroxyl radical including malondialdehyde (MDA). The amount of MDA produced is used as a biomarker to quantify the degree of oxidative stress in an organism (Murray et al., ). The results of the tissue (serum, liver, and kidney) MDA level is presented in Table 3 , which revealed no significant ( p > 0.05) increase in the MDA level in all the tested homogenates of the treated rats when compared with the control group. This correlates with the report of Manikandan and Vijaya Anand ( )), where the extracts of guava prevent organ damage and also boost endogenous antioxidant status of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat.

The first line of biochemical parameter in the clinical determination of health status is serum marker enzymes, such as ALT, ALP, AST, bilirubin, creatinine, urea, and uric acid which are domicile in liver and kidney respectively, but found in large amount in serum/plasma in the case of organ damage/dysfunction (Mythilypriya et al. ). The results as presented in Figs. 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 showed that there was no significant difference ( p > 0.05) in the marker enzyme levels of the treated animal when compared with the control for all administered doses. This is in agreement with the report of Roy and Das, (Roy and Das ), where the extracts of P. guajava leaves exert hepatoprotective effect via significant reduction of AST, ALT, ALP, and bilirubin serum levels in carbon tetrachloride– and paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity.

High levels of urea, creatinine, uric acid, and BUN, otherwise known as renal biomarkers in the plasma/serum, are indicators of renal parenchyma damage (Erdem et al. ). As depicted in Figs. 5 , 6 , 7 , and 8 , there were no increases in the amount of renal biomarkers (urea, creatinine, uric acid, and BUN) of the animals at different doses used for this study in relation to the control, which implied that the concentration used in this study does not pose any danger on the kidney function.

Female rats were used for this study because studies have established the fact that female rats are more susceptible to acute toxicity, as described by OECD 423 and 425 guidelines. More also, there are lots of reports on the use of guava leaf ( Psidium guajava ) using male rats (Metwally et al. : Vijaya et al. ). Since reports on this plant are mostly on male subject without considering the female counterparts who also use the plant for the management of various pathologies in folklore as well, it is expedient to evaluate the effect of this plant extract on female folk.
Conclusion
In conclusion, oral administration of leaves extract of guava from different species (white, red, and pink) did not cause death of any of the animals used for this study. There was no toxicity signs, or any pathological observation; the weight gain in the animals was found to be normal; this connotes that white, red, and pink guava leaves extract are safe even at 5000 mg/kg BWT.
