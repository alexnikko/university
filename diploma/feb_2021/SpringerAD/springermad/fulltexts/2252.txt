Background
Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is an ω-3 poly-unsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) that is highly enriched in the brain. DHA can be metabolized into various downstream mediators by the activity of oxidoreductase enzymes, including the lipoxygenases (LOXs), notably: 5-LOX (encoded by Alox5 ), 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX) (encoded by Alox12e ), and 15-LOX (encoded by Alox15 ). Functionally, DHA has been shown to be involved in a many physiological processes including but not limited to neurodevelopment, maintenance of membrane fluidity, memory and cognition, vision, brain glucose uptake, and synaptic transmission, but it is primarily known for its anti-inflammatory effects (Dyall ).
Pyroptosis is a type of proinflammatory programmed cell death that is mediated by activated caspases and terminates in cell swelling and lysis (Miao et al. ). The term “pyroptosis” was originally coined in 2001 to describe programmed cell death of macrophages in response to Salmonella infection (Cookson and Brennan ), and is generally thought to serve as a defense mechanism of the innate immune system. Pyroptosis can be induced by a range of intracellular microbial pathogens including both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, such as Salmonella typhi, Legionella, Francisella , and Staphylococcus aureus , DNA and RNA viruses, and certain toxins such as the anthrax toxin.
In contrast to pyroptosis, apoptotic cell death is characterized by membrane blebbing, nuclear condensation, and DNA fragmentation (Reed ). This results in a noninflammatory form of cell death due to the careful packaging of cytosolic contents into apoptotic bodies ending with degradation by phagocytosis. However, pyroptosis is an inflammatory process that involves inflammasome-mediated caspase activation, membrane pore formation, increased proinflammatory cytokine production (IL-1β and IL-18), cell swelling, and lysis, resulting in the release of cellular contents into the surroundings (Bergsbaken et al. ). While apoptosis can be induced in all cell types, pyroptosis has thus far been shown to occur only in immune cells such as macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils.
In the canonical pyroptosis pathway, an intracellular antigen is detected by pattern recognition receptors on the inflammasome, which proceeds to cleave pro-caspase-1 and release its active subunit (Bergsbaken et al. ). Activated caspase-1 has two important roles in the pyroptosis pathway: (1) to cleave the N-terminal subunit of a 53 kDa protein called Gasdermin D (Gsdmd), and (2) to convert the precursors of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 into their active forms. Gsdmd is known as the executor of pyroptosis. Its N-terminal subunit undergoes oligomerization and forms pores in the plasma membrane. This affects the osmotic balance of the cell, leading to swelling and eventually to cell rupture and release of cytosolic contents including IL-1β and IL-18. These act as chemoattractants for other immune cells, such as neutrophils, which phagocytose the intracellular pathogens and help in their clearance from the body.
It is important to note that while pyroptosis is generally thought to be a response of the innate immune system to pathogen-derived factors, it has been associated with noninfectious disease processes, including that of the central nervous system (CNS) such as stroke. This complex process of “sterile inflammation” involves the activation of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) by damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) (Chen and Nunez ). However, no specific, proximal, endogenous factor has been identified that can activate canonical, caspase-1-mediated pyroptosis in the brain (Rubartelli et al. ).
The current study was performed to investigate the role of DHA in sterile inflammation, using mouse microglial BV-2 cells as an in vitro model. We found that DHA has an expected anti-inflammatory effect at low concentration (30 µM), but higher concentrations result in reduced viability accompanied by cell swelling. This caspase-1-mediated process is dependent on the action of 12-LOX. Cumulatively, this suggests that, although DHA has a direct anti-inflammatory role, it can be metabolized into a novel DAMP that results in the activation of pyroptosis.
Materials and Methods
Materials
DHA (cat #D2534), eicosatrienoic acid (ETI, Pan-LOX inhibitor cat #E3140), baicalein (12-LOX inhibitor cat #465119), and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT, cat #D9542) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (USA). MK886 (5-LOX inhibitor cat #10133), PD146176 (15-LOX inhibitor cat #10010518), and Ac-YVAD-CMK (cat #10014) were obtained from Cayman Chemicals (USA). Hoechst 33342 (cat #H3570) and propidium iodide (cat #P3566) were obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific (USA). DHA and ETI were prepared by solubilizing in methanol, aliquoting, drying under vacuum, and storing the pellets under inert gas at − 30 °C. Pellets were resuspended in sterile-filtered 10% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin at 20 mM and further diluted with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) immediately before use. All other reagents were prepared as 1000× stock concentrations in dimethyl sulfoxide.
Cell Culture
BV-2-immortalized mouse microglial cells (Blasi et al. ) were maintained as a monolayer culture on tissue culture dishes at 37 °C, 5% CO 2 , 100% humidity in DMEM supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, and antibiotics. For morphology studies, cells were photographed under phase-contrast microscopy with a × 20 objective and scored by a blinded researcher. Cells characterized by obvious membrane swelling were designated “pyroptotic.” Cells that exhibited visible membrane blebbing and/or nuclear fragmentation were designated “apoptotic.” All other cells were designated “normal.” Three fields were photographed per well and pooled as a single sample.
Cell Viability/Cell Death Assays
Cell viability was determined by MTT assay as described (Herr et al. ). In brief, BV-2 cells were seeded into 96-well plates at 20,000 cells/well, incubated overnight, and treated for 24 h with the indicated concentrations of DHA. Cells were then incubated with 1 mg/ml MTT reagent for 2 h, washed carefully with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), solubilized with 4 mM HCl/0.1% NP40/isopropanol, and measured at 590 nm with a reference filter of 620 nm on a plate reader. Cell death was evaluated by propidium iodide exclusion assay as described (Herr et al. ). In brief, BV-2 cells were plated in 96-well plates at ~ 50% confluence, incubated overnight, then treated with DHA for 24 h. Cell were treated with Hoechst 33342 (1 mg/ml) and propidium iodide (0.3 mg/ml) for 20 min, washed with PBS, and then photographed with a Cytation 3-automated imager (Biotek Instruments, Inc.). % cell death reflects a ratio of propidium iodide-positive and Hoechst 33342-positive cells. All assays were performed with N = 6. Results are representative of at least three independent experiments.
Electron Microscopy
BV-2 cells were cultured on poly- l -lysine-coated 12-mm glass coverslips, treated with vehicle or 200 µM DHA for 4 h, and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde/3% glutaraldehyde in PBS. Cells were washed, postfixed with 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated through an ethanol series, sputter coated with carbon, and imaged with an FEI Quanta 650 FEG SEM system.
Quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR)
Quantitation of gene expression was performed essentially as described (Thirunavukkarasan et al. ). In brief, total RNA was isolated from BV-2 cells using Trizol reagent (Thermo Scientific, USA). 1 µg of each sample was primed with oligo(dT)18 and random hexamer primers prior using Maxima First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo Scientific, USA). Targets were then amplified with Maxima SYBR Green/ROX qPCR Master Mix (Thermo Scientific, USA) on an Applied Biosystems ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Scientific, USA) using gene-specific primer pairs. Samples were run in triplicate using cDNA prepared from cells from different wells. Relative gene expression was determined using the \({2^{ - \Delta \Delta {{\text{C}}_t}}}\) method as described (Godfrey et al. ).
Caspase Activity Assays
Quantitation of caspase activity was performed using Caspase-Glo 1 kit (cat #G9951) and Caspase-Glo 3/7 (cat #G8091) per manufacturer’s protocol (Promega, USA). BV-2 cells were cultured in black-walled 96-well plates and treated as described overnight. Caspase-Glo reagent was added in an equivalent volume to the cell culture media, incubated at room temperature for 30 min with gentle shaking, and then measured for luminescence on a Tecan Spark 10M microplate reader. Samples were run in triplicate.
Quantification of IL-1β
The concentration of IL-1β protein in cell culture supernatant was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) per manufacturer’s protocol (Thermo Fisher, cat #EM2IL1B). In brief, BV-2 cells were grown in 24-well plates to ~ 70% confluence, and then treated as described for 4 h. Supernatant was collected, diluted with Standard Diluent, applied to the assay plate (100 µl/well), and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Bound IL-β was then detected by sequential incubation with Biotinylated Antibody Reagent, Streptavidin-HRP Solution, and TMB Substrate Solution, followed by absorbance measurement at A 450 . Absolute concentration was determined by comparing with a standard curve.
Statistical Analyses
qRT-PCR data were analyzed by a Student’s t test using Excel version 1803, Microsoft Corp, Redmond, WA, USA, comparing DHA-treated cells to paired vehicle-treated samples. All other data were analyzed by ANOVA with multiple comparisons using Prism version 7.04 for Windows, GraphPad Software, USA.
Results
DHA Reduces LPS-Mediated Inflammation in BV-2 Cells
To determine a suitable DHA concentration for use in cell-based assays, BV-2 cells were treated with the increasing concentrations of DHA and evaluated for viability and cell death (Fig. 1 a). DHA had little effect on cell survival up to 30 µM, but higher concentrations resulted in loss of viability and induction of cell death, with an EC 50 of ~ 45 µM. As a result, 30 µM was used as a high but nontoxic concentration to evaluate the expected anti-inflammatory effect of DHA on the expression of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cytokine expression. As expected, pretreatment with DHA desensitized BV-2 cells to induction of Il1b expression (Fig. 1 b, c), consistent with previous reports (Fourrier et al. ). To determine whether this was due to a direct effect of DHA instead of a metabolite, cells were also pretreated with inhibitors of two major metabolic enzymes: 5-LOX (Fig. 1 b) and 15-LOX (Fig. 1 c). With both treatments, the anti-inflammatory effect of DHA was potentiated, suggesting that DHA, rather than its metabolic products, directly inhibits Il1b expression.

Expression of IL1B was evaluated by qRT-PCR
DHA-Mediated Cell Death Is Due to Activation of Pyroptosis
BV-2 cells treated with 200 µM DHA were visually inspected to evaluate for morphological evidence of programmed cell death versus nonspecific cell death mechanisms (Fig. 2 a–c). Surprisingly, there were few cells that exhibited characteristics of apoptosis, such as membrane blebs and pyknotic nuclei. Rather, the majority of cells displayed an increase in size and evidence of cytoplasmic swelling, which are characteristic features of pyroptosis (Fig. 2 c). Notably, this process was rapid, becoming apparent within 1 h of treatment and coming to completion within 4 h. By contrast, activation of apoptosis by treatment with cisplatin (200 µM) was markedly slower, displaying characteristic membrane blebs after 2 h and failing to reach completion by 4 h (Supplementary data 1–3). Cytoplasmic swelling was not observed in cells treated with 200 µM arachidonic acid (AA), suggesting that activation of this process is unlikely to be a nonspecific effect of PUFAs (Fig. 2 b). Furthermore, induction of the canonical pyroptosis pathway results in the formation of Gasdmd-mediated membrane pores. To evaluate this, we performed scanning electron microscopy on vehicle- and DHA-treated cells (Fig. 2 d–g). While the vehicle-treated cells remained intact, the surfaces of DHA-treated cells were pockmarked with pores over the entire surface.

To provide molecular evidence for the activation of pyroptosis versus apoptosis, we evaluated the activities of caspase-1 and caspase-3/caspase-7 in these cells after 4-h treatment (Fig. 3 a, b). DHA caused a > threefold increase in caspase-1 activity and a 50% increase in caspase-3/7, consistent with the activation of pyroptosis. By contrast, cisplatin, which activates apoptosis via caspase-3 and caspase-8 (Seki et al. ), causes a > twofold increase in caspase-3/7 with no significant effect on caspase-1. To confirm that the increase in caspase-1 activity is a causative factor in the pyroptosis-like morphology, BV-2 cells were pretreated with a specific inhibitor of caspase-1, Ac-YVAD-CMK, prior to DHA stimulation (Fig. 3 c). This resulted in nearly a threefold reduction in swollen cells, consistent with the marked attenuation of pyroptosis. In addition, since activation of pyroptosis results in the cleavage of pro-IL1β and the release of mature IL1β, we evaluated the concentration of IL1β in the media 4 h after treatment (Fig. 3 d). While DHA caused an eightfold increase in IL1β, consistent with pyroptosis, the levels were unchanged by activation of apoptosis with cisplatin.

Cisplatin treatment was used as a positive control for apoptotic cell death. Data are represented as mean ± SD ( N = 3, * p < 0.05). c BV-2 cells were stimulated with DHA and caspase-1 inhibitor Ac-YVAD-CMK for 4 h and imaged with a × 10 objective under phase contrast. Morphology was scored from at least 50 cells per well by a blinded researcher ( N = 3). d BV-2 cells were treated with vehicle, DHA (200 µM), or cisplatin (40 µM) for 4 h, then cell supernatant was evaluated for IL1β concentration by ELISA. Data are represented as mean ± SD ( N = 3, ** p < 0.01 compared to vehicle, ## p < 0.01 compared to DHA)
DHA Treatment Induces the Upregulations of Inflammatory Cytokines and PUFA-Metabolizing Genes
Caspase-1 and gasdermin are key effectors of pyroptosis, and since this is a proinflammatory form of cell death, it is characterized by the production of cytokines. Therefore, we evaluated BV-2 cells by qRT-PCR to determine whether 200 µM DHA treatment causes transcriptional upregulation of genes encoding relevant pyroptosis mediators (Fig. 4 ). Indeed, Casp1, Gsdmd, Il1b, Il6, Tnf , and Ifng were all significantly elevated with DHA stimulation, consistent with activation of pyroptosis. Furthermore, in order to gain insight into the formation of potentially relevant DHA metabolites, we evaluated whether the expression of major PUFA-metabolizing enzymes was altered. We found that DHA treatment significantly increased transcription of all lipoxygenase isoforms, with the highest fold change observed in those of Alox5 (5-LOX) and Alox12e (12-LOX) relative to vehicle-treated controls. However, Alox15 (15-LOX) and Ptgs2 (COX-2) were also significantly increased.

DHA Metabolism by 12-LOX Is Essential for the Induction of Pyroptosis
To determine whether metabolism of DHA was required for its pyroptosis-mediating effect, BV-2 cells were pretreated with the pan-lipoxygenase inhibitor, ETI (Barlow and White ), prior to DHA stimulation. Pretreatment with 20 µM ETI resulted in significant attenuation of DHA-mediated caspase-1 activation (Fig. 5 a), and prevented membrane swelling (Fig. 5 b).

Representative images are shown in b . c , d BV-2 cells were pretreated with vehicle, Ac-YVAD-CMK (caspase-1 inhibitor), MK886 (5-LOX inhibitor), baicalein (12-LOX inhibitor), or PD146176 (15-LOX inhibitor), for 30 min before treatment with DHA or cisplatin, and then evaluated for caspase-1 ( c ) or caspase-3/7 ( d ) activity ( N = 3, ** p < 0.01 relative to vehicle, *** p < 0.001 relative to vehicle, ## p < 0.01 relative to DHA, ### p < 0.001 relative to DHA). e BV-2 cells were stimulated with DHA and baicalein for 4 h and imaged with a × 10 objective under phase contrast. Morphology was scored from at least 50 cells per well by a blinded researcher ( N = 3). f BV-2 cells were treated with vehicle, DHA (200 µM), or baicalein (20 µM) + DHA (200 µM) for 4 h, and then cell supernatant was evaluated for IL1β concentration by ELISA. Data are represented as mean ± SD ( N = 3, ** p < 0.01 compared to vehicle, # p < 0.05 compared to DHA)
To identify whether one or more specific lipoxygenase enzymes are required and evaluate their potential quantitative contributions, BV-2 cells were pretreated with selective inhibitors of 5-LOX (MK886), 12-LOX (baicalein), and 15-LOX (PD146176) prior to DHA stimulation, and then evaluated for caspase-1 and caspase-3/7 activities (Fig. 5 c, d). Complete attenuation of caspase-1 activity (not statistically different from vehicle-treated cells) was achieved only through inhibition of 12-LOX. Inhibition of 15-LOX provided partial attenuation, while inhibition of 5-LOX had no effect. 12-LOX inhibition also had a similar effect on DHA-mediated caspase-3/7 activity, raising the possibility that DHA metabolites directly contribute to apoptosis. However, selective inhibition of caspase 1 with Ac-YVAD-CMK abolished caspase-3/7 activity as well, consistent with previous reports that apoptosis can occur as a downstream consequence of pyroptosis (Sagulenko et al. ; Tatsuta et al. ; Aiba-Masago et al. ). Notably, induction of apoptosis with cisplatin did not result in the activation of caspase-1, confirming the specificity of this approach. To confirm the role of 12-LOX in the previously observed phenotype, cells were treated with DHA and baicalein, and then evaluated for morphology (Fig. 5 e). Baicalein treatment almost completely prevented the development of pyroptotic morphology and increased overall cell survival, although there was an increase in apoptotic cells. Furthermore, baicalein treatment also prevented the DHA-mediated release of IL1β (Fig. 5 f).
Discussion
Sterile inflammation is likely to play a role in the pathophysiology of multiple diseases of the CNS, including pain (Poh et al. ), stroke (Fann et al. ), and dementia (Feldman et al. ). Although the molecular pathways involved in sterile inflammation are becoming increasingly well-characterized (Kim et al. ), the proximal causes of pyroptosis are unclear. Therefore, a better understanding of the events that regulate these inflammatory processes will lead to improved therapies. Our data show, for the first time, that a product of DHA metabolism can induce the specific, rapid activation of canonical caspase-1-mediated pyroptosis. It is likely that the DHA-mediated increase in caspase-3/7 activation (Fig. 3 b) is the result of caspase-1-mediated cleavage of caspase-7 (Lamkanfi et al. ), rather than the direct activation of apoptotic pathways. This is supported by the observation that inhibition of caspase-1 can abolish DHA-mediated caspase-3/7 activity (Fig. 5 d).
It is particularly notable that the ability of DHA to induce pyroptosis depends on the activity of 12-LOX. This indicates that DHA itself is anti-inflammatory (Fig. 1 ), but it can be converted to a proinflammatory metabolite. It is likely that this process is limited in normal, noninflammatory states by low physiological levels of 12-LOX activity. This is consistent with our previous studies which show that Alox12e is expressed at markedly lower levels in the brain relative to Alox5 and Alox15 (Shalini et al. ), where the expression of Alox15 increases in differentiating neurons (Ho et al. ) and results in the generation of anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects (Shalini et al. ). Therefore, it is likely that inflammatory conditions which are known to induce phospholipase A2 activity (Farooqui et al. ) resulting in the production of DHA, also drive the expression of Alox12e , thus resulting in the accumulation of proinflammatory PUFAs. Moreover, we show that Alox12e expression is increased following DHA treatment, suggesting that a positive-feedback mechanism is activated in which activation of caspase-1 leads to increased 12-LOX activity which further drives pyroptosis.
The current study has identified several critical components of this programed cell death pathway, including DHA, 12-LOX, caspase-1, IL1β, and a pore-forming complex, presumably Gsdmd (Fig. 6 ). However, there are a few key components that remain to be identified, specifically, the identity of the active metabolite(s) of DHA and the mechanism of its activity. DHA is converted by the action of lipoxygenases into a complex family of “specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs).” These include resolvins, protectins, and maresins, among other known bioactive lipids (Calder ; Shinohara et al. ). Some of these mediators are known to activate cognate G protein-coupled receptors (Duvall and Levy ), which thus represent a potentially novel class of PRRs. However, it is also possible that specific SPMs activate canonical PRRs, such as Toll-like receptors or NOD-like receptors (Bergsbaken et al. ), with an as-yet-uncharacterized ligand–receptor interaction.
Fig. 6 Schematic summarizing the data presented in this manuscript
Interestingly, while this manuscript was under preparation, Pizato et al. reported that similar concentrations of DHA can also induce a number of pyroptosis characteristics in triple-negative breast cancer cell lines (BCCs), such as activation of caspase-1 and membrane permeabilization (Pizato et al. ). While it is likely that our results share overlapping mechanisms, there are some notable differences: (1) The DHA-mediated loss of viability was less potent in the BCCs, with only a 50% reduction in viability at 200 µM. (2) There was no apparent cell swelling in the BCCs. (3) Activations of caspase-1 and IL1β in BCCs were detectable 18 h after DHA treatment, a time point by which BV-2 cells have completely lysed. These differences are likely due to profound differences in the phenotypes of these cells. As immune cells, microglia may be primed for inflammasome activation, and thus more sensitive to caspase-1 activity. Furthermore, while Pizato et al. did not evaluate the role of DHA metabolism, it is possible that the observed effect of DHA is also indirect in their system.
In summary, we discovered a novel immunomodulatory mechanism by which DHA can induce pyroptotic cell death in microglia. This effect is not mediated directly by DHA, but rather, requires its metabolism by 12-LOX. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a proinflammatory process mediated by DHA in microglial cells and identifies 12-LOX as a potentially valuable target for the attenuation of neuroinflammation.
