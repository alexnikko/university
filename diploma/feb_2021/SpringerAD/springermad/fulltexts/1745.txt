Introduction
Gait ataxia is a key characteristic of cerebellar disorders and is described as an unstable stumbling walk, with the need for an increased base of support [ , ]. Gait impairment greatly impacts a person’s autonomy and daily life activities and significantly increases the risk of falls [ , ]. Recently, modern motion analysis systems have been used to quantitatively characterize the nature and degree of walking dysfunction in patients affected by cerebellar ataxias. Several abnormalities in spatio-temporal parameters, joint kinematics and kinetics, muscle activation patterns, and upper body control together with increased variability in global and segmental gait parameters have been observed [ , , , , , ].
Almost all the previous studies on ataxic patients were transversal studies, and therefore little information is available on the progression of gait impairment in these patients. It is well-known that patients with degenerative cerebellar ataxias, e.g., spinocerebellar ataxias, show a progressive course [ , ]. Consequently, the patient’s walking ability is expected to gradually decline over time. As walking is an essential function in everyday life, the longitudinal assessment of gait is critical to measure the actual progression of gait impairment, to determine if differences in the progression of gait impairment exist for different ataxic disorders and to identify which gait parameters are more sensitive to gait decline.
The purposes of this study were therefore (i) to assess the extent and progression of gait impairment at the 2- and 4-year follow-up evaluations in a group of patients with degenerative cerebellar ataxias, (ii) to compare the obtained data with disease severity, and (iii) to compare gait decline among subgroups of patients with different clinical forms of cerebellar ataxia.
Material and Methods
Patients
We carried out a prospective longitudinal gait analysis study with patients with degenerative cerebellar ataxias; recordings were done in our Motion Analysis LAB (Policlinico Italia, Rome, Italy) from September 2011 to December 2015. Although 30 patients underwent the initial gait analysis, we only included those patients who were evaluated at the 2- and 4-year follow-up evaluations. A total of 18 patients were excluded for the following reasons: (i) the patient failed to complete one or both of the follow-up evaluations (8 patients), (ii) the patient was non-ambulant without assistance (8 patients), and (iii) a re-diagnosis of cerebellar-type multiple system atrophy was made (2 patients).
Of the 12 patients included in the study, 6 had autosomal dominant ataxia (spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA); 3 patients with SCA1 and 3 patients with SCA2), while the other 6 had sporadic adult-onset ataxia (SAOA). Because patients with SCA may show signs other than cerebellar ones, we only included patients who exhibited gait disturbances that were exclusively cerebellar in nature at the initial evaluation. Accordingly, we excluded patients who exhibited major involvement of neurological systems other than the cerebellum (e.g., extrapyramidal, pyramidal, peripheral nerve, or muscle) and/or orthopedic disorders likely to cause further gait impairment, such as severe scoliosis, painful musculoskeletal conditions, and foot deformities. No patient had visual impairments (e.g., optic atrophy or retinitis pigmentosa), but almost all had oculomotor abnormalities, such as gaze nystagmus or square-wave jerks, during pursuit movements. All patients could walk without assistance or walking aids along the 10-m lab walkway, even though some of them used assistive gait devices at home. All the patients enrolled in our study were undergoing physical therapy, which included upper and lower limb exercises and balance and gait training.
Twelve age- and sex-matched healthy adults (10 males and 2 females; mean age, 46.6 ± 6.6 years) were used as controls. The two groups had similar heights (ataxic patients, 167.6 ± 8.0 cm; controls, 171.1 ± 9.1 cm; p > 0.05) and body masses (ataxic patients, 70.5 ± 13.3 kg; controls, 77.5 ± 13.7 kg; p > 0.05). The study complied with the Helsinki Declaration and received local ethics committee approval. All the participants provided informed consent prior to taking part in the study.
Clinical Evaluation
Clinical and demographic characteristics are shown in Table 1 . At each evaluation (baseline and follow-ups), patients were asked whether they use a walking device to carry out daily life activities and were categorized in two groups depending on their response: independents (no use of devices for daily ambulation) and dependents (partial or total use of devices for daily ambulation).

The scale for the assessment and rating of ataxia (SARA) was used to rate disease severity [ ].
Gait Analysis
Gait analysis was performed with the use of an optoelectronic motion analysis system (SMART-DX 500 System, BTS, Milan, Italy). The system consists of eight infra-red cameras (sample frequency, 340 Hz) that detect the movement of 22 passive spherical markers (diameter, 15 mm) coated with aluminum powder, a reflective material, that are placed over prominent bony landmarks, according to Davis’s protocol [ ]. Two dynamometric platforms (Kistler, Winterthur, Switzerland) were embedded in the floor (sampling rate, 1200 Hz) and were used to measure ground reaction forces.
A calibration procedure was executed before the first data capture was performed. Spatial accuracy was 0.2 mm in the x, y, and z dimensions. A global reference system was adopted in accordance with the International Society of Biomechanics [ , ]. Before the formal measurements were taken, anthropometric measurements were obtained for each subject according to Winter’s method [ ], and both the ataxic patients and healthy controls underwent an initial training session to familiarize themselves with the procedure.
For the patients, 6 trials were carried out, wherein the patient was required to walk barefoot at a self-selected speed along a walkway that was approximately 10 m in length. Assuming that the walking speed of the patients would be slower than that of the controls, the controls were asked to walk barefoot, both at a self-selected speed and at a slow but comfortable speed (30–50% slower than the self-selected speed). At least 15 trials were recorded for each control subject (10 trials at the self-selected speed and 5 trials at the instructed slower speed). This would allow the comparison of general gait characteristics between the groups, without any potential bias due to speed differences [ ]. To ensure that gait parameters were collected during steady-state walking for both the ataxic patients and healthy controls, the first and last 2 steps of each trial corresponding to the acceleration and deceleration phase, respectively, were excluded from the analysis. To avoid fatigue, trials were conducted in sets of 3, separated by a 1-min rest.
The starting position was adjusted so as to ensure that the right foot always landed on at least one of the two force platforms embedded in the middle of the walkway.
Speed Matching Procedure
The walking speed of the patients and controls was matched as follows: we selected control group trials in which the gait velocity was within the mean gait speed ± SD range of the ataxic patients. We thus selected 4 control trials at the self-selected speed and 8 trials at the slow speed.
Data Analysis
Three-dimensional marker trajectories were acquired by using a frame-by-frame tracking system (SMART Tracker, BTS, Milan, Italy). Data were processed using the three-dimensional reconstruction software (SMART Analyzer, BTS, Milan, Italy) and MATLAB software (MATLAB 7.4.0, MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). Kinematic data between two consecutive heel strikes of the same limb were time-normalized to 101 data points per stride, i.e., 0–100% of the gait cycle, by applying a polynomial procedure, in order to exclude the influence of different stride durations [ ]. Approximately 24 steps were collected for each subject at each session, in accordance with the recommendations for gait variability studies [ ].
Time–Distance Parameters
The following temporal parameters were measured: stance (distance from the first heel strike to toe-off of the same limb), swing (distance from toe-off to the second heel strike of the same limb), and double-support phase duration within the stride (time spent with both feet on the floor). All of these parameters are expressed as a percentage of the stride duration, and the stride duration totaling 100% was defined as the gait cycle. The spatial parameters computed were stride and step length (m) and step width (m). In addition, gait cycle speed (m/s) and cadence (step/min) were calculated.
Trunk and Joint Kinematic Parameters
Kinematic assessment was carried out based on the range of motion (RoM), i.e., the difference between the maximum and minimum angles of the hip, knee, ankle, and trunk.
The flexion–extension RoM of the right and left hips, knees, and ankles and that of the trunk were computed in the sagittal plane; the trunk RoM was also calculated in the frontal and transverse planes.
Gait Variability Parameters
For each subject, the stride duration, stride and step length, step width, and trunk RoM in the three anatomical planes during each stride of each trial and session were measured. For each parameter, the mean (denoted as mean in the following formula) and the standard deviation (denoted as SD in the following formula) were computed for each subject and session.
Using these two values of mean and standard deviation, the coefficient of variation (CV) was determined to evaluate within-subject variability by using the following formula: \( CV=\frac{100\cdot SD}{\mathrm{mean}} \) . The coefficient of variations was calculated for the left and right sides separately as recommended by Lord et al. [ ], to avoid confounding subtle spatio-temporal asymmetries.
The variability of the flexion–extension of the right and left hips, knees, and ankles was calculated according to a previously reported method [ , , ]. $$ {CV}_{\mathrm{joint}}={\left\langle SD(i)\right\rangle}_i,\kern0.5em i\upepsilon \left\{0-100\%\mathrm{gait}\ \mathrm{cycle}\right\} $$ where SD( i ) is the standard deviation of a measure at i th % gait cycle, and 〈〉 i indicates the average overall i .
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS (v.20, IBM). We expressed the gait variables of the patients as a percentage of the mean values recorded in the control group. The Shapiro–Wilk test for normal distribution was initially carried out. Two-way repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate the effect of time (three-level within-subject factor) and group (SCA, SAOA) (two-level between-subject factor) on the gait variables and SARA scores after applying the Greenhouse–Geisser correction, when deemed necessary, to circumvent violations of sphericity (i.e., inequalities in the variance of the differences between factors). The Bonferroni correction for multiple testing was applied for pairwise comparisons in order to deal with the familywise error rate [ ].
Fisher’s test was used to detect any significant differences in frequency distribution (number of patients grouped as either independents or dependents) at each time evaluation (2 × 2 contingency table) [ , ].
To determine whether the SARA score could be related to future walking ability, we calculated either the Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficients between the SARA scores at the baseline and gait parameters at the 4-year follow-up. We selected only those gait parameters that changed significantly at the 4-year follow-up.
Descriptive statistics regarding both gait variables and SARA scores were reported as mean ± standard deviation. p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Results
Clinical Findings
Time was found to have a significant effect on the SARA scores (Table 2 ). Post hoc analysis revealed significantly higher values at 2 and 4 years than at the baseline (Fig. 1 ). In particular, the SARA total score increased by 3.65 ± 1.92 points at the 2-year and 5.29 ± 3.23 points at the 4-year follow-up as compared to the baseline.

Time was found to have a significant effect on step length; hip, knee, ankle joint, and trunk rotation RoM; and on the stride-to-stride duration and step length CV values (Table 2 ). Post hoc analysis revealed significantly lower step length and hip joint RoM values at the 4-year follow-up than at the baseline and 2-year follow-up, lower knee joint RoM values at the 4-year follow-up than at the 2-year follow-up, and lesser ankle joint RoM at the 4-year follow-up than at the baseline (Table 2 , Fig. 1 ). Figure 3 shows hip, knee, and ankle joint angles at the baseline, 2-year follow-up, and 4-year follow-up in a representative patient.

Discussion
In the present study, we evaluated gait decline over a period of 4 years in a group of patients affected by primary degenerative cerebellar ataxias (SCA and SAOA).
Only one previous study evaluated the gait performance of 9 patients with cerebellar degeneration and 7 patients with focal lesions over a short time period (12 months) [ ], but the study did not reveal significant changes. In contrast, our study evaluated changes in gait variables over a relatively long period, allowing complete evaluation of gait function decline during disease progression.
The main changes observed were decreased step length and hip, knee, and ankle joint RoM and increased trunk rotation RoM and stride-to-stride and step length variability. Almost all these gait abnormalities were revealed at the 4-year follow-up.
It has been suggested that reduced step length is, at least in part, a biomechanical consequence of enlarged step width [ ]. However, we found that although the step length was reduced at the 4-year follow-up, the step width remained unchanged. It is likely that ataxic patients increasingly shorten their step length as the disease progresses as a balance-related mechanism aimed at reducing duration in the most unstable configuration (single support) and in an attempt to maintain an effective gait. The latter mechanism appears to be achieved by maintaining an increased cadence, the value of which at the baseline was approximately 110–114% of that of the healthy controls (Table 2 ). This mechanism may contribute to maintaining an effective gait speed over the years. It has been shown that maintaining an adequate gait speed may be an advantageous mechanism that improves dynamic stability by reducing gait variability [ ]. Indeed, it has been shown in ataxic patients that a slower gait speed is associated with larger gait variability, which, in turn, is linked to a higher risk of falls [ , , , , ]. Thus, for ataxic patients, maintaining an effective gait speed during steady-state linear walking may represent a sort of stabilizing mechanism, similar to that adopted to maintain bicycle stability during cycling [ , ]. Because both gait speed and gait variability did not change significantly at the 2-year follow-up, this compensatory mechanism appears to be effective only for a limited time period. Interestingly, the increase in trunk rotation may represent another compensatory mechanism aimed at maintaining an adequate gait speed. Higher trunk RoM values have been found to be associated with higher gait speed, step length, and cadence values in both healthy subjects and ataxic patients [ ], suggesting a relationship between trunk rotation movements and gait performance. It is known that axial rotation, i.e., controlling the vertical oscillation of the center of mass, is an important mechanism in creating a more energy-efficient gait pattern [ ]. Moreover, axial rotation provides the driving force for locomotion through the coupling action of the trunk and pelvis, which appears to behave as a resonating pendulum [ ]. Furthermore, the counter rotation between the pelvis, trunk, and shoulders is necessary to reduce the overall momentum at higher walking speeds, i.e., the higher the gait speed, the larger are the counter rotation trunk movements [ ]. In our study, trunk rotation was the only gait parameter that changed significantly at both the 2- and 4-year follow-up evaluations, and this finding further reinforces the notion that it plays a compensatory role in maintaining an effective gait.
Surprisingly, we did not find a further widening of the base of support at both the 2- and 4-year follow-up evaluations. A widened base of support is the most characteristic feature observed in patients with ataxia [ ] and reflects the adoption of compensatory mechanisms aimed at maintaining the dynamic balance on the frontal plane by increasing the safety margin between the center of gravity and the edge of the feet [ ]. The lack of a significant difference in the step width values indicates that patients adopt this balance-related mechanism both at the early stages and at its maximum value. Further increases in step width may be not efficient in terms of gait speed maintenance and energy consumption.
Reduced lower limb joint RoM has been reported by several authors, even though some results are contradictory [ , , , , ]. However, since patients walk slower than do healthy subjects, gait speed may be a confounding factor. When matching the gait speed, the main differences observed are with regard to the ankle joint, with no differences being noted for the hip and knee joints [ , ]. Herein, we observed a further reduction in the ankle joint excursion, from 73% of that of the healthy controls at the baseline to 63% at the 4-year follow-up. Furthermore, we found a reduction in the hip and knee joint excursions from 104 and 98% of those of the healthy controls at the baseline to 96 and 93% at the 4-year follow-up, respectively. Although the reduced joint RoM may be related to the reduced step length, it could also indicate a functional attempt by ataxic patients to stiffen their lower limbs to increase dynamic stability, with the ankle joint playing a major role [ ]. In particular, an increase in the co-activation index of the antagonist muscles [ ] and an increase in the amplitude and duration of electromyography bursts of all individual muscles have been observed [ ]. These findings indicate an attempt to stiffen the limb to compensate for the instability due to poor muscle coordination, even at the expense of efficient joint movements.
In the present study, we observed a progressive increase in the gait variability of stride-to-stride and step length parameters. Gait variability is related to locomotion stability [ ] and is strongly associated with an increased risk of falls in patients with cerebellar ataxias [ , , ]. The progressive increase in gait variability observed at the 4-year follow-up may directly reflect gait function deterioration, leading to greater instability and an increased risk of falls. Taking this into consideration, gait variability may serve as a “warning sign” of the future loss of walking autonomy; the increase in the number of dependent patients at the 4-year follow-up corroborates this. However, further studies are needed to clarify whether gait variability can be a predictor of the loss of walking autonomy.
We observed an increase in the SARA score from 3.65 at the 2-year follow-up to 5.29 at the 4-year follow-up, with no differences between the SCA and SAOA patients. Our results are in line with those reported by a previous study with a larger series of patients, which reported an annual increase in the SARA score of 2.18 and 1.40 for SCA 1 and 2 patients, respectively [ ]. This functional decline reflects the progressive nature of degenerative cerebellar ataxias over time. However, while the SARA scores reduced at both the 2- and 4-year follow-up evaluations, changes in almost all the gait parameters were noted only at the 4-year follow-up. This finding confirms that patients try to maintain an effective gait despite disease progression.
Over the course of this 4-year study, all patients underwent in- and out-patient rehabilitation programs, including physiotherapy and adapted physical activity interventions. Because we did not study a control group of untreated patients, we cannot exclude the major role played by gait rehabilitation in preserving gait function at the 2-year follow-up and in improving the patients’ ability to compensate for gait instability.
The only difference we found between the SCA and SAOA patients was a lower ankle joint RoM in SCA patients. This difference may simply indicate that SCA patients make a considerable effort to adopt the ankle strategy to maintain dynamic balance.
Finally, we did not find significant correlations between the total SARA scores and the gait parameters recorded at the 4-year follow-up, suggesting that the SARA scale at the baseline is not predictive of changes in gait performance 4 years later.
The small sample size of patients was a limitation of the current study, particularly for the subgroup comparisons, resulting in limited statistical power. However, it should be kept in mind that degenerative ataxias are rare genetic conditions, and large sample sizes are difficult to gather and to follow up in the long term. The limitation of the small sample size was partly offset by the adoption of sensitive quantitative measures of motion.
Studies with larger sample sizes are needed to validate our results and to determine if results vary for different forms of degenerative ataxias.
