Introduction
Acetaminophen ( N -acetyl-p-aminophenol, APAP) is an analgesic and antipyretic drug that is widely available and is used in both prescription and over-the-counter products [ , ]. APAP is considered a safe and effective medicine when used as directed. APAP intoxication is one of the most common drug intoxications worldwide and represents a serious public health problem [ , , ]. In the USA, APAP is the leading cause of liver failure due to poisoning and is the second leading cause of substance-related fatalities [ ]. Studies have reported that APAP poisoning accounts for approximately one-half of acute hepatic failure cases [ , ].
Acute hepatic injury is the most common complication following APAP poisoning. Centrilobular hepatic necrosis is the major pathological finding of APAP-related liver injury and was first reported by Davidson and Eastham in 1966 [ ]. The metabolism of APAP by cytochrome P450 generates excessive amounts of the metabolite N -acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI) and depletes glutathione, which results in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that, in turn, cause liver injury [ , , , , ]. Although APAP-related organ injury has been widely studied, most studies have focused on acute liver toxicity [ , , , ].
Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), superoxide anion (O 2 − ), hydroxyl radical (OH − ), and peroxynitrite (ONOO − ) are the most prominent ROS which are toxic to the human body [ ]. The imbalance between production of ROS and antioxidants causes oxidative stress and damages the endothelium [ ]. Excess production of ROS can result in inflammation, disturbed blood flow, abnormal shear stress, and arterial wall remodeling [ ]. Excessive ROS levels may play a vital role in the development of arteriosclerosis and progression to cardiovascular diseases [ , ]. Sudano et al. [ ] reported an increased blood pressure in patients with CAD exposed to APAP at recommended dose. However, few studies have investigated the relationship between APAP poisoning and coronary artery disease (CAD). Therefore, we conducted a nationwide cohort study to investigate the incidence and risk of CAD in patients with APAP poisoning.
Methods
Data Source
The National Health Insurance (NHI) program in Taiwan is mandatory. The NHI is a universal health insurance system and was implemented in March 1995 by the NHI Administration (NHIA) of the Ministry of Health and Welfare. The NHI program covers nearly 100% of the residents of Taiwan, with 23.75 million beneficiaries [ ]. To assist researchers in performing studies on issues that are relevant to the NHI program, the National Health Research Institute (NHRI) created and managed the NHI Research Database (NHIRD), which deidentifies the beneficiaries before publicly releasing their data for research. In the current cohort study, we extracted data from the NHIRD, which includes the Registry for Beneficiaries, and inpatients’ claims records. The Institutional Review Board of China Medical University in central Taiwan approved this study (CMU-REC-101-012). Informed consent was waived because the identification numbers in the data were encrypted. The diagnoses and procedures were coded according to the International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), 2001 edition.
Sampled Participants
From the inpatient claims of the NHIRD, we identified patients with APAP poisoning (ICD-9-CM 965.4) aged 20 years and older, who received first-time admission diagnosis with APAP poisoning between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2010. The first-time admission date served as the index date. We randomly selected non-APAP comparison patients from the NHI beneficiaries at ratio of 4:1 and frequency-matched them with the patients with APAP poisoning according to age group (every 5 years), sex, and index year of APAP poisoning. We excluded patients diagnosed with CAD (ICD-9-CM code 410–414) before the index date, and those younger than 20 years or whose demographic information was absent in the NHIRD.
Outcome and Comorbidities
Both APAP- and non-APAP poisoning cohorts were followed up until a diagnosis of CAD, loss to follow-up, termination of insurance, or until December 31, 2011. The baseline comorbidities included diabetes (ICD-9-CM code 250), hypertension (ICD-9-CM codes 401–405), hyperlipidemia (ICD-9-CM code 272), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; ICD-9-CM codes 490–492, 494, and 496).
Definition of Outcome Variables
The outcome variables as CAD included stable angina (ICD-9-CM 413) and acute coronary syndrome (ACS, ICD-9-CM codes 410, 411.1, and 411.8). The physicians make a diagnosis of stable angina by history taking, electrocardiogram, and exercise stress test. Otherwise, the physicians make a diagnosis of ACS by clinical symptoms, electrocardiogram, cardiac biomarkers of necrosis, cardiac ultrasound, and cardiac catheterization.
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to explore demographic characteristics and comorbidities. The differences between the APAP poisoning and non-APAP poisoning cohorts were examined using the Chi-square test and two-sample Student’s t test for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. The cumulative incidence of CAD was estimated in both cohorts by using Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, and the difference in two curves was tested using the log-rank test. The overall incidence and incidence density rates (per 1000 person-years) specific to sex, age, comorbidity, and follow-up period were calculated for each cohort. The APAP-to-non-APAP poisoning cohort hazard ratios (HRs) for CAD and the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each variable were calculated by using univariable and multivariable Cox’s proportion hazard regression models. The multivariable models were adjusted for age; sex; and comorbidities of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and COPD. We performed all data analyses using SAS statistical software (version 9.4 for Windows; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). A two-tailed p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Demographic Characteristics and Comorbidity of the Participants
In this study, 2723 patients with APAP poisoning and 10,892 non-APAP poisoning patients were included. Most patients (75.1%) were aged ≤ 34 years, and 75.3% were females. A higher prevalence of comorbidities, namely diabetes (1.84 vs 0.61%), hypertension (2.86 vs 0.69%), and hyperlipidemia (1.25 vs 0.28%), and COPD (0.70 vs 0.28%), was observed in patients with APAP poisoning than in the non-APAP poisoning patients (Table 1 ).

Comparison of Incidence and HRs of CAD Stratified by Sex, Age, Comorbidity Between Patients With and Without APAP Poisoning
A total of 18,305 person-years and 72,750 person-years were followed up in the APAP poisoning and non-APAP poisoning cohorts. The overall incidence rate of CAD was 1.53 per 1000 person-years in patients with APAP poisoning and 0.87 per 1000 person-years in non-APAP poisoning patients. The crude HR of CAD was 1.77 (95% CI 1.14–2.77) in patients with APAP poisoning compared with that in non-APAP patients. After adjustments for age, sex, and comorbidities, the adjusted HR (aHR) was 1.85 (95% CI 1.16–2.94). Regardless of APAP poisoning, male patients exhibited a significantly higher incidence of CAD than female patients did. After adjustment for covariates, the aHR was 1.95 (95% CI 1.27–2.99, p < 0.01) in male compared with female patients. The aHR was higher in patients older than 50 years (aHR 18.2, 95% CI 11.5–28.90) and patients with comorbidities (aHR 3.77, 95% CI 2.20–6.45) (Table 2 ).

HRs of CAD Stratified by Sex, Age, APAP Poisoning, Diabetes, Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia, and COPD
Table 3 indicates a 1.85-fold higher risk of CAD in patients with APAP poisoning than in non-APAP poisoning patients after adjustment for sex, age, and diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and COPD (95% CI 1.16–2.94). For every 1 year of age increase, a 9% increase in the risk of CAD was observed. Male sex and hypertension were independently associated with increased risk of CAD (aHR 1.95, 95% CI 1.27–2.99 for male sex; aHR 2.21, 95% CI 1.09–4.49 for hypertension).

Discussion
For 2723 patients with APAP poisoning and 10,892 non-APAP poisoning patients without APAP poisoning, we found that the patients with APAP poisoning have a higher risk of CAD than do those without APAP poisoning. The overall incidence of CAD was higher in the patients with APAP poisoning than in the non-APAP poisoning patients (1.53 vs 0.87 per 1000 person-years). The APAP poisoning cohort had a higher prevalence of comorbidities, such as diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and COPD, than did the non-APAP poisoning cohort. After adjustment for covariates, the APAP poisoning cohort exhibited a 1.85-fold increased risk of CAD compared with non-APAP poisoning cohort. The incidence rate of CAD in this study was lower than the previously reported rate because most participants in the current study were young adults [ , ]. The present study is the first to identify an increased risk of CAD in patients with APAP poisoning independent of sex, age, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and COPD.
Although the biological mechanism of APAP poisoning in the development of CAD remains unclear, the association of APAP poisoning and CAD may be attributable to excess oxidative stress [ ]. Excessive NAPQI generation by cytochrome p450 after APAP poisoning causes the formation of mitochondrial protein adducts, which cause oxidative stress [ , ]. Excessive ROS production and oxidative stress contribute to endothelial dysfunction and vascular remodeling through smooth muscle proliferation [ , ]. Inflammation is associated with hypercoagulability, which leads to the development of atherothrombosis [ , ].
Figure 1 shows that APAP poisoning considerably increases the risk of CAD after 1 year of APAP poisoning. This result supports the view that APAP poisoning is responsible for endothelial dysfunction, an early marker of atherosclerosis which contributes to further pathogenesis of CAD [ , ]. The endothelium regulates vascular homeostasis, including vasodilation and vasoconstriction, inhibition and stimulation of smooth muscle cell proliferation, and thrombogenesis and fibrinolysis [ ]. Endothelial dysfunction may precede evidence of atherosclerotic plaque and progressively lead to CAD [ ].
Most patients with APAP poisoning were aged ≤ 49 years. This finding is consistent with that of a previous study [ ]. Although the incidence of CAD was higher in patients with APAP poisoning than in those without APAP poisoning, irrespective of age, the incidence of CAD was substantially higher in patients aged ≥ 50 years than that in people ≤ 49 years. This finding reminds clinicians to consider the risk of CAD in patients with APAP poisoning.
Our analysis has some limitations. First, the dosage of APAP and severity of APAP poisoning were not available in the NHIRD. We could not analyze the effect of APAP on CAD in a dose-dependent manner. Second, we did not analyze the risk of CAD in patients younger than 20 years because the incidence of CAD in these patients is limited. Third, we did not determine whether acetylcysteine treatment reduced the risk of CAD because all enrolled patients with APAP poisoning were treated with acetylcysteine. Finally, the detailed information of familial history of CAD, smoking, and body mass index (BMI) was not available in the NHIRD, which may influence the effect of APAP poisoning on the risk of CAD. However, obesity is a well-established risk factor for diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia [ , , ]. Smoking is the most crucial causative factor of COPD [ ]. Although data regarding smoking habit and BMI were not available in the NHIRD, we controlled for diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and COPD in the multivariable Cox models to minimize the effect of smoking and obesity.
The strength of the current study is that it is the first to investigate the incidence and risk of CAD in patients with APAP poisoning in an Asian population. The current study provides a nationwide cohort study, which is generalizable.
Conclusions
Patients with APAP poisoning are at a higher risk of CAD than are patients without APAP poisoning. APAP poisoning may increase risk of CAD development. Future prospective studies need to confirm the observational finding.
