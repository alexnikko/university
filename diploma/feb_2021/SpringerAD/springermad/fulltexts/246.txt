Introduction
The diagnosis of venous thromboembolism is difficult in the postoperative setting because signs such as hypoxemia, leg pain, and swelling are so common [ ]. Symptoms of pulmonary embolism (PE) can vary widely from patient to patient—some may be asymptomatic, while others exhibit dyspnea or cardiac arrest [ ]. Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is the most widely used diagnostic technique for PE due to its minimal invasiveness, wide availability, and high sensitivity [ , ]. However, CTPA is often overused for these very reasons. Moreover, this technology is expensive and not without risk of contrast-induced nephropathy and radiation exposure [ , ]. The frequency of diagnosed PE can also depend on the threshold for ordering imaging. In one study, PE was found in 11/27 total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients that underwent planned CTPA 24–36 h after surgery, but only 1 was diagnosed clinically with PE [ ]. Thus, the more CTPA scans are performed, the more PEs will be detected. CTPA can also detect subsegmental PE (SSPE), of which the clinical significance has been widely debated [ ]. Some estimate that 25% of CTPAs to rule out PE could safely be avoided [ ].
Clinical decision rules (CDR), such as the Wells and PISA 2, have been developed to identify patients at low risk for PE who could forgo imaging (Table 1 ) [ , ]. The Wells rule has been studied extensively in emergency department patients, and in conjunction with D-dimer testing can be used to rule out PE non-invasively [ , ].There are few studies of the Wells rule in postoperative populations [ , , ]. In one study, performed in 66 spine surgery patients, the Wells rule had 79% sensitivity for PE [ ], whereas a study of 169 trauma patients demonstrated sensitivity of only 33% [ ]. PISA 2 appears to perform better, even in surgical patients, but it has never been validated [ ].

This study was performed to (1) compare the performance of the Wells and PISA 2 CDR in orthopedic patients; (2) compare CDR scores in patients with subsegmental PE (SSPE) versus larger clots; and (3) identify variables that improve the performance of the Wells rule in orthopedic patients.
Methods
This retrospective study was performed at a high-volume orthopedic hospital with institutional review board approval. Standard deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis for patients at this institution includes administration of aspirin, warfarin, or low molecular weight heparin. Intermittent pneumatic compression and early mobilization are universally used. Two investigators (SD, SG) abstracted data onto a standardized data collection form which was verified by a senior investigator (LR). We included all patients that underwent CTPA following orthopedic surgery at our institution from January 1st, 2013 to December 31st, 2014. We excluded patients who lacked data required to calculate the Wells and PISA 2 scores. Required variables are shown in Table 1 .
For the Wells rule, “clinical signs and symptoms of DVT” were considered present if there was documentation of asymmetrical or symmetrical thigh or calf swelling, leg tenderness to palpation, and/or unilateral lower limb pain. PE was considered “the most likely diagnosis” if (1) chart notes indicated that PE was most likely (2) patients had any of the following without an alternative diagnosis (i) hypoxia and/or shortness of breath with clear lungs, (ii) new-onset atrial fibrillation with hypoxia and/or shortness of breath, (iii) syncope, (iv) pleuritic chest pain, or (v) tachycardia > 110 bpm [ ]. If a chest X-ray was performed and pointed to an alternative diagnosis, then PE was not considered most likely. The determination whether PE was “the most likely diagnosis” was made without knowledge of the CTPA result. We used the standard cutoff of > 4. We also explored the sensitivity and specificity at lower cutoffs.
PISA 2 cutoffs of 0.60 (10th percentile of our patient population), 0.92 (50th percentile), and 0.35 (the optimal cutoff, at which at least 99% of PE were detected) were examined.
Computed tomography pulmonary angiography
CTPA was performed using a Brilliance 16 (Philips), Brilliance 64 (Philips), or CT750HD scanner (GE Healthcare) during suspended respiration. On the Brilliance 16 and 64 scanners, a 1 mm slice thickness was utilized, with a 0.5-mm reconstruction interval. On the CT750HD scanners, a 1.25-mm slice thickness was utilized with a 0.625-mm reconstruction interval. Scans were obtained using 120 kV/variable mAs, following intravenous injection of 80–140 mL of nonionic contrast material containing 320 mg of iodine per mL with an injection speed of 4.0 mL/s. In order to obtain optimal contrast opacification of the pulmonary arterial tree, scans were obtained either at a fixed 20 s delay following initiation of the contrast injection or at a bolus triggered delay when optimal opacification was achieved within a region of interest placed over the main pulmonary artery. The pulmonary arteries were evaluated up to and including the sub-segmental vessels throughout both lungs. PE was diagnosed if contrast material outlined an intraluminal defect or if a vessel was totally occluded by low-attenuation material on at least 2 adjacent slices. Scans were read by board-certified radiologists on the hospital’s picture archiving and communications systems (PACS).
Statistics
Continuous variables were summarized as mean ± standard deviation and were compared between the PE and non-PE cohorts using t-tests. Categorical variables were summarized as frequency (percent) and compared using Fisher’s exact test. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to determine which clinical factors were associated with a positive scan, with a binary Wells cutoff > 4 forced into the model. Stepwise selection was used for additional factors, requiring 0.10 significance for model entry and 0.05 significance to remain in the final model.
Diagnostic accuracy was assessed through the calculation of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, c-statistic, overall accuracy, positive likelihood ratio, and negative likelihood ratio for Wells score > 4 and for PISA 2 ≥ 10th percentile, ≥ 50th percentile and ≥ 0.35 which was deemed to be the optimal cutpoint for PISA 2, defined by the Youden index.
Analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4. We compared the Wells score in patients with sub segmental and larger PEs. With 40 subsegmental and 41 larger PEs, we had 80% power to detect a difference of 1.1, with a standard deviation of 1.68 for subsegmental and 1.86 for larger PEs, using a two-sided, two-sample, unequal-variance t test. Two-tailed p values are reported and p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Results
During the study period, 27,683 patients were hospitalized for orthopedic surgery, 561 patients underwent CTPA to rule out PE, and 402 patients had sufficient data for both the Wells and PISA 2 scores to be calculated. Of these, 82/402 (20.4%) were found to have a PE. Demographics for patients with and without PE are shown in Table 2 . The patients were 36% male with mean age 62 years and mean BMI 29.7. Patients with PE were less likely to be former smokers (p = 0.008), more likely to have varicose veins (p < 0.001) and more likely to have PE thought to be the most likely diagnosis (p < 0.001) ( Table 2 ) .

The percent of patients with each variable in the Wells and PISA 2 rules is shown in Table 1 . Seventy-five percent of patients were tachycardic and 10.5% had signs of DVT. Hemoptysis and malignancy were rare. Fifty-three percent had a history of cardiac disease and 16% had a history of pulmonary disease. Very few patients had orthopnea, syncope, or cor pulmonale on EKG.
The mean Wells score (± standard deviation) in patients with PE was 5.3 ± 1.8 and without PE 4.6 ± 2.1 respectively (P < 0.005) while the mean PISA 2 score for patients with PE was 0.86 ± 016 and without PE was 0.85 ± 0.16 (p = 0.83) (Table 2 ). There was no difference in the mean Wells or PISA 2 scores of patients with SSPE vs. larger clots ( Table 3 ) . The performance of the Wells and PISA rules is shown in Table 4 . The Wells performed better than PISA 2 in orthopedic patients: c-statistic 0.60 (95% CI 0.54–0.65) vs. 0.50 (95% CI 0.44–0.57); p = 0.007. A Wells cutoff ≥ 1.5 had 100% sensitivity and 0% specificity while a Wells cutoff of ≥ 3 had 96% sensitivity and 13% specificity.

Adding the variables past smoking and varicose veins to the Wells rule improved its performance: c-statistic 0.60 (95% CI 0.54–0.65) vs. 0.66 (95% CI 0.59–0.73) p = 0.008.
Discussion
This is the first study to compare the performance of the Wells and PISA 2 rules in orthopedic patients, and the first to validate the PISA 2 rule in an orthopedic population. We demonstrate that the Wells rule (cutoff > 4) has sensitivity 74% and specificity 45% in orthopedic patients, and that it performs better than PISA 2 in this setting (c-statistic 0.60 vs. 0.50; p = 0.007). Neither rule distinguishes patients with SSPE from those with larger clots. Adding the variables “past smoking” and “varicose veins” to the Wells rule improved its performance (c-statistic 0.66, p = 0.008), but not to the extent that it could be used without d-dimer testing to rule out PE noninvasively. For PISA 2, using an “optimal” cutoff that detected 99% of PE, left only 3% of patients that could “rule out” for PE and forgo imaging, while for Wells, a cutoff > 1.5 identified 100% of PE patients but left no patients that could forgo imaging.
The sensitivity of the Wells rule in our orthopedic population was similar to that demonstrated in spine patients by Wang et al. [ ] but much higher than that reported in trauma patients [ ]. The performance of the Wells rule in our population was also similar to that described in surgical patients by Ollenberger et al. (c-statistic 0.58 in that study) [ ].
The Wells rule had higher sensitivity but lower specificity in our orthopedic population than it does in the outpatient setting, where it has been shown to have 60% sensitivity and 80% specificity [ ]. This likely reflects the fact that all our patients had undergone surgery (+ 1.5 points on the Wells score), and many had leg swelling which could be interpreted as a sign of DVT. Therefore Wells scores in orthopedic patients tend to be skewed higher than in outpatients. The Wells rule can be used together with D-dimer testing to non-invasively rule out PE in the emergency department setting [ ]. However this strategy is less effective in the inpatient and post-surgical setting where D-dimer levels are often elevated even in the absence of DVT or PE [ , , ]. The recently validated “YEARS” CDR allows for a higher d-dimer cutoff (1000 ng/mL) in patients that lack signs of DVT, hemoptysis, or clinical impression that “PE is the most likely diagnosis”, and may prove to be more specific in the postoperative setting [ ].
PISA 2 in our population was much less accurate than in its published derivation sample. Specifically, the c-statistic in our cohort was 0.50 (95% CI 0.44–0.57) compared to 0.90 (95% CI 0.88–0.91) as previously published [ ]. Many patients in the original PISA 2 derivation study were hospitalized and may have had comorbidities that contributed to the accuracy of PISA 2. Our patients were generally healthy and medically optimized prior to their elective orthopedic surgery. This reduced the specificity of the PISA 2 which gives negative points to items such as orthopnea and previous pulmonary disease which were rare in our population.
Contemporary CTPA can detect SSPE that some argue are not clinically significant [ ]. Studies suggest that tachycardia alone is an accurate predictor of PE however [ ], and our study suggests that clinical criteria alone are unable to distinguish patients with SSPE from those with larger clots. It should also be noted that outcomes of patients with SSPE and larger PE appear to be the same [ ].
The strengths of our study are its large size and the homogeneity of the patient population studied. That very homogeneity may contribute to the difficulty in distinguishing orthopedic patients with and without PE using either clinician gestalt, or a CDR. Limitations of our study include its retrospective design, and the fact that some patients had to be excluded because they lacked full data to calculate both the Wells and PISA 2 scores. The Wells variable “PE most likely” is difficult to determine retrospectively, but in our study was adjudicated by at least three investigators using standardized definitions.
In conclusion, although the Wells rule (cutoff > 4) performs better than PISA 2 in orthopedic surgery patients, neither rule is sensitive enough to exclude PE non-invasively. Neither the Wells nor PISA 2 can distinguish patients with SSPE from those with larger clots. Adding the variables past smoking and varicose veins to the Wells rule improves its performance, but further studies are needed to validate this finding.
