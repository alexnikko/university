Introduction
Lipid emulsion (LE) is used for the treatment of systemic toxicity caused by local anesthetics or non-local anesthetics [ , ]. According to case reports and a systemic review of LE treatment on the toxicity caused by non-local anesthetic drugs, LE has been reported to be effective for the treatment of toxicity induced by calcium channel blockers, including verapamil and diltiazem [ , ]. In particular, toxicity induced by verapamil, among non-local anesthetic drugs, has been reported to respond relatively well to LE treatment compared with other calcium channel blockers [ , , ].
LE greatly attenuates apoptosis induced by a toxic dose of bupivacaine in H9c2 rat cardiomyoblasts compared with a toxic dose of mepivacaine, supporting the lipid sink theory [ , ]. The lipid sink theory states that the sequestration of a specific drug by LE is dependent on the lipid solubility of that drug [ ]. Among calcium channel blockers, the uptake of verapamil by ventricular muscle is enhanced compared with that of diltiazem, which may be associated with the lipid solubility of calcium channel blockers [ , ]. LE reduces the human serum concentration of verapamil under verapamil toxicity in a concentration-dependent manner and recovers impaired cardiac myocyte contractility, supporting the lipid sink theory [ , ]. Recently, it was reported that opioid receptors are involved in the LE-mediated recovery of bupivacaine toxicity based on an in vivo study [ ]. Additionally, LE attenuates reperfusion injury of the heart or bupivacaine-induced apoptosis of H9c2 cells via activation of a pathway involving phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K), Akt and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) [ , ]. A toxic dose of verapamil induces apoptosis in cells and tissues [ , , , , ]. A toxic plasma concentration of verapamil causes decreased left ventricular function, decreased coronary blood flow and sinus arrest [ , ]. Cardiac myocyte apoptosis follows myocardial ischemia and reperfusion [ ]. However, the effect of LE (Intralipid ® ) on the apoptosis induced by a toxic dose of verapamil in cardiomyocytes remains unknown. The goals of this in vitro study were to investigate the effect of LE on apoptosis induced by a toxic dose of verapamil in H9c2 rat cardiomyoblasts and to examine the associated cellular mechanism.
Materials and Methods
All of the experimental procedures and protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Gyeongsang National University. All of the experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals prepared by the National Academy of Sciences.
Cell Culture
The rat embryonic ventricular myocardial cell line H9c2 was cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (HyClone, GE Healthcare, Salt Lake City, UT, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA), 2 mM l -glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin, as described previously [ ]. Cells were grown in 100-mm dishes at 37 °C under 5% CO 2 and were subcultured when they reached 90% confluence.
Cell Viability
Cell viability was determined colorimetrically using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay as described previously [ ]. Cells at the exponential phase were seeded at 10 5 cells/well in 24-well plates. Next, 500 µl of a 0.1 mg/ml MTT solution was added to each well (0.05 mg/well), followed by incubation for 3 h at 37 °C in the dark. The supernatants were then aspirated; the formazan crystals in each well were dissolved in 200 µl of dimethyl sulfoxide for 30 min at 37 °C, and the absorbance at 570 nm was read on a VERSA max microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).
Cell Counting Assay
The cell counting assay was performed as described previously [ ]. H9c2 cells were seeded at a density of 10 5 cells/well into 24-well plates, then incubated for 24 h and synchronized to quiescence via serum starvation for 12 h. The cells were subsequently trypsinized, and cell numbers were determined using a Countess||FL automated cell counter (Life Technologies, Bothell, WA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Western Blotting
Proteins from different experimental groups were extracted as previously reported [ ]. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford method with bovine serum albumin as a standard [ ]. Approximately 30 µg of protein from each sample was subjected to electrophoresis on a 12 or 13.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel (SDS–PAGE), and the proteins were then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. The membranes were subsequently incubated in blocking buffer, Tris-buffed saline containing 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST, pH 7.6) with 5% nonfat dry milk powder for 2 h at room temperature. Next, the membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with specific primary antibodies (anti-caspase-3, anti-caspase-8 and anti-Bax antibodies) at a dilution of 1:1000 in TBST containing 5% skim milk. The blots were finally incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted 1:5000 in TBST containing 5% skim milk for 1 h at room temperature. The signal was visualized on X-ray film after detection with an enhanced chemiluminescent reagent, SuperSignal ® West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, USA).
TUNEL Assay
The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay was performed to examine the effect of verapamil alone and a combined treatment of LE and verapamil on the apoptosis of H9c2 cells as described previously [ ]. Immunohistochemical procedures for detecting apoptotic H9c2 cells were conducted using a TUNEL kit (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Fluorescence staining was viewed with a fluorescence microscope (Olympus Optical Co. Ltd., Fluoview 500, Tokyo, Japan).

Data Analysis
The effects of verapamil or diltiazem alone and a combined treatment of either LE and verapamil or LE and diltiazem on the cell viability and cell counts were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni’s posttest. The effects of verapamil alone, a combined treatment of inhibitor and verapamil, a combined treatment of LE and verapamil, a combined treatment of inhibitor, LE and verapamil and inhibitor alone on cell viability, were analyzed through one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s posttest. The effects of verapamil and diltiazem on the LE-mediated attenuation of decreased cell viability were analyzed with the unpaired Student’s t test. The effects of verapamil alone, a combined treatment of LE and verapamil, a combined treatment of inhibitors and LE and verapamil, and treatment with inhibitor alone on cleaved caspase-3, caspase-8 and Bax expression and the numbers of TUNEL-positive cells were analyzed via one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s posttest. P values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Results
Verapamil (2 × 10 −4 M) and diltiazem (3.5 × 10 −4 M) decreased the cell viability of H9c2 rat cardiomyoblasts (Fig. 1 ; P < 0.001 versus the control), whereas LE (0.05 and 0.1%) attenuated the decrease in cell viability induced by verapamil or diltiazem (Fig. 1 ; P < 0.001 versus verapamil or diltiazem alone). Additionally, verapamil (2 × 10 −4 M) and diltiazem (3.5 × 10 −4 M) decreased the cell count of H9c2 cells (Fig. 2 ; P < 0.001 versus the control), whereas LE (0.05 and 0.1%) attenuated the decrease in cell counts induced by verapamil or diltiazem (Fig. 2 ; P < 0.001 versus verapamil or diltiazem alone). The magnitude of LE-mediated attenuation of decreased cell viability was enhanced for the verapamil-induced decrease in cell viability compared with the diltiazem-induced decrease in cell viability (Fig. 3 ; P < 0.001). The non-selective opioid receptor antagonist naloxone (5 × 10 −4 M), the Akt inhibitor MK-2206 (10 −7 M), the PI3-K inhibitor LY294002 (3 × 10 −6 M) and the delta-opioid receptor antagonist naltrindole hydrochloride (10 −5 M) had no effect on the verapamil-induced decrease in cell viability (Fig. 4 ). However, naloxone and naltrindole hydrochloride inhibited the LE-mediated attenuation of decreased cell viability induced by verapamil (Fig. 5 a, b; P < 0.001 versus combined treatment of LE and verapamil), whereas the kappa-opioid receptor antagonist nor-binaltorphimine dihydrochloride did not significantly alter the LE-mediated attenuation of decreased cell viability induced by verapamil (Fig. 5 b). LY294002 (10 −6 M) and MK-2206 (10 −7 M) reduced the LE-mediated attenuation of the decrease in cell viability induced by verapamil in H9c2 cells (Fig. 5 c, d; P < 0.001 versus combined treatment of LE and verapamil). However, the GSK-3β inhibitor SB216763 did not significantly alter the LE-mediated attenuation of the verapamil-induced decrease in cell viability (Fig. 5 e).

The magnitude of the LE-mediated attenuation of the reduction of cell viability induced by verapamil or diltiazem is expressed as the difference in cell viability between a combined treatment of LE and a calcium channel blocker (verapamil or diltiazem) and treatment with a calcium channel blocker (verapamil or diltiazem) alone.

Verapamil (2 × 10 −4 M) increased cleaved caspase-3 expression in H9c2 cells (Fig. 6 a; P < 0.001 versus the control), whereas LE (0.05 and 0.1%) attenuated the increased expression of cleaved caspase-3 induced by verapamil (Fig. 6 a; P < 0.001 versus verapamil alone). LE (0.05 and 0.1%) also attenuated the increase in cleaved caspase-8 expression induced by verapamil (Fig. 6 b; P < 0.001 versus verapamil alone). However, verapamil alone and combined treatment of LE and verapamil had no effect on Bax expression (Fig. 6 c). Naloxone, naltrindole hydrochloride, LY294002 and MK-2206 inhibited the LE (0.05%)-mediated attenuation of the increase in cleaved caspase-3 expression induced by verapamil (Fig. 7 a–c; P < 0.001 versus combined treatment of LE and verapamil).

Discussion
This is the first study suggesting that LE attenuates the apoptosis of H9c2 cells induced by a toxic dose of verapamil via inhibition of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, which is mediated by the delta-opioid receptor, PI3-K and Akt and appears to be associated with the lipid solubility of calcium channel blockers. The major findings of this in vitro study are as follows: (1) The magnitude of the LE-mediated attenuation of the decrease in cell viability induced by a calcium channel blocker was greater for verapamil than for diltiazem; and (2) naloxone, naltrindole hydrochloride, LY294002 and MK-2206 attenuated the LE-mediated inhibition of both the decreased cell viability induced by verapamil and the increased expression of caspase-3 and caspase-8 induced by verapamil.
According to research aimed at investigating the uptake of calcium channel blockers into cardiac and smooth muscle and the lipid solubility of calcium channel blockers, the uptake of calcium channel blockers occurs in the following decreasing order: bepridil, verapamil, nifedipine and diltiazem; the lipid solubility of calcium channel blockers shows the following decreasing order: bepridil, verapamil, nifedipine and diltiazem [ , ]. Previous studies have suggested that the order of uptake of calcium channel blockers into cardiac muscle appears to be strongly correlated with the order of the lipid solubility (oil/Ringer partition coefficient) of calcium channel blockers [ , ]. Similar to a previous report showing that LE exerts a greater attenuation effect on the decrease in cell viability induced by the more lipid-soluble bupivacaine than that induced by the less lipid-soluble mepivacaine, LE attenuated the verapamil-induced decrease in cell viability to a greater extent than the diltiazem-induced decrease in cell viability, suggesting that the LE-mediated increase in cell viability is likely correlated with the lipid solubility of calcium channel blockers (Fig. 3 ) [ ]. Additionally, several case reports have suggested that LE is effective in treating toxicity induced by verapamil or diltiazem [ , , , , , , ]. Although systemic reviews and case reports are not randomized controlled trials, according to systemic reviews addressing the effect of LE on the toxicity induced by calcium channel blockers, LE treatment may be more effective for treating verapamil toxicity than diltiazem toxicity [ , , ]. Thus, the results of these systemic reviews may be associated with the lipid solubility of calcium channel blockers, supporting the lipid sink theory [ , , , , ]. Pretreatment with naloxone, MK-2206, LY294002 and naltrindole hydrochloride had no effect on the verapamil-induced decrease in cell viability, whereas these drugs inhibited the LE-mediated attenuation of the decreased cell viability induced by verapamil. Considering previous reports, these results suggest that the LE-mediated enhancement of cell viability in H9c2 cells involves the activation of opioid receptors, PI3-K and Akt and appears to be associated with a nonspecific antidotal effect [ ]. In the current study, the GSK-3β inhibitor SB216763 did not significantly alter the LE-mediated attenuation of the decrease in cell viability induced by a toxic dose of verapamil, suggesting that the LE-mediated enhancement of cell survival may involve GSK-3β phosphorylation associated with the inhibition of mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening [ ].
A toxic dose of verapamil causes decreased myocardial contractility and sinus arrest, leading to myocardial ischemia [ , ]. Apoptosis, necrosis and autophagy are involved in cell death following myocardial ischemia and reperfusion [ ]. A toxic dose of verapamil induces apoptosis in cortical neurons, rat eggs, retinal pigment epithelial cells and chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells [ , , , ]. Pretreatment with a high dose of naloxone and the delta-opioid receptor antagonist naltrindole hydrochloride was shown to abolish the LE-mediated recovery of bupivacaine-induced cardiotoxicity in an in vivo study via GSK-3β phosphorylation [ ]. Additionally, opioid and delta-opioid receptors have been reported to be involved in the inhibition of apoptosis due to ischemia and reperfusion or hypoxia and reoxygenation, leading to cardioprotection [ , , ]. Similar to previous reports and in agreement with the results regarding cell viability obtained in the current study, naloxone and naltrindole hydrochloride attenuated the LE-mediated inhibition of the common downstream proapoptotic protein cleaved caspase-3, induced by a toxic dose of verapamil, suggesting that the delta-opioid receptor appears to mainly be involved in the LE-mediated attenuation of apoptosis induced by a toxic dose of verapamil [ , , , ]. LE has been reported to attenuate ischemia/reperfusion injury-induced myocardial infarction and bupivacaine-induced apoptosis of H9c2 cells through PI3-K/Akt/GSK-3β [ , ]. Similar to previous reports and in agreement with the results of our cell viability analysis, the PI3-K inhibitor LY294002 and the Akt inhibitor MK-2206 attenuated the LE-mediated inhibition of cleaved caspase-3 expression induced by a toxic dose of verapamil, suggesting that the LE-mediated attenuation of apoptosis appears to be mediated by PI3-K and Akt [ , ]. Because LE attenuates the bupivacaine-induced apoptosis of H9c2 cells via GSK-3β phosphorylation and the GSK-3β inhibitor, SB216763 had no effect on the LE-mediated attenuation of the decrease in cell viability induced by a toxic dose of verapamil in the current study, further research to examine whether the LE-mediated inhibition of apoptosis induced by a toxic dose of verapamil is mediated by GSK-3β phosphorylation is needed [ ]. Taken together with previous reports, these results suggest that the activation of a pathway involving the delta-opioid receptor, PI3-K and Akt may contribute to the inhibition of cellular signaling pathways upstream of apoptotic death induced by a toxic dose of verapamil [ , , , , ]. Selective delta-opioid receptor antagonists are involved reducing infarct size via the activation of adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium channels [ ]. Further studies addressing either the relationship of the pathway involving the delta-opioid receptor, PI3-K and Akt or the role of the adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium channel are necessary to elucidate the detailed cellular mechanism involved. The apoptotic pathways of cell death can be divided into intrinsic and extrinsic pathways, ultimately leading to activation of the downstream effector cleaved caspase-3 [ ]. The extrinsic apoptotic pathway is induced by the binding of a ligand to the transmembrane death receptor, which leads to activation of cleaved caspase-8 [ ]. The intrinsic apoptotic pathway is associated with various extracellular and intracellular stimuli, leading to the activation of proapoptotic proteins such as Bax, Bid and Bak [ ]. LE attenuated the enhancement of the expression of cleaved caspase-8 induced by verapamil, whereas verapamil alone or combined treatment of LE and verapamil did not significantly alter Bax expression. Taken together, these findings indicate that the LE-mediated attenuation of apoptosis induced by a toxic dose of verapamil is likely associated with inhibition of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway [ ]. Consistent with the inhibitory effect of LE on the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, naloxone, naltrindole hydrochloride and LY294002 attenuated the LE-mediated inhibition of the increase in cleaved caspase-8 expression induced by verapamil. The possible mechanisms associated with the effects of LE treatment on drug toxicity include lipid sink effects, inotropic effects, an increased fatty acid supply, drug redistribution and Akt-induced GSK-3β phosphorylation [ , , , ]. As fatty acid oxidation is involved in the LE-mediated recovery of bupivacaine-induced cardiac toxicity and verapamil-induced toxicity reduces myocardial fatty acid extraction, the fatty acid supply provided by LE may contribute to the LE-mediated attenuation of apoptosis [ , ].
Consistent with the LE-mediated attenuation of caspase-3 expression induced by a toxic dose of verapamil, verapamil increased the number of TUNEL-positive cells, and LE attenuated the increase in TUNEL-positive cells induced by verapamil. It has been reported that LE attenuates the increase in TUNEL-positive cells induced by a toxic dose of bupivacaine via the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways or the PI3-K/Akt/GSK-3β pathway [ , ]. Considering previous reports and the results of TUNEL assays obtained in the present study, the LE-mediated attenuation of apoptosis induced by verapamil observed in the current study may be nonspecific [ , ]. In addition, biomarkers including creatinine kinase, lactic dehydrogenase and cardiac troponin have been used to indicate myocardial injury [ ]. Further study regarding the effect of LE on these biomarkers induced by cardiac toxicity due to a toxic dose of verapamil is needed.
LE increases the mean blood pressure, survival time and the median lethal dose in verapamil toxicity [ , ]. In addition, in terms of the cellular death induced by a toxic dose of verapamil, our results suggest that LE reduces apoptotic cellular death of cardiac myocytes following verapamil toxicity. However, this study possesses some limitations. First, it was an in vitro study using H9c2 rat cardiomyoblasts, whereas systemic toxicity induced by verapamil in an in vivo state causes not only myocardial depression but also vasodilation, leading to severe hypotension [ ]. Second, we employed H9c2 cells obtained from rat hearts, whereas H9c2 cells have been reported to show properties of skeletal muscle [ ].
Taken together, the results of the present study suggest that LE attenuates apoptosis induced by a toxic dose of verapamil in H9c2 cells. This anti-apoptotic effect is mediated by the extrinsic apoptotic pathway involving the delta-opioid receptor, PI3-K and Akt and appears to be associated with the lipid solubility of calcium channel blockers.
