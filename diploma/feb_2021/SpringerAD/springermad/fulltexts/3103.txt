Introduction
Today, cancer is a major health problem worldwide [ ]. According to reports, ovarian malignancies have had a large amount of contributions in literature [ ]. The highest incidence of ovarian cancer has been reported in America and Europe while Japan and developing countries has had the lowest incidence [ ]. Ovarian cancer comprises almost 3% of all cancers among American women population, so it is considered as the fifth cause of cancer-related death there [ ]. Its annual treatment costs are estimated around $4.4 billion [ ]. In Iran, ovarian cancer is the eighth most common cancer, twelfth deadly, and sixteenth costly cancer [ ]. The most common type of ovarian cancer is epithelial cell tumors, and epithelial ovarian cancer causes 90% of ovarian malignancies and 1/4 women’s genital malignancies. It is usually deadly due to late diagnosis. Epithelial ovarian cancer includes various types: serous (the most common, 50% of all ovarian cancers), mucinous (15–20%), endometrioid (25–10%), clear cell (10.5%), undifferentiated (5%), and Brenner (5%). Fifteen percent of epithelial cancers of the ovary are usually the moderate ones and diagnosed at lower ages and stage with a better prognosis [ ]. Due to the higher incidence of epithelial type, especially in industrialized countries, the majority of reports and research on ovarian cancer are related to this type. So far, no certain method has been confirmed for screening for ovarian cancer and no good biomarker for early diagnosis of ovarian cancer has been specified for this deadly cancer. If the first stage diagnosis increases from 25 to 75%, death rate would decrease to 50%. The overall 5-year survival rate of ovarian serous in the early stages confined to the organ is 90–95 and 30–40% at an advanced stage [ ]. Majority of studies have proved that two-dimensional electrophoresis can determine the differences between normal and cancerous proteomes of cells [ ]. Proteome of ovarian tissue can be a potential source of biomarker for early detection of this disease [ ]. In recent decades, new proteomics technologies have been developed to help us find the appropriate protein biomarker in serum. Screening for ovarian serous cancer leads to discovering the relationship between the gene and protein associated with cancer [ ]. This study aimed at using the proteomic techniques, protein factors of low-grade ovarian serous cancer tissue have been studied and analyzed, and the difference between its gene expression and normal ovarian cells was studied.
Apparently, identifying these patterns and using clinical evidence, a number of proteins can be introduced and highlighted for diagnosis and targeted appropriate conservative treatments for this disease. Moreover, as all studies so far have considered metastatic or high-stage ovarian cancer, this study sought low-grade ovarian serous which is of high importance and aimed at obtaining protein biomarkers useful for diagnosis and treatment of ovarian serous cancer.
Materials and Methods
In this experimental study, ten women with low-grade serous ovarian cancer and ten women without ovarian cancer who were referred to the hospitals of Guilan University of Medical Sciences in Rasht since 2014–2015 were sampled.
Examples of scientific information relevant to the study variables, without restriction of any kind, patient and personal information are used only by a specific code and are normally archived.
After obtaining written informed consent forms, ten healthy volunteers entered in the study during ovarian tissue surgery and a sample size of 1 × 1 cm was taken. A portion of it was sent to a pathology laboratory to confirm then normal tissue. The other portion was immediately transferred to the liquid nitrogen tank to be transferred to the Proteomics Laboratory of Clinical Proteomics Research Center of Shahid Beheshti University. Tumor sampling was conducted on ten patients during surgery. A part of tissue was sent to the same pathology laboratory to be pathologically tested (cancer confirmation). The other part of the sample was then transferred to the tank of liquid nitrogen with 96 °C temperature in < 2 min and sent to Proteomics Laboratory of Clinical Proteomics Research Center of Shahid Beheshti University for the study of proteomics. For protein extraction, frozen healthy and cancerous tissues of patients under liquid nitrogen condition were powdered completely. The resulting powder with lubricating buffer containing Tris–HCL, magnesium chloride, EDTA and phenyl methyl sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and 5 mm beta-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% CHAPS, and 10% glycerol was kept in ice for 30 min. Then, the solution was centrifuged in 16,000× g round at 4 °C for 30 min, and protein assay was performed by Bradford technique [ ]. For a two-dimensional electrophoresis, the sample was washed three times with PBS buffer and placed in 300 microliters of lubricating buffer M urea, 2 M Thurea urea, 4% (CHAPS), 0.2–0.3 DTT, 1–2% Ampholine (with 3–10 Ph) and was shaken for an hour in room temperature. Then, the lysed solution was centrifuged by 10,000× g round. The solution was maintained in 20 °C. In order to test the accuracy, for each healthy and ill case, it was repeated three times. Dry strip was placed in the buffer for a single night to be dewatered. Sample was also taken during the dewatering. Then, based on (Bio-rad) IEF-IPG system, two-dimensional electrophoresis was performed. Next, gels were placed in balancing buffer for second level of electrophoresis. Strip was placed on the second-level (surface) gel with and was fixed with 0.5% agarose in electrophoresis buffer containing SDS (25 mM Tris, 192 mm glycine, 0.1% SDS) and then started to work vertically. For protein staining by Coomassie Blue stain , following electrophoresis gel was placed for 6 h in a solution of 40% methanol, 10% acetic acid, and 0.025% Coomassie color, which is filtered by using whatman paper filter. Gel was placed in bleaching solution continuously until the discoloring of the entire field. Analysis of image spots (proteins) which appeared on the gel was done based on following steps: scanning the gel image, identifying protein spots and quantifying (evaluating the color intensity of spot), matching gels, data analysis, data interpretation, and finally creation of two-dimensional electrophoresis databases [ ]. We used Chi-square examination, ANOVA, post hoc examination by LSD method for statistical analysis. The data were analyzed by using SPSS-16 software. The significance level was considered p < 0.05.
Results
After extraction, ovarian tissue and its proteome were studied by 2-DE technique. The results obtained in this study are based on comparing the pooling gels obtained from ten healthy and ten cancerous tissue; the changes were calculated by mean and standard deviation (SD). The mean and SD of age of healthy group were, respectively, 34 ± 12.8 and 53.3 ± 10.33 years in cancerous individuals. Out of ten healthy individuals of this study, two patients (20%) had cystic ovarian, and five patients (50%) had mass and three patients (3%) indeed surgery because of crevice cancer. Moreover, in patients, one (10%) had cystic ovarian and nine (90%) had pelvic mass.
In terms of pathology in healthy group out of ten persons in this study, six (60%) had benign, four (40%) had non-cancerous changes, and in patients with ovarian cancer, each (100%) had serous pathology. In this study, out of ten healthy persons, four (40%) had family history and in cancer patients, five (50%) had reported clashes with ovarian cancer. The patient characteristics are shown in Table 1 .

As is shown in Fig. 1 , 212 proteins were identified, 41 of which had changes in protein expression in cancer state. The expression of eight (19.5%) proteins was suppressed, and five (12.2%) proteins were expressed in cancer in cancerous group. Thirteen (31.7%) proteins in cancer samples showed increase in expression and 15 (36/6%) proteins reduced expression in cancerous tissue (Table 2 ).

Discussion
Because this study was the first study on low-grade serous ovarian cancer, by this method of proteomics in human, we could not compare that with previous studies [ ]. With the recent advent of high-throughput technologies, many studies have been performed to identify the subtypes of ovarian cancer using genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic approaches in order to determine the subpopulations that could potentially benefit from personalized medicine [ ]. Specifically, proteomic profiling of ovarian cancer includes the analysis of ovarian cancer cell lines, tissues, and proximal fluids using mass spectrometry (MS). This has led to the identification of numerous altered protein expression patterns of the disease [ ].
The study of protein expression in ovarian cancer is very important as proteins are the mediators of all biological processes and the molecular targets of the majority of drugs. Furthermore, the proteome integrates the cellular genetic information and environmental influences [ ]. Using proteomics technology to study the cancerous tissues along with identification of polypeptides in healthy tissues has made it possible for scientists to find biochemical markers to diagnose the degree, type, and extent of the cancer [ ]. Now, with effective methods such as two-dimensional electrophoresis, steps can be taken for detection of markers of this type’s cancer in order to take the most effective treatments before the development of the disease such as in treatment of lung cancer by identifying markers and diagnosis by two-dimensional electrophoresis [ , ].
In our study, 212 proteins were recognized, 41 of which were identified with changes in protein expression while cancerous. The expression of eight proteins in tomours group was suppressed, and five proteins were expressed. Thirteen proteins showed increased expression while cancerous and 15 proteins showed decreased expression in cancerous tissue.
Figure 1 shows the separated proteins by two-dimensional electrophoresis, and the tested sample is of a normal ovarian tissue.
Figure 2 portrays the sample of a low-grade serous ovarian cancer tissue. The gels shown in figures have the ability to be compared and bioinformatically analyzed, so the spots on two gels were compared by Flicker software (Fig. 3 ). In this study, 212 spots on normal tissue and cancerous tissue of ovarian were found, which had expression changes. On the basis of statistical comparisons made on electron load and molecular weight proteins, it was observed that the more malignant the proteins become, the more acidic their electron load and the less their molecular weight would be such as Rezaie-Tavirani studies on breast cancer proteome on 2015 [ ]. Thus, 41 different spots due to cancerous and normal tissues of ovarian show a massive change which happen in body following the tissue becoming tumorous, which is consistent with that of a study by Chow; according to their study, 12 proteins’ expression was different [ ]. On the other hand, Jones studied on metabolomics serum profiling detects early-stage high-grade serous ovarian cancer in a mouse model and they were introduced 18 metabolites as a metabolic panel which associated with serous ovarian cancer early [ ].

In other words, differences in expression of proteins while developing tumor demonstrate that the regulation of a large number of genes had altered. Difference in gene expression of the two gels can be useful for achieving protein markers for diagnosis and treatment of patients with this type of tumor [ ].
On the other hand, our results showed that most of the subjects were 34–53 years old, which is consistent with that of a study by Arab et al. [ ]. The rate of incidence for those under 40 years old was low and high for 50 years and above [ ].
In our study, the highest incidence of ovarian cancer was seen in 53-year- old subjects.
A few approaches have been carried out to characterize the differential protein expression between primary and recurrent ovarian cancer tissues [ ].
Simultaneous change in many proteins in this disease can indicate biochemical and mechanisms involved in incidence of it, which can be effective for medicinal purposes in the treatment process [ ]. Overall, the importance of using biological tissues for discovery is evident through the various studies that implicate different biological pathways in drug resistance [ ].
This study was conducted for the first time in Iran. Therefore, since today more diagnoses are based on detection of protein, changes in gene expression can be more helpful in identifying the biomarkers of the disease more effectively [ , ]. Thus, reducing or suppressing the expression of a large number of tissue proteins in serous ovarian cancer tissue makes these changed proteins be used as biomarker of the disease and thus effective in diagnosis and treatment.
