Introduction
In 2016, an estimated 25,080 women were diagnosed with ovarian cancer (OC) in North America [ , ]. Approximately 15,990 women will die from the disease, making OC the 5th most common cause of cancer deaths in women and the leading cause of gynecological cancer-related death in the USA [ , ]. The first-line treatment of OC involves a combination of surgery and platinum- or taxane-based chemotherapy, which leads to remission in 70% of patients [ , , , ]. However, due to the lack of effective maintenance treatments to prevent relapse, the majority of these patients experience cancer recurrence, at which point tumours often become drug resistant. As a result, OC has a poor 5-year survivorship of 46.2%, which can be attributed to late diagnosis and the lack of effective second-line therapies for patients who relapse [ , , , , ]. Thus, there is an urgent need for new second-line therapies to improve the prognosis of OC.
More than one-third of OC patients present with ascites at the time of diagnosis, an indicator of peritoneal spread of the cancer [ , , ]. Ascites acts a reservoir for malignant cells, immune cells and immunoregulatory factors that can encourage tumour growth and suppress the host immune system, enabling disease relapse [ , , ]. In vivo and in vitro data suggest cancer immunotherapy as an alluring alternative to standard chemotherapy regimens [ , , , , , ]. Immunotherapy as a second-line treatment for OC aims to eradicate persisting OC cells by harnessing the power of an individual’s immune system to target the immune regulation in ascites, with minimal associated toxicity [ , , ].
In particular, NK cells are attractive candidates for cellular therapy since they are able to recognize cancer cells without prior sensitization [ , ]. A higher number of infiltrating NK cells in various carcinomas serves as a positive prognostic marker in cancer patients [ , , ]. Conversely, in the case of OC, an increased infiltration of NK cells in ascites correlates with poorer prognosis [ ]. This paradoxical finding may be related to recent studies, which show NK cells derived from the ascites of OCPs (OCP ascites-NK cells) display altered phenotypes and impaired cytotoxic function [ , , , ].
NK cells can be classified into two main subsets that differ in terms of phenotype, function and localization within the body: CD56 bright CD16 − or CD56 dim CD16 + [ ]. About 40% of OCP ascites-NK cells belong to the weakly cytotoxic CD56 bright CD16 − subset, whereas over 90% of peripheral blood (PB)-NK cells carry the highly cytolytic CD56 dim CD16 + phenotype [ , , , , ]. Interestingly, CD56 bright CD16 − cells closely resemble decidual NK cells, which secrete pro-angiogenic factors and are characterized as “builders” instead of “killers”, as they facilitate tissue remodeling for implantation and fetal development [ , ]. Due to the striking similarities between tumour-associated NK cells and decidual NK cells, it is speculated that tumour-associated NK cells, like those found in OCP ascites, may also play a pro-angiogenic and pro-tumourigenic role in facilitating OC progression [ , ]. Given the therapeutic potential of cytotoxic NK cells, transforming these tumour-enabling OCP ascites-NK cells into activated, cytotoxic effector lymphocytes may be an attractive therapeutic target for OC [ , ].
Ex vivo expansion techniques have proven successful at generating clinically relevant quantities of activated NK cells. These expanded NK cells can be reintroduced into cancer patients to treat various hematological and malignant cancers [ , , , ]. Though the use of artificial antigen-presenting cells (aAPCs) or plasma-membrane particles for the ex vivo generation of therapeutic NK cells derived from PB (PB-NK cells) has been well documented, no previous group has studied the ex vivo expansion or activation potential of tumour-associated NK cells [ , , , ]. The ability to do so could warrant for the direct, intraperitoneal infusion of expanded NK cells and/or activation factors (such as aAPCs or plasma-membrane particles) to stimulate endogenous NK cell expansion and cytotoxicity, which would help promote an anti-tumour environment in the peritoneal cavity of OCPs. To assess the potential of activating OCP ascites-NK cells, our group employed an aAPC-mediated expansion approach to generate vast quantities of expanded NK cells derived from the OC tumour environment. We sought to determine the clinical efficacy of using expanded OCP ascites-NK cells in a novel, autologous model of NK cell immunotherapy by first measuring their potential for ex vivo expansion. Next, we evaluated their anti-tumour function after expansion by assessing NK cell phenotype, proinflammatory cytokine production and cytolytic activity against primary OC cells derived from autologous OCPs.

Ethics statement
Research involving the use of human samples was approved by the Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board. All samples were obtained with written, informed consent and were collected from healthy donors (HDs) at the McMaster Immunology Research Centre (Hamilton, ON), or from patients diagnosed with advanced-stage OC at the Juravinski Cancer Centre (Hamilton, ON). Ascites was collected from OCPs undergoing paracentesis, which was performed as part of the standard care to alleviate the symptoms of ascites.
Cell lines
K562 cells that co-express CD64, CD86, CD137L, truncated CD19, and membrane-bound IL-21, designated as K562 Clone 9.mbIL21, were a kind gift from Dean A. Lee (Department of Pediatrics, Nationwide Children’s Hospital, Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, USA). Irradiated K562 Clone 9.mbIL21 cells served as feeder cells to stimulate the expansion and activation of NK cells. The human ovarian cancer cell line, OVCAR-8, was a kind gift from Karen Mossman (McMaster Immunology Research Centre, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON).
Ex vivo NK cell expansion protocol
Ascites-derived cells were resuspended in complete RPMI-1640 medium (supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM l -glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin and 1% HEPES; Thermo Fischer Scientific, Burlington, ON). Mononuclear cells from ascites or PB were isolated using Lymphoprep™ (Stemcell Technologies, Vancouver, BC) as described previously [ , ]. Mononuclear cells were cultured in complete RPMI medium supplemented with 100 U/mL of interleukin (IL)-2 (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA) and irradiated K562-membrane bound-IL-21 aAPCs, as mentioned previously [ , ]. Total fold expansion was determined as described previously [ ].
Cell stimulation
Expanded NK cells were stimulated with a “control”, IL-2 (100 U/mL), or “cytokine-activated” cocktail, IL-2 (100 U/mL), IL-12 (10 ng/mL), IL-15 (20 ng/mL) (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA) and IL-18 (100 ng/mL; Medical & Biological Laboratories, Nagano, Japan), for 24 h. Interferon (IFN)-γ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in supernatants were measured using the respective Human DuoSet ELISA Kits from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), as per manufacturer’s instructions.
Flow cytometry
Cells were stained for surface markers using conjugated anti-human antibodies as described previously [ ]. Samples were run on the BD LSRII flow cytometer and FlowJo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR) was used for analysis. Fluorescence minus one controls were utilized for all flow cytometry experiments. CD56 + CD3 − populations were evaluated for NK cell surface marker expression.
Antibodies
The following anti-human antibodies were used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. From BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA): CD3, NKp46, CD69, CD11b, CD158a, EpCAM-1. From BioLegend (San Diego, CA): CD45, CD56, CD16, NKG2D, NKp30, NKp44, CD27, CD25, CD158b, CD107a, ILT-2, CD158d, PD-1. From Miltenyi Biotec (Bergisch Gladbach, Germany): NKG2A. From eBioscience (Santa Clara, CA): Fixable Viability Dye eFluor ® 780.
Cytotoxicity assays
Flow cytometry-based cytotoxicity assay: Carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-labeled OVCAR-8 or primary, ascites-derived OC cells were incubated with expanded NK cells for 5 h at 37 °C (basal cell lysis = tumour cells alone). Prior to co-incubation, NK cells were either treated with IL-2 (100 U/mL) or ascites supernatant (supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 U/mL of IL-2) for 72 h. After 5 h of incubation, supernatants were assayed for IFN-γ, TNF-α and VEGF. Cells were then stained with Fixable Viability Dye eFluor ® 780. Primary OC cells were further stained with anti-CD45 and anti-EpCAM-1 antibodies. Samples were analyzed using flow cytometry. CFSE + CD45 − or CD45 − EpCAM-1 + populations were analyzed for viability dye-positive events (% experimental lysis) and % specific lysis was calculated using the following formula: % specific lysis = [100 × (% experimental lysis − % basal cell lysis)/(100 − % basal cell lysis)].
CD107a degranulation assay: expanded NK cells were co-incubated with OVCAR-8 cells at a 5:1 ratio or in media alone. Anti-CD107a antibody was added immediately. After 1 h, brefeldin A (5 μg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, ON) and GolgiStop™ (2.0 µM; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) was added and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were stained with anti-human CD3 and CD56 antibodies for 30 min and analyzed using flow cytometry.
Statistical analyses
Statistical comparisons were performed using GraphPad Version 6.0 software. A two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test was used to compare the means between two groups. A one-way ANOVA was used to examine experiments containing more than two groups (* P ≤ 0.05; ** P ≤ 0.01; *** P ≤ 0.001, **** P ≤ 0.0001).
Results
NK cells derived from OCP PB and ascites can be expanded, ex vivo, to obtain a log-scale proliferation of expanded NK cells in 28 days
Numerous studies have reported a well-established aAPC-based NK cell expansion method that induces NK cell proliferation from HD PB or umbilical cord blood, however, no previous groups have attempted to use similar techniques to expand tumour associated-NK cells [ , , ]. We sought to determine whether this method could be used to expand and activate NK cells derived from OCP PB or ascites. After 28 days of the co-culture expansion system, OCP PB- and ascites-NK cells yielded a mean fold expansion of 9001 ± 2010-fold and 21,451 ± 12,519-fold, respectively (Fig. 1 a). Although the heterogenous mononuclear cell fraction from OCP ascites used for NK cell expansion consisted of tumour cells and leukocytes, both NK cell cultures were approximately 90% CD56 + CD3 − after 3 weeks of expansion (Fig. 1 b). Moreover, no significant differences in the mean fold expansion were observed between the two groups at the indicated time points.

Statistical analysis was performed using a two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test
Ex vivo expansion results in a shift towards a cytotoxic CD56brightCD16+ phenotype across HD PB-, OCP PB- and OCP ascites-NK cells
As resting ascites-NK cells have an enriched weakly cytotoxic CD56 bright CD16 − subset [ , , , ], we sought to compare the CD56/CD16 subsets between resting and expanded NK cells (Fig. 2 ). In resting OCP ascites NK cells, there was a significant increase in immunoregulatory CD56 bright CD16 − NK cells, coupled with a significantly reduced amount of cytotoxic CD56 dim CD16 + NK cells, as compared to resting HD and OCP PB-NK cells (Fig. 2 a, c).
Fig. 2 Ex vivo expansion causes a shift towards the cytotoxic CD56 bright CD16 + subset across healthy donor (HD) peripheral blood (PB)-, ovarian cancer patient (OCP) PB- and OCP ascites-NK cells. a Mean percentage of CD56 bright CD16 − and CD56 dim CD16 + cells in resting NK cells isolated from HD PB ( n = 6), OCP PB ( n = 3) and OCP ascites ( n = 4). b Mean percentage of CD56 bright CD16 − and CD56 bright CD16 + in expanded HD PB- ( n = 3), OCP PB- ( n = 4) and OCP ascites-NK cells ( n = 5). c Representative flow plots of resting NK cells and expanded NK cells, where the expression of CD56 is shown on the x axis and CD16 is shown on the y axis. Indicated in the top left quadrant of each flow plot are the percentages of each cell population in the respective quadrants. Statistical analysis was performed using a one-way ANOVA (* P ≤ 0.05; ** P ≤ 0.01)
However, after 3 weeks of expansion, all HD PB-, OCP PB-, and OCP ascites-NK cells expressed a CD56 bright phenotype (Fig. 2 b, c); in fact, the majority of expanded NK cells in all groups belonged to a unique, cytotoxic CD56 bright CD16 + subset. This expanded, cytotoxic CD56 bright CD16 + subset differed from the previously mentioned resting, immature CD56 bright CD16 − NK cells as they were detected after ex vivo expansion and acquired the expression of CD16. Moreover, there were no significant differences among the levels of CD56 bright CD16 + or CD56 bright CD16 − cells across the expanded NK cell groups (Fig. 2 b). CD56 bright CD16 + and CD56 bright CD16 − cells were further analyzed to compare the immunoregulatory phenotypes of these populations. Overall, there were no significant differences in the surface expression of inhibitory markers CD158d, PD-1, NKG2A and ILT-2 between the two expanded NK cell populations (Supplementary Fig. 1).
Resting OCP ascites-NK cells show an altered expression of activating, maturity and inhibitory surface markers in comparison to resting HD PB- and OCP PB-NK cells
Since resting OCP ascites-NK cells have an altered phenotype, we then assessed the surface expression of activating (Fig. 3 a–f), maturity (Fig. 3 g–i) and inhibitory (Fig. 3 j–l) markers on resting NK cells [ , , , , ]. In comparison to resting HD or OCP PB-NK cells, a significantly decreased number of resting OCP ascites-NK cells expressed activating marker CD16/FcγRIII and inhibitory marker CD158a (Fig. 3 a, k). There was also a trend towards a decreased number of resting OCP ascites-NK cells that expressed activating marker NKp30 and maturity marker CD11b (Fig. 3 d, h). Expression of activating marker CD69, however, was markedly increased among OCP ascites-NK cells as compared to HD or OCP PB-NK cells (Fig. 3 b). Moreover, although our data show an increased number of CD56 bright CD16 − NK cells in resting OCP-ascites NK cells (Fig. 2 a, c), NKp44 and CD25 expression remained low in this NK cell group and is comparable to that of resting HD and OCP PB-NK cells (Fig. 3 e, g). Overall, while resting HD and OCP PB-NK cells displayed similar phenotypes, resting OCP ascites-NK cells were distinct from PB-NK cells in terms of activating, maturity, and inhibitory marker expression.
Fig. 3 Ex vivo expansion increases the surface expression of activating markers and creates a unified phenotype across expanded healthy donor (HD) peripheral blood (PB)-, ovarian cancer patient (OCP) PB- and OCP ascites-NK cells. Flow cytometry was used to assess the surface expression of a – f activating, g – i maturity and j – l inhibitory markers on the CD56 + CD3 − (NK cell) population derived from resting HD PB- ( n = 4–8), OCP PB- ( n = 3–7) and OCP ascites-NK cells ( n = 3–7) (white bars) and expanded HD PB- ( n = 2–3), OCP PB- ( n = 3–4) and OCP ascites-NK cells ( n = 3–7) (black bars). A one-way ANOVA was used to compare surface expression among resting NK cell groups and a two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test was performed to compare resting and expanded NK cells from the same source (i.e. resting HD PB-NK cells as compared to expanded HD PB-NK cells) (* P ≤ 0.05; ** P ≤ 0.01; *** P ≤ 0.001, **** P ≤ 0.0001)
Ex vivo expansion upregulates the surface expression of activating NK cell markers in expanded HD PB-, OCP PB- and OCP ascites-NK cells
Since the aAPC-based expansion method is known to activate NK cells, we also assessed the surface marker expression of activating (Fig. 3 a–f), maturity (Fig. 3 g–i) and inhibitory (Fig. 3 j–l) markers on expanded NK cells [ , ]. Although the expression of activating, maturity and inhibitory surface markers were altered in resting OCP ascites-NK cells, there were no significant differences in surface marker expression among expanded NK cell groups, with the exception of inhibitory marker CD158a, which was significantly increased among HD PB-NK cells in comparison to the other NK cell groups (Fig. 3 k). There were also no significant differences in the median fluorescence intensity of the markers analyzed between expanded NK cell groups (Supplementary Fig. 2).
The aAPC-based expansion however, significantly increased the number of expanded NK cells that expressed activating markers CD69, NKG2D, NKp30 and NKp44 in all groups, in comparison to their phenotype before expansion (Fig. 3 b–e). There was also a trend towards the restoration of cells that expressed activating marker CD16 and maturity marker CD11b in expanded, as compared to resting OCP ascites-NK cells, rendering expanded OCP ascites-NK cells phenotypically similar to expanded PB-NK cells (Fig. 3 a, h).
Expanded OCP ascites-NK cells are responsive to combined stimulation with IL-12/IL-15/IL-18 and produce robust amounts of anti-tumour cytokines in the presence of OC cells
Although there was a shift towards an activated NK cell phenotype upon ex vivo expansion across the NK cell groups, it was important to determine their anti-tumour capabilities through functional assays. Since NK cells are known potent producers of anti-tumour, proinflammatory cytokines upon activation with dendritic cell or macrophage-derived cytokines IL-12, IL-15 and IL-18, we sought to evaluate the ability of expanded NK cells to produce IFN-γ and TNF-α following cytokine stimulation [ , ]. Expanded HD PB-, OCP PB- or OCP ascites-NK cells produced high levels of IFN-γ and TNF-α upon cytokine stimulation (Fig. 4 a, b). Moreover, there were no significant differences in cytokine production among the NK cell groups, indicating that expanded OCP ascites-NK cells have comparable anti-tumour cytokine production as expanded PB-NK cells.
Fig. 4 Expanded healthy donor (HD) peripheral blood (PB)-, ovarian cancer patient (OCP) PB- and OCP ascites-NK cells are functionally responsive to cytokine stimulation and produce IFN-γ, TNF-α and VEGF upon interaction with ovarian cancer cells. At 24-h post-cytokine stimulation, supernatants were assayed for levels of a IFN-γ (HD PB-NK cells, n = 4; OCP PB-NK cells, n = 3; OCP ascites-NK cells, n = 4) and b TNF-α (HD PB-NK cells, n = 3; OCP PB-NK cells, n = 3; OCP ascites-NK cells, n = 3). Statistical analysis was performed using a one-way ANOVA. Supernatants were collected from wells containing OVCAR-8 cells with expanded PB-NK cells ( n = 2) or ascites-NK cells ( n = 3) or from PB-NK cells ( n = 2) and ascites-NK cells ( n = 3) only. Supernatants were assayed for levels of c IFN-γ, d TNF-α and e VEGF. A two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test was used to compare cytokine production between wells with OVCAR-8 and NK cells from their respective control wells (i.e. NK cells only) and between PB- or ascites-NK cells (* P ≤ 0.05; ** P ≤ 0.01)
We also sought to address whether expanded NK cells were able to produce cytokines upon interaction with OC cells. Our results indicate that expanded OCP ascites-NK cells have a significantly increased production of IFN-γ and TNF-α upon incubation with OVCAR-8 cells and that there was no significant difference in proinflammatory cytokine production as compared to PB-NK cells (Fig. 4 c, d). However, there was an increase in pro-angiogenic VEGF production when expanded ascites-NK cells were stimulated with OVCAR-8 cells, as compared to the media control (Fig. 4 e). Additionally, VEGF production was significantly increased in wells containing both ascites-NK cells with OVCAR-8, as compared to PB-NK cells with OVCAR-8.
Expanded OCP ascites-NK cells exhibit cytotoxicity towards an ovarian cancer cell line, OVCAR-8
Resting OCP ascites-NK cells have been documented to exhibit impaired cytotoxicity; therefore, we also sought to test the cytotoxicity of expanded OCP NK cells through flow cytometry-based cytotoxicity assays (Fig. 5 ) [ , , , , , ]. We CFSE-labeled a representative OC cell line, OVCAR-8, to assess differences in cytotoxicity among the NK cell groups, by identifying lysed OVCAR-8 cells as CFSE + , viability dye + cells (Fig. 5 a) [ , ]. Expanded OCP ascites-NK cells demonstrated similar levels of cytotoxicity towards OVCAR-8 cells, in comparison to expanded HD PB- and OCP PB-NK cells, at all effector:target (E:T) ratios (Fig. 5 b). OCP ascites-NK cells also significantly upregulated the CD107a degranulation marker in the presence of OVCAR-8 cells, without a significant difference in degranulation between PB- and ascites-NK cells (Fig. 5 c).

Statistical analysis was performed using a one-way ANOVA. c Percentage of CD107a-expressing NK cells. A two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test was used to compare CD107a expression between wells with OVCAR-8 and NK cells from NK cells only and between PB- and ascites-NK cells. d Percentage-specific lysis of CFSE-labelled OVCAR-8 cells by expanded NK cells that were incubated in ascites supernatant for 72 h
Additionally, since the OC microenvironment can impair NK cell effector function, we analyzed NK cell cytotoxicity after incubation with OCP ascites supernatant. We found that expanded NK cell cytotoxicity was unaffected after 72 h of incubation in ascites supernatant (Fig. 5 d). Overall, these results show that expanded PB- and OCP ascites-NK cells have similar and potent cytotoxic capacity.
Expanded OCP PB- and OCP ascites-NK cells demonstrate cytotoxicity towards autologous primary OC cells in a dose-dependent manner
Next, we sought to assess whether expanded OCP ascites-NK cells could be used in a form of autologous NK cell immunotherapy by evaluating the cytolytic abilities of OCP PB- and OCP ascites-NK cells against primary, heterogeneous OC cells derived from the same (autologous) patient. Dead tumour cells were identified as CD45 − , EpCAM-1 + and viability dye + (Fig. 6 a). Primary OC cells differed in their susceptibility to autologous NK cell-mediated lysis. At a 10:1 E:T ratio, expanded NK cells demonstrated variable killing as the mean percentage-specific lysis achieved by expanded OCP PB- and OCP ascites-NK cells against autologous patient-derived cancer cells ranged from 0 to 73 and 15–54%, respectively (Fig. 6 b–f). There were no differences in cytotoxicity against autologous primary tumour cells between expanded OCP PB- and OCP ascites-NK cells (Fig. 6 g).
Fig. 6 Both expanded ovarian cancer patient (OCP) peripheral blood (PB)- and ascites-NK cells display similar levels of cytotoxicity against autologous primary ovarian cancer (OC) cells. a Gating strategy of the cytotoxicity assay to identify dead tumour cells. b – f Autologous cytotoxicity assays of expanded OCP PB- or ascites-NK cells co-incubated with autologous tumour cells from five different patient donors. g Cytotoxicity between expanded OCP PB- and ascites-NK cells co-incubated with autologous ascites-derived tumour cells. h, i Compares the cytotoxicity of OCP PB- and ascites-NK cells expanded from autologous or allogeneic donors against ascites-derived tumour cells. Statistical analysis was performed using a two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test
We then examined expanded OCP PB- and OCP ascites-NK cell cytotoxicity against patients’ own primary tumour cells (autologous) as well as another patient’s OC cells (allogeneic) (Fig. 6 h, i). There were no significant differences in lysis between autologous and allogeneic OCP PB- or OCP ascites-NK cells against primary tumour cells. Overall, increasing the NK cell to tumour cell ratio achieved increases in tumour cell lysis.
Discussion
Our group is the first to employ a well-established aAPC-based ex vivo expansion technique to modify phenotypically-altered and functionally-impaired NK cells that were obtained from the tumour environment of OCPs. From this approach, we obtained clinically relevant quantities of cytotoxic expanded NK cells that could be applied as a potential treatment for OC in the form of autologous NK cell immunotherapy (Fig. 1 ). We investigated the therapeutic potential of expanded OCP PB- and OCP ascites-NK cells by examining their expression of activating, maturity and inhibitory markers (Fig. 3 ), cytokine production following stimulation (Fig. 4 ), as well as their in vitro cytotoxicity against autologous, ascites-derived primary OC cells (Fig. 6 ). Our results indicate that a log-scale expansion of therapeutic NK cells can be generated from the malignant ascites of OCPs and that these expanded NK cells demonstrate an activated phenotype and cytolytic activity against autologous OC cells.
While there was a larger variation in the range of total fold expansion among OCP ascites-NK cells (particularly in the early stages of expansion) as compared to OCP PB-NK cells (Fig. 1 a), this may be attributed to the presence of primary OC cells in the mononuclear cell population that was used in the aAPC-based expansion process. Since cancer cells are known to secrete cytokines that can affect the proliferation or cytolytic activity of lymphocytes, this may have impacted the early expansion of OCP ascites-NK cells among patients due to the heterogeneity and immunosuppressive properties of primary tumours [ , , , , , , ]. Nonetheless, there were no significant differences in mean total fold expansion between OCP PB- and OCP ascites-NK cells, which indicates the aAPC-based expansion protocol is effective in inducing similar levels of proliferation among functionally-impaired OCP ascites-NK cells, even in the presence of OC cells (Fig. 1 a).
Not only does aAPC-based expansion induce the massive proliferation of NK cells, it also activates them in the process. Our findings indicate that the initially reduced highly cytolytic CD56 dim CD16 + NK cells in resting OCP ascites-NK cells (Fig. 2 a) is augmented after ex vivo expansion by the shift towards a cytotoxic CD56 bright CD16 + phenotype (Fig. 2 b). It is thought that CD56 bright CD16 − NK cells are immature NK cell precursors, relative to CD56 dim CD16 + NK cells, which represent a more mature and cytotoxic NK cell subset. The CD56 bright CD16 + NK cell phenotype present after ex vivo expansion were found to represent a functional intermediate subset that is fully capable of inducing direct tumour cell lysis and antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity [ ]. Therefore, the ex vivo expansion process is capable of generating cytotoxic NK cells from previously impaired OCP ascites-NK cells.
It has been documented that an increased presence of NK cells in OCP ascites is linked to a poorer prognosis [ ]—evidence that would refute the strategy behind adoptively transferring high numbers of NK cells into cancer patients to reduce tumour burden. Our results however, show that this is not the case for ex vivo-expanded OCP ascites-NK cells as they are cytotoxic towards primary OC cells and higher E:T ratios increase OC cell death (Fig. 6 b–f). These findings ultimately demonstrate that previously impaired resting OCP ascites-NK cells have restored effector function as they have similar cytotoxicity and degranulation abilities towards OC cells in comparison to HD and OCP PB-NK cells (Figs. 5 , 6 ). The cytotoxicity observed in expanded OCP ascites-NK cells may be attributed to the upregulation of certain activating receptors including NKG2D, NKp30 and NKp44 induced by aAPC-based expansion (Fig. 3 c–e) [ , , , , ].
Our results suggest OCP ascites-NK cells may retain their effector function after transfer into an immunoregulatory tumour microenvironment since their proinflammatory cytokine production (Fig. 4 c, d) and cytolytic function (Fig. 5 d) was not compromised after incubation with OC cells or ascites supernatant, respectively. Although ascites-NK cells had a marked increase in pro-angiogenic VEGF production after incubation with OC cells in comparison to PB-NK cells, it is unclear whether this was due to the NK cells or OC cells, since both produce VEGF on their own (Fig. 4 e). Additionally, the increased production of VEGF did not appear to affect expanded OCP ascites-NK cell cytotoxicity since cytolytic function was similar among all NK cell groups (Fig. 5 b).
Although previous studies have identified the advantages of employing allogeneic NK cells, our results also indicate there were no significant differences between autologous and allogeneic NK cell cytotoxicity (Fig. 6 h, i) [ , ]. We speculate that autologous and allogeneic NK cells have comparable levels of cytotoxicity due to the potent stimulation induced by the ex vivo aAPC-based expansion method, which may overcome the inhibitory effects of autologous NK cells and overshadow the enhanced cytolytic effects of killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor-mismatched allogeneic NK cells [ , , , ].
We report a wide variation in primary OC cell susceptibly to NK cell lysis among individual OCPs (Fig. 6 b–f). This may be attributed to the heterogeneity of the primary OC cells among patients and not the expanded NK cells themselves, particularly since expanded NK cells from all donor groups displayed comparable levels of cytotoxicity against the homogenous OVCAR-8 cell line (Fig. 5 b). Additionally, since the OCPs in this study received multiple lines of chemotherapy by the time of ascites collection, varying levels of chemoresistance between tumour samples may have impacted the levels of specific lysis observed. Studies have shown that chemoresistant tumours can release soluble factors and undergo transformative processes to selectively impair NK cell function [ , , , , ]. Nonetheless, we have shown that expanded OCP PB- and OCP ascites-NK cells demonstrated killing towards chemoresistant, recurrent OC, attesting to their efficacy as a second-line treatment.
In summary, our findings indicate that expanded OCP ascites-NK cells are just as cytotoxic as expanded HD and OCP PB-NK cells. The ability to induce an activated and cytotoxic phenotype in previously impaired OCP ascites-NK cells has several implications for autologous NK cell immunotherapy for OC. Since we have shown it is possible to activate NK cells from the tumour environment of OCPs in an ex vivo fashion, it is of interest to investigate the efficacy of delivering NK cell expansion factors in an in situ, intraperitoneal fashion. This could allow for the expansion and activation of endogenous OCP ascites-NK cells that may be promoting, instead of hindering, tumour growth.
The ability to modulate and activate endogenous NK cells in the tumour environment has several clinical advantages as compared to the current intravenous approaches of adoptive NK cell immunotherapy. An intraperitoneal method of NK cell infusion would allow for a more concentrated and targeted therapeutic delivery [ ]. This would negate the need for systemic cytokine administration and its associated adverse toxicities, decrease the challenge of NK cell homing to distant tumour sites and directly modulate lymphocyte effector function in the tumour environment [ , , , , ]. Overall, our results support the aAPC-mediated activation and expansion of OCP ascites-NK cells for autologous NK cell immunotherapy to treat OC. Future work should elucidate the in vivo effectiveness of autologous NK cell immunotherapy using xenograft mouse models of human OC.
