Introduction
Ovarian cancer is found to be the seventh most common cancer among women, accounting for 3.4% of all gynaecological cancers [ ]. According to the Globocan statistics, 36,170 new cases of ovarian cancer were registered in India in 2018 and an estimate of 24,015 deaths due to ovarian cancer were reported in the National Cancer Registry. Ovarian cancer was found to be the third most common cancer among Indian women, corresponding to 6.2% of all cancers among women [ ]. Thus, India is facing a challenge of increasing incidence of ovarian cancer, further compounded by its late detection, which in turn results in an adverse impact in terms of rising health-care costs and mortality associated with this disease. The economic burden of cancer care and treatment is highest compared to all other diseases, with the cost of a single hospitalization exceeding the average annual per capita expenditure of more than 60% of the population [ ].
Until lately it was believed that due to the absence of symptoms in early stages, women with ovarian cancer presented late in advanced stage amounting to high mortality rates associated with the disease. However, recent studies reported that a significant number of women with ovarian cancer present with the symptoms of the disease in both early and late stages, but owing to the non-specific nature of these symptoms they are attributed to causes other than ovarian cancer either by these women themselves or by their treating physicians, thus resulting in delayed diagnosis of the disease [ ]. These symptoms include persistent abdominal distension (often described as bloating of abdomen), pelvic or abdominal pain, early satiety, loss of appetite, nausea, constipation, increased frequency or urgency of urination and weight loss [ ]. According to the NICE Guidelines (2017), if any woman, especially over 50 years of age, presents with the above symptoms on a persistent and frequent basis, specifically more than 12 times in a month, then special tests have to be carried out in such a woman to rule out ovarian cancer [ ]. The prognosis of ovarian cancer significantly depends on the stage of the disease at the time of diagnosis. The 5-year survival rate of ovarian cancer varies from as high as 92% in early-stage disease to a low of 30% in advanced-stage disease [ ]. Thus, if these symptoms are detected and investigated promptly, it will help in early diagnosis and management of ovarian cancer, thus yielding a better prognosis, improving the morbidity and reducing mortality associated with the disease.
The risk factors for development of ovarian cancer include advancing age, family history of ovarian, breast and colorectal cancer, obesity, use of hormone replacement therapy, infertility and having received treatment for infertility, nulliparity, late onset of menopause, endometriosis, smoking, use of talcum powder in the genital area, etc. [ ].
Studies across the world reveal that there is poor awareness among women regarding the symptoms and risk factors for ovarian cancer [ , , , ]. Thus, due to the absence of an effective screening programme for ovarian cancer, lack of adequate knowledge about the risk factors, symptoms and clinical implications of delayed detection of the disease, there are high morbidity and mortality associated with diagnosis of advanced stages of ovarian cancer. Interventional studies have shown that implementation of health education of ovarian cancer can cause a remarkable improvement in the level of knowledge of the disease and thus help in early detection and management of the disease till effective screening methods are developed.
Unfortunately, during the extensive literature search, there was a paucity of data on knowledge of ovarian cancer research in India. Thus, the present study was undertaken to assess the knowledge of ovarian cancer, its risk factors, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis among women of reproductive-age group admitted in all the Obstetrics and Gynaecology (OBG) wards of Goa Medical College during the study period.
Methods
This was a hospital-based cross-sectional study conducted in the Department of OBG, Goa Medical College (GMC), Bambolim, Goa, between December 2018 to February 2019 after obtaining the Institutional Ethics Committee approval. Goa Medical College is the only tertiary care government hospital in Goa and is the main referral hospital for all Government and private hospitals in the State. The study participants included all women over 20 years of age admitted in all the OBG wards (Ward 126, 127, 128, 129 and 130) of Goa Medical College during the study period. An informed consent was obtained from all the study participants.
The exclusion criteria included: Women diagnosed with any malignancy or premalignant conditions and being treated for the same. Women admitted in labour rooms and eclampsia rooms. Women admitted with serious illness requiring intensive care. Women with psychiatric illness. Women who declined consent.
A total of 426 women admitted in all the OBG wards fulfilling the inclusion criteria and who consented to participate, were interviewed with a structured questionnaire in " Appendix " section. Their socio-demographic characteristics were recorded. After completion of the interview, health education was imparted to the study participants regarding ovarian cancer using pictorial diagrams, and their queries on the same were answered by the researchers. At the end of the study, all the completed questionnaires were assessed and the responses of the participants were scored. The responses of the study participants were scored as 1 for correct responses, 0 for no response (don’t know) and 1 point was subtracted for every incorrect response. These scores were added up, and percentages of total obtainable points were calculated. A total score of more than 70% was considered as good level of awareness, 50–69% was considered as fair level of awareness, and a score of < 50% indicated poor level of awareness of ovarian cancer. The data were analysed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20.0. Association between the socio-demographic characteristics and awareness of ovarian cancer, risk factors, symptoms, treatment and prognosis was studied. A p value of < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
Results
The study participants included a total of 426 women between 20 and 50 years of age who were indoor patients in OBG wards at Goa Medical College (GMC).
Majority of the study participants were aged below 40 years (84.5%), the mean age being 36 years. Most of the women (90.1%) were married. 76% of the study participants were Hindus, while 14.1% were Muslims and 9.9% were Christians. A significant number of women interviewed had at least secondary education (81.6%). 29.5% of the study participants had higher secondary education, and 26.8% were graduates. 80.3% of the women interviewed were homemakers, 11.3% women were skilled workers, 1.4% were semi-skilled, 5.6% were unskilled workers, and only 1.4% were professionals. 78.9% of the study participants were above socio-economic class III, 18.3% belonged to class IV, and 2.8% were class V. 40.8% of women interviewed were from urban areas, while 59.2% were from rural areas.
As seen in Fig. 1 , among the 426 women interviewed, Only 151 women (35.4%) had ever heard of ovarian cancer. Only 15 women (3.5%) had good level of awareness, while 57 women (13.4%) had fair level of awareness of ovarian cancer. However, the majority of them, i.e. 354 women (83.1%), had poor level of awareness of ovarian cancer. Fig. 1 Distribution of women as per their level of awareness of ovarian cancer
Similarly, a survey conducted by Freij et al. among Jordanian women [ ] and community-based assessment of women done by Odukogbe et al. in Ibadan, Nigeria [ ], showed low level of awareness of ovarian cancer: its symptoms, risk factors and treatment. Another similar study done in Lagos, Nigeria [ ], showed that majority of the women interviewed (67%) were unaware of ovarian cancer.
As seen in Table 1 , there was a significant association between level of awareness of ovarian cancer and certain socio-demographic characteristics of the study participants. Increasing age, skilled occupation and higher level of education were found to be significantly associated with good level of awareness of ovarian cancer ( p 0.0000, p 0.0000 and p 0.0115, respectively). Women belonging to higher socio-economic class and from urban areas had better awareness of ovarian cancer ( p 0.0000).

Odukogbe et al. in Ibadan also demonstrated that women with higher levels of education and higher occupation skill levels and women from urban areas had good level of awareness of ovarian cancer [ ]. Similarly, Okunowo et al. [ ] also revealed that women in Lagos, Nigeria, with increasing age, skilled occupation and higher educational status were associated with good level of awareness of ovarian cancer. However, we observed that marital status and religion did not significantly influence the level of awareness of ovarian cancer among these women, which was also observed in other studies [ , ].
This significant association of awareness of ovarian cancer with the above socio-demographic characteristics may probably be due to increased accessibility to mass media and accessibility to tertiary care centres in urban areas and those belonging to a higher socio-economic status. Although most of the study participants had at least secondary education (81.6%) and a higher socio-economic status, the study results showed poor level of awareness of ovarian cancer in 83.1% of the study population. This is due to lack of health education and awareness programmes of ovarian cancer.
Among the 426 study participants, 270 women (63.4%) had poor or no knowledge (63.4%), 84 (19.7%) had fair knowledge, while 72 (16.9%) had good knowledge about ovaries and their function. Odukogbe et al. in Ibadan also found that only 23% of the women interviewed in his study had good knowledge about ovaries and their functions, while 59% had poor knowledge [ ].
As seen in Table 2 , the commonest symptoms of ovarian cancer identified by the study participants were abdominal pain (71.8%), pain in pelvis (64.7%), increasing abdominal size (60.6%), fatigue (53.5%) and loss of appetite (47.9%). Only 60 (14.1%) women interviewed had good level of awareness of symptoms of ovarian cancer, while majority of them, i.e. 288 (67.6%), had poor knowledge of symptoms of the disease. Similar results were observed by Odukogbe et al. in Ibadan, wherein 21% of the study population had good level of awareness of symptoms of ovarian cancer, while 62% had poor level of awareness of the symptoms of the disease [ ], the commonest symptoms identified being abdominal swelling, whereas women in Lagos identified unexplained weight loss (43.8%) and persistent abdominal pain (31.8%) as the commonest symptoms of ovarian cancer [ ]. Freij et al. [ ] from Jordan also found low level of awareness of symptoms of ovarian cancer with the three highest recognized symptoms being extreme fatigue (43.2%), back pain (42.4%) and persistent pain in pelvic region (40.7%). Table 2 Distribution of symptoms of ovarian cancer identified by the study participants Symptoms Frequency (no.) Percentage (%) a. Persistent pain in the abdomen 306 71.8 b. Persistent pain in pelvis 276 64.7 c. Persistent bloating 150 35.2 d. Increase in abdominal size on most of the days 258 60.6 e. Feeling persistently full 126 29.6 f. Loss of appetite 204 47.9 g. Passing more urine than usual 114 26.8 h. Changes in bowel habits 96 22.5 i. Extreme fatigue 228 53.5 j. Back pain 180 42.3
Only 2.8% of the study participants had good level of awareness of risk factors for ovarian cancer, whereas majority (84.5%) had poor level of awareness of the risk factors for this disease. As seen in Table 3 , the commonest risk factors identified by the respondents were family history of ovarian cancer (67.6%), being a smoker (53.3%) and advanced age (49.3%). 66.2% women opined that a woman aged above 40 years is most likely to develop ovarian cancer in the next one year, whereas one-third of the women (33.8%) reported incorrect knowledge that women aged < 40 years are more susceptible to develop ovarian cancer. Table 3 Distribution of risk factors for ovarian cancer identified by the study participants Risk factors Frequency (no.) Percentage (%) a. Having a close relative with ovarian cancer 288 67.6 b.

The study among Jordanian women showed that the most commonly identified risk factor was smoking (68.4%) and having an ovarian cyst (59.7%) [ ], while in another similar study Malaysian women identified increasing age (74.7%) and family history of breast and ovarian cancer (64.4%) as the most common risk factors for ovarian cancer [ ]. The present study revealed that the study participants had better level of awareness of the symptoms of ovarian cancer than its risk factors which was consistent with the results of other studies [ ]. The probable reason for this finding may be because the awareness of risk factors for any disease requires more specific and profound knowledge about the disease, while its symptoms are commonly the first information acquired regarding the disease.
In our study, 342 women (80.3%) thought that ovarian cancer can be treated. Among these women, only 18.3% had good level of awareness of diagnosis, management and prognosis of ovarian cancer, while most of them (43.7%) had poor level of awareness of this. 19.7% of the women felt there is no treatment available for ovarian cancer. Only 72 women (16.9%) were aware of CA 125 and its utility in diagnosis of ovarian cancer. 63.4% women were aware that ultrasonography can help in screening and diagnosing ovarian cancer. Eighty-four women (19.7%) had a misconception that Pap smear can be used for diagnosis and screening of ovarian cancer. Figure 2 shows the distribution of treatment options of ovarian cancer identified by the respondents. Out of the 342 women that were aware of treatment about ovarian cancer, majority (33.8%) knew that both surgery and chemotherapy are required for treatment for ovarian cancer. A study on women in Ibadan, Nigeria, revealed similar findings, with 27% of them demonstrating good level of awareness of the treatment options and prognosis of ovarian cancer as opposed to 40% women with poor level of awareness of this aspect of the disease [ ]. Fig. 2 Distribution of treatment options of ovarian cancer identified by the study participants
69% women opined that the 5-year survival rate is more than 70% in early stages of ovarian cancer, and 80.3% were of the opinion that the survival rate is less than 20% in advanced stages of the disease.
This suggests that majority of the women in our study being educated were aware that if any cancer is diagnosed early, it has better prognosis. However, due to lack of awareness programmes and health education on ovarian cancer, they had poor level of awareness of its treatment options.
As seen in Fig. 3 , the commonest source of information of ovarian cancer was family and friends (49%), whereas medical professionals (family doctor and health workers) constituted only 18%. However, a study done in Ibadan revealed that the commonest source of information regarding ovarian cancer among the women was mass media (40.6%), followed by health workers (27.3%) and family and friends (14.8%) [ ]. Another study in Lagos, Nigeria, showed the most common sources of knowledge among respondents who were aware of ovarian cancer are television/radio (33.3%), social media/ internet (28.2%), newspapers (16.3%), doctors/nurses (16.7%) and friends and family (16.3%) [ ].

Thus, we found a higher percentage of women with poor level of awareness of ovarian cancer, its symptoms, risk factors, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of the disease and also having misconceptions regarding the disease (e. g. “ovarian cancer cannot be treated”, “Pap smear can be used for diagnosing ovarian cancer”). We observed that there is an urgent need to implement sustainable programmes for awareness and education of women and young girls of ovarian cancer in schools, workplaces and through health centres. Mass media and social media campaigns on awareness of ovarian cancer should also be conducted regularly.
Conclusion
Our study findings suggest that most women in Goa have poor level of awareness of ovaries, ovarian cancer symptoms, risk factors, treatment options and its prognosis. The respondent’s age, level of education, occupational skill level, level of development and socio-economic status were the most important determinants of their level of knowledge about ovarian cancer. As ovarian cancer has high morbidity and mortality associated with it due to its diagnosis in advanced stages, owing to lack of effective screening tool unlike other cancers in females (e. g. breast cancer, cervical cancer), health education is the only measure which can empower women in our country to identify the warning signs of ovarian cancer and seek early medical help and prompt treatment, which in turn will lead to reduction in the morbidity and mortality associated with ovarian cancer, besides health-care costs.
