INTRODUCTION
The transungual delivery system has recently been used as an alternative route for drug delivery ( ), especially in nail diseases such as onychomycosis or psoriasis. Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the fingernail or toenails ( , , ). It is characterized by discoloration and increasing thickness of the nail plate ( ). As the infection progresses, the nail plate becomes brittle and separation of the nail plate from the nail bed may occur.
Candida and nondermatophytic molds are responsible for onychomycosis in a moderate climate, while dermatophytes are the reason in a hot and humid climate ( , ). Oral antifungal dosage forms are characterized by systemic side effects and drug interactions. On the other hand, topical preparations are limited by the low permeation rate of the drug through the highly keratinized nail plate. The drug must permeate to the deeper layer of the nail (nail matrix and nail bed) to ensure the successful treatment of onychomycosis. Studies conducted on the human nail are very little. The enhancement of the drug permeation through the nail plate is an important factor for the treatment of the topical nail diseases and increased the possibility of reaching the nail bed. Many factors can affect the drug transport into the nail plate, including the physicochemical properties of the drug molecule ( e.g. , size, shape, charge, hydrophilicity), the formulation characteristic ( e.g. , nature of vehicle, pH, drug concentration), the presence of any penetration enhancers, nail properties (thickness, hydration) as well as interaction between the permeating molecule and keratin network of the nail plate. The presence of permeation enhancer is a very crucial factor that affects the penetration of the drug through the keratin barrier. Therefore, screening of permeation enhancers and investigation of their effect on the hydration, swelling properties, and morphology of the nail as well as their ability to facilitate the drug permeation are very important experiments for the selection of the suitable permeation enhancer to be incorporated in the transungual delivery system. Nail lacquer is the most convenient topical preparation nowadays for the treatment of onychomycosis. Previous studies revealed that the formulation of antifungal drugs in nail lacquer gave better clinical results for the treatment of nail infection than the other dosage form including lotions and solutions. Lotions and solutions have limited efficacy because they are easily washable during daily use and therefore do not remain long enough on the nail for successful drug permeation ( , , , ).
Moreover, the lacquer provides a fixed film on the nail which is resistant to water and detergents ( , , , , ). This film also acts as a reservoir of the drug and facilitates its penetration during the day due to the high concentration of the drug upon film drying and the prolonged contact time with nail plates ( , , ).
CPX is present in the market as lacquer or solutions for topical treatment of onychomycosis; data from previous trials provided evidence that CPX had poor cure rates and it needed to be applied daily for prolonged periods (at least 1 year) to be effective ( ). Most of the CPX lacquers in the market are composed of an alcoholic solution of CPX with film former polymers and other excipients, but they do not contain any permeation enhancer.
The aim of the work was to develop and optimize a new CPX nail lacquer by using nonbiodegradable E-RLPO as a film former. The lacquer dosage form provides a medicated film that adheres to the nail plate and facilitates the penetration of the drug through the nail plate by prolonged contact and by using penetration enhancers ( ). A screening experiment for different permeation enhancers such as hydration enhancement factor and the retained amount of drug in the nail was conducted to select the effective enhancer to be incorporated in the optimized lacquer formulation. Ex vivo permeability experiments for the optimum CPX lacquer formulation compared to a marketed CPX lacquer were performed. The effect of other excipients such as solubilizing agent and plasticizer on the physical properties of the lacquer was also investigated.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Ciclopirox powder was obtained from Sigma Company, USA; Eudragit RLPO (E-RLPO) from Röhm GMbH Chemische Fabrik, Kirschenellee, D-64293 Darmstadt, Germany; acetyl cysteine, L-cysteine, and carbocysteine from SigmaChemical, USA; Tween 80, thiourea, and urea from Adwic, Egypt; and papain from Pharaonia, Egypt. All other chemicals were of analytical grade.
METHODOLOGY
Screening of Permeation Enhancer
Preparation of Human Nails
Fingernail clippings used for this experiment were obtained from human nails of healthy volunteers (length of 10 mm ± 0.3, width of 3 mm ± 0.2, thickness of 0.3 mm ± 0.02). Nail clippings were washed with distilled water, then cleaned, wiped with tissue paper, dried, and stored at 25 ± 2°C in a glass bottle till use.
Hydration Enhancement Factor (HEF)
This test was performed to show the effect of different permeation enhancers namely urea, thiourea, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (AC), carbocysteine (CC), L-cysteine, water, papain, as well as a combination of urea and N-acetyl-L-cysteine on the physicochemical properties of the nail plates (hydration and swelling). In a glass vial, pre-weighed nail clippings were immersed in 1 ml of a vehicle containing 5% of each permeation enhancer. Other weighed nail clippings were immersed in 1 ml of the vehicle without enhancer and served as a control.
Each vehicle is composed of 1 ml of isopropanol:acetone mixture (60:40) in which CPX (8 mg) was dissolved. The glass vials were closed tightly and maintained at 32°C for 24 h. After that, the nail clippings were removed from the glass vials, wiped with tissue paper, and reweighed. HEF was calculated using the following equation: HEF = X 1 / X 2 , where HEF is the hydration enhancement factor, X 1 = % weight gain of nail clipping soaked in a vehicle containing permeation enhancer, and X 2 = % weight gain of nail clipping soaked in a vehicle without enhancers (control). The best permeation enhancer is the one of the highest HEF ( ).
CPX Retained in Nail Clippings
At the end of the HEF study, the nail clippings were crushed to determine the accumulated CPX in the nail plate. The nail crushing was done manually, where the nails were cooled at −80°C and then stricken with a hammer to convert the nail clippings to small fragments. These fragments were soaked in methanol in order to extract CPX from the nails and shook for 24 h followed by centrifugation for 30 min at 7000 rpm. The drug content in the supernatants was measured using validated HPLC. The HLPC condition was as follows: mobile phase (phosphate buffer pH 3:acetonitrile 1:1), flow rate of 1.5 ml/min, wavelength of 304 nm, and Hypersil column c 18 150 × 4.6 mm). The percentage amount of CPX retained in the nail plate was calculated as mass per gram of nail clippings ( ).
Effect of Permeation Enhancer on Nail Morphology
The influence of permeation enhancer on nail morphology was investigated using scanning electron microscopy. A nail clipping was immersed in 1 ml of the lacquer vehicle without the permeation enhancer for 24 h and another nail clipping was immersed in 1 ml of the vehicle containing the selected permeation enhancer for 24 h. After that, the nails were dried using tissue paper, covered with a gold sputter, and examined using SEM (QUANTA FEG 250 SCM, FEI Quanta series, USA).
The Experimental Design
A 3 3 full factorial design was built to study the effect of three independent variables, namely the polymer concentrations at three levels (10, 20, and 30% of total formula weight), Tween 80 concentrations at three levels (0.25, 0.5, and 1% of total formula weight), and triacetin concentrations at three levels (0, 10, and 30% of polymer weight). The studied responses were the drying time, water resistance, viscosity, and the release up to 4 h. The experimental data were statistically analyzed using MINITAB software for Windows. One-way ANOVA was carried out and the main effects were estimated.
Preparation of CPX Nail Lacquers
The lacquer was prepared by dissolving the mentioned amount of Eudragit RLPO (10, 20, or 30% w / w ), Tween 80 (0.25, 0.5, and 1% w / w ), and triacetin (0, 10, and 30% w / w ) in a solvent mixture of (isopropanol:acetone (60:40)) using a magnetic stirrer. After the dissolution of the polymer, a fixed concentration of CPX (8% w / w ) was added to each formula. The mixture was stirred at 1000 rpm for 30 min till getting a homogeneous solution. To each formula solution, 5% papain (the selected enhancer) was incorporated and stirred for another 30 min. A total of 27 lacquer formulae were prepared and stored until evaluation.
PHYSICOCHEMICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF CPX LACQUER
Compatibility Study
FT-IR was performed to estimate the possible existing physical interactions between CPX and E-RLPO polymer. The compatibility study was carried out using an IR spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan) by scanning from 4000 to 400 cm −1 . Peaks’ matching was done to identify any possible interactions between the drug and the polymer.
Application and Gloss
This visual observation test aimed to check the evenness and smoothness of brushing, with particular attention to air bubbles and streaking in the film ( , ).
Nonvolatile Content
An accurately weighed amount of lacquer (1 g) was poured into a petri dish of diameter 8 cm then spread evenly. The perti dish was put in the oven at 105°C for 1 h, and then it was removed, allowed to cool, and weighed. The difference in weight was estimated ( ).
Blush Test
A blush test was performed to investigate any rankles or peeling off of the nail lacquer film upon contacting with water. 0.5 ml of the lacquer was spread uniformly over a glass slide and left to dry to get a film. This glass slide containing the dried film was immersed in water for 24 h. The slide was removed, dried with tissue paper, and left for a further 2 h at room temperature for complete drying. After that, the plate was inspected for blush ( ).
Smoothness of Flow
A lacquer of 0.1 g was poured on a glass plate and stood vertically to flow. The film should not have foreign matter and coarse particles and should be free of a severe orange-peel effect when seen through a lens ( , ).
Adhesion
0.5 g of lacquer was applied and spread on a marked area 2 × 2 cm 2 on the glass plate using a brush and left to dry for 24 h at ambient temperature. The dried film was divided into squares (100 squares) with a knife, and an adhesive cellophane tape (4 × 4 cm 2 ) was applied to the film. The percentage number of squares removed by the tape was recorded ( , ).
Drying Time
An aliquot of lacquer (0.5 ml) was applied to an area of 3 × 2 cm 2 marked on a completely nonporous glass plate using a brush and left to dry. The time needed to form a dry-to-touch film was determined. Dry-to-touch means the film could be touched without transferring any material to the finger (a clean fingertip) ( , ). The readings were done in triplicate.
Water Resistance
This test used to evaluate the water resistance of the film. A lacquer of 0.1 g was spread evenly on an area of 2 × 3 cm 2 on a glass plate and left to dry at room temperature. The plate containing the dried lacquer was weighed and then immersed in 15 ml distilled water for 24 h. The glass plate was removed, dried by placing the plate between two filter papers, and reweighed. The percentage of weight loss to the original weight of the sample was estimated ( , ).
Rheological Study
Lacquer viscosity was measured using a Brookfield Viscometer (programmable photometer, cone and plate model DVIII, thermostatically controlled water bath). A sample of 0.5 ml was placed on the lower plate of the viscometer. The measurement was done at 25°C, using spindle 40 and shear rate ranging from 50 to 250. Both the shear rate and the viscosity were recorded. The flow index ( n ) and the consistency index ( m ) of each formula were estimated according to the following equation ( ): $$ \eta ={m\gamma}^{n-1} $$
where γ is the shear rate (s −1 ) and η is the viscosity (cps). n = 1 reveals Newtonian behavior while n < 1 reveals thinning flow.
In Vitro Release Study
Adjusted USP dissolution apparatus 5 ( ) for transdermal formula was used to characterize the drug release. A weight of 1 g from each formula (equivalent to 80 mg of CPX) was placed in a watch glass and left to dry in the open air until forming a dry film. This film was covered with a plastic screen which clipped with a plastic holder (modified to paddle over disc method). The watch glass containing the film was placed in the vessel. Each vessel contained 250 ml of phosphate buffer saline (pH 7.4), kept at 32°C ± 0.5 and rotated at rpm of 50 ± 0.2 (23). A sample of 3 ml was withdrawn from the release medium at different intervals (5, 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, and 240 min) and replaced by an equivalent amount of freshly prepared buffer solution kept at 32°C. The drug released from different lacquers was determined using the previously mentioned HPLC method. A correction factor was done after each sampling.
To study the kinetics and mechanism of the drug release from different lacquer formulae, the data obtained from the drug release study were fitted to both Higuchi and Korsmeyer-Peppas equations ( ).
Drug Content
The CPX content of each lacquer formula was determined by dissolving 0.1 g of lacquer (equivalent to 80 mg of CPX) in 100 ml of methanol. One milliliter of this stock solution was diluted with 50 ml of buffered saline solution (pH 7.4). The CPX content was determined using the HPLC method.
EX VIVO NAIL PERMEATION
Nail Permeation Study
The nails were soaked in the permeation media for an hour before the experiment. The nails were fixed from the dorsal side to one end of a plastic cylinder with a diameter of 1 cm and a length of 10 cm using cyanoacrylate adhesive. The cylinder was fixed to the receptor compartment containing 50 ml of PBS, pH 7.4, in which the nail ventral side faced and touched the release media. The whole device was covered completely and located in a thermostatically controlled water bath adjusted at 32 ± 0.5°C (23). An aliquot of the optimized lacquer formulae and a marketed product (Batrafen solution), each containing 8 mg CPX, were placed on the nail through the other end of the plastic cylinder. One milliliter of the medium was withdrawn from the receptor compartment at different time intervals and replaced with fresh media. The samples were measured using the abovementioned HPLC method (20, 21, and 25). The cumulative amount of the permeated drug per unit area across the nail was plotted against time, and the flux represents the slope of the linear portion of the graph.
Investigation of Nail Permeation Using Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy
The selected lacquer formulae were reformulated by replacing the drug with a trace of fluorescent Rhodamine B dye (at concentration 1 μg/ml). The nail clippings were treated as mentioned above and hydrated overnight. The formulation was applied on the surface of the nail using a brush and left for 72 h. After that, the nail was rinsed with ethanol to remove the dried film and washed with distilled water. Transverse sections of the nail(s) were obtained by a microtome (Leica RM-2245, Leica microsystem, D.H.R. holding Pvt. Ltd., Chennai, India) and examined under a ×10 lens using CLSM (Device Model: LSM 710. Software version: ZEN 2009 Carl Zeiss (ZEISS) (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany)). Rhodamine B dye was excited using a laser beam of 485 nm, and the fluorescence emission of the dye was detected at 543 nm ( , ).
Stability Study
The optimized formula was exposed to stability study; briefly, the lacquer formulation was stored in a tight bottle at a temperature of 25°C and 60% RH. The formula was evaluated at 0, 1, and 3 months of storage. The formulation was estimated for the previous physical properties of lacquer such as drying time, in vitro adhesion, water resistance, and blush test, drug content to ensure the stability of the formulation.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Screening of Permeation Enhancers
The hydration enhancement factor (HEF) was established to select the permeation enhancer that will be incorporated in the optimized nail lacquer formula to enhance CPX permeation through the nail. From previous trials, it was noted that nail weight gradually increased up to 20 h; beyond that time, no weight gain was observed indicating the saturation of hydration. Therefore, 24 h was selected as the experimental period for hydration. The HEF was used to evaluate the hydration capacity of each enhancer to nail clippings. Various permeation enhancers alone or in combination with each other (Fig. 1 ) were screened by calculating their HEF. The HEF of different permeation enhancers ranged from 7.09 to 15.27% (Fig. 1 ). The maximum HEF (15.27%) was obtained for clippings soaked in a solution containing 5% papain. The lowest HEF of 7.09% was observed for water. Each permeation enhancer(s) disturbs the nail structure by different mechanisms ( ). Urea and thiourea are softening agents. They hydrate, swell, and soften the nail plate, thus enhancing the drug permeation as the nail plate becomes a less dense structure with larger pores facilitating the diffusion of molecules. Also, it could damage the nail plate surface resulting in a fractured surface which could potentially increase ungual drug uptake as the dorsal barrier is compromised ( ). They also act as a keratolytic agent by unfolding protein, thus solubilizing and denaturalizing keratin. Concomitantly applied drugs could permeate through the damaged barrier. Acetylcysteine, cysteine, and carbocysteine facilitate the permeability of the drug through the nail plate by cleavage of the S–H bond of nail protein. It was reported that urea and acetylcysteine had a synergistic effect when added together since urea unfolds proteins (probably via interaction with their hydrogen bonds) and may thereby facilitate the cleavage of the disulfide linkage by acetylcysteine ( , ). Papain is an endopeptidase enzyme ( ) that hydrolyzes keratin and thus loosens the barrier ( ). Water promotes the diffusion of the water-soluble drug through the nail plate by expanding the keratin network leading to the formation of larger pores. Also, it was reported that the permeation of neat alcohols was enhanced when diluted with water ( , ). Fig. 1 Hydration enhancement factor of different permeation enhancers
The retained amount of CPX in the nail plate was the highest in nails soaked in 5% papain than other enhancers (Fig. 2 ). These results confirmed the data obtained from the HEF test. By increasing the treatment period from 1 day to 3 days, a further increase in the retained amount of the drug in the nail was monitored. This could be attributed to the production of more pores or the enlargement of the existing pores with time. Thus, the drug diffusion improved leading to the increasing of the effective concentration of CPX at the nail matrix and nail plate. Fig. 2 Retained amount of CPX in nail clipping after immersion in different permeation enhancer vehicles for 1 day and 3 days
Figure 3 a represents the surface of the dorsal side and ventral side of the nail clipping immersed in a lacquer vehicle without papain that showed a dense, compact surface with minor features and pores. On the other hand, the nail clipping exposed to papain solution showed a highly irregular, uneven, striated surface, with a large number of wide pores in both dorsal and ventral layers as shown in Fig. 3 b. Increasing the pores on the nail surface increased the chance of drug diffusion through this strong barrier so that a sufficiently effective amount of the drug could be delivered to the nail bed. From the previous result, papain (5%) was selected to be incorporated in the lacquer formulation as a permeation enhancer.

Compatibility Study
FT-IR analysis exhibited no chemical interaction between CPX and E-RLPO. Figure 4 a shows the major peaks of CPX at 1550 and 1640 cm −1 (carbonyl region). RLPO showed peaks at 3432.1 cm −1 (tertiary amine), 1731.4 cm −1 (C=O (ester)), 1450.2 cm −1 (−CH 3 bend), 1174.8 cm −1 (C–O stretch), 1604.1 cm –1 (C=C, aromatic stretch), 1728.6 cm −1 (carboxyl group), and 2960.9 cm −1 for O–H (carboxylic acid) (Fig. 4 b). The physical mixture of CPX and E-RLPO showed the same peaks indicating no interaction (Fig. 4 c). Fig. 4 IR of CPX, E-RLPO, and their physical mixture
Evaluation of the CPX Nail Lacquers
A factorial design experiment was built up to study the combined effect of different factors such as E-RLPO concentrations (10, 20, and 30%), Tween 80 concentrations (0.25, 0.5, and 1%), and triacetin concentrations (0, 10, and 30%) on different physical properties of the lacquer, namely drying time, water resistance, consistency, and release percentage as shown in Table I . E-RLPO polymer was used as a film former. Its solubility is pH independent and has high permeability to water. Tween 80 was used as drug solubilizer. Triacetin is a hydrophilic plasticizer and used in three percentages of the polymer weight (0, 10, and 30% w / w ) ( ). The main use of plasticizers in nail lacquer is to increase the flexibility, elongate the durability of the film, and decrease the brittleness of the film ( ). The ideal plasticizers have zero volatility, so its effect would persist throughout the life of the film ( ). It should be free from color and odor and nontoxic, and have no effect on the chemical stability of the film former polymer. It should impart uniform plasticity to the nail enamel over a large range of temperatures. As well, triacetin has fungistatic properties due to the liberation of acetic acid.

All formulae were clear, colorless, applicable, and smooth for brushing. No air bubbles or streaking was observed in the film. All formulae had good adhesion ( i.e. , no change in the number of squares before and after applying the tape, i.e. , 0% of the number of squares were removed by the tape). These results could be because E-RLPO is freely soluble in the mixtures of organic solvents and forms clear, low-viscosity, and runny solutions. It was noticed that the formulae containing triacetin are glossier than the formulae without. Also, a clear and homogeneous film was formed by adjusting the polymer and plasticizer concentrations in nail lacquer. None of the formulations exhibited blistering or peeling off.
Nonvolatile Content
Nonvolatile content represents the amount of solid content that formed after evaporation of the solvent of the applied lacquer and provides a sufficient dried film that covers the entire nail plate ( ). Nonvolatile content should be not less than 20% w / w to provide that sufficient coverage. The values of nonvolatile content were in the range of 37–57%. Nonvolatile contents were directly proportional to the Eudragit polymer concentration. The highest value was 57.32 ± 0.31% for F27 containing the highest polymer concentration, while the lowest value was 37.22 ± 0.21% for F1 lacquer consisting of the lowest polymer concentration. An increase in the other excipients such as Tween 80 and triacetin with fixing the E-RLPO concentration had a negligible influence on the nonvolatile content.
Drying Time
Drying time is thought to be an important factor for the assessment of nail lacquer and is defined as the time needed to form dry-to-touch film. If the drying time of the lacquer film is very fast, it will lead to a poor flow and fast solidification of the lacquer, resulting in an irregular and stripy film during brush application and thus the formation of the dull film. Also, if the drying time is very slow, the flow of the lacquer will be fast and that reduces its remaining time on the nail plate. Consequently, an ideal drying time of 30–90 s is required ( ). The drying time of all the formulations ranged from 54.7 ± 3.2 to 219.7 ± 2.1 s (Table II ).
The effect of different factors on the drying time of the lacquer is shown in Fig. 5 . It was found that increasing the E-RLPO concentration had a significant lowering effect on the drying time ( P < 0.001), since the main values of the drying time for formulae containing 30, 20, and 10% w / w of polymer were 57.4, 65.85, and 201.08 s, respectively (Table III ). This could be attributed to the decrease in the percentage of the solvent by increasing the polymer concentration. The average percentages of solvent were 63, 53, and 43% in formulae containing 10, 20, and 30% polymer, respectively. Also, increasing the concentration of E-RLPO ( i.e. , increasing the solute concentration) may lower the vapor pressure that leads to elevating the boiling point and therefore lengthening the drying time ( ). The addition of triacetin had also a significant lowering effect on the drying time. The higher amount of plasticizer could augment the solvent evaporation from the films. This could be referred to the fact that the molecular interactive forces between the polymer and the plasticizer are stronger than those between the polymer and the solvent ( ). The main values of the drying time of formulae containing 0, 10, and 30% of triacetin were 113.19, 106.84, and 104.31 s, respectively. On the other hand, Tween 80 had no significant effect on the drying time ( P > 0.001) and their main values are 107.77, 107.5, and 109.06 s upon using 0.25, 0.5, and 1% w / w Tween 80, respectively (Table III ).

Rheological Study
Determination of lacquer viscosity reflects the ease of application. Lacquer should not be of high viscosity ( ). Table II shows the flow index ( n ) and consistency index ( k ) of the lacquer formulae. The flow index is a factor to measure the non-Newtonian-ness of the fluid. n = 1 indicates Newtonian fluid, n < 1 refers to a shearing-thinning fluid, and n > 1 refers to a shear-thickening fluid ( , ). The consistency index ( k ) is known as the viscosity at a shear rate 1 s −1 . The flow index of all the formulations was close to 1 indicating the Newtonian behavior of the lacquer. The main effect plot of different factors on consistency is represented in Fig. 6 . The results revealed that with an increase of the polymer, Tween 80, and triacetin concentrations, an increase in the consistency of the formula was observed (Tables II and III ). Fig. 6 Main effect plot of consistency of CPX lacquer
Water Resistance
The resistance of the lacquer film to water was evaluated by estimating the percentage loss of the film weight upon immersing in water up to 24 h. The results revealed the decrease of the water resistance of the formulae by increasing triacetin concentration from 0 to 30% as shown in Fig. 7 and Table III , but still within the permissible limits (< 10% loss of total film weight) ( ). The main values of the percentage weight loss of formulae containing 0, 10, and 30% triacetin were 0.53, 3.29, and 3.91%, respectively. As E-RLPO form a water-insoluble film ( ), a negligible loss in weight (< 1%) was therefore observed in formulations without triacetin (0%). On the other hand, triacetin is a water-soluble plasticizer and, upon penetration of water, it leaches out from the polymer matrix resulting in erosion of the lacquer film and thus a decrease in the film weight ( ). Both polymer and Tween 80 concentrations had a nonsignificant lowering effect on the water resistance of the lacquer as shown in Table III . Fig. 7 Main effect plot of water resistance of CPX lacquer
In Vitro Release Study
This test was performed to evaluate the ability of the formula to deliver the drug. The type of the film-forming polymer affects the reservoir properties and releases characteristics of the film ( ). Film affinity to keratin and nail permeation is influenced by the variances in the film-forming system technology ( ). Several factors such as the physicochemical properties of the drug, the type, and concentration of a polymer, plasticizer, and other excipients could affect the drug release of the dried film of the lacquer ( , , , ). In general, increasing the amount of Tween 80 was accompanied by a proportional increase in the release of CPX from different lacquer formulae. The main values of the percentage of drug released after 4 h for formulae containing 0.25, 0.5, and 1% Tween 80 were 56.92, 70.73, and 86.29%, respectively, as shown in Table III . This could be attributed to the solubilizing effect of Tween 80 by reducing the surface tension of CPX. Since Tween 80 is a water-soluble surfactant, it enhances the water absorption capacity of the polymer matrix. Such water absorption into the film facilitates solubility and diffusion of the drug out of the film matrix (Fig. 8 , Table III ). Increasing the polymer concentration was associated with a decrease in the release of CPX. The main values of the release percentage after 4 h for formulae containing 10, 20, and 30% polymer were 74.45, 74.29, and 65.21%, respectively (Table III ). Increasing the polymer concentration led to a decrease in the total porosity of the matrices which included the initial porosity in addition to the porosity that resulted from the dissolution of the drug, thus decreasing the release rate. Similar results were reported with previous investigations ( ). Also, increasing the polymer concentration led to an increase in the thickening of the formed film, thus increasing the path length of drug diffusion and resulting in the hindering of the drug release (Fig. 8 ). Fig. 8 Main effect plot of percentage of drug released after 4 h
Previous results investigated that a water-soluble plasticizer such as triacetin may leach out of the lacquer dried film during dissolution ( , ) or in the biological fluids and that led to a decrease in the mechanical strength of the film, promoting pore formation and thus facilitating the drug release from the matrix. In our work, at a low concentration of triacetin (10%), a decrease in the amount of the drug released was observed in comparison to the corresponding free-plasticized lacquer (0% triacetin). This could be because all free-plasticized films were brittle in nature (high percentage of cracks and porosity), and upon addition of the plasticizer, a complete film free of cracks (low percentage of porosity) resulted. This plasticized film had higher mechanical strength that makes any possible loss of plasticizer through leaching to only marginally occur ( , ). At a high concentration of triacetin (30%), a considerable increase in the drug release was noticed. This high drug release may be due to the solubility of triacetin in water that increases the permeability of the film to water and increases the porosity of the film for drug diffusion ( , ). The main values of the percentage of drug release after 4 h for formulae containing 0, 10, and 30% triacetin were 68.11, 55.96, and 89.87%, respectively (Table III ). Regarding the above results, only eight formulae had the ability to deliver > 90% of the drug after 4 h (Table III ).
The kinetic mechanism of the drug release from lacquer formulae is shown in Table III . The results revealed that all nonplasticized lacquer showed a non-Fickian mechanism (anomalous transport) in which the release of the drug is controlled by a swelling and diffusion mechanism. On the other hand, most of the plasticized lacquer especially those that had a high concentration of triacetin showed a Fickian mechanism, since the presence of triacetin may increase the porosity of the film matrix and the surface area of drug diffusion.
Ex Vivo Permeation Study
From the above results, four formulae (F4B, F5B, F6B, and F9B) which showed good physical properties, good drying time, and high drug release were selected and subjected to an ex vivo permeation study. Table IV shows the permeability parameter including the accumulated amount per unit area, drug flux ( J ss ), permeation coefficient (Kp), and diffusion constant. The result revealed that F4B which contains a lower amount of surfactant (0.25% Tween 80) showed the highest flux than the other formulae. At lower surfactant concentrations, the thermodynamic activity of the drug in the lacquer formula may increase ( ). At a higher surfactant concentration, the affinity of the drug would be higher to the vehicle and the thermodynamic activity would be lower leading to a slow drug release and/or a poor diffusion of the drug from this vehicle to the receptor medium ( ). The low flux of formula F9B can be attributed to its high viscosity beside the high surfactant concentration, since the increase in the viscosity increases the thickness of the film that led to the increasing of the path length of the drug diffusion. The flux of F4B was found to be threefold increased than that of the marketed formula. Also, the new formula overcomes the prolonged transport lag time as the lag time of the formula was 2 h. These results suggested papain as a potential nail permeation enhancer for CPX. Table IV Ex Vivo Permeation Parameters of the Selected Nail Lacquers Formulae no.

Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM)
CLSM was utilized to give us information about the permeation efficiency of the different permeation enhancers. Also, it gave us an evidence of the permeation efficiency of the optimized nail lacquer. In this study, Rhodamine B dye replaced the drug in the formulations to compare the permeation efficiency of the four formulae to the lacquer vehicle without permeation enhancer by measuring the fluorescence intensity of the permeated dye. Figure 9 illustrates the micrograph of nail plates subjected to the formulations (with papain) and Batrafen (served as a control). In the case of formulations, the dye was more dispersed and deeply diffused through the nail layers as shown in Fig. 9 a–d. In the case of the control, the dye spread only on the upper surface of the nail plate with low intensity (Fig. 9 e). The fluorescent intensity was 130,000, 36,000, 25,000, 16,000, and 9000 AU for F4B, F5B, F6B, and F9B, and control, respectively. These results were in concurrence with the results of the ex vivo permeation study and indicated the important role of the permeation enhancer in the transungual delivery formulation.

CONCLUSION
In our work, a novel CPX-based Eudragit nail lacquer containing endopeptidase enzyme (papain) as penetration enhancer was effectively developed and evaluated for its efficiency in enhancing the transungual permeation. The results showed the effect of different excipients such as solubilizing agent and plasticizers on the physical properties of lacquer formulation and drug release. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the permeation enhancer in the nail delivery system as the nail lacquer formulation. The results corroborate the dominance of the developed novel lacquer formula over the marketed CPX lacquer. CLSM outcomes revealed that the lacquer formula containing papain is able to convey CPX to a significant extent and can target it to the nail bed to ensure more effective treatment of onychomycosis so that the patient will have the capacity to carry on with a quality life.
