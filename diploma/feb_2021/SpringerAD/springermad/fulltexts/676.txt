Introduction
Hypertension is considered as one of the most important cardiovascular (CV) risk factors due to its high prevalence and strong, direct relationship between blood pressure (BP) and vascular mortality [ , ]. Poor BP control may be attributed to various reasons including inertia or negligence in titrating therapy, poor patient compliance, and genuine drug resistance. Treatment-resistant hypertension (TRH), defined as poor BP control in spite of treatment with multiple anti-hypertensive medications, is an increasingly relevant and clinically challenging problem associated with CV morbidity and mortality [ , , , ]. The prevalence of TRH varies according to the assessment definitions of BP resistance. In the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) study, the BP of approximately 30% of participants remained uncontrolled on an average of two medications [ , ]. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANESs) indicate that 10−30% of patients receiving three or more anti-hypertensive medications had inadequate BP control [ ]. The Japanese J-HOME study indicated that the prevalence of TRH was 13% [ ]. Hung et al. analyzed the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) and reported that 14.6% of hypertensive patients aged ≥45 years received continuously concomitant use of three or more anti-hypertensive medications in Taiwan [ ].
The goal of combination therapy should not only focus on controlling BP but also reducing CV events. The typical combination therapy includes a blocker/inhibitor of the renin-angiotensin system [angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs)] or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB)], or of the sympathetic system (beta-blocker), and a drug stimulating the system [calcium channel blocker (CCB), diuretic, or vasodilator]. This strategy inhibits both activated and counter-regulatory mechanisms. Several studies demonstrate the efficacy of ACEI/CCB [ , ], ACEI/diuretic [ , ], and CCB/diuretic [ ] combination therapy for controlling BP and reducing CV events. The results of the ASCOT-BPLA (Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial−Blood Pressure Lowering Arm) [ ] and ACCOMPLISH (Avoiding Cardiovascular Events through Combination Therapy in Patients Living with Systolic Hypertension) [ ] trials suggested that the ACEI/CCB combination prevented more CV events than the beta-blocker/diuretic or ACEI/diuretic combinations. Recent data demonstrated that triple combination of perindopril/indapamide/CCB resulted in lower all-cause mortality and fewer CV deaths than those not receiving a CCB in diabetic patients with TRH [ ]. Several cardiovascular guidelines support the combination of ACEI/ARB and CCB/diuretic based on pathophysiological rationale and extrapolation of results from studies comparing combinations of two anti-hypertensive drugs [ , , ]. However, there is a lack of studies directly comparing different triple combinations of anti-hypertensive drugs for difficult controlled hypertension. It remains unclear whether there is an optimum triple combination of anti-hypertensive drugs for reducing CV events. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effects of different triple combinations on the incidence of CV events and mortality by analyzing data from the Taiwan NHIRD.
Methods
Study Design and Data Sources
A nationwide retrospective cohort study on hypertension patients who received triple combination treatment was conducted using the claims data of the NHIRD. The NHIRD includes more than 99% of the entire Taiwanese population of 23 million people, and the National Health Research Institute (NHRI) regularly compiled and released the data for research purposes. The NHIRD claims data provides comprehensive information on healthcare utilization from all National Health Insurance (NHI)-contracted medical institutions. This study was approved by the Review Board of the National Taiwan University Hospital, and informed consent was waived. A special request application was filed to the NHRI for the release of claims data for a random sample of one tenth of the prevalent hypertension patient population during 2000−2011. The prevalent hypertension patients were defined as patients who had at least four outpatient/emergency room visits with primary diagnosis ICD-9-CM (International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, Clinical Modification) codes 401, 402, 403, 404, and 405 in any given year during 2000−2011. Then, the NHI claims data of this patient cohort were scrambled cryptographically and released in electronic format to the researchers. Confidentiality assurances were addressed by abiding by data regulations of the Administration of NHI.
Study Subjects
Four classes of anti-hypertension drugs are commonly used in clinical settings in Taiwan, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) (hereafter referred as the A drug), beta-blockers (the B drug), calcium channel blockers (CCBs) (the C drug), and diuretics (the D drug). The compound names of these four classes of anti-hypertensive drugs and the reimbursement codes of each individual drug reimbursed by the National Health Insurance were searched and identified from the website of NHI Administration (Supplementary Table S1 ).
The following criteria were applied for inclusion and exclusion of study subjects. First, we identified patients who received a triple anti-hypertension drug treatment (i.e., who were concurrently prescribed any combination of three of the aforementioned four classes of anti-hypertensive agents) during January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2006 ( N = 161,178). There were four possible combinations of triple anti-hypertension drug treatment, namely A + B + C drugs, A + C + D drugs, B + C + D drugs, and A + B + D drugs. The initial date of the outpatient/emergency room visit resulting in the prescription of at least three different classes of anti-hypertensive agents was defined as the index date.
Second, patients who received regular treatment with a specific triple anti-hypertension drug combination within 3 years after the index date were included in the study ( N = 19,461). Regular treatment with a specific triple combination of anti-hypertension drugs was defined as the medication possession ratio (MPR) of the specific type of triple combination equal to or greater than 0.7; at the same time, the MPR of other types of triple combinations could not exceed 0.1. The following formula was applied: $$ {\displaystyle \begin{array}{l} MPR=\Big(t\mathrm{otal}\ \mathrm{number}\ \mathrm{of}\ \mathrm{days}\ \mathrm{for}\ \mathrm{which}\ A+B+C\ \mathrm{drugs}\ \mathrm{were}\ \mathrm{prescribed}\ \mathrm{in}\ \mathrm{outpatient}/\mathrm{emergency}\ \mathrm{room}\ \mathrm{visits}\ \mathrm{within}\\ {}3\ \mathrm{years}\ \mathrm{after}\ \mathrm{the}\ \mathrm{in}\mathrm{dex}\ \mathrm{date}\left)\hbox{--} \right(\mathrm{total}\ \mathrm{overlapped}\ \mathrm{days}\ \mathrm{during}\ \mathrm{which}\ A+B+C\ \mathrm{drugs}\ \mathrm{were}\ \mathrm{prescribed}\ \mathrm{within}\ 3\ \mathrm{years}\ \mathrm{after}\\ {}\mathrm{the}\ \mathrm{in}\mathrm{dex}\ \mathrm{date}\Big)/\left(365\times 3\right)\end{array}} $$
The number of overlapped days of drug prescribed was subtracted to account for the fact that patients might have their prescription filled earlier before they finished the previous one, or engage in “doctor shopping” behavior in the NHI system [ ].
Third, the main interest of this study was to compare the outcomes of hypertension patients who received triple combination of A + C + D drugs (hereafter referred to as the A + C + D group) with those of patients who received A + B + C drugs (the A + B + C group). Patients who failed to meet the definition of regular treatment with A + C + D drugs or A + B + C drugs were excluded ( N = 5910). Finally, 5938 patients in the A + C + D group and 7613 patients in the A + B + C group were included (Fig. 1 ). Fig. 1 Process of selecting the study subjects. A angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, AECI/ARB; B beta-blocker; C calcium channel blocker, CCB; D diuretic
Definition of Variables
The A + C + D group was defined as the case group, and the A + B + C group as the controlled group. The main outcomes of interest were stroke, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), death, and major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE). MACE was defined as a composite index of stroke, AMI, or death, whichever occurred first. To identify all outcome events, each patient was tracked from the index date until the end of 2011 or the date of death, whichever came first. Patients who were alive without any event of stroke or AMI were censored on December 31, 2011. Stroke and AMI events were identified by any admission claims with diagnosis codes indicated for stroke (ICD-9-CM codes 430−436) or AMI (ICD-9-CM codes 410−412). A death event was identified if the discharge status of any admission was “death” or the patient was disenrolled from the NHI program and was never re-enrolled in the NHI beneficiary registry files.
Computation and Matching of Propensity Score
Propensity scoring matching was used to reduce selection bias between A + C + D and A + B + C groups. The propensity score (PS) is defined as the probability of receiving the triple combination of anti-hypertensive agents A + C + D or A + B + C. The results of the logistic regression model for propensity matching are presented in Supplementary Table S2 . The A + C + D and A + B + C group were then matched by PS at a 1:1 ratio (cases:controls) without replacement. The final PS-matched sample that was used for analysis included 5120 patients in each of the A + C + D and A + B + C groups.
Subgroup Analyses
The study patients were further classified into four subgroups according to their prior disease history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and myocardial infarction (MI) to investigate whether prior CV co-morbidities would affect the event-free survival of CV morbidity and mortality between the A + C + D and the A + B + C group. The PS matching method was applied for each subgroup analysis, respectively. After propensity matching, there were 3721 patients who had no prior disease history of CVA or MI in the A + C + D group and A + B + C group, respectively. For patients with a prior disease history of MI, or CVA, or combined MI and CVA, there were 178, 1032, or 84 patients identified in each group, respectively.
Statistical Analyses
The demographic and clinical characteristics of the study subjects were described, and the Pearson χ 2 test for categorical variables was used to compare differences in the distribution of patient characteristics between the A + C + D and A + B + C groups. The incidence rates of stroke, AMI, mortality, and MACE were computed as the number of events divided by the person-year. The Cox proportional regression analysis was performed to investigate the hazard ratio (HR) of event-free survival (stroke, AMI, mortality, and MACE) between the A + C + D and the A + B + C groups. All analyses were performed using SAS/stat Version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).
Results
A total of 161,178 patients were identified with concurrent use of three anti-hypertension drugs during 2004–2006 (incidence rate = 9.603%). Demographic and clinical characteristics before and after propensity score matching of the study patients ( N = 13,551) are presented in Table 1 . As expected, the A + C + D group had more patients with COPD, DM, heart failure, and CVA, whereas the A + B + C group had more patients with a previous history of hyperlipidemia, ischemic heart disease, and prior MI. After matching, 5120 patients in each group were included in the analysis and there were no significant differences in clinical characteristics between the two groups.

Table 2 presents the incidence rates of stroke, AMI, mortality, and MACE in all included patients. The incidence rates of stroke, AMI, mortality, and MACE within each subgroup with various disease history are shown in Table 3 . Compared with patients without prior disease history of CVA or MI, the incidence rates of stroke, AMI, mortality, and MACE were higher in patients with prior disease history of CVA, MI, or both. For patients with prior disease history of CVA and MI, the A + C + D group had a significantly lower incidence rate of AMI than the A + B + C group (5.74 vs. 9.09%; p = 0.04). For patients with prior disease history of MI, there was no significant difference in the incidence of stroke, AMI, mortality, and MACE between the two treatment groups, although all incidence rates were lower in the A + C + D group.

Figure 2 shows the adjusted HRs and 95% confidence interval (CI) of event-free survival of stroke, AMI, mortality, and MACE for the A + C + D vs. A + B + C group. The crude and adjusted HRs and 95% CI are listed in Supplementary Table S3 . There was no significant difference in the stroke-free survival between the A + C + D group and the A + B + C group. Compared with the A + B + C group, the A + C + D group had a significantly higher AMI-free survival in patients with prior disease history of CVA (adjusted HR = 1.56; 95% CI, 1.051−2.307; p < 0.05). The A + C + D group showed a greater benefit of reducing AMI-free survival to the A + B + C group for patients with prior disease history of MI (adjusted HR = 1.43; 95% CI, 0.850−2.387; p = 0.179) and in patients with prior disease history of CVA and MI (adjusted HR = 1.41; 95% CI, 0.627−3.171; p = 0.405), however, the results were not statistically significant. For patients with a prior disease history of CVA or MI, the AMI-free survival also was significantly higher in the A + C + D group than in the A + B + C group (adjusted HR = 1.57; 95% CI, 1.20−2.05; p < 0.05) (data not shown). The mortality-free survival did not differ significantly between the A + C + D group and the A + B + C group regardless of whether or not patients had a prior disease history of CVA or MI. For MACE-free survival, there was no significant difference between the A + C + D and A + B + C groups among patients without prior disease history (adjusted HR = 1.10; 95% CI, 0.967−1.251; p = 0.147) or with prior disease history (adjusted HR = 1.10; 95% CI, 0.962−1.261; p = 0.180) (data not shown).

Discussion
In this nationwide population-based study, the propensity score matching method was applied to identify 10,240 patients who received triple combination of ACEIs/ARBs, beta-blockers, and CCBs, versus ACEIs/ARBs, CCBs, and diuretics, from NHIRD in Taiwan. The effectiveness of the two triple combination drug treatments in reducing CV events and mortality then was compared. Results showed that there were no significant differences in the occurrence of stroke, AMI, mortality, and MACE between the A + C + D and A + B + C groups. Although beta-blocker has been generally considered as the first choice for patients with ischemic heart disease, the current study indicated that the A + B + C combination did not provide greater reduction of the CV risk than the A + C + D combination for patients with prior MI history. For patients with prior CVA history, the A + C + D combination provided greater reduction in the occurrence of AMI than the A + B + C combination. Although several published studies investigate the effects of combining two anti-hypertensive medications, to our knowledge, the present study is the first that directly compares the efficacies of different triple combinations of BP-lowering drugs.
Systolic BP was reported to be the most important factor that determined and predicted CV risk in patients older than 50 years [ ]. BP variability also has been reported as an independent risk factor for CV events [ , ]. Higher BP variability was associated with higher CV risk [ ]. Nishioka et al. analyzed 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring and reported that beta-blockers were less effective in reducing BP variability than ACEIs and CCBs for patients with previous stroke history [ ]. The use of beta-blockers in the elderly as the first-line anti-hypertensive therapy did not reduce the risk of MI, heart failure, and mortality, but increased the risk of stroke when compared with other anti-hypertensive agents [ ]. Messerli et al. conducted a meta-analysis of 10 clinical trials including a total of 16,164 elderly patients, and found that diuretics were better than beta-blockers with respect to cardiac and cerebrovascular outcomes [ ]. In another meta-analysis evaluating the risk of stroke in long-term anti-hypertensive therapy, beta-blockers were associated with a significantly increased risk of stroke when compared with ACEIs, CCBs, or diuretics [ ]. The findings in this study were consistent with these studies, and demonstrated that the A + C + D combination maybe superior to the A + B + C combination in reducing CV risk.
For patients with ischemic heart disease, beta-blockers have been considered as cardioprotective based on several studies demonstrating the efficacy of beta-blockers in reducing angina episodes [ , , ]. A multicenter, randomized, double-blind controlled trial reported that beta-blockade was more effective than CCB in reducing the morning peak of ischemic activity [ ]. However, these studies failed to demonstrate a reduction in major CV events. Recently, there is some debate regarding whether beta-blockers are effective as the first choice for hypertension in patients with ischemic heart disease [ , ]. An observational study analyzed the REACH (Reduction of Atherothrombosis for Continued Health) registry and reported that there was no association between beta-blocker use and lower risk of CV events in patients with either CAD risk factors only, known prior MI, or known CAD without MI [ ]. Andersson et al. analyzed the data of 26,793 patients with first event of ischemic heart disease and found that beta-blockade was effective in reducing MI and mortality for patients with new-onset ischemic heart disease only when the patients had history of recent MI [ ]. Undoubtedly, adding the third anti-hypertensive drug provides better control of BP when patients already receive two anti-hypertensive medications and still cannot achieve adequate BP control. Our study demonstrated that, among patients with prior MI history, adding a beta-blocker may not be superior to adding a diuretic for reducing AMI and mortality when patients already receive ACEIs/ARBs and CCBs. Our findings also suggested that a beta-blocker may not be the first choice for the third anti-hypertensive drug in addition to ACEIs/ARBs and CCBs even for patients with ischemic heart disease. These combined results suggest that diuretics may be a better choice than beta-blockers for patients who already receive ACEIs/ARBs and CCBs.
There are several limitations in the present study. First, the limited patient numbers in each group failed to show significant differences. Second, the MPR was chosen to classify patients rather than the cumulative drug dosage. However, to eliminate the potential confounding effects of other drugs, we used strict MPR criteria to enroll patients. Third, the Taiwan NHIRD did not record individual information such as blood test, 24-h ambulatory BP measurement, smoking, alcohol consumption, body weight, excessive salt intake, and family history, which may confound the present findings. The MPR may reflect drug prescription rather than true drug compliance as we cannot verify whether patients truly consumed the prescribed drugs and dosages indicated in the claims data. The present study did not investigate patients receiving combinations of ≥4 anti-hypertensive medications. Therefore, the choice of additional anti-hypertensive drug for patients receiving at least three anti-hypertensive medications requires further investigation.
Conclusion
Adding a diuretic may be a better choice than adding a beta-blocker for hypertensive patients who have already received ACEIs/ARBs and CCBs.
