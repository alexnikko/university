INTRODUCTION
After identifying the critically quality attributes (CQA), establishing a design space is a two-step process. First, one must gain process understanding in the operating range of the system, and then one must decide on the boundaries of the design space. For a complex process like the film coating of multiparticulate beads, this can be difficult. The challenges arise because of the complex multidimensional relationship between the various components of the drug product, i.e. , raw materials, formulation composition, process parameters, and the CQA. Thus, the selection of a design of experiments (DOE) approach, leveraging of prior information, and selection of appropriate statistical methods are all critical to establishing the design space.
Film coating is a complex process in which the performance depends upon the combined influence of the processing conditions such as curing temperature, curing time, and humidity, and if done incorrectly can lead to film coats with variable properties that are subject to the effects of aging ( , , , ). Film formation is an evolving area of research and the principal theories have been reviewed by Keddie, Steward, Wicks and Visscher ( , , , ). Currently, the most widely accepted description of colloidal latex film formation is a three-stage process: (1) evaporation of the water and ordering of the particles, (2) particle deformation, and (3) coalescence of the particle-particle boundaries by interdiffusion of the polymer chains ( , ). The last two stages of film formation take place concurrently, because the capillary forces coming from the water-filled voids of the close-packed nano-particles cause particle deformation, which increases contact surface area between the particles, which in turn facilitates polymer chain diffusion between particles and hence coalescence. The complete coalescence of the latex particles leads to a fully formed film. Changes in the formulation and processing conditions can lead to a change in the extent of coalescence and hence changes in critical film properties.
The interdiffusion of the polymer particles necessary for coalescence will only take place at or above the glass transition temperature of the coating polymers, because only in a deformable fluid state do the polymer chains have enough molecular mobility to coalesce; in contrast, at temperatures below the Tg, the interfusion of the polymer chains will not occur at a rate sufficient for film formation during the coating process. However, a film that is not fully formed would slowly continue to coalescence during long-term storage ( ). The glass transition temperature of the polymer is affected by the plasticizer level; therefore, the temperature at which the film is cured is one of the important parameters for film coating ( , , , , ). For polymers like ethylcellulose, water is a very powerful plasticizer, and after the initial drying stage, the amount of water in the polymer coating is affected by the relative humidity of the inlet air; thus, the Tg and minimum film formation temperature of the polymer coat are influenced by the inlet air relative humidity. Consequently, the extent of film formation or coalescence is highly dependent upon having the necessary combination of curing temperature, humidity, and time. Obviously, there are other parameters that are important for the coating process such as atomization pressure and spray flow rate, but based upon our previous research, these are less important for film formation, which is the focus of this study ( ); thus, we have fixed these parameters in this study. There have been many studies that have examined these parameters ( , ).
To gain process understanding, there are numerous statistical designs that can be used in formulation and process development ( , ). Typically, when using statistical design of experiments, the full factorial design and fractional factorial design are used with two or three levels for screening and process understanding studies. Also, if non-linear quadratic effects are involved, then this cannot be estimated using first-order linear models. In such instances, response surface methodology can be used to explore the operating region of interest close to the optimal point ( ). This approach of elucidating the region of interest can be performed by conducting experiments using response surface design, which is used to map the response surface and build design space for the CQA and critical process parameters (CPP) ( ). The next step is to determine the design space. As defined by the FDA, “the design space is the set of points in which the values of the input variables and process parameters are predicted to meet the quality target product profile (QTPP) specifications.” Two popular methods for determining the boundaries of the design space are the traditional regression models with prescribed confidence limits such as 95%, or Monte Carlo simulations to determine probability of failure for a particular set of CQA or CPP ( ).
Another key issue with design space determination is how it translates across manufacturing scale. Scale-up of coating processes, especially those involving fluid bed technology, is often challenging. With fluid bed equipment, when changing scale, the process parameters at the larger scale need to be adjusted to maintain optimal performance. Otherwise, changing the scale can adversely impact bead coating uniformity and consequently drug release ( ). Thus, to avoid incomplete film formation, which can cause variable dissolution rates and affect release stability, one must scale the process conditions and the design space for a change in scale can lead to incomplete film formation, which can cause variable dissolution rates and affect release stability ( ).
Melegari et al . has studied ethylcellulose coating, but the article does not cover film coat curing in the context of moisture and only examines the Wurster column-based equipment ( ). To the best of the authors’ knowledge, there are no articles that studied design space determine using Disk-jet technology. Thus, this research will try and illustrate a systematic pathway for process development for multiparticulate bead coating using disk-jet fluid bed technology. The determination of a design space builds upon previous work in which the CQA have been identified; this research was discussed previously ( ). The primary objectives of this paper are to compare ways to establish a coating process design space for the CPP that can be verified across manufacturing scales, and to compare the design space for the CPP established using traditional methods with that determined using a Bayesian approach.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
Ciprofloxacin HCl layered beads (particle size range 1000–1400 μm); lot no. CH/SF/0010112 was obtained from Spansules Pharmatech, Hyderabad, India; the hydrophobic-controlled release polymer ethylcellulose dispersion (Aquacoat® ECD 30% aqueous dispersion with d50 ~ 450 nm); lot nos. JN1182330, JN1100202, JN12825161, and JN12824864 were obtained from FMC Biopolymer, Newark, DE; the hydrophilic plasticizer Triethyl citrate; lot no. 110171 was obtained from Vertellus, Greensboro, NC and the pigment color D&C Red no. 27; lot no. AL9922 was obtained from Colorcon, West Point, VA. The chemicals utilized for the analytical testing were either ACS or USP grade.
Bead Coating—Mycrolab and Unilab
Ciprofloxacin drug-layered beads were coated using the disk-jet technology fluid bed from OYSTAR Huttlin, now Bosch, fluid bed system (Schopfheim, Germany). In the authors’ previous study, the ciprofloxacin HCl-layered beads were assessed using risk analysis and characterized for the material attributes that can significantly affect the coating process and the final coated bead quality ( ); thus, for these studies, the drug-layered beads were considered a starting material and no drug layering was performed.
The small-scale batches were manufactured using the Mycrolab®, and scale-up batches were manufactured using the Unilab®; the batch sizes and formulations are given in Table I . The actual product temperature (referred to as the spraying temperature during spraying stage and the curing temperature during curing stage) was controlled to achieve the desired product temperature during spraying, using the fluid bed’s temperature probe installed in the coating zone (see Fig. 1 ). For both coating scales, the ciprofloxacin HCl-layered beads were preheated to the desired spray temperature before spraying; the microclimate (0.2 bar), atomization pressure (0.8 bar), and percent solids in the coating dispersion (15% w / v ) were kept constant for all the batches. The Mycrolab® and Unilab® use a special three-fluid nozzle. For the three-component nozzle, the three parameters that need to be set are the feed rate, atomization pressure, and microclimate. The feed rate and atomization pressure are the same as standard two-fluid nozzles. The microclimate is a special feature in which there is an outer cone of air flows around the atomization part of the nozzle; this cone of air shields the nozzle and reduces buildup of material on the nozzle and consequently nozzle clogging. As described below, the spray rate was ramped. The Mycrolab was fitted with a 1-L bowl and a Huttlin 0.8-mm diameter spray nozzle, while the Unilab was fitted with a 10-L bowl and a Huttlin 1.2-mm spray nozzle. In the Mycrolab, the coating dispersion was sprayed using an external peristaltic pump, whereas in the Unilab, the coating dispersion was sprayed using a built-in peristaltic pump.

The polymer coating dispersion was prepared as follows: (1) ethylcellulose dispersion was put through a 853-μm sieve and then added to water; the proportions are shown in Table I , then (2) triethyl citrate was added directly into the coating dispersion with continuous stirring using a magnetic stirrer, and the dispersion was stirred at least 30 min; (3) the color D&C Red no. 27 lake was slowly added to the coating dispersion and mixed for an additional 30 min; (4) the final coating dispersion was screened through a 152-μm screen.
For the Mycrolab (283.3 g batch size, Table I ), the coating dispersion was initially sprayed at 3 rpm for 5 min, then ramped to 5 rpm sprayed for 10 min and then ramped to 7 rpm and kept constant until the end of the run (approx. 0.7 g/min—3 rpm, 0.9 g/min—5 rpm, and 1.5 g/min—7 rpm). For the Unilab, (2832.5 g batch size, Table I ) scale-up batches, the coating dispersion spraying was initially sprayed at 3 rpm for 5 min, then ramped to 4 rpm sprayed for 10 min and then ramped to 6 rpm and kept constant until the end of the run (approx. 7.2 g/min—3 rpm, 8.8 g/min—4 rpm, and 14.9 g/min—6 rpm). After all the coating dispersion was sprayed, the coated beads were dried for 5 min at the same spraying temperature and thereafter cured at the desired curing temperature. After curing, the coated cured beads were cooled down, discharged, and screened. The processing conditions for the different manufacturing cycles were developed and optimized in the authors’ previous research; see Kothari et al . for fuller discussion ( ).
To measure temperature and humidity levels in the process environment, several Pyrobutton® data loggers from OPULUS (Philadelphia, PA) were used. These data loggers are small stainless steel disks (6 mm X 17 mm), and they were programmed to measure the temperature and humidity at 30-s intervals. The buttons are calibrated to measure temperature and humidity in the range − 20 to 85 °C (temperature accuracy ± 0.3 °C) and 3.4% RH to 97.3% RH (RH accuracy ± 2% RH), respectively, and they have protected memory for use in harsh environments, such as during fluid bed coating. For the RSM design and scale-up batches, 10 Pyrobuttons were placed at different locations in the fluid bed equipment; see Fig. 1 .
Test Methods
Percent Agglomeration and Percent Yield
At the end of the coating process, the ciprofloxacin HCl-coated beads were screened through 1680 and 1000 μm screens. The beads retained on the 1680 μm screen were used to determine the percent agglomeration, and beads passed through the 1000-μm screen were used to determine the percent fines; the total weight of the measurement samples collected during the coating run was also included in the yield calculation. Based on percent agglomeration and percent fines, the percent yield of the batch is calculated as shown in Eq. 1 listed below: $$ \%\boldsymbol{Yield}=\frac{Total\kern0.24em \mathrm{b} ead\; weight\ after\ coating-\left(\mathrm{A} gglomerates+\mathrm{F} ines+ Samples\right)}{Starting\ batch\ weight+ weight\ of\ coating\ formulation\ sprayed}\times 100 $$ (1)
The weight of coating formulation sprayed was determined by the amount of solids sprayed onto the beads; the amount sprayed was determined by the volume of material sprayed during coating multiplied by the percent solids.
In Vitro Drug Release Studies
For the dissolution studies, 100 mg of coated beads, equivalent to 25.7 mg of ciprofloxacin HCl, was used. The dissolution medium consisted of 900 mL of 0.1 N HCl at pH 1.2 ± 0.05 and the dissolution apparatus was USP apparatus I—basket type (SR8Plus—Hanson Research, Chatsworth, CA) operating at 100 rpm and 37 ± 5 °C. The dissolution apparatus had automated sampling with a peristaltic pump connected to an on-line UV-Visible spectrometer (Pharmaspec UV-1700, Shimadzu Corp., Columbia, MD), and sample aliquots were measured periodically at 30-min time interval continuously for 10 h at 276 nm wavelength. The amount of drug released was calculated based on the calibration curve and absorbance value for every time point.
Loss on Drying
The coated bead residual moisture content was determined using a halogen lamp loss-on-drying (LOD) apparatus (Mettler Toledo, HB43 Halogen). To measure LOD, approximately 1.0 g of the coated beads were placed in the aluminum pan and heated for about 60 min at 105 °C. The LOD instrument method measured the bead weight as a function of time until no weight change was observed.
Determination of Coating Level Specification
The rationale for these studies is discussed in the results section; a key factor in determining drug release rate is the coating thickness, which can be indirectly measured by weight gain; thus, we need a specification for weight gain. To achieve the dissolution QTPP, the specification for the beads must have an initial amount released in 1 h, at least 50% in 2 h and at least 80% in 7 h. The choice of these time points was based upon the regulatory guidance ICH Q6A. To determine the target weight gain specification, the ciprofloxacin HCl-coated batches were manufactured at different polymer coating weight gains (see Table II ); the processing conditions with regard to spraying (inlet air volume 30 m 3 /h and spraying temperature 42 °C) and curing conditions (curing temperature 60 °C and curing time 4 h) were kept constant. Based upon these studies, the weight gain specification was established at 3% w / w , and this level was utilized in the response surface batches, for process optimization and to map response surface for defining the CPP design space.

Design of Experiments and Statistical Analysis
The DoE to determine the response surface was based upon a central composite circumscribed design (CCCD). The design and statistical analysis was created using the Design Expert® (software version 8.0.4: Stat-Ease, Inc., Minneapolis, MN). A CCCD was chosen so that information outside the process range, i.e. , factorial points, would be obtained to determine the possible edge of failure ( , ). The CCCD design consisted of two levels for the factorial points, two levels for the axial points—also called star points—and one level for the center point. In total, every factor was evaluated at five different levels across the parameter range. The axial points are calculated based on an alpha value (± 0.5α) and the total number of factorial points in the experimental runs. The design type and factor processing ranges were chosen based on information obtained from the previous study ( ), preliminary experiments, and a coating level optimization study to shift the region of interest close to optimum. In order to fit the quadratic model, before executing the experiments, the design’s power, i.e. , signal/noise ratio (change in response/experimental error), was determined using the fraction of design space (FDS). FDS determines the design region that can be estimated with precision. In a typical assessment, FDS greater than 80% is considered acceptable for design space prediction ( ). The other attributes used for the design evaluation were plots of the standard error and the average leverages or relative weights of design points in the regression, which were used to identify outliers. The RSM design runs were randomized to obviate the influence of uncontrolled variables during batch manufacturing.
The response surface was fitted using the central composite design structured to estimate the quadratic model using the four factors at two levels to understand the relationship between the factors and the responses and determine the optimum maxima and minima is: $$ y={\beta}_0+{\sum}_i{\beta}_i{x}_i+{\sum \limits}_i{\beta}_{ii}{x}_i^2+\sum {\sum}_{i<j}{\beta}_i{x}_i{\beta}_{ij}{x}_i{x}_j+\varepsilon $$ (2) where y = response evaluated, β 0 = intercept, β i = main factor regression coefficients also called as beta, β ij = two-factor interaction coefficients, β ii = quadratic term coefficients, and ε = random error. Three-factor interaction terms, β ijk , are often explored but are typically omitted because they are typically not observed to be important in fluid bed coating, and none of our preliminary data indicates they were significant. Equation 2 is written more compactly in matrix notation as shown in $$ \boldsymbol{y}={\boldsymbol{\beta}}_0+{\mathbf{x}}^{\prime}\boldsymbol{\upbeta} +{\mathbf{x}}^{\prime}\mathbf{Bx}+\boldsymbol{\varepsilon} $$ (3) where x = ( x 1 , x 2 ,…, x k )′ is the vector of k independent variables coded such that x = 0 is the center point of the design and β is the vector of coefficients ( β 1 ,β 2 ,...,β k )′, and B is a symmetric ( k × k ) matrix in which the diagonal terms are regression coefficients, β ii ( i.e. , β 11 of the B matrix equals β 1 of the β v ector), and the off-diagonal terms are β ij /2. The errors are multivariate normal. The maximum likelihood estimates, \( {\overset{\wedge }{\beta}}_0 \) , \( \overset{\wedge }{\boldsymbol{\upbeta}} \) , and \( \overset{\wedge }{\mathbf{B}} \) are substituted for β 0 , β , and B , respectively. The true stationary point, \( {\widehat{\mathbf{x}}}^s \) , is as shown in $$ {\overset{\wedge }{\mathbf{x}}}^{\boldsymbol{s}}=-{\overset{\wedge }{\mathbf{B}}}^{-1}\overset{\wedge }{\boldsymbol{\beta}}/\mathbf{2} $$ (4)
The design space for the CPP was established using two different approaches. The first approach utilized statistical least squares regression with contour plots, and the second approach utilized seemingly unrelated regression for the probability Bayesian approach. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) was calculated using the partial sum of squares method, and the mathematical model was fitted using least-squares regression. The quality of the fitted model was assessed using the usual ANOVA estimates such as the residual error sum of squares, predicted R-squared, adjusted predicted R-squared, adequate precision, and diagnostic, while the response surface plots were ultimately used to establish a design space. The design space was established based on contour plots for the predicted responses with confidence interval of 95% and desirability function. Desirability is a multiple response method, which utilizes geometric mean of all transformed responses to find the optimum solution where the values are set from zero (outside the limit) to one (within the limit), based on the goal for the responses, i.e. , none, minimum, maximum, target, and in range. The main objective of the desirability function is to find a set of good conditions and propose different solutions that will meet all the dissolution time point specification limits.
Based upon the coating level determination study, the ciprofloxacin HCl-layered beads were coated with the Aquacoat® ECD at 3% w / w weight gain. The values for the independent parameters and their levels are shown in Table III . A total of 30 experiments were performed, with 6 batches manufactured at the center point. The responses studied were percent agglomeration, percent yield, percent drug released (at 1, 2, and 7 h) and LOD.

Design Space Using Gibbs-Sampling, Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Simulation—a Bayesian Approach
We used Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation of dissolution outcomes as a second method for determining the CPP design space for dissolution and to estimate uncertainty contours in the design space. We implemented the MCMC simulation of dissolution outcomes using the methods of Peterson and colleagues ( , ). This approach uses seemingly unrelated regression ( ) to estimate regression coefficients and cross-model covariance for a set of stacked linear equations. Each univariate regression is given in $$ {\boldsymbol{y}}_{\boldsymbol{t}}={\boldsymbol{\beta}}_0+{\sum}_{\boldsymbol{i}}{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{\boldsymbol{i}}{\boldsymbol{x}}_{\boldsymbol{i}}+\sum {\sum}_{\boldsymbol{i}<\boldsymbol{j}}{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{\boldsymbol{i}\boldsymbol{j}}{\boldsymbol{x}}_{\boldsymbol{i}}{\boldsymbol{x}}_{\boldsymbol{j}}+\boldsymbol{\varepsilon} $$ (5) with the meaning of the β and x terms as in Eq. 1 and y t = dissolution at time = t . Current FDA guidance for industry does not recommend fitting any particular model for dissolution but suggests that three time points might be sufficient to measure similarity with a “target” dissolution curve (GFI). Thus, we used various combinations of times in the set [1,2,…,7] hr for a dissolution “model-free” assumption for the MCMC experiment. The principal assumption under seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) calculations is that the cross-equation errors ε are correlated. Additionally, if the factors are the same in every equation, then SUR estimates are no different than those obtained using ordinary least squares (OLS) calculations. We assumed that dissolution ( y t ) measured independently at a sequence of time points would meet that condition of cross-model correlation and were aware in the RSM studies that the significant parameters ( β s) also varied from one dissolution time to the next. If we write the preceding equation more conveniently in matrix form, we have $$ {y}_t={X}_t{\beta}_t+{e}_t,\kern0.5em t=1,\dots, k $$
For example, for k = 3 time points, we have the matrix as shown in $$ \left(\begin{array}{c}{y}_1\\ {}{y}_2\\ {}{y}_3\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}{\boldsymbol{X}}_1& 0& 0\\ {}0& {\boldsymbol{X}}_2& 0\\ {}0& 0& {\boldsymbol{X}}_3\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}{\beta}_1\\ {}{\beta}_2\\ {}{\beta}_3\end{array}\right)+\left(\begin{array}{c}{\varepsilon}_1\\ {}{\varepsilon}_2\\ {}{\varepsilon}_3\end{array}\right) $$ (6) for which the betas are stacked vectors of the coefficients for the three equations; each X i is a vector of the significant independent terms from the design matrixes, including defining 1 for the intercept. For example, X 1 = ( 1 , x 1 , x 2 , x 3 , x 1 x 2 , x 1 x 3 )′, X 2 = ( 1 , x 1 , x 2 , x 3 , x 1 x 3 )′, X 3 = ( 1 , x 2 , x 3 , x 2 x 3 )′ might describe a typical set of stacked regression equations in which there are different subsets of regressors for each equation. Equation 6 can be written conveniently in matrix notation as shown in $$ Y= X\beta +e $$ (7) where the residual errors are multivariate normal e ~ N ( 0 ,Σ) and Σ is the cross-equation covariance matrix. It is convenient for simulation calculations to write e as the product of the transposed Cholesky square root matrix, (Σ 1/2 )′, and ε ~ N ( 0 , I ). In order to calculate the SUR regressors, an ordinary least squares estimation is used. Our general procedure for obtaining regression coefficients and Σ using SUR is as follows: 1. Define a balanced system of linear equations, one for each time point. 2. Use OLS regression (package systemfit in R or proc syslin in SAS 9.3) to find significant first-order and interaction terms ( , ). 3. If the cross-model correlations are significant, submit the interaction terms to SUR regression (package systemfit in R or proc syslin in SAS 9.3). 4. Obtain estimates of the regression coefficients, and Σ from the SUR calculations.
The estimates from SUR calculations served as inputs for the rsurGibbs procedure from the bayesm package in R ( ) . The rsurGibbs procedure performs MCMC sampling of the SUR model using a Gibbs sampler ( ). Essentially, the Gibbs sampler draws iteratively from the conditional posterior probability density functions (pdfs) for ( β |Σ) and (Σ| β ) ( , , ).The inputs to rsurGibbs include the significant coefficients from the M regression equations and the cross-model covariance matrix, Σ. The input values of x can be a lattice covering the design range as in Peterson ( ) or drawn randomly from uniform or other appropriate distributions. For convenience and density of the outputs, we used random samples of uniform distributions for the values of x ij .
The R program creates Markov chains in β and Σ in addition to calculating the dependent variables for vector y . Diagnostic plotting is used to monitor the “burn-in” and mixing of the sample chains in addition to monitoring for lagged correlation in the chains. In order to calculate a posterior probability for the “acceptable” design space, we used the f2 similarity criterion using a “target” dissolution profile for calculation. The probability that all time points were in an acceptable range was calculated from the number of simulations that were “close to” or within a determined range of acceptable values ( e.g. , limits as lower and upper specification limits or a region defined as a multiple of the target value, e.g. , (0.9 × target ) < y < (1.1 × target )) . Using our approach of a model-free dissolution curve, the posterior probabilities of acceptable dissolution f2 ≥ 50 were calculated for predetermined triples of dissolution times or for all seven time points for dissolution.
Scale-Up Batches
The scale-up batches were manufactured using a linear scale approach from 0.275 to 2.75 kg scale, a tenfold increase in batch size. The scale-independent CPP, i.e. , spraying temperature and curing temperature, and their ranges were utilized based on the results of the design space from the response surface study. The parameters deemed non-significant in the response surface study for the range studied, i.e. , microclimate and atomization pressure, were kept the same in the scale-up batches. The inlet air volume was increased linearly from 29 to 290 m 3 /h based on the increase in bed size to the air volume ratio, which is a tenfold increase: $$ {{\mathrm{A}}_1}^{\ast }\ {\mathrm{B}}_1={{\mathrm{A}}_2}^{\ast }\ {\mathrm{B}}_2 $$ (8) A 1 = air volume utilized in the confirmatory batch using the design space from Mycrolab batches, B 1 = batch size of the confirmatory batch using Mycrolab, A 2 = air volume calculated for the scale-up batches, and B 2 = batch size of the scale-up batches. The spray rate was optimized to keep a similar amount of polymer deposition over the coating period, i.e. , amount of dispersion sprayed/kg of material. The calculation for the spray rate at different peristaltic pump speeds of 3, 5, and 7 rpm for Mycrolab batches versus 3, 4, and 6 rpm for Unilab batches was performed based on the batch size as shown in Eq. 9 to maintain similar spray flux at different scale batches. $$ {{\mathrm{S}}_{\mathrm{rm}}}^{\ast }\ {\mathrm{A}}_1={{\mathrm{S}}_{\mathrm{ru}}}^{\ast }\ {\mathrm{A}}_2 $$ (9) S rm = Spray rate rpm using Mycrolab batches, A 1 = Amount sprayed per kg of material at the set rpm in Mycrolab batches, S ru = Spray rate using Unilab Batches, and A 2 = Amount sprayed per kg of material at the set rpm in Unilab batches. The main objectives of the scale-up batches were to first evaluate the impact of scale-up on process efficiency and secondly to challenge and confirm the design space of the CPP established using smaller R&D scale equipment. The scale-up batches were manufactured in two stages, preliminary batches and process-ranging batches conducted in two blocks. A total of three preliminary batches were manufactured, one at the optimal setting of the CPP per the design space to confirm the coating level, and the other two batches to investigate the effect of CPP outside the design space as shown in Table IV . All three batches were cured for 4 h. For the process-ranging batches, a total of 12 batches were manufactured in two blocks, i.e. , six batches in each block (Fig. 2 ). Block 1 consisted of four factorial points batches and two center point batches from the RSM design space and block 2 consisted of four factorial points and two center points batches using extended design space information, i.e. , mid-points of the CPP between the statistical design space and Monte Carlo simulation design space. The comparison of the variables for the Mycrolab and Unilab batches are shown in Table V .

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The work presented in this study is an extension of the authors’ previous study, which used systematic risk assessment models to identify the CPP that influence product quality and if not controlled can increase the risk of product failure; see steps 1–5 in Fig. 3 ( ). In this previous study, a two-step risk approach was used where (1) the CPP were identified by a qualitative risk analysis and then (2) these results were tested using a quantitative resolution V fractional factorial design followed by a resolution IV fractional factorial design. These studies helped us to understand the processing factors that affect coat variability ( e.g. , dissolution rate) due to differences in process efficiency and the extent of film formation. Using these studies, a regression model that related CPP to the critical quality attributes of the final coated beads was established; in addition, a basic understanding of critical process parameter ranges was determined. Fig. 3 Schematic showing the total QbD development process; steps 6, 7, and 8 are the focus of this study. Steps 1 through 5, have been described in our previous study ( )
The results presented and analyzed in this paper focus on steps 6, 7, and 8, shown in Fig. 3 . Recall the objectives of this study are to (1) compare two methods of determining the design space and (2) see how this design space changes across manufacturing scales and needs to be revaluated to account for the scale change. To achieve these objectives, we first need a formulation that meets the QTPP requirements for dissolution; because the coating formulation was optimized and we did not want to change the composition to achieve the desired release rate, the coating thickness or level had to be determined so the formulation meets the release requirements. Once the formulation and coating level have been established, then the target processing conditions must be determined; this is usually at a processing optimum in the response surface. To determine response surface model, Eq. 2 must be fit to the data, and the best model found. The response surface model can then be used to determine the design space, i.e. , the range of parameters for which, if the processing conditions are within this range, the final product has a high probably of meeting its QTPP. The design space for the CPP was established using two different approaches. The first approach utilized statistical least-square regression for the contour overlays and the second approach utilized seemingly unrelated regression for the Bayesian probability approach. Then, the design space and response surface models were tested across different manufacturing scales. This process is outlined in Fig. 3 .
Coating Level Determination for Release Specification
To determine the best weight gain (which is related to coat thickness) in order to meet the QTPP drug release requirements, ciprofloxacin HCl drug-layered beads were coated with an ethylcellulose polymer with 3% w / w , 4% w / w , or 5% w / w weight gain. The three batches were manufactured using the formulations given in Table II and the same processing conditions, which included an absolute humidity of 10–12 g/kg of air and a 4-h curing time. These batches had a similar percent agglomeration (< 0.5%), percent yield (> 98%), and LOD after curing (< 1%). The drug release rate from the coated beads with different weight gains is shown in Fig. 4 . The drug release rate decreased, due to a longer drug diffusion path length, as the coating thickness increased as the weight gain increased from 3% w / w to 5% w / w . Based on the criteria defined by the QTPP of the ciprofloxacin HCl drug release profile and as per dissolution regulatory guidance (ICH Q6A), 3% w / w weight gain was deemed acceptable, and the dissolution specification of the final coated drug product was established for the different dissolution time points 1 h = 25–45%, 2 h = 46–66%, and 7 h = NLT 80%.

Response Surface Determination and Process Optimization
The central composite design points and responses are given in Table VI . In this section, the effect of the process variables given in Table VI on agglomeration, yield, and LOD will be discussed. The degree of particle agglomeration was found to be less than 2%, and this response can be attributed to the balance between the spray rate and the rate of heat and mass transfer, which lead to a drying efficiency that kept the beads from becoming tacky. Other factors contributing to generation of fewer agglomerates may include the larger bead size. The percent yield is directly correlated to the degree of agglomeration and final moisture content in the coated beads. It was observed that the batches coated at spraying temperatures of 44 and 46 °C demonstrated a slight degree of spray drying resulting in faster drug dissolution as explained below. We based our conclusion of spray drying on the combination of a faster release rate, lower process efficiency, and visual inspection of the filter bag. For these experiments, the filter bag was found to have a darker color indicating more coating polymer was deposited on the filter bag as compared to the other batches. Recall from Table I that color was used to help visualize the coating process; thus, if spray drying occurred the filter bags would have more coating material deposited on the bag and hence a darker color. In addition, the process efficiency of these batches was less, and when combined with quicker dissolution rates, we concluded that the faster dissolution was caused by spray drying. During the curing process, the residual surface water will start to evaporate until an equilibrium exists between the moisture present in the voids and surface moisture. The rate at which the water evaporates affects the extent of curing and the final quality of the film. Hence, LOD can be used as a marker to determine the amount of residual moisture present in the beads. The batches cured at different curing temperatures and times yielded LOD values ranging from 0.67 to 1.22%.

Using all the data from the response surface batches (see Table VI ), the main effects, interactions terms, and quadratic terms were calculated. The responses, percent drug released in 1 h (Y 3 ), percent drug released in 2 h (Y 4 ), and percent drug released in 7 h (Y 5 ) were all evaluated using two-factor interaction (2FI) model as shown in Table VII . The summary of the overall ANOVA factorial model with statistical analysis of the estimated main effects and interaction terms are as shown in Table VIII . The model and main effects, along with interaction terms, were deemed significant based on the values of “Prob > F” being less than 0.0500.

For the range of parameters studied, it was found that no significant amount of agglomeration occurred in any of the batches of the response surface study. Hence for the percent agglomeration none of the independent parameters X 1 –X 4 was deemed statistically significant for the ranges studied. Similarly, for the percent yield and LOD, none of the independent parameters X 1 –X 4 was deemed to be statistically significant. The summary of the overall model ANOVA predicted results are shown in Table IX . The PRESS (predicted residual error sum of squares), R-Squared, predicted R-squared, and adjusted R-squared was used to determine variance coverage by the model. The precision of the model was determined to ensure the signal is more than just noise. Table IX Overall Model ANOVA—Predicted Model Terms Responses Std. dev.

Effect of Curing Temperature, Time, and Humidity
In this study, the spraying temperature is the product temperature during the polymer spraying process, and the curing temperature is the product temperature during the curing process. The results obtained from the Pyrobutton® data loggers for the humidity changes provided insight into the dissolution rate of the coated beads, which is a key quality attribute for film formation. The humidity data monitored, especially from the coating zone (see Fig. 1 ), for both the spraying process and curing process, can be utilized to establish a process signature for the spraying and curing process and will be discussed later in this section. This process signature can be used as a part of the control strategy and provides valuable underlying process information that can be used as a fingerprint for the process.
Curing at 54 and 57 °C
In this section, the drug dissolution from response surface batches compared to the target batch manufactured at 3% w / w coating level (see Fig. 4 ) is discussed. The response surface batches were cured at five temperatures (see Table III and Fig. 5 ); this figure shows the spatial relationship between parameters in Table III . As seen in Fig. 6 a, regardless of the curing time processing conditions, the batches cured at 54 and 57 °C demonstrated faster drug release than the target batch that was cured at 60 °C, i.e. , the 3% w / w weight gain batch with a spraying temperature of 42 °C, an inlet air volume of 30 m 3 /h, a curing temperature of 60 °C, and a curing time of 4 h. This could be attributed to incomplete curing, i.e. , partial coalescence of the film due to suboptimal curing conditions, as discussed above. In addition, if the process efficiency, which is related to the spraying temperature, is also compromised as seen in Fig. 6 a open symbols, then DoE 1, DoE 19, DoE 21, and DoE 25 batches cured at 57 °C, although not a statistically significant difference, showed even faster dissolution compared to other DoE batches cured at the same curing temperature but coated at a lower spraying temperature, which had a higher process efficiency. All the that had a lower factorial point for curing temperature response surface batches (DoE 1, DoE 9, DoE 12, DoE 19, DoE 21, DoE 22, DoE 25, and DoE 30 open and closed symbols Figs. 5 and 6 ) cured at 57 °C demonstrated a statistically significant faster drug release at the 1- and 2-h dissolution time points than the target batch that was cured 60 °C. This can be attributed to incomplete film formation as explained earlier, and, in addition, to variable humidity conditions. Fig. 5 The spatial relationship between the design variables given in Tables III and VI Fig. 6 a Dissolution Profiles—cured@54 and 57 °C. b Dissolution time points data—cured@57 °C. c Dissolution profiles—cured@60 °C. d Dissolution time points data—cured@60 °C. e Dissolution profiles—cured@63 and 66 °C. f Dissolution time points data—cured@63 °C (All the dissolution time points data are for 1, 2, and 7 h). Note the Target batch was cured at 60 °C for 4 h and is included in the Figs. 6 as a point of reference
The effect of humidity can be seen in Figs. 6 b and 7 , where drug release at 1-, 2-, and 7-h dissolution time points for batches cured at curing temperature of 57 °C for either 2 or 4 h demonstrate varied dissolution profiles due to variable humidity level during spraying and curing stages, as explained earlier. The response surface batches DoE 19 and DoE 22 had a higher spraying and curing humidity level and demonstrated a slightly slower dissolution rate, due to the water facilitating film formation as described above; however, this moisture level was not enough to offset curing at a temperature too low for complete film formulation. In addition, the axial point’s response surface batch (Figs. 6 a and 7 ), cured at 54 °C (DoE 16) curing temperature and 3 h of curing time, demonstrated the fastest dissolution at the 1- and 2-h time points, because the curing temperature was suboptimal and below the temperature needed for film formation. Fig. 7 Effect of curing conditions on axial point response surface batches (dissolution time points—1, 2, and 7 h)
Curing at 60 °C
A completely cured polymer film ensures consistent drug release as shown by the 6 replicates at 3 h of curing and two samples cured at 1 and 5 h at the DoE center point, see Figs. 5 and 6 c. The fact that the center point (DoE 11, Doe 20, DoE 10, DoE 17, DoE 3, DoE 15, DoE 24, and DoE 7) batches do not show statistically significant differences despite the wide range in curing times indicates these batches are fully cured for the 60 °C curing temperature. Also, the two star points DoE 29 and DoE 14 with inlet air volumes of 26 and 34 m 3 /h, respectively, do not show statistically significant differences in dissolution rate. This confirms the model prediction that in the range of air volumes studied, air volume does not significantly affect process efficiency; Fig. 6 d shows these batches to be cured at approximately the same relative humidity. In contrast, the two star point batches DoE 28, the slowest release rate, and DoE 4, the fastest release rate were sprayed at 38 and 46 °C, respectively, do show significant differences, see Figs. 5 , 6c , and 7 shows that batches DoE 28 and 4 were coated at approximately the same relative humidity. These differences support the statistical analysis that spraying temperature is the primary factor affecting process efficiency, which is related to coating thickness and consequently release rate as discussed above. The impact of relative humidity as seen in Figs. 6d and 7 demonstrates that there is a slight difference in drug release for the dissolution time points 1 and 2 h from batches cured at 60 °C for 3 h of curing time. This could be attributed to low relative humidity during the spraying and curing process, thereby affecting both process efficiency and extent of curing; probably the extent of curing is affected to a lesser degree.
Curing at 63 and 66 °C
It can be seen in Fig. 6 e that batches cured at 63 °C have different dissolution profiles compared to the target batch cured at 60 °C. Figure 6 e, f provides insight into the behavior, batches (DoE 2, DoE 8, DoE 18 and DoE 27, open symbols in Figs. 5 and 6 e) that demonstrate faster dissolution. These batches were coated at a higher spraying temperature, 44 °C, and for the same reasons discussed above, we believe the results in these graphs indicate some degree of spray drying during the coating process. At a curing temperature of 63 °C the batches (DoE 5, DoE 6, DoE 13, DoE 23, closed symbols in Figs. 5 and 6 e) were coated at an optimum spraying temperature with better process efficiency. The better efficiency leads to a thicker coat, which slows drug release rate at the 1- and 2-h dissolution time points. The lack of difference between the circle and square symbols of Fig. 6 e supports the conclusion stated previously: in the range of parameters studied, the inlet air volume did not affect the drug dissolution rate. Also, the lack of difference in dissolution rate between the open green and orange symbols and the closed green and orange symbols, in Fig. 6 e, indicates that at a curing temperature of 63 °C, the films are fully formed in 1 h, because for a given spraying temperature, the curing time, either 1 or 4 h, did not affect the release rate.
For the DoE 2 batch, which was cured at 63 °C and spray coated at 44 °C, the spraying and curing humidity was also low (Fig. 6 f), and this batch had the fastest dissolution rate, as described above. This supports the theory that having an adequate humidity level is important for film formation. Similarly, DoE 8, DoE 18, and DoE 27, cured at 63 °C and coated at 44 °C, had a higher humidity than DoE 2, DoE 5, and DoE 6, which resulted in dissolution results meeting the specification limits. In the response surface batches, it can be concluded that the humidity effect is pronounced only when adequate polymer level is achieved and curing conditions like curing temperature and curing time are optimized. The response surface batch cured at 66 °C (DoE 26) and cured for 3 h demonstrated among the lowest dissolution rates at the 1- and 2-h time point (see Figs. 6 e and 7 ), even though the absolute humidity was found to be moderate but still suboptimal.
Statistical Analysis
For the range of parameter studies, the ANOVA found the 2FI linear model was the best model for predicting percent drug released in 1, 2, and 7 h; the significant independent variables for percent drug released in 1 and 2 h were spraying temperature (X 2 ), curing temperature (X 3 ), and curing time (X 4 ). The spraying temperature dictates the process efficiency of the coating process; curing temperature and time dictates the extent of film formation. As the humidity during the coating process could only be monitored, it was not included as a factor in the response surface design. However, it was evaluated outside of the DoE and its impact was studied in conjunction with the other CPP as discussed above. For the percent drug released in 7 h, only the spraying temperature (X 2 ) and curing temperature (X 3 ) were significant.
The contour plot for the percent drug released in 1 h (Fig. 8 a) with curing time of 4 h suggests that dissolution was faster outside the upper range of specification limit of 45% when the spraying temperature was above ~42 °C and curing temperature was lower than ~ 59 °C, and dissolution was found to be slower outside the lower specification limit of 25% when the spraying temperature was below 39 °C and curing temperature was above 61 °C. Similarly, the contour plot for the percent drug released in 2 h (Fig. 8 c ) with curing time set at 4 h suggests that the dissolution was faster outside the upper range of specification limit of 66% when the spraying temperature was above 41 °C and curing temperature was lower than 59 °C, while the dissolution was found to be slower outside the lower specification limit of 46% when the spraying temperature was below 38 °C and the curing temperature was above 61 °C. The contour plot for the percent drug released in 7 h (Fig. 8 d) with curing time set at 4 h suggest that the dissolution specification of NLT 80% was achieved when the spraying temperature was within range of 38–46 °C, and the curing temperature was between 57 and 61 °C.

Figure 8 b, d, e, shows the predictive model for the 1-, 2-, and 7-h dissolution time points, respectively, comparing the observed vs. predicted values. The coded predictive equation for the percent drug released in 1 h, percent drug released in 2 h, and percent drug released in 7 h are listed in Eqs. 10 , 11 , and 12 , respectively: $$ {\mathrm{Y}}_3=+45.41+{0.46}^{\ast }\ {\mathrm{X}}_1+{6.31}^{\ast }\ {\mathrm{X}}^2-{13.52}^{\ast }\ {\mathrm{X}}_3\hbox{--} {1.68}^{\ast }\ {\mathrm{X}}_4+{2.34}^{\ast }\ {\mathrm{X}}_1\ {\mathrm{X}}_3+{4.78}^{\ast }\ {\mathrm{X}}_2{\mathrm{X}}_3 $$ (10) $$ {\mathrm{Y}}_4=+67.10+{1.06}^{\ast }\ {\mathrm{X}}_1+{6.87}^{\ast }\ {\mathrm{X}}_2-{13.77}^{\ast }\ {\mathrm{X}}_3-{1.51}^{\ast }\ {\mathrm{X}}_4+{1.93}^{\ast }\ {\mathrm{X}}_1\ {\mathrm{X}}_3+{5.99}^{\ast }\ {\mathrm{X}}_2{\mathrm{X}}_3-{1.84}^{\ast }\ {\mathrm{X}}_3{\mathrm{X}}_4 $$ (11) $$ {\mathrm{Y}}_5=+94.50+{0.73}^{\ast }\ {\mathrm{X}}_1+{3.26}^{\ast }\ {\mathrm{X}}_2-{5.85}^{\ast }\ {\mathrm{X}}_3-{0.05}^{\ast }\ {\mathrm{X}}_4+{3.53}^{\ast }\ {\mathrm{X}}_2\ {\mathrm{X}}_3-{1.29}^{\ast }\ {\mathrm{X}}_3{\mathrm{X}}_4 $$ (12) where Y 3 = percent drug released in 1 h, Y 4 = percent drug released in 2 h and Y 5 = percent drug released in 7 h; X 1 = air volume, X 2 = spraying temperature, X 3 = curing temperature, and X 4 = curing time.
The equations show that the curing temperature had the largest contribution, followed by spraying temperature. It was found for all three dissolution time points that drug release was faster when spraying temperature was high (potential for spray drying due to creation of dry environment), curing temperature was low (as described in the introduction, low curing temperatures can lead to incomplete film coalescence), curing time was low (not enough time for the particle deformation), and when both spraying temperature and curing temperature were at high level. In addition to the above factors, the hidden variable that can have significant impact on quality film formation is the humidity in and around the coating zone. If humidity is low and not adequate during the curing condition, then rigid particles are formed due to non-deformation and faster evaporation of water from the polymer core to the surface.
Design Space Determination Using Least Square Regression
After mapping the response surfaces using 2FI linear models and elucidating the effect of processing conditions, the next step is to use these models to establish the design space. For example, in Fig. 8 a, c, d, the design space for spraying temperature and curing temperature would be the set of points in which the dissolution specification of 25–45% released in 1 h, 46–66% released in 2 h, and NLT 80% released in 7 h would be met. This can be determined by overlaying the contour plots from Fig. 8 a, c, d to find the points that meet the QTPP specification for all three time points utilizing a confidence interval of 95%. Figure 9 a–c display the design space overlay contour plots at different levels of air volume at 4 h of curing. The contour lines are the interval estimates for each of the specified criteria, and it can be seen from the overlay contour plots that the grayed out area is the undesirable region where none of the design criteria were met and the light yellow regions are where some of the design criteria are met. The dark yellow region is the optimal region where all the design criteria are met. Hence, it is always desirable to utilize the optimal region of operation, which was further confirmed using the desirability function as explained earlier. The red dots are the factorial points used in the response surface design (see Table VII ). The results clearly show that the optimal region of the design space is enclosed within the factorial point, i.e. , below 61 °C and above 59 °C curing temperature with spraying temperature range from 38 to 40 °C; the dissolution results for 1- and 2-h time points fall outside the specification limits set using 95% CI. Similarly, with spraying temperature range from 43 to 44 °C and the curing temperature at 62 and 58 °C, both fall outside the dissolution specification, with the latter being more significant. As similar design space results were observed for the CPP at different levels of air volume, for the optimal region of the design space, the midpoint of the air volume was selected. Therefore, based on the results of the response surface design shown in the design space overlay plot, the best solutions of the final design space were determined using the desirability function to confirm the design space findings shown in Fig. 9 d.

Design Space Determination Using Monte Carlo
The principal results of the simulations using SUR models with Gibbs sampled MCMC (SUR-MCMC) show a close agreement with the classical multivariate regression modeling alone. For example, the two-stage modeling, SUR-MCMC, identified the same significant coefficients in the multivariate models. The SUR-MCMC analyses provided standard errors of the regression coefficients ( β ) that are smaller than those estimated by the multiple regression analyses (not shown). This difference is most likely due to the exclusion of terms in the SUR-MCMC approach that were significant in the interval, 0.05 < p ≤ 0.1. Only the “ p ≤ 0.1” terms were included in the multivariate statistical models.
In our view, a compelling rationale for Bayesian posterior of the proposed design space is the mapping of the multivariate confidence regions such as presented by Peterson and colleagues ( ). Most standard statistical approaches in DoE rely on assumptions about the normal distributions underlying the data. Indeed, response surface methods even artificially “center” the model. By using MCMC sampling of the posterior distribution ( i.e. , a design space), a more realistic view of the potentially complex confidence region can be constructed. Unexpectedly with respect to demonstrating the utility of the method, the present results revealed only a relatively simple posterior design space that could be sufficiently covered under assumptions of normality approximations such as the Box-Hunter confidence regions ( ) or using desirability methods.
FDA guidance refers to model-free methods for dissolution that recommend an acceptance criterion (f2 similarity) based on comparing three dissolution measurements with corresponding points from a “target” dissolution profile. The SUR-MCMC method offers a convenient alternative means of modeling groups of three or more dissolution time points in the absence of assumptions about the underlying kinetic models ( e.g. , Weibull models). Moreover, the entire sampled dissolution curve can readily be tested using the method (Fig. 10 ). We used an acceptance criterion f2 ≥ 50 for three times ( t = 1, 2 and 7 h) and f2 ≥ 50 for all times ( t 1, 2,…,7 h). Sampling the coefficients and the sigma matrix for all seven points was done in up to 35 independent Markov chains. Fig. 10 SUR-MCMC estimates and 95% credible intervals for dissolution for an acceptance criterion, f2 ≥ 50. The Gibbs-sampled MCMC estimates for dissolution are shown (diamonds) with the target dissolution (squares). The error bars show the range of 95% of the samples for each time point
The assumptions in SUR modeling include having a different subset of the regressors among the simultaneous equations. Otherwise, the SUR model reduces to an ordinary least squares simultaneous “stacked” equations. Although the regressor terms were nearly equivalent for each time point including curing temperature, curing time and their interaction term in all seven equations; nevertheless, the cross-equation covariance was different enough for use in the SUR model. This is observed in the cross-equation correlation before and after the MCMC (Table X ). The results in Table X shows the impact on fitting dissolution of reducing the standard errors regression coefficients using MCMC and the acceptance criterion, f2 ≥ 50. Note also that the average of the samples for each time point is slightly greater than the target value due to the effect of sampling below as well as above the acceptance criterion. Table X Upper Cross-Model Correlation Matrix for Dissolution Before and After MCMC Sampling 1 h 2 h 3 h 4 h 5 h 6 h 7 h Cross-model correlation matrix for 7 dissolution time points—SUR method 1 h 1 0.918 0.759 0.587 0.466 0.390 0.323 2 h 1 0.938 0.837 0.750 0.689 0.630 3 h 1 0.969 0.921 0.879 0.821 4 h 1 0.985 0.960 0.911 5 h 1 0.992 0.959 6 h 1 0.978 7 h 1 After Gibbs—sampled MCMC 1 h 1 0.910 0.740 0.560 0.440 0.350 0.280 2 h 1 0.930 0.830 0.740 0.670 0.610 3 h 1 0.970 0.920 0.870 0.810 4 h 1 0.980 0.960 0.910 5 h 1 0.990 0.960 6 h 1 0.980 7 h 1
The SUR-MCMC procedure may be used to explore other acceptance criteria that might be extended to process parameters. For example, setting narrow acceptance limits around each target dissolution value might be used to explore narrower ranges of “acceptable” process parameters (as regressors). For example, Table XI shows results of a typical experiment in which the acceptance criteria were that “all three” or “all seven” dissolution values were within 90 to 110% of the target value. The results in Table XI show that the three- or seven-way joint probabilities are substantially less likely to occur than the case of all seven dissolution times meeting the f2 ≥ 50 criterion. The results also show, by comparing various groups of three times, that this method might provide a convenient means of testing combinations of three time points when seeking an optimal choice of dissolution times. Table XI Estimated Probabilities of Acceptance for Various Combinations of Dissolution Times Dissolution time points (h) Acceptance criteria 90–110% of each target dissolution f2 ≥ 50 1,2,7 0.140 0.510 1,3,5 0.253 0.725 2,4,6 0.390 0.730 1,…,7 0.020 1.000
Finally, as Peterson ( ) noted, the large number of MCMC samples can be accumulated once for testing various posterior estimates under different proposed constraints or criteria ( e.g. , such as those in Table XI ). Additionally, regularly spaced grids of the X s have been used to ensure adequate coverage of the proposed posterior design space. In this work, we examined both discrete, gridded independent variables and random sampling using uniform or other distributions that could provide coverage of the design space. Although we find equal success for estimating the design space parameters from SUR-MCMC, it is important to note the limitations of this approach, particularly with respect to exercises like exploring the “point of failure.” Here, investigators using DoE methods are tempted to extrapolate their models beyond the data. Such tests require re-scaling or renormalization of the data in order to interpret the results. For example, as the independent variable “space” expands, the proportion of the space “covered” by a fixed model will decline in relative terms. Figure 11 shows the impact on reducing the probability of success ( i.e. , f2 ≥ 50) that expanding the scale of the independent terms ( X s) has without rescaling the grid for coverage. The most obvious choice is to remain within the original design limits, e.g. , [− 1, 1]. If the probability of acceptance, here using f2 ≥ 50 as the criterion, is to be used as a measure of reliability, then the limits of the sampling should agree with the study design or otherwise be adjusted to represent different bounds and coverage of the design space. Fig. 11 Proportion of samples for “f2 ≥ 50” depends on the assigned range of independent variables (air volume, product temp, cure temp, cure time)
Model Prediction Verification
To test the models, a completely independent confirmatory batch was manufactured at 3% w / w weight gain, utilizing the Mycrolab® and the same formulation composition and optimal setting of the design space for the processing parameters mapped using the 2FI model. One of the proposed solutions from the desirability function with value close to one from the overlay design space was utilized for manufacturing the confirmatory batch (microclimate = 0.2, atomization pressure = 0.8 bar, air volume = 29 m 3 /h, spraying temperature = 41 °C, curing temperature = 60 °C, and curing time = 4 h). The response surface predictive model dissolution results for the responses Y 3 , Y 4 , and Y 5 compared to the actual batch dissolution results were found to be similar (Fig. 12 ). This helps to confirm the robustness of the response surface model to predict dissolution results for the 1-, 2-, and 7-h dissolution time points. Fig. 12 Predicted vs. observed dissolution time point comparison for batches manufactured using optimal setting from the design space for the CPP
Scale-Up Batches
The scale-up batches were conducted to see how the design space changed with manufacturing scale and to assess the robustness of the design space established using small-scale batches. Between the two approaches utilized to determine the design space, we used the more sensitive and conservative response surface methodology rather than the Bayesian approach. The scale-up work was conducted in two stages, preliminary batches followed by process-ranging batches. The main objectives of the preliminary batches were to confirm the coating level, i.e. , 3% w / w , thereby assessing the effect of going from one scale to another within the same equipment class on process efficiency and to evaluate the factorial points of the response design for the process parameters in the design space. This information was crucial for determining the process ranges for the confirmatory batches, so that the design space established using the response surface small-scale batches can be confirmed and updated depending on the outcome of the dissolution results from these batches. The confirmatory batches were manufactured in two blocks; the first block utilized the design space information of the CPP from the response surface batches, and the second block utilized intermediate points for the CPP between the two design spaces established. This approach was taken to challenge the existing statistical design space and further update based on the outcome of the dissolution data. The two blocks exploring the design space of the CPP, i.e. , spraying temperature and curing temperature, consisted of four factorial points (high-high, low-low, high-low and low-high) and one center point.
The Mycrolab confirmatory batch and Unilab preliminary batch, manufactured using 3% w / w coating level and optimal processing conditions, demonstrated superimposed dissolution profiles signifying that the process efficiency of the disk-jet technology going from the Mycrolab scale to the Unilab scale was the same (Fig. 13 a). The three preliminary batches manufactured at different spraying temperature/curing temperature as shown in Fig. 13 b suggest that there was no significant difference in dissolution profiles between 3 and 4 h of curing time. The target batch (41 °C ST/60 °C CT) manufactured using the optimal setting for the CPP was the coating level confirmation batch demonstrating similar dissolution profile as that of the target profile. The slow dissolution demonstrated by the low ST/high CT batch sprayed at 38 °C and cured at 63 °C could be attributed to adequate amount of polymer deposition on the drug-layered beads followed by formation of fully dense film. On the other end, the high ST/ low CT batch, sprayed at 44 °C and cured at 57 °C, demonstrated faster drug release partially due to spray drying of the polymer during spraying and incomplete film formation during curing. The percent released at 1, 2, and 7 h for the target, slower and faster drug release preliminary batches is shown in Fig. 13 c; this information from these preliminary batches was used to determine the confirmatory batches’ process range. The spread of the dissolution profiles and individual dissolution time points from the two blocks are shown in Fig. 13 d, e; these batches were utilized to check the validity and robustness of the design space of the CPP. The batch manufactured using spraying/curing temperature 43/58 °C demonstrated fastest release followed by a batch manufactured at 43/62 °C compared to all other batches. Based upon our observation of darker color in the Unilab filter bag and low process efficiency, we concluded the reason for faster release can be attributed to slight spray drying encountered during the spraying process leading to insufficient deposition of polymer on the drug-layered beads, plus incomplete film formation during the lower-temperature curing period. As part of the risk assessment, the lot-to-lot variability of the polymer dispersion system was evaluated for batches manufactured using the optimal process setting; this was done because lot-to-lot variability can significantly impact the amount of polymer deposited. The results shown in Fig. 13 f demonstrate all batches’ f2 values above 50, thereby signifying the reproducibility of the polymer dispersion system.

Final Design Space and Process Signature
The characterization of the coating process was performed utilizing the CPP ranges established from small-scale and pilot-scale batches. The range of CPP studied can be divided into three distinct regions: experimental range, control space/extended design space, and operating range/design space as shown in Fig. 14 . The batches manufactured outside of the control space range will yield dissolution results outside the specification limits and is used as a warning signal. The batches manufactured in the control space region will yield dissolution results within the specification limits if utilized with in-process controls or feedback and feed forward mechanism, and the batches manufactured in the operating range will always yield dissolution results within the specification limits as this range is verified for robustness. The ciprofloxacin HCl drug-layered beads coated at 3% w / w weight gain using the formulation composition and processing conditions listed in this paper yielded design space for the spraying temperature from 39 to 42 °C and curing temperature from 59 to 62 °C with curing time deemed as 4 h. Fig. 14 Final design space depicting the experimental range, control space (extended design space) and operating range (design space) of the coating process for the critical process parameters
Both the response surface method and the SUR-MCMC approaches predicted consistently greater, but not statistically significant, dissolution than was observed. Both methods were suitable for computations using three or more dissolution points or even the entire set of seven time points. Although the quantitative results from the two approaches were similar, a direct comparison of posterior design space limits suggests that the response surface method was slightly more conservative (Fig. 14 ), likely as a consequence of its underlying assumptions about normal distribution of residuals. In addition, apparent conservatism and greater ease of use of dedicated statistical DoE software is likely to continue to affect analysts’ favor for classical statistical design space methods as opposed to Bayesian methods.
CONCLUSIONS
A design space for the CPP was successfully built using statistical response surface methodology and a Bayesian approach. It can be concluded that the design space established using statistical response surface was more conservative than the Bayesian approach. The coating process was optimized with spraying temperature, curing temperature, and curing time deemed as the CPP and 2FI model was utilized to map the response surface for drug released in 1, 2, and 7 h. The robustness of the design space derived from response surface methodology was validated across scale using process ranging scale-up batches. Overall, the quality by design approach proved to be useful to build quality in the final drug product by thoroughly understanding the coating process for process optimization, and to build design space systematically using response surface methodology.
