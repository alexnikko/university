Introduction
Although valproic acid (VPA) is an effective anti-epileptic drug, it is well known to be teratogenic to the developing cardiovascular system in humans and experimental animals [ , , , ]. VPA mainly causes transposition of the great vessels and ventricular septal defects, as well as cardiac valve atresia, double-outlet right ventricle, and hypoplastic left heart syndrome in rodents [ , ]. VPA is a well-known human teratogen. Exposure of VPA during the pregnancy is associated with approximately threefold increase in the rate of major anomalies. Interestingly, several anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) including VPA can interfere with cell surface receptor binding to folic acid (FA) and reduce the absorption or metabolism for FA [ ]. Therefore, it is highly recommended to treat women on AEDs at preconception and in the first 2–3 months of pregnancy with FA that protects human fetal VPA syndrome [ ]. A previous report showed that 26 % of patients with fetal VPA syndrome had cardiovascular abnormalities—most frequently in the form of ventricular septal defects, aortic or pulmonary stenosis, and persistent ductus arteriosus [ ]. Despite its potential to induce teratogenicity, VPA is widely prescribed to women of childbearing age with epilepsy. Preventing the teratogenicity caused by VPA is the physician’s responsibility. However, the pathogenesis of VPA-induced cardiovascular abnormalities is currently unknown, which makes this goal difficult to achieve.
Glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) regulates many cellular processes including metabolism, gene transcription, protein translation, cell-cycle regulation, cytoskeletal organization, and apoptosis [ ]. GSK3β is an active serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylates cellular substrates, including β-catenin. GSK3β plays an important role in regulating cardiac development. Higher incidences of congenital heart defect infants have been reported in pregnant women exposed to the mood-stabilizing drug lithium, the inhibitor of GSK3β [ , , ].
GSK3-overexpressing transgenic mice have the postnatal cardiomyocyte growth impairments and abnormal cardiac contractile functions phenotypes [ ]. The results from previous studies also demonstrated that GSK3β modulates left–right asymmetry and affects heart positioning [ ]. All of these findings implicate that GSK3β impacts the development of the heart [ , ]. However, GSK3α and GSK3β play the distinct roles during zebrafish cardiogenesis [ ].
Various stages of heart development, such as heart-tube formation, chamber formation, looping, and left–right asymmetry, are essential to study cardiac teratogenicity. Zebrafish ( Brachydanio rerio ) have a two-chambered heart that is genetically similar to the three- or four-chambered hearts of higher vertebrates [ , ], and they are an excellent animal model for cardiac research [ , , , ]. In this study, we constructed a 1.6-kb regulatory region of the cardiac myosin light chain-2 gene ( cmlc 2) of zebrafish. It shows specifically driven green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression in the heart of the transgenic zebrafish [ ]. This enables direct morphological and functional observation of the cardiac conditions at different stages of development. Similar morphological cardiac abnormalities between GSK and VPA were observed. GSK3β is significant for regulating many processes of cardiac development [ , , , ]. Whether GSK3β phosphorylation plays a role in VPA-induced cardiac teratogenicity remains to be explored. In this study, we investigated the teratogenic effects of VPA on cardiac development and the role of FA in rescuing the toxic effects of VPA. Results from this study show that inhibiting the phosphorylation of serine 9 in GSK3β is an important mechanism associated with VPA-induced cardiac teratogenicity, which can be rescued by FA.
Methods
Gene Construct, Gene Transfer, and Germ Lines of Transgenic Fish
Plasmid pICMLE, in which the upstream sequence [870 base pairs (bp)], exon 1 (39 bp), intron 1 (682 bp), and part of exon 2 (69 bp) of the zebrafish cmlc 2 were fused with GFP cDNA [ ], was linearized with Not I and microinjected into the zygotes at a concentration of 25 ng/nL. The procedures of microinjection and germ-line screening were described previously by Huang et al. [ ]. Heterozygotic embryos of zebrafish derived from the transgenic line A34 of Tg ( cmlc 2 :GFP ) were used in this study.
Experimental Fish and Embryos
Wild-type zebrafish and transgenic line A34 were cultured and maintained according to procedures described by Westerfield [ ]. All experiments on animals have been approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan. Heterozygotic embryos with heart-derived GFP from homozygotic parental individuals crossed with the wild-type strain were selected for this study. The developmental stages were determined according to criteria described by Kimmel et al. [ ].
Administration of Valproic Acid and Folic Acid
VPA concentrations [0.1 (group A) and 0.25 mM (group B)] used in this experiment were calculated on the basis of a person weighing 60 kg, receiving the empirical clinical dosage of VPA for treating a patient with epilepsy, which is either 1000 or 2500 mg. Embryos were kept in water for 10 h postfertilization (hpf) until they developed, after which they were treated with VPA (0.1 mH or 0.25 mM). The embryos treated with VPA (0.1 mM) were divided into two groups: group A1 continued to receive VPA (0.1 mM/day) for 3 days, after which treatment with VPA was discontinued, and group A2 continued to receive VPA (0.1 mM/day) for 6 days. Group B received only one dose of VPA (0.25 mM) at 10 hpf because all embryos that received VPA at 0.25 mM/day for 3 days died as a result of this high dose.
For the rescue experiment, the 10-hpf embryos were treated with FA (0.03 or 0.2 μM/day) in the presence of VPA (0.1 mM/day) for 6 days. FA concentrations (0.03 and 0.2 μM) were calculated on the basis of a person weighing 60 kg and receiving either 0.8 or 5.0 mg of FA. Control embryos were derived from the same germ line and were treated with neither VPA nor FA.
Morphological Evaluations
Cardiac development and morphogenesis were observed at 10 hpf, and cardiac measurements were analyzed at 3 and 6 days postfertilization (dpf). The cardiac development of zebrafish is described briefly as follows: at the 5-somite stage (12 hpf), the myocardial progenitors appear as oval-shaped groups located on either side of the embryonic axis. The primitive myocardial tubes have fused to form a definite heart tube at 22 hpf. Subsequently, visibly distinct atrial and ventricular chambers form at approximately 30 hpf. The heart undergoing looping morphogenesis completes this process at approximately 36 hpf [ ]. Therefore, VPA was added at 10 hpf to study its teratogenic effect on heart development. The strategy for drug administration is shown schematically in Fig. 1 . Fig. 1 Schematic strategy for the administration of valproic acid and folic acid
Functional Evaluation: Video File Capture and Processing
The lens adaptor of a stereomicroscope was connected to a digital camera. The LCD monitor of the camera was turned on and connected to the computer with an Ulead Video Studio 7.0 system (Ulead Inc., Taipei, Taiwan). The image was captured for 10 s and recorded as an audio video interleave (AVI) file in the computer. The AVI file was then converted sequentially to a bitmap (bmp) file, according to a previously described method [ ]. One bmp file contained one frame of cardiac motion. The cardiac motion was viewed frame by frame to define the systolic and diastolic phases. An area with the most uniform fluorescent distribution was selected, and the region of the fluorescent heart to be analyzed was marked. The ventricular volume was calculated using the formula for a prolate spheroid: $${\text{Volume}} = 4/3 \times \pi \times a \times b^{2}$$ a and b are the long and short radii of the ventricle, respectively (Fig. 2 ). The cardiac ejection fraction was calculated using the following formula: $${\text{Cardiac ejection fraction}} = \left( {{\text{cardiac diastolic volume}}{-}{\text{cardiac systolic volume}}} \right)/{\text{cardiac diastolic volume}}.$$ Fig. 2 Parameters of the ventricle. Ventricular volume is calculated using the formula for a prolate spheroid: Volume = 4/3 × π × a × b 2 , where a and b are the long and short radii of the ventricle, respectively
Western Blot
The lysate extracts of the cardiac myocytes, H2C9 cells (ATCC), were prepared in direct solubilized by 10 % SDS. After full-speed centrifugation for 1 min in a microcentrifuge to remove insoluble particles, samples were loaded on a 12 % SDS gel. Antibodies used were rabbit anti-GSK3β (pSer 9 ) (Sigma 1:2000), mouse anti-GSK3β (Sigma 1:2000), anti-GSK3β (pTyr 279/216 1:2000), and anti-α-tubulin (Sigma 1:3000).
The trans-blotting membrane was blocked by immersion in a blocking reagent (4 % w/v nonfat milk and normal goat serum 1:2000 dilution in TTBS) for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was incubated with primary antibody in 1:5000 dilution in a blocking reagent at 4 °C overnight after gentle shaking. The primary antibody solution was then removed, and the membrane was washed with TTBS three times at 15-min intervals. The secondary antibody (peroxidase-conjugated AffiniPure goat Anti-mouse IgG or peroxidase-conjugated AffiniPure goat Anti-rabbit IgG) was diluted in blocking reagent, added to cover the membrane, and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature on the shaker. At the end of the incubation period, the secondary antibody solution was removed, and the membrane was washed three times with TTBS at 15-min intervals.
Immunohistochemical Staining
The OCT frozen sections were prefixed with 3.7 % paraformaldehyde in PBS for 5 min and permeabilized with 0.25 % Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. Then, these sections were postfixed with 3.7 % paraformaldehyde in PBS for 5 min. Finally, these sections were washed with PBS 3–5 times at 5-min intervals then blocked with blocking solution (4 % BSA and 1 % normal goat serum in PBS) for 2 h at room temperature. The sections were incubated with primary antibodies at 1:100 dilution in a blocking solution at 4 °C overnight. The primary antibody solution was removed, and cells were washed with PBS in 50 ml volume five times at 15-min intervals.
The FTIC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies were diluted 100-fold, and the Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies were diluted 200-fold in blocking solution and further stained with secondary antibody solution for 1–2 h at room temperature, in the dark. The nuclei were stained with DAPI for 30 min at room temperature. The sections were washed with PBS (100 ml) eight times at 15-min intervals. Cover slips were mounted with mounting solution (Slowfade Light Antifade Kit) on glass slides and sealed with nail polish. Slides were stored in the dark at 4 °C.
Cardiomyocyte H9C2 Cell Scratch Assay
The scratch assays were performed with cardiac myocyte H9C2 cells grown in DMEM post mixed 24 h and 200-μl pipette tip to scratch the culture plate. The scratch-edged migratory cells were observed in the presence and absence of VPA and FA for 16 and 24 h.
Statistical Analysis
All data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation. Statistical differences between groups were examined using the Fisher exact test or the Student t test. P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. ANOVA was used to evaluate the differences in cardiac measurements among groups. The Chi-square test was used to calculate the statistical significance of different cardiac morphogenetic outcomes in zebrafish under different dosages of VPA or FA.
Results
VPA-Induced Defective Cardiac Morphology and Function in Zebrafish
Cardiac morphology and functions were examined in the fluorescent heart of zebrafish embryos (Table 1 ). Compared to the control group, 78 % (18/23) of the embryos from group A (0.1 mM VPA) had type 1 phenotype. The remaining 22 % (5/23) from group A had type 2 phenotype. No significant differences in cardiac sizes (diastolic and systolic phase) between the control and group A were observed (Table 2 ). Embryos that were treated with VPA (0.1 mM) exhibited no significant differences, compared to the control with respect to cardiac functions such as end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volumes, and ventricular ejection fraction. Nevertheless, a significant slowing of the heart rate was found in the VPA-treated (0.1 mM) group, compared to the control ( P < 0.001). For the embryos in group B (0.25 mM VPA), 8 % (2/24) had a type 1 phenotype at 3 dpf and 92 % (22/24) had type 3 phenotype (Table 1 ). At 6 dpf, fluid accumulation in the pericardial sac (Fig. 3 ), noncontracting ventricles, and elongated or enlarged, slowly beating atriums were observed.

Fluid accumulation in the pericardial sac in embryos treated with 0.25 mM valproic acid (group B, lower six photos), as indicated by the arrows . Compared with group A (upper six photos), VPA can elicit cardiac looping defect
Of the 18 zebrafish embryos in group A with a type 1 phenotype, nine embryos (subgroup A1) continued to receive VPA (0.1 mM/day) for 3 days, and of this group, one fish died before 6 dpf. The remaining nine embryos (subgroup A2) were treated continuously with VPA up to 6 dpf. Three zebrafish in subgroup 2 died before 6 dpf.
At 6 dpf, a significantly dilated heart chamber, increased ventricular ejection fraction, and bradycardia were found in subgroup A2, compared to the control ( P < 0.05, Table 2 ). The heart rate was restored to normal after cessation of VPA treatment in subgroup A1 (Table 2 ). In addition, the trimension of the ventricle was greater in the embryos in subgroup A2 (145 ± 7 µm) than those in the control group (55 ± 10 µm) at 6 dpf ( P = 0.03).
Valproic Acid-Induced Heart Defects Reversed by Folic Acid
As shown in Table 3 , the cardiac morphological abnormalities were reversed in embryos treated with FA (0.03 or 0.2 μM) in the presence of VPA (0.1 mM). Embryos treated with the low concentration of FA (0.03 μM) showed a pattern of cardiac morphogenesis that included 33 % (2/6) normal looping, 50 % (3/6) type 1 phenotype, and 17 % (1/6) type 2 phenotype. These results were significantly different from those of embryos treated with VPA alone (0.1 mM) ( P < 0.05, Fig. 4 , upper panel). In embryos treated with the higher concentration of FA (0.2 μM), the pattern of cardiac morphogenesis was significantly enhanced to 83 % (5/6) normal looping and 17 % (1/6) type 1 phenotype, compared to those treated with VPA (0.1 mM) ( P < 0.001, Fig. 4 lower panel).

Table 4 shows cardiac function measurements after treatment with VPA and FA. VPA-induced bradycardia was partially reversed by treatment with FA (both 0.03 and 0.2 μΜ) at 3 dpf ( P < 0.001). At 6 dpf, the VPA-induced bradycardia and enlargement of the end-diastolic long diameter were completely reversed, and cardiac function returned to normal after treatment with FA (0.03 and 0.2 μΜ) (Table 4 ).

VPA Alters the Serine Phosphorylation State of GSK3β in Cardiomyocyte Cultures
The Western blot analysis with the antibodies (anti-GSK3β pSer-9, anti-GSK3β pTyr279/216, and anti-GSK3β) and the total cell extracts from the cardiac myocytes H2C9 cells culture were treated with VPA or added the addition of FA. The results demonstrated that VPA can inhibit the trimer of GSK3β serine 9 residue phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5 a) and FA can rescue the GSK3β pSer-9 phosphorylation level (Fig. 5 a). No dramatic alteration of the phosphorylation level of GSK3β pTyr279/216 (Fig 5 b) was observed. The total level of GSK3β appeared varied due to the complexities of the trimerization and degradation of the GSK3β (Fig. 5 c). Our Western blots are performed not for quantification, just for semiquantification. The trimer decreases 2–3 times with VPA and then rescues 1.5–2 times with addition of FA (Fig. 5 a). The biological consequences and activities of GSK3β trimer are interesting novel observations in this study, and the role of the GSK3β trimer in cardiac looping will potentially be studied further. Fig. 5 Effects of valproic acid (VPA) on the phosphorylation of serine and tyrosine (Tyr 279/216 ) in GSK3β of cardiomyocytes. Panel A dose-dependent inhibition of the phosphorylation of serine 9 in GSK3β by VPA was noted. This inhibition was partially reversed by folic acid (FA). The reversal was most prominent under 0.25 mM VPA and 0.189 μΜ FA. Panel B the phosphorylation of Tyr 279/216 in GSK3β was not affected by VPA. Panel C the total expression level of GSK3β under different levels of VPA and FA. The total expression level of GSK3β appears varied due to the complexities of the trimerization and degradation of the GSK3β
Immunochemical Staining of GSK3β and Phosphorylation of Ser 9 of GSK3β In Vivo
To demonstrate that VPA can decrease the GSK3β pSer 9 phosphorylation level, perturb cardiomyocyte migration, and interfere with normal heart-chamber development in vivo, the zebrafish embryo was treated with VPA and then the phenotype was rescued by the addition of FA. From immunofluorescence staining using anti-GSK3β phospho-Ser 9 (FITC) and anti-GSK3β (Texas Red), the mass migration and proliferation of cardiomyocytes (jelly-like cells) were observed in the development of the heart-valve region (as indicated by the circled area) for the untreated control group (Fig. 6 ). The notable reduction in the anti-GSK3β phospho-Ser 9 FITC signal in the VPA-treated group indicates that the migration and proliferation of cardiac jelly-like cells were perturbed by the treatment of VPA (Fig. 6 ). Experiments to rescue the phenotype were performed by the addition of FA (0.03 μM), and the increase in anti-GSK3β phospho-Ser 9 activities was recovered significantly, increasing the migration and in-growth of cardiac jelly-like cells (Fig. 6 ). As expected, anti-GSK3β phospho-Ser 9 activity was almost completely inhibited in the group treated with a high dose of VPA, and the migration and in-growth of a small number of cardiac jelly-like cells were detected (Fig. 6 ). Fig. 6 Zebrafish embryo was examined under fluorescent microscope (×100; expressed by a small frame ), and the cardiac area was observed (×400; yellow circle ). The first column shows phosphorylation of serine 9 (SER 9 ) in GSK3β with green color . The second column shows the total expression level of GSK3β with red color . The third column shows the merging of green and red colors . The phosphorylation of serine 9 in GSK3β was reduced by 0.1 mM valproic acid (VPA). Cardiomyocyte proliferation was perturbed, and cardiac chamber formation was incomplete. The addition of folic acid (FA) can partially rescue the phosphorylation of serine 9 in GSK3β. Restoration of cardiac chamber formation was noted. Under 0.5 mM VPA, the phosphorylation of serine 9 in GSK3β and the total expression GSK3β were blocked. No chamber formation was noted (Color figure online)
Scratch Assay for Valproic Acid and Folic Acid in Cardiac Myocytes
Cardiac myocyte H9C2 cell motility inhibition by VPA was recapitulated by cardiac myocyte cell culture scratch assay. The data demonstrated that the presence of 0.1 or 0.25 mM VPA can efficiently inhibit H9C2 cell migration from the scratched edge (Fig. 7 ). There are significant increasing migratory cell numbers in the FA treated groups, and this indicates that this motility inhibition by VPA can be rescued by the addition of FA (Fig. 7 ). Fig. 7 Cardiac myocyte H9C2 cells were grown to confluence, and the scratch assays were performed using a 200-μl pipette tip to scratch the culture plate. The scratch-edged migratory cells were observed in the presence and absence of valproic acid and folic acid for 16 h
Discussion
Valproic acid (VPA), a commonly prescribed drug for those affected by epilepsy and bipolar disorders, has a well-known teratogenic potential, causing a variety of birth defects including neural-tube defects (NTDs), congenital malformations, and heart-valve development defects, when women are treated with this medication during pregnancy. Unfortunately, the mechanism underlying the VPA-associated teratogenicity remains unknown, although a range of potential mechanisms including histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition and folate antagonism have been proposed. The latter is of considerable importance, as clinicians need to know whether additional folate supplements can prevent VPA-induced defects. The significantly increase of the incidences from 1.53 to 4.42 % of the children born with autism spectrum by the mothers who historical took VPA in 2013 (a large Danish population-based). VPA functions as a HDAC inhibitor. VPA is also well known to cause teratogenic changes and cause the embryonic zebrafish macrocepaly brain [ ]. Generally speaking, VPA can induce acetylation of histone H3 at K9 and activate pluripotency of human embryonic stem cells [26] and also inhibit GSK3β activity through increasing GSK3β serine 9 phosphorylation and enhancing Wnt pathway. These consequently inhibit normal EMT, which is required for mass cell migration during the cardiac looping [27]. Interestingly, the novel findings in our studies indicated that the level of the trimer of serine phosphorylated GSK3β decrease in the VPA-treated zebrafish embryo. Folic acid can reverse the action of VPA and increase the trimerization of serine 9 phosphorylated VPA (Fig. 5 a). However, the role of serine 9 phosphorylated VPA in cardiac looping will be further investigated in the near future.
In zebra fish transgenic models, several Wnt pathway-related genes morphants, such as apc mcr mutant’s, axin 1 mutants (mbl), and GSK3β morphant hearts, are morphologically normal during early cardiogenesis, but they fail to undergo normal looping morphogenesis [ ]. Since administration, VPA in seizure mother can lead to fetal heart looping defect in zebra fish embryo and FA can rescue the looping defect phenotype; the logic hypothesis will be that the VPA and FA impact GSK phosphorylation [ , ].This study demonstrated VPA-induced cardiac teratogenicity in a dose-dependent manner. A low dose of VPA (0.1 mM) caused moderate looping failure, with defects in constriction between the sinus venosus and the atrium. A higher dose of VPA (0.25 mM) induced severe looping failure, which inhibited chamber formation from the cardiac tube. VPA has also been shown to inhibit the number of migrating neural crest cells [ ]. In addition to migration inhibition, VPA (2 mM) reduces the proliferation of neural crest cells by 11 %, and a higher dose of VPA (3 mM) arrests their proliferation [ ]. VPA can thus be inferred to modulate cell migration among different cell types.
GSK3β is a key protein involved in developmental epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). Phosphorylation of GSK3β serine 9 inhibits normal GSK3β kinase activities and advances nucleus targeting of β-catenin, which promotes EMT and enhances the motility and proliferation of cells [ ]. The results of our study show VPA to prevent GSK3β serine 9 phosphorylation, which potentially inhibits the normal nucleus targeting of β-catenin and the FAK phosphorylation state [ ] and shuts down the normal developmental required EMT and migration of cardiomyocytes during early heart-chamber formation.
In our previous study, GSK3β morphants displayed pericardial edema and an unlooped and stretched heart [ ]. Cardiac valve defects in GSK3β morphants are similar to those observed in axin 1 and apc − mcr − mutants, suggesting that GSK3β might play a role in cardiac valve development through the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Recently [ ], the phosphorylation of GSK3β (Ser9), rather than that of GSK3α (Ser21), was shown to inhibit GSK3β, results in changes in transcription activities and translation factors in the heart and to promote hypertrophic responses [ , ]. In the heart, catalytically active GSK3β has been implicated in anti-hypertrophic signaling. Heart positioning was severely disrupted in GSK3β morphants [ ]. Therefore, VPA was shown in this study to induce similar looping abnormalities by inhibiting the phosphorylation of serine 9 in GSK3β.
FA has been reported to protect against VPA-induced neural-tube defects in animals [ , ]. Periconceptional FA supplement is widely believed to help prevent neural-tube defects, orofacial clefts, and congenital heart defects. In knock-out mouse fetuses lacking a functional folate-binding protein gene Folr1(−/−), outflow tract defects, aortic arch artery abnormalities, and isolated dextrocardia were found [ ]. These abnormalities can be partially rescued by maternal folinic acid supplementation in a dose-dependent manner [ ]. Results from our study show that FA can reverse abnormal looping morphogenesis, ventricular enlargement, and VPA-induced bradycardia. A high dose of FA rescued VPA-induced cardiac morphological defects completely in more than 83 % of the embryos. Continuous application of either a low or high dosage of FA eliminated VPA-induced cardiac malfunctions such as bradycardia and cardiomegaly. This study shows that VPA can reduce the phosphorylation of GSK3β pSer 9 and perturb the migration and proliferation of cardiomyocytes. The addition of FA can partially restore the phosphorylation of GSK3β pSer 9 and increase the number of migratory cardiomyocytes. These results indicate that early and long-term FA supplements for pregnant women are essential to prevent the cardiac teratogenic effects of VPA. Recent guidelines also suggested supplementing epileptic women with at least 0.4 mg of FA prior to pregnancy [ ].
Phosphorylated GSK3β phospho-Ser 9 was observed to contribute to the mass migration and proliferation of cardiomyocytes (jelly-like cells) in the development of the zebrafish heart-valve region as well as a significant reduction in the level of GSK3β phospho-Ser 9 in the VPA-treated group and no significant alteration in the expression of total GSK3β. This indicates that the underlying mechanism of VPA in inhibiting the migration and proliferation of cardiac jelly-like cells did not perturb the expression of the total GSK3β (Fig. 7 ). To recapitulate the confirmed motility inhibition phenotype caused by VPA treatment and rescue by FA treatment, an in vitro cardiac myocyte H9C2 cell culture scratch assay was performed. The significant recovery migratory cells in scratch edge were observed in the FA treated groups (Fig. 7 ).
GSK3β serine 9 phosphorylation is an inhibitory GSK3β; therefore, most β-catenin will translocate into nucleus and augment Wnt pathway and induce MMP-1, MT1-MMP, and EMPRINE expression [ ]. The dysregulated Wnt pathway could affect normal looping process. Wnt pathway plays a vital role in promoting mesodermal progenitors into cardiac precursors, which is required for cardiomyocytes proliferation, expansion, and directional migration. The action of VPA seems to induce inhibitory GSK3β serine 9 phosphorylation and enhance Wnt pathway and perturb the regional differentiation of the mesodermal progenitors into cardiac precursors and further inhibit the cardiomyocyte proliferation, expansion, and migration, and consequently disturb the normal cardiac looping and separation developmental processes [ ]. Interestingly, Li has the same inhibitory effect toward GSK3β, the administration of Li as anti-psychosis therapy in pregnant women. There are also teratogenesis symptoms and cardiac looping defect associated with their fetus. Both of valproic acid and Li are potent inhibitory effects in GSK3β and elicit the same cardiac looping defect which reflect the critical role of Wnt pathway in modulating the cardiac looping process.
VPA is known as a cardiac teratogenic agent for pregnant women with epilepsy. In this study, the key step in the pathogenesis of VPA-induced cardiovascular abnormalities is clearly shown to be the inhibition of serine 9 in GSK3β, which causes incomplete chamber formation, abnormal looping patterns, and failure in AV valve synthesis. Treatment with FA reversed the VPA-induced abnormal cardiac morphologies and functions. The significance of supplementing epileptic women of childbearing age with FA cannot be overemphasized.
