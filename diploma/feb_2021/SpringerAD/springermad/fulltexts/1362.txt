Introduction
Vermamoeba vermiformis represents one of the most common free-living amoebae (FLA) identified in worldwide environmental surveys (Delafont et al. ). In recent years, its importance has been increasingly recognized in association with human diseases. However, contrary to other potentially pathogenic FLA, such as Acanthamoeba spp., Naegleria spp., Balamuthia mandrillaris , and Sappinia diploidea, known as primary agents of human diseases, the pathogenicity of V. vermiformis is still debated . It has been recovered from human samples only in a few instances, i.e., once from spinal fluid (Centeno et al. ) and in a small number of cases of ocular infections (Aitken et al. ; Inoue et al. ; Lorenzo-Morales et al. ; Niyyati et al. ).
The genus Vermamoeba has been recently established and consists of one single species, Vermamoeba vermiformis . Based on molecular phylogeny, Smirnov and collaborators carried out a reclassification of the naked lobose amoebae, showing that the species Hartmannella vermiformis did not group with the other members of the genus (Smirnov et al. ). Later, they proposed the genus Vermamoeba ( Vermamoeba, Cavalier-Smith and Smirnov gen. n.), to contain the isolates previously identified as H. vermiformis (Smirnov et al. ).
There is still limited knowledge on the genetic variability and the evolutionary relationships within the genus. Molecular analyses of V. vermiformis are mostly restrained to sequencing of the 18S rRNA gene, which is used as marker for taxonomic inferences. Since the initial report (Gunderson et al. ), all 18S rRNA gene sequences available for this species show a high degree of conservation, and intragenus sequences divergence (full-length or near full-length) is less than 1% (Delafont et al. ). However, the presence of allelic variations at sites in 11 segments (A–D; E5; E3; F–J), spread over the length of the gene of 35 isolates of V. vermiformis (“almost complete” 18S rRNA gene sequences, exceeding 1500 bp), allowed the identification of different allelic codes, clustering into four to seven groups (see Fuerst and collaborators ( http://u.osu.edu/acanthamoeba/genetic-variation-within-v-vermiformis/ ), last update December 2017, hereafter simply “Fuerst 2017”).
The resulting sets of sequences represent a core group useful to categorize also shorter sequences into the same subgroups.
In this study, we analyzed samples from different kinds of sources in order to (i) investigate the presence of V. vermiformis ; (ii) identify the isolates at the subtype level, using 18S rRNA as molecular marker; (iii) place the Italian isolates in the broader picture of the genetic diversity within V. vermiformis, as emerging from the set of homologous sequences retrieved from the literature.
Materials and methods
Study area, sources, and sampling
The present study analyzed a total of 57 samples, consisting of geothermal waters ( n = 36), from two different geothermal springs in Central Italy (site A and site B, 700 m from each other—see Montalbano Di Filippo et al. ), as well as dental unit waterlines ( n = 19 from inlet, spittoon, and handpiece), tap water ( n = 1), and one clinical sample (corneal scraping from a symptomatic patient with suspected keratitis), collected at much wider distances in Northern and Central Italy. In particular, 2 L of geothermal and tap waters and 1 L from dental unit waterlines were collected in sterile flasks. The water samples were transported to the laboratory at ambient temperature and processed within 24–72 h. In Table 1 , samples are grouped according to the source.

Amoeba culture
The entire volume of each water sample and of the corneal scraping was centrifuged at 4000 g for 20 min. The pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of supernatant, and 100-μl aliquots were inoculated on non-nutrient agar (prepared with sterile double distilled water) in two plates, with a lawn of heat inactivated (1 h at 60 °C) Escherichia coli , routinely cultured in our microbiology laboratory and resuspended in Page’s amoeba saline (PAS) solution. The plates were incubated at 37 °C (45 °C for geothermal waters) and observed daily for amoebic growth, up to 21 days after inoculation, by an inverted microscope at × 200 and × 400 magnification.
Molecular procedures
From all positive cultures, the growing amoebae were harvested from plates, transferred in Eppendorf tubes and washed two times with PBS, pH 7.4. DNA extraction was performed by using QIAamp DNA Micro Kit (Qiagen, Milan, Italy).
A PCR amplification targeted at the V. vermiformis 18S rRNA gene was performed with primers P-FLA-F (5′-CGCGGTAATTCCAGCTCCAATAGC-3′) and P-FLA-R (5′-CAGGTTAAGGTCTCGTTCGTTAAC-3′) (Tsvetkova et al. ), expected to produce an amplicon of 774 bp in reference sequence M95168. PCR was carried out in a 25 μL volume containing 12.5 μL PCR master mix 2X (Promega, Milan, Italy), 5 μL template DNA, and 0.6 mM of each primer and performed in TProfessional Basic Thermocycler (Biometra GmbH, Göttingen, Germany), with thermal profile as in Tsvetkova et al. ( ). The PCR products were visualized by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels, stained by a SYBR Safe DNA gel stain (Invitrogen, Monza MB, Italy). For positive samples, PCR amplicons were purified using mi-PCR Purification Kit (Metabion GmbH, Steinkirchen, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and shipped to external service for sequencing (Bio-Fab Research, Rome, Italy).
DNA chromatograms were examined using FinchTV 1.4 software (Geospiza, Inc., Seattle, WA, USA). After adjoining of the forward and reverse reads, the sequences included approximately 60% of positions readable on both strands. The sequences were pairwise aligned using Clustal Omega software (Chenna et al. ) to recheck variable positions. Sequences were trimmed to the shortest length with high quality in all of our samples and complete representation in the downloaded ones. This produced a valid alignment over the region corresponding to > 650 bp in the reference sequence M95168.
Genetic variability and phylogenetic analysis
All sequences were compared with the specific V. vermiformis dataset which includes 34 isolates previously analyzed in “Fuerst 2017,” after removing the 3′ incomplete sequence KC306529. Additional sequences were searched by similarity in GenBank with BLAST (McGinnis and Madden ) ( www.ncbi.nih.gov/BLAST/ ), with those produced in-house as queries. A final GenBank search was performed for sequences matching the keywords Vermamoeba vermiformis/Hartmannella vermiformis (452 sequences—last update July 2018), Hartmannella spp. (33 sequences), and uncultured eukaryote (65 sequences). This resulted in a set of sequences that went under closer screening for incomplete or improper labeling. In addition to the annotations, the identification was aided by calculating genetic distances with MEGA v5 (Tamura et al. ) using the Kimura 2-parameter substitution model (Kimura ).
After alignment, the entire set was trimmed at positions 652 to 1274 of the reference, to maximize the overlap between ours and Fuerst’s sequences. This procedure retained a total of 74 complete sequences, of which 22 were newly generated, 34 from “Fuerst 2017,” and 18 additional from GenBank (Tables 1 and 2 ).

All sequences covered four out of 11 variable segments identified by “Fuerst 2017,” (i.e., E5-E3-F-G at positions 662–673, 691–699,722–737, and 1193 of the reference, respectively) (Table 3 ). Table 3 Variable nucleotides over the sequence of the V. vermiformis 18S rRNA and the corresponding genetic types assigned to each segment (E5-E3-F-G) as reported by “Fuerst 2017.” By combining the different genetic types, it is possible to identify multiple allelic combinations (allelic variants), condensed into a 4-digit allelic code (Reference sequence M95168: allelic code 1-1-1-1) Variable segments E5 E3 F G Nucleotide positions in M95168 664 667 669 670 671 693 694 695 697 724 725 726 728 730 733 735 1193 Genetic types 1 T A T G G 1 T C A T 1 A T – G G – T 1 C 2 T A C A G 2 T T G T 2 G T – G G – C 2 – 3 C A C A G 3 C T G T 3 A T – C G – T 4 C A C A A 4 T C G A 4 C C G G G C G 5 C A T A A 5 T C G T 5 A T – G A – T 6 C T C G G 7 C A C G G 8 C A T A G 9 C C C G G
Phylogenetic analyses were performed in a dynamic homology framework (Wheeler ; Wheeler ), using the program POY v5 (Wheeler et al. ), to properly account for the common occurrence of insertions/deletions. Note that this method does not rely on a prealigned set of sequences, as far as it optimizes parsimony by exploring the space of possible sites and sizes of indels. The costs of nucleotide substitutions, gap openings, and gap extensions in the alignment were adjusted to 1, 2, and 1, respectively, by means of a number of preliminary runs and our previous experience (Montalbano Di Filippo et al. ). The program was run under a simple, maximum parsimony search. Three sequences attributable to the genus Echinamoeba (AF293895, GU290114, and one available in-house), belonging to the recently robustly established lineage Tubulinea as Vermamoeba (Kang et al. ), were used as out-groups. In the run, the tree with optimal parsimony and nine additional ones with decreasing parsimony (cost) and unique topology were retained and examined. The implicit alignments were saved as FASTA files and examined, to associate branches to particular variations (the alignment of the most parsimonious tree is available in Online Resource 1 , in Supplementary Material). Node support was calculated by bootstrap with 100 replicates.
Results
From the 57 samples analyzed, 40 (70.17%) were positive in the culture examination for the presence of amoebic cells. Twenty-two out of the 40 samples (55%) turned out to be attributable to V. vermiformis upon 18S rRNA gene sequencing (Table 1 ). Together with five isolates (see Table 2 ) previously described by us (Montalbano Di Filippo et al. ), this brings to 27 the number of sequences recovered from Italian sources available for further analyses.
Based on pairwise distances, these 27 isolates could be grouped into six clusters: a first cluster included three identical sequences (11T, 14T, and 15T) recovered from hot thermal waters and are different from the others by at least three single nucleotide substitutions (SNS); a second cluster, formed by 10 identical sequences recovered from the single clinical sample and different sources of tap waters and dental units waterlines; a third cluster of two identical sequences, from two geographically distant sources of waters (4R, PUGL83F); a fourth cluster of two identical sequences from the same source sampled at different times (PUGL84F-78F); a fifth cluster of two identical sequences (13T, 17T) from the same hot thermal waters as above; and a final cluster of eight identical sequences, all from both hot springs reported in “Materials and methods” (see Online Resource 2 in Supplementary Material).
In order to assign the above sequences to subtypes, we analyzed them in the context of a total of 74 sequences, 34 of which were previously assigned to seven V. vermiformis subtypes.
A maximum parsimony analysis performed under dynamic homology resulted in three equally parsimonious trees (see Online Resource 3 - Supplemental Fig. 1 , in Supplementary Material), to be discussed below. In all these trees, sequences were clustered based on their similarity. The corresponding implicit alignment spanned 1626 bp. In this alignment, the out-group sequences ( Echinamoeba ) formed a clade sister to all the remaining sequences in agreement with Kang et al. ( ). Two unusually long sequences (DQ123623, EU137741) were reported by “Fuerst 2017” with allelic codes 6-5-1-1 and 7-4-4-1, respectively, assigned to group 6, and shared with four additional V. vermiformis sequences (KP233873-76), a 983 bp insertion in between positions 1188 and 1189 of the reference. This position coincided with that reported by Thomas, V. and Greub, G. (in accession EU137741) and considered a group I intron. Moreover, KP233874 and KP233875 carried the novel arrangement TCAC-TCGCGAGG-GTGG in the variable segment F. The remaining portion of the alignment, represented in all 74 sequences, thus consisted of 643 bp (hereafter “non-intronic”).
As to diversity, the non-intronic portion of the alignment included 60 positions variable for SNS and 40 positions variable for indels. This portion of the alignment encompassed the variable segments E5-E3-F-G, amounting to 40 bp. Of the 60 SNS variable sites overall, 14 fell within these variable segments, confirming a contribution to the overall diversity above the average (“Fuerst 2017”). The pairwise identity across this portion ranged between 100 and 96.7%.
As to the intron, 167 SNS were observed, plus 11 indels amounting to 17 positions. The minimum identity among the six sequences was 83%. Notably, the same sequences displayed an identity above 99% in their non-intronic portion.
Sequence analysis of our 27 isolates in the context of the entire dataset (Fig. 1 ) revealed: (i) Three identical isolates (11T, 14T, and 15T; top of Fig. 1 ) from hot thermal waters were novel. These sequences were characterized by the new allelic code 7-5-1-1, never reported before; this novel sequence type was deposited in GenBank under accession number MK110505 (isolate 15T). (ii) Ten isolates (1R, 5R, 6R, 7R, 8R, 9R, 2S, 23C, and KP792377-8) from different sources, with allelic code 1-1-1-1, showed 100% identity with sequences AY680840 and M95168 and were thus assigned to group 1. This cluster included three additional sequences, sharing the code 1-1-1-1 but diverging at up to eight positions, two of which (DQ10830, EF526997) were already assigned to group 1 (see Online Resource 3 - Supplemental Fig. 2 , in Supplementary Material). (iii) Two identical isolates (4R, KP792383) with allelic code 3-2-1-1 were also identical to KT892702, assigned to group 4—“Fuerst 2017”, and to two additional V. vermiformis sequences (MF112024, KU746978). (iv) Two identical isolates (KP792384, KP792381) shared allelic code 8-3-1-1 but differed by other six substitutions from KF697197, a variant sequence within group 5—“Fuerst 2017.” (v) Two identical isolates from hot thermal waters (13T, 17T) with allelic code 4-2-1-1, not previously reported by “Fuerst 2017,” showed 100% identity with an uncultured eukaryote isolate HRT3 from Bangkok (LC222939). All these sequences shared the 719T>C variant. This novel sequence type was deposited in GenBank under accession number MK110504 (isolate 13T). (vi) Eight identical isolates (3T, 12T, 16T, 18T, 19T, 20T, 21T, 22T) with allelic code 5-2-2-1 and all from hot thermal waters exhibited also 100% identity with the H. vermiformis isolate KWR2 (AY502960) and were thus assigned to group 3a—“Fuerst 2017.” Within the same cluster, a single nucleotide substitution (807A>G) differentiated AY502961. Another single nucleotide substitution, within the variable segment E5 (669C), differentiated AY502959 and generated the allelic code 4-2-2-1.

Discussion
According to the recent classification of Amoebozoa, the species Vermamoeba vermiformis is now related with Echinamoeba spp. within the clade Echinamoebidia (Cavalier-Smith et al. ; Kang et al. ). This amoeba has been recovered at a global scale in natural freshwater environments, including thermal springs, man-made environments, and engineered water systems (water treatment, distribution systems, and tap water installations). In contrast with this common occurrence, little is known about the prevalence of amoebic keratitis caused by Vermamoeba worldwide and its epidemiology at a local scale.
Here, we report 22 new isolates attributable to V. vermiformis from different sources in Italy and characterized as different types on the basis of the DNA sequence in the central portion of the 18S rRNA gene, as described by “Fuerst 2017.” Though this region encompasses only four of the 11 variable segments reported so far for the entire 18S rRNA, we notice that they can include a large part of the diversity information to cluster the isolates in a replicable fashion. By assembling a dataset of 74 overlapping sequences, we proceeded one step further in the description of the pattern of similarities among the sequences, summarized in the tree of Fig. 1 .
There are strong and weak features in this chart, which deserve discussion.
As to the strong features, though we used a reduced span of the sequenced segment and a different tree building method, the 34 sequences derived from “Fuerst 2017” were clustered as in the original report, with the exception of a group 4 sequence (AF426157) mapping in an otherwise group 5 cluster and a sequence of uncertain group assignment (X77513) here mapping in a group 4 cluster. This shows that the variable segments E5, E3, F, and G convey most of the information on diversity. Accordingly, only in three cases in each of our clusters corresponding to groups 2, 4/5, and 3b, respectively, sequences identical in this study were instead distinguishable based on the complete sequence (see tree in “Fuerst 2017”).
By searching GenBank, we also expanded the set of sequences characterized by a ~ 1000 bp insertion. Our reconstruction placed the inserted DNA at an homologous position in the six sequences and revealed an internal identity of 83% or higher. These results point strongly to a unique event (monophyly) for the insertion, followed by an accelerated divergence which contrasts sharply with the strong conservation of the non-intronic portion.
The six sequences above, together with three novel sequences (11T, 14T, and 15T), reported here for the first time, share nucleotide states with our out-groups, i.e., the 664(C)-669(C) and the 694(C)-695(G)-696(C) arrangements in E5 and E3, respectively. These variants locate the corresponding sequences in basal branches of all the equally parsimonious trees (top in Fig. 1 and Online Resource 3 - Supplemental Fig. 1 , in Supplementary Material). At the opposite end, we find branches with sequences of groups 3b and 3a. The trees also include robust clades defined by substitutions 719T>C and 934A>T, not represented in the “Fuerst 2017” dataset.
One weak aspect of the tree is the low support for branches in between these extremes. In particular, the relative order of codes 1-1-1-1, 2-2-1-1, 3-2-1-1, and 3-3-1-1, associated with groups 1, 2, 4, and 4/5, respectively, remains unresolved. In the tree by “Fuerst 2017,” too, nodes basal to these clusters received inconclusive support.
This survey, carried out on a diverse array of potential sources, recovered V. vermiformis from a remarkable proportion of samples, in line with previous reports in the literature (Delafont et al. ). As to the diversity of the samples here analyzed, the 27 Italian isolates were characterized for the first time at the level of sequence type and mapped to different clades of the tree. In particular, isolates from both geographically close thermal springs were mapped to three different clusters of sequences. The presence of different strains of Vermamoeba in these small natural areas could indicate environmental stability of the sites, allowing to preserve genetic diversity of the amoebic populations.
Also, the isolates from one clinical sample and from a variety of water distribution systems (e.g., public fountains, dental units, and taps/showers), derived from a geographically widespread sampling, display diversity. Ours and the only other Vermamoeba sequence from human infection, included in the “Fuerst 2017” dataset, were mapped in different clades of the tree. Isolates recovered from dental units and tap water, both from managed waters, also confirmed multiple sequence types and hence heterogeneity of the amoebic populations.
Finally, identical sequences were recovered from independent stations located at > 800 km from each other. In the context of the entire dataset, with few exceptions, the types defined by the sequences here analyzed are distributed across huge distances, often transcontinental. Confinement to specific natural or man-made environments remains to be investigated by means of specific sampling designs.
In conclusion, our dataset revealed a novel quota of diversity which enlarged the repertoire of single nucleotide and indel variants and the list of allelic codes. Our experimental procedure cannot exclude sequence heterogeneity among the multiple copies of the V. vermiformis 18S rRNA gene (Kuiper et al. ). However, the background noise in sequence profiles of isolates with and without the intronic insertion points to a negligible quota of variant copies, if any.
While sequences previously assigned to each of the seven groups by “Fuerst 2017” are largely clustered together in our tree, we prompt caution in simply equating an allelic code with group affiliation. In fact, codes at E5, E3, and F often consist in a variation at a single position, mostly a transition, i.e., an event with a non-negligible probability of recurrence. We thus recommend using a complete set of variants as possible within the available sequenced segment(s) to determine the similarity between isolates and their assignment to the same/different clades.
