INTRODUCTION
The tablet film coating and drying process is widely used in pharmaceutical oral solid dosage manufacturing to control disintegration characteristics ( , ) and/or to protect active pharmaceutical ingredients from environmental factors like humidity, oxygen, and light ( , ). Quality attributes of the coating film are greatly dependent on process conditions for a given set of the tablet formation, coating solution, and coating equipment ( , , ). Unsuitably controlled process parameters lead to intra-tablet ( , , ) and inter-tablet coating variability ( , ), and therefore affect final product quality attributes. Additionally, insufficient drying of the coating solution augments penetration of the solution into the tablet core causing the hydrolytic decomposition of moisture sensitive active pharmaceutical ingredients and excipients ( , ).
Experimental observations ( , , , ) and mechanistic models ( , ) have been carried out to describe thermodynamic relationships between process parameters and evaporation of the coating solution. Ebey ( ) developed a thermodynamic mass and energy balance model to derive relationships between process parameters and the drying rate of the aqueous coating solution. Am Ende and Berchielli ( ) enhanced this model to analyze both aqueous and organic coating solution for a wide range of the tablet load from small scale (1 to 12 kgs) to large scale (60 to 220 kgs). Page et al. ( ) divided the coater into coating and drying zones and suggested a compartmental thermodynamic model. Strong ( ) developed a first-principle psychrometric model to describe the drying rate of the wetted tablet by an environmental equivalency factor.
Another aspect that has been studied as a part of coating process understanding is the thermodynamic influence of process parameters and tablet properties on the penetration of the solution ( ). Ruotsalainen et al. ( ) demonstrated the influence of coating conditions on the film coating morphology and moisture content of tablets. Kestur et al. ( ) discovered that thermodynamic environments significantly affect the tablet moisture content which is critical to the physicochemical stability of a moisture sensitive drug. Over past decades, however, only few mathematical efforts have been made to analyze penetration of the coating solution. Page et al. ( ) adapted the idea of “limit moisture” and “critical moisture” in their compartmental model to describe the tablet moisture content. They determined the limit moisture and the critical moisture from experimental data but did not explain how process parameters and tablet properties thermodynamically affect the tablet moisture. A recent study on the ConsiGma™ coater ( ) predicted coater performance, including heat and mass balance, and drying kinetics at tablet scale with a multilevel theoretical model but did not consider the penetration of the coating solution.
In this study, a thermodynamic balance model for the tablet film coating and drying process was presented to evaluate the impact of both process parameters and tablet properties on the process. Kinetic equations for solution evaporation at the tablet surface and penetration into the tablet core were included in the mass and energy balance model. Coating experiments with tablets of various sizes were conducted to estimate the heat loss factor of the coating unit and penetration coefficient of the tablet, and to validate the model. Validated model was used for sensitivity analysis with respect to process parameters as well as tablet properties.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Coating and Drying Process
The ConsiGma™ continuous tablet coater manufactured by GEA group (Düsseldorf, Germany) ( , ) was implemented in this study (Fig. 1 ). Tablets circulate along a coating wheel rotating at high speed (88–92 rpm). Airflow from two air knives generated a flight of the tablets increasing tablet surface area exposed to the coating solution. The process air was fed into the drum from the side and went through the annular tablet bed and the perforated wheel. The coating solution was sprayed through a nozzle upwards to the flying tablets. The process air and evaporated coating solution were then vented through the outlet. Fig. 1 Schematic diagram with critical process parameters of the film coating and drying process.

First Principle Model
Mass Balance
The mass flowrate of the vapor stream i was calculated from measured volumetric flowrate and density of humid air (dry air and water vapor mixture). Since the process pressure was measured near 100 kPa, ideal gas law was used to calculate density. Equation 1 is applicable for all vapor streams of inlet air, outlet air and two air knives ( k 1 and k 2). $$ {\dot{m}}_{a,i}={\dot{V}}_{a,i}{\rho}_{a,i}={\dot{V}}_{a,i}\left({\rho}_{d,i}+{\rho}_{v,i}\right)={\dot{V}}_{a,i}\left(\frac{M_d{p}_{d,i}}{R{T}_i}+\frac{M_w{p}_{v,i}}{R{T}_i}\right)\kern1em \left(i= in,\kern0.5em out,\kern0.5em k1,\mathrm{and}\ k2\right) $$ (1)
Herein, \( \dot{m} \) is the mass flowrate, \( \dot{V} \) is the volumetric flowrate, ρ is the density, M is the molar weight, p is the partial pressure, T is the temperature, and R is the gas constant. Subscripts a, d, v, and w mean humid air, dry air, water vapor, and liquid water.
The outlet air mass flowrate must be equal to the sum of the inlet flowrate, the air knives flowrate, and the net evaporation rate ( \( {\dot{m}}_E \) ) of the coating solution because no chemical reactions occurred over the process. $$ {\dot{m}}_{a, out}={\dot{m}}_{a, in}+{\dot{m}}_{a,k1}+{\dot{m}}_{a,k2}+{\dot{m}}_E $$ (2)
The air mass balance can be separated for the water vapor and the dry air. Herein, the mass balance of the dry air did not include the net evaporation rate. $$ {\dot{m}}_{v, out}={\dot{m}}_{v, in}+{\dot{m}}_{v,k1}+{\dot{m}}_{v,k2}+{\dot{m}}_E $$ (3) $$ {\dot{m}}_{d, out}={\dot{m}}_{d, in}+{\dot{m}}_{d,k1}+{\dot{m}}_{d,k2} $$ (4)
The mass flowrate of vapor stream i (Eq. 1 ) can also be expressed as the sum of the water vapor and the dry air mass flowrates. $$ {\dot{m}}_{a,i}={\dot{m}}_{d,i}+{\dot{m}}_{v,i}=\left(1-S{H}_i\right){\dot{m}}_{a,i}+S{H}_i{\dot{m}}_{a,i} $$ (5)
Specific humidity (SH) and relative humidity (RH) were defined as: $$ S{H}_i=\frac{X_{v,i}{M}_w}{X_{v,i}{M}_w+\left(1-{X}_{v,i}\right){M}_d} $$ (6) $$ R{H}_i=\frac{p_{v,i}}{p_i^{sat}}\times \left(100\%\right) $$ (7) where X is the molar fraction. The saturation vapor pressure ( p sat ) was obtained from a polynomial approximation ( ). More details are provided in Appendix A . The molar fraction of water vapor was defined as the ratio of the water vapor partial pressure to the total pressure P as per Dalton’s law. $$ {X}_{v,i}=\frac{p_{v,i}}{P_i} $$ (8)
Evaporation and Penetration
According to the coating film formation mechanism ( ), the sprayed coating solution forms a liquid film at the tablet surface and the liquid water component of the film rapidly evaporates. A key factor to consider in evaporation studies is the ratio of wetted surface area of the tablet to the total surface area ( , ). However, this model assumes the coating solution forms a uniform liquid layer around the entire tablet, and therefore, evaporation and penetration occur at the entire tablet surface (it is also assumed that the impact of coating on the tablet surface area is negligible, i.e., tablet surface area is constant). This assumption is based on the characteristic flying motion of the tablets in the ConsiGma™ coater; since the tablets are not in a bed but traveling through the air, it is not unreasonable to assume the entire surface is exposed to both the coating spray and drying air ( ).
Assuming the boundary gas layer of the liquid film is saturated, the evaporation rate at a single tablet surface ( \( {\dot{m}}_{E,T} \) ) which will hereafter be referred to as the evaporation rate is described by the partial vapor pressure gradient between the liquid film and the process air. ( ). $$ {\dot{m}}_{E,T}=\frac{\alpha {A}_T{M}_w}{R}\left(\frac{p_f^{sat}}{\left({T}_{cs}+{T}_a\right)/2}-\frac{p_{v, in}}{T_{a, in}}\right) $$ (9)
Herein, α is the evaporation coefficient, \( {p}_f^{\mathrm{sat}} \) is the saturation vapor pressure of the liquid film, A T is the tablet surface area, and T cs is the temperature of the coating solution. The term ( T cs + T a, in )/2 represents an approximation of the liquid film temperature ( ). The evaporation coefficient was derived from the correlation of Sherwood number (Sh) for an oblate spheroid (considered the closest approximation to actual tablet shape), the particle Reynolds number (Re p ) and the Schmidt number (Sc) ( , ). $$ \alpha =\frac{Sh{D}_{v,a}}{L_T} $$ (10) $$ {L}_T=\frac{A_T}{\kappa_T}=\frac{A_T}{\pi {d}_T} $$ (11) $$ Sh=0.74{\mathit{\operatorname{Re}}}_p^{0.5}{Sc}^{1/3} $$ (12) $$ R{e}_p=\frac{\overline{u_T}{\rho}_a{L}_T}{\eta_a} $$ (13) $$ Sc=\frac{\eta_a\ }{\rho_a{D}_{v,a}} $$ (14)
In these equations, L T , d T , and κ T are the characteristic length, the diameter, and the perimeter of the tablet. η a is the dynamic viscosity of the process air and D v, a is the diffusion coefficient of air-water vapor binary mixture at a given temperature. More details are provided in Appendix A for empirical formulas ( , , ).
The relative tablet velocity is a vector summation of the tablet velocity and the process air velocity. Because the tablet moves perpendicular to the direction of the process air in the drying zone, the relative tablet speed ( \( \overline{u_T} \) ) can be written by Eq. 15 with the tablet flight speed in the drying zone ( u T ) and the average speed of the process air near tablet ( u a ). The tablet flight speed was approximated as 65% of the wheel rotation speed using process parameters of ConsiGma™ coater, this is based on observed tablet flight times being approximately 65% of what they would be if the tablet velocity was equal to the wheel velocity. The average air speed was calculated from the dimensions of the wheel because the process air flows through the perforated side section of the coating wheel. $$ \overline{u_T}={\left({u}_T^2+{u}_a^2\right)}^{0.5} $$ (15) $$ {u}_T=0.65\left(\uppi {\omega}_{wheel}{d}_{wheel}\right) $$ (16) $$ {u}_a=\frac{{\dot{V}}_{in}}{\uppi {d}_{wheel}{h}_{wheel}} $$ (17)
Herein, ω wheel , d wheel , and h wheel are the wheel rotation speed, the wheel diameter, and the wheel thickness.
The penetration rate of the liquid water to a single tablet ( \( {\dot{m}}_{P,T} \) ) which will hereafter be referred as the penetration rate was described by a mathematical water penetration model through the porous tablet based on capillary pressure-driven fluid flow ( ). Detailed approaches are presented in Appendix B . $$ {\dot{m}}_{P,T}=\frac{\rho_w}{\eta_w}{V}_T\varepsilon \gamma \beta $$ (18)
Herein, γ is the surface tension of air-water interface and β is the penetration coefficient. The tablet porosity ( ε ) was calculated from the true density of powder mixture ( ρ true ), the tablet mass ( m T ) and the tablet volume ( V T ). $$ \varepsilon =1-\frac{m_T}{V_T{\rho}_{true}} $$ (19)
Assuming the coating solution is totally sprayed to the tablets without loss and liquid water does not accumulate in the coater, the liquid water sprayed to a tablet ( \( {\dot{m}}_{\mathrm{w},\mathrm{cs},\mathrm{T}} \) ) was assumed to equal to the sum of the evaporation and penetration rate. $$ {\dot{m}}_{w, cs,T}={\dot{m}}_{cs,T}{x}_w={\dot{m}}_{E,T}+{\dot{m}}_{P,T} $$ (20)
Herein, x w is the mass fraction of liquid water. Therefore, the penetration rate is a key limiting factor and closely related to the drying efficiency and the tablet moisture content.
In the ConsiGma™ coating and drying process, every tablet rapidly circulates the coater and therefore is exposed more frequently to the lesser amount of the coating solution compared with the conventional coating and drying processes. Hence, the liquid water component at the tablet surface quickly evaporates only in a certain area and not over the entire wheel. To describe biased evaporation, the wheel was in principle divided into three zones: ( ) spraying, ( ) drying, and ( ) conveying zones (Fig. 2 ). Tablets in each zone were also labeled as ( ) wetted, ( ) evaporative, and ( ) dried, respectively. The number of evaporative tablets ( N E ) was defined as the ratio of the evaporation rate (Eq. 9 ) to the net evaporation rate calculated from measured inlet and outlet variables. Since penetration also occurs only when the solution presents at the tablet surface, the number of evaporative tablets ( N E ) can also be calculated by the net penetration rate ( \( {\dot{m}}_P \) ) and the penetration rate ( \( {\dot{m}}_{P,T} \) ). $$ {N}_E=\frac{{\dot{m}}_E}{{\dot{m}}_{E,T}} $$ (21) $$ {N}_E=\frac{{\dot{m}}_P}{{\dot{m}}_{P,T}} $$ (22) Fig. 2 Schematic presentation for three characteristic zones and three types of tablets
The ratio of the number of evaporative tablets to the total number of tablets was defined as the evaporative ratio ( φ ). $$ \varphi =\frac{N_E}{N}\times \left(100\%\right) $$ (23)
The drying efficiency ( ψ ) of the process was defined as the ratio of the net evaporation rate to sprayed water mass flowrate. All the evaporated water was assumed to be combined with the process air stream. $$ \psi =\frac{{\dot{m}}_E}{{\dot{m}}_{cs}}\times \left(100\%\right) $$ (24)
Energy Balance
The total energy change of the coater can be described by the first law of thermodynamics for open systems. Since the tablet and the outlet air were in thermal equilibrium at both steps ( , ), the enthalpy change of the tablet was neglected and the total enthalpy change was written as follows: $$ \frac{dE}{dt}=\Delta \left({\dot{m}}_a{\hat{H}}_a\right)+\Delta \left({\dot{m}}_w{\hat{H}}_w\right)-{\dot{Q}}_{loss}=0 $$ (25) where \( \Delta {\hat{H}}_{\mathrm{a}} \) and \( \Delta {\hat{H}}_{\mathrm{w}} \) are the specific enthalpy of the airflow and the liquid water, and \( {\dot{Q}}_{\mathrm{loss}} \) is the heat loss to the atmosphere. Assuming all the water evaporates as part of the process ( ) and no liquid leaves the unit, the change of energy rate for the liquid water can be given as follows. $$ \Delta \left({\dot{m}}_w{\hat{H}}_w\right)={C}_{p,w}\Delta \left({\dot{m}}_w{T}_w\right)=-{C}_{p,w}{\dot{m}}_{w, cs}{T}_{cs} $$ (26)
Herein, C p , w is the liquid water heat capacity at a given temperature (Appendix A ).
The energy rate of an airflow i includes the sensible heat of the dry air and the latent heat for the water vaporization. $$ {\dot{m}}_{a,i}{\hat{H}}_{a,i}={\dot{m}}_{d,i}{C}_{p,d}{T}_i+{\dot{m}}_{v,i}\left(\Delta {H}_{vap}^0+{C}_{p,v}{T}_i\right) $$ (27)
Herein, C p , d and C p , v are the heat capacity of the dry air and the water vapor at a given temperature, respectively (Appendix A ). \( \Delta {H}_{\mathrm{vap}}^0 \) is the latent heat of vaporization (2501.3 kJ/kg) at the reference temperature ( T = 0°C) ( ).
A comprehensive heat loss factor ( K surr ) ( ) was used for the convective heat loss to the atmosphere instead of considering both heat transfer coefficient ( k surr ) and surface area of the drum. $$ {\dot{Q}}_{loss}={k}_{surr}{A}_{surr}\left({T}_{surr}-{T}_{out}\right)={K}_{surr}\left({T}_{surr}-{T}_{out}\right) $$ (28)
Consequently, the enthalpy and temperature of the outlet airflow can be calculated by the following equation. $$ {\dot{m}}_{a, out}{\hat{H}}_{a, out}={\dot{m}}_{d, out}{C}_{p,d}{T}_{out}+{\dot{m}}_{v, out}\left(\Delta {H}_{vap}^0+{C}_{p,v}{T}_{out}\right)=\left({\dot{m}}_{d, in}{C}_{p,d}{T}_{in}+{\dot{m}}_{v, in}\left(\Delta {H}_{vap}^0+{C}_{p,v}{T}_{in}\right)+{\dot{m}}_{d,k1}{C}_{p,d}{T}_{k1}+{\dot{m}}_{v,k1}\left(\Delta {H}_{vap}^0+{C}_{p,v}{T}_{k1}\right)+{\dot{m}}_{d,k2}{C}_{p,d}{T}_{k2}+{\dot{m}}_{v,k2}\left(\Delta {H}_{vap}^0+{C}_{p,v}{T}_{k2}\right)\right)+{C}_{p,w}{\dot{m}}_{w, cs}{T}_{cs}-{K}_{surr}\left({T}_{surr}-{T}_{out}\right) $$ (29)
Sensitivity Analysis
A simple deterministic sensitivity analysis ( ) was used to assess the sensitivity of process variables using an elasticity index (EI). The EI of an output variable Ω with respect to an input parameter ζ (EI ζ , Ω ) was defined as Eq. 30 to represent the relative change of an output variable Ω corresponding to a relative change of an input parameter ζ . The EI is normalized value of a sensitivity index SI ζ , Ω (Eq. 31 ) and therefore can be used to compare the effects of various input parameters on the output variable. The reader is referred to Loucks et al. ( ) for more details on the sensitivity analysis methodology used here. $$ E{I}_{\upzeta, \Omega}=S{I}_{\upzeta, \Omega}\frac{\upzeta_0}{\Omega \left({\upzeta}_0\right)} $$ (30) $$ S{I}_{\zeta, \Omega}=\frac{\left(\Omega \left(\zeta +\Delta \zeta \right)-\Omega \left(\zeta -\Delta \zeta \right)\right)}{2\Delta \upzeta} $$ (31)
All in-silico activities including thermodynamic balance model development, parameter estimation, and case studies for sensitivity analysis were conducted on the gSOLIDS 4.1.0 (Process Systems Enterprise, London, United Kingdom) process flowsheet modeling environment.
Materials
Three to 4 kgs of standard convex tablets ( ρ true = 1800 kg/m 3 ) were used for the coating experiments conducted using the ConsiGma™ coater with 440 mm of diameter and 160 mm of thickness. Five different tablet sizes were used (Table I ) for the same mass holdup; therefore, the tablet number was not constant across experiments. An aqueous coating system consisting of 17% ( w / w ) Opadry II 85F solution (Colorcon, West Point, PA, United States) and 83% water at 20°C was used as the coating solution. Dehumidified air was used for the entire coating process; therefore, the main process air, the air knives, atomizing, and patterning air of the coating spray had the same specific humidity ( ). However, contributions of atomizing and patterning air to the mass and energy balance were ignored because normalized flowrate for both was less than 3% of the normalized flowrate of the main process air. Ambient temperature was assumed to be 20°C.

Coating Experiments
Total of six coating experiments were conducted with two steps—stabilizing and coating. Temperature and relative humidity of the inlet, outlet, and air knife airflow were continuously recorded by in-process measurements. Volumetric flowrate of the inlet and air knife were also measured for mass flowrate calculation. For the stabilizing step, the tablets were loaded to the wheel and gauge pressure of two air knives was kept at 10 kPa for heat loss calculation. The coating solution was not sprayed during the stabilizing step. Measured air knife parameters and outlet variables of the stabilizing step (Table II ) were averaged for 50 s of the equilibrium state where the tablet and outlet air reach a thermodynamic equilibrium ( ). Then the air knife pressure and the coating spray rate were changed to their set values to achieve actual coating conditions. Measured outlet variables showed unsteady behaviors while shifting from the stabilizing to the actual coating step as reported in other studies ( , , ). However, the data of the unsteady state was excluded in the study because the normal process time (7 to 12 mins) was set to be sufficiently longer than the duration of the unsteady state (about 50 to 100 s), and therefore, the process was mainly governed by the thermodynamic balance during the steady-state. Measured parameters of the actual coating step (Table III ) were averaged for 2 min of the steady-state.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Heat Loss Factor Determination
The heat loss factor of the ConsiGma™ coater (16.59 W/K) was determined by using the data of the stabilizing step (Table II ). Maximum differences between the experiments and model prediction were 0.5°C and 0.07% for outlet temperature and relative humidity, respectively.
Drying Efficiency
The first principle model introduced earlier requires implicit variables, i.e., the net evaporation rate, net penetration rate, and drying efficiency. Since most film coaters including ConsiGma™ does not have in-process measurements, the implicit variables noted as calculated variables in Tables III and V were obtained from preliminary balance calculations (Eqs. 32 to 34 ) prior to thorough model development and validation. Calculation results showed 7 to 12% of the sprayed liquid water did not evaporate even though the dehumidified air at a high temperature (70 to 82°C) was used, demonstrating the significance of penetration effect. $$ {\dot{m}}_{E, cal}={\dot{m}}_{\mathrm{a}, out, mea}-\left({\dot{m}}_{a, in, mea}+{\dot{m}}_{a,k1, mea}+{\dot{m}}_{a,k2, mea}\right) $$ (32) $$ {\dot{m}}_{P, cal}={\dot{m}}_{cs}-{\dot{m}}_{E, cal} $$ (33) $$ {\psi}_{cal}=\frac{{\dot{m}}_{E, cal}}{{\dot{m}}_{cs}}\times \left(100\%\right) $$ (34)
Parameter Estimation and Model Validation
Five out of a total of six coating experiments (runs 1 to 5) were used for estimation of the penetration coefficient and the evaporative ratio using the least square algorithm (Table IV ). The evaporative ratio was 7.18 to 13.21%, which means the coating solution quickly evaporates once tablets depart from the spraying zone. This is because only a small amount of the coating solution is sprayed to the tablet per rotation due to higher wheel rotating speed of the coater (88 to 92 rpm) than conventional rolling and cascading coaters (~ 10 rpm). It is noted that all coating runs were assumed to have identical penetration coefficient because tablets with the same formulation were used. Table IV The Evaporation Coefficient and Estimated Parameters, Penetration Coefficient, and Evaporative Ratio Run 1 2 3 4 5 α (m/s) 4.38 × 10 −2 3.80 × 10 −2 3.78 × 10 −2 3.60 × 10 −2 3.73 × 10 −2 β (1/m) 8.90 × 10 −6 φ (%) 7.18 9.66 11.15 10.39 13.21
Estimated parameters were applied to the balance model against the Run V for model validation (Table V ). The model predicted all output variables within acceptable ranges. These validation results imply that the drying kinetics can be thermodynamically described by competing evaporation and penetration. Correlations between measured/calculated and predicted output variables (Fig. 3 ) also mean the balance model with estimated parameters can be applied to the ConsiGma™ coating and drying process with various type of the tablets and process variable variabilities. The root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) was calculated by following the equation to represent deviation of the predicted values from the experimental values. $$ \mathrm{RMSEP}=\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{j=1}^n{\left({\Omega}_{mea,j}-{\Omega}_{est,j}\right)}^2}{n}} $$ (35) Table V MODEL Validation Results for Output Variables Symbol Description Measured (calculated) Predicted Difference (predicted-measured) T out Outlet temperature (°C) 46.52 47.93 1.41 RH out Outlet relative humidity (%) 24.41 22.74 −1.67 SH out Outlet specific humidity (g/kg) 15.94 15.94 0.00 \( {\dot{m}}_E \) Net evaporation rate (g/min) 53.41 a 54.06 0.65 \( {\dot{m}}_P \) Net penetration rate (g/min) 4.39 a 4.01 −0.38 ψ Drying efficiency (%) 92.44 a 93.31 0.87 φ Evaporative ratio (%) – 10.06 – a These variables were calculated using measured variables and input parameters Fig. 3 Correlation between measured/calculated and predicted process variables. a The outlet air temperature (°C). b The outlet air relative humidity (%). c The net evaporation rate (g/min). d The net penetration rate (g/min)
Herein, n is the number of runs, Ω mea, j and Ω est, j are the measured and estimated output variables for run j , respectively.
It should be noted that most prediction error comes from run 1, which is presented by a diamond shape in Fig. 3 . The tablet type A is used only for run 1 and has quite different dimensional properties from other tablet types for runs 2–5. In effect, there are four runs with similar tablets, resulting in an observable, but not exaggerated difference between run 1 and the others.
Sensitivity Analysis
After the parameter estimation and model validation, the run 2 was used as a base case for the sensitivity analysis and ± 10% variability was applied to the input parameters. While no specific considerations were required for process variable variability cases, following geometric calculations were applied for the variability of the tablet properties to preserve other related properties: For the tablet surface area (or volume) variation, the tablet characteristic length was adjusted to ensure the tablet has the same volume (or surface area). For the number of tablet variation, the tablet mass was changed to conserve the total mass holdup of the process. Then the tablet volume, surface area, and characteristic length were also changed to retain porosity and aspect ratio of the tablet.
The EI plot presented in Fig. 4 demonstrates the effect of various process variables and tablet properties on the evaporation rate. The inlet air with higher temperature noticeably enhanced the evaporation rate. Although the inlet air temperature affects both saturation vapor pressure and temperature of the liquid film, the saturation vapor pressure increases more than the liquid film temperature as the inlet air temperature increases. The tablet consequently has higher pressure gradient (Eq. 9 ) which is the thermodynamic driving force for evaporation. The coating solution temperature also had a similar but less impact on evaporation. The effect of the inlet relative humidity was small in comparison with other variables. This is because the process used the dehumidified air (2 to 4 RH%), so the relative humidity variability was too small to influence evaporation. Higher inlet air flowrates can increase evaporation because of its contribution to relative tablet speed. The air knives were not included in the energy balance due to their mass flowrate being significantly lower than the inlet process air; therefore, they do not contribute to evaporation. Interestingly, the spray rate was not related with the evaporation rate because it only changes the net evaporation rate but not the evaporation rate of the single tablet. Fig. 4 The elasticity index of the evaporation rate
Figure 4 also implies the tablet properties considerably influence the evaporation rate. The solution at a tablet with the larger surface area evaporates more quickly when the tablet volume is held constant. The tablet number also affects the evaporation rate because a larger number of the tablets for the same load obviously means smaller tablets as well as a smaller surface area per tablet. Regarding the tablet volume, it has a negative relationship with evaporation rate when the tablet has a constant surface area. This is because the characteristic length increases as the tablet volume increases because the characteristic length used in the model is a function of the major axis rather than an aspect ratio of the spheroid. Since the evaporation coefficient is inversely related with the characteristic length according to the Eqs. 10 and 12 , the tablet with larger volume can experience less evaporation. Therefore, this relationship should be applied carefully to other tablet types that characterize other forms of characteristic length.
The process variables and tablet properties affect the penetration rate as depicted in Fig. 5 . The tablet volume becomes the most enhancing factor for penetration. When the tablet volume is increased for a given tablet mass, the tablet must have bigger and more pores to conserve the tablet mass. This change of the pore accelerates liquid penetration through the tablet. Tablet number also affects the penetration rate since a larger number of tablets essentially mean a smaller single tablet volume; therefore, tablet number has a negative effect on the penetration rate. The inlet air and the coating solution temperature still influence the penetration rate owing to temperature dependency of density, viscosity, and surface tension of the coating solution. Other process variables are observed to have no impact. Fig. 5 The elasticity index of the penetration rate
Further investigation on the drying efficiency is presented in Fig. 6 . The values and signs of the EIs are similar with the difference between the EIs to the evaporation rate and the penetration rate ( \( {\mathrm{EI}}_{\zeta, {\dot{m}}_{E,T}}-{\mathrm{EI}}_{\zeta, {\dot{m}}_{P,T}} \) ). This is expected considering that evaporation and penetration are seen to be competing kinetics, i.e., faster penetration means slower evaporation and vice versa. It can be concluded that the inlet temperature , the inlet volume flowrate, the tablet surface area, the number of tablets, and the coating solution temperature have a positive effect on the drying efficiency, whereas the tablet volume and the inlet relative humidity have a negative effect on the drying efficiency. It is noted that the drying efficiency is independent of the spray rate due to the spray rate is not related to both evaporation and penetration. Fig. 6 The elasticity index of the drying efficiency
Figure 7 illustrates the sensitivity of input parameters and tablet properties to the outlet temperature. The inlet temperature and volumetric flowrate have critical effects on the outlet temperature. The air knife temperature also significantly influences the outlet temperature because the air knives are secondary sources of the air although they are employed to create the tablet flight. The coating solution temperature influences the drying efficiency in a manner opposite to the effect on the outlet temperature. This is due to the fact that evaporation is an endothermic process and therefore the increase in the drying efficiency (more evaporation) is identical to the decrease in the sensible heat energy of the coating unit. The spray rate is a core input parameter affecting the outlet air temperature although it has no relationship with other output variables. An increase of the spray rate raises the amount of the solution covering each individual tablet surface and the time required for evaporation because the evaporation and penetration rate is impervious to the spray rate. Consequently, the change increases the net evaporation rate and therefore reduces the outlet air temperature. Fig. 7 The elasticity index of the outlet temperature
The sensitivity analysis results described so far disclose that evaporation depends more on the process variables while penetration hinges on the tablet properties, particularly on the tablet volume affecting the tablet porosity. Tablet properties governed by upstream processes (mainly the tablet press) should be carefully assessed for the process parameters determination to achieve desired quality attributes of the final product, coated tablet. Further process design, control, and optimization can be also accomplished by employing the proposed model, in-process measurements, and tablet properties.
CONCLUSION
A mechanistic model for the ConsiGma™ coater was presented and the sensitivity of process parameters and tablet properties were analyzed. The evaporation rate as well as the penetration rate was incorporated into the thermodynamic balance equations. The model parameters (heat loss factor, evaporation coefficient, and penetration coefficient) were estimated using experimental coating runs with various process conditions and tablets. The proposed model reliably predicted outlet temperature and relative humidity and allows to assess process output variables (evaporation rate, penetration rate, and drying efficiency) representing the thermodynamic behavior of the coating solution. The sensitivity analysis discovered the inlet air parameters and the tablet surface area were critical to evaporation while the tablet volume (porosity) was highly related with penetration. Consequently, the model not only predicts the drying quality and the tablet moisture content for given process conditions but can be also used in the process design and optimization to achieve target drying quality for various tablets.
