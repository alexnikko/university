Introduction
There is extensive literature about the benefits of exercise for chronic disease, yet none specific to the primary immunodeficiency disease (PID) population. PIDs are a group of rare genetic disorders resulting in impairment and dysfunction of the immune system. The International Union of Immunological Societies (IUIS) updated their classifications of PID in 2015. The IUIS added 34 new gene defects to their 2013 report, resulting in the identification of nearly 300 PID variations [ ]. This group of heterogenous disorders often results in an increased rate and severity of infection, autoimmune diseases, abnormal inflammatory responses, and malignancy [ , , ]. There are significant variations in the reported prevalence of PID, both in the United States and worldwide. While there are limited numbers of participants registered in PID data tracking programs, Bousfiha et al. estimated 270,193 individuals with PID in the USA [ ].
The majority of publications concerning the PID population have focused on pharmacological treatment and medical management of associated conditions. More recently, the focus with research associated with PID has shifted to the concept of quality of life (QoL), specifically health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Individuals with a diagnosis of PID are found to have lower scores for general health and psychosocial well-being, decreased HRQoL, and greater limitations in daily activities [ , , , , , ]. Regular exercise and physical activity has been long recognized as beneficial for physical and mental well-being. Individuals who are more physically active have greater improvements in QoL for a wide variety of medical conditions [ ]. A recent review by Rhodes et al. found that regular physical activity is considered a primary prevention for more than 25 chronic medical conditions [ ]. The World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes that at least 150 min of moderate physical activity, per week, can reduce the risk of certain cancers, diabetes, and heart disease [ ]. While reaching the recommended guidelines established by the WHO will be of greatest benefit, it has been found that even small volumes of physical activity are linked to significant reducation in risk for chronic disease, with an overall estimated risk reduction of 20–30% [ ]. Exercise has been shown to have many benefits for healthy individuals, including improved cardiovascular performance, increased immune function, improved balance, increased metabolic rate, reduction in obesity, and increased muscle mass [ , , ].
While PIDs are caused by a genetic defect, they do share similar features of immune dysfunction and impaired immune responses to infections as secondary immunodeficiency disease, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or cancer. Exercise has been shown to be beneficial for overall physical and mental health in individuals with HIV or cancer [ , , , , ]. Aerobic and resistance exercise improves strength and endurance, and reduces fatigue, depression, and anxiety in HIV-infected individuals [ , , , ] and in those with cancer [ , , ]. Banasik et al. found that yoga may improve physical function and emotional well-being and reduce fatigue in women with breast cancer [ ]. There are multiple studies that show that progressive resistance exercise (PRE), aerobic exercise, or a combination of resistive and aerobic exercise at least three times a week for five or six weeks is safe and contributes to improved health outcomes for individuals with HIV [ , ]. In individuals with HIV, it is recommended that exhaustive or vigorous exercise be avoided, but that low to moderate level exercise is safe and effective [ , , , ]. This is consistent with studies which investigate exercise parameters in healthy individuals. While there is some variation in the published research, the general consensus is that moderate level exercise can help to stimulate or enhance immune function, while vigorous or high-intensity, prolonged duration exercise can have detrimental effects on immune function [ , , , ].
While it is clearly established that exercise and physical activity can benefit a variety of chronic medical conditions, including those with immune deficiency or dysfunction, it is not clear how exercise specifically affects those with PID. Additionally, a better understanding of the barriers to exercising faced by the PID population will help in the development of an appropriate exercise intervention program. Rhodes et al. noted that those with good health status, self-efficacy, high expectations of benefits from exercise, prior history of being physically active, younger age, and stronger social support of activity were more likely to exercise or be engaged in high levels of physical activity [ ]. Health status is another valuable determinant of an individual’s likelihood to maintain a level of physical activity [ ]. Since it has already been demonstrated that individuals with a PID have a lower HRQoL, engaging in moderate to high levels of activity, and maintaining that level of physical activity, may prove challenging.
The purpose of this study was to investigate exercise perceptions and behaviors in individuals with a diagnosis of PID. This survey provides insight about current activity levels, engagement in exercise, and potential barriers to exercise participation for individuals with PID. The information collected in this study will provide foundational information for a future clinical trial that will explore the impact of exercise on the QoL for individuals with PID.
Materials and Methods
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Stockton University and Nova Southeastern University. Informed consent was obtained using the first question of the survey. Those who did not consent were routed to a survey page acknowledging their decision not to participate in the survey. Those who did consent were routed to the survey questions.
Individuals with a diagnosis of PID, who were 18 years of age or older, were invited to participate in an anonymous survey. There were no exclusion criteria. There was no personal identifying data collected from the participants. There was no incentive provided to respondents for participating in or completing the survey.
Qualtrics survey platform [ ] was used to create and distribute the survey electronically, as well as analyze the data. The survey was comprised of a consent acknowledgement question and 37 survey questions. To improve face validity, the survey was initially sent to several healthy individuals, and individuals with a diagnosis of PID, to test the survey platform and to provide feedback on the individual survey questions. These individuals were asked to provide feedback about the structure and flow of the survey tool, as well as the clarity and purpose of the questions. This feedback was incorporated, and some questions were modified for clarity and purpose.
The survey was available for a four-week period during September and October of 2016. The survey was distributed to individuals with PID through public and private social media sites, the Immunodeficiency Foundation (IDF) blog, and the IDF Friends website. Participants were asked to complete the survey only once. Qualtrics was set to allow only one submission per IP address, with the IP addresses blinded to the researchers. It was anticipated that it would take participants 15–30 min to complete the survey. Some questions in the survey required respondents to select only one response, while other questions were coded to allow multiple responses for the same question. Questions were not randomized within the survey. Thirteen screens were used to complete the survey, and respondents were provided with a progress bar (visual and percentage completion). The survey was designed to be compatible with a computer, tablet, or smartphone device. Respondents were permitted to go back and change their responses, and the survey recalled responses if they returned to finish the survey at a later date or time. Participants could skip questions that did not apply to them. Analysis of the survey data was through descriptive statistics (frequency and percentage). Incomplete survey responses were utilized in the data analysis.
Results
Of the 264 surveys returned, 241 were 100% complete; complete and incomplete surveys were used to tabulate data. There were 209 surveys completed by respondents with CVID. The average time to complete the survey, based on all response times was 18.9 min. The demographic information and individual question analysis is provided as descriptive data.
Demographics
The largest demographic group participation was those between 45 and 54 years of age (48.22%, n = 122). Most respondents were female (93.28%, n = 236) (Table 1 ). Most respondents indicated they had been diagnosed with a PID for 1–5 years (46.61%, n = 117) (Fig. 1 ). The demographics were similar for those who reported their diagnosis as CVID (Table 1 and Fig. 1 ). Table 1 Age and gender demographic information Response Percentage (%) Number Overall CVID only Overall CVID only Age 18–29 years 7.91 7.66 20 16 30–44 years 35.18 33.49 89 70 45–64 years 48.22 48.80 122 102 65 years or older 8.70 10.05 22 21 Gender Male 6.72 6.22 17 13 Female 93.28 93.78 236 196 Fig. 1 Length of time diagnosed with a PID
The most prevalent diagnosis reported was common variable immune deficiency, at 82.94% ( n = 209). This was followed by IgG subclass deficiency (16.67%, n = 42), other (6.75%, n = 17), specific antibody deficiency (5.56%, n = 14), selective IgA deficiency (2.78%, n = 7), agammaglobulinemia (2.78%, n = 7), severe combined immune deficiency (1.98%, n = 5), complement deficiency (1.59%, n = 4), Hyper IgM Syndrome (0.40%, n = 1), Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (0.40%, n = 1), and unsure of diagnosis (0.40%, n = 1). Respondents were asked about the time between the start of their symptoms and their PID diagnosis, given the frequent delay in diagnosis for this population. The largest response was for those with a delay of more than 15 years (36.40%, n = 91). Figure 2 describes the breakdown of responses in greater detail. Again, the findings were similar for respondents with a diagnosis of CVID (Fig. 2 ). Fig. 2 Length of time from onset of symptoms until diagnosis of PID
Most respondents reported they were currently receiving subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIG) replacement (54.18%, n = 136). Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was being utilized by 36.65% ( n = 92), 5.58% ( n = 14) of respondents noted that they were not currently receiving treatment for their PID, and 12.75% ( n = 32) were taking prophylactic antibiotics. The remaining 4.38% ( n = 11) indicated the response, other . The comments provided by respondents in this section indicated some were using intramuscular immunoglobulin (IMIG), steroids, or were currently switching treatment options.
Functional Activity Level
Respondents were asked if they had a significant or measurable loss of function in a body area which impairs their ability to perform daily physical activities. Loss of mobility/physical activity was most notable, at 41.32% ( n = 100), closely followed by loss of lung and pulmonary function, at 40.08% ( n = 97) (Table 2 ). For respondents with CVID, loss of mobility/physical activity (41.15%, n = 86) was nearly equal to loss of lung and pulmonary function (41.14%, n = 85) (Table 2 ). Table 2 Loss of function impacting ability to perform daily physical activities Response Percentage reporting (%) Number Overall CVID only Overall CVID only Mobility/physical activity 41.32 41.15 100 86 Lung/pulmonary function 40.08 41.14 97 85 No permanent loss 30.580 26.79 74 56 Digestive function 28.51 26.66 69 62 Neurological function 18.18 17.70 44 37 Hearing 9.92 9.57 24 20 Vision 8.68 8.13 21 17 Other 8.68 8.13 21 17
Respondents rated their overall health as poor (10.48%, n = 26), fair (42.34%, n = 105), good (34.27%, n = 85), very good (11.69%, n = 29), or excellent (1.21%, n = 3) (Fig. 3 ); comparable results were identified for respondents with CVID (Fig. 3 ). When asked how their current health status impacts their ability to perform activities of daily living (ADL) in the home, the primary responses were either no limitation (32.13%, n = 80) or slight limitation (31.73%, n = 79). Respondents were also asked if their current health status limits their ability to perform instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) in the community. The most frequent responses were either slight limitation (32.93%, n = 82) or moderate limitation (29.72%, n = 74) (Table 3 ). Similar responses were noted for respondents with a diagnosis of CVID (Table 3 ). Table 4 summarizes the responses when respondents were asked how their health limits their ability to complete vigorous or moderate activities. Respondents acknowledged that their health limits them a lot (35.08%, n = 87) for vigorous intensity activities and a little (42.91%, n = 106) for moderate intensity activities. Respondents with CVID reported their health limits them a lot (36.71%, n = 76) for vigorous intensity activities, and a little (43.20%, n = 89) for moderate intensity activities (Table 4 ). Fig. 3 Overall health status Table 3 Health status impact on ADL/IADL Response Percentage (%) Number Overall CVID only Overall CVID only ADLs No limitations at all 32.13 32.85 80 68 Slight limitations 31.73 32.37 79 67 Moderate limitations 26.10 24.15 65 50 Severe limitations 10.04 10.63 25 22 IADLs No limitations at all 19.68 18.84 49 39 Slight limitations 32.93 35.27 82 73 Moderate limitations 29.72 28.50 74 59 Severe limitations 17.67 17.39 44 36 Activities of daily living (ADLs); instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) Table 4 Limitation of physical activity levels due to health status Response Percentage (%) Number Overall CVID only Overall CVID only Vigorous activities Not at all 8.87 8.70 22 18 A little 27.82 27.54 69 57 A lot 35.08 36.71 87 76 Completely 28.23 27.05 70 56 Moderate activities Not at all 17.41 16.50 43 34 A little 42.91 43.20 106 89 A lot 31.98 32.04 79 66 Completely 7.69 8.25 19 17
Respondents were asked how much their health limited their ability to participate in common physical tasks. The majority indicated their health had no impact (40.73%, n = 101) on their ability to lift and carry groceries; this was closely followed by respondents who reported their health had a little (35.89%, n = 89) impact on their ability to lift and carry groceries. When asked about their ability to climb two or more flights of stairs, the majority answered a little (42.80%, n = 104), followed by not at all (25.10%, n = 61). Regarding climbing only one flight of stairs, the majority answered not at all (45.68%, n = 111), followed by a little (35.80%, n = 87). The respondents with CVID had similar percentages for these questions. Respondents were asked how much their health limited their ability to participate in activities requiring bending, stooping, or kneeling: 36.63% ( n = 89) answered a little, closely followed by 35.80% ( n = 87) who answered not at all. In those respondents with CVID, the primary response was not at all, followed by a little. Most respondents noted only a little (33.74%, n = 82) limitation by their health on their ability to walk one mile; the remainder of responses was more evenly distributed across not at all (25.93%, n = 63), a lot (21.40%, n = 52), and completely (18.93%, n = 46). The responses showed improved physical activity tolerance when asked about the impact of their health on their ability to a shorter distance, specifically walking a half mile. Respondents indicated their health had no impact (41.98%, n = 102), or only a little impact (30.86%, n = 75), on their ability to walk a half mile. When asked about distances shorter than a half mile and their ability to bathe and dress themselves, most reported their health did not cause limitations (64.20%, n = 156 and 66.67%, n = 162, respectively). These findings were consistent with the responses reported by those with a diagnosis of CVID. Most respondents need to pace themselves, take frequent rest breaks, or reduce their level of physical activity a little of the time (35.95%, n = 87) or a lot of the time (29.34%, n = 71). This finding was again consistent for respondents diagnosed with CVID.
Exercise Participation
Although 33.20% ( n = 82) of respondents indicated they were currently participating in exercise, 36.84% ( n = 91) had not participated in exercise for at least 1 year. Of those with CVID, 32.52% ( n = 67) indicated they were currently participating in an exercise program, while 39.32% ( n = 81) had not participated in exercise for at least 1 year. Respondents engaged in a regular exercise program reported participation in varying amounts of exercise per week with the majority participating in either 1–3 h per week (18.22%, n = 45) or 4–7 h per week (17.81%, n = 44). Those with CVID reported greater participation in exercise per week, with 18.45% ( n = 38) completing 4–7 h, and 16.50% ( n = 34) completing 1–3 h. Those respondents who were participating in an exercise program were most likely to complete 20–40 min per session (35.32%, n = 77) or less than 20 min per session (28.44%, n = 62) (Table 5 ). Table 5 also presents very similar results for those diagnosed with CVID. Respondents were most likely to engage in moderate intensity exercise, such as brisk walking/slow jogging or equivalent (33.47%, n = 83), followed by light exercise, such as slow walking or equivalent (31.05%, n = 77); vigorous exercise (running or equivalent) had the least responses (11.29%, n = 28). Respondents with CVID reported nearly equal participation in light exercise (30.05%, n = 64) and moderate exercise (30.52%, n = 65). Table 5 Weekly and daily exercise participation Response Percentage (%) Number Overall CVID only Overall CVID only Exercise per week Not participating in exercise 40.89 41.75 101 86 Less than 30 min 7.29 8.74 18 18 30 min to 1 h 11.74 10.19 29 21 1–3 h 18.22 16.50 45 34 4–7 h 17.81 18.45 44 38 More than 7 h 4.05 4.37 10 9 Exercise per day Less than 20 min 28.44 28.96 62 53 20–40 min 35.32 34.97 77 64 41–60 min 24.77 24.59 54 45 61–90 min 11.01 11.48 24 21 More than 90 min 0.46 0 1 0
Respondents were also asked to state in which type of exercise they are most likely to participate. The majority of participants indicated walking (75.74%, n = 178) or stretching (57.02%, n = 134) (Table 6 ). Exercise participation for those with a diagnosis of CVID is also provided in Table 6 .

Exercise Perceptions
Most respondents strongly agreed (46.25%, n = 111) or agreed (40.83%, n = 98) that exercise decreases their stress level and improves their mental well-being. They disagreed (58.26%, n = 141) that exercise takes too much time. When asked if they thought exercise would use up too much of their energy and make them too tired, responses were varied, with 34.16% ( n = 83) agreeing , 31.28% ( n = 76) disagreeing , 23.46% ( n = 57) strongly agreeing , and 11.11% ( n = 27) strongly disagreeing . There were also a variety of responses when asked if it was challenging to exercise at home, with 42.44% ( n = 101) agreeing and 37.82% ( n = 90) disagreeing . Respondents continued to have mixed responses when asked if they could easily find a fitness center to exercise, with 20.92% ( n = 50) strongly agreeing , 35.98% ( n = 86) agreeing , 26.36% ( n = 63) disagreeing , and 16.74% ( n = 40) strongly disagreeing . Most respondents were not embarrassed to participate in exercise, stating they disagreed (39.50%, n = 94) or strongly disagreed (31.93%, n = 76). These results were generally consistent with the findings for respondents with a diagnosis of CVID.
Most respondents disagreed (31.09%, n = 74) that participating in exercise would worsen their health status. However, nearly as many agreed (28.99%, n = 69), indicating they felt participating in exercise would worsen their health status (Fig. 4 ). Most respondents were interested in getting involved in an exercise program within the next few months (33.33%, n = 78 strongly agreed and 48.29%, n = 113 agreed ). The results were similar (31.62%, n = 74 strongly agreed and 50.00%, n = 117 agreed ) when asked if they would be interested in participating in a home-based exercise program customized to their individual needs. Fig. 4 Perceptions that exercise will worsen health status
Exercise Barriers
Respondents identified many barriers to participation in an exercise program. Fatigue was the most noted barrier, with 86.97% ( n = 207) overall, and 83.73% ( n = 175) for those with CVID. Other barriers included: exercise is painful (39.50%, n = 94; for CVID 36.36%, n = 76), fear of heath condition worsening (30.25%, n = 72; for CVID 25.84%, n = 54), and lack of motivation (27.31%, n = 65; for CVID 26.32%, n = 55). Respondents were encouraged to add barriers not offered on the pre-selected list. While the comments shared by the respondents demonstrated many other potential barriers, there was a consistent theme that fear of other injuries or illnesses results in barriers to participation, as well as limited endurance, and poor exercise tolerance (Table 7 ). Table 7 Barriers to exercise participation Response Percentage (%) Number Overall CVID only Overall CVID only Fatigue 86.97 83.73 207 175 Exercise is painful 39.50 36.36 94 76 Fear of health condition worsening 30.25 25.84 72 54 Lack of motivation 27.31 25.32 65 55 Lack of time 18.07 14.83 43 31 Fear of being injured 17.65 15.79 42 33 Other 14.71 14.35 35 30 Exercise is not enjoyable 9.66 9.57 23 20 Lack of success in the past 8.40 9.09 20 19 Lack of place or equipment 7.14 6.70 17 14 Lack of support or encouragement 6.30 5.26 15 11 Difficulty setting goals 6.30 5.74 15 12 Lack of confidence 4.62 4.30 11 9 Exercise is boring 3.78 3.83 9 8
Discussion
Findings of this study provide valuable information about current physical activity levels, exercise participation and perception, in addition to barriers for individuals with a diagnosis of PID. Respondents noted that a loss of mobility or physical function, as well as lung and pulmonary issues, were primary contributions to impairment in their daily physical activities. Most rated their health as fair, which is consistent with other studies that show a decreased quality of life for individuals with PID [ , , , , , ]. QoL is related to an individual’s ability to participate in ADL and IADL activities. While ADLs focus on basic tasks, such as washing and dressing, IADLs require greater skill; IADLs are linked to independent living, requiring a higher level of physical and cognitive engagement [ ]. Respondents in this study demonstrated some limitations in ADLs and IADLs, with greater limitations noted when activities require an increased physical demand. Furthermore, they noted less impairment with basic ADL tasks and low intensity physical activity. While this survey was not designed to explore the correlation between exercise behaviors and ability to complete ADL/IADLs, there are several studies that explore this concept in older adults. Venturelli et al. found that a six-month walking program, in adults with Alzheimer’s disease, resulted in a significant improvement (23%) in ADL function [ ]. In a comparison between resistance exercise only and resistance exercise combined with functional exercises and ADLs, Lin et al. found that the combined exercise program improved performance in completion of ADLs in community-dwelling older adults [ ]. Yasunaga et al. found that exercise behavior has a significant effect on IADLs in independently-living older adults; those exercising for 6 months or more had a higher IADL score compared to those not exercising [ ]. While a definite correlation between exercise behavior and ADL/IADL completion cannot be determined from this current survey, evidence from other populations is suggestive that a correlation exists. Further research is needed to determine if this correlation also exists for individuals with PID and, if so, the degree of impact of that correlation.
When it comes to current participation in an exercise program, respondents were either very invested in exercise or had not participated in an exercise program for some time. For those currently exercising, most did less than the recommended 150 min per week at a low to moderate level intensity. The majority participated in low intensity walking and stretching, although a wide-variety of exercises were reported.
Fatigue was the most prominent barrier to exercise. This is not surprising, as fatigue is often one of the most reported complaints for individuals with PID [ ]. Overall, individuals with PID feel exercise will be, or is, beneficial to their overall well-being and will help to decrease their stress levels. When asked if exercise was too hard, too embarrassing, or too challenging to do at home, the responses were varied, indicating perceptions about exercise are not uniform among this population. Some individuals with PID are concerned that exercise will worsen their health condition. This finding has implications for the need to address this fear and provide a proper graded exercise program for individuals with PID. Individuals with a chronic disease are often faced with challenges in managing and maintaining a positive health status. Providing evidence that exercise will not negatively impact their health condition is important future research that requires further investigation.
A better understanding of the current physical activity levels of individuals with a diagnosis of PID is important when designing an exercise program. It has been clearly established that exercise has a variety of critically important benefits for both healthy individuals and those with a chronic medical condition [ , , ] and it is important to establish exercise parameters for the PID population. This population must be provided with an exercise program that is more demanding than their baseline physical exertion, yet does not require them to participate at an unrealistic intensity level. This survey provides foundational information for the design and implementation of an exercise program for individuals with PID. While there will always be individual variations in exercise interests, a low to moderate intensity program with stretching and walking is likely to be well received by this population. Additionally, short duration exercise (less than 20–30 min per day) with a higher frequency (such as five times per week) would be an appropriate recommendation to improve compliance in this population. Individuals with PID are receptive to both home- and community-based exercise programs; the individual’s needs and access to resources must be accounted for in the design of the exercise program. Fatigue must be monitored and mitigated when designing an exercise program, as it is the most significant barrier to exercise for the PID population.
Exercise program recommendations can be adapted from studies involving exercise for individuals with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) or fibromyalgia (FM), as chronic fatigue and pain are also features of these conditions. A 2017 Cochrane Review by Larun et al. found that exercise therapy for CFS did not worsen symptoms, and was more effective at reducing fatigue than passive or no treatment [ ]. A review by Mannerkorpi and Iversen revealed that most patients with FM can participate in low, or self-selected, intensity exercise with a starting point of 40–50% of the maximum predicted heart rate [ ]. The program can then be modified based on the individual’s tolerance, with the goal being long-term adherence to the exercise program [ ]. Individuals suffering from fatigue who have poor exercise endurance or low exercise tolerance should begin an exercise program with no more than 3–5 repetitions for each activity and a ratio of one-minute exercise to 3 min of rest [ ]. Based on the research surrounding exercise and fatigue-based conditions, individuals with PID should engage in a low or moderate level exercise program. They should start with frequent, but short duration exercise sessions, with adequate rest and recovery time. As they progress, they should increase the frequency of their sessions and monitor for adverse effects. As their exercise endurance increases, they can begin to decrease the rest time during the exercise and increase the duration of their exercise program. Most types of exercise will be beneficial, so the program should be designed to focus on the individual’s interests and access, in order to promote adherence.
Given that 93.28% of the survey respondents were female, compared to the typical normalized gender distribution among individuals with PID, there is a strong bias present in this study. This bias is most likely a result of the sampling method, which was performed using social media and support groups. This sampling bias is noted by Whitaker et al.; while social media is very useful due to its speed, low cost, and accessibility to reach less common diagnoses, there is a tendency for social media based sampling to have an overrepresentation of young, white females [ ]. Social media has been found to be an effective recruitment method for difficult to reach populations [ ], suggesting it would be an effective method of recruitment for those with a diagnosis of PID. In addition to the social media sampling bias, women are also more likely to participate in support groups [ ] and to search for online resources for health information [ ], such as the PID social media blogs and support groups used to recruit participants for this study.
Limitations of this survey is lack of validation in this population. The survey questions were adapted from other measures which have established face and content validity (such as the Exercise Benefits and Barriers Scale [ ], the Short Form 36 Version 2 [ ], and the Third National Survey of Patients with PID [ ]). At the time this survey was conducted, there were no outcome measures specific to the PID population. That has recently changed with the publication of the PADQOL-16 [ ]. While Ballow et al. developed the PADQOL-16 to investigate QoL for individuals with PID, it does not assess physical activity levels or exercise participation [ ]. The exercise participation and barriers survey, reported in this publication, is a self-reported measure, which is always subject to recall and response bias. This survey is also limited through its focus on the adult segment of the PID population. The nature of the inclusion criteria of this study excludes a vast number of pediatric patients who are diagnosed with PID. This is an area of great importance for future study. Due to design and structure of the questions utilized in this survey, the questions were not constructed at an appropriate developmental level for a number of pediatric age groups. It is recommended that these questions be modified for a pediatric audience, as well as directed towards parents of children diagnosed with PID, to gather more accurate information about the exercise perceptions and behaviors in the youth PID population.
The survey was also limited in that it was electronically distributed through social media networks. There may be some individuals with PID who do not have access to the technology to complete the survey, or may not be connected to PID support groups on social media, which limits generalizability. Recruitment using social media provides potential for bias due to motivated respondents. Young adults using social media are noted to be more extraverted, while older adults using social media are more open to new experiences [ ]. This more open, extraverted, and potentially motivated audience may contribute to bias in the results. Additionally, this survey is not able to discriminate between physical activity limitations caused by the PID versus those caused by another medical condition or comorbidity. Future research should include validation of the survey, a broader distribution of this survey through both social media and traditional recruitment strategies, additional questions to determine confounding limitations of physical activity, survey answer options to allow for correlations between exercise participation and ADL/IADL completion, a pediatric version of the survey, and real-time physical activity tracking through fitness apps or devices.
Conclusion
This survey provides a glimpse into exercise barriers and perceptions about exercise for a sample of the PID population. Individuals with PID recognize that exercise is important in helping them to improve their overall health and well-being and to reduce their stress levels. Fatigue is the most prominent barrier to participation in exercise, and must be considered when designing and implementing an exercise program for individuals with PID. Individuals with PID should participate in a low to moderate level exercise program, designed to meet their individual needs, interests, and baseline level of exercise tolerance. Careful consideration must be given to the duration, frequency, and exercise to rest ratio. Future research will be critical to determine the safety profile of exercise for individuals with PID, given their already compromised immune function. Research will be needed to determine the optimal dosing of exercise that will improve the health and well-being of individuals with PID, without compromising their immune function.
