Background
Studies of prognosis following acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and clinical trials of secondary preventive therapies conventionally examine the first recurrent coronary heart disease (CHD) event (AMI or revascularization) [ , ]. This approach has provided valuable information about risk factors for recurrent CHD and mortality and the efficacy of secondary preventive care [ , , , , ]. However, quantifying the time to or risk of a first recurrent event does not fully capture patients’ need for intensive long-term treatment of CHD, potentially underestimating the effectiveness of preventive care. Patients may experience multiple CHD-related rehospitalizations over the course of many years after AMI. These rehospitalizations result from recurrent AMIs and revascularization procedures, and also encompass treatment for other acute and chronic forms of CHD.
Examination of the total number of rehospitalizations following AMI may provide a perspective on the burden of CHD that complements the more common approach of examining the first recurrent event. The cumulative burden of recurrent CHD rehospitalizations may be important for individual patients, healthcare providers, healthcare systems, and economic assessment of medical and non-medical treatments inclusive of secondary preventive care. Treatments that reduce the rate of first recurrent CHD episodes may also prevent subsequent recurrent episodes. For example, the risk reduction for multiple recurrent cardiovascular events with high intensity statins is as great as or greater than the risk reduction for the first recurrent event [ , ]. Therefore, interventions and risk factors may have larger impacts on health and healthcare costs than are apparent when traditional analyses examining the first event are conducted.
In this study, we calculated the number and rates of CHD rehospitalizations up to 10 years following hospitalization for AMI among Medicare beneficiaries aged 66 years and older without recent diagnoses of CHD. Additionally, we examined factors associated with the rate of first and, separately, total CHD rehospitalizations.
Methods
Study Population
This retrospective cohort study included Medicare beneficiaries who had a hospitalization for AMI during 2000–2010. Only the first AMI hospitalization during that period, referred to as the index AMI, was included for each individual. Medicare beneficiaries were eligible if, in the year prior to their index AMI and continuing through the hospitalization, they were included in the national Medicare 5 % sample, had traditional fee-for-service coverage (Medicare parts A and B coverage but not Medicare Advantage coverage), and were residents of the 50 United States or Washington, DC. These restrictions were imposed to ensure that claims were observable in the Medicare research data files. We excluded individuals <66 years of age or >110 years of age at the time of their index AMI hospitalization and those claims for CHD in the year prior to the AMI (see Supplemental Methods for definition of history of CHD). In a study of individuals with both Medicare claims and self-reported medical history, 84.3 % of people with no claims for CHD in the prior year had no self-reported history of CHD [ ]. AMI was defined as an inpatient claim with an International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9) discharge diagnosis in any position of 410.xx, excluding 410. x 2 which represents as subsequent episode of care. In a Medicare validation study, this definition had a positive predictive value compared to medical record review of >90 % [ ]. After applying all inclusion and exclusion criteria, the study included 78,085 individuals with AMI. The University of Alabama at Birmingham Institutional Review Board and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Privacy Board approved this study with a waiver of consent.
Beneficiary Characteristics
Demographic characteristics were assessed based on beneficiary enrollment information and included age, sex, race, and Medicare-Medicaid dual eligibility. Median area-level income was determined through ZIP code linkage to 2000 Census files. Medical history was based on claims in the year prior to the initial AMI hospitalization for diabetes, tobacco use, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, abdominal aortic aneurysm, peripheral vascular disease, carotid artery disease, stroke, atrial fibrillation, other arrhythmias, heart failure, depression, inflammatory autoimmune disease, chronic kidney disease, anemia, and cancer (see Supplemental Methods for definitions). History of hospitalization in the year prior to the AMI was assessed. We calculated a Charlson comorbidity index based on inpatient and outpatient claims from the year prior to the AMI hospitalization. Characteristics of the index AMI hospitalization were assessed based on the inpatient claims including any transfers between hospitals. These characteristics included the calendar year of index AMI hospitalization, length of stay, AMI as primary versus secondary discharge diagnosis, and new diagnoses of heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and other arrhythmias among individuals without prior evidence of these conditions.
Beneficiary Follow-Up
Beneficiaries were followed for mortality and CHD rehospitalizations for up to 10 years after discharge for the index AMI with outcomes identified using inpatient claims and enrollment information. Follow-up began on the day following discharge for the index AMI and continued until the earliest of 10 years post-discharge, death, December 31, 2013, loss of fee-for-service coverage, leaving the national 5 % sample, or moving out of the 50 United States or Washington, DC. The majority of beneficiaries were followed until death (65.9 %); follow-up for the remaining beneficiaries was censored on December 31, 2013 (23.5 %), at 10 years of follow-up (10.3 %), or at the time of loss of fee-for-service coverage, leaving the national 5 % sample, or moving out of the 50 United States or Washington, DC (0.9 %). Mortality was detected through the Medicare beneficiary enrollment file, which includes deaths reported by the Social Security Administration. CHD rehospitalizations were defined as inpatient claims with ICD-9 primary discharge diagnoses of 410–414. This definition captures events where the primary reason for hospitalization was AMI, angina, or other forms of acute and chronic CHD.
Statistical Analysis
We calculated frequencies of demographics, comorbidities, and index AMI hospitalization characteristics in the study population. We calculated the 10-year cumulative incidence of mortality using the Kaplan-Meier method and the 10-year cumulative incidence of CHD rehospitalization accounting for the competing risk of mortality [ ]. We plotted the distribution of the total number of CHD rehospitalizations at 1 year, 2 years, 5 years, and 10 years following each beneficiary’s index AMI hospitalization. To account for incomplete follow-up due to censoring for reasons other than mortality, the total number of rehospitalizations was estimated using the observed number of rehospitalizations divided by the observed follow-up time and multiplied by the full length of the follow-up time. For example, if an individual had 3 hospitalizations over 4.6 years and was then censored because of loss of Medicare coverage, the total number of hospitalizations at 5 years was estimated as 5 years times 3 CHD hospitalizations divided by 4.6 years of follow-up. Because individuals who die are no longer at risk for rehospitalizations, the total number of hospitalizations was estimated using the observed number of hospitalizations for those with incomplete follow-up because of death. For example, if an individual had 3 hospitalizations over 4.6 years and then died, the total number of hospitalizations at 5 years was calculated as 3.
Next, the rate of first CHD rehospitalization was calculated as the number of individuals rehospitalized for CHD divided by the follow-up time, with follow-up time accruing until the first CHD rehospitalization after the index AMI hospitalization. The rate of total CHD rehospitalizations was calculated as the total number of observed CHD rehospitalizations, allowing for multiple hospitalizations per individual, divided by the total observed follow-up time.
We examined beneficiary characteristics by the total number of CHD rehospitalizations experienced and the rate ratios for total number of CHD rehospitalizations associated with beneficiary characteristics using Poisson regression models over 1, 2, 5, and 10 years of follow-up. These models used a natural logarithm link, the observed number of CHD rehospitalizations as the outcome, the natural logarithm of follow-up time as an offset, and allowed the variance to be greater than the mean by using a scale parameter. The models included all beneficiary characteristics simultaneously. We also calculated the rate ratios for the first recurrent CHD rehospitalization using Poisson models with a natural logarithm link, CHD rehospitalization as the outcome, the natural logarithm of time until first rehospitalization or censoring as an offset, and a scale parameter to allow the variance to be greater than the mean. Because rate ratios for first CHD rehospitalization and total CHD rehospitalizations were not independent, differences in the associations of beneficiary characteristics with first versus total CHD rehospitalizations were tested using bootstrap resampling [ ]. We first created 1000 simulated datasets of the same size as the original population by sampling with replacement from the original population. Within each dataset, we ran Poisson models for first and total CHD rehospitalizations. For each predictor variable, we took the difference between the beta coefficients for the first and total CHD rehospitalizations. We calculated 95 % confidence intervals around the differences as the 2.5th to 97.5th percentiles of the beta coefficients across simulated datasets. We considered differences between rate ratios for first and total CHD rehospitalizations to be statistically significant if the 95 % confidence interval excluded 0, which is equivalent to a two-sided p -value of < 0.05. Analyses were performed using SAS Version 9.3 (Cary, NC).
Results
Beneficiary Characteristics and Mortality
The population without a recent history of CHD included at total of 78,085 Medicare beneficiaries with an index AMI hospitalization (Table 1 ). Over 25 % of beneficiaries were 85 years of age and older, more than half were women, and 89 % were white. Comorbidities were common, including diabetes (22.9 %), hypertension (46.7 %), heart failure (10.3 %), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (19.2 %). One quarter of beneficiaries had been hospitalized at least once in the year prior to the index AMI. The median follow-up was 2.9 years. At 1, 2, 5, and 10 years following discharge, 18.7, 26.2, 43.9, and 66.7 % had died, respectively (Fig. 1 ).

Number of CHD Rehospitalizations
In this cohort, 16,078 beneficiaries were hospitalized for CHD a total of 23,132 times following discharge for the index AMI. In the year following the index AMI, 10.2 % of Medicare beneficiaries ( n = 7999) experienced one or more CHD rehospitalizations (Figs. 1 and 2 ). Among those with who experienced at least one CHD rehospitalization, 15.8 % had two or more CHD rehospitalizations during the first year following an index AMI ( n = 1265, 1.6 % of the overall population with AMI). In the 10 years following the index AMI, 20.6 % of Medicare beneficiaries experienced one or more CHD rehospitalizations. Among this group, 35.9 % had two or more CHD rehospitalizations ( n = 5773, 7.4 % of the overall population). Fig. 2 Distribution the cumulative number of coronary heart disease rehospitalizations among Medicare beneficiaries following hospitalization for an index acute myocardial infarction
Rates of First and Total CHD Rehospitalizations
Rates of CHD rehospitalization were higher during the first year after discharge than in subsequent years (Table 2 ). The rate of total CHD rehospitalizations, allowing for multiple rehospitalizations per person, during the first year after discharge was 11.8 % higher than the rate of first CHD rehospitalizations. During 10 years after discharge, the rate of total CHD rehospitalizations was 19.6 % higher than the rate of first CHD hospitalizations.

Factors Associated with First and Total CHD Rehospitalizations
The demographics, comorbidities, and index AMI hospitalization characteristics of the study population is presented by total number of CHD rehospitalizations in Supplemental Table 1 . Adjusted associations of participant characteristics with rate of total CHD rehospitalizations were similar to the associations with the rate of first CHD rehospitalization for most characteristics examined (Table 3 ). Age ≥ 85 years versus age 66–69 years and male versus female sex were more strongly associated with rate of first CHD rehospitalization, and Medicare-Medicaid dual eligible status was more strongly associated with rate of total CHD rehospitalizations ( p < 0.05). Compared to individuals whose index AMI hospitalization was 1 week or less, participants whose index AMI hospitalization was 8–14 days had a lower rate ratio for first than total CHD rehospitalizations ( p < 0.05). Rate ratios for cumulative CHD hospitalizations after 1, 2, 5, and 10 years of follow-up are presented in Supplemental Table 2 .

Discussion
In most studies of prognosis following AMI, the first recurrent CHD events are reported, and often the outcomes of interest are first recurrent AMI or revascularization. To more completely characterize the cumulative burden of CHD following AMI and its distribution across patients, we evaluated rates and risk factors for cumulative CHD rehospitalizations, including hospitalizations for angina and other acute and chronic forms of CHD. In this population of Medicare beneficiaries aged 66 years and older discharged after an AMI hospitalization, more than 1 in 5 individuals had recurrent CHD rehospitalizations, and of those, more than a third had two or more recurrent CHD rehospitalizations. These results suggest that only considering the first recurrent CHD event substantially underestimates the burden of disease following AMI. The associations of demographics, comorbidities, and index AMI hospitalization characteristics with rates of first and cumulative CHD rehospitalizations were largely similar. Male sex, older age, and longer length of stay were more strongly associated with first CHD rehospitalization, and Medicare-Medicaid dual eligibility, a marker of poverty, was more strongly associated with total CHD rehospitalizations; while the differences were statistically significant, the magnitude of the differences was small. This suggests that risk factor modification could have the potential to reduce risk not only for the first recurrent CHD rehospitalization, but also subsequent CHD rehospitalizations.
Statistical methods for studying time to first event are well-established in cardiovascular research [ ]. Approaches to study repeated events are also available, and some investigators have applied these methods [ , , , , , ]. However, more commonly, studies only include the first event that occurs [ ]. In two trials, high intensity statins not only reduced the risk of first recurrent cardiovascular events, but also reduced the risk of subsequent events; in these studies, the impact on subsequent events was as great as or greater than the impact on first events [ , ]. Specifically, among patients with recent acute coronary syndrome, 80 mg of atorvastatin reduced the number of first recurrent cardiovascular disease events by 16 % and subsequent events by 19 % compared to 40 mg of pravastatin in the Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (PROVE IT-TIMI) 22 trial [ ]. Similarly, in the Incremental Decrease in End Points Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering (IDEAL) trial comparing 80 mg of atorvastatin to 10–40 mg of simvastatin, the hazard ratios for first, second, third, fourth, and fifth cardiovascular events were 0.83, 0.76, 0.81, 0.76, and 0.72, respectively [ ]. In some cases, a treatment may be more strongly associated with recurrent than first events. In the Candesartan in Heart failure Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and morbidity (CHARM)-Preserved study, candesartan was associated with a hazard ratio for time to first heart failure hospitalization or mortality of 0.86 ( p = 0.05), but a rate ratio of 0.75 ( p = 0.003) when the outcome was recurrent heart failure hospitalizations or mortality [ ].
The value of healthcare, including secondary CHD prevention, is important for evaluating and prioritizing therapies [ ]. Evaluation of cost-effectiveness requires knowledge of or assumptions regarding long-term outcomes of therapy [ , ]. Consideration of the cumulative burden of recurrent CHD hospitalizations may help refine this process.
There are several strengths of the current analysis. The cohort included a large number of individuals without a recent history of CHD and followed their experience for up to 10 years after an index AMI hospitalization. The majority of these individuals were followed for their entire remaining lifetime. This population was drawn from a random sample of Medicare beneficiaries across the United States. Therefore, the results from this study provide high generalizability to older US adults with fee-for-service Medicare coverage. However, we excluded Medicare beneficiaries who were covered under capitated Medicare Advantage plans because claims from these programs are not fully captured in the data available for research; this could limit the generalizability of the results. There are also other important limitations. We relied on administrative claims data for information on CHD rehospitalizations and factors associated with CHD rehospitalization. Because most individuals enter Medicare at age 65 years, we were not able to determine whether the index AMI that marked entry into the study cohort was an individual’s first CHD event. This could have made rates of and risk factors for first and cumulative CHD rehospitalizations more similar than they would have been if the index AMI hospitalization was truly the first CHD event for all individuals. Information was not captured unless it was coded in Medicare claims, and we did not have clinical characteristics of the AMIs. Additionally, we did not include information on secondary prevention therapies in this population. Although prescription drug coverage is now available through Medicare, this program began only in 2006.
Conclusions
Our results highlight that much of the burden of CHD following an index AMI consists of multiple, repeated CHD rehospitalizations. From patient, provider, and health system perspective, consideration of multiple recurrent CHD rehospitalizations are important for understanding prognosis and evaluating the benefits of CHD secondary prevention.
