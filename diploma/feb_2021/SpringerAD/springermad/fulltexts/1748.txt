Introduction
Functional recovery after stroke is associated with anatomic and functional changes in the brain [ , , ]. Commonly, brain-healing mechanisms occur spontaneously after stroke and can lead to some initial functional recovery of injured brain areas. Then, functional changes in non-injured regions can intervene in supporting compensatory mechanisms. In the last years, advances in computational neuroscience and brain imaging techniques have served to supervise in vivo some of these organizational, system-level, processes by means of graph theoretic approaches [ , ] fMRI, magnetoencephalography (MEG), and electroencephalography (EEG) studies have shown that stroke lesions lead to (i) altered interhemispheric connectivity, (ii) critical deviation from efficient processing of segregated and integrated information (supported by optimal “small-world” network topologies), and (iii) abnormal region centrality in the ipsilesional and contralesional hemispheres [ , ]. These findings suggest that stroke causes changes in topology of brain interactions both, at local and global scales.
Depending on the strength and location of brain injury, the degree of improvement is different. In the case of the cerebellum, there is a strong dichotomy between the effects of focal versus neurodegenerative-related lesions. After focal insults, recovery is frequent and long-term disabilities are rare [ ]. Conversely, disabilities due to neurodegenerative processes result in highly disabling motor symptoms that respond poorly to rehabilitation [ ].
This strong dichotomy not only challenges clinicians but also calls into question about the role of cerebellum in brain function. Based on the uniform aspect of the cerebellum [ ] and the diversity of information that is processed in the cerebellar circuits [ ], it is generally argued that the specificity of function is derived from the organization of anatomical connections, especially those with the cerebral cortex [ , ]. Middleton and Strick [ ] proposed that cerebro-cerebellar anatomical connectivity is organized in discrete “parallel circuits,” wherein cerebellar regions that receive input from a given cortical area relay the output back to the same cerebral area, thus forming parallel segregated circuits. Cortical regions that govern this organization include the premotor, prefrontal, and parietal areas—all of which are concerned with motor and nonmotor function [ , , , ]. The anatomical organization of the cerebello-cortical loop was first studied in animal models, and while the topography of the cortico-ponto-cerebellar [ ] and cerebello-thalamo-cortical systems [ , ] has been detailed in monkeys, only recently the advances in neuroimaging techniques have allowed researchers to confirm this organization in humans [ , , , , ].
Functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) studies have demonstrated the presence of subdivisions of cortico-cerebellar loops, even at the lobular level [ ], and have indicated that the extents to which the cerebellum and cerebral cortex are dedicated to these subdivisions are proportional [ ]. Physiological interactions have been examined primarily in experimental studies showing that the motor cortex excitability can be modulated by direct electrical stimulation of the cerebellar cortex or deep cerebellar nuclei. These would suggest that cerebellar input is critical in allowing cortical excitability to be modulated through sensory afferents [ ]. In humans, recent studies have proved that the disruption of cerebellar activity by transcranial magnetic [ ] or direct current [ ] stimulation has an effect on motor cortical inhibition, gait adaptation, motor behavior, and cognition (learning, language, memory, attention), thus raising the possibility of therapeutic applications for cerebellar modulation. In the case of patients with focal unilateral cerebellar damage, neurophysiological studies have confirmed the effect of cerebellar input in the function of motor [ , , ] and somatosensory cortices [ , ].
While a consensus exists on the importance of cerebellar processing, potentially in all functional domains, our knowledge about the mechanisms through which cerebral circuits react or compensate from the loss of cerebellar input remains incomplete. To investigate how the cerebral cortex is reorganized in the absence of cerebellar input, here we examined the effects of cerebellar lesions on the large-scale cortico-cortical interactions. We hypothesized that the absence of cerebellar input would have an important effect on the organization of brain function even under the execution of simple motor tasks. To this end, we analyzed large-scale oscillatory networks of the cerebral cortex during unilateral hand movements in healthy subjects and in patients with unilateral focal lesions of the cerebellum. Results show that in the absence of cerebellar coordination, the cortical networks reorganize and involve spatially distant areas not physiologically affected. This suggests that under the effect of focal cerebellar insults the brain responds by increasing the number of resources needed to accomplish simple tasks, such as self-paced finger movements.
Materials and Methods
Ten healthy subjects and 10 patients with focal cerebellar lesions (mean age 48.1 ± 16.12 years; 3 females; 9 right-handed) were recruited at Fondazione Santa Lucia (Rome). Handedness was evaluated using the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (EHI) [ ].
All patients underwent a neurological examination, and their motor impairments were quantified using the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS) [ ], which ranges from 0 (absence of any deficit) to 100 (presence of all deficits to the highest degree), whereas the kinetic limbs subscale score ranges from 0 to 52. Intellectual level was evaluated per the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Revised (Wais-R) [ , ].
The cognitive performance of the patients was assessed using a detailed neuropsychological battery specific developed for cerebellar patients, already described in a previous work [see ].
In particular as explained in the cited paper, a cumulative z -score cognitive index was calculated for each patient.
T2-weighted scans and 3D-T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid-acquisition gradient echo (MPRAGE) images (TR = 11.0 ms; TE = 4.4 ms, TI = 300 ms; flip angle = 15°) were obtained from each subject using a system that was operated at 1.5 T (Siemens, Magnetom Vision, Erlangen, Germany). The involvement of cerebellar nuclei was evaluated by using the Dimitrova’s 3D-MRI Atlas [ ]. All patients (CBRL group) had unilateral damage in the cerebellum (left hemisphere 3 , right hemisphere 7 ; Table 1 ) that was confirmed by structural MRI (Fig. 1a ), resulting in various degrees of lack of voluntary coordination of muscle movements (Table 1 , ICARS). Overall 7 of 10 patients presented deep cerebellar nuclei lesion (see Table 1 ).

[ ]. Case codes as in Table 1 . Cerebellar lesions were first drawn on every patient’s 3D MPRAGE in native space using MRIcro ( http://www.sph.sc.edu/comd/rorden/mricro.html ), thus creating a lesion mask. The 3D T1-mprage images were processed by using SPM2 (Wellcome Dept. Cogn. Neurol., London; http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm ). For each subject, images were manually reoriented according to the default template in SPM2 and then normalized into the standard proportional stereotaxic space [Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI)]. b Two conditions were considered: affected hand condition and unaffected hand. In case of subjects with right cerebellar lesion ( n = 7 representative subject CB4 is depicted at the bottom), the left cortical hemisphere (colored in red ) would be deprived from the cerebellar input and thus movement of contralateral right hand would represent the affected hand condition. Conversely, left hand movement would correspond to the unaffected hand condition. For subjects with left cerebellar lesion ( n = 3), left hand movement would represent the affected hand condition and right hand movement would represent the unaffected hand condition. c Two periods of interest were considered in the study corresponding to the preparation (PRE) and execution (EXE) phase of the hand motor task. These periods were segmented from the EMG onset and their duration was fixed to 500 ms
The exclusion criteria were the presence of any extracerebellar lesion on MRI or any noncerebellar neurological damage or disease. None of the patients were taking medications possibly affecting the central nervous system.
All clinical assessments were performed by an expert physician (ML) less than 1 week before the experimental session. The patients’ demographics and clinical characteristics are listed in Table 1 .
The control (CTRL) group comprised 10 healthy subjects (mean age 34 ± 7.03 years; 5 females; 9 right-handed). They had no history of neurological or psychiatric disorders, and they were free from medication and alcohol use and drug abuse. The ethical committee of “Fondazione Santa Lucia” approved this study (Prot. CElPROG.442-07), and all participants gave written informed consent.
Recording Session and Preprocessing
All participants were seated comfortably in a dimly lit room with their upper limbs resting on a cushion, and they were instructed to perform a brisk self-paced middle finger extension followed by relaxation (the finger return to rest position by gravity) movement approximately every 7 s. This interval was sufficient to allow the subjects to relax and restore their baseline mental state before each subsequent movement. Specifically, the recording session consisted of 4 blocks of 50 movements, alternating between the affected and unaffected hands, for a total of 100 trials for each side. The forearm of the hand that was involved in the task was stabilized by a comfortable plastic support that allowed extension of the finger. During the task, the subjects were asked to avoid eye movements, clenching of the jaw, swallowing, and other body movements that were unrelated to the finger extension by remaining as relaxed as possible throughout the session and fixing their gaze on a point in the center of a black screen, 1 m from their heads.
Electroencephalographic (EEG) and electromyographic (EMG) activity was recorded on a 64-channel BrainAmp (Brainproduct GmbH, Munich, Germany) system with 200-Hz frequency sampling and a standard gain equal to 1000. EEG signals were referenced to the linked-ear signal. A source reconstruction technique was then applied to improve the spatial resolution of the EEG activity (see section “ Reconstruction of Cortical Brain Networks ”). The electrode impedance values were kept below 10 KΩ. The first 59 channels, arranged over the scalp according to an extension of the standard 10–20 montage, were used to record EEG signals; the 60th channel was used to record electrooculographic (EOG) vertical activity; and the remaining 4 channels were positioned over the extensor digitorum communis muscle of the forearms (2 for each side, one of which acted as reference), to record the EMG activity of the finger extensions. These signals were available to the experimenter for online monitoring of arm and eye movements to reiterate to the subjects the importance of relaxing their muscles and avoiding eye movements throughout the session.
In the offline preprocessing, EMG signals were digitally high-pass-filtered at 20 Hz and rectified. All subjects showed clear EMG bursts associated with their finger extension. Movement onsets were then automatically marked by fixing a threshold equal to the 30 % of the maximum amplitude across all the trials [ ]. These onsets were subsequently verified through visual inspection by an expert electrophysiologist (DM) and manually corrected in the case of evident mismatches. Based on these onsets, we segmented two representative temporal epochs of EEG activity: (i) the preparation phase (PRE) from − 500 ms to onset and (ii) the execution phase (EXE) from the onset to + 500 ms (Fig. 1c ). These intervals were selected to examine the task-related oscillatory networks that were active close to the onset of movement. An expert neurophysiologist (DM) inspected all trials and rejected EEG segments that contained vertical ocular blinks and other residual pronounced muscular artifacts.
Motor Task Scoring
In the experimental motor task, a specific score was computed to evaluate the rhythmicity of consecutive hand movements by measuring the variability in cadence (or pace). In particular, we considered the delay between two consecutive movements, i and i + 1 , by computing the difference in time between the respective onsets ( t i and t i +1 ) in the EMG analysis (see “ Recording Session and Data Preprocessing ”). Then, the pace variability P v was measured for each condition as the standard deviation of all intertrial differences in time: $$ {P}_{\mathrm{v}}={\left({\scriptscriptstyle \frac{1}{M-1}}{\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{M-1}{\left({\varDelta}_i-\overline{\varDelta}\right)}^2}\right)}^{{\scriptscriptstyle \raisebox{1ex}{$1$}\!\left/ \!\raisebox{-1ex}{$2$}\right.}} $$ (1) where M is the number of total trials, Δ i = t i + 1 − t i , and \( \overline{\varDelta} \) is the mean of all intertrial differences.
Hemisphere Flipping
In the offline analysis, we eventually flipped the functional (EEG signals) and anatomical (EEG sensor positions) data along the midsagittal plane of the head of the three patients with the right cortical hemisphere (R) affected (left cerebellar damage), corresponding to a lesion in the left cerebellar hemisphere (Fig. 1a ). This step has been performed frequently to avoid oversegmentation of the available population [ , , ], allowing us to proceed as if all patients had the lesion in the right hemisphere of the cerebellum—thus with the left cortical hemisphere (L) affected (Fig. 1b ).
Consequently, throughout the text and figures, we refer to right hands as the affected hands, to the left cortical hemispheres as those that lack cerebellar input, to left hands as the unaffected hands, and to the right cortical hemispheres as those with intact cerebellar input.
Reconstruction of Cortical Brain Networks
Volume conduction is a well-known issue in EEG/MEG analysis that obscures the localization of the underlying cortical sources, affecting FC measurements [ ]. To circumvent this issue, the cortical activity in each trial was estimated from M = 59 scalp EEG signals using a source imaging technique that involves realistic models to characterize the effects of electrical conductivities of head structures, equivalent dipole modeling, and linear inverse solutions [ , , ]. The final computation provides greater spatial resolution by accessing the activity that is generated by N = 4094 sources, distributed equally over the cortical surface. More details are available in Supplementary Materials .
FC was measured for the entire spectrum of frequencies (0–100 Hz) between the activities of each pair of cortical sources through the imaginary coherence [ ], which is roughly equivalent to the cross-correlation in the frequency domain. This measure is insensitive to spurious connectivity due to volume conduction, identifying only actual brain interactions [ ] and avoiding residual field spread and crosstalk effects that could persist, even after the source estimation [ , , ]. Despite the theoretical advantages, caution should be used in practice when interpreting the results [ ]. More details are available in Supplementary Materials . FC was estimated on relatively short time windows (PRE, EXE periods are 500 ms); however, the large number of trials, or epochs, gives a total duration of 50 s (or equivalently 10000 time points) which is typically enough to estimate reliable brain networks [ ].
To determine the spectral coherence in the principal physiological frequency bands, we then averaged the FC values in five specific frequency ranges: theta (3.5–7.5 Hz), alpha (7.5–12.5 Hz), beta1 (12.5–20.5 Hz), beta2 (20.5–29.5 Hz), and gamma (29.5–40.5 Hz). A cortical brain network was finally constructed for each participant in each condition, phase, and frequency band using a connectivity matrix (NxN), in which the entry (i,j) contains the magnitude of the FC between the i-th and j-th cortical sources.
Graph Analysis
The topological organization of the brain networks—from local brain nodes to the entire brain—was quantified using metrics that were derived from the graph theory, a mathematical theory that models connected systems through nodes and links [ ]. To transform our brain networks into graphs, we used a commonly adopted procedure in which the lowest FC values of the brain connectivity matrices are canceled and the remaining values are binarized [ ].
Specifically, we used a density-threshold approach, as defined in [ ], which retained the strongest values of the connectivity matrices, leading to sparse graphs with N = 4094 nodes and a low percentage of links (1.56 % or L = 130,703 links). This approach has been criticized mostly in its sensibility in directly evaluating link weights [ ]. To avoid this criticism, we fixed the same density-threshold for all subjects and frequency bands in order to let all the brain networks having the same number of links. Indeed, this avoided that difference between graph quantities could have emerged due to a mere difference in number of links and not to a true reorganization.
Low connection densities (as the one we selected) are often representative of many brain network properties [ , ]. Further, the selected percentage ensures the absence of disconnected nodes, at least for purely regular (0.0156 > 2/N) and random (0.0156 > log(N)/N) networks [ ]. The resulting graphs were finally characterized using several metrics that capture network properties at various topological scales, from large to small scale.
“Small-World” Efficiency
We characterized the coarser-grained brain network properties using the small-world ( S w ) index by calculating the global- ( E glo ) and local-efficiency ( E loc ) quantities. These quantities are based on shortest paths in the network [ ] and respectively measure the efficiency with which information is transferred between topologically distant brain nodes (i.e., integration) and the tendency to form highly connected clusters of nodes (i.e., segregation). Small-world networks typically have higher global and local efficiencies with respect to random graphs with the same number of nodes and links [ ]. According to Downes [ ], the small-world index S w is obtained as: $$ {S}_{\mathrm{w}}=\left({E}_{\mathrm{glo}}/{E}_{\mathrm{glo}}r\right)\left({E}_{\mathrm{loc}}/{E}_{\mathrm{loc}}r\right) $$ (2) where E loc r and E glo r are the mean efficiency values from 100 equivalent random graphs [ ]. By definition, a brain network with S w > 1 has small-world properties, and higher S w values reflect more efficient organization of the brain network.
Connectivity Range
We computed the average Euclidean distance between the functionally connected nodes in each brain network using the available 3D coordinates of the cortical sources in the Tailarach space. This metric was introduced to evaluate the cost of brain networks, assuming that there is a price for each connection being made and that this cost is higher when the spatial distance that is to be covered is longer [ ]. We adopted the same metric to examine the overall recruitment of remote areas in the brain network. Thus, in a given brain network, we defined the connectivity range C t as: $$ {C}_{\mathrm{r}}=\frac{1}{L}{\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^N{\displaystyle \sum_{j\ne i=1}^N{a}_{ij}\sqrt{{\left({x}_i-{x}_j\right)}^2+{\left({y}_i-{y}_j\right)}^2+{\left({z}_i-{z}_j\right)}^2}}} $$ (3) where L is the number of existing links (fixed to 130,703 for all brain networks), a ij identifies the i-j entry of the connectivity matrix, and x , y , and z are the spatial coordinates of the nodes. By definition, C r is a positive number: higher C r values indicate more distal connected nodes in the brain network, implying a longer-range integration of information.
Hemisphere Density
Brain networks are spatially embedded into the anatomical structure of the cerebral cortex, and thus, they can be modeled as spatial networks [ ]. This process naturally introduces topological scales that are related to anatomical organization—specifically, two modules that correspond to the cortical nodes of the right (R) and left (L) hemispheres can be defined. We used the inter ( K inter )- and intra ( K intra )-connection density to measure the density of the connectivity between and within hemispheres, respectively [ ]. Higher K inter values reflect more links between the two hemispheres, and higher K intra values indicate more links within the right (or left) hemisphere. More details are available in Supplementary Material .
Node Centrality
On the smallest topological scale, we used the inter ( D inter )- and intra ( D intra )-node degree to measure the connectivity of the cortical sources with the contralateral and ipsilateral hemispheres, respectively [ ]. A higher D inter value connotes greater importance of the cortical source (or node) for overall interhemispheric density. Rising D intra values reflect increasing importance of the node for overall intrahemispheric density. More details are available in Supplementary Material.
Statistical Contrasts
The chief objective of this study was to characterize the effects of the lack of cerebellar input on the organization of the cortical brain network during self-paced movement executions between and within subjects. We first contrasted brain network properties in the CTRL and CRBL groups separately under the affected and unaffected hand conditions. Then, we directly compared the brain network properties under the affected and unaffected conditions only for the CRBL group. Two-tailed Wilcoxon rank - sum t test with a statistical threshold of 0.05 was used to analyze differences between subjects. Two-tailed paired Wilcoxon signed - rank t test with a statistical threshold of 0.05 was used for within-subject comparisons.
Corrections for multiple comparisons were used when analyzing differences along various frequency bands. For small-scale topologies, in which local graph indexes were computed for each brain node, a correction for multiple comparisons was also performed. Specifically, a nominal significance level of p = 0.05 was defined and adjusted for multiple comparisons by rough false discovery rate (RFDR) correction [ ], according to the number of network links for which the t tests were computed ( p adjusted to 0.026 ).
Cluster Mass Statistics
Source-level statistics neglect the spatially constrained nature of imaging data. To circumvent this issue, we used cluster-based statistics, which are more informative than source-level statistics with regard to neuroanatomical differences between small groups of subjects [ , ]. In particular, we defined the cluster mass over the cortex mesh model as the sum of all suprathreshold T values within each cluster. The threshold for significance was then fixed at the 95th percentile of the distributions of absolute cluster mass values.
Correlations Between Network and Functional/Clinical Scores
Spearman’s correlation coefficient, with a p level of 0.05 as the statistical threshold for significance, was used to analyze correlations between brain network properties and ICARS, Z-cognitive, and pace variability P v scores.
Results
The most significant results were obtained for high-frequency (>22 Hz) brain networks. Figure 2 shows the gamma brain networks from representative CTRL and CRBL subjects for the affected and unaffected conditions during the EXE phase (see Supplementary Fig. S1 for the PRE phase). The CTRL and CRBL networks differed already on qualitative inspection. The links under the affected and unaffected hand conditions were more widespread if the cerebellum was damaged. These differences were present in the PRE and EXE phases—more markedly in the latter. Fig. 2 Brain networks constructed from scalp EEG signals during movement execution. Brain networks refer to a representative CTRL ( left column ) and CRBL ( right column ) subject for the affected ( top line ) and unaffected hand ( bottom line ) condition during the movement execution (EXE phase). Brain networks are represented as graphs where nodes identify the cortical sources, as modeled by the source imaging technique, and links stand for significant functional connectivity between nodes as measured by the imaginary coherence. In each subplot the brain network is represented according to different views, i.e., from above (nose pointing down), right ( R ) and left ( L ) lateral views. Black links represent interhemispheric connectivity. Blue links show intrahemispheric connectivity within the unaffected hemisphere, while red links show connectivity within the affected hemisphere
To quantify these qualitative differences, we adopted a graph theoretic approach that examined multiple network properties in a hierarchical manner—from the largest to smallest topological scales. This method is appropriate for describing the organizational principles of the brain network at various connectivity levels [ ].
Contrast Between Groups
The small-world index S w (see “ Graph Analysis ,” “ Materials and Methods ”) was used to measure organization of the large-scale brain network in terms of the integration and segregation of information. S w values during the PRE and EXE phases were higher in the CRBL versus CTRL group for all frequency bands and under the affected and unaffected hand conditions (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S2 ). Fig. 3 Averaged small-world ( S w ) values for brain networks during movement execution. a Affected hand condition. Gray bars represent the average S w values for the CRBL group, white bars stand for the average S w values of the CTRL group in the EXE phase. Frequency bands are illustrated along the x -axis. Dashed horizontal line indicates the reference value for random networks (i.e., S w = 1). Error bars denote standard deviations. Asterisks indicate significant ( p < 0.05, RFDR-corrected) between-subject differences. b Unaffected hand condition . Same graphical conventions of panel a
In the PRE phase, significant differences were limited to the unaffected hand condition and beta2 ( T = 2.99, p = 0.003) and gamma ( T = 2.38, p = 0.017) bands (Supplementary Fig. S2 ). In the EXE phase, significant differences were observed in the gamma band ( T = 2.53, p = 0.011) for the affected hand condition, for the beta2 ( T = 2.23, p = 0.026) and gamma ( T = 2.76, p = 0.006) bands in the unaffected hand conditions (Fig. 3 ). In general, the significantly higher S w values in the CRBL group were attributed to the significantly greater global efficiency ( E glo ) index scores because no significant changes were reported in local efficiency ( E loc ) values (Table 2 , Supplementary Table S1 ). The only significant increase in E loc was recorded in the alpha band in the PRE phase under the affected hand condition.

Notably, the connectivity range ( C r ) tended to be significantly higher in the CRBL group in the same phases, bands, and conditions that were significant in the analysis of the small-world index (Fig. 4 ). In the PRE phase, for the affected hand condition, a significant difference was seen in the beta2 band ( T = 2.46, p = 0.014), and in the unaffected hand condition, marginally significant differences were observed in the beta2 ( T = 1.58 p = 0.064) and gamma ( T = 2.08, p = 0.038) bands (Supplementary Fig. S3 ). In the EXE phase, for the affected hand (Fig. 4a ), we found a significant difference in the gamma band ( T = 2.76, p = 0.006); in the unaffected hand condition (Fig. 4b ), there was a significant difference in the beta2 ( T = 2.91, p = 0.004) and gamma ( T = 2.08, p = 0.038) bands. Figure 4 also shows an inverse relationship between the frequency content of the brain networks and the connectivity range, consistent with the evidence that higher frequency bands exhibit decreased long-distance coupling [ , , ]. At the cellular level, this phenomenon can be explained by the fact that slower oscillators involve more neurons in a larger volume and are associated with larger membrane potential changes because in longer time windows spikes of many more upstream neurons can be integrated [ ] Fig. 4 Averaged connectivity range ( C r ) values for brain networks during movement execution. a Affected hand condition.

On the intermediate topological scale, we considered the connection density between ( K inter ) and within hemispheres ( K intra ). At this level, we observed higher values in the CRBL group for K inter but not for K intra (Table 2 and Supplementary Table S1 ). Significant differences in K inter index were noted in the PRE phase in the unaffected hand condition (gamma p = 0.009 and beta2 p = 0.045 uncorrected) and in the EXE phase for the unaffected (gamma band p = 0.026) and affected (gamma p = 0.009 and beta2 p = 0.002) hand conditions (Fig. 5a ).

The color and size of each cortical node quantifies the resulting T value, i.e., the larger the size and the lighter the color, the higher is the T value. Only significant T values ( p < 0.05, RFDR-corrected) are represented. The number of significant cortical nodes ( n ), as well as the name of the involved Brodmann areas ( BA ) are also reported along the pictures
On the smallest topological scale, we measured the centrality of the nodes by computing their node connectivity with the ipsilateral ( D intra ) or contralateral ( D inter ) hemisphere. In the EXE phase, nodes in CTRL and CRBL subjects had similar degrees of connectivity in the ipsilateral hemisphere, whereas CBRL nodes had more long-range connections with the contralateral hemisphere in the affected and unaffected hand conditions in various bands. In the affected hand condition , we observed a significant cluster ( n = 34) of cortical nodes over the left frontal lobe (i.e., contralateral to the affected hand) for the gamma band, corresponding partially to Brodmann areas (BA) BA9 (41.18 %), BA46 (35.29 %), BA45 (11.76 %), BA8 (8.82 %), and BA10 (2.94 %) (Fig. 5b , top panels). In this cluster, the D inter values of CRBL patients were significantly higher compared with CTRL subjects ( p < 0.05, RFDR-corrected). In the CRBL group, this cluster was connected to a larger number of brain nodes in the other hemisphere (i.e., ipsilateral to the affected hand) as compared to the CTRL group (Supplementary Fig. S5 ). A smaller, significant ( n = 17) D inter cluster ( p < 0.05, RFDR-corrected) was also noted for the theta band in the parietal cortex of the right hemisphere (i.e., ipsilateral to the affected hand), corresponding approximately to BA40 (41.18 %), BA39 (29.41 %), BA22 (23.53 %), and BA37 (5.88 %) (Supplementary Fig. S4a ). In the unaffected condition , we observed a significant cluster ( n = 27) of cortical nodes in the left temporo-parieto-occipital junction (i.e., ipsilateral to the unaffected hand) for the gamma band. In this cluster, the D inter values of the cortical nodes that partially overlapped with BA37 (37.04 %), BA 21 (33.33 %), BA20 (11.11 %), BA22 (11.11 %), and BA19 (7.41 %) were significantly higher in the CRBL group ( p < 0.05, RFDR-corrected) compared with CTRL patients (Fig. 5b , bottom panels). A significant cluster ( n = 42) was also present in the beta2 band, in which the D inter values of the cortical nodes that overlapped with right BA18 (64.29 %), BA17 (23.81 %), and BA31 (11.90 %) (i.e., contralateral to the unaffected hand) were significantly ( p < 0.05, RFDR-corrected) higher in the CRBL versus CTRL group (Supplementary Fig. S4b ). Further, a smaller ( n = 19) significant ( p < 0.05, FDR corrected) cluster was seen in the alpha band in the left frontal cortex (i.e., ipsilateral to the unaffected hand), partially encompassing BA10 (94.74 %) and BA9 (5.26 %) (Supplementary Fig. S4b ).
Exact coordinates of significant brain nodes in the Tailarach space are reported in Supplementary Table S2 for the sake of completeness. No significant differences in D inter index were observed in the PRE phase or in D intra index for any condition, band, or phase.
Contrast Between Conditions
In the within-subject comparison between conditions—affected versus unaffected hand—there were no significant differences in any large ( S w , C r ), intermediate ( K inter , K intra ), or small-scale ( D inter , D intra ) graph indexes in any frequency band or phase (data not shown).
Correlation with Functional/Clinical Scales and Task Performance
To determine the significance of the changes in the brain network with regard to the clinical conditions of CBRL subjects, we examined the correlations between the graph indexes that differed significantly between CTRL and CRBL groups and the motor performance (ICARS), general intelligence (IQ-WAIS-R), and Z-cognitive scores [ ]. No significant correlation was observed for any condition, band, or phase (data not shown).
In the finger extension task, CRBL subjects had greater variability in timing than CTRL patients with the affected and unaffected hands, as evidenced by the P v data between groups (Fig. 6a ). CRBL group P v values were significantly higher than in the CTRL group for the affected/right ( T = 2.60, p = 0.009) and unaffected/left hands ( T = 2.08, p = 0.038) (see Fig. 6a ). Notably, performance of the affected and unaffected hands did not differ significantly in CRBL subjects. In correlation analyses between P v data and graph indexes, there was no significance in the CRBL or CTRL group for any frequency, phase, or condition, with the exception of the small-world index and connectivity range. In particular, the small-world values of the gamma band during the EXE phase marginally correlated with P v values in the affected ( R = 0.661, p = 0.044) and unaffected ( R = 0.648, p = 0.049) conditions (Fig. 6b, d ). In the same band, the connectivity range correlated with pace variability only during the EXE phase under the affected hand condition ( R = 0.697, p = 0.031) (Fig. 6c ).

Discussion
In this study, we examined the EEG motor-related functional connectivity network in the cerebral cortex in patients with unilateral cerebellar damage. Our graph analysis revealed differences between the brain networks of CTRL and CRBL subjects on several topological scales. Our hierarchical approach allowed us to measure changes progressively—from fine- (e.g., node degrees) to coarse-grained (e.g., small-world property) brain network properties. With this method, we focused on hand conditions (affected, unaffected), bands (from theta to gamma), and phases (PRE, EXE).
Differences between groups were hierarchically consistent across topological scales in the gamma band of the EXE phase under the affected and unaffected hand conditions and were primarily associated with more efficient reorganization of the brain network and overall increases in long-range connectivity. These network changes correlated with the task performance of the CRBL subjects, especially in the affected hand condition, and highlight the significance of the gamma band over the other frequency bands in cortical mechanisms of reorganization after cerebellar lesions.
Cerebellum and the Gamma Band
There is compelling evidence of the importance of cerebellar input for gamma band activity. Since their discovery in the cerebral cortex by Gray et al. [ ], gamma band oscillations continue to be debated. Recent views have stressed the function of gamma band synchronization in the encoding of information and selective transmission of information [ ], particularly through feed-forward coincidence [ ] and coherent phase-coupling across structures [ ].
Attention [ ] and spike phase synchronization [ ] depend highly on gamma band oscillations. Further, gamma band oscillations are not generated by cellular input from a remote pacemaker but are supported by the intrinsic components of a cortical microcircuit [ ].
Conversely, thalamus [ ] and cerebellum [ ] intervene in controlling inter-areal coherence of gamma band activity. The cerebellum projects heavily on the thalamic nuclei—specifically, motor [ ] and intralaminar nuclei [ ]—that are involved in gamma frequency oscillation. The cerebellum has been implicated in various gamma band-related functions, such as sensory-motor integration [ ], attention [ ], timing [ ], synchronization [ ], and feed-forward [ ] control mechanisms.
Further, self-paced extension movements, such as those that we examined, are characterized by strong regional coupling in the gamma band that is not observed during isometric contractions [ ]. Thus, although it was not predicted, the observed gamma frequency selectivity of the brain network changes after cerebellar damage is consistent with our current knowledge of the function and substrate of high-frequency oscillations.
As a critical note, we notice that muscle contaminations can bias EEG gamma activity [ ]. To reduce this possible bias, we adopted linear inverse procedures to spatially filter scalp EEG signals [ ] and we used imaginary coherence to elude instantaneous contaminations in functional connectivity estimation.
Task Selection
In this study, we analyzed FC brain networks using a specific task, comprising self-paced repetitive middle finger extensions. The tapping task and, specifically, finger extension have been the focus of many neuroscience groups in studying dynamic changes in oscillatory neural activity [ ] and constitute a widely used paradigm in various contexts [ ]. In particular, cerebellar damage, although it influences tapping regularity, does not affect the ability to adapt to changes in pace [ ]. Further, selecting brisk self-paced finger extension over flexion enhanced the voluntary aspects of the task, decreasing the automaticity of the motor performance. The advantages and drawbacks of task-related FC with respect to resting-state FC have been discussed recently [ ] and will not be addressed further here.
It is well known that motor connectivity patterns are influenced by movement parameters [ ]. In an fMRI resting-state study, FC changes have been observed in essential tremor patients in the same cerebello-thalamo-cortical loop active in healthy volunteers performing a tremor task [ ]. In that study, tremor index correlated with the FC changes observed. In our study, the timing of the movement (pace variability) correlated with the FC brain network properties only in cerebellar patients and not in healthy controls. Thus, although not conclusive, present study supports the idea that cortical FC changes after cerebellar damage are not related to movement characteristics but rather to compensatory reorganization of the brain network. Overall, these evidences show that tremor and pace variability, both present in cerebellar pathology, might be sustained by different cerebellar dependent circuits.
Efficient Network Reorganization and Long-Range Brain Connectivity
As shown in Figs. 2 and 3 , the networks in the EXE phase of CBRL subjects differ from those of controls, as evidenced by more distributed organization in the network, characterized by a wider spread of links (see connectivity range Fig. 4 ) and increased small-world efficiency in the gamma and beta2 bands. These differences exist, albeit to varying extents, independently of whether CBRL subjects use the ataxic (affected hand condition) or supposedly healthy hand (unaffected hand condition). This outcome also holds in part for the PRE phase (Supplementary Fig. S2 ).
From a network perspective, the more distributed connectivity, associated with greater small-world efficiency, suggests enhanced propagation of information and overall system function [ ]. Conversely, the connection of various nodes implies a physical cost (e.g., volume, wiring, metabolic) that is proportional to the distance between areas [ ]. Whereas physiological brain networks tend to balance wiring cost and topological efficiency, several pathologies, such as Alzheimer disease [ ] and autism [ ], are associated with aberrant reorganization of cost-efficiency due to increased long-distance connectivity.
Thus, the observed rise in connectivity range in the gamma band is an index of lower function in terms of higher energy cost. For the same task, the CRBL group used more (i.e., distal) brain resources than CTRL subjects, implicating areas that are not involved when the cerebellum is working properly. Thus, the participation of distant regions in the brain network, notably between hemispheres (see next section “ Contribution of Interhemispheric Connectivity ”) might form a compensatory mechanism: greater integration of normally segregated neural processes is needed to perform the task because the cerebellum is not active.
Conversely, the opposite could be also true. The lack of cerebellar input could impede the suppression of functional connectivity between distal brain areas, which are not needed to perform the task. In this case, the existence of longer-range connectivity, with greater small-world efficiency, would represent a possible pathological phenomenon that creates disturbances in the motor system. Consistent with this hypothesis, poorer task performance (higher P v ) correlates with connectivity range and small-world values (Fig. 6b, c ).
One might wonder if the difference in the age ranges between the CRBL and CTRL groups could have affected the reported brain network differences. Indeed, effects of aging on brain networks have been recently reviewed showing a characteristic decrease of long-range connectivity [ ]. In our study, we found that the connectivity range (measuring the spatial distance covered by the links) is higher in the CRBL group as compared to CTRL (Fig. 4 ). This result indicates that CRBL have in average an increment of long-range connections; this is opposite to what could have been expected if age had had a concrete impact.
We are aware that our data do not allow us to make a definitive conclusion given the relatively small sample size and the presence of some marginal significance. Nevertheless, the key function of the cerebellum in modular cortical synchronization is consistent with ample data on cerebro-cerebellar interactions. Cerebellar input to the cortex intervenes in boosting the synchronization of cortical activity (particularly in the gamma band frequency; see previous section on the cerebellum and gamma band) within [ ] and between areas [ ]. Further, the control of excitability in cortical modules is an important mechanism of the cerebellar feed-forward control loop [ , , ]. Overall, the reduction in cerebellar drive affects the selection of task-specific loops, leading to wider participation of heterogeneous areas in the functional brain network.
Notably, differences in small-world efficiency between CBRL and CTRL patients were also present during movements with the unaffected hand (Fig. 3b ). These differences were similar but not equal to those in the affected condition. In the unaffected condition, the S w index was higher in the beta2 and gamma bands for the PRE (Supplementary Fig. S2 ) and EXE phases. However, the S w index correlated with P v scores only in the gamma band and during the EXE phase (Fig. 5c ). These results indicate that in the presence of unilateral cerebellar lesions, despite the nearly completely crossed cortico-cerebellar anatomical connectivity [ , ], reorganization of the postlesion functional brain network is not unilateral. Yet, this evidence calls into question the unilaterality of the cerebellar cortical influence and to what extent a simple motor task, such as the self-paced finger extension, can truly be considered unilateral [ ].
Contribution of Interhemispheric Connectivity
Unilateral/bilateral influence of focal cerebellar lesions over cortical functions can be further assessed by examining interhemispheric connectivity changes. In the affected hand condition, we observed a significant rise in interhemispheric connectivity density in the gamma band (Fig. 5a , K inter ), which was determined primarily by the local connectivity increase (Fig. 5b , D inter ) in the frontal association areas of the cortical hemisphere contralateral to the cerebellar lesion. Specifically, the involved cortical nodes lay in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPC BA9 and 8) and areas 45 and 46, which are involved in the cerebello-cortico-cerebellar loop [ , ]. Increased connectivity in the DLPC is expected, based on its function in attention and the greater attention load that is required to perform ataxic movements [ ]. Notably, BA 45 and 46, in addition to language-related functions, mediate executive functions. A simple explanation for increase in interhemispheric connectivity is that in the absence of cerebellar input, functional connectivity with the contralateral hemisphere is reinforced as a compensatory mechanism.
Similar reasoning applies for the interpretation of the local connectivity increase of the angular gyrus ipsilateral to the finger movement in the theta band (Supplementary Fig. S4a ), which is usually related to sensorimotor integration processes [ , ]. Overall, bilateral cerebellar involvement in fronto-parietal executive function control loops is well established [ ] and bilateral cerebello-thalamic projections have been also recently confirmed in humans [ ]. Connectivity increase in the two cortical hemispheres is present in different frequency bands, i.e., gamma and theta. The role of cerebellar input in affecting gamma band has been explained above. Regarding the theta band, it is conceivable that the hemisphere ipsilateral to the hand movement would be more involved with cognitive aspects and thus would present connectivity changes in the more cognitive theta frequency band.
Interhemispheric connectivity changes were also observed in the unaffected hand condition (Fig. 5a , K inter ), wherein cortical nodes with significant increases in D inter were localized in the temporo-parieto-occipital cortices, contralateral to the cerebellar lesion and ipsilateral to the involved hand (Fig. 5b , D inter ). These regions are involved in time-keeping [ ], and their implication in the unaffected hand condition is difficult to reconcile. We hypothesize that because timing for self-pacing is a bilateral function [ ], the cortical hemispheres must normally interact to ensure the exchange of information. With unilateral cerebellar damage, this interaction would be reinforced in an attempt to compensate for the imbalance of cerebellar input to the cortical hemispheres.
Bilateral cortical involvement, also in simple learned tasks, is a well-known phenomenon [ ] that is even more important during recovery after unilateral cortical lesions [ ].
It is generally considered that cerebellar afferents are mostly crossed and unilateral; thus, bilateral influence of cerebellar output on cerebral cortex is often attributed to interhemispheric cortical connections. On the other side, it is plausible that the existence of interhemispheric connections within the cerebellum [ , ] may play a role on influencing bilaterally cerebral cortex. In particular, this mechanism might explain the FC changes observed in the unaffected hand condition.
Taken together, our findings indicate that cerebellar input affects the organization of large-scale brain networks independently of the anatomical loops that are primarily affected. Further investigation will have to elucidate if those changes in small-world efficiency and connectivity range represent compensatory or pathological mechanisms.
Cerebro-cerebellar Interactions
Projections between the cerebral cortex and cerebellar nuclei are well established [ ]. The main connection is a disynaptic excitatory pathway relayed at the ventral thalamus reaching different neocortical regions, including motor, premotor, prefrontal, and posterior parietal areas. Beside the ventral thalamus, cerebellar nuclei project to other thalamic nuclei [ ]. In particular, the intralaminar nuclei which receives cerebellar fibers and in turn projects to the basal ganglia and diffusely to the superficial layers of the cerebral cortex [ , ]. Furthermore, it is worth recalling that the cerebello-thalamic pathway is not strictly unilateral and cerebellar nuclei can influence thalamus and cortex bilaterally [ ]. Thus, the intrinsic organization of the cerebellar circuits with Purkinje cell inhibiting the excitatory output of the deep cerebellar nuclei, as well as the complexity of the thalamic projections convening cerebellar input to different areas and layers of the cerebral cortex, may explain the complexity of the connectivity changes observed in subject with cerebellar lesions.
Several groups have focused on the relationship between the cerebellum and cerebral cortex using FC approaches, based on fMRI data, in healthy subjects [ , , , ]. FC changes have been reported in various pathological conditions, such as autism [ ], schizophrenia [ ], and Parkinson disease [ ], and in behavioral disorders [ , ]. However, such instances in cerebellar conditions have been limited to degenerative diseases.
In an fMRI study, Solodkin et al. [ ] reported a progressive increase in FC in the lateral cerebellum and thalamus, correlating with disease duration in spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) 1. Changes in several FC indexes have been also observed in functional and morphological MRI studies in SCA2 [ ], SCA7 [ ], and SCA17 [ ]. In this study, we have provided novel data on the influence of cerebellar lesions on brain network reorganization by combining large-scale cortico-cortical FC and graph theoretic approaches.
Cortical and cerebellar activity is coupled in many motor [ , ] and nonmotor [ , ] tasks and has generally been interpreted to be the consequence of cortical driving over cerebellar circuits [ ]. However, various studies have also highlighted the importance of cerebellar driving in cortical activity changes that have been observed after cerebellar lesions [ , ] and, more recently, after cerebellar transcranial direct current cerebellar stimulation [ , ]. Thus, coupling between cortical and cerebellar activity is considered to be bidirectional, the mechanisms of which remain unknown [ , ].
Our findings provide novel insights into the nature of cerebro-cerebellar interactions during self-paced iterated finger extension. In a first approximation, pace variability ( P v ) can be interpreted here as an index of dexterity—for example, the performance of musically trained individuals is at least two times more stable compared with novices [ ]. Accordingly, our experimental task can be considered as a learned skill and it is well known that anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and the cerebellum are all involved in the early phase of skill learning, as their activity progressively decreases with skill automation [ ]. The increase of P v in subjects with cerebellar damage is tantamount to their having lost their training, reflected on the brain network level by the involvement of distal cortical areas. Present task was not aimed at analyzing learning effects and future studies are needed to examine whether the observed connectivity pattern could be altered through practice.
Despite its speculative nature, the idea that cerebellar contribution to motor skill learning is mediated by silencing the interactions among distant cortical modules would be paramount for interpreting the effects of cerebellar modulation on functional recovery, a rapidly expanding field that awaits credible theoretical models [ , ].
