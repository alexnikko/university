Introduction
The Australian raven ( Corvus coronoides ) is a member of the order Passeriformes and belongs to the Corvidae family. Horsfield and Vigors described the Australian raven ( Corvus coronoides ) in 1827 (Vigors and Horsfield ), which is native to much of northeastern and southern Australia. The Australian raven has all black plumage and is a largish bird (48–52 cm) with white eyes and a longish, strong beak. It has prominent throat hackle feathers which fan out when the bird is calling and the throat expands. In Australia, they inhabit farmlands, dunes, beaches, mangroves, islands, urban areas, and alpine regions up to 1500 m (Pizzey et al. ). Ravens can live up to 21 years in the wild (Wasser and Sherman ) and are unusually intelligent. Part of their success as a species is due to their omnivorous diet. They are also extremely versatile and opportunistic in finding sources of nutrition, feeding on carrion, insects, cereal grains, berries, fruit, small animals and food waste. Australian ravens are often located in coastal regions because these areas provide easy access to water and a variety of food sources as well as stable weather patterns without extreme cold or hot temperatures (Ewins et al. ).
To date, 12 Isospora species have been reported in the Corvidae family (Order: Passeriformes) worldwide (Upton et al. ; Poon and Chew ; Upton et al. ), with the exception of the Australian continent. In the present study, we describe a new species of Isospora from an Australian raven ( Corvus coronoides ) in Western Australia, both morphologically and molecularly, and propose the name Isospora coronoideae n. sp.
Materials and methods
Sample collection
A juvenile Australian raven was admitted to the Kanyana Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre (KWRC), Perth, in November 2018. The bird was in poor body condition and had a dirty vent. A faecal sample was collected on the day of admittance to KWRC and parasitological examination showed large numbers of unsporulated coccidian oocysts. Treatment was implemented and the bird was released back at the found location 2 weeks later. Faecal samples were also collected and screened from an additional 33 Australian ravens that were admitted to KWRC over the next 8 months.
Morphological analysis
The presence of coccidian oocysts was determined by direct microscopic examination of a faecal suspension in saline, as well as by faecal float. Faecal flotation was performed by suspending a portion of faeces in a saturated sodium chloride and 50% sucrose ( w / v ) solution. Faeces was also mixed with 2% ( w / v ) potassium dichromate solution (K 2 Cr 2 O 7 ), and the mixture was poured into a petri dish to a depth of less than 1 cm and kept in the dark at room temperature to aid sporulation. The morphological characteristics of sporulated oocysts were observed using an Olympus CH-2 binocular microscope (Olympus Corp., Tokyo, Japan).
DNA extraction
Two hundred milligrams of faecal sample was used to extract DNA with a Power Soil DNA Kit (MolBio, Carlsbad, CA) following the manufacturers’ instruction with some modifications including subjecting the sample to five freeze/thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen and boiling water prior to DNA extraction, to lyse the oocysts. A negative control with no faecal sample was included.
PCR amplification of 18S and 28S ribosomal sequences and the COI gene
Nested PCR for 18S, 28S rRNA and partial COI loci was conducted as described by Yang et al. ( ).
Sequence analysis
PCR amplicons from the 18S, 28S rRNA and COI loci were purified using in-house filter tip method previously described (Yang et al. ). All PCR products were sequenced using the specific primers used to amplify the target loci respectively. PCR products were sequenced in triplicate by using an ABI Prism™ Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
The results of Sanger sequencing were analysed and edited by Finch TV® v1.4.0. ( http://seq.mc.vanderbilt.edu/dna/html/SoftDetail.html ). Sequences were compared with existing Isospora and other coccidian parasite sequences available on GenBank using BLAST searches and aligned with reference sequences with BioEditor ( http://bioeditor.sdsc.edu/download.shtml ).
Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic trees for Isospora spp. were constructed at the 18S, 28S and COI loci with additional sequences reported in GenBank. Parsimony analyses were conducted using MEGA version 7 (MEGA 7: Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis software, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA). Maximum likelihood (ML) and neighbour-joining (NJ) analyses were conducted using the Tamura-Nei algorithm based on model selection using ModelTest in MEGA 7. Bootstrap analyses (1000 replicates) were performed to assess reliability of the inferred tree topologies.
Line drawing
Oocyst line drawings were created using Inkscape ( http://www.inkscape.org/en/ ).
Results
Fifteen out of 34 Australian ravens were shedding coccidian oocysts (single isosporan morphotype) when screened by wet mount and faecal float (44.1% prevalence).
Description
Sporulated oocysts of I. coronoideae n. sp. are ovoid, 21.2 (18.4–23.9) × 18.8 (16.9–20.6) μm, with a shape index (length/width) of 1.13, and a smooth and bi-layered oocyst wall, 1.2 μm thick (outer layer 0.9 μm, inner 0.3 μm). A polar granule and oocyst residuum is present, but a micropyle is absent. The sporocysts are ovoid-shaped, 16.3 (13.7–18.9) × 10.7 (8.4–12.9) μm, with a shape index (length/width) of 1.52. Stieda and substieda bodies are present, the Stieda body being small and knob-like and the substieda being round. Each sporocyst has four vermiform sporozoites arranged head to tail. A sporocyst residuum is present. The sporozoite is crescent-shaped, 9.0 (8.9–9.2) × 2.7 (2.3–3.0) μm, with a shape index (length/width) of 3.33 (Fig. 1a–c and Table 1 ).

Phylogenetic analysis of I. coronoideae n. sp. at the 18S rRNA locus
A 1223-bp unique 18S rRNA sequence from I. coronoideae n. sp. ( n = 15) was aligned with 13 other Isospora spp. sequences: I. neochmiae (KT224380) (Yang et al. ), I. butcherae (KY801685) (Yang et al. ), I. sp. MS-2003 (AY331569), I. sp. MS-2003 (AY331571) (Schrenzel et al. ), I. sp. MAH-2013a (KF648870), I. sp. MAH-2013b (KF648871), I. gryphoni (AF080613) from an American goldfinch (Olson et al. ), I. sp. 1JM-2013 (JX984668) and I. robini (AF080612) (Carreno and Barta ), I. manorinae (KT224379) from a yellow-throated miner (Yang et al. ), I. serinuse (KR477877) (Yang et al. ), two Isospora spp. sequences from domestic pigeons ( Isospora sp. Tokyo - AB757860 and AB757862), as well as 14 Eimeria 18S rRNA sequences from GenBank. Toxoplasma gondii was used as outgroup.
Phylogenetic analysis using distance, parsimony and ML revealed that I. coronoideae n. sp. exhibited 98.9% similarity to I. neochmiae (KT224380) from a captive-bred red-browed finch and Isospora sp. (AB757860) from domestic pigeons ( Columba livia domestica ), 98.5% similarity to I. g ryphoni (AF080613) and 98.3% similarity to I. manorinae (KT224379) (Table 2 ). As I. coronoideae n. sp. 18S sequence was the only species available from the avian Corvidae family, in the present phylogenetic analysis, it sat in an independent clade from the Isospora spp. from other passerine birds (Fig. 2 ).

Phylogenetic analysis of I. coronoideae n. sp. at the 28S locus
A 1373-bp unique 28S rRNA sequence from I. coronoideae n. sp. ( n = 15) was compared with 36 Isospora 28S sequences in GenBank (Fig. 3 ), 31 of which were Isospora sequences from North American passerine birds characterized by Schrenzel et al. ( ) and 5 Isospora sequences from Western Australian passerine birds: I. anthochaerae (KF766053) from a red wattlebird, I. butcherae (KY801686) from a silvereye, I. manorinae (KT224381) from a yellow-throated miner, I. neochmiae (KT224382) from a captive-bred red-browed finch and I. serinuse (KR477878) from a domestic canary (Yang et al. ; Yang et al. ; Yang et al. , ; Yang et al. ). Analysis revealed that I. coronoideae n. sp. had 95.4% similarity with I. manorinae (KT224381) and 94.8% similarity with I. anthochaerae (KF766053) (Table 3 ). As with the 18S sequence, there was no other 28S sequence from the Corvidae family available. The 28S sequence from I. coronoideae n. sp. sat on a separate branch and formed a clade with I. anthochaerae (KF766053) and I. manorinae (KT224381) (Fig. 3 ).

Phylogenetic analysis of I. coronoideae n. sp. at the COI locus
A 725-bp unique fragment of the COI gene of I. coronoideae n. sp. ( n = 15) was compared with 22 sequences from various Isospora spp. and an additional 18 Eimeria sequences available at this locus in GenBank. Toxoplasma gondii was used as outgroup (Fig. 4 ). I. coronoideae n. sp. showed 99.8% similarity with I. butcherae (KY801687) from a silvereye and 99.7% similarity with I. neochmiae (KT224378) from a captive-bred red-browed finch (Table 4 ). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that I. coronoideae n. sp. grouped together with I. butcherae and I. neochmiae to form a sub-clade in the COI phylogenetic tree (Fig. 4 ).

Discussion
In the present study, coccidian oocysts were identified in the faeces of Australian ravens ( n = 15). Morphological and molecular analysis showed that it was a novel species of Isospora which we have named I. coronoideae n. sp. The sporulated oocysts of I. coronoideae n. sp. are morphologically different from other Isospora species in the Corvidae family and are also morphologically distinct from all Isospora species identified from the other Passeriformes ( http://biology.unm.edu/biology/coccidia/passer1.html ) (accessed on 01 May 2019). Similar to I. corvi from the Corvidae family (Poon and Chew ), an oocyst residuum is present; however, the different oocyst dimensions exclude the possibility of them being the same species (Table 1 ).
As with the morphological analysis, sequence analysis at three loci (18S rRNA, 28S rRNA and COI) revealed that I. coronoideae n. sp. exhibited the highest similarity with other Isospora species from Passeriformes in Western Australia. At the 18S rRNA loci, I. coronoideae n. sp. exhibited the highest similarity with I. neochmiae (98.9%) from a captive-bred red-browed finch (Yang et al. ) and 98.3% similarity to I. manorinae (KT224379) from a yellow-throated miner (Yang et al. ). At the 28S rRNA locus, it exhibited the highest similarity with I. manorinae (KT224381) from a yellow-throated miner (95.4%) (Yang et al. ) and I. anthochaerae (KF766053) from a red wattlebird (94.8%) (Yang et al. ). At the COI locus, it had a higher similarity with I. butcherae (KY801687) from a silvereye (99.8%) (Yang et al. ) and I. neochmiae (KT224378) (99.7%) (Yang et al. ). Interestingly, all these three bird species have overlapping home ranges on the east coast of Australia. They all have very different feeding styles however, with finches eating grass seeds, ravens eating mainly on the ground and silvereyes feeding mainly in trees (Pizzey et al. ). As there were no 18S, 28S rRNA and COI sequences from other Isospora species from the Corvidae family available in GenBank, we only compared our sequence data with Isospora species from Passeriformes found in Western Australia.
In the present study, morphology and molecular analysis were used to characterize the oocysts in the faeces from an Australian raven as a new species of Isospora , named Isospora coronoideae n. sp. after its host. This finding highlights the diversity of Isospora species in Australian birds. Further analysis is required to determine the clinical impact (if any) of Isospora coronoideae n. sp. on its host and the host range of this new species.
