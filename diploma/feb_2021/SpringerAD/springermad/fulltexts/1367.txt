Background
Phlebotomine sand flies (Diptera: Psychodidae) are the principal hematophagous insects confirmed to be competent vectors for the protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania (Kinetoplastida: Trypanosomatidae), responsible for different forms of leishmaniases in mammals, including humans (Killick-Kendrick ). In Europe and especially in the Mediterranean region, Leishmania infantum is the main causative agent of human visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and canine leishmaniasis (CanL). The main vectors in Europe are Phlebotomus ariasi , P. perniciosus , P. perfiliewi , P. neglectus , P. balcanicus , P. kandelakii , P. langeroni , and P. tobbi (Maroli et al. ). Leishmania infantum has been also reported to be spreading into parts of Central Europe where autochthonous cases of animal leishmaniases have been reported: Germany (Bogdan et al. ), northern Italy (Maroli et al. ), Hungary (Tánczos et al. ), or Romania (Mircean et al. ).
Romania is a country with a temperate continental climate and with Mediterranean climatic influences in the southern regions. It was traditionally regarded as a non-endemic country for VL and CanL, only with historical sporadic autochthonous human and canine cases described (Manicatide ; Mihăilescu and Niciloff ; Copăceanu et al. ; Minculescu et al. ; Lupașcu et al. ; Lupașcu et al. ). However, recent reports of autochthonous VL (Gogoaşe et al. ) and CanL (Mircean et al. ) have been described. Moreover, a serological survey on CanL in Romania indicated the presence of a CanL focus, with a low, but alarming prevalence for a non-endemic country (Dumitrache et al. ). Recent imported cases of CanL in foci and areas with possible presence of vectors raised the awareness on this zoonosis in Romania (Pavel et al. ; Tanase et al. ). Furthermore, the high number of the Romanian workers performing seasonal agricultural labor in Mediterranean countries has been linked to several imported VL in the country (Neghina et al. ). Eight species of sand flies were identified so far in Romania: P. papatasi , P. alexandri , P. sergenti , P. longiductus , P. balcanicus , P. neglectus , P. perfiliewi , and Sergentomyia minuta (Dancesco ). For all species, a dataset of geographical coordinates and distribution maps based on historical data was recently published (Dumitrache et al. ). From the eight species present in Romania, only three ( P. neglectus , P. perfiliewi , and P. balcanicus ) are competent vectors for L. infantum (Maroli et al. ).
The risk of VL and CanL caused by L. infantum in endemic countries is influenced by the density of the vector populations (Risueño et al. ). Sand flies have a seasonal activity and their density can be influenced by a series of factors such as geographical distribution, temperature, and other climatic parameters or microhabitat particularities (Alten et al. ). The seasonal activity of sand flies was studied in most Mediterranean countries (i.e., Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, Greece, Cyprus, Turkey, and Palestinian Territories) where one to three generations of adults have been recorded per season (Alten et al. ; González et al. ; Sawalha et al. ). However, no seasonal dynamic studies from countries at the northern border of sand fly distribution with temperate continental climate are available ( https://ecdc.europa.eu/en/disease-vectors/surveillance-and-disease-data/phlebotomine-maps ).
In the actual context of the apparent re-emergence of VL and CanL in Romania as well as the increased number of imported cases, the present study was designed to understand the sand fly abundance and seasonal dynamics in a non-Mediterranean country situated at the northern border of sand fly distribution.
Materials and methods
Study area, microhabitat, and insect collection
The study was conducted under the frame of VectorNet project, using a standardized protocol (ECDC and EFSA ). The study was performed in the village of Fundătura (46.794333 N, 28.030333 E), Vaslui County, Romania, where a population of sand flies has been found during previous field studies. Fundătura is a small village with a permanent population of 475 inhabitants (Romanian National Institute of Statistics ) and has an agricultural-based local economy. It has a typical temperate continental climate with eastern influences, high thermal amplitudes, and non-uniform precipitations. The average annual temperature is around 9 °C and the average annual rainfall between 450 and 700 mm (based on data provided by the Romanian National Meteorological Administration). Sand fly abundance was recorded in several animal premises from a single traditional Romanian household. The equipment used consisted in CDC (Centre for Disease Control and prevention) miniature light traps (Trappola per Monittoraggio Zanzare, IMT Original 2002, Italy). Four traps were placed in the poultry and pigeon house (clay and wood structure), a trap in the cow stable (brick structure), a trap in the horse stable (brick structure), a trap in the pig shed (brick structure), and a trap in the rabbit enclosure (brick structure). The household included the living house located close to the animal shelters and an interior yard with shelters on three sides and a fence on the fourth side (Fig. 1 ). Some shelters in the area are built in a traditional way, with a composition of clay and dry straw on a wood structure (Fig. 2 ), while some others were newly built using bricks. Organic matter and animal dejections were abundant near the animal shelters. Each premise was sampled nine times for two consecutive nights at each sampling, at 19-day intervals, between 10th of May and 26th of October 2017. The total number of light trap/days placed in the study was 144 (1 trap × 8 premises × 2 consecutive night × 9 times). The traps were set in and around the animal shelters, on the very same place for the entire study, close to the walls, at a 1.5 m height from the ground. After each trapping night, the insects were collected, stored in tubes with 70% ethanol, and taken to the laboratory for species identification.

Species identification
Sand flies were separated from the other insects and morphologically identified using entomological keys (Lewis ). The males were identified according to the specific features in the aedeagus, stylopodite, and coxopodite, and the females were identified based on the pharynx and spermatheca.
Environmental data collection
The minimum, maximum, average daily temperatures, average relative humidity, wind speed, and precipitations for the study locality were collected from the Romanian National Meteorological Administration (RNMA) for each day of the sampling period (see Online Resource 1 ).
Statistical analysis
First, the distribution of data was assessed using D’Agostino-Pearson normality test. Then, the correlation between the number of specimens collected and temperature (min, max, and average), percentage of humidity, precipitations, wind speed, sampling period, and host/house type were determined using Pearson or Spearman’s rank correlation tests. The strength of correlation was established based on absolute value of r ( s ) coefficient, as follows: 0.00–0.19 “very weak” correlation; 0.20–0.39 “weak” correlation; 0.40–0.59 “moderate” correlation; 0.60–0.79 “strong” correlation; 0.80–1.0 “very strong” correlation. Multiple regression analysis was performed to identify the independent variables that influence/can predict the presence/absence of sand flies. Independent samples t test was used to compare the number of collected sand flies by gender and sampling period. The significance level was set at a value of p ≤ 0.05. The statistic was performed with MedCalc software.
Results
All ( n = 150) collected sand flies were Phlebotomus perfiliewi . The highest abundance was recorded at the beginning of August, accounting for 71.3% (107/150) of all captured sand flies (Fig. 3 ). The first day with positive traps was 12 July 2017 and the last day 24 August 2017 (Table 1 ). Three sampling periods out of nine were positive for sand fly collection, sampling 4 (S4) (12 and 13 July 2017), sampling 5 (S5) (2 and 3 August 2017), and sampling 6 (S6) (23 and 24 August 2017) (Table 1 ). A statistical correlation between the total number of collected sand flies and the sampling period was recorded. When comparing the total number of collected sand flies per sampling to S4 and S6, respectively, S5 had the highest number of collected specimens (S5 vs. S4 p = 0.12, and S5 vs. S6 p = 0.05). No statistical difference between S4 and S6 was recorded (S4 vs. S6 p = 0.31). From the total number of collected sand flies, 18% were males and 82% were females ( p = 0.0001), statistically significant only for S5 (90.7% 97/107 females, and 9.3% 10/107 males; p = 0.05) (Table 1 ). The highest percentage of males (48.1%; 13/27) was found in the first night of insect collection, and the lowest (9.3%) at the end of the season ( p = 0.03). From the total number of females, 20.3% were blood-fed, with the highest percentage (84.0%; 21/25) at the beginning of August ( p = 0.001). Raw data and details on number of specimens, gender, and blood-fed females for each positive trap and each positive collecting day are presented (see Online Resource 2 ). Only the four traps placed in the poultry enclosure built from clay and wood were positive, with a very strong statistical correlation between the number of sand flies collected and the host (poultry)/material used to build the shelters ( r s = 0.99, p = 0.0001) (Fig. 4a ). Climatic data details for the nights with sand fly collection are provided in Online Resource 1 . The statistical analysis of the climatic data showed a strong correlation between the total number of collected sand flies with the minimum temperature ( r s = 0.62, p = 0.007, 95% CI 0.21–0.84) (Fig. 4b ) and maximum temperature ( r s = 0.67, p = 0.003, 95% CI 0.30–0.87) (Fig. 4c ), and a medium correlation with the average temperature ( r s = 0.548, p = 0.018418) (Fig. 4d ). The average daily temperature for the days with sand fly collection was between 16.3 ± 5.1 °C and 31.0 ± 6.1 °C, while for the days with no sand fly collection, it was between 11.4 ± 6.2 °C and 24.4 ± 7.3 °C (Table 2 ). The total number of collected sand flies was negatively correlated with increased values of the average relative humidity RH% ( r s = − 0.450, p = 0.061118) (Fig. 4e ). A weak statistical negative correlation was registered between the total numbers of sand flies and the precipitations ( r s = 0.290, p = 0.243018) (Fig. 4f ) and wind speed ( r s = − 0.211, p = 0.399918) (Fig. 4g ). The average humidity for the days with collected sand flies was between RH% 45.5 ± 7.3 and 63 ± 9.9, while for the days with no sand fly collection it was between RH% 53.5 ± 3.5 and RH% 61.9 ± 4.8 (Table 2 ). The average wind speed (as provided by RNMA) for the days with collected sand flies was between 10.5 ± 2.4 km/h and 22 ± 2.8 km/h, while for the days with no sand fly collection, it was between 11.3 ± 1.7 km/h and 17.1 ± 1.8 km/h (Table 2 ).

The analysis of the climatic data shows that the first presence of sand flies was registered only after the average minimum temperature for the previous 7 days was above 15 °C ( p = 0.0322) (Fig. 4h ). When simultaneously compared to multiple variables (climatic and environmental), a statistical significance of the sand fly presence was observed ( p = 0.0004) (Table 3 ).

Discussion
The epidemiology of sand fly–borne diseases is highly influenced by many factors, including the sand fly distribution, seasonal activity, density, and number of generations per year. The present study is the first to evaluate the seasonal dynamics of sand flies in a non-Mediterranean European country, situated at the northern border of sand fly distribution. In the Mediterranean basin, endemic for both VL and CanL, studies evaluating the seasonal dynamics of the phlebotomine vectors are available in France (Rioux et al. ; Prudhomme et al. ; Alten et al. ), Italy (Maroli et al. 1977; Rossi et al. ; Tarallo et al. ; Lisi et al. ; Alten et al. ), Spain (Gálvez et al. ; Risueño et al. ; Alten et al. ; González et al. ), Greece (Ivovic et al. ; Chaskopoulou et al. ; Alten et al. ; Boutsini et al. ), Portugal (Maia et al. ; Alten et al. ), Turkey (Volf et al. ; Kasap et al. ; Alten et al. ), Cyprus (Alten et al. ), the Palestinian Territories (Sawalha et al. ), and Georgia (Alten et al. ) (Table 4 ). Across its Mediterranean distribution range, the seasonal dynamics of P. perfiliewi was studied in Greece (Ivovic et al. ; Chaskopoulou et al. ), Italy (Maroli and Bettini ; Rossi et al. ; Tarallo et al. ; Lisi et al. ), Turkey (Volf et al. ; Kasap et al. ), and the Palestinian Territories (Sawalha et al. ) over a period of one to six collecting seasons (Table 4 ). The number of peak months of sand fly activity is associated with the number of generations of adults (Alten et al. ). The mono-modal trend (single peak occurring in July–August) is one of the four trends described so far for sand flies (Alten et al. ), and the one anticipated to be present in Romania, based on the degree-day developmental requirements described for P. papatasi in Turkey (Kasap and Alten ). These developmental requirements were confirmed for average daily temperatures for an entire year in four macro-regions in Romania before the study was performed (data not shown) in order to estimate the best interval for the trapping period, the possible positive months for sand fly activity, and the number of generations of adults/collecting season. The present study confirms the mono-modal abundance trend for P. perfiliewi in Romania. A highly significant correlation was described between latitude, altitude, annual average temperature, the first date of sand fly collection, and the type of the abundance trend (Alten et al. ). Phlebotomus ariasi (France), P. kandelakii (Georgia), and P. balcanicus (Georgia) displayed a mono-modal trend as P. perfiliewi in the present study. The recorded latitudes for these species were situated between 41.700278 N (Georgia), 43.973056 N (France), and 46.794333 N (current study in Romania). Phlebotomus perfiliewi displayed a mono-modal trend in all the locations where its seasonal abundance was studied (Greece, Italy, and Palestinian Territories) (Table 4 ). The mono-modal trend was present at different latitudes, even though a highly significant correlation between a latitude decrease and the increase in number of vector density peaks was described for some other sand fly species (Alten et al. ). For example, P. perniciosus , a sympatric species for P. perfiliewi across most of their distribution range, displayed a confluent bi-modal trend (two confluent peaks) in Spain, Italy, and Central Portugal, at higher latitudes, while in Southern Portugal, it displayed a distinctive bi-modal trend (two distinctive peaks) (Alten et al. ). Phlebotomus perniciosus displayed a tri-modal trend (three distinctive peaks) in Italy (Lisi et al. ). Similar differences were observed for P. tobbi , which has a tri-modal abundance trend in southern Cyprus, and a bi-modal abundance trend in Turkey (Alten et al. ).

The variations in the distribution, diversity, and abundance trends of the sand fly species were correlated with climatic factors (temperature and precipitations) and environmental factors (geographical barriers, habitat, abundance, and distribution of the vertebrate hosts) in most of the available studies (Volf et al. ; Kasap et al. ; Ivovic et al. ; Simsek et al. ; Tarallo et al. ; Alten et al. ). The climate, as a result of the biotic and abiotic properties of one environment, correlated with the altitudinal gradient and the latitude, are the most important factors that influence the sand fly life span (development period) in one territory (Belen and Alten ; Simsek et al. ). The non-optimal environmental conditions, limited feeding sources, or host population densities do not affect only the development period of sand flies, but also their phenotype and behaviour (Belen et al. ; Oguz et al. ). Only one sand fly species was recorded in our study, compared to a higher diversity in most other countries (Table 4 ). This can be explained by a series of factors: (1) the climate is temperate continental with Baltic and eastern influences in north and North-Eastern Romania, with annual average temperatures around 9 °C, colder than the southern region of Romania with Mediterranean climatic influences (Ielenicz and Pătru ) where a higher sand fly species diversity was recorded (Dancesco ); (2) between 1958 and 1964, insecticides were widely used in the Malaria eradication programs (Dancesco ); (3) in the last decades, the sand fly species composition changed due to environmental, demographic, and climate changes that negatively impacted the sand fly habitats (Maroli et al. ). A positive correlation of the sand fly diversity and altitude, with a relative high number of sand fly species present around 900-m altitude, was described (Simsek et al. ). In our study, conducted at 198-m altitude, the diversity of the sand fly species was very low, with only one species present, but compared to other studies (Simsek et al. ), this happens at a higher latitude. In the present study, the activity of P. perfiliewi started in July and ended in August. In other countries, this sand fly species started its activity in April, May, or June, according to the locality and year of study (Table 4 ). In Italy, for example, the species was active at mean temperatures situated between 27.09 and 28.02 °C at 372 m above sea level (Tarallo et al. ). In Greece, the species was more abundant in the continental part of the country, more related to the humid and sub-humid climate, than in the islands, where a distinctly hot and dry Mediterranean climate is present (Ivovic et al. ). In Greece, the activity of P. perfiliewi ended also in August (Ivovic et al. ), but other studies recorded this species as late as October in Greece (Chaskopoulou et al. ) or November and December in Italy (Tarallo et al. ; Lisi et al. ). September and October were the last months of P. perfiliewi activity in Turkey (Volf et al. ; Kasap et al. ), and November in Palestinian Territories (Sawalha et al. ). No significant correlation was found between latitude/mean annual temperature of the sites and the end of the phlebotomine sand flies activity (Alten et al. ).
In our study, the peak season of P. perfiliewi was recorded in July–August, similar to one study in Italy (Tarallo et al. ). In other studies, June–August, August–September, or October was the last months of P. perfiliewi activity (Table 4 ). Also, the differences between the beginning, the peak, and the end of the season for the same vector species in different territories are correlated with the higher or lower altitude in that particular region (Alten et al. ). The other sand fly species collected along with P. perfiliewi in the same localities in different studies showed similarities, but also differences regarding the beginning, end, and peak of the season (Table 4 ). In Greece (Chaskopoulou et al. ) and Turkey (Volf et al. ; Kasap et al. ), five and nine sand fly species, respectively, started their activity in May. In Italy (Maroli and Bettini ; Tarallo et al. ; Lisi et al. ), other six sand fly species started their activity in April, May, or June, and in the Palestinian Territories (Sawalha et al. ), another 21 sand fly species had their beginning of the season in May (Table 4 ). There are differences between various sympatric sand fly species with regard to their peak season as well (Table 4 ). The end of the season for most of the other sand fly species collected along with P. perfiliewi in Greece (Chaskopoulou et al. ), Italy (Maroli and Bettini ; Tarallo et al. ; Lisi et al. ), Palestinian Territories (Sawalha et al. ), and Turkey (Volf et al. ; Kasap et al. ) was in October, November, or December (Table 4 ). So far, no significant statistical correlation was described between the end of sand fly activity and the latitude and the average annual temperatures from the collecting sites (Alten et al. ).
The present abundance study was designed to understand the seasonal dynamics of sand flies in Romania, a country with temperate climate, with sporadic cases of CanL and VL. Understanding the dynamics of a vector species and its interaction with pathogens can increase the awareness on the vector-borne diseases of public health concern. The possible changes in the environment of the sand flies could affect both the vectors and the risk of disease transmission, with a direct impact on human health (Parham et al. ; Oguz et al. ). Multi-seasonal abundance studies of sand flies performed in the same region can provide valuable data on the potential transmission of L. infantum. As the main vectors of leishmaniasis in Europe display density peaks more or less frequently correlated with southern or northern latitudes (Alten et al. ), understanding the seasonal dynamics patterns of P. perfiliewi in North-Eastern Romania can also predict the potential risk seasons for L. infantum transmission.
Conclusions
Our study is the first of its kind conducted in a non-Mediterranean European country with a temperate climate, situated at the northern border of sand fly distribution and with sporadic cases of VL and CanL. All the data suggest that the activity season of P. perfiliewi is shorter in Romania than in the Mediterranean countries, impacting negatively the risk of disease transmission. The peak density of P. perfiliewi was at the beginning of August, providing scientific data which can be further used during awareness campaigns for veterinarians and public health professionals. The re-emergence of canine and human leishmaniases in Romania and the presence of disease foci in the country raise the need for more studies on the distribution, diversity, and seasonality of the vectors but also for epidemiological studies of VL and CanL.
