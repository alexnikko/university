Introduction
Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC), defined as a persistent or recurrent skin, nail, and mucosal infection with Candida species, may arise as a consequence of secondary T cell deficiency or as an inborn error of immunity [ ]. Several genetic etiologies have been identified to convey a complex syndromic phenotype with abnormal fungal susceptibility, such as the autosomal dominant (AD) hyper IgE syndrome, autosomal recessive (AR) autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy, AR CARD9, IL-12Rβ1, IL-12p40, and RORγt deficiencies. Other gene defects, such as AR IL-17RA, AR IL-17RC, ACT1, and AD IL-17F deficiencies result in isolated superficial candidiasis in non-syndromic chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis disease (CMCD) due to disturbed IL-17 signaling [ , , ]. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 gain-of-function (STAT1 GOF) mutations have recently been established as the most common cause of inherited syndromic CMC, with well over 300 cases identified worldwide to date [ ]. The exact mechanism underlying CMC in STAT1 hyperfunction is not yet fully understood. Peripheral blood lymphocytes of STAT1 GOF patients exhibit skewed Th17 (CD4 + IL-17 + ) differentiation in more than 80% of investigated cases [ ], while some but not all patients display increased levels of circulating Th1 (CD4 + IFNγ + ) [ , , ]. Previous reports indicate that disturbed functional equilibrium of STAT1/STAT3 signaling results in impaired Th17 development via reduced transcription of Th-17-related genes (RORC, IL-17A, IL-22) and STAT3-dependent genes (IL-10, c-Fos, SOCS3, c-Myc) [ , ]. This is most likely due to altered STAT3 promoter binding precipitated by reduced histone acetylation status as a result of abnormally strong, antagonizing IFNα-, IFNγ-, and IL-27-induced STAT1 response [ , ]. The diminished Th17 response entails low levels of IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-22, the key mediators in skin and mucosal antifungal protection [ , , ].
Lately, STAT1 GOF mutations have been shown to convey a much broader clinical phenotype than previously appreciated, ranging from isolated CMC to complex combined immune deficiencies often associated with infectious, autoimmune, and neoplastic complications and aneurysms [ , , ] prompting the need for more complex management. Newly gained insights into functional impact of the hypermorphic STAT1 mutations expose promising therapeutic targets along the dysregulated STAT1/STAT3/IL-17 pathways [ ], such as Janus kinases (JAKs). JAKs are intracellular proteins, constitutively associated with cytokine receptors, which recruit STATs upon receptor stimulation and facilitate signal transduction, which may be inhibited with various JAK inhibitors [ ].
In this report, we describe a child with a novel STAT1 GOF mutation presenting as an isolated mucocutaneous candidiasis and the outcome of treatment with oral selective JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib.
Methods
Informed consents were obtained from the patient and his guardians in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and according to the procedures established by the Ethical Committee of our institution.
STAT1 Sequencing
Sanger sequencing of the patient’s STAT1 gene was originally performed in Debrecen, Hungary, as reported here [ ]. Later, targeted Sanger sequencing of STAT1 gene was repeated for the patient and performed for his parents on 3730xl DNA Analyzer instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL) in our facility. DNA was isolated from peripheral blood samples using QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Analysis of the trace files was performed with SnapGene® software (from GSL Biotech).
Immunophenotyping
Immunophenotyping of lymphocyte subpopulations was performed using CD27-Brilliant Violet (BV) 421, IgD-FITC, and IgM-PerCP-Cy5.5 (Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA); CD45RA-BV510, CD16-PE, CD4-PerCP-Cy5.5, TCRgd-PE-Cy7, CD3-APC, and CD45-APC-H7 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA); CD19-PE-Cy7 and HLA-DR-Pacific Blue (Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL, USA); and CD8-FITC and CD56-PE (Cytognos, Salamanca, Spain). The samples were acquired on LSR II cytometer (BD Biosciences), and the data analysis was performed using FlowJo (TreeStar, Ashland, OR, USA).
CD4+ Subset Analysis (IL-17+Th, IFNγ+Th, Tregs)
PBMCs were stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA, 50 ng/ml) and ionomycin (750 ng/ml) (both from Sigma Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany); 1 h later, brefeldin A (10 mg/ml) (Biolegend) was added for 3 h. Cells were harvested and stained with CD3-Alexa Fluor 700, CD8-PE-Dy594 (Exbio Praha, Vestec, Czech Republic), and CD4-PE-Cy7 (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA) before being fixed and permeabilized using eBioscience Fixation/Permeabilization solutions. The following Abs were added: IFNγ-FITC (BD Biosciences) and IL-17-Alexa Fluor 647 (Biolegend). Cells were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min, washed, and resuspended in FACS buffer. Data were collected using FACS Aria II, Diva software was used for signal acquisition (both from BD Biosciences), and data analysis was performed using FlowJo (Treestar).
For T regulatory cell (Tregs) analysis, protocol previously published elsewhere was used [ ]. In short, PBMCs were stained with CD3-Alexa Fluor 700, CD8-PE-Dy594 (Exbio), CD4-PE-Cy7 (eBioscience), CD25-PerCP-Cy5.5, and CD127-APC (BioLegend), then fixed and permeabilized using eBioscience solutions and stained for intracellular markers using FoxP3-Alexa Fluor 488 (eBioscience) and Helios-PE (BioLegend) antibodies. Data were collected using FACS Aria II (BD Biosciences).
Western Blotting
PBMCs were stimulated w/wo IFNγ (1 μg/ml, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for 30 min at 37 °C; the cells were lysed using lysis buffer containing 50 mM HEPES, 10 mM MgCl2, 140 mM NaCl, pH 8, supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20, 1% n-dodecyl beta-D-maltoside, 2 mM PMSF, proteinase inhibitors, and phosphatase inhibitors (all from Sigma Aldrich). The lysates were sonicated 4× for 10 s, incubated for 60 min on ice, and centrifuged at 21.255 g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were diluted 1:1 with Laemmli reducing sample buffer (Sigma Aldrich) and heated to 90 °C for 5 min. Proteins were separated in SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The membranes were blocked in 7.5% low-fat bovine milk in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 at 8 °C overnight. To detect STAT1 proteins, primary antibodies against phospho-STAT1 (Tyr701) and STAT1 (Cell Signaling Technologies, Danvers, MA) were used together with the peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) and the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Fischer). For in vitro ruxolitinib inhibition test, PBMCs were cultured with ruxolitinib (Seleckchem, Houston, TX) for 30 min at 37 °C prior to IFNγ stimulation.
Phospho-Flow
Whole peripheral blood was stimulated w/wo IFNα (1 μg/ml, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) or IFNγ (0,5-1 μg/ml, R&D Systems) for 5, 10, 15, or 30 min at 37 °C; intracellular signaling was stopped using 4% formaldehyde for 10 min at 25 °C; erythrocytes were lysed using 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min at 37 °C; and the leukocytes were permeabilized using 80% ice-cold methanol. B cells and T cells were discriminated using anti-CD45-Pacific Blue, anti-CD3-PerCP-Cy5.5 (Exbio Praha), and anti-CD19-PE-Cy7 (Beckman Coulter), and intracellular signaling was detected using anti-phospho-STAT1(Tyr701)-Alexa Fluor 647, anti-phospho-STAT3(Tyr705)-Alexa Fluor 488, and anti-phospho-STAT5(Tyr694)-PE (all from BD Biosciences). The samples were acquired on LSR II cytometer (BD Biosciences), and the data analysis was performed using FlowJo (TreeStar). For in vitro ruxolitinib inhibition test, whole blood was cultured with ruxolitinib (Seleckchem) for 30 min at 37 °C prior IFNα or IFNγ stimulation.
Gene Expression by qRT-PCR
PBMCs were isolated by density gradient centrifugation, pre-cultivated in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics in the presence of phytohaemagglutinin (2μg/ml) and IL-2 (20 U/ML) for 72 h, and then stimulated for 4 h with IFNγ (1 μg/ml) for CXCL10 expression, IL-27 (100 ng/ml) (both Peprotech, New Jersey, USA) for SOCS3, and cFOS expression or left without cytokines for IL-17A and RORC expression. Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy Mini Kit following manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen), and complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthetized using M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher). RT-PCR was performed in duplicates using the cDNA and Platinum Taq polymerase (Thermo Fisher), 200 nM dNTP (Promega, Southampton, UK), 50 mM MgCl2 (Thermo Fisher), and TaqMan primer/probe sets (Thermo Fisher). Samples were matched to a standard curve generated by amplifying serially diluted products using the same PCR reaction and normalized to GAPDH (TIB MOLBIOL, Berlin, Germany) to obtain the relative expression value. Real-time assays were run on iQ5 Cycler (Bio-Rad). Primer sequences are available upon request at the author.
Intracellular Cytokine Detection
Intracellular detection of IL-1β was performed in heparinized whole blood stimulated with 100 ng/ml LPS (lipopolysaccharide, Sigma Aldrich) 4 h in a presence of brefeldin A. For analysis of IL-6 and TNF-α production, heparinized whole blood was stimulated with 100 ng/ml LPS, brefeldin A was added after 2 h, and samples were left for another 4 h in 37 °C. Cells were labeled with anti CD14 − PE-Cy7 (Exbio). Following the lysis of RBC using BD lysing solution (BD Biosciences) and fixation/permeabilization using eBioscience protocol, cells were stained with antibodies against respected cytokines: IL-1β-PE (Thermo Fisher), IL-6-APC, or TNF-α-BV421 (BioLegend) for 30 min. Samples were washed and acquired on Canto II instrument (BD Biosciences). Results were expressed as mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of a given cytokine within CD14 + population.
Results
Case Report
A healthy Czech newborn developed treatment-resistant oral thrush at the age of 2 months. By the end of the first year, he suffered seven middle ear infections, mostly bacterial, and one uncomplicated pneumonia, which resolved with standard course of antibiotics. Later, increased susceptibility to cutaneous staphylococcal infections was noted and prominent onychomycosis appeared. No gross immunodeficiency was initially discovered, but in time, the patient developed progressive CD4 + and CD8 + T cell lymphopenia with Th17 and T regulatory cell (Treg, CD4 + CD25 + FOXP3 + ) deficiency, CD19 + switched memory B cell lymphopenia, and low IgG2, IgG4, and IgM levels. Extensive screening excluded autoimmune and vascular complications (Table 1 ). Treatment with prophylactic azoles (fluconazole alternated with itraconazole), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and subcutaneous immunoglobulins was initiated; however, the increasing antifungal resistance eventually rendered azoles altogether ineffective and allowed massive spread of the yeast infection. At this point, a novel sporadic mutation in STAT1 gene was discovered (Fig. 1 ), and its gain-of-function property was verified (Figs. 2 and 3 ). Next, the IFN-induced augmented STAT1 phosphorylation in patient’s circulating T and B cells was shown to be reversible in vitro with JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib as demonstrated in previous reports (Figs. 2 and 3 ) [ , ]. Based on this, treatment with ruxolitinib was initiated when the patient was 12 years of age. The dose was increased gradually over 4 weeks to a target dose 10 mg twice daily (20 mg/m 2 /day), in adherence to previously reported well-tolerated dose in children with solid tumors/hematologic malignancies [ ], and decreased by 50% for ruxolitinib’s pharmacologic interaction with concomitantly administered itraconazole on cytochrome CYP3A4. At the end of week 4, first improvement of the cutaneous (and partially oral) candidiasis was noted, which culminated at week 8 (Fig. 5 ) when the treatment had to be interrupted for non-medical reasons. Within 2 weeks from the abrupt withdrawal, the previously achieved amelioration of CMC was almost completely lost (Fig. 5 ). Four weeks after ruxolitinib discontinuation, the treatment was resumed at the same dose with gradual, but this time much less, pronounced improvement (Fig. 5 ). During the treatment, skin and mucosal swabs continued to yield candida strains. No adverse reactions were noted throughout the treatment; the patient’s full blood count, liver, renal functions, blood cholesterol, and triacylglycerol levels remained unaltered; and the patient suffered only one episode of mild upper respiratory tract infection.

Patient’s PBMCs were analyzed for STAT1 expression and STAT1 phosphorylation response to IFNγ and ruxolitinib and compared to healthy mother and additional healthy control (quantification indicated by numbers in figure). In the patient, mildly increased constitutive STAT1 is shown, markedly high activation of p-STAT1 after IFNγ, and abnormal presence of p-STAT1β isoform, along with p-STAT1 reversal to pre-stimulation levels after ruxolitinib are demonstrated Fig. 3 Flow cytometric trace of p-STAT1 (Tyr701) ascertains GOF property of STAT1 c.617T > C and confirms its reversibility with ruxolitinib. Time-dependent IFNγ-induced hyperphosphorylation of p-STAT1 (Tyr701) is shown in patient’s CD3 + T cells ( a ) and in CD19 + B cells ( b ) compared to healthy controls.

Detection of STAT1 Mutation
Sanger sequencing revealed novel heterozygous mutation in STAT1 gene leading to amino acid substitution of proline for leucine (c.617T > C; p.L206P). This mutation occurred de novo in the patient; neither of his parents are affected (Fig. 1 ). The mutation is located in the coiled-coil domain of STAT1 protein, which is essential for STAT1 dimerization and STAT1 nuclear dephosphorylation [ ].
STAT Phosphorylation Dynamics
To evaluate functional impact of the mutation in STAT1 gene, we first examined STAT1 protein expression and IFNγ-induced STAT1 phosphorylation (p-) at Tyr 701 in patient’s PBMCs using Western blot. We found mildly increased constitutive STAT1 expression and threefold higher phosphorylation of STAT1 in response to IFNγ compared to patient’s unaffected mother and unrelated healthy control. Interestingly, IFNγ activated not only STAT1α isoform, but also STAT1β isoform in patient in contrast to healthy controls (Fig. 2 ). The results were confirmed at a single-cell level; following IFNγ stimulation, higher phosphorylation of STAT1 was detected in patient’s CD3 + T cells (Fig. 3 a) and CD19 + B cells (Fig. 3 b) compared to healthy controls. Moreover, pre-treatment of the patient’s cells with ruxolitinib suppressed IFNγ-induced p-STAT1 signal to levels seen in IFNγ-stimulated control cells (Fig. 3 a, b). Additionally, IFNα was also shown to induce abnormally high p-STAT1 activation compared to controls in both cell types (Fig. 3 a, b). Flow cytometry-based test for evaluation of p-STAT1 (Tyr701), p-STAT3 (Tyr705), and p-STAT5 (Tyr694) in whole blood on a single-tube platform was optimized for ex vivo monitoring of response to IFNα and IFNγ. After just 7 days on initial dose of ruxolitinib (10 mg/m 2 /day), p-STAT1 response to IFNα was reduced to 32 and 57% of pre-treatment values in patient’s CD3 + and CD19 + cells, respectively. Similarly, IFNγ-induced p-STAT1 activation was reduced to 17 and 14% of pre-treatment values in patient’s CD3 + and CD19 + cells, respectively. Compared to healthy control, patient’s p-STAT1 signal upon IFNα stimulation decreased from 274 to 87% in CD3 + cells and from 208 to 137% in CD19 + cells (Fig. 4 ) while IFNγ-stimulated p-STAT1 signal was reduced from 105 to 25% of control values in CD3 + cells and from 404 to 53% of control values in CD19 + cells (Fig. 5 ). Pre-treatment p-STAT3 and p-STAT5 responses were similar to healthy controls, and their parallel milder decrease was observed after ruxolitinib introduction (Fig. 4 ). During the following 7 weeks of ruxolitinib treatment, a dose-dependent suppression of all monitored p-STAT molecules was observed (Figs 4 and 5 ). Sudden withdrawal of ruxolitinib reverted p-STAT1 response to its augmented state, reflected by clinical deterioration. Concurrently, restoration of p-STAT3 and p-STAT5 signals was registered. Similar patterns of p-STAT suppression were later observed after ruxolitinib treatment was restarted (Figs 4 and 5 ). The remarkable correlation between the ruxolitinib dose, the IFNγ-induced p-STAT1 activity, and the clinical condition of the patient is shown in Fig. 5 . The basal levels of p-STATs are available as a supplementary figure . Fig. 4 Phospho-Flow analysis of IFNα-induced p-STAT1 (Tyr701), p-STAT3 (Tyr705), and p-STAT5 (Tyr694) activation in CD3 + cells ( a ) and in CD19 + cells ( b ) of STAT1 c.617T > C patient and the response to ruxolitinib. Ruxolitinib suppresses IFNα-induced augmented p-STAT1 (Tyr701) in a dose-dependent manner, which was particularly marked in CD19+ B cells (bottom right). Pre-treatment p-STAT3 (Tyr705) and p-STAT5 (Tyr694) levels corresponded to healthy controls and were mildly suppressed with ruxolitinib during treatment. Daily dose of ruxolitinib is indicated on the x -axis; the y -axis represents a quantitative relation between the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the patient’s IFNα-induced p-STATs and that of a healthy control Fig. 5 Clinical progress paralleled to IFNγ-induced p-STAT1 (Tyr701) activation during ruxolitinib treatment of STAT1 c.617T > C patient. Sustained suppression of p-STAT1 (Tyr701) in CD3 + T cells and CD19 + B cells along with marked improvement of CMC ( a , b ) is detected during ruxolitinib administration. Increase of p-STAT1 signal and clinical decay is noted shortly after discontinuation ( c ) and reversed again after ruxolitinib is restarted ( d ). Daily dose of ruxolitinib is indicated on the x -axis; the y -axis represents the quantitative relation between the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the patient’s IFNγ-induced p-STAT1 (Tyr701) and that of a healthy control
STAT1/STAT3-Dependent/Th17-Related Gene Transcription Alteration
In order to evaluate changes in transcription of relevant genes during treatment with JAK1/2 inhibitor, qRT-PCR was performed on patient’s PHA and IL-2-stimulated PBMCs before treatment and after 16 weeks on ruxolitinib (Fig. 6 ). Before treatment, abnormally heightened IFNγ-induced transcription of STAT1-dependent gene CXCL10 was noted compared to healthy control, which was markedly reduced with ruxolitinib treatment. Conversely, expression of IL-27-induced STAT3-dependent genes cFOS and SOCS3, as well as Th17-related genes IL-17A and RORC, was prominently suppressed in the setting of extremely high STAT1 activity before treatment and increased upon reduction of STAT1 signaling with the JAK inhibitor. Fig. 6 qRT-PCR of Th17-related STAT1 and STAT3-induced genes in STAT1 c.617T > C patient before and during ruxolitinib treatment. Ruxolitinib-näive phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) and IL-2-stimulated IFNγ-induced CXCL10 expression in PBMCs surmounts values seen in healthy control and significantly decreases after 16 weeks on ruxolitinib; ruxolitinib-näive PHA and IL-2-stimulated expression of IL-17A and RORC, as well as identically pre-treated IL-27-induced cFOS and SOCS3 expression are suppressed and increase markedly on treatment. Individual gene expressions are related to housekeeping gene GAPDH. Data are expressed as mean significant deviation of the indicated gene/GAPDH
Lymphocyte Subpopulation Profile
Consistent with previous observations in STAT1 GOF patients, diminished peripheral Th17 population (CD4 + IL17 + ) was detected in our patient, while IFNγ producing Th1 cells (CD4 + IFNγ + ) were not increased compared to age-matched healthy donors (Table 1 , Fig. 7 ). Despite apparent clinical improvement, the CD4 + IL17 + peripheral counts remained low throughout the treatment with ruxolitinib, while IFNγ + Th1 population dropped below the reference values (Table 1 , Fig. 7 ). Additionally, decreased numbers of Tregs were noted and remained low on treatment. Mild, yet progressive T cell lymphopenia and decreased switched memory B cell compartment, as well as low IgG2, IgG4, and IgM, were detected prior to ruxolitinib treatment (Table 1 ), corresponding to similar irregularities in other STAT1 GOF patients [ ]. Although the absolute CD3 + counts improved during the treatment on the account of both CD4 + and CD8 + lymphocytes, they remained below the age-matched reference values. The relative count of CD4 + effector memory cells and CD4 + central memory cells declined on treatment by 1.2 and 13%, respectively (Table 1 ). Lastly, the low relative proportion of switched memory B cells within the CD19 + compartment decreased even further on treatment. Fig. 7 Flow cytometric analyses of IL-17 and IFNγ producing peripheral CD4 + lymphocytes a from a healthy age-matched subject and b from patient before ruxolitinib; low CD4 + IL17 + count and normal CD4 + IFNγ + are shown c from patient after 16 weeks on ruxolitinib; no increase of CD4 + IL17 + count is registered
Cytokine Production
To assess mononuclear phagocyte ability to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines in our patient before treatment, we measured LPS-induced TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β production in CD14 + monocytes, yielding mildly decreased TNF-α response; otherwise, similar results compared to healthy controls (Table 1 ). The test was repeated after 8 weeks on ruxolitinib with a similar result.
Discussion
We report a child with treatment-resistant chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis due to a novel STAT1 GOF mutation, who improved significantly during treatment with JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib. To our knowledge, this is only a fourth child with STAT1 GOF CMC reported to receive this treatment [ , , ].
STAT1 GOF CMC patients are currently managed with long-term administration of systemic antifungal drugs; some patients benefit from prophylactic antibiotics, antivirotics, and replacement/immunomodulatory immunoglobulins. The diverse phenotype often renders such treatment insufficient, particularly when autoimmune phenomena are present. Moreover, development of antifungal resistance frequently necessitates use of second-line drugs with higher toxicity and heralds poorer outcome [ ]. An initially promising effect of granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor on CMC [ ] was regrettably not replicable in four other patients [ , , ]. In 2017, the first multi-center experience with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in 15 STAT1 GOF patients was reported [ ]. Despite having curative potential, only 40% overall post-transplant survival was achieved.
Recently, systemic administration of JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib, approved by European Commission for treatment of myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera [ ], has been shown to rapidly improve STAT1 GOF-driven oral candidiasis and alopecia in adult female [ ], indicating its capacity to ameliorate associated autoimmune symptoms. Similar to our experience, the candidiasis flared up 2 weeks after ruxolitinib withdrawal, while, remarkably, the hair regrowth was sustained for 6 months. Of note, the relapse in our patient after the drug withdrawal was mirrored by p-STAT1 rebound to levels almost twofold higher than pre-treatment values related to healthy control in IFNα-induced cells, perhaps resonating with the abrupt clinical deterioration during ruxolitinib withdrawal syndrome reported in patients with myelofibrosis [ ]. In another adult male patient, ruxolitinib induced remission of severe oro-esophageal candidiasis after 6 months of treatment [ ], albeit with slower and only partial effect, while increased IL-17A/F secretion and dose-dependent decrease of serum IL-6 were observed. Another intriguing utility of ruxolitinib was reported in a patient who received the compound 2 weeks prior to HCST for STAT1 GOF CMC [ ] and was one of the six survivors of the procedure, out of 15 recipients. The fourth patient treated with ruxolitinib cleared his CMC as well as severe autoimmune cytopenias after more than 1 year of uninterrupted therapy [ ]. Curiously, the patient’s originally increased peripheral IFNγ + Th1 cells decreased within first 4 months, while increase in Th17 wasn’t registered until the 12th month of therapy, despite months of prominent clinical improvement. Another group reported a 7-year-old male with STAT1 GOF mutation who improved his IPEX-like enteropathy and chronic norovirus enteritis after 3 months of ruxolitinib therapy [ ]. In contrast to these reports, two adult patients with severe dermatophytosis and disseminated coccidioidomycosis due to STAT1 GOF mutation were recently reported to fail to respond to ruxolitinib [ ]. Despite having achieved near-normal STAT1 phosphorylation by dose titration in one of the patients, the downstream STAT1-induced gene expression remained high and Th17 population more or less unchanged. The other patient failed to improve his Th17 levels after 2 weeks despite the use of currently approved adult therapeutic dose of ruxolitinib (40 mg/daily).
In our case, we demonstrated ruxolitinib-induced suppression of STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5 phosphorylation ex vivo . Despite having achieved a profound suppression of p-STAT1 within days from treatment initiation, the clinical improvement was first seen when p-STAT1 had been reduced to subnormal level for 4 weeks. As such, the clinical effect may not only be due to dose increments but also to longer time-to-improvement interval required. For unknown reason, the rate and extend of candidiasis clearance was less prominent when ruxolitinib was reintroduced after an unintended interruption of treatment, in spite of using the same target dose (20 mg/daily) and achieving similar levels of p-STAT1. Parallel to p-STAT1 suppression, rescued STAT3-dependent gene expression was demonstrated; however, the anticipated CD4 + IL17 + restoration was not observed after 4 months, suggesting longer duration of ruxolitinib treatment may be required to achieve this. The reason for this delay is obscured. Differentiation of Th17 cells requires precisely orchestrated actions of multiple cytokines, signal transducers, and transcription factors (known or unknown) [ , , ], which may be affected by JAK inhibition. Crucial pro-Th17 cytokines, IL-6, and IL-23, require JAK2-mediated STAT3 recruitment [ ]. It is therefore conceivable that ruxolitinib itself might restrain Th17 development via concomitant STAT3 suppression. However, we showed that during suppression of the augmented STAT1 activity, an increase of STAT3-inducible/Th17-related gene transcription was achieved, despite the parallel p-STAT3 suppression, corresponding with a previous observation that the disturbed Th17 development in STAT1 GOF patients results from altered signaling downstream of STAT3 [ ]. Curiously, another set of experiments demonstrated that in addition to the canonical STAT3-driven Th17 induction, STAT3 inhibition may also, under certain conditions, cause amplification of IL-17 + T cells within memory T cell population, depending on the kinetics of STAT3 activation [ ], foreshadowing the intricate and still largely unknown regulations at play. Furthermore, naïve CD4 + T cells of a set of STAT1 GOF patients were shown to overexpress PD-L1 protein [ ]. STAT1-invoked PD-L1 overexpression was demonstrated to skew Th17 differentiation via PD-1/PD-L1 interaction [ ], exposing another potential mechanism for disrupted Th17 lineage commitment which might be reversible with ruxolitinib with unknown dynamics.
On a side note, the finding of non-rescued CD4 + IL17 + does not allow an unequivocal interpretation of Th17 dynamics because the Th17 lymphocytes should be more accurately assessed as proportion of CD4 + memory cells, the principal IL-17 producing T cells. Adherence to commonly used enumeration of Th17 population as percentage of total CD4 + cells in our experiments allows comparison across the previously published studies but limits the interpretability of the intra-individual data due to physiologic fluctuation of memory cell compartments. Nevertheless, as the CD4 + memory cell frequencies decreased slightly in our patient at the time of CD4 + IL17 + measurements, no major increase of the IL17 + memory cells may be anticipated.
While the Th17 functional integrity is indisputably important in mucosal antifungal immunity, other aspects may be affected with ruxolitinib in STAT1 GOF patients and contribute to the clinical improvement even in the absence of peripheral blood Th17 restoration. For example, defective NK cell cytotoxicity due to aberrant STAT5 signaling was recently demonstrated in STAT1 GOF patients and shown to be partially reversible ex vivo with ruxolitinib [ ]. The impairment of STAT5 activity may be at least in part due to augmented STAT1-induced SOCS1-mediated suppression of STAT5 [ ] which would be ameliorated during ruxolitinib-induced p-STAT1 suppression. The restoration of NK cytotoxicity may attribute for the improvement of both antiviral and antifungal susceptibility in these patients [ ]. It is also important to emphasize that our experiments were performed on peripheral blood lymphocytes, yet the antifungal response in mucosal and skin microenvironment may be modulated by other mechanisms, such as tissue-resident cytotoxic CD8 + lymphocytes [ ], IL-17-secreting γδ T cells [ , ], or even keratinocytes, in which the IFN-STAT1-SOCS1 negative feedback loop is implicated in antiviral protection [ ].
In our patient, no autoimmune complications were present, but low levels of circulating Tregs were noted . Such reduction may be, at least in part, due to IL-6 inhibitory effect on the induction of Tregs [ , ], as serum levels of IL-6 were shown to be highly elevated in some STAT1 GOF patients [ ]. Nevertheless, autoimmune features of STAT1 GOF patients most likely do not result from Tregs deficiency as indicated by unaltered Treg compartment in patients with IPEX-like manifestation of STAT1 GOF [ ] but rather from stronger response to IFNα/β signaling in interferonopathy-like manner [ ] and/or naïve CD4 + T cell priming towards differentiation into Th1 lineage under both Th1 and Th17 polarizing conditions [ ]. How ruxolitinib should tackle autoimmunity in STAT1 GOF CMC is not precisely understood. Evidently, a part of rescuing Th17 development, thus facilitating an effective protection against candida, ruxolitinib also suppresses exaggerated Th1 and follicular T helper cell responses and reverses the IFNγ + Th1-biased priming of naïve T cells [ ]. In our patient, ruxolitinib induced sustained suppression of p-STAT5, one of the non-redundant players in Tregs development [ ]. Although Treg counts did not decrease significantly on treatment, such suppression of the kinase activity further supports the notion of Treg-independent mechanism of development of autoimmune features in STAT1 GOF patients.
Experience with prolonged use of ruxolitinib in children with CMC is scarce, and close monitoring of adverse reactions is essential. These are mainly related to off-target effects of JAK1 and JAK2 inhibition and include increased susceptibility to infections, dose-dependent anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia (due to inhibited erythropoietin, thrombopoietin, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor signaling via JAK2), and dyslipidemia [ , , ]. Additionally, supported by our observation of parallel p-STAT5 inhibition, the risk of growth failure due to disturbed growth hormone-JAK2-STAT5 signaling [ ] is a major concern in pediatric population. In our patient, no such events were noted after 4 months of treatment; serum levels of insulin-like growth factor and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 were undisturbed. Our original concern that ruxolitinib might compromise TNF-α production and thus increase infectious susceptibility [ ] proved to be unsubstantiated in our patient.
Conclusion
In summary, this paper expands evidence of ruxolitinib’s efficacy in control of the profound immune disbalance caused by STAT1 GOF mutation. From our experience, we conclude that the effect of ruxolitinib on mucocutaneous candidiasis is short-lived after discontinuation and long-term administration is required to maintain disease control; therefore, careful dose titration is necessary to avoid adverse effects. However, efficacy and safety of prolonged treatment of STAT1 GOF patients with ruxolitinib is yet to be ascertained. Alternatively, ruxolitinib may be a useful tool to bridge time to HSCT and possibly improve its outcome. Further experience is needed to draw conclusions about its role in CMC management and optimal pediatric dose.
