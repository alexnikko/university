Introduction
Doxorubicin (DXR) is an anthracycline glycoside antibiotic. It is chiefly used in the treatment of various solid tumours and haematological malignancy [ ]. However, its toxicity to vital organs such as the heart, liver and kidney limits its use in cancer treatment [ ]. DXR consists of quinone moiety. When this is reduced to semiquinone, the superoxide (O 2− ) radical is generated. O 2− damages the cell components steadily with increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) concentration [ ]. Depletion of antioxidant enzymes causes damage to vital organs. The toxicity of DXR to the heart, liver and kidney, as well as its testicular and haematological toxicities, is well documented [ , , , , , ]. Oxidative stress coupled with DXR-induced organ toxicity changes the normal architecture of vital tissues. Moreover, DXR toxicity is aggravated by depletion of the Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2) transcriptional factor [ ].
AA has been patented as a food supplement that prevents skin ageing, enhances wound-healing properties and has anticancer properties [ , ]. AA is the major constituent of Centella asiatica , a plant that is widely used as food and cultivated in India, China, Sri Lanka and Africa as a vegetable or spice [ ]. AA is a pentacyclic triterpenoid that has been evaluated for anticancer [ ], antidiabetic [ ], anti-inflammatory [ ], organotropic [ , , ] and antioxidant [ ] effects in suitable animal models. The antioxidant enzyme-stimulatory activity of AA principally reduces DXR-induced organ toxicity. Moreover, AA can translocate the Nrf2 gene, which directly expresses the phase II antioxidant enzymes. This finding is supported by an in-silico study conducted using the Discovery studio 3.0 software package. At the basal condition, Nrf2 binds with Keap1(Kelch-like erythroid cell-derived [ECH]-associated protein 1), which is a protein that inhibits it. Nrf2 is the key translocation factor that controls the expression of the phase II antioxidant enzymes. Further, immunohistochemistry studies conducted on the heart, liver and kidney tissues confirm that AA has the ability to increase Nrf2 protein levels. AA has anticancer, chemopreventive, DNA repair, procarcinogen inhibition, antioxidant, inflammatory modulation and apoptosis-like action, which supports and/or has a synergistic effect with chemotherapy (Fig. 1 ). The protection offered to organs and the cytotoxicity against the Hep3B, Hela and MCF-7 cell lines by AA in the present study suggests that AA can be explored as an organ-protective adjuvant with DXR.

Several pentacyclic triterpenoids were evaluated for their adjuvant effect against DXR [ , , ]. There are different mechanisms responsible for the synergistic effect of pentacyclic triterpenoids with minimal toxicity when they are administered as adjuvants to chemotherapy [ ]. Considering this success of pentacyclic triterpenoids, the present study was designed to evaluate the organ-protective activity of AA in DXR-induced organ toxicity.
Materials and Methods
In-silico Study
We used the protein structure of Keap1 with PDB ID 2FLU to generate the grid of Keap1 [ ]. The protein sequence of Keap1 from Homo sapiens was explained by Wakabayashi et al. [ ]. We made the template of Keap1 with a grid around the 16-mer peptide of the Neh2 domain of Nrf2 that binds with Keap1. The template was generated using the Schrodinger Maestro software package. The structures were elucidated using drawing and conversion tools such as Chembio Draw. AA was used as a ligand to dock with the active site of Keap1. The GlideScore, Emodel and Glide Energy were recorded. The ligands were docked on Keap1 using Maestro of the Schrödinger software package in the XP mode. Maestro was used for the actual docking on the active Keap1 site.
Animals
Laboratory-bred Wistar rats of either sex weighing between 150 and 200 g, maintained under standard laboratory conditions of 25 ± 1 °C and a photo-period of 12 h dark/12 h light were used in the experiment. Commercial pellets (Amrut Laboratory Rat and Mouse Feed, Sangli, India) and water were provided ad libitum. The experiments were carried out according to the guidelines of the Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision of Experiments on Animals (CPCSEA), New Delhi, India, after approval by the Institutional Animal Ethical Committee.
Chemicals
Asiatic acid (purity > 95%) was purchased from 3 W Botanicals Extract Inc., China. Doxorubicin (Duxocin, Biochemic Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., Mumbai) was procured locally. All the chemicals required for the sensitive biochemical assays were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co., India and HiMedia Chemicals Co., India. Distilled water was used in the biochemical assays. LDH and CK-MB kits were obtained from Aspan Laboratories Pvt. Ltd, Delhi (India). BUN and creatinine kits were obtained from Span Dignostics Ltd., Gujarat, India, and SGPT and SGOT kits from Proton Biologicals India Pvt. Ltd., Bangalore, India.
Experimental Protocol
The rats were divided into the following experimental groups, with each group consisting of six animals. Group I control (treated with saline solution—1 ml/day for 7 days) Group II standard drug (treated with vitamin E—200 mg/kg, p.o. for 7 days) Group III DXR (treated with DXR—65.75 mg/kg, iv , 48 h prior to the end of study) Group IV AA (pretreated with AA—5 mg/kg, p.o. for 7 days) Group V AA (pretreated with AA—10 mg/kg, p.o. for 7 days) Group VI AA (pretreated with AA—20 mg/kg, p.o. for 7 days)
All the groups except the control group received DXR (65.75 mg/kg, iv ) 48 h prior to the end of study. At the end of the treatment, the ECG was recorded under light ether anaesthesia. Blood was withdrawn by retro-orbital plexus bleeding, and the animal was euthanised by an ether overdose. The heart, liver and kidney tissues were immediately excised for biochemical assays and microscopic examination.
Electrocardiography
ECGs were recorded before and after the DXR treatment using a Chart 5.0 (ADI Instruments). The rats were administered light ether anaesthesia. Needle electrodes were inserted beneath the skin. For each ECG tracing, the heart rate, QT interval and ST intervals were measured [ ].
Preparation of Serum and Tissue Homogenate
Blood was collected after the clot serum was separated using an R-24 research centrifuge (Remi Instruments Ltd., Mumbai) at 5000 rpm for 4 min. This blood was used to estimate the CK-MB, LDH, creatinine, BUN, SGPT and SGOT levels. The heart, liver and kidney tissues were washed with ice-cold 0.9% saline and homogenised rapidly with ice-cold 1.15% KCl buffer (pH 7.5) using a Remi homogeniser, which yielded a 10% homogenate [ ]. The homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 20 min, and the supernatants were used to estimate the SOD, GSH and LPO levels.
Antioxidant Parameters
Superoxide Dismutase (SOD)
The heart, liver and kidney tissue homogenate was used to estimate the SOD concentration as described by Kono [ ].
Lipid Peroxidation (LPO)
Lipid peroxide levels were measured as the malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration, an index of lipid peroxidation, according to the method of Ohkawa et al. [ ]. The absorbance of the organic layer was taken at 535 nm using the end point method. The results were expressed as the percentage of the control [ ].
Reduced Glutathione (GSH)
The reduced glutathione level in the heart, liver and kidney homogenate was estimated according to the method described by Ellman [ ]. The yellow colour developed was read immediately at 412 nm using the method as modified for microplate readers (Powerwave XS, Biotech).
Biomarker Enzyme Estimation
Blood samples were collected from each animal. The serum obtained by centrifugation was used to estimate the biomarker levels in the heart, liver and kidney tissues.
Heart Marker Enzymes
The serum obtained by centrifugation of blood was used to estimate the LDH and CK-MB levels according to the procedure prescribed by the manufacturer.
Kidney Marker Enzymes
The serum was used to estimate the creatinine level using the alkaline picrate method. The BUN level was determined using a modified Berthelot method according to the procedure described by the manufacturer.
Liver Marker Enzymes
The serum was used to determine the SGPT and SGOT levels using the alkaline picrate method according to the procedure described by the manufacturer.
Histopathological Examination
The hearts, kidneys and livers were excised and immediately fixed in 10% buffered formalin. The tissue specimens were embedded in paraffin after being dehydrated in alcohol and cleaned using xylene. Five-micrometre thick histological sections were obtained from the paraffin blocks and stained with haematoxylin and eosin. The sections were examined under a light microscope, and photomicrographs were taken.
Immunohistochemistry Analysis
Immunofluorescence analysis was performed in the groups with the greatest organ protection (AA 20 mg/kg, control animals with and without primary antibodies and the DXR-treated group). The heart, liver and kidney tissues embedded in paraffin were sectioned at a thickness of 5 µm. The tissue sections were deparaffinised by heating at 60 °C, followed by three washing cycles of 3 min each with xylene. The deparaffinised sections were gradually hydrated with graded alcohol, after which they were incubated in pre-warmed citrate buffer (pH 6.0, 95 °C) for antigen retrieval. They were allowed to cool for 20 min at room temperature. The sections were rinsed with Tris-buffered solution (TBS) in three cycles of 5 min each. The binding of non-specific antibodies was blocked using blocking serum (ABC kit, Santacruz) at room temperature over 1 h. The sections were then incubated overnight with monoclonal Nrf2 antibody at 4 °C. The sections were incubated in 3% H 2 O 2 in TBS for 15 min to inhibit endogenous peroxidase activity. The sections were washed with TBS and then incubated first in FITC-conjugated polyclonal secondary antibody and then in a biotin–avidin–peroxidase substrate for 30 min each at room temperature [ ]. Quantification of the fluorescence protein expression was carried out using the pixel density as measured using Image J [ ].
Cell Viability Assay (MTT Staining)
Hep3B, Hela and MCF-7 human cancer cell lines were grown at 37 °C in a humidified incubator under 5% CO 2 /95% air in MEM media supplemented with 5% foetal calf serum, 200 IU/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin. The cytotoxicity was determined using a 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The Hep3B, Hela and MCF-7 cells were seeded at 2 × 10 4 cells/well in 5% CO 2 at 37 °C in MEM medium in 96-well plates. After incubation overnight to allow for cell attachment, the medium in each well was replaced by media containing various concentrations of AA and incubated for 48 h. Next, 20 µl of MTT (5 mg/ml in PBS) was added to each well and the microplate was wrapped in aluminium foil. The cells were incubated for another 4 h at 37 °C. The medium was then aspirated carefully, and 100 µl of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to each well. The plates were shaken for an additional 10 min, and the absorbance values were read using the microplate reader (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) at 570 nm [ ]. Each concentration was tested in triplicate. The cell viability was calculated as a percentage using the expression (mean OD of treated cells/mean OD of control cells) × 100. The results were expressed as the percentage of the control cells that were not treated.
Statistical Analysis
All the data were expressed as the mean ± SEM. Group means were compared by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnett’s test. P < 0.05 was considered significant.
Results
In-silico Study
The surface interaction of AA with amino acids on Keap1 is shown in Fig. 2 . AA binds with the amino acids ARG 380, ARG 415, ARG 183, SER 508 on GLY 509 on Keap1. With this interaction, AA was able to translocate the Nrf2. This produced the phase II antioxidant for cytoprotection. The docking score of AA was found to be −9.0681, its docking Emodel was −37.7338, and its docking energy was −31.8968. The more negative value of the docking score can be considered a good docking score. The good docking score and strong hydrogen bonding of AA with the above-mentioned amino acid tell us that the translocation ability of Nrf2 is good. This was confirmed by increases in Nrf2 protein expression and antioxidant enzyme levels in AA-treated animals.

Heart, Liver and Kidney Injury Marker Enzyme
The animals treated with DXR showed that it has toxic effects on heart, liver and kidney tissues through significantly increased serum levels of CK-MB, LDH, BUN, creatinine, SGPT and SGOT compared with the normal control group animals. The DXR-treated animals show increased levels of CK-MB (373.6 ± 25.86:117.1 ± 13.05) and LDH (649.4 ± 25.33:107 ± 7.8) compared with the control animals. These levels are best restored significantly ( p < 0.05) by AA (20 mg/kg), to 189.6 ± 34.98 and 256.5 ± 73.24, respectively. The SGPT and SGOT values in DXR-treated animals were found to be 95.23 ± 11.53:12.16 ± 1.29 and 75.36 ± 10.44:10.90 ± 1.17, comparable with those of control animals, and 17.19 ± 2.26 and 15.89 ± 2 in AA (20 mg/kg) which significantly ( p < 0.05) protect the liver tissues from injury marker enzyme. Similarly, the BUN and creatinine values were found to be significantly ( p < 0.05) increased in DXR-treated animals. These were significantly ( p < 0.05) restored in the AA (20 mg/kg) group. The DXR-induced increases in the levels of the heart, liver and kidney injury marker enzymes were significantly ( p < 0.05) reverted by animals pretreated with AA (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg for 7 days), but the best protection was provided by AA (20 mg/kg) (Fig. 3 ).

Heart Rate and ECG
DXR-treated animals had significantly ( p < 0.005) increased heart rates and prolongation of the QT interval and ST height compared with the controls. The heart rate, QT interval and ST height were found to be 281.5 ± 5.487, 56.18 ± 5.128 and 0.04055 ± 0.003815 mV in the controls, and these were 347.5 ± 9.778, 87.89 ± 2.017 and 0.07488 ± 0.003744 mV in the DXR-treated group, respectively. The DXR-induced increases in the heart rate and prolongation of the QT interval were significantly ( p < 0.005) reverted best in the AA (20 mg/kg)-pretreated animals, and these were found to be 293.0 ± 10.48 and 68.43 ± 3.046 mV, respectively. The results are shown in Table 1 and in Fig. 4 .

Antioxidant Enzymes
DXR (67.75 mg/kg, iv , 48 h prior to the end of the study) causes significant ( p < 0.005) depletion of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in heart, liver and kidney tissues, and the reduced values were found to be 41.99 ± 1.83, 46.48 ± 1.83 and 43.01 ± 1.3. They were best restored by AA (20 mg/kg), to 73.66 ± 2.88, 75.95 ± 1.96 and 80.3 ± 3.3, respectively. DXR induced a reduction in the levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) in the heart, liver and kidney tissues to 54.19 ± 3.9, 49.26 ± 1.6 and 54.3.7 ± 3.7. These were best restored by AA (20 mg/kg) pretreatment, the values after pretreatment being 80.01 ± 2.35, 81.79 ± 3.06 and 84.78 ± 4 compared with the 100% animal antioxidant enzyme levels in the controls. DXR also markedly increased the levels of lipid peroxidation (LPO), these were restored by AA (20 mg/kg) (Fig. 5 ). Fig. 5 Protective effect of AA on DXR-induced increased oxidative stress in organs
Histopathology
The histopathological analysis showed that the heart, liver and kidney tissues of the control animals had normal architecture. However, the hearts of the animals treated with DXR showed marked peroxidation-derived tissue lesions including necrosis, peripheral cell infiltration, hyaline degeneration and congestion. The liver tissues of the animals treated with DXR showed leukocytic inflammation, centrilobular necrosis and apoptosis. The kidney tissues of the animals treated with DXR showed tubular area necrosis, inflammation and congestion. The animals were treated with AA in a dose-dependent manner, and a dose of 20 mg/kg produces a marked restoration of the architecture, with some congestion in the heart, liver and kidney tissues. The results are shown in Fig. 6 . Fig. 6 AA mg/kg shows a marked restoration of normal architecture in heart, liver and kidney tissues at dose-dependent manner
Immunofluorescence Analysis
The results of the immunofluorescence analysis of Nrf2 protein expression are shown in Fig. 7 . Nrf2 immunostaining in the heart, liver and kidney tissues of animals treated with DXR significantly decreased the Nrf2 protein expression level compared with the controls. Moreover, the results were closer to those of the tissues that were not treated with primary antibody. Animals pretreated with AA showed significant increases in Nrf2 protein expression. The Nrf2 protein expression was measured from the pixel density using the ImageJ software package. Fig. 7 AA shows the significant increase in Nrf2 protein expression in heart, liver and kidney
Cell Viability Assay (MTT Staining)

Discussion
This study shows that AA affords protection against DXR-induced heart, liver and kidney toxicity. The DXR dose used clinically for human beings is 400 mg/m 2 . Using an oncology tool, the corresponding dose in rats was found to be 67.75 mg/kg [ ]. This dose induced toxicity significantly in the heart, liver and kidney tissues in the rats. It has been suggested that DXR in the form of semiquinone is more toxic and plays a key role in the development of tissue toxicity [ ]. Semiquinone is an unstable moiety that is oxidised back to form quinine, the process leading to the formation of the superoxide anion [ ]. The superoxide anion reacts with molecular oxygen to form the free radical [ ]. Once the concentration of free radicals increases, they caused damage to the heart, liver and kidney tissues.
Administration of DXR significantly increased the injury marker enzymes of the heart, liver and kidney, such as CK-MB, LDH, SGPT, SGOT, BUN and creatinine. Our findings are in good agreement with those of previous studies [ , , ]. The toxicity developed by the DXR was revealed by biochemical as well as histopathological examination. There was marked peripheral cell inflammation, necrosis and congestion in the heart [ ], while in the liver there was leukocytic inflammation, centrilobular necrosis, apoptosis, congestion and fatty changes [ ]. In the kidney, there were lesions including tubular and focal area necrosis, inflammation and glomerular congestion [ , ]. Furthermore, at doses of 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg, AA was found afford protection in a dose-dependent manner against DXR-induced vital organ toxicity. The tissue protection offered by AA is might be through the modulation of Nrf2 translocation. The docking results support this hypothesis. In the basal condition, Nrf2 is bound with Keap1. AA, as a Michael acceptor, generates electrophiles, which break the attachment of Nrf2 with Keap1 [ ]. Once Nrf2 enters the nucleus and is stabilised, it gets dimerised with Maf proteins and transactivates several phase II antioxidant enzymes [ ], which protect the heart, liver and kidney tissues from the oxidative stress caused by free radicals. It is well documented that AA has antioxidant and free radical scavenging activities [ ]. The protection afforded to organs by AA is attributed to the modulation of the Nrf2 translocation factor. Moreover, the histopathological data reveal that pretreatment with AA prevents DXR-induced alteration of the microstructures of the heart, liver and kidney tissues. At a dose of 20 mg/kg, AA causes a significant increase in the protein expression, and this was confirmed by the immunofluorescence analysis.
AA has been patented for its anticancer activity. This activity was also confirmed in our laboratory using the Hep3B, Hela and MCF-7 cancer cell lines. The IC 50 value of AA was found to be remarkable as shown in Fig. 8 .
The multifunctionality of AA as an anticancer, antioxidant Nrf2 translocation activator may add a synergistic effect to DXR treatment. Thus, the present study significantly emphasises that AA may be used as an Nrf2-modulating organ-protective adjuvant in DXR treatment.
Conclusion
AA is an antioxidant food supplement that exerts a protective effect in a dose-dependent manner against DXR-induced toxicity in the rat model. The protection afforded by AA might be through modulation of Nrf2 translocation. NrF2 translocation indirectly results in the production of phase II antioxidant enzymes. The antioxidant enzymes reverse the DXR-induced heart, liver and kidney tissue damage. Moreover, the AA is a multifunctional bioactive moiety that also displays anticancer activity in cancer cell lines. Hence, the findings suggest that AA can be used as an organ-protective adjuvant in DXR treatment. With antioxidant and anticancer activities and as an Nrf2 transcriptional factor activator, AA can reduce vital organ toxicity induced by DXR synergistically.
