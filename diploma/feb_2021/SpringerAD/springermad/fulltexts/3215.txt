Introduction
Migraine is a multisymptom disorder that severely hampers daily activities of patients suffering from it due to throbbing and intense headache in one half of the head. Sumatriptan succinate is a serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) agonist, the most commonly prescribed medicine for migraine, and is available as oral tablets, nasal spray, and subcutaneous injection dosage formulations [ , , ]. However, therapeutic efficacy of sumatriptan succinate is hampered in migraine patients due to gastric stasis, nausea, and vomiting resulting in erratic absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Also, sumatriptan succinate is incompletely absorbed following oral administration and undergoes first-pass metabolism, resulting in a low bioavailability [ , ].
Earlier mucoadhesive microspheres of sumatriptan succinate for nasal delivery have been prepared to avoid hepatic first-pass metabolism and improve its therapeutic efficacy [ ]. Shivanand et al. have reported mucoadhesive bilayered buccal tablets of sumatriptan succinate to improve its oral bioavailability [ ]. Recently, orodispersible tablets of sumatriptan succinate were prepared by freeze-drying technology which had rapid drug dissolution rate for allowing quick onset of action [ ].
Sumatriptan nasal spray (20 mg) is perceived to have a faster onset of action than the oral tablets (15 to 20 vs. 30 to 60 min) but still needs at least 1 to 1.5 h to reach its Tmax [ , ]. In the present study, we have designed fast-dissolving films of sumatriptan succinate to be quickly dispersed in the mouth for transmucosal absorption and thereby have a faster onset of action. Thin films administered by buccal route allow transmucosal absorption and inhibit first-pass metabolism [ ]. Fast-dissolving films not only have rapid onset of action but also offer a convenient way of dosing medications to patients with swallowing difficulties such as children and the elderly and also to the general population. Such film when placed either on a patient’s tongue or any oral mucosal tissue would be instantly wet by saliva, hydrate and rapidly disintegrate, disperse, and dissolve to release the medicament for transmucosal absorption.
For the preparation of hydrophilic films, polymers hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) and maltodextrin (MDT) known for their good film-forming properties were selected [ , ]. Propylene glycol was used as a suitable plasticizer on the basis of its properties to provide mechanical strength, flexibility, and elongation to the film. Poloxamer 407 (P407) is one of the most useful surfactant having solubilizing, wetting, and dispersing properties. Citric acid was added to stimulate saliva production in the mouth and also to assist in achieving faster dissolution [ ], and aspartame was used as a sweetener.
Time taken by such films to quickly disperse when placed in the mouth is important because dispersion of the film will not only solubilize the entrapped drug but also aid in the dissolution of film. This action may happen within seconds or may take some minutes. Hence, we optimized the in vitro dispersion time of the prepared film using a 3 2 factorial design. The application of the factorial design in the pharmaceutical formulations has played a key role in understanding the relationship between the independent variables and the responses to them [ ]. In this study, concentrations of HPMC, MDT, and P407 were the independent variables and the in vitro dispersion time was the response. Further in vitro dissolution study was carried out to determine the drug release, and finally, ex vivo buccal permeation study was carried out using goat buccal mucosa to evaluate the amount of drug permeation.
Materials and Methods
Materials
Sumatriptan succinate was obtained as a gift sample from Hetero Drugs Ltd., Hyderabad, India. Poloxamer 407 (BASF) and maltodextrin were procured from Indian Scientific, Bhopal, India. HPMC E15 was purchased from Loba Chemie, Mumbai, India. Propylene glycol, citric acid, and aspartame were obtained from S D Fine-Chem Ltd., Mumbai, India. All other reagents used were of analytical grade.
Preparation of Fast-Dissolving Films
Films were prepared by solvent casting method reported by Cilurzo et al. [ ]. Briefly, MDT (or HPMC), propylene glycol, and P407 were dispersed in distilled water at 60 °C under magnetic stirring. After cooling to 40 °C, sumatriptan succinate was added to it. The dispersion was set aside overnight to allow air bubbles to escape. The dispersion was then cast onto a glass Petri dish to obtain a uniform and thin film. After drying at 50 °C for 5–7 min in a hot air oven, the film was gently removed from the Petri dish, checked for any imperfections, and cut into desired sizes (2 × 2 cm). The composition of the film is shown in Table 1 .

Characterization of Films
Film-forming capacity of the polymer was categorized as poor, average, good, very good, and excellent [ ]. Appearance of the films was evaluated by visual observation such as transparent, semitransparent, or opaque [ ]. To ascertain the uniformity of the thickness of the film, the thickness of the fast-dissolving film (2 × 2 cm) was measured using a micrometer at different locations.
Folding Endurance
Folding endurance is the number of times the film could be folded manually at the same place without the sign of a visible crack. It was determined by repeated folding of the film at the same place till the film breaks.
Percent Elongation
When stress is applied, a film sample stretches, and this is referred to as strain. Strain is basically the deformation of film divided by original dimension of the sample. Generally, elongation of film increases as the plasticizer content increases. $$ \mathrm{Percent}\;\mathrm{elongation}=L\times 100/{L}_0 $$
where L is the increase in length of film and L 0 is the initial length of film.
Surface pH
The film to be tested was cut in strip of 2 cm × 2 cm and was placed in a Petri dish. It was moistened with 1 ml of distilled water and kept for 1 min. The surface pH was measured by a pH meter (Jyoti Scientific, India).
Content Uniformity
Five film patches (2 cm × 2 cm) were cut from the four corners and the central part of the molded film ( n = 3). Each film patch was placed in a separate conical flask containing 100 ml of distilled water. The flasks were shaken in a mechanical shaker for 2 h [ ]. All the solutions were filtered and analyzed at 227 nm in a UV-visible spectrophotometer using the placebo patch (patch without drug) film as the blank solution.
Optimization of Dispersion Time of Films by Factorial Design
Factorial Design
The use of a factorial design allows a minimum number of experiments for the determination of the influence of the factors investigated and their interactions [ ]. Such a design of experiments involves the study of the effects of two or more factors and is useful in studying the joint effect of the factors on a response. In a 3 2 factorial design two factors are taken and studied at three levels (minimum, middle, and maximum). In the present study, two factorial design experiments were independently used, one for HPMC E-15 film and another for maltodextrin film. In the HPMC E-15 film, the effect of independent variables, concentration of HPMC E-15 (X1), and concentration of P407 (X2) on mean dispersion time (DT) (Y1, response variables) was studied. Each factor was tested at three levels designated as −1, 0, and +1. Similarly, a 3 2 factorial design was used in the formulation of maltodextrin-based film to determine the effect of two independent variables, concentration of maltodextrin (X1), and concentration of P407 (X2) on dispersion time of film (DT) (Y2, response variables). Tables 2 and 3 summarize the nine experimental runs studied, their factor combinations, and the translation of the coded levels to the experimental units employed during the study. The values of the factors were transformed to allow easy calculation of coefficient in polynomial equation [ ]. To identify the effect of significant variables, the reduced model was generated. Interactive multiple regression analysis and F statistics were utilized in order to evaluate the response. The regression equations for the two responses were calculated using Eq. 1 : Table 2 Optimization of DT for HPMC E 15-P407 film by 3 2 factorial design: factors, their levels transformed values, and response-DT Batch no.

The response in the above equation Y is a quantitative effect of the formulation components or independent variables X1 and X2; β is the coefficient of the term X . The multiple regression was applied using Microsoft Excel in order to deduce the factors having significant effect on the formulation properties. To identify the significant variables, the variables having P value >0.05 in the full model were discarded [ ].
Contour plots and surface response plots are diagrammatic representation of the values of the response. They are helpful in explaining the relationship between independent and dependent variables. Response surface sets a mathematical trend in the experimental design for determining the optimum level of experimental factors required for a given response [ ]. The two-dimensional contour plots and three-dimensional surface response plots were designed using STATISTICA software at the values of X1 and X2 between −1 and +1 at a predetermined value of dispersion time.
In Vitro Dispersion Time
The test was performed using the method mentioned by El-Setouhy and El-Malak with slight modification [ ]. The film (2 × 2 cm) was placed on a glass Petri dish containing 10 ml of distilled water and gently stirred after every 10 s. The disintegration time is the time when a film starts to break or disintegrate. The time for complete dissolution of the film was recorded in triplicate as dispersion time at which no visible film part was seen and the film completely disperses in the medium [ ].
In Vitro Dissolution Study
The dissolution study was carried out using USP dissolution apparatus II paddle apparatus (Electrolab, Mumbai, India) in 300-ml phosphate buffer pH 6.8 kept at 37 ± 0.5 °C and stirred at 50 rpm. A film of 2 cm × 3 cm size was attached to a 3 cm × 3 cm steel mesh using adhesive tape and was placed in the bottom of the dissolution apparatus bowl. Five-milliliter samples were withdrawn every 15 s and analyzed spectrophotometrically at 227 nm using UV-visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu 1700, Japan). An equal volume of the fresh dissolution media, maintained at the same temperature, was added after withdrawing the sample.
Ex Vivo Buccal Permeation Study
The ex vivo buccal permeation study of fast dispersible films were carried out using goat buccal mucosa mounted on a modified Franz diffusion cell [ ]. Fresh buccal mucosa of goat was obtained from a local slaughter house, excised, trimmed evenly, washed, and placed between the donor and receptor compartments of the diffusion cell. The donor cell was filled with 1 ml of phosphate buffer (pH 6.8), and a sumatriptan succinate film was placed on it (20 mg). The receptor compartment (50 ml) was filled with phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) stirred with a magnetic bead at 50 rpm and maintained at 37° ± 0.5°. At predetermined time intervals, 1-ml sample was withdrawn and analyzed for sumatriptan succinate content at 227 nm using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu 1700, Japan).
Results and Discussions
Film Formation
Both the polymers HPMC and maltodextrin produced transparent and flexible films. They showed no blooming and had good film-forming capacity. The method used for the preparation of both types of film used less than 2 min drying at 50 °C in a hot air oven to facilitate nonagglomeration of polymer, drug, or other components within the film. As the drying time increases, dispersion gets more saturated leading to crystal growth due to intermolecular and interparticulate attractive forces. Furthermore, the application of long drying time would expose the film to convection forces of the air flow causing agglomeration in the film [ ]. Formation of agglomerates would also hamper drug content uniformity in the film. Air may be trapped in the composition during the mixing process which can leave voids in the film. Such air collapses around the voids resulting in an uneven surface. Hence, due care was taken to remove all entrapped air by keeping the dispersion overnight before pouring it on a Petri dish.
The outer and inner portions of the film do not experience the same external conditions during drying. Hence, thicker uniform films are more difficult to achieve. The prepared films were thin and uniform and had thickness ranging from 0.206 to 0.328 mm.
The surface pH of fast-dissolving films was determined to study the possibility of any side effects in vivo. An acidic or alkaline pH may cause irritation to the oral mucosa. All of the films had a surface pH as close to neutral (∼6.5) as possible (Table 4 ). Table 4 Physicochemical characterization and mechanical properties of films ( n = 5) Formulation code Drug content uniformity (%) Surface pH Film thickness (mm) Folding endurance Elongation (%) Film-forming capacity Appearance HF1 99.31 ± 1.09 6.91 ± 0.08 0.328 ± 0.01 97.04 ± 2.0 44.38 ± 2.8 Good Transparent HF5 100.49 ± 1.6 6.73 ± 0.21 0.2267 ± 0.01 99.43 ± 1.7 58.56 ± 3.7 Very good Transparent M1 100.78 ± 0.5 6.86 ± 0.1 0.206 ± 0.005 104.02 ± 1.2 66.78 ± 2.3 Good Transparent M9 100.17 ± 0.2 6.85 ± 0.07 0.295 ± 0.01 112.67 ± 2.5 70.25 ± 0.7 Very good Transparent
The drug content uniformity of all the films were well within the limits (100 ± 2 %) indicating uniform distribution of drug in each film.
All the prepared films had high percent elongation values signifying the flexibility of the films. HPMC films had elongation values from 44.38 to 58.56 %, and maltodextrin films had elongation values from 66.78 to 70.25 % (Table 4 ).
Folding endurance gives an indication of brittleness of the film. The folding endurance value of the prepared films ranged from 97.04 to 112.67 (Table 4 ). Folding endurance value gives an indication of brittleness of the film; the higher the value is, the less brittle the film is. The high values obtained indicated that the films formed were not brittle.
Factorial Design for Optimization of Dispersion Time
HPMC E-15-Based Film
Nine batches were prepared as per 3 2 factorial design to study the effect of two independent variables, concentration of HPMC E-15 (X1), concentration of Poloxamer 407 (X2) on the response, and dispersion time of films (Y1). The in vitro dispersion time varied from 33 to 60 s. The least dispersion time was observed in middle level of X1 (4) and middle level of X2 (1.0) in batch HF5. The responses in equation Y1 are the quantitative effect of the formulation components or independent variables X1 and X2. Equation 2 shown below is for the full model. $$ \mathrm{Y}1=32.5556-5.66667\mathrm{X}1-4.5\mathrm{X}2+9.6667\mathrm{X}{1}^2+9.1667\mathrm{X}{2}^2 - 1.5\mathrm{X}1\mathrm{X}2 $$ (2)
The results of the analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the full model is presented in Table 5a , and the regression output of the full model is presented in Table 5b . Model F value (523.114) for this was more than the tabulated F value ( F tab = 9.01), implying that the model was significant. The R 2 value of the full model was also high (0.9988). The R 2 value explains variability around the mean; therefore, the model was able to explain 99.88 % variability in the results. The regression coefficients having P value <0.05 are significant, and in the full model, all the regression coefficients were having P value <0.05 indicating significance of the model. The results show that the in vitro dispersion time greatly depends on both the concentration of HPMC and P-407. A reduced model was not required in this case.

The visual pictures of the output by the three-dimensional response surface plots and two-dimensional contour plots and are shown in Fig. 1a, b , respectively. It was seen from the plots that in vitro dispersion time of ∼32 s could be achieved by keeping X1 range from 0.0 to 0.6 (HPMC from 4 to 5 % w / v ) and keeping X2 from 0.0 to 0.6 (P-407 from 1.0 to 1.3 % w / v ).

Maltodextrin Film
The mean in vitro dispersion time of maltodextrin film ranged from 32 to 47 s. The lowest dispersion time was observed in the highest level of X1 (1:4) and the highest level of X2 (1.5 % w / v ) in batch M9.

Table 6c shows each of the observed values of Y and was compared with the predicted values of Y from the model. The low residual value shows good correlation between the observed and the predicted values. The response surface curves and contour plots were drawn at −1 level to 1 level of X1 and X2 to give a diagrammatic representation of the values of the response and are shown in Fig. 2a, b . The plots were found to be linear; therefore, linear relationship exists between X1 and X2 variables. It was concluded from the contour and the response surface curves that the in vitro dispersion time of 32 s could be obtained with X1 range from 0.6 level (7.5 % w / v ) to 1.0 level (9.0 % w / v ) and X2 range from 0.8 (1.4 % w / v ) to 1.0 (1.5 % w / v ). The optimized in vitro dispersion time for both the type of films is ∼30 s which is well within the acceptable limits [ ].

Dissolution Studies
A drug’s pharmacological effects can only occur once it has been fully dissolved, and this solubilized drug then enters into the bloodstream. The dissolution data of sumatriptan succinate from the different films is depicted in Fig. 3 . It was seen that both the films dissolved almost completely in about 90 s whereas the pure drug was only dissolved to an extent of 38 % in that time. Maltodextrin owning to its capacity to facilitate more water penetration into the films could show faster dissolution of the film. Fig. 3 In vitro dissolution study
Ex Vivo Permeation Studies
The permeability of the buccal mucosa is 4–4000 times greater than that of the skin [ ]. Although the sublingual mucosa is relatively more permeable than the buccal mucosa, it was not a choice for the permeation as it is not suitable for an oral transmucosal delivery system. The sublingual region lacks an expanse of smooth muscle or immobile mucosa and is constantly washed by a considerable amount of saliva making it difficult for device placement. The buccal mucosa is a more preferred route for systemic transmucosal drug delivery [ ].
The ex vivo buccal permeation of drug from the fast dispersible films is shown in Fig. 4 . In the first 30 min, only 20 % of the plain drug could permeate through the mucosa whereas the fast-dissolving films had double (40 %) the amount of drug permeated. The possible mechanism is that the presence of poloxamer facilitated faster dissolution of the film and then Tween 80 (permeation enhancer) allowed easy permeation of the drug through the buccal mucosa. Thirty-eight percent of the drug was permeated from the HPMC film, and about 42 % was permeated from maltodextrin film in 30 min. It means that 7.6 and 8.4 mg of the drug were permeated across the mucosa in the first 30 min for HPMC and maltodextrin film, respectively. Herein, it is important to see what fraction of the amount of drug we were expecting to permeate in this time. As per the literature available, the maximum single recommended adult dose of sumatriptan injection for the acute treatment of migraine is 6 mg ( http://www.rxlist.com/imitrex-injection-drug/indications-dosage.htm ). Good correlation was observed between in vitro drug release and ex vivo drug permeation with a correlation coefficient of 0.97651 for HPMC film (HF5) and 0.98071 for maltodextrin film (M9), respectively. This also suggests a significant relation in the pattern of drug release and drug permeation from the films. Fig. 4 Ex vivo permeation across buccal membrane
Conclusion
In the present study, fast-dissolving films of sumatriptan succinate were successfully prepared using HPMC and maltodextrin polymers. The films were characterized using different techniques and found to have the desired mechanical attributes. These films showed in vitro dispersion time of ∼30 s. In vitro dissolution studies and permeation studies confirmed the faster release of drug from the film and permeation through the buccal mucosa. It was finally concluded that such fast-dissolving films of sumatriptan succinate would mediate the release of drug and would be potentially useful for the treatment of migraine where quick onset of action is required.
