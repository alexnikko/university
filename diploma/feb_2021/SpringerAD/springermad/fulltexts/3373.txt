Introduction
In the midst of several cardiovascular diseases, ischaemic heart disease is the foremost cause of morbidity and mortality in both industrialized and developing countries and is envisaging, being the key and most common threat to human life by 2020 [ , , ]. A number of means have been proposed to explicate the myocardial injury and hemodynamic dysfunction during myocardial infarction (MI). It occurs due to imbalance between myocardial blood supply and demand, resulting in development of ischaemia and induction of necrosis in myocardium. Unwarranted production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide radical, hydroxyl radical and nitric oxide those are extremely unstable and typically reactive is an important observation in heart failure [ , , ]. On the whole, the treatments existing for ischaemic injury, including myocardial infarction, are directed towards reinstatement of blood supply to cardiac tissue and put off the damage imposing at the time of injury [ ]. The existing management for MI includes beta blockers, ACE inhibitors/ARBs, nitrates and anti-thrombotic agents [ ]. Though, in the face of the upgrading and ease of use of these therapies, the early death rate from acute MI is about 30 %, with more than half of these deaths occurring before the stricken individual reaches the hospital [ ].
The vital role of ROS in the pathophysiology of MI has been incorrigible by the knack of antioxidants to trim down ischaemic injury in the animal model of isoproterenol (ISO)-induced myocardial infarction [ , , , ]. ISO is a synthetic non-selective β adrenoceptor agonist and in arrears to its positive inotropic and chronotropic effects has been reported to produce ischaemia-like condition as a result of disturbed physiological balance between production of free radicals and antioxidative defence system [ , ]. It is the heightened condition of myocardial damage which causes cardiac dysfunction, increased malondialdehyde content, altered activities of cardiac injury marker or the membrane-bound protectors of heart and antioxidant enzymes and increases cell level of myocardial necrosis that have been caught up as important risk factors in the defeat of integrity and functions of myocardial membranes [ , , , , , , ]. The pathophysiological and morphological alterations pragmatic in ISO-treated rats have been found to be analogous to those observed in human myocardial infarction [ ]. Flavonoids comprise the prime class of dietary phytochemicals, adding up indispensable health importance to our diet, and are promising as a key nutraceuticals [ , ]. Apigenin (AP) (4, 5,7-trihydroxyflavone) is a flavonoid copious in apples, celery oranges and wheat sprouts [ , , ]. It has been confirmed to help on the road to recovery of cardiovascular circumstances, thought-provoking immune system, inhibiting platelet aggregation, anti-inflammatory activity and providing some shield against cancer [ , , , ]. An assortment of enzymatic and non-enzymatic causes of reactive oxygen species (ROS) exists in blood vessels. Hence, ROS produced by these sources play a crucial role in the functioning of vascular physiology of cardiovascular disease [ , , ]. AP is reported as a strong antioxidant that not only stifles the formation of ROS and free radical generation or augmentation of endogenous antioxidant enzymes but also modulates contractile function of heart and the survival or death signalling of ROS [ , , , ]. Flavonoids are also believed to play an important role in activation of PPARγ which regulate the inflammatory response [ , , ]. It is reported that PPARγ may serve as a potential therapeutic target to prevent cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure in metabolic disorders [ , ]. AP is also shown to have activation property of PPARγ [ , , ] and tends to relieve the toxicity associated with the ISO-induced cardiac toxicity. In the peep of protective role of AP against antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and reported to activation of PPARγ, we hypothesized that AP may have cardioprotective effect. Thus, the present study was designed to examine the effects of AP on hemodynamic, biochemical and histopathological changes in ISO-induced model of myocardial infarction.
Materials and Methods
Animals
Adult male Wistar rats (250–300 g) were procured from the departmental animal house and housed at the animal house of the institute at standard laboratory conditions with a temperature of 25 ± 1 °C, relative humidity of 45–55 % and 12:12-h light/dark cycle. Animals had free access to food (Standard chow pellet, Nutrivet Life Sciences, Pune) and water ad libitum. The experimental protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Ethical Committee (IAEC) of R.C. Patel Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research; Shirpur constituted as per the Committee for Purpose of Supervision and Control on the Experimental Animals, CPCSEA reg. no. 651/02/c/CPCSEA (protocol approval no. IAEC/RCPIPER/2014/25/09).
Chemicals
AP, isoproterenol (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and GSH were obtained from Loba Chemie Pvt. Ltd. (Mumbai, India), and CK-MB and LDH kits (Span diagnostics, Mumbai, India) were purchased. All other reagents used were of analytical grade.
Experimental Protocol for ISO-Induced Myocardial Toxicity in Rats [11]
ISO (100 mg/kg) was injected subcutaneously (s.c.) to rats daily for two successive days, i.e. on days 13 and 14, respectively, with 24 h of interval to induce experimental myocardial infarction.
Experimental Groups
A total of 40 animals were used for this study. They were randomly divided into five groups ( n = 8),
Group 1 Normal (Vehicle Treated)
Rats were administered 0.1 % v/v dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution i.p. for 14 days and on the days 13 and 14; they were administered 0.3 ml saline, s.c. at an interval of 24 h.
Group 2 ISO (Vehicle + ISO)
Rats were administered 0.1 % v/v DMSO solution i.p. for 14 days along with concurrent administration of ISO (100 mg/kg, s.c. at 24-h interval) on the days 13 and 14.
Groups 3–5 (AP + ISO)
Animals were treated with AP (AP) (25, 50 and 75 mg/kg/day) i.p. for a period of 14 days along with concurrent administration of ISO (100 mg/kg, s.c. at 24-h interval) on the days 13 and 14.
Changes in body weight, food and water intake patterns of animals in all groups were noted throughout the experimental period at regular intervals. After the last day of treatment, the rats were killed by decapitation subsequent to assessment of hemodynamic and electrocardiographic parameters. Blood samples were collected into tubes and allowed to clot at room temperature, and afterwards, serum was estranged by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C.
Pharmacological Evaluation
Assessment of Hemodynamic and Electrocardiographic Parameters
Surgical procedure as previously described [ ] was followed for recording of hemodynamic parameters. On the 15th day, i.e. after 24 h of last ISO injection, rat was anaesthetized with urethane (1.25 g/kg, i.p.). Throughout the experimental protocol, body temperature of the animal was maintained at 37 °C. The neck was opened with a ventral midline incision to perform tracheostomy, and animal was ventilated with room air from a positive pressure ventilator using compressed air at a rate of 90 strokes/min and a tidal volume of 10 ml/kg. Ventilator setting and PO2 were adjusted as needed to maintain the arterial blood gas parameters within the physiological range. The left jugular vein was cannulated with polyethylene tube (internal diameter 0.28 mm; outer diameter 0.35 mm) attached to a three-way cannula for continuous infusion of saline. The right carotid artery was cannulated with polyethylene tube (internal diameter 0.30 mm; outer diameter 0.40 mm) and attached to a three-way cannula. The cannula filled with heparinized saline was connected to the PowerLab data acquisition system. The blood pressure was measured using a pressure transducer for the measurement of systolic arterial pressure, diastolic arterial pressure, mean arterial pressure and heart rate. Heart was exposed through the left fifth intercostal space with the help of cervical cautery (Delta Medical Appliances, Mumbai, India). For the measurement of left ventricular hemodynamic variables, a wide bore (1.5 mm) sterile metal cannula connected to a pressure transducer was filled with heparinized saline (heparin 50 U/ml) and inserted into the left ventricular cavity through the apex of the heart. The left ventricular pressure dynamics were recorded on a PowerLab data acquisition system after 10 min of stabilization of blood pressure. The left ventricular pressure [left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and maximum rate of rise and fall of left ventricular pressure (peak +LVdP/dtmax and peak −LVdP/dtmax)] curve was recorded. After recording of the hemodynamic parameters, animals of all groups were killed with an overdose of anaesthesia (sodium pentobarbitone 100 mg/kg, i.v.); their hearts were excised and processed for biochemical and histopathological evaluations. For biochemical analysis, hearts were removed and stored in liquid nitrogen, whereas for light microscopic studies, they were fixed in 10 % buffered formalin.
Assessment of Biochemical Parameters
Tissue Parameters
The heart tissue was taken out from liquid nitrogen and transferred to ice-cold phosphate buffer saline (pH 7.4). The heart was cross-chopped with a surgical scalpel into fine slices, suspended in chilled 0.25 M sucrose solution and quickly blotted on a filter paper. Tissues were minced and homogenized finally to release soluble proteins in ice-cold Tris hydrochloride buffer (10 mM, pH 7.4). The homogenate so formed was centrifuged at 7000 rpm for 20 min using high-speed centrifuge, and the supernatant was used for estimation of tissue parameters.
Estimation of Reduced Glutathione (GSH)
Myocardial GSH was estimated by the method of Maron et al. [ ]. Briefly, 100 µl of tissue homogenate was mixed with 100 µl of 10 % trichloro-acetic acid and vortexed. The contents were then centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min. Subsequently 0.05 ml of supernatant was mixed with a reaction mixture containing 3.0 ml 0.3 M phosphate buffer (pH 8.4) and 0.5 ml DTNB [5,5′dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid)]. Within 10 min, the absorbance was measured at 412 nm using a spectrophotometer. GSH was determined from a standard curve produced using commercially available standard GSH (Sigma Chemicals, USA). The amount was expressed as milligrams of GSH/g of wet tissue.
Estimation of Lipid Peroxidation
Lipid peroxidation in the hearts was determined by measuring MDA content using the method reported by Ohkawa et al. [ ]. Briefly, 0.2 ml of homogenate was mixed with 0.2 ml of 8.1 % sodium dodecyl sulphate, 1.5 ml of 30 % acetic acid (pH 3.5) and 1.5 ml of 0.8 % thiobarbituric acid. The reaction mixture was heated for 60 min at 95 °C and then cooled on ice bath. After cooling, 1.0 ml of distilled water and 5.0 ml of n-butanol/pyridine (15:1 v/v) solution were added and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 20 min. The absorbance of the pink colour in organic layer was measured at 532 nm. 1, 1, 3, 3-tetraethoxypropane (Sigma Chemicals, USA) was used as the standard MDA, and levels were expressed as µg/g tissue.
Estimation of Catalase
Catalase activity was estimated by the method described by Aebi [ ]. To 50 µl of tissue supernatant, 1.0 ml of 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7) and 0.1 ml of 30 mM hydrogen peroxide were added, and a decrease in absorbance at 240 nm was measured every 5 s for 30 s. Catalase levels were expressed as U/mg protein.
Estimation of Superoxide Dismutase
SOD activity was determined by the method of Mishra and Fridovich [ ] with slight modifications. To 100 µl of tissue supernatant, 2.85 ml of 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 8.4) and 50 µl of 7.5 Mm pyrogallol were added, and absorbance was measured at 420 nm for 3 min at 30-s intervals. Enzyme levels were expressed as U/mg protein.
Estimation of Creatine Kinase-MB Isoenzyme
CK-MB isoenzyme was estimated in serum using commercial kit from span diagnostics (Mumbai, India) following the method of Lamprecht et al. [ ]. One unit of CK-MB isoenzyme is defined as the amount of enzyme that will transfer 1 mol of phosphate from phosphocreatine to ADP per min at pH 7.4 on 30 °C. The absorbance was measured at 340 nm for 3 min at 60-s intervals. Enzyme content was expressed as IU/mg protein.
Estimation of Lactate Dehydrogenase
LDH was estimated in serum using commercial kit from span diagnostics (Mumbai, India) the method described by Cabaud and Wroblewski [ ]. One unit of LDH is defined as the amount of enzyme required to reduce 1 mol of pyruvate to d-lactate per min at pH 7 on 25 °C. The absorbance was measured at 340 nm for 3 min at 60-s intervals. Enzyme content was expressed as IU/mg protein.
Histopathology
Light Microscopic Study
Tissues fixed in buffer formalin were embedded in paraffin and serial sections (3 µm thick) and were cut using microtome (Leica RM 2125, Germany). Each section was stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The sections were examined under the light microscope, and photographs were taken. Representative area images were captured (Motic images plus 2.0) in an image analysis system, Cool snap digital camera and Pentium 4 computer (Compaq, USA) with image analysis software Image Pro plus (Media Cybernetics, USA). At least four hearts from each group were assessed for light microscopic studies. A minimum of 10 fields per slide were examined and graded for severity of changes using scores on a scale of severe (+++), moderate (++), mild (+) and nil (−). The pathologist performing histopathological evaluation was blinded to the treatment assigned to different study groups.
Statistical Analysis
The data are expressed as mean ± SEM, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnet post hoc test using a graph pad, prism software, version 5.0, USA. The value of p < 0.05 was considered as a significant.
Results
Mortality and Body Weight Changes
In general, mortality of 5 % was observed throughout the study protocol. The thrashing of animals was due to bleeding or unseemly cannulation of blood vessel whilst performing the surgery. No significant change in body weights was observed in dissimilar experimental groups as compared to their normal values.
Effect of AP on Hemodynamic and Electrocardiographic Parameters
Figure 1 shows the effect of AP on arterial pressure. ISO control rats showed a significant decrease in systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure ( p > 0.001) as compared with the normal group or vehicle-treated group, although treatment with ISO led to an increase in heart rate as compared to the normal rats. Fourteen-day treatment with the AP at doses of 25, 50 and 75 mg/kg normalized systolic, diastolic blood pressure ( p > 0.001) as compared to normal or vehicle-treated group. Heart rate was also found to be normalized ( p > 0.001) by the treatment of AP. Fig. 1 Effects of AP (25, 50, 75 mg/kg) on hemodynamic parameters in ISO-induced myocardial infarction in rats. a .

Figure 1 d exhibits the deleterious effect of ISO on LVEDP and their reinstatement towards the control values by AP. ISO treatment resulted in ventricular dysfunction as signified by increased in the level of LVEDP ( p > 0.001) as compared to normal group, which was significantly attenuated by entire treatment groups ( p > 0.001) as compared to ISO control group. Figure 2 shows the effect of ISO on the peak positive pressure and negative pressure of left ventricle. Administration of ISO in rats showed significant decrease ( p > 0.001) in the level of (+) LVDP/d t and (−) LVDP/d t as compared to normal group, whilst treatment with the AP at the entire doses showed significant ( p > 0.001) attenuation of peak pressures as compared to the ISO-treated disease control rats. AP (75) was found to be more prone towards cardioprotection.

ECG patterns and waveform were found to be abnormal in ISO-treated rats as compared to normal group as shown in Fig. 3 . In ISO-treated rats showed increase in ST interval and RR interval as shown in Table 1 . The entire treatment groups of AP significantly normalized the ECG wave forms as well the ST interval and RR interval.

Effect of AP on the Activities of Catalase, GSH, SOD and MDA Content
Cardiotoxicity induced by ISO shows evidence of a significant increase ( p > 0.001) in the activity of malondialdehyde content as compared to the normal rats also decrease in activities of reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase and catalase content as ( p > 0.001) compared to the normal rats. AP dose-dependently counteracted the deleterious effect of ISO by decreasing the level of malondialdehyde and increasing the content of SOD ( p > 0.01), GSH ( p > 0.001) and catalase ( p > 0.001). AP (75) showed maximum protection against the antioxidant parameters (Fig. 4 ). Fig. 4 Effects of AP (25, 50, 75 mg/kg) on biochemical parameters in ISO-induced myocardial infarction in rats . a .

Effect of AP on Myocardial Injury Markers
A significant decline in myocardial injury marker enzymes, CK-MB isoenzyme and LDH was observed in the myocardium of ISO-treated group ( p > 0.001) as compared to normal group (Fig. 5 ). AP treatment at all doses (25, 50 and 75 mg/kg) significantly ( p > 0.001) attenuated the depletion of myocardial enzymes, CK-MB and LDH in comparison with ISO control group. AP (75) was proven utmost defence against the myocardial injury markers.

Effect of AP on histopathological changes of rat myocardium
Figure 6 a–e shows the light micrograph of left ventricular part of rat’s myocardium of diverse experimental groups. The light microscopic observations of myocardial histoarchitecture were qualitatively graded on the basis of myonecrosis, inflammatory cells and oedema (Table 2 ). The myocardium of normal group showed a normal histoarchitecture (Fig. 6 a). Myocardium of ISO control rats showed massive necrosis of myofibres with cell infiltration, oedema and increased connective tissue among myocardial fibres along with extravasations of red blood cells (Fig. 6 b). Rats treated with AP (25, 50 and 75 mg/kg) did not showed any adverse effect on myocardial histology. The myocardial fibres appeared almost in normal histoarchitecture as compared to ISO-treated group. Rats received AP (75) exhibited a close resemblance of myocardial histoarchitecture with the normal myocardial histology of vehicle control group.

Discussion
The results of present study demonstrated the preventive effect of AP in ISO-induced model of myocardial infarction and toxicity in rats. ISO rebel in rats causes quite a lot of physiological, pathological and functional changes in the myocardium, resembling the set of symptoms of human myocardial [ , , , ]; hence, this model has been extensively in a job to explore and get rid of luminosity on mechanisms and treatment of myocardial necrosis. Myocardial infarction is related to various deleterious symptoms or conditions, which led to damage the cardiac tissues and showed abnormality in the membrane-bound protective guards present in the myocardium. Such as failure of antioxidant mechanisms, cell necrosis in rats and increases the oxidative stress in the myocardium [ , , ]. ISO is also identified to create oxidative stress or amplify oxidative hassle by means of configuration of adrenochromes through its auto-oxidation, which is concerned in the production of extremely toxic oxygen-derived free radicals and augments generation of thiobarbituric acid reactive substance as increase in lipid peroxidation [ , ]. In the present study, we observed that AP protected the myocardium from ISO-induced myocardial membranous injury via positively enhanced hemodynamic, electrocardiographic, biochemical and histopathological parameters, suggesting that its cardioprotective action has been reported to improve cardiac function and improve the action of PPARγ receptor signalling [ , , ]. The results we observed clearly show that 14 days pretreatment with AP in ISO-treated rats exhibits dose-dependent reduction in systolic, diastolic arterial pressures and heart rate as compared to normal or vehicle-treated group. Nevertheless, the results were found to be significant in ISO faceup to rats as compared to normal treated group. AP is a flavonoid, and flavonoids are most excellently identified for their antioxidant activities [ ]; till now, they have many more biological effects. Many different enzymes involved in intracellular signalling can be affected by flavonoids [ ]. AP is also activating the intracellular PPARγ receptor and can be useful to find out the way for metabolic disorders. It is reported that AP exhibits neuroprotection against oxidative stress-induced cell death by blocking caspase-3 activity [ ]. Mascaraque et al. [ ] reported that AP has strong anti-inflammatory activity. Present work showed ISO-induced increase in LVEDP in rats, a marker of preload that again reflects an improvement of left ventricular function. AP led to attenuating the increase in LVEDP. AP normalized the left ventricular end-diastolic function by increasing inotropic (+LVdP/dtmax, indicator of myocardial contraction) and lusitropic (−LVdP/dtmax, sign of myocardial relaxation) contractility guards of the myocardium. Besides the antioxidant property of AP, several recent hear say documents; AP has a protective effect towards human vascular endothelial function and relaxation against oxidative stress in several animal models [ , ]. Recent studies have demonstrated that thiazolidinediones, a PPARγ agonist, assuage myocardial ischaemia reperfusion injury [ , ], myocardial inflammation [ ] and left ventricular hypertrophy [ ] via inhibiting penetration of seditious cells or up ruling of cytokines in myocardium, which indicates that PPARγ agonist activity may have anti-inflammatory effect in myocardium and that considering the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and PPARγ agonistic activity of AP, our result suggests that AP has protective effect against ISO-induced cardiac changes through its tri-functional effects. Not only the hemodynamic, electrocardiographic and ventricular functions, but also a number of diagnostic marker enzymes like creatinine kinase-MB isoenzyme and lactate dehydrogenase are present in myocardium and have been worn as a forecaster for pathological and internal changes. These enzymes are released from intracellular membranes into the extracellular fluid during the oxidative stress or myocardial injury [ , ]. In the present study, we observed that these enzymes decrease in their activities in the myocardium of ISO-treated rats, which is in line with the previous study reported by Li et al. [ ] and showed ISO-induced myocardial damage of the cardiac membrane. We found that 14-day treatment of AP significantly attenuated the activities of CK-MB isoenzyme and LDH in the myocardial tissue during ISO affront. The cardioprotective effect of AP might be due to decreasing in the myocardial damage by preserving the cell membrane integrity and stability, consequently put a ceiling on the seepage of CK-MB and LDH from the myocardium towards the extracellular fluids. Activated lipid peroxidation is an important pathogenic element that occurs in myocardial infarction; accumulation of lipid hydroperoxide levels reflects the major stages of disease and reflects the damage of myocardial necrosis and cardiac constituents [ ]. Reactive oxygen species which are highly toxic by-products of aerobic metabolism are known to act in response widely to cellular membranes and macromolecules; thus, pretty formation of lipid peroxides culminates into tissue damage [ ]. The augmented echelon of MDA observed in the present study following ISO treatment might be due to free radical scavenging membrane damage [ ]. Result of the present study shows that treatment with AP significantly normalized the MDA. Administration of ISO in rats is known to produce free radical moieties via its quinine metabolites which further react with oxygen and produces superoxide anions or reactive oxygen species, leading to the development of an oxidative environment known as oxidative stress. Free radical scavenging endogenous antioxidants such as SOD, catalase and reduced glutathione are the first line of cellular defence against oxidative injury [ ]. We observed the decrease in the levels of these endogenous antioxidants in the myocardium following ISO administration [ ]. In the present study, we observed that the significant decrease in the activities of SOD, catalase and GSH level in ISO-treated rats, whereas treatment with AP significantly attenuated it. AP (75) showed more pronouncing effect. These verdicts are in harmony with studies reporting that AP has strong antioxidant activity [ ]. The seal so suggested that blood pressure and other parameters attenuated cardioprotective activity of AP might be related to reduction in oxidative damage and/or enhancement in cellular antioxidative mechanism against oxidative stress. To additionally examine the cardioprotective effect of AP, we have performed histopathology. Histopathological findings of the myocardium treated with AP showed a fighting fit normal structure and architecture of cardiac muscle or tissue with refusal facts of myocardial damage and necrosis as compared to ISO-induced myocardial infracted rat’s heart. These records further confirmed the myocardial protective activity of AP in ISO-induced myocardial infarction. In the illumination of these results, the present study supports that AP at the dose of 75 mg/kg improves myocardial functions, increases endogenous antioxidants in the tissue by decreasing oxidative stress and decreases myocardial injury and malondialdehyde content of tissue. To boot, AP regularize histopathological changes causes by ISO treatment in rats.
Conclusion
The cardioprotective effect of AP is due to putting on a normal footing of hemodynamic, electrocardiographic parameters, endogenous antioxidant level and histopathological necrosis. However, there is necessity to evaluate the exact mechanism of AP relating to their activation of PPARγ pathway and positive effects towards the cardioprotection.
